[19:45] all your blessings, Lord, and your
[19:47] goodness, your grace, and your mercy,
[19:48] Lord, that you bestow upon us, Lord. And
[19:51] we're just unworthy, unworthy people,
[19:53] [music] but Lord, even while we were yet
[19:55] sinners, Lord, you loved us, Lord. God,
[19:57] we thank you for your love and [music]
[19:59] we thank you, Lord, for your
[20:00] predestination, Lord. And the Holy Ghost
[20:02] that, Lord, came and despite of where we
[20:05] were in life, your Holy Spirit came and
[20:07] found [music] us and plucked us out of

[20:20] children. And Lord, now your children
[20:23] have gathered together, Lord, under
[20:24] [music] the presence of the unchanging
[20:26] word of God. And Lord, your word says
[20:29] that where two or three are gathered
[20:31] together [music] in my name, there I am
[20:33] in the midst. And Lord, there's more
[20:35] than two and three gathered together,
[20:36] Lord. And we just come as your children.
[20:39] We come boldly before your throne of
[20:41] grace, Lord. We come with the authority
[20:44] as the queen of heaven, [music] Lord,
[20:45] and already seated together with you in
[20:47] heavenly places with in with and in

[21:01] Lord, and bring them all to your
[21:02] attention, Lord. all the elderly, Lord,
[21:05] that would love to be in the house and
[21:06] would love to enjoy the presence that we
[21:08] feel here. But Lord, due to
[21:10] circumstances of life and the frailty of
[21:12] humanity, they're shut in. Lord, may you
[21:15] just reveal to them, Lord, that you
[21:16] they're not forgotten. [music] Lord, we
[21:18] just pray that you bless them in a
[21:19] special way even this evening and go to
[21:21] them and minister to them and touch
[21:24] their lives. Lord, all the sicknesses,
[21:26] Lord, that Satan has attacked, [music]
[21:28] Lord, your children's body with, Father,
[21:29] you took stripes for that impalish
[21:32] judgment hall. It's already been bought
[21:34] and paid for, Lord. And we just now want
[21:36] to confess to you that we believe, Lord.
[21:39] When you were here on earth and you'd
[21:40] perform miracles, that's all you would
[21:41] ask is, "Do you now [music] believe?"
[21:44] Father, we want to confess with our
[21:46] heart and with our soul that we believe
[21:48] you. And Lord, we just commit all these
[21:50] requests and every life [music] under
[21:52] every hand that was raised. We commit it
[21:54] all to you. We rededicate our lives a
[21:56] new to you, Father, in this service. We
[21:59] give you all the praise, honor, and
[22:00] glory. We just pray over the word as it
[22:01] goes forth. Bless your servant tonight,
[22:04] Lord. May he step out of the way. May he
[22:06] yield to that gift you've put in his
[22:08] life, Lord, that it [music] may minister
[22:09] the word to us. We love you now. We
[22:11] thank you in advance for what you're
[22:13] going to do. We give [music] you all the
[22:14] praise, honor, and glory in Jesus

[45:01] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[45:03] Lord Jesus Christ. My goodness.
[45:08] Hallelujah. And that's our heart is to
[45:11] cry out holy unto the Lord God Almighty.
[45:13] [music]
[45:14] Amen. Isn't it a pleasure to be in the
[45:17] house of the Lord? Amen. If you have
[45:19] your Bibles tonight, we'd like to go
[45:22] into the book of Philippians chapter 1
[45:25] and verse 27.
[45:38] Philippians chapter 1 verse 27 and also
[45:41] 1st Samuel chapter 22 and verse 1
[46:03] Philippians 1:27 and only let your
[46:06] conversation
[46:07] be as it becometh the gospel of Christ,
[46:11] that whether I come and see you, or else
[46:14] be absent, I may hear of your affairs,
[46:18] that you stand fast in one spirit with
[46:21] one mind, striving together for the
[46:24] faith of the gospel, and in nothing
[46:27] terrified by your adversaries, which is
[46:30] to them an evident token of predition,
[46:33] but to you of salvation, and that of
[46:36] God. For unto you it is given in the
[46:40] behalf of Christ, not only to believe on
[46:42] him, but also to suffer for his sake.
[46:46] 1st Samuel 22 and verse 1.
[47:08] and say amen when you have it this
[47:10] evening. David therefore departed thence
[47:14] and escaped to the cave Agilum. And when
[47:17] he was brethren and all his father's
[47:19] house heard it, they went down thither
[47:23] to him. And everyone that was in
[47:26] distress, and everyone that was in debt,
[47:29] and everyone that was discontented,
[47:32] gathered themselves unto him. And he
[47:36] became a captain over them. And there
[47:40] were with him about 400 men. How many
[47:43] has a need that you'd like to make known
[47:44] to the Lord tonight? Amen. Let's just
[47:46] talk to the father just now. Lord Jesus,
[47:49] we come before you tonight. Lord Jesus,
[47:52] we're your hungry children and we are
[47:54] desiring to be fed tonight. We're
[47:56] asking, Lord Jesus, that your sweet,
[47:58] holy presence, Lord, would just begin to
[48:01] sweep over our lives, Lord. The songs of
[48:03] Zion have been sung. Your presence has
[48:06] been felt, Lord. Even in the specials, I
[48:08] was back there in the back office and
[48:10] felt your presence just like a cool
[48:12] breeze in the summertime just come
[48:14] rushing through the office. We realize
[48:16] that you're here tonight to do great
[48:18] things. Our expectations are at an
[48:22] ultimate height. We're asking Lord Jesus
[48:25] that you would come, the creator of
[48:27] heaven and earth. You would take both
[48:30] hearer and speaker tonight and you would
[48:32] speak to us, Lord, from thy word. We
[48:35] love you so much, Lord Jesus. There's
[48:38] not enough words in the human vocabulary
[48:40] that could describe how much you mean to
[48:43] each of us here tonight. Father, we're
[48:46] asking Lord Jesus that you would touch
[48:48] every one of these hands, their hearts,
[48:51] Lord, their needs. We ask, Lord Jesus,
[48:53] that you would be God to their situation
[48:55] just now. And according to thy word, we
[48:58] have faith in it. We believe it. And we
[49:00] pray the prayer of faith over our lives
[49:03] in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. You may
[49:06] be seated tonight in the presence of the
[49:08] Lord. Tonight, I'd like to speak to you
[49:11] a little thought that I have had on my
[49:13] heart for over a year, and it looks like
[49:16] the Lord has just given us a little bit
[49:18] of grace to minister on it tonight. I'd
[49:20] like to speak a thought to you on united
[49:24] by the battle. United by the battle. And
[49:27] I would like to just go back to go verse
[49:30] 27 in Philippians verse one, chapter 1.
[49:33] and says, "Let our conversation, your
[49:36] conversation be as it becometh the
[49:37] gospel of Christ, that whether I come
[49:40] and see you or else be absent, that I
[49:43] might hear of your affairs, that you
[49:46] stand fast in one spirit, in one mind,
[49:49] striving together for the faith of the
[49:53] gospel." And I believe that is something
[49:55] that we ought to do ever so presently in
[49:57] this hour is that we ought to strive
[50:00] together to be in one mind and in one
[50:03] heart for the message of the hour. And I
[50:05] believe if there's anything that's worth
[50:07] doing and it's worth doing right and
[50:09] that's the message of the hour. I
[50:10] believe that the message deserves our
[50:13] every intent. It deserves our very best
[50:16] qualities that we can put to this life.
[50:18] I believe that our God deserves the best
[50:21] worship that we can absolutely give him.
[50:24] But I believe it's even greater that
[50:26] when we can come together in one mind,
[50:28] in one heart, and fully come together
[50:30] and realize that we've got one purpose.
[50:33] We've got one goal, we've got one great
[50:35] God that we're serving. We've got one
[50:37] big enemy that we're going out there to
[50:39] try to destroy. And it is by this
[50:41] message that we are even here today
[50:43] together. And we find that in this
[50:46] moment that we could say that we are
[50:48] united by the battle. That we are
[50:50] fighting an enemy that is wanting not
[50:53] only just to make us sick, but we are
[50:55] facing an enemy that is wanting to kill
[50:57] us and to destroy us. He doesn't just
[51:00] want our preachers. He doesn't just want
[51:02] the leoty. He wants the little bitty
[51:04] children in every way. And I believe
[51:06] that God has equipped us with the
[51:09] greatest greatest weapon that we could
[51:11] ever put in our hands. And that's this
[51:14] message. You find this this great drama
[51:16] that is set here tonight. You see King
[51:19] David. Yeah, I say he's a king in this
[51:21] moment. He doesn't look like a king, but
[51:24] he is a king. Even still, YOU FIND THAT
[51:27] DAVID is here in a cave. And if you've
[51:29] ever spent much time in a cave, I I
[51:31] remember as a little bitty child, I
[51:33] always wanted to find a little bitty
[51:35] hidden cave over in the mountains where
[51:37] we was hiding, hunting there in Pilot,
[51:39] Virginia. I like to find them little
[51:41] places. You ever get in them caves? Them
[51:43] caves ain't a very, very pleasant place.
[51:45] But there's something about a little
[51:47] bitty boy that he wants to find them
[51:49] little holes that maybe bears hide out
[51:51] and foxes and different things. But here
[51:53] you find a king hiding in a cave. And
[51:57] you can imagine what this cave may be
[51:59] made of limestone and different things
[52:01] of stelactites and stelagmites maybe
[52:04] hanging in different forms. And it it is
[52:07] the historians actually say about this
[52:09] cave of Agelon that it had a very small
[52:12] entrance. But as you entered into this
[52:14] cave, it had great big halls and
[52:16] different chambers in it. And you can
[52:18] imagine David the anointed hiding here
[52:21] in a cave. Yet he wasn't he wasn't
[52:24] enthroned in his in his c with a crown
[52:26] with a throne yet. But yet he here is a
[52:29] king that is a fugitive.
[52:34] Here he is. And what is he doing in this
[52:37] cave? He is fleeing FROM KING SAUL
[52:40] BECAUSE KING SAUL IS SO JEALOUS. AND
[52:43] HERE he is. He's so jealous of the gift
[52:46] that David had in his life. SO HE'S HERE
[52:49] HIDING IN the very cave of Agelon. BUT I
[52:52] WANT YOU TO NOTICE THAT even in the
[52:54] midst of a cave THAT YOU CAN FIND THAT
[52:56] GOD'S plan is working out in David's
[52:59] life. AND I BELIEVE THAT MANY TIMES that
[53:02] if WE WOULD LOOK THROUGH OUR LIFE THAT
[53:03] there were times that we were hiding in
[53:05] a cave. There were times and we were
[53:07] HIDING FROM DESPAIR BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
[53:09] KNOW WHICH way to GO AND MANY MANY
[53:11] DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU SEE, YOU FIND WHAT
[53:14] DROVE DAVID to this TO THIS CAVE WAS
[53:17] THAT KING SAUL HAD GOT TO A PLACE that
[53:20] Saul had lifted himself up IN HIS OWN
[53:23] HUMANITY. AND HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS THE
[53:25] GREATEST IN THE LAND. But David's
[53:28] SUCCESS IN A MATTER OF moments began to
[53:31] be even greater than Saul EVER HAD IN
[53:34] HIS ENTIRE LIFE. DAVID ACTUALLY WENT OUT
[53:37] JUST ON ONE TRIP WHEN HE COME BACK AFTER
[53:40] KILLING GOLIATH. AND HE CAME BACK AFTER
[53:42] ONE TRIP BEING UNITED WITH JONATHAN. HE
[53:46] COMES BACK AND THE SISTERS OF THE CITY
[53:48] OF THE MESSAGE STOOD OUT THERE AND BEGIN
[53:51] to scream OUT, "SAUL HAS KILLED HIS
[53:53] THOUSANDS. BUT DAVID, HIS TENS OF
[53:55] THOUSANDS." IMMEDIATELY THE SPIRIT OF
[53:58] JEALOUSY GOT UPON KING SAUL AND HE CAME
[54:01] THERE AND HE TRIED TO DESTROY. HE TRIED
[54:04] TO DESTROY THE GREATEST ANOINTING THAT
[54:07] WOULD EVER BE A KING IN ALL THE LAND.
[54:10] YOU realize that SAUL'S OWN SON JONATHAN
[54:14] actually became David's very own best
[54:17] friend. That there was a loyalty that
[54:19] was locked between between Jonathan and
[54:22] David. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS UNITED
[54:26] BECAUSE OF A BATTLE. There was a
[54:28] relationship THAT WAS SPENT AND
[54:30] STRENGTHENED BECAUSE OF BATTLE
[54:32] EXPERIENCES. And they had a covenant of
[54:35] love between one another. YOU EVER HAD
[54:37] THAT THAT KIND of a friend that there
[54:39] that that that the reason why that you
[54:42] are friends is because there's something
[54:45] that DREW YOU TOGETHER. THERE'S NOTHING
[54:47] like a friend that could that can go
[54:50] with you in the middle of a battle. YOU
[54:52] SEE, THERE'S A lot of people that can be
[54:54] your friends before the battle, BUT IN
[54:56] THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE, YOU'LL FIND OUT
[54:58] WHO YOUR REAL FRIEND IS. AND JONATHAN
[55:01] WAS THAT KIND OF A FRIEND TO DAVID. HE
[55:04] HAD BUILT HIM IN SUCH A WAY. HE HAD
[55:06] SACRIFICED HIS OWN LIFE IN SO MANY
[55:08] PLACES THAT JONATHAN ACTUALLY GAVE HIM
[55:12] OF HIS OWN HIS OWN KINGLY GARBS.
[55:15] JONATHAN DEFENDED HIM AGAINST PRESSURE
[55:18] AGAINST HIS OWN DADDY.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DIDN'T WANT SOMEBODY THAT WOULD
[55:23] BE JEALOUS BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS GREATER
[55:26] IN THE KINGDOM. GOD WAS GOING TO RAISE
[55:28] UP A LITTLE BITTY DAVID. HALLELUJAH. HE
[55:31] WAS GOING TO RAISE UP A DAVID THAT HAD
[55:33] PREPARED HIMSELF FOR BATTLE BEFORE THE
[55:36] BATTLE EVER SHOWED UP. HE WANTED
[55:38] SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW TO PRAY BEFORE
[55:41] THEY EVER GOT INTO BATTLE. HE WANTED
[55:43] SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW TO WORSHIP BEFORE
[55:46] THEY EVER GOT IN CHURCH. HE WANTED
[55:49] SOMEBODY THAT KNEW HOW TO WORSHIP IN
[55:51] PRIVATE JUST AS MUCH AS THEY COULD
[55:53] WORSHIP IN PUBLIC. HE WANTED SOMEBODY,
[55:56] HALLELUJAH, THAT KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE
[55:58] TO BE UNDERQUALIFIED.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED SOMEBODY THAT KNEW WHAT IT WAS
[56:04] LIKE TO LIVE in victory.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Other man said in the message, "Hear ye
[56:12] him." HE SAID, "HOW THE WORLD IS WANTING
[56:14] TO SEE TODAY the real display of
[56:16] Christianity
[56:18] OF REAL HEROISM THAT'S WILLING TO TAKE
[56:22] THE LORD JESUS IN SPITE OF DEATH,
[56:24] CRITICISM, or whatever IT MAY BE, STAND
[56:26] OUT THERE AND BE A SOLDIER OF THE
[56:29] CROSS." HE SAID, "THE WORLD IS WANTING
[56:32] TO SEE IT." AND I SAY, IF THE WORLD'S
[56:34] WANTING TO SEE IT, THEN THEY OUGHT TO BE
[56:36] ABLE TO SEE IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE
[56:38] OUGHT TO LOOK BACK TO DAYS OF PAUL AND
[56:40] TO LOOK BACK TO THE DAYS OF PETER JUST
[56:42] TO LOOK BACK THERE AND SEE THE DAYS OF
[56:44] REAL HEROISM HEROISM AND CHRISTIANITY.
[56:48] BUT WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT RIGHT
[56:49] HERE, RIGHT NOW. IF THE WORLD IS WANTING
[56:52] TO SEE IT, THEN WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO
[56:54] SHOW IT TO THEM.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandon WENT ON TO
[56:58] SAY, HE SAID, "IN THE GOD," HE SAID,
[57:00] "THE GOD ISN'T GOING TO TAKE ONE OVER
[57:03] this way and one over that way and send
[57:05] one east and one other west. He's going
[57:08] to keep you together." He said, "IF
[57:10] WE'LL JUST LET THE HOLY GHOST KEEP US
[57:12] TOGETHER. WE'LL BE ONE." YOU SEE, THE
[57:16] ATTACK OF THE ENEMY, IT'S TO COMPLETELY
[57:18] DIVIDE US. IT'S TO DESTROY US. IT'S
[57:21] TRYING TO GET IN BETWEEN BROTHERHOOD AND
[57:23] SISTERHOOD. BUT IF WE COULD BE ONE, IF
[57:27] WE JUST DON'T LET THE DEVIL PULL YOU OFF
[57:30] on one wrong road, WE'LL BE ONE HEART,
[57:33] one mind, ONE ACCORD BY ONE SPIRIT, THE
[57:36] HOLY SPIRIT, THE GOD OF GOD THAT WILL
[57:38] GUIDE US TO ALL THE TRUTH. THAT'S RIGHT.
[57:41] BUT YOU'VE GOT [screaming] TO FOLLOW
[57:43] YOUR GOD.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WE ARE FACING AN ENEMY THAT
[57:47] WANTS TO COME BETWEEN YOU and between
[57:49] THE PREACHER. WE ARE FACING AN ENEMY
[57:51] THAT WANTS TO COME IN AND DIVIDE THE
[57:54] VERY SPIRIT OF FORGIVENESS, THE VERY
[57:56] SPIRIT OF LOVE, THE VERY SPIRIT OF THE
[57:58] MESSAGE.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; I'LL SAY WHERE IT STARTED AT, WELL, IT'S
[58:02] MANY, MANY YEARS AGO. BUT WHERE HAS
[58:04] RAISED ITS UGLY HEAD WAS IN 2020 WHEN CO
[58:07] CAME IN AND THERE WAS MORE DIVISION IN
[58:09] BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD THAN EVER WAS
[58:12] BEFORE BY ONE DISEASE. BUT I'LL SAY THAT
[58:15] THING WAS OF THE DEVIL. AND THE GREATEST
[58:17] THING TO BREAK UP DIVISION IS THE LOVE
[58:20] OF GOD.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 4:9 says, "Two are better
[58:25] than one, because they have a good
[58:27] reward for their labor. For if they
[58:30] fall, the one will lift up his fellow.
[58:32] But woe TO HIM THAT IS ALONE when he
[58:35] fall. FOR HE HATH NOT ANOTHER to help
[58:37] him up. Again, if two lie together, THEN
[58:41] THEY HAVE HEAT. BUT HOW CAN ONE BE WARM
[58:43] ALONE? And if one prevail AGAINST HIM,
[58:46] TWO SHALL WITHSTAND HIM. AND A
[58:48] THREE-FOLD cord is not QUICKLY BROKEN.
[58:51] SO WE'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE
[58:53] STRONGER TOGETHER. WE ARE MORE RESILIENT
[58:57] TOGETHER. WE ARE BETTER WARRIORS
[58:59] TOGETHER. WE OVERCOME THE ENEMY, HIS
[59:02] ATTACKS BETTER TOGETHER.
[59:05] Can you say amen? I read this statistic
[59:08] many years ago AND I I STUDYING THIS AND
[59:11] I WENT BACK AND FOUND IT. BUT I WAS
[59:13] READING I I HAD READ IT THAT certain
[59:15] Belgian Belgian HORSES OR OR PERSON
[59:18] HORSES THAT ARE DRAFT HORSES, THEY ARE
[59:21] BUILT IN SUCH A WAY to carry a load. AND
[59:24] THOSE PERS ARE BUILT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD
[59:27] 8,000 LBS BY THEMSELVES. AND IT'S
[59:31] AMAZING HOW MUCH power that they have.
[59:33] But when YOU PUT TWO TOGETHER, YOU WOULD
[59:36] THINK THAT EASILY IT WOULD BE 16,000 lbs
[59:39] that they would pull together. But
[59:41] absolutely, it's it's COMPLETELY
[59:43] DIFFERENT THAN YOUR MATHEMATICAL MIND
[59:45] CAN figure out. Because when you put
[59:47] these TWO HORSES TOGETHER, THEY ACTUALLY
[59:50] pull three times their weight, they can
[59:52] pull 24,000 lbs.
[59:56] This is where the word synergy actually
[59:59] comes up. THAT THERE IS 1 + 1 EQUALS
[1:00:03] THREE. THAT ONE force is better with
[1:00:06] another force. BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IF
[1:00:09] THESE DRAFT HORSES ARE TRAINED IN SUCH A
[1:00:12] WAY THAT GOT A MASTER CRAFTSMAN THAT
[1:00:16] KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING AS A HORSEMAN, HE
[1:00:18] STUDIES THEM. HE LOOKS AT THEIR DNA AND
[1:00:21] HE PAIRS THEM WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF
[1:00:23] HORSE OR THE RIGHT KIND OF CHURCH MEMBER
[1:00:26] OR THE RIGHT KIND OF WORSHIPPER. THAT
[1:00:28] HORSEMAN CAN GET OUT OF THOSE TWO HORSES
[1:00:32] NOT 24,000 BUT FOUR TIMES THE POWER THEM
[1:00:36] two horses together CAN PULL 32,000
[1:00:40] POUNDS.
[1:00:42] HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:43] WELL, I SAY IF horses could be TRAINED
[1:00:47] TO PULL THAT KIND OF A POWER
[1:00:50] COME ON SOMEBODY TO BEAR A BROTHER'S
[1:00:52] LOAD TO HELP A SISTER OUT WHEN SHE'S
[1:00:55] FALLEN. THEN I SAY IF ONE WILL PUT A
[1:00:57] FLIGHT A THOUSAND THAN TWO 10 THOUSANDS.
[1:01:01] I SAY THAT WE'RE STRONGER TOGETHER. I
[1:01:04] SAY THIS I SAY THIS THAT YOU'LL NEVER
[1:01:07] REALIZE THE POWER OF BROTHERHOOD.
[1:01:12] [snorts]
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; You see David was powerful by himself
[1:01:15] BUT YOU PUT HIM ALONGSIDE OF JONATHAN
[1:01:18] THEY WERE A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. I
[1:01:20] GOT SOME FRIENDS LIKE THAT. I HAD I
[1:01:23] THOUGHT I HAD FRIENDS LIKE THAT WHEN I
[1:01:24] WAS OUT THERE in the world and we was A
[1:01:26] WRECK. WE WAS SOMEBODY THAT YOU DID NOT
[1:01:28] WANT TO MESS WITH. I AIN'T going to call
[1:01:30] their names. Praise God. Some of them
[1:01:32] sitting here. BUT LET ME SAY THIS. I GOT
[1:01:35] BETTER FRIENDS NOW THAN I EVER HAD MY
[1:01:37] WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. YOU PUT ME WITH
[1:01:40] MICHAEL RAY, TIMOTHY PUIT, MATTHEW
[1:01:42] SPENCER, WILLIAM BORAVON. [screaming]
[1:01:44] HELL DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S MESSING WITH.
[1:01:48] Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU PUT SISTER KATIE
[1:01:51] WITH SISTER TRACY, HELL DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:01:53] IT'S GOT. YOU PUT SISTER GABRIELLE WITH
[1:01:56] SISTER ABIGAIL, HELL DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:01:58] IT'S MESSING WITH. WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE
[1:02:01] STRONGER TOGETHER.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:02:06] praise.
[1:02:13] I believe that too many times we got
[1:02:15] independent Christians on.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; I can do this on my own.
[1:02:20] I'm battling this thing on my own. I'll
[1:02:21] handle this thing on my own. LET ME SAY
[1:02:23] THIS. YOU'LL never realize the power of
[1:02:26] Jonathan and David's covenant THAT THEY
[1:02:28] HAD AS FRIENDSHIP WHILE YOU STAY APART.
[1:02:31] But when they were together, they
[1:02:34] experienced a spiritual strength that
[1:02:37] they never had alone. Let me say it to
[1:02:40] you like this. I'm going to get a little
[1:02:41] bit ahead of myself, BUT THE MIGHTY MEN
[1:02:43] WHEN they joined David, their unity
[1:02:46] turned a fugitive into A KING BECAUSE WE
[1:02:49] ARE BETTER TOGETHER. LET ME SAY IF YOU
[1:02:52] GET UNDER AN ACTS TWO ANOINTING AND YOU
[1:02:54] PUT 120 FOUL 120 ON THE INSIDE OF ONE
[1:02:58] ACCORD, ONE MIND IN ONE PLACE, THEN YOU
[1:03:01] WILL RELEASE THE POWER OF HEAVEN.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Help me Jesus. Brother man
[1:03:09] would talk about Moses. HE TALK ABOUT
[1:03:11] JEREMIAH'S MEN. HE SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT
[1:03:13] TO go out there and be mocked. He said
[1:03:15] they didn't want to go out there and be
[1:03:16] ridiculed. HE SAID, "BUT JEREMIAH," HE
[1:03:19] SAID, JEREMIAH SAID, he said, "Now, if I
[1:03:21] don't say these things, if I don't do
[1:03:23] these things, then it's GOING TO BE LIKE
[1:03:25] FIRE SHUT UP IN MY BONES." HE SAID, GOD
[1:03:28] HAD SO MUCH COMPLETE control over them
[1:03:30] prophets till he WAS THEIR VOICE, THEIR
[1:03:33] ACTION. HALLELUJAH. He said, "GIVE ME A
[1:03:36] CHURCH THAT'S SO COMPLETELY anointed
[1:03:38] with God till every action AND EVERY
[1:03:40] MOVE IS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD." HE SAID,
[1:03:42] "THEY'LL WALK IN THE SHIKINA OF GLORY."
[1:03:44] AND HE SAID, "I'LL SHOW YOU A MESSIAH,
[1:03:47] AN ANOINTED ONE, STANDING upon the
[1:03:49] earth." YOU SEE WHAT THE POWER OF
[1:03:53] PENTECOST WAS? It showed they were there
[1:03:56] in one mind, one accord. They didn't
[1:03:59] HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE
[1:04:01] DIFFERENT MOTIVES. BECAUSE YOU FIND THAT
[1:04:03] WHEN YOU'VE GOT REAL UNITY, you got real
[1:04:06] power. And where you got real unity AND
[1:04:10] AND YOU GOT POWERFUL CREATURES THAT ARE
[1:04:13] built to be the very AMATEURS OF GOD,
[1:04:15] YOU WILL SPEAK things into existence.
[1:04:21] What did Hattie do? She got in the same
[1:04:24] mind.
[1:04:26] Hallelujah.
[1:04:27] Hallelujah. She was just a little bitty
[1:04:29] old woman and had lost a lot of things,
[1:04:33] BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF STUFF, BUT SHE GOT
[1:04:35] IN THE SAME MIND THAT THE PROPHET GOT
[1:04:38] HIT. SHE WASN'T NEEDING SQUIRRELS. COME
[1:04:41] ON, SOMEBODY. SHE DIDN'T NEED A MILLION
[1:04:43] DOLLARS. SHE MAY HAVE WANTED IT, BUT SHE
[1:04:46] DIDN'T NEED IT. BUT WHAT SHE NEEDED,
[1:04:49] SHE GOT IN THE SAME UNITY OF WILLIAM
[1:04:52] BRHAM, AND IT PRODUCED TWO SAVED SONS.
[1:04:56] I SAY IF YOU CAN GET IN THE SAME MIND,
[1:04:59] IN THE SAME SPIRIT, IN THE SAME
[1:05:01] SIMILITUDE AS THE PROPHET, THEN OUR
[1:05:04] PRODALS HAVE GOT TO COME BACK HOME. THEN
[1:05:07] MIRACLES HAVE GOT TO TAKE PLACE.
[1:05:12] The Bible said in 1 Corinthians 12:12,
[1:05:16] for as the body is one and hath many
[1:05:18] members, all the members of that one
[1:05:20] body, being many are one body, soul also
[1:05:23] is Christ. For by one spirit, somebody
[1:05:26] say by one spirit, we are all baptized
[1:05:30] into one body, one body,
[1:05:34] whether we be from grotto or Elton,
[1:05:38] ONE BODY, ONE SPIRIT, WHETHER WE BE JEWS
[1:05:40] or Gentiles, WHETHER WE BE BOND or free,
[1:05:43] AND HAVING BEEN MADE ALL TO DRINK INTO
[1:05:46] ONE SPIRIT. FOR THE BODY IS NOT ONE
[1:05:49] MEMBER, but many. YOU SEE, EVERY SINGLE
[1:05:53] ONE OF US HAVE A ROLE IN THIS BATTLE.
[1:05:56] And I want to say this that only true
[1:05:58] victory will COME WHEN WE FIGHT
[1:06:00] TOGETHER. YOU SEE, IN MANY OF BATTLES,
[1:06:03] IN MANY of battles, there is there there
[1:06:06] might be a general, there's captains,
[1:06:08] THERE'S FOOT SOLDIERS, THERE'S THERE'S
[1:06:10] ARMOR BEARS, THERE'S GOT TO BE A GOOD
[1:06:12] CHEF IN THE MIDST OF IT. BUT THEY ALL
[1:06:14] HAVE ONE PURPOSE. THEY ALL HAVE ONE
[1:06:17] GOAL. IN THE QUEEN OF SHEBA, BROTHER
[1:06:19] BRANDHAM SAID, "IT TAKES MORE than the
[1:06:21] power of gifts. It takes more than
[1:06:23] joining the church. IT TAKES THE BIRTH
[1:06:26] OF THE HOLY SPIRIT TO BREAK DOWN OUR
[1:06:28] WALLS AND TO UNITE US TOGETHER AS ONE
[1:06:31] CHRISTIAN BODY MOVING FOR ONE OBJECTIVE
[1:06:34] AND ONE GOAL. IF YOUR OBJECTIVE DOES NOT
[1:06:37] LINE UP WITH THE MESSAGE, THEN YOU'LL
[1:06:40] NEVER HAVE A SPIRIT OF FELLOWSHIP.
[1:06:44] IF YOUR GOALS DO NOT LINE UP WITH THE
[1:06:47] LORD JESUS CHRIST, YOU CAN BE DOING AS
[1:06:50] MUCH AS YOU WANT TO DO, BUT IF THEY'RE
[1:06:52] NOT LINING UP WITH THE BIBLE, THEN IT'LL
[1:06:55] NEVER COME OUT RIGHT.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR
[1:06:59] WAY AND GOD'S WAY AT THE SAME TIME. YOU
[1:07:02] CAN'T BE WORKING AGAINST US WHEN WE'RE
[1:07:05] TRYING TO WORK FOR YOU.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? WE ALL GOT ONE GOAL.
[1:07:10] THAT'S THE RAPTURE. WE ALL GOT ONE GOAL.
[1:07:13] THAT'S A BODY CHANGE. WE ALL GOT ONE
[1:07:15] GOAL. TO SEE OUR LOST LOVED ONES SAVED.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We said, "Well, I
[1:07:22] don't know whether my part's very big or
[1:07:24] not." You remember when JFK when he was
[1:07:26] walking through NASA for the very first
[1:07:28] time? He's down there in 1960s and he's
[1:07:31] walking through he's walking through
[1:07:32] NASA and there's a man standing over
[1:07:34] there. He's a janitor and he's got a
[1:07:37] broom in his hand and JFK comes up to
[1:07:39] him and says, "Sir, what do you do
[1:07:41] here?" He said, "Sir, I'm helping put a
[1:07:43] man on the moon." YOU SEE, HE REALIZED
[1:07:46] THAT HIS JOB WAS AS IMPORTANT AS THEM
[1:07:49] ASTRONAUTS THAT was getting in the tube.
[1:07:52] You see, the point of it IS NO MATTER
[1:07:54] HOW SMALL,
[1:07:56] NO MATTER HOW BIG, WE GOT ONE MISSION.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Come on, SOMEBODY.
[1:08:06] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:08:08] 1 Corinthians 1 and 10 says, "Now I
[1:08:11] beseech you, brethren, by the name of
[1:08:13] the Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
[1:08:17] speak the same thing, and that there be
[1:08:20] no divisions amongst you, but that ye be
[1:08:24] perfectly joined TOGETHER IN THE SAME
[1:08:27] MIND and in the same judgment."
[1:08:31] You see,
[1:08:33] unity strengthens us
[1:08:37] when we're saying the same thing.
[1:08:42] You got people,
[1:08:44] well, brother Man said people saying,
[1:08:46] you come to question and answer said,
[1:08:48] "You're saying this and you're saying
[1:08:49] that people are saying this." He said,
[1:08:51] "You just say what them tapes say. You
[1:08:54] just stay WITH WHAT THEM TAPES SAY." AND
[1:08:56] I TELL YOU WHAT, I HAVE NEVER BEEN wrong
[1:08:58] in following what them tapes say. I have
[1:09:01] never preached one service OUT OF ORDER
[1:09:03] BY SAYING WHAT THEM TAPES SAY. I HAVE
[1:09:06] NEVER PREACHED THE TALKING MESSAGE AND
[1:09:08] SOMEBODY NOT GET A TOUCH FROM THE HOLY
[1:09:11] GHOST BECAUSE I SAID WHAT THEM TAPES
[1:09:13] SAID. WHEN I PREACH ON THE GODHEAD
[1:09:15] EXPLAIN AND I PREACH WHAT THEM TAPES
[1:09:18] SAY, THEN THERE IS A POWER TO BACK UP.
[1:09:21] WHY? BECAUSE THE MINISTRY HAS BEEN
[1:09:24] BACKED UP BY A VINDICATED PROPHET.
[1:09:29] Blessed be the name of THE LORD. YOU
[1:09:31] STAY WITH WHAT? SAY THE SAME THING. HE
[1:09:34] SAID, I'LL JUST TRANSFER THE WORDS TO
[1:09:37] YOUR MOUTH THAT IT TAKES TO DEFEAT
[1:09:39] SATAN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO come up on with
[1:09:42] it ON YOUR OWN. JOSHUA, JUST SAY WHAT
[1:09:44] MOSES SAID. YOU AIN'T GOT TO COME UP
[1:09:47] WITH A NEW MESSAGE. YOU JUST GOT TO SAY
[1:09:50] WHAT MOSES SAID. POSSESS WHAT MOSES
[1:09:52] TALKED ABOUT. WILLIAM BRANDHAM SAW IT
[1:09:55] AND HE SAW A PEOPLE MARCHING IN STEP. SO
[1:09:58] THERE'S GOT TO BE A PEOPLE THAT COMES
[1:10:00] UNDER THE UNITY OF THE HEADSHIP OF THE
[1:10:03] BODY OF JESUS CHRIST AND COME ANOINT it
[1:10:11] and the message I will restore.
[1:10:14] He said Pentecost has got a disease.
[1:10:17] He said it's got a lot of fungus growing
[1:10:18] on it. That's right. and all of our
[1:10:21] churches got a fungus growing on it.
[1:10:26] He said, "We've let the old palmer comes
[1:10:30] with his stinger and break down
[1:10:32] brotherhood and break down immunity
[1:10:34] amongst us." Paul said in the Bible that
[1:10:38] he wanted us all to speak the same
[1:10:40] thing. He wanted us all to be in unity.
[1:10:49] Now, if
[1:10:51] it wasn't a very serious thing, then why
[1:10:54] would the prophet preach about it?
[1:10:57] So, evidently showing us that Satan is
[1:11:01] trying to come in to break the
[1:11:03] brotherhood. So, a prophet is giving us
[1:11:07] marching orders [snorts] as soldiers of
[1:11:09] the cross to don't pull no punches, TO
[1:11:13] STAY RIGHT with the word. YOU LOOK OUT
[1:11:15] THERE TODAY, THIS PAST WEEK, when you
[1:11:18] watch what the Catholic CHURCH AND THE
[1:11:20] PROTESTANT CHURCH IS ALIGNING themselves
[1:11:23] to be one, TO WORSHIP ONE GOD, HAVE ONE
[1:11:27] MONEY, have one exchange,
[1:11:30] they are uniting themselves together.
[1:11:34] HALLELUJAH. BUT BEFORE THERE WAS A WORLD
[1:11:37] COUNCIL OF CHURCHES, BEFORE THE
[1:11:39] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, HE UNITED ME
[1:11:42] WITH HIM. BEFORE SATAN'S DIRTY HANDS
[1:11:46] COULD EVER GET A HOLD OF ME, GOD PLACED
[1:11:48] ME IN AN ARMY TO BREAK THE VERY SPIRIT
[1:11:52] of division.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; We're on the same team.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; You remember when brother man was
[1:11:58] standing there and he's standing right
[1:12:00] there in the midst of Pentecostal
[1:12:02] people. He's standing there in the midst
[1:12:04] of Presbyterians and the Church of
[1:12:06] Christ and the Church of GOD AND THIS
[1:12:09] THAT and the other denomination. And
[1:12:11] he's standing right there. HE SAID, "IF
[1:12:13] YOU GOT A man out there that's running
[1:12:15] with the football," he said, "Don't take
[1:12:17] the ball out of his hand just because he
[1:12:20] doesn't belong to your church."
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS A PROPHET TRYING TO DO? HE WAS
[1:12:26] TRYING TO DRAW THEM BACK TO THE OPENING
[1:12:28] OF THE WORD. But because THE GIFT OF A
[1:12:32] PROPHET MESSENGER WASN'T IN THEIR
[1:12:34] CHURCH, IN THEIR DENOMINATION, IN THEIR
[1:12:37] MESSAGE CHURCH, THEY GOT UPSET AND TRIED
[1:12:40] TO TAKE THE BALL OUT OF THE
[1:12:42] QUARTERBACK'S HAND.
[1:12:45] He said, "Don't do that. Guard for it."
[1:12:48] Well, you say, "WHO IS A FOOTBALL'S hand
[1:12:50] in, brother? It's in the hand of the
[1:12:52] HOLY GHOST. STOP TRYING TO TAKE IT OUT
[1:12:55] OF THE HAND OF THE HOLY GHOST. STOP IT.
[1:12:58] JUST GET RIGHT BEHIND [screaming] IT.
[1:13:01] PUSH. KNOCK DOWN SOMEBODY. I DON'T CARE
[1:13:03] IF YOU GOT TO CHOP BLOCK SOMEBODY. I
[1:13:05] DON'T CARE IF YOU GOT TO RUN UP BEHIND
[1:13:06] THEM AND CLIP THEM. JUST GET THEM OUT OF
[1:13:08] THE WAY SO WE CAN SCORE.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what, that was one of my
[1:13:19] favorite things to do in football is to
[1:13:21] catch somebody not looking. Cuz I wasn't
[1:13:24] a big guy. I was not like my brother
[1:13:27] over here. But boy, I was I was full of
[1:13:30] it. Full of energy, full of nonsense.
[1:13:36] So if I REALLY WANTED TO H HIT SOMEBODY
[1:13:38] AND KNOCK THEM DOWN, I had to wait for
[1:13:40] the right moment. You see, Matt's that
[1:13:42] kind of guy, he could just barrel
[1:13:43] through about three or four people, but
[1:13:45] it takes me to catch that guy out there
[1:13:47] waiting alone.
[1:13:50] You know, he's got his helmet on, but
[1:13:52] don't know which way he's standing.
[1:13:54] And then all of a sudden you some
[1:13:56] redheaded dude comes up and cold
[1:13:58] him right from the side. That's what I
[1:14:00] love to do to the enemy
[1:14:02] is when he don't see me coming.
[1:14:06] Do you realize who you're uniting
[1:14:08] yourself to?
[1:14:11] Do you really realize who you're uniting
[1:14:13] yourself to?
[1:14:15] If I could paint it to you like this.
[1:14:18] You're uniting yourself to a crazy man.
[1:14:23] You realize what you're doing when
[1:14:26] you're getting ready to leave your home,
[1:14:27] leave everything, your reputation as a
[1:14:30] man, as a farmer, as a worker. You're
[1:14:34] getting ready to unite yourself with a
[1:14:36] crazy man. You're getting ready to unite
[1:14:39] yourself with a man that has has been
[1:14:43] kicked out of his own kingdom.
[1:14:47] Men don't want him because he's so
[1:14:49] spiritual. men don't want him because
[1:14:51] he's too powerful. So he goes over there
[1:14:53] and he starts hanging out with Akish and
[1:14:56] he starts hanging out with him and Akish
[1:14:58] has got respect for David. But these men
[1:15:01] come in there and they look at him.
[1:15:03] These are real warriors. And they look
[1:15:05] on David and they ask the question, "Is
[1:15:07] this not David
[1:15:09] that slay Goliath that destroyed
[1:15:11] Philistines? What is he doing here with
[1:15:14] us?" YOU KNOW WHAT DAVID DID? DAVID GOT
[1:15:18] DOWN AND STARTED ACTING. THE BIBLE SAID
[1:15:20] THAT DAVID CHANGED HIS BEHAVIOR AND
[1:15:22] STARTED ACTING LIKE A CRAZY MAN. STARTED
[1:15:25] DROOLING FROM HIS BEARD. HE STARTED
[1:15:27] CRAWLING AND SCRATCHING AND STARTED
[1:15:29] PAINTING THINGS WITH HIS FINGER.
[1:15:31] SCIENCE. HALLELUJAH. HISTORIANS SAID
[1:15:33] THAT HE WAS DRAWING A CROSS WHEN HE DID
[1:15:35] IT. I SAY IF YOU DON'T REALIZE WHAT
[1:15:38] YOU'RE DOING, YOU'RE DRAWING YOURSELF TO
[1:15:40] A CRAZY MAN. DAVID DID THAT SO THAT HE
[1:15:44] COULD ESCAPE THE ENEMY.
[1:15:46] WHY DID HE DO THAT? TO GET to you.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; THIS DAVID, OUR KING DAVID, ACTED LIKE A
[1:15:56] CRAZY MAN WHEN HE COULD HAVE HAD THE
[1:15:59] ENTIRE WORLD. WHEN HE NEVER HAD TO DIE,
[1:16:03] he acted
[1:16:05] like a thief and he hung on a cross
[1:16:11] for you.
[1:16:13] YOU GOT TO BE CRAZY to follow a guy LIKE
[1:16:15] THAT. YOU GOT TO BE CRAZY TO FOLLOW A
[1:16:18] MAN THAT'LL DIE ON A CROSS THAT'LL BE
[1:16:21] NUMBERED WITH HIS ACCUSERS.
[1:16:27] HALLELUJAH. Brother man, I'm saying now
[1:16:30] a soldier has got to learn the sounds of
[1:16:32] his bugle or the trumpet. He doesn't
[1:16:35] know if the trumpet blows or whether
[1:16:37] charge or whether retreat if he doesn't
[1:16:39] know the difference. What kind of a
[1:16:41] mixed armed army would you have? THE
[1:16:43] ENEMY WOULD CERTAINLY TRIUMPH OVER A
[1:16:46] BUNCH OF SOLDIERS THAT WERE NO BETTER
[1:16:48] TRAINED THAN THAT. HE SAID, "WE GOT TO
[1:16:50] BE UNITED. WE'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT THE
[1:16:52] TRUMPET is saying then, which is the
[1:16:55] trumpet, THE GOSPEL TRUMPET." THAT'S THE
[1:16:57] WORD OF the living God IS A TRUMPET. HE
[1:17:00] SAID, "DON'T MIX NOTHING WITH IT." Let
[1:17:03] me say this. I have found out about this
[1:17:06] King James version
[1:17:08] that it will whip the devil anytime, any
[1:17:12] place. No matter what kind of pressure
[1:17:14] that you put it in, no matter what devil
[1:17:16] you kind of put it in, no matter if you
[1:17:18] put it up against a SUICIDE DEVIL, A
[1:17:20] DEPRESSION DEVIL, a a a lust devil, THIS
[1:17:24] BIBLE HAS the ability to destroy every
[1:17:27] weapon
[1:17:29] that Satan could ever throw against us.
[1:17:33] YOU REMEMBER THE PROPHET? HE ALWAYS
[1:17:34] LIKED TO GO OUT there hunting and he had
[1:17:36] that one dog named Fritz. You remember
[1:17:39] the story? He said, "Now Fritz would go
[1:17:41] after anything. He would go after
[1:17:42] anything." He said, "Except for a skunk.
[1:17:44] He'd just stand out there and BARK AT
[1:17:46] HIM." HE SAID, "BUT IF I told him, sick
[1:17:48] him, Fritz," HE SAID, "HE'D GO RIGHT IN
[1:17:50] THERE AFTER THAT OLD SKUNK." HE SAID,
[1:17:52] "NOW THE PROPHET SAID, THE BIGGEST
[1:17:54] STINKER THAT I KNOW OF IS THE DEVIL. AND
[1:17:57] WHEN YOU START SAYING AMEN, IT'LL SEND
[1:18:00] THE WORD RIGHT TO THAT STINKING DEVIL
[1:18:02] AND IT DESTROY. AND IF WE'RE EVER GOING
[1:18:05] TO DEFEAT OUR ENEMIES, THEN WE'VE GOT TO
[1:18:07] REMAIN STEADFAST ON THIS WORD. SO YOU
[1:18:10] GOT TO SAY, SEEK HIM BROTHER, SEEK HIM,
[1:18:13] BROTHER ANDREW, PREACH THE WORD, LIVE
[1:18:15] THE WORD, SOLDIERS OF THE CROSS, SAY
[1:18:19] AMEN.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now you listen, soldiers of
[1:18:25] the cross." He said, "When you
[1:18:27] disbelieve one word OF GOD'S WRITTEN
[1:18:29] BIBLE, YOU are disarmed. You're
[1:18:32] disarmed. You surrender, you jellyfish.
[1:18:35] Put on the whole armor of God. WE'RE IN
[1:18:38] A BATTLE. WHAT GOD SAID IS TRUE. EVERY
[1:18:40] MAN'S word is a lie. But as soon as you
[1:18:43] get you listen to one thing," he said,
[1:18:46] "That's his tactic. He's got you
[1:18:48] disarmed. He said, "How many things did
[1:18:51] Eve have to listen to?" One,
[1:18:56] one thing, and it disarmed her.
[1:18:59] Well, I don't know if Brother Random was
[1:19:01] just talking about his opinion or if he
[1:19:03] really had, thus sayith the Lord, on
[1:19:04] that. He said it swept right through in
[1:19:07] her mind
[1:19:09] and right into her spirit. And there she
[1:19:13] was perverted.
[1:19:15] there. It was before the act ever took
[1:19:18] place. Let me say this. Before you ever
[1:19:22] commit the sin, you've already done it
[1:19:25] in your heart.
[1:19:28] All you have to do is stay right behind
[1:19:31] it. Now, you can imagine as David is on
[1:19:35] the inside of this king, this cave.
[1:19:39] You ever been into a cave?
[1:19:42] real dark that [clears throat] real damp
[1:19:44] air
[1:19:46] and you just make the smallest move and
[1:19:49] you can hear it all the way in the very
[1:19:50] back end of that cave.
[1:19:53] You imagine these narrow passageways
[1:19:57] as David enters in and he comes into
[1:20:00] this cave
[1:20:03] and he's there.
[1:20:05] Remember why David is there? It's
[1:20:07] because Saul is hunting for him.
[1:20:10] Saul was wanting to kill him. If it
[1:20:12] hadn't been for Jonathan, David wouldn't
[1:20:14] even be in the picture because Jonathan
[1:20:18] was a good friend and he saw that
[1:20:21] somebody was trying to kill his
[1:20:22] anointing. So, he went OVER THERE AND
[1:20:25] STOPPED HIS FATHER AND SAID, "YOU CAN'T
[1:20:27] DO THAT. THAT MAN'S ANOINTED." NOW,
[1:20:31] David is on the inside of this limestone
[1:20:33] cave. He's got no army. HE'S GOT NO
[1:20:36] FAMILY. HE'S GOT NO SECURITY. HE'S GOT
[1:20:39] NO POWER. HE'S GOT NO LOYAL SUPPORT. HE
[1:20:41] AIN'T GOT A HOME.
[1:20:44] AND THESE MEN, THEY COME TO HIM. They
[1:20:47] find the king IN DESPAIR. THEY FIND THE
[1:20:51] KING, A FUGITIVE IN HIS OWN KINGDOM. A
[1:20:55] MAN THAT IS ANOINTED TO BE THE KING OVER
[1:20:58] ISRAEL AND JUDAH. HE'S HIDING IN A CAVE.
[1:21:01] AND IN DENS, THEY FIND HIM AS A RENEGADE
[1:21:05] HIDING IN A CAVE. But let me say this.
[1:21:08] When you're in a CAVE WITH DAVID, THE
[1:21:11] supernatural is going to happen. When
[1:21:14] you're in a cave with King Jesus, THE
[1:21:16] SUPERNATURAL'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE
[1:21:19] DAVID TAKES THIS BAND OF MISFITS AND HE
[1:21:22] MAKES THEM IN TO THE GREATEST WARRIORS
[1:21:25] THAT HAS EVER KNOWN THROUGHOUT
[1:21:27] SCRIPTURES. YOU MIGHT FIND ME IN A CAVE,
[1:21:30] BUT WHEN I COME OUT OF THIS CAVE,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; I MIGHT BE A MISFIT ON THE OUTSIDE. I
[1:21:36] MIGHT BE DISTRESSED. ON THE OUTSIDE, I
[1:21:39] MIGHT BE A DEBTOR. ON THE OUTSIDE, I
[1:21:42] MIGHT BE DISCONTENT ON THE OUTSIDE.
[1:21:45] BUT ON THE INSIDE,
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CAVE, LET ME SAY
[1:21:51] IT LIKE THIS. THE KINGDOM IS ESTABLISHED
[1:21:55] ON THE INSIDE.
[1:21:58] ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CAVE, DAVID TAKES
[1:22:01] A man
[1:22:04] and makes him a warrior.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; You see, if he can ever get you in a
[1:22:09] cave,
[1:22:12] it amazes me.
[1:22:19] Forgive me. It amazes me in the world
[1:22:22] that we live in
[1:22:24] that we literally
[1:22:28] are raising
[1:22:30] a bunch of scared sheep
[1:22:35] trying to protect our children from this
[1:22:36] that or the other. Literally pull them
[1:22:39] away when things get too tense, when
[1:22:43] things get too tight and when things get
[1:22:46] unnormal,
[1:22:48] when things get too loud and when things
[1:22:51] get too frightening, we begin to pull
[1:22:53] them back.
[1:22:55] But if you could ever realize there's
[1:22:56] power in those moments.
[1:23:04] I'm sorry.
[1:23:07] I got about the worst headache you can
[1:23:08] ever imagine.
[1:23:10] But we try to shelter and keep our
[1:23:13] children from the greatest abilities and
[1:23:16] the greatest moments.
[1:23:18] You see,
[1:23:21] I realize that sitting right here,
[1:23:25] if we pull them out, then the world will
[1:23:29] only have darkness.
[1:23:34] If we pull them out of everything that's
[1:23:36] hard, they'll never have be able have
[1:23:38] the ability to overcome in their own
[1:23:41] self. You see, if we do all the
[1:23:43] overcoming for them, then they'll never
[1:23:46] be able to overcome when they turn 18
[1:23:48] years old.
[1:23:50] Now,
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING THUMB OUT THERE TO THE
[1:23:52] WOLVES, BUT I'M SAYING THAT THEY NEED TO
[1:23:54] KNOW WHAT KIND OF ENEMY THAT WE GOT OUT
[1:23:56] THERE. THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THE DEVIL
[1:23:59] IS A LIAR, THAT HE'S A ROARING LION
[1:24:01] SEEKING WHOM HE MAY DEVOUR. AND I'M
[1:24:04] AFRAID that too many parents are raising
[1:24:06] a bunch of wimps.
[1:24:08] I'm going to preach. I MIGHT GET KICKED
[1:24:10] OUT OR KICKED OFF OF YOUTUBE, BUT I
[1:24:12] BELIEVE THAT TOO MANY TIMES THAT WE ARE
[1:24:14] RAISING A BUNCH OF WIMPS THAT TELL
[1:24:17] PEOPLE THAT OUR CHILDREN CANNOT LIVE
[1:24:19] THIS MESSAGE.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Let me say, IF YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW
[1:24:24] DAVID, YOU GOT TO GET ON THE INSIDE OF
[1:24:26] THE CAVE.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. I DON'T CARE IF YOU
[1:24:30] LOOKED APART ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. IF
[1:24:33] YOU DON'T LOOK THE PART LIKE YOU LIKE ON
[1:24:37] THE INSIDE OF THIS CAVE, YOU BETTER LOOK
[1:24:39] THE SAME WAY ON THE OUTSIDE.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; BROTHERS, BROTHERS, YOU BETTER STOP
[1:24:45] WEARING THEM SHORTS AND BEING A PART OF
[1:24:47] THE BSS SOCIETY.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SISTERS. THEN YOU BETTER START
[1:24:52] DRESSING RIGHT, PREACHING RIGHT, LIVING
[1:24:55] RIGHT.
[1:24:57] IF DAVID IS REALLY ON THE INSIDE, THEN
[1:25:01] DAVID WILL BE ON THE OUTSIDE.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; WELL, everybody else plays their video
[1:25:11] games. Let me tell you, if you want to
[1:25:14] teach your kids how to kill,
[1:25:16] there's a better way to do it than
[1:25:18] showing them some video game.
[1:25:21] Let me tell you, the greatest
[1:25:23] Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] I I'll tell you what, brother Ron, you
[1:25:26] better clean this up tomorrow. But you
[1:25:28] young boys, YOU YOUNG BOYS, YOU EVER
[1:25:30] WANT TO BE A part of some of the
[1:25:31] greatest killings, grab a hold of this
[1:25:33] word right here.
[1:25:36] What's What's some of them What's some
[1:25:38] of them games? Is it Fortnite? And I
[1:25:40] don't I think that's a game. They kill
[1:25:43] people in there. I got them What do they
[1:25:45] call it? Call of Duty. You know, we we
[1:25:47] got a COOD, too.
[1:25:50] Conduct, order, and doctrine. We got our
[1:25:53] own cood book.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. YOU WANT TO RE HEAR
[1:25:59] ABOUT SOME REAL KILLINGS? Let's flip
[1:26:02] over to 1st Samuel 17. Let's pull over
[1:26:04] there to 1st Samuel 18. LET'S HEAR HOW
[1:26:07] HOW DAVID HOW DAVID SO WANTED THAT
[1:26:10] GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN UP THERE IN THE
[1:26:11] KINGDOM THAT HE WENT OUT THERE AND TOOK
[1:26:13] THE FORES OFF OF THEM OFF OF them
[1:26:15] Philistines up there. If you want to
[1:26:17] HEAR ABOUT SOME KILLINGS, THEN THINK
[1:26:19] ABOUT THINK ABOUT ALL THAT SHAMGAR DID.
[1:26:22] THINK ABOUT ALL THAT SAMSON DID.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; MAN, NAH, I don't read that in my Bible.
[1:26:28] That's because you ain't got a hold of
[1:26:29] the King James version.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; I tell you what our kids are feeding too
[1:26:34] much on. It's King James, LeBron, AND
[1:26:37] THEY NEED TO BE FEEDING ON KING JAMES
[1:26:39] RIGHT HERE.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; You want to be a warrior, then get in
[1:26:47] the cave. Come on, somebody. If you want
[1:26:50] to BE A WARRIOR, GET IN THIS CAVE WITH
[1:26:52] KING DAVID. Let me tell you, WHEN YOU
[1:26:54] GET ON THE INSIDE OF THIS KING, on the
[1:26:57] INSIDE OF THIS CAVE WITH KING DAVID,
[1:26:59] YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW he killed
[1:27:01] Goliath. He's going to teach you the
[1:27:03] secret weapons. He's going to TAKE YOU
[1:27:05] THROUGH CHRIST, THE MYSTERY OF GOD
[1:27:07] REVEALED. HE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH HE WILL
[1:27:09] TAKE YOU THROUGH THE ATUNEMENT. He will
[1:27:11] take YOU THROUGH THE RAPTURE. HE WILL
[1:27:13] TEACH YOU LEADERSHIP. HALLELUJAH. HE
[1:27:15] WILL TEACH YOU WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN
[1:27:17] PERFECT COMMUNION.
[1:27:20] If you can get on the inside of the cave
[1:27:24] with David,
[1:27:27] what happened to David?
[1:27:30] What happened to these men that they
[1:27:34] would unite to him over this cause?
[1:27:37] They had so watched his life, Brother
[1:27:39] Duck. They had been so acquainted with
[1:27:42] him
[1:27:45] that they recognized
[1:27:47] that God was using and giving him
[1:27:50] authority and leadership. They had
[1:27:54] watched that David had so much trusted
[1:27:56] God.
[1:27:59] He had trusted him in the good moments.
[1:28:01] He trusted him in the bad moments. and
[1:28:04] his integrity towards the word of God
[1:28:07] actually drew
[1:28:09] this band of misfits to him.
[1:28:13] I wonder why did Jesus wait till he was
[1:28:18] 30 years old to call Peter, Matthew,
[1:28:22] James, John?
[1:28:25] It's because he had to allow them to get
[1:28:27] to a position that he could pull them.
[1:28:30] Because there's got to be certain spots
[1:28:32] in your life where you literally are
[1:28:36] willing to go to a cave.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; How many's in debt here? Everybody can
[1:28:43] raise their hand. How many is discontent
[1:28:45] with Leosa? You can raise your hand.
[1:28:48] Literally, how many people are
[1:28:49] distressed? We could all raise our hand.
[1:28:52] Well, you are in the same position
[1:28:55] that these men were in. Brother Brandham
[1:28:58] said in why little Bethlehem. He said,
[1:29:00] "Rise you SONS AND WARRIORS." LET'S CUT
[1:29:02] BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL BETHLEHEM. Remember
[1:29:04] when David come to his throne, THESE MEN
[1:29:07] STOOD BEHIND HIM because he knowed or
[1:29:09] they knowed he was coming to the throne.
[1:29:11] And they know that David was going to be
[1:29:14] on the throne. NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE WAS
[1:29:17] REJECTED OUT, he was the worst
[1:29:20] fugitive in the land.
[1:29:24] Do you realize who you're uniting
[1:29:27] yourself to?
[1:29:30] Do you really want to be identified with
[1:29:33] the worst fugitive in all the land?
[1:29:38] Am I painting this picture okay for you?
[1:29:41] He's the worst. The king, THE
[1:29:44] POLITICIANS DON'T WANT him
[1:29:48] in the land. He was the worst fugitive
[1:29:51] in the land. And so is the true word of
[1:29:55] God this morning. He said it's foreign
[1:29:57] to all organizations. But when THE WORLD
[1:30:00] DON'T WANT HIM, WHEN THE WORLD DON'T
[1:30:02] WANT OUR DAVID, WHEN THE WORLD DON'T
[1:30:04] WANT OUR KING, THERE ARE SOME BATTLE
[1:30:06] FORGE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE WILLING TO
[1:30:09] DRAW THE SWORD AND DRAW THEIREL
[1:30:13] DAVID. THE PROPHET SAID, GALLANT MAN
[1:30:15] holding to David because they know he
[1:30:18] was coming in power. They know no matter
[1:30:20] what anybody ELSE SAID, GOD HAD ANOINTED
[1:30:22] on David and they knowed it and they
[1:30:24] were Gentiles. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY
[1:30:27] TURNED HIM OUT, THEY KNOWED THAT HE WAS
[1:30:29] COMING to power. And one day there, he
[1:30:32] said, "What?" HE SAID, "IT'S A TYPE."
[1:30:34] AND WHAT IS A TYPO? IS IT TODAY? IT'S
[1:30:36] CHRIST A FUGITIVE. YOU SAY, "CHRIST, A
[1:30:40] FUGITIVE?" He said, "According to the
[1:30:42] Bible," he said, "we just took it
[1:30:43] through the seven church ages." He said,
[1:30:45] "This leysian c church,
[1:30:49] this leodyian church Christ WAS A
[1:30:51] FUGITIVE OUTSIDE of his church,
[1:30:54] REJECTED, TRYING TO GET BACK in again.
[1:31:01] He was a fugitive
[1:31:03] to his own church. And the reason he's a
[1:31:06] fugitive, it's because
[1:31:09] he's a word and they
[1:31:13] won't let him in.
[1:31:17] So where does that place you?
[1:31:20] I'm on the inside of the cave.
[1:31:24] Come on, somebody. You can shout with me
[1:31:26] right there. Where's that place you at?
[1:31:29] If they don't want him, but you got him.
[1:31:33] Are you hearing what I'm saying? Are you
[1:31:35] are you are YOU GETTING WHAT I'M PUTTING
[1:31:36] DOWN? Let me say this to you. If you got
[1:31:40] him on the inside of the cave and they
[1:31:43] kicked him out, hallelujah. That dog
[1:31:46] right there a hunt. IF YOU GOT HIM ON
[1:31:48] THE INSIDE OF YOU, THEN THERE AIN'T NO
[1:31:50] DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN ROB YOU AWAY FROM
[1:31:52] IT. THERE'S NO DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN
[1:31:54] STEAL YOUR JOY. THERE'S NO DEVIL IN HELL
[1:31:56] THAT CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FROM KINGDOM
[1:31:58] POWER AS LONG AS YOU GOT KING DAVID.
[1:32:03] I [screaming] LOVE WHAT DAVID DID TO
[1:32:05] THESE MEN. HE DID EXACTLY WHAT ROMANS
[1:32:08] 12:12 SAYS. BE YE NOT CONFORMED TO THIS
[1:32:11] WORLD, BUT BE YE TRANSFORMED BY THE
[1:32:13] RENEWING OF YOUR MIND. HE LITERALLY
[1:32:16] TRANSFORMED THEM FROM MISFITS TO MIGHTY
[1:32:19] GENTILE WARRIORS.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; THESE MEN WERE NOT INITIALLY WARRIORS.
[1:32:25] THEY WERE SOCIALLY OUTCASTS. THEY WERE
[1:32:28] DEBTORS. But he made them a captain.
[1:32:31] THEY WERE DISCONTENT, BUT HE MADE
[1:32:33] CONTENT IN THE PROMISES. THEY WERE
[1:32:35] DISTRESSED, BUT HE GAVE THEM PEACE LIKE
[1:32:37] A RIVER.
[1:32:45] The Bible said in 1 Corinthians or
[1:32:47] Chronicles 11
[1:32:52] 12 and 8, it said that the Gadites
[1:32:58] separated themselves
[1:33:01] to David.
[1:33:04] They did this
[1:33:06] for David. They pulled themselves away
[1:33:09] from worldly lust and worldly pleasures
[1:33:12] for David.
[1:33:15] And there's a lot of times we sing that
[1:33:16] song, Nearer my God, to thee.
[1:33:21] But the nearer we can get to Christ, the
[1:33:23] further we should be away from the
[1:33:24] world.
[1:33:28] Let me say this, these men left their
[1:33:30] homes. When you read the scripture so
[1:33:32] many times, you read over it and you
[1:33:34] just read over it like they were some
[1:33:35] supernatural beings, but they were real
[1:33:37] men. Had real passion, had real wives
[1:33:41] back home, children that they loved.
[1:33:43] They left their comfort. They left their
[1:33:46] safety. They left their reputation to
[1:33:49] get David
[1:33:52] because there's something about this
[1:33:54] guy.
[1:33:55] There's something special about him.
[1:33:58] I don't know what it is, but I'm just
[1:34:01] I'm drawn to it.
[1:34:03] These men would literally leave their
[1:34:06] homes for months to fight alongside of a
[1:34:10] guy that is hiding in a cave.
[1:34:16] You imagine when you start reading this
[1:34:20] and you start seeing these men. These
[1:34:23] are men maybe not of great stature
[1:34:27] but there's one that I I absolutely love
[1:34:30] the story of Banana. It's only a few
[1:34:32] scriptures wrote about Banana but Baniah
[1:34:35] man I'd like to met him. I believe I'm
[1:34:39] going to one day. He was a guy that
[1:34:41] didn't mind being considered with the
[1:34:44] top three in the message.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; He wasn't considered with Shama and
[1:34:50] Adino, the son of a dodo. I love what
[1:34:52] brother Tom Ray said. How would you like
[1:34:54] to been named that son of a dodo? He
[1:34:57] said, only dodo I know is a bird. Doddo
[1:34:59] bird.
[1:35:02] And he elabart
[1:35:06] as long as he's apart.
[1:35:09] AND BANIAH WENT DOWN THERE AND THE BIBLE
[1:35:11] said that he went down there and
[1:35:12] destroyed two men that were lionlike.
[1:35:16] And we read over that. You imagine these
[1:35:19] men were as fierce as a lion.
[1:35:24] Science says when you study a line,
[1:35:27] there is nothing as close to a line like
[1:35:29] a man in his nature because he wants to
[1:35:33] destroy. He wants to get his goal. You
[1:35:36] see, there's something powerful about a
[1:35:39] lion. You see, a lion doesn't just want
[1:35:42] to kill. A lion enjoys chasing.
[1:35:47] A lion loves to hunt you down. And
[1:35:51] Baniah was the guy. These are two
[1:35:55] warriors from their youth, and he's
[1:35:57] hunting them down. Now, I love I love a
[1:36:01] good hunt. I'll just be real honest with
[1:36:02] you. I ain't had too much good success,
[1:36:04] but I sure do enjoy a good hunt. But,
[1:36:08] you know, it ain't all about the killing
[1:36:11] that I enjoy. I enjoy the I I enjoy the
[1:36:14] strategy behind it. I enjoy everything
[1:36:17] that is a part of it. And Baniah was
[1:36:20] this kind of a hunter. And he was
[1:36:22] looking for two lionlike men. And he got
[1:36:25] a hold of them. It said that THE BIBLE
[1:36:28] SAID THAT he destroyed a great Egyptian
[1:36:31] THAT WAS A MIGHTY WARRIOR. THE BIBLE
[1:36:34] SAYS THAT HE WAS FIVE CUBITS HIGH. He
[1:36:37] was 7 foot 6 in. And he went down there.
[1:36:41] I love the picture that the Bible
[1:36:42] pictures TO US THAT BANIAH WENT DOWN
[1:36:45] THERE, grabbed his sword, and flipped
[1:36:47] his spear around and killed him right
[1:36:49] there. BANIAH WENT DOWN INTO A pit one
[1:36:52] day because there WAS HALLELUJAH. HE GOT
[1:36:55] DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF THIS PIT AND this
[1:36:57] leopard WENT ON THERE. IT WAS GOING ON A
[1:36:59] RAMPAGE AND IT WAS DESTROYING PEOPLE'S
[1:37:01] HOMES. BUT BANIAH WAS A HUNTER. SO
[1:37:05] BANAYIAH WENT AFTER THAT LEOPARD AND HE
[1:37:07] KILLED THAT LEOPARD IN THE MIDDLE OF A
[1:37:09] SNOWSTORM.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; BANIAH WAS A WARRIOR BEFORE HE GOT IN
[1:37:15] THE CAVE.
[1:37:17] BUT WHEN HE GOT ON THE INSIDE OF A CAVE
[1:37:20] WITH KING DAVID, THEN DAVID MADE HIM HIS
[1:37:23] PERSONAL BODYGUARD.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Jerry,
[1:37:31] I know you're a warrior, but before
[1:37:35] before you got the Holy Ghost, you was a
[1:37:37] warrior. But you can imagine after you
[1:37:41] got the token and David says, "No more
[1:37:45] out there, but you're gonna stand right
[1:37:46] here." David's saying, "I'm not going to
[1:37:49] fight my battles." Jerry is.
[1:37:56] I'm not going to fight my battles. Tom
[1:37:59] is.
[1:38:02] You done some mighty work out there, but
[1:38:04] now you're gonna be my personal
[1:38:06] assistant. When I need you to whoop a
[1:38:09] good devil, let me say it like this.
[1:38:12] When somebody when God needs somebody to
[1:38:14] beat down depression, he sends a little
[1:38:18] bitty old woman that's a mother. Maybe
[1:38:20] she has fought this thing all of her
[1:38:23] life and it has surrounded her family.
[1:38:26] So God says, "You know what? I left some
[1:38:28] work for my children to do. So, I'M
[1:38:31] GOING TO ALLOW MY LITTLE LADY DOWN there
[1:38:35] in Elton to be able to whoop THAT THING.
[1:38:38] NO, I'M not going to do it myself, but
[1:38:40] she's going to use what I gave her. I
[1:38:42] SHOWED HER HOW to defeat. I SHOWED HER
[1:38:45] HOW to destroy. MATTER OF FACT, SHE'S MY
[1:38:48] PERSONAL BODYGUARD, and I know that I
[1:38:51] got confidence in her. She'll get the
[1:38:53] job done. Now, let me say this. I'm a
[1:38:55] real fighter, but you really don't want
[1:38:57] to mess with my wife. I'm a good shot,
[1:39:00] but you really don't want to mess with
[1:39:01] my wife because I may ask you some
[1:39:03] questions before I shoot you, BUT MY
[1:39:05] WIFE WILL SHOOT YOU AS QUICK as a as a
[1:39:08] hammer gets called back.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHAT KIND OF POWER TO GIVE TO
[1:39:14] CERTAIN PEOPLE.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; SO, HE GAVE THE HOLY GHOST TO PEOPLE
[1:39:20] THAT KNEW HOW TO PULL THE TRIGGER
[1:39:22] INSTEAD OF PETTING AN OLD DEVIL. SAY,
[1:39:24] YOU KNOW WHAT? IT AIN'T TIME TO TALK. IT
[1:39:27] AIN'T TIME TO ASK QUESTIONS. BOOM.
[1:39:30] BOOM. BOOM.
[1:39:37] How's it like to be the personal
[1:39:40] bodyguard to David? Well, I tell you
[1:39:44] what. I was sent on an assignment one
[1:39:47] day and you know, nobody else would
[1:39:50] stand,
[1:39:52] but I was going to stand. And these
[1:39:55] Philistines were coming in, but this was
[1:39:57] my piece of property.
[1:40:01] And the Bible said that everybody ran
[1:40:03] away but Shama,
[1:40:06] which means the Lord is present. Shama
[1:40:09] didn't run. SHAMA WAS PRESENT. AND SHAMA
[1:40:12] STOOD RIGHT THERE AND DESTROYED THOSE
[1:40:15] Philistines from taking his spiritual
[1:40:18] food in DUE SEASON. IT IS SAID ABOUT ONE
[1:40:22] OF THE THREE MIGHTY THAT HE BEAT SO MANY
[1:40:24] THAT THE THAT THE SWORD ACTUALLY FROZE
[1:40:27] IN HIS HAND. THAT ONE MAN WENT DOWN INTO
[1:40:30] A PIT AND KILLED A LION, SLAYED 800.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because they saw something on the
[1:40:41] inside of David.
[1:40:44] And it was through the battle that they
[1:40:46] literally
[1:40:48] began to be a bond.
[1:40:51] Let me say it like this.
[1:40:53] You ever been in a fight?
[1:40:57] I hope you haven't been to many fights,
[1:40:59] but I know that some of you have.
[1:41:03] But when you are in a fight or a
[1:41:06] spiritual fight, you will never forget
[1:41:09] who takes up for you.
[1:41:12] You will never forget who pulls a sword
[1:41:14] for you. There is no loyalty like the
[1:41:18] loyalty in battle. And there was a bond
[1:41:21] that was built between this band of
[1:41:23] brethren. Now, there's more than 30, but
[1:41:26] there's 30 mighty men. And there's three
[1:41:28] select, but there was over 400 men that
[1:41:31] came to this cave.
[1:41:33] I was I was talking to brother Michael
[1:41:35] Ray, and he he told me this. He said, 'I
[1:41:37] was actually doing some study on the
[1:41:39] recruitment numbers of the US Army and
[1:41:42] how they're higher and they actually
[1:41:44] beat their own targets. He said, and
[1:41:46] many people wonder at why. He said it's
[1:41:49] because they see a cause to fight for.
[1:41:52] He said, man crave strong leadership and
[1:41:55] all run to support a cause. He said
[1:41:58] these men will come from all walks of
[1:42:00] life to join together in passion to hold
[1:42:03] up a flag. A bond is created unlike any
[1:42:06] other. THERE IS NO BOND LIKE the bond OF
[1:42:09] BATTLE. LET ME SAY THIS to you. You
[1:42:12] think about the men that have been
[1:42:14] united here. I think about just our own
[1:42:17] personal church. And I'm not just
[1:42:19] talking about our church. There's many.
[1:42:20] But let me just say it like this. You
[1:42:22] think about the men that have surrounded
[1:42:24] Brother, men like brother William, men
[1:42:26] like brother Matt, men like brother
[1:42:28] Alden, men like brother Vernon, men like
[1:42:29] brother VJ, men like myself. What is it?
[1:42:32] There is something there. We are united
[1:42:35] under our headship. And if you if you
[1:42:37] don't go here and you go somewhere, YOU
[1:42:39] OUGHT TO FEEL THE SAME WAY THAT I FEEL
[1:42:41] ABOUT my pastor. You ought to feel the
[1:42:43] same way. And we are in one battle. AND
[1:42:46] WE GOT ONE GIANT. AND WE GOT ONE KILLER.
[1:42:49] WE GOT ONE SLOO. WE'VE GOT ONE ENEMY
[1:42:53] THAT IS AGAINST US. But we got one stone
[1:42:55] that is sure to work. AND IF YOU WILL
[1:42:58] APPLY THAT STONE IN FAITH, THEN GOD WILL
[1:43:01] GET A HOLD OF THAT STONE. HE WILL UNIFY
[1:43:04] YOUR FAITH WITH MY FAITH AND IT'LL get
[1:43:07] to going A 100 MILLION MILES AN HOUR AND
[1:43:09] STRIKE THE ENEMY AT ITS RIGHT SPOT. THE
[1:43:13] BIBLE SAID, "WHATSOEVER IS BORN OF GOD
[1:43:16] overcometh the world, and this IS A
[1:43:19] VICTORY THAT overcometh the world, even
[1:43:23] our faith." Faith is not soft.
[1:43:27] Faith ain't passive.
[1:43:30] Faith fights.
[1:43:34] And the scripture said that whosoever is
[1:43:36] born of God, no matter what the
[1:43:39] opposition is, overcomes.
[1:43:43] I want to read this to you as I'm
[1:43:44] getting ready to close. Don't pack your
[1:43:46] bags yet. I still got some shout
[1:43:49] material here for you.
[1:43:52] Let the pressure down.
[1:43:54] Praise God. We're about to get out here.
[1:43:59] Don't tell me. I know. I've sat through
[1:44:02] some services myself.
[1:44:08] Y'all ain't got nothing to complain
[1:44:09] about here.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; If you do, there's the door.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; when the prime minister of Israel,
[1:44:25] Benjamin Netanyahu,
[1:44:28] he he came and he spoke in our nation's
[1:44:30] capital just just last year, I believe
[1:44:32] it was. He stood there in October the
[1:44:35] 7th and he began to tell some stories
[1:44:37] about some soldiers who lived this word
[1:44:40] overcome.
[1:44:42] I want you to realize this ain't
[1:44:45] something that you read about in the
[1:44:46] Bible. This is present day. These are
[1:44:49] real men in real battles with real
[1:44:51] wounds that got real courage. He starts
[1:44:54] telling a story about a man, a soldier.
[1:44:57] He had no car, had no ride, had no
[1:44:59] transportation. And when the attack be
[1:45:01] to break out, he ran eight miles just to
[1:45:04] be in the front line just to defend his
[1:45:06] land. No excuses, no hesitation, but he
[1:45:10] overcame everything that was in his way.
[1:45:13] NETANYAHU SAID NOW AND HE POINTS out and
[1:45:16] he has a man set up. He said there's a
[1:45:18] soldier who lost his arm. He said
[1:45:20] another this soldier threw himself on a
[1:45:23] grenade to save his entire company. He
[1:45:26] lost his arm in THE EXPLOSION. HE SAID
[1:45:29] NOW MOST MEN WOULD RETIRE AND most men
[1:45:32] would never return to the battlefield.
[1:45:34] BUT HE WENT RIGHT BACK TO THE
[1:45:36] BATTLEFIELD AND THIS TIME HE WENT BACK A
[1:45:39] COMMANDER. HE WAS WOUNDED, BUT HE WAS
[1:45:42] NOT DEFEATED. HE WAS HIT, BUT HE WAS NOT
[1:45:45] BROKEN. HE OVERCAME.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; HE POINTED OUT AND HAD ANOTHER MAN STAND
[1:45:52] UP ON CRUTCHES. If you ain't seen it,
[1:45:54] it's powerful. He said, "This man right
[1:45:57] here, this soldier right here, HE LOST
[1:46:00] HIS LEG IN the middle of a battle." He
[1:46:02] said, "MOST OF THEM WOULD FALL BACK.
[1:46:04] MOST OF THEM WOULD QUIT, BUT HE KEPT ON
[1:46:07] FIGHTING." NETANYAHU SAID, "THESE MEN
[1:46:10] ARE UNBOWED, UNADORNED, UNDONEED, AND
[1:46:13] UNAFRAID.
[1:46:15] WHATSOEVER IS BORN OF GOD OVERCOMETH THE
[1:46:18] WORLD." NOT BECAUSE WE'RE STRONG, NOT
[1:46:22] BECAUSE WE NEVER BEEN WOUNDED, NOT
[1:46:24] BECAUSE WE NEVER BEEN A BATTLE, NOT
[1:46:26] BECAUSE A BATTLE IS EASY, but because we
[1:46:28] met God in a cave.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Whether I can feel him or not, I'll
[1:46:34] fight for him. Whether I see him or not,
[1:46:37] I'll fight for him. Whether I whether I
[1:46:40] can ever feel his anointing again, I
[1:46:42] I'll forever preach this message is
[1:46:44] right
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; and I'll back up what he's got to say.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; I'm closing. The musicians can come.
[1:46:58] That's what real overcoming looks like.
[1:47:04] I was in
[1:47:06] I was in uh New Zealand with brother
[1:47:07] David Sour.
[1:47:09] We sitting down for lunch one day. I
[1:47:12] took the morning services and he took
[1:47:14] the evening services.
[1:47:16] We sitting down having some lunch.
[1:47:19] I believe we was actually having lamb
[1:47:20] that day. This is funny
[1:47:23] because we're sitting there and we're
[1:47:25] just kind of talking and I never been to
[1:47:27] South Africa, but brother brother David
[1:47:29] had been there, many others. And there's
[1:47:31] a brother by the name of Brian Jones and
[1:47:32] he's actually he's actually you can see
[1:47:35] him on YouTube and different things.
[1:47:36] He's actually very he he he get united
[1:47:39] with these animals and talk to these
[1:47:40] animals and these animals can talk back
[1:47:42] to him and he actually he can bring them
[1:47:44] apart to be a part of his his own their
[1:47:46] pride and tribe and different things. He
[1:47:48] he's got a his own basically compound
[1:47:51] where these animals are like a zoo that
[1:47:52] he lives in and these monkeys coming in
[1:47:54] and out of his house and different
[1:47:55] things and all these animals and
[1:47:57] different things. He he lives with them.
[1:47:59] I'll never forget this. And brother
[1:48:00] David got to talking about he said there
[1:48:02] was this one line that brother Brian
[1:48:05] had. His name was Big Boy. If I don't
[1:48:08] tell this story right, I believe I I I
[1:48:10] believe I got it just right because I'll
[1:48:12] never forget this moment. Brother David
[1:48:14] said he said he said he had this line
[1:48:16] named Big Boy and he said, "Now, Brother
[1:48:18] David, he said he said he accepts me as
[1:48:21] one of his pride." He said he thinks I'm
[1:48:24] part of him. He said, "Now you go down
[1:48:26] there." And he said, 'You stand right
[1:48:28] here, right in front of right in front
[1:48:30] of this cage where big boy's at.
[1:48:33] And he said, 'Now all of his females are
[1:48:36] sitting over here in this corner. And he
[1:48:38] said, "Big boy's there." He said, all of
[1:48:40] a sudden, Brother Brian says, "He's all
[1:48:42] the way up on the hill." He said, "Big
[1:48:44] boy."
[1:48:47] And big boy was in there.
[1:48:50] [snorts]
[1:48:52] He said every fiber of that lion's body
[1:48:56] was breathing. He said his muscles and
[1:48:58] everything. He said, "Big boy,
[1:49:03] big boy," [screaming]
[1:49:07] he said. And before long, he let out the
[1:49:10] biggest roar you could ever imagine. He
[1:49:12] said, "But when he did, his female
[1:49:14] started backing him up over here." He
[1:49:17] said, he went, "Whoa!" I'll never forget
[1:49:20] it, Brother David. The spirit of God got
[1:49:21] on brother David. He said his female was
[1:49:24] backing him up. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH.
[1:49:28] HIS FEMALE WAS BACKING HIM UP. CAN YOU
[1:49:30] IMAGINE WHEN THE LINE OF THE TRIBE OF
[1:49:33] JUDAH
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN HIS WIFE STARTS BACKING UP WHAT
[1:49:37] HE'S GOT TO SAY? IT AIN'T JUST HIS WORD.
[1:49:40] IT'S MY WORD. [cheering]
[1:49:42] BIG BOY.
[1:49:44] BIG BOY. Big boy.
[1:49:48] LET OUT A ROAR.
[1:49:50] I AM THE LORD THY GOD THAT HEALTH ALL OF
[1:49:54] THY DISEASES.
[1:49:57] HE IS THE LORD MIGHTY IN BATTLE.
[1:50:01] THE LORD IS MY LIGHT AND MY SALVATION.
[1:50:04] WHOM SHALL I FEAR AND WHOM SHALL I BE
[1:50:07] AFRAID?
[1:50:09] Big boy.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Get that devil. Seek him. Seek him.
[1:50:19] ARE YOU WILLING TO BACK UP THE LINE OF
[1:50:21] THE TRIBE OF JUDAH?
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet said. I'm going
[1:50:26] straight off inspiration right now. I
[1:50:28] love what the prophet said. He said,
[1:50:30] "You don't have to fear. GOD DOESN'T
[1:50:31] CALL NOBODY THAT'S THAT don't have
[1:50:33] bravery on the inside of their heart."
[1:50:35] He said, "You are kin to the line of the
[1:50:38] tribe of Judah.
[1:50:40] You are kin TO THE LINE. THERE'S A LION
[1:50:43] SHUT UP ON THE INSIDE OF MY BONES.
[1:50:46] and a lion wants to hunt. And if we got
[1:50:49] A LION OUT THERE TRYING TO KILL our
[1:50:51] young people and kill our anointing,
[1:50:54] then let's anoint.
[1:50:56] Let's come together. Let's unite.
[1:51:01] I'll never forget how brother David
[1:51:03] described it. You could almost feel the
[1:51:05] lion's breath. You know, you ever been
[1:51:07] in a story and somebody's [music] got
[1:51:08] you right there? You're right in the
[1:51:10] moment.
[1:51:12] I could almost feel the lion's breath
[1:51:14] when brother David was talking about it.
[1:51:17] I can feel it right now.
[1:51:20] It's on you. The Holy Ghost is on you.
[1:51:24] The anointing is here. [music]
[1:51:28] Why are you here? WHY DID YOU COME TO
[1:51:30] THIS CHURCH? WHY DID YOU come to this
[1:51:33] cave? Why?
[1:51:35] Cuz there's a line set up on the inside
[1:51:37] of you.
[1:51:39] You may not know it. You might be a
[1:51:41] misfit. You might be a Solomon on the
[1:51:44] inside of Uriah.
[1:51:47] [music]
[1:51:50] Hallelujah.
[1:51:52] But you're going to come. You may not
[1:51:55] realize IT, URIAH, BUT YOUR DADDY WENT
[1:51:58] TO A cave
[1:52:01] so that you could give your life.
[1:52:05] Uriah. Uriah
[1:52:07] went to this cave.
[1:52:10] Solomon, do you realize what David did?
[1:52:17] Oh my
[1:52:21] Uriah.
[1:52:22] Brother Brandham said, "The very first
[1:52:24] man I meet in heaven," [music] he said,
[1:52:26] "I want it to be Uriah."
[1:52:31] Why were these men drawn to him?
[1:52:36] Uriah was so loyal.
[1:52:40] He would not leave the king's side.
[1:52:45] He would not leave the king's side.
[1:52:49] And David was getting ready to do
[1:52:50] something.
[1:52:54] But it shows something about the power
[1:52:57] of going being on the inside of a
[1:52:59] [music] cave.
[1:53:01] You see, Uriah had to do that so [music]
[1:53:06] Solomon could come forth.
[1:53:09] Why are you here? Why did you come TO
[1:53:12] THIS MOMENT? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING at
[1:53:14] limestone and entering through a cave?
[1:53:16] Cuz there's an angel that'll meet you in
[1:53:18] a cave.
[1:53:20] God bless you. Hallelujah. I'd say
[1:53:23] whatever you have need of right now, the
[1:53:25] Holy Spirit's here to minister to your
[1:53:26] heart. He's here to touch you.
[1:53:31] Oh, [music] overcomer.
[1:53:35] I'm an [singing] overcomer
[1:53:40] by the [music and singing] blood of the
[1:53:42] lamb.

[1:53:47] of my test,
[1:53:51] overcomer. [music and singing]
[1:53:53] Oh, I'm an overcomer.

[1:54:26] and he set [singing] me free.
[1:54:30] And ever since I've been changed,

[1:55:23] of my testimony,

[1:55:34] He rescued me.
[1:55:38] [music] He delivered me
[1:55:43] when he set [music and singing] me free.
[1:55:48] And ever since I [music]
