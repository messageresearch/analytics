don't want to forget it I want to do it last night and hey things happen your head's going in a different direction but if I tell you you'll come to me and then it'll come to me so the Lord spoke to me something this week while I was in prayer and so think you'll like it amen Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 amen amen amen Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 I'd like to speak again this morning and on every knee shall bow and take that another step and then we'll we'll come back to it probably over and over but amen I the we are in a transition of Kingdoms and uh we know what side that we're

just about get finished you know it's kind of like running a marathon don't quit on the the last lap we're going to make this thing and so you may have take a deep breath but we're going to make this thing and so always remember serving God's not a Sprint it's a marathon and so amen God bless you God bless you Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus I love this that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God God the Father amen you may be seated today may God bless the reading of his word amen turn to your neighbor say it's good to be in church Amen brother brandham was in prayer for his father and I'll just I want to read this so I don't miss any important parts he said and something said unto me rise up and I I raised up and went walking and I went back into a field behind me and an old broom Sage field I've actually stood in that place and there standing not over 10 feet from me stood a man white garment on a little fella had his arms folded like this a beard kind of short hair down to the shoulders and and he was looking sideways from me like that peaceful looking figure but I couldn't understand it how his feet one just behind the other and the wind blowing his robe moving Sage blowing and I thought now now wait a minute and I bit myself and I said now I'm not asleep and I pulled down and pulled a little piece of of that Sage off you know and got it like a toothpick in it put it in my out mouth and I look back and I look toward the house and I said no I was in there praying for Dad and and something said to me to come out here and and here stands this man and I said I thought that looks like the Lord Jesus I thought I I wonder if it is and he was looking just exactly directly towards where our house sits now so I moved around this way to see if I could see him and and and I I could see the side of his face like like that and I had to turn away turn around and look this way to see him and and I said never moved him and I thought I believe I'll call him and I said Jesus and when he did he looked around like that and that's was all I remember he just reached out his arms and there's not an artist in the world could paint his picture the characters of his face the best I've ever seen is that Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 I've got it on the on all of the literature and everything that I use that's because that looks like like it or pretty near or as close as it could be he looked like a man and if he'd speak the world would come to an end and yet with so much love and kindness till you I I just pitched over and at daylight I found myself just at the break of a day my pajama shirt soaking wet with the tears and when I came to myself walking back through the BR Sage Brush field home I think about that every one of us has had some sort of a sitting here today have had some sort of a moment with the Lord maybe you didn't see him quite like that but he came to you maybe at your house or maybe in your car maybe sitting in church and all of a sudden this book became real personal to you now as long as you know it as a history book it's just stories but when the author of the book comes real to you and then you know that you know that you know that you know oh I like that don't you someone sent this to me this week and and I'm just going to quote it the best that I can there was a lady that she was a Christian woman she was making a journey and she was flying across one of the oceans heading toward Australia New Zealand area and they got into a storm and the storm was raging it was shaking that that plane so and it felt like the wings were getting ready to come off and everybody was screaming and screaming and screaming the they the even the airplane pilot asked them said ould you pray I've never been in anything like this' the lady sitting beside of this woman she was screaming with all of her heart and uh so this lady being a Christian she just went to prayer she prayed for peace to come in the storm then she prayed for that that that plane those people would settle down and come to peace you know peace in your storm and she prayed and she continued to pray and there just something hit that plane quietness begin to come into that cabin and people begin to hundreds of them begin to settle down storms still raging and she had one of those old old cameras to wear that you had to get your film developed and and she she put her camera right against the right against the window maybe you've done that before put her right against the window she wanted to capture the rain or the lightning as it was flashing and shaking those wings and and she took took a picture she would go home the plain would land she would go to a developer and and as the the week would go on the man that was doing the developing he said I I'd like for you to come and I'd like to talk to you about the picture that you took she said I don't want to talk about it on the plane but I'd like for you to I'd like for you to see what I have found she didn't know you know she was thinking lightning or she was thinking rain or the the plain's wings shaking and he said first of all before I show you this I was an atheist my family was my family was not Believers but when we saw this picture we have all give our heart to Jesus the picture was of a man from here down in a robe with his arm stretched out like this and he was standing in her storm not just her storm but everybody on the plane I want you to understand you may not ever get a picture like that you may never feel it but when that man saw it he immediately became a Christian I want to tell this to you he's not your lord until you make him your lord he's not your God until you make him your God you remember this the The Ten Commandments says have no other gods before me I don't want to make any graven images I don't want you to be an idolor listen God's not asking for he's not asking for second or third place in your life he wants to be first place he wants that total priority he wants to to be first in your life let me just say this to you as a young person if you make him first and I want to talk to you if you make him first he will take care of the entire rest of your life he'll help you in your schooling he'll help you in your education he'll help you in finding a mate he'll help you in your business he'll help you on your job I want you to understand once you walk into the hands of Jesus you'll never be alone I say that as simple as I know how to say it but I say it as profound as I know how to say it he's God he made the whole world he he is interested in your situations of your life aren't you glad of that tonight God of this evil age brother BR I'm going to give you a couple of quotes it says it's strange now after some 1900 years of gospel preaching and now she that is the world system is more evil than in the days when that even when he was here the world system is more evil the world is headed to a great climax he's saying this 50 some years ago the world is headed to a great climax I believe we're just right there you know that the Lord is fulfilling his word on every hand just a few paragraphs later he says the world is headed to a climax the spirit of lawlessness lawlessness and moral Decay and scientific religion has led it to a cage of every hateful and unclean bird as the Bible said let's read it Revelations chapter 18 just while we're getting to this point he said Revelations 18 1:5 he said after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice now you people that that had the dreams and saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is Fallen has become a habitation of devils and and a hold of every every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and and hateful bird for all nations have drank the wine of the wrath of her fornication amen and the kings of the Earth have committed fornications with her and the merchants of the Earth was wax Rich through the abundance of her delicacy and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her come out of her I'm glad we heard this voice come out of her my people that you be not a partaker of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sin has reached into the heavens and God remembers her iniquity what a warning that throws the church exactly back to Revelations 3 and14 the layot to see an age lawlessness we're seeing it we're seeing it def find the police on listen they don't want strong preaching they don't want really clean television the moral Decay has come to a spot they don't even want a government that is clean and moral are you with me now listen this is not our home don't get satisfied here don't get comfortable here oh we want America to come back to her Revival she had her chance Russia had her chance Nations had their chance but they chose another way how could America being a nation of that we could be so proud of her her Godly generals her Godly president's fault or where she did is because she rejected the message of the hour let me just let me just speak a couple of things here what would have happened if the message would have been received what would have happened if the message had been received we'd have peace amen instead of our our ships being bombed today just happening bomb today in the Red Sea our our ships American ships and commercial ships are being bombed by the enemy right now as we speak we're just just so close to the Rapture and these things must be right but had they received the message but they they turned it down they didn't want a part of it oh they had a chance he stood in the he stood in Washington in the great Halls of Washington with with vice presidents sitting there men of great dignitaries and they saw the gift deep calleth to the Deep you'll know it by its by its title there they had an opportunity at the work they had an opportunity at the word brother Branda warned of where the spirits were coming from where the Beatles were coming from where Elvis Presley was taken Pat Boon where music was leading America he warned them at women getting the right to vote are you with me now they would vote in the a boy president the the suffrage movement that had happened for for hundreds and hundreds of years one day would begin to get its rights America doesn't want want a real Bible we're full we're we're Full Gospel people that that's because we believe in the Full Gospel but she's naked forgive me he said leay out to see an age law I had a thought I wanted to go there you take these precious police officers we've got serle here you take them out of our cities and these and if you really get down to it these people that are calling for police officers to not be funded they're rich enough to have their own guards cuz even they know I'm not going to go far with that they know this world is in a horrible condition they know that well we live in Harrisonburg have you read the news we live in Gros have you read the news uh you know that's happening in other cities no it's it's where you're at and it's because this is not our home and I want to spend eternity with you and with your children we were we were headed off the hill one day and brother and sister seab Breezers had stopped I believe it was maybe your first or second time here here and they had stopped I never knew who they were I I I I was just getting ready to pass by and Connie was driving and and as she's driving by I said stop I got to go back Spirit of the Lord spoke to me and said they're children of God lord they're not just visitors they're children of God never shook their hands and never talked to them personally ever but God witnessed I like it that God can witness to us that we're more than just family here we're more than just a group of people you're just not an accident walking in this building but we have been gathered we have been gathered by the great Garner himself pulled us together now we are rich and have need of nothing notice now God says knowest not that thou art naked miserable and blind and know it not I don't know if you've listened to that sermon lately or knoweth it not but it's one of the most powerful sermons that there is perfectly with the scripture of the age not the scrip of the age of Daniel not the ones of the age of of Noah but this last age this evil age I'm glad that God sent us a message that's specifically for our time so if he's a king he's got to have a people right now I want you to understand that and I don't mean to say this irreverently but in this world our Supreme Court is supposed to be the final author Authority or even our president can sign executive orders and it seems like that's the final Authority but just as soon as a new Administration comes as soon as a new ex he just acting like you as soon as a new Administration comes he will he will go and change all the rules of the man before right so Biden has did his best to change all of Trump's rules and so the next Administration will come and try to change all of Biden's rules but we're in a [Applause] kingdom God never has a new thought are you with me now he set this up in the beginning in his mind before there was a sun and moon and stars and if you were with him then you'll always be with him I love that don't you so in the Scriptures it says he swore by himself when he could swear by no greater right men swear by the greater Authority but God couldn't swear by a greater Authority because he was the greater Authority so he swore by himself and he wrote a covenant with the families of the earth God will not break his Covenant I want to say this to you it may feel like time has been lengthened out but it's exactly on time now the scripture says that Abraham looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God now there's a reason that he did that brother B said he would look east west north and south but what he should have done was look up I like that don't you because MDC was not from here he had no father he had no mother so he was not from here he was from there and when he came he he he blew himself a body and he stepped into it and he came and he he said but brother honor are you guys stretching that just a bit oh no cuz it had results that's right and it's it's pertinent to this age because he's visited this age so he blew himself a and he stepped in and he walked down the road and now if he was walking on the same road you wouldn't recognize him but Abraham had had fellowship with him and he had been told several different covenants so when when MDC comes into his gate Abraham calls him Lord but when the two angels meet with lot lot called them Lords but Abraham being a Son of God God had changed his name but he had heard the voice that was coming out of that bodyl so they prepare meat they prepare milk and he sits and you hear Brother Ram say he said he shooted the Flies off of him and they talk a little bit and you know they talk and remember he's got a covenant with him that he's going to have seed through Sarah and then he not only talks to Abraham but he talks to his wife and when he's talking to his wife he's got a reminder the promise is not just for Abraham but it's for her now God's not going to leave her in that that body that she couldn't believe leave for a baby to come through but he asked her a question Sarah is there anything too hard for God to do right now I want to ask you this this morning you're sitting in a in a message church and sometimes the enemy Whispers In Your Ear how long we've been believing this all these years and sometimes it just is a fable to you or maybe it's just old those guys get up and preach those kind of sermons over and over and don't you get tired of hearing those same sermons over and over well let's just talk about that just for a moment can you imagine being in Noah's day 120 years same sermon if you would have sit in the tent of Abraham and he's getting older and more decrepit and his age has begin to deteriorate on him and no doubt he was getting humiliated in his own flesh but he's got the same sermon I spoke to God and he's going to give me a son and maybe after a while you'd get tired of hearing Abraham looking the way he did and and maybe acting the way he did but he's got the same sermon I've been preaching the same message since I was redheaded my shoulders were strong and I could run and I could I could preach for for an hour or two and and I didn't wear out but now 40 minutes is almost too much for me but it's still the truth it's still the truth and the God that was my keeper as a boy that's been through all of the storms of my life he's still with us today I'm still as enthused about the Rapture as I've ever been hallelujah hallelujah there's nothing I want to say it there's nothing impossible to God one night you'll look in your in your miror I don't have them so I'm just got to mimic it here and you'll pull them out and you'll put them in that glass last time you calb your hair before you go to bed you know and it's gray and it's turning loose and for me with the Kimbo it's getting more wavy and more King here but I'm just glad I got it but one morning I'll get up and everything that I believed since I was a child and preached for 40 years I'll get up with a renewed step I'll look at these hands that don't have cancer spots on them anymore I'll look at them hands and they'll be pure I'll feel strength on the inside of me like a holy ghost strength down inside of me my shoulders will be pulled back and I walk in and blondies the Blondie that I walk down the aisle with I said in the kitchen the other morning and you know not feeling just what I ought to feel and I just started singing as long as I'm alive I'm going to be singing as long as I'm alive I'm going to be shouting there one thing that I know deep down in my soul as long as I'm alive now I want you to understand they might not want to do it now they may not want to bow to our lord Jesus but there's coming a time there's coming a time there's coming coming a time yes sir it's called our Millennium period he's going to be king on the earth King Jesus Son of Man Son of God priest he's going to be king the great part of that is you're you're going to be reigning with him as his wife a thousand years on this this Earth walking on the ashes of the wicked and from that time a transition will take place and people will be given longevity of Life they'll come in and out of that holy city now I'm not talking about the new world to come but that's going to be happening as well but but let me just say this you our God is going to bring peace to this earth a thousand years of rain my daddy would make make a statement over and over again if it was just about that without eternity it'd be worth serving God but that's only the beginning at the end of that Thousand Years Satan will rais his head up and deceive the whole world can you imagine that Humanity at the end of a thousand years of living in perfect peace perfect peace God will kind of allow the enemy to be loosed and he'll deceive the whole world that's why you have so much battle because the enemy that battles you has deceived the whole world Psalms 72 and verse 11 yay all Kings shall fall down before him am all Kings shall bow down before him all nations Shall Serve him Proverbs 8 verse1 15 and 16 by me Kings reign and princes decreed Justice listen God allows men to rise and fall listen God's in control of it all he allows men to rise and he allows men to fall by me princes rules and Nobles even the Jud all the judges of the earth Daniel 2 verse 47 and the King answered unto Daniel and said of a truth it is that your God is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of Secrets talking about a man speaking truth the king answered and said Daniel of a truth it is that your God Daniel's God my God say my God right there my God is a god of gods a lord of Kings a revealer of Secrets seeing that thou could us reveal this secret Revelation 17 and verse1 14 thee shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them amen I like being on the right end end of the war the shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is read it with me Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called Chosen and [Music] faithful let's read that scripture again before we leave that sister Stephanie these shall make a war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords and the king of kings and they that are with him are called chosen let's read that last sentence again and they that are with are called Chosen and faithful tell your wife tell your neighbor tell the friend he's talking about me Teddy he's talking about you and they that are with him are chosen and faithful let's read it again it's too good to leave there and they that are with him are chose are called are chosen Give the Lord a great big hand right there 11 and verse 15 of Revelations and the seventh angel shouted and and they were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ read this next words with me and he shall reign forever and ever read it again and he shall reign forever andever and not after 3 years seven years they're going to have an election no politics there and he shall reign forever and ever 21 and and 24 and the nations of them which are called are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into him Colossians chapter 1 and verse 15 who is the image of the invisible God the first born of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him thank that means all things were created for you thank you thank you don't just read him in the picture you're part of him and he is before all things and and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in in all things he might have preeminence notice those words in all things he might have the preeminence amen for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell so he's the God of Peace because he's the king of peace and he and you said well brother Ron how's he going to do it he became the king of peace in your heart when you were at war in your heart he became the king of peace in your heart peace to the worst storms peace to the worst wars he is King he is a king of of righteousness yes he's watching over everything brother Ron but nobody knows me here really Biden will never know my name Donald Trump Trump you can name them all never know my name but this King this King knows he knows how to say Ron run and you know his voice and just a and listen you can be in the worst war of your life that is going on from week to week in your home seem like what happened here your job what happened here and in just a moment in just a moment he can change it [Music] all how do you know that let me give you an example three Hebrew children refuse to bend or to Bow even to the image of their Prophet Daniel they wouldn't bow to the prophet that's why brother brandom didn't want you to worship him right he didn't when he was on Earth don't do it now we're not to worship a man are you with me we're born of sin and shaping in iniquity that's why God took he took human flesh and took a redeemable man to speak the message through and even even in the scriptures said the man wanted the angel wanted to Bow and worship me and said see thou doeth it not I'm of thy fellow servants the prophet amen God don't want no man that's it brother Homer always had a statement I thought it was good he said people get around me long enough they won't worship me for you that know you know for you that don't know or you just got an idea no man is is to be your Lord You're to constantly keep your eyes on Jesus you'll never be disappointed in Jesus now he becomes the king of your heart that blood cell you become literally a relative to him now in an inheritance in an inheritance uh You've Got to Be Blood relative for for for my children to to get my inheritance it's got to be by Blood now should I live to 150 years old not going to happen but should I live to 150 years old and and the man that's over top of the wheel he will have to go back and find there may be 300 people in that well we're talking about a an explosion of humanity aren't we but 300 people in the wheel and so the man that's watching over the watching over the wheel not the Proctor but what's that man the executive of the will it's his responsibility I'm going to go to a point here it's good looking sale you got this week so he I'm not going to talk to you about yourself but he is to make sure it's his total responsibility to make sure that you have a right to be a partaker in the will are you with me you have a right to be a partaker in the whe so you have to be blood relative of Ron Spencer not married into the family you got to be blood relative of Ron Spencer that's why this message is so important it didn't come to get the whole world but it was finding the blood relatives the blood relatives of our Lord Jesus Christ that ought to make you want to shout there just for a few minutes now you know I know I know some things are in life are difficult so I'm not going to get finished and I'm getting kind of weak here but you mind if I grab a chair you mind if I grab a chair because I want to finish maybe we'll set the chair out front let's do that is that okay I want to finish and so yeah maybe I'll finish from here and so you know in the Scriptures it talks about it talks about a man named Joseph and so Joseph was you know nowhere could he find that you know I'm portraying Jesus Christ I mean he didn't get a certified letter that's saying now Joseph you're going to portray Jesus Christ and he could be a part of this sermon every knee shall bow so I'm not way off here so Joseph as a little boy he is born of the woman of Jacob that he wanted to have and you know Leah has four sons and the other wives had Sons but but of of Jacob Rachel was the woman that he loved when he first saw her he loved her and you know you know he was willing to work seven years to get her and then when he was deceived D he had to work seven more years to get her couldn't have children by her and and the other girls made fun of her but finally he has two sons by her and one is Joseph and and and one is Benjamin don't take it for granted that Israel's leader is named Benjamin nitan yahu brother what a place to put him in history so we're going to get done quick here so Joseph you know he gets a special coat listen when you're in a big family and all of a sudden you're one of [Laughter] 12 it just seems like maybe this one boy we're all his sons but he seems to be getting a lot of favoritism we're working in the fields and he's staying around home you know Joseph is is that favorite so when he he develops a coat and it's got all this special coloring in it he gives that coat to Joseph yeah that cause trouble in church and so and so then Joseph starts having dreams there wasn't a book come along with don't tell these dreams CU people will get upset so Joseph starts telling his dreams and one of his dreams was that there would be sheaves in the field and they would all bow to him sheaves were his brothers oh yeah that worked out real well all of us are going to bend down and worship you not a chance now you know now the feelings in the church was real difficult are you with me now just stay with me they're all family here and now now Joseph is telling the Dream well now he tells the Ultimate Dream the sun and the moon are going to bow that many his mother and father were going to Bow Down and Worship Him hey it works real good with the brothers until now Jacob was going you know huh I'm going to bow to you but the dreams were saying every knee now Joseph didn't have to go into the fields and work with the sheep and he stayed around the house but Jacob said w't you go check on your brothers listen they hated him by now these dreams coming and I'm not going to go deep into into it but here's his guy being spiritual we're all Daddy's Sons we're blood relatives how does he think that we're going to worship him so they make a plan we'll get rid of him we'll get rid of this Jesus and so they get him and one of the brothers says no no no no we can't kill him we we can't do that we're not going to we're not going to shed shed innocent blood he's our brother so they begin to make plans someone to kill him but one of the brothers said no no no no no but what they did is they took his took him and throwed him in a pit and then a little softness hit their heart here come some Traders through and they sold him for pieces of silver because that was going to be a type of Judas selling him for silver he didn't know he was going to pay play the part of Jesus being sold out so now he finds himself in Egypt thinking I'll never see my brothers again I'll never see my mom and dad again I'll never see Benjamin again well he's still not just Jacob's son but he's God's son now just because you're going to have to go through some difficulties that don't mean God left you are just just because you're going through cancer don't mean that God's Not Your healer or he's not watching over you or he'll give you strength so he it gets sold to a man that's quite a rich man and he's quite well reowned in the political system there and he brings him in and he can count he's super smart and now he becomes a a man in business right there in the home and that man's business becomes super successful even to the point till he gives him authority over everything but now his wife wants to destroy the plan he refuses to file himself and so he runs and gets out of his coat and so she makes up a lie on him Joseph finds himself further away from the Visions but closer listen God's not taking you further away he's taking you closer so he finds himself in prison prison is not a good place he finds himself in a horrible condition but now he's there and Seema he's forgotten but now he finds himself with a butler and a Baker he gains confidence with them they have a dream and he interprets their dream one man's going to be lifted the other man's going to die soon as you get out of prison one's going to be restored the other man's going to die and did it not it happen and remember what Joseph said remember me remember me when you get out but it seems like he's forgotten listen one day in prison is too long two days in prison too long years in prison listen he's there for a while listen he could remember the dreams but I seem to be further away and now Pharaoh has a dream and all of his men and all of his soothsayers and all of his goddesses and Prophets can't reveal it and the memory comes back to one of these men that he's been in prison with and he said I met a man in prison exactly took place I'd be raised and and this other guy would be destroyed it happened exactly right yeah everything he said was exactly right bring me the man and they bring him the man and he tells Pharaoh his exact vision of what it was going to go on there's going to be famine there's going to be seven years of of riches and seven years of drought this is what you've got to do because you're the you're going to be the strongest nation in the whole world and you're going to raise up and you're going to teach Moses how to be a real leader but I got to get you to a spot to where you can and Moses interprets the dream you know what happens to him he becomes the right-hand man to Pharaoh as a matter of fact his words are as powerful as Pharaoh's words Stay With Me Now he has the authority to write a check he has the authority when listen when he goes out into the streets the Egyptians bow down to worship him listen you're you're thrilled to have Joseph walking through you're thrilled to have him coming through he saved your nation he's brought wealth to your family he's brought peace and so when he comes through they sound the horns and Joseph walks through and they worship him now he marries a gentile wife what do you know he marries a gentile wife he didn't go marry a Jewish lady he married a a gentile wife has children by her now as time would go the seven years of plenty and they feel their Garner so full listen now they're able to feed the whole world because the time of famine is coming it'll happen seasons of your life Seasons you'll feel like you're in the bride's Revival there are seasons where everything just is real quiet but he's still godl would you hand me that drink so now the famine strikes Jacob's home thank you you look good in that outfit and now it hits Jacob's home hits the brothers it incredible they can't find corn anywhere but there's corn in Egypt they don't know where Joseph wound up but there's corn in Egypt God has pushed it to a point till now you got to go to Egypt and so here's these boys and they put all their money on their their animals and and they head in they're going to get some corn and they don't know who the man is that's over top of it all cuz they can't recognize him that's right not in his outfit that he's in they can't recognize him now now is not the time now's not the time for him to reveal who he is but they don't realize they're fulfilling one of the dreams that he had when he was a boy and they're bowing down because now it's a livelihood and they're bowing down to get the corn and get the vils and get everything that they have need of and and now their brother is standing in a position because God has exalted him to that spot he asked him some real questions he said is your father still living yeah you have a little brother is he is he okay well I'm not going to give you what you want till you go get them bring them here well they thought oh man he's going to put us all in prison you know hey he he's going to go put us all in prison he's not just wanting us here now he's going to put us all in you don't mind me telling a story or two do you and so they don't know what's going on you know what our Nations don't know what's going on they're just being they're right in the will of God they're just following right along the plan of God Sodom and gah the nations of the world are headed to a One World Government there's going to come a man on the earth that's probably already here but he's going to be Anointed with a man of sin and he's going to sembly be the peace over the all the world but that's not the king that we're looking for but our King is coming our King is Coming can you imagine Joseph's feelings when he sees Jacob can you imagine his feelings when he sees Benjamin and he creates a great feast for them you know the kind of feast that we enjoy around the message of the hour and they just know this man as a leader in Egypt but here we are decades later and all of a sudden the man that's standing at the head of the table and his Gentile wife he says now I'm going to go ahead and dismiss you for a little while I need to talk to these men because she don't know either so let's just say it's at the wedding supper and and he leaves for just a little while and and he comes down to Israel and he reveals who he is like he did with the Seven Seals he reveals it through the seven trumpets and he said I'm Jesus I'm Jesus whom you crucified where did you get those nail scars in your hands I got them in the hands of my brethren don't worry will you give that to him you put that in the back it'll be okay I'll take care of that in a few minutes well where did you get the scars I got them in the household of my friends and then he reveals who he is I don't know exactly how he did it but I'd say he probably started out you remember there was a little boy that had visions and dreams yeah and here we are decades later and now those dreams are coming true and you've just bowed to me fulfilling the word of the Lord Kings of the earth you didn't believe the message all the time but I want to tell you I'm Jesus are you with me and I want to reveal to you my wife she's a gentile wife and I I picked her out of every nation and every tongue and every people and they wouldn't let your natural president be their king or they wouldn't let your natural King be their King they chose me because I chose them and then they realized the statement every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess why don't you just give him a great big [Applause] hand I love you with all my heart and I will preach to you you as long as I got strength in my beings amen God bless you I love you with all of my heart amen I love you with all my heart as
