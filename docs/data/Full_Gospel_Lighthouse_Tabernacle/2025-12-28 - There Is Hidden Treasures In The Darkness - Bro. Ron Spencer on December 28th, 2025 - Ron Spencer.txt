You sent us a word, Lord, to separate us out from the things of the world to call us [music] out. So many different forms of life. So many things that we thought was life. You've called us to a higher order, Lord. You've given us something, Lord, before the [music] foundation of the world.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, and he leadeth me beside of the still waters. He restoreth my soul, and he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. And yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil, and my cup runth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we love you today with all of our hearts. We report for duty. We come to to have more of you today, Lord. We hunger in our hearts. We know that our desire is for you. And thank you for that desire because so many don't have it. They don't have a desire to come to church. No desire to serve you. Lord, we love you with all of our hearts. and that there be anything in our lives that that shouldn't be there. Lord, we ask you to forgive us and and take that out of our lives and minister to us that we would be better Christians today. Minister in our lives and you see the many needs in our bodies. Sister Kim Weeks that is in in a quite a difficult situation. We ask you that you would touch her, be her doctor, be the great physician in a special way and bless this audience and even the audience that's watching today in Jesus Christ's name. Amen and amen. You may be seated. Amen. Sister Crystal, I have a strange request. if you would give me the last verse of on the wings of a snow white dove. [clears throat] The scripture says in Psalms 23, "Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff comfort me." God doesn't tell you, "I'm not I'm I'm going to keep you from walking through it. He doesn't say, "Now, before you get to a spot of a of a difficult situation, I'm going to stop that. I'm not going to allow you to have to go through that." He knows life, &gt;&gt; and life's got difficult parts to it. And he says, "Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will feel no evil, for thou art with me." I wouldn't want to walk through it without him. Do you? &gt;&gt; I don't want to cross the road without the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, and thou anointest my head with oil, and my cup runth over. Brother Brandham had been s through some incredibly difficult times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As a prophet of God, incredible pressures that was around him. And if I could just say a couple of things here. Brother Ben Brandman watched his mother and his father pass away. He had watched his wife pass away. He had buried his little girl. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And watched her pass away. marry again and and then watch his children grow up. Traveling through all the world and seeing every kind of a difficult situation that there was &gt;&gt; and doing even at his best, watching friends walk away because of truth, &gt;&gt; because of the word of God. Watch friends turn away from him. That's right. &gt;&gt; And if I could put it in perspective, some of those friends would offer him incredible money &gt;&gt; to stand in their churches and just compromise a little bit &gt;&gt; or not say difficult things. &gt;&gt; Let me just say in the early 60s a million dollars was a lot of money. Come on. &gt;&gt; Million dollars for most of us today is a lot of money. &gt;&gt; Brother Biscll actually saw the check. A million dollar check. &gt;&gt; That's a lot of money. &gt;&gt; And he turned it down &gt;&gt; for you. for you. He turned it down for you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let Let me just say as I was just sharing this last night in the office. When brother Brandham was given an opportunity to go beyond the curtain of time, you remember he began to see friends and they were coming up and hugging him. And he tells us that sisters was coming up and hugging him and it was such a powerful awesome atmosphere and and the angel is with him and he's speaking with him and they're they're actually having conversation and brother Ram asked him says or the angel asked him said do you know who who that lady was that that just hugged you and he said no I don't believe I do. You led her to the Lord when she was past 95. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you could just stop and absorb that just for a moment. In that place, she's totally unrecognizable in her youth. &gt;&gt; And what an atmosphere. Brother Anne would talk about it'll take perfect love. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect love to get there. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an atmosphere towards no sin. &gt;&gt; There's no difficulty. &gt;&gt; There's no hard situations of life. There's no time pieces. &gt;&gt; There's there's not a hospital. There's not a police department. &gt;&gt; No psych wards. That's the place we're going to. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the prophet of God in turning all of these things down had to have something driving him to get a people from this word there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And there had to be a people that would lay aside every weight &gt;&gt; and the sin that would so easily beset them and have a goal in THIS LIFE. THERE'S NOTHING HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; There's nothing here to keep me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Could you SAY THAT WITH ME? NOTHING. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would sing the song especially in shreport on the wings of a snow white dove and and he would write a last verse to that song. And if you remember the wings of a snow white dove and let me just caution you here for a moment. Might blow some of your minds. It was a country song. &gt;&gt; A country song. Tops in the billboards. Country song. And here's brother Brandham a prophet singing it. &gt;&gt; Hope that don't blow nobody's mind. Nobody walk out of the building. [snorts] He writes this verse and because he's lived it, he can write it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not somebody else's story, he can write it. &gt;&gt; Notice these words. Though I have suffered in many a way. I cried for healing both night and day. Faith wasn't forgotten by the Father above. He gave me his sign on the wings &gt;&gt; of a dove. &gt;&gt; Second Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 8. We're troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. I want to read it again so you catch it. There's two different ways of there's two things looking at right here. &gt;&gt; We are in one world but we have sight of another world. &gt;&gt; We're troubled on every side yet not distressed. &gt;&gt; We are perplexed but not in despair. Persecuted but not forsaken. Cast down but not destroyed. 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 7. the trial of your faith. Not the trial of Jesus's faith or the brother's faith or the sister's faith. The trial of your faith [snorts] &gt;&gt; being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found under the praise and the honor and the glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Isaiah chapter 53. HE IS DESPISED and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief, and we hid as if it were our faces from him. He was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. Yet did he est yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God, and afflicted. We can all say this together, but he was wounded, &gt;&gt; for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes, &gt;&gt; we are &gt;&gt; we are healed. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in a gives us a quote in letting off the pressure and I think it's so wonderful. Every time I read this quote, I I think about you, Brother Josh Jones. I think about this. He said, "As a little rabbit, the story of he the hounds was right behind him. He could feel their breath upon his feet." And just a little while, another jump or two, that hound was going to get this little fella. and he would BE GOBBLED UP JUST in a moment. But after about IT, HE SAW A HOLE in a rock. Can you imagine his desperation? &gt;&gt; And he thought, "IF I COULD ONLY GET TO that rock, then I'm safe." And just as that dog made that last jump at him, he felt his hot breath on his heels. But he run under that rock and he could set down and let off the pressure. &gt;&gt; The hound could not scratch through that rock. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a rock Jesus is. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we can feel the hounds. &gt;&gt; Last few weeks I felt the hounds and the scratching. BUT OH, WHAT A ROCK JESUS IS. WHAT A PROMISE THAT HE IS. [applause] &gt;&gt; The scripture Isaiah 53 says he was he was uh he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. I want to just just take a quote a couple quotes here. Brother Ram says it was only a prefigure of a per of a picture that if we could just turn our camera now to the morning down in Jerusalem, I can see out of a window and hear a noise. What is it? A priest is saying, "Away with such a man." And I could hear a little woman run out in front of the crowd saying, "What has he done?" but heal your sick, RAISE YOUR DEAD, AND BROUGHT deliverance to to those that were captive. A big cruel hand would smack her in the mouth and say, "Would you listen to that woman instead of the priest?" A cruel Roman whip was beating him. It's a kind of an awful picture, but let's raise our shades and look. I can hear something bumping through the street over those cobblestones. And I look out the window and I saw a little man with a with a white robe wo throughout without seams laying across his shoulders packing an old cross as it bumps away down in the streets. His soul, his shoulders are they're rubbing raw. And I notice his little garment there. little spots all over it. Those spots begins to grow as he as he goes up the hill, &gt;&gt; getting bigger &gt;&gt; and bigger. And after a while, they start running into one great big spot. A great bloody splash against his legs. What is it? It's the second Adam. You heard brother Andrew talking about the first Adam last night. Then the second, the second Adam, that seed of the woman and the bee of death humming around him, his head as it was going up the hill, knowing that soon that the devil will certainly had the wool pulled over his eyes there. THE DEVIL SAID, "HOW COULD A MAN THAT CLAIMS TO BE GOD, HOW COULD HE?" I CHALLENGED HIM TO A stunt a couple of his tricks in front of me and he turned it and he turned bread and rocks into bread. He failed TO DO IT. HOW COULD HE STAND YOU IF HE'S A prophet and let a Roman soldier put a rag around his face and hit him on the head and and stick and say, "Now, IF YOU'RE A PROPHET, TELL US WHO HIT YOU." And set still. He's a faker. And I'm coming and I'm going to sting him with my sting of death. I'll get him now. Oh, how he failed. And when they st when they hung him on the cross and that bee was humming around him, if a bee or an insect has a stinger and if it ever stings and anchors that stinger deep, when he goes away, he can never sting again. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He leaves his stinger in the flesh. Death could sting sting a sinner and get by WITH IT. BUT THAT TIME HE LEFT a stinger in Emmanuel's flesh &gt;&gt; and he pulled the stinger out. No wonder St. Paul could say years after that that bee of death was humming around him, "Oh death, WHERE'S YOUR STINGER? &gt;&gt; GRAVE, WHERE'S YOUR VICTORY? BUT thanks be TO GOD WHO GIVETH us the victory through Jesus Christ. Death was conquered. &gt;&gt; THE bee can hum around. The bee can can buzz and SAY, "AND I GOT YOU." BUT WE CAN POINT YONDER to an empty grave &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "THANKS BE TO GOD THAT GIVE US SUCH A VICTORY THROUGH THE LORD Jesus Christ. He can MAKE NOISE, &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAN'T SING. CUZ HE AIN'T GOT A STINGER NO MORE. &gt;&gt; When he anchored his stinger into the flesh of Emmanuel, GOD'S FLESH AMONG US, he pulled the stinger out of death. THAT WAS GOD'S IDEA of his first conference. I'd like to share this with you. Eternal life and what it means. Sometimes I think we kind of just become passive about what eternal life means. Prophet says, he says, thirsting for life. if we should take a trip tonight and go up into heaven and I'd meet Father Abraham and I'd say,"Abraham, what is the most glorious thing that you've ever known? What is the most essential thing that you could ever have known?" Abraham would say unto me, "Life eternal." &gt;&gt; Amen. I take a little trip and we go again and we we go up to meet the Archangel Gabriel who is the messenger of the covenant to the Jewish people who stands at the right hand of God, one of the highest orders of angels in the heavens. And I would say to him, Gabriel, thou art a mighty angel. You're the loved of God and you've been here for aons of time [clears throat] &gt;&gt; and you perhaps know everything that in the heavens where everything is placed because you're one of God's right-and angels and you know the great secrets of the heavens. You sounded the trumpet at the coming of the Lord Jesus. You announced his first coming and you will announce his second coming. So you must be a mighty man or a mighty angel. I want to ask you IN ALL OF GOD'S TREASURES, what is the greatest thing that you have found amongst his treasures? And I can see Gabriel bring himself to attention and say, "The greatest thing that I have found in God's treasure since he created me is life." &gt;&gt; God made it to live for eternity. &gt;&gt; I think sometimes we don't get that &gt;&gt; because we can't fathom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Eternity. Life with no end. &gt;&gt; Life is the greatest thing that there is. No matter how rich you might be, no matter how popular you might be, no matter who you might be, the greatest thing that there is that a man can achieve in this earth is to achieve eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Though you might be a king or a potentate, though you rule the world for a million years as a king and a young man and you failed to find eternal life, you've lost the greatest thing that anyone can lose. Listen, Hollywood cannot produce eternal life. &gt;&gt; The music world and the rock and the country and all the nonsense cannot. &gt;&gt; All the sports world cannot. Religion cannot. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, YOU'RE PRESENTED WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. Are you with me now? IT HAS eternal life &gt;&gt; in it. I've often said if I could be a young man 25 years old, if God would appear on the platform and say, "I will turn you 25 years old of age, and thou you'll remain for a million years, and I'll make you a king over all the universe, and everything will be at your command. or I'll give you a hundred years of misery and woe and trouble and sorrow, but at the end of that hundred years, I'll give you eternal life, but at the end of a million years, you're lost. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, Lord God, I don't have to wait any longer to make my choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me have a hundred years of misery and woe. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Treasures in the darkness is what I'm speaking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to wait any longer to make my choice. Let me have the hundred years of misery and woe and any kind of death that you choose for me to die. Only Lord, give me eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; For though I owned the whole world and was the king over a million years, but at the end of a million years I become hellbound preacher for eternity. But no matter how bad my lot is here on earth, at the end of my life, if I've got eternal life &gt;&gt; and live blessed presence of God forever, &gt;&gt; and forever, &gt;&gt; I know for the front row it's difficult to to think about life h going past so quickly. I know it is. I understand that. I lived in sit in your shoes. It happens real quick. If I can just stop and just bring you up to how quick things happen. Six years ago, six years ago, they gave me four months. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Six years went really quick. as I sat with my cancer doctor last week and and and she was giving me some very difficult choices and she says uh cuz we're battling between a kidney disease and cancer. And she says, "You you've got a choice to make." And she said, "I I was there with you. I walked in the room with you and I saw your eyes. I saw how you was and she said, "I'll never get it all out of my mind." And so she says, "Well, would you like to make a choice?" I said, "Well, what would your father what would you tell your father to do?" That kind of put her in a spot. Brother Vernon, I I'll be honest with you. I want to I want to get to their heart. You know, I don't want just their knowledge. I want to get to their heart because in their heart, they'll tell me the truth. &gt;&gt; They won't be practicing. They'll tell me the truth. &gt;&gt; And she said, "Well, with the cancer that you have, it's an extreme high risk." I said, "Well, let me help you here." I known people that have the same medicine that I'm on and they say they're completely cancer free and so they quit the medicine and two months later they're dead. Allan Jackson was completely cancerree and two months later he was dead eat up with cancer. I said, ' So, are you telling me that if I go off the chemo, there's an extreme high risk that two months later I'll be gone. She just nodded her head. You know, these are difficult choices. &gt;&gt; Now, listen. I I want to see eternity, but I want to stay here with you. You know, I I I want to see I want to see you, Julia, you'll get married &gt;&gt; and Adam, I don't know if it'll ever happen, but I want to see you guys have children, &gt;&gt; and I'd like to hold them. And [applause] you know, I'd like to be a part of your weddings. I'd like to be a part of your life. I'd like to preach to you every Sunday morning. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's what I'd like. [applause] And so I'm saying all that to say this. I know a I know a portion of darkness. I've walked some difficult roads. Maybe not as difficult as a lot of other people has walked, but I I can stand as a preacher and understand life. &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching it from somebody else's story. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? There's a statement that I read to you some time ago. Uh I asked God, "Why are you taking me through the troubled waters?" &gt;&gt; And he replied to me, "Because your enemies can't swim." The writer of your New Testament, much of it kind of shares some of his difficulty in 2 Corinthians 12 and verse 6. For though I would would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool. For I will say the truth, and but now I forebear, lest that any any man should think of me above measure, seeth me to be, or heareth of me, and lest I should be exalted above measure, lest that though the abundance of revelations was given to me, the thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should get exalted above measure. That's quite that's quite a scripture right there. God knew how to keep him humble. &gt;&gt; I hope it's not my lot. &gt;&gt; Now watch his prayer. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient. FOR MY STRENGTH IS MADE perfect in weakness, and most gladly will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ might rest upon me. Notice what he says, and I don't know if I can say this. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities and in reproaches, in necessities, and persecutions, and in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, &gt;&gt; then I am strong. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'd like to just take you just for a second here. &gt;&gt; I can only imagine watching Abraham walking up the hill with Isaac. God told him to take his son, his only son, and sacrifice him. He didn't talk to Sarah. He didn't even tell Isaac what was getting ready to happen today. But he had confidence in God. That's where we got to be at &gt;&gt; is to have confidence in God. &gt;&gt; And do you remember what God said? Thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And remember God had taken him out maybe in the daytime and said, "CAN YOU COUNT THE SANDS of the sea? &gt;&gt; No way can you do that. &gt;&gt; SO SHALL THY SEED BE." AMEN. &gt;&gt; Maybe in a night a beautiful pollutionfree night to where the stars are just shining SO BRIGHTLY, GOD'S HAVING A CONFR conference with him and he says,"Abraham, can't you count the stars in the sky? I can just imagine him kind of taking his hands like this and looking up. One, two, three, four, five. Just in his hands like that. &gt;&gt; Maybe count a hundred with that which he could see just in this little span because there's where a lot of people have. They're just looking in a little block. &gt;&gt; That's right. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It's this, you know, the world is just not you. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just have to get over oursel. &gt;&gt; Take a take a a pin, a hat pin. You know, those ladies used to wear hat pins. And if you could pull that hat pin out about that long, they stick one of them in my back once in a while. And you just you just take that and pop yourself a little bit and let the air go [clears throat] out. &gt;&gt; Some people look real big. What they need is a hot pin. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor. Say, "Are you getting this?" &gt;&gt; Don't tell them this is for you. That might make them mad. Definitely don't tell your wife. Don't tell her. &gt;&gt; And Abraham could look at the stars and look at the sand AND REMEMBER MELZDC SAYING IT. LIFT THE EAR TO HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW GOD GIVES HIM HIS greatest test. You know, sometimes you come to that that test and GIVES HIM A TEST TO WHERE THAT HE'S GOT TO make a decision. NOW, IT'S NOT GOD MAKING a decision. It's I'm trusting you. I'm going to see. Do you trust me? &gt;&gt; I'm going to find it out. I've been doing all this for you. NOW, DO YOU TRUST ME? TAKE YOUR SON, your only son. You're talking about a dark hour. &gt;&gt; You're talking about a dark spot. AND HE'S CARRYING HE'S CARRYING THE WOOD AND HE'S GOT THE FIRE. ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? &gt;&gt; But he don't have a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's what a lot of churches is. We got music. We got musicians. We got a preacher. &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T HAVE A LIVING JESUS among them. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU got to have an experience. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO KNOW HIM FOR YOURSELF. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST HAVING a community of people AND ASSOCIATION TOGETHER AND FRIENDSHIPS. WE NEED A LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; A living God. [applause] A GOD THAT'S ON THE SCENE ON MONDAY MORNING, TUESDAY. &gt;&gt; When you're rolling in a jeep, you need a living God. When a when a when a big old [snorts] HIGHWAY TRUCK IS COMING DOWN THE ROAD BOWING DOWN ON YOU NEED A LIVING GOD. &gt;&gt; It goes beyond pretend. &gt;&gt; It goes beyond all of that. goes beyond having an actor's mask on. &gt;&gt; A lot of people can serve God when everything's going good. &gt;&gt; BUT CAN I TRUST YOU? &gt;&gt; IN THE DARK TIMES, &gt;&gt; WHEN THE TRIALS COME, &gt;&gt; WHEN THE VALLEY COMES, &gt;&gt; CUZ THERE'S WHERE THE TREASURE IS AT. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Stay with me. Father, we have wood and we have fire, but we don't have a a sacrifice. And he began to speak. God [snorts] will be our sacrifice. He'll provide. Now everything is built on that hillside. Isaiah was Isaac was quite a guy. No doubt he was a late teenager, strong. It wasn't just Abraham, but now it's Isaac's turn. And he was obedient. He was obedient to allow himself to be the sacrifice of today. But I want you to just notice and maybe you've never heard it like this. Abraham had repeated Melzdc's words to Isaac. He had looked at the same stars. He had looked the same sand. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he knew he was the one that that seed had to pass through. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. LET ME JUST SAY WHAT ABRAHAM BELIEVED. HE BELIEVED IF I SACRIFICE HIS BEFORE GOD, GOD WILL RAISE HIM RIGHT BACK UP. [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I say this to you tonight. IF YOU'LL LAY YOURSELF ON THE ALTAR &gt;&gt; AND DIE OUT TO YOURSELF, HE'LL RAISE YOU RIGHT BACK UP. &gt;&gt; God allows pressures. He allows circumstances over life. AND SOMETIMES LIFE WILL blindside you. Brother Aram says in Speak to the Rock, he says, "But you know that's the way that God leads us, isn't it? Some through the water, through the floods, some through deep trials, but all through the blood." &gt;&gt; Is that right? through every briar patch and temptation. His grace has brought me safe thus far, and grace shall take me on through many dangers, tolls, and snares. I have already come. His grace has brought me safe this far. It's grace that will take me on. I just believe. I just believe him. I DON'T KNOW WHY WHAT TOMORROW HOLDS. I don't know. Here's a prophet. I don't know. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I KNOW WHO HOES TOMORROW, &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But it was horrible that God would allow Brother Brandham to lose his baby girl &gt;&gt; and WATCH HER SUFFER SO BAD UNTIL HER EYES WOULD CROSS BEFORE she died. But you don't know what that did to a prophet. &gt;&gt; You don't know what that did to a prophet. And the devil's whispering in his ear, "God don't care for you. God don't love you." And he said, "JUST WHEN I WAS GETTING READY TO GIVE UP, SOMETHING TOOK A HOPE." &gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE TIMES THAT YOU THINK, "I CAN'T MAKE IT ANOTHER DAY." AND SOMETHING TAKES A HOPE. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Rand, I'm standing there. No doubt THE DEVIL IS LAUGHING. HIS KINGDOM IS ON FIRE. HE DON'T REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING. &gt;&gt; That baby dying and it's crosseyed. But that WOULD THAT WOULD INK SOMETHING AND SCAR SOMETHING IN BROTHER Brandham's own nature &gt;&gt; TO WHERE EVERY CROSSEYED BABY THAT WOULD COME ACROSS THE PLATFORM. EVERY ONE OF THEM were healed. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY EVERY [screaming] ONE OF THEM WERE HEALED. Brother Chris, even the PROPHET WOULD SAY, "SOME OF THEM I NEVER PRAYED FOR. I JUST GOT HIM TO LOOK INTO MY EYES." &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED SUCH A FAITH. &gt;&gt; YOUR SCARS THAT YOU GO THROUGH, &gt;&gt; the enemy don't know what he's doing, &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S TREASURES IN THE DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; COME [screaming] ON, CHURCH. IT MAKES YOU STRONGER. &gt;&gt; Caesar would say he would like somebody to ride with him in his chariot. Brother Brandon would tell the story how that all the great generals got themselves ready and their plumes ready and every all the polished their armor. They were all out there standing and Caesar goes down through them looking and he comes to a little guy there that's got scars all over him. He don't have all that nice armor and he's standing there. Caesar stops. How'd you get those scars? Fighting for you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. fighting you, Lord Caesar. He said, "Today you'll ride with me." &gt;&gt; He's not looking for Hollywood soldiers. &gt;&gt; He's looking for men and women of the cross. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE HE COULD find some here today. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, I don't know, brother Honor. My walk of life. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LOOK BACK WHERE YOU STARTED? WHY DON'T YOU LOOK WHERE YOU ARE? &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING? &gt;&gt; I'M FOCUSED ON A CHAIR &gt;&gt; SITTING AT THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB. IT'S MY CHAIR. &gt;&gt; NOBODY CAN TAKE MY PLACE. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid I'll go to hell. Listen, if you got one ounce of GOD IN YOU, ONE OUNCE, GOD IS NOT GOING TO SEND THAT ONE OUNCE TO HELL &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A PART OF HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AND HE'S NOT SENDING HIMSELF TO HELL. HE'S ALREADY WENT THERE AND CONQUERED [screaming] &gt;&gt; AND OVERCOME DEATH, HELL, AND THE GRAVE. WE ARE his victory. [applause] We're looking at a new year. It's getting ready to flip. The season's getting ready to flip. Sun's went around. The moon's went around. The whatever that is goes around and makes a cycle. I'm not an astrologer, neither pretending to be this morning. But we've come to another year. Another year to where we can stop and look back at this last year. the things that have went on, the accomplishments that's been made. Some of you've made incredible strides, but let's not look back. &gt;&gt; Let's not let's not lay on our laurels &gt;&gt; and say, "I I've got enough." As brother Andrew was saying, and I hope you got it. &gt;&gt; I want more. &gt;&gt; I WANT [screaming] MORE. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SURRENDER MORE TO HIM. I WANT HIM TO FILL MY LIFE, &gt;&gt; fill my family. &gt;&gt; We have a table that sits well, I don't know, 14, 18 chairs. It's a long table. My grandchildren sit there. Sister Nancy sits there. My children sits there. There's never been an argument at that table. That's pretty phenomenal, ain't it? Listen, this message works. &gt;&gt; And I was sitting there the other day looking at my family and I said, "Oh, God, I don't want one of them to be lost." &gt;&gt; Would you stop and think about that just for a moment about your family? Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want one of them to be lost. &gt;&gt; I can't imagine a table to where that half of them are lost &gt;&gt; without God. &gt;&gt; Listen, heaven's not heaven like that. &gt;&gt; If you got CHILDREN LOST, DON'T BE SATISFIED with no matter what kind of job they have. &gt;&gt; They're making MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WHAT'S THAT? BIGGEST HOUSE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHAT'S THAT? &gt;&gt; DRIVING THE BEST CAR IN THE WORLD. WHAT'S THAT? &gt;&gt; MARRIED TO MISS AMERICA? WHAT'S THAT? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE IN THIS WORLD, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG. &gt;&gt; We should never be comfortable here. &gt;&gt; Come on. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING WORTH STAYING HERE FOR. &gt;&gt; But brother Rhonda, BROTHER RAM'S BEEN GONE 60 YEARS. WHAT'S THAT [screaming] &gt;&gt; IN A SPACE OF ETERNITY? WHAT'S 60 YEARS? OKAY. I'll just share something been on my heart. &gt;&gt; You got a microphone? Yeah. I just want to use it as a prop. &gt;&gt; It's not on. Okay. Let's Let's go to judgment day and walk through the line at judgment day. Amen. &gt;&gt; If we could just kind of interview. We're doing an interview. You know, that's what they do in the world. They want to put a microphone in front of their faces, &gt;&gt; you know, unprompted. And you give an answer. Well, why are you here? Well, I I was in Hollywood. I was a star. &gt;&gt; What's that? &gt;&gt; Maybe you come to Bill Gates. Well, I gave most of my salary away. Even even at the end of my life, I'm I'm going to give it all away. &gt;&gt; I was a incredibly smart man. What's that? &gt;&gt; Come to a lady and you go, "All right, who are you?" I was Miss America. I showed my body to the whole world. Where was your preacher at? &gt;&gt; Where was your preacher at that that warned you'd be responsible? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Let me just say you you need a preacher that'll tell you. &gt;&gt; You need a preacher that'll tell you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Dress like a lady. Cover your legs up. &gt;&gt; Don't cut your hair. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S CUTTING HAIR? IT'S A sign of of refusing headship. &gt;&gt; And listen, NOT JUST YOUR HUSBAND, CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Those things put you in the judgment line. Amen. &gt;&gt; Greatest sports stars. What's this? Tiger Woods. &gt;&gt; Listen, if you die and you're the greatest golfer in the world and you die without Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; remember that quote about eternal life? &gt;&gt; The woman died this yesterday. Hollywood star, sex symbol. She died yesterday. She knows where she's at now. &gt;&gt; She may have been worshiped on this world, but she knows where she's at. Marilyn Monroe, she knows where she's at now. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to come real close to your heart. You walk up to the next one and it goes, "What did you do in life? What did you do to deserve?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What did you do in deserve to be in this line? I rejected Jesus. I was standing there throwing stones at him. Listen, you could have been a phenomenal businessman and owned a block in the city, but one day you throw a stone at Jesus. Uhoh. Come on. &gt;&gt; You'll be remembered for that in eternity. &gt;&gt; What did you do? I mocked Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; I mocked him. I mocked Brother Ron. &gt;&gt; I mocked the preachers of the message. Oh, it made you feel good for a day. &gt;&gt; And you found some people that would agree with you, &gt;&gt; but there's no friends in hell. &gt;&gt; Listen, this is individual affair, brother, but I'm I'm watching you by the internet and that's OFFENDING ME. GET RIGHT WITH GOD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; I'M SAYING IT. GET RIGHT WITH GOD. [applause] I'm giving YOU A CHANCE. WHEN YOU DIE, YOU DON'T HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE. &gt;&gt; It'll be some of them that'll have a hypocritical preacher that'll stand at their at their at their funeral and say a lot of good words, but they won't stand THERE AND SAY, "THIS person mocked the message. Listen. And if you've got friends that did that, you keep them far away. &gt;&gt; You keep them at extremely arms length. &gt;&gt; I don't have them kind of friends. I'm honest with you. My prayer is they get right with God. But I don't let darkness into my world. &gt;&gt; What do those type of people become? Haunted houses. They become haunted houses. Because after a while, you turn against the prophet, then you turn against the preachers, then you turn against the Bible. &gt;&gt; Then you got to have a Bible that suits you. Then you become an atheist. &gt;&gt; That's kind of like HAVING PORNOGRAPHY AS A HABIT. &gt;&gt; BEFORE LONG, IT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER WOMAN. Then it becomes a man &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SIN DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM. [applause] &gt;&gt; IT DON'T HAVE A BOTTOM TO IT. THERE'S NO SATISFACTION &gt;&gt; to sin. &gt;&gt; I'm going TO GO LIVE MY LIFE. GO AHEAD. THAT'S YOUR CHOICE. Where will the rich young ruler be at? &gt;&gt; Where will Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley be at when they sang the song, I did it my way? Hey, you can be cocky here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You can be cocky here and say, I did it my way. Nobody could tell me what to do. I don't need nobody. &gt;&gt; You need Jesus. Let me be let me let this 5 foot five preacher look you in the eyes today. You need Jesus. &gt;&gt; And you NEED ENOUGH HUMILITY ABOUT YOU TO SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME. [applause] &gt;&gt; GOD, FORGIVE me if I GOT TO CRAWL ON MY HANDS AND KNEES. GOD FORGIVE ME. [applause] DIFFICULTY. SURE, people in the world have difficulties and sometimes they overcome. We read about Beethoven that lost his hearing, but that didn't stop him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He saw it off his piano so he could hear. Put his ear on the floor and he became known as one of the greatest writers that ever lived. &gt;&gt; There was a man There was a man. Can I give you a couple of these? &gt;&gt; There was a man that had a restaurant. You know, there's some circumstances you don't have nothing to do with. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be living a perfectly good life and be blindsided by life. There was a man that had a restaurant. IT WAS A PROSPEROUS restaurant and they built a interstate by there and nobody stopped at his restaurant no more. [snorts] So he began to take his food, put it in the back end of his station wagon and take it to to to uh different different FACILITIES AND WOULD SELL HIS FOOD. LISTEN, he's now getting ready to retire. He's 65 years old. But he wasn't WANTING TO QUIT. HE TOOK HIS chicken to all of America. &gt;&gt; ALL OF CANADA, ALL OF CHINA. &gt;&gt; No matter what missionary work YOU CAN DO, THERE'S COLONEL SANDERS FACE THERE. &gt;&gt; IN THE DARKNESS OF A INTERSTATE BEING BUILT IN FRONT OF HIM, HE FOUND TREASURE. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; There was a young man fell in a fire where they took him to the hospital. The doctors in attendance said, "We're going to have to cut his legs off." &gt;&gt; And his mama said, "No, we can't cut his legs off. No, no, no, no, no." He pleaded, "Don't cut my legs off." He was burnt so bad till his use of his legs was gone. They become useless limbs. He was set in a wheelchair and couldn't wiggle his toes. They would roll him out in the yard and he'd watch children playing and going by and he would ask them, "Push me up to the fence." Picket fence. pushed me up to the fence and one day he got enough grit to grab a hold of the fence. I hope I'm talking to people that'll grab the fence right now. &gt;&gt; I don't know where you are in life, but get enough gumption to grab a hold of the fence. &gt;&gt; AND HE PULLED HIMSELF UP. Oh man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Day after day, he would stand there standing on his feet, which was an impossibility. And one day, Teddy, he took a step. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he began to take more steps. And it was a dream that it could go all the way to the end of the yard, one step at a time. Sometimes you've got to take some steps. BUT BROTHER, I'M FELL DOWN. GET UP. &gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID I CAN'T MAKE IT. PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE TO JUDGE YOU. WE'RE HERE TO ENCOURAGE YOU. [applause] &gt;&gt; LAY YOUR ROCKS DOWN OUTSIDE. WE DON'T NEED PEOPLE THROWING ROCKS HERE. WE DON'T NEED A GOSSIP PARTER HERE. WE'RE HERE AS a team. WE'RE HERE AS A BODY. WE NEED ONE ANOTHER. &gt;&gt; That young man not only went to the end of the fence, but became an Olympic runner. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE FIRST MAN, NOW THINK OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY. HE WAS THE FIRST man to run a four-minute mile in the Olympics. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, there's a lot of times people see your face, but they don't know your story. You need to you need to clap your hands right there. They see your face, but they don't know your story. [applause] [applause] You see brother Shannon's face, but you don't know his story. &gt;&gt; COME ON. YOU SEE ONE ANOTHER, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's treasure there. And I finish in the last six years. I understand treasure. &gt;&gt; And I want to ask you as an audience, have you appreciated the diamonds? Have you appreciated the diamonds that we found? &gt;&gt; Sister Wanda, you went through a horrible thing, but you looked at some treasure. If God helped him to do it, I can do it.

And if you get a hug from her, you better get a trophy out. cuz there's days she likes you and there's days that you know what you're saying. You know &gt;&gt; it's worth life is worth living. &gt;&gt; Brother Roger understands that now because he's fighting for the last bit of his life. But he can look back and here's where I'm going. He can look back on the treasures that he laid up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't wait till your deathbed. &gt;&gt; DON'T PARTY ALL YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; DON'T DRUGG ALL YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE DAY. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS THE DAY TO SERVE GOD AND COMMIT TO GOD and surrender TO GOD.

Thank God about children being so distressed because their Christian mom and dad fought &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; like cats and dogs. &gt;&gt; I'll be honest. I'm just gonna I'm just going to share my heart. Here we are. I thought about that. I couldn't go to sleep that night. Connie will tell you when I heard that, I couldn't go to sleep. I'm thinking about Christians that are that have been Christians for 50 years &gt;&gt; and they fight to like two, these were the words, two dogs RAGING TO TRYING TO KILL ONE ANOTHER. It should not be so. &gt;&gt; It should NEVER I WANT TO SAY NEVER BE SO IN YOUR HOME or in your life. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE ABOUT BISCUITS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? [screaming] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHATEVER'S GOING ON IN YOUR TEMPORAL LIFE. If they're listening, I want to tell them, stop. &gt;&gt; Stop. Why? Why are you concerned about that, Brother Ron? We're going to a land &gt;&gt; where there will be none of that. &gt;&gt; And you can't be that way here &gt;&gt; and be that way there. All that's free. I quit a few minutes ago when the lights went out. Now the devil's mad that the lights went came back on. &gt;&gt; Let's stand and sing on the wings of a snow white dove. Sister Cassie, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to sing the first verse and the last verse. Sister Crystal, you enjoyed the service this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I stepped on you stepped on my toes this morning. Hey, &gt;&gt; I would rather do it here than do it there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that. Let's sing that first verse together today. Noah had drifted on the flood. Many days [singing] he searched for land [singing] in various ways. Troubles he had sunk [music] but not from [singing] above. God gave him his son [singing] on the wings of [music] God. Let's sing this verse together. King on the wings [music] of I love [music] God sent his pure sweet [music] a [music] on the wings [singing] of God. Let's sing this last verse. For though I have s that's every one of us in many ways I cry [music] for heal both night [singing] [music] and day. Faith was a gift for God [music] by the Father above.

What about looking forward? Maybe you're praying for revival in your heart. &gt;&gt; Praying for loved ones in your family. [music] Jobs situation. More than anything, we want more of God. Brother, I've been a Christian a long time. Do you ever remember what the angel told brother Brandham? Be more sincere. Let me let [music] me just let me just qualify that statement. The prophet of God had seen the greatest miracles ever performed on this earth. And I don't have to list them [music] off. Dead raised people step out [music] of wheelchairs. Cancers drop off. Eyes, ears, [music] legs extended, prodals coming home. He'd walk with the angel of the Lord. You know, I think sometimes we think we're walking with the angel, but to know even to know at a certain time that brother [music] Brandon said offended the angel. &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if our life offends [music] him &gt;&gt; and at a deep prayer, I quoted this to sister Connie this morning. Brother Brandham said, as I heard him say it this morning, he said, [music] "It is a sin to say a prayer, even quote a prayer." &gt;&gt; He said, "You [music] got to pray a prayer." &gt;&gt; He said, "You could study for hours [snorts] of what to say in your prayer." He said, "But you got to cry out to God. You got to cry out to God." Now, if we could in this last service before [music] going into the next year, if we could look deep inside of ourselves and say, "God, I want you to help me. I need help. I need help." I wrote these words to brother Donnie and brother Tim this morning, my buddies, bosom buddies. I said, "Fellas, sometimes life is [music] just overwhelming. Listen, I don't know what we would do without God. I don't know what we would do. But if I got God on my side, I can go through anything. Maybe if you take your wife's hand now and children's hand if they're close. Guys, it's okay to take one another's hand. Ain't nobody [music] going to say nothing here. Sis, you guys can take one another's hand there. And I don't want you to ask the Lord, Lord, help me. Help me that I would be worthy to [music] escape those things that are that are coming on the earth cuz they're coming. They're coming. Lord Jesus, we bow our heads before you. Lord, I thank you for the presence that we have felt in this building today. You're such a wonderful, kind father. [music] You're so powerful, Lord. And I think you are so incredible to where you can take care of my problems [music] and yet all the way across the world, you can take care of another problem. And you can do that universally when we call on your name. The Lord, no doubt, I could look at the failures of this year, trials that I've went through. I can look at [music] the tests that I went through and I can honestly say some of them I failed. But you're a God of grace, a God of mercy. You're a God of second chances, Lord Jesus. Come fill our hearts all over this building. [music] Let this be a complete building altar call. LORD, WE CRY OUT TO YOU, FATHER. Forgive us of our mistakes. Forgive us of our failures. Lord, I ask you that you would help us. We surrender our lives like never before. Lord, if there's one thing that I could pray, Lord, I need more of your spirit living in my life. Lord, give us all a personal revival. Minister to our hearts in Jesus Christ's name I [music] pray. In your name I pray. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Could we just raise our hands and thank him now? on the [music and singing] wings of a snow. Went [music] pure sweet love. A sun from [music] above [music] on the wings of God.

I I want you to turn around while we dismiss [music] and I want you to shake at least 10 people's hands. &gt;&gt; I want you to tell them, [music] "God bless you."
