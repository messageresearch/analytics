========================================

god aren't you thankful to know that God is with us not a God of history but a living God a God that he said he'd never leave you nor forsake you what a wonderful God that we serve tonight we want to be remembering our pastors he's travelling back from North Carolina this evening that God will give him safe travels and that he would just minister to them and man let's just go to prayer this evening how many here has a need that you like to take before the Lord a man you're not lifting your hands to a man tonight you're lifting your hands to Almighty God let's just ask him to come and meet that our needs tonight father we come before you tonight humbly Lord boldly with access Lord to your throne Lord declaring that you are God and there is none like you and Lord we just ask father that Your mercies would be made new in our lives tonight Lord Lord truly father we are hungry and we want to be fed Lord Lord we have felt your presence here this evening Lord as as the songs were sung Lord and the specials were brought forth Lord Jesus we are declaring that you are God from our lips father if there be this be the last breath we breathe Lord we want to we want to glorify the god of heaven Lord we recognize Lord Jesus that that it is a privilege for us to be able to lift your name and prayer and and to worship our hands to a Living God and a God that knows every situation Lord we lifted our hands to you father for truly there was a need below below in our heart Lord Jesus that we realized that that only you could meet so father we would ask Lord that you would take complete control of every situation and every circumstance in our life father Lord I pray that we would see the mighty angel step up in our lives and and push aside every bit of fear and unbelief and doubt father and push back the comp Lexa's of life and the stigmas of life and let us see you face-to-face father lord that's what we're here to do tonight is not worship of God that's somewhere far off or or a God of the future but a God that sees that we can worship face to face father in this day Lord is a song sung that that you are Emmanuelle you are God with us Lord that's what the angel came and declared in the end they in the first book they're a Matthew that that God is with us and you're not going to leave us here in Laodicea all alone you promised that there would be overcomers in this day and we're not going to be able to overcome without you father lord you told us that you would be standing there in the midst of the church and revelations chapter 1 and we have seen you time and time again and Lord tonight we want to see you one more time lord I yield myself to you one more time father lord I pray that we would see you dispersed your glory may the pulsations of the Holy Ghost energize the atmosphere here energize they anoint may the anointing come by and just touch our lives Lord we love and appreciate you and we glorify the god of heaven tonight in Jesus name in Jesus name if you have your Bibles us evening will turn over in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 and then we'll turn to revelations chapter 3 and verse 14 ain't God good to give us so many blessings amen tonight I'd like to speak to you on a thought that's been on my heart for about a month or so now on the evidence of a mother lode the evidence of a mother lode the Bible says here in Hebrews 11 and 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God I want you to say that by the Word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear as we turn to revelations chapter 3 in verse 14 I've asked the brothers to put this quote from the sermon absolute up for us this evening as you're turning there I will read this this quote this evening the Prophet said he is my ultimate he is my stand he is my absolute he is my top post there I stand now if I've got the wrong thing then God will never confirm it but if you have got the right thing God is obligated to confirm it what you say that God is obligated to confirm it there you are and that's the proof of it if it's right God is obligated to prove it's right if it's wrong he will have nothing to do with it revelations 3 and 14 and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot how would that work cold hot so them because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may us be rich and white raiment that thou may us be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may a see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may God bless his word he may be seated this evening as we are very familiar to this portion of scripture that we've read over in the Book of Revelations knowing that this is the hour that we live in and it it is such a it's such a normal thing to read over the characteristics of the Church of Laodicea and and to see the things that she is to be but before before God gives the characteristics of the Church of Laodicea notice it's the Church of Laodicea but the bride isn't by no means layout of seeing but before he gives the characteristics of the Church of Laodicea that she is that she's wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked he gives us a final description of himself they're saying that he is the faithful and and that he is the true witness that he is the beginning of the creation of God and He is the a man he has given us a final look at his supreme deity there and we see that before we go through these things that our eyes have got to be upon him if our eyes are upon Laodicea we will get caught up in the chaos of the world and caught up other things in life but we don't want to be caught up with the things of Laodicea we want our eyes on one thing and that is our Lord Jesus Christ for when our eyes are on other things is when we get in trouble now follow me with this quote tonight in the sermon identification he says and today when we hear the message of God come forth we think it's some crook crank or something and and there's plenty of it in the world schemes money-making unconcern people under impressions and speaking as if it was the Lord the Lord always truly identifies himself and notice but in that did you know that all those things have to come certainly the rose must have its thorns the kernel in a nut should be covered over with a bird you have to dig out the bird to get down to the kernel we just fail to see those things the jewels and the metals and jewels and money and silver and gold in these mountains are covered with dirt filled with pyrite and other minerals that run together with it we expect that we expect that you got to dig it out and when the prospector finds what what he calls paid us it's a dust but they see it it symbolizes in there that there's a shadow of a mother lode somewhere and when we see these people today pertaining to begin to be Christians and just living anyway what is it it's a pay dust there's a mother lode somewhere when we need when we see somebody acting like they got the Holy Ghost when they haven't and living a different life it's only a proof that there is a genuine mother lode of the holy ghosts that can be poured out that can give these things that is promised we must be concerned and reverent when we see people going about acting like Christians or trying to be a Christian but yet their life shows that they aren't Christian it is a genuine evidence that there is a true baptism of the Holy Ghost when you see people that want to be Christians where they can't be Christians it's proof that there is real Christian somewhere and I want to say this to you that we live in a day when there are men that that that had they're doing their absolute best to be Christians but because Christ is not on the inside because they are just going by intellectualism are going by a church creed or going by what they know they don't have him it is proving to you that there is more that there is more for you to have we live in an hour of unbelief and and Jesus told us that these things would come to pass and we we could read over in the Bible and Luke 18 and eight that when Jesus said that when the son of man cometh will he find faith again will he found faith he didn't say will I find righteousness but he said will I find faith you see because that's what the enemy is trying to destroy is show faith because if he the source of faith he'll destroy your righteousness he'll destroy your holiness and your purity if he gets to your faith you see Satan is on the attack today to destroy your faith in a living God are you with me tonight today the day that we live in it's a day of deception a day of delusions and and a day of trials a day of turmoil that we live in and we see the Spirit of Hell it's on a rampage like never before seeking to destroy every bit of belief that there is left you see is doing this absolute best to kill out believers but I believe that this is a house of God that is filled with believers not unbelievers not make believers I'm going to put you in the category that profit would put you in in the believers of this hour I know that the Prophet said that every church there there's three kind of believers but I'm gonna believe with everything that's within me tonight that you are true believers and if you are not I'm asking tonight that body into this service that you not be caught up in the category of the make believer in the unbeliever but you'd be in the category from on high because if you are not in that category one of these days you'll be looking for me to preach and I won't be here but I'm trusting that you'll be with me where I'm going but the enemy is all as absolute he's doing his absolute best he loves what he does and you see he's doing his best to attack you and it and you find in a day the day that we live in that it takes a minister a good 15 minutes to get into the service just to get his people I offer the mind of the things of the world didn't trying to get that mind off of things that they've been through in the week it takes a good 15 minutes for the minister because you see why it is Satan that is doing his best to block the visitation of the angel that's his job is to fight against you we know he hates us but we hate him too and if he's going to fight us let's fight him [Applause] it's a time when men are constantly having to be reminded that they're men and that women are constantly having to be reminded that they're women and I'm talking in natural and I'm talking in the spiritual realm men have forgotten what type of clothes apply they're supposed to put on and women have forgotten what type of clothes that they're supposed to put on are you with me tonight but you see also in the spiritual realm you will find that that is preached to you on your position and your authority more than ever before because Satan his shrine is best to block you from your position you see if you don't know who you are you don't know your authority but if you know who you are if you know what family you came from you carry a heritage of the whole entire family if you can look tonight in your spiritual heritage you would see King David there that slew Goliath you would sing King Isaiah there you would see the prophets of Allah there you would see all throughout they are men of rebbe they men of such a stature that cannot be pushed away in your heritage tonight there is all types of warriors there's the great general Josh who are there there's Moses there if you know who you are you know who you are not hello I'm not a shifflett I'm a Spencer I Know Who I am so I know who I'm not I'm a son of God so I know I'm not I know I'm not a child of the devil come on deal with me tonight I'm a son of God so I know that I cannot be pertaining to the devil why because I have been birthed by Papa you see but that's where Satan wants to keep the people at he wants to keep you and battle you with with such an amnesia to keep you off of your ground it's such a spirit of amnesia in the world today that believe that the enemy is trying to rob the people from the blessings of God you see Satan enjoys attacking you he loves doing his job he loves attacking your health he loves tearing down your belief system he's been working against you for a mighty long time you may have been here maybe twenty thirty years man you been flattened against Satan ever since you got here but Satan has been battling against you before you ever got here he's been battling your family he's been battling your heritage he's been battling your lineage breaking down and battling your belief system of your family figuring out your weaknesses what you are and what you are not trying to figure out what you're tempted by you see if Satan can't get you with alcohol here throw cigarettes on you and if we can't get you with cigarettes he'll throw drugs on you and if we can't get drugs on you he will try to tear down your health and if they can't get to your health he'll try to tear down your mind your reasoning your affection and on your imagination and your conscience and all of these things and if he can't get there he'll move on to the soul round that's his ultimate goal is to get you to dapped because there's two realms there whether you choose to believe or doubt God and Satan is doing his best to get to that soul realm to get you to doubt and be an unbeliever and if he can't get to your soul realm he'll go to your family because if Satan can't get you as a husband he'll go to your wife he'll go to your children and if he can't get your children he'd go to your friends and if he can't get you to fall by looking at your friends he'll go to your church family and if he can't get you to fall by looking at your church family he'll start tearing away every bit of faith that he can and try to rob you from the Word of God he'll steal your time from reading he'll steal your time from praying he'll steal your time from the message he's been on your turf for a mighty long time and it's time to kick him off he's been on your territory for a mighty long time and it's time to kick him off he's not satisfied with just tearing down your health he wants everything that y'all pay what's your time he wants you money he wants your energies and he will use any means possible to get to you he will use the ones that are closest to you to tear you down he will use the ones closest to you in your ranks to get you to disbelieve this are you with me tonight people that you never thought that would turn away he will use those he will use those to try to get you to doubt you see Satan is grabbing at every opportunity that he can to take the believers out of the category of believers and put them and make believers or unbelievers but I say Satan back up in the name of Jesus [Applause] he go try to put cancer on you he go try to put all kinds of diseases on you he's going to try to rob him but I want you to do this that when you see these things coming I want you to say thank you because it's just proving who you are you see it's an evidence of who you are when Satan is attacking you on what you are and what you believe in it proves who you are you see if safety net got you he's warring against you he proves to me that he ain't got me because he's tried to beat me every which way from Sunday but praise God I'm in the house of God tonight praise God he tried to keep you from church tonight but praise God you're here let him do his worst thank you it's an evidence of Who I am hallelujah no doubt no doubt when when the mother Mary when his salutations were brought to her by the angel no doubt she had her critics no doubt she had her scholars no doubt maybe in her own family structure there were people that questioned her what she what she believed and I know Mary maybe you and Joseph had maybe without had some Mexican that night and had some spices it just messed up your dreams and maybe you threw some cinnamon all on you coffee or something and made you dream all kinds of different things and and you know maybe maybe this made maybe you don't really know what you're talking about is man you know maybe it wasn't an angel maybe it was just a dream Mary are you really sure that it's you are you sure that he said that you would bring forth the Sun and that you would call his name Jesus but the proof was in the pudding the proof was in the pudding that when she walked up to to see her cousin Elizabeth and when she'd went up layer everything that the angel had told her she began to give her salutation to her cousin Elizabeth and if there was no power behind Mary's testimony what was about to take place would have never been confirmed by Almighty God you see if God is in it he'll be confirmed and when Mary begin to give her testimony of what the angel told her her cousin Elizabeth said Mary when you spoke the name Jesus there had been a dead baby in my womb you see if there was no power behind the name of Jesus John would have stayed there dead but there was so much proof in what Mary had said that the evidence was in the mother lode that there was power in the name of Jesus it brought life to it did womb life to a dead baby hello oh well maybe no doubt Mary had her skeptics around her I said I don't know about all this I could hear Mary say you just wait nine months and you'll see you just wait and see this won't be some ordinary boy but this war he will be able to take his toys he will be able to take his toys and make the giraffe the toy giraffe make it walk make the toy elephant and make it walk this boys of a different kind and if you don't believe that I could hear Mary say just wait 33 years and watch him die he will cry like a human he will be in pain like a man he will be beat like a man he'll scream like a man he'll die like a man but he'll raise like God hello here we find today that there's such a falling away it seems to be that people are not interested like they used to be they're following the fundamental facts of the Bible there seem to be drifting and I think it's I think all ministers who love the Word of God and know that that's the only standard in which we can be assure that were right it's the only standard and we can be assured that we're right the reason I stand here before you tonight is not because I believe I'm right but because the Bible says I should be here I wouldn't preach to you about a bride that can overcome unless the Bible said it I couldn't I wouldn't preach I couldn't preach to you that God is the same yesterday today and forever unless the Bible said it the reason why we believe this message is because it's backed up by the Lord of all mighty caught let the devil do what he wants to but this message is thus saith the Lord [Applause] a mother lode maybe you're not familiar with the term but the mother a mother lode is a principle vein of an ore or a mineral a vein may be of gold of silver of copper and different very valuable materials of the land it is a when when someone says that they have hit the mother lode they're basically saying I just got rich overnight they are saying that they have found a channel that will produce unlimited wealth when they're saying that I have hit the mother lode you know you know that they're on top of something great and in the United States there is actually a portion of the states that is called the mother lode of California a mother lode is most famously name given to a long alignment of hardrock gold deposits stretching from Northwest to southeast in the Sierra Nevada of California and this mother lode it was discovered in the early 1850s during the gold rush and the California the California mother lode is a zone from about one point five to six kilometers which is almost point nine three to three point seven three miles wide to a hundred and twenty miles long is this mother lode but they had found it in the 1850s and by the year of 1851 there was over two and a half million ounces of gold that had been been extracted from the mother lode and within nine years nearly 24 million ounces of gold had been extracted but you know before the rush and before the fan of this there was somebody that had to find evidence that there was something there he'd been laying there maybe maybe for thousands of years laying there in that spot but somebody had to come across it and to prove that there was a mother lode there that there was a vein or a channel that would release unlimited wealth UCA was a paid a showing that they were just scratching the surface maybe they just panned a little bit of gold and they said and you know what maybe there's a little bit more here maybe we'll dig down a little bit further you know that's what I happened what happened to me when I come to him is I had just been scratching the surface as it were I maybe had glimpses of him maybe I had experiences of him but it was only showing me that there was more to come I could remember walking down to the altar and feel the anointing on my flesh and watching it watching it move on my life but yet it did not live in my soul I couldn't watch it as he would anoint me to sing or maybe I know him made a test of hi or maybe just to be able to speak he would anoint maybe he wouldn't he would drive me down to the altar of the anointing what was it showing me he was an evidence that there was more to come I can still remember the night that Dan Daisley preached his last sermon here and brother Mike walls was in the meeting I can remember when they come and laid their hands on my only altar and the anointing touched my life I still remember that it was in evidence he was in evidence of a mother loaf I was scratching the surface but when I got there on the streets of Canada I got a hold of the mother lode and he they never run dry I've been digging at it ever since and more keeps coming out he never left me because he's the same yesterday today and forever and the God that made me overcome last week he's the God that may be overcome this week and he'll make me overcome next week what is it I found the one that I've been looking for whoa maybe that's you tonight maybe you've just been scratching the surface all your life but I want to tell you it's an evidence and there's more for you you ain't got to be one of the followers that was just following him for the meal follow him for the 5,000 feed the 5,000 or following him so that he could just touch your body you ain't gotta follow him just for the benefit package you can follow him and he live on the inside of you you got to dig at it there was somebody that found that mother low but they had to dig it out there's all types of channels in that mother lode in California that it reaches all the way down and maybe thousands of meters out that it reaches all the way up but somebody knew that it was there somebody had to dig it out maybe I'll say it to you like this has believers that you understand there was somebody that came with a message of justification it was just evidence that there was more to come and when Wesley came with sanctification it was evidence that there was more to come and when Pentecost came with the restoration of the gifts it was an evidence that there was a mother low coming that Christ himself would disperse himself in this stay I've been told I'm wrong for preaching that Christ is here but I declare to you by the word of the Lord that Jesus Christ is here [Applause] if you want sir evidence look around healings miracles transformations diseases and tumors fallen off the evidence is right before you I ain't got to see the pillar fire to know he's here his word said he'd be here and I just happened to take him at his word if you want to dig it out you want to see your family get it you got to start digging make your valley full of ditches hit a tin can dig it out hit an old rotten board dig it out if the TV's in your way dig it out if the phone's in your way dig it out fellow go Satan don't let Satan rob you you remember a sermon brother on preach take your back don't wait for it take it back we got too many delinquent parents that are letting their children do anything they want to it's time that mothers and fathers start taking it back start digging and ask your child don't want to dig it out dig it out children if your mama refuses to dig it out you get down there with a double-barrel shotgun hold this shotgun in your hand and get a shovel and start digging out for your whole family what I'm saying what I'm saying is proving that we are right on top of the mother lode [Applause] but a lot of people don't want to put their fur into it they don't want to do it they don't wanna they don't put the time and study into it well if God don't give me the Holy Ghost in 15 minutes I guess he don't want to give it to me you're absolutely wrong lot of people just want to ride in and on the profits coattail right in on the pastures experience but then I add the pastures got it that means I'll get it someday this should be your hour stop waiting for it it's here I mean people don't want to die for it too many people don't want to lay on the altar for it but I want to tell you if you see somebody they don't want to go all the way don't you dare give up you see somebody that tells you that this message they write don't you dare give up on your belief there's gonna be scholars and critics rise up on the scene don't you dare back off of your belief just because somebody else falls or somebody else disbelieves you keep marching onward Christian soldiers you get back in line we're right around the corner we got the last smile and we're running all the way don't back up don't turn around after Jesus died on the cross and was placed in a borrowed tomb no doubt the critics of scoffers the Pharisees and the Sadducees was having themselves a big old time maybe no doubt dancing in the street and partying in the street said that one that said that he was raised on the third day he's dead and gone now what was it it was an evidence that there was more coming they were enjoying themselves on Friday and maybe old Saturday but I got bad news for them sunday was coming they tried to put him in a bar Oh - they tried to seal it and put soldiers around it but you can't keep Jesus in a dead tomb well I'm oh preach to you tonight he's carnal believers they were proving that there was a motherhood laying right there in the ground ooh that something was about to break loose the Prophet said that when you find a bogus dollar where's that speak to you will you take all your money out of the bank and throw it in the river because you found a bogus dollar that be stupid that bogus dollar only means that there's a real dollar it's made off of and Pentecost is full of carnal impersonations but what does it mean you see somebody that can't live it what's it mean you see somebody that won't don't want it what's it mean it means that there's a real one there's some way if somebody trying to impersonate something that somebody else really has it's only a meal tickets only something that's genuine behind the thing that somebody is trying to impersonate prophet would say the Pentecost was just a scaffold worth it was just a scaffold work that was to be tore down after the house was built it was just a pay dust showing that there was a mother lode laying there we've seen all types of counterfeits and all types of fakes that's one thing I hate is a fake I can't stand it when somebody tries to sell me a ripoff or not call for a fake sure I've had it tried done to me and all types of different business deals men try to sell me something that they says worth $500 but it ain't worth 5 bucks you see you got to know what you're looking at if you don't know what you're looking at you'll get sold on a dummy but I want you to know what we're preaching to unite he's not a dummy it's not some mannequin that's just stiff and laying there in the corner but this is a living god that's that's breathing and acting and brooding yeah there's all types of mannequins that people's dressed up in suits it says that the days of miracles is past all there is is a bunch of mannequins and to me they ain't got the breath inline inside of them to let it loose but praise God they're Samir that stand behind suits that stand behind some blue jeans that don't matter if they dressed up on Saturday dressed up on Sunday they believe that there's a Living God that this message is him rugged man of God rugged women of God that the devil try to rob this from them that stand up as a backup Satan I know in whom I have believed and I'm not ashamed of it well glory he remember when the Prophet was dealing with a man he would call was a bosom friend to him dr. Reid head this dr. Reid head was a was a well-educated man that had what that it could blast through the walls of degrees and he was dr. Reid head was dealing with a young Muhammad and man one time he was telling for you go back why don't you get some of that good heartfelt religion you know once you come over and serve Jesus and he said he said no disrespect basically is what I'm just paraphrasing here there's no disrespect said between your religions or whatnot he said but we can produce as much psychology as you Christians can we can produce the same thing you say you got joy oh we got joy you say you got happiness we got happiness we said what I our jesus is alive though he said we'll prove it then he said will you believe it because he lives in our heart is who approve that to me how's that possible and they began to tell him said talk to him about mark 16 and tell him 7 now jesus said that these signs will follow them that belief and dr. Reed had said he said now say young sir said we being theologians we understand that mark 16 is uninspired he said what kind of book are you reading then if it's uninspired then why are you reading it if one portion of the Bible was wrong then why you're reading it here this man was putting a so-called believer in this place he began to tell him what Jesus said over in John 14 that the worst that I do so you do also he said then and begin to tell him said you know the works that I do would be believing on him things of that manner he said when you can prove to me that jesus is alive come back and tell me and dr. Reed hid went to brother Branham he hung his head and he was walked away defeated he walked away defeated didn't know how to answer the man and brother ban himself he began to lead him to the Holy Ghost give him give him instruction how to receive the Holy Ghost he said he got down there on the floor and they got to praying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost came on him and he had a coffee table there and the glass broke out of it when the Holy Ghost came on him but just because dr. Reed head couldn't back up what the Bible says does not mean that the Bible wasn't right I'm using scriptures tonight that so-called people that walked away from the message have preached before but just because they say it ain't right doesn't mean it ain't right I purposely have done this tonight to show the devil to a debate and a challenge that there's a people that do believe it is right and come back up what the Bible says he's the same Holy Ghost same power same life working in us doing the same actions what them people are is just evidence of you and me we're a true reflection our character has been molded by him when Christ was the expression of God himself and now we are here expressing deity we are here you see when they would find those when those men would find that gold they would be dross in it that they had to beat out so that it would so that it would be fer perfect they would turn that gold over and beat it and beat it and beat it just to get a true reflection and when they could look in that gold and see themselves they knew that it was ready God has beat us back and forth so that we would throw out a true reflection of him and if we're not so in him we need to go back and get a little bit more dross beat out of us but I don't like that but any child but any child that does not stand correction was it so is the best but Oh blessed is he that endures you see character is molded by him power without character satanic but power with character is fit to rule there's a reason why God chose you before the foundation or you're a reflection of him you were showing him before the foundation of the world that you were fit to rule before there was an atom or a molecule spoke into place we've seen enough counterfeits in this day we've seen enough men trying to reproduce or produce a born-again experience by intellectualism and it's always fun it's always come to its demise we don't want to be a Judas terian we follow him because of truth not for the script back the Bible says in March 16 and 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe them that believe them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they so take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is a promise to believers not to unbelievers this is a promise that is given to you that that by his name these things would be done and now the name of Jesus is not some magic word will we go around speak in the name of Jesus and and things just take place and we happen to use it haphazardly when we pray at nighttime we just speak and hope things are going to happen but as sons and daughters of God we realize that our identification is in that name we recognize that salvation is in that name that healing is in that name we recognize that deliverance is in that name we recognize that at that name that ever needs shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord we know that at that name that demons will flee sickness will flee the devil has to move the name of Jesus Christ but it's not because just somebody on the street says well what Jesus do this or Jesus do that when you go around just speak in the name of Jesus God don't have to honor that when you do it in vain but God has to honor that when there is a life behind it and when you embody the Holy Spirit Himself Zoe himself God has to back up what you say why because you are ambassadors of heaven that when you speak all of heaven is behind you and all hell may be against you but all of heaven is for you young people if you can ever realize that if you truly get filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not just talking about it on your flesh where you enjoy coming to church or enjoy coming to the youth events I'm talking about truly baptized truly died out and when the Holy Ghost lives on the inside of you I want you to know that there's a power that's backing you up you ain't got to worry about walking down the aisles you ain't gotta worry about people making fun of you there will be a life behind you that will back up what you say it'll back up their life you live but don't you dare back off your own life or back off your belief just because somebody else unbelievers just because they can't produce these works don't you dare back off of it we've had all types of carnal impersonations in this day a matter of fact brother Branham said that this is a day of carnal impersonations that this is a day of matching he said you paint your steps red and watch your neighbor would do it he'll just hey just has to paint his red you swap your Chevrolet for a Ford and for business we'll get good that's right just the way everybody wants to match the other one and that's where we find the day that we get too much impersonations and when you do that you're always in trouble you cannot live the other fellas life we cannot impersonate something we must be just what we are I love brother Tim Pruett I love brother Timothy and I love brother Ron Spencer and brother Donnie Reagan but I can't be them so what's the good of me trying to impersonate them or them trying to impersonate me what good is he going to do for me to try to impersonate brother Branham if I'm not brother branham hello come on somebody come on somebody but what would it do if you were totally embody the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would no longer be you trying to put it on but him living it out through you [Music] we got people telling us that we can't sing only believe because that was only the Prophet song we got people telling us that we shouldn't lay hands on the sick because only the Prophet could do that tell me where in the scripture it ever said so [Applause] I want my experience to match God's Bible so that's the kind of Matson that we ought to do match up with the standard of God you look over in Acts chapter 19 when Paul goes down to the city of Ephesus there and Paul finds finds believers that were following John's teachings and Paul begins to talk to them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said we know not whether they hear we have not heard whether there be any Holy Ghost yet and then Paul recognized that there was something different in their experience you see he began to ask them then how was you baptized you see he realized that there was an evidence of something more that was to come and he began to take them to the teachings of baptism they said that if you repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and Paul and they went and were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and Paul laid his hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost and Paul went up to the synagogue and he began to preach and preach boldly there for a space of three months and you see it as always the word that does the separating he began to persuade men to come to the kingdom of God and then brought about disputing XANA and controversies because the word was doing the separating in that day but the Bible says in acts 19 11 follow along with men god rocks but some miracle special miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought under the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and diseases departed from them I've got a little bit of rebound here and the evil spirits went out of them then certain of the Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adjure you notices here these vagabonds exorcists begin to take upon themselves to go lay hands on those that had evil spirits saying we adjourn you by Jesus whom Paul preaches and there were seven sons of one Steve I Jew and a chief of the priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded and this was known to all the Jews and the Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear fell on them and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified and many that believed came and confessed showing their deeds many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before old men you see what took place they had a good old-fashioned burner and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver so mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed the hour is here when right and wrong is being made manifest you see Ephesus was a sinner of for for black magic it was a place where witchcraft for it was practiced where they would give out magical formulas to give wealth and happiness and success sounds like a lot of lay on us here today where psychologists try to preach you happier try to teach you happy by by doing this or by creating some kind of yoga mat that you can lay down and breathe seven times and you'll get happy let me tell you I don't believe that'll make you happy but here in the city of Ephesus these seven sons of sceva when Nepal when they seen Paul's anointing and the power behind the teachings of Paul they were impressed and astonished were the power the name of Jesus which worked through Paul what was it there was something real about Paul you want some fake you see the thing about the gospel he just lives it ain't got to be propped up no matter who stands for it or no matter who denies it no matter how many come no matter how many go the gospel still stands and still has power behind it and you see here were unconverted people that were attaching themselves to the gospel desiring that power desiring a work of the Holy Ghost but they never allowed Christ to reign predominant in their life and they never come to grips with the message the man said we didn't come to talk about it we come to get in it I'm afraid of too many people come and just set on the pews I'm afraid that we got too many young people are too many middle-aged people that are that are holding onto somebody's coattail yeah they see it's true yeah they see it living in the past so she as they see it and living in the elders but what about them there's too many people that's just holding on just to well it happened 30 years ago what about right now well days gone by we've seen a power of God what about in your life don't you worry about days gone by don't worry about that don't worry about your neighbor you worry about you well bless God I tried what you need to do is stop trying you just tried is proven to you that it's evidence there's more to go if you just let go just let go just let go take a deep breath let go you won't live through it you gonna live through it I'm living proof you can live through it you can overcome but we got too many people caught up on virtual realities you got too many people today that actually go back in the photo books go back in the family photos book and they're so used to the world that they live in that they actually scroll in on those old photographs with their fingers in paper photographs and they realize wait a minute that's not my phone that's an old photograph that's the kind of world that we live in I thought I had my phone in the hand they don't know nothing about them polaroid pictures they're in a sacred thing and make sure come out right take that picture man that thing was awesome you had to know that you were smiling perfect before they took that thing because if you didn't it was a lasting memory that's stuck with you man my hair wasn't right let me take 42 more pictures so I get it right but too many people are caught up in the world of virtual realities and they have no clue about real life anymore they don't know about overcoming anymore because they're caught up on an Internet they're caught up with ideas on the internet and all they realize is a virtual reality that there's their life that gaming's their life that's speaking to somebody on internet is their life what about the person you're sitting across from let me get back over here for you murder me tonight but it's time that we come to grips with what we're preaching here this ain't some dead letter but this is a spirit of truth that is being preached to you you come to grips with this message and it will produce the same life these men would call him in the name of Jesus without even knowing him personally and when to cast out an evil spirit and that spirit cried out Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you I wonder tonight if that would be you if you begin to come up here and somebody had an evil spirit on them and you laid your hand on it and that evil spirit cried out who are you you can answer the question but you see these were Cardinal impersonators who did not know the purpose of God what were they doing they were lacking Zoe they were lacking the true power of Pentecost and an evil spirit prevailed over them you find it so many times a day that men are prevailed over by evil spirits because there's no life there there's no life to back up what they're saying but the Bible tells me in Hebrews 11 and 6 that without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek them you see without faith you can't please God he is the one that created the heavens and earth he is the creator he that cometh to God must believe that he is the creator you see faith in God's Word equals power faith in God's Word moves Alton's faith in God's Word catches the revelation of this message faith in God's Word shake the kingdom of health faith in God's Word brings the promises to pass faith in God's Word brings God to your need faith in God's Word tells you that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me faith in God's Word tells you that this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith your faith will tell you that by His stripes we are healed it's a time that we got to fight for it and contend for the faith are you with me or not it's a time to start fighting for what you believe in there's gonna be people that walk right beside you that will not believe this but it's an evidence it's an evidence that there's a mother lode there may be you've been that I'm preaching to you just for a moment I'll get back over I'll get back over here on one of the things of God where you who you all crucify me but maybe maybe had been you'd have been raised in the message being a great basically great raised from diapers all the way up in the message but you ain't never had that true Pentecostal experience you see what you need is that good old-fashioned dying out sin kill and religion we're an old-fashioned Pentecostal experience comes into your life and makes this message real and you start speaking to your mountains and you start speaking to the storms in your life and you start speaking and you watch and you will you start speaking to that red sea and watch the red sea you start speaking to the mountains in your life the reason why people don't speak to their mountains is because they love looking at the mountain because they love and enjoy the mountain that is standing before them but you ought to have a desire to get rid of that sin in your life you ought to have a desire to kick the devil out stop falling in love with the devil that you're sleeping with and start kicking him out hello somebody it's time because it's the rapture is here Jesus said in John 14 believers now not that I'm in the father and the father mean the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe us me that I'm in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake verily verily I say unto you that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall I do because I go unto my father and whatsoever he shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son that if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it when I said it and nothing came to pass all hail was against this truth all hail was against this revelation our guns are pointed against this message it's just a proof of what we've got brother you just let something on the phenomenal side start and watch how every rogue hound inhale goes to hollering at him craving blood I tell you Peter preached the sermon on the day of Pentecost that three thousand souls were saved and the devil never even moved out of his bed that's right oh well let them alone but he passed through the Gator called beautiful the next day and healed a man crippled from his mother's womb and all hail turn loose on him throwed him into jail kept it in there overnight put him in the prison in the inner cell because the phenomenon the devil said I can't let this thing get started now divine healing if they do they're really knocked my props out from under me that's right because I might fool them around with a little theology once in a while but I sure can't fool that real thing that comes out and the people see it done I've just stopped this before the group gets on the scene and they never stop the death and they can't stop it now God's gospel will move home and all at home and when there is no more heavens and when there is no more earth that word will still remain the same Satan's tried to throw up every blow to a rock but blow dry road blocking his way in the way of this message and the message keeps running it over he's tried to raise every demonic power in front of it but the message keeps running at over why because it's a living God that is backing us up you and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for a spoken word that placed us in this position Satan wants to destroy us he'd like to push us off a cliff I know where I'm standing that right now because he's here he wants to push you off a cliff and to keep you from believing this but he can't destroy you brother Donny because you are an eternal being you are not a carnal impersonator like those in acts 19 the is him yeah there's been a whole lot there's been a whole lot of fakes and counterfeits it was proven to us that there is a real Virginia wine baptism of the Holy Ghost yeah a bunch of donkeys bunch of donkeys can't prove where they came from but some mules can't prove where they came from why because they ain't got no pedigree they just ha ha around because they don't know who the mammy is and they don't know who their poppy is but I love a good genuine thoroughbred horse that knows who their father is knows who their mama is they know where they came from and they know where they're going the devil tried telling me that I was going to hell but I didn't come from hell I came from God I'm going back to God let the heathen rage let he'll be against me let demons be against me so a hosting kept me I will not fear for this one thing I have desired to dwell in the house of the Lord forever he proved to you that hell was going to be against you but they will not overcome you but you will overcome it let the musicians go the one that overcome death hell and the grave is here the one that backs up his word is here if God was not in it he would not confirm it there's a little spotting in Nevada it's a little city by the name of Carly and there were thousands of settlers out there that ran through the city in Karlin while they were on their way to the gold rush many of them paying for gold in that city to no avail they've been through there they looked for it but they couldn't find it by penny they couldn't find no gold there so they just moved on and moved on and what would be one of the greatest gold deposits in the earth was laying right there they were walking right over top of it and here the greatest deposit of gold was undiscovered while everybody just kept walking past it today the minds of Carling of the Carlin Trend are among the world's largest and the richest gold producers the Carlin Trend has produced more than sixty million ounces of gold to date and many millions more are still lying in the ground waiting to be mined at today's market the gold would be worth Oh over 87 billion dollars they look for they paying for it they walked right over top of it but they couldn't find it but just because somebody else said that it wasn't there didn't mean it wasn't there just because somebody else says this a right doesn't mean it a right just such because somebody else don't want to live it just because somebody can't get the baptism of the Holy Ghost because they afraid to die out to themselves doesn't mean that you can't get it just you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost shows to me that there's something great laying right there if you want the Holy Ghost I'm gonna tell you it's an evidence that the Holy Ghost is for you if you want to be healed it's an evidence that healing is for you if you want to be delivered it's an evidence that deliverance is for you if you want to god that'll wipe away all the sin of your past it proves to me that there is a God that can wipe away all of your sins all they do mistakes all of your failures let everybody walk around it and say it ain't possible but as for me and my house we have found a mother lode we have found a pearl of great price and I have sold everything I sold everything to buy this field to get this pearl well Satan is against me let him be against you let him biggest you I was reading an article this morning when I first got up about maybe a plant saw god bless your name tonight I was reading over his article in these these fisheries his fisheries were trying to figure out a way to keep the cod fish and they had been catching it taking it to take it to the spots of distribution how to keep it fresh and and then they tried freezing it but when they froze the cod and it lost its flavor they try putting it in live tanks and let it let it just swim till they got to its destination but they found that when they put these fish in lot of tanks and make the fish all mushy because it was just stagnant setting steel but finally they came up with an avenue to keep the fish fresh they put the fish in a live well and they were transported to their destination but in that destination when they would ship it to its spot they would put the enemy the codfish's enemy the catfish they would place it in the lab well with that caught fish and that catfish would chase that con fish all around that laughed that live whale and it would keep that fish fresh your trout you're a rainbow trout and the enemy it shows you that God is what we keep your revival friends when the enemy's chasing after you you see there's all kinds of things that would cause you to be stagnant in your experience but God has allowed an enemy that can't get ahold of you and can't destroy you to chase after you to keep your experience fresh it may seem like the enemy's on your heels and he's trying to destroy your tribe at any moment is just gonna grab you but it's just showing you that God is keeping your experience fresh you see if you wouldn't having troubles you wouldn't be praying that God is not the author of confusion or trouble but God has allowed things to happen so that you'll stay ready they you'll stay hungry you see another never happened here you
