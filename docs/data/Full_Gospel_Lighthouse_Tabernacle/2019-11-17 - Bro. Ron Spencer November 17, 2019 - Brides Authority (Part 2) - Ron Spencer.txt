========================================

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we sure love you with all of our hearts good to see you I think we have the lysis morning and just a sign of always make sister calling that just shows you that God is a God of great contrast with Joshua chapter one this evening I found this text interesting is it's been kind of on the plate for a few weeks and what we speak tonight and found it interesting that brother Guido's son was the first time that he spoke he spoke today this morning at their church and he had the same text that I'm getting ready to read to you I always find little things like that real interesting and so amen amen amen Joshua chapter one and verse five part two from last night these are some powerful words there's some not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage under this people shalt out divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be strong and very courageous that thou mayst observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goest the book of the law shall not depart our mouths but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that phrase prosperous and then shalt thou have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest I'd like for you to read that last verse with me tonight have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord that God is with thee whithersoever thou goest that's powerful a man you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word hallelujah hallelujah now this is our promised land this is our promised land why don't you hold your prayer promiseland up tonight This Is It this is the greatest book this is the greatest book that there is in the world are you with me and you're in this book before there was ever a molecule or a star the promises were you were yours and anew you turned not from the left hand or turned to the right end don't be dismayed be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord that God is with thee whether so ever thou Ghost LeBron said remember our God it is still the God of Elijah he is still the God that this distilled the God that ever was he is the same God he moves in the same cycle he does the same thing he is the same yesterday today and forever remember those words he is the same yesterday today and forever the man said God's given every sick person in here divine healing every one of you Jesus was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we were healed it's yours it's yours but you'll have to fight for every inch of it to possess it everywhere the soles of your feet travel God told Joshua I have given you footprints means possessions let's move in it tonight let's go in footprints or possessions let's take every edge of ground that God give us if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Peter said the promises unto you and your children to them that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call footprints this possession let's go get it it's ours Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever less possess it the works that I do shall you do also less possess it it's God's promise don't look at circumstances don't look at how hard it is let's possess the land now what is it it's easy to feel the power of God to see it when you believe but then when it comes to a showdown are you able to possess the thing that you profess that you have that's the thing of it brother let's got them we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll have to fight for every inch of it don't be afraid don't stay back oh well they say well we believe the days of miracles is past oh I don't know don't do that that don't look like a child of Abraham no matter how far along the promise seemed to hold out it went 25 years but instead of Abraham getting weaker he got stronger [Applause] for he knowed the longer that it was the greater miracle that it was not remember if God made a promise God made the promise and you believe it I don't care what takes place it's yours I mean believers do we have here tonight fight the devil on every ounce of ground that he stands on walk over and take it take the sword of the Lord take the sword of the word God's promises it's true now let me just give you a little background here just for a moment of where I stand and I've actually I almost feel like I got a chip on my shoulder here this evening when I preached last night and I watched how God moved this service and God designed that whole in and orchestrated all of that we step out my faith grab a hook of our promise of God but you know who whispered in my ear a lot today sure it is and so I told him just wait I told Andrew earlier today I said just way he's whispered in my ear today so I'm going to cut his head off [Applause] and you know what the devil I'll tell you what if it don't happen no matter God said it you got to remember that man's not in charge of this God's in charge of this and the scripture said these son shall follow them that believe we are believers not just the preacher but we are believers God's promises is true I love this and I want the devil to hear this it's reason applause and said that nothing can stop it they're God's promises I got a text this afternoon before coming to church brother Jason Jackson there was a man that we prayed for him in in the June meeting but there Jason spoke about him last week he was a live about an hour hour and a half away and he's a just a local guy and he walked into a car dealership and and he was trying to get a vehicle for his family and and he said that it you know that he was after he was dining at stage four cancer and he was dying he he he needed something for them for the future and he said I've been to all these churches and none of them believing divine healing he laid hands on the sick he said come to mind so that Saturday night he came to service he was sitting about seven or eight rows back with his two little girls and his wife and you could tell that they've never been in a service like what was going on and I prayed for people around the altar I just walked right over I walked the aisle right in front of him and I walk her right over and Eilis I begin to talk to him and I'd begin to ask him are you a believer do you believe what the word said do you believe the promises of God he said absolutely I believe I said well done let's just come out in the aisle here I want to have prayer for you and I begin to pray for him and when I begin to pray the power of God fell then I prayed for his daughters and I prayed for his wife what a report ticket today that same car salesman ran into that man and he said you'll like this but the Shannon he he said how are you doing he said huh that's over with I've already went back to work for the railroad [Music] a year ago brother Tim told us this it in in January or told us this in the at their fall meeting there was a man by the Kenneth Middleton that they diagnosed that cancer said he was going to die at any time and he got right down to the point of death and he and right before their family camp meeting last year not this year but last year in October he said he went in to see him and and he said that brother Kenneth what do you believe what are you wanting to do he said I want to get strong enough to get back into those meetings and he said I want to be at every one of those meetings and on Wednesday night he was sitting there in that wheelchair he's been in a wheelchair for many years he was sitting there in that wheelchair I want to report to you a couple of weeks ago he went to the doctor and they were checking his blood and there's a man with cancer that's destroying his body and that doctor said I'm I'm envious of you I'm really jealous he said your blood is better than my blood now I'll give you that testimony because brother Tim prayed for him on Wednesday night and brother brother Kenneth has had 35 heart stents 35 heart stents and the doctor has give him up and said there's just no more that they can do for him and he was prayed for on Wednesday night and I prayed as well here and I'm sure others prayed around the world prayed for him and just in just yesterday we was working he good he went right back to work and he works in the post office and he was sitting at his desk and he had to take a nitroglycerine pill and and this morning I believe it was this morning he got up and he was sitting on the side of the bed and sister Gabrielle there down seeing their family mouths but sister Gabrielle's mother baiz just went home to be with the Lord she walked in the room as a young woman and stood there for quite a little while brother Tim and I were conversing just only just a little bit of going and I said I want you to know that's good news in a lot of directions if God raises him up are you with me oh I feel I preached into now let me to stay when you start seeing that that tells you where you're from it don't matter when you go it tells you that I'm going to that land if I'm seeing those in that dimension that's over they got their new bodies I'm going behalf if God made a promise God gave the promise and you believe it I don't care what takes place it's yours fight the devil on every ounce of ground and stand on it walk over and take it and take the sword of the word God's promises are true nothing can stop it they're God's promises and he give us his promises just like he did the Hebrew children the Pentecostal church Danish Martinez he said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever can we walk up there and take a hold of God's promise and since sane it's the truth I claim it I own it it's mine God gave it to me now I'm preaching on God's authority but what good is it for God to give you authority if you don't use it let me say that again because it obviously didn't land maybe something's wrong this Mike God's given you authority he's given you supreme power under control of the Holy Ghost in your life he's giving you his infinite word but what good is it for him to give it to you if you don't use it are you in the now I can tell you that you are the bride of Jesus Christ you must believe it but you must do more than believe it you gotta act on it maybe the rest of you'll get with me in just a little bit you've got to not just believe it Baptist belief but I want to really let you know that never believes he believes in one God and he trembles let me just say there's no greater believer than when he stood there and was defeated night after night tens of thousands of tongues he believed God sent a prophet in this day because he had to fight with him and listen he may wish for a lot of things in your ear but he believes who you are can I get it again now even he believes who's who you are or he would not be contesting you all the time because you are his worst nightmare Clara well Judas go ahead and point to the chest I am Satan's worst nightmare now don't shiver in your boots now what he's going to do to you de Marsh end up on your door don't crawl back into a cave or a turtle in a shell and shaking your boots don't be afraid GOx with you with him said what an assurance of a solid rock the resurrection of our blessed lover of the Lord Jesus nothing can destroy it it is the planet it is the seed of God it is the purpose of God to give us this blessed Holy Spirit it is the purpose of God to show us signs and wonders and miracles it's the purpose of God and nothing can destroy it you remember when brother Brandon was standing there he said later he said we standing over a little finished boy and he said I told them if he's not off of the ground in five minutes you called me a false prophet he said that devil could have lined up every devil in hell now this is a statement he said the devil could have lined up every devil in hell and he could not have stopped that are you with me now let me just give you a matter of fact most of us has never fought with old Lucifer himself we're not powerful enough to really bring out the big boy but he'll send you some of his his his soldiers and they'll come to fight but remember if you can get this one scripture in your heart greater is He that is in you than he that is in the whole world [Applause] oh yeah you remember when brother branham prayed for thee the maniac or we stood that maniac and he fell across his feet he said that man the demon that was in him was the chief of all the demons and when he fell the rest of them failed let me just say chief or general or whatever they are greater is He that is in me now he don't have to fear this flesh but the god that's on the inside of you and I this greater this flesh may die tomorrow and rotten be put in a tomb before the week's over that don't matter but the seed that's on the inside of me will live eternally brother man said God's Word is it's worth no more than his word you've heard me quote this and if his word is no good he is no good if your word it's no good if I can't put no confidence in what you say you're no good but you're just as good as your word and if God is just as good as his word is and I as a Christian believer I believe that the Bible is inspired and it is a written by the Holy Spirit and it is the infallible Word of God if I didn't believe that I couldn't go home right now are you with me it is the infallible Word of God and God is under obligation to his word and to the believer that will accept his word and any word is a seed if you are accepted in your heart by faith and believe it and confess it God will bring it to pass what was just said you believe the Word of God and you allow it to go through your lips and confess it and believe it if f Bosworth would tell the patient said you keep quoting this scripture until you did it if you abide in me and my words abide in you that's what it will and shall be done unto you you quote that scripture until you get it and then take up your bed and why are you with me my brother Brendan said this and let me just bring you a balance just now every man has an order of days we know that because we're born of Adam's curse but you can prematurely have death come not to your door but you don't have to go cuz that don't have control over you help me preach now I've had that come to my door they were going to harvest my organs are you with me but you as a body of believers talk about how powerful that you are you as a body of believers and men of God and brother Kim came commissioned with the Saint the prayers of the Saints walked into that room they were going to harvest my organs listen we ain't playing games now when they're talking about harvesting your organs they're not playing games it's over but I happen to need the organs that I'm using tonight and God still had a purpose for me are you with me now but you prayed and believed what about you brother on I put all my faith up to that point but there came a point I had no more control of it I want to live a life of faith that when I am no longer in control it's in control of me are you with me now sometimes you meet Christians you don't know which side they're on because your tongue tells who's really the Lord listen cancer is not greater than God I don't care how bad it is it's not greater than God heart conditions it's not greater than God sure to not be this it's not greater than God God is still God so I'm gonna give him the glory authority I don't know about you and how you operate in your personal life or how you go about your your study or the things that you do in your life I trust it's every day I trust it I trusted that you have a conversation with God every day but when I'm listening to the Prophet when he's preaching and he comes to a prayer I don't skip that prayer because brother Adam can say a whole lot in two paragraphs in prayer because this is God's prophet and God and he can preach a sermon in prayer and he kind of gives us some real nuggets here that I'd like to just share with you about prayer and you've heard me say it before but it's just like it's just like the Word of God it's good what God calls great what man calls great got calls foolish what man calls foolish God calls great it's by the foolishness of preaching men are saved so what we've got to do is get back into the program of God and find out after all what God wants us to do because it's an action thing to be a Christian it's an action thing this is a seven-day-a-week thing whether you live in a tent or you live in a palace are you with me whether you drive on whatever a dune buggy or you drive a Mercedes Benz it don't matter whether you have the biggest job or the lowest all they don't matter prayer is the key prayer is your communication with God now remember in the dark ages the church had been so blinded most Catholics they don't even read their Bible because they have a priest that reads the holy Rip for them so really most of them don't even know what it says let me let me just tell you spend time in your Bible so you know what God says to you don't just take my word for it or brother branham's word for you you spend time with it and in the dark ages it actually come to the point to where that they felt like they couldn't pray on their own they had to have the priests to pray and if we're not careful we'll be Catholics in our own way are you with me if we're not careful we'll think while only brother Ron can pray or only brother Andrew can pray but you're a believer you can pray sure I want to pray for you lay hands on you anoint you with all whatever takes place but I want you to understand you have authority with God and prayer is the key you are authorized you are authorized to pray and you've been given the power and he said that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings there's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb as powerful as predator do you know that one bomb can destroy 900 Mouse 1 atom bomb can destroy 900 miles Nashville would be about halfway in that circle if you're planning on staying when Russia starts dropping bombs I don't care how pretty your house is she's gonna be kablooey that's why the raps are so important now let's just think about the power of prayer Moses pray you've heard me go through this I don't want you to be able to repeat it yourself Moses prayed and Egypt the greatest soldiers in the entire world became fish-food Daniel prayed and lines laid down and those same lines would later eat the men that put him into prison Elisha prayed and outrun the fastest horses in Israel 40 mouths you talking about an athlete oh loaded was an athlete hello that that prophet of God felt the anointing of God and something transformed that body and he started running I'm gonna tell you what when you get in the spirit under the authority of God he can't run the fastest horses we get impressed too many times with athletes a man got nothing but temporary power God called this bright and invincible army he said that she knows what he wants done with the work the word is given now having the mind of God to know the objective and the motive and the purpose to put it in action he has given you a checkbook and given you authority to sign it and send it through the bank of heaven and the bank of heaven gives you unlimited power I'm not talking about Rolls Royces and Mercedes Benz and all of those different kinds of things I'm talking about power that's got eternal value to it Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still and gods never hearkened to the voice of a man like that ever before but even science can go back and find where that day actually took place I'll tell you why that took place he meant God himself and he said who's on the Lord Sun and he figured out it wasn't I'm on your side god but God come on church I'm on God's side it ain't necessarily that God's on my side but I don't gods you've heard us quote this for decades I pray it comes to us he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what is for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army he's talking about you sister Katie he's talking about you sister to Lord he's talking about you as a believer you're his hands you're his feet you're his eyes you're his mouthpiece on the earth those that have went on before are now counting on you from that realm are you with me from that realm are you with me now they've already ran their race and it's over and they're enjoying but now they're counting on you because without you and Island there's no body change are you with me we've got to complete the work and brother have said he's left things for us to do what are we going to do overcome this Laodicean age because it's us to give lukewarm and lazy and indifferent don't tell me you have to wrestle against those things how many do you struggle to pray how many do you struggle to pray how many of you struggle to reach your battle you can read all the Fox and CNN all the news and all that you can read that and go all the way through it fast read or slow read or whatever and then pick up your Bible it comes time to churches if you're not careful every circumstance in the world to come up trying to keep you away from church and it's a battle for you to just get into this parking lot walk in here but put choices out of the mind this is first place I've already planned on being here next Saturday [Applause] hallelujah brother Homer took care of all of the excuses of humanity I'm too weak and I'm hurting too bad and he took care of all of that for us and whatever it's you you want to come up with the layout of the house of God let me preach brother Homer took care of that for you and you said and watched him he would take those he'd take those there's pain pills and and he'd take them coming up the up the back bench so he could enjoy being in church there was times he probably didn't know his own name for a little bit but he decided I'm gonna be in church sister Nancy we didn't wrestle with him are you going tonight or not he was ready before we all was ready come on church let me just say this with authority he will judge a lot of people [Applause] with a lot of excuses if if everybody that said here that that that told me I'm going to be in church one of these days if Oliver here we would leave a cathedral but he will judge their excuses accidents came he didn't quit he didn't quit falling out of tree stands two and three times he didn't quit brother Thomas I believe he killed the deer even after his leg was gone didn't it he's called it calling giving it a shooting demonstration quit was not in his vocabulary for a real soldier of gun quit when it's not inside of us are you with me I've had people tell me said brother on why don't you slow down a bit a little bit you're getting a little older why don't you just slow down a little bit I will well I guess that there will be plenty of time down for me to rest as I get older I get to be a more of a delegator Andrew you do this Matthew you do this you do this you do this you do this so when it comes my turn I can give it all the energy in the world since the carny Oh get me in bed after a while she is yours you'll make sure I live through the night Andrew put me to work tomorrow quick it's not in the vocabulary now all I ask you is your pastor make you give it all the energy that I did this church ought to never cross their arms and sit there and go entertain me wrong church to be entertained this is a participation Church hallelujah and all of us were in a war here you gotta fight not fight one another but face the devil he said if Satan may pin you in a corner with cancer God will make a way of escape Satan me putting you under a car God will make a way of escape Satan me put your family away from you but God will make a way of escape the scripture said that our trials are more precious than how we we trade we traded precious chemicals or precious metals and you know I've watched the stock market every day for the last what 20 years and watch go go up and down and and silver go up and platinum and palladium and those kind of things watch that as it inches backwards and forwards but I've never saw trials on the board but the scripture says that our tribe is more precious than gold now you that are always concerned about your hobbies and your and your retirement funds and the things that you're invested in the trials that you're going through when you get the moly drugs and you get depressed and feel like quitting if you can only realize when you're going through that cast aside the depression cast aside thank God that he that confidence in you just send you do that all right but I don't get up tomorrow morning and go go God see me at around noon I never get up and pray for patience if you're a Christian little while you never pray for patients because patients to get patients you got to go through tribulations to get the character of patients come on church while David was waiting on Goliath he had to have a bear and he had to have the line while his brothers were looking the part acting the part bigger than he was greater soldiers and he was he was at training because there's a lot of people that look the part and act the part that ain't when the showdown came and they were scared and in their foxholes remember last night I told you I said we're not when I said people that prays that the people that pray how many of you that have prayed and naturally in a couple of days you saw that prayer come to pass and I told you look around to see who raised their hand that's the person to call to pray I don't want somebody praying for me thinking I'm done he was a good pastor he was a good guy thank you for letting me be - it's horrible what the devil is put into I want you to pray even if I'm dying God raised him up that he can preach another sermon pray fearless I want you to say that with me pray fearless pray fearless I want you to count it with your hands and I want you to say it pray fearless ten times give the Lord a great big hand right there now I want you to put it into action not just do it I want you put it into action now I want to bring you back to your remembrance how many times have you prayed and while you're praying the devil whispers in your ear how many times do you pray but you speak then a fearless matter almost reckless in your faith Peter said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give out thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood walk entered in with him into the temple walking and living and praising God there was a girl that came to the louisiana meetings and she was actually a preacher's daughter life had disappointed her she'd fell in sin done things it was kind of very horrible felt there was no way back and Satan to put a perplexing demon on her she had tried to take her life over and over again sister Connie you know this girl and she would cut her wrists and cut her cut her arms and she became a cutter I don't know if you've ever heard of that or not she would try to take her life and she would she would cut herself and watch herself bleed you know she just didn't feel worthy of life let me just say that's a bit and if you ever get pushed into a corner where you don't feel like life is worthy that's a death and you speak directly to him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and tell him to get out of the room this girl came and she got delivered but after she got delivered she still had all of these scars on her back at the same meetings a couple of years later she's raising her arms and she always tried to wear long sleeves to hide that those scars this particular night she raised her arms and there was those scars and she just began to worship the Lord in spite of those scars and God came down supernaturally and healed every one of those saying that to say this many of us has been scarred by sin scarred my mistakes and scarred by failures but if you can only understand the blood of Jesus Christ has the power to wipe away our sins don't go back and do them again but that's the power to raise you back up and lift you out of the deep miry clay healed scars the scripture psalms 107 verse 2 i won't be but just a few more minutes the scripture says let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy Psalms 107 and 2 I want you to read it with me let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy shaken thought he had you rather thinner he thought he had you and you mom was a believer and she watched your condition but she had committed you to the Lord [Applause] you will some of God all your time but one day God Richard mercy hallelujah God brings you up mari clay [Applause] Oh hallelujah now I want to ask you this as a redeemed believer this may be the old house but I didn't do it the man that lives here didn't do that the devil points you to all different kind of things brother Joshua he points you to those things brother John let me just preach right here he points you and he condemns you of all those things will array he condemns you right and he points you to those things whenever you get so high point you just so high he punches gets so happy bunch it you tell him there is therefore now no condemnation it's not even held against me [Applause] [Music] [Applause] be strong enough attached I want you to read some scripture with me if you will John first John chapter 4 verse 4 here of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world Philippians chapter 1 in verse 6 workout time sistercrystal being confident of this very thing being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work [Applause] well perform it until the day of Jesus crotch I say a 54 and verse 17 listen this is my favorite part here we go here we go

ain't my words let's not allow those words that's God's words no weapon no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper in July I had three powerful companies tell us they still put us out of business I quoted that scripture over and over and over again they failed because if God is on my side no laugh planet that is formed against me shall prosper I don't care how many Devils say that this church is gonna fail look around the scripture sent all powers in heaven and earth is given to my hand go and I'll go with you whatever you bind on earth I bought in heaven whatever you loose on earth I'll loose in heaven Matthew 16 and 18 19 but and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell the strongest part of Hell shall not prevail against it and I give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth I'm buying in heaven what's your ever thou shalt loose on earth will be loosed in heaven David one time saw the Ark of the Lord coming and he danced for 17 miles and his wife made fun of him dancing and he said if you thought I was filed today wait til tomorrow God cursed her womb that's what God will do to those that make fun of people shouting and dancing and worshiping the Lord [Applause] he'll catch their fertility we have a sister in our family her name is called Mayra and when she came across the Red Sea and when she came across the Red Sea and she looked back and the people that beat on her and the people that mocked her and the people they had put her in slave for all those years they were drawn [Applause] but the lane Lawson said it was 600,000 women 600,000 women you talk about a dust storm that baby was everywhere so is our brother on I need some scripture for it okay Psalms 149 praise ye the Lord and singing to God the Lord a new song praise Him in the sanctuary of his Saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their king let them praise His name and a dance let him sing praises unto him with a temple in a heart for the Lord taketh pleasure in his people [Applause] I love it the Lord takes pleasure with you and he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises be the gods in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron to execute upon them judgement written this honor have all his Saints pray alone you say what brother on I'm not finding anybody would change but your prayers and your actions and your words bond the devil psalms 150 praise you the Lord praise God in His sanctuary praise Him in the firmament of his power praising for his mighty acts praising the court in his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with a saucer in a harp praise him with the timbrel in advance praise him with a stringed instruments and organs praise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbals everything that hath [Applause] let everything
