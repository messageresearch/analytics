[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] sometime ago i was reading
[0:15] in a book of a little boy
[0:19] that was entered a contest
[0:22] and in this contest he was to make
[0:26] himself
[0:26] a famous name any little boy who could
[0:30] keep the password
[0:32] in his mind until he got to a certain
[0:35] place
[0:36] and he would speak this password and the
[0:39] gatekeeper
[0:40] would let him through that was to test
[0:43] the
[0:44] iq of the child and when he
[0:47] got to the place speaking the passwords
[0:51] that was given him
[0:52] the gate would open and he would win
[0:55] a great honor
[0:59] one little boy being very swift-footed
[1:03] and no good and well that he could
[1:05] outrun all the rest of the boys
[1:07] in the contest or he thought he could
[1:12] practiced day after day of running
[1:16] how he pumped up his little lungs
[1:20] got his physical body and trim
[1:23] so that he wouldn't tire as he runs
[1:27] and he practiced how to start with his
[1:30] feet
[1:31] and get a head plunge ahead of the rest
[1:35] of the boys
[1:36] how that he must breathe during the time
[1:38] of his
[1:39] running in order to hold the oxygen that
[1:43] came to his body to keep him
[1:45] pumping on that it wouldn't slow up his
[1:48] heart too much
[1:49] he studied it from every angle that he
[1:52] could
[1:55] and in the morning that the race started
[1:58] there was more than 150 little boys
[2:01] lined up at a certain age
[2:04] this little boy was rather a good size
[2:06] boy for his age
[2:08] and he remembered all of his training
[2:11] and he got ready they got on the line
[2:15] pop their little faces against the
[2:18] string that come along
[2:19] push their little nose up against it it
[2:22] studied all the rules of that
[2:25] making himself ready and then when the
[2:28] gun
[2:29] fired and the lion was broken
[2:33] the little boy jumped forward and this
[2:35] little guy so
[2:36] physically fit until he jumped way ahead
[2:39] of the rest of him
[2:41] and down the track he went with a
[2:43] terrific speed
[2:46] well trained until he could outrun
[2:50] every boy that was in the race
[2:53] and he was there oh quite a long time
[2:57] maybe a minute or more before the best
[3:01] of the other runners
[3:02] ever reached the place
[3:06] but all of his physical training
[3:09] he had forgotten the password
[3:12] he had forgotten the very thing that he
[3:15] was to say to let him in the gate
[3:17] and he paced back and forth and stalled
[3:20] it
[3:21] searched to his mind he had been so
[3:24] interested in the natural natural
[3:27] physical conditions of his body
[3:29] till he had forgotten the main thing
[3:33] on down the line some boys that didn't
[3:35] run so fast
[3:36] remember the password and entered in
[3:40] so is it today we are so
[3:44] interested in building great shrines and
[3:46] churches and buildings and so forth
[3:50] i'm so interested in keeping our
[3:53] churches in good trim with fine
[3:56] buildings and
[3:57] nice plush pews and fine organs

[53:15] we're just having a lot of trouble since
[53:17] we had the kobe
[53:18] with the sugar and my sugar is running
[53:21] between five and six hundred
[53:24] on most days and and so that causes you
[53:28] causes you a lot of issues amen
[53:32] amen hebrews chapter 11
[53:36] and verse 8 by faith abraham and when he
[53:40] was called out into
[53:42] a place which he should
[53:46] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[53:50] and he went out not knowing whether he
[53:52] went
[53:54] by faith he sojourned in a land of
[53:56] promise as in a strange country
[53:59] dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and
[54:01] jacob
[54:02] the heirs with him on the same promise
[54:07] for he looked for a city which have
[54:10] foundations
[54:12] whose builder and maker is god
[54:15] so happens you and i are looking for the
[54:17] same city
[54:20] through faith also sarah herself
[54:23] received strength
[54:25] to conceive seed and was delivered of a
[54:28] child
[54:29] when she was past age because she
[54:32] judged him faithful who had promised
[54:35] therefore sprang there
[54:36] even of one and him as good
[54:40] as dead so many as the stars of the
[54:43] of the sky and a multitude and as a sand
[54:47] which was by the sea
[54:49] sure innumerable these all died in faith
[54:53] not having received the promises
[54:56] but having seen them afar off and were
[54:59] persuaded of them
[55:01] and embraced them and confessed that
[55:03] they were strangers and pilgrims of the
[55:05] earth
[55:06] for they say such things declare
[55:10] plainly that they seek a country
[55:13] and truly if they had been mindful of
[55:16] that country from whence they came
[55:18] they might have had an opportunity to
[55:20] have returned
[55:22] but now they desire a better country
[55:25] that is a heavenly that's my desire
[55:30] wherefore god is not ashamed to be
[55:32] called their god
[55:34] for he hath prepared for them
[55:37] a city you may be seated this morning
[55:51] he is god
[55:55] and if he thought of us before the
[55:57] foundation of the world
[55:59] that was our beginning and then we
[56:02] stepped out of
[56:04] out of eternity into a little space
[56:06] called time
[56:09] some of us will get decades some will be
[56:13] slipped away at birth some will live to
[56:16] be in their 90s
[56:17] maybe even into a hundred but what is
[56:20] that in the space of eternity
[56:23] and then we slip back into eternity
[56:26] again
[56:27] jesus told us that he went to prepare
[56:29] for us a city
[56:31] he went to he went to take care of those
[56:34] things he's the great provider
[56:37] he reminded us that this is not our
[56:42] world
[56:46] sometimes we we get all attached here
[56:48] but this is not our home
[56:51] this is our passing through this is the
[56:55] place
[56:55] and we are regardless of how the end is
[57:01] regardless of how the end is and what
[57:03] the
[57:04] little piece that they put on the paper
[57:06] god knew what hour that we would leave
[57:12] and sometimes he's not real dainty how
[57:15] he takes us home
[57:18] we enjoy the things here in life we
[57:20] enjoy our family
[57:22] we enjoy our homes we enjoy our work
[57:25] we enjoy our accomplishments
[57:28] we enjoy once we we we begin to
[57:32] feel the pull of god now let me just say
[57:35] you didn't seek for god
[57:37] but god came looking for you
[57:40] and many times he found us in trouble
[57:45] running hiding from god and he found us
[57:49] and he knew where we were
[57:50] at and like with adam he came through
[57:53] the garden
[57:54] screaming adam where art thou
[57:58] your garden was a bar room or or
[58:01] some other place it wasn't very
[58:03] reputable
[58:05] but god knew where you're at and he was
[58:07] not ashamed
[58:12] are you with me sometimes we get ashamed
[58:14] of our old book and what it was like and
[58:17] and the acts that we had done and
[58:19] sometimes in our reminiscence we begin
[58:21] to remind
[58:22] ourselves of what we were but it took
[58:24] just
[58:25] as much as the mercies of god and the
[58:27] grace of god for you
[58:29] as it did anybody else but god provided
[58:33] for that
[58:35] and he was not ashamed to come get you
[58:39] but this is not the only place that he's
[58:41] going to fellowship with you
[58:44] he wants to bring you home
[58:52] brother branham says and from that time
[58:54] he says
[58:56] whatever you do whatever you do friends
[59:00] let me just ask you
[59:03] if you believe me to be a servant of god
[59:07] let me tell you something don't you
[59:10] miss that wonderful place
[59:18] i'd like to bring just a couple of
[59:20] thoughts for you just for a moment
[59:22] abraham knew what that place was like
[59:27] because he met the king
[59:33] now he had fellowshipped with him at
[59:35] altars
[59:37] but that king came and stepped through
[59:41] his gate
[59:43] and the atmosphere from those altars and
[59:46] his voice
[59:47] was in that body
[59:51] and it was without question who he was
[59:56] because immediately abraham calls him
[59:58] god lord
[1:00:01] elohim immediately he identifies what
[1:00:05] world he's from
[1:00:08] and he stepped out of that out of that
[1:00:10] heavenly realm
[1:00:11] and picked up the elements of the earth
[1:00:14] and stepped into a body
[1:00:16] and now he's fellowshipping with abraham
[1:00:19] now what did he do for abraham
[1:00:21] it changed his body
[1:00:25] it turned him young again
[1:00:28] and when he talked about that city
[1:00:33] jerusalem not the one on earth
[1:00:38] but when he talked about that city
[1:00:40] jerusalem
[1:00:41] it so anchored something in abraham
[1:00:44] throughout the generations everyone
[1:00:47] would be looking for that same city
[1:00:53] are you with me as a matter of fact
[1:00:56] i'm looking for that city
[1:01:01] i'm looking for that city
[1:01:11] brother branham said that brother
[1:01:14] biscuit said brother branham he said
[1:01:15] they got to a certain place
[1:01:17] on the alaskan highway and he said it
[1:01:20] was a look-off
[1:01:21] said did we pull off the side of the
[1:01:23] interstate
[1:01:24] and he said you could see for 600 miles
[1:01:28] he said just big valley just
[1:01:32] beautiful country and he said brother
[1:01:35] branham just looked at it
[1:01:37] said he just stood there and he just
[1:01:39] looked at it
[1:01:42] he was just mesmerized by it and he said
[1:01:46] this is what it looks like there
[1:01:54] you know sometimes i stand on the edge
[1:01:56] of our pavement
[1:01:59] and i look over across this valley
[1:02:02] and look into these mountains and
[1:02:06] big meadows up there and all of the
[1:02:08] leaves are starting to change
[1:02:10] there's not an artist in the world can
[1:02:12] paint that right
[1:02:17] you've got one of the prettiest front
[1:02:19] yards you'll ever get
[1:02:21] for a church
[1:02:24] but it reminds us of home
[1:02:32] hallelujah
[1:02:41] brother branham said we're in two worlds
[1:02:45] he said he stood in two worlds
[1:02:48] there's something about home
[1:02:52] it's like a magnetizing force
[1:02:56] that is drawing us
[1:03:00] you didn't put that there
[1:03:03] you couldn't put that there but god put
[1:03:07] something on the inside of you
[1:03:10] that maybe your neighbor don't have
[1:03:15] people that you work with don't have
[1:03:20] and you realize that we're
[1:03:23] dwelling in the same space but this is
[1:03:26] not home it's just not home
[1:03:32] we realize that our days days of
[1:03:35] trouble and days of sorrow and you know
[1:03:38] a man is born of woman few days and full
[1:03:40] of trouble
[1:03:43] we're going to have trouble we're going
[1:03:44] to have anxieties we're going to have
[1:03:46] issues of life
[1:03:48] but there's something about us there's a
[1:03:50] drawing power
[1:03:52] that begins to pull on our lives and we
[1:03:55] realize that
[1:03:57] this world wasn't made to stay stay in
[1:03:59] for eternity
[1:04:03] are you with me if it don't if it don't
[1:04:05] take you long just
[1:04:07] just just go through the news
[1:04:10] and the new cycles i i hate this voting
[1:04:14] time
[1:04:16] the high tension and the the the pull
[1:04:18] this way or
[1:04:19] that way and and just the talking of
[1:04:23] of power is going on
[1:04:26] i i i just kind of raggles me sometimes
[1:04:31] this is not my world
[1:04:34] this is not the place that i want to be
[1:04:36] at
[1:04:37] over the last year i i fought with a
[1:04:40] disease that is trying to kill me
[1:04:44] and it tells me that this is not my home
[1:04:48] are you with me there will be a day to
[1:04:50] where cancer
[1:04:52] won't have a grip on me
[1:04:54] [Applause]
[1:04:56] hallelujah
[1:04:57] [Music]
[1:05:05] brother branham said the sun
[1:05:08] can draw a million gallons of water
[1:05:13] with less noise than we can pump a gr
[1:05:16] our glass full of water
[1:05:20] out of a pump the heavens can sprinkle
[1:05:25] glue all over the earth with
[1:05:28] less noise then you can sprinkle
[1:05:31] your front yard
[1:05:37] did you ever hear the planets turn
[1:05:42] only a prophet can say it like this
[1:05:46] great things are quiet things
[1:05:50] watch the holy spirit when it comes in
[1:05:53] tonight
[1:05:54] how quiet it gets everything
[1:05:59] but we're after sensations and runnings
[1:06:02] and
[1:06:02] after little things and we fail to hear
[1:06:06] the voice of god
[1:06:12] he's going to say some pretty astounding
[1:06:14] things right here and i want you to hold
[1:06:16] it
[1:06:17] did you ever hear the day break
[1:06:26] i was sitting in the woods yesterday and
[1:06:28] i had this quote in front of me
[1:06:30] i actually had this in front of me
[1:06:33] sitting on a seat
[1:06:35] and watching the daybreak come up and i
[1:06:38] had this quote in front of me
[1:06:41] and i listened for daybreak i didn't
[1:06:44] hear it
[1:06:47] i didn't hear it i didn't hear it
[1:06:51] but brother ron the quote was there yeah
[1:06:53] but i didn't hear it
[1:06:55] i saw as it come and it begins to
[1:06:58] push back the darkness i didn't hear it
[1:07:04] i didn't hear it in about 20 minutes you
[1:07:07] could begin to see images of trees
[1:07:10] before long it was light
[1:07:14] how many ever turn a flashlight on in
[1:07:16] the middle of the day
[1:07:19] you go i don't see my flashlight it must
[1:07:22] not be working
[1:07:23] there's a greater light
[1:07:27] there's a greater light that dispels the
[1:07:29] darkness
[1:07:31] sometimes your trials are so dark
[1:07:37] your situations are so dark
[1:07:40] you can't help it well i'm just going to
[1:07:44] fix myself
[1:07:46] it's kind of like me going okay
[1:07:49] i'm going to tell cancer to leave today
[1:07:51] and cancer you're going to go out of my
[1:07:53] body
[1:07:54] and and tomorrow i'm going to be well
[1:07:57] well first of all i'm not the healer
[1:08:03] are you with me today i'm going to take
[1:08:06] a rapture i'm tired of this whole world
[1:08:11] forgive me for my foolishness
[1:08:15] but there's a higher force
[1:08:19] there's a higher force that has
[1:08:23] control of our lives of our miracles of
[1:08:28] our
[1:08:28] needs of our body change
[1:08:32] and in that season
[1:08:38] you with me
[1:08:42] brother brown said i don't want to be a
[1:08:43] coward when it comes that time for me to
[1:08:45] go home
[1:08:47] he said i want to look at it and say
[1:08:49] come get me
[1:08:54] hallelujah that's what i really believe
[1:08:57] in the moment in the twinkling
[1:09:00] this body becomes young
[1:09:06] i don't see that brother ron but you
[1:09:09] can't look in that realm
[1:09:11] as i was told just the other day see
[1:09:13] past what you see
[1:09:16] think past what you think
[1:09:21] did you ever hear the day break
[1:09:24] no you've never heard the day break yet
[1:09:27] it scatters all darkness
[1:09:30] if we would only listen to the voice of
[1:09:32] him that speaks behind those things
[1:09:36] we can only hear the voice of him
[1:09:42] that speaks behind these things
[1:09:46] i think sometimes we come to church we
[1:09:49] see a dress
[1:09:50] we see people's shoes some child
[1:09:54] we hear good music song leader sings
[1:09:58] preacher sings don't let it be just
[1:10:00] poetry
[1:10:04] don't let it be just another sermon
[1:10:07] somewhere in there was something for you
[1:10:14] and it was drawing you closer home
[1:10:19] are you with me now brother branham was
[1:10:22] standing in the mirror and he was
[1:10:24] combing his hair
[1:10:25] and he said i haven't lost to one
[1:10:29] and his wife's she's not in the same
[1:10:32] spiritual world that he's in
[1:10:34] and she said oh billy she begins to tell
[1:10:38] him he said i'll tell you
[1:10:40] i haven't lost the one he knows where
[1:10:42] every one of them are at
[1:10:45] one day they'll all be back again
[1:10:50] i'm struggling with the situation
[1:10:52] because of the cancer medicine it's
[1:10:54] causing my hair to
[1:10:56] be frivoly
[1:10:59] i don't know if that's a good word to
[1:11:00] say or frizzy
[1:11:03] and i've got curly hair but now it's
[1:11:06] it's on super max
[1:11:10] and i understand what you sisters are
[1:11:12] doing just to get it to lay in a certain
[1:11:14] way and
[1:11:15] now i'm having to deal with all of that
[1:11:18] and everything's just frizzy
[1:11:21] and i'm seeing hair in my in my on my
[1:11:24] clothes and i'm seeing it
[1:11:26] in the deal and i'm thinking where's my
[1:11:29] hair going
[1:11:32] and i'm thankful for everyone that's
[1:11:33] holding on
[1:11:37] hallelujah but it tells me there's a
[1:11:40] land
[1:11:43] there's something at work in my body
[1:11:46] that tells me that i'm going home
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:52] you remember brother branham talks in
[1:11:56] in brother frazier's favorite sermon
[1:11:58] spiritual amnesia
[1:12:03] and there's a train and
[1:12:06] men are taking boys that have amnesia
[1:12:11] taking them to a place an institution
[1:12:16] it must have been a great time of the
[1:12:18] war because the boys were so affected
[1:12:23] and they didn't know who they were
[1:12:25] didn't know
[1:12:26] where their home was didn't know their
[1:12:30] situations
[1:12:34] you know i think america's there now
[1:12:40] i think our i think the world is there
[1:12:42] now
[1:12:45] and so they come to a water they come to
[1:12:47] a spot to where that they'll rest
[1:12:49] they'll refill the
[1:12:51] mother greg you wouldn't know all about
[1:12:53] that they'd refill the engines
[1:12:56] and the boy stepped off and he got to
[1:12:59] looking
[1:13:02] and he saw a water tower
[1:13:06] and when he saw that water tower
[1:13:09] something came to him
[1:13:12] and he started walking toward it well
[1:13:14] instead of stopping him
[1:13:16] one of the guards followed him
[1:13:19] good wisdom and he followed him and when
[1:13:23] he got to the water tower he found a
[1:13:25] path
[1:13:26] and he started walking that path and he
[1:13:29] followed that path up over a hill and he
[1:13:32] up over another hill and then another
[1:13:35] hill and he comes down into a valley
[1:13:38] and there was a little homestead there
[1:13:40] with smoke coming out of the stack and
[1:13:42] when that boy gets down off of the hill
[1:13:44] he comes to the
[1:13:46] he comes to the fence and there's an old
[1:13:49] father standing there
[1:13:54] and he said i prayed
[1:13:57] i prayed for you every day
[1:14:00] and now you're home
[1:14:05] brother random used that as an analogy
[1:14:07] more than just a story
[1:14:11] about sometimes we're going to wander
[1:14:15] and we're going to lose ourselves but
[1:14:18] god's place something on the inside of
[1:14:21] you
[1:14:23] that'll draw you back to where you came
[1:14:27] from
[1:14:35] i stood in the waters with brother flint
[1:14:38] take and brother
[1:14:40] don babilus in alaska
[1:14:43] they call it salmon run and those salmon
[1:14:47] are trying to go home
[1:14:50] and they and science says there's a
[1:14:52] magnetism
[1:14:53] on the inside of them and
[1:14:57] literally a smell when they get to their
[1:15:00] stream
[1:15:02] their little bitty stream of where they
[1:15:05] were
[1:15:05] bored at and even if they came out of
[1:15:10] a birthing center and to where that they
[1:15:13] were
[1:15:14] they came out of a pipe about that long
[1:15:19] that wide no way could they get back in
[1:15:23] but those salmon will travel for
[1:15:25] thousands of miles
[1:15:28] and they'll come through all kind of
[1:15:30] nettings of fish
[1:15:32] bear eagles even
[1:15:35] sometimes great water falls and they'll
[1:15:39] fight their way
[1:15:41] because something on the inside of them
[1:15:43] has told them to go home
[1:15:45] and lay your eggs it's a safe place
[1:15:48] [Applause]
[1:15:50] fight your way back to home get yourself
[1:15:54] back there
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:15:57] come on church god's taught us by
[1:16:04] nature
[1:16:06] and there's pictures that you can find
[1:16:07] to where those salmon will come to the
[1:16:09] pipe
[1:16:11] and put their nose on the pipe
[1:16:16] to win when they were a little bitty guy
[1:16:19] swam out of
[1:16:27] brother branham says there's a stage
[1:16:29] with an eagle
[1:16:33] so it's called the moping period
[1:16:36] it will also be used a term called
[1:16:38] molten period
[1:16:41] to where their eyes will get filmed over
[1:16:45] and they need to go renew themselves
[1:16:48] where do they do that at home
[1:16:53] they search out that place
[1:16:56] called home and they go back there
[1:17:01] and maybe the other eagles will
[1:17:03] encourage them and strengthen them and
[1:17:05] scream to them
[1:17:07] and there come a stage when that when
[1:17:09] that film is over top of them
[1:17:12] they'll begin to beat their heads until
[1:17:14] they get that
[1:17:16] off of them you know sometimes i think
[1:17:19] we need to do that
[1:17:22] we need to go back to the altar
[1:17:27] and just beat the world off of it
[1:17:30] are you with me just get that you know
[1:17:32] the cares of
[1:17:33] life you know sometimes it becomes so
[1:17:37] complex
[1:17:39] life itself the cares of life
[1:17:42] becomes so complex until if we're not
[1:17:45] careful
[1:17:46] we can sit in pews and backslide
[1:17:49] we come to church and backslide shake
[1:17:52] the same hands and backslide
[1:17:54] and don't realize that god we've allowed
[1:17:56] ourselves to slip away
[1:17:58] from god or if we could go back to that
[1:18:02] rock lay aside the pride to go back to
[1:18:07] that spot
[1:18:08] that is truly home
[1:18:17] i said in the office the other morning
[1:18:21] about two weeks ago three weeks ago
[1:18:25] about four o'clock in the morning with a
[1:18:28] presence
[1:18:30] that is way beyond this world
[1:18:35] like i never felt sitting right there in
[1:18:39] my office
[1:18:43] you know in that presence there was no
[1:18:47] care
[1:18:48] about my job
[1:18:52] it wasn't a thought about money
[1:18:55] or a home
[1:18:59] it wouldn't have thought about politics
[1:19:03] for about 20 minutes i said in a
[1:19:06] presence
[1:19:09] maybe like abraham said in
[1:19:16] the clock on the wall meant nothing
[1:19:22] i don't know about you but i really love

[1:27:03] now
[1:27:11] jesus said i tell you a truth
[1:27:15] there be some standing here which shall
[1:27:18] not
[1:27:19] taste of death
[1:27:24] i believe that as
[1:27:27] jesus was going to ascend and they were
[1:27:30] going to personally
[1:27:32] watch him leave
[1:27:36] and the worlds were going to blend
[1:27:42] that they realized when jesus said i'll
[1:27:45] tell you the truth there'll be some
[1:27:46] standing here
[1:27:47] which shall not take death
[1:27:52] in a few days they were going to watch
[1:27:54] jesus
[1:27:55] turn younger and then gravitation was
[1:27:59] going to lose its pull
[1:28:04] and then they knew that they had met the
[1:28:06] same one
[1:28:08] that abraham
[1:28:15] you know brother shannon i've watched
[1:28:18] your life
[1:28:19] it's it's an amazing it's an amazing
[1:28:22] journey to me
[1:28:23] i knew you as a boy i knew you as you
[1:28:26] were
[1:28:27] a young man i knew you as a
[1:28:30] young married couple with habits in your
[1:28:34] life
[1:28:36] i've never counseled you in the office
[1:28:41] i've never sat down with you
[1:28:44] but i've watched habits just leave
[1:28:50] well i've got to really work on this no
[1:28:52] no no you just fall in love with god
[1:28:56] and the attributes of home begin to live
[1:28:58] in here so much
[1:29:00] because you've met the king of the city
[1:29:03] and before long you can just see it on
[1:29:06] them
[1:29:09] you can literally just see it on them
[1:29:12] and they're just so different
[1:29:17] you knew them in another world
[1:29:22] i personally love to hear the story of
[1:29:24] brother biskell talking about
[1:29:27] when they were
[1:29:30] wrestling that horse because they had to
[1:29:32] take it
[1:29:35] and they were putting it they were
[1:29:36] locking it down to a tree to try to
[1:29:38] break it
[1:29:39] and that horse was going to kill itself
[1:29:43] and it's just breathing and lathering up
[1:29:46] and they're
[1:29:46] beating that animal and shaking that
[1:29:49] animal
[1:29:50] because they need it as a pack horse
[1:29:53] and brother biscuit is he's from that
[1:29:56] country
[1:29:56] he knows what it's going to take we
[1:29:58] shouldn't be even taking an animal
[1:30:02] and he said i thought to myself you know
[1:30:05] they knew where we were
[1:30:06] coming why didn't bud have the horses
[1:30:08] ready
[1:30:10] we're chasing horses all over the place
[1:30:12] and
[1:30:13] you've heard this story a thousand times
[1:30:15] and and he said we're standing there and
[1:30:17] i'm thinking we've got to be on the
[1:30:19] on our journey and he said i'm thinking
[1:30:22] about
[1:30:22] but getting this horse in line and this
[1:30:25] horse is just a ruckus
[1:30:27] and he's going to kill somebody
[1:30:31] and he said all of a sudden that horse
[1:30:32] just quieted down
[1:30:35] he said he literally he said i've never
[1:30:37] seen anything like it
[1:30:38] he said he just quieted down
[1:30:42] and he said you just quit blowing and
[1:30:44] said he just became as
[1:30:46] calm as he could be and he said i was
[1:30:49] witnessing this miracle
[1:30:51] right in front of me and he said i
[1:30:54] turned and
[1:30:55] brother branham was putting his hat back
[1:30:57] on
[1:31:01] and he said i realized that the god of
[1:31:05] humanity
[1:31:06] was also the god of nature
[1:31:14] now for the critic let's let me just
[1:31:18] answer you here
[1:31:24] i lived in pilot and we had a farm
[1:31:29] your mom and dad's house is there and
[1:31:31] right up on the hill
[1:31:34] is a is a farm as well and there's a man
[1:31:38] named george
[1:31:38] lived up there and george raised horses
[1:31:42] never broke them but he raised horses
[1:31:45] there
[1:31:47] and those horses were wild horses
[1:31:50] and there was a man named robert sheffy
[1:31:53] that came through he had just gave his
[1:31:55] horse away
[1:31:58] because somebody had need of a horse and
[1:32:00] so he goes to george's place
[1:32:03] and and he tells george i need a horse
[1:32:08] i've just gave mine away for the cause
[1:32:10] of jesus christ
[1:32:11] and george says help yourself he said
[1:32:14] they're wild
[1:32:16] if you contain them i'll give it to you
[1:32:21] and he picked up he picked up an apple
[1:32:23] and he walked out into the middle of the
[1:32:25] field
[1:32:26] he had prayer he walked up to a horse
[1:32:30] and gave it an apple laid his hand on it
[1:32:33] and prayed for it
[1:32:35] and he called for his saddle he put his
[1:32:37] saddle on it
[1:32:38] and his reigns on it anybody that knows
[1:32:40] anything about horses knows this is
[1:32:42] impossible
[1:32:46] and he got on the horse he blessed
[1:32:49] george
[1:32:50] george lived to over a hundred years old
[1:32:54] i'd say it's quite a blessing
[1:32:58] i worked for george and he gave us a
[1:33:01] dime for a day
[1:33:05] bless his heart
[1:33:13] god pays all of his debts
[1:33:17] you say well brother ron what does that
[1:33:18] have to do with anything
[1:33:20] i'm coming to an end jesus said go get
[1:33:24] me a cult the fall of an ass
[1:33:28] whether you realize it or not that cult
[1:33:30] has never had a rider
[1:33:34] it's humanly impossible brother john
[1:33:38] i'd say you look you you look like a man
[1:33:40] that knows something about horses
[1:33:43] let me say this to you a man on his
[1:33:46] horse a woman and his horse there's
[1:33:49] just something there girls in their
[1:33:52] horse
[1:33:55] i better quit preaching that way or i'll
[1:33:56] go buy a horse again
[1:34:01] but they brought this fall of an ass
[1:34:05] and they brought it to jesus and that
[1:34:08] which was humanly impossible
[1:34:16] jesus got on it
[1:34:21] and he rode it into the city
[1:34:24] which should have been his home
[1:34:28] and they should have recognized he's the
[1:34:31] god over nature
[1:34:35] he's not just god of miracles but he's
[1:34:37] god over nature
[1:34:40] we play you uh we play you a video many
[1:34:43] times before
[1:34:44] service i will take you back home
[1:34:47] i will take you back home my children
[1:34:51] god has gathered them after 2 000 years
[1:34:55] of
[1:34:55] exile in many nations and they come
[1:34:58] home with just the clothes on their back
[1:35:03] and if you know anything about of israel
[1:35:05] today she's number one in military
[1:35:09] she's number one in produce she's number
[1:35:12] one
[1:35:13] in science she's number one in
[1:35:17] almost every major category
[1:35:20] in the world
[1:35:23] yet the world wants to extinguish her
[1:35:28] but there's a king coming
[1:35:32] the king that to you thousand years ago
[1:35:35] rode into that home place
[1:35:42] but not just that king is coming
[1:35:46] i'm coming with him
[1:35:56] i'm coming home
[1:36:03] you may not recognize me
[1:36:08] but when you hear my voice you'll know
[1:36:09] that's brother ron
[1:36:12] that's brother ron he's about
[1:36:15] 60 pounds lighter
[1:36:19] flowing red hair and got the energy
[1:36:24] of ally
[1:36:35] you know i watch her play in my front
[1:36:37] yard
[1:36:40] she doesn't sit down and go i'm tired
[1:36:44] and i watch her she makes me tired
[1:36:47] watching
[1:36:50] my eyes almost get disarrayed
[1:36:54] her movements but i think about her
[1:36:57] movements
[1:36:58] it's an energy
[1:37:01] it's an energy to go to one place to
[1:37:03] another without any
[1:37:05] without any human seem like human
[1:37:09] effort
[1:37:12] and god's gonna restore that back to me
[1:37:25] can i give you one more scripture
[1:37:32] maybe maybe i'd like to just share this
[1:37:34] with you it meant something to me this
[1:37:35] week when i read
[1:37:36] it
[1:37:39] aliens from other countries
[1:37:42] are rarely shown the welcome map
[1:37:48] they're often accepted reluctantly
[1:37:53] or with tongue-in-cheek they may even
[1:37:56] find themselves
[1:37:57] victims of discriminations rejection
[1:38:01] intolerances
[1:38:04] the bible says that we are aliens
[1:38:08] and strangers in this world
[1:38:12] our citizenship is in heaven
[1:38:17] and that is where our real home is
[1:38:21] and as long as we live in this earth
[1:38:25] we don't fit in
[1:38:28] our customs are different our goals are
[1:38:31] different our ways our living is
[1:38:33] different
[1:38:34] and our concerns are different
[1:38:37] and as christ followers instead of being
[1:38:40] the followers of the world we may find
[1:38:42] ourselves
[1:38:43] rejected persecuted
[1:38:47] we shouldn't be surprised
[1:38:51] jesus christ warned us if they
[1:38:54] persecuted me
[1:38:56] they will also persecute you
[1:39:01] never forget you're a citizen
[1:39:06] of the kingdom of god
[1:39:10] and someday you will be
[1:39:13] home
[1:39:20] brother branham taught us told us a
[1:39:21] story about a man
[1:39:23] that was a missionary and then there was
[1:39:26] a great group of
[1:39:27] like a musical group
[1:39:31] and he said when they got off of the
[1:39:32] train
[1:39:35] there was a huge group that was
[1:39:39] that was there to welcome them home
[1:39:44] massive group and not one person
[1:39:49] was there to welcome him home
[1:39:52] and he walked down he walked down the
[1:39:58] ramps and he kind of feeling sorry for
[1:40:01] himself
[1:40:03] i understand some of that i've made some
[1:40:05] of those walks
[1:40:07] kind of feeling sorry for themselves
[1:40:12] and as they walked down walked down and
[1:40:16] it was kind of just feeling nobody here
[1:40:18] to meet me nobody
[1:40:20] nobody no bands playing no no welcome
[1:40:24] and a voice spoke to him and said you're
[1:40:26] not home yet
[1:40:36] i don't know and i don't even adventure
[1:40:38] but let me just
[1:40:39] let me just have a folly here for a
[1:40:41] moment
[1:40:43] the other day when brother john's time
[1:40:45] was to go
[1:40:50] on this realm there wasn't hardly
[1:40:51] anybody could be with him to say
[1:40:53] goodbye and we kind of sometimes look at
[1:40:57] that as very
[1:40:58] difficult because covet has caused us to
[1:41:02] not to be able to be there with them
[1:41:04] when they go by but it's not so
[1:41:08] when they're in another realm
[1:41:12] you know once they arrive there's
[1:41:15] things that are called and
[1:41:19] and the name is called and there's a
[1:41:23] group that sent
[1:41:24] down to the river to meet them
[1:41:29] and we've got quite a delegation that'll
[1:41:31] be standing on the other side
[1:41:35] everybody's young and everybody knows
[1:41:37] every they know everything
[1:41:40] and there's no clock
[1:41:45] that's like i dreamed here here not long
[1:41:47] ago
[1:41:48] that i was slipping across and as i was
[1:41:50] slipping across
[1:41:52] and i was standing there and
[1:41:55] and brother brother frazier's father
[1:41:59] was standing there and he said i wanted
[1:42:01] to meet you he said i just kind of
[1:42:03] wanted to be the one to meet you
[1:42:05] and homer's pushing him back and he said
[1:42:07] i got some things to tell him
[1:42:08] and he said give me a chance homer i
[1:42:10] want to talk to him too
[1:42:15] hallelujah what a land
[1:42:20] what a land beyond the river
[1:42:24] a place called home for you and i no
[1:42:27] more sugar to beat us
[1:42:36] i'm running into spots now that i forget
[1:42:38] things
[1:42:40] and i've got a wonderful team around me
[1:42:41] that they almost read my mind and
[1:42:44] they'll tell me a name or
[1:42:45] tell me a place they don't judge me
[1:42:49] because i'm forgetting things
[1:42:51] they don't do that they don't go daddy
[1:42:53] you're getting older
[1:42:55] you know they just know that there's
[1:42:56] things at work in my brain that
[1:42:58] not supposed to be there and they don't
[1:43:01] go
[1:43:02] now now dad dad you need to get a hold
[1:43:04] of yourself
[1:43:05] these boys are just awesome they'll just
[1:43:08] fill in the blank we'll go on with this
[1:43:10] story
[1:43:12] and i watch them i've told the story two
[1:43:14] or three times in a row
[1:43:15] they're just real kind with me they just
[1:43:18] listen to it and
[1:43:19] laugh with me all at the same time
[1:43:24] you know when god sees us in this realm
[1:43:37] and the gray hairs have come from
[1:43:39] nathanael
[1:43:44] and the stupid shoulders come
[1:43:49] and you're having such a hard day how
[1:43:52] many of you ever have a hard day
[1:43:56] just a real hard day
[1:44:01] you know it's kind of a day it's almost
[1:44:04] overwhelming
[1:44:06] you have difficult day you have a hard
[1:44:09] day
[1:44:12] brother meadows is having some hard days
[1:44:16] going through things he shouldn't have
[1:44:18] to go through
[1:44:23] but the king from the other side of the
[1:44:25] river
[1:44:27] has got it all taken care
[1:44:33] he's of it all taken care of
[1:44:42] i got this in my notes so
[1:44:46] maybe we'll be there and there's people
[1:44:49] we thought
[1:44:51] wouldn't be there
[1:44:54] but god by his grace provides
[1:44:59] and all of a sudden you turn and there
[1:45:02] he stands
[1:45:08] oh what a land beyond the river
[1:45:13] oh what a place
[1:45:17] could we sing that song what a day that
[1:45:20] will be
[1:45:23] i don't know about you but i've
[1:45:24] certainly enjoyed this time
[1:45:30] i certainly enjoyed it i hope those on
[1:45:34] the internet enjoyed it so
[1:45:39] when i start talking about home
[1:45:42] you know there's something about going
[1:45:43] home people will drive thousands of
[1:45:45] miles to go home
[1:45:48] may live in a much better house have a
[1:45:51] much better job

[1:46:13] child
[1:46:14] but there's no place like home
[1:46:17] and it you just want to go it only
[1:46:21] reminds you that there is a place in
[1:46:23] god's mind
