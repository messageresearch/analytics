old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us and we will not hide them from our children showing to the generation and to come the Praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he had done for he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they make them known to their children that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them in their to their children that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his Commandments today we recognize this is a gift of God and we never take it for granted for life from God is a great gift we recognize as we dedicate this baby we not only dedicate the baby but we dedicate our lives and recognize that this is an opportunity to to recommit because now we have a responsibility yeah they'll watch our lives amen and they'll watch the good times and they'll watch the bad times and and life is life but they will know the presence of God when he comes into your home that warm presence I remember as a little child feeling that warm presence and here in the prophet of God's voice one night I just wept out before the Lord I was just a little fell maybe about seven years old and God begin to deal with my life God gives you the responsibility to watch over him to protect him to guide him to be his be his guide in life to be a real strong voice in his life may it not not be the voices of out there in the world but may his strongest voice be you and now

amen so important part of our our time and so we're just so thankful for that did you notice the doors Amen Brother Ray thank you thank you so much thank you so much everybody that worked on the doors from from the very beginning would you stand just now and amen amen sister Sue sister Sue I've got pictures of you working so amen God bless you give them all a great big hand and you're walking through a vision you're walking through a vision and I'm just so thrilled and and uh you know as we get Fuller you're going to have to probably set it out there a little bit and so amen and so we're just so thankful so absolutely thankful for that last night brother Isaiah came and gave his testimony and uh I know he was so nervous sister Julie said he rolled in bed all night the night before and she said what's the matter with you and he well you did well brother Isaiah and so God bless you Hallelujah brother Isaiah gave his testimony and brother Isaiah came to the Lord last night Hallelujah how fitting you you can't make this stuff up now we had such a phenomenal service that brother Andrew said sister Katie was still drunk at 1:30 last night and so I personally believe she's a habitual offender I I really do she gets into it wherever she's she sees you getting it she's going to come and you know it won't rub off but she's going to come and get in the atmosphere Fe there it is and so I got a feeling she wasn't alone but isn't God so good isn't he so good and so what an atmosphere last night just so I so enjoyed it amen I as I think about I I wanted to share something before I went to the word as I think about these children and and dedicating this baby and and thinking about it I I want you to begin to like never before Point your thoughts toward home thank God for profit thank God for a prophet that indicted this generation to let us know that God sent us a voice in this day and there's so many things that are shifting and shaking and now those are just signs signs and you know it's kind of like 20 miles from Harrisonburg or 10 miles from Pilot or or ronoke or it's signs to tell us how close we are to home Israel is fighting for its own life and and don't never take that for granted we're the spiritual Israel and they're the natural Israel they are literally fighting for for their own life not just on one front but many fronts I thought the other day when Netanyahu came and gave probably the greatest speech that's been given in the halls of our Congress and if you heard that it was phenomenal and and he gave the speech and went back to Abraham and laid claim to the land we need to lay claims to this right here like never before I I think it's significant because God sent this nation a prophet and this nation turned it down turned the message down and so and so he stood there and reminded America that that not only is the enemy in their camp but it's also here let me just remind you let me just remind you in politics they've made a shift they've made a shift and I was telling the boys this week I said listen no man is in control of what's Happening Now what they're doing behind doors is God is causing he's literally causing things to happen he's causing things to happen what what about the woman in the purple dress that's already fulfilled that's already fulfilled what about Rome that's already fulfilled our Supreme Court our media is full of cathol Catholicism amen right our the Pope that they have is is the very head of the climate think about that he's head of some of the the leading Nations the leader and I know you've heard by now the Olympics that just took place come on the Olympics that just happened and in the opening ceremonies they have drag queens Mock and they set it up to where that it would be like the last supper and mock Jesus Christ and the disciples it makes me mad enough and I thought about this morning and Jill Biden applauded Joe Biden applauded and said they didn't go far enough that's in your Fox news this morning that's happening because of the cup of iniquity is full the Sodom conditions is running over the scriptures calls for Lawless societies forgive me just give me a couple minutes before I go to the word they're calling like never before for no police now would you to think about where that takes us come on Amen no border agents no ice now I'm not being political but I want you to think about a tribulation period of what that's going to be like can you imagine the cartel operating in America like they do in Mexico come on I I spent about 30 minutes with Gabe on this thoughts this morning and he said they're not waiting to come they're already here that's right but get let them just be turned loose how many of you own businesses own businesses can you imagine paying them every month just to operate paying them every month that's that's what they're calling for now there's nothing we can do about that but there is something we can do about this and I want to speak to you as your pastor Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get Ready Get ready if you're backsliding in your condition in your home and your prayer life has slipped away and the voice of the Prophet is now no more listen change today change today today is the day to change your life [Applause] and now how many of you have one of these how many of you have one of these I know it's handy so I want you to raise it up yeah now can you imagine when brother brand and and the scriptures are are written written how many of you passed electric car we almost pass electric cars every day maybe even some of you own them the vision that brother brandham had in in the early 30s listen can you remember what the cars were like then and then he said they'll drive the drive you down the road that's fulfilled that's fulfilled but the the scripture says that two prophets will be at be in Israel two prophets Moses and Elijah and they'll be slain in in the streets because they don't want to hear the message are you with me can you imagine brother Brandon being here now oh yeah listen he wouldn't last a week he wouldn't last a week cuz the spirit of Elijah would call it out he would call Sodom out in very difficult ways he would set seats on fire but the message has been [Applause] delivered it's been delivered and we say I believe it with all my heart Oh Glory to God I believe it with all my heart we're near home we're near home we're near home Hallelujah while you're standing let's just but when I raise you had you to raise your phone and the early the scriptures at that point when it's written there's no instrument made like this but now the world will see two prophets within seconds dead in the streets Hallelujah well I feel like shouting if I'm not careful I'm to do what you did last night amen Andrew that was probably the best you've ever done in your life and so amen I get to hear him four times this week and the old guy gets to preach twice amen amen God bless you God bless you well that was just the beginning and Amen brother Roger good to see you I I picked you up when I spinning there so God bless you and sister an we love you with all of our hearts amen if you'll turn with me to Hebrews chap 11 verse 1 amen Hebrews 11 verse1 now brother Andrew finished last night and we don't we don't talk about what we're going to preach but he finished last night on the water that's spinning around the earth amen and on the earth there's nothing holding it but the word of God and so this has been in my notes for quite a while Hebrews chap 11 and verse one amen now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do not appear I'd like for you to turn to Genesis chapter 1 just for a few scriptures here as we go forth in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and God said let there be a firmate in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the earth from the from the waters and God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firment from the waters which were above the firment and it was so and God called the firment heaven and he called the evening and the morning were the second day you may be seated this this morning God bless you God bless you a couple of just quotations for you from the scriptures verily I say unto you that just generation shall not pass till all things will be fulfilled what an incredible scripture Heaven and Earth shall not shall pass away but my words shall not pass away now I want you to remember and I'm just I've got several quotes here so I don't want to bore you with it but I want you to remember God spoke and he believed his own word can you just follow me with that now I want you to remember the original seed that God speaks it has life in it the scripture also said that let every seed bring forth of its kind some of your Farmers some of your gardeners when you plant corn you expect to get corn amen when you have a cows and I was raised on a farm when you have cows you know I've been there with them and help the cows birth the little babies in into the world and you know that's a mess if you've ever been a part of that but your helping that that that calf to be born and sometimes their legs are crossed up and you just begin to work and you get their legs and but I never pulled a horse out come on it was always cows it was always calves amen we're 6,000 years later and it's never changed every seed brings forth after itself even in the animal kingdom they bring forth to itself some of you've had small children when they're born and some of you have big children and some of you have 10 PB 11 PB 12b children and you're thanking God if you have a six-pound child but I want you to know it have been an incredible shock if a pony would have been born amen or a labad dole would have been born but there was never in my mind that one of those creatures would come because the word says I'm trying to Capt you with you the word said that every seed will produce of its own kind now let's just go forward a little bit every church will produce whether it's Methodist it will produce produce Methodist whether it's Baptist it'll produce Baptist whether it's Pentecost of the world it'll produce Pentecost to the world the message will produce the message results evening light message will produce evening light results this message will produce abroad Hallelujah the seed will produce what went into the Earth and it will bring it out I'm going try not to get excited Andrew so here we are brother bam says people don't want to believe in faith well how did God make the Earth he spoke it you see you see it he spoke and the world came into existence and this world this morning is the spoken word of God he believed his own word and here it is watch it and if God and you're The Offspring of him and if you're The Offspring of him why don't you say it I'm The Offspring of God and God is in you and say it there and God is in me he will believe his own word though it can't be seen felt tasted or anything you'll believe it you see what I mean for God in you will believe his own word amen that's powerful now the first time that the sun rose in Genesis it was BR bringing a message that there will be life upon the Earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a dual sunrising another sunrising it was not only the Su in Rising Resurrection morning but the S so n was Rising he says he said to bring eternal life to All God's promis that by the for knowledge that he had seen laying upon the earth now no more could the botney life lived there at the beginning without the Su in to bring it to life no more than today when the S so n of God is upon the Earth it takes the S so n light to bring them eternal life his chosen one that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world are you with me I want you to think sometimes we think of oursel as a temporary being here for 60 90 110 years that's just the temporary life but this isn't the real you amen that's right did you catch that I went by it real quick but this is the real you Jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth his word is superior over all man's words over all every anything his word is light and we know that at the beginning it most it must have been a foggy dismal and dark as the world was turning and when God know that he that the need of light his seed was already in the Earth because he had planted it there now he needed light to bring forth that seed to make that seed live because the seed was already here brother brand makes a statement he said he placed your body here the elements of your body in the earth as he was forming it like a contractor would lay out Tu fours and two sixes and plywood and roofing materials getting ready God the great contractor knew what he would need and he saw you bringing you into existence even before Adam would be here now if you just grab those thoughts just for a moment God thought of you way before Even Adam then how can God lose us no matter what the devil puts against you no matter what the pressure is and no matter what he says to you if God thought of me when he was making the earth when he was building the Grand Canyon and all the deserts and all of our mountains and and he was building all of it let me just say if he thought of me while he was making and all of that there's no way that I can lose now just like it is in every age God has foretold us what would take place in each age the only thing he needs is the manifestation of the light of God upon that scripture to make it to live in that age and it will do it as long as the light can get the word if the word is gerti it'll make it live if it's promised for that age this message has went around the globe brother Tim was wrote me this morning and they have translated and proof R and it's now it's now on the Hub I believe for the Japanese people only a few years ago had not one book not one but in the last few years just short years there's churches in Japan and now 7even over 700 books are now into their hands listen no wonder Satan hates this message but once this message gets in your hands brother Ben just think about that listen as long as you were following another light and just doing the order there was no fight with you guys but once the message gets in your hands and it tells you who you are and what you can do that you can shake the key kingdoms of hell that seed The Sun Shines on that seed and it comes to life let me say there's not enough tradition to keep it down there's not enough Church order to keep it down but that seed comes to life and press it its way [Applause] Gabe disappeared we sat this morning on our back back patio we'll call it the back patio and he was talking he was talking about China and he said We As Americans we're just we are Christians but we he said we just take it for granted amen get in our car we come to church there's no real pressure what is American's pressure brother brandham told us what our pressure is entertainment easy life it's going to change it's going to change very shortly easy life people can come to a spot to where I'll go to church if I you want to they don't just do that here I you know I don't have to pray I I don't have to get serious with God I'll tell you where you'll find yourself outside the ark brother brandham said they gathered outside of the Ark just in case it was true can you imagine the people that have been Affiliated and associated with the message and something inside of their hearts know that this is the truth but they can't Bridle themselves to surrender to the word and they wear their pants and they I'm talking about women and they wear their pants and they cut their hair and they put all kind of jewelry on they paint their faces and they do all kind of things because the king of their heart will let them do anything that they want to do men will become sissified men no rulers of the home bringing that home to an order because it's it's a it's not accepted in society W accept the responsibility let me just say outside of the Ark watching those people when bombs are dropping oh and Los Angeles has fell off of the Earth are you with me now and Russia is attacking are you with me then they'll want to get right with God but we won't be here I want you to think about the ark was not there anymore it was not set in on dry ground now it's floating no way to get in well you saying that for get in while the time is here get in while our doors are open get sincere get dedicated don't tell me about your problems don't tell me about your nonsense don't tell me about your stuff listen get your eyes on God like never [Applause] before brother Ron but you guys have been saying that for years but the conditions are meeting the challenge of the hour the conditions in the world are meeting the word but we also are meeting the [Applause] word we were speaking of China and brother bisco was arrested in China for getting the message there others have went to get the message there I went to get the message M there none of us came to church this morning thinking we might get arrested none of us came to church with the fear that if we get arrested we're going to be in a prison for two years to 10 years to the rest of our life none of us come with that pressure those people go to church willing willing to pay the price they believe the same message we believe they have the same holy ghost that we have they believe the same God that we do I preach for two to 300 people and I'll never forget I watch sisters crawl from where you're at back there after the preaching was over crawled on concrete floors to be prayed for feeling so humble Cen and we watch Miracle after miracle after Miracle after Miracle take place I wore a tie one night because we were forbidden to wear ties to look like any preacher God spoke to me to put on a tie and so happened one of the brothers brother Glenn that's going to pick us up in a few days he had brought a tie and had it in his suitcase and he said here brother Ron I said I need a tie God spoke to me to have one brother Tom walked out and he said we're not supposed to wear ties I said God told me to he said well wear it and so many people surrounded me listen one sister was crawling over the others and my tie is hanging down and she grabbed a hold of that tie just hanging on to it and received a phenomenal Miracle thank you Lord a phenomenal Miracle they don't have churches now they literally gather from one place to another and by code they tell where we're going to have service I thank God for this building I thank God for this building whether it's hot or whether it's cold or whether it's lit or whether it's [Applause] plush today I'm not worried with this I thank God for this building I thank God that we've got the opportunity to come and worship him one more time I thank God for the desire in my heart he planted it there he planted it there and because the son has risen a man that's here that turn the light in the midst of the darkness he turned it on and sister Julie there was nothing that could stop that seed from coming forth oh give the Lord a good [Applause] hand sister Julie's been praying for her mother and her mother's been coming just a little bit ago believe she's a Catholic girl is that right you too was a Catholic girl somewhat and you've been praying for your mother what two Wednesday nights ago last Sunday her mother walked out of the Pew and W walked to the Altar and give her heart to the Lord and said I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the other day she she said something to me and her passion and the way she said it she said and I've been praying for her and she's in and I've Got Friends and I've been praying for them and I'm praying they come in and I'm praying for this one and I believe they'll come and she just throwed her arms kind of like that right there I believe we all how to have that passion and when that last one comes in when that last one comes in we'll go home maybe you're watching by the way of the internet if you're not there where you need to be come [Applause] home and then was Jesus was led up in the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days in 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him and he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread and he answered and he said it is written notice how he responds it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and the devil taking him up into the holy city and sit him upon the Pinnacle in the of the temple and he saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus saith unto him it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and again the devil taking him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world brother brandham said he even showed him the United States and the glory of them and saith unto them all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me so God Jesus owns it all why should he I want to say this to you and why should you and I want to land this right here young people the devil offers you a lot of things you want it all you're you're a participant in the law the seed of God is inside of you that seed will bring forth life and it'll bring forth eternal life why should you try to take an etern a temporary reward when you own it all did you get it some of you didn't get it Jesus was offered the kingdoms of the world and brother random said that he was tempted to take it that's how much that the devil can paint a picture for you but he already owned it all he was trying to get him to take it without a Calvary that's why he tries to offer you churchianity without a new birth if he gives you the if you get the new birth this world won't mean nothing can I say it this world won't mean nothing if you get eternal life living on the inside of [Applause] you can I just drop an example right here for those that are here let me just say this to you I fight stage four cancer take chemo every day I asked the doctor what if I quit the chemo she said two week weeks two weeks sister Connie's there two weeks let me say 14 days is not very long well brother Ron how do you make it there's something on the inside of me that's [Music] [Applause] Eternal I'm not watching the temporary part if I die don't you ser for me I'll be more alive there than what I've ever been [Applause] here some people when they get sick it just flies apart their world just flies apart it's just a part of of living the Fallen life you didn't sin you didn't know anything your body your DNA come from this Earth and Adam's sin fell to this Earth let me just say this you but this Fallen Earth does not have dominion oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah this Fallen cancer does not have Dem minion over the Eternal Jing seed of God the light has shown the light has shown [Applause] Jesus did not defeat the devil on his power on his or his personality or upon his Spirit he defeated him on the word of God that's right so when Satan's beating you you go to the word of God and you find the the word for your situation you find the word for your situation listen You'll wire out with your energy but you find the word for your situation and you start quoting the word are you ready well that was my opening amen the spoken word is what God departed he deposited on the inside of you and that spoken word is the intelligence of God the seed that's inside of you responds to the word it responds to the message you want to know how that you're a Believer and you know that you're a Believer when your flesh starts wanting to walk away the seed of God inside of you holds a Hal of you and it'll cause a Revival on the inside of you when others walk away it holds you it's your life it's the pulation it's the [Applause] passion Hallelujah when others unbelief sin produces unbelief sin produces destruction but the author of my book has produced eternal life and I believe that it is the spoken word of God now in this day people want to speak against this and they want to speak against brother brandham but it isn't long till they're speaking against this and the moment you deny this word it tells you what seed is in you now the reason I'm going there now I want you to understand that now lets you know when you hear antiw word amen you know that don't come from your dimension it comes from that Dimension when it starts arguing with the word when it starts argue with the word you say well brother Ron somebody came to me why would you listen to a backsliding Antichrist make believer over top of a Vindicated prophet of the Hour come on you don't like this you're not going to like the rest right people get so worked up on all these politicians and all their nonsense that they're doing they get so tore up and they watch hours and hours of that stuff why don't you just spend at least an hour a day listen to a Vindicated Prophet that was speaking from Heaven that was anointed by an Angel of the Lord don't tell me about your politics don't tell me about your nonsense if you're not listening to this I'll tell you what it'll do will produce a negative attitude it'll produce a critical attitude and before long nothing's right especially including you just all of you say Amen right there if you will now we believe what Eve turned down that's right yes sir now I don't you want you to think about that Eve and a Garden of Eden with everything in Perfection beli The Serpent and one word one word amen one word caused every dead baby amen caused the cancer that I'm fighting one word how important is this word think about that how important is this word I'll never forget brother Murphy Wong the first service he brought his wife to church brother bisc preaching she don't know anything about this message they're just now coming in it's phenomenal she she's sitting in the church and the spirit of God begins to deal with her and all of a sudden she's gone brother Shannon the spirit of God that came on you last night I know your situation I know I'm not going to share it with the people people I know your situation you call me and I know your situation you don't know that you're going to have to sink but I'm watching you I'm sitting in that I was purposely sitting in those chairs facing you because I thought the spirit of God's falling and it's going to fall on him and you was watching but God was healing his heart and he was telling him I'm on your side and she's sitting there and she's a modern-day girl modern day fixed up and she leaves they think well she's gone she got mad at something she got mad at something Murphy's told me this several times so I think I can tell it and he said all of a sudden she come back in and her earrings are gone amen she said I can't sit in this kind of presence with these earrings on I can't set listen the presence of God will change you it'll change you thank you brother Andrew she did not understand a word of English come on we got a little boy here that can't understand a word of English but he's enjoyed being with Meen Hallelujah his name is Charlie amen he knows his name what are you saying brother Ron I don't live in these conditions but if I had cockroaches in my home I'd P first of all go into s cloth and Ashes but if I had cockroaches in my home and I turned the light on the Cockroaches will run that's the reason as a sinner or a or a backsliding person when the light comes on at church you'll begin to feel this heat in your body and you'll be to feel mad or upset it's because the light come on it's your opportunity it's grace to you one word jewelry one word hair amen hair I never get upset when it's talking about hair for my for a man I never get upset I don't have a problem are you with me but your sister struggle with the trimming and the cutting and you had to make a conscious decision and some of you had to struggle with that but listen once that seed is ignited in your life a million dollar can I hear some amens one word name of the Lord Jesus Christ for baptism once the light comes on just an angel is standing with Mary and he's giv her commission she didn't say well I I need to go talk to the priest about it or I need to go home and figure it all out she said be it unto me be it unto me according to Thy word god whatever you got planned for me be it unto [Applause] me oh Hallelujah I want you just imagine in heaven there's no more corruption no more corruption corruption couldn't couldn't get a hold to the body of the Lord because the scripture said he will see no corruption I want you to think about that critics I want you to think about that Jesus arose before corruption could set into his body I want to say this and I've said it before if you were in him then if you was in him then corruption couldn't said into you 2,000 years ago well I got news for the devil right now if corruption couldn't touch me 2,000 years ago it can't touch me now oh Glory if it didn't get hold to me 2,000 years it can't touch me now Jesus is there brother Josh this is so powerful I feel like I'm as tall as you the first Adam caused all of death the first Adam caused all of death and Adam lived long enough way over 900 years to see the fall of a man and see the generations as are passing becoming more wicked can you imagine the burden oh yes of saying my fall caused this I'm going use you now I heard gido in your voice he still lives I heard it I hadn't heard it until last night standing behind the pull pit I heard GTO and my heart my heart I thought God helped my heart cuz be was a phenomenal into mine and we had many Supernatural moments but Isaiah can you imagine without a seat of God inside of you becoming 70 years old and watching your children in a barro come on and knowing that you're falling home produced that but let me tell you brother Isaiah you may have come for this very reason and Satan's battled you over and over again but knowing God lives in your life and look at your restored home you can see your children get the Holy Ghost see them dance in the spirit you can see what Satan hates hallelujah hallelujah H hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God this is going to be difficult now for me before you arrived Thursday was it Thursday you arrived in my home thir but you arrived to my home Thursday I was walking around in a circle in my office and I was walking in a circle you guys have been there I was walking in a circle and I was feeling I was feeling very nervous I was feeling just on edge and I was I was just saying God there's something in this office you want me to see I have a Bible that my mother gave me and I hadn't opened that Bible for quite a long time has a leather bound around it I think Gabe helped make it I did not know that inside of that Bible was three letters that I wrote my mother when I was away from home and I was in a very Fallen condition and I don't want to go there but very Fallen condition and I was thanking her for her prayers and I said I feel so lost I don't know if I'll ever be able to see light the last letter that I wrote by the by the by the date by the way I said mom do you think there's [Music] hope I did not know what it meant I did not until I was getting ready for this service early this morning it caused me to just be extremely nervous I it caused me to just feel so edgy my stomach was just so tore up I didn't share this with sister Cony but looking back at the darkness I knew this message was true and I'm preaching this to somebody I knew this message was true I'd heard that tapes I'd been in the church I had heard the powerful preaching i' saw phenomenal Miracles but in that Fallen condition I'm asking my mom is there hope you see my family amen I've got two boys and a girl I

well welcome there am I can't imagine having my children lost I can't imagine the guilt of what I would feel with sons drunk and drugs and living horrible lives families tore about because I wasn't a good example amen and the first man Adam lived long enough to feel the guilt and to feel the shame but there come another Adam there came another Adam and they hung him on a tree and he stood there with his disciples and said I am the way not one of the ways this isn't up for political assignment I am the way I am the way the truth and the life we all ought to shout right there [Applause] can
