[1:02:47] thankful for that
[1:02:48] for those that don't know last week
[1:02:51] before
[1:02:52] service at home we i saw a vision
[1:02:56] of wesley carrying wesley down the aisle
[1:03:00] and praying with wesley and the visions
[1:03:02] happened just like that and so
[1:03:04] i saw it take place and i just said lord
[1:03:07] and here's my words
[1:03:08] i said lord i'm just a human being i
[1:03:10] said lord he won't come to me
[1:03:15] he won't go to nobody and
[1:03:18] and so i just said lord he won't come to
[1:03:20] me and so
[1:03:22] and so then and then i felt the nudge
[1:03:25] and i felt a nudge and then i felt the
[1:03:27] nudge

[1:03:32] has been miracle after miracle after
[1:03:33] miracle after miracle after miracle
[1:03:36] whether you realize it that's a
[1:03:38] generational
[1:03:40] miracle amen
[1:03:44] and we believe that that weakness in his
[1:03:47] body
[1:03:48] won't be passed to his children
[1:04:05] so when you see him running out of
[1:04:07] church ahead of his mom
[1:04:09] don't you stop him that's a miracle
[1:04:13] amen god bless you amen we love you
[1:04:16] you know god dwells in the praises of
[1:04:18] his people
[1:04:20] he inhabits that's where he lives you
[1:04:22] and i want to be where he lives
[1:04:24] i would be whether where he's at i'd
[1:04:27] rather be there
[1:04:28] than where he was at they'd build
[1:04:32] monuments and places
[1:04:34] because they recognized too late that
[1:04:36] that's where they were but they would
[1:04:37] build a monument to it or a museum to it
[1:04:40] but i want to be where he's at we
[1:04:42] believe
[1:04:43] we're in the last revival just before
[1:04:45] the coming of the lord
[1:04:47] it's called the bride's revival and the
[1:04:50] reason it's going on amongst you because
[1:04:52] you are the bride and it is him
[1:04:55] not a man not a personality not a not
[1:04:58] somebody we're looking to
[1:04:59] it's him that stir in the waters
[1:05:04] hallelujah just get in
[1:05:08] the water's fine just get in we're
[1:05:11] stepping into what adam stepped out of
[1:05:14] he's going to change our bodies not just
[1:05:16] take care of cancer he's going to change
[1:05:18] our bodies
[1:05:18] we're going to be changed in the moment
[1:05:20] of the twinkle of an eye
[1:05:22] it is the mighty angel that is working
[1:05:24] among us and
[1:05:25] he's manifested the word for the day and
[1:05:27] so we're feasting on heavenly manna
[1:05:30] and so the rapture is happening
[1:05:33] you may feel like a caterpillar hang on

[1:07:40] the throne and
[1:07:41] a book written within and on the
[1:07:43] backside seal with seven seals
[1:07:45] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:07:48] with a loud voice
[1:07:49] who is worthy
[1:07:52] to open the book and to loose the seals
[1:07:55] thereof
[1:07:56] and no man in heaven nor in earth
[1:07:59] neither
[1:07:59] under the earth was able to open the
[1:08:01] book neither to look there on
[1:08:03] and i wept much now let me just say this
[1:08:06] to you

[1:08:18] worthy to take the book
[1:08:20] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:08:22] worthy to open and to read the
[1:08:24] read the book neither to look thereon
[1:08:26] and one of the elders
[1:08:28] saith unto me weep not behold the lion
[1:08:32] of the tribe of judah
[1:08:35] the root of david hath prevailed to open
[1:08:39] the book and to loose the seven seals
[1:08:41] thereof
[1:08:42] and i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:08:44] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:08:46] midst of the elders
[1:08:47] stood a lamb this is where our praise
[1:08:49] goes to stood a lamb as it had been
[1:08:53] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:08:55] which are the
[1:08:56] seven spirits of god sent forth into all
[1:08:59] the earth
[1:09:00] and he came and he took the book out of
[1:09:02] the right hand and set up on the throne
[1:09:04] and when he had taken the book and the
[1:09:05] four beasts and the four and twenty
[1:09:07] elders fell
[1:09:08] down before the lamb having every one of
[1:09:11] them hearts
[1:09:12] and golden vowels of holders which are
[1:09:15] the prayers of the saints notice these
[1:09:17] next words
[1:09:18] and they sung a new song

[1:09:25] open the seals thereof
[1:09:27] for thou whistling and hast redeemed us
[1:09:31] to god by the blood out of every kindred
[1:09:34] tongue and people and nation and has
[1:09:36] made us unto god
[1:09:38] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[1:09:40] the earth
[1:09:41] and i beheld and i heard the voice of
[1:09:43] the angels round about the throne and
[1:09:45] the beast and the elders
[1:09:47] and the number of them was ten thousands
[1:09:49] times ten
[1:09:50] thousands thousands of thousands saying
[1:09:52] with a loud voice
[1:09:54] worthy is the lamb that was slain to
[1:09:57] receive
[1:09:57] power and riches and wisdom and strength
[1:10:00] and honor
[1:10:01] and glory and blessing and every
[1:10:03] creature which
[1:10:04] is in heaven and in the earth and under
[1:10:06] the earth and and

[1:10:14] and power unto him that sitteth upon the
[1:10:16] throne unto the lamb for
[1:10:19] ever and ever hallelujah and the four
[1:10:22] beasts said

[1:10:28] that liveth forever and
[1:10:31] ever just go ahead and praise him right

[1:10:43] and glory glory to the lamb of god
[1:10:49] hallelujah you may be seated this
[1:10:51] morning and may the lord bless the
[1:10:53] reading of his word
[1:11:03] i read a statement here a while back
[1:11:05] that really
[1:11:07] struck my heart i thought it was a good
[1:11:08] spot to put it today
[1:11:11] i asked god why are you taking me
[1:11:15] through
[1:11:15] such troubled water
[1:11:19] and he replied because your enemies
[1:11:22] can't swim
[1:11:26] [Applause]
[1:11:35] brother man says let satan take after a
[1:11:38] believer
[1:11:40] listen closely let satan take after a
[1:11:42] believer
[1:11:43] and he's got jesus christ on his hands
[1:11:48] so we turn loose to the one that the
[1:11:51] angel of god
[1:11:52] against the enemy that has troubled you
[1:11:54] and me
[1:11:57] the avenger with blood on his hands
[1:12:00] ready to fight your battle for you
[1:12:04] are you with me listen you think you're
[1:12:07] fighting it alone
[1:12:08] let me just say you and i wouldn't be a
[1:12:10] second in the face of an enemy like we
[1:12:12] have to fight
[1:12:13] but when jesus is on our side we can't
[1:12:20] lose
[1:12:24] times in your life that it looks like
[1:12:26] everything's upside down
[1:12:27] on your job in your home sometimes it
[1:12:31] seems like you can't say a good word in
[1:12:33] your home
[1:12:34] because the tension is so hard the devil
[1:12:37] is fighting it ain't your wife it ain't
[1:12:39] your husband
[1:12:40] that's the devil thought you might drive
[1:12:43] all the way to
[1:12:44] church and not say a word
[1:12:47] maybe an hour at a time and drive and
[1:12:49] not say a word to each other it's the
[1:12:51] devil that does that ain't your husband
[1:12:53] or your wife
[1:12:54] you may go weeks at a time having
[1:12:56] trouble and you think what's wrong
[1:12:59] you married her and she married you you
[1:13:01] love her with all your hearts
[1:13:02] and you may have to go through some
[1:13:04] difficult times this ain't hollywood
[1:13:08] but instead of fighting one another
[1:13:10] fight the devil with all of your heart
[1:13:12] turn the tide on him
[1:13:16] turn the tide on him
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:27] you see the one difference between
[1:13:29] israel
[1:13:30] and the rest of all the nations
[1:13:34] is god
[1:13:38] amen the one difference between israel
[1:13:42] and the rest of the nations what's god
[1:13:48] put god to one side and israel is just
[1:13:50] like any other nation
[1:13:52] when such when samson cut off his hair
[1:13:56] he was just like any other man but the
[1:13:58] leadership of the holy
[1:14:00] ghost assad and the church is nothing
[1:14:02] but the world with god's name attached
[1:14:05] to it
[1:14:09] the world and the church are all
[1:14:12] the same lump just like jacob and esau
[1:14:17] were of their of the same parents
[1:14:20] but the spirit of god makes the
[1:14:24] difference
[1:14:25] [Applause]
[1:14:26] take god out of any of us and we're just
[1:14:29] an animal
[1:14:30] you read the news you see what's going
[1:14:32] on in the world not going to spend a
[1:14:34] second hardly here but i want you to
[1:14:36] understand the difference between them
[1:14:38] and you
[1:14:39] is god the world is falling apart
[1:14:43] because they don't have god
[1:14:45] [Applause]
[1:14:46] the reason that you've made a lot of
[1:14:48] mistakes in your life and you keep
[1:14:50] repeating the same process
[1:14:52] is you don't have god don't blame your
[1:14:55] neighbor
[1:14:56] don't bring your friends don't blame
[1:14:59] somebody else
[1:15:00] blame it on yourself and say i need god
[1:15:04] in my life
[1:15:05] don't wait till tomorrow don't wait till
[1:15:08] next week
[1:15:24] it seems to be the conspiracy condition
[1:15:27] of the church
[1:15:28] they failed to see the hour that they're
[1:15:30] living in
[1:15:32] they're looking for some sensation or
[1:15:34] something
[1:15:35] something way off in the future man is
[1:15:38] forever doing that
[1:15:40] he always blesses god for what he has
[1:15:43] done
[1:15:45] looking forward to what he will do
[1:15:48] and ignore what he's doing
[1:15:52] right i want to say this to you you may
[1:15:55] have accomplished a lot of things this
[1:15:57] past week
[1:15:58] you may be looking forward to accomplish
[1:15:59] a lot of things this coming week
[1:16:02] but the most important thing you're
[1:16:04] doing
[1:16:05] in the both weeks is sitting right here
[1:16:09] don't let satan rock you
[1:16:15] get in the moment of it
[1:16:20] last night we heard about myram
[1:16:23] and meyer i'm taking a tambourine after
[1:16:26] she had watched all of the enemy
[1:16:28] the greatest army in the world
[1:16:43] [Applause]
[1:16:45] and she grabbed a tambourine
[1:16:49] and began to dance it is calculated that
[1:16:53] there were
[1:16:54] 600 adult women 600
[1:16:58] 000 adult women on
[1:17:01] that coast that day i would say
[1:17:05] it was quite a storm
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:08] [Applause]
[1:17:11] you know some people say well we
[1:17:12] shouldn't get emotional this is probably
[1:17:14] not the best service for
[1:17:16] those kind of people but let me just say
[1:17:18] this you
[1:17:20] if seeing your enemies drowned
[1:17:23] don't get you emotional there
[1:17:26] is a problem with your eyes in your
[1:17:30] revelation
[1:17:42] we're not careful we'll occupy a pew
[1:17:45] we'll forget where we came from some of
[1:17:47] us were
[1:17:48] drunks dope addicts harlots prostitutes
[1:17:52] and worse than all of that was religious
[1:17:55] devil set and steal
[1:17:57] you were the same devil on sunday as you
[1:17:59] was on friday
[1:18:02] and what you was in didn't change your
[1:18:04] life but once you come to the revelated
[1:18:06] truth and it changes you from the bottom
[1:18:09] of your souls
[1:18:10] to the top of your head there ought to
[1:18:12] be something thankful for
[1:18:15] you're not a slave to those habits
[1:18:17] anymore in your life
[1:18:19] we ought to stop and give god thanks
[1:18:21] with everything that's within us
[1:18:49] our local denomination
[1:18:52] we don't do it like there like that
[1:18:54] there
[1:18:55] when you go back to your denomination
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:00] and you look at what they approve of

[1:19:05] religion in this business
[1:19:11] we don't believe in perverted living we
[1:19:14] don't really
[1:19:15] drinking and smoking and lying and
[1:19:17] cheating rubbing out on your wife
[1:19:21] abusive little children like them
[1:19:24] catholic priests do out there we are
[1:19:34] believing
[1:19:43] that's straight amen
[1:19:50] second samuel chapter 6 and verse 14
[1:19:54] and david danced before the lord with
[1:19:56] all of his might
[1:19:58] david girded with a linen e plot
[1:20:01] and david also and david
[1:20:04] so david and all the house of israel
[1:20:08] brought up the ark
[1:20:10] of the lord
[1:20:14] we're shouting and with
[1:20:18] the sound of a trumpet and the ark of
[1:20:21] the lord came into the city of david
[1:20:23] michaels and michelle saul's daughter
[1:20:27] looked through a window and saw the king
[1:20:30] leaping
[1:20:31] and dancing before the lord and she
[1:20:34] despised him in her heart
[1:20:39] and they brought in the ark of the lord
[1:20:41] and said it in his place
[1:20:43] and in the midst of the tabernacle and
[1:20:45] david had pitched for it
[1:20:46] and david offered burnt offerings and
[1:20:48] peace offerings before the lord
[1:20:52] and david returned to bless his
[1:20:53] household and michelle the daughter of
[1:20:56] saul
[1:20:56] came out of to meet david and said how
[1:20:59] glorious was the king of israel today
[1:21:02] who uncovered himself today in his in
[1:21:04] the eyes of the handmaidens
[1:21:06] and of his servants as one
[1:21:09] of a vain fellow shamelessly uncovereth
[1:21:12] himself
[1:21:14] and david said unto michelle it was
[1:21:17] before the lord
[1:21:19] we are dancing for a man we ain't
[1:21:21] dancing for some
[1:21:23] personality we're dancing for god
[1:21:27] our worship is to god amen
[1:21:29] [Applause]
[1:21:34] and it was before the lord which chose
[1:21:36] me before thy father
[1:21:38] and before all his house to anoint me
[1:21:40] ruler over the people of the lord over
[1:21:42] israel therefore i will play before the
[1:21:45] lord
[1:21:47] and i will yet
[1:21:50] be thou more vile than this
[1:21:54] and will base in my own
[1:21:57] sight of the handmaids
[1:22:01] my maidservants which thou hast spoken
[1:22:05] of
[1:22:05] of them shall i be had in honor
[1:22:10] now i want you to just notice
[1:22:13] to the critic of praise
[1:22:20] to the church that refuses worship
[1:22:24] like you say well brother ron we're
[1:22:26] aware of another nationality we don't
[1:22:29] have the american spirit on us
[1:22:31] let me just say this to you being a
[1:22:34] german
[1:22:36] being a european
[1:22:40] being whatever you are that's not give
[1:22:42] you excuse
[1:22:44] to be lazy in your worship
[1:22:57] preacher to the janitor
[1:23:03] you have a responsibility before god
[1:23:08] and let me just say this you this is why
[1:23:10] churches are dead
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:13] someday i want to preach again on the
[1:23:15] autopsy of a dead church
[1:23:17] this is why churches die they refuse to
[1:23:20] give praise
[1:23:22] they refuse to give an atmosphere to
[1:23:24] where children will come
[1:23:26] and enjoy the presence of the lord where
[1:23:29] they'll grow up
[1:23:31] in an atmosphere of worship
[1:23:42] so go ahead with your dead self let your
[1:23:45] church die
[1:23:46] god's going to have a church without
[1:23:49] spark
[1:23:50] or without blemish that will not be
[1:23:54] ashamed to worship the lord
[1:24:13] it reminds me of the story brother
[1:24:15] brahman says he said it reminds me of a
[1:24:16] story of a fellow had a great big
[1:24:18] fine barn he built a great big fine barn
[1:24:22] just as dignified and classy as if you
[1:24:24] could be
[1:24:25] but he was too lazy to farm
[1:24:30] there was a farmer live close to him he
[1:24:32] didn't have much of a barn
[1:24:34] but he really was a farmer he put plenty
[1:24:37] of good food in that barn
[1:24:40] in that barn that year two little cows
[1:24:43] was born one in one barn one in the
[1:24:45] other
[1:24:46] when springtime come they turned the
[1:24:49] little calves out of the stall
[1:24:52] that little calf over there over here
[1:24:54] had been fed real good
[1:24:56] my when that wind began to hit it hit
[1:25:00] him oh my he kicked up his heels
[1:25:02] and away he went as hard as he could
[1:25:05] starting
[1:25:06] and a jumping and a bucking and going on
[1:25:10] the other farmer turned his out and over
[1:25:13] there
[1:25:14] he had had nothing to eat but weeds too
[1:25:17] lazy to farm
[1:25:18] too lazy to feed him puts me in a mind
[1:25:20] of some of these pastors
[1:25:26] too lazy to trifle just dignified barns
[1:25:30] is all you got
[1:25:32] [Applause]
[1:25:36] some food in there for that calf the
[1:25:38] baptism of the holy ghost preached with
[1:25:40] power it'll scorch them that's right but
[1:25:42] that's what they need is some good
[1:25:44] old-fashioned scorching
[1:25:45] that's what the church needs members
[1:25:48] needs
[1:25:49] this little old calf and men poor little
[1:25:51] fella out in the stall so thin he could
[1:25:53] hardly walk
[1:25:55] peeped around the crack looked across
[1:25:57] and he seen the other tap just as
[1:25:58] snorting
[1:25:59] he was all fat and round thank god to be
[1:26:02] fat and round
[1:26:03] he felt good he had been eating all
[1:26:05] winter that little starved calf looked
[1:26:08] up and said
[1:26:09] such fanaticism
[1:26:14] my sure he wasn't too skinny to think
[1:26:16] anything else
[1:26:17] but i tell you when that one that had
[1:26:20] been
[1:26:21] fattened up all winter he knew where he
[1:26:24] was at
[1:26:26] he was having a good time with that warm
[1:26:28] wind begin to blow on him
[1:26:30] and any man that's not the born again of
[1:26:32] the spirit of god
[1:26:34] they'll call him a fanatic and anything
[1:26:36] else but when that warm
[1:26:38] spring holy ghost wind begins to come
[1:26:40] like it did on the day of pentecost
[1:26:43] something's going to take place
[1:26:51] the warm winds is going to begin to blow
[1:26:54] brother you're all fattened up with the
[1:26:55] gospel
[1:26:56] been feeling good kick up your heels
[1:27:00] had a good time
[1:27:06] that's the way myram did she looked back
[1:27:09] down and saw them old things that they
[1:27:11] were once
[1:27:12] once done was all dead and gone
[1:27:15] they'd they'd done seeing god accepted
[1:27:19] blood
[1:27:20] seen his power in divine healing
[1:27:22] standing between them
[1:27:24] through the red sea baptized with the
[1:27:27] spirit walked on the other side
[1:27:29] just having a good time they didn't care
[1:27:32] what some organization thought about it
[1:27:35] what a perfect type it is today of a
[1:27:37] believer
[1:27:38] who will dare to step out
[1:27:42] god's promised that he'd supply every
[1:27:45] need
[1:27:47] he promised he'd supply our every need
[1:27:51] he never told them i'll make a way he
[1:27:53] never told them
[1:27:54] i will make a way of your healing i will
[1:27:57] make a way of this or this make a way of
[1:27:59] that
[1:28:00] he said i will be with you
[1:28:04] he said to us i will be with you even in
[1:28:07] you to the end of the world
[1:28:08] that's all i have to say
[1:28:12] you don't have to argue this this that
[1:28:14] or the other
[1:28:15] if he's here that satisfies me
[1:28:18] divine healing's here
[1:28:22] divine healing's here power is here
[1:28:29] everything that he was is here now
[1:28:34] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:28:37] in for helper
[1:28:40] you can take your theology and drown
[1:28:42] with it
[1:28:44] but brother i believe that jesus christ
[1:28:48] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:28:51] i believe i will be with you even in you
[1:28:54] to the
[1:28:56] [Applause]
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:29:06] this is what this next quote is what
[1:29:08] started this entire sermon
[1:29:13] and today the scientific theory of
[1:29:18] modern
[1:29:20] so-called religious groups has tried to
[1:29:24] prove
[1:29:26] that this blessing blesseth thing that
[1:29:28] we have called the holy spirit
[1:29:31] is only emotion
[1:29:34] see if it just don't stand up according
[1:29:38] to their scientific theory
[1:29:41] well i would like to ask them this
[1:29:45] what makes them change
[1:29:50] what makes a drunkard stop drinking
[1:29:54] what makes a prostitute cease from her
[1:29:57] evil living
[1:30:00] what makes the cancer
[1:30:03] the disease depart from people yeah i'm
[1:30:06] talking to you satan you might as well
[1:30:08] stay and miss it
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:17] some of these puny weep wimpy preachers
[1:30:20] that ain't never had to go through
[1:30:21] nothing
[1:30:22] can stand up and challenge the devil
[1:30:24] thank god for their carriage
[1:30:26] but i can stand here with brain cancer
[1:30:28] lung cancer
[1:30:29] cancer in my body god's a healer
[1:30:52] is that emotion
[1:30:56] it has emotion with it
[1:30:59] anything that's alive has a motion
[1:31:05] and anything that doesn't have emotion
[1:31:08] is
[1:31:08] dead i want to remind you god's not
[1:31:12] coming back for a mannequin blood
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:22] he's not coming back for a religious
[1:31:24] play toy
[1:31:26] i could have put it in other language
[1:31:29] he's coming back for a bride that's got
[1:31:32] life on the inside of her here's life
[1:31:46] excuse the expression but i think we
[1:31:48] ought to bury some of these
[1:31:49] dead emotionless religions
[1:31:53] because it's dead it has no emotion
[1:31:58] to it anything any religion that has
[1:32:01] not emotion should be
[1:32:05] buried
[1:32:05] [Applause]
[1:32:08] because it's emotional
[1:32:13] [Music]
[1:32:15] jesus when he entered into the city the
[1:32:17] children of of all of them and all of
[1:32:19] his friends crying holds diana
[1:32:23] hosanna him that cometh in the name of
[1:32:25] the lord
[1:32:27] and those religionists of that day
[1:32:29] couldn't stand it
[1:32:30] right it was too emotional
[1:32:35] he said if they if they hold
[1:32:39] their peace this is in your red letter
[1:32:42] edition bible
[1:32:43] if they hold their peace their rocks
[1:32:47] will immediately cry out
[1:32:50] [Applause]
[1:32:51] something must must cry out
[1:32:54] because there's life there
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:01] he said i can prove that anything
[1:33:03] without emotion is dead
[1:33:05] so your religion has got any emotion
[1:33:08] about it
[1:33:09] bury it and get one that's got
[1:33:13] life in it
[1:33:20] there's a strange thing
[1:33:23] every word jesus is
[1:33:27] there's a lot of noise
[1:33:34] where god is makes a lot of noise
[1:33:39] so this should be your barometer
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:46] if you're able to set through these
[1:33:48] services with your hands crossed
[1:33:51] and your lips locked together
[1:33:54] [Music]
