one of his children he picked another Daisy for his for his garden so we we certainly love and appreciate um each and every one of you and we thank you for all that you're doing and standing with the message message of the hour and we it's good to be back home I appreciate brother Matthew and brother William covering for us while we were away at brother Donnie Reagan and I failed that failed to me uh be mentioned last weekend but I certainly appreciated our brothers taking taking their position here and preaching the word and uh they just did a fantastic job and and um I'm just Gathering maybe a little bit of inspiration from them brothers uh Services uh this weekend and and uh while while before I get to the preaching of the word tonight after church I need to have a meeting um with the with the deacons uh the ushers the musicians and the sound text right after service this evening amen if you can if you can just stay after a few minutes and uh we just need some bit need to attend to some business there so do you love the Lord amen amen amen I know you do that's why you're here so amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in in the Book of Psalms chapter chapter 119 and verse 97 amen Psalms 119 and 97 amen amen oh he's all right he ain't going to hurt nobody he's my number one am maner so amen he knows if I'm taking my jacket off I'm getting ready to preach so he always told me when he sitting up here by on that drum he said Andrew you might as well take that jacket off you know you ain't going to wear it so so so I'm just doing what a Elder Deacon's telling me to do so amen we certainly love brother medas amen amen amen Psalms 119 and verse 97 tonight I'd like to speak to you a thought um it's been on my heart actually dropped in my heart while I was there at brother Donnie's while I was preaching I would like to take a thought here this evening on on the understanding of sons the understanding of sons and the Bible says here oh how I love thy law it is my meditation all the day though through thy Commandments through thy Commandments has made me wiser than my enemies forever for they are ever with me I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation I understand more than the Ancients because I keep thy precepts I have refrained my feet from every evil way that I might keep thy word I have not departed from thy judgments for thou Hast taught me how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth a that powerful to recognize all the way in Revelations chapter 10 it's sitting right here in front of us that through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way also John chapter 5 verse 24 and then we'll let you have your seats this evening Jesus says here verely verily which means absolutely absolutely I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life may God bless the reading of the word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord and we just want to take just a little bit of time here this afternoon and begin to take a little thought on that understanding of sons and Jesus said that he that heareth my word and if you're familiar with the message brother brandham told us he said now he said that word heareth he said it means understand he said it means understand he said that he that understandeth he that understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and brother Ron picks that up in the Easter seal and he said but he that understandeth he said he that knoweth his place in this hour it's he that knoweth his place in this hour and I think it's wonderful to be able to recognize the hour that we're living in we don't want to just simply look back into the scriptures of old and see Abraham's time and Noah's time and and Moses's time but we want to recognize the hour that we are living in because if we don't recognize the hour that we are living in we won't recognize the message of the hour it's just like when Abraham was sitting at the tent door when MDC showed up at the tent door it was a signal unto Abraham that the time of his change was drawing nigh and every time that you begin to see in the message you you begin to see the angel of the Lord show up it was a sign of a junction and when Abraham recognized that it was the same voice that had spoke to him all the days of his life it was a signal unto him that he would recognize that that the time of the prophecy was drawing nigh and brother Matthew had referred and I'm not going to repr preach a sermon but but he referred to Daniel chapter 9 and I was just drawing a little inspiration from his message upon that there in Daniel 9 that we we recognize that Daniel the Bible said that Daniel understood by the books of Jeremiah that the 70 years were almost accomplished it was a sign or a signal unto Daniel because he was able to understand the time that he was living in in that time of Prophecy that that there which Jeremiah had spoke about was getting ready to be fulfilled that those times were were coming to an end that's what he said in Jeremiah 29 that that in verse 10 that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I'll visit you notice it's a very powerful and well-known scripture in verse 11 says I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayi the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and Daniel was able to look back into the scriptures and look back there and understand the time that he was living in and that the time that he was at was a time that was coming to and expected there that God was giving them and expected in and you begin to study out Daniel's life you beg begin to find out that the Bible said about Daniel is that Daniel was of an excellent spirit that Daniel be to he began when he came into the king that he came in there that he purposed within himself that he was not going to defile himself with the king's meat and the King's drink because Daniel had an understanding that his life was different from any of the other Magi that were down there in that land but Daniel had a purpose that was upon his life and if you study out Daniel's life you'll find that Daniel was 68 years old when he comes to this position when he begins to recognize that he's coming to the Fulfillment of the time of Prophecy that Daniel was sending there and he'd been all the way there since he was a little bitty old boy that you'll study that he'd been back down there in Babylon ever since he was 12 to 14 years old he been down there living in the time of Babylon and brother random said that he had been down there all that time he hadn't had anybody else to worship with him except the three h boys he said he didn't have any hym books he he was cast out of his church he was an alien outside outside of his church he said he didn't have no church to go to he didn't have no himno to ring except for the to read or sing except for what he sang he didn't have anybody else to sacrifice with because he was living in a Babylonian tradition time and he was setting the there and he had to do all of those things in secret but all of that time for 68 years Daniel held the victory all that time because he knew that there was coming a time that captivity was going to be broken and to think that he was living right down there in the midst of all those heathens and he still had the Victory and brother random said he said he stood down there 68 years he said but some of us can't stay here an hour Oh my he said but Daniel was standing alone with God and he held the victory right there I think it's powerful when you begin to study out Daniel's life that Daniel said he begin to understand by the reading of the books that the time of the hour was getting ready to be accomplished he looked at the scripture and he looked at the time piece and he recognized that victory was at hand and if I would be able to point you to anything I would want to point you to this that the time of the amorites that the cup of the amorites is full and we recognize that by the UN that by the preaching of the word that we can say like Daniel we understand by the opening of the word that the time is at hand that the lamb has come to lay a claim upon his possession that all the Mysteries that were held back from the Church of the Living God that there the lamb was waiting he was waiting for redemptions claims what was he he was waiting for this hour for this time and we recognize by the understanding of the books that we recognize that this is the hour when the lamb stood up in this generation that the lamb stood up and took the book and he said he said now look he said Satan you can't touch that book what was on that book we understand by the message it was your names that was upon that book so God was not going to allow that book to fall back into the dirty hands of Satan so God allowed that book to go back into the original hands of the the one that wrote your name before the foundation of the world and all throughout time your name has been held in a savior it's been held in the hands of the almighty God and we understand that this is the hour when the seals have been ripped off the back of the book and we understand we've been adopted as a son and daughter of God but our full adoption which is our body change is literally right here upon us to think about it tonight that the Rapture is at to think that your body change is at hand I believe that if anybody can say that they understand that the Rapture is nigh unto them it ought to be the Church of the Living God to be able to say I've Not Just heard a word but I've understood a word because if you just hear something it doesn't mean that you understand something a prostitute can hear the preaching of the word but they don't change a drunkard can hear the word but they don't change but where the power is it's when you understand by the preaching of the word you see it's he that understandeth and when you understand it shows that you are an eagle it shows that you had something on the inside of you that would cause you to understand who you are as an identified son and daughter of God that you have the authority by the message of the hour to cast down every demon cast down every Power cast down every influence of Hell by the understanding of the books we recognize it Hallelujah now when Jesus rolls when Jesus is rolling through his ministry and he goes into Matthew chapter 16 and there when you begin to study out Matthew 16 you'll find that the Pharisees came to him and they were asking of him a sign and Jesus turned he turned to them and he rebuked them but he turned to his disciples and he told them now you be Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees you see and his disciples were in a carnal realm in that moment and they said well it's just he's saying this because we didn't bring any bread with us he said no he said I'm not talking to you about that what did he do he begin to open up the scriptures and he begin to speak to them he said I'm not talking to you about natural bread what did he do he opened the scriptures and their eyes were open to the fact that he's not talking about natural bread he's talking about the doctrine of the Pharisees he said Beware of those things and Jesus rose right over and he takes him over to ciser Philippi and he asks him this question whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some say thou art Elias but he turned to Peter and said but who do you say that I am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and to think about this to put it into perspective here Peter is standing upon the Earth but he was grabbing a hold of a revelation that came from Heaven he was standing on Earth but there was an understanding that came from Heaven he said he said Peter he said your father didn't give you this understanding your mother didn't give you this understanding but my Father which is in heaven hath revealed this unto you notice what he did he said now I give unto you the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven what was Jesus doing he was putting the believer in his position and he was bringing forth the revelation of the church in its power that by the power of Revelation you have the power to bind and you have the power to loose it's not by understanding of your mind but it's by the spiritual revelation of who Jesus Christ is that you have the power to bind Satan if it's that powerful that you can bind every spirit and any thing below him it is that powerful enough to loose all of Heaven to your situations it's not something that it's man's madeup idea but this is a revelation that came from God that you have the power to bind Satan but you have the power to loose the Holy Ghost over your situation and only Sons understand this there's been many of people that read the word read the written word but they don't have the revelation of it and what makes you a powerful group of people is not because you're a well- read group it's because of who you are it's because you recognize your position you see who you are in the scripture by a revelation what happened something rode out of an Unseen World and dropped in your heart and gave you a revelation and brother Brandon picks that up if it is the rising of the sun he said that was a divine revelation of the word made flesh he said but if it was made flesh in the day by the son he said the groom he said it's got to be fleshed today by the bride it's got to be flesh to dat by the bride that's why when brother random turned he turned to him he said that's the reason why he stood up there in Matthew chapter 28 and he told them to baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost he said because the disciples knew who he was they knew they wasn't going to baptize in titles because they knew who he was that's the reason he's given you so much power is because you recognize who he is and brother random would say it and he said now it don't take no Revelation to understand baptism he said but it does take an understanding to understand or to look and have a revelation on the godhead but John said in 1 John 5 and7 that there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the spirit and the son and these three are one but there are three that bear record on Earth there is a water blood and spirit and they are not the same but they agree in one what is it it is a sign unto us that you can have the son you can't separate the son from the Holy Ghost you can't separate God from the sun he said but you can be justified without being Sanctified and you can be Sanctified without having the baptism of the Holy Ghost but glory be to God there is another church under this messenger who knows who she is will be a final Runner a final age why is it they understand their position come on somebody you're not just a Justified group under Luther you're not just a Sanctified group under Wesley but you are a fully adopted Sons and Daughters of God under Malachi 4's Ministry baptized by the message there's a lot of people that don't understand what it is but you have been baptized under Malachi 4's Ministry so it gave you an understanding I tell you like brother brandom said it he said the rest of the world they need their brains baptized you say what's wrong with you you've been brainwashed brother angrew absolutely I don't have my mind no more I've got the mind of almighty God I don't understand as a Spencer I don't understand as a grandson of hom of phas but I understand as a Son of God blessed be the name of the Lord it ain't just for William brandham it ain't just for Paul it ain't just for the church age Messengers it's for me and my [Applause] house glory be to God we've moved past the days of Luther we needed what Luther preached we needed what Wesley preached we need the restoration of the gifts but this is the hour the Bri Jer what is that brother Andrew it is the age in Le oosa that the Bride Comes to her position William brandham is not putting us outside of the Le OA Church age it's the same thing that he would say it's a golden age it's an eagle age it's a token age it's a bride age just like we could say that this is the age of television it was this age that television was released it was this age that iPhone came into existence and it is in this age that the bride understands she understands who he is and she understands who she is beside him what is it it is a divine revelation that literally unlocks the door you see what it is it's faith that unlocks the door you see what faith is Faith takes you it's like a ladder Faith takes you from hearing ground to receiving ground you can hear that you're healed on the ground here but faith will take you on the receiving ground up there and what did this message do it took you from the ground of being a child it took you from being a child and to recognizing your position as an heir and it placed you as an adult in Jesus Christ that's exactly what brother bandam said in the key to the door that the Holy Ghost is a witness of Resurrection that he's showing you that you have become an adult in Christ what are you talking about brother Andrew I'm talking about what Paul was saying to the church there in Galatians that verse chapter 4 he said I say this unto you that the heir as long as he is a child he differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so what did the message do what did the baptism of the Holy Ghost do it took you from a child but it baptized you unto an adult in Christ Jesus what is that what am I talking about I'm saying that this is a divine revelation that has been unlocked to the Church of the Living God it's just like when men when men are studying out to be a be be a musician or trying to study out to be a a technician or trying to study out to be a carpenter or something what are they doing there's trying to study they're accumulating things they're going to school they're learning these things they're picking up things here or there and it's like a child that's having trouble in school the teacher can teach them to they're blue in the face and it seems like they're never going to get it but when the child begins to learn himself then he begins to accumulate the knowledge you see you it's just like a preacher it's just like a preacher he can study he can be in the right atmosphere but you let the people come in and they've got their mind on the world and they got their mind on this or maybe they had a blow up before church they're not on the same level as the minister is and they're not going to capture what the minister is putting down they're not on the same level of understanding but if the power of Revelation can sweep down through a Channel of faith that that person will begin to by faith begin to block out the things that happen today and the things that happened yesterday and to forget the things that took place it's a powerful thing when you can get on the same level as a preacher that's preaching the word then you begin to see Miracles take place that's when you begin to see manifestations of the Holy Ghost is when the preaching of the word and the people get to the same level then you watch as the atmosphere shifts I don't know why we're here but we're bringing you to an understanding by the preaching of the word what does the word literally do it brings you from the Molly Groves and it takes you into an atmosphere of a spiritual astronaut that's what the message did in this hour it brought you from an understanding as a Pentecostal babe and it brought you to a stature of a full perfect man ad dope man in Jesus Christ come on somebody when you was in Pentecost it was all works it was all this that or the other but what did the church do what did the message do in this generation it came to cap off your life by the token life of Jesus Christ when brother Bram draws out the Pyramid of the stature of a perfect man building up the man on faith Temperance the loveing kindness self-control and all of the fruits there building it out what does he do he caps It Off by the Holy Ghost so when you receive Hallelujah when you receive the Holy Ghost you don't have to work your way into faith faith is a foundation you don't have to work your way into brotherly kindness if you get capped off with the baptism of the Holy Ghost all of those virtues are in you hallelujah what are you talking about brother Andrew I'm talking about that there is a power in where you're born at just like when Cain and Abel when they were standing there in the Book of Genesis 4 and five that you'll begin to see by the seed that was on the inside of them what they were producing and you seen by the serpent seed what Cain begin to produce he accumulated Knowledge from his father is that right his serpent he was showing his seed but Abel by the seed that was on the inside of him accumulated Revelation showing that it had to be blood there what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying that what you have accumulated in this hour is something greater than your own knowledge I'm saying no man taught you this I'm saying that the Holy Ghost did what he said that he would do that he would lead you he would guide you he would teach you the truth hallelujah one brother bandam comes and he preaches in 1963 on September the 1st he preaches a token message there brother brandom he comes in there and he's laying he's laying down there in final closing out final final chapters of the token there brother Bram is preaching at his own church and he's laying he's laying some fundamental Foundation Faith some real key truths that are laying there but brother randam comes in and he begins to he's coming down and he starts talking about the mystical Body of Christ and brother Brandon when he comes there he begins to Fumble around on the word of Mystic Body of Christ and he says it's the mythical Body of Christ we know what a myth Mythic we know what a myth is it's something that's false it's something that it's something that's made up and brother B said it's the mythical Body of Christ and notice brother brandham said if you a listen to it that the Holy Spirit stops brother brandham and said you said that wrong you said that wrong go back and say it again what did he do he stops and says that's why we need the Holy Spirit and not education he said it's the Mystic Body of Christ now goes on to say this he said now it'll be for something he said cuz he wouldn't have said it that way he said he is here he is here right now he's here right at the pulpit he's right out there it's him in him Is No Death in him is no sorrow in him is no weer in him is no sin in him is no sickness in him Is No Death and we are in him he said if Satan tries to hand you something like sickness just take your token and apply it oh my take your token and apply it that you are a purchased product of Jesus Christ the token stands that your fair is paid notice he says Satan says when you die you're lost say you're wrong you're wrong I have purchased I have the purchased product I am a purchased product I have the token what is the token he knows what it is he knows what it is well you say brother Andrew I don't necessarily know what the token is but Satan does he knows what it is he said don't fool with him he knows what it is he said now you might talk some of these preachers and they'd argue with it he said but not Satan he knows better he said he comes against it two or three times you know and he made a mistake of Temptation Satan knows what you're talking about just show that token and he'll Fly Away what am I talking about I'm talking about when Jesus is up there and Satan makes his three us helmets against Jesus on the lust of the flesh the pride of life and the lust of the eye what does he do he tempts him in his mortal body but Jesus don't use some Supernatural power he takes the same thing that you've been given in this hour to defeat Satan with he give you the greatest thing he ever could give you when he gave you the word of God and he said it's by this word it is written I think it's very powerful I think it's whole I think it's powerful because the Lord allowed us a glimpse into the supernatural right there because there are things about the supernatural that Humanity does not understand is that right there are things that happen in services like this that we don't understand understand there are things that we don't understand that is happening when somebody raises up and shouts there are things that happen when somebody raises up their hand we don't understand what's happening but it's supernatural actually if you study brother brandom you you can find it one time when brother B said did you see that lady slip up her hand right there he said the pillar of fire went across her when she raised her hand right there there are elements that are in this building that we don't fully understand but because of who we are it has given us an understanding I think it's powerful because we caught a glimpse right here of the supernatural that he uses the feebleness of humanity to show and prove he is the omnipotent one that there is one standing at the pulpit that maybe you don't see him maybe you don't recognize him but there is somebody that is still at the pulpit today and we are in him in him Is No Death in him is no weakness in him is no weakness hallelujah what did he say he said he's here right now at the pulit he's here out there maybe you don't see it maybe you don't understand it but he took the feebleness of William brandham and said say it again you didn't say it right the first time say it again I feel 10,000 vots running through me right now where'd you get that understanding brother H where did you get that power brother Timothy where did you get that understanding it came from another world it came from another realm why do you believe you're going in a Rapture I didn't get that understanding on my own why do you believe you have every right to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost I didn't get it on my own but there came a world that tapped into this world and said you're born for this world Hallelujah tonight's your night tonight's the night to get the Holy Ghost tonight's the night to get your healing tonight's a night to get your deliverance hallelujah hallelujah where'd you get that understanding to think that it wasn't for days gone by it's for right now what is it somebody at the pulpit what was it it was an angel that was leading William brandham that would take him through the scriptures he didn't gain that knowledge all on his own it was somebody standing there Hallelujah when William brandom comes back after brother brother Neville stands there and preaches on Easter morning 1962 he said I went back home he said I wrote down a few few notes and he preaches a three and a half sermon three and a half hour sermon on the restoration of the brid tree on a few notes now tell me who was leading the Kentucky hillbilly through the Scriptures it wasn't the mind of a Kentucky man it was a mind of almighty God that was releasing dispensational dispensational changes in this hour Hallelujah what is it now watch what watch what Paul says in Ephesians 1 that the god at verse 17 that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of the Pope in the knowledge of him it ain't the knowledge of William brandom this ain't the knowledge of Homer phas this ain't the knowledge of some man that's why William Brandon would stand there I believe it's recognizing your day in message he said you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man I know that stumbles some people because they don't understand the son of man but the son of man is the word what was it it wasn't the seventh angel it was the mighty angel that was standing there notice what he says verse 18 that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened brother bham captures that in the adoption he said you understand with your heart he said that's what he's talking about you look with your eye but you see with your heart what did Jesus say to us if you seek with me with your whole heart then you'll find me what he goes on to say that the eyes of your understand being enlightened that you might know what is the hope of his calling and what the Riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints there some wonderful truth right there well follow me down there to verse 22 notice what he says and Heath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all said now if my body has the power over all things then what my body is is what I am now I know I'm not the only child here I'm still a child but I don't talk like a child no more I don't understand as child no more but I I know that I'm not the only child in the building but when I was little I was little one time we was getting ready for church and me and Alan Price was out there outside our home in in Pilot Virginia we mom mom and sister Carla had us me and Allan dressed up real nice and then we had ourselves a a good rain we got out there and we got to making us some mud pies we decided it was a great idea to plaster the home when Mama come out there I thought I was a child I was beginning to understand that she was an adult I looked at her I said Mama just like any old child would do I said Mama it wasn't me it was my hand and she gave me a real quick real quick understanding brother Chris she beat my T she beat my she beat me tarnation out of me she looked at me know she said brother Jim it wasn't me it was my hand I had an standing there was a person involved there's a person involved so you can't separate me from my hand William brandom said who is me who owns his hand so what my body is is what I am so what my body does is what I am so Jesus said that all that I am is under my feet do you hear what I'm saying to [Applause] you that you are my body that I fill you with all and all that is within me if my hands are me if my feet are me it ain't my feet it's Jesus feet it ain't my knowledge it's his knowledge oh blessed be the name of the Lord now are we the son of God not someday in the future not someday coming but right now is the Church of the Living God under an [Applause] understanding Hallelujah I saw brother Gabriel lay his hand on somebody and I watched him get healed it wasn't brother Gabriel it was the body of Christ I saw brother Ron have a vision of coming back here coming back to a full restoration it wasn't brother Ron it was a body I saw Zoe get her healing but it wasn't it was a body move I saw sister Elena buts receive healing from stage four Loma somebody came to a recognition who they are as sons of God we're not leaning on our own understanding we're leaning on the UN Everlasting arm arms oh blessed be the name of the Lord he that lath wisdom let him ask and God will give it [Applause] liberally I feel the Winds of Change that's moving across the body of Jesus Christ you're no longer a chicken you're no longer got Barnyard identity you no longer got Barnard knowledge you're an eagle come up here when I was a chicken I understood I a chicken but when I recognized I was an eagle I didn't think like a chicken no more I didn't talk like a chicken no more I recognized who I was and William brandham said in the rising of the sun he said that changed their Dynamics the Dynamics Chang their language I know it's a paradox but Satan is so scared of you he's so scared of you Gavin he's so scared of you that he would try to Rob your life from a little bitty old child and keep you from coming to the recognition of who you are but Satan didn't have enough because a Daddy had an understanding House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ that's what's so powerful about you brother Denny is you recognize your position House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus [Applause] Hallelujah when it comes to the Book of Esther which is you of coming to your position it's a beautiful it's a beautiful type of Christ the bride of Christ but the Bible tells us in Esther chapter 6 that the King was having a sleepless night and he went there and he asked that the scriptures be delivered unto him and when he took the book brother Jason Jackson brought this out he said that when he took the book he said there's a tradition in Jewish law that said the winds blew the scripture over to the spot where Mori reminded and sered notice that there was somebody that was attacking the kingdom that it brought it to a position the winds rolled the scriptures into position what am I saying unto you that there is a church that has that has that cannot sleep she has been woke up by the sh Glory by the sounding of the seven Thunders uttering their voices she's been wake woke up to the fact that there's a fire in Her Bones there's an anointing on the inside of her that wherever she goes she has a third pole in her wherever she speaks she has a third pole in her and she's been woke up that the same fire that fell on the day of Pentecost it's the same fire what am I saying I'm saying the same sword that fell in William bram's hand after there in Sabino Canyon is the same sword that is in the bride's hand right now you've been woke up to the thought or to the fact that this ain't just a denominational Revival this ain't some emotional workup I'm going preach to you real quick this ain't some emotional workup this ain't something that a man is doing but you have been woke up to the fact that this is a brid's Revival ah come on somebody it's changed it's change it here what am I saying I'm saying you need to change your mind you need to change your mind we living in an hour where men have lost the mindset of who they are men think they're women and women think they're men men have made up their mind that they want to change they want to change from this gender to that gender but the Bride of Jesus Christ has made up her mind I won't be Leia I won't be lukewarm I won't be Pentecostal but I'll be an acts to Church of the Living God brother Andrew I've been in a message for 30 years sometimes you need a change you can get in a tradition of setting in your Pew and just enjoying worship the way it is or the way that it was what you need to do is change change your mind come on somebody if you've been praying the same old prayer for the past 15 years and you ain't seen nothing happen it's time you change your language change your prayer routine change how you read the Bible change how you listen to the message I ain't talking about something on the external I'm talking about something on the internal because you can change your hair you can change your dress you can change your makeup but a pig can change it same way but it's still a pig on the inside but if you get baptized not just with an anointing not just with a Zeal but with a genuine token life it'll change your body well I felt the move of the Holy Spirit years ago but a sudden understands he can have it again I felt to when brother Homer was behind the pit you can have an understanding you can feel it again I got filled 50 years ago but there's an understanding you can get filled again come on somebody if we saw Maru Mariah puit receive healing over her body then why can't he do it for Sister Barbara then why can't he do it for sister to Kaye if he's that kind of a God and I happen to believe that he is because I got an understanding he is the Lord Our God and he changes not where'd you get that understanding from I got it from my father he said I came in my father's name but you receed me not but to them that received me to them I gave power to be the come the sons of God [Applause] where' you get the understanding that you can think that cancer can leave a body because we watched it leave sister Hade Waldorf when she told her husband said if I die take me through that prayer line even if I die it was a testimony that she died right there and she was behind the curtain and they called William brandham to come over there and lay his hands on her and pray for her he said I was just going over there to encourage the family he said but all of a sudden he said I begin to pray and I felt a hand jerk and she come back to life I'm telling you that Doug Hill ain't the only one that can come back to life again I say by the name of Jesus Christ that [Applause] prodical what good you going to do to talk about the days gone by what good is it going to do for you take a man that's freezing to death and paint him a cold painted fire and set him out there beside it said try to get warm by it he'll never get warm what Good's it going to do to try to present to the Church of the Living God and have a picture of the Holy Ghost in Fire come on somebody what they need is a reality I tell you right now I respect the pillar of Fire I respect that picture and I would rather you tell me that you look at the pillar fire that is hanging over William brandom than for you to sit here and say you saw the pillar of fire sweeping into this room why because William brandham said that your eyes can play trick on you he said but the mechanical device can't lie so for you to recognize that that's a pillar of fire it's a powerful thing but we don't want just a picture of it we want the reality of it well what are you talking about brother Andrew I'm talking about when you showed up in this building tonight that you are the reality that the purifier has returned to the [Applause] church now brother random when it comes to this morning church age he said now he said now comes our Triumph triumphal Capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he turns to J Galatians 4 and verse4 but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God ha sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father when wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son Thou Art no more a servant but a son come on prodigal come on prodigal I can go back to my father's house and I can be a servant there but he was always a son he was always a son no more a servant but a son and of a son than an heir of God through Christ there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished Redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price thereby placed us as Sons he did not make us Sons for we were already Sons but he placed us as Sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as Sons we were held captive by the devil but we were Sons nonetheless and hear this and because you are Sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry father father notice what he says he said upon whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost Sons at Corinth upon sons while they heard the word what is a baptism of what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost brother random it is the bapt it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of God coming in and feeling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of good conscience towards God what am I saying that you no longer have the mindset of a servant you have the mindset of an adult in Christ Jesus that's why William Brandon would say that every son when he comes to his position that God gives him a checkbook and sign at the bottom of that checkbook is the name of Jesus Christ what am I saying to you I'm saying that you ought to have an understanding brother B said if John D Rockefeller would come here and he would write me and I would ask him for a million dollars to build me a church he said I would be able to cash it because I believe that John D Ro Rockefeller has the money in his bank if Trump walks into this building and I ask him for a million dollars to build me a church I got confidence that he could build me a church so if y'all know him call him up cuz they coming and we going to need a building he said now if I could do that with John D Rockefeller how much more could I do that with Jesus Christ when I know he's got everything when I know he owns it all when I know that he owns everything then how much more should I be able to go to Jesus Christ and say father you said at and you shall receive you said by your stripes we are healed what am I saying to you that you ought to understand that there's healing for you you ought to understand that faith is the key that unlocks every single promise you ought to understand that depression is underneath of you you ought to understand that cancer is nothing but a password to Jesus Christ you ought to understand that every devil has to bow to the name of Jesus Christ you ought to understand that you are not here to be tormented by Satan but you are here to torment Satan himself now the message ain't just something that you set back and press play and it comes alive the message ain't something something that's just easy believism of well I profess that God sent a prophet I accept it and move on absolutely not the me message of the hour is an experience with the message himself the message is a life the message is a power that's why David when he was back there when he was nothing but a 12y old boy Ruddy he was a cute little fell but he knew who he was and when D when Saul when Saul rejected the kingdom Samuel came and poured the anointing oil upon Little David what was it you're not a Christian by your own desire you're a Christian because of his desire you're in position because he put you in position and when David was standing there and the anointing oil was poured over David's life what was it William brandham said that David was positionally placed as the king of Israel right there and he said when you when you are placed positionally in Christ Jesus as Kings and Priests he said the moment you receive the Holy Spirit God places you in the Kingdom as an aor what am I saying I'm saying you ain't got to wait for this you ain't got to come to recognition you ain't got to you ain't got to come to some spot where you wait to be a Son of God you ain't got to come to a spot where you wonder if you're adopted or not you ain't got to sit back and let some doctor of divinity tell you you got the holy ghost or not but if you're a son act like a son come on somebody if you're a son live like a son if you're a son dress like a son if you're a son preach like a son if you're a son act like a son speak like a son dance like a son act like a son Hallelujah I know it's a paradox I know it's a paradox but there's somebody right here in this room right now that is fellowshipping with an angel there's somebody that's bumping into Angels there's somebody that's recognizing that he's talking about me they saw themselves in the mirror of his word they recognize who they are it's a paradox but you're fellowshipping with him by the understanding of the written word that there is a living true God and his bride is dressing herself right here by the spoken word and they're living out the message of the hour you got a little bit more time John said in John 5 and 20 and we know somebody say it with me and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we might know him that is true and that we are in him that is true that is true even in his son Jesus Christ This is is true this is the true God and eternal life notice when Paul comes to the Church of coloss I love chapter 2 probably one of my favorite favorite books of the Bible but when Paul begins to line out some things that Jesus was God incarnate that he was made manifest here on Earth in the flesh to give us what God was and then Paul begins to tell the believer that you are complete in him notice what he says in verse six and you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him notice in him rooted and built up in him and establish in the faith as ye have been taught abounding there in with Thanksgiving verse n for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the god hi Bally and you are complete in him and you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and Power power in him now notice when you study out that word complete it means fulfill it means to end it means to make full it means to fill up it means to F to the full to cause to abound to furnace or Supply liberally I abound I am liberally supplied to fill to the top so that nothing shall be wanting to fo measure feel to the brim you can't be full of the world and full of God at the same time come on somebody if anybody love the world and the things of the world the love of God is not even in him is that right so you can't be full of yourself and expect to be full of God so and you are complete you are full to the brim as a songwriter said it I'm so full that my saucer is full that my cup is running over and my saucer is full of it that is why the token message that William Brandon preaches is so important to believe to the believer because it's only the token is only applied at the evening time that the token is a life blood of the Lamb taking residence upon the believer's soul that it's more than just a baptism that justifies you that it's more than just a baptism baptism of the spirit that sanctifies you it's more than just a baptism of speaking in tongues and a gift of knowledge but the token hallelujah hallelujah the token is a sign and it is a proof that there is an indwelling power from on high the token is a sign that you are Rapture Ready the token is no longer a chemical but it's a literal life of Jesus Christ that's why William Bram when when William brandham is standing there in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said that's what the devil's howling about he said because it's being revealed I know I maybe I know I know you might think I'm crazy but I literally feel the house of hell right now I literally feel it I literally feel it because Satan recognizes he is losing position he is losing his portion he is losing Sons when they come to their recognition hell is Hing now I ain't doing like brother brandom talked about with some people sniffing out of devil but I literally feel the vibrations of Hell pulsating against the very idea that God could feel you so full of yourself the hell of hell are nervous right now there's a blood that has been poured out upon the Church of Jesus Christ the life of God I rebuke every devil in hell that tries to tell you that you made a mistake and you got a complex on your life and says you can't have the Holy Ghost I rebuke that foul Spirit you can have the Holy Ghost you can have the adoption Road you can be recognized as a [Applause] son what are you talking about brother Andrew I'm talking about devils are nervous because there is a body that is coming under the headship of the word of God they recognize that this intelligence of faith that she has that unlocks the door she didn't get this knowledge from some man idea she didn't get this let me let me say it like this you didn't get this by the preaching of the word well that's that's that's a little that's a little out there brother Andrew I'm saying the same thing that William brandham said about Luke chapter 24 he said when the O when the preaching of the word didn't even open their eyes because Jesus took them through Modern events made clear by prophecy and he preached to them from Genesis the revelation of who he was and the preached word didn't even open he said but when he came in brother Timothy he's in here but when he got on the inside brother Joel when he locked the door on the outside when he sealed you so full of the Holy Ghost what' he do what he do with Gus's daughter he had to kick all the unbelievers out before he could perform a miracle what' he do when they pulled on him when they literally pulled on him Adam said Don't Pass Me By don't leave me in my depression don't leave me in my situation I know there's something special about this message but don't leave me here where I am and when they ped on him with a third pole Ministry say come in here with us he did something that he did before it was the same one in the first and the second pole but then magnified the third it was the same one oh watch it when you fold on him you begin to recognize I am a son I know you may have looked at a water tower for some time but you're a son you may have forgot what you was supposed to be you may have been Shell Shocked by the world but there's a water tower in this place that you could come running back to brother Andrew ain't listening to the message there's a water tower in this place I ain't turned on a tape in in maybe 18 days and I I didn't got caught on God there's a water tower in this place I got called on God I felt like God gave up on me I felt like God disappointed me and I'm disappointed in God there's a water tower here recognize who you are recognize your position Hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah I Believe by the preaching of the word that the Holy Ghost will fall upon you but I believe that if it falls upon you it'll line you up with the word because while Peter yet spoke these words in Acts 10:44 the Holy Ghost fell on them but they didn't stay in that position they went to the water and got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ the word places you in scriptural position what is it I done grabbed a hold of something that won't let go of me come on somebody you know what I'm talking about you know what I'm talking about sticking rubber bands around your arm and waiting for the feeling to come running through your veins but I'm talking about something that thing will leave you that thing will leave you desperate that thing will leave you with a headache but I'm talking about something will never leave you it'll keep you it'll be with you it is a sustainer it is a protector it is a deliverer it is a way maker I done grabbed a hold of inoculation I've done grabbed a hold of the same inoculation that the mother Mary grabbed a hold of that when she got up there when she got up there and she got herself good and shut in when the rest of the world was making fun of them for being shut in she got up there what am I saying to you if she had to go up there and she had to get drunk on the Holy Ghost then you do too come on somebody if Peter had to go up there then so do you if Paul had to get the Holy Ghost then so do you come on somebody if William brandham had to get the Holy Ghost then so do you she grabbed a hold of inoculation that there was a bomb in Gilead when she come out of there they come out of there speaking and every man heard in their own language what was it God had given them another language that they didn't even understand on their own what was it it was an understanding from Heaven they didn't even know that language you didn't know this language when you was a Catholic you didn't know this language when you was an Apostolic you didn't know this language when you were the Methodist but you got an understanding this is your language and Nathan a was making fun of her when she come out there and she was shouting sister Gabrielle and she was dancing down through there people was making fun of her and criticizing her but William brandham said in in in the what is the attraction on the mountain he said it attracts the vultures but it attracts the Eagles as well and the vultures might have made fun of little Mary up there but she done got a hold of something that wasn't going to let her go what am I saying to you I'm saying there something got a hold of me where something got a hold of me I said something I got a hold of me well I went to a meeting one night and my heart it got right I said something it got a ho hold to me what happened they was criticizing Mary but Mary didn't care brother brandom said she done been branded and she was having herself a fit but she didn't care what the mockers was saying they said it reminded me about when I was out there on the troubles River out there in Colorado he said when we was throwing down them old calves he said them calves had been about a year old he said some of them was big and had a little th in them he said but we roped them and threw them down he said they didn't like it for a minute he said but we knew who they were afterwards
