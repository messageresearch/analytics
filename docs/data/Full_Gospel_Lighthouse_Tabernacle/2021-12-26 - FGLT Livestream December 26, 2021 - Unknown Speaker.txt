were sick we all would say that and uh and so we we're we're certainly praying for each and every one of them and i know it's quite a few today and we want to pray for them that god would touch them we we get a touch just just in this last week of of how deadly this disease is a young man that most of this church knew right here from 33 years old just seems like it just seems like it can just reach into your life and just and just take it and just snatch your life out and and so we want to remember we want to remember the morris family that that they lost a 33 year old son and of course he had three children and we want to pray for that family that god would just lift them up and minister to them in a very special way amen next week we will have our new year's meeting and on saturday

for your prayers for us and and uh it was there on the first uh we were actually hunting and uh we we were hunting we were not killing we were hunting and it's a it's a teaching of patience and so the lord just came and he gave us a very special visitation this week and a couple of things and uh and on the first day of the hunt the lord gave me the sermon for today and so i i was very pleased with that then he gave me a very supernatural vision and so we are we're we don't know exactly what all that means and don't feel quite ready to share those things with you but we're certainly thankful for that i would like to ask sister connie we're going to have a church dedication but sister connie wrote a post yesterday and i'd like for her to come and share that with me it's just just take about a minute to do that is that okay are you guys in a hurry or hey man christmas is yesterday and i know you're i know you're full i don't know if you got on the scale yesterday or not but mine said one at a time please and so amen so god bless you we love you with all of our hearts today is a very special day it's the dedication of brother justin and sister judy's twin babies and little maddox and miles is here to be dedicated today and we've got a big brother that's in the house as well and amen it's a it's a special day a few things that we can think about and i just wrote down just before coming to the service today was that one night during service the lord spoke to brother justin that god was going to bless him and his blessing so far was just like the tip of the iceberg and so today you're going to see some of these blessings that god has blessed him with he's blessed him with his with his egg business he now harvests incredible amount of eggs and too many for me to eat and so we're just so thankful for what god has blessed him doing that what was a dream and even a thought is now in fulfillment but one night brother justin was at work while we were having service here and the lord dealt with me to step out from behind the pulpit and to have the whole audience have prayer and i quoted psalms chapter 91 which is of course my favorite scripture and i asked the lord to have a special hedge about our police officers that evening and it would be that very evening within the hour that a man emptied his gun at only point-blank range just feet away and every one of those bullets was away from brother justin and god preserved his life even knocking some of the the police equipment off of the car and so god preserved him and he's watched over him and today we have two little fellas to be dedicated in the name of the lord jesus christ and sister judy was so sweet to send these things to me this morning maddox lynn the name of that is fortunate and blessed and we believe that amen miles ledger means merciful servant or a soldier a spear or a tribe may these two guys be soldiers of the lord and we know god is blessed the scripture says it like this in deuteronomy chapter 6 now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the lord your god commanded to teach you that you might do them and in the land whether you go to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command you and thou and thy son and thy son son and all the days of thy life that thy days may be prolonged here therefore o israel observed to do do it that it may be well with thee that that ye may increase mightily as the lord of of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hero israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which i command these this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou set us in thine house and then thy walketh by the way and when thy liest down and when thy riseth up and doubt shall bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be frontlets between between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the post of the house and of thy gates and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he swear unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac unto jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou build us not verse 12 then beware lest doubt forget the lord which brought thee forth from the land of egypt from the house of bondage that thou shalt fear thy lord thy god and shall serve him and swear by his name joshua chapter 1 and verse 9 have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage and be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether so ever thou goest amen may the entire family come now if you will and amen amen god bless you god bless you today amen these guys have got more hair than i do and they were born that way amen god bless you god bless you is this maddox miles maddox maybe you just step up here with me and there we go how you doing buddy i believe you're the happiest baby i've ever dedicated amen amen could we all pray almighty god lord this morning we will speak of when mary and joseph brought you to the temple and simeon would begin to cry out and later anna i thought of these things this morning and here is these two wonderful babies that you have blessed brother justin and sister judy with god you're the giver of life i ask you today that you would come now we dedicate these two babies to you father lord may you watch over them where they go watch over them what they do may the angel of god be standing in protection to take care of these babies lord may even others be aware that there's a special presence around them father lord you have given them to brother justin and sister judy and now we give them back to you father lord i ask you to raise them up and may they be real servants of god be with them in their play be with them lord jesus in their schoolings as it will come and father in this very evil day i ask you that you would protect them yes lord their names are powerful now lord jesus made their presence be powerful father i pray that you would bless this home like never before today and guide them and direct them dear god bless brother justin and sister judy to be greater parents lord anoint them with the holy ghost like never before may the home even angelic beings be present there to watch over them dear god more than a picture on the wall but may the presence of god be there to protect them dear god today and we thank you for it in jesus christ's name amen and a man amen amen it's picture time buddy hallelujah amen hallelujah god bless you thank you god bless you buddy i love you love you with all my heart amen yeah he did that's right congratulations to you guys yes absolutely amen how are you doing just make yourself at home he's pretty good at that hey man sister all right i just wanted to give a quick testimony could y'all put up mark 11 24 so anyway um we was thinking the secret to all that he liked me it was no secret that we had been desiring baby for several years anyway um i worked in ob so you know all these druggies coming in and having babies and i'm like god how can they continue like having being blessed and here i am desiring a baby and then um and then right um one day i was talking when the doctors were just so frustrated it was a girl i think was our fifth baby she'd be in jail she'd get pregnant and we'd be taking care of her because you know we could give her she'd say she was in labor and we could give her ginger ellen sandwiches when she come to us and take care of her so i would just always try to share show christ to her just through my actions but it was it was something i really had to work through anyway i walked in and i looked at one of the doctors and i was like how does this keep happening she looked at me and she said judy the most unfair world you're ever working is ob and i just was like i know anyway about a month or two later i come to find out my sister-in-law and my cousin we had all got married around the same time they had been um they had just gotten pregnant we had all you know we're all praying for babies and i just i just it was kind of the night that i really lost it and i left poor justin i left and i went down to um the park and i was just crying and anyway god gave me a scripture and it was mark 11 24. well the next saturday at church andrew opens service and that's the first scripture that he um or one of the first scriptures that he said and i just put in my heart and like okay god and a month later um it ended up being april 1st which was easter and i found out i was pregnant and justin didn't think i was telling the truth he actually would test he's like if you're lying to me like we're going to get a divorce i was like i was like i would never lie to you about something like that anyway needless to say this little guy was born um december the 1st so that was really special that was the first day of advent and he was our firstborn son and then the twins are actually when i was pregnant with silas um four people dreamed that i had twins so when i went in for my first ultrasound i was like research just one they're like that's just one well then when we found out on yesterday i think i was expecting a year ago yesterday i think i was expecting um bait the a baby which i didn't roswell's twins at that point so christmas day so easter with him christmas with them and um i so when we went and then they were due september the second so in my i just tucked that again right in my heart i'm like okay god maybe this means two babies i don't know anyway sure enough we go in and justin was convinced i wasn't so sure but when we went in and they said well there's one and number two so anyway just wanted to um thank god for all the blessings he's given us and what he's done our lives and yeah they're just we hope then pray that they will love and serve the lord with all their hearts and yeah we want to give them back to them so just want to share that little nugget of hopefully faith and for other people that are praying and desiring for their babies they're coming [Applause] i want you to read that if you will yeah he could have read this just as good as i can he's better at this than me but um as i posted yesterday on my instagram and uh is what he's referring to but i will read it to you all the ones that don't have instagram and um but a little testimony of what god has done for us i said merry christmas to all our precious friends and family we have so much to be thankful for yesterday marked two years that we heard the news that ron had something going on i will never forget that day we were planning to spend the night with charlie which is ron's dad for christmas but we had to rush back home for a ct scan not knowing what was what we were facing it's been some very dark days that no one but ron myself and our kids and sometimes our kids did not even know because he has put up a front so no one could see he makes me proud to be his wife and partner what god has joined together let no one put asunder not even cancer as you spend this time together with your family and friends remember to love and forgive big because you never know what the next minute hour day or week may hold remember jesus is the true reason for the season he is our waymaker hold on a minute i lost it remember jesus is the reason for the season he is our waymaker miracle worker promise keeper light in the darkness my god that is who he is [Applause] hey man she shared with me me with that this morning and i i thought well i just kind of immediately thought i'm gonna let you share that with the world and we'd like to thank the lord that god has given us two years at first dr buckwalter sister dolores work with dr buck walter very special man and when we went in to be examined dr buckwalter looked at me and after examination and without any scans he just said ron i'm i'm getting ready to send you down a very dark road i would later my last visit with dr buck walter because he's retired now he's actually in new zealand and so i asked him i said how did you know it was cancer he said you're a preacher and he said you can pick up on things and i said that's right he said i'm a doctor and he said i can feel that cancer and he said i knew you had cancer and so we would think it would be prostate cancer at that point little did we know it was lung cancer and it would be found in the in the in the lymph nodes and then it would go to the brain just only just a few days later and for those that don't know may have had your head in the sand just a bit but they gave us four months to live and uh we are now two years and so we're very thankful we're thankful when i'm so thankful that i we kind of found it was kind of a weird thing my my dog which is which is more than just a dog it was her it was one of our family and her name was belle bell was an australian shepherd and the other day just a few weeks ago they told me that bell had cancer and i was devastated i you know it's one thing for me to have it but my dog have it and so and so i gave them a good sum of money and we we started our journey and here we are three weeks later and and she went to be with she went to be with some of my loved ones and on christmas eve and so and so you know what that means there'll be another dog somewhere in our future amen if a president can have a dog why can't i have a dog and so amen amen brother branham would refer to his dog fritz and and many things amen maybe let's stand to our feet and this morning i'm sorry for taking so much time to get it started and and i'll try not to hold you too long amen god bless you and so love you with all of our hearts brother david mayer sent me a note this morning and contacted me this morning at 3 00 a.m and i was actually awake praying about a situation and brother jean-jacques michelo and his wife marinette mitchell lowe and some of the others have have covered and sister marinette this morning they have placed her on a on a ventilator and actually have turned her on her face and and so uh they wanted us to have prayer for her and the many others and we want to pray for all of those that are affected here as well and uh it's a real thing it's not it's not a political joke or uh politics has made a lot of things out of it for and against and all those different kind of things that's just the devil and so whether it's man-made or where it's not or whether it's conspiracy it's a devil and so and but we know a god that's greater we know a god that is greater than than all of that and so i'd like for us to remember sister marinette i've sat at the table with them many many times throughout the years and and she's just a precious woman and uh we want to remember her in prayer and uh it's caused much stress on the family with brother david and sister and we want to pray that god would just do a supernatural work and amen maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to say brother ron would you remember me in prayer amen now could we all pray together heavenly father we bow our heads to you now lord you see sister marinette in the hospital there on a ventilator lord i ask you that you would just send your word and heal her father lord you're the healer you're the you're the you're the one that's paid the complete price you did that 2000 years ago and father i asked you today that you would bring strength back to her body satan's trying to take her life but i ask you today that you would just come and drive that enemy back now in the name of jesus christ every hand that has been lifted across this audience and the people that will hear father i ask you that you'd send your word and heal them now we pray that you would touch them

today in your name we pray amen and amen and amen amen god bless you this this day amen we love you with all of our hearts and amen if you will turn with me in your scriptures today i'd like to look at luke chapter 2 and verse 43. for a christmas message you might think this might be an odd spot to start i want to share with you a quotation and i believe it was andrew that actually sent me this quotation yesterday it comes from charles spurgeon those little feet in the manger shall tread upon the serpent's neck and crush his head those little feet in the manger shall tread upon the serpent's neck and crush his head if satan but only knew what was coming luke chapter 2 and verse 43. and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company when a day's journey and they sought him among their kinfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of doctors both hearing them and answering them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing. and he said unto them how is it that thou sought me wish you not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the say in which he spake unto them and he went down with them and and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but notice these words but his mother kept all these saiyans in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and statue and in favor with god and man you may be seated this morning brother branham would talk about this layout i see an age and he would remind them that you have went off without jesus you built your organizations and you left jesus and you come back wondering mary and joseph have have came to the ceremonies they came to the great tradition but they left jesus and now tarried they went a journey a day's journey and now they begin to seek him amongst their kin folks and they go back and they find jesus in a temple and he's at work now it's a pretty powerful thing you can go to different places to read some of the things that jesus talked about jesus confounds the doctors he confounds the astronomers he confounds those theologians of that day and literally literally in one place they wanted to worship him at that point so jesus confounds the greatest minds in the world that is sitting there also for the tradition and they have gathered there as elders these were elders of elders these were the greatest men sitting there and they did not recognize who he was they did not recognize that the author and the finisher of our faith was setting as emmanuel as a twelve-year-old boy mary and joseph shows up and and when they show up they begin to talk to him and they begin to tell him now remember they're human and they have their human emotions but she does something in these statements that denies the virgin birth and she said your father and i have been looking for you but the word always corrects the error amen and jesus reminds her that i must be about my father's business the scripture very plainly tells us that after they go back to nazareth that mary very much thought deeply on these things that jesus reminds her of because there had been rumors for 12 years where this child came from they had had to move away from bethlehem into egypt to secure the baby's safety they had rumored that this child had came from roman a roman soldier but mary had maintained the testimony that i met an angel of god gabriel came and ministered to me he called me by my name and told me the commission that god was going to come to the earth he'll be emmanuel he will fulfill the scriptures of the old testament he'll fulfill the words of isaiah behold a virgin shall conceive and in that day she would be quickened to know that i'm that girl i'm that one you're no different today god's going to have a bride that'll come out of laodicea it has been quickened to you come on church it has been quickened to you and you hold the testimony true you hold it true you met the word of the lord you met the angel of god to you you had an experience you had an experience that anchored your heart this isn't the first time that god's going to shake the world with a baby we must remind ourselves of amram and joseph behold god melchizedek had sat with abraham spoke lip to ear that he was going to give him a son but he reminded him that their children would sojourn in a land for 400 years but god would send them a deliver they they went to egypt because of circumstances drove them there and they went there and after about 400 years it was the time or the season the season of fulfillment of the word of the hour amram was praying before god you can hear brother branham preaching it in the teaching on moses and he describes it that how amram would go up after a long day of work of slavery and he would go up in the attic and pray and he said an angel met him i believed that an angel met him that they were going to have a child that they would have to protect that child the baby was born and they would place that baby they would place that baby in a basket now now let me just say this to you even pharaoh knew about the prophecy about this time there's a deliverer going to come so they were very much aware to try to destroy the plan of god let me just just share this with you now there's nothing that satan can do [Music] that can destroy god's plans there will be a people that will be rapture ready there will be a bride universally around the world that will be ready for the coming of the lord there will be a resurrection there will be a rapture of the church and we will go to see our lord jesus christ in a corporal body brethren said that's what believers believe and i want to say it with all the authority in my voice listen there's nothing satan can do to stop it pharaoh was no doubt trying to do whatever he could to block this deliverer from coming now no doubt he would have been very much and raised all of his armor against a man a general a great leader coming in but god would show what i'm going to do in a couple thousand years and he sent him a deliverer as a baby and then not only a deliverer he would protect that baby brother adam would use the term he said he said when joseph placed her her babe that baby in that bull rush and sent him down that crocodile and infested the river our prophet could tell us he said god commissioned gabriel to come and stand on that ark [Music] sometimes you say well that was such a cruel that was such a cruel thing that god would ask her to go down you're only looking at one side of the story the natural side god would send that baby with the great angel gabriel standing there and he said commission ten thousand angels should stand at that that and he said make sure that if a crocodile comes near him put that foot down on him if he gets in a whirlpool see that he gets out [Applause] if he did that for baby moses how much will he do that for you as a son and daughter of god what an incredible god that would send a deliverer as a baby and the daughter of pharaoh would pick up that baby and name him god would have that mother to name the baby received him out of water and call his name moses what a god what an incredible god strongest military in the world the brightest architecture in the world the highest minds in the entire world and they're going to raise their arch enemy [Music] in their own household and god's going to allow him to raise and literally be offered the throne just like jesus himself is going to be offered everything in the world and turn it down moses is going to be offered a throne and turn it down you may be offered a lot of things in your life but the seed on the inside of you will call you to a higher realm this world is not our home every prophet would be the voice of god and they would speak of this one to come they would speak of this one that would come from bethlehem they would speak of a deliverer they would speak of a messiah every prophet would point his way he'd have a spot of god on the inside of him and you would see moses and you would see god you'd see isaac you'd see abraham and you would see god but all of them were only an attribute form of a coming one and now no doubt a lot of women on the earth thought that they might have that child and then it would come past the time of emergency and they would marry maybe even the priest many women would be held back because of this prophecy but they were not the chosen one but here's a girl that is not in the who's who here's one of the poorest girls that there is but she is the predestinated seed of god the only woman ordained to ever carry the word itself and she would be that one that the angel would speak that incredible salutation and she would say be it unto me now it's just like an experience that you have it's really hard to explain that to somebody else it really is they weren't there they believe you but they don't get the emotion of it and she goes to elizabeth and she tells elizabeth what's happened now elizabeth is is pregnant but the baby's dead but she tells her of this supernatural salutation and now when she calls his name jesus which is the most triumphant name this power that's above every power more than just the letters of j-e-s-u-s but this boy is god in a human body are you with me now and literally by the name when when his name is called across her lips for the first time it creates life in a in a woman's womb that is it's dead that baby's dead but now that forerunner has got to come to life we just celebrated christmas never let it become a tradition never let it be about santa claus and all the paganism but always keep it about the lord jesus himself if you'll remember if you remember on their way to bethlehem there were stars that were gathering brother rams said that joseph would look back and see a shine on mary's face a smile on her face like he had never seen ever before and she said what's what's making you what's making you so happy what's making you smile so greatly she said i've been watching us a star follow us now she wouldn't be the only one that's watching that there's some shepherds there's magis that are watching that star because they know that that star's telling them that there's a king whatever god's doing in the heavens he's doing it on the earth brother brown would remind us the celestial heaven is declaring to us that an infant broad is being born on the earth in 1962 we're not an infant no more we stand in maturity tonight as sons and daughters of jesus christ let this world fall apart let it fall apart don't get yourself so anxious about everything that's going on on cnn or fox news it's supposed to be that way there's a bride that is built for this day she will overcome she will overcome she will live through this day [Applause] hallelujah there's nobody that's like your testimony like yours when they take the baby to the temple here comes simeon and of all of the people of the thousands of people that have come here comes a man that begins to declare i have lived all my life for this day a lot of babies are going to the temple to be for to be circumcised a lot of babies are in front of them but this man identifies this baby as the messiah and he begins to lift his voice and no doubt caused that incredible reaction in the temple a blind woman who has lived in the temple for years she's just like the furniture there but she comes as a second witness that this is the baby that they have been looking for mary begins to ponder all of these things in her heart as a human mama she's met the angel she's been there in all the events now she's watching god testify of his own gift god himself jehovah had wrapped himself as a baby in a manger listen folks this is more than just some religious story this is a story of redemption god became man that man might become god are you with me now he left the ivory palaces of heaven he came to this earth and no doubt satan had watched for him as well as kings had watched for him to come this messiah was going to pay the redemption of all since adam that had failed all the sadness in the earth all the death all the calamity that can be placed back on man's fall from the garden of eden we needed a messiah we needed a leader we needed a god that could come amongst us tell me folks you needed the same god you were dead in your sins and in trespasses you tabernacle another realm of darkness you was a servant to sin but there was something on the inside of you that was calling deeper than any deep that you could have schools didn't take care of it alcohol didn't take care of it jobs didn't take care of that hunger but this jesus if he could only be born in your life but let me just say now i come to the part of the message as i said in a tree stand and god begin to deal with my heart mary was human i don't know about you but you're human if you don't know what your wife will tell you may have survived cancer but i may not survive after today but i understand this even though jesus born inside of her and she holding him it boggles my mind as she as a woman mothered him and took care of him and his little falls and he scratches and his tears his fears as a man a boy a baby his feelings as a little child not understanding everything he grew in wisdom he grew in wisdom as a little child he didn't understand everything he was different than his siblings his atmosphere was different than theirs i don't want to get too deep in that but his atmosphere was different than theirs remember as a supreme sacrifice he could never think a wrong thought not just speak a wrong thought but never think a wrong thought because remember if he is a supreme sacrifice as a man he has an accuser and the accuser and the accuser will never be able to look at him and see error i don't know when the day was and i don't even conjecture to think that way but somewhere mary had to have a conversation with jesus now i'd like i'd like to talk to you here's what i'd like to talk to you as a body of believers somewhere she had to tell him joseph's not your father maybe it's after the 12 year old i must be about my father's business mary had to repent so it takes away from any worship of mary because mary had to repent because remember she had believed the word and the word had been formed in her and now here's 12 years later she denies the testimony of the supernatural birth and listen so many times we wonder about brother branham and some of the supernatural events that took place whether it's a bridge or whether it's sword coming in his hand or seven angels came down to visit and and we wonder well brother brown just told us those things and we just believe him now you're quiet but more than that we believe 2 000 years ago a girl all of our christianity around the world is hinged on one girl it's hinged on one girl's testimony that i met an angel of god and then she goes to joseph and tells him that testimony and joseph has to have a visitation and then elizabeth has a visitation are you with me now are you with me now i find it interesting that mary has to repent for that error so you can call to mary all you want to she's your sister she's not god and i don't know quite how that she dealt how that she dealt with him but somewhere another she had to begin to tell him testimonies one after another i met an angel i met an angel and that angel and maybe describe what he looked like and he began to tell me the salutation and that salutation lined up with the scriptures of isaiah jesus it was like this we went to church on sunday and the rabbi read the scripture and something quickened in my heart and i just couldn't get away from it and we went home and joseph and i read the scripture again and we just couldn't get away from it just something quickened in our heart made it alive like never before and it was the next day i was going to get water and i came by a narrow passageway and there stood an angel oh there was people passing me by but they never recognized the angel and the angel spoke to me i've never been with the man but the angel spoke to me and and now i i am with child and it's of the holy ghost jesus you came from god and you're going back to god i don't know how to say this to you but i can only take it at his words your god i know that's something for you to ponder i've been pondering it all week and i bring it through every message you're talking about running it through a message i ran it through every sermon this baby was destined to destroy the works of the devil [Applause] this baby how it must shake hell today ain't no wonder they want to make paganism out of it and no wonder they want to do away with the deity of who jesus christ really was because this baby that was born into the earth what's the baby that was destined to destroy satan's kingdom hallelujah [Applause] and no wonder they try to hide it ain't no wonder to try to gloss it over with some santa claus ain't no wonder they try to make a lie out of it and try to destroy children's minds because this baby born would shake heaven and hell would pay the price of redemption he would do more than turn water to wine or feed 5000 with a couple loaves of bread and a few fish do more than take a leopard by the hand he would forgive sins no other prophet ever was able to do [Music] the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head it was prophecy so what does satan do try to make a god out of her tries to make a god out of her call on mary hail mary's but she had to go to the upper room just like you and i she had to receive that jesus that was once in her womb she'd be the only one to have him inside of her twice she'd be the only one to carry him the second time sure she felt the agony of carrying the child and she would watch him there's nobody at greater pain when jesus is taking those strikes there's nobody in greater pain than when they're crying for him to be crucified nobody's feeling the agony any more than she was because she was the closest connection what about our close connection tonight is it worth fighting for is it worth protecting the promise is it worth holding the testimony so sacred brother emmanuel it would be so designed he is a 17 year old boy is making a trip to jeffersonville to listen to this word in person with brother branham we went to brother john paul's and i was able to hear that again and he would share that to me what it meant to him the incredible trip that it was for a young man at that age god dropped something in his heart this is true how many thousand churches did they pass on the way to 8th and penn street but god had dropped a revelation in his heart as a young man that this is the message of the hour billy andrews when it dropped in his heart when he saw brother brandon preach his first sermon it don't take a hundred don't take a thousand sermons you don't have to be convinced by the president or any of those guys you and god have an experience like mary said be it unto me and something drops in your heart and it's anchored forever your life has changed forever once that anchors in your heart i heard you pray i heard you pray i heard you stepping another round i heard you stepping around the reason that you have that access is because you met him are you with me a preacher that is worth his goods he can only preach because he met him on the backside of a desert i'm afraid we've got too many men in pulpits that have never really truly met him and it's just a story it's just somebody historical situation but we need the holy ghost in our life like never before brother brandon said if you pray long enough you'll receive the gift of the holy ghost and you speak in tongues don't you go off the limb right there just for a moment say oh brother on you that's the only initial evidence but i believe you can step into a realm to where that you can receive the holy ghost now let me just say this to you if you can go back you ain't got it if you can turn away and go back you never had it in the first place that's the reason people can come and deny the message and walk away and say everything that they they really never had it to start off with [Applause] i don't care how you dressed i don't care what kind of ties you paid i don't care what your name was if you can walk away from this message and while there's still time you better get it don't get mad at me right there i'm just your messenger i'm kind of like the mailman i do not get mad at the mailman jason because he gives me electric bills i when eli comes and drops the mail inside of my my box i don't get mad at him because he gives me insurance bills he's only the carrier going to preach to you don't get mad at the carrier that has been anointed with the same oil that was inside of the messenger of this day are you with me people get mad at me they really don't know me they really don't know me i led a man to a lord this week he's never heard me preach once not one sermon but let him into the lord this week he was different moments after we prayed and he told me the next day i'm a different man and he was i went on a hunting trip it turned out to be a fishing trip i was looking for a trophy and i got one did you see you hear what they said about brother branham yeah did you hear what they said about jesus have you heard have you heard what they said about jesus you know the same critic that'll be to jesus that'll be to brother branham now i'm bringing it to you it's going to be your critic it's going to be your critic the same spirit that denied jesus christ deny brother branham and will deny you you can feel you can feel rejection i want to i is this okay just for a few more moments can you imagine what mary felt she was always sister carol that woman what an honor what an honor i say this what an honor to be that woman nobody worshipped her while she was on the earth it was 300 years later that they wanted to worship her given time somebody will recognize brother branham as a great man but we ain't got 300 years are you with me now so stop paying attention to your critic are you hearing me i got this in a tree stand your credit don't matter as a matter of fact i said it last week their only their testimony against you is actually saying what a masterpiece you are hallelujah [Applause] brother branham said that jesus would look at the word and believe what it said about him and he would listen to mary mary was not the word but she was transferring words from an angel and taking the words of isaiah and telling jesus i'll tell you you are the i am brother on your way out on the land i don't think so because i want to come to you i'm not mary but i was sent from god to tell you and have a conversation with you you're not of this world are you getting it and you sit there sometimes then you go really this world's not your home and you're not comfortable here and i'll tell you why i'll tell you honey i'll tell you why you're not comfortable here you're not from here you came through the bedding grounds of your mother and your father and you're going to feel the humanity scars but you're not from here and marry as much as she could do if she told this story to other people they wouldn't believe but he believed and somewhere another i may preach to thousands and thousands of people but somewhere another there's going to be some people that go i believe i believe that it'll it'll be worth whatever kind of sisters whatever kind of attire that you you got to lay off well brother ron i have to quit i have to quit doing things to my fingers and i have to i have to wear my dress a certain way i have to wear my hair a certain way and i have to do a certain thing i have to have a certain certain character remember i ain't the one that made the rules up but papa god told me somebody's going to believe it man you got to have a certain character you got to you got to be like men you can't be a bunch of wishy-washy backboned not know what kind of a gender that you are and be real man be real men i'll tell you there's going to be some people that believe the story [Applause] this world is not my home i'm just a passing through and being found in a fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of a cross in matthew chapter 28 the great commission i've had this in my notes for for a while let me drop this in my heart monday and this morning i got up and my devotional page started right here i said god you're right on time every time go you therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and a holy ghost isaiah 9 and 6 said for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace all of those are titles but his name shall be called all of these encapsulated in the name of jesus is wonderful counselor mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace every bit of that is in the name of jesus so those baby feet in that manger would tran upon the serpent's head and crush him [Music] when you say jesus he is wonderful when you say jesus he is the counselor when you say jesus he is the mighty god when you say jesus he is the everlasting father jesus is him he is the prince of peace when you say matthew 28 and 19 do you therefore and teach all nations baptizing in the name of the father father is not a name no more than wonderful counsel or prince of peace mighty god or everlasting father there's no salvation in the name father or son or holy ghost you must know who the holy ghost is you know i must know who the spirit of christ is that spirit of of jesus when these are written that you might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing you may have life through his name glory [Applause] some people get mad in this political world that you say merry christmas well that's not a new movement spurgeon actually had to deal with it because there was a movement then to make it happy holidays and he said to deny that this christmas day is to be merry is to deny the savior has come to the earth and he said our life are to be filled with joy that even the saiyan of merry christmas ought to bring to us that the savior of all humanity has been born in bethlehem this day no not december the 25th but thank god he came to earth thank god he didn't leave us lost thank god he didn't leave us without peace in our life if we were just a bunch of religious entities we'd be constantly falling back over and over and over again without jesus living on the inside of your life i'm talking about the holy ghost that seal of the holy ghost living on the inside of you god's not trusting your humanity he's trusting that seed of god that has come quick into life maybe your birth happened in 1984 or 2011. it doesn't matter as long as he's born in your manger and maybe nobody will believe your story like they did hers but it's true it's true and you know what you don't even have to fight about it because you know it's true in that powerful sister connie you don't have to argue about this you don't fuss about it you met an angel and when you couldn't control yourself he came and lived on the inside of you and just one day you was one way and the next day is another way and it wasn't you what holds you here stephen you don't jesus does chris you're sitting beside him you look good too this morning what holds you here the world's calling you to be a part of every kind of scene in the world what's holding you i'll tell you what's holding you that which anchored in your heart a long time ago that nobody else understands but you on a certain day in a certain time under a certain atmosphere something came to life and it was more than your daddy's thoughts or your mother's thoughts but something anchored you that you could stand when ten thousand devils tried to turn you a different way you could stand but it's not true brother ron to you it is to you it is great to you it is to you it is april forgive me for not putting brother sister in brother randall to you it is it's true johnny you're you told me how old you are back there i can't believe that yet but somewhere another 60 years ago you started preaching this word became alive now you've grown a lot of things you've seen you've turned well i see it different now that's the reason that the scripture says be zealous therefore and repent because you repent of things you you saw you thought was wrong or it's all wrong and then you go thank god he
