[18:26] the Lord this morning I'm going ask
[18:28] brother Gabriel Spencer if he would just
[18:30] come lead us to the throne of grace this
[18:34] [Music]
[18:39] morning it's good to be here this
[18:41] morning a it I was able to talk to
[18:43] brother philli this morning and uh
[18:45] they're actually planning on discharging
[18:46] him either discharge now or here in a
[18:49] couple hours and um you know what he had
[18:52] was a what they would call the widows
[18:54] maker and God gave him purpose to live
[18:57] even even longer and I just happen to
[19:00] believe for him that God's going to
[19:02] allow him to see his son come back if
[19:05] you know anything about his story and
[19:07] may be bold of me to say that but I can
[19:09] say that because a couple years ago I I
[19:12] had prayed that I'd see my brother and
[19:15] his wife come back and I didn't know
[19:17] this until I just was walking in and in
[19:20] that testimony when I said that I said
[19:22] y'all will be able to believe what
[19:24] brother Ron came and told me when he
[19:26] stepped out right where you were sitting
[19:27] at and I was sitting there and he told
[19:30] me that Michael and Alexa are coming
[19:34] well they're here today so that can just
[19:36] be a confirmation maybe there's a lost
[19:39] loved one that you have believe we in
[19:41] for a special service this morning let's
[19:43] just take these needs to the
[19:46] Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord you
[19:49] you know how to just orchestrate things
[19:51] so perfectly and be able to bring things
[19:53] together just so perfectly and Lord
[19:56] Jesus there's many needs in this
[19:57] building today Lord that many sick
[20:00] amongst us and Lord I just thank the the
[20:03] the physical needs that we have in our
[20:04] body you allow us to go through those
[20:06] things because if we if we were not sick
[20:09] if we wouldn't have conditions as our
[20:11] pastor has in cancer we wouldn't be able
[20:13] to see you as a Healer Lord Jesus we
[20:16] wouldn't be able to see you as a savior
[20:17] if we weren't born in sin and Lord Jesus
[20:20] I think about all the prodigals that
[20:21] you're bringing back home and all the
[20:23] conditions that all the conditions that
[20:25] are going on in this world that can drag
[20:27] us so far out that we there's no it
[20:29] looks impossible for us to come back it
[20:32] looks impossible for for anything to
[20:34] happen there's not one thing that we as
[20:36] men could say to our brother our sister
[20:38] or son or daughter but all we do is we
[20:40] just put our loved ones into the hands
[20:42] of you because it's in your time that
[20:44] these things will happen and they're
[20:46] they will turn around and they may not
[20:48] even understand how or understand why
[20:50] they're coming back to church but Lord
[20:52] Jesus it's because you're wrapping it
[20:53] all up your seeds are coming back into
[20:56] one Lord and I just ask that you would
[20:58] just sweep across this building this
[20:59] morning that this could just be a this
[21:01] could just be an everlasting Everlasting
[21:04] service that we will be able to look
[21:05] back unto in eternity and be able to say
[21:07] look at look at the loved ones that
[21:09] we've had that that we wrote down today
[21:11] that will be coming home and it's in our
[21:13] it's we have the power in our tongue to
[21:16] be able to claim and be speaking those
[21:18] things and Lord Jesus you've given us
[21:20] the authority to speak speak love you've
[21:22] given us the authority to speak speak
[21:24] healing over top of every situation and
[21:27] Lord Jesus I just ask that you would
[21:28] just come down in a mighty powerful way
[21:30] this morning you would be able to come
[21:32] down and you would allow us to draw
[21:33] closer we know that there's things in
[21:35] our own life that you're continuously
[21:37] working on we're not perfect but you

[21:43] come down in a mighty way and refill us
[21:45] with the Holy Ghost like never before
[21:47] and as each and every one of us are in
[21:49] this building this morning I ask that
[21:51] you will just be able to give us a
[21:52] special touch a confirmation to know
[21:54] that you are with us and you will draw
[21:56] us into eternity all the problems that
[21:58] we Face we don't need to worry about

[53:28] that in
[53:32] 2017 what did we you were going through
[53:34] a prayer line can you share that with us
[53:38] well U about a week before the uh
[53:41] brother Ron came to our church we go to
[53:42] Brother Joseph Hamed's Church in
[53:44] Murphysboro
[53:46] Tennessee and our pastor Brother Joseph
[53:48] had handed out checks and brother Ron
[53:51] said you know y'all did that here one
[53:52] time with you know Jesus Christ from the
[53:54] bank Bank of heaven and you know you
[53:56] fill out the check and uh my wife had
[54:00] filled out the check for the Salvation
[54:01] of our children and
[54:04] U the next week brother Ron came and we
[54:08] was standing in the prayer line and and
[54:10] I went and before my wife and uh brother
[54:13] Ron you know prayed with me which me and
[54:15] him have been buddies for a while and we
[54:16] just was happy to see each other and so
[54:19] my wife came uh right after me and she
[54:25] mention she spoke to our pastor Brother
[54:27] Joseph and said that uh she said you
[54:29] remember those checks you give us you
[54:31] know I wrote on that check for the
[54:32] Salvation of my children and you know
[54:35] they were lost in sin and you know and
[54:39] uh so she'd mentioned that to him and
[54:40] then our pastor had leaned over and said
[54:42] something to brother Ron I don't know
[54:43] for sure what but and brother Ron you
[54:47] know uh when he kept my wife come
[54:49] forward he uh he said to my wife he said
[54:52] you know didn't God bring your husband
[54:54] back because cuz back in 2010 you know
[54:58] God had brought me back that's another
[55:00] long story but you know I was deep in
[55:03] sin and and she and I was about to get a
[55:06] divorce and you know because I was just
[55:09] a monster but you know God had a way of
[55:13] getting a hold of me you know it took a
[55:15] little time in prison and Federal
[55:17] Marshals but he got a hold of me but uh
[55:20] I uh but whenever uh he said to my wife
[55:26] he said didn't God you know bring your
[55:28] husband back didn't he put you back
[55:29] together you know he said there's you
[55:31] know nothing too hard for the Lord and
[55:33] then he he stepped back and he looked at
[55:35] her and he said uh you know I give you
[55:38] your children in the name of Jesus
[55:40] Christ and then he shook his head he
[55:42] stepped back and he said I didn't say
[55:44] that he
[55:45] did and so my wife had held on to that
[55:48] since
[55:49] 2017 and she told everybody that you
[55:52] know anything anytime somebody was
[55:53] mentioning about our kids she said well
[55:55] there coming brother Ron told
[55:57] me
[56:06] and

[56:14] said he s brother Reed to tell that
[56:16] story I'm sorry

[56:29] this to
[56:32] us stupid
[56:35] devil man I'm not good at this kind of
[56:37] stuff but like he said we we like to
[56:40] weight lift so uh one Friday morning I
[56:42] got up and I just thought it was going
[56:43] to be another big day in the gym you
[56:46] know and uh little did I know it was
[56:49] going to be something completely
[56:50] different and uh got out of the gym
[56:53] still had a feeling that something was
[56:55] going to happen and I called one of my
[56:56] buddies he didn't answer we usually go
[56:58] eat breakfast on Fridays Saturdays and
[57:01] uh so normal breakf breakfast spot I
[57:05] drove by and it was uh it was really
[57:06] packed so I said I'm just going to go to
[57:08] Waffle House and so I walked into Waffle
[57:10] House and U going to sit down at the bar
[57:13] because the place is full and uh there's
[57:16] a older gentleman walked in behind me
[57:19] and there was two seats in between me
[57:21] and he sits at one on one of the empty
[57:23] seats on the other side and behind him
[57:26] comes another another couple like I said
[57:28] the place was full so he looks at me and
[57:30] says uh would you scoot down so so they
[57:34] could sit down and um I was like man
[57:37] this old man isn't going to tell me what
[57:39] to do you know I just came out of the
[57:41] gym and uh I look back cuz I'm still I
[57:44] still got a little nice bone in me but I
[57:46] look back asked him if they needed to
[57:47] sit down and and they said no there's a
[57:50] booth about to come open so I just went
[57:52] back to drinking my coffee and kind of
[57:55] gave this older man the cold
[57:58] shoulder and uh he still tries to talk
[58:01] to me like I said I give him the cold
[58:02] shoulder then he starts talking about
[58:03] Fords which we're Ford people over here
[58:06] yeah but um that's how you get to heaven
[58:08] he said he drove
[58:11] us he said he drove a 73 Ford so I was
[58:14] like man I used to drive one of those
[58:15] and you know he just started talking
[58:17] about that and then uh another thing was
[58:19] he got his food before me so I was like
[58:21] oh man come on you know I walk in before
[58:22] him order and he gets his food before me
[58:24] too
[58:25] so but uh anyway he he looks at me and
[58:29] he says uh you know it's not a
[58:31] coincidence that you're you're here
[58:32] today or I'm here and U CU God knows it
[58:36] all you know he said it's not a
[58:38] coincidence you're here today and U he
[58:42] says do you know where you're going to
[58:43] go today if you die and I was like oh
[58:46] man I hear I've heard this so many times
[58:49] and so I just kind of look away and
[58:51] start eating and say uh you know that's
[58:54] kind of a complex question just continue
[58:56] to eat and then just something comes
[58:58] over me and I just start crying and I
[59:01] say you know man uh it's not a complex
[59:04] question I know where I'm going to go
[59:05] today and it's not going to be a very
[59:06] good place if I died right
[59:08] now and
[59:10] uh and he says I continue eating then he
[59:13] says brother you know that uh you only
[59:16] get so many chances of God knocking on
[59:18] your door and I've been in and out of
[59:21] church and I'll be honest with you that
[59:22] that was the third time that uh the good
[59:24] Lord has dealt with me and uh pretty
[59:27] sure three is a good number isn't it
[59:29] yeah that's right and uh he says
[59:34] uh he says you got this is your chance
[59:38] today he says you're going to make one
[59:39] of the biggest and most important
[59:40] decisions of your
[59:41] life and I don't say anything you know
[59:44] he gets up to walk out and I asked him
[59:46] his name or no he asked me my name and I
[59:49] tell him you know Reed ball and and then
[59:51] before he walks out say uh you know sir
[59:53] what's your name and and he looks at me
[59:55] and says you'll remember me by Rich in
[59:57] Christ is what he said his name was and
[1:00:01] he walks out the door turns around looks
[1:00:03] at me one more time and says I'll see
[1:00:05] you up there never seen him
[1:00:08] since and after that I just drive home
[1:00:11] just crying you know just asking Lord
[1:00:14] repenting asking you know what what what
[1:00:16] must I do and go home and uh I just I
[1:00:21] call it my pastor brother Donnie cuz I
[1:00:22] live in Johnson City and
[1:00:25] say I need to get baptized he says when
[1:00:27] son I say right now I don't know if I

[1:01:03] and all the cares that I had before the
[1:01:04] worries and everything was just gone and
[1:01:07] I want to praise God for that and he's

[1:01:25] Elijah's
[1:01:27] 21 22 22 sorry it's a big deal big
[1:01:33] different but God did a work for
[1:01:36] him in his
[1:01:38] life and he was living in Johnson City

[1:07:26] Jesus and she approaches him in the
[1:07:28] right way
[1:07:31] Lord if thou would have been us here my
[1:07:35] brother had not
[1:07:37] died that's incredible
[1:07:40] Faith but I know that even now what a
[1:07:46] statement even now whatsoever thou will
[1:07:50] ask of
[1:07:52] God God will give it
[1:07:56] thee and Jesus saith unto her thy
[1:08:00] brother shall rise
[1:08:04] again verse
[1:08:06] 34 and said where have you laid
[1:08:09] him and they said unto him Lord come and
[1:08:13] see and Jesus
[1:08:16] wept then said the Jews beholding how he
[1:08:19] loved him and some of them said could
[1:08:23] not this man which opened the eyes of
[1:08:26] the
[1:08:28] blind have caused that even this man
[1:08:31] should not have
[1:08:34] died Jesus therefore groaning in himself
[1:08:37] cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a
[1:08:40] stone lay upon it and Jesus
[1:08:44] said take ye away the
[1:08:49] stone Martha the sister of him that was
[1:08:52] dead said unto him him Lord by this time
[1:08:56] he
[1:08:57] stinketh for he had been dead four
[1:09:01] days and Jesus said unto
[1:09:04] her said I not unto
[1:09:07] thee that if thou wouldest
[1:09:10] believe thou should us see the glory of
[1:09:15] God then they took away the Stone from
[1:09:18] the place where the dead was laid and
[1:09:21] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father
[1:09:24] I thank thee that thou has heard me and
[1:09:27] I knew that thou had heardest me always
[1:09:31] but because the people which stand by I
[1:09:33] said it that they may believe that thou
[1:09:38] has sent
[1:09:39] me and when he had thus spoken he cried
[1:09:42] with a loud
[1:09:44] voice Lazarus come forth brother brandom
[1:09:48] said had he not called him by name there
[1:09:50] would have been a general
[1:09:52] Resurrection and he and he that was dead
[1:09:56] came forth bound hand and foot with
[1:09:59] grave clothes and his face was bound
[1:10:03] about with a napkin and Jesus said unto
[1:10:07] them loose him and let him
[1:10:11] go what a powerful scripture let's talk
[1:10:14] to him Lord Jesus we love you today we
[1:10:17] thank you to be in your house one more
[1:10:19] time what an incredible opportunity that
[1:10:22] you give us to come and hear the words

[1:10:31] many different places it'll go to many
[1:10:33] different Hearts now Lord you know
[1:10:36] exactly you know exactly how to deal

[1:10:57] anoint our mind and anoint our vocal
[1:10:59] cords to speak the word now Lord I don't

[1:11:05] anoint this
[1:11:07] congregation May yesterday be over with
[1:11:10] May tomorrow be somewhere in the future
[1:11:13] but may we now catch this moment that
[1:11:15] we're in and may you call us by name and
[1:11:19] speak to our hearts in a special way we
[1:11:22] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[1:11:25] amen you can be
[1:11:32] seated brother random would tell the
[1:11:34] story it's been told many
[1:11:38] times there was a great
[1:11:41] circus that was taking place under a
[1:11:44] huge
[1:11:46] tent there was a man that was that was
[1:11:49] going to walk the high
[1:11:51] wire and he walked it backwards and
[1:11:53] forwards and as he did everybody was
[1:11:57] applauding and after a little while he
[1:12:00] begin to say he pulled out a wheelbarrow
[1:12:03] and he said how many really believe that
[1:12:07] I can take this wheelbarrow across this
[1:12:09] high wire and he begin to work the
[1:12:12] audience submit do you really
[1:12:18] believe do you really
[1:12:21] believe do you really believe and this
[1:12:24] one guy be to scream and he begin to
[1:12:26] scream I absolutely believe and he said
[1:12:29] well if you really believe get in the
[1:12:31] wheel
[1:12:38] barrel that's a catch 22
[1:12:42] story do you really
[1:12:46] believe boy you're
[1:12:49] quiet do you really I'm not going to put
[1:12:52] you in a WHEB
[1:12:55] but do you really
[1:12:58] believe after everything that you have
[1:13:01] seen and everything that you have
[1:13:04] heard many of you have been here for
[1:13:07] decades you've heard some of the
[1:13:09] greatest sermons that's ever been
[1:13:10] preached some of the greatest men that's
[1:13:12] ever preached in SHO leather has came
[1:13:15] and preached to
[1:13:16] you but just to set an occupy time and
[1:13:19] to be entertained by it is not enough
[1:13:25] but do you really
[1:13:28] believe we're facing a challenge now
[1:13:30] more than facing cancer or facing job
[1:13:34] situations or facing your different
[1:13:37] difficulties of family life or economic
[1:13:41] situations we're facing a a
[1:13:45] graveyards where people have laid for
[1:13:48] maybe even couple thousand years
[1:13:51] decomposed bodies are now in to the
[1:13:53] gases do we really believe that the
[1:13:56] resurrection is Right upon us and
[1:13:59] they're standing just a half a step from
[1:14:02] us do we really believe that our gray
[1:14:05] hair and no longer need glasses and no
[1:14:08] longer need artificial limbs and all
[1:14:10] these different kind of things do we
[1:14:12] really believe that this
[1:14:17] message do we really believe that this
[1:14:20] message has the transforming power
[1:14:23] not just to live an overcoming
[1:14:26] life not just to help us to be good
[1:14:28] citizens of the kingdom of God not just
[1:14:31] to be moms and dads and have good
[1:14:34] children and have a good Community
[1:14:36] Church but do we really
[1:14:40] believe that in the moment of the
[1:14:42] twinkling of an
[1:14:43] eye this message has produced the
[1:14:46] quality and the character to put us
[1:14:50] there more than quotes
[1:14:54] more than books more than
[1:14:57] tapes more than
[1:15:02] pictures come on
[1:15:04] church more than just having a a Rah
[1:15:07] more than just emotions more than all of
[1:15:10] that but when it comes right down to it
[1:15:13] do we
[1:15:22] believe
[1:15:24] sometimes
[1:15:26] impossibilities are more than our minds
[1:15:28] can
[1:15:30] comprehend there's some boys sitting on
[1:15:32] this platform that a few weeks ago never
[1:15:34] thought in their wildest
[1:15:37] imagination first of all that they'd be
[1:15:39] in
[1:15:40] church second of all they'd enjoy
[1:15:46] it and then they would be
[1:15:49] here and then they would testify to the
[1:15:51] world of what God has done for
[1:15:56] them sometimes things seem like it's a
[1:15:58] dream or an impossible
[1:16:00] situation God takes
[1:16:04] impossibilities and makes realities out
[1:16:08] of
[1:16:08] it now let me just drop back and give
[1:16:11] you a few quotes here brother B says now
[1:16:13] let there be God spoke it and it began
[1:16:17] to
[1:16:18] materialize the very
[1:16:20] ground that you are set on here tonight
[1:16:24] is the word of God
[1:16:27] materialized did you know that of course
[1:16:30] we we knew
[1:16:32] that God just said it let there be and
[1:16:37] it
[1:16:39] was he believed his own
[1:16:42] word then he's almighty God and if he's
[1:16:45] almighty God he can do all
[1:16:49] things and if he cannot do all things he
[1:16:53] is an almighty
[1:16:55] God and if the scripture tells us that
[1:16:59] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:17:08] forever he says now in another place he
[1:17:11] said I'm so glad that Jesus left us a
[1:17:14] solid rock Foundation of his
[1:17:18] resurrection we don't have to wonder if
[1:17:20] it's the truth the amazing thing is that
[1:17:24] so many people doesn't see it he said
[1:17:27] I've wondered it tonight I'm going to
[1:17:29] try to approach it in the scriptures now
[1:17:31] if you would notice that these ones that
[1:17:34] was at the tomb I want you to catch
[1:17:37] these things these ones that was at the
[1:17:39] tomb early in the morning they met two
[1:17:43] men which were
[1:17:45] angels in and Shining
[1:17:48] apparel which said unto them that he
[1:17:51] that he was and he
[1:17:54] saidh seek ye the living oh yeah why
[1:17:58] seek ye the living among the
[1:18:01] dead and they had went to the tomb and
[1:18:04] found that he was not there and they
[1:18:07] asked this notable question why are you
[1:18:09] seeking the living among the
[1:18:12] dead and he said these things he told
[1:18:17] you when you he was in Galilee now watch
[1:18:21] what brother Adam does with that he said
[1:18:23] maybe you might just have read that over
[1:18:26] the top but let's just study that just
[1:18:29] for a moment that angel he said he told
[1:18:33] you those things when he was in Galilee
[1:18:37] and they didn't understand
[1:18:39] it why they didn't get
[1:18:42] it and here's another significance of it
[1:18:46] these ones who told him thus or told
[1:18:50] these disciples that was at the grave
[1:18:53] that they must have been with him in
[1:18:55] Galilee they knew what Jesus had told
[1:18:58] them before his
[1:19:00] crucifixion oh what a blessing you see
[1:19:03] those disciples didn't know that the
[1:19:05] Angels were
[1:19:08] there but they evidently was
[1:19:12] there because they said did not he tell
[1:19:15] you these things while he was at
[1:19:18] Galilee the angel was reminded him while
[1:19:22] you said in the meeting with him at
[1:19:25] Galilee they didn't see the
[1:19:32] Angels they didn't see the Angels you
[1:19:35] don't have to see them but they're
[1:19:38] here and that fulfills the scriptures
[1:19:41] that the angels of God are encamped
[1:19:43] about those who fear Him and what a
[1:19:46] great thing that it is to know tonight
[1:19:49] that right in this building there's
[1:19:51] angels of God standing in attention and
[1:19:54] they know every word that we say and
[1:19:57] everything that we do and here's the
[1:19:59] scriptural proof of it did not he tell
[1:20:03] you these things while he was at Galilee
[1:20:05] remember he told you those things
[1:20:09] remember oh what a marvelous
[1:20:14] word he said oh I I want to I want to
[1:20:17] capture this Oh What a Sad thing that's
[1:20:21] going to be for the Lost
[1:20:24] that after they have sealed their
[1:20:27] Doom after they've heard their last
[1:20:30] sermon to be over in a devil's hell
[1:20:34] lost and no chance at all to
[1:20:38] repent now notice these words to
[1:20:41] remember the
[1:20:44] opportunities that they've turned
[1:20:48] down amen you say unto me then preach
[1:20:53] pracher is there Remembrance in
[1:20:57] hell he said Jesus said there was that's
[1:21:02] right he was a rich man that lifted up
[1:21:05] his eyes in hell and saw Abraham and
[1:21:08] lius in his
[1:21:10] bosom and he said remember in your
[1:21:16] lifetime there is a
[1:21:19] remembrance in
[1:21:21] hell
[1:21:24] I want to just capture this before we go
[1:21:27] on for the Lost how a horrible
[1:21:32] thing that it would be to know that the
[1:21:35] great meetings that they set
[1:21:37] in and heard the mighty sermons of the
[1:21:40] anointed Ministers of
[1:21:43] God and not only that but see the
[1:21:47] anointed signs and wonders and God
[1:21:50] performed among the people
[1:21:54] and to remember all of these
[1:21:56] warnings and yet be
[1:22:01] lost why it would haunt them
[1:22:10] forever I'd like for that to stick with
[1:22:12] you if you
[1:22:14] can so many times we have funerals you
[1:22:17] go to
[1:22:19] funerals and you know a guy lives his
[1:22:23] life he never did want to serve God he
[1:22:26] never wanted to commit his life to God
[1:22:29] he never wanted to do anything for
[1:22:32] God but he dies cuz that what that's
[1:22:35] what we do without a Rapture that's what
[1:22:38] we do that's a
[1:22:41] reality but then a minister will stand
[1:22:43] in the in the at the
[1:22:46] podium and he'll put that guy in
[1:22:49] heaven well that man would be
[1:22:51] uncomfortable in heaven
[1:22:53] he never wanted to
[1:22:56] go I'm going to preach to
[1:22:59] you he never wanted to go his whole life
[1:23:02] and maybe spend his life giving
[1:23:06] excuses you got nobody to blame but
[1:23:11] yourself nobody to blame but yourself
[1:23:14] goddess had songs written to you he's
[1:23:17] he's had preachers to preach to
[1:23:20] you you made the choice
[1:23:24] don't blame me don't blame your wife
[1:23:26] don't blame your husband don't blame
[1:23:29] anybody but brother RNA had a bad life
[1:23:31] but you had an
[1:23:34] opportunity don't bypass your
[1:23:37] opportunity you may never get it
[1:23:41] [Applause]
[1:23:51] again
[1:23:55] you were going home to commit suicide
[1:23:58] walking your way home but God had
[1:24:00] different
[1:24:02] plans and look at his family amen thank
[1:24:06] you Lord look at his
[1:24:07] family what an
[1:24:12] opportunity what an
[1:24:16] opportunity I I you you told me

[1:24:21] prison can I can I relay
[1:24:24] that he was in a heavy
[1:24:28] security maximum
[1:24:32] security God you know God's not really
[1:24:35] even interested in your
[1:24:38] situation he's looking at your
[1:24:42] future and he finds all of his kids in
[1:24:51] trouble
[1:24:55] he's in prison I think in
[1:24:57] Texas he's in prison in Texas he's in a
[1:25:02] behind a
[1:25:03] glass with other people other other
[1:25:09] men and and the guy asked him about
[1:25:11] serpent
[1:25:13] seed what was the original sin in the
[1:25:15] garden and he says well it was
[1:25:20] sex he said do you know a man named
[1:25:23] William brandham well he grew up in that
[1:25:26] but listen he's a million miles from
[1:25:28] being converted and now he's being
[1:25:30] reminded about what he grew up
[1:25:35] in that man was in prison for something
[1:25:38] insignificant basically very rich man
[1:25:41] had just forged something shortened his
[1:25:44] name wound up in the passport now he's
[1:25:47] in prison he Saidi won't be here but a
[1:25:49] few days but I'm here for
[1:25:51] you
[1:25:53] the man before
[1:25:55] him was a
[1:25:59] believer that man gets dismissed he
[1:26:01] takes his place he's running from
[1:26:06] God the first
[1:26:09] shipment that came from anywhere not
[1:26:12] from his mom not from his dad not from
[1:26:14] anybody that's can to him nobody even
[1:26:16] knew he was there he gets a box of
[1:26:20] books Hallelujah serpent SE Church age
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:35] book months later he finds God let me to
[1:26:38] say this you God's determined to find
[1:26:40] his
[1:26:43] seed
[1:26:49] Hallelujah he's
[1:26:51] determined
[1:26:57] now you remember that we sitting here
[1:27:00] today are the very projected thoughts of
[1:27:03] God he just didn't think about the moon
[1:27:05] the stars and the Earth that was his
[1:27:08] first Bible but he had you in his mind
[1:27:12] before the foundation of the
[1:27:14] world now John 1 in the beginning God
[1:27:19] created the heavens and the Earth but
[1:27:21] when the message came our messenger took
[1:27:23] us back before there was a
[1:27:27] beginning because that mystery had to be
[1:27:31] hid till this end time under the seals
[1:27:34] to where God could reflect who was in
[1:27:37] his
[1:27:39] mind and then he PRS to project his
[1:27:42] thoughts and God's watched over you
[1:27:45] since before the foundation of the world
[1:27:47] and even when Adam fell God just didn't
[1:27:50] throw the book Away but then he watches
[1:27:53] over you through all of your genetics
[1:27:55] and through all your DNA and I know
[1:27:57] you've heard this a thousand times but
[1:27:59] never
[1:28:00] forget where God has brought you
[1:28:03] from and you may say well brother Ron
[1:28:06] I've never seen a miracle you are a
[1:28:10] miracle to be sitting here you are a
[1:28:14] miracle some of you are one in a family
[1:28:16] and your family is dispersed in all kind
[1:28:18] of trouble and all kind of situations
[1:28:21] all kind of hor that you've went through
[1:28:24] and you know you could just write a book
[1:28:26] on the hor that you've saw and yet God
[1:28:28] held
[1:28:30] you he held you and you go well I don't
[1:28:34] know what held me I'll tell you what
[1:28:36] held you God held you a God that's rich
[1:28:40] in Mercy a God that watched over you put
[1:28:43] a protection around you put angels to
[1:28:46] watch over
[1:28:51] you
[1:28:53] just as much as God said let there
[1:28:56] be laying on the inside of you it laid
[1:28:58] dormant for a long time but all of a
[1:29:01] sudden a seed that God put there before
[1:29:04] the foundation of the world God begins
[1:29:06] to brood over that seed now no man can
[1:29:08] come to God unless the spirit of God
[1:29:11] draws him so God begins to brood over
[1:29:15] that seed he begins to watch over that
[1:29:19] now as our Story begins to to share with
[1:29:23] us
[1:29:25] that brother Brandon would tell us
[1:29:28] that that Jesus and Lazarus were
[1:29:33] friends even
[1:29:35] before and being
[1:29:38] friends John was
[1:29:41] baptizing and Lazarus took Jesus to be
[1:29:49] baptized no doubt they had had a lot of
[1:29:51] stories they shared together they
[1:29:53] enjoyed one another's company it was a
[1:29:55] place where Jesus could
[1:29:57] rest
[1:29:59] amen I personally would like to have a
[1:30:01] house to where that Jesus would enjoy
[1:30:04] coming
[1:30:06] to well brother Ron that was 2,000 years
[1:30:08] well let let me just bring it up a
[1:30:09] little bit maybe brother Brandon would
[1:30:11] enjoy coming and hanging out kind of
[1:30:13] like George and Hattie's house and you
[1:30:17] know he could tell squirrel stories and
[1:30:19] he could talk about different things
[1:30:21] just be down to earth maybe Charlie's
[1:30:23] house and you know just be down to earth
[1:30:25] maybe sitting
[1:30:27] in in Northern
[1:30:30] Canada having a
[1:30:32] fire and with a young preacher named
[1:30:35] Eddie and you know they're sitting there
[1:30:37] and one's taking a night watching the
[1:30:39] other one's the other one's sleeping and
[1:30:42] and he says Eddie go to sleep and he
[1:30:45] said I'll watch for a little while and
[1:30:48] then when he when he wakes him up
[1:30:50] brother Eddie said I got got up and I
[1:30:52] went over and sat where brother brandham
[1:30:54] was sat and he said brother brandham
[1:30:55] went down he went to sleep and he said I
[1:30:58] just
[1:30:59] knew I had stepped into a
[1:31:08] presence where the Prophet was talking
[1:31:12] to
[1:31:13] God and he'd been fellow shipping with
[1:31:16] that he would later tell us about a car
[1:31:19] going down the road and an angel drops
[1:31:21] in the car
[1:31:23] right how that that presence pressed him
[1:31:26] against the
[1:31:30] window he said I hear people say I've
[1:31:34] had experiences like that he said I tell
[1:31:36] you none of you've had an experience
[1:31:38] like that where that being is like that
[1:31:42] sitting in that car he said I when I
[1:31:44] finally looked at brother brandom said
[1:31:46] he was Ash and white and his beard was
[1:31:47] standing straight out said after a bit
[1:31:51] we spoke and he said every time he comes
[1:31:55] to me something good always
[1:31:59] happens and he said they were there to
[1:32:01] kill an animal and he said just down the
[1:32:05] road there stood that animal and brother
[1:32:08] Bram just kept driving he said brother
[1:32:10] Bram it's close enough it's close enough
[1:32:12] it's close enough he said when I got out
[1:32:14] of the car to
[1:32:16] shooting he said I literally had to look
[1:32:19] in the
[1:32:20] scope and try to find out where I was at
[1:32:23] on the
[1:32:24] animal listen that's that's almost
[1:32:27] impossible it's almost impossible to be
[1:32:30] able to drive up on an animal but
[1:32:32] because the presence in the
[1:32:34] car is greater than the
[1:32:40] creation I'm dropping these things for
[1:32:42] you just for a moment it's greater than
[1:32:45] your work life it's greater than your
[1:32:47] situation it's
[1:32:50] greater it's greater and he wants to
[1:32:54] experience how great he
[1:32:58] is you say brother Ron Waffle House
[1:33:02] God's not ashamed of Waffle
[1:33:13] House he'll find you in a bar
[1:33:19] joint worst fight I ever got in in my
[1:33:22] life
[1:33:24] worse was on a man called brother randam
[1:33:26] a false prophet it was not a good night
[1:33:32] amen what'd you do wasn't a good night
[1:33:35] for
[1:33:45] him no doubt this home was a place to
[1:33:48] where Jesus rested enjoyed
[1:33:50] himself
[1:33:52] but God knows all
[1:33:54] things
[1:33:57] now he's on a he's on a
[1:34:01] campaign Lazarus become sick don't get
[1:34:04] ahead of me larus become sick as he
[1:34:08] become sick they send word to
[1:34:13] Jesus no
[1:34:16] response even the disciples say you know
[1:34:20] should we go back maybe
[1:34:23] he goes
[1:34:24] on he even explains to him to them that
[1:34:28] he's only
[1:34:29] sleeping well they don't
[1:34:33] understand and he gets sicker and he
[1:34:36] gets sicker now you know this is what
[1:34:38] the the critics begin to get in now you
[1:34:40] know critics always
[1:34:41] come and so now he's he's he's getting
[1:34:45] sicker and you know he Jesus isn't
[1:34:49] coming he isn't coming
[1:34:52] you know people get an attitude then you
[1:34:54] know he's not coming he's right on
[1:34:58] time and so you
[1:35:02] know he's going away and going the
[1:35:05] opposite direction the way they think he
[1:35:08] should be
[1:35:09] going Hallelujah and he do now you know
[1:35:14] critic really turns up the the deal now
[1:35:18] he's
[1:35:19] dead he don't even show up for the
[1:35:22] funeral
[1:35:31] amen they wrap
[1:35:34] him they take him to the Grave they
[1:35:37] Place him in the
[1:35:38] grave they seal the grave with a
[1:35:46] rock then they hear that Jesus is
[1:35:50] coming well sure he's going to show up
[1:35:52] too late he's going he's going to
[1:35:54] comfort the family he's going to comfort
[1:35:56] them all
[1:35:58] right you can hear the critic boom well
[1:36:00] now he's showing
[1:36:04] up now he's showing up remember when
[1:36:07] brother Brandon was killing that 42-inch
[1:36:09] caribou and that Silver Tip grizzly bear
[1:36:12] how many believe that was a vision amen
[1:36:16] a vision become real that's
[1:36:19] right you know
[1:36:22] even even when brother bud is walking
[1:36:24] down off the hill after they've killed
[1:36:26] the 42in horns and measured it it's
[1:36:28] absolutely perfect they're walking down
[1:36:30] off of the hill
[1:36:31] and and the brother goes I don't see a
[1:36:35] bear for miles and I Can See For Miles
[1:36:37] he's a guide and brother brandom ask him
[1:36:40] says are you doubting the vision I'm
[1:36:42] going somewhere with these things now
[1:36:44] I'm kind of pulling different
[1:36:47] gears and he's asking him are you
[1:36:49] doubting the vision
[1:36:52] no I I'm not doubting the vision brother
[1:36:55] Brandon because what happened with my
[1:36:56] brother with the seizures I I I I'm I'm
[1:36:59] not doubting that Vision I'm not
[1:37:01] doubting but I can't see it it doesn't
[1:37:03] matter if you can't see it he's still
[1:37:06] the same Jehovah
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:14] Gyra and brother brandham kills this
[1:37:17] charging grizzly bear you can watch that
[1:37:19] on you Youtube get a good kick out of it
[1:37:22] people standing in front of a charging
[1:37:24] grizzly bear where our Prophet was
[1:37:26] standing in front of a charging grizzly
[1:37:29] bear and he shoots it with too small a
[1:37:31] gun with one
[1:37:33] shot but the vision said one
[1:37:37] shot so brother Brandon was trusting the
[1:37:41] same vision that squirrels
[1:37:44] came that a storm was out of
[1:37:48] existence he was trusting that voice
[1:37:51] that had always
[1:37:53] trusted whether in the pull pit with
[1:37:55] people and critics and everywhere never
[1:37:57] ashamed if brother he said if God spoke
[1:37:59] to him to go call George Washington and
[1:38:01] Abraham Lincoln I'd call the whole
[1:38:07] world but let me tell you even greater
[1:38:10] than that all of our loved
[1:38:13] ones are going to be called one of these
[1:38:16] mornings they won't come out in an old
[1:38:19] body they'll come out on and a
[1:38:23] young a young
[1:38:27] body because that's what the word said
[1:38:30] they would
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:41] do Lord if you would have been
[1:38:44] here my
[1:38:46] brother would not have
[1:38:50] died
[1:38:52] brother Bram says and when she got to
[1:38:54] him she approached him the right
[1:38:57] way she said give him the right side
[1:39:00] title Lord she didn't up braid him Lord
[1:39:04] if thou have been here my brother
[1:39:05] wouldn't have not have died oh my I can
[1:39:09] see him pulling his little tired body
[1:39:11] together and and he
[1:39:16] said she said if thou would have been
[1:39:19] here my brother would not have died but
[1:39:23] even
[1:39:25] now but even now whatever you ask God
[1:39:30] God will give it to you she knowed
[1:39:34] notice these words she know what the god
[1:39:37] of creation
[1:39:39] was she knowed he was the anointed
[1:39:43] Messiah she approached him in the right
[1:39:46] way upon her
[1:39:48] knees Lord if that would have been here
[1:39:51] my brother would not have
[1:39:53] died but even now whatever you ask God
[1:39:58] God will give it to
[1:40:00] you oh if I could only think of of that
[1:40:04] even now
[1:40:06] Lord whatever you ask
[1:40:09] God God will give it to you and he said
[1:40:12] I am the resurrection and the
[1:40:15] life no other man could ever say that I
[1:40:19] am the resurrection and the life do we
[1:40:21] believe
[1:40:22] that do we really believe that and he
[1:40:26] that believeth on me though he were dead
[1:40:29] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[1:40:32] and believeth in me shall never die and
[1:40:36] he asked the question believest thou
[1:40:43] this and her response was yay Lord I
[1:40:48] believe that that you're the son of God
[1:40:51] that has come into the world and he
[1:40:54] asked her a real important question
[1:40:56] where have you laid
[1:41:01] him some of us were laying in
[1:41:03] denominational
[1:41:06] tombs some of us were laying in some
[1:41:09] really bad sinful
[1:41:12] situations we were wrapped up that's
[1:41:15] right now let's just let's just think
[1:41:18] just for a
[1:41:19] minute by the message message of the
[1:41:21] hour where was Lazarus at he was in a
[1:41:24] place called once he slipped from this
[1:41:27] realm of life he slipped into a place
[1:41:30] called Abraham's
[1:41:32] bosom and there was where the Old
[1:41:34] Testament saints were gathered that's
[1:41:37] right fellowshipping together
[1:41:40] conversating together can you imagine
[1:41:42] many of them were looking at the
[1:41:45] prophecy that was to come and look at at
[1:41:47] the prophecy to come maybe 800 years
[1:41:50] later thousand years later they died not
[1:41:53] being able to see that but they held on
[1:41:56] to that prophecy whether it's Isaiah or
[1:41:59] Jeremiah or Nehemiah or nahome they held
[1:42:03] onto the
[1:42:04] prophecy they held onto the word even
[1:42:07] though that their life expired and went
[1:42:10] into the dust of the earth even job
[1:42:13] would ask the question if a man die will
[1:42:17] he live
[1:42:19] again amen
[1:42:21] you know we we read in the scriptures
[1:42:23] about we read in the scriptures about
[1:42:25] resurrection of life and Resurrection
[1:42:28] the promise and and even even Abraham
[1:42:31] would be dealt with as we heard last
[1:42:33] night Abraham being turned young again
[1:42:35] and and Sarah be turned young again even
[1:42:38] to the point to where a
[1:42:41] king would so want her as his wife and I
[1:42:46] want to preach a sermon in a few weeks
[1:42:48] on the Dilemma that God puts us in amen
[1:42:51] and and and they are in this dilemma
[1:42:54] there's a reason why they had to find
[1:42:56] themselves there because there's an end
[1:42:58] time
[1:42:59] bride that there's a message that's
[1:43:01] going to transform them to meet the
[1:43:03] challenge of the
[1:43:05] hour you're not going to stay
[1:43:11] old you're not going to stay
[1:43:14] baldheaded you're not going to stay with
[1:43:16] cancer in your
[1:43:18] body that's not what you're rejected
[1:43:21] future
[1:43:22] [Applause]
[1:43:31] is brother Justin's a nor egg farmer but
[1:43:35] that's just
[1:43:36] life if he owned the biggest egg Farm in
[1:43:39] the whole
[1:43:40] state in the whole United States of
[1:43:43] America he owned it all and he missed
[1:43:47] what's God's doing
[1:43:49] here all the outside world the police
[1:43:53] world all of that's important in this
[1:43:55] natural life but it's not so important
[1:43:58] in that
[1:44:00] life brother Ron hurry up I got to go

[1:44:45] things to do we don't know what Lazarus
[1:44:46] did in his
[1:44:48] life you know there's not even a word it
[1:44:50] says what Lazarus did in his life what
[1:44:52] his jobs were but let me just say this
[1:44:54] that wasn't important he knew
[1:45:01] Jesus are you with me there was
[1:45:03] incredible millionaires that were here
[1:45:04] when John Wesley was

[1:47:32] brother Ron he looks old for his
[1:47:35] age he might go on to tell a few things
[1:47:38] like his first
[1:47:42] miracle there was a wedding took
[1:47:46] place they run out of wine you know for
[1:47:50] for the the community that was a big
[1:47:51] deal to run out of
[1:47:54] wine but I I was
[1:47:57] there
[1:47:58] and they brought it to him and asked him
[1:48:01] to bless
[1:48:03] it and he blessed
[1:48:05] it and when he blessed
[1:48:08] it that
[1:48:10] water was the best
[1:48:12] wine cuz he's the god of

[1:49:03] what he's done and what he's done and
[1:49:05] what he's
[1:49:08] done forgive me but let me just go on a
[1:49:11] sideline here Elisha say I I think I've
[1:49:14] experienced something like that you know
[1:49:17] I asked Elijah for a double portion
[1:49:21] and I knew that that wasn't Elijah that
[1:49:23] was producing that that was
[1:49:25] God and if I could get that God to live
[1:49:29] on the inside of me I could not just
[1:49:31] have what Elijah had but I could have a
[1:49:34] double portion of it not more po more
[1:49:38] more powerful but I could have twice as
[1:49:43] much and I experienced
[1:49:46] it and even when I was getting ready to
[1:49:48] die lay on my my my
[1:49:52] deathbed the one short of the miracle
[1:49:55] took
[1:49:56] place but I died and no doubt I had a
[1:50:00] lot of critics God won't do what he said
[1:50:03] he'd
[1:50:04] do God won't y'all been preaching
[1:50:07] Rapture for 50
[1:50:11] years y'all been preaching Resurrection
[1:50:14] forever are you just Building a Church
[1:50:17] no God's Building a bride
[1:50:21] he's just got to wait till these guys
[1:50:23] come
[1:50:25] home he'll not leave
[1:50:35] one can not leave
[1:50:37] one he's not interested in leaving

[1:54:48] trouble
[1:54:58] where have you laid
[1:55:00] him cuz he knew what was getting ready
[1:55:02] to happen he knew you were going to wle
[1:55:05] house before you chose it so he decided
[1:55:08] to meet you there he needed you you to
[1:55:11] go
[1:55:12] home because he had two servants that's
[1:55:15] going to preach to you one named Tim PR
[1:55:17] one named Joseph hman and now Ron
[1:55:19] Spencer
[1:55:21] and I'll be your buddy for however long
[1:55:23] he lets me be your buddy when you get
[1:55:25] when you have problems which you will
[1:55:27] we're going to always be
[1:55:28] here we're kind of like a
[1:55:31] compass
[1:55:33] amen we're kind of like a North star
[1:55:35] because Jesus is on the inside of us and
[1:55:37] when you get in trouble all you got to
[1:55:38] do is call text call text answer better
[1:55:41] to text than I do
[1:55:47] calls you know that Matthew your grandon
[1:55:50] ear to
[1:56:00] ear and Jesus begin to
[1:56:03] weep and they said well he's weeping
[1:56:05] because he was his
[1:56:07] friend they didn't know
[1:56:10] it Amen brother Tim PR preached in my
[1:56:13] mother's funeral and because
[1:56:18] the director said you've only got 45
[1:56:22] minutes and we had a few speakers I told
[1:56:25] brother Tim I said can you give us 10
[1:56:27] minutes I saw him set it on his on his
[1:56:29] computer 10 minutes I watched it click
[1:56:33] down to 9:59 he closed his computer it's
[1:56:36] done it's it can be
[1:56:48] done
[1:56:53] I have a license I'm the we're best
[1:56:57] friends but in that 10 minutes he said
[1:57:01] things that was so powerful I will never
[1:57:04] forget he said Jesus did not weep
[1:57:08] because they were
[1:57:11] friends he said he wept because he had
[1:57:15] to call him from where he was at back in
[1:57:19] into this
[1:57:20] world and he would get sick
[1:57:24] again and he would die again and he
[1:57:27] would have trouble again but he had to
[1:57:30] do
[1:57:33] it God bless you brother Tim he had to
[1:57:35] do
[1:57:38] it to show people who he
[1:57:48] was
[1:57:57] it won't be much
[1:57:59] longer and Jesus
[1:58:02] said roll away the
[1:58:06] stone now here comes the human element
[1:58:10] again Lord by now he
[1:58:16] stinketh how many of you sit in a in a
[1:58:18] pew
[1:58:20] where you're setting maybe you've been
[1:58:21] moved around a little bit today but
[1:58:23] where you're sitting and you hear the
[1:58:26] voice of a minister and the devil
[1:58:28] Whispers In Your Ear how many of you
[1:58:31] amen okay let's be honest now I I'll
[1:58:33] preach on Liars if you guys how many of
[1:58:36] you sat and listen to preachers and at
[1:58:38] the same time the enemy Whispers in your
[1:58:41] ear I thought I thought that would be a
[1:58:44] better
[1:58:45] rate cuz I didn't want to change the
[1:58:47] sermon I'm getting too late
[1:58:50] come on do you mean to tell me brother
[1:58:52] Ron I can be in the perfect will of God
[1:58:54] and the devil will
[1:58:57] steal that's exactly right but now he
[1:59:01] sth and she was right she was
[1:59:04] fundamentally right but Jesus had a
[1:59:07] future he had a future with Lazarus
[1:59:10] we're going to eat together this
[1:59:14] evening we're going to eat together this
[1:59:16] afternoon he going to be sitting at the
[1:59:17] table and there's going to be people
[1:59:19] come to to to to kill him
[1:59:24] again stupid people say stupid
[1:59:28] things and Jesus asked the
[1:59:32] girls roll away the
[1:59:36] stone well brother Ron we've heard that
[1:59:38] for we've heard that for years those
[1:59:41] women roll the stone away but have you
[1:59:43] looked at it in this
[1:59:45] context there was critics there was
[1:59:48] critics
[1:59:50] but now if they put their hands on that
[1:59:52] stone they're
[2:00:01] committed once they put their hands on
[2:00:03] the stone listen Jesus listen the same
[2:00:06] God had opened up a Red
[2:00:09] Sea the same God had taken Elisha and
[2:00:13] laid him in a tomb knowing he had one
[2:00:15] promise left and they throw a Dead
[2:00:18] Soldier in on top of we
[2:00:20] it and God raised that Soldier back
[2:00:23] up God will take care of his
[2:00:27] word you you don't have to fix it you
[2:00:29] don't have to make it happen us
[2:00:32] preachers don't have to make the Rapture
[2:00:34] happen we don't have to make the
[2:00:35] resurrection we just preach
[2:00:38] it we just say these Sons shall follow
[2:00:41] them that believe and we'll lay hands on
[2:00:42] the sick and God does the
[2:00:45] work we can't heal a
[2:00:48] soul
[2:00:55] amen you're
[2:00:58] committed when you put your hands on the
[2:01:01] stone because he asked
[2:01:03] them do you now
[2:01:06] believe now once you now
[2:01:09] believe now you're committed to
[2:01:13] it it doesn't matter if every critic in
[2:01:17] your family is in your ear here you're
[2:01:21] convinced now when you're convinced and
[2:01:23] it's sealed in your heart brother Steven
[2:01:26] every devil in
[2:01:29] hell every devil in hell can say
[2:01:33] everything that he wants to but you and
[2:01:35] God have had a
[2:01:38] conversation you and I had a
[2:01:40] conversation one time and she wasn't a
[2:01:43] Believer but God showed me she would be
[2:01:46] a believer and I told you something that
[2:01:49] look like an
[2:01:51] impossibility everybody can say well
[2:01:53] she's a real believer but you wasn't
[2:01:56] looking when we were
[2:02:06] looking oh anybody can Look Backwards
[2:02:08] say well God did that and God I'm
[2:02:10] talking about your
[2:02:12] future do you really believe that that
[2:02:15] going from these seats on to a rapture
[2:02:20] it's just a moment
[2:02:24] [Applause]
[2:02:47] away
[2:02:59] I need a
[2:03:02] shot I got a few more minutes to go here
[2:03:05] amen
[2:03:09] Lord Jesus could have spoke their
[2:03:11] problem out of
[2:03:13] existence but they begin to
[2:03:15] push
[2:03:17] imagine
[2:03:19] what the critics now
[2:03:21] thought Jesus is letting those two
[2:03:25] women two women push that huge Stone
[2:03:29] into place he was doing it for a
[2:03:34] purpose Jesus is letting his
[2:03:38] pride whip the devil in Le
[2:03:45] oia who brother Ron you
[2:03:57] in Russia it was behind the Iron Curtain
[2:04:01] in Russia they were this sit for the
[2:04:04] faint of heart but in Russia they were
[2:04:08] they were
[2:04:12] preparing a
[2:04:17] meeting they were beli
[2:04:20] preparing a meeting in a in a dark dark
[2:04:23] dark
[2:04:26] Church soldiers come in with machine
[2:04:31] guns said how many real believers do we
[2:04:34] have here in this building and people
[2:04:37] scattered they ran out the doors jumped
[2:04:39] out every place that they could jump out
[2:04:42] but about 15 stood
[2:04:46] there so is that it you ready to give
[2:04:49] your life yes we're give our life for
[2:04:53] this good we're Believers
[2:05:09] too it's kind of the same things
[2:05:11] happening
[2:05:13] here real Believers are going to take a
[2:05:17] rapture make Believers are going to give
[2:05:20] their life through the tribulation
[2:05:23] period you know sometimes we think well
[2:05:26] predestination is only for the bride God
[2:05:28] knows where everybody's going good bad
[2:05:31] and
[2:05:40] ugly they roll the stone away now
[2:05:44] they're
[2:05:45] identified with what he
[2:05:47] said because they believe with all their
[2:05:50] heart they're fully committed they're
[2:05:53] fully committed they believe the
[2:05:55] messages thus sayith the Lord and
[2:05:58] they're fully
[2:05:59] committed that there was a voice behind
[2:06:02] the voice brother R was only standing
[2:06:04] near when God did those things now we're
[2:06:07] standing near when God does these does
[2:06:09] these things do we really
[2:06:12] believe and so we push the stone
[2:06:15] away now the god of Two Worlds
[2:06:20] begins to call
[2:06:22] Lazarus and he says

[2:06:28] forth and in that
[2:06:31] realm Lazarus hears his
