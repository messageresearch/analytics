something that we just started it started back when we was up on the side of the mountain there at the road there brother homer brother bill would always give us friendly reminders of what we should do and stuff so you know we always should come in and pray and worship not move around and get our mind upon you you know you should already have him on there before you come here you shouldn't already be ready to worship and serve before you ever come here but i mean just have a respect for the house of the lord as you come in and be ready to to worship and and let the lord and the word bless you as you move forward uh some issues that's been brought up that has been brought to me and brother josh's attention and we addressed it one time before with a young man and it seemed to stop so it has been brought to our attention again over the last few weeks that there's been some excessive paper towel usage in the in the boys men's bathroom we just asked you please be respectful i mean we're not going to tell you who it is we dressed that young man and it stopped and i mean that that's we took care of that but it's done started back up again you know things are not cheap you know this is the house of lord we should respect it we should it shouldn't be nothing we shouldn't be coming around to try to waste be weight very wasteful i'm not wasteful at home i'm not going to be wasteful here so we want to try to do the right things there be responsible make sure your kids are responsible i mean if they're not going to be responsible when they go there take them with you you know when you go now i go in that bathroom i don't have small hands but i know i don't need no more two or three paper towels to dry my hands but i i appreciate that you are washing them i mean that's

nobody's we don't have that many big hands in here that we need to be wasting that many paper towels uh try to cut down on your trips you know i mean i know there there's times and little small babies they gotta go i mean i understand that but i mean if you up and age you in school i mean i don't think we're making that many trips in school to the bathrooms at least i wasn't allowed to when i was in school but maybe things would change but we try to i mean be respectful to people around you i mean if you do have an issue i don't understand that i'm not being critical here i mean if you did sort of try to you could sit towards your back and that way you won't be disturbing and interrupting everybody else as we do them um then after church when the church has just missed hey i'm no scene here i did these things you know i got called out many times but try not to run around i mean the cars is coming and going i mean we try to light it up the best we can but if you've got a little small kid and he hits a dark spot and and and your headlights and you don't see him i mean be responsible for your kids i mean we got elderly people here don't let them be running around out on the porch and trip somebody and make them fall and get hurt we try not to you know we're just trying to do the right things here it's just a reminders of of things here but we just want to respect the house of the lord come in worship be ready to serve and that's what we come here for i mean just do the right things that's what we do i had a coach one time you used to tell us all time do the right things

amen in case you don't know me i i just if i don't know your name i call you buddy amen so amen god bless you amen what a wonderful service already amen i thought last night was probably one of the greatest i've ever heard andrew preach and i saw him wrestling before service i saw him wrestling and i saw i i've been around here for a bit and so whatever he had on his ipad wasn't going to work [Music] you know just how it happens and i just said a little prayer for him and he took a little quote like that and preached that sermon last night and that was more than a man spoke that and then what we see take place here i was just overjoyed by what we witnessed last night little elijah coming to the altar and his heart being touched and nathan up here and each and every one of you that came erica my heart was over i thought my heart was going to explode when i was praying with you and he met sister crystal and uh amen i don't even know if you know i was praying with you or not but i was i was laboring with you and so amen god bless you we love you each and every one of you didn't call your name right there i just sure did enjoy i sure did enjoy what god did last night amen we had a wonderful time at brother bischolson and uh and brother tom raised it was their 50th anniversary and we're getting ready to come up on our 50th anniversary it's a jubilee for the bride had some wonderful services there and then we were able to fly home and then friday night we went to [Music] marks and spoke there and i'd like to personally thank each and every one of you that went and you were in that service and i know you had a late night friday night and thank you for coming and we sure did appreciate that with all of our hearts and amen next week brother aaron oglesby is going to be with us and uh the reason i'm going to mention him as brother aaron is is the young man that was brother tim pruitt's son-in-law and and i want to do this because i think we got some elements together that that would be make a nice picture and aaron is going to be the speaker next week and and he was not a preacher at that time and tim just kind of chuckled about it a little bit but he's a phenomenal speaker and looked forward to hear him and [Music] it happened the same night that i saw the vision of isaac and isaac was an impossible so i want to i want to do this this morning before i preach the sermon that i'm going to preach i want to speak to you because as i watched that happen last night to andrew it was happening to me and i was over in the corner and what i had to preach this morning was not working [Music] and i thought well i'll sit in the corner and make some notes well his sermon was too good for me to sit and make notes and so last night about 12 30 or 1 o'clock i came to resolution and then got up and studied again this morning and so i believe what god's got for us this day is going to speak to our hearts but before i do i want to i want to remind us let's this is a memorial day more than a flag whitney i would like for you to bring we're zoe at so awake yeah i'd like for you to bring zoe and amen amen zoe and isaac where's charlie charlie charlie's here amen [Music] caitlin charlie ate at my table this morning wasn't really happy about it but he ate at my table and amen amen could you bring wes [Music] you know for those that are on the internet that don't know that god's still doing miracles amen let's bring them up here amen amen amen i knew it was another name i needed to come yes i come come out anaya amen yes that's right yeah for those that don't know sister autumn and sister whitney were back to back in the prayer line and the words to you were the same angel that's going to her house came to your house amen amen amen could you guys get a picture up there amen this is a day of remembrance amen god bless you give the lord a big hand but god bless you god bless you baby [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen amen tania it's good

turn over to your neighbor say good to have you here good to have you here amen amen let's stand here amen maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to say lord come meet my need you can kind of feel it almost like a fluttering in this building today just a flooding of his presence amen lord jesus i surrender myself to you [Music] lord come now come now lord more than just a minister but may across this audience may this audience be filled with the presence of the lord come and touch us now we raised our hands to you and we have great needs lord we're thankful for last night's service it it so stirred our hearts lord now minister to us today bless this service we pray anoint our lips in jesus name we pray amen and amen and amen amen thank you sister cassie amen god bless you god bless you if you will turn with me to psalms chapter 139 this was brought to me this morning by brother timothy batten and brother timothy you'll raise your hand right there i believe it was a couple weeks ago i did a couple weeks ago two weeks brother timothy came to me before service and he wanted to speak to me and just wanted some peace to come to his heart over decisions that they have to make some of those decisions are about moving here and becoming a part of the body here and so brother timothy we sat and we talked and we we just we just had a wonderful time and i walked out and he didn't know what i was going to preach and i spoke a sermon that you will remember in his hands and god had dealt with me to speak that in his hands he sat there and you can imagine what it was doing for him in 1997 they had had a wreck and for eagle's view he wrote an article and he titled it in his hands and he sat there knowing that he this had happened to him in 1997 and now god is speaking to him at this pivotal point in his life and god is speaking to him again in his hands these are more than just services these are more than just services this is god speaking to you and using the lips and i i tell you what it made me shiver a bit when he gave that to me and because i know you can't put these things together amen god just does it all amen so good to have each and every one of you this morning and amen god bless you psalms 139 and verse 1 this morning oh lord thou hast searched me and known me thou knowest my down setting mine uprising thou understandeth my thought afar off thou compasseth my path my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways for there is not a word in my tongue but lo oh lord thou knowest it altogether thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thy hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful for me it's it's high and i cannot attain unto it whether shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from thy presence notice these words if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me and if i say surely the darkness shall cover thee even the night shall be a light about me yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both the light to thee for thou possesseth my reigns thou coverst me in my mother's womb i will i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i wake i am still with thee hallelujah we could dismiss right there and go wow wow wow amen you can be seated many of you were born after 1977. how many wow let's just stand how many were born after 1977 amen after 1977 i'm not trying to pick on the old people here i just want to amen that whole sound booth upstairs is standing amen amen hallelujah god bless you you can be seated brother branham that was had the seven major visions and they were extremely accurate that could see cars that were driving themselves down the road that could see women getting the right to vote that could see adolf hitler that could see the earthquake that would take place all of the things that were that were there but our prophet was not allowed to look past the darkness of 1977. it is in the darkness that you have been born darkness so thick like revelations chapter 9 almost a gross darkness that is upon the people governments have lost their minds and immoral conditions of sodom and gomorrah is everywhere um churches have lost their vision things are have the world seems to have fell apart we're living in satan's eden and we can see the evidence of it and we can see how far can this go when children are now identifying themselves as cats and dogs needing litter boxes in the schools all that's mind-blowing to me what do you identify with when i was in canada a man was married to a hologram i don't even know what that all is about but he's married to an image on a wall to which that he throw he throws by light throws it up on the wall and he actually married that hologram how dark this age is i looked and this morning the futures for for fuel in our even in in the state of virginia is somewhere around eight dollars a gallon is what our futures is talking about to me that's mind blowing i i i just think that the whole the whole world has lost its it's lost its compass texas what happened in texas this last week god didn't do that god didn't cause that god didn't cause the war in ukraine he didn't he didn't cause the middle east to be like a sin caused that we have an enemy that kills and steals and destroys and if you could he'd take you off of the scene in a moment but you're protected by the angels of god [Applause] sometimes our conditions get just incredibly tough in the christian life it's a it's a war sometimes you begin to walk in in the christian life and you know you think well when i was drinking and smoking and cheating and lying and and i was doing those things i was having the time of my life but now that i've become a christian and my life has got cleaned up by the blood of jesus christ and now i'm having difficulties oh you had them then you had them then if you went to a professional ball game you spent about 300 and you paid your tithes to satan and you paid seven dollars a pack or maybe eight dollars a pack of cigarettes and you did that two or three times a day the devil didn't whisper in your ears you're spending too much money or when you were drinking beer and 12 and 12 and 15 dollars a carton and maybe up to 20 dollars a carton and then the wine that you were consuming and you was waking up sick the next morning [Applause] or you was taking a hit and you know people get scared to take the coven shot but they would take cocaine or spots of acid you know they're scared to death what the doctor will tell them but but they put drugs in their body and then wonder why kidneys don't go bad and liver goes bad and stomachs goes bad hey i can preach this cause my grandfather drank moonshine and it ate his stomach out of him thank god he met jesus before he left the earth are you with me and god gave him a new body uva put a sheep stomach in him and he lived he lived a short time and and he had came to the lord before all of that even before his diagnosis but but but sin pays a price sin has a phenomenal cost to it it'll cause you to have five minutes of pleasure i'm gonna preach with another man's wife or some young frilly thing and you forget about your wife and your children and your grandchildren for five minutes of selfish pleasure the devil will talk you into doing a lot of things [Music] and then call the law on you [Applause] as a young person's friends will put peer pressure on you that's real that's real they'll bully you with internet or they'll bully you with that or bully you in this kind of thing let me just say this to you for you to stand up for jesus you got more on your side than they got on their side i'll stand for jesus every day of the week [Applause] we've got we've got young people that are graduating here i'm proud of you i'm proud of you that's right i'm proud of you i gave a speech yesterday just a short one but i gave a speech a minute from my heart steve would be proud of jay coming to church now doing the right thing now let me just say this you all but he was he was gone for a while yep but so were you you know what as a pastor you know you can sit in your seat and make a lot of decisions but as a pastor i got to be with you through your life and there's going to be good times and bad times and ugly times and we're going to rejoice together but i'm going to have to fight for you when the devil's flipping you upside down cause there's going to come some night seasons in your life these things that we go through are temporal but we're here for the eternal purpose don't get your eyes on the temporary so jay we say it to you again welcome home we're proud of you amen you're going to college we're proud of that fact but i told him steve would be proud of him but whatever you do keep your eyes on jesus nathan we're proud of you amen we're proud of you we're proud of how you're singing we proud we're proud of how you're doing things here we're we're thrilled about that you're going to college and you're you're you're going to do the things and and uh and we're just we're just we're here with you we're friends we're your buddies others that have graduated that are here we're just thrilled for them as well some of them graduate in a casket we we hate to say goodbye goodbyes are hard to make i said this at brother biscuits should you hear ron spencer died don't you grief because i'll be more alive there than i was here so regardless of your diagnosis in life doctors that that have to tell you they're not lying to you they're telling you what they see they're trying to help suffering humanity to get from one day to another day unless you're going to a quack doctor that's giving you quack medicine they're trying to help you there's a lot of you that is coming in their offices and they don't have to make all their money on you are you with me they're not going to have their whole reputation upon you sometimes we as our individuals we get we get a we get bad news whether it's financial whether it's job related whether it's in a doctor's office we get bad news but it's what we do with the news now i'm preaching to you it's what we do with the news that makes the difference we have a choice david was in a tough spot when he's writing these scriptures if i'm in heaven thou art there if i'm in the in hell thou art there if i take the wings of the morning thy right hand shall cover me yea the darkness hideth me maybe god has pushed you into a spot and put you in position for a miracle by doing that whitney and autumn and their mates had to be barren for wes to have a miracle that we will talk about until time ends he had to be born with a condition that he couldn't walk sarah was barren the three hebrew children were going into a fiery furnace daniel was being cast into a lion's den miracles are made of messes [Applause] miracles are made of masses and sometimes they seem impossible and god specializes in impossibilities when doctors give up god specializes at that spot hallelujah we rejoice in this weekend we re we rejoice in where we're at as a bride of jesus christ here past 77 well over 50 years since the prophet passed away total darkness is all around us we are seeing our older ministers pass off of the scene one by one great men hildebrant that just passed my father that just passed brother henry greene your grandfather that passed brother dan dasley these were great men billy andrews that stood in the pulpit and i could go on and on and on and on we see ourselves becoming frail as human beings but let me just say god allows the candlestick to be moved from one portion to another and it might seem like a night season but god has a process of decreasing and increasing when brother branham left the scene in a car wreck it did not mean that the message was done it was only sowed and then it harvested and they come up and it's more powerful than it's ever been around the world when jesus went into a tomb and they sealed the tomb the devil didn't realize what he was doing it was in the night season in the in that cave that he would conquer hell he would take the keys of death hell and the grave and come forth with a parade of men like abraham and noah and those men would march out and he would ask them would you like to make a whistle stop back in israel and they'd go to some of those old places where they lived and walked past death could no longer touch them it was over for death and hell but you see light presses and it goes forward brother william said something the other night that just that just resonated i'd actually made a note on it but it just resonated when he said it and he said every other messenger their message was denominated and as it denominated it began the fires of it begin to die down and it it become a denomination where schools are built and all these different kind of things and ministry seminaries are taking place but when brother branham died we didn't go to a denomination but this message has risen hallelujah are you with me god help our churches let me just say this to you in the book of revelations it talks about that that god hated a lukewarm spirit and brother brown identifies that as a backslidden spirit andrew you said something about it last night but a backslidden spirit is easy to take on even in a message church and it happens because we get relaxed we fold our arms and say preach to me entertain me don't hold me too long now i'm not expecting to put anything in so don't y'all expect anything for me i'm not a preacher i'm not a singer i'm just gonna sit here you'll never get from nothing from god being a spectator this is not a spectator sport this is where you get out what you put in god asks us to worship our worship is with our mouth now your mouth has the power of life and death in it it can speak positive or it can speak negative and you create the world that you live in as i've said for years you that don't know what i'm saying here just tell your wife how ugly she looks this morning welcome to your day but we speak positive we sing positive that's why the opening of the service is so important it's so important when the song leader takes the service and he begins to lead you in worship and a lot of people yes they're sick but they got spiritual arthritis their hands don't their arms don't work their feet don't work are you with me now so what will happen is is they begin to make excuses of why they can't worship and the devil has so them a lie now i don't know if you know this or not but if you build fires you got to keep fires going there's a lot of wood stoves in this area i used to be a chimney sweep i'm thankful to god i'm not that anymore and not in that shape to do that no more but i would climb as far as well i fell 40 feet so that'll give you an idea but but let me let me just say this to you a lot of chimneys get set up because they burn their fire too low and there's a lot of people get suited up in buildings like this now we're not catholics and we're not going to send up a bunch of black or white smoke here today but we ought to be an open flame there ought to be a fire coming out of our heart now let me just say this you you've got to feed the fire you remember brother branham said that that old chief that oh indian said uh how are you doing he said well there's a war going on the inside of me he said there's two dogs are fighting well which one is winning he said the one that i feed the most so you can feed your carnal stinking flesh that is going to go back to the earth you can feed it and it'll feel real good and all of that but it don't feel good sometimes sitting here for three hours and it'll start telling you how stiff you're getting but it didn't tell you how stiff you were getting when you was watching a movie the scripture says we're troubled on every side but notice how he says this yet not distressed we are perplexed not in despair persecuted but not forsaken notice how he's telling us to take an attitude don't pity me you may be in a war but we're not having a pity party here cast down not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the lord jesus that the life of jesus might be manifested in our body think about that notice as it comes down verse 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceedingly eternal weight of glory notice these next words i want you to read it with me while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so can i take you through some temporary things for a moment sarah was barren best we can calculate about 89 years most of our life she was barren but god don't take a long time to get you fixed up three hebrew children's lived their entire lives with a testimony of being being going in a fire and the ones that throw them in the fire were killed and when they came out they didn't even smell like smoke lazarus went to a grave and jesus was gone and everybody else was criticizing your friend went the opposite way but god has a plan for the night seasons of your life he's got a plan for you don't blame god god's on your side [Applause] i'm mad at god you you're mad at the wrong one it's kind of like somebody promising you if you give me eighty thousand dollars i'll make you a millionaire if it's too big good to be true it is it is and sometimes the guy can be so convincing it'd be so convincing there was a guy at your place the other day and he was doing a real real job trying to sell you on something that would take you 40 years to pay off and he was projecting figures that for dominion power that he don't have a clue how that's going to go and i thought this guy is selling a hot air balloon and he helped me with the sermon today satan will sell you a lot of stuff i don't even know what your decision was on that thing but he'll sell you a whole lot of stuff it'll cause you bitterness it'll cause you jealousy he divides not only in washington he divides churches he divides friendships he divides marriages don't tell me you as the bride of jesus christ almost live perfect lives and homes and yet there's mornings that you wake up i i i i i i boy that landed and you go what in the world happened we almost live in a fairy tale marriage we went to bed and honeymoon and here we [Applause] you on the internet you know it's the truth you got down you had a prayer meeting you felt the presence of the lord sister connie punch him again go ahead and punch him again [Applause] she said i know that's the truth i'm going to punch him right now that's a truth that's a truth you had a prayer meeting but an enemy that has the right to affect your flesh and affect your spirit but it can't get to your soul how about somebody ought to shout right there he can't get to your soul so it can affect only this part it's the temporary part hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] now it's in that moment you can allow him to destroy your day or you can turn it on him and send him home i'll not put up with you today brother homer and i had a flat on the truck then we had a flat on the dump dump truck then we took a tractor up the road and i was riding on the bush hog wasn't safe we've not done a lot of safe things i was riding on the bush hog and the tire went flat on the tractor he got off and he looked at that tire this has all happened in a half an hour and he looked at that he didn't say nothing to me he pointed at that tire he said devil i refused for you to make me mad today and one at a time we got those tires fixed and we went and had dinner ain't that right sister nancy you live with brother homer had some horrendous things happen to him toward the end of his life i don't know whether you know if there's this or not but he had an attitude that he was going to get himself better regardless of what was happening and there was times that he came and i would push him up the back end in that wheelchair and brother ray had that built back there so we could push him in and we would get him in and on the way in he would take three pain pills and there would be times to where his eyes was as glassy as some of yours used to be and when he got that electric wheelchair for those that wasn't here he'd he'd have it right he'd have it there and he'd roll up here and he'd want to talk and say something whether you were singing or you wasn't singing he'd roll up here want to talk and then he rolled back it was a night season it was a night season of his life but something held him something held him his attitude didn't get cross and mean and stubborn and hateful that might have happened at times but he didn't show that to you let me just say your your problems may be worse than you can possibly seem to get through but god built you you said a few moments ago after 77 you were born you were not born in the light of the the the tent meetings and brother branham being here and the original church is being built but now you're here to live in maturity and to stand when all hell is against you this was sent to me the other day on the roughest days our lowest hours of despair even in those times we're still chosen blessed favored forgiven loved let of god victorious inheritors of all heaven's glory privileged to walk with our own creator we are married to the king of kings and he calls us his beloved we're strong in faith armed to fight devils entrusted with god's word with the most powerful weapon protected by the arm of the almighty he has placed us with a hedge around us we have the assurance that each time that we call he hears and he answers [Music] [Applause] we have rest and hope and peace and joy is ours even in the darkness his light is around us even in the valley we are so blessed brother ron but i've got too much pressure on me who did that i'm so exhausted who did that i'm so frustrated who did that god didn't do that but i've lost friends look around i've lost a lot of preaching buddies in life men that i thought were good buddies but if you commit adultery or you backslide or you decide alcohol is more important you don't need to stand in no pulpit gotta raise up somebody in your place that will live the life and preach it straight [Applause] well brother on i'm just going to suck myself back in the cave really that's a real spot for you it's a spot called depression it's a spot where the devil will whisper in your ear and tell you all kind of nonsense your spirit it'll contaminate your spirit word you don't have no trust in nobody on you don't have a quote for that oh yeah i do i don't do nothing i'm a chess player as a preacher brother branham is standing over his baby that's dying with no hope and his wife has just died and the devil's whispering in his ears how many of you ever had the devil whisper in you or you yeah so you're look around you you're not the only one and the devil tells him god don't love him let me just tell you in spite of yourself god loves you now god's not fickle like human beings your bills are paid and you're having a party and you got a new car and you got an awesome job and everybody is applauding you everybody happy everybody happy with mama happy everybody happy but when the world's being flipped upside down god's when he even has to change your diaper because you're being a big baby you're 43 years old and you're being just a big stupid baby he don't throw you in the garage pit he picked if you're 43 don't get mad at me i wasn't picking you out i just picked a number out i felt that i felt that don't you go don't you get don't get your panties in a wad [Applause] i got a quote i use sometimes brother ray this would be good kind of for keep hang on to it the more people i meet the more i like my dog it's more than just a good saying if you hang on to it you just might want to write that down it's not scripture you won't find it in the bible you won't find that in the bible you just put that in old brother ron's category hmm i got too much pressure who did that i'm just wore out who did that i'm completely wiped out i'm having a nervous breakdown who did that god didn't do it god didn't do that to you just suppose you're a joke today it's a light affliction i knew i wouldn't get as many amens so i preached this sukkah to the other day light afflictions no matter how bad they are if you compare it to job if you compare it to jesus being beat and going to calvary and being spit on sometimes preachers get sensitive but they didn't preach to the congregations that brother branham had to preach to where people are mad and demon possessed and all different kind of things are happening while he's trying to preach the seals but he stayed focused here's what i want to say to you you've heard me preach it the hurt will not destroy the music [Music] in an orchestra you don't know how bad their days are or whether they're suffering with cancer or they're having marriage problems they're just playing bach or beethoven and doing the best that they know how to do they put themselves aside i need to preach a series on that put yourself aside and serve jesus with everything that's within you [Applause] war is going on in the ukraine it has went on in armenia it's went out on there's about a hundred wars that's going on right now some of them are getting a publicity some are not some of them millions of people have died some of them are publicized beyond being publicized but you are in the target as americans putin is making arrangements he doesn't know it but he's been prophesied to do the job he's he's making arrangements to destroy america and just in case rome europe you're you think that you're you're going to get by making arrangements destroy you two brother man said he'll drop a bomb right down your smokestack i like how accurate god was but because god's made another arrangement with you the believers in ukraine for the most part have made it out they've been having services the presence of the lord has been with them young people's meetings have went on church is going on in the midst of hell on earth [Applause] the wings of god is there to watch over them they're there to watch over you this might not affect nobody but maybe maybe i'll just just preach it to those on the internet there are times you feel like quitting scripture prophet of god said i quit i refuse to preach anymore i'm not going to preach any more god because your word has become a reproach to me people laugh at me and make fun of me they don't want to hear what i got to say i feel rejected so i'm not going to preach anymore and after a while he said oh god your fire is down on the inside of me it's gonna burn me up i gotta go back to the pulpit [Music] another prophet he has a phenomenal meeting 400 prophets are destroyed at that meeting i bet that wasn't politically correct and because one woman threatened him he went and laid under a juniper tree now here's what god will do for you in your night season he don't throw you away he feeds you he sends angels you don't know it because you can't see them he sends angels to watch over you he said i want the angel brother jim bab always loved this part he said i want the angel that cooks the best cakes and he would say brother ron ah sister linda he would tell me this over and over again he said brother ron i wouldn't mind laying under a juniper tree and having an angel cook for me a little while he said i would get i want the angel with the best cakes best cook in heaven to cook elijah some cakes and he would eat them and go back to sleep he was in a spot wasn't it god says i want the angel with the softest hands to come and rub his forehead and massage him god didn't give up on him he didn't say i'm done with him he said i got to take care of my boy i seen him with a tough job i got to take care of him we were talking the other day why would we get so many visitations from angels and i told the brothers i said i'll tell you what i'm kind of sometimes like elijah laying under juniper tree when the battle gets really rough and tough i could feel those angels coming down god's not done with me yet but he has to give me some supernatural strength [Applause] this is just a day this is just a typical day i got up my sugar was over 600 this morning went to bed last night everything was fine got up and it was over 600 took my shots when i was supposed to take my shots my pancreas don't work i go to i go to eat so i throw up i have to walk outside and throw up have a table full of people that i want to talk to and then while i'm putting my clothes on i get to shake so bad i can't even put my own buttons together did i say i want to lay on the couch the rest of the day oh no you've got to have a fight when you're in the night season you got to have some fight on the inside of you because you're born of his bones your life of his life your power of his power these men felt like quitting but there's no quit in us jesus would say it no man having to put his hand to the plow and looking back as even fit for the kingdom of heaven understand this got's bigger than your problems you okay you okay here for a little bit war always rages between the two great kingdoms it always rages peace and good peace and the battle of evil is always against each other it's impossibility to have peace in this sin cursed earth but light is always greater than darkness brother brown would say in shalom that darkness would get darkest just before the breaking of the day and as i heard the other morning god speak to me morning is coming morning is coming morning is coming brother tim called me yesterday evening as i was getting ready he said brother ron when god spoke to you three times that's urgent something's getting ready to happen he said it's a breaking of the day he said we're gonna see some breaking of the day we're gonna see the beacon of light because light is greater than darkness let me can i just interject something right here brother tim and i have not preached the edmonton meetings together ever i preached the edmonton meetings over 20 years at brother harold hildebrandt's brother harold felt led before he passed away that brother tim and myself would preach those meetings in late july just before your meeting the same weekend the pope is going to visit edmonton canada same weekend the prince of darkness is going to be in the same city as two princes of light and if you've been in school at all two is greater than one i wanna i wanna i wanna speak personal to you now about a year ago i had a vision of it being so dark and so dense but it was just before evening you could barely see and people moving and we were standing before great gates some of you have heard me tell this we were standing before great gates and i looked across the gate and this could represent many many hundreds and even thousands of preachers but i was standing on one side and brother temperate was standing on the other side and we were doing our very best to get people through the gate in that darkness and when the gate would open and people would go in we could hear the songs of of angels singing and those bright lights coming out like beams brother tim's church is actually called evening light tabernacle and when i went and saw the beams of light coming out even around the windows it represented it looked like those same kind of beams that were taking place this tabernacle has been called lighthouse and we're sending light into the darkness if we could just think just for a little while we've all got plans to live for years but we have got to come with the realization we got to be ready like never before for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh i said this at dad's friday night and it didn't go it just just was for that local body so i want to say it to where people can hear it putin is doing his best to destroy what he can but he can't destroy america until we're gone because light is greater than darkness and if god has allowed him at this junction to be where he's at that means on the opposite end of the spectrum there's a bride that is in rapturing condition well you say well brother ron i i just don't know i don't know where the message are correct you better figure it out i'm riding the fence you better figure it out your loved ones that's doing everything in the world don't don't have a clue about church on sunday morning you better get it figured out this is more than just a good thing to do [Applause] let me say this in my closing comments this morning resurrection is coming satan can't stop it those that are in the grave is getting ready to come out of the grave the voice of resurrection is in the bride and there's nothing satan can do to stop it the voice of rapture is in the bride and there's nothing satan can do to stop it if i needed the holy ghost there would be nothing to stop it say brother on i need a revival in my life this is a good day don't wait till tomorrow it's a good day to get started you got to start somewhere start today don't put it off till tomorrow start today [Applause] whether on somewhere down the road i want to i want to serve the lord start today but i'll wait till after school look at all the people that you would have witnessed to if you would have started today well brother ron but you know if i wear dresses all the time you know i'll stick out okay gotta have a testimony mary raise your hand gotta have a testimony at eastern mennonite university gotta have a testimony hitting that right sister cassie at jmu and i would get i would get i would get calls i saw cassie at jmu she was one in thousands of girls but she was one in a dress are you with me it lives she wanted to continue her season and track when she became a christian and she said what do i do i said make a dress that don't fly over your head that girl made a dress and she was a pole vaulter and when she was upside down the dress didn't come over her hips this message can be lived anywhere any place anytime brother on but there's things i don't understand hey i am 60 years old there's still things i don't understand but i leave it up to god and god will take care of it [Applause] but somewhere i have to make a decision decisions make you some will take you somewhere brother ron i can't live it not expecting you to but he's going to live it through you he wants to borrow your hands he wants to borrow your eyes he wants to borrow your feet he wants to live on the inside of you this message is more than books and tapes and pictures on the wall and [Applause] god wants to live he's proved himself charlie being born he's proved himself he's proved himself over and over and over again ron but i've watched you i've actually got this text brother ron why do you keep bringing your grandchildren up they were not supposed to be well brother ron i probably could have preached a better sermon this morning you know but i'm just i'm just sitting here you haven't moved me you didn't pray before church you got your lazy self up i'm discerning right now so you just might as well hang in there you've got your lazy self up and barely got your shirt on didn't tuck it in your pants and you criticized me and you ain't want to sow to jesus christ get started started today's your day get started you can be seated just another minute you see that flag i'm still proud of her there's a lot of things about america i'm not proud of i'm really i'm really not proud of but today's not that day to be doing that i'm still proud because i'm free to preach in china you're not free to preach but under those horrible conditions in china they're still having church they stopped their bibles from being printed they stopped all of the things and i can't say what's going on there because they listen to these services but under that darkness they love this message with all their hearts god bless them god bless them god bless them in china if a woman wears a dress she's identified as a prostitute that's their culture but when they hear the message they go out and get a dress like you sister jenny and they put a dress on and they identify themselves as a christian while the world identifies them as harlots more people there than almost any place in the world so you talk about pressure and then they have to watch when they go to church they all can't get there at the same time so one gets there and he starts worshiping and maybe an hour or so later the rest of them start trickling in and they start worshiping and before long the preacher shows up and he starts preaching and he may preach in the middle of the night because that's the only time that they can do it god help us god help us god help us today in the night season let there be light across this building tonight there's there's a lot of widows that are here we have more widows than we have where the world brother medicine's our only way to worry my count is right somebody can tell me different but you see i have to make a choice that sister connie doesn't join the widowers with us i have to fight to live now i'm preaching to you now i've got my heart i've got to fight to live and the fight's worth it [Applause] now you may have to fight to get to church you may have a real struggle and you may be going through what nobody else is going through but to fight is worth it i want to tell you it's worth it let me tell you how worth it it is it may not be for you it may be for your children you might be able to lay home and listen to tapes and you'll be okay but your children won't do that you might be able to lay at home and live stream but your children won't do that they're going to play games they're going to do all different kind of things they're going to have all kind of friends and they're going to be in the darkness it's worth it to fight to get to church [Applause] some of you drive a long way now it's worth it it's worth it some of you that drive five minutes you pray for those that drive four hours four hours and a half it's worth it it's worth it god's bigger than your circumstances he's bigger than your battle he's bigger than your situation no you don't know how to handle it but it's not your battle anyway it's god's battle and if god's got it he'll take care of it all you have to do is be still and know that i am god with our heads bowed just a moment the scripture says and when the enemy shall come in like a flood god will raise up a standard the spirit of the lord shall raise up a standard against it maybe you're just like brother ron allowed my fire to get a little cool and i'd like to i'd like to have a restart i'd like to i don't believe god would be ashamed of me i'd just like to have a restart thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you [Music] circumstances of life and situations will dull the edges of your soul if you're not careful [Music] maybe your spirit's got a little contaminated with life
