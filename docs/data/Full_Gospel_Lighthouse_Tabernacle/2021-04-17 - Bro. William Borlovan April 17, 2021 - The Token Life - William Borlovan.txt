========================================

[Music] some time ago i was reading in a book of a little boss that was entered a contest and in this contest he was to make himself a famous name any little boy who could keep the password in his mind until he got to a certain place and he would speak this password and the gatekeeper would let him through that was to test the iq of the child and when he got to the place speaking the passwords that was given him the gate would open and he would win a great honor [Music] one little boy being very swift-footed and no good and well that he could outrun all the rest of the boys in the contest or he thought he could he practiced day after day of running how he pumped up his little lungs got his physical body and trim so that he wouldn't tire as he run and he practiced how to start with his feet and get a head plunge ahead of the rest of the boys how that he must breathe during the time of his running in order to hold the oxygen that came to his body to keep him pumping off that it wouldn't slow up his heart too much he studied it from every angle that he could and in the morning that the race started there was more than 150 little boys lined up at a certain age this little boy was rather a good-sized boy for his age and he remembered all of his training and he got ready they got on the line popped their little faces against strain that come along push the little nose up against it it studied all the rules of that making himself ready and then when the gun fired and the line was broken the little boy jumped forward and this little guy so physically fit until he jumped way ahead of the rest of him and down the track he went with a terrific speed well trained until he could outrun every boy that was in the race and he was there all quite a long time maybe a minute or more before the best of the other runners ever reached the place but all of his physical training he had forgotten the password he had forgotten the very thing that he was to say to let him in the gate and he paced back and forth and stalled it searched to his mind he had been so interested in the magical natural physical conditions of his body till he had forgotten the main thing on down the line some boys that didn't run so fast remember the password and entered in so is it today we are so interested in building great shrines and churches and buildings and so forth i'm so interested in keeping our churches in good trim with fine buildings and nice plush pews and fine organs our ministers so well trained from they've got dr d l p h d l l d degrees we forgot what we're running for

bless you musicians appreciate y'all amen don't you appreciate wonderful music ministry amen it certainly sets the atmosphere everybody has a job to do amen y'all praising the lord certainly sets a wonderful atmosphere makes it easy to come and the word just go forth to not keep his standing if you will just turn with me to the book of exodus we'll begin reading exodus chapter 12 verse 1. with the help of the lord i'd like to speak this evening on the token life exodus chapter 12 and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking into the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month shall they take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for a house and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next into his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats and he shall keep it unto the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side post and on the upper doorposts of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs shall they eat it eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head and his legs with the proteinants thereof and they shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it unto the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall he eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lord's passover for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be for you a for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt amen god bless you as you're seated this is a very familiar text that we've no doubt read many many times but i would say that it's more important now for us in this end time than it's ever been we live in a very very special age has been many ages where god has dealt with his people and we know the background of the story israel was down in bondage god came to abraham and promised him a seed when he was his seed was dead and told him that his seed was sojourn in the land of egypt for 400 years god is a very faithful god to his word so when the process of time became completed god raised up a prophet in the land and trained him in the desert and this prophet had to forget he was raised to believe and to understand that he was a special child and that he was going to be the deliverer but you know god had to actually take him out into the desert and get all of that intellectual faith out of him god had to train his prophet and the prophet before he could bring a deliverance to his people had to meet god face to face it wasn't enough to hear from his parents what a great god he was and what he did for abraham for isaac for jacob moses had to meet this god for himself and when he had that burning bush experience he was then in a position where god could use him and send him down to deliver his people and we know that god has a way of doing things and many times the world we live in does not like how god does things but if you want to worship god and if you want to please god you've got to come god's provided way and not your provided way or not my provided way god has a provided way and one of them provided ways is god's word comes to a prophet so if a word prophet where he will sin at a given age and the god will speak through that prophet and those that have the ability to hear that prophet or the elect of that age and they ca and they call out an elected people those that have an ear to hear so israel was in bondage for over 400 years and god said that i have come down to deliver my people but then moses walks into egypt moses was god's representation on the earth so when god sent moses he gave him two signs he vindicated him with two signs he vindicated him with a pillar of fire because it was time for israel to become from a nation to a church and we know that a church means to be called out a nation out of a nation israel was a nation down in egypt but once god sent a prophet and called out the people of israel out of egypt they then became the church of god and many of us were either out in the world or out in denominational churches and god sent us a prophet in this third exodus to call us out so god satan challenged god with through pharaoh not wanting to let his people go so god came and vindicated moses message there were 10 different plagues and the last plague the one that we took our text from was a plague of death and if we ever live in a time of spiritual death it is now so what god required then was in type and in shadow god now requires it in reality as the token god requires the token it's not a suggestion it's not a good idea he requires the token and he promised that if you have the token the death angel must pass your house just as it passed their natural houses that they dwelt in it is now promised to pass over you because the death angel is sweeping the land and those without the token will die now the token then was they had to kill the lamb and they had to actually get the blood of the lamb and put it on their physical houses on the doorpost and lentil their doors but the token today is the literal life of jesus christ it is the holy ghost it is the born-again experience and god said jesus when he was on the earth said ye must be born again it is a you must be born again he didn't say you must join a church you must put your name on the book you must live even a good life he said ye must be born again that is a requirement and it is the literal life of jesus christ the blood on the door was then proof that there was a lamb that died for that family it was an evidence and showed that an innocent lamb who did nothing died for you and they were to not only have the lamb and keep it up and god gave them special instructions they had to actually kill the lamb and then they actually had to physically apply the blood of the lamb now the lamb the token had to be applied before the wrath fell it was easy for those in the andalusian world to believe in noah's message once the rain started falling it's going to be easy to believe in the rapture and the prophet's message after there's a catching away of the people it's going to be easy to believe in a resurrection after it already happens it's easy for people to claim jesus now that he's come and gone and he and he sent back the holy ghost but when he was there in flesh they struggled with recognizing the word and flesh and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever people struggle recognizing jesus christ in you they struggle recognizing the bride's presence and authority on the earth but she's here as a witness now the land that could be as perfect as it can be but if that lamb was just tied to the front door the token was not applied if they kill the lamb and they and they got the blood and they put it in a basin right by the door if it wasn't applied the death angel struck their home the blood the lamb had to be taken it had to be killed the blood had to be applied then they had to eat the very lamb that was protecting them from the death angel so the token the holy ghost is what protects us from the death angel in the land and we are to be eating the very lamb the very word that is your protection we are to be eating it while the death angel passes in the land you're safe while there's chaos in egypt you're in goshen with the token applied so the blood cannot just remain at the door it had to be applied it had to prove that there was a living thing that died for you now the token as i said is the literal life of jesus christ that's what the holy ghost did it is not an idea it is not a change of mind it is not a statement of faith it's not a doctrine the holy ghost is literally that life the lord jesus christ from 2000 years ago now living in 2021 that is the holy ghost that is the token and that is the only thing that will protect us in this end time now the letter of this word the bible by itself like this that's not the token people carry this to church every time they go to church and they don't have the token can i say that people carry this to church and won't have the token the token is what brought this the token is what wrote this but just carrying the letters or having it stacked up in our homes we're having pictures on the wall that's not the token the token is the life that sent this that is the token people can read the bible from cover to cover constantly and live like a devil people can listen to tapes or read the same message books you do that changed your life and live like a devil what's the difference they don't have the life that sent it that's what we're preaching to you this evening is that you need the life that sent that you need the same life that wrote the bible you need it in your life to overcome the same way them saints overcame so an intellectual believer can have all the tapes and books and bible and everything else they want if it doesn't live that's not the token it's not the token it is the literal life of jesus christ in you rahab when she was living in jericho she was living in a city that was actually judged already god had already told joshua you kill everyone you kill everything man woman boy girl child baby you kill them all now that can sound harsh in the natural but you have to understand then babies will grow and that is why these little devils that try and creep up they have to be dealt with because little devils grow into big devils little problems grow into big problems that aren't dealt with so you have it's the little foxes that spoil the vine so rahab received receive the spies but that wasn't applying the token yet she believed what the spy said but that wasn't applying the token yet she hid the spies on her roof but that was not applying the token she let them down and let them escape but that was not applying the token yet but when rahab's whose house was on the wall when she let that scarlet cord and she left it out of her window at that time she applied the token because she proved that she believed what the message of the messengers by doing what they said how can you even prove to your spouse that you love them if you don't do what they ask if you don't in humility and and how can y'all even get along how do you how do we prove to our lord or our heavenly husband that we love him if we don't do what he said how do we say that we believe the message if we don't do what the message said now that cannot be done in the flesh it's got to be the holy ghost and you live in it you sisters don't wear your long hair because it's some some grievous commandment you do it to be pleasing unto the lord because you know that's what your husband wants you brothers don't live a clean decent godly life because you're just afraid that your wife will leave you you do it because it pleases the lord and he works all them things out so rahab applied the token by putting the scarlet cord in the window that was the token so whenever the destroying angel came joshua and the army of israel on the walls fell all around them you can imagine the sounds of death all around the screaming the groaning all the sounds but rahab was safe with her family underneath that token if she would have done everything that she did but did not put that cord out she would have died so what do you so what am i saying you can we a person can intellectually believe this message believe god sent a prophet and missed the token that that's what that's what i want to awaken you to that it's possible to intellectually be an intellectual believer and miss the gift giver to miss the life to miss the token we can't do that we have got to possess the token and then the the death angel will pass over us so no matter of all the death that was all around rahab was safe in her home and when it was all said and done her home was the only one that was standing and these services that we come twice a week by god's grace we come here to become more like jesus to get more of his life we don't come here to talk of natural things that's not the that's not that's not the reason that we should be coming here the reason that we should be coming is that when we walk out of them doors we're better than when we came in and the only way is to hear what the spirit of the lord is saying in every service peter in first peter 1 18 for as much as ye know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by the tradition of your elders of your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you you're bought with the price the bible says you're bought with the precious blood of jesus christ not just a natural lamb not just an animal you're bought with literally the blood brother graham called it the blood of god you're bought with a price you're you he paid your ransom satan had us bound in sin and death and unbelief but he paid your ransom brother donnie he paid your ransom so that you could go free because remember the life of the lamb could not justify or come back on the believer but the life of that great lamb of god has come back and that is the token i'm preaching to you about this evening now it's very important because israel in the first exodus was only a type or shadow brother ram called himself a typologist what's very important when you study the scriptures when you're reading the bible when you're you're studying the prophet's message it's very important to rightly divide the shadows and the types because remember those types and shadows don't fail whenever there's a shadow as brother ram described it it gets kind of more it's kind of blurry you can kind of see a picture as it gets closer and closer and then comes from the tight to the anti-type so how much greater was that lamb of god than the land that they killed in egypt so to give you some examples is noah is a type of the bride noah was safe in the ark before the judgment fell the ark is a type of christ amen but because the word is like a diamond when you're over here you see noah being a type of the bride but when you step over here you actually see that enoch is the type of the bride and noah is the type of the church that goes through the tribulation period you understand you see brother brown preached a message about lot he always refers to lot he preached that the bride before the first speck of fire falls we're going to be out of here if you have the token you're going to be out of here it's a guarantee now he gets that type from lot before one bit of fire fell down of fire and brimstone fell on sodom and gomorrah a lot was out so the lot types the bride if you're standing over here but if you move over here on this part of the diamond the lot is actually the carnal believer in sodom and abraham types you who was never down inside them so it's important that you understand where you're looking from brother gabriel it's very important that when you read the word you have an understanding of where you're sitting and how you're reading the word israel was the type of the bride applying the token when you're standing at this angle but when you come over here on this angle you see that israel failed at cades barnea and didn't go on with the word and they died in the wilderness the jews are very proud people of their lineage when jesus was on the earth they were bragging about how their fathers ate man in the wilderness and how they drank from the rock and who are you to tell us is our fathers did this and our fathers did that paul later picks it up and he says more ever moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how all of our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and we're all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat of the same spiritual meat and did all drink of that same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness so the jews loved to brag about their lineage as i said they told jesus our fathers did eat man in the wilderness and jesus admitted your fathers did eat man in the wilderness but they're everyone dead they were spiritually separated from god because they could not go on with the word jesus later breaks it down in that same chapter and he said in saint john 6 53 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him as the living father had sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever so you had a nation of very religious people who were bragging on everything their fathers did and jesus said they ate of that manna but they're dead but they that eat of this manna they'll eat and they'll never die they'll never perish he didn't mean for them to literally cannibalize his body but we're eating his flesh the word and we're drinking his blood the spirit and he promised that he that eateth of that bread will live forever in hebrews 10 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all and every priest standeth ministering and offering often the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of god from henceforth expect until his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he said before this is the covenant that i will make with him after those they sayeth the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more that is the difference between the lamb they did in egypt and our lamb of god ephesians 4 30 said and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of your redemption now when god gives you the holy ghost it's yours for eternity when god gives you the holy ghost it is your inheritance and the holy ghost is given to you by predestination you say what does that mean god knew that you would make it so he don't give you the holy ghost here not that because he's going to lose you there he gives you the holy ghost here knowing that you're going to make it all of the way because it's the holy ghost that makes it all the way not you it's not our flesh that makes anything it's not our flesh that overcomes it's not our flesh that that lives a spiritual life the only reason that any one of us like to be around any one of us is because of him that's the only reason that is the only reason you enjoy being around another person is because of him because of the atmosphere that you may have and we as christians should be like trees planted by the rivers of water rooted and grounded in christ jesus bringing forth fruit his fruit the fruit of jesus christ the fruits of the spirit where people can come on the job and ask you brother jeff i need you to pray for me they may not be a christian but they know that you are so they're going to come to you for prayer why is that they're under your tree and they're refreshing themselves with the fruit so you offer shade you offer goodness and you offer wisdom and you offer testimonies you offer the word you offer comfort to people that don't have it and god puts every single one of you in situations where you can do that nobody goes to lay under a cactus nobody goes to lean over a cactus it's so hot today i need some shade here's a cactus but people can act can be cactuses and even they bloom a couple times a year easter and christmas but where to be fruit trees where to be fruit trees where people can come that don't know jesus christ and be refreshed under your tree they can be refreshing your tree because you're rooted and grounded you're drawing in an area they don't know anything about you're planted by the river of life and you're drawing water and nutrients and you're pushing it out in your fruit and people come and partake of it and if they ask where did you get such a good fruit this fruit is so good where can i get some fruit like that where can i get some shade like that where can i get an atmosphere like that where can i get a marriage like that where can i get a family like that you then are in a position to testify of where you're planted so the holy ghost is given to you based on predestination god knows that you're going to make it and the token when god gives you the token sister carly when god gives you the token it is your receipt and you have proof that you have been bought and paid for and satan can never take you back because you've already been bought and paid for by his precious blood in the old testament the bible said that we're not redeemed by corruptable things they had to redeem one another when they're sold in slavery with silver but now we're redeemed by the precious blood of the lamb the token life of jesus christ we're you're not children you're not redeemed with corruptable things you're not your redemption price is not susceptible to inflation it is bought and paid for and the token that you carry this isn't the receipt paper is this isn't the receipt the paper this isn't just the receipt the paper the receipt is within you the kingdom of god is within you what you read in this then becomes goes into you and then channels itself into your soul and then you live it out and then you're written epistles read and known of all men when this becomes channeled into you then the life that sent this the life that sent this and wrote this it is then being channeled through you that is the token that is the life of jesus christ that is hebrews 13 8. jesus christ has claimed you when you have that token and he gives you that token that is proof that he has claimed you and he's saying you belong to me you don't belong to the devil i came and i bought you with my own blood not the blood of a second person not the blood of a third person not the blood of an angel i paid for it god paid for our salvation and he sent the token back as proof that he paid for it he sent the token as proof that he resurrected so as israel was in goshen while egypt was going on while people were going to their jobs while people were all involved in a tizzy about politics or the world systems and looking for some superman to come maybe worried about who's going to be the next pharaoh god was sent a prophet to israel right there in goshen and while there was darkness all the way around the bible said the darkness could be felt can you feel the darkness out in the world well that darkness is being so dark you can feel it you've got light you're here now enjoying the presence of god you're getting deliverance you're being healed you're being encouraged why because you're in goshen because you heard a prophet because you got the blood to atone for you that is the difference so as the as israel was in goshen we're sitting here and ladies going on all around us but you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus brother graham said and god's provided a place of worship now notice when this great moving power of god comes into a son of god it quickens him the spirit of life enters into him then what does it do it seats them in heavenly places right now not they will be we are now now we've already resurrected the dynamics mechanics has gone to work quickened us and we're quickened up into the presence of god where his spirit is now let me deal with dynamics and mechanics really fast the mechanics is when you know what the word says you have an understanding of what the word says the dynamics is the spirit that makes it move that makes it live now you have people that because god promised that the spirit would fall on the just and the unjust and you have people that can act in the dynamics and they act in the emotion but they don't have the life they can't live the life then you have people that can intellectually they're mental believers and they have an understanding and from a mental perspective of what the word says or what the message says but they can't make it live but when you put the dynamics and the mechanics together that is what moves the church that is what moves the holy ghost to a believer so to go on and now we're seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus in christ jesus sitting in there that's already fired up been raised from the dead we're a part of it if you're a part of the bride you are because the bride is part of the groom you know so we find out it's the same thing and she'll do just exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a lady elsia not by no means a lukewarm but she'll be on fire for god she'll be moving on in the spirit of god the world we live in is insane a child could tell you that they try and normalize i told my our kids i said they try and make blue hair and green hair and purple hair and rainbow hair and unicorn hair and glitter hair they try and make it normal it's not normal it's satanic it's satanic influence that's causing that it's not normal but what what is the enemy doing trying to desensitize us and our children to the world never be desensitized from the world let it shock you every time let it be weird every time i'm not that old but when i was a teenager when we seen somebody like that in walmart i not only was looking but so was everyone else around now nobody seems to pay much mind maybe they're afraid to i don't know but never lose the never lose your sensitivity to wrong always keep your guard up always discern right from wrong every every little commercial you see every every ad you may see on the internet keep your guard up to say that's wrong that's the enemy being sneaky because when the enemy is sneaky here all of a sudden you accept that and then he gets a little sneakier and he gets a little sneakier and he gets a little sneakier and then one day you'll realize you slid from way over there discern the enemy and his tactics recognize the enemy and his tactics recognize the enemy trying to come into your home recognize the enemy trying to come into your marriage recognize the enemy study his tactics recognize that enemy because he's very slick he's very slick we have to be careful what we listen to we have to be careful what we watch there was a testimony i don't remember exactly where but where this one young lady had an awful problem i'd been with nervousness it was something i don't recall exactly and brother brand the prophet of god prayed for her and when he prayed for her he seen an evil spirit in the shape like a buffalo raised up out of her the cause of that was because when she was a child she seen a documentary on the holocaust and seeing that documentary remember the eyes of the channel to the soul so seeing that that documentary about the holocaust affected this little girl so bad as a child a spirit entered into her and caused her problems her whole life we have to be careful very careful what we watch we have to be very careful what we let our children watch we have to be very careful because satan is slick and if he can't get to you he'll try and get to your wife or try and get to your family he'll try and get your children we have to be on guard now god has a chosen place of worship and as i said earlier people always want to do things their way they always have a problem with god saying this is the way i want it and if you want to be accepted you've got to come this way now you'll have one side you know the truth is always in the middle you'll have one side that'll say there's many ways to heaven coexist with all the other religions there's so many ways to new york you just come in way whatever suits you that's a lie of the devil then you have on this other side of the extreme spectrum you have you'll take just a random church out in the city and you'll say if they'll believe if they don't believe like exactly like me if they don't have their name on our church book if they don't belong to our denomination you're lost you've got no chance this is the only way but my bible tells me that he said he was the only way and he is the word so it's not if you don't believe like me if you don't believe like brother andrew if you don't believe your co-worker you don't we have to believe like he believes and this is what god believes because do you know who the first believer was god he believed his own word when he said let there be light god believed brother braham said his own word and it brought to pass exactly what he believed so in order for you so i'll put it like this in order for you to get to heaven you've got to believe like god believes it's not because i believe it or because this single church believes it you have to believe what he believes how what does god believe right here you want to know what god believes right here and jesus christ is the only way to heaven jesus christ the word he is the word it is he is the only way because there's a right way and there's the wrong way and the token the token that we're preaching of can only be applied in god's chosen place of worship now i'm going to say that again the token can only be applied in god's chosen place of worship god's chosen place of worship is jesus christ that is the only place to get the holy ghost you cannot get it any other place jesus said in matthew 15 9 think of this he says but in vain they do worship me this is god himself saying in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrine the commandments of men you mean to say that there's actual churches and there's big programs and there's big rope choirs and there's this and there's that and all that is for vain all that does no good that's what he said in vain they do worship me why do they worship me in vain because they're not coming god's provided way god has a provided way and they want their own provided way when he met the woman at the well he said but the hour cometh and now is when true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him god seeks for true worship because we're about to get into something but god will reject false worship god won't receive it if you want to be received of god you've got to come god's provided way and god's provided way is the holy ghost is the new birth is the token it's all the same thing jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me satan hates that scripture because if satan can just get the waters muddy if he can just get the way that's just any which way will work whatever you feel you only live once whatever the spirit of the age is that's what satan wants to do you know today i believe they had was is it prince philip the one that just died they had his funeral today and they had massive pomp and soldiers and all these things but god is a judge but where he is now i don't know and i'm not i can't say but to make a point where he is now that don't matter all of his accomplishments and all of his titles and all of the pomp don't mean nothing now he's an individual before god every president of the united states every king every monarch every dictator every emperor that ever died they are a soul before god that must answer for the works that they've done and how they treated this word they've got to answer for that so let's not kid ourselves we will be required to answer if we don't apply this token if we have been in service after service after service god coming down and his service at the service vindicating and confirming himself confirming his presence among us where will we be in that day saints we'll have to give a reason now in the book of genesis which is the c chapter cain and abel both worship we're talking about god's chosen place of worship and we have to understand that cain naturally speaking he might have been an okay kind of guy he went to church he paid his tithes he was sincere and he worshipped the same god that abel did understand now cain did not worship some pagan false god cain brought his sacrifice to the same god that abel did but abel came god's provided way brother branham says now those boys after seeing that they had been made mortal and was going to die they tried to find favor with god and they both come making a sacrifice i'll review a certain thing here i said last night if god only required religion if that's all he required then cain was justified think about that if all god requires brother jim is church attendance paying your tithes and being a good neighbor and being nice to people cain should not have been rejected but god requires more now it's nothing that we can bring it's what he's done but you have to understand we have to understand that it's our faith and what he's done that justifies you he said but cain's sacrifice cain comes believing just the same as abel did cain come with the sacrifice just the same as abel came with the sacrifice but cain's sacrifice was by works he raised the garden brought his fruits the best he could find by works but abel was justified by faith he come with a lamb now cain they were they both they were under sin their parents sold out the entire human race to sin so they were under sin and they knew that they had to get back in fellowship with god so they come and they want they want to do it they want to make a sacrifice and cain no doubt gave it a lot of thought how can i please god what can and i want you to notice that his reasoning what can i do that god will accept what can i do what how can i work how can i put in them extra hours in my garden how can i work extra hard and make sure i fertilize these these fruits and vegetables more than i ever have and get everything absolutely perfect because you know i want the best for my for the lord so what can i do so cain worked all year in his garden and he told and abel was probably under there under the tree maybe praying maybe sleeping i don't know but cain was over there working in his garden and he was doing everything he could and he was using the sweat of his brow and he was trying to prune everything just so nicely to bring it to god to bring it so he can worship god so the the process of time came and cain thought it out as as well as he could to build that altar just as beautiful as he can and set flowers here and set this over here maybe it wasn't just right maybe turn it a little bit toward the sun and make the sun come right through here and shine real nice and bring these fruits and polish them out a speck of dirt on there the most perfect fruit you've ever seen delicious fruit wonderful fruit and he's setting all this up and he's getting ready to offer it to god and he looks over and he sees abel his brother who evidently to cain didn't put no effort dragging a lamb to a rock all that work king did all that time he put into his garden all that knowledge that went into cultivation all that time that went into decorating this beautiful altar for the lord and what can abel is he's going to get turned down sure is the world how is god going to accept that how is god going to accept a lamb how is god going to accept some some stinking lamb his altar is a big rock somewhere how primitive wait till god sees what i did wait till he sees what i did so he sets everything up and when god comes down he leaves cain's sacrifice sitting right there because cain brought fruit and botany life there's no redemption in botany life adam and eve try to hide behind fig leaves they had to hide they hid behind botany life and god could see right through their their religion because remember religion is a covering we don't want to be religious i don't like being called oh he's religious i want to be a christian i want to be a holy ghost-filled believer not religious the devil is religious cain was religious the sadducees were religious judas is a carrot was religious we don't want to be religious we want to have the token we want to have the life there's no redemption in botany life there's only redemption in blood when adam and eve sew that fig leaf god had to kill an innocent lamb that innocent lamb sister stephanie didn't do a thing that innocent lamb didn't fall adam and eve fell but god killed that lamb as an innocent substitute for them abel offered unto god paul said a more excellent sacrifice than cain did he brought the lamb because abel knew that without a sacrifice he was helpless abel understood that without blood being shed there was no forgiveness there was no covering for sins abel no doubt watched his flock and when he knew that time of sacrifice was coming he was watching his flocks because he was a shepherd and he was watching his flocks and he was looking for that perfect lamb because remember all the way down in egypt god told them it had to be a perfect lamb and we need to give god our best our best time our best ability our best strength we need to give him our best so abel was watching which lamb if maybe he was watching a certain lamb and then maybe kind of maybe stepped in a hole maybe kind of broke his foot nope that one that one's not gonna work i gotta find a perfect lamb so he found this lamb he found this lamb and and he prophet of god said that he typed he he tied a grapevine around it around its neck so cain was sitting there and had everything so polished and right when he thought that everything was so perfect and so right and god was getting ready to come and just consume his sacrifice he looks over and he sees abel as i said walk on that lamb so what's able doing what is able going to do with that lamb with that stinking lamb what what's he gonna do so abel drags that lamb he carries that lamb and he lays it down on that rock on that big rock that he made as an altar and cain and cain is watching and abel reaches down he grabs a sharp rock and he starts hacking he starts hacking he starts hacking at the neck of that lamb blood starts going everywhere blood gets on the rock blood gets on the lamb blood gets on him it's a mess but god said that's exactly what i'm thinking the prophet of god said that he came down and consumed his sacrifice with that pillar of fire and left abel's or left canes rather just sitting there all that work all that time in his garden all that works that he did god i did this for you and i did this and i did this there's nothing you can do to merit salvation you can only look to the lamb and the new birth just like abel's sacrifice was was a mess the new birth is a mess but do you know what it's a requirement people think they can just come shake the preacher's hand or come up with a dried-out confession or do or just attend church for years and years and years and put their name on a book and think they're going to heaven that's an idea from cain you need to have a messy birth that's what it takes and abel had to die on that same rock that that lamb died he died because whenever cain looked and seen that god he seen god condescend in the pillar of fire and consume able sacrifice and left mine sitting here and cain got jealous and cain got so angry and such jealousy rose up within him that he killed abel on the same rock as his lamb abel's revelation cost him his life abel's understanding because what abel displayed in time god had already had already thought of in eternity jesus christ was the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world that was already taken before time started before the fall god had already in his mind knew what he was going to do he already knew that you would need a redeemer that i would need a redeemer before adam and eve ever sold us out that's the kind of god we serve he knows exactly what situation you're in right now before time ever started that's the god that we serve so we must die to ourselves on the same rock that jesus christ died on he died on mount calvary we've got to be he already took our penalty but we've got to die out to ourselves to be born again how did cain when he made an altar just as pretty or prettier than abel's he offered fruits he gave his tithes he brought his income into the house of the lord he knelt on the altar he bowed himself he prayed he worshipped just as sincere as any man but god vindicated abel by consuming his sacrifice remember on mount carmel when elijah had a showdown within pagan priests and he said let the god that answers by fire be god and when he laid everything out and elijah called on the spirit of the lord the pillar of the fire fell down from heaven and consumed everything the water and everything if you say you're a believer god vindicates it you don't have to presume anything it's god consume you don't have to presume that's right the brass altar consumed the sacrifice if the sacrifice laid upon the altar and it was not consumed god refused it see it's consuming and you are god's sacrifice lay yourself upon the altar say god just take it all out of me empty up so you can fill me up use me he said that's right don't presume it believe it yes sir if you don't believe it you god won't receive your sacrifice we have to lay ourselves completely broken completely empty completely know that we have nothing to bring to god nothing nothing as the song says nothing in my arms i bring simply to thy cross i clean once god fills you he can then use you but you have to empty yourself out and god proves his word how does god prove his word by vindicating it now the word vindicate we talk a lot about a vindicated message in this end time god vindicated this message now the word vindicated it means to free from allegation or blame to provide justification or defense for justify see whenever you you are so broken and you come to god and he sends you're so broken god receives your sacrifice of brokenness of a surrendered heart that he then vindicates you he justifies you and he fills you with the holy ghost another definition of vindicate is to confirm or substantiate how many times would the prophet of god preach about abraham and sarah the woman at the well nathaniel and philip and all these different things he would preach about it and then god would come down and do the exact same thing that was god vindicating his word but don't just look from 50 years ago even look now the minister will be preaching the word and then god comes behind it with an amen and vindicates it if you can believe it now just as abel when he when he drug that land we can't just bring the things of the world to the altar we can't just bring our own ideas our own intellectual faith and things we've got to bring a complete surrendered heart and when god sees that just like the pillar of fire fell and consumed abel's sacrifice god will come down and consume your sacrifice with the token he'll consume your sacrifice with the holy ghost because remember the token is only given in god's chosen place of worship in hebrews 12 24 into jesus the mediator of the new covenant into the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel because when cain killed abel abel's blood god said cried to him from the ground and we find that whenever whenever you look over in the book of revelations you have the souls under the altar crying unto the lord lord how long until you avenge us until you avenge our blood let him say that was the jews there but when we have a blood that speaketh better things than that of abel when he was on the cross what did he say he didn't say avenge he said forgive them father for they know not what they do the blood of jesus christ speaks better things than that of abel so what does the blood of jesus speak if the blood of jesus speaks better things than that of abel what does the blood of jesus speak he speaks forgiveness he speaks salvation he speaks healing he speaks the holy ghost this is what the blood of jesus christ is speaking right here but we have to have an ear to hear we must please god we must come god's provided way god's chosen place of worship you've got to please god you know you cannot please god with the word of a day gone by you cannot sit here and please god by saying lord a flood's coming and let's build an ark upon this hill because a flood's going to come and and we're going to get in this thing and we're going to float over it that word's already been fulfilled you say well that sounds silly well do you know that the whole reason that we have denominations is because that they camped around a truth that god had sent at one day and when god moved beyond that they couldn't move with it that is how denominations came to be so why hasn't there been you've had charismatic come forth after the pentecostals but why hasn't there been a major denomination come after the pentecostals it's because we're in seed again you can't denominate the truth you can't denominate the whole truth you can't do it so what went in the ground is now up top again it's in the fruit that's why there hasn't been a denomination like i said there's been charismatics they've been offshoots and all these different things have been going on but the pentecostal was the last move of god that denominated so the bleeding word we need this token we need the literal life of jesus christ that is the only way to overcome brother graham said think your garments washed by the water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in the bleeding word the word bleeding he was the word bleeding on the cross for you he was the word made manifest and he died so that he can send his token back to you by the baptism of the holy ghost and so that the death angel can pass over you do do we have to understand that whenever the bible says that when satan comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises a standard against it do you realize that you as the bride is the standard that's raised in this age do you realize that hell has literally come up and has incarnated itself in the people just like heaven has come the word and has incarnated itself in an end-time people it's the conflict between god and satan and it's in flesh satan will get in flesh and possess people and cause them to do evil things but god is possessing abroad in this end time and she's going to do exactly what he wants done with the word now we'll try and bring it to a wrap here but let me just read this and i see shall possess the gate of the enemy now if you say oh i'm a believer and god has never given you the holy ghost yet he's never recognized it you're just confessing what you believe i'm not saying you're not a believer now in a certain portion you are a believer but when god has found favor you found favor with him rather and he recognizes you to be his child he knows your heart he and he sees your sincerity he knows all things are cut away from you then he seals you into the kingdom of god by the holy ghost proving to the world that he has accepted what faith you profess to have in him whenever you believe god you say how the token you've been preaching for an hour or more on what that on the token we need the token how do i get this token you obey the full word problem said that the full obedience to the word entitles you to the token so what exactly does that mean you begin the word says to repent that's the word you say well okay i've repented now the word says and be baptized in the name of jesus christ well i don't believe that jesus said father son and holy ghost and he's more important than peter so i'm going to take what jesus said and i'm going to be baptizing titles well you broke the word right there you can't get the token because you haven't come to full obedience to the word yet but then whenever you repent and then you are are baptized in spiritual and true christian baptism the the such a powerful revelation saints is that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new the name of the father son and holy ghost is the lord jesus christ you're obeying the word you're you're you're fully obeying the word so you repent and then you're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you're coming on up now then you become a candidate for the holy ghost then you have to keep believing you got to keep pressing you got to you got to keep pressing and keep believing and trusting god and then when god sees your faith as his quote said he sees your faith he sees your sincerity and when he accepts your faith just like he accepted abel's sacrifice then the fire comes down and consumes you then the holy ghost and fire comes down and consumes your life then try and put it out you can't you can't right after brother man preached a token he preached desperations that would be a really good sermon for y'all to listen to desperations to get to god no matter what you say i've had the holy ghost now for years get more of god get more get a refilling get to you know brother andrew's been preaching so wonderfully on surrender a full surrender let's surrender more than we ever have before let's give him more than we ever have if we've been holding anything back let's give it to him let's give it to him god will come down and consume that portion of your life so he in in that summer the desperations he's talking about the message of the sermon that he just preached that morning called the token and he said of all the sermons this morning the message this morning to me was the highlight certain message of my entire ministry this morning see a highlight message of my entire ministry you say what about all the healings all the deliverance all the mysteries what about the seals the trump is about all these things if you follow that and you don't have the token it don't do you any good the reason it's all summed up in the token is because the token is the life of jesus christ and the token is your guarantee that you're going in the rapture it is your proof of purchase that he purchased you he's accepted your faith you please him he loves you he's gonna come get you that is your proof and if you don't have the token seek him with all your heart you've got to apply the token the bible talks about a famine that's coming and is here and it's not the famine for the for the bread or water but it's a famine for the truth bible said they'll go to and fro and seek the truth and can't find it so how much more will god hold us responsible when the truth is preached here each and every service and if we don't take it and apply it to our lives because we want reality saints i i don't have a nickel's worth of time for just religion and form i want reality i want a god that lives i want a god that delivers i want a god that heals i want a god that saves i want a god that can take me out of here and you say well what about i've got i've got loved ones i've got children i've got i'm worried about them prophet i said apply the token once you have the token you can then apply the token for your parents for your family for your children for grandma for grandpa for whoever you apply the token and you commit them to god don't let their lack of servitude hinder you but you put them into god's hands you apply the token and say lord i'm claiming them i've got the token brother ram said that when we pray you've got you show the token say lord here's the token i'm praying i'm showing the token i need this and when you paid for my salvation when you sent gave me the holy ghost everything i have need of in this journey including the rapture is in the holy ghost and i'm going out for my loved one and i'm holding the token for my wayward children don't ever give up on anybody don't no matter how bad it looks and no matter how bad it seems don't ever give up on anyone because many of you might have been given up on but look look what god has done for you don't ever give up on anyone because remember during that drought when you had a widow woman which types you accepted the word of the lord through elijah the bible said even though drought and famine and starvation was going on all around them she and her son and the prophet ate many days and we have spiritual food in due season it's been stored up one more notice they were just not yet to come together to talk about the message and that's what i was meaning earlier when we come to church we don't just want to talk about the message like you may talk about you know your natural passions your i love to hunt or i love to fish or i love to go shopping you sisters or i love to decorate all that has got its place and it's fine but whenever we come to church we don't just talk about the message like we talk about the natural things we come to become we come here to become one so that whenever we leave more of this word has had an effect on our lives and maybe our hearts were pricked maybe we were healed maybe god spoke to us maybe god encouraged us maybe god delivered us maybe god gave you the holy ghost that is why we come they come together to apply the blood to apply the token that's what you must do pastor neville into this congregation trust these deacons and to your brethren it's time that we laid aside all the foolishness of the world time we laid aside everything else we've seen enough now until we are positive sure and the token must be applied without it you're going to perish you must perish that's the only thing oh don't come together say i believe it get beneath it get into it and the bible says that by one spirit we're all baptized into one body that's how you get into it that is how you get in the message when the messenger that's jesus christ gets in you because when you're in christ there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus and you get in christ jesus by one spirit let's stand you get into him by one spirit so remember the token is an absolute requirement we must have the life of jesus christ it's the life of jesus christ that is in us that conquers self sin and satan you you're saying for him are you saying that i've got to conquer myself that's your biggest enemy right there that is the hardest one to conquer sometimes it seems like yourself but the token life of jesus christ enables you to do that the token life of jesus christ will give you overcoming power it'll cause you to look at the right things and turn your heads from the wrong things it will cause the word live through you it will cause the very word that was been promised so if we've been promised a rapture if we've been promised a resurrection if we've been promised that body change if we've been promised healing if we've been promised this after that after that it's the holy ghost that's in us that brings the word to pass and when we surrender ourselves fully and completely and we bring we come and we come and we lay ourselves on and i'm not necessarily talking about the altar trying to make an altar call i'm talking about the altar of your heart get laying yourself out before the lord abel knew that he needed that lamb and it so pleased god that it typed jesus christ it's so pleased god when he was leading that lamb up to that altar god could see himself going up to mount calvary thousands of years later being led and being hacked to pieces they beat him till he was unrecognizable blood was going everywhere it was uh if you'll forgive the expression it was an ugly scene it was a very gruesome scene but it was one of the most beautiful pictures and it was the most beautiful picture in the entire bible it looked like the greatest defeat and it was the greatest victory amen let's put our heads in our hearts the gracious heavenly father we thank you so much lord for this opportunity lord that we can come into your presence and father god lord as we just lord just go and and think about the words that were said father may you just help us help us lord jesus to make such a full surrender to you lord lord may we not try and bring our own works or our own religion our own ideas our own intellectual but lord just to simply lay ourselves down father to just simply be broken father that's what you're looking for is a broken heart that you can come and you can feel father may you help us more to die more to ourselves today to maybe even die right now to things that we've been holding on to to maybe die to that little petty idea maybe a petty grudge or whatever it may be lord help us to die to it right now father that when we go out them doors lord that token life of jesus christ that was shed some 2000 years ago but lord it's not the chemistry it's the life and that life is just as alive and well as ever before and lord we plead that blood of jesus christ that life of jesus christ that was so perfect that was so wonderful that was so spotless and you struck it like that masterpiece lord you struck it it was so perfect it was that spotless lamb and you had egypt generation after generation after generation observe the passover and when you came the great passover lamb they were supposed to accept you they were supposed to receive but oh god they crucified you they spit upon you they slapped you they mocked you oh great lamb of god the lord these things were in your predestinated plan because you had a gentile bride lord that was him them jews lord you blinded your own children so that we can be here right now father and lord we surrender our lives to you we give ourselves to you we ask that you forgive us of our sins may the word circumcise the world off of us father and lord may not a single person under the sound of my voice father lord may they not be out from underneath that token lord if they have the token i pray you bless them i pray you strengthen them lord give them a refilling and a re-baptism of the holy ghost but lord if they don't may they come into full obedience of the word and may the spirit even go out even now and begin to work on their hearts begin to work on their conscience begin to to deal with them even now to where they will not rest day or night until they get this token because the death angel is passing there's death all around us but lord you promised that when i see the blood i will pass over you father how we can how we love you we thank you we worship with all of our hearts we ask now your blessings over each one lord we commit our lives to you we love you lord in the name of jesus christ we pray ask all these things amen amen god bless you saints i just play those prayers blood stains will i claim the blood that jesus shared oh those precious they were made there just for me for all my sickness and my pain oh when i need healing i just claim those precious oh i clay the blood that jesus share on calvary [Music] were made their oh my sickness and my pain oh when i need healing i claim those precious blood stains aren't you thankful for a token message that he is everything that you have need of was laid in that life aren't you thankful as the prophet would say it's the highlight of my ministry the token it's the
