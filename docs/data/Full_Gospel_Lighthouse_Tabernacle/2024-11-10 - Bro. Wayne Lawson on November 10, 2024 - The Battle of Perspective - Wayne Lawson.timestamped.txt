[45:34] preacher to know just give him right
[45:37] away amen just just let him take his way
[45:41] amen uh and we want to if we can the
[45:44] book of Corinthians the 2D chapter the
[45:45] 14th verse
[45:57] and I want to read here second uh 1
[45:59] Corinthians 2:14 I'll also read Hebrews
[46:02] 5
[46:03] and14 but the natural man receiveth not
[46:06] the things of the spirit of God for they
[46:09] have foolishness unto
[46:11] him and neither can he know them because
[46:15] they are spiritually discerned in
[46:18] Hebrews chapter 5 and verse1
[46:22] 14 but strong meat belongeth to them
[46:26] that are are of full
[46:28] age even those who by reason of use have
[46:33] their senses exercised to discern both
[46:37] good and evil may God bless his word
[46:40] this morning as you may be seated uh I
[46:44] want to want to speak to you um uh on
[46:47] this subject um it's something that's
[46:49] just been strong on my heart I I really
[46:51] wasn't planning to go this direction
[46:52] this weekend but the Holy Spirit like I
[46:54] said just really spoke to me this
[46:56] morning
[46:57] and I want to uh I want to just open uh
[47:00] my heart to this amen uh I want to talk
[47:02] to you about the Battle of perspective
[47:05] about the Battle of perspective here
[47:08] from the scripture of course Paul is
[47:11] using the word discernment and of course
[47:13] we recognize that that is a speaking of
[47:17] perspective it's a if you take the
[47:19] English word perspective it's just a way
[47:21] of thinking or understanding something
[47:24] uh such as any particular issue like you
[47:26] when you view something that is the way
[47:29] you view it that is your perspective of
[47:31] it and and of course that's exactly
[47:33] where the real battles are happening
[47:35] today is the battle it's in perspective
[47:38] it's how people view things cuz you can
[47:40] take something and two people see the
[47:42] same thing but they see it differently
[47:44] and then one sees it his way and he says
[47:46] that's right and the other one sees it
[47:48] his way and that's right but now there
[47:49] is a a right way to look at everything
[47:52] and that's God's way amen I I was just
[47:55] studying a little bit on truth and and I
[47:57] I come across a couple terms and maybe
[47:59] I'll preach about them later I I was
[48:00] going to talk about them a bit this
[48:01] morning but uh but there's truth is is
[48:04] that there is actually two kinds of
[48:06] truth there's actually objective truth
[48:08] and and then there's subjective truth
[48:10] and those two kinds of truths meaning uh
[48:12] that if you uh hold up this Bible uh an
[48:15] objective truth is this is the Bible
[48:18] it's an object so you you look at it
[48:20] it's an object so whether you think it's
[48:22] a Bible or not doesn't change the object
[48:25] it still remains to be a Bible and
[48:27] that's an objective truth but then
[48:29] subjective truths what you see it as how
[48:32] you think about it and you can say well
[48:33] that's just a book or it's this or that
[48:35] but it wouldn't change what it is and so
[48:37] is it when you start looking at the at
[48:40] the things of the Lord amen people can
[48:42] look at them and they can try to think
[48:44] that because they say it is a certain
[48:46] thing makes it that but that's not it at
[48:49] all that the word of God is true amen
[48:51] and his ways are true and and it doesn't
[48:54] matter how someone views it it just
[48:56] remains to be true amen it's kind of
[48:58] kind of like one time somebody was
[49:01] saying about brother brandom they said
[49:02] well you're trying uh you're trying to
[49:04] act like uh you you you make brother
[49:05] brandom a prophet I said oh no I said no
[49:08] that's not it at all they thought they
[49:09] had won the argument with me cuz I I
[49:11] said no I'm not trying to make him be a
[49:13] prophet and they said oh okay well
[49:14] that's better I said I'm not trying to
[49:15] make him a prophet he is a prophet amen
[49:18] I'm just trying to determine and say
[49:20] what God did it it it I just have
[49:22] aligned my perspective with the Lord
[49:24] amen and he has an objective TR truth
[49:27] and that objective truth of course amen
[49:29] I I find that human beings sometimes uh
[49:32] they have a little bit of a they have a
[49:34] little bit of a trouble even so much
[49:36] more humans than animals Amen in having
[49:39] real discernment it's an odd thing
[49:41] because you know God gives animals
[49:43] discernment you know when you look at
[49:44] the animals of the field brother BR
[49:46] talks about how that the birds knew to
[49:48] get out of the walls of the of the rock
[49:50] walls and how that he said that just
[49:53] before an earthquake he said the fish
[49:54] will quit biting and the and the cows
[49:56] and move out in the middle of the field
[49:58] because they have a discernment they
[50:00] they know they can be able to perceive
[50:02] something the the fish have discernment
[50:04] now you how many how many uh bow Hunters
[50:08] we got in here this morning white tail
[50:10] deer hunters and amen you all know them
[50:12] big bucks has got some discernment cuz
[50:13] you know they didn't smell you and they
[50:16] didn't see you but something happened he
[50:18] just I've had it happen that big old
[50:20] bucks walking down that trail and he
[50:22] just turns and goes that way and you why
[50:24] did he do that amen but it was just
[50:26] something in his senses told him that
[50:29] danger is there and he didn't reason it
[50:32] out he didn't think it out he just turn
[50:34] left you know amen because animals are
[50:37] more apt to follow that their god-given
[50:40] deser it amen it's a perception that's
[50:43] exactly how that the Ducks get from the
[50:45] north to the South they just follow the
[50:47] Instinct that God give them they don't
[50:49] reason it out they just do what is
[50:51] normal what is natural that that
[50:53] discernment comes to them and it's a
[50:55] god-given instin in now now we have seen
[50:58] it in the scripture that even even in
[51:00] the Bible it was y'all remember that
[51:01] story of balam and his mule what a story
[51:05] amen what a story about a guy that
[51:07] riding a mule and he's trying to use his
[51:10] poor old mule he's wrote it to the store
[51:12] and he's rode this thing for a lot of
[51:14] things but this time he's doing it on a
[51:17] mission to curse God's people because
[51:19] Bayo decided he wanted to curse God's
[51:21] people and and and he got on his own
[51:23] mule and took off riding and and the
[51:25] Bible records three different times that
[51:28] the mule stopped and the last time of
[51:30] course then balum got off and he was
[51:32] going to kill the poor mule and the mule
[51:34] just started talking wouldn't that have
[51:35] been a morning amen he said hadn't I
[51:37] been your mule for years and and I've
[51:39] never done this before amen and all of a
[51:42] sudden bam turns around and looks and
[51:43] the angel of the Lord is standing there
[51:45] see that animal could see the angel of
[51:47] the Lord amen when sometimes men can't
[51:50] amen now just because you can't see
[51:52] something don't mean it ain't there amen
[51:54] I can show you that over and over over
[51:56] and over again just because one person
[51:59] don't see it don't mean that it ain't
[52:01] there it's just like when Paul was on
[52:03] the road to Damascus and The Light Came
[52:05] amen he was the one that seen the light
[52:07] and heard the voice amen so you got to
[52:09] you got to see that animals sometimes
[52:11] are aware of things that even humans
[52:13] aren't aware of but then God brought him
[52:16] in amen and showed balum what it was
[52:18] that the mule was seeing and and
[52:20] remember that balum finally said he said
[52:22] well Lord if I had knew that you was
[52:24] against what I was doing the Way You Are
[52:26] I would stop my going and the Lord said
[52:28] no you go on and do it he said but don't
[52:30] you say anything but what I have put in
[52:32] your mouth so bam went on down there now
[52:35] how many realize this balam was a
[52:37] hireling hired by Bao to curse God's
[52:39] children and if you know who Bic was he
[52:42] was the king of the Moab people who the
[52:45] moabs were uh one of I think it was the
[52:48] oldest daughter of lot had a son named
[52:51] Moab and that became the country of Moab
[52:53] and Bayo was the king of that country
[52:56] amen so so they were kin folk and and
[52:59] and they were they were boy don't you
[53:00] love kin folk and they were kin folk to
[53:03] Israel amen but they didn't want to see
[53:05] amen Israel go into that kind of Revival
[53:08] so what they thought they could do is
[53:10] they could get a preacher that didn't
[53:11] like Revival and didn't like Israel and
[53:14] we'll give him a little money and he'll
[53:15] say whatever we want him to say because
[53:18] they knew they couldn't defeat Israel
[53:20] without some help somehow so they hired
[53:23] Bao and they bam and they brought him
[53:24] out there and then bam went out there
[53:26] and remember he went to the fundamental
[53:28] Altar and he built altars and put seven
[53:30] altars and seven lambs and he was a
[53:32] fundamental preacher he fundamentally
[53:35] went to the right altar amen and the
[53:37] prophet of God said while he was at that
[53:39] altar he began to pray and then the
[53:41] scriptures tells us that they took him
[53:43] to a high place so he could see Israel
[53:46] and while he looked upon Israel he saw
[53:49] them amen and Bayo was pointing out all
[53:52] the problems that was going on in the
[53:53] camp amen and Bayo thought for sure if I
[53:56] show him these things he would surely be
[53:59] able to curse his people amen and balam
[54:01] comes back to him and he says listen he
[54:03] said amen I went up into the high place
[54:06] he said and God said he said to him how
[54:08] shall I curse whom God hath not cursed
[54:11] or how shall I defy whom the Lord hath
[54:14] not
[54:15] defied amen and the Lord said from the
[54:18] top of the Rocks I see them and from the
[54:21] hills I behold them and the people shall
[54:23] dwell alone and they shall not be
[54:25] reckoned among the nation s who can
[54:27] count the dust of Jacob or the number of
[54:29] the fourth part of Israel let me die the
[54:31] death of the righteous and let me last
[54:33] the end be like this now balum was
[54:36] trying to actually curse the children of
[54:39] Israel but he was doing it from the
[54:41] perspective of Bao because baleo saw the
[54:45] church one way and God saw it another
[54:48] way amen and you see this brother B said
[54:50] what it is when balum looked at the
[54:52] church he didn't see the smitten Rock
[54:55] bam didn't see the Tabernacle he seen
[54:58] the tents but he missed one good tent he
[55:00] missed that one in the middle he missed
[55:02] that tent that had that pillar of smoke
[55:05] over it and that was in the center he
[55:07] was the wheel in the middle of the wheel
[55:09] bam missed that one amen and we say
[55:12] brother man said what he tried to do was
[55:14] he tried to judge Israel from a moral
[55:18] standpoint and wouldn't you think you
[55:20] could judge people that way from a moral
[55:22] standpoint amen but you know what when
[55:24] you're dealing with the children of God
[55:25] you can't can't judge him like that amen
[55:28] because because the prophet of God said
[55:29] he see he failed to see the higher
[55:32] calling of God Amen by grace and by
[55:35] election and they were in that line with
[55:37] God's word and when we wanted to curse
[55:40] them God said don't you do it they mind
[55:42] you leave them alone don't you touch
[55:45] them amen I think it's powerful today
[55:47] that God Amen can bless a people amen
[55:51] and no matter what you do you can't
[55:52] curse those people that God blesses amen
[55:55] I thank God for that kind of blessing in
[55:57] the Book of Genesis the 14th chapter
[55:59] amen it's there where Abraham is the one
[56:02] that receives this blessing originally
[56:04] amen when Abraham is on his way after
[56:07] helping his brother the Bible said MDC
[56:10] came unto him and blessed him and said
[56:12] Blessed Be Abraham amen of the most high
[56:15] God now you know that's the Greek the
[56:18] Hebrew which is the name of God Elon
[56:21] which means the most high God so he was
[56:23] blessed of the most high God so if
[56:26] you're blessed of the most high God who
[56:29] is it that can curse you when the God of
[56:32] all gods has blessed you amen I tell you
[56:36] what a blessing this morning to know
[56:38] amen that the blessing through Abraham's
[56:40] seed amen was a blessing that God put
[56:42] upon them and no matter how others view
[56:45] them God blessed them anyhow because you
[56:48] cannot curse what God has blessed look
[56:52] at this in the in the Book of Numbers
[56:53] the 22nd chapter 41st verse the Bible
[56:56] said then they took baalam into the high
[56:59] places of Baal they actually carried
[57:02] this man into the places of other gods
[57:05] and from the view of another God tried
[57:09] to get this people cursed now if you
[57:11] take this church this message church and
[57:14] you go to the high places of the God of
[57:17] this age amen they'll show you ways to
[57:20] curse the Church of the Living God but
[57:22] God never cursed it do you see this
[57:25] baale would curse them but God never
[57:26] cursed him amen I I think the power of
[57:29] this is when God begins to move upon
[57:32] balum and he comes back amen and they
[57:34] say well I'll tell you what if you can't
[57:36] curse him from there let's go over to
[57:38] this other place and they took them into
[57:40] the high places of the wat tires where
[57:42] man could see the whole encampment of
[57:45] Israel and they could see every problems
[57:48] amen but as they were in those places
[57:50] and they could look up out upon them
[57:52] balum had to come back and he' come back
[57:55] with a story to tell them God is not a
[57:58] man God is not a man I think it's
[58:01] powerful this morning to see that God is
[58:03] not a man amen that he should lie
[58:06] neither the son of man that he should
[58:08] repent and as he shall not do it that he
[58:11] has spoken shall he not make it good in
[58:13] other words God is not a man that you're
[58:16] going to tell him something about me
[58:18] that changes his mind I thank God this
[58:20] morning to know that God is Not So
[58:23] fickle that he changes his mind every
[58:25] couple of days
[58:26] about the Church of God do you see God
[58:29] is not a man that he's that he's able to
[58:31] repent nor the son of man that he should
[58:34] lie he's not going to lie he's not going
[58:36] to say things about the church that's
[58:38] not true and he's not going to change
[58:40] his mind about what he said and
[58:43] sometimes maybe you can't even see from
[58:45] your human perspective the Reason God
[58:48] called you or the reason that God has
[58:50] done to you the way he has amen but God
[58:53] ain't changing his mind even when you
[58:56] don't agree with the word about yourself
[58:58] he still said it and he still believes
[59:01] it and God can't lie because he's a God
[59:04] that don't lie amen behold amen balam
[59:07] said I have received commandment to
[59:08] bless and he blessed and he said I
[59:10] cannot reverse it do you know there are
[59:13] certain things that are
[59:15] irreversible there are certain things
[59:17] that are irreversible and the blessing
[59:19] of God is irreversible I want you to
[59:22] know this morning there are certain
[59:23] things in your life Satan cannot take
[59:25] from you amen your health May
[59:27] deteriorate your your finances may
[59:30] change amen your mood swings may happen
[59:33] amen but you see God has blessed you in
[59:35] a way that is an irreversible blessing
[59:39] that God puts upon you in other words
[59:41] there are things commanded toward our
[59:43] lives that there is nothing can change
[59:46] what God has done in his word concerning
[59:49] our life I remember when it became real
[59:52] to me amen that what God done in
[59:54] eternity sat can't change in time I'm
[59:58] glad to know there's nothing in time can
[1:00:01] change what God did in eternity listen
[1:00:04] let me say this a man can say whatever
[1:00:07] they want to about me but God never
[1:00:09] changes his mind about me no matter what
[1:00:12] man thinks or man says that's why Paul
[1:00:14] said I am persuaded that neither death
[1:00:18] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[1:00:21] nor powers nor things present or things
[1:00:23] to come not he or death or any creature
[1:00:26] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:00:28] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:00:30] lord now in numbers 23 and 23 he said
[1:00:33] there is no enchantment amen against
[1:00:35] Jacob and neither any divination against
[1:00:38] Israel according to this time see there
[1:00:40] is nothing you can't put any Hocus Pocus
[1:00:43] on this
[1:00:44] bride you can try to say I curse you you
[1:00:47] can't curse me amen I tell you this I I
[1:00:50] have been in the forign world and I know
[1:00:52] there is real black magic there are real
[1:00:54] witch doctors amen but let me tell you
[1:00:57] this there is a real God and he has made
[1:01:00] a real promise concerning the Church of
[1:01:02] the Living God I remember first trip I
[1:01:04] ever made to India amen I remember
[1:01:06] standing in a hotel on a Sunday morning
[1:01:08] and and the Darkness was on and I was in
[1:01:10] there and I was trying to get ready and
[1:01:12] it was dark everywhere and things little
[1:01:14] weird things kept happening all around
[1:01:16] me and Satan come along and said well
[1:01:18] you've been cursed cuz I I was preaching
[1:01:20] pretty strong against false idols and
[1:01:21] things and and I I knew I'd stirred up
[1:01:23] some stuff pretty good and and and say
[1:01:26] says to me well you've been cursed and
[1:01:28] this happened and this happened and this
[1:01:29] happened and this happened and that's
[1:01:31] what that's what the problem is amen and
[1:01:33] as soon as that started settling in my
[1:01:35] mind another voice spoke and he said I
[1:01:38] have blessed thee and Abraham's seed has
[1:01:40] been blessed and whoever blesses thee
[1:01:42] shall be blessed and whoever curses thee
[1:01:45] shall be cursed and in that moment I
[1:01:47] knew amen that there was no witchcraft
[1:01:50] there is no divination there is no
[1:01:53] enchantment there is no Hocus po there's
[1:01:56] no secret Council meetings there is no
[1:01:59] group of preachers there is no group of
[1:02:01] men that can curse what God has already
[1:02:04] blessed and I thank God to this morning
[1:02:07] that when God's blessing comes upon the
[1:02:09] church amen that Satan cannot reverse
[1:02:12] what God has already set upon the Church
[1:02:15] of the Living God and I ain't got to go
[1:02:17] back every week and ask I ain't got to
[1:02:20] go back every week and ask Lord is the
[1:02:22] blessing still on me listen to me gifts
[1:02:24] and callings are without
[1:02:26] repentance come on church amen if God
[1:02:29] called you as a son or a daughter of God
[1:02:32] you were called to be a son or daughter
[1:02:34] of God before you ever stepped in this
[1:02:36] church and if God can save you over your
[1:02:39] wicked nature and he could call you over
[1:02:42] your wickedness in your life how much
[1:02:44] greater can he keep you once you're a
[1:02:47] son and daughter of God born in the Holy
[1:02:50] Ghost I tell you what I don't sell out
[1:02:52] to fear I will not be afraid of the
[1:02:55] devil and his wickedness and all of the
[1:02:58] puke he can spit out in this age that we
[1:03:01] are true Sons and Daughters of God we
[1:03:04] have been called and anointed and
[1:03:06] elected the age amen and there ain't
[1:03:09] nothing the devil could do about
[1:03:13] it and there ain't nothing the devil can
[1:03:15] do about it somebody said ain't you
[1:03:17] afraid no I am not afraid I have heard
[1:03:22] the word in this age I am not afraid of
[1:03:25] that enemy
[1:03:27] hallelujah hallelujah God Amen has not
[1:03:31] beheld you from balam's camp or bic's
[1:03:34] Camp amen but he hath beheld you amen he
[1:03:37] has beheld you from his own
[1:03:41] Mountaintop the Prophet come back
[1:03:43] brother BR said it like this I have not
[1:03:46] conceived iniquity of Jacob I don't see
[1:03:49] him from the utmost Parts because I have
[1:03:51] beheld him from the mountain top I have
[1:03:54] not found iniquity in Jacob knows how he
[1:03:56] uses the two Jacob and Israel amen I
[1:03:58] have not seen the perverseness in Jacob
[1:04:01] nor the iniquity in Israel God wasn't
[1:04:04] looking it's the reason he wasn't seeing
[1:04:06] it come on that now that there's a
[1:04:08] powerful thing setting here God would
[1:04:11] have seen it had he looked but God
[1:04:13] wasn't looking at the people he was
[1:04:15] looking at the
[1:04:17] atonement you say well you know well you
[1:04:19] you need to see it from this direction
[1:04:22] well but I look as my perspective I must
[1:04:25] look at it it through the word because
[1:04:27] that's the way God sees it when he puts
[1:04:30] it in his word that's how God sees
[1:04:32] things is he puts it in his word now
[1:04:35] truly that bunch of Israelites I'll tell
[1:04:37] you what a prophet said he said he had
[1:04:39] done every dirty thing there was to
[1:04:42] do and truly that bunch of Israelites
[1:04:45] had done that and that's right and that
[1:04:47] where that preacher failed to see it he
[1:04:49] thought surely a holy and moral God
[1:04:52] would curse these people for the bad
[1:04:53] things they had done but they failed to
[1:04:56] see the brass Serpent and the smitten
[1:04:58] Rock going before them they failed to
[1:04:59] see the signs he said he looked at the
[1:05:02] moral side but God was not looking at
[1:05:06] that he was looking at the
[1:05:08] election now church that's that's that's
[1:05:10] that's a real Bible teaching that God
[1:05:14] was looking at the election and he said
[1:05:16] oh how Godly are thy tents oh Jacob now
[1:05:19] what is it it was a blessing that had
[1:05:21] come upon them do you know when God
[1:05:23] blesses you you're blessed and so
[1:05:25] somebody says well Heen I I don't know
[1:05:27] brother Wayne I've got some issues and I
[1:05:29] got situations listen I'm not talking
[1:05:31] about those kind of blessings I'm
[1:05:33] talking about the blessing of the way
[1:05:34] God sees
[1:05:35] you because this is the blessing that he
[1:05:38] had upon David in Psalms 32 when David
[1:05:41] said blessed is a man whose
[1:05:43] transgressions is Forgiven and whose
[1:05:46] sins are covered in Psalms 32 and2 he
[1:05:49] said blessed is a man whom the Lord
[1:05:51] imputeth not his iniquity and who in the
[1:05:55] spirit is there is no G now what does
[1:05:57] that word impute means it means simply
[1:06:00] amen that God don't count it now it's
[1:06:03] not that David didn't do it it's that
[1:06:05] God didn't count it amen do you see some
[1:06:08] that that come on y'all read David's
[1:06:10] story amen David did it but God didn't
[1:06:13] count it I I sometimes it's a it's a
[1:06:16] it's a hard thing for people to see this
[1:06:18] but but any of you that ever went to
[1:06:20] school and and the teacher had a class
[1:06:22] favorite you you know about that because
[1:06:24] you know you done ever little thing you
[1:06:26] done and there was a mark by your name
[1:06:27] you know but there was that one little
[1:06:29] fella that one little that one little
[1:06:32] kid amen that that that never had a mark
[1:06:35] by their name you know why they never
[1:06:37] had a mark it wasn't cuz they didn't do
[1:06:40] what I did it's just the teacher looked
[1:06:42] at them different he the teacher saw
[1:06:45] them different amen they were as mean as
[1:06:47] I was but the difference was amen the
[1:06:50] teacher saw them different so they never
[1:06:52] got no marks amen and you could get mad
[1:06:54] and say they ain't got no marks but they
[1:06:56] did this and this and this and think
[1:06:58] well I'm sorry I didn't see it can you
[1:07:01] imagine amen the devil trying to get
[1:07:03] God's children in trouble amen when all
[1:07:06] of these things that the devil sees amen
[1:07:09] but God don't have any marks there is no
[1:07:12] marks there is no iniquity imputed to
[1:07:16] the children of God Amen because that
[1:07:19] God said you are
[1:07:22] blessed glory be to God
[1:07:27] now it's one thing Amen to say that in
[1:07:29] the Old Testament but Paul comes along
[1:07:32] in Romans chapter 4 brother Braham said
[1:07:34] this is the scripture he reads when he
[1:07:35] got the blues in Romans chapter 4 he
[1:07:38] says Paul says this what shall we say
[1:07:41] then that Abraham our father as
[1:07:43] pertaining to the flesh ha found for If
[1:07:45] Abraham were justified by works he with
[1:07:48] were to Glory but not before God for
[1:07:51] what saith the scripture Abraham
[1:07:52] believed God it was counted unto him for
[1:07:54] righteousness now to him that worketh is
[1:07:57] the reward not reckoned of Grace but of
[1:07:58] debt but to him that worketh not but
[1:08:02] believeth on him that justify the
[1:08:05] ungodly his faith is counted for
[1:08:08] righteousness now even as David describe
[1:08:11] the blessedness of this man unto whom
[1:08:14] God imputeth righteousness without works
[1:08:17] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:08:19] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:08:22] blessed is the man whom the Lord will
[1:08:25] not impute sin now I I I sometimes
[1:08:28] really enjoy looking at the writer of
[1:08:31] scripture and this is Paul now talking
[1:08:34] about David now David and Paul both had
[1:08:36] something in common they were both the
[1:08:38] Seed of Abraham they were both children
[1:08:40] of Abraham and and David had troubles in
[1:08:44] his life but he was recording that God
[1:08:47] never saw them and here Paul is now look
[1:08:50] at Paul's record if you start looking at
[1:08:51] Paul it's an amazing thing because Paul
[1:08:54] has all this problem in that he was
[1:08:56] killing Christians and he was
[1:08:58] persecuting which was for sure it was
[1:09:00] blaspheming for sure Paul was
[1:09:03] blaspheming God Amen he was blaspheming
[1:09:05] the very spirit of God Amen but you know
[1:09:08] what's powerful God never counted it and
[1:09:11] Paul is writing this amen about David
[1:09:14] but he is a recipient himself knowing
[1:09:17] that when God has blessed a man that
[1:09:20] that man is blessed and there is nothing
[1:09:22] that can change it and God never counted
[1:09:25] and that's what I I probably would have
[1:09:27] to say to you this morning is be careful
[1:09:30] how you judge somebody because you might
[1:09:32] be looking at them different than God's
[1:09:33] looking at them you might be seeing
[1:09:35] things differently than God sees them
[1:09:38] because God may see them from a
[1:09:39] different perspective and I want to see
[1:09:42] the perspective that God seen brother
[1:09:44] random says when Abraham's commentary
[1:09:46] was written the Divine commentary Paul
[1:09:48] wrote of him he never mentioned one
[1:09:50] thing about Abraham's unbelief never no
[1:09:53] not one thing was counted to him and and
[1:09:56] I'm a I'm a I read my Bible and you all
[1:09:59] know that when the angel spoke to
[1:10:00] Abraham the Bible said he staggered
[1:10:03] backwards and fell on the ground
[1:10:05] laughing at the angel at the idea of
[1:10:08] having a child in his old age the Bible
[1:10:10] records it in the Book of Genesis that
[1:10:12] he fell on the ground but when Paul
[1:10:13] records it in the Book of Romans he said
[1:10:16] he never even staggered now now either
[1:10:19] now either he did or he didn't yes he
[1:10:22] staggered yes he even fell on the ground
[1:10:25] naturally but when God wrote his story
[1:10:28] he never even staggered at the promises
[1:10:31] of God and I pray this morning that God
[1:10:34] writes my story I pray amen that it's
[1:10:36] not my accusers that write it I pray
[1:10:39] that it's not my enemies that write it I
[1:10:41] pray God writes my stories because God
[1:10:44] sees the intent of my heart he sees the
[1:10:47] mistakes that are made are made for the
[1:10:50] kingdom of God hallelujah somebody said
[1:10:52] well I never made no mistakes well you
[1:10:54] ain't never done nothing
[1:10:58] yet if you ever do something and you
[1:11:00] then you recognize amen that there are
[1:11:02] things to pick on Amen but there is no
[1:11:05] sin imputed can I just read a couple
[1:11:07] quotes here as we go along brother B
[1:11:09] said did you know a real Christian
[1:11:10] doesn't even have sin imputed at all to
[1:11:12] him because David said bless this is a
[1:11:15] man whom God will not impute sin when
[1:11:17] they're washed in the blood of the Lamb
[1:11:19] not by m belief but really by the blood
[1:11:21] of the Lamb God does not impute anything
[1:11:23] that's done because they're under the
[1:11:26] blood and he doesn't see it that's the
[1:11:28] blood sacrifice the only thing he can
[1:11:30] see you in is the way he saw you before
[1:11:34] the foundation of the world well I tell
[1:11:37] you what that are to get a running spell
[1:11:38] going amen the only way God can see me
[1:11:42] is the way he saw me before the
[1:11:45] foundation of the world that's not an
[1:11:47] almanac that's a Vindicated Prophet so
[1:11:50] when God's looking at you the only way
[1:11:53] he sees me is the way he saw me before
[1:11:56] the foundation of the world I tell you I
[1:11:59] thank God this morning that he ain't
[1:12:00] trying to figure out who I'm going to be
[1:12:03] he already knows who I am he's already
[1:12:06] given his word concerning my life and he
[1:12:08] cannot see me
[1:12:11] differently hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:12:15] all that he can look at is because he's
[1:12:17] redeemed now now some people have
[1:12:19] trouble even praying because they got uh
[1:12:21] condemnations in their life they got
[1:12:23] trouble and they say well I I don't even
[1:12:25] to know if I have a right to pray
[1:12:27] brother Ram says when you're praying he
[1:12:29] said God don't see me he just hears my
[1:12:31] voice through the blood of Jesus he
[1:12:33] don't even see me he hears my voice amen
[1:12:37] listen this morning hey something
[1:12:38] something setting over your prayer life
[1:12:40] some old devil said well you did this or
[1:12:42] said that or this and and you don't have
[1:12:43] any right to talk to God anymore listen
[1:12:45] there's a blood amen and you're standing
[1:12:48] under it so look up through that blood
[1:12:50] and say father forgive me amen and the
[1:12:52] prophet of God said when you speak to
[1:12:54] the blood
[1:12:55] and you confess your sins the only thing
[1:12:58] that's heard on the other side is Holy
[1:13:01] Holy Holy the blood is a converter of
[1:13:04] confessed sins and it comes out as holy
[1:13:08] holy holy he doesn't see me he hears my
[1:13:11] voice and the blood is what represents
[1:13:15] me huh in Micah chapter 7 verse 19 the
[1:13:18] Bible said he will have compassion upon
[1:13:20] us he will subdue our iniquities and
[1:13:23] thou will cast their sins into the
[1:13:25] depths of the sea into the depths of the
[1:13:29] sea now he will subdue our iniquities
[1:13:33] when God takes away the guilt of the sin
[1:13:35] that it may not condemn us now ain't you
[1:13:38] thankful that he can take away the guilt
[1:13:40] of sin that the sin would not condemn us
[1:13:43] and he can take away the power of sin
[1:13:47] that it may not rule over us so not only
[1:13:50] does he do away with the guilt of it he
[1:13:52] does away with the power of it that it
[1:13:54] won't be able to rule over us he doesn't
[1:13:56] throw it over on the banks of the sea he
[1:13:59] throws it in the depths of the sea amen
[1:14:02] that way that it's not merely on the
[1:14:05] seashore for someone to walk by and
[1:14:08] find it's not merely just cast on the
[1:14:11] seashore that somebody could walk by and
[1:14:14] find it if the water goes down amen but
[1:14:16] rather it is cast into the depths of the
[1:14:19] sea that it may never be found
[1:14:22] again listen the Bible says in Jeremiah
[1:14:25] 50 he says that in those days sath the
[1:14:27] Lord the days the iniquity of Israel
[1:14:30] shall be sought for and there shall be
[1:14:33] none and the sins of Judah they shall
[1:14:36] not be found for I will pardon them whom
[1:14:38] I reserve the Bible said that people

[1:17:03] a Bible reader in Isaiah the 65th
[1:17:06] chapter it said that I will be there
[1:17:08] with my offsprings and a prophet of God

[1:18:08] about is how that we whip that
[1:18:10] devil on November the 10th 2024 in Full
[1:18:15] Gospel Lighthouse and we're going to sit
[1:18:17] there and talk about how the Holy Spirit
[1:18:19] came in the room and while we were in
[1:18:21] the middle amen of a trial in our life
[1:18:23] and God showed up and said you're
[1:18:25] looking at it wrong you're looking at it
[1:18:27] like a human but I made you a child of
[1:18:30] God you're looking at it like that you
[1:18:32] could be lost in God and lost and God
[1:18:34] but God is going to save every child
[1:18:37] that he has got and there ain't nothing
[1:18:39] going to stop
[1:18:41] [Applause]
[1:18:44] it there's not enough devils in hell to
[1:18:47] stop what God is going to do in this
[1:18:52] generation you say I see a lot of
[1:18:54] trouble I see a lot of Glory you say I
[1:18:56] see a lot of problems I see a lot of
[1:18:58] positive I see a lot of God I see a lot
[1:19:01] of the power of God I see a lot of
[1:19:03] promises I see the Horizon you may see a
[1:19:06] troubled people I see a rapturing people
[1:19:09] you may see a bunch of nuts but I see
[1:19:11] God's finest and purest I'm looking
[1:19:14] through the window of
[1:19:17] Prophecy
[1:19:18] perspective is
[1:19:21] everything and Satan takes you in places
[1:19:24] to try to get you to perceive one
[1:19:27] another the way he perceives
[1:19:32] them it's a battle for
[1:19:36] perception no wonder he would say who is
[1:19:39] like the god that would pardon iniquity
[1:19:42] I've always loved that who is a god like
[1:19:44] unto thee that pardon iniquity he could
[1:19:46] have said anything when he finished that
[1:19:48] statement who is like a god that made
[1:19:50] the heavens the Earth the sea he could
[1:19:51] have said who is a God that made the the
[1:19:54] stars made the human he could have said
[1:19:55] any of that but he didn't he said who is
[1:19:59] a God Like It unto thee that paronthi
[1:20:02] because that it takes God it takes God
[1:20:07] to do
[1:20:09] it now here's the thing what you see and
[1:20:14] what you do brother Bram said see it's
[1:20:17] not all together determined by what you
[1:20:20] see and what you hear he said it's
[1:20:23] determined on the discernment we have
[1:20:24] have of what we see and what we
[1:20:28] hear your destination is your
[1:20:30] discernment of what you see and hear now
[1:20:33] if you're a amen as a as a as a as a
[1:20:36] Believer John chapter 3 the scripture
[1:20:40] tells us the story of Nicodemus and
[1:20:41] Jesus he's a great leader among the
[1:20:44] Israelite people and he comes to Jesus
[1:20:46] by night and says it Master we know
[1:20:49] you're a teacher from
[1:20:51] God what should I do and Jesus told
[1:20:54] you're going to have to be born again it
[1:20:56] was a mystery it's a Marvel to him how
[1:20:59] should I enter my mother's womb again
[1:21:01] should how is this to be but it was then
[1:21:04] that Jesus explained by the water the
[1:21:05] blood and the spirit and he says look
[1:21:07] unless a man is born again he cannot see
[1:21:11] the kingdom of God now what Jesus was
[1:21:15] telling him that unless you're unless
[1:21:18] you're born again you can't see things
[1:21:21] the way a Christian sees them you can't
[1:21:25] understand the way a Christian
[1:21:26] understands see and and and and may I
[1:21:29] say this brother BR said sometimes
[1:21:31] people don't have the right
[1:21:33] discernment and the church gets the name
[1:21:35] of the devil tacked on it because of the
[1:21:38] wrong discernment people are afraid of
[1:21:41] it they publicly denounced our Lord as
[1:21:45] an insane person they hung him on a
[1:21:48] cross in capital punishment under their
[1:21:50] civil law in their religion they deemed
[1:21:54] him as an insane and crazy man they
[1:21:57] beheaded Apostle Paul they cut they cut
[1:22:00] Isaiah aunder because of their
[1:22:03] perception of him think about this this
[1:22:06] morning the unconverted man has no
[1:22:09] ability to judge the house of God the
[1:22:13] unconverted has no ability to judge your
[1:22:16] worship he don't have ability to judge
[1:22:18] your direction he don't have ability to
[1:22:20] judge your life because he's unconverted
[1:22:23] man he cannot not see it the way God
[1:22:25] sees it because he cannot see the
[1:22:28] kingdom of God that's why people look at
[1:22:30] the way I worship and dance and praise
[1:22:32] God and they think I'm a heretic well
[1:22:34] listen you think anything you want to
[1:22:35] about me but I'm the one that knows God
[1:22:38] saved me I'm the one that knows where I
[1:22:41] would be if it wasn't for God and this
[1:22:43] word people say well brother Wayne you
[1:22:45] preach the message too strong well amen
[1:22:47] you don't know what I be without this
[1:22:50] message and the greatest Testament that
[1:22:53] I have it's real is it's not brother
[1:22:55] Ron's life it's not brother Ram's life
[1:22:57] it's not brother Ericson or or one of
[1:22:59] you people but my own life testifies to
[1:23:02] me that this message is a reality and
[1:23:05] God gave it to me and I can see it from
[1:23:08] God's perception of what he gave in this
[1:23:11] age and now listen you sometimes people
[1:23:14] say well you people get carried away and
[1:23:16] you you act like you're drunk and
[1:23:17] everything else well let me let me just
[1:23:19] let me just put it out there amen the
[1:23:21] the Bible said Jesus was the lily of the
[1:23:24] valley
[1:23:25] and brother B said what come out of that
[1:23:27] Lily amen that was important was the
[1:23:29] Opium he said and that's the thing
[1:23:31] people go down these opium houses he
[1:23:33] said and they get high on opium and they
[1:23:35] try to get the cares of their lives and
[1:23:37] they try to get their wores and they do
[1:23:39] it over in a drug housee somewhere but
[1:23:41] the Church of the Living God don't have
[1:23:42] to go to some drug house we don't have
[1:23:44] to go down to the crack house amen we
[1:23:47] don't have to go buy a bag of weed or or
[1:23:49] a fifth of whiskey amen because there's
[1:23:51] a lily in the valley so in the middle of
[1:23:54] our Valley don't you ever judge me till
[1:23:56] you've been in a valley amen until you
[1:23:58] have been in the depths of a dark Valley
[1:24:01] don't you ever judge me because of the
[1:24:03] Opium that I must take to maintain my
[1:24:06] life unless I have the Opium I'll never
[1:24:09] make it unless I have the Opium I would
[1:24:12] lose my mind but God gave us an opium
[1:24:15] and we don't have to go crazy we don't
[1:24:17] have to go into this insane world
[1:24:19] because God has G us something that we
[1:24:21] might have but I tell you there's some
[1:24:23] side effects to open OPI has some side
[1:24:26] effects to Opium it makes you not care
[1:24:29] what other people think about you you
[1:24:30] want to get free in the spirit get a
[1:24:32] little opium and it'll take the pride
[1:24:35] off of your life it'll take the humility
[1:24:38] and raise it to the place that you can
[1:24:40] love God whether you're in church or a
[1:24:43] supermarket or in a family vacation amen
[1:24:46] because you get high on the Lord
[1:24:54] look buddy amen I know people said well
[1:24:56] brother Wayne you shouldn't dance in the
[1:24:58] spirit well you do whatever do whatever
[1:25:00] suits you but I remember going to a Don
[1:25:03] Williams concert when I was 19 and
[1:25:05] dancing to Louisiana Saturday night well
[1:25:07] if I can dance to Louisiana Saturday
[1:25:09] night and a Don Williams concert surely
[1:25:12] to God I can dance to The Old Rugged
[1:25:15] Cross of the meeting in the air or
[1:25:17] oldfashioned religion amen why because
[1:25:20] church amen I never quit Dancing I
[1:25:23] changed my partners I took the Holy
[1:25:25] Ghost and the power of God you got to
[1:25:28] see it from the perspective I see
[1:25:31] it when I'm dancing it's not emotion
[1:25:34] when I'm dancing it's not to build
[1:25:36] somebody up when I'm dancing because I'm
[1:25:39] free I'm dancing cuz the Holy Ghost came
[1:25:42] in my life and I can move my feet and I
[1:25:45] can move my hands and I can move my
[1:25:47] mouth because God gave me life
[1:25:54] God blessed me and the devil can't
[1:25:55] change it so I say devil go on back to
[1:25:58] hell you came out of the Sons and
[1:26:00] Daughters of God are going to enjoy the
[1:26:21] Salvation well it's that old time Holy
[1:26:24] Spirit and the devil won't go near it
[1:26:28] that's the reason people fear it but
[1:26:30] it's good enough for me give me that old
[1:26:33] time Holy Ghost give me that shout
[1:26:35] dancing tongue talking Bible believing
[1:26:38] Holy Ghost feel
[1:26:43] living you can have your dry
[1:26:48] religion I don't want nothing to do with
[1:26:51] it
[1:26:56] I want an atmosphere where children can
[1:26:58] be
[1:27:00] born people can get
[1:27:03] saved so well by the way I think this
[1:27:06] about it and I think that about it well
[1:27:08] some unconverted people have no ability
[1:27:10] to
[1:27:11] discern that's that's can I
[1:27:16] say Hollywood has no right to discern
[1:27:20] the dressing of our sisters that's
[1:27:29] them women ain't got the moral of a
[1:27:32] pig come on brother B said they're worse
[1:27:35] than a female
[1:27:37] dog and they want my daughter to dress
[1:27:39] like
[1:27:40] that they want your daughter to dress
[1:27:43] like that and act like that and that's
[1:27:44] acceptable it's
[1:27:46] unacceptable but unconverted men looking
[1:27:49] at them wants them to go that
[1:27:52] direction well we might as well preach
[1:27:54] we're
[1:27:55] here that's why some preachers can't
[1:27:57] preach against
[1:27:59] makeup you know what brother Bram said
[1:28:01] he said if your pastor Don't Preach
[1:28:02] against makeup vote him out and get you
[1:28:03] a man of
[1:28:05] God cuz you can put makeup on and meet a
[1:28:07] man he said but you don't put makeup on
[1:28:09] to meet God and he said if I know
[1:28:12] anything about it you better wash your
[1:28:14] face sister before you meet God there's
[1:28:17] one woman in the Bible that wore it and
[1:28:19] that was
[1:28:21] Jezebel you know why she painted up she
[1:28:24] painted up to hide her evil
[1:28:28] heart talking about judging now judging
[1:28:32] judging you know that you know that uh
[1:28:34] uh that that lot had more than one son
[1:28:37] and one of his other son one of his
[1:28:39] other sons was Ammon amen one of them is
[1:28:43] BIC the other one's Nash and he was the
[1:28:46] king of Ammon Ammon was a was a was a
[1:28:49] brother to Moab and they had a king do
[1:28:53] you know when the when the when the when
[1:28:54] the Bible was transitioning from
[1:28:57] prophets to Kings that when the time of
[1:29:00] Saul when Samuel was being turned down
[1:29:02] they they went ahead and got him a king
[1:29:04] and in that hour there were some of the
[1:29:05] people didn't receive the king and so
[1:29:07] this so This Nash king of
[1:29:10] Ammon moab's brother country went to him
[1:29:15] and said I'll tell you what we'll do
[1:29:16] we'll make a deal Let's Make a Deal
[1:29:20] we're going to put out the right eye of
[1:29:21] every man you got in here and we'll
[1:29:24] we'll be able to make a deal well I'll
[1:29:25] tell you this the only way a Believer
[1:29:27] ever makes a deal with the Devil is to
[1:29:29] lose your right eye because your right
[1:29:32] eye is a type of your spiritual sight
[1:29:36] and when you lose the spiritual sight
[1:29:39] you lose true perception of what God is
[1:29:42] doing do you see what it is the Satan
[1:29:44] will want to poke out your eye but the
[1:29:47] reason he wants to poke out your eye is
[1:29:49] because he wants to make it a carnal
[1:29:51] Warfare he wants you to look in the
[1:29:53] mirror at yourself self because that's
[1:29:55] where you lose your power when you start
[1:29:57] examining looking at your own flesh and
[1:29:59] you start thinking about you and all you
[1:30:01] can do and all you can say that's where
[1:30:03] you lose your power but when you start
[1:30:05] looking at the cross that's where you
[1:30:07] gain your power when you look at
[1:30:10] yourself you go down when you look at
[1:30:12] Christ you go up look at it because God
[1:30:15] does not want us to lose our spiritual
[1:30:17] sight because that's how we're going to
[1:30:20] fight the battle that we're fighting of
[1:30:22] course in the Old Testament you know
[1:30:24] They Carried their shield and they
[1:30:25] covered up their left eye with that
[1:30:27] shield and their right eye was their
[1:30:29] fighting eye and they'd hold a sword and
[1:30:31] that right eye was the only eye sticks
[1:30:33] out behind the shield and that was their
[1:30:35] fighting eye that's the way they could
[1:30:36] defend their land and and they could
[1:30:38] have a and you see the moment Satan puts
[1:30:40] out your spiritual eye amen that's when
[1:30:43] you start making deals with the devil
[1:30:45] that's when things start cripping in
[1:30:47] your home that's when situations start
[1:30:49] rising up because you're losing the
[1:30:51] sight that this is a spiritual battle am
[1:30:55] now I could get pretty heavy in that but
[1:30:57] you you got to you got to be careful
[1:30:59] because that's when Satan goes telling
[1:31:00] you things about one another and when
[1:31:02] you don't got no spiritual sight that's
[1:31:04] all you do is believe it see because
[1:31:05] it's the very thing that was being done
[1:31:07] here is we we'll say this about this
[1:31:09] person will say this about this person
[1:31:11] will say about this and after a little
[1:31:13] while you've lost all your confidence in
[1:31:15] God you lose all your confidence in
[1:31:17] yourself because Satan has put you in
[1:31:20] the seat of scornful and in the place of
[1:31:23] criticism and and you're going to die in
[1:31:25] that place and he knows it he knows now
[1:31:28] now I I could preach a while here but I
[1:31:30] I'll just say it brother M said it very
[1:31:32] clearly don't you ever get
[1:31:34] bitter don't you ever get bitter because
[1:31:37] bitterness will eat all the Christ out
[1:31:39] of your life it'll eat it all out Church
[1:31:43] it'll make you a carnal man oh you may
[1:31:45] still go to heaven you may still be a
[1:31:47] Christian but you're going to me a
[1:31:48] miserable sort you're going to live an
[1:31:50] UND defeated life you won't have any
[1:31:52] Victory you won't have because you're
[1:31:54] not looking at the right things amen
[1:31:56] I'll tell you this the people in this
[1:31:58] church that sees the most problems in
[1:32:00] the church I guarantee you are the worst
[1:32:03] off in the
[1:32:06] church come
[1:32:08] on the people that sees the most
[1:32:11] problems has got the most
[1:32:16] problems I I'm a pastor the people that
[1:32:20] see the most problems have got the most
[1:32:22] problems because they're viewing it from
[1:32:24] a carnal place and if you look at the
[1:32:27] church in carnality sure b b b come out
[1:32:31] over and help you out amen but if you're
[1:32:34] going to look at it from the high place
[1:32:36] if you're going to climb up in the
[1:32:37] presence of God you would see it through
[1:32:39] the blood and if you're looking through
[1:32:41] the blood you would see it the way God
[1:32:43] sees it and your perception of
[1:32:45] everything would change when you get a
[1:32:47] vision of the power of God I tell you I
[1:32:50] thank God today that there's a vision
[1:32:52] that we can have of the power of God
[1:32:54] you know when Joshua crossed the river
[1:32:56] Jordan and went into his first great
[1:32:58] battle at the walls of Jericho now
[1:33:00] that's a battle like our battle and it
[1:33:02] was a great stronghold and he didn't
[1:33:04] know how he would ever get by it there's
[1:33:06] strongholds in your lives this morning
[1:33:08] and you're sitting here thinking how
[1:33:10] will I ever get this stronghold out of
[1:33:12] my life well I tell you what happened in
[1:33:14] the Bible God came down in the form of a
[1:33:17] man and spoke to Joshua and Joshua
[1:33:20] didn't even know who he was talking to
[1:33:22] until he said to him I'm the captain of
[1:33:24] the Lord's host I'm here to command this
[1:33:27] battle and when Joshua saw who it was he
[1:33:30] humbled himself he went into reverence
[1:33:33] but that wasn't all he did he didn't
[1:33:35] only say well I believe the message is
[1:33:37] right and I believe that's the truth he
[1:33:39] didn't only do that but he went into
[1:33:42] action with the command that was given
[1:33:43] to his life he was so sure it was God
[1:33:47] commanding him that he went into action
[1:33:50] and literally believed that he could
[1:33:52] walk the wall of Jericho down without a
[1:33:55] sledgehammer without throwing one rock
[1:33:57] against those walls he believed that if
[1:34:00] he operated Under The Obedience of the
[1:34:03] message that the supernatural God would
[1:34:05] show up on his
[1:34:08] behalf now church when you change your
[1:34:11] perception you change your
[1:34:13] expectations now now you you you you you
[1:34:16] got to get this everybody if you do
[1:34:18] something wrong there ain't a person
[1:34:20] sitting in here that don't look for
[1:34:21] something bad to follow it right that's
[1:34:23] right I can show you in the Bible where
[1:34:25] you got the thought because remember
[1:34:26] when David numbered the children of
[1:34:28] Israel there was a lot of people died
[1:34:30] and then whenever that the B of peor the
[1:34:32] Feast of B peor there was a lot of
[1:34:34] people died amen but because it was
[1:34:36] Disobedience people died is that
[1:34:39] right it was Supernatural plagues that
[1:34:42] Came Upon them it was troubles That Came
[1:34:45] Upon them but if we can believe that
[1:34:48] obedience opens the door that that
[1:34:50] Disobedience opens the door of
[1:34:52] Supernatural
[1:34:54] then why don't we believe that obedience
[1:34:56] opens the door of Supernatural then if
[1:34:58] you haven't been baptized and you're
[1:35:00] trying to figure out how to be a
[1:35:02] Christian just take a few steps amen
[1:35:05] don't just say I believ God and I
[1:35:07] believe the Bible amen take some action
[1:35:10] get up and get baptized obey the
[1:35:12] scriptures in Christian baptism if
[1:35:14] you've never had the Holy Ghost quit
[1:35:16] saying well I believe there's a Holy
[1:35:17] Ghost and go to receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:35:20] somebody said well I'm praying for it
[1:35:21] quit praying for it and take it amen
[1:35:24] quit begging God for something he's
[1:35:26] already give you and say Lord I receive
[1:35:29] the Holy Ghost because God ain't going
[1:35:31] to make you beg for it he's already paid
[1:35:34] the price for it you ain't got to come
[1:35:36] up with some money you ain't got to come
[1:35:38] up and pay some kind of price for it you
[1:35:40] got to receive what God has already
[1:35:43] given
[1:35:44] you do you see what it is amen it makes
[1:35:47] it it makes a huge difference on what
[1:35:49] you're looking at if you're looking at
[1:35:52] them walls well you probably won't get
[1:35:53] them to come down but if you see that it
[1:35:56] was the angel of the Covenant that was
[1:35:58] talking to Joshua that that talked to
[1:36:01] Joshua and he said those little words
[1:36:03] see I have given you this land that word
[1:36:06] see God commanded him to have a vision
[1:36:10] that it was his that it was his land it
[1:36:13] wasn't the janitor giving it to him it
[1:36:16] wasn't just a prophet giv it to him but
[1:36:19] it was God gave it to him he said see I
[1:36:21] have given you this land now go take it
[1:36:24] and if you see that Joy belongs to you
[1:36:27] then whatever devil whatever stronghold
[1:36:30] whatever problem is between you and it
[1:36:32] you know right now it's time to take
[1:36:34] action and go get what belongs to you if
[1:36:37] you're sitting here this morning and
[1:36:38] there amen and you're got a sick body
[1:36:40] healing belongs to you it happens in the
[1:36:43] spirit first folks it don't happen in
[1:36:45] the flesh it happens in the spirit and I
[1:36:48] pray this morning that every stronghold
[1:36:50] of unbelief would be broken that the
[1:36:53] power of God would bring healing in this
[1:36:55] building to every sick body to every
[1:36:58] person that's defeated to every
[1:37:00] depression to every every person bound
[1:37:02] under sin I pray the stronghold of the
[1:37:05] enemy would come down around your life
[1:37:08] that you might be able to receive God in
[1:37:10] a way that you have never knew
[1:37:12] him do you
[1:37:14] see a lot of people try to say well I'll
[1:37:17] tell you what there ain't no real devil
[1:37:20] well there
[1:37:22] is there is is a real devil and brother
[1:37:25] Bram said he was real he said there is a
[1:37:28] real devil and he said don't tell me
[1:37:30] that I meet him every day and I know a
[1:37:34] devil and you must be trained if you're
[1:37:36] going to meet him not trained in
[1:37:38] Psychology or education but trained by
[1:37:41] the holy spirit because God's power in
[1:37:44] his word is there to make it manifest
[1:37:47] the devil's just a Tormentor
[1:37:50] right that's all he is he's that to
[1:37:53] torment you anybody ever get something
[1:37:55] on their mind and it just won't leave
[1:37:57] you
[1:38:01] alone do you know 85% of what you worry
[1:38:04] about never comes to
[1:38:07] pass come on
[1:38:09] Church 85% what you we about never comes
[1:38:13] to
[1:38:14] pass you'll lay awake and wonder what's
[1:38:16] going to happen with this and how's this
[1:38:18] going to be and what's this going to be
[1:38:19] and it never even happens but it's Satan
[1:38:23] trying to torment you he's trying to
[1:38:26] take you in a place of Torment by giving
[1:38:28] you a perception of failure by giving
[1:38:31] you a perception of troubles and this is
[1:38:33] an oh I tell you Satan really likes to
[1:38:35] throw them out there because they're
[1:38:37] unconquerable Tre uh troubles when
[1:38:40] they're in your mind that's right right
[1:38:42] cuz he'll give it to you in a way
[1:38:43] there's no there's no there's no hope in
[1:38:45] fixing it see right the kind of trouble
[1:38:49] he gives you in your mind he can build
[1:38:51] all kinds of blockades and and this is
[1:38:53] going to happen and this that and this
[1:38:55] this GNA be this way and this going to
[1:38:57] happen after a little while you're just
[1:38:58] tore all the pieces but it's just the
[1:39:02] devil because he's a Tormentor every
[1:39:05] time Satan talks to you he takes you
[1:39:08] down have you ever noticed that when
[1:39:11] Satan starts talking to you you go
[1:39:13] downward isn't that wild have you ever
[1:39:16] noticed that your spirit gets lower and
[1:39:18] lower and lower you know why because his
[1:39:21] influence is a fallen angel
[1:39:24] right he's a fallen a fallen angel so
[1:39:29] since he's going down he's always
[1:39:32] influencing people to go with him amen
[1:39:36] look his influence on the serpent what
[1:39:37] happened to the serpent the serpent went
[1:39:39] from an upright creature to on its belly
[1:39:42] because of the influence of the devil
[1:39:44] what happened to all them angels that
[1:39:46] followed Satan they were cast down and
[1:39:48] they lost their position and fell
[1:39:51] downward because Satan is the king of
[1:39:55] the bottomless pit in the Book of
[1:39:57] Revelations the n9th chapter it'll tell
[1:39:59] you how that Satan come up from the
[1:40:01] bottomless pit and fills the Earth with
[1:40:03] smoke and trouble is everywhere and
[1:40:04] trials are everywhere amen but don't
[1:40:06] quit reading in Revelations 9 because if
[1:40:09] you read Revelations 10 and verse one
[1:40:11] the Bible said there's another Mighty
[1:40:14] Angel comes down from heaven and this
[1:40:17] one that comes down has come down to
[1:40:19] take you up this message didn't come to
[1:40:22] drive you you in the ground it come to
[1:40:24] bring you into the power of God that's
[1:40:27] the reason I don't believe our preachers
[1:40:29] should get up and beat our people up
[1:40:30] every Sunday morning the Church of the
[1:40:32] Living God shouldn't be beat down they
[1:40:34] ought to be lifted up by the influence
[1:40:36] and the power of the holy spirit because
[1:40:39] when God goes to talking to you I got
[1:40:42] Bible when God goes to talking to you
[1:40:44] job stand up like a man amen look what
[1:40:47] he does he causes the person to rise up
[1:40:50] John falls on his face get up John I
[1:40:53] want to talk to you about some things
[1:40:55] and when God begins to influence a man
[1:40:57] he begins to pick them up that's why
[1:40:59] Peter walked by a man amen and said to
[1:41:02] him there at the gate called Beautiful
[1:41:03] rise up on your feet that's why brother
[1:41:06] Brandon walked in Georgie Carter's house
[1:41:08] amen nine years she couldn't get out of
[1:41:10] the bed but under the influence of the
[1:41:12] mighty Angel rise up on your feet in the
[1:41:15] name of Jesus Christ because there's
[1:41:18] power to re to rise the church under
[1:41:21] this message
[1:41:24] perception perception is
[1:41:27] everything now Satan will be successful
[1:41:30] with
[1:41:32] reasoning
[1:41:33] now his first knockdown punch on the
[1:41:36] human race was
[1:41:38] reasoning that's how he knocked the
[1:41:40] human race down the first time was he
[1:41:43] did it by
[1:41:44] reasoning and that's the way he does it
[1:41:46] every
[1:41:47] time but God has
[1:41:49] said he's going to try to reason
[1:41:53] Satan tries to reason you out of the
[1:41:56] idea that the word will work that the
[1:42:00] word really is true and the prophet of
[1:42:03] God said see Satan is always
[1:42:05] bringing he's always bringing that's his
[1:42:09] job that see that that's Satan's job is
[1:42:13] to bring it he said brother Wayne why is
[1:42:15] it I keep having these thoughts and why
[1:42:17] is these things keep coming by why does
[1:42:20] this keep happening because it's Satan's
[1:42:21] job to bring it right
[1:42:23] it's his job but you know what I got a
[1:42:27] job these men have a job that's right
[1:42:29] and you know what the prophet God said
[1:42:31] he said God's Army was to cast out the
[1:42:34] devil that's right that's God's method
[1:42:37] of dealing with the Devil is cast him
[1:42:40] out we don't make deals with the
[1:42:42] devil we don't feed them and entertain
[1:42:44] them and try to pet him around and try
[1:42:46] to make a place for them in our life
[1:42:48] amen we don't do that we cast them out
[1:42:51] we take them by the nap of the neck and
[1:42:53] throw them out the back door because
[1:42:56] that's God's method of dealing with
[1:42:58] Devils now you might sit here this
[1:43:00] morning say well there's no such thing
[1:43:02] as a devil and I'm not really having
[1:43:04] trouble and I'm not really sick brother
[1:43:05] B said no he said you are you really are
[1:43:08] maybe are sick and you really may be
[1:43:09] having trouble he said but the way to
[1:43:11] overcome that is to recognize it and
[1:43:14] then call it a devil recognize it's a
[1:43:16] devil he said then after you recognize
[1:43:18] it's a devil then you can say greater is
[1:43:20] he that's in me than he that's in this
[1:43:22] problem
[1:43:23] because it's the devil doing the
[1:43:25] tormenting and it's God doing the
[1:43:27] influencing who would influence you to
[1:43:29] speak the word of God who would
[1:43:31] influence you to confess God's word over
[1:43:33] your situation it would take God to
[1:43:35] influence you to do that and God gave us
[1:43:38] the word and that word will remove Satan
[1:43:42] anywhere any place at any
[1:43:47] time we can try an experiment right
[1:43:49] quick on the front row right here you
[1:43:51] try you want to try an experiment start
[1:43:52] thinking you're really bad person just
[1:43:54] start thinking I'm a bad person I'm
[1:43:55] never going to make it and then out of
[1:43:57] your mouth say I'm a Son of God now
[1:43:59] which one was more
[1:44:01] powerful when you said I'm a Son of God
[1:44:03] you can't think I'm a bad person when
[1:44:05] you're saying I'm a Son of God go ahead
[1:44:07] and try it sometime try to think and
[1:44:10] speak at the same time you can't do it
[1:44:12] you can't sit there and think opposite
[1:44:14] of what's coming out of your mouth amen
[1:44:16] because that's why the Bible said let
[1:44:18] the weak say I am strong let you go
[1:44:21] ahead and confess the word of God
[1:44:23] because God's give you a weapon this
[1:44:24] morning that will whip the devil
[1:44:26] anywhere any place any time under any
[1:44:29] condition but Satan don't want you using
[1:44:32] it h he don't want you using it at all
[1:44:36] but amen I take this morning I believe
[1:44:38] as Sons and Daughters of God listen if
[1:44:40] this was the last sermon I ever preached
[1:44:43] if this was the last thing I ever said
[1:44:44] to Full Gospel Lighthouse if this is the
[1:44:46] last thing that I would put on recording
[1:44:49] I would tell the Church of the Living
[1:44:50] God press this battle I would tell you
[1:44:53] press this battle I would tell you that
[1:44:55] you're going to win it if you don't stop
[1:44:57] fighting it I'm going to tell you that
[1:44:58] you're going to overcome every devil
[1:45:00] that you're going to overcome every
[1:45:02] trial I'm going to say there's no weapon
[1:45:04] that's formed against you that shall be
[1:45:05] able to prosper because God has already
[1:45:09] made it that you're going to
[1:45:10] overcome come on
[1:45:13] Church you say well brother Wayne I got
[1:45:15] Devils y'all keep saying that that that
[1:45:17] that no weapon formed against me will
[1:45:19] prosper y'all keep saying that but the
[1:45:21] devil's hitting me all the time well
[1:45:22] look up the word Prosper it doesn't mean
[1:45:25] it's not going to hit you it doesn't
[1:45:27] mean Satan's not going to come against
[1:45:28] you it means it will not have its
[1:45:30] desired goal against you in other words
[1:45:33] whatever plans that the devil made for
[1:45:35] your life God's going to cancel them
[1:45:38] whatever plans Satan has said God's
[1:45:40] going to cancel them because God is not
[1:45:43] controlled by the
[1:45:45] devil I got living evidence standing
[1:45:48] right
[1:45:50] there that cancer can't kill a man if
[1:45:54] God don't want it
[1:45:57] to there's there there it is 3 years ago
[1:46:01] around this same time of year or four
[1:46:03] now amen around the same time of year
[1:46:06] amen but listen amen Satan can't take a
[1:46:08] life amen until God says so Satan can't
[1:46:11] kill it the cancer can't kill it until
[1:46:14] God is done with it amen so you might as
[1:46:17] well tell the devil I'm going to enjoy
[1:46:19] the life that God gave me and I'm going
[1:46:22] to use it for the glory of
[1:46:28] God it can't take your
[1:46:31] Liv God has to make that
[1:46:35] decision so well brother Wayne I got
[1:46:37] depressed it's no it ain't going to kill
[1:46:39] you no anxiety ain't going to kill you
[1:46:41] your sickness ain't going to kill you
[1:46:43] listen because God has set a mark over
[1:46:45] your life and he's determined that it
[1:46:50] can't no weapon it can't Prosper it it
[1:46:53] came to have its desired goal y'all
[1:46:55] y'all remember that story of Paul bunan
[1:46:58] when he wrote the Pilgrim's Progress
[1:47:00] y'all remember that and you remember
[1:47:01] when he was cutting across the field and
[1:47:03] and they talked to a Christian into
[1:47:05] getting off the path and he took a a
[1:47:07] better path look like amen and he took
[1:47:10] it out there and him and hope took out
[1:47:12] across the field but they got in the
[1:47:14] Dominion of despondency amen they got
[1:47:17] into the Dominion of it and and that
[1:47:19] King that great giant of despondency
[1:47:22] amen found them on his land and captured
[1:47:26] them and carried them to his kingdom do
[1:47:29] you see what I'm talking about a
[1:47:30] Christian should never be in that land
[1:47:32] and when you get there you got another
[1:47:34] king over you and they captured him and
[1:47:36] put him in a put him in a in a cage and
[1:47:39] and Paul bunan did a good story writing
[1:47:40] it because he applied and gave them
[1:47:43] weapons to destroy their life he gave
[1:47:46] them things that they could take their
[1:47:47] life with and then he beat them up real
[1:47:49] bad and said you ain't never getting out
[1:47:51] of here you might as well go ahead and
[1:47:52] and take your life you might as well
[1:47:54] goad and after about the third day of
[1:47:55] doing them that way finally hope looks
[1:47:57] over at Christian and he says Christian
[1:48:00] have you realized amen he would take our
[1:48:02] life if he could amen if he could do it
[1:48:05] he would do it but he can't so he's
[1:48:08] trying to talk us into doing it
[1:48:10] ourselves because he don't have the
[1:48:12] power to do it and when Christian
[1:48:15] realized that he said but how can I get
[1:48:17] out of this and he remembered in the
[1:48:19] beginning of his journey he had been
[1:48:20] given a key that he wore around his neck
[1:48:23] and the key was called promise and
[1:48:25] promise would open every door in the
[1:48:27] dungeon of Despair under the king of
[1:48:29] despondency and let me say this this
[1:48:31] morning there's a key in your heart
[1:48:33] called faith and it'll open every door
[1:48:36] because God's made a promise that devil
[1:48:38] can't kill you take the key out unlock
[1:48:41] the door and go to walking out of this
[1:48:43] trouble go to walking out of your
[1:48:45] problems because it cannot Prosper
[1:48:49] against you so brother Wayne what do you
[1:48:51] want me to do press the
[1:48:54] battle Yeah we go through things and and
[1:48:57] and I've had Satan come to me oh yeah
[1:48:59] well you just might as well give up I'm
[1:49:00] not giving up you it don't make any
[1:49:03] difference what you do listen press the
[1:49:05] battle press the battle this Bible I we
[1:49:08] were going through a great trial over at
[1:49:10] home we were going through something
[1:49:11] that was pretty powerful and and I was
[1:49:13] praying about something and the
[1:49:14] scripture came to me and he said Satan
[1:49:17] is like a roaring lion going around
[1:49:19] seeking whom he may devour and when I
[1:49:21] got to thinking about that I thought I
[1:49:23] got up from prayer and I looked around

[2:27:29] have those things in your mind be
[2:27:30] praying about those things and brother
[2:27:33] Wayne's been a real key part of our
[2:27:35] lives here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and
[2:27:37] it doesn't seem like it but it's we've
[2:27:39] only been the Spencers and the Lawson
[2:27:41] have only really been together in the
[2:27:42] last 10 years but it seems like eternity
[2:27:45] has
[2:27:46] touched and and just the things that
[2:27:49] have happened in those short space of
[2:27:51] time are so Supernatural and we just
[2:27:55] thank the Lord for it and count it a
[2:27:57] real honor that true word would share
