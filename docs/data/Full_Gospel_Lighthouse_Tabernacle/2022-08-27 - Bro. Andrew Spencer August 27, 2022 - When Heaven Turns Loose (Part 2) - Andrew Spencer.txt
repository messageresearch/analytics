prayer this evening and he has a need that you'd like to take before the lord amen amen god sees each and every one of your hearts father we come before you boldly lord jesus lord and we invite you to come lord jesus and take the pulpit at this time father we invite you father the god of heaven and earth lord to come and minister to your children here by the power of your word father we ask that you would visit them lord according to your goodness and grace father every uplifted hand father every heart lord you see their desire father we're asking lord that you would be god over the service

you would just pour out your blessings upon your children tonight sick and afflicted needs in their body lord those that are on the ways of the internet father we're asking lord that you'd make yourself known unto them lord to to everyone near and far father may the spirit of the living god speak unto them by the power of your word in the name of the lord jesus christ and the bride said amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of joel chapter 2 and verse 23 then down revelations chapter 10 it's glad to be back in the house of the lord and be back here with our family it's always a blessing to go but it's an even greater blessing to be able to come back and and uh the lord certainly moved in a very special way there at the meetings there in ohio and we've seen just some supernatural things take place that that only the lord could do and and that's the one that we're fellowshipping with here this evening and i just like to before we go to the word i'd like to just make a mention well let's just read the scripture and i'll let you be seated and then we'll make a few comments on that if that's all right we don't want to leave you standing too long amen joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause you it will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent amongst you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that it does wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions revelations chapter 10 and verse 1. and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord as we said we we certainly are privileged to to be able to stand here and to say that we had a supernatural meeting last week in there at brother ray erickson's their their youth camp there and if you have not seen that you can go and watch that uh on the on the youtube there at true word tabernacle and i believe it will be a great benefit and we just seen some supernatural things take place even in our mo our own youth group here and just very special things that we've been able to be a part of and just one thing that i'd like to make mention to you that we realize that the spirit of the lord is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and and it was a real honor to stand there with my my buddy brother tim timothy pruitt and to to watch the spirit of the lord use him and to see what the lord was doing and brother timothy was preaching on friday night on the light the chain breaker and if you listen to it just bear with us but you you are your witness to these things but brother timothy was speaking on the the light the chain breaker and man it was it was just supernatural and the spirit of the lord just come down in a supernatural way there in that service and there there was a prayer line that formed at the at the altar there and every night there was a prayer line basically and the lord really the lord really did some major deliverances and we watched the spirit of the lord fill young people and change their lives and do everything that we ask him to do and while brother timothy brother timothy was in he was in one portion of the prayer line i was in the other and the spirit of the lord began to speak to him go back up there and finish the quote that you were reading and he was he was reading on that quote on you remember when brother branham he talks about he talks about those that were in those chains and they were in those bars there and he said house of hell give way in the name of the lord jesus christ and and brother timothy i wasn't aware what was happening because just where we were but brother timothy began to speak those things and i didn't even realize what was happening but he was standing there and he was preaching he was preaching that thought on he was relaying the rest of that quote there that house of hell give way in the name of jesus christ and you remember in that quote brother burnham said that he said and all of a sudden i heard a cracking and a popping and and and all of them and they began to scream delivered well i wasn't aware exactly what was happening but there was there was a physical change in the building and there were demons that were beginning to run for cover that were running back and forth because the spirit of the living god had broke chains there it was an amazing thing to be a part of and demons were running back and forth and the spirit of the living god was setting his children free my brother timothy had been taken away he'd been taken away from the meeting he was he was wore out and was going out the building he was in the he was on a golf cart with brother ronnie and the spear of the lord told him said you've got another chain to go break and he was already outside of the building but he come back in there and he said the devil has been telling our young girls you can go and listen to it and tell you if i'm telling you the truth he said but the devil's been telling our young girls that they're not beautiful and they're ugly he said but the bible said that you are fearfully and wonderfully made well at that very moment there was a there was a sister that was there praying about these certain things about these complexes and those things said lord if you're for me have brother timothy come back out have brother timothy come back out and speak exactly those things and the spirit of the living god took brother timothy pruitt and used him we'll say this that he is still the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart i tell you we serve a very living god he's amazing it's amazing to be a witness to what we are witnessing right here in this hour and i'd like to speak to you this evening on a part two of what the the lord dealt with us there on on that saturday night on something that he opened unto us that that we hadn't been looking at but specifically for that meeting but the lord has directed us and i'd like to speak to you tonight on when heaven turns loose part two and if you haven't heard part one you can go and listen to it but i'm gonna i'm gonna preach it to you so you're not in left field and you don't know if you haven't listened to it but those that have listened to it i'm not going to preach the same sermon again but yeah and i'm going to hit some points again and so if you hear what i've already said you just know where to say amen at is that all right how many how many was able to listen to that service there all right well praise the lord we'll preach to you i know you were there but we'd like to speak to you tonight on when heaven turns loose revelations 10 and 1 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples nations and tongues and kings now i want you to recognize that we're very aware of where we're living at is as a church of the living god we recognize that what we are seeing in revelations 10 is not just any angel but this is the lord jesus christ that has descended that has descended in what we witnessed up there in sabine canyon that was not jesus but that was the spirit of christ that was descending on the church that was coming to deliver the the seven seals to the church to roll back everything that had held her back of all the creeds and all the dogmas and all the ideas that had been dead had been bound up here the spirit of the living god would work through the ministry of malachi 4 to go in there and to tie back those loose sins all of those things that had been broken off and those things that have been taken and you watch history that history there were men like there were men like wesley and men like luther and they'd work through there but there were things that were still broken up but there the spirit of the living god would prophesy that there we would have a prophet in this generation that it would restore back restore the faith back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers and we recognize tonight that the angel of the covenant is standing right here and is with this message and he's not going to leave this church he's not going to back off of this message but the angel of the lord is the angel of the covenant and he's here with this message and to make sure that this bride makes it all the way in the rapture he's not he's not settled or he's not going with just a halfway of you barely living on overcoming life but the angel of the covenant is here to make sure that you get who you are recognizing who you are in the lord jesus christ recognizing your position in the body of jesus christ and brother branham would tell us that in the last days and that that the spirit of the living god would come and satan would hate the very revelation that this bride is under because it would make her an invincible army and you recognize why all hell is against this message but we recognize that all of heaven is behind this message is that right so we recognize that revelations 10 is our mighty angel which is none other than jesus christ and he's standing right here at the pulpit tonight he's standing right here and if you'll recognize that you're in his presence tonight he will release the power of the holy ghost over your life that's what brother madam said in recognizing or the presence of god unrecognized he said if we could only realize that he is appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose he said that's to release our desires that we have in him and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest and what a powerful thing tonight to recognize that all of your desires that you have in jesus can be released right here when you recognize the very word of god being made manifest right here before you and to think that if you have a desire for healing if it's in christ god will release it to you if you recognize his presence if you have a desire for the baptism of the holy ghost or a furtherance of the kingdom of god or or a closer walk or something specific god will release your desires in your heart if you will set here under the power of the holy ghost and recognize that this is our lord jesus christ that is manifesting himself once again in body flesh i'll say this that the word was made flesh and the word was made flesh and it dwelt amongst us but i'll say this the word was made flesh and the flesh is made word and i'll say that what you are seeing is a body of believers that is operating under the power of the mighty angel she's not just stepping off where she doesn't know she's not stepping off on things that she doesn't understand but she is a people that have had an open book that has been given unto her and all of heaven has come down to show her that heaven is back behind her now we know that william branham told us about that light he told us about that light ever since his birth he was there at his birth we recognized that it was there when he was a little child we recognized he was there in 1933 we recognized that that light followed him and once since for two thousand years the very pillar fire that led the children of israel is back at the church of the living god i want you to know that whatever you have need of he will release to you power to heal power to save power to open up your minds if you'll just recognize that this is him now you remember i'm not i'm not going to quote the whole thing to you but you remember when danny henry was there after brother man after brother branham had stood there at the full gospel businessman and he had preached this powerful message there and danny henry came to him and you know the story but danny henry came to him and he came there and he said brother branham he said your message could be that of revelations 23 he said i don't mean that to sound sacrilegious sacrilegious he said but that could be revelations 23 well you know there's only one revelations 22 but he was saying it was so perfectly in line with the bible that it could be that of revelations 23 and you remember what the spirit of the lord when he said that danny henry began to speak in an unknown tongue that he'd never known before and these words were spoke he said because of thy momentous decision a huge portion of heaven will await you now we realize that brother branham is not good brother branham is he is going to be in heaven but we recognize that just because of his momentous decision that he doesn't get a bigger house in heaven he's not getting a bigger mansion in heaven he's not getting a bigger slot in heaven but he was saying that heaven has come down there's a huge portion of heaven that is here in this building tonight and i know this there's some that'll sit here and miss what is happening but i'll say this that heaven is in this building tonight all of heaven is backing up the body of jesus christ and i'll say this as jesus stood there in matthew 28 and 19 that all power in heaven and in earth is given unto me i'll say all of heaven is right here all of heaven is right here hallelujah notice what what what jesus said in matthew 18 he said that matthew 18 and 18 he said verily i say unto you that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now think about this right here you've got desires in your heart as we've already said you've got things in your life and there's things that are binding you that are holding you back in your own personal walk is that right there's certain little things that you've allowed to creep in steal away your joy and steal away your peace and steal away your actual love for the lord jesus christ but there is power in unity tonight when you come under the anointed word you can stand there as a believer this is jesus's words he said whatsoever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth i'll loose in heaven i'll say god loose the holy ghost in this place loose healing in this place loose deliverance in this place we've got lost loved ones god we bind them where they are and we lose heaven to go to them [Applause] heaven's here the anointing is here the pillar of fire is here the supernatural almighty god that walked with abraham is here the one that led isaac is here the one that led jacob is here the one that he wrestled with is here the one joseph met in a dungeon is here i know i know it may be a little hard for you to understand but the same angel that william bran a metaphor in that cave is right here whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven i was listening the other day on trying to do god a service without being in his will and you go through it is a very powerful service but at the very beginning of that service brother branham brother barron begins to talk about brother richard blair you you've heard him you've heard him talk about it and actually brother homer fraser our former pastor my granddaddy he had something very supernatural happen maybe i'll just i'll just drop that in right here maybe you don't really maybe some of you don't haven't heard this story but one time brother richard blair which was well you'll hear brother adam talk about him many times throughout the message but brother brother homer and brother ronald they were up there at royce shrewsbury's church up there in west virginia and richard blair was sitting there and the spirit of the lord fell on gran my granddaddy homer fraser and told him that before the night's over richard blair would die before he got back home brother homer went and told brother royce roosevelt and that's exactly what happened i'll say the spirit of the lord is here it wasn't nothing it was just it was simply that god was showing showing that there's still gifts in the body he was still showing us that heaven is backing up but but but to get back to the story here but richard blair richard blair excuse me richard blair had he was helping a brother and he was wiring up a trailer and they had reversed they had reversed some things when they were wiring it up and when they reversed it it sent an electrical shock back into the water where there was a little boy back there that was playing back here that was playing and that richard blair he said i couldn't get a hold of brother madam he said but i remembered what matthew 18 and 20 said that that whatsoever you bind on earth i bind in heaven and where two or three are gathered in my name there i will be in the midst of them and to think that right there that man that little boy that had died by that electrical shock and his stomach had blown up and all of these things because of that electrical shock he was completely dead he said but i remembered what you s what the bible said that i'll be there in the midst of them and because he remembered what the scripture said heaven was loosed and that little boy had come back to life brother branham said it was a blessed thing for that man to believe that because he got his son back and i'll say this you're blessed tonight to believe that i am in the midst of the church of the living god i'm telling you that whatever you have need of ask and you shall receive i'm telling you you ain't gonna be afraid to ask small things and you ain't gonna be afraid to ask big things ask big things ask that your joy might be full i don't believe it's too hard to ask for a house i don't believe it's too hard to ask for a job i don't believe it's too hard to ask for this or ask for that if you ask and your desire's right and your motive's right and all of heaven gets behind it i'll say heaven will open up and pour out a blessing that you won't be able to understand [Applause] what was it richard blair was a lived voice and that's what brother branham said is that what we need is oh what we need in jeffersonville is thousands of live voices he said that's the thunder he said that's the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christian he said that's the thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can how much you can do this or shout he said but what hurts the devil now i'm going to tell you what there's one thing i like finding out is what hurts the death hallelujah i'm going to drop it to you a little bit later maybe on but brother branham said it's a death stroke to satan when man takes god at his word he said it's the hardest hitting that satan can ever get it's when man takes god at his word i'll say this if joshua could stand there and stop the son and didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost what i like me to do as a church of the living god who have his voice the voice of resurrection is in the body let's hurt satan tonight let's turn hell on notice we have come to take over [Applause] i get sick and tired of the devil pushing us around let's hurt hell they pushed us around all our life they pushed you around all your life let's start pushing hell back with all of heaven you're not doing this on your own you are a people that are sitting here under the auspices of the holy ghost push them back don't let them push you push them back when you watch a when you watch a day i'm going to get back to the quote in a little bit but i'm going to preach just here for a moment but when you watch your daddy any any and that daddy is trying to get his son to perform in maybe an athletic maybe in sports or maybe a football or baseball that man will go out there and he'll tell him now son you go out there and show him what you can do it's not a time to hold back son if you can throw 95 mile an hour it's a time to release what you can do it's not a time to hold it back it's a time to show it out i'll say church of the living god it's time that we show hail what we can do we're not a weak christian we're not a weak church we are the most powerful people that's upon the face of the earth father let's show the world what you can do you can heal you can save you can deliver you can set free let's show them what you can do father [Applause] but what hurts the devil what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be move and move right on oh that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil that real sanctified consecrated holy life you can say anything about them but they'll still move right on that's what hurts the devil you can have your best friend say something about you but what hurts the devil is when you sit there like jesus oh it's time that we start living out what this message is it's time that we sit here under the greatest message and not just sit quiet but we live out the message sound off the message sometimes it's in speaking sometimes it's in silence but every day it's a life that's the thunder that shakes the devil lived voices now paul said in first corinthians he told us he thought he's talking about he's talking about the first man that he was earthy he said but the second man was of the heavenly is that right he said but we have borne the image of the earth he said but also we bear the image of the heavenly and to think that tonight that brother branham would preach a sermon on images of christ and that here she is how many had a good old tussle this week found out you were still human not me brother andrew but all of heaven is still sitting there mad at the world got a temper you could fight a bus saw with but all of heaven's right there and when you would go too far when you would almost say too much the holy spirit said not today you're not going back to that kind of life you're not going back to that kind of language the holy spirit is under is fulfilling its purpose and controlling your life ain't no wonder paul would stand there in romans 8 and 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit [Music] but when paul when paul starts breaking into the hebrews and start laying the later the letter down to the hebrew church what do you see he's sitting there and he says he said christ didn't come and take upon the nature of angels but he took upon the seed of abraham because he loved you so much he didn't take upon the form of an angel he took upon the seed of abraham to feel like you to have pain like you to understand like you what was heaven doing heaven and earth had met when the lamb and the dove met together heathered an earth kiss what is this what is this body it's heaven on earth now you've already witnessed to me that you've had tussles and you already found out that you were human but when you found out you're human there was another element that showed up i know i know that i'm talking to the right group here tonight when you got flustered all of a sudden you said wait a minute something's not right and you begin to create an atmosphere you begin to create an atmosphere what's the greatest way to create an atmosphere is to worship the living god and all of heaven comes down and it starts pushing hell right out of your way what is it it's exactly it's exactly what joel 2 said that in the last days i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh now brother branham goes in there and here's what i think's amazing here's a hillbilly kentuckian with a seventh grade education can't hardly write his own name if you read his notes you can't hardly make him out but he goes in there and he starts breaking into the greek breaking into hebrews and breaking into breaking into the bible and he says now we can't read it like we read it in the english we've got to read it in the original greek he said if we say that poor he said for us he said it means to empty out he said but for us it would be like to vomit up or give something that was not of herself he said but in the last days i will pour out my spirit he said what was he doing he himself poured himself into the church he said god can't change in his nature he simply changes his form because he's still the same yesterday today and forever he said now you look he said he said when i he said when i became a husband he said he said i changed my form he said but when i had a baby he said i became my daddy he said but when i had my grandchildren he said then i took on the form of a granddaddy he said i was still the same person he said i was still the same person he said i simply changed forms he said but you take a 16 year old man he can never be under that law or never be under that form of a granddaddy he's got to go on in years so that he could produce that is that right he said but what you're looking at he said it's the same yesterday today and forever that pillar fire that led the children of israel is the same pillar of fire that's back in the church of the living god he's pouring out himself and he's simply changing his mask what was once in jesus he's now in a body you are his victory that's what brother branham said in christ the mystery of god revealed he said when you see christ coming and living down in his church working out in his church he said you are his victory and to think that you are doing exactly what he said in john 14 and 12 that my works you'll do these same exact things it's not your works it's the works of the father the other night i i woke up to a scene that was rather strange to me i woke up and in my room was a bunch of runners and i thought it was rather strange because these runners that i was seeing they were dressed different from the other runners and i wasn't shown every group but i was shown this scene of these runners they were dressed different and they had a baton in their hand and in their hand it had appointed the message i thought lord that's this group what he was showing me in the spiritual spiritual we're watching in the natural you are the final runners you are sitting here under the final messenger and you are running with a message you are the final voice you're not just operating outside of the message you are the message you are that pillar fires in you you are the mighty angel christ revealed i'll say this you've got a message to run with you're dressed a little bit different than luther was you're dressed different than wesley was but you're running listen well i don't feel like i am let me tell you just put the garment on and start stepping in tune to the marching music run with everything that's within you lay aside every weight in sin heaven's here and when you run out of energy he never runs out of energy when you run out i hope he never runs out of hope when you run out when you run out of desire he's never run out of desire when you've run out of strength he's never run out of strength just run i ain't got to stand here and i ain't got to preach to you every single thing and describe it and teach it out what the seven seals are you are the seventh seal now if you go listen to your message you'll find i'm teaching you william branham's teachings you are you are the third full purpose of the seventh seal this is christ the mystery of god revealed once again in body form that's why he's appearing to you is to show you who you are this is the bride coming of christ little by little moses said i'll give you the land so they don't overtake you little by little you're changing little by little you're growing little by little you're mocking more in line excuse me now what mother brandon said what has the greatest authority an angel from heaven or an angel at the pulpit doesn't the bible say in hebrews that his angels are ministering spirits flames of fire what has more power an angel in heaven or an angel at the pulpit tell us brother branham he said it's the angel at the pulpit he said paul said if an angel from heaven comes and preaches any other gospel to you then that which i've already preached he said let him be accursed he said so the angel anointed with the holy spirit and with the word stands next to god that's right in heaven his authority he said all power in heaven and earth is given unto my hand go and i'll go with you and whatever you bind on earth i'll bind in heaven and whatever you loose on earth i'll loosen heaven he said oh if the great holy church only realized his power to do these things he said but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling wondering if it could if it could happen he said as long as that exists the church can never stand upright he said and when every talk of fear is vanished and the holy spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and that church has the power who is that church now you know i ain't gonna preach without you who is that church you know ain't just talking about the preachers you know i ain't just talking about the ministers you know ain't just talking about the deacons you know ain't just talking about the ushers surely i'm talking about somebody else in this building it ain't just the musicians it ain't just of the tambourine players it ain't just the hand clappers it's a little children this is a church of the living god [Applause] he said but when every talk of fear is vanished and the holy spirit is completely in control of the church then all fears are gone and oh and that a church has the power why they have everything the heaven owns behind them they're ambassadors of the throne an ambassador of christ has the authority and everything that christ owns belongs to that ambassador and he said go ye in all the world you are my witnesses after the holy ghost has come upon you and what is a witness it's an ambassador it's to come and witness something he said the whole powers of heaven is right in your hands i've already read to you the scripture in matthew 18 that any two or three gathered in my name there i'll be in the midst of them and if two of you agree touching one thing let it be done i believe there is power in these words i happen to believe that if you stood there right now that heaven is so close to you that you could bind your hearts together in christian love and you could watch the miraculous take place that's why he's here the omnipotence is behind this message the all-powerful is behind this message the miraculous is here it's time that you start taking your word not just god's word but your word and start accessing all of heaven that means got a real need a real need you don't have to wait for next weekend's labor day meeting heaven's right here the anointing's right here there's many of you that got spiritual needs and heaven is right here i watched young girls last weekend get filled with the baptism of the holy ghost so why can't he do it right here i watched prodigals return last weekend so why that can't they happen right here i watched plantar fasciitis completely dissolved so why can't it happen right here we watch sugar diabetes completely healed why can't it happen right here come on somebody we watched pinched nerves completely common hinged why can't it happen right here a huge portion of heaven but oh maybe you don't have enough faith for a huge part but maybe just to crumb maybe you're a crumb seeker for a little bit of heaven tonight i believe that if you'll have the right heart god will come by your way i know i don't watch too much of the supernatural to stand back and say god don't do it no more i've done i've been stood back and i've watched as we lay hands on the sick they've completely restored i've watched as we lay hands that demons are cast out i've come too far to tell for that the enemy to come and start squeezing down on the church of the living god and say those things don't happen no more heaven is here and brother branham said in the junction of time he said when all hell is turned loose oh heaven turns loose it's time we're seeing the lid of hell kicked off let's see heaven opened up hell's on a rampage just look at the news you see a new elvis rising on the scene you see all kinds of turmoil rising on the scene it's prophesied that it would be here but you've been prophesied that you'd be here look at revelations 9 look at matthew 24 that false christ and false prophets would rise up we're here he got that picture that first picture i ain't got my glasses on i can't tell if that's just jewelry up there it is praise the lord says joy if you can throw that first picture on for us now you know that brother branham told us in christ a mystery god revealed he said it was once though anointed man he said but now it's the anointed people anointed by what by accepting what eve turned down but if we've been anointed by accepting what eve turned down you watch brother random comes and he preaches on the anointed ones at the end time there's an anointed group that's anointed by rejecting what he's turned down and you watch you watch what you have you see the very benefits why you ex of accepting the message what it's produced your bone of his bone your life of his life power of his power but you watch what's watch those men and you watch those spirits that spirit of rejection to turn against the message and turn against the power and turn against the preaching of the word you watch the life that comes behind the rejection it's not that of christ it's that of the false anointed ones but you remember in 1950 they challenged our prophet they challenged our prophet they challenged him and said that he was a divine healer and was saying all these things and brother branham said you remember brother man i'm saying i'm not no more a divine healer than more than i'm a divine savior and you remember brother bosworth he said no he said let me he said i won't go down there and argue with him he says but i'll just take the scriptures but you notice what the media put on here they put f bosworth he upholds miracles reverend william branham a faith healer but notice reverend w e best it is the baptist plural champion so here is their champion standing against these davids and they were refuting and refusing to accept that the god of miracles was still living and they challenged they challenged him dr bosworth brother bosworth stood right there and he told him he said you answer me this question it's jehovah of the old testament jesus christ of the new and he couldn't answer him a word he said but i believe william branham's in the building he said maybe he'll come he said i don't know and brother brandon was up there to disguise sitting in that balcony with his wife and his brother and those policemen and those guards watching over him and he and his brother doctor said don't go down there but the spirit of the lord said you go down there bill you go down there and the angels god the angels guarded that aisle as william branham stepped down through there and he walked through sam houston coliseum good evening friends and you know how brother branham handled things and he stood right there and he started saying a few words and all of a sudden he said i felt a churning over top of my head and the wind blowing around go [Music] he said now he's here we're annoying it by accepting what this pillar of fire led us to that's what jesus told us what the what what the holy spirit was it would be a holy spirit to be the truth and it would be our comforter and it would be our god the holy spirit has guided us to this message it was not some evil spirit that led you to this message it was the spirit of the living god and you didn't get here because your mom and daddy birthed you into this and just because you you grew up knowing this the spirit of the living god led you to this and he wanted to make sure that you knew that you knew that you knew that it was real so the pillar of fire came and it changed the situation in your life go ahead sister zorya and our critics dr beth said you have a photographer he hired a photographer to stand there he said you take a picture of me pointing my finger in dr bosworth's face or william branham's face and that photographer took ten pictures and none of them produced except for this one it was not us that took that picture it was our critics that are anointed to reject it and for once since 2000 years the pillar of fire is back you are led by that pillar of fire you're anointed to accept it you're anointed to worship you're anointed to declare war you're anointed to praise god you're anointed to tear satan's kingdom down you're anointed to prophesy you're anointed to take the little book you're anointed to win i know jehovah's here to lead us all the way let the musicians go he's here he's not just here he's not just standing here but he's here it's here somebody say all of heaven is here all of heaven is here you're anointed to fulfill this word you're anointed to overcome you're anointed for the rapture pillar of fire is going to make sure you make it that pillar of fire is the same one that was with moses in that bull rush said now gabriel if he gets in trouble if he gets in a whirlpool you step on there and you get him out of that trouble i say that same pillar of fire is here to make sure that you can't get into something that you can't handle on your own he's here to take care of your situations i ask you this church he's anything too hard for the lord [Music] is anything too hard for the lord i know some of you i know some of you this might be a little bit over your head but you are the final generation and you know you might be sitting there saying well i don't understand everything that you preach tonight brother andrew that pillar of fire is here to lead you through the word i had no knowledge and i forgive me for being a little bit elementary right here i had no knowledge of this bible i've read it all my days and you watch a young person their favorite book is psalms because that's all they can really understand ain't nothing wrong with it i still love it read about four or five psalms every single day i had really no knowledge of it [Music] but in 15 years i still don't hardly know anything about him but he's the one that led me through the scriptures my daddy didn't give me this i had a great mentor and i had a great coach and brother homer brother charlie brother ron but they couldn't give us this you look at brother william look at brother matthew which one is doing you watch it weekend after weekend time after time the spirit of the lord working through this minister and working through that minister and it's the spirit of the lord leading them what is it it's heaven coming down to make sure that you get what you need i'm gonna i'm gonna end on this this thought right here when elijah was up there [Music] and all of heaven had been shut up he shut up the heavens for three and a half years no rain [Music] and everybody else was in famine but elijah was up there and feast brother branham said he had some porters that were coming up there and dropping off dropping off sandwiches up there and he was feeding right there at the brook of tereth all those days heaven was taken care of the prophet and the man challenged brother brown said now you really don't believe you really don't believe that those those crows or those porters fed him sandwiches so where could they have got them at he said i don't know where they got him at he said all i know is is that they were feeding him and he said there's a lot of people that sit around and say well why are they shouting like they do why are they acting like they do he said i can't explain it he said but it's the rain it's the manna that's falling upon them that's making them shout and maybe you don't understand why you're feasting where you're feasting at but heaven has dropped down this food in this season for you to feed on i'll tell you if you keep feeding on it your body's going to change you keep feeding on it your life is going to change you keep feeding on it you're going to watch you're going to watch your loved ones step into the door because you kept feeding on it there's an angel that is here with this message to make sure that you don't miss it don't miss it search don't miss it i'll tell you what a blessed story it is i think we could praise the lord just for a moment don't you want you lift your hands right there and let's sing this on blessed assurance jesus is mine oh this is my story [Music] oh this is my story this is my soul i'm crazy [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] around [Music] you see
