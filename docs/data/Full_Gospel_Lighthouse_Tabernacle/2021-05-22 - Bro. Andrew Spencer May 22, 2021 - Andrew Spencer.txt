would rather do i love you lord worshiping you o worshiping and you make it easy lord cause i'm so in love hallelujah what a love affair that's going on between the bride and the bridegroom what a special time that we're in it's wedding season there's a much ado about full gospel lighthouse there's many things that are taking place and transpiring and uh all that is due to a wedding that's coming forward a lot of work's being done on the landscape and a lot of work's being done in the fellowship hall and we want to thank brother jim he's putting the final touches on the fellowship hall appreciate him doing all that for us and it looks amazing and looking forward to the time when we can all be back in there together and uh but there's something else that's going on all this is because a wedding has taken place all the stirring on the inside of the bride is because there's a wedding taking place i believe what a prophet said that he slept that he slipped that wedding band of unmerited grace upon your finger before the foundation of the world and i'm happy to say i'm his i'm already taken and man we're certainly thankful to have the west and the davises with us tonight we just want to say god bless you thank you for being here with us always an honor to have you here and and uh as you said it's been a little bit where we're always we're family been family for a very long time and uh so thankful that we're going to be family for eternity amen we just love you love the lord if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of romans chapter 8. book of romans chapter 8 i'm going to start again with verse 1. we'd like to speak to you again on on the realm the realm of of a believer ma'am tomorrow tomorrow after uh the service will be having communion here so you can be preparing your hearts for those things just be praying about that and uh certainly looking forward to this weekend and i'll be certainly thankful we're in about next 45 minutes to an hour because the lord's had me shook up all day long but i believe god's got something to say to us tonight amen it's always good when he passes by our way romans chapter 8 and verse 1 and the bible says that there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit if you're going down to verse 14 the bible says here for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god now what led you here this evening that shows you who you are for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ab our father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together let's just speak to the lord just now heavenly father we come and approach the throne of mercy lord one more time lord as we humble ourselves in the presence of the lord we we just ask god for a special move of the holy spirit lord you see these things lord that you've placed upon my heart lord jesus and i i just asking lord that you would set me aside just for a few moments in time to speak to your children father you see the needs that are amongst us the hearts lord jesus that need a real a real refilling of the holy ghost lord those that are that are carrying burdens lord that seem too much but may they come and lay them down at the feet of jesus tonight lord as you pass by our way lord i pray that we be careful to reach out and touch you lord help me to do a good job and get out of the way in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated in the presence of the lord this evening it's an amazing thing as children that we as children of god we we are influenced by another realm we are influenced by by this book we are influenced by his spirit and we know that that the more we read this book the more we begin to look like the author of this book and you can watch as a child as they begin to walk that you can notice certain characteristics how they walk and how they handle themselves that they're picking up different things that are passed down through their genealogy and how they handle themselves and how they move and there's certain things that you just can't you just can't make up but it's just birthed down through a bloodline and characteristics are passed down and the bible says here that we walk not after the flesh but we walk after the spirit and we realize that today that we're living in a very powerful time as sons and daughters of god but we're living in a very odd time but we know that we're living and what brother branham would say that we're living in two worlds and we can be walking right here in the midst in the midst of laodicea and we can realize that there are two worlds that are going on there's a world that's more real than this world that is sitting here and in that world everything is perfect in that world in that world our law our loved ones are there and and i find it amazing that brother branham would say about our loved ones he said they're only as far away as you make them and you remember you remember when when brother branham was after his wife mita after her mother had passed away and she was just having a real hard time with it and brother branham began to speak to her he said honey he said it may not be necessarily something that you can understand he said but your mother he said it may not be something you understand he said but your mother is sitting right over there on the couch so you see it's there that world is right here and they're only as far as we make them now if we realize and brother jason jackson sent me a quote last weekend he said now he said when i go off of the scene brother brandon i'm saying when i go off the scene he said he said and you start singing that song i only believe he said i'll be ever so close he said i'll be there listening at you at you singing that song and he said if i go on he said if i go on you sing that song and i'll be real close now now think about that just for a moment when you begin to think that if that realm if that realm is that close and they're moving just a bit faster than this realm is moving they're in another dimension how much greater as god is he's coming to his children and he's doing his best to get his children out of this dimension into that dimension where we don't worry about things we don't fear about things but i i really believe that tonight that that we're setting in a spot that only believers can walk in we are living in an hour where only the fully adopted sons of god can walk in this hour and they only can tap into the channel of the holy ghost and only the elect can walk there and brother branham would tell us that out of every single revival twins would come up and you see whenever you you try to do things in the carnal realm you'll always produce carnality but any times the spirit realm begins to come and come behind the word of god you will see the real genuine christian believer is produced under that spirit of word under that word of the hour and you remember you remember when abram when he was when he was given a promise that god had promised him that he was going to have a son and throughout throughout his life and here he was when god testified to him at 75 years old that he was going to have a son and his wife 60 years old told them that they were going to have a son and they they hadn't seen anything they hadn't they hadn't seen any movement they hadn't seen any they hadn't seen the spirit move on them for a long time they hadn't felt the anointing of god move on them for a long time so they tried to go into the carnal realm and they produced themselves an ismailite you see when they when they begin to produce an ishmaelite they produced a wild man and we know we know that when abraham and sarah begin to trust in their own human ingenuity and they begin to use hagar to bear the child ishmael that he was born a child of fleshly bondage and any anytime that you try to produce an intellectual conception of this message you will always produce a child of fleshly bondage you see whenever you try to talk somebody in this message you'll there'll somebody else be able to talk them out of this message whenever you try to show them certain things somebody else can show them or show them something else but anytime that the spirit of the living god comes behind something and he puts a stamp of approval upon it it will produce nothing but a genuine son and daughter of god you don't have to work it up you don't have to pump it up you don't have to prime it up because it's what god said that it would be it's not nothing intellectual it's not a wild man it's not a religious man but it's somebody that's been in the arena that somebody that's met melchizedek it's somebody that has met him and they know that he's going to change their body and the same one that changed their body can produce an isaac and if a god can produce an isaac he can produce a realm and if he can produce a realm he can produce a sacrifice and if he can produce a sacrifice he can produce children right here in laodicea that'll come out above every triumph above every temptation above every sickness above every desire and every temptation because we are not of the bondwoman but we are of the free and paul said stand fast in the liberty where christ has made us free he didn't tell us to go back into the world he told us to stand like a man be firm like a man preach like a man live like a man sing like a man love like a man he told us to stand fast therefore in the liberty when christ came to set you free he didn't save you to put you up in some bondage he sets you free he sets you free that you can live this message he sets you free that you could be this message he set you free because the son of man was looking for a body to live in and i say to the church of the living god you are that body hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord now notice notice here and expectancy the brothers have it upstairs he said now what man calls foolish god calls great now what man cause full is god calls great and what just vice versa that's right what god is full of what is foolishness of god seems great to man and what is great to god seems fullness to people you got to get out of the world into a spirit a supernatural realm to understand it certainly you have so you've got to get out of this carnality to break into the realm of the supernatural in jesus on the authority of the word he said now visions make me weak he said you're living in two worlds you're here and then and you're in another world and you can't help that just like you dream to dream with your eyes open he said god does that in sovereign grace not because you asked for it you couldn't ask for it god does it himself before you were born this was set in order by god it's your subconscious scientifically speaking like you dream a dream this conscious is inactive and this one becomes active then when you awake when you're asleep your dreams and things you did here then when you wake up this one is inactive and this one here is active then you remember things that you dreamed of years ago you know what i'm talking about you know what the brother branham is speaking here you dreamed a dream some 20 years ago and there's certain things details in there so so so defined that you know everything about i remember having a dream as a young child i remember having a dream that we were there my papaw charlie's old church and it seemed like it seemed like there was kind of an odd dream but it seemed like i i was down at the i was down at the altar and i was one of i was one of a pen of a bowling ball and a bowling ball this great big black bowling ball kept coming it was a nightmare what it was kept coming and trying to knock me down and i kept having that dream throughout all of my life and there are certain things that i remember about that but i never had that dream ever again when i found the blood you see there are certain things that are active in the subconscious that you're grabbing hold of he said now he said this conscious is inactive and this one becomes active then when you awake when you're asleep you dream things they did here and then when you wake up this one is inactive and this one here is active then you remember things that you dreamed of years ago you were some part of somewhere you were a part of you somewhere some people doesn't dream their subconscious is way back a dreamer doesn't sleep sound and then he can't help it because he dreams but a seer and a seer is neither his subconscious back there nor here is right there he doesn't go to sleep he breaks from one world to another and from the natural to the supernatural now you remember when brother branham went to mayo clinic and they began to speak to him and they began to look at him and tell him that his subconscious and his conscience laid right close together and they said now he said they told him they said no this is a very odd thing and they wanted to study him out and understand some of these things and he said he said now he said i can't make that opry he said only god can make that operate he said he said i began to talk to the doctor and begin to tell them he said he said can you dream me a dream he said neither can i have a vision for you but you see brother branham was breaking into a world and whenever you would hear brother random on tape you'll hear him break into a world he can begin to tell you somebody's past he can tell you what they've been through because he's breaking into a world that was real it was something that had went on in the past and not profit by a divine gift was able to look into that realm and break in there and show them show them their past it's an amazing thing when you go to studying all of those scriptures and studying all the things about prophets and seers down through the old testament and then you see in this last day that there is a prophet that would come and would break into a channel and begin to tell you all about your past but what i love about that is brother branham didn't leave you at that spot in your past but he would also tell you about your future i i try not to get ahead of myself but i want to tell you god's already seen your future now notice he said he said here in jesus christ saying yesterday he said just think it breaks out into another dimension speaking of visions he said out where nobody knows nothing about it it's in a supernatural realm and calls up things that has been done way years ago how can you doubt god now he's speaking to his sister he said throat's better now isn't it sister is that right raise your hand you're healed that's exactly i didn't even tell you what it was it told you what had happened you're healed you're all right god bless you you see there the spirit of the living god was speaking about something that was happening right there in the natural but a supernatural god broke in through a seer and told this sister he told you what had happened whoo hallelujah when brother branham begins to have his first experience with with the second pool and you know what the first pool was that brother random had they had the gift in his hand and in the second pool when brother branham was there in saskatchewan in the queen's garden arena there was a woman that was standing before him he'd seen visions before but this woman this had never happened in his second ministry here the first time this woman standing before him and he said he said now something's happening brother baxter caught what had happened he said now this is what the angel told you about but there he said he said now this sister standing in front of him he said now he said now i i see a little girl that's that's 12 years old and got a school desk she's sitting at a school desk and she's bouncing a pen and the pin flies up and it strikes her in the eye and that sister says hey that was me i'm blind in my right eye and then the vision moves and he said he sees a 16 year old girl running as hard as she could with a ribbon in her hair and a checkered dress he said i said i see you running and you're running from a great big yellow dog that's chasing you and that same sister says that was me that was me and brother random then he said i was looking down at her and i looked back again and he said i seen a lady coming from a white house or a barn red-looking barn coming towards a white house and she had an apron on and holding something like this she was walking slow and i seen her and i said i see a lady coming i said sister it's you that was a normal time then i said i couldn't recognize it he said i could recognize it being the same woman i said now i see the lady you started up the steps and i see there's a flower bed over to your right and the steps go up like this and there's something wrong with your back i see i i see you can't get up the steps and i see and i said you leaned over sideways and you're crying and heard her say if i can ever get to brother branham's meetings it'll be over and then when i said that somebody caught the woman now why would god show him this without having a purpose behind it brother branham said now he's in the absolute brother madam said he said when there was millions out there in the world that was groping and sin and he saved me he said but he had a reason in saving me he said when there was bishops when there was great educational and intellectual people he said but he saved me for a reason he saved me for a reason now he's got a reason in telling you who you are he's got a reason in a prophet saying this is what has happened he's got a reasoning behind it and he said now he said when he said somebody caught that woman and she started to faint he said but when she came to her blind eye was normal her back she could move it anyway her arthritis was fine and she can move her back anyway just perfectly something had happened what was it there a prophet was breaking into a channel of the unseen world and bringing it to a scene world and the results happened because a supernatural god was standing right there he said the only thing that this has done he said and this supernatural has awakened ministers out of the sense bound around into a place where they can see god is present it has awakened ministers out of a sense-bound realm this realm right here it's awakened ministers to see that god is present now brother branham said now the vision don't heal you it just vindicates that his presence is near i can see a vision over top of you tonight but it ain't gonna heal you but it'll tell you that his presence is near [Applause] hallelujah many of you don't know what happened here last weekend but there was a little boy that was having a little bit of trouble standing up on his own and getting his feet underneath of him hadn't really made much movement on walking but there was a vision there was a vision and spoken if you'd only realize what has happened this week sister gabrielle could testify to it what has happened to that little baby this week you would realize that the presence of the living god is ever near who did that who did that brother ron didn't do that the minister didn't do that it was only showing that the presence of the living god is here now i want you to know i can tell you that the vision of the lord god has said that you're going to be there i can tell you that your future is clear i can tell you can look into the word of god and i can tell you by the word of truth that you're going to be there but it ain't gonna do me one bit of good to tell you that if you ain't gonna believe it but if you'll believe it if you'll believe it it'll put you there if you'll believe it your body will get healed if you'll believe it your loved one will be there if you believe it god ain't looking for unbelievers because unbelievers can't walk where the lord walks but he's looking for real rugged men sons daughters of god that ain't scared to stand toe-to-toe with the devil right in the midst of laodicea when hell seems to be on a fury there is a real people called by his name that ain't ashamed to stand up for god you know what it's like being in this presence and the realities of god become realities of you brother and would preach a sermon called the unfailing realities of god but you know what it's like to be standing in this presence and the power of his presence comes and he begins to woo to you it begins to call to you you begin to make love with him and all of a sudden you begin to see a great move of the holy ghost sometimes when he moves he moves with a great shout sometimes when he moves there's a holy hush on the people sometimes he'll move in this place he'll begin to move in this place and you'll begin to see wherever you are when the presence of god you'll begin to see a milky a milky film that begin to set over the top of the crowd and that cloud just seems to come down over top of the people when you begin to see the move of the holy spirit what you're watching is that god has settled down over top of his children and that god is about to do something and you're getting ready to watch the invisible made visible and when you begin to recognize his presence you see you see it's one thing if you recognize me it's one thing if you recognize brother ron but if you recognize him it will release a power to your situation are you with me when the woman in the bible recognize that the son of god was coming by her way she she called out said lord lord even even the master gets the the the children get to eat of the bread that falls off the masters table and she began to talk to him he didn't move one time when she called him the son of david but when she called him her lord then his attention got turned over to the situation because she recognized that this was him and if you could recognize that you are in the presence of jehovah it will release a power over your situation if you'll begin to recognize that he's moving in this place like he's never moved because god when god moves he's got a purpose in his movement god don't move just to move he don't move just for a show he don't move just for an act but when he moves brother adam said his children move with him and if you're ashamed to move on with god god will leave you right where you're at but in the spirit of the living god moves his children move with it and if you're willing to move this morning willing to move this evening if you're willing to get out of your cold dead cold formal religion if you're willing to move out of the things that's held your bounds if you're willing to move you're willing to move you'll begin to recognize this is him you'll watch things start trans transplant transforming in front of your life unfolding and things will begin to be made manifest in front of you last weekend last weekend brother malachi come up here and he was sitting he was sitting here to play he was sitting he came up here and sings and before he got up here and singing he was sitting down and he was reading his bible like a real christian does before church and he's sitting down there and reading his bible and somebody sat down beside him it wasn't gabriel it was the angel of the lord he hit gabriel and said hey he just sat down here beside me if you could only realize that he's wanting to sit down beside you and just begin to talk it over with you this evening all your burdens will be gone if you can just talk it over with jesus it's a real paradox to the world today that people actually believe what the bible says and then they live out what the bible says it's a paradox they can't understand how in the world you dress like that how you act like that how you talk like that how you walk like that it's a paradox but it's true and i want to say to you that i have proof that the pillar of fire is right here in our midst tonight it ain't a manifestation of a of a tumor leaving it ain't a manifestation of cancer leaving though that could be possible but yet i want to prove to you that the pillar of fire is back in the church of the living god when we see a young people standing up and saying hey i'm sick and tired i'm sick and tired of this depression spirit i'm sick and tired of this layout of seeing flu that makes me cold and formal and grabbing hold of my life when young people now you that's been sitting here for years and years and years it's an amazing thing for you to still be sitting here but when church of the living god when your young people is sitting in a place when there is 10 times more demons that are out after your young people it's a proof that the pillar of fire is right here in our midst because a young people start casting down imaginations and they start living what this word is and say hey i'm sick and tired of this i'm sick and tired of living this way let me have the holy ghost let me have the blessings of god let the joy of the lord fill my soul when the world wants a social gospel where they can come and go and say please there's a young people there's a young people that still believe in this old-fashioned gospel there's a young people say give me you he's here amongst us i don't believe that he ought to allow it to become common to us he's here you see when people begin to let things become common to them that's when they start missing what he's doing but we should never take it for granted that he moves in a service like yes i've seen him move over top of a situation standing right here in surfaces like this and the holy ghost began to dissolve tumors in a sermon like this i was in a i was in a meeting one time i was in a meeting one time down in south carolina and there was a brother that was facing impossible impossible circumstances in a human realm and they and their the voice of god began to speak over him and says now there's a light over top of you and i heard the man of god saying i don't know what your problems are but god does and that man that was a great man began slain in a spirit because the purifier was present i was one time in a meeting down in murfreesboro tennessee down in a banquet and it was kind of a odd setting but then by meaning it was an odd setting because there became a a prayer line or an altar call out a banquet most time at a banquet and most time in the banquet you're introducing somebody in christ and they're here at a banquet they begin to have a prayer line and there's these young people begin to make a half moon and they begin to gather around they just kind of made their own alter and it was inside of an old barn that they'd turn into a place a beautiful place turn it into a banquet i will tell you god i'll meet you in a barn he'll meet you in the car he'll meet you in the church he'll meet you in your bedroom he'll meet you in your house and there in that in that barn where we was having that banquet and young people just like you got sitting right here they began to gather around and the spirit of the living god began to call out situations and call out certain needs and all of a sudden there was a sister that was fighting depression and a suicidal spirit and the sooner the spirit of the living god called out that thing a pillar of fire the pillar of fire stepped out over top of that little daughter and come running right down behind me and went over behind sister sister harmon and brother joseph's wife and the purifier come down and rolled through that place and that girl left there delivered he was proving that the pillar fire is greater than suicide and i want to say to you that the pillar of fire is still greater than suicide he's greater than anxiety he's greater than depression he's greater than cancer [Applause] i was praying with a young boy one time down in north carolina i'm using these illustrations or the events so i don't have to call out your situation i was praying for this young boy one time down in north carolina hey come up he come up after i had an altar call this young boy come up and there was a witchcraft spirit upon him and a rebellion spirit and all of a sudden the spirit of god began to speak directly to him and call out certain things that only he would know about and i watched as that light as that light began to move and there began to be an opening for an opening for the spirit of god to move in but then i watched the darkness the darkness of that witchcraft spirit began to try to threads thrush out and push out the spirit of god and because that young boy didn't accept the liberty of christ he walked away with that witchcraft spirit upon him i'm only telling you this that it's all what you accept here tonight you can walk away completely delivered you can walk away all the answers of the message completely settled in your life you can walk away but it depends on what you give yourself to now you can turn on a tv and you can push a button and you can bring it into a certain channel but before it ever got on that channel it had to fly through an airwave and that channel is tapped in in such a way that it brings it down so you can see it now i want to break into a world and bring it down where you can see it that by his stripes you are healed to him that overcometh will i grant to set with me in my throne if you can see it there's a channel open for you to walk into [Applause] hallelujah brother man would say now out in front of you is a well body all you got to do is walk to it all you got to believe is walk into it and step into that well body and if you're sick you can walk right into that well body this week on monday i believe it's monday we send our word to you that we need to go to prayer for brian lamb that they were calling in the family and doctors are amazed or amazed five days later why because there is power in prayer now god's not just wanting to heal this fleshly body he's wanting to heal a soul [Applause] hallelujah notice and he swore by himself he said he said now just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk as you walk in christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right or the left hand just moving on if something keeps coming up if something comes up in the church walk with god hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with god if the neighbor don't like you walk with god just keep walking with god enoch one day walked like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with god god he got so far up the road that he didn't want to come back home anymore walk with god doctor says you're going to god you're going to die walk with god doctor says you can't get well walk with god just walk with god that's all for god has promised you that i'll never leave you i'll not forsake you i'll be with you even to the end of the world and he took an oath by that covenant that he give you that he confirmed it just walk with god if enoch could walk in such a way before the baptism of the holy ghost was ever given out how much more should the church of the living god that's filled with the spirit of almighty god walk with god you can read over in the book of jude verse 14 and you see that enoch was the seventh from adam and he prophesied of these same behold the lord cometh with ten thousand other saints the things that you're living out enoch prophesied the things that you're seeing enoch prophesied he prophesied of the day you're living in he prophesied that carnal men were satisfied with their condition that they were living in he was there preaching to them a message that took it back to eden you see when when enoch was walking on the earth he was walking on the earth 57 years he walked on the earth with adam and he was living amongst the people that were doomed for destruction but he was walking with god he would talk to adam he began to talk to him and adam could reverse and and converse back to him and tell him that i controlled nature i was able to move things for eve i was able to speak to the wind and the wind would listen to me i could speak to storms and they would move out of the place and enoch as he testified as he walked as he fellowship with adam he began to talk to him about what it was like down there and when he got all of adam's testimony enoch began to preach and he began to preach that there is a perfect eating that was coming he walked with god every single day he walked for god for 365 years in constant fellowship with that eden realm kind of like you and i we're in constant fellowship with a realm that's not of laodicea layout to see it don't know what you're living in and they ought to see it don't know what you're believing in but you are living in a world just like enoch was living in he was walking with doomed people that were on their road to destruction and here you are right here in laodicea walking with people that are headed for the tribulation you're walking with people that are headed for judgment but you are walking with the son of man and a son of man and gonna leave you here he knows exactly where you're at he knocked where he lived and walked so close to god that god could not deny him the rapture i want to say to you that you're living so close to god you're walking so much with god that god cannot deny you the rapture [Applause] the bible said that enoch walked and he was not the bible said in hebrews 11 that by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him but before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god i wonder if there's anybody that can have a testimony that you're pleasing to god now if you go to studying out enoch's name enoch's name means dedicated and if you're not dedicated to the cause you'll never walk with god if you're not dedicated to this message this message will come by your way but if you're dedicated you can walk with god you can talk with god you can live with god this message will fill you all in all it won't be jesus's word but it'll be your word and jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you as enoch begins to walk he said hey i'm the seventh from adam and i'm typing a people that are seven from adam i'm gonna walk until god takes me and it's going to be a type of a people that they're going to walk with god they're going to talk with god and one of these mornings between the hours and six and nine god is going to snatch up his children when the spirit of the lord falls upon my heart i will walk like he not walked every day he was walking he didn't settle for a halfway walk maybe one day he began to run because he realized that it was getting a little closer to the gate i say i'm running i'm running my last my home hallelujah right here in the midst of layout i see there's a people that's walking they're dedicated they're dedicated to this message enoch's family didn't hinder him enoch's children didn't hinder his walk and neither will it hinder my walk and it better not hinder your walk your family will leave you your family will walk away from you but i'm like moses let me go let me go pharaoh you can have all egypt you want to but let me go let me go i'm not staying down here one more time i'm not staying down here one more time i'm not worshiping down in egypt no more i'm coming out and when i come out i'm taking all the children i'm taking all the cattle i'm taking all the donkeys i'm taking all the she ashes i'm taking everything we're not leaving one hook behind let me go satan take your hands off of god's property we're walking out of egypt let us go you can look out the window all you want to but if you got the right perspective you'll see what moses seen brother branham said that moses and pharaoh looked out the same window day in and day out moses looked out there and he seen that those are the children of the chosen god but pharaoh looked out there and all he seen was a bunch of slaves all a bunch of mud daubers people that would make him some bricks but i want you to know that god don't lose one of his own he knows where you're at down in egypt you can stay down there if you want to but god's calling you out you can try to hide behind your bricks you can try to hide behind your walls you can try to say well i'm still going to be a slave if god's called you to be a son you'll never be a servant [Applause] come on out of that hog waller let me go moses was looking out that window and it's all on how you look at it i look on the same people as the rest of the world looks at they criticize you they make fun of you dance they make fun of your worship they make fun of how long you wear your skirts they make fun of you brothers because you don't wear shorts like a bunch of sissies and join the bss society they make fun of you and all those things they make fun of you because because you believe in a prophet they make fun of you that's how they look at you let me look at you like god looks at you you're my chosen you're my wife you're my elect you're dressing just like i want you to dress you're typing what i wrote down in the bible that this is the lady of the last day and if you can begin to look through the eyes of god about what he said about you instead of your critic's mouth what you need to do is take a bucket of duct tape and shut up the devil's mouth shut his mouth up in such a way that you don't have to hear him talk no more you can put my face on a duct tape commercial shutting the devil up we ain't using a bunch of masks to shut him up we're using duct tape the word of god and it'll glue his lips together where all he can do is oh i just love it when the devil gets so mad he gets the stutter he can't open his mouth because why brother stephen brother shannon and these brothers had done put so much super glue on his mouth that satan can't even open his mouth and he swore that he was going to kill you he swore that he was going to stop you but he didn't have no lips to open up his mouth with i don't care if you got bloody knuckles or not just shut his mouth up i don't care if you walk up in here and it looks like you've been bruised and battered and beat up as long as you overcome you made it through one more week go ahead and give him praise you made it through one more week [Music] let me go i'm not staying in laodicea no longer i'm not a part of laodicea i'm a part of the rapture the rapture can't happen without me the rapture can't happen without you i asked god today said god why do you have me teaching and preaching on the realm of a believer he said you tell them that that realm is as real as it can ever be you're getting ready to step into it it's a real reality church this ain't some pine this guy saying something we make up you're right around the corner let me tell you you can get your eyes on egypt all you want to you can get your eyes on they ought to see you and you can get your eyes caught up on everything that's going on down there or you can look where there's light at you can look where there's light at you can get all disturbed about what cnn's putting on about egypt you can get all disturbed about what's going on in america but we heard a prophet say that she'd be left in craters but before that happens the pride goes up before one bomb can drop on washington d.c that bride of jesus christ is out of here some people waiting on they're waiting on los angeles fall underneath the earth waiting to go underneath the sea you're waiting too long you better get up and walk with god well i'll get in god's a merciful god they thought that when noah they thought noah was a good guy they thought ron was a good guy but we don't close the door god closes the door i'm telling you walk in now before your chance is too late [Applause] [Music] moses could tap into a channel and he could look out there because he was predestined to get there but before moses got into a spot of the deliverer before moses ever got to a spot where he was the next in line to be pharaoh before god raised him up right in the midst of pharaoh and poured it over top of his head something else took place it was a mama and a daddy that had broke into a realm they broke into a ram and amram was up there praying he got up there praying in his upper room he got up there praying and all of a sudden the lord showed him that the deliverer was coming and when the son of levi amram and the daughter of levi joseph bed when they became in unity they produced a son by the name of moses and when they produced a moses they looked on him and they seen that he was the right kind of a child brother burnham said he said and satan was looking all over it for him he was looking all over for him he said but he couldn't catch up with him hallelujah satan's looking all over for you but he can't catch up with you oh i want you to know he might be on your trail but he ain't gonna catch up with you oh mamas and daddies i hope you hear me right now they might be all over your children's trail but they ain't gonna catch up with them the holy ghost is after them before satan can ever get to him [Applause] brother burns said that the holy spirit revealed to her joseph bed that this was him what was happening a mama was breaking into a realm we love when moses is up on the backside of a mountain he's talked to a pillar of fire in a pile of fire talks back to him in a human voice and he tells him i am that i am but before you get there before you get to that experience before you get to that moment when it changes the rest of egypt's life there was a mama that was a mom that was a daddy they said hey god had promised our father abraham that there was going to come a deliverer and they begin to pray and they begin to worship and they begin to break into a realm and when it did it produced a deliverer and when they realized that this was the deliverer she took him and put him in an ark and put him down in a crocodile infested river hit him in the boroughs and pushed him out to the sea i said if god if this is his deliverer he'll take care of him god ain't in the business of losing his children he's in the business and making sure that every crocodile keeps its mouth shut he's in the business of making sure that there's angels with marching orders to come by every whirlpool and make sure that moses gets out of the whirlpool i want you to know that brother brown tapped into it he said i could see god say gabriel line that nile river with ten thousand angels hallelujah and he sent him out with marching orders to watch over moses and brother branham said no matter what you get into the whirlpools of life the angels are set out on marching orders to make sure you get out of it i don't care what the devil tries to put you in the angel is here to get you out out of it that pillar of fire's in the room right now he's here to get you out of that mess you're in he's here to get you out of that sin that you can't figure out and he's here to beat down the depression that's trying to beat you down and he says let them go [Applause] yes there was a mama praying yes there was a daddy praying but on the other side of that prayer came of moses [Applause] [Music] i'm going to tell you mamas and daddies don't you give up there's a moses on the other side of your prayer i want to tell you there's angels that are watching over your children i'm not just talking about prodigals i'm talking about the ones that are sitting in here full of the holy ghost there are angels that are here with marching orders to make sure you make it home tonight and make sure you get back to church tomorrow they're here watching over you and when shaken tries to make you fall in temptation god says back up that's not for you god has so designed this hour that he knows every nook and cranny of laodicea he knows every spot and he knows every temptation is coming by your way and i want to tell you god is greater than your temptation god's greater than your lust god's greater than your own fleshly desire he's greater than all of that and paul says over in titus chapter 2 he said in this present world that we are to deny these things we are to deny all the lustly flesh we are to deny all of these things that come up against us in this present world right here in this world you're living in you can deny the things that are not of god i want to tell you church you can overcome it because there's an overcomer here and the mighty conqueror is standing right here god had his best down there in egypt and moses got him out of it because he was born a deliverer god had his best when he walked when there was a little boy that walked down into the valley of elah that he looked like he was a 12 year old ruddy boy but what he was was more than a conqueror he was a champion because he was anointed god had his best when he had david down there after goliath god had his best when there was a man that was thrown into a lion's den by the name of daniel and daniel come out on the other side and said i told you king i was going to see you in the morning here i am god had his best down in the lion's den god had his best when the three hebrew children went into a fiery furnace and they didn't even have a stench of lay odyssey upon them the only thing that laodicea did when the flames of layout i see it comes from come against them it only loosed the bands that was upon them laosea can do all it wants to it's just making me more rapture ready let me tell you let me go a little bit further god had had his best when he had jesus on the scene now to me jesus looked real good when he healed the widow of name and son jesus looked real good he looked real good when he raised lazarus from the dead he looked real good when he healed blind bartimaeus but he looked his best when he's climbing up calvary's hill [Applause] and i want to go a little bit further god had his best when paul was there god had his best when wesley was there god had his best when luther was there god had his best when william branham was there and god has his best in the body of jesus christ god is determined and dedicated to put his best runners in to finish the last course go ahead i'm the best that god's got say it with a little attitude i'm the best that god's got i'm the best young person i'm the best worshiper you can get offended if you want to i'm the best because god saw me before the foundation of the world ah brother andrew he likes to brag about himself no i don't but i do like bragging on my jesus i ain't got a whole lot of muscles all them was given to my big brother matthew
