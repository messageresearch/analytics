mighty Miracles we've we've seen prodal come back home we've seen the gifts manifested amongst us we've seen healing and we've seen salvation we're a blessed people we've seen what the Bible said that he would do and we've seen that come right here and manifest itself right into our midst and to that we're thankful and uh I know that you're aware but I i' ask that you would be praying for us this week myself and sister Katie will be headed to Belgium uh to speak the the Belgium Youth Camp there along with brother Matthew Watkins and and brother uh Paul halit and uh I know uh this is my first overseas trip and uh you know I always said I did my missionary work down there in Louisiana cuz that was another part of the world and so I guess I can't say that no more but I certainly would appre appreciate your prayers and uh not that I'm nervous or anything but I I am nervous uh but uh you know I I you know I I thought about it I probably the biggest thing that probably made me nervous nervous about it is is working with a translator you know and just you know my style and my rhythm and everything but you know me living and being best friends with brother out and back there he's got me good and prepared for all the translation work you know so dealing with a bunch of these frasers around here I have to translate for them you know sometimes so so now now the Belgian people have to try to translate me so but uh just so you know we're not leaving brother Matthew out this this weekend brother Matthew is going to bring his new year's message uh for you next Saturday next Saturday night and and uh we had to give him a little bit more room you know us Brothers have 30 minutes but brother Matthew just needs a little bit more Running Room so so so I I know that you'll enjoy that and so I certainly would appreciate that and I want to say from the bottom of my heart I love you with everything that's within me I thank you for letting me uh co-pastor here and be a part of this

thing I ever I ever done let's just pray this morning Heavenly Father we approach you Lord from the depths of our soul we want to express our gratitude ude for the things that we have seen Lord David would say it that this is the doing of the Lord and it is marvelous in our sights Lord my mind has been reflecting upon the thoughts and the sermons that have went on this past year so many glorious things that that were held there in the library of God's economy that you begin to release to us this past year father I'd say that we are better people this year than we were in 2022 but Lord as we get ready to transition into 2024 father with every fiber of our being Lord we want to offer ourselves up as a Living Sacrifice we want to surrender our mind our heart our our beings our work our monies our families Lord every part of ourselves we want to offer it to you Lord that we would be better in 20124 Father not to outdo each other not to have a competition to be better but Lord just to be something that you would find willing to come and snatch us away Lord a people that are ready a people that are dressed father our desire is to please you and to please you only and God I ask today as the preaching of the word would go forth these special meetings that'll happen here today I pray that you would come amongst it Lord I'm just reminded Lord just now while I'm praying that last year at this time we had these special meetings and it was it was the very first time that some of our sisters begin to speak in tongues Lord what can you do in a service father so many times we look at it in in a time element of of a day or in certain hours but Lord in your mind you're releasing things through the body father I pray that you would begin to just talk to us from your word today draw us up to us Lord like you did the little children because you love them and I know that today that you've gathered your children here we love you father we want to hear your voice anything you say Will Be Heaven to us so God we counted a privilege to hear your word we bless your Holy Name today and the Bride of Jesus Christ says amen amen if you have your Bibles today we'd like to look over in Daniel chap 3 and verse 16 and also Philippians chap 1 and verse 6 Daniel chapter 3 and verse 16 after I get done uh with my portion today brother Shan and sister Tracy and sister Heather you can just plan to make your way there to sing your special today after we finish here Daniel 3 and: 16 Shadrach meach and abedo answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King but if not be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up also Philippians chapter 1 1 and verse 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen may God bless his word you may be seated today in the presence of the Lord I believe that sometimes and often times in the in our human mind in our in our in our human finite Minds that we often times when we begin to read the scripture that we see it and we get a perception about the the Bible characters that they were superhuman or they had a super anointing but that's very much contrary if you begin to study out the Bible the Bible would tell us that they were men of like passions like ourselves and they they were men made out of the same elements that we are made out of and so many times we look at characters in The Bible and sometimes we think of it almost as Fiction it's almost too hard to believe that men could do that but they were under the anointing of the hour that they were living in and you know many times you read the Bible and you get that perception but really to know that they were brothers just like you and maybe maybe if it was your time to actually live that would be your name instead of Noah's name but many times we begin to think well I could never play that part or I could never do that but but you realize that that men God would use men just like you men that had problems men that had mistakes and the Bible tells us if you read it that Noah got drunk that Abraham was way too old and Isaac was simply a Daydreamer Jacob was a liar Leah was ugly Joseph was abused so no matter what situation that you're in in life God can use your character to play the part that he has Moses was a murderer and they couldn't halfway talk Gideon was afraid and Rahab was a prostitute that should have never been in the picture Jeremiah and Timothy was way too young David was a murderer and an adulator Elijah if you go to study Elijah's Ministry Elijah was actually suicidal at one point in his ministry Isaiah preached naked John Jonah ran away from God Naomi was a widow job had went bankrupt in his business John the Baptist sat around and ate on bucks Peter denied the Lord the disciples fell asleep while while praying Martha worried about everything Mary Magdalene was demon-possessed and the Samaritan woman was divorced more than once zakus was way too short and Paul was a murderer and Lazarus was past dead so no matter what situation that you're in you're a whole lot better off than what Lazarus was this morning to think that God can use the the human abilities of of man and use them in in a way to bring about a story a story of Grace that could depict a part of his mercy and today I'd like to speak to you for a few minutes on the opportunities that we've been given the opportunities that we've been given I believe that everything in life is an opportunity it depends on what you're going to do if that opportunity is what will be the outcome of your story you see the difference in a lot of these characters that we've just read here is they were not qualified in the beginning but God does not call the qualified he qualifies the called and God always takes men that seem like they are nobodies and he makes them into something into the kingdom of God and no matter what arises in life God is going to wait around and see how that you react to the word of God how do you handle the chaos or how do you handle the crisis when you look at shamar's life he could have went on and allowed the Philistines to continue to to go through the process of robbing him right at the Harvest Time year after year he could allow that to go on but but shamgar had to come to his shamgar moment he had to come to a spot where Revelation would set in that I'm not just an ordinary man but I am a man that is under the abrahamic Covenant that I have been circumcised and I have a covenant with me that the god of Abraham is with me and shamgar had one of those moments like he took his head out of the sand and he finally realized that this is what I was born for I was not born for the Philistines to come in and rob me at the greatest time of my life and that's what you've been raised up for is not to keep your head in the sand but to stand there and pull your head out of the sand and say I was born for this to take everything that that Le O is trying to rob from me and take the very best things of life out of my Harvest you see so many times Satan comes in and he robs us right at the best of times but isn't that exactly how worry comes in worry comes in is exactly when you got everything in place you got everything in place and you start worrying what if I lose it all I see it as an opportunity just to get greater in the economy of almighty God you see you can either see it or this is just the way that I've got to live or you're going to have to see it as or you can see it as this is an opportunity for me to give God glory but I believe that too many times that people live in the clutches of the fear of failure they live in the clutches of fear of failure of of a afraid that they're going to let somebody down or they're they're afraid to maybe stand up in front of somebody and to stand up for their god-given rights or stand up for their convictions because they are afraid that they might fail they might not have the scripture in place or maybe they have that fear of failing or being an embarrassment you see that's what fear of failure is it is it is somebody that is that it causes that that fear it causes people to avoid the activity or a scenario that that that has potential to have an unsuccessful outcome upon it and someone with that condition might be scared to try new things they might be able they might be scared to take risk they might be scared to go out and talk to somebody a lot of times people have fear of failure they don't go out and talk to they don't talk to this one when they really want to say something but they're afraid of what actually might come of it so they don't say anything boys are afraid to talk to girls because they're afraid that they might let them down people in business are afraid to make the business call because they're afraid that the customer won't go through and instead of inh and instead of handling rejection they simply just don't go forward in it but fear is is such a powerful thing that that the Bible would tell us in three in over 600 times in the Bible do not be afraid fear not fear not don't be afraid it's over in the Bible over 600 times that it spoke to us so we realize that there is a Godly fear and there is a fear that comes from Satan What Fear does Fear will actually protect you in a way but fear can also drive you away from the things that are really meant for your life you see that phrase do not fear was spoke to Abraham when he was too old that phrase it was spoke to Israel when she was getting ready to cross the Red Sea don't be afraid it was spoke to Moses that word that phrase was spoke to David that ran away from Saul it was spoke that to Daniel don't you be afraid in the Lion's Den it was spoke to the disciples on the angry sea fear not it is I that walketh on the water it was spoke to Paul when he was on a ship for 14 days do not be afraid these characters had a Godly fear about them a fear without failure so there is a Godly fear that will drive you Hallelujah to the opportunities that will not let you down there is a fear of failure that you're always going to fail somebody or you're not going to accomplish what you set out to do but I believe that we can have a fear without failure I believe that we can look at every opportunity as the opportunity as the Church of the Living God and see it as a day that we can rise and possess what is rightfully ours 10 spies may rise up and say we're not able to do it but there's going to be somebody that's got faith to say that's my land and I'm more than able to go in there and Conquer it you don't have to fear because fear fear has met its maker when it met Jesus brother brand said in the message I know he said Satan could not take them he could not drown Noah in the flood until the purpose purpose of God had been finished he could not burn up the Hebrew children until the purpose of God had been finished he could not kill job with boils and troubles until the purpose of God had been finished neither could the lions eat Daniel until the purpose of God had been finished neither could death in old age take Abraham him until the purpose of God had been finished and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of God of our life is finished so we gather from this conclusion from right here that why does God let troubles come God harnesses troubles and he puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with God you can either look at your trouble as as as as Toro or you can look at it as an opportunity you see because William Brandon would tell us he would preach to us the greatest battle ever fought and we know where that battle is it's right there in the mind and that is where you got to win the war before you win it in the flesh you've got to win it in your mind before you ever overcome out there in the natural you've got to win it right here in your mind before you can go out there and possess your inheritance you've got to win that battle right here in your your mind and my favorite one of my favorite scriptures is Isaiah 26 and3 that I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me the only way you're going to win a war is not to be tore up and not to be a distress is to be in perfect peace you see what adversity does adversity proves what's on the inside of you come on somebody we'd have never known what Noah was made of unless he was asked to build an ark we' have never known what Moses was made of unless God made him go out there on the backside of a desert we' have never known what Malachi was made of unless God would send him through trials right here in the midst of Le oosa we didn't never known what brother Chris was made of unless God would send him through something adversity proves what you got on the inside of you and David said yay though I walk through the valley of The Shadow of death I will fear no evil let me tell you something a shadow cannot hurt you a shadow cannot hurt you a shadow of a of a lion cannot hurt you a shadow of a sword cannot hurt you a shadow of a gun cannot hurt you it's just a shadow and you might feel like you've been living in the shadows but the Shadows cannot hurt you yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death death is simply a shadow under the formidable hands of almighty God he destroyed death come on somebody a lion Shadow can't hurt you but when you get the reality of it that's where it hurts you a shadow will never hurt you and Satan might have put you in a shadow and make you feel like you're living depressed but it's time to impress your depression and show your depression that almighty God has showed up Hallelujah David said the Lord Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid a thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come n thee spiritual strength is greater than physical strength I'd rather have the strength of this little boy right here than what Samson had on the inside of him I'd rather have the strength of sister Sharon breed and than to have the strength and all the wisdom of Solomon it's because it's not an anointing it's a holy ghost [Applause] seal Hallelujah the Bible said in Hebrews 13:6 the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me David or or Paul would say what shall we say to these things if God before us who can be against us amen hallelujah when you go to studying out just want to transition just for a moment when you go to studying out first Kings chapter 19 you study out the the effects or the stages of Elijah's Ministry and you look at it where Elijah is scared of a woman scared of his woman he's scared of a woman he's scared he's scared to such a place that he's all by himself he thinks he's all by himself that he actually ask God let me let me die take my life from me so he goes to a Jour a juniper tree God causes a sleep to come upon him and then he feeds him he feeds him such a snack that he's able to sleep for 40 days so never underestimate the power of a snack and a nap he goes from there goes up and hides in a cave goes up there hides in a cave he's hiding up there and he feels the effects of the wind and he feels the effects of the earthquake he feels the effects of it but that was not him what we seen in or Roberts and Billy Graham that was the effects that was the effects but that was not him but Elijah was waiting on the manifestation of the reality and then he asked him what are you doing up here Elijah what are you doing up here your ministry your ministry is not called decave Ministry come on now I'm talking to you your ministry is not to stay in the cave of Le oosa and say I can't do it it's an opportunity for you to show what you built What You're Made Of You are not built to stay in the cave you heard the voice so come out of the cave come out of depression come out of anxiety come out of pain come out of it earnest siming way is one of the greatest one of the greatest men that had the ability to take words and make novels with him he he was one of the most profound most profound shortstory man that there was and then he was known for his lengthy Power of Words and he could put he could tie words together and he was sitting down one day at breakfast with a bunch of with a bunch of authors that had sit around with him and they bet him said now Ernest I bet you that you you can't make a you can't make a six-word short story he picked up a napkin he picked up a napkin and he wrote down six words for sale baby shoes never worn he took those words and made a story out of it and you might think that you're living such a life that God can never make anything out of your life but I want you to know whether you be little or whether you be great God can take the story of your life and make something great out of it you might look at your life as just just ordinary you might look as your life is just normal but I want to say this to you that anybody that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost is completely unnormal you are not ordinary you are not built here to be like the rest of the world come on sisters I know it might be hard for you young girls to go out there and be in the face of all of your peers and your friends in the midst of school and stand out there and stand up for the for the righteousness of Holiness but it's an opportunity to show that God is still the same yesterday today and forever that it's an [Applause] opportunity and Elijah goes from a cave because notice shortly after this the rapture's coming shortly after this moment but he goes up there he goes up there on the back side after his cave moment and one of the greatest opportunities comes out of his cave moment he goes up there and he sees a man that is a man of wealth that we know by the name of Elisha he's out there working in the field plowing with 12 oxen he's got some of the best equipment that there ever is and L is on the 12th one now you can look at it you can study all the scriptures you can study all the commentators some of them say that it was 12 men out there and some of them say that it was Elijah Elisha working with 12 oxen so let's take it from the aspect that there was 11 other men out there Elijah walk past 11 other ones and he chose this one because he saw something on the inside of Elisha because Elisha brother brandom said what caught Elijah's mind about Elisha was he had the ability to keep a straight line he was not going to waver to the left side or to the right side he was going to stay right there in the middle of his road and when he did when he come past Elisha he allowed his manle to be draped over top of Elisha now let me tell you something if you stay in your cave you'll never have an Elisha moment if you stay where you think you ought to stay where you're safe at you're never going to meet your elasa the one that's going to be a Protegé that'll carry on the message if William Brandon would have got his wish and standing at the Gap being a better Trapper you'd have never been here but because there's a God that's rich in Mercy that saw the opportunities he laid the mantle over on top of him notice when he lays it over on top of him Elijah kept walking but when he turned around Elisha wasn't standing where he was where he found him at Elisha was following him because if you're ever going to be successful in life you are only going to be as successful as the people that you follow and if you are following if you're following Putin and if you're following Pope and if you're following Joe Biden you are going to go down in mystery but if you can follow almighty God you are going to have a successful life and Alisha was following the prophet what did he see on the inside of Elijah it was an anointing that attracted himself to it brother R said now I don't understand this he said because if you look over in the scriptures when over in the New Testament he said the man asked can I go back and bid my mother and my father goodbye and Jesus wouldn't let him he said but he allowed Elisha to because Elisha said let me go back let me return back and kiss my my mother and my father and Elijah said what have I done unto thee but notice what Elisha does when he turns back from the prophet he turns back and what does he do he goes back there and he takes what he's been working with this is the finest of qualities of oxen this is the finest of qualities of instruments that Elisha's been working with he's a mighty man of wealth he's got great things but what does Elisha should do he takes his plow he takes his instruments and he burns them and he takes the oxen and he places it upon the sacrifice what was he doing he was waving back to his past and kissing his past goodbye said so long I'm not going back to my past no longer he thought so much about Elijah's Ministry that he kissed his past goodbye said no more no more of this no more drugs no more pain no more alcohol it's time that you take the opportunity to kiss your past goodbye so long so long Hallelujah burn the sacrifice there's nothing to go back to you got a job to do you've got an opportunity to do to carry the [Applause] message if a El would have turned back and went back he would have SED it would have SED that he didn't have something on the inside of him but Elijah saw something on in the inside of Elisha Elisha you may not understand the opportunity that is coming by your way but you're getting get getting ready to be have a bigger Ministry than Elijah himself you're getting ready to have a double portion if I can tell you to get out of your of your place that you're in right now leave where you're at stop living where you've been and start moving to what God wants you to be come on somebody you've got to stop looking back through your past lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily beset us let us run this race with patience that you so set before [Music] us a double portion let me tell you if you stay where the Baptist got you you will never have a d double portion if you stay where the Methodist found you you'll never have a double portion if you stay with the Catholic Church you'll never have a double portion but if you can burn it if you can burn where you've been burn your Traditions burn your ideas burn what you think the message is and come to the reality there's a double portion waiting on the other side of this opportunity but if you go if you go study a blessing Prophet we're all capable of missing opportunities I'd say we in 2023 I'd say that some of us messed up here I'd say we messed up but we learned from our mistakes I'd say we had some faults that that maybe led us down in our own Humanity but there was something that didn't allow you to stay where you were but it Rose you to another challenge it Rose you to another Plateau don't say where you are William Brandon said this I'm guilty here's the prophet of this day the guy that God is going to use to bring and release all of the Mysteries to this body I'm guilty I'm guilty for not doing the job of God like I should I'm confessing it that I'm wrong I'm asking God to be merciful to me I look out there and I see opportunities that I miss because of petty things little old insignificant things that didn't mean nothing he said I'm ashamed of myself as a gospel Ministry before you I Repent before God and ask God to forgive me and the church to forgive me for being so dilatory about the work of God he said they said I've won a million souls to Christ he said that's as far as I got he said I should have done one 10 million souls for Christ he said I look out there and I see all those missed opportunities he said but what about you have you won one soul to Christ come on somebody have you won so one soul to Christ if you haven't you're guilty every one of us got to be put on this altar how many times has you testified that God is a God that heals cancer how many times has you told somebody that he's a God that saves he's a God that delivers he's a God that sets free if you've not released your testimony you're guilty man praise the Lord but he is not going to leave us where he found us at he's given you another opportunity you remember when William brandom brother mam goes over to that building over in Kentucky it's called the hayburn building I don't even think it's there it might be still there now but brother BR brother brandom is riding that elevator he's riding that elevator with some ministers one day and they got up here to the eighth floor and said well I guess this about as high as we ever going to get I guess this about as high as we ever get we better get on off here brother Bon said wait a minute that's about as high as you ever going to get on your own merits but if you got the blood on your side you can only go any higher through the blood of Jesus Christ and if your marit are only taking you to a certain plateau get off of your elevator and get onto the blood of Jesus Christ it's the greatest opportunity that you ever been given you can only live so high in your own matters and your own merits but with King Jesus the sky's a limit he said oh I'd like to say something if I can forget what I was and remember what he is if I can remember Jesus if I can remember him at the cross if I can remember what he done for me if I can remember the hour that he washed away my sins and give me the holy spirit to guide me that I'm lifted above everything that holds this Earth if I'm lifted above every Earthly thing into Heavenly places where I can fellowship with him there in his presence forgetting what I ever was forgetting all my sins and everything because they in the sea of God's forgetfulness forgetting all my past forgetting everything and remember that he made me his own by his own death he took my place William Brandon said what an opportunity that the Church of the Living God has today to rise to its feet with a witness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and shake this world again he say oh Christian what an opportunity that we have we have opportunities that St Paul never dreamed of we have opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and all of them never had up opportunities that we have now there has never been a day like this day what are you going to do with your opportunity God's the one that gives the air but it's the bird that uses the air to fly come on somebody God is the one that made the Mighty Oak Tree but it's man that makes low cabins out of them come on somebody it's you what are you going to do with what God has given you are you going to make a piece of furniture are you going to make yourself are you going to make yourself a casket are you going to make yourself are you going to make yourself something that shouldn't be what are you going to do with what you've been given I believe you've been given every tool to make it into the Rapture so what are you going to do with what you've been given you see what you've been given is what you produce in the miraculous I want you just to imagine right here this morning just for a few minutes as I'm bringing this to a close what are you going to do with what you've been given jbed was given a baby and she raised a deliverer David was given a sling and he killed a giant Shamar was given an ox code and he killed the Philistines Mary was given a baby and she raised a savior William bradam was giving a message and it produced a bride this bride was giving a message and she will produce a body change you've got the capacity to do what it [Applause] takes you got every right to testify about it you got troubles everybody's got troubles guess what 2024 is coming he's going to have some troubles in it but it's your job to do what you do with it I heard I heard a story read a story this week about a I'm I'm closing musicians should come brother Shannon and sister Heather sister Tracy come make her way but there was a pilot that was flying on a plane he's all by himself up there and one of them little puddle jumpers he's flying up in there and he heard the sound of a mouse and if you ever heard the sound of a rat you know it that guy he he was The Story Goes that he was flying that plane and he got so worried he got so worried that that rat was going to eat up one of his instruments that would tell him how high he was and all of these other instruments and he got so worried and shook up about it and he said but all of a sudden I remembered that rat was built for the ground he was built to burrow himself in the ground he said so I just nosed my plane a little bit higher he said I kept on getting higher and he said the higher I got he said the less I could hear that rat less I could hear him biting on the wires less I could hear him he said the higher I got he said the worry left me and he said when I landed he said a rat fell out of my plane you see what I'm trying to tell you is if you can let your worries go and just go up there where your problems cannot live in the presence of almighty God in the breath of Mighty of the most high God rats and problems cannot exist in the presence of Eli so take your problems take your opportunities and fly into the heavenlies of this Malachi 4 Ministry and you'll leave this whole Earthbound World [Applause] Behind oh sh is [Music]

that uh to kind of prepare you for the sermon that we have this morning for just a few Mo moments I am committed to make it let's stand to our feet I would just want to read a couple scriptures for you is everybody good amen stretch your arms out whatever you got to do don't get sleepy are you ready are you ready to have church amen Isaiah chapter 54 in verse 17 then Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 yeah it's done been read but I'm going read it again are you with me now no weapon all right are we there let's read it together no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against thee in the Judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the herit her itage of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness of me sayith the Lord Philippians 1 and verse 6 I'll I'll wait till they get there amen thank you sister Stephanie being confident of this very thing let's read it together being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ 4 verse 13 Philippians 4 verse 13 are you ready I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 you okay finally my brethren let's read it together finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand isn't it wonderful Jude chapter 1 and verse 24 Jude chapter 1 and verse 24 I want to read it again with this amen sorry I didn't send him a list before service Jude CH 1 and verse vers 24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy I want to read that again unto him that is able to keep you from falling we ought to be able to shout right there and to present you you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy may the Lord add the blessing of his word you may be seated I'm 62 years old I have preached almost 40 years but as of this moment I feel more committed than I ever have before now after 4 years years I have faced and stood in the Lion's Den but I still stood on this message this is when courage has been put to the test we Face test we Face trials you may never face brain cancer or lung C cancer but remember before that this whole journey took place God spoke to us said if you will trust me right if you will trust me I will use you like never before Jesus stood before one of his greatest tests before the government and Jesus answered and said my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence and pilate therefore said unto him art thou the king then and Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king now notice as he points it together to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice I want to share a quote with you our desire is not to be glorified our desire is not to have some big name our desire is not to boast some church or make make more in the Sunday school or try to bring in and hul tie and push in and offer a picnic party or bring stars or buttons or something like that that's not our desire our desire is to see him glorified glorified what not with self- pride but in but in us our lives to prove that he is alive and is living in us that's what our desire is tonight now notice this nothing great has ever taken place unless it was put under pressure God chose you to being an infinite God he knew what time to birth you he know what time to BR bring you into the Earth and he didn't give you some just easy way he knew the trials that you were going to be handed and he put something on the inside of you more than just human grip more than just human strength he put himself on the inside of you and God's Got Confidence like he had in job and confidence like he had in Abraham he's got confidence in you that you'll make it there'll be times to where that you feel like I'm going to fail I'm going to turn loose you got urges that you'll quit you feel like I don't have energies to go on anymore that's when you realize it's not you but it's him [Applause] count it all joy count it all joy when you go into some incredible Temptations of your life statements that have been made that prove courage Patrick Henry was riding through our neighborhood here call Pepper and as you were riding through call Pepper there was a man that was in stocks and that man had been thrown out of the church and he refused to preach the Ang Anglican Church doctrines they throwed him out and they were going to kill him there and he would die his last sermon as he would preach is Give me liberty or give me death I'd like to say this to you tonight we will not turn back we will not compromise we will not give in so Give me liberty or give me death Patrick kenry W went into the walls of our of our government at that time and stood up amongst peers and it was not popular and he screamed what a preacher said that inspired him Give me liberty or give me death thank God there was a man that was losing a battle and his ship seemed to be blown apart and the enemy pulled up beside of him and screamed at him are you ready to give up and John Paul Jones said I have not begun to fight yet you may be wounded you may be battered but if there's something on the inside of you just tell the devil this morning you don't realize it but I have not begun to fight yet brother George Washington prayed all night long before going across some icy waters knowing that maybe some of his comrades would pass and not live through the next day but he didn't back up from the battle as he prayed all night he knew that he was praying to somebody that could hear and answer prayer and the next day bullet holes would go through his jacket but the God that he prayed to was more able than all of the bullets of the enemy the god that you pray to is greater than your battle one of the greatest generals of World War II made an incredible statement I shall return return it had a tough battle but he was not backing off a precious sister in Florida who fought many battles incl including poverty I had the wonderful opportunity to sit and listen to her singing and listen to her and she had a lot of battles in her life but this is one of the songs that has always stuck with me it's going to take a stronger wind than this I was raised in the church Message Church and there was a there was a man that played symbols in that church he stood about 4 fo8 he had huge hands and he would had a dwarf disease but they said if he had not had that disease he would have been a giant they put him in the army they drafted him and put him in the Army and he became a chef not just anybody's chef but he was a chef for General George Patton and so he walked side by side with with General Patton one day the entire Pat Battalion was stopped on a country road thousands of men just stopped in their tracks and General Patton made his way toward the front brother Bale would say when he got to the front there was a farmer with a mule that refused to go forward and refused to get out of the road and patton said you mean to tell me we're in a war and a mu has stopped this entire Army he pulled out his gun shot the MU got it out of the way listen these are men that are going to kill thousands and thousands of people but a mule had stopped you may have to come up against some things that are pull your gun pull your sword kill the devil that is in front of you don't feel sorry for him don't pet him around somebody help me preach brother Ron I'm going to send that to Peter you're welcome too but make sure they listen to the rest of this sermon Ephesians chapter 3 talks about you and I behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come to him and and will s with him and he with me now this is your verse to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne Jesus would encourage us take up your cross not enough for me to take up my cross I'm going to do that but take up your cross Peter James John the rest of the disciples take up your cross and follow me this is your turn courage is when you reach beyond your human ability and stand there and move forward I've already said it if you trust me I will use you like never before let me me just say this to you thank you sister Dolores you had sister Connie to go on the trip with me to brother Bisal she wasn't going to go I would get the news five minutes before that I would walk out of the hotel door I would get the call you have cancer in your lungs the sermon that night was courage I didn't have a pity party a lot of people talk about stories but somebody's got to live this I didn't go cry and say why what happened why me why you do all this I walked to the pulpit that night and I preach courage these are some of the thoughts brother Brandon would teach us it is not the size of the dog in the fight go ahead tell your neighbor it is not the size of the dog in the fight that's part one it is the size of the fight in the [Applause] [Music] dog and if you know anything about ballistics Dynamite comes in small [Applause] [Music] packages people want to tell you about how to fight Andrew read my notes and he he said this was the quote of the day people want to tell you how to fight that has never whipped a cat they know all about the fight and they've never pulled their their sword out of their sheath life has been perfect for them but when you're in a fight with life and death
