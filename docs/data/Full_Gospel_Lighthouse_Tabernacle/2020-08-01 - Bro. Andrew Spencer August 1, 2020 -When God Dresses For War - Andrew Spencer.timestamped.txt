[45:43] our needs
[45:45] father we come before you just now
[45:48] in spirit and in truth father to worship
[45:51] you lord
[45:53] humbling our hearts
[45:56] lord realizing that we're nothing lord
[46:00] without you
[46:01] lord if it wasn't for you breathing the
[46:03] breath of life upon us
[46:05] o god we'd still be laying in the dirt
[46:09] but father you formed us before time
[46:12] before molecules before the world began
[46:16] lord we were in your mind
[46:18] you know every element of us and you
[46:20] knew what our makeup would be in our
[46:22] characteristics father
[46:25] you know how that some of us would be
[46:27] emotional and
[46:28] some of us would be more more staunch in
[46:32] our ways
[46:33] father but you built us
[46:36] so that we might bring out a certain
[46:39] sound
[46:40] according to the maker
[46:43] lord you birthed this one to that one
[46:45] until you got exactly what you wanted
[46:49] father i look out upon a people and i
[46:52] think about a people across the land
[46:55] that have been birthed by your word
[46:59] i say that you're looking upon a
[47:01] creation and you're getting exactly what
[47:03] you want father not in the natural but
[47:06] in the spiritual father
[47:08] as we rise as we rise up from our own
[47:11] thinkings
[47:12] to begin to take on your thoughts
[47:15] father i pray that you'd go
[47:19] forth into this this body of believers
[47:22] just
[47:23] now and allow the force of the holy
[47:25] ghost to begin to move across your
[47:27] people lord and bring them into the
[47:29] conditions
[47:31] in which we need lord to take a rapture
[47:34] father
[47:36] this message will produce a body change
[47:39] father
[47:40] this word of the lord that we've
[47:42] received is
[47:44] is that father more than a man but it's
[47:46] it's came straight from glory
[47:49] it's risen us past our our day-to-day
[47:53] thinking of religion father but it has
[47:57] risen us father
[47:59] to meet the challenge of the hour
[48:02] and god we give you praise for your
[48:04] releasing of
[48:06] the word father and god tonight we just
[48:10] want to lift up the name of jehovah
[48:13] the one that was the same throughout the

[49:46] thank you
[49:53] isaiah chapter 59 and verse 15.
[50:02] i was studying on a completely different
[50:06] thought this week in about
[50:08] 1047 today the lord
[50:12] just come into the room and i felt like
[50:13] i was going to be swept out of the room
[50:16] and so i'd like to i'd like to
[50:20] preach from this text today of isaiah 59
[50:24] and 15 by the help of the lord the bible
[50:26] says yea
[50:27] truth faileth and he that departeth from
[50:30] evil maketh himself a prey and the lord
[50:32] saw it and it displeased him that there
[50:35] was no judgment
[50:37] and he saw that there was no man and
[50:40] wondered
[50:42] that there was no intercessor therefore
[50:44] his arm brought salvation unto him
[50:48] and his righteousness is sustained him
[50:51] for he put on righteousness as a
[50:54] breastplate
[50:55] and a helmet of salvation upon his head
[50:58] and he put on the garments of vengeance
[51:00] for clothing
[51:01] and was clad with zeal as a cloak
[51:04] according to their deeds accordingly he
[51:07] will repay fury
[51:08] to his adversaries recompense to his
[51:12] enemies
[51:12] to the islands he will repay recompense
[51:16] may god bless his word you may be seated
[51:18] in the presence of the lord
[51:19] i also would like to make mention of
[51:21] sister shirley grandma's
[51:23] kin we just welcome her in the presence
[51:25] of the lord happy to have her back here
[51:27] with us
[51:28] and so tonight by the help of the lord
[51:30] i'd like to speak to you on something
[51:33] that god dropped in my heart
[51:35] today as we said on when god dresses
[51:39] when god dresses for war when god
[51:42] dresses for war and look back with me at
[51:44] verse 17
[51:46] and keep your bibles handy this evening
[51:48] the bible says here
[51:50] for he put on righteousness as a
[51:52] breastplate and a helmet of salvation
[51:54] upon his head
[51:55] and he put on the garments of vengeance
[51:57] for clothing
[51:59] and was clad with zeal as a cloak
[52:02] according to their deeds according lee
[52:06] will he he will repay fury to his
[52:08] adversaries recompense to his enemies
[52:11] to the islands he will repay recompense
[52:15] and verse 18 we see there that even
[52:17] those that
[52:18] that are dwelling in in a more remote
[52:22] or a distant part that even your enemies
[52:25] that you may have even forgotten about
[52:27] god has not forgotten them and those
[52:30] that may seem like they're too far out
[52:32] of your reach not to even be dealt with
[52:34] anymore
[52:35] god is saying i'm going to get them and
[52:38] so
[52:39] basically god is saying to you or saying
[52:42] to the enemy or the adversary
[52:44] he's saying i'm coming for you and i i
[52:48] absolutely love this
[52:49] because i begin to look at these things
[52:52] and in the manner in which god looks at
[52:54] them and not the way that we look at
[52:55] them
[52:56] that that god's conquests are not
[52:58] earthly as we see things so many times
[53:00] but
[53:01] but god has a spiritual warfare
[53:05] and that god is is the god that is
[53:07] fighting our battles for
[53:08] us now the bible says here in romans 12
[53:11] and 19
[53:12] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but
[53:15] rather give place
[53:17] unto wrath for it is written vengeance
[53:20] is mine
[53:21] i will repay saith the lord to me it's
[53:24] an amazing thing to watch when a human
[53:27] being or
[53:28] or a person and even those that call
[53:30] themselves sons and daughters of god
[53:32] begin to take matters
[53:33] into their own hands and and usually it
[53:36] is that
[53:37] it is that southern anger on the inside
[53:39] of you that will drive you to do
[53:41] incredible things
[53:42] and even northern anger will drive you
[53:44] to do incredible things
[53:45] but because of out of revenge because
[53:48] somebody did something to you
[53:50] or said something to you you you're
[53:52] looking for payback you're
[53:54] you're looking to to revenge what has
[53:56] been taking place
[53:58] on your accord and and so many times you
[54:00] watch a parent when
[54:01] when little johnny does something or a
[54:03] little susie down
[54:05] does something sorry if we've got a
[54:06] johnny or susie here tonight i know we
[54:08] got one johnny here but i'm i'm
[54:10] not necessarily calling on brother
[54:11] johnny but you watch when a parent when
[54:13] they
[54:14] when they when their children get into a
[54:16] circumstance that they can't necessarily
[54:18] handle
[54:19] they'll begin to take on matters for
[54:20] their own self and take it into their
[54:22] hands and
[54:23] and us hillbillies down here we begin to
[54:25] say well we got this
[54:27] we got everything in our control we can
[54:29] handle these things but
[54:30] but what what god is telling us is that
[54:33] is that that revenge is mine that what
[54:36] they have done to you
[54:38] is not what they've done to you but what
[54:40] they've done to me
[54:41] and i am the one that i will repay what
[54:44] the enemy's done to you and
[54:46] and so god is telling you don't take
[54:48] what is mine
[54:50] he's telling you you you don't take what
[54:53] is mine and
[54:54] and when you begin to take take away
[54:57] from god and say this is my battle and
[55:00] i'm gonna fight this battle or i'm gonna
[55:02] do this
[55:03] and and i'm gonna do that what you're
[55:04] doing is you're stripping god
[55:07] of his armor
[55:10] i know you don't like those things but
[55:12] when you begin to say well i've got this
[55:14] or i can handle this i can search this i
[55:16] can find this
[55:17] i can do this i can do this by the help
[55:20] of whatsoever
[55:21] what you're doing is you're stripping
[55:23] god of his armor
[55:29] the bible said in isaiah 59 that he put
[55:32] on righteousness as a breastplate
[55:35] that breastplate is designed to defend
[55:38] the breasts from
[55:39] from darts and it is designed to
[55:43] defend the sword of the enemy in the
[55:45] midst of attack
[55:47] that and then it says on and the helmet
[55:50] of salvation
[55:51] upon his head that helmet of salvation
[55:54] is the armor
[55:55] that we know is for the head and when
[55:57] you look at a man of war
[55:59] and you see him standing in the
[56:01] battleground and we're very familiar
[56:02] with these things
[56:04] and we see that the armor is for the
[56:07] headship
[56:08] and it's seen and it is seen by by all
[56:11] those are standing around when you first
[56:13] glance at a war you're
[56:14] you're you're looking at his you're
[56:16] looking at his head and you're looking
[56:18] at that helmet
[56:19] and and you so your focus is on that
[56:21] helmet
[56:22] of salvation and notice it is it is to
[56:26] him alone
[56:27] in which that helmet of salvation
[56:29] belongs to
[56:31] and we look over in in ephesians chapter
[56:34] 6
[56:34] and we can see when paul begins to grab
[56:37] these things from isaiah 59
[56:39] he looks over and he puts on the whole
[56:42] arm of god
[56:43] over to the christian and he grabs these
[56:45] things and he tells us
[56:47] that our fight is not against flesh and
[56:49] blood but it's against spiritual
[56:51] wickedness which is in high places and
[56:54] you watch that that warfare
[56:56] is in a position in which you were
[56:59] chosen to be at
[57:00] but that enemy realizes that if it can
[57:03] defeat you
[57:04] in the position that you are to be at
[57:08] if it can defeat you in your position
[57:11] it has got you whipped right there but
[57:13] paul grabs these things
[57:15] and he tells us to put on the helmet of
[57:18] salvation
[57:19] now when you're looking at jesus as
[57:23] as the helmet of salvation and you see
[57:25] that that
[57:26] is only due to him that only he can wear
[57:29] that helmet
[57:32] that only the helmet of salvation
[57:33] belongs to him and you begin to look
[57:35] over in revelations chapter 19
[57:38] and you begin to see that he is crowned
[57:41] with many crowns
[57:42] and you begin to look at the war at the
[57:45] warfare and you look at the wear
[57:47] that the warrior begins to wear
[57:51] so god is dressing himself
[57:54] in his own armor
[57:58] it goes on to say of the garments of
[58:00] vengeance
[58:01] he clothed himself he clothed himself
[58:06] in the garments of vengeance so he's
[58:09] saying that he is
[58:10] fully ready to execute on all of his
[58:14] people's
[58:14] enemies he's saying i've got this
[58:18] instead of you saying i've got this so
[58:21] he put on the garments of vengeance for
[58:24] clothing
[58:25] and it means that he would go forth to
[58:28] vindicate his people
[58:30] and to take vengeance upon his own foes
[58:34] so it is saying that it would not be
[58:36] more or for mere defense that he would
[58:38] be thus
[58:39] armed for battle but you see when god
[58:41] moves forward in battle
[58:43] it is in defense for one purpose and for
[58:46] his people
[58:48] so when we see god dressing for war
[58:51] we know that it's a purpose behind it
[58:55] now god that's don't dress for war for
[58:57] any occasion
[58:58] but god dresses for war for certain
[59:00] situations
[59:02] and god puts on the garments of
[59:05] vengeance when it comes
[59:07] to his children
[59:10] so many times we enjoy fighting our
[59:13] battles
[59:13] we enjoy doing these things but god is
[59:16] telling you
[59:17] i am the one that is going to receive
[59:20] the victory
[59:21] and i'm going to bring it to pass now
[59:23] you'll be able to enjoy the victory
[59:25] you'll be able to enjoy what i'm going
[59:27] to do but don't take it from me
[59:33] oh hallelujah so many times doctors want
[59:36] his victory
[59:37] so many times people want his victory
[59:39] but god says don't take what
[59:41] is rightfully mine you see i'm the one
[59:45] that's going to bring
[59:46] about your deliverance i'm the one
[59:47] that's going to bring about your
[59:49] salvation
[59:50] i'm the one that's going to bring about
[59:51] your healing don't take that from me
[59:56] oh hallelujah
[59:59] the bible says that he clad himself
[1:00:02] with a zeal as a cloak and when you look
[1:00:06] at a warrior in battle and
[1:00:09] what that cloak is it's a loose flowing
[1:00:12] robe
[1:00:13] that is fastened around the shoulder and
[1:00:15] goes through the loin parts and is
[1:00:17] clasped on the shoulder
[1:00:19] by a clasp and usually
[1:00:22] this this this cloak of zeal
[1:00:25] is purple in color to represent the zeal
[1:00:29] of vengeance in a warfare and so
[1:00:32] jesus is saying to us is that i'm
[1:00:35] wearing the scarlet rope that i am
[1:00:38] wearing these things in representation
[1:00:41] of the zeal
[1:00:42] that i have against the enemy that was
[1:00:45] back there in the garden that slipped
[1:00:47] under the walls
[1:00:49] and he is saying i am wearing this cloak
[1:00:52] to make sure that
[1:00:53] i am sowing forth my seal to bring about
[1:00:57] deliverance
[1:00:58] and a vengeance to my children
[1:01:02] the bible said that the seal of the lord
[1:01:06] hath eaten me up
[1:01:11] you remember when jesus went there and
[1:01:13] he began to
[1:01:14] he began to plot that rope and he began
[1:01:16] to get angry
[1:01:17] and he got all upset because what they
[1:01:20] had turned the house of god into
[1:01:22] and he told them that they were making
[1:01:24] his house
[1:01:25] a den of thieves and he began to take
[1:01:28] this rope
[1:01:29] and he began to beat down the money
[1:01:31] changers and overthrow the tables
[1:01:34] and the disciples remembered that the
[1:01:37] seal
[1:01:38] of the lord's health has e in me
[1:01:41] up you're talking about a seal
[1:01:46] but this is not an earthly zeal that
[1:01:48] people have well i'm going to the house
[1:01:50] of god
[1:01:51] and i'm going to do this thing i'm going
[1:01:53] to bring about victory but this
[1:01:55] is a godly zeal
[1:01:59] this is a zeal that can only come from
[1:02:02] above
[1:02:04] because there was great religions in the
[1:02:06] world
[1:02:07] but they still did not have this eel yes
[1:02:09] there was zealots in the land
[1:02:11] but they did not have the zeal of the
[1:02:14] house
[1:02:14] of the lord but here the house
[1:02:18] was standing in front of them with a
[1:02:20] seal
[1:02:23] to show that i have come forth
[1:02:26] to manifest these things
[1:02:31] you see the more satan labors against us
[1:02:34] and makes every effort against us
[1:02:38] to to thwart us
[1:02:42] to stop us to make us doubt god's
[1:02:46] promises
[1:02:48] so much more does god
[1:02:52] kindle with zeal
[1:03:02] all satan's efforts
[1:03:05] will be defeated
[1:03:08] [Music]
[1:03:14] all of his efforts how many's fought the
[1:03:17] enemy this week
[1:03:21] so god has wanted to tell you that
[1:03:23] tonight
[1:03:26] i'm dressing for war
[1:03:35] not andrew spencer not william borlaphon
[1:03:39] not josh jones you're dealing with a
[1:03:42] church has got you back
[1:03:44] in the natural and in the supernatural
[1:03:48] we got you back you can lean on us
[1:03:51] we'll help you i'm looking at some
[1:03:54] people that'll help me in battle
[1:03:56] but god is saying to you
[1:03:59] that i am dressing myself
[1:04:02] for warfare and when he begins to dress
[1:04:06] himself there is only one thing
[1:04:09] that he has in mind and that is
[1:04:12] complete victory now there's one thing
[1:04:15] for you and i to get in our mind that
[1:04:17] we're going to go
[1:04:18] forth and we're going to conquer but
[1:04:21] when god says
[1:04:22] i'm dressing myself he don't just get
[1:04:25] dressed up for any reason
[1:04:26] he gets dressed up for his children and
[1:04:29] he says i'm dressing myself in this hour
[1:04:33] to show myself as a man of war
[1:04:41] oh hallelujah the bible says in psalm 68
[1:04:44] let
[1:04:45] god arise and let his enemies be
[1:04:47] scattered let them also that hate him
[1:04:49] flee before him
[1:04:51] that smoke is driven away so drive them
[1:04:53] away as wax
[1:04:55] melteth before the fire so let the
[1:04:57] wicked perish at the presence of god
[1:05:00] but let the righteous be glad let them
[1:05:03] rejoice before
[1:05:04] god yay let them exceedingly rejoice
[1:05:08] sing unto god
[1:05:11] sing praises to his name extol him that
[1:05:15] rideth upon the heavens
[1:05:17] by his name yah and rejoice before him
[1:05:22] oh he's arising and there's a people
[1:05:26] that is extolling and rejoicing and
[1:05:34] praising
[1:05:38] you're rejoicing the people of god are
[1:05:40] rejoicing
[1:05:41] the children of god are rejoicing but
[1:05:44] the wicked
[1:05:46] is fleeing the wicked is trembling
[1:05:50] because god has arisen
[1:05:54] you see what they have missed they've
[1:05:57] looked at god
[1:05:58] throughout the the old testament they
[1:06:00] looked at god through
[1:06:01] through the church ages but they missed
[1:06:03] him and they're
[1:06:04] calling for zeal they're calling for
[1:06:07] repentance
[1:06:08] they're calling for revivals but they
[1:06:10] miss the awakening of the bride
[1:06:14] they did not recognize this day and its
[1:06:17] visitation
[1:06:18] in this hour and they miss the man of
[1:06:20] war
[1:06:21] as he stood up like never before to show
[1:06:23] i
[1:06:24] am he
[1:06:32] messiah is represented as a warrior
[1:06:36] that is armed at all points and there's
[1:06:39] nothing that can break his armor
[1:06:41] you know god's weapon of choice is his
[1:06:44] word
[1:06:46] he will never be defeated it'll defeat
[1:06:48] satan anytime
[1:06:50] anyplace under any circumstance he'll
[1:06:53] win your victories
[1:06:54] it'll win your healing it'll win your
[1:06:56] deliverances
[1:06:59] this is god's weapon of choice
[1:07:04] in exodus chapter 15 when the
[1:07:07] when they when they when the children of
[1:07:09] israel had come through
[1:07:12] come through the red sea and they got
[1:07:14] out on the other side and they begin to
[1:07:16] rejoice before the lord
[1:07:19] moses began to sing a song and verse 3
[1:07:23] says the lord is a man
[1:07:27] of war he is a man
[1:07:31] he is a man of war the lord
[1:07:35] is his name you see the object of moses
[1:07:40] was to show that man had no part in this
[1:07:43] victory
[1:07:44] but what was done by the miraculous
[1:07:46] power of god
[1:07:47] and therefore all the glory should be
[1:07:50] resolved to him
[1:07:53] he is saying the lord is his name
[1:07:56] jehovah
[1:07:56] the only true god so he is giving
[1:08:00] to the children of israel that all the
[1:08:03] complete existence of his promises
[1:08:06] is in this man
[1:08:10] oh hallelujah you remember on the other
[1:08:12] side of that river
[1:08:14] moses stood up and told them that it's
[1:08:16] the lord that's going to fight your
[1:08:18] battles
[1:08:19] don't you be afraid of that sea and
[1:08:21] don't you be afraid of that
[1:08:22] army i am the lord that will fight your
[1:08:26] battles
[1:08:29] and god dressed himself oh hallelujah it
[1:08:33] was more than a rod that went across
[1:08:35] that sea
[1:08:36] it was an angel that went and got so mad
[1:08:40] he got so mad because the enemy was
[1:08:43] chasing down
[1:08:45] he was chasing down god's children
[1:08:48] i spoke to the lord this morning i said
[1:08:50] god i don't know what you're chasing
[1:08:53] down
[1:08:53] by putting me on this thought but you're
[1:08:56] chasing down
[1:08:57] something you're chasing down
[1:09:00] something i say to you church the angel

[1:11:51] how in the world he's going to get on
[1:11:53] the inside of them walls because he knew
[1:11:55] that that was his inheritance he knew it
[1:11:59] belonged to him
[1:12:00] and he knew that the enemy had moved in
[1:12:02] there and they were inhabiting his
[1:12:04] promise
[1:12:05] and he was standing there and as he was
[1:12:08] standing there contemplating how in the
[1:12:09] world am i going to get in here
[1:12:11] him being a stone mason knowing how much
[1:12:13] and how thick those walls were
[1:12:15] he knew every ins and outs about making
[1:12:17] brick and mortar
[1:12:18] but there was a one that knew how to
[1:12:21] break those walls down standing there
[1:12:23] and joshua looked at him and he had his
[1:12:26] sworn drawn in his hand
[1:12:28] he is showing to you that he's already

[1:13:09] when this bible came open i remember
[1:13:13] when it came open
[1:13:14] i remember when it was closed to me i
[1:13:17] remember
[1:13:18] how i felt how i fought the enemies
[1:13:21] how i fought these things and it seemed
[1:13:24] like they continuously
[1:13:26] bore me down but i remember the night
[1:13:29] that the book came open
[1:13:32] it was no longer a closed book it was no
[1:13:34] longer a sword
[1:13:36] in a sheath but it was a sword that was
[1:13:39] drawn
[1:13:40] and when the book came open it was no
[1:13:43] longer a close book
[1:13:44] it was an open book
[1:13:47] and i realized the power of the third
[1:13:50] pull
[1:13:51] that it was not just for brother branham
[1:13:54] but it was for me
[1:13:56] oh children if you could ever take a
[1:13:58] look at this sword
[1:14:00] that it was not just meant for a prophet
[1:14:02] but it was meant for a people
[1:14:04] to take you out to pull you out
[1:14:08] to lift you up
[1:14:16] the devil has showed up at a good place
[1:14:18] to get a black eye

[1:23:33] branham that night you remember
[1:23:35] and he stood there and he said no he
[1:23:37] said don't worry he said i know the fbi
[1:23:39] personally i said
[1:23:40] he said i highly doubt that they've got
[1:23:41] anything to do with divine healing here
[1:23:45] he said well wherever they say we're so
[1:23:46] sorry for spreading all the good news oh
[1:23:48] that's what you're supposed to do that's
[1:23:51] what the devil wants to keep you from
[1:23:52] doing and spreading the good news
[1:23:56] is that right he's trying to keep you
[1:23:58] from spreading this message
[1:24:00] and sharing the good news the gospel is
[1:24:02] the good news
[1:24:03] but i want to tell you church that the
[1:24:06] gospel is good news but it's more than
[1:24:08] just good news that
[1:24:10] that jesus christ has risen from the
[1:24:12] grave
[1:24:13] and he conquered death hell and the
[1:24:15] grave but i want to tell you the good
[1:24:17] news today is that he is now risen in
[1:24:20] bright form
[1:24:21] to conquer every tomb of denomination
[1:24:23] every sin and every doubt
[1:24:25] every flusteration everything he's risen
[1:24:28] and a bride

[1:24:32] body
[1:24:37] mother banham goes he goes and takes
[1:24:40] he goes and takes the platform and he
[1:24:43] says well they tell
[1:24:44] me the fbi is here tonight to expose me
[1:24:48] he said so why don't you come on down
[1:24:50] here and do it
[1:24:53] why don't you come on down here and do
[1:24:54] it he said he told those girls he said
[1:24:57] now look
[1:24:58] you have watched god as a healer but you
[1:25:01] watch god as a warrior
[1:25:04] you think he's good and healing you
[1:25:06] watch him when he goes to war
[1:25:08] when he goes to fighting for his
[1:25:09] children that's when god shows forth his
[1:25:12] majesty
[1:25:13] and his glory when the devil goes to
[1:25:15] trying to whisper in your ear
[1:25:17] that you're not god's child then god
[1:25:19] gets mad
[1:25:20] and puts on the cloak of vengeance
[1:25:26] you watch him as a warrior one time have
[1:25:28] you watched him
[1:25:31] i watched him a few times and he and
[1:25:33] every one time walked into that battle
[1:25:35] and come out
[1:25:36] with his lips sticking out
[1:25:39] but i have watched the devil walk out
[1:25:43] more than a lip sticking out eyes
[1:25:45] halfway hanging out
[1:25:49] he said if the fbi's here won't you step
[1:25:52] out and expose me for being an imposter
[1:25:54] you said i'm simon the sorcerer why
[1:25:56] don't you step out
[1:25:58] and all of a sudden the spirit of the
[1:25:59] lord began to move
[1:26:01] and he said no it's not the fbi
[1:26:05] it's them two backslidden preachers
[1:26:07] standing up there in that balcony
[1:26:09] that they devised this plan while they
[1:26:11] were sitting together
[1:26:12] he said if i be simonides or sir
[1:26:16] let god strike me dead but why don't you
[1:26:18] come down here and take my place
[1:26:20] and let's see who's right and who's
[1:26:22] wrong and those men ran out of that
[1:26:24] building as fast as they could
[1:26:26] it was a showdown between god and satan
[1:26:29] and god won god is dressing himself
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:42] psalms 3 and 6 says that i will not be
[1:26:45] afraid of ten thousands of people
[1:26:47] that have set themselves against me
[1:26:49] round about arise o lord and save me o
[1:26:52] my god for thou hast smitten
[1:26:55] all mine enemies upon the cheekbone
[1:26:58] and thou has broken the teeth of the
[1:27:00] ungodly
[1:27:02] salvation belongeth unto the lord thy
[1:27:05] the blessing is upon
[1:27:09] my people
[1:27:13] y'all thought i was just talking from my
[1:27:16] own
[1:27:17] from my own thinking about the devil
[1:27:18] walking away with a busted up lip
[1:27:21] david had already told me that
[1:27:24] that god breaks the teeth of the ungodly
[1:27:29] if i preach something to you it's either
[1:27:31] going to be in quote form
[1:27:33] or bible form but look here
[1:27:37] now jesus was man and he called himself
[1:27:40] the son of man
[1:27:41] he said that was a death blow to the
[1:27:44] death
[1:27:44] the devil is high he built himself a
[1:27:46] kingdom more beautiful than michael's
[1:27:48] and cain his son wanted to make a more
[1:27:50] pretty altar
[1:27:52] all over the fruits and things and god
[1:27:53] doesn't dwell in that kind of beauty
[1:27:56] but god to strike the death blow to sin
[1:27:59] look how he came how he how did he
[1:28:02] choose to come
[1:28:03] there was a conference in heaven how are
[1:28:05] you going how are you going to do it
[1:28:07] father
[1:28:08] said the angels father said to the
[1:28:10] angels
[1:28:11] he said i'm going to become one of them
[1:28:14] my law of redemption is a near kinsman
[1:28:17] and i have to be man myself that's
[1:28:20] the strike that knocks satan
[1:28:25] you see they were looking for a general
[1:28:30] when they were looking for a messiah
[1:28:31] they were looking for a mighty leader a
[1:28:33] military genius
[1:28:35] one that was scientific genius but god
[1:28:38] gave him a lamb
[1:28:40] he'd give them a baby what a contrast
[1:28:44] you think they'd accept that crying
[1:28:46] child but that's what they needed
[1:28:50] god gives you according to your needs
[1:28:54] they got a baby when they was wanting a
[1:28:56] general
[1:28:57] but they got a baby meek lowly and god
[1:29:01] knew they're neat
[1:29:08] god may not give you what you expect
[1:29:11] but god will give you exactly what you
[1:29:13] need
[1:29:16] you didn't mean he'd need a military
[1:29:18] genius you needed a baby
[1:29:22] you needed one to take on the robe of
[1:29:24] humanity
[1:29:26] and when jesus came he didn't dress
[1:29:29] himself in some great splendor
[1:29:32] but he dressed himself in a robe
[1:29:35] of humanity he took on the form of
[1:29:39] humanity
[1:29:41] to be made like you and i to feel like
[1:29:44] you and i
[1:29:46] to understand like you and i placed in a
[1:29:52] manger
[1:29:53] in a manure pile an illegitimate name
[1:29:57] tacked to it
[1:30:01] and his business was not
[1:30:04] a carpenter but his business was the
[1:30:07] father's business
[1:30:10] that's why when you go and you look at
[1:30:12] jesus
[1:30:13] in luke chapter 2 through 42 52 and you
[1:30:17] see
[1:30:17] jesus and his mother and his and his
[1:30:20] father joseph
[1:30:22] they leave him there they walk off and
[1:30:24] they leave him
[1:30:26] and they go about look what they do they
[1:30:29] go about looking at their kin folk
[1:30:32] and they look at their acquaintance to
[1:30:34] find where jesus
[1:30:35] is mary was denying the very
[1:30:39] supernatural birth that had taken place
[1:30:41] in her life
[1:30:42] by going around and seeking these things
[1:30:45] but as soon
[1:30:46] as she got to jesus jesus
[1:30:50] began to correct the error but
[1:30:53] could you imagine mary's spot of view
[1:30:58] losing jesus
[1:31:01] i'm afraid that too many people
[1:31:05] have done the same thing they left jesus
[1:31:09] and they looked everywhere else
[1:31:10] but back at the place where they left
[1:31:12] him
[1:31:15] hallelujah they looked everywhere
[1:31:18] but the place that they left him and
[1:31:21] most of the time if you'll go to search
[1:31:23] and where you left him
[1:31:25] you left him when you left the word
[1:31:34] this humanity took on such a robe
[1:31:38] that he looked like the others
[1:31:42] he walked and he dressed himself
[1:31:45] like other humanity
[1:31:48] but there was so much humanity about him
[1:31:52] but there was so much deity about him
[1:31:54] that at 12 years old he could stand
[1:31:56] there
[1:31:57] and astonish the doctors and the
[1:31:59] philosophers and the priests of that day
[1:32:02] they were looking for a general but god
[1:32:04] had robed himself
[1:32:07] in the form of humanity
[1:32:11] they wanted somebody that they could
[1:32:13] attach their name to that he's sadducee
[1:32:16] or his pharisee or he's of this sect of
[1:32:18] group
[1:32:21] but he came and he took home
[1:32:26] a name
[1:32:29] oh when he came in that name yeah there
[1:32:32] was other
[1:32:33] there was other joshuas there was other
[1:32:36] jehovah saviors
[1:32:38] there was other jesus's but when he took
[1:32:40] on this
[1:32:41] name he came and he took on the name of
[1:32:46] jesus
[1:32:47] and he was coming to save his people
[1:32:50] from their sins
[1:32:54] there have been other jesuses but there
[1:32:56] was only one lord jesus christ
[1:32:59] you can be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:33:02] but it'll never do you no good
[1:33:04] but when you take on the lordship of our
[1:33:07] jesus
[1:33:08] christ then you take on more than just a
[1:33:11] man
[1:33:12] you take on god
[1:33:16] there ain't no power there ain't no
[1:33:19] power in being baptized
[1:33:20] in the name of father son and holy ghost
[1:33:23] those are just
[1:33:24] titles but when you take on his name and
[1:33:27] christian baptism
[1:33:29] you are identifying that you have died
[1:33:31] to yourself
[1:33:33] and you are taking on a name oh
[1:33:36] hallelujah
[1:33:38] that name is high above every other name
[1:33:40] that name will save
[1:33:42] when no other name will save that name
[1:33:44] will deliver with no other name whatever
[1:33:47] he dressed himself in the robe of
[1:33:50] humanity
[1:33:51] to go to warfare
[1:33:56] oh if you look at the man jesus
[1:33:59] the bible said that they looked at him
[1:34:04] when he said that he knew abraham and he
[1:34:07] was but 30 years old
[1:34:09] and they said how can this man being 50
[1:34:12] years old be able to know
[1:34:13] abraham but he was under such a stress
[1:34:16] float
[1:34:19] of the burden of the word of the lord
[1:34:24] that this humanity
[1:34:30] was everything that god was
[1:34:33] needing to destroy sin
[1:34:40] there'd been other flesh born before but
[1:34:43] there had never been one that was virgin
[1:34:45] born
[1:34:46] and everything that god needed for
[1:34:49] warfare was dressed in this humanity
[1:34:52] to defeat sin to defeat sickness to
[1:34:55] defeat adultery
[1:34:56] to defeat lasciviousness to defeat
[1:34:59] malice and strife
[1:35:00] everything was dressed in this
[1:35:04] man jesus
[1:35:12] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:35:26] he said that day at calvary
[1:35:29] was the death blow to satan's power
[1:35:35] it ended everything
[1:35:43] it ended everything
[1:35:52] but we get so busy
[1:35:58] we get so caught up
[1:36:02] and we forget the one that was lifted up
[1:36:13] he dressed himself in such a way
[1:36:17] that satan would say charlie
[1:36:22] surely he can't be the one
[1:36:27] surely he won't let me hit him like this
[1:36:32] surely surely if he'd be the son of god
[1:36:36] he wouldn't let me whip him like this
[1:36:39] surely if he be the messiah
[1:36:43] that's been promised
[1:36:48] he would raise in power
[1:36:52] and he'd strike back my hand
[1:36:55] he was so robed and dressed in a weapon
[1:36:58] of warfare
[1:37:06] that's satan
[1:37:10] satan said it can't be him
[1:37:14] it can't be him
[1:37:18] he wouldn't let me hang him on a cross
[1:37:21] if it was really him
[1:37:26] he wouldn't let me put this crown of
[1:37:28] thorns on him
[1:37:30] if it was really him
[1:37:36] but that day at calvary
[1:37:41] it ended everything every strike that
[1:37:44] the devil had
[1:37:45] coming to it ended everything
[1:37:49] he had a punch coming from you but that
[1:37:52] day at
[1:37:52] calvary jesus took suicide away from you
[1:37:56] that day at calvary took depression away
[1:37:59] from you
[1:38:01] that day at calvary took death away from
[1:38:04] you
[1:38:05] so stop allowing that devil to beat you
[1:38:09] up
[1:38:09] with an ended thing
[1:38:13] it's time that you start looking at the
[1:38:17] devil
[1:38:17] and say is this the man
[1:38:26] god's chasing down something tonight and
[1:38:29] i'm just
[1:38:32] i'm just stupid enough to follow him for
[1:38:33] a moment he's chasing down something
[1:38:37] it's time that you start looking at the
[1:38:40] thing that has afflicted you
[1:38:43] and said is this the man
[1:38:46] that overthrew that overthrew the
[1:38:50] kingdoms
[1:38:54] this this thing

[1:39:12] swag about yourself

[1:39:19] 15's and 30 years old
[1:39:21] i'm 30 couple and i still don't know
[1:39:22] that 30 year old language
[1:39:26] but i have heard stuff being being in
[1:39:29] this youth choir that i ain't ever heard
[1:39:31] in my life
[1:39:35] i thought the stuff we had when i was 15
[1:39:37] was stupid
[1:39:40] oh forgive me

[1:40:07] but young people have a little bit of
[1:40:09] swag
[1:40:10] about themselves you forgive me for
[1:40:14] this for a moment but it's a time
[1:40:18] that the children of god get a little
[1:40:21] bit of
[1:40:22] swag about themselves
[1:40:26] and say is this is this the thing
[1:40:32] that i allowed to torment me in my night
[1:40:35] seasons
[1:40:38] yeah go ahead you're the children of god
[1:40:42] you can have an attitude with the devil
[1:40:44] because he can't touch one hair of your
[1:40:46] head

[1:40:51] of swag about yourself

[1:41:36] tormenting spirit
[1:41:41] i understand those things i understand
[1:41:44] that
[1:41:46] then when you can't even say nothing
[1:41:49] but everybody around you understands
[1:41:51] that
[1:41:52] you're going through something
[1:41:55] i understand that you're afraid to talk
[1:42:00] about those things that are so
[1:42:03] so personal to you
[1:42:07] but can i encourage you tonight
[1:42:10] that when you get to that spot
[1:42:14] that you let god dress himself and begin
[1:42:16] to pray through you
[1:42:21] just think just encourage yourself right
[1:42:22] here and let god dress himself
[1:42:26] and you would allow you'd allow
[1:42:31] god to begin to work through that
[1:42:34] humanity
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:39] that the things that have haunted you
[1:42:42] and
[1:42:43] just begin to war so deeply in your mind

[1:42:58] of taking it back
[1:43:00] that fulfillment of taking it back is
[1:43:02] getting everything back
[1:43:06] it's not allowing those things to stay
[1:43:08] over there on the other side
[1:43:09] but it's fulfilling taking it back and
[1:43:12] when you fulfill getting it back
[1:43:15] it's no longer taking it back it's
[1:43:17] saying i got it
[1:43:20] so you can take back you can take
