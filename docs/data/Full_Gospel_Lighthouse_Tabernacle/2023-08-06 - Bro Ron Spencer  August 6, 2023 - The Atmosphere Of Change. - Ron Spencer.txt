for a moment if you'd like to amen I bring you greetings from Edmonton Canada brother Ed hammermeister's church and we had wonderful meetings there to me I thought it was the greatest meetings that we've ever had there but we're getting closer to the coming of the Lord so had a wonderful wonderful time there but with Brother Ray Erickson and brother Nathan his grandson preaching for us that was just with us and and had awesome meetings there and well attended and so God just did amazing things and then we went to brother Joe Greene some of you were there thank you for coming and and we had incredible meetings there a prayer line on Friday night and and they got out about 12 30 I believe it was and so uh I thought they was going to tear the building down so God did just incredible things there and so then brother Andrew don't mean to go quick over these things but brother Andrew is and Brother David Mayer is at Mount Baker you can be proud of that guy he has he has hit he hit two home runs this week and uh amen they're really thrilled with with what God has did and Brother David Mayer will be speaking the last service here in a few hours and so for their Sunday morning service last night they got out after midnight so so they had an awesome time and so I'm just thankful to be a part of what God is doing I'm really thrilled it's not up to a man and it's not the personality of a man that's doing this it's God that's doing it and we're just right in the middle of it it says that we're getting ready to go home prodigals are coming in from everywhere and so that tells us it signals to us that the Rapture is Right imminent and at hands so we're just thankful for what God is doing this morning we want to bring all of our school uh it's one it's a good tradition all of our school children and that includes the homeschoolers and and the the parents of the homeschoolers and then everybody that's from a school bus driver to the attendant teachers and all of that if you will come and we want to have prayer with you this morning for protection and then God to watch over you and be there with you and uh amen Sarah's probably in Siberia isn't she so so Sarah we're going to pray for you vicariously so amen so is nobody going to school [Applause] amen I haven't seen these guys for a couple weeks you forgive me amen hey let's all kind of get close here and we'll get a

want to take girls hands yeah they won't bite they won't bite that bad until they get older all right now could we all pray Heavenly Father what an incredible thing that you give us the miracle of children [Music] Lord Lord you took the time to bless children father now Lord Jesus says they prepare to go to school some of them's already started now we ask you that you would be with them as they go I ask you that you would dispatch angels [Music] some will ride by car some will ride by bus some will even walk even those in the home we ask you for protection [Music] we ask you to watch over them brighten their minds that they might be able to comprehend what they're learning lord it's as a child our minds are molded I pray that you would watch over them Father may you protect them Lord even the teachers the attendants the helpers the drivers of school buses dear God we ask you as a family of a church we pray that you would be with them help them Father even the ones that Lord call us our church on the internet we ask you to watch over their children Lord bless the teachers give them as brother William preached last night patience Lord I pray that they can mentor the children Lord in a very dark age now Lord Jesus these children are the light of the world now Lord we ask you that they be may be a light in darkness that their light would be brighter than the darkness may they not be consumed by it Lord even their friendships may they be very attentive of who's their friends Lord not that we're trying to shun the world what we're trying to guard our heart minister to this father bless our children today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen and amen God bless you guys bless you bless you amen [Music] amen salvation money [Music] because I'm happy sister Denise would you come I see because [Music] is all the span [Music] and I know about you sister Denise has surgery tomorrow it's quite a long surgery and we just are praying that God would just help her with this in the name of the Lord thank God she can walk thank God that she could move around and doctors are trying to help her that's what that's what it's all about but we're going to ask the Lord to be with her Lord Jesus that sister Denise goes for surgery tomorrow I asked you now father that you would anoint the mind and the gift not only the doctor but those helping him the nurses that will attend and the attendance [Music] Lord we know that there will be an angel that will stand there in that operating room doctors are their ability their gifts are to try to help Humanity suffering Humanity Lord we don't do these surgeries because we're just to try to just to be another operation but we try to get better and Lord we just ask you now that you would help her father Lord come now now doctors will do their work but you're the Healer Lord we just ask you now that you would touch her father even today begin the healing process we pray in the name of Jesus Christ and we're careful to give you all the things of the glory in Jesus name especially [Music] amen amen amen how's your dad today brother Andy okay good to see you sister Linda sure been praying for you sure been praying for you all of you there for those that don't know a suffering Dimension a lot of UTIs and kind of out of his head became aggressive and that that happens to a lot of people it shows that our soul is saved that Gene seed of God is there but it shows that this flesh is not saved it's you know the Holy Ghost as long as it's there it calls the bridle on it but when the Mind begins to deteriorate isn't that a cruel It's a cruel enemy that we fight and so we want to pray for Brother Bill that God would just touch him and and calm his spirit I I think that's the way that we need to pray that God would calm his Spirit down and and uh to where he wouldn't be a danger to Sister Linda or even even wander Seth or Randy I think Randy could probably take care of himself but you know we want to make sure we want to make sure and I would just make sure there's no no weapons in the house if I could give you that I think you've already done that but it's a difficult time so we want to remember him in prayer all the others that are I think that God would just touch them in a special way amen amen amen God knows how to take care of all things and amen so if your loved one would slip in that realm and they begin to they begin to say things it's ugly just know that isn't them that is not them that's that's that old nature and that's an enemy that's crept in it and thank God there's a land beyond the river just thank God that there's a land beyond the river where he takes all wrongs and makes all wrongs right and so amen we love you today and we thank you for being here thank you for your giving thank you for all the things that you've done and your prayers for us over the last couple of weeks and let's stand to our feet today amen if you will turn with me to Saint John chapter 3 and then we'll go to Luke chapter 19 and verse 1. I'd like to speak to you today and I know I won't get done but I want to speak to you today on the atmosphere of change the atmosphere of change amen Hallelujah atmosphere of Change John chapter 3 and verse 2. you have it just say Amen and the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man notice he identifies his life his works for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him what a statement isn't it and Jesus answered and said unto him verbally Burly I said unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Jesus's first teaching Zacchaeus or in Luke chapter 19 and verse 1. Luke 19 and verse 1. and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named Zacchaeus which was a chief among the publicans and he was rich and he sought to see Jesus who was who he was and could not for the Press because he was little in statute and he ran before and climbed up and into a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus May taste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully now notice the atmosphere of people around him and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner well Jesus came to save the sinners didn't come to save righteous but he came to save the Sinners may the Lord bless the reading of his word this today you may be seated huh brother Branham when he was going to go to Mexico there was a there was a a general that had got a touch from the Lord in his ministry and he loved brother Branham and he actually he actually was a great way for brother Branham to get to to Mexico and there was if you remember there was a bishop Mexico being a Catholic country there was a bishop that tried to stop it and so the bishop said that that this man is you know he's not one of us we don't want him here we don't want him preaching to our people and he just basically called him a Beelzebub type of of a minister and and so this General was talking to the bishop and he says you know but he's going to preach and he's been greatly blessed and he'll bless our people and the bishop calls him an ignorant man he'll preach to ignorant people and I thought the general made an incredible statement to him he said you've had them for hundreds of years why are they still ignorant and if you'll notice the meeting takes place and God came to the meeting because if you remember there was a man that was blind brother Adam even makes the statement when he came up that that he he was about the Statue of his father and uh he just loved the atmosphere of our prophet he says he said I looked at him he's about the size of my daddy and he said I slipped up close to him wondering if my coat would fit him brother Branham never weighed over 150 pounds in his life and he said I wondered if my coat would fit him and he said I slid my foot to the side of his foot to see if my shoes would fitting and he and he said he said because love moved him and he began to pray for him and the man was healed we all know this story and we quote it so many times of the that little baby that was a uh that was dead and that morning the mother the baby died of pneumonia and and she had she had taken it to the doctor and the doctors told her just quickly go bury your dead baby well she had saw so many things happen the night before until she had another place to take her baby and she stood in the rain all day with her baby and so she stood there and and she stood there and now there's 300 ushers and the the crowd was incredibly huge and and she all she knew was I got to get to that man I just got to get to that man and so she began to press her way through and as she presses her way through she she goes under she goes around she's presses she's not giving up she's not going to the cemetery she's not going to a place to bury her baby she's she's going to get to that man she's determined I think if we could come to church with that kind of determination and and she and she began to press her way through and as she presses her way through and you know she makes her way and Billy Paul you know she's she's she's trying to get on the stage and they're pushing her off of the stage and you know and Billy Paul finally comes to her daddy to to his daddy and says you know and I'm just paraphrasing here Daddy we've got this woman she's made her way through 300 ushers and and she's determined to get to you and and and brother brother Branham turns around to one of the brothers that that is bald headed like himself and about his age and he said she don't know who I am and he said why don't you go pray for her and as he's on his way to pray for he saw the vision and he said just a moment let me pray niece brother brother Billy Paul turns around to him and he says well Daddy Daddy and he says you understand he said I've saw the vision he said yes go to her and so they bring the baby and the baby of course is stiff by now and he's got a blanket over the baby and and as he begins to pray I can imagine what brother branham's own heart being a father being a daddy holding his own children a baby that had died in his own life and and placed her there with her mother now he's holding a dead baby feeling what that woman's feeling see you can't get anything until you have love and so and so he he's holding that baby and he begins to pray and before long he felt that little blanket warming up he felt that little blanket warming up and then it begins to kick a little bit that woman handed him a dead baby with faith and he handed her a baby that was alive glory be to God I think sometimes when we come to church we don't realize that we walked in maybe dead and trespasses and sins and we walked in one way and then we walk out a complete different way I want to speak to you about atmosphere atmosphere is incredible that's why we sing that's why we worship that's why we pray we pray before church and we ask the Lord and we begin to read our scriptures and and we begin to talk to God and ask him what would you have for us this morning how would you deal with this this morning after Friday night's prayer line and I was totally exhausted and I was just totally wore out and brother Alden was so great and sister Tracy was so great to drive us down and drive us back from North Carolina but I felt the sweetest spirit when I woke up yesterday morning and I was weary and tired and you know and all the different kind of blood pressures that you've got to deal with and the sugar you got to deal with and and I was just I just felt the sweetest presence and the Lord began to deal with me to kind of take some things this morning and and last night when brother William preached I thought what an incredible sermon that he spoke last night and I'm not going to pray for patience but I've been through a few things that's developed some patience in our lives Jesus was standing one day and he was preaching and and he's preaching he says you're the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior wherewith it be salted since forth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under the foot of men and he said ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house notice the statement now let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify the Father which is in heaven you use salt as a preservative you are actually preserving your community you may think that you're not having effect but your atmosphere of Jesus Christ Living on your tenure Temple whether you're at school whether you're on a job maybe you work with thousands of people at a at a job but McKee I'll just take it for instance McKee is a blessed company I know they're a Christian company but they're a blessed company because you work there and you pray for your job you pray for good days you pray for an atmosphere around you and yet even in that atmosphere you have difficult days but what would it be like if it wasn't Jesus living there [Music] I know it doesn't prevent us from having difficult days and bad days and situations of life but let me just say we shine our light out and maybe you're the only Bible you're the only sermon of brother branham's that people will ever heal you don't have to preach people a sermon just live people a sermon sometimes when we first get saved we think that we've got to be legalists with everybody well everybody ain't got what you got so you got to remember God's working on you not necessarily on them and you'll come through that stage where God cleans your life up and washes your life up and after a while you can begin to have Grace for other people because God had Grace for you I'm really glad of that when brother Brandon preaches when he preaches the future home which is about a four-hour sermon but the about the first 40 minutes brother Branham spends time on and I think it's incredibly important even to mention here this morning he says I want to thank all the people that have gathered in for the meeting he said you're staying in the hotels and you're going to the restaurants many times it was even the population of Jeffersonville would grow by quite a few because of people attending the meeting they travel from all over the United States when they knew that brother Branham was going to be preaching they stood outside by the hundreds when brother Branham would preach you know we may have difficulty with somebody getting their seat but can you imagine getting there three three and four hours early trying to get in the door then you can't get in the door and now you listen to the you listen to the sermon maybe by the radio or by by the speakers outside and you stand there attentively listen to the prophet of God like future home four hour sermon but in the first 40 to 45 minutes and I don't know the exact number there brother Brandon begins to talk about those that are in the hotel those that are in the restaurants and he has talked to the owners and the managers and they're so complementary of what a special life that they have how nice the people are that comes to your meeting how cordial they are they're just better than any of the world out there they're just such a nice people brother random is very attentive to that maybe people got impatience when he's talking about that but you see the bride gets their change here you see the the change isn't going to happen in the rapture your body will change but but your character changes here your life the token the manifestation of the life of God happens here and it's on display to laodicea that it's taking place in her life because we're going to a place we're going to a place where there's no Liars there's no cheaters there's no fornicators there's no adulterers there's no homosexualities there's no politics oh that's enough to shout right there isn't it you see our atmosphere has to change here and that's why you've got to have God's love you know you're born with a certain amount of love and patience and and virtue and all of those things that go all the way up to to brotherly kindness you're born with that stature perfect man by your natural DNA but when the Holy Ghost comes in your life he gives you a Godly love he gives you a Godly patience he gives you a Godly strength he gives you a Godly brotherly kindness in your life are you with me because before you couldn't love your enemy before you had a temper that would fight a bus song before you were stubborn as a mule he's still working on all of us now [Applause] but the Holy Ghost comes in and saturates your life and now you can you can love your wife you can love your husband like never before you can love one another like never before and if you've truly got the Holy Ghost you can Overlook one another's mistakes oh brother Ron Christians make mistakes Welcome to the Real World [Applause] I think it's incredible that brother Branham goes to especially Topeka in 1964 Full Gospel businessman caused some of the men's name they're powerful men that's in the Full Gospel businessman calls others names there and maybe they're looking for him to preach something incredibly complex maybe something deep maybe something mind-shattering and he preaches a sermon called who is Jesus and he takes a text to wear that that to where that he begins to talk about a man named zacchus now he Compares this businessman that's rich and has great standing in the city and they don't know it but he's actually talking about the people in the pew and now he takes this man and he says his wife has been around Jesus and his disciples and she's now a follower of Jesus but her husband is an unbeliever and she would like for her husband to get near Jesus you know a lot of times and I want to really I want to push this point now you can't educate anybody into Jesus you can't intellectually give speeches into Jesus but if you can come and see if you can come and see in the atmosphere you say oh brother Ron atmosphere is not important well if you went out on a date with your wife and you go to a special place and they've got those yeah you know what I'm talking about and they've got that they got that white table covering and in the middle they got flowers and and you know they got they got candles lit up they turn the lights down a little bit to where you can't see the food and there's music playing behind you that's atmosphere and whether you know it or not you're going to pay for it at the end of the trip and that's why atmosphere in the church is so important it is so important and maybe you know maybe you get a grievance with one another maybe you pick a fight with one another maybe husband and wife would just kind of be on the way to church and and you come to church and you know I got to get to church because I need God and you know you that's why we come in and we sit down and we begin to pray because there's somebody else's coming that may not know the Lord and we want an atmosphere all through this church how many people have told me when they first come here when I walk through the doors I felt something I never felt before Jesus ate 10 million miles away he's more than a pitcher on the wall but I want him to Electrify the atmosphere at this building that's what I pray I want to Electrify the atmosphere of this building I want these children to know that that process is coming to them it's the presence of the Lord I don't want these children to think that they're being made to serve the Lord I want them to fall in love with Jesus you know I think he said let's just have a little drama and as these little drama goes he you can go listen to it but I just want to give a couple highlights here he said he slipped out of bed early in the morning and he put on the best clothes that he had best clothes and as he slips out of bed he he tries to be real quiet because he don't want to wake Rebecca I wonder where brother Brian come up with that one Eve had blonde hair I'm sure brother bam knew Rebecca's name and so he slips out of bed he slips across and said she's awake so what she does is she looks out of the covers and watches him or is he going this early in the morning said after a little while she asked him said where are you going oh I'm going for a walk in his best clothes and he begins to go for a walk and you know he's heard about Jesus and he wants to prove but you know maybe maybe he he's not right and he's going maybe with a you know I wonder what he's all about but he figures out that he can't get to him because Jesus has got a crowd around him and you know he brother Brandon says he said he said you know he said when they were coming toward him he said he knew Jesus was coming because they were singing and he said they were singing and they were screaming he may have enjoyed this church because president said wherever Jesus is a whole lot of noise he begins to make his way and and you know what he he can't get up in the tree I think it's interesting that the prophet said well he grabbed a trash can and he got up on top of it and fell in it he got trash all over him speak all over him and stuff all over him and he finally got himself up into the tree because he was too short to see and he got up in the tree but now he's ashamed of himself and then when he sees his neighbors and the Joneses coming up and their baby has been healed and then another one has been healed and another one begins to get healed and now his critical spirit is softening up his critical spirit is softening up now and you know he's not so tough against Jesus and as he begins to come up and and Jesus stops under the tree listen there's hundreds of people maybe even thousands of people good bad ugly critics religious people great people that you know maybe even people that are pretty strong with the city that might might be able to entertain him real well and he stops under the tree and he looks up and he said Zacchaeus knew his name come down out of the tree make haste come down out of the tree today I'm going to have dinner with you I want to spend a little time with you let me just say this year if you will just take the time to spend with Jesus a little while a lot of people are critical of a lot of things maybe one another until they actually discover what they're all about you know I've had people talk to me about others not necessarily here talk to me about others and I just I just answer them with this so you don't know them very well you wouldn't be so critical if you really knew them or knew their background or where they came from you see life is not a still picture it's not a still picture what you saw in a person at 22 years old is not what they are at 45 how many of you once in a while will look back at your old pictures and there you are slender at your wedding you're standing there in your white tuxedo and Green Bay Packer socks on showing through you don't know that guy's gonna be a preacher one day then you see him a few years later and his hair started to not be read anymore [Music] then after a while you may have hurt him as a young preacher and you know he was just like another young preacher in this church 100 miles an hour dancing all over the building and then when he gets about 60 quietens down a little bit I told Brother Alden on the way to church the other night on Thursday night I said I'm going to Pace myself brother Homer told me said you're old enough now to take care of yourself a little bit we got out of church and brother Alden just looked at me he's a gentleman he said well that's a pretty quick pace [Applause] aren't you glad Life's a movie and not it's still picture now immediately people begin to say this man's a sinner why is Jesus if he is Messiah why is Jesus going to spend the afternoon with a man like Zacchaeus well when Jesus goes there he don't have to preach a sermon to it he don't have to tell him how bad it is but before the evening's over Zacchaeus is a different man and Zacchaeus has done a lot of dirty things in his life before the evening's over the atmosphere of Jesus is making him want to make restitution to everybody that he did wrong repent to everybody around him sometimes let me just bring it up to date sometimes you think why was brother Branham with a man named Bert call who called he called Old lizard eyes the most wicked man that he ever met of all the people that brother Branham could have went hunting with have you ever thought about the woman at the well Jesus went out of his way sent the disciples away and this woman would immediately begin to respond difficult things to Jesus but Jesus knew she had a predestinated seat listen at the end of the story with brother Branham and Bert call Bert call has given his heart to the Lord what an atmosphere even honey even hunting well brother on that's just an isolated incident well they couldn't find any squirrel in in a couple of different sets of wood so so the woods is brother Woods said I I Know a Man over here now brother Brandon you stayed in the car because this man's an Infidel he's a difficult old guy and brother man I'm seeing the difficulty that was going on and you know finally brother Woods says uh I got a preacher with me and and the Infidel said do you mean to tell me that you're so low to you have to haul a preacher around brother Brown didn't go up and tell him it didn't give him no Mysteries he didn't tell him who he was he said can I have an apple all the yellow jackets are eating them up you might as well have one picks it up and he said I see the leaves are turning up here and it's August it's not fall yet wonder what intelligence is telling that tree to protect the roots that's not the seals that's not the godhead it's atmosphere and the man's talking about to him a little bit and then the man says Ah Ah there's one preacher I'd like to meet there's a lady up on the hill she was dying she was dying and and at one of her family members went to a meeting and and they came home with a prayer cloth and laid it on her and and that woman got healed and it was at night when they came back and there was awful this amount of shouting and everything and I told the wife in the morning we'll go up there with the buck board and we'll bring her down off of the off there and help them out and he said when we got up there they told me about the meeting and they told me how that that preacher prayed for her and she got healed are you with me now he said I'd like to meet that Preacher Brother Branham didn't tell him that he was the man he didn't tell him he was the man he talked about the intelligence of what's making that that fluid that sack going up and down in that tree and at the end of the conversation when we get back from hunting if you can tell me what intelligence that is of telling that sap to go back down I'll tell you what intelligence that was that told me about that woman and that Infidel that been that way for now late decades and was proud of being an infidel before the day was over that atmosphere that had came into his yard had so changed his life till now he becomes a Christian brother man shows back up the next year to go hunting there in the and the lady says she wants to run him off and he said well I'm I'm sorry I hunted here last year she said are are you Branham yeah and then she begins to tell him the testimony of how her husband became a real Christian how many people walked in that yard lacking that atmosphere I'd like to say this to you I want that in my life like never before I'm sure in brother Brandon's media when he begins to explain zacchus come down out of the tree no doubt some of the people that were sitting there begin to realize he's not talking about Zach just two thousand years ago he's talking about me sometimes when you're sitting in church and all of a sudden there's a story being told and a story over here being told and a story they're more than stories they're more than stories somebody in the building when I was in Edmonton on Friday night I began to I began or Saturday night I began to just stop and begin to tell testimonies after testimonies then in the prayer line every testimony that I told somebody walked through with that need I can't do that I can't put that together but a greater than Solomon is still in the building he is the same yesterday today and forever says therefore if your conversation is only because your your conversion is only because you're trying to hide behind something or trying to make yourself a better person you're only playing a part of a hypocrite until Christ has actually came into your life and changed you and brought you into an atmosphere that's the difference to it and a man and woman ever walked into the Shekinah Glory of God the whole world shuts off behind him and no matter what the devil says you don't pay no attention to that he's living I love this he's living in a different atmosphere I don't want to drop this tonight he says now gifts is no good unless you're abiding in the Shekinah Glory I love that don't you Jesus says no man can come unto me except my father draws me let me just say this to you when God begins to draw no doubt many want to resist and go a different direction your first husband the world your first nature don't want to die and listen education or or just trying to work your way into the a conversion that won't work many of us just made vows I'm going to not dress this way anymore I'm not going to act this way anymore I'm not going to do this no more now listen let me just say it there's something about fishing preaching and fishing Works a whole lot the same you don't bear clean a fish before you get it in the boat and sometimes as Christians it takes years to clean fish you can preach as hard as you want to on certain subjects but if as a man pulls something off of your life the devil will put it right back on but if you can get the atmosphere of Jesus Christ into your life if you can get that into your life your your parents no no doubt was resistant to what you're doing sitting here but you came in this atmosphere you came to church and you begin to feel it for yourself listen it's got to be personal it's got to be personal between you and God this message is more than about laws and do's and don'ts and deep deep cleaned with doctrines and and reveal word of the hour it's the life of Jesus Christ it's not an additional Bible for you to believe it's actually the glasses for you to read World wants to put you in certain jobs and trash because you've got something they can't find how do you get children like this God does it listen we don't make them do this God does it in their lives and before long there's a love the prophet talks about he says a woman was married to a man that beat her and all these different kind of things that she she did a lot of things for him but it was a grudgery to do things for him that man died and she married a man that she absolutely loved and adored and she found herself doing the same things for him but now she'd love to do it are you with me coming to church if you can fall in love with it you can fall in love let me just say nobody has to convince you to come to church I'm not going to call you if you miss I I I'm not going to call you I'm sorry you stay on a while I'll finally call you and say are you dead but let me just say this I want you to have a love I love to come here I love to serve God I love for one another a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into that man and then it's the life of Jesus Christ on the inside of it then it produces the life that Christ lived the same life that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did Christians oh you must have a personal relationship to God in order to be a Son of God you must become a relation to God he must be your father in order to be his son and you and sons and daughters are saved not members of a church but Sons and Daughters there's only one thing that will produce that and that's the new birth and the new birth is only thing that will produce a personal relationship with God I love that don't you he says now the holy spirit is not a cesspool no no no no no no he said that heart is occupied by the Holy Spirit it is full of Holiness and Purity It quotes the scripture think of no evil doeth no evil believeth all things endureth on long-suffering God won't live in a cesspool are you with me you can't be in love with the world and in love with God at the same time now he says if a pig wants to stick his nuts snouter in a manure pile and eat all day that's his business because he's a pig to begin with but a lamb doesn't do that The Sinner he's a pig to begin with but but when you try to make a lamb out of a pig he has to have a conversion he has to have a different atmosphere and when it comes into that atmosphere his desires change his nature will change that's the way it is today he said then when you become a son and daughter of God your disposition changes your attitude changes your look towards life changes it doesn't mean that you just have to join a church it means that you have been regenerated and you'll become a new creation in Jesus Christ old things have passed away and God has spoken to you and you have become a new creature he said I want to go to down not being a church member but I want to be a new creature in Christ Jesus I love that don't you he's Ezekiel speaks about it that got to give you a new spirit and he says God has to change your original spirit brother I said now that's not the Holy Ghost he said he's got to change your spirit to where he can live with you I love that don't you he has to change your spirit to where he can live with you and then he gives you the Holy Spirit now my grandmother whom I dearly loved she was widowed at 43 years old so she became and it was in a very difficult time waited at 43 years old and and my grandfather was a Christian the last five years of his life but the damage had already been done he had been a drunk he owned five Farms he'd been quite a worker but he but he made moonshine and some of his moonshine would get him to where that he was his eyes would actually turn solid white and it would poison him later would cause cancer in his life but anyway he was 10 years older than my grandmother he took butcher knives to her he beat her she was just a piece of his property he tried to burn the house down with my mom and and Ronnie inside of it with my grandmother he pushed my grandmother down a set of steps about 15 Steps down pushed her down them steps and she rolled like a ball and those were difficult conversations for her to bring back up so she became a woman that was very defensive and and you know her language was not good I'm saying that very kindly here her language was not good I've told you how that she could in her stubbornness she could have a little you know deal with you tiff with you and then she could live in the same house bedroom right right to next to your bedroom and she wouldn't speak to you for two weeks same table God had to give her a new spirit he had to give her a new spirit then he had to give her the Holy Ghost now she got converted she came to church she did real well but that old nature would show up on him my little boys was playing one time and they were they were playing in the Pew and you know kids are kids try to do your best with your children thank God we got we got kids here and if they get a little noisy you know take them out we're not going to beat him to death please don't beat him to death but anyway take care of them train up your child train them to come to church train them behave but my little boys were they were playing and and you know they were doing a little dancing well the Deacon was pretty legalist he may listen to this but he was pretty legalist and so he was getting all over Connie and it went real well because Connie's got a really nice spirit to her my grandmother was sitting just across the way she took him by the arm and she walked him out of church I would later ask her what did you tell him she said I needed more of Jesus since we're all Angels here she said I gave him a good cussing I'm not proud of that I want you to know that I'm not proud of that but let me just say this to you we can look back to where she was but God changed your life and transformed her life and for the last years she was a real dedicated Christian read all the message books she went through it she could quote it right back to you but you see God has to work on us now this isn't a learned behavior [Music] this isn't something that we work our way into it it's an atmosphere that has to come into our home and into our church and at our Pew and at our life we've got to create an atmosphere to welcome him are you with me now that atmosphere has to be there to welcome him I'll wash his feet I'll worship Him I'm going to lay down my pride I'm going to lay down everything around me I want to create an atmosphere at this pew you're not responsible for the next few you're not responsible for another church I'm not responsible for another church I'm not here to straighten anybody out let me just say I'm just going to preach the word and where the shoe fits just put it on it'll be okay it's going to be like Lazarus take off his clothes take off his grave clothes he's going to live for a little while he's not going to stay in a grave atmosphere he's going to live for a while now let me just well my time's from now but let me just say this to you it's hard for me to imagine as I read history in an age of Martyrs to where people would be under that age of the ox to where they would actually be persecuted to death and they would have such a revelation they would have an atmosphere to where they would willingly give their life me and you're not there we're not in that age are you with me now thank God to walk to a home the soldiers walked to a home and begin to collect children and for a mother to say I've got one more hit back here they had to have a revelation that when that child perished they went immediately into heaven there was a long line of of of of of a people the soldiers were taking their life and a man sees the situation going on and now it's becoming his turn and he says I give up I recant I I just can't do it and the soldier says let me take your place you take my life because as I see these people as the sword goes through them Angels pick them up and take them into heaven I've stood here and witnessed it by the hundreds and that Soldier took off his his Soldier outfit and stood there in that man's place and gave his life to Jesus Christ brother on that's just one story they had a they had a group of Believers about a hundred out by an ice field right near a lake they stripped him down into no clothes at all standing there naked and they stood there and sang man and rejoiced while they were perishing and finally one man says I just can't take it I give up and one of the guards said here put these clothes on he pulled his clothes off because of the atmosphere of those believers even while they perished he got under conviction and he said I want to have a Jesus like that in my life listen we're getting ready for rapture who will we influence before the coming of the Lord who will be we be the life to before the coming of the lord we just had a missionary conference we just had an incredible meeting there listen it's not about going to Zimbabwe or going to South America or going listen God's raised up people in all those Nations and we've sent books and helped build build churches throughout the years we as a church have sent I'm not going to say incredible amounts of money to try to help listen that last one's going to come in and then we're going to go home that's what we're going to do but your mission field is right where you're at you don't have to preach a person a sermon live it live it they may never read a book they may never listen to a tape but they may say if I ever met a Christian that's the man that's the woman [Applause] why did we get requests from from everywhere people that are not Christians will you pray for this situation is a dire situation they see something in you they see something in you our young fellow that's in Canada right now after I got burned brother biscoll had told sister Connie I think I told it here the last time I was preaching here that brother biscoll had called when I was dying that I would be the speaker at Mount Baker camp 15 years ago maybe 16 years ago I would be the speaker at Mount Baker Camp next year my mom and dad went all my children went never forget it we were in a huge tent they still operate in that huge tent well anyway sister Katie was sitting on the very back with Andrew and Andrew has confessed to us over and over again he needed more of the Lord and you know it and so while I was preaching Katie got to screaming Tom after your service asked me he said does she do that all the time I said she's never done it before she had never did it before she'd done it now but she'd never done it before but in that atmosphere in that atmosphere her life changed well Andrew was still a sneaker so we go for a couple of days at Victoria kind of for a little time off I want to talk to you now I'm going to come to an end finish this maybe next week the same day you can't make this up brother Tom Ray's son Joel you know he's in the world he's doing things he shouldn't be doing mom and dad's praying they're desperately praying for him they're praying like never before that he gets saved because he's going out in the world and things are going on you know now you know they've got a covenant with God God gave him their boys because they couldn't have children and every time they went before the Lord can we have one more and God gave them even Joe well Joel Joel would you know he had he had that he was a pretty boy he had a long beautiful black curly hair he actually came here one time and he was good looking boy he wasn't quite as tall and but he was dark and handsome I'll never forget it sister Connie I never forget it but I probably can't grow a beard anyway because I'm a part Indian Apache it'll be all right Sister Nancy she don't have her ear things in but I could tell she heard that Whitney Whitney was sitting with me and we were at a place to where the planes would come in and land on the water and we were watching we were watching that because that don't happen at Pilot or it don't happen on on Pine Creek Lane it don't happen they were coming in I was just enamored by that planes coming in land on the water scoot up to the place where the people got out maybe they were delivering the mail maybe they were just businessmen and so I was just enamored by that and something spoke to me go to the door I asked Whitney I said somebody at the door would you hear somebody knock no and so I listened to the voice and I went to the door I opened the door and here come Joel and Joel's just kind of he's got sandals on he's got holes in his jeans his hair is just a floating I said Joe come on in here sit down with me a little bit and he came in and he sat down and I had my feet up on the rail and he leaned back put his feet up on the rail he didn't know it he was about to get a atmosphere change and we begin to talk Small Talk At the beginning and before long God began to read his life and he began to read his life and begin to talk to him about the Lord and then begin to pronounce a blessing on him you got the sign of Joseph on you and you're going to be blessed in everything that you do Whitney set 10 feet away and watched Joe get a complete nature change he walked he got out of that chair a complete different person then he got in the chair today he's got a beautiful family beautiful children he is blessed Beyond being blessed he just keeps climbing the ladder they keep giving him bonuses they just keep pouring it on him why because on a day on a day Jesus met him Jesus met him that evening we went to supper not saying nothing to nobody because I want people to see the real Jesus and so that evening we go to supper believe we had steak we went to supper we walked out on the street we begin to disperse some some with this door some went that store we begin to walk down a very busy a busy street and it was wide sidewalks and we walked down and I looked I looked down the street and there was Andrew with brother Tom I'll let Andrew tell you the rest of it but I just tell you when I saw brother Tom take that white head and begin to bow it and put his hands on his shoulders and Andrew bowed that red hair it didn't matter if they were standing in thousands of people was walking around them it didn't matter what the society thought one Andrew went to that restaurant and walked out on the street and another Andrew Hallelujah another Andrew got changed he became a different son he became a different husband he became a tremendous preacher Give the Lord a great big hand that Andrew preached this week 16 years later at Mount Baker he's preached there before but he preached with David Mayer kind of just end with this so it's all on the same tape I went to Switzerland brother biscoll wanted me to go to Switzerland I didn't go the first year that he that he wanted me to go because I thought it was too busy I really didn't want to go the next year brother biscoll called me and he just placed his burden on my heart he said Your Atmosphere will change lives you'll know how to handle the people they'll fall in love with you brother Ron you'll know how to you'll know how to bring them to Christ we'd preached meetings before he'd saw me operate so I go and so there's different interpreters are taking care of different preachers brother biscoll and myself as speakers and so Brother David is interpreting for me brother David's been here preaching he's probably getting ready to preach right now on Mount Baker and Brother David is in a in a small place a small Church it's not necessarily preaching he's he's just there he's just listening but God's Got Something greater for him and I'm I don't know his history I don't know everything about him come come come yeah come William Ritalin is not working well this morning and so he's repeating what I'm saying except for it's in French and I'm I'm preaching hard in a preaching heart and I'm preaching hard and we're going and we're going and we're going and all of a sudden the Lord says speak to David I didn't know what he was going to say I turned around to David and I said no don't don't interpret this and David is standing there and he goes okay okay and I tell him I said God's calling you to preach and not just preach pastor well some of his family can understand English David why is he going to dinner with David he just called him out of the tree why is he going to dinner with David well David ain't no preacher he can't be no pastor but God don't look at your now God God sees that David's going to be one of the most powerful preachers that ever comes out of Europe now I didn't give him that God just recognized the gift that was inside of him this guy preaches now to more people than he ever preached to before he got here [Music] you know how many households he preached to last night besides here I told him this morning 512 households and he preached patience to all of them and some of you really needed it [Applause] when I first met him I wasn't scared of him I wasn't scared of his ego he's a team member he can add something to our church he can be a blessing to us I saw incredible potential laying on the inside of him I'm just picking him but what about you because if this atmosphere gets on you just right and you fall in love with Jesus [Applause] wish you could feel what I feel Jeremy you know this you came in your T-shirt had never been ironed since it came out of the factory and you fell in love with him and you are in these t-shirts now and what I saw inside of him is what he is now maybe you didn't see it but I saw it and he's transformed this church he's a behind the scenes guy that's transformed this church because he felt like that these messages need to be heard around the world thank you brother brother Jerry I'm done I'm just free now brother Jerry I don't even remember what you guys came to my house for you and sister Stephanie did Whitney we meet you at the house what what'd you come for taking care of my cats sister Judy did you hear that taking care of the cats they're named Ted and Judy maybe it was before Ted and Judy but I think was lucky lucky maybe then 17 years old he'd got snake bits and many times it was Unreal he was a fighter but he couldn't fight the wild dogs that got a hold of him they came and I I saw them I saw them in the yard I saw them out in the driveway it was before we cut down all the trees and I saw him out there and they were out there and Jerry was being a good husband he was just following along and I was in the house and the Lord spoke to me said go out there to where he's at he's getting ready to have a moment and we stood there under an old oak tree I thought about it this morning as I Was preparing to come out of the house there were three people standing there me and you and the Lord and it changed your life it changed it changed your life Timothy you didn't know whether to move her or not you were looking for an answer he walked in the office not knowing if he's going to get it and you sit there about 15 minutes and when the light come on it was on it was over you're here if you're here he'll take care of you that's just how it works he'll take care of you you may think you're walking alone but he'll take care of you and I come out here and preach a sermon on in his arms you remember that in his arms and they had been an incredible accident maybe the year before and I don't have all these events right and he had wrote to Eagle's View somebody asked him to write a a testimony to Eagle's View did you name that or did they name it they named it his testimony in his arms maybe the a couple weeks later he brings me the article I'd never seen the article and here I am preaching in his arms and he's blowed away because now he's made a choice and now God is preaching to him once again you're in my arms you can't make these things up you just can't make it up well brother Ron how are we going to make a Rapture I've spent about an hour telling you it's going to come to your house somewhere between six and nine o'clock you're no doubt going to be having difficulty their situation is going to be going on but God's not worried about the temporary he's changed your life and he's prepared you now you may have walked 40 years with him but you still see things in you but God's going to change you in the moment and the twinkling of an eye and one moment you're going to have gray hair and and need glasses and I don't know where all this stuff is going to go but those things are going to evaporate and the devil that's fighting you now in that moment can fight you no longer [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah I want that kind of an atmosphere where he would feel welcome to come to my house welcome to we went to China [Music] it was a morning foreign [Music] he wanted to take us to his house [Music] we walked in the house and we sat down a small place everything was right in order [Music] I sat down on the sofa there was a lady that a little bit elderly [Music] she was there she had an envelope husband that she takes care of all the time and she had somebody else to take care of him that afternoon she was there in the home a real believer I sat down on the sofa as I was sitting there she comes to end and she's overwhelmed in her emotions overwhelmed and she gets down on her knees right in front of me and puts your hands on my knees and she's bellowing crying I asked brother Murphy what is she saying she said for this I have prayed that brother Ron would come and now he's in our home and he's sitting on our couch [Music] we wanted this atmosphere in our home what a greater than brother Ron showed up that day I don't know whether you felt it or not but greater than brother Ron's been in the room he wants to cut wood with you Jason he wants to be with you as a taxidermist he wants to watch over your lives he wants to be with you as a school teacher he wants to be with your children as you go to school and there's just something about him that's different they don't have to put it on it's just different I choose to believe that that's our Lord Jesus Christ could you just welcome him right where you're standing and say father and the Very Simplicity of this sermon today come near me come live in my life like never before Heavenly Father [Music] maybe it's an attitude or situation of a life but Lord all of us
