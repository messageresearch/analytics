so [Music] [Music] good to be here tonight isn't it amen i would have helped you sing that song but i don't know i know hey man i know he knows my name hey man i'm i'm nervous as i'll get out i don't have big brother back here to even back me up but i got brother william he was checking in to make sure everything's all right and uh what an honor to be here tonight hey man it's good to see your smiling faces and always looking for a good time and and uh i know we're coming up in church and being right here you can't hear me i got verizon i do amen it'll get going in a little bit my wife always gets me because i get louder and louder by the moment amen i also consider the sources amen but we'll praise god anyway amen and and uh so went out to eat with sister connie and uh sister frazier and uh the whole crew uh my my new in-laws in-laws coming up in two weeks amen and uh i'm looking forward to that day amen but right now we'll just be nervous for the next two weeks amen i know they're probably listening gabriel's spending his last 10 days of freedom with other men and man when he gets home he'll be glad to not hear snoring and all that good stuff so uh he'll be glad to be back and have a a great wife a man of princess right now but she'll be a queen to him and and uh so we we're looking forward to that amen and uh so that was free amen and i'll hear about that later but uh but we look at these things and you know you can be seated i'm sorry i'm keeping you all standing i just i'm just happy to be here i got so many things on my mind and and uh i just want to get to feeling at peace before i i take it on but uh i look at what's going on in y'all's church there's no reason why this church should not be packed out tonight every service there's a service here there should be a group of people that comes in that's hungry amen because you all are experienced the end time message of the hour amen the spoken word is coming fulfilled before your eyes and you take it for granted but i'm looking at it from the outside and you know that i'm going to be taking it from hebrews 12 tonight and we look at it we see the moving of the spirit of god right here in full gospel white house we see it moving from the outside i can only imagine what you all are feeling on the inside amen to see people getting healed filled and delivered by the power of god amen it ain't a man standing there that's laying hands on it's god himself coming down in this hour and this time to anoint you with his presence and i looked at that and i said you know that church should be full i know you got more seats and you kind of spread everybody out you know i kind of looked at i said well you know i said if that was me i don't know whether i'd like them but then he said they set softer so they'll give you room tonight just kind of spread out this thing gets around two hours you can lay down if you'd like hey man yeah man [Laughter] brother bill's already hitting the floor over here amen but you know you look at it you see you see if you get in the right atmosphere whether they if you get in the right atmosphere it wouldn't matter if it was a sermon that was four hours long we talked about back here in the back you're so close to god that time becomes that finite you're looking at the infinity of god and seeing god move down and it seems like it's a 15-minute sermon and i said you can only imagine what it would take when we get in the presence of god a million years will be just like that right there i'm looking to get in his presence more now than ever amen don't leave yourself behind get into the services when you have a chance climb in there and have fun now i will tell you this i was i said you know i said you know when we we come in when i come in behind this pulpit what an honor it is to just to be able to step behind this pulpit where the message of the hours being preached you know and i look at it and i see i see the things that's going on here and then i go you know it's sort of like me following him behind two lincoln continentals you know they're they're fixed up and all that here i come in my little kia i mean you know i'm like my goodness but you know what somebody told me today she said you can take the curves faster in that kia i said well there you go my sister india hey i love taking them fast amen so that's what we're going to do we're going to lay out the word of god and take it to it amen and as i say it every time i get here and i get to think about brother frazier i think about what he brought to the service and i think about the power of one word from him or just seeing him shout and praise god it made me feel good i was just a young man but i watched him and he he just continued to get into it over and over and over again he loved being in the presence of god amen that's the same god we serve tonight amen he's the same today as he was yesterday amen he's going to be the same god tomorrow but today we're worshiping him amen we've come to worship him brother we've come to praise his name and look unto god amen that god would come and anoint the service amen the songs were great amen i told them i said i know how you feel when you get out there in front of people all of a sudden your mouth gets dry you know they offered me something to drink back there it was water i just want to tell y'all amen amen there's three kinds of believers in the church and there's one kind of believer just looks for everything it's wrong they do there's another one that says i'm gonna put on but there's a true bride of jesus christ amen it's looking for the nuggets of the word of god to strengthen your life and to let them let them become more like jesus christ amen i want to get on that spiritual wine tonight amen i want to be like them in the upper room hey man they come out of that upper room they was praising god they man they were speaking in tongues they were praising god hey man i thank god they give us an example to live by hey man i see y'all down here shouting i see you down here i'm like glory to god i'm sitting there in my room and i'm watching it i'm seeing all this going on i'm thinking about it i'm looking at you all having such a good time the tears are just streaming down my face to say god is still real god's still alive but i've still got a people out there that's wanting and hungry for the word of god why shouldn't we be hungry amen you're seeing it happen right now and then no matter what trials of life comes along you are in his perfect will in his perfect will that's where i want to be at tonight is in the perfect will of jesus christ amen amen so if i'm driving to kia tonight we'll get more mileage amen it won't be 15 miles to get me 40 miles to the gallon amen i know because i drive one my wife got me one so i could carry my motorcycle back she said you're too old for a motorcycle so i eat and okay put on my helmet y'all put on your helmets

blessed him to be able to stand here before you and preach messages that he don't have strength to do but god gives him that unction inside of you brother brahm says you set a man on fire amen he can't sit still hey when i see him up here dancing around and taking off the head of goliath amen amen i go glory to god i said he could do more in that condition why ain't i doing something more amen

up lord lord take and move us up to a higher ground tonight lord and let us stand in your presence one more time we ask us for your glory that you get all the glory in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen and amen amen hebrews 12 1. we're for seeing we're all compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the sin that so easily beset us and let us run this patient run run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and the finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest he you be worried and faint in your own minds you have not yet resisted unto the blood striving against sin and ye have and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth verse 7 if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not may the lord add his blessings to his word deceiving you may be seated amen we we see thee we see when we read these scriptures and we see wherefore we're being compassed about with such a greater cloud of witnesses these are these are people that's going on this is the bride of jesus christ that have went on to meet the reward you've seen them thus you've seen them walk with you and talk with you and now they have stepped into their beyond they're stepped on into their eternal home but they are such a cloud of witnesses that's around us amen and we look at this and we see that but the one i want to take picture to the night i want you to look at the lord jesus christ tonight amen he endured so much and he did what he needed to do he did what he was called to do amen he found himself in the scriptures he knew what he was come to the earth to do and it was to save people like you and me amen because we were all full of sin we were all full of doubt and fear and envy and strife and you know the world is going through it today they're looking for an answer they're looking for something they're they're looking for something there's even people that's on the internet right now that are looking to try to find peace just by looking if i can see the services i can see god still moving but they will not relieve themselves to come to god they will not you've got to tear down this being right here you've got to tear it down amen i heard it said the other day the only person likes to change is a baby you change it it starts crying you change it you either feed it or you you you change it diaper i'm sorry i'm just being honest but you look at it that's exactly the way the world is tonight they are full of sin but they won't cry out to god they won't look for the answer and jesus christ is the answer and he died for us he arose for us he went to hell for us amen he went down he endured that he knew what was coming up he knew it when he talked to him right there on moses when elijah was talking to him they explained to him the things he was getting ready to happen they were giving him encouragement you're getting ready to go some of the tests of your life they're giving him the encouragement you've got to stand tall that's exactly what's going on tonight there's those who are standing up they're praying for you brother brother tim pruitt talking about it he said they're praying for you that you will not give it up in the end that you will not sell yourself out for something of the world is going on the world is getting so full that it just it looks at sin it's not even sin anymore it becomes this is normal you know i'm here to tell you sin is sin and when you look at it in the bible right here if it's wrong in the bible he did not change his mind about his word amen i told a couple today and they was walking in up here and probably the guy kind of looked at me kind of funny but i said it is good to see ladies in a dress it's good to see ladies in the dress and they kind of looked at him and i said well it's better to be in that than be naked or to be you know and he kind of looked at me i was like well he's gonna punch me but you know they might as well be naked the way they're walking around in this world they become so immune to sin they can walk around naked and not know it amen that's the layout of sin age that we're living in we're living in an age that sin is so predominant that it becomes wrong to be right it becomes wrong to be right i'm hoping this is okay to preach but i'm telling you sometimes we get caught up in it but when you say something you're going to endure some chastisement you're going to endure some words that you're not ready for and you better be ready to stand upon the word of god amen to have an anchor that holds amen the gates of hell shall not prevail against that rock that rock being jesus christ i looked at that and i said you know the chastening that's going on we're lightly doing it right here we're lightly doing it in america we sit here and we go well you know i got to go to church it's saturday night again it's sunday morning does he know no we had church last night no but there's people that i i we're we're dedicated to giving money and to get it over into the mission fields and i know you all are too and you you send your pastor they're going to see people that are hungry there are words searching for every word of god they're searching for more hymn and they're looking at it and they can be you know like like italy and all these and brother king george's he's got he's there in ireland he got got all those people that are there that are catholics but he is a shining star there amongst them and man we're four years to come past come passed about with such a great a cloud of witnesses amen those those witnesses and that light is shining down upon them he's looking and he is shining forth his family they meant to be a lighthouse for jesus christ and this end time message i thank god for the end time message how many of you thank god for the end time message amen i give him glory amen we have not had the we had not had the end time message of the hour i look at it i see people walking away from the message of what's going on in this day and how it's explained how abraham become young again we're going to get into him in just an hour or two but i look at it we see how the he became i like that amen y'all listening amen [Music] you look at it you know if it had not been if it had not been for the prophet of god coming in our time in our hour and delivering a message that came from god it didn't come from some man's creed some man's dogma he even goes back and explains it he said i was wrong when i read that book i was wrong how they interpreted but i looked at it and god gave me the interpretation of it the revelation of the hour comes only from jesus christ amen you can either be led by the light or blinded by the light amen and i look at that and i see god moving by his spirit down upon him and he moved through the word of god through brother branham and he delivered a message that we can understand yep abraham was turned young again sarah was turned young again we see that through the message of the hour if you read it you would not know that if you read it you just said well you know people say well they got the bible so mixed up in its time and that some chapters came after this chapter and all that they're looking for a simple man-made reason but they can't see god changing a person amen what was that jesus said greater than this shall ye do ye do i'm a part of that ye in there amen write your name inside there i'm a part of that ye amen greater than this yeah ye do amen that when he when he's coming back i'm gonna see a body change i'm going to see a body change amen my neighbor may look over and say you know what charity she must have got her a young man you didn't see that coming did you i'll come walking down through there and they won't see it but i'll have mom have my grandma they'll be all there just walking along with me hey man i'll be going this is what we did and remember one day we're going to go we're going to go home what is it we greater than this shall you do amen greater than this shall you do i promised myself i wasn't gonna get all excited but i can tell you what when you're talking about the word of god something's gonna stir up on the inside and then something's going to move amen that god when god is here for a purpose and that's looking for more of him amen when you lose your hunger for jesus christ amen you've lost everything amen i send it on a church sign said if the only thing you have is jesus christ you have everything he said he'd supply your need he said he would meet with you he said he'd be there ever whatever comes up he already knows what's going to happen as i talked to his sister today talking to her she said you know he knew when i was going to come on this earth and he knew when i was going to go off of this earth i said you want to know what he knowed everybody if he did not know when i came on this earth and when i'm going off he ain't god he wasn't god god knows the end from the beginning and he's seen you he knows your name thank y'all for singing that song he knowed your name he knew that when mark spence was going to be here he knew when randy hickey was going to be here he knew each one of our names and it's like i may have a new name in glory but right now i'm glad he knows me as mark david spencer amen i'm glad he knows your name tonight amen that you can look at it and say thank you lord that you know me yeah now you know me i thank god for that wherefore we're so compassed about with such a greater cloud of witnesses i looked at and i see jesus christ what did he do for you i mean he he did everything for you he did everything and i want to take a look in the scriptures this evening hey man i'm not like ronaldine i can't take a pause it's like if i take a pause i forget what i was thinking about a while ago but he is perfect at that ain't he i know he's out there going my lord but he can take a pause and it's like i'm waiting on the next word give me the next word amen that's what we should be doing is anticipating the very next word from jesus christ that word comes down it's alive and it's well it gives you that strength that says i need that right now i need that because many times we feel like we're all alone amen we feel like we're all alone the devil wants to depress a christian he's got every eye on you and he's going i want you to go get her i want you to go get him i want you today i want you to make him so bad i want you to make him say something i don't know if y'all ever did that amen but you look at you think things say man you think things say you know i'm sorry you know as i said the other night i said just because you think things don't mean you've just been completely black see you backslid blacksmith but you look at you see you all you got to do is ask god to forgive you that's the kind of god he said i know he would repent he knew job wouldn't do what he he knew job he knew what he was doing have you considered my servant job i look at you have a modern day job right here he don't he don't like to be called out he said i don't want to go through what job did but he raul dean i can tell you what you go to his home you go and he's feeling down and out i'll give you some insight that guy never has a bad day if you're there he has days that's that's just horrible y'all talk to him on the phone he said buddy he said i'd love to talk to you longer but he said i just can't do it but you know when he's up here you wouldn't know anything's wrong with him at all amen because there's something on the inside says this little bit of pain that i'm suffering here is nothing when it's compared to the eternity of living with jesus christ compared to eternity i ain't letting nothing turn me around i want to continue to press forward pressing forward doesn't mean well he's bigger than i am amen it's like david continue to wing it around amen i may miss one time but i'm going to get you the next time amen but if god's on earth god's going to provide his way amen god's going to move because you're surrounded by such a cloud of witnesses that jesus christ himself he died you say well i've already i've already heard that well you're going to hear it many more times because i'm going to tell you something when you get over what jesus christ done for you amen in those words right there he endured that chastisement he endured that from the center he endured those people he was looking at them they were his friends and neighbors that was standing up he fed them i mean i look at sometimes i'm sorry some people come to my house and they eat you never heard hear the word thank you what may have been bad food but i didn't know hey but you look at it you say but when i look i want to thank god for everything i thank sister connie them for taking care of us this evening i wanted to get it i want to get the food and i told the guy to give it to me but he was the fourth grade teacher so he didn't recognize me he recognized connie but then i said well i'm going to get it because he brought it back to me and i said i'll take it i said i can get this sister fraser looked over at me she said you're going to have a bad spirit at church tonight i'm telling you connie's going to be so mad oh she's going to be bad i said well you know what i ain't really worried about sister connie because i said that's what i'm here to do to cast out devils but you look at it you see that's what we're here to do let's take the sword of the spirit and chop off those devils hey man but sometimes you do you get a bad spirit about you hey man you get things happening inside but i want to tell you she did she she got over and took care of it right straight up at the at the thing i was like i met her she goes it ain't gonna count now i've already took care of it you know that's exactly what jesus christ did for us let's get serious for a moment here that's exactly what jesus christ did for us we were looking for an answer we we're looking what can i do to pay this bill what can i do to overcome what's going on inside of me i've got perils that's laying inside of me that need to be taken out i need this strife that i'm having this envy that's happened inside of my life amen the devil wants to wrap you up so much and get you so locked in amen so bound up in sin that you say there's no way out but you can look at it when you get to that place you find that cross amen it says it's already been paid it's already been paid you don't have nothing to do but just surrender your life over to him that's exactly what you need to do tonight if you don't know jesus christ you find yourself at an altar amen and look for jesus christ to meet you there where he's been he will come where he's been he will come and you won't have to pay nothing the bill has already been paid and the bill has already been paid i don't need to pay penance and i don't need to give you money it has already been paid amen the holy ghost that came back on the day of pentecost it covered them amen but it's the same holy ghost today that's covering you amen that god removed by his spirit down upon you amen brother branham talks about that all the time you need to surrender yourself over to him and let god do the work in you amen i thank god for that tonight everybody give him a hand tonight i get tore up just thinking about the goodness of god it's a serious time in our lives say man we're coming down to the nuts and bolts of what the bride of jesus christ is we're coming down to the time when there's going to come a time when you don't have a lot of friends sitting around hey man jesus went to that cross he went to that cross and he looked down and he seen all those people that he fed and he took care of healed their sick and raised them from the dead what were they doing at the end they were spitting at him and they were doing all this stuff and even his inside disciples that was there with him walked away they wouldn't even want to be seen with him amen and that's the same thing it's coming to this day it's almost a sin to be a christian anymore amen the ability to go beyond your own thinking if y'all wonder what this is tonight that's the name of this sermon amen they can put it up on youtube now amen that was just the opening just checking here man i think i know why he takes a break because y'all take it in and he's just like oh this is so good amen to know what jesus christ done for me amen and what he give me without a cause he seen me before i knew him he knew me he knew me and he seen me and what i needed and man if it's one or many sins he knew what i needed he knew that he would be with me these these soldiers are sitting over here i watched them on the thing and they're there they are dancing what is it they got something way back then that's still real now hey man we still stand here tonight because it's so real i'm gonna come back and get some more what is that going on it's something that you got amen acts 2 38. amen no amen amen back up we look at this teach me lord to do thy will this is psalms 143 this is before the holy ghost is even given davis psalms 143 and 10 teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprighteousness many people don't want to give up themselves if david back in that day he knew what god was he knew that god was with him when he was in the battles he knew that god would walk with him down through the trials of this life amen in the uprighteousness amen and that's where we are tonight if you're not get on an altar amen but the uprighteousness of living in this day people know there's a difference when you walk into walmart and man they know there's a difference when you walk into the grocery store they know there's something different about you because why you are god's called there's a light that shines amongst you hey man i heard brother brother ron talking about he said and what a great meeting they had down there amen and just letting god move and then y'all had a great meeting up here i was like lord the mercy of one sunday we just had church all day long i was like wow i said this is all right you know you look at you see god moving what is it one day we're going to be in that eternally one day we're going to be there but right now he gives us just a taste of it mean this mortal body couldn't handle that kind of pressure all the time i mean he couldn't handle it because it would just explode amen but i'm looking at it this is what we want to do is get closer to god amen let god move by his spirit down upon us and he says leading me into the uprighteousness amen and that's where we're going we're going forward we're pressing forward to the mark of the high calling acts 2 38 repent and be baptized amen repent and be baptized amen not just in any name but in the name of the lord jesus christ what for the remission of your sin that means they're taking them all the way back you know you hear about it well they are in remission of cancer never in remission of tuberculosis or remission of this what's the remission of sins it's more important than a sickness temporal here if you can get somebody saved sanctified holy ghost filled and baptized amen they have an eternal home awaiting amen you say well the devil made me do it glad you asked amen the devil makes me do these things well i can tell you what you went to the line you went to the line he didn't come across the line because i'm here to tell you the bloodline of jesus christ is what separates a sinner from a saint amen and you look at you see if he was to come across that bloodline he'd have to be saved sanctified holy ghost filled and baptized then he'd be your brother amen i can say that because brother branham said dad brother brown said that he said that's the only way that the devil can come across that bloodline is to come the same way a sinner did amen i thank god that there's a bloodline tonight i thank god that blood will never ever ever lose its power that's god himself living in there amen covering those multitude of sin hey man i looked at it i had to i went out on the porches there i went there and i put down this this this paint they said it will last forever spiritually speaking there's a lot of churches out there this will last forever this will last forever you just send in your tithe and your offering help us with their bake sales everybody has their ideas about those but then we'll get you to heaven i put down that paint oh it's nice non-skid good i walked around on it we did it for oh it was it's been on there three or four or five years they said 25 years and it wouldn't be a problem i said all right but i got sold something that wasn't right because the other day i put it under pressure put it under pressure i don't know if y'all have birds up here we got birds down there and they like that porch there's a power line sits right across the top of it so i took my i took my time down there i said well i cleaned the church so i said well i'm going to clean off all that gunk off of there i'd say gunk okay so i started spraying it off i said that thing's gonna last and all of a sudden brother randy about half a sheet of that stuff that wasn't nothing but neck and board laying there i'm like i knocked that stain all the way back down to where that thing was growing as a tree you know that's exactly what happens to a lot of people's religion that they have they have enough to get them to church but when the pressures of life comes down up on them it starts flaking off that outside exterior hey man i looked at it i said that's god called right there i said you know that that paint may have been guaranteed to last a lifetime but there's only one thing that's still guaranteed to last eternally that's the blood of jesus christ amen and the holy ghost it feels on the inside it will be there as long as you obey it amen as long as you're listening to it it will be there amen i can look back and see the day i lay my sins down i can see the day i was cleansed i see the river i went down there and got baptized in and then i went a second time amen but i said well you know i said it was good the first time it's going to be even better the second time you know because sometimes sometimes the first time you go back and you look at you say well i've done this or i've said this and you know i want to get a complete cleansing you know right here's the right here it is and then i looked at it and i seen my boy my girl come up here i seen gabriel lord he was my i was going to say hellion but i'm not going to okay too many people watching but i've seen once you are in the presence of god once that you ever enter in you go beyond that veil of looking out you're in brother brahem talks about he says you got to come out go in and go up once you get in behind that veil and i've seen a man change i seen him changing his spirit and he's talking in the way that he wasn't he wasn't a dirty talker he was he's always been a cheerful fellow and he was always the life of the party and all that and that maybe got him in trouble but you know the devil used that to make him more important to the outside world he will use whatever he can to keep you away from the glory of god and i've seen god change him in such a way and not not over time it was an instant change when he came up out of that water there was a change inside of his body inside of his soul that made him different when he walked from that day forth even when he was in his house he's got brother branham going on he's got all these he's spiritually minded all the time and moving forward and malachi caught hold of that wave and each one of us there was a lot that got baptized got a hold of that wave and they said i want to get in there i want to get in when the water's troubled don't just stand there look get into that water amen get into that water that god would move by his spirit and change you from this mortal to immortality because right at that time your body may not know it but you're going to be changed in a moment a twinkling of an eye into a younger being brother meadows back here all of a sudden he'll be going shh you're talking too loud because i can hear i can hear now amen i can see i can do this i ain't only look over and see his wife and man each one of you be seeing those loved ones around you hey man i know you want to save him a seat amen but god will make a way where there's room for them to come in i mean i'm looking forward to that day i told him if i told him at work i said i'm going to tell you what when it happens i said i'm going ahead and telling you i ain't coming back to work no more amen somebody's going well i know i got to still pay a deal i'm going to tell you what if you caught up you need the treasures of this world and you worried more about them and going to heaven you got to get the you better get on the altar somewhere right now there ain't nothing to go back home for hey man there ain't nothing to go back home for if god come i want to be ready amen amen they talked to that one man he said i married a wife and i gotta go tender you know and you know it's like he probably only had one one had a good excuse and then everybody else had something to do i don't want to have nothing to do lord if you come i want to be ready i want to be ready in that moment i don't want nothing standing in front of me that will hold me back i want to continue to move forward amen create in me a new heart amen and spirit inside of me lord let your life live inside of me always amen i want to be moral like him every day and man people have got their idols that they're looking out inside this world you should have jesus christ in front of you at all times don't ever lose your touch with jesus christ amen if you find yourself wondered come to church more i can tell you what coming here i can tell you i just just seeing you all in the spirit of god and i think about war four you're so compassed about with such a great a cloud of witnesses i see the world as looking at you all hey man i don't want to make you shy about praising god i want you to say i want to do more for my lord jesus christ amen because what it does it takes someone to get a smart started amen if they could be healed wesley could be healed glory to god i i tell you what i was hoping i said if i see him running i'm gonna be behind him hey man i think a lot of you all said when i see him running when i see him the other day hope is okay when i see him run and i was like glory to god i said now he's running okay but i'm gonna tell you what that was one step that was one black eye one black guy every time ronnie gets up here that's another black eye and then every time you sit down in that pew and praise god that's another black eye i want to continue to give that devil a black eye from a time he gets up in the morning till the time he goes to bed i want to continue to block him up and then you continue to work that whip take that sword of the word of god and cut him down every time that he comes up and you just sit there and you whack him and you whack him thank you lord jesus you're there with me all the time amen i may be going through the one the roughest day just start praising god just start praising god and lifting up his name because that's the kind of god i serve tonight and then he would be with you even in you until the end of the world glory to god the man [Music] god is good but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what you shall speak you just let god do it many times we want to take it upon ourselves i'm going to fight this battle they want to come at me about being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm going to show them a thing or two no let god lead you let god let you take and let that word come out of you it becomes more than just a man it becomes god in there amen moving by his spirit that's jesus christ speaking through you amen because what have you done you've gotten so close to god until his thoughts have become your thoughts and you're thinking like he would think and you're becoming the word of god and then more you're becoming the word amen your ability is no longer your ability that's jesus christ living on the inside of you that's taking it moving you by his spirit up into a higher realm you no longer looking at it saying well should i be baptized in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost or should i be baptized in jesus name or baptize under paul amen but he's looking and saying have you received the holy ghost since you believed have you received the holy ghost that you believe and being baptized in jesus christ's name you're looking at saying that is the name that i'm going to marry i'm going to be miss jesus christ amen i'm going to be miss jesus christ and i had the world you know i'm looking at you you're you're you got zuku people coming okay who's gonna be nervous upper the bride don't take this wrong the world right now if they were coming to her wedding they would not be worried about the 19 people standing on this side or the 19th standing on this side and the preacher they wouldn't be worried about that they're waiting on the bride and they're going to be you'll notice i'm not worried about those people on the internet they ain't here but they're gonna be looking the bride of christ over from head to toe as soon as they find something that is out of alignment with the word that they know they're gonna call you out on it i say bring it on because the word that's on the inside of me when i'm brought up against that i am letting jesus christ take over and man they may look at me and say well you shouldn't do this or shouldn't do that well i'm going to do better could go well i'll black your eye there's a lot of people that say we get in a fight over that job's witnesses they're dedicated to what they do i don't know if y'all ever have them come to your house they don't come to mind anymore i love them amen and probably tomorrow they'll probably show up but you know you know i say you give me your time and i'm giving you my time but i said i want time back they don't come back now because when they can prove to me that they're jehovah of the old mine is jesus christ of the new there shall be no other name above that name hey man i ain't putting i just tell you just like it is jesus christ is my lord and savior amen he's the god that was incarnated he'd come to this earth amen we're for we're so compassed about amen that was jesus christ he not only came down for you he walks around you and he's in you we're so far we're so compassed about we have jesus christ living on the inside of us moving us from day to day i thank god for that tonight amen i look it down i say teach me lord to do thy will amen more now than ever am i don't don't let me be my own own maker let me be the will of jesus christ that god you can move through me amen because there was a time i would not ever get up here and preach amen but there was something that came in that took me out of the way took me from where i was to where i am because many times we say each one of us has a part to play there's big churches or small churches so when you think you're small i always put it back when you're trying to start a fire you don't get the biggest stick you got in the pile and stick it in the stove you get some of the most insignificant sticks that are laying there they're they're ready they've been dried out they're ready you put them in there and you start a little fire underneath them hey man and then all of a sudden it starts building up more and more it's then you can bring the big sticks in hey man but don't be thinking you're just i'm a small one at church i'm the quiet one oh i hold up the corner amen and i hold up the corner right but no it's praise you lord thank you lord i've come to praise god i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord i don't know what you came to do i came to praise the lord hey man that's the way it should be when you walk through those doors back there let me enter with thanksgiving on my heart and then for another opportunity to step in the presence of god it ain't the building it's the place where people come to worship he said where two or three gathered in my name that jesus christ himself would be there in the midst i'm believing he's here tonight you know you say well that's just a simple sermon to believe on jesus christ if that's what you need to believe on him then that's what you need because one day he will take you to higher realms he will take you to a place where you've never been that you're going back to your regular home hey man our home is in heaven amen with jesus christ because i was in his thoughts before the foundation of the earth i was there he knew me he knew me he predestinated me he seen me sitting here he seen me doing the will of christ he said that's my son that's my daughter hey man i know why you don't have grandson and grandchildren i know why you don't you say well that's bad well i'll tell you i got two i'm just learning sarah's got me 14 coming hey man when we look at this we see well i see there's nothing there is nothing that i wouldn't try to do for my grandkids or correct them you know a true father and a true mother i look back and i go man oh i hope i don't turn out like my dad oh he goes to church all the time oh lord i got to do something i got to do something but you know when christ come in i'm like i want to be more like him i want to i want to praise god more i want to be walking in his presence all the time and i start going i want to be like jesus christ amen it ever comes of mankind it becomes jesus kind amen and we look at that we see god moving by his spirit but he's bringing you to a higher height he's bringing you up to a higher height that we can live where he lives we can walk where he walks amen that he will be there with us wherefore we're compassed about but when that chastisement this life comes down upon you it ain't the end of the world i see the chastisement going up on my brother i see the things that's going on and things are being said and things are going on in his life and i look at how i say god has been there with him i would never dare not say anything about him amen but i let god do the work inside of him and he is speaking he is his most soft spoken person i mean he just lays it right out there and just delivers you all messages i mean it's like steak every night for you all and i'm like glory to god you know and you look at it you say well i gave you a bologna sandwich tonight and you look at it you see you see that i am blessed i'm blessed to be able to sit here and partake of this end time word of god amen and i wonder you know sometimes i have to go brother brown i heard him say it so i'm going to say it he said if there's one going in jeffersonville it's me verse one going in charlottesville it's me it's gonna be brother madison i think if i was here if i'm here tonight it would be me i'm sorry you have to have that will of god to not let anybody anything anything this world could do you don't let nothing hold you back from getting closer to jesus christ because you need to make it up within your mind you're going beyond your own ability man would turn around woman would turn around but your ability that's been put inside of you goes beyond what you are it goes beyond your own thinking who would have thought a man with stage four cancer and his brain would be standing up here and delivering and remembering words and remembering oh some of the characters that he brings out and then he also takes the word of god and he opens up naaman don't enjoy that i'll tell you what i honestly cannot i i just looking it's just like he stepped back in time and watched him as he walked through life okay i said you know the unveiling of god my wife bought me a dog pen she said this is free birthday you're gonna have a dog and i'm like i don't want a dog i got four now sorry gabriel i don't want them to i don't want them all i just i'm not a dog person so today i got out there and decided i'd build it well i sit down on there's a point to this i got down there and i cut the box open big old box opened it there's a piece so i packed all the pieces that was there and i said that's one of the funniest looking dog pens i've ever seen didn't have no instruction i found the screws i'm like this thing had to be made in china so i'm like well if i match up the pieces and i make this thing work and i sent i sent chris the text well i actually tried to call her but what in the world have you done wasting my money on this dog pen and it'll look like a dog pen and i'm a mechanic i can figure things out i sit there and look at it i look at it longer just look like a big mess of wood wire and screws so then i found the instructions alrighty she goes it's not a dog pen it's a chicken pen all my chickens get eaten by the local dogs so she got me a chicken bin that's the reason it makes sense i said that to say this we sat here many times and we read this word of god we read it we read it and we read it and it's just words but when the prophet of god when your pastor gets up here each one of them start delivering it out there all of a sudden these instructions that we're reading becomes life becomes the living word of god now you're taking it in not just reading it to whom that understandeth understandeth and that means that now no longer are you in a doghouse you've got a chicken coop and it's the same thing here no longer am i baptist methodist presbyterian i am the bride of jesus christ amen you can't even put it down i'll read and bring it down even further you can't even say well i go to the full gospel lighthouse that's where i go to church at no when it becomes a revelation into your heart the word becomes alive and living inside of your life that no longer is a dead letter but it's the living word of god that has came into your life and now it's being reflected it's been reflected back out and i looked at it the other night they have all these planets and things that's going on the moon and they say the star of bethlehem is coming and all this and you look at all this but without the sunlight there there'd be nothing but a dead rock you'd never know they're out there so when you think that you're all on your own take a look up at those stars and you see the light shining on me you can't see the light but you know it's up there and it begins to lighten up those stars you say that's exactly what i'm doing i'm reflecting jesus christ the holy ghost that lives within me puts a glow about me that others can see jesus christ that's what i want to be tonight i want to be closer to christ let us stand our most precious and divine heavenly father dear lord jesus lord i thank you lord for this time that we've had lord to refresh our minds lord jesus lord and we think about the goodness of your love and the hidden things that's been revealed to us in this day and this hour lord it was not it was hidden all the way down through time but there was a predestinated time that your word would become enlightened to word that we are the mark 16 church lord we are a part of that church this evening lord i put my name there i put each one of these people's names right there lord that we are part of that church lord lord by the laying on of hands lord lord they can receive healing and filling and delivering lord of this world lord i pray lord tonight lord may you just divinely touch each one lord from the front to the back lord let the power of god just so surge down through here lord to be a vacuum and out of demons lord out of here and there will be an instilling of the holy ghost inside of our lives lord lord we don't have room to look back lord lord it says remembering lot's wild lord they they did it sticks out those those very few words remember lot's wife laura and she was called out she was going out but she took a turn back to look and see what was going on lord may our hearts and our minds and our eyes be ever set upon you lord move down with your spirit upon our lives that we won't have nothing backward in us lord but we'll be pressing forward to the mark of the high calling lord pressing through the devils of this world lord overlooking the the politics and the things that's going on and lord just looking into you for i see a world right now that's full of earthquakes and full of volcanoes and the the world is just falling apart all around the earth mother earth is looking for a change she's looking for her change we're looking for our chain of this body lord lord i pray the lord you move down by your spirit upon us lord lord let the holy ghost continue to reign inside of our lives lord and may we never do or say anything of being like you lord but lord may our minds and hearts ever be upon you lord god in our bark lord lord may we be that ephesians 6 church lord lord i pray lord may you moved our mind upon our spirits lord lord that we can quit those fiery darts of the devil when they come at us lord and lord may we be ready to serve you more now than ever lord not ever looking back but lord coming to hear more from you lord move down with your spirit upon our lives we ask us for your glory oh and giving you glory hallelujah to the name of god lord we praise your name and we thank you lord jesus lord for your blessings upon our lives and thank you lord for helping me through this lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen amen well i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord i don't know what you came to do but i came to praise the lord well i don't know what you came to do but i can't praise the lord i'm gonna [Applause] praise him in the [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well i don't know why don't you pray in the morning [Music] [Music] hallelujah praise the lord let's give him a hand clapping praise bless the lord jesus hallelujah did you enjoy the word tonight amen thank you brother mark thank you so much for yielding to the holy spirit i love brother mark's title beyond your own thinking do you know we have to get beyond our own thinking to even get to the lord jesus christ we've got to get beyond our own thinking that we've sinned away our day of grace or that we've gone too far or we're not good enough that's your own thinking or i've i've done make such a mistake i can get back up that is your own thinking we've got to get beyond our own thinking because brother as brother mark preached we are surrounded by a cloud of many witnesses the same life that was in them cloud of many witnesses that's pulling for us is in us the same life that's going to raise them up is going to quicken us they're dependent on us to finish this race because they without us are not made perfect and with and god without us is not perfect praise the lord jesus christ i love when he was reading his text for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross you say what's the joy right here he's seen you coming through seven church ages the bride of jesus christ and when he could look through the blood and see that i've got to do this for them he had to go beyond his own human thinking to get you you're the joy that was set before him isn't that wonderful amen saints i pray that you were paying attention to what the spirit was saying from service to service as i always like to say because the holy spirit is setting up right in line with what he has given me to say to speak tomorrow so be in prayer amen do you appreciate the word amen wonderful let's give the lord one one more hand clap of praise amen amen he abides amen aren't you thankful that the lord jesus christ abides amen let's sing that tonight to as we worship him i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk the pilgrim way for the hand [Music] the reason of my bliss yes the secret all is [Music] i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk the narrow way before the comforter [Music] once my heart was full of sin once i had no peace within till i heard how jesus [Music] so sweet [Music] with me [Music] of [Music] [Applause] [Music] since the comforter [Music] is [Music] as i walk the narrow way [Music] there's no thirsting for the things of
