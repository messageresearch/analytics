[52:30] tremendous and then just at the end of
[52:33] the service hopefully you can go back
[52:34] and you can look watch that it's
[52:37] it's miraculous what the Lord does and
[52:40] I've never seen it before but how he
[52:42] called all them young people up on the
[52:44] platform and they was just huddled
[52:45] around him like that and I tell you it
[52:49] was just special it was special that's
[52:52] that's all I can say about that it was
[52:54] just tremendous just to see that and
[52:56] what the Lord's doing there
[52:58] we want to continue to pray for brother
[53:00] Andrew that God would just use him this
[53:02] evening as he's probably speaking right
[53:04] now so I want to pray for them and then
[53:06] they'll have a prayer line here shortly
[53:08] so we want to pray for the strength in
[53:10] his body and all the other ministers
[53:12] there and give those youth what they
[53:15] need sustain they're the generation that
[53:18] we're we're going to look forward to
[53:19] that we can say hey this is what our
[53:22] pillars are right here amen so this
[53:25] evening we we thank the Lord for being
[53:27] here
[53:28] and God bless you musicians amen
[53:33] this evening I'd like to take a thought
[53:35] on why I have a friend like that
[53:39] well I have a friend like that in
[53:41] today's age you
[53:42] often desire to divide and disconnect it
[53:46] but true true the power of friendship is
[53:49] something that can bring light Joy
[53:53] kindness
[53:54] so we need friendship
[53:57] so
[53:58] might be a little different how we start
[54:00] out but we'll get there
[54:03] hopefully
[54:04] hey Nancy you just pray with me this
[54:06] evening that it it'll come together like
[54:08] what's in my mind you know
[54:11] amen so maybe this evening will turn to
[54:13] John 19.
[54:16] and verse 10 John 19 and verse 10.
[54:26] then saith pilate unto him
[54:29] speaketh thou not unto me knowest thou
[54:33] not that I have power to crucify thee
[54:36] and the power to release thee
[54:39] and Jesus answered and
[54:41] thou couldst have no power at all
[54:44] against me except it were given from
[54:47] above
[54:48] therefore he that delivereth me unto
[54:52] thee hath the greater sin
[54:56] and from since
[54:57] forth pilate sought to release him
[55:01] but the Jews cried out saying if thou
[55:05] let this man go thou were not Caesar's
[55:09] friend whosoever maketh himself the king
[55:13] speaketh against Caesar and when pilate
[55:16] therefore heard that saying he brought
[55:19] Jesus forth sat him down in the Judgment
[55:22] seat and play in a place called the
[55:26] pavement but in the Hebrew gabitha
[55:30] and it was the preparation of the
[55:33] Passover and about the sixth hour and he
[55:37] said unto the Jews behold your king but
[55:40] they cried out away with him away with
[55:43] him crucify him pilate saith unto them
[55:47] shalt I crucify your king
[55:50] and the chief priest answered we have no
[55:54] King but Caesar
[55:58] maybe you have a need upon your heart
[56:00] this evening just pray over the reading
[56:02] of these scriptures
[56:03] dear heavenly father Lord we we thank
[56:06] you for letting us just be able to just
[56:07] join together this evening around the
[56:09] Word of Life Lord and we pray that these
[56:13] scriptures would just lift off the pages
[56:15] this evening and just go to each and
[56:17] every heart Lord anyone that would have
[56:19] a need here tonight we just ask that it
[56:21] would just be Minister too Lord Lord
[56:24] just give us what we need and not what
[56:25] we want this evening Lord Lord just give
[56:28] us an outpouring of the Holy Ghost once
[56:30] more Lord in Jesus name we pray amen
[56:34] amen you can be seated
[56:46] so this evening I would like to take
[56:48] that that fault of why I have a friend
[56:51] like that
[56:52] and I'd like to take it from the thought
[56:54] of verse verse 12 in chapter 19 here and
[56:59] it says
[57:00] and then forth pilate sought to release
[57:03] him see pilate wanted to release Jesus
[57:05] at this point
[57:07] but then the Pharisees Cried Out unto
[57:10] him saying if you let this man go Thou
[57:14] Art not
[57:15] a friend Thou Art not Caesar's friend
[57:19] could you just imagine having a friend
[57:22] like that
[57:23] why would you want a friend like Caesar
[57:27] a man that's power hungry a man that's
[57:30] the deceitful a man that is causing the
[57:34] Nations to do things that is just
[57:36] immorally inappropriate
[57:38] but this this pilot wanted to be called
[57:42] a friend of Caesar's now
[57:44] I would hate to think that I chose a
[57:48] friend like Caesar over Jesus Christ as
[57:52] he stood there in pavement before the
[57:54] Judgment seat and Caesar wanting to
[57:57] release him
[57:58] but the Pharisees crying out
[58:01] hey don't forget your friend don't
[58:03] forget your friends
[58:06] so I want to remind each and every one
[58:08] of us this evening young people old
[58:10] people on all be careful of who you put
[58:13] your friendship in
[58:15] amen
[58:16] because the Friendship of Caesar
[58:19] made pilate crucify Christ
[58:22] when he thought to release him
[58:25] he came and said
[58:26] because I have a friend like that
[58:28] because I have a friend that is so
[58:30] deceitful so power hungry but I want to
[58:33] be upon the coattail so to speak of of
[58:36] Caesar I want to ride the power train up
[58:38] to the top
[58:39] because that's where Caesar was hidden
[58:41] he was looking to create a new world
[58:43] create just something that would be just
[58:46] for the Romans
[58:47] and that's what everybody thought at the
[58:49] time that that's the road that it was
[58:51] hitting but even the Pharisees wanted to
[58:55] take that same side
[58:56] that same side of will would have
[58:58] protection underneath Caesar we would
[59:00] have protection underneath Pilate
[59:03] but why would you want a friend like
[59:04] that and maybe you'd be sitting here
[59:06] this evening
[59:07] that you can think
[59:09] I might have a friend like that I might
[59:12] have somebody that's power hungry I
[59:14] might have somebody that's manipulative
[59:17] you know what I mean there I can't say
[59:18] that word exactly but somebody that will
[59:20] make you do things that you really don't
[59:22] want to do but because you're their
[59:23] friend
[59:24] and that friendship has led you down a
[59:27] road of Destruction
[59:29] and now now you see the outcome of it
[59:32] now you later on 2000 years later we can
[59:35] look back and pilot and say look look
[59:37] what you thought
[59:38] look what you did here
[59:41] amen
[59:42] you wouldn't want a friend like that
[59:45] so so why in today's age would we want
[59:47] friends like that around us even now
[59:50] so think about who your friends are
[59:52] children that as we have many that's
[59:54] getting ready and already headed back to
[59:56] school watch Who Your Friends Are
[59:59] be careful of who you put your
[1:00:01] friendship in there's many adults that
[1:00:03] are sitting here this evening that they
[1:00:04] can testify that one time or another in
[1:00:07] their life they had a bad friend
[1:00:10] or they had a good friend
[1:00:12] and a lot of times those bad friends
[1:00:15] it was bad bad it it was a lot easier to
[1:00:19] be bad than it was to be good amen it
[1:00:22] come real quick I know going down the
[1:00:25] hallways in the high school there was
[1:00:27] certain groups that were so easy to get
[1:00:30] caught up in because they were the life
[1:00:32] of the party they were they were the
[1:00:34] life of everything they wanted to do
[1:00:36] well that was that's so easy to go with
[1:00:38] because that's what the world is going
[1:00:40] with
[1:00:42] but it's hard to take the other Road
[1:00:45] as my dad would tell me you know many
[1:00:47] times when people would just say stuff
[1:00:49] and pick on me and do stuff not too much
[1:00:52] when I was bigger but they would still
[1:00:54] make fun of you know who I was who I was
[1:00:57] trying to be I was trying to be a
[1:00:59] Christian in that day I was trying to
[1:01:01] walk and stand stand true
[1:01:03] so he gave me some advice it takes more
[1:01:06] of a man to carry the Bible down the
[1:01:08] hallways
[1:01:10] so offer that to them if they're such a
[1:01:13] man tell them carry this
[1:01:16] if you're such a man
[1:01:18] carry that
[1:01:20] amen
[1:01:29] so if you have friends that is not
[1:01:31] willing to carry the gospel that is not
[1:01:34] willing to take a stand for Christ
[1:01:36] you might ought to reconsider your
[1:01:38] friendships because that friendship
[1:01:40] might be taking you down a path of
[1:01:42] Destruction a path of Hell a path of
[1:01:45] death
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:49] because sin is pleasurable for a season
[1:01:53] it may seem all fun and games it's all
[1:01:56] great it's all fine and dandy until
[1:01:58] you're in the back seat of a cop car
[1:02:02] it's the truth I had many people that
[1:02:05] had many regrets when I put them in the
[1:02:07] back seat of the cop course
[1:02:08] a lot of regrets good people good people
[1:02:12] but a lot of regrets in the back seat of
[1:02:14] a cop car amen but there is a lot of
[1:02:17] people here
[1:02:18] that missed that back seat by just a
[1:02:21] moment
[1:02:22] a lot of us
[1:02:23] I at a moment of time we each and every
[1:02:26] one of us sitting here could have been
[1:02:28] in the back seat of a cop car and our
[1:02:29] life changed in a moment
[1:02:31] because of the friends that we had chose
[1:02:34] to hang out with
[1:02:36] but why would you want a friendship like
[1:02:38] that
[1:02:39] why would you want to lead to go down a
[1:02:41] path of destruction
[1:02:43] pilate sought friendship like that
[1:02:46] the Pharisees sought leadership like
[1:02:48] that
[1:02:50] and even Eve
[1:02:52] Eve in the Garden of Eden how great it
[1:02:56] was
[1:02:58] and there was the serpent
[1:03:00] but as brother Branham says
[1:03:03] he misrepresented one word
[1:03:07] and she believed the misrepresentation
[1:03:09] of one word that thou shalt not die
[1:03:13] Thou shalt not
[1:03:16] and that friendship
[1:03:18] as brother Brandon would say it an
[1:03:20] invisible Union of the Bride he says we
[1:03:22] see that misrepresentation of this word
[1:03:25] as Satan misrepresented it to Eve caused
[1:03:28] her to doubt one word just out one word
[1:03:31] that's all he's got to make you doubt
[1:03:33] one word
[1:03:35] yeah
[1:03:37] and it threw the whole human race into a
[1:03:41] falling chaos by just one word
[1:03:44] the whole human race into a fallen chaos
[1:03:47] with one word but she chose
[1:03:50] to listen to that one word thou shalt
[1:03:52] not
[1:03:54] and it threw the whole human race into
[1:03:56] chaos division
[1:03:58] Darkness desolate
[1:04:00] but we thank God for a way out of it
[1:04:03] a way out many times our our own life
[1:04:07] was destruction
[1:04:11] but I want to I want to say here also
[1:04:13] that Eve then began the blame game
[1:04:16] she
[1:04:18] here's Adam
[1:04:20] he said because of the woman you gave me
[1:04:23] you know when you get in a bad spot a
[1:04:25] lot of times you start pushing it to the
[1:04:27] next person you start passing the
[1:04:29] envelope so to speak blaming the next
[1:04:32] one
[1:04:33] So Adam blamed Eve and then Eve Bladen
[1:04:36] the serpent
[1:04:40] it caused him to crawl upon his belly
[1:04:44] eat dust the rest of his life
[1:04:48] the blame game goes a long way in your
[1:04:51] friendship
[1:04:52] don't think that you're just going to
[1:04:54] get by
[1:04:55] I tell Titus and India all the time you
[1:04:58] watch Who Your Friends Are
[1:05:00] because a lot of times you are the
[1:05:03] brightest light in the darkest group
[1:05:08] do you understand what I'm saying there
[1:05:09] because you are a bright light you are
[1:05:12] Christ
[1:05:14] and when you're hanging out with a dark
[1:05:16] group of people the brightest person in
[1:05:18] the crowd hangs out
[1:05:21] it shows up
[1:05:23] I I can't help but show up Christ can't
[1:05:26] help but show up so you watch who you're
[1:05:29] hanging out with because you're going to
[1:05:30] be the one chosen you're going to be the
[1:05:32] one picked you're going to be the one
[1:05:34] that gets in trouble out of all of them
[1:05:37] so so children remember that
[1:05:40] even parents remember that
[1:05:44] in Psalms 25 and verse 14 and 15 it says
[1:05:49] the Friendship of the Lord is for those
[1:05:52] who fear Him and He makes known unto
[1:05:55] them his Covenant my eyes are ever
[1:05:59] toward the lord
[1:06:00] for he will pluck my feet out of the net
[1:06:03] oh aren't you so glad that there's times
[1:06:05] that Lord I need you Lord I'm in a mess
[1:06:08] I'm tangled up and I have no way out but
[1:06:11] I need you but his eyes are upon you
[1:06:13] this word friendship
[1:06:16] of the Lord it says
[1:06:18] or a secret counsel
[1:06:21] having a secret counsel refers
[1:06:24] to engaging in a private discussion or
[1:06:27] usually into confidential manner that
[1:06:30] typically involves sharing sensitive and
[1:06:33] confidential information
[1:06:35] discussing personal matters
[1:06:38] I'll thank you Lord
[1:06:40] thank you Lord a friendship with the
[1:06:42] Lord
[1:06:43] secret counsel
[1:06:45] one that's not going to go tell
[1:06:47] everybody on you
[1:06:48] one that's not going to go and just tell
[1:06:51] that Satan Satan look what they've done
[1:06:53] done now no he's a secret counsel the
[1:06:56] friendship with the Lord is a secret
[1:06:58] counsel
[1:07:00] to discuss personal things with
[1:07:05] you know when you're in the secret
[1:07:06] Chambers
[1:07:07] of your prayer room
[1:07:09] and you can just talk to Jesus one on
[1:07:12] one
[1:07:12] and he knows he already knows
[1:07:16] but he wants to hear you say it
[1:07:18] sometimes
[1:07:19] he wants to hear you say Lord you've
[1:07:22] been so good to me
[1:07:23] Lord when you got me out of this mess
[1:07:26] nobody even saw it but you saw it Lord
[1:07:28] and Lord I Thank you for letting me get
[1:07:30] out of this mess
[1:07:32] oh what a friendship what a what a what
[1:07:34] to be able to just have a secret counsel
[1:07:36] like that
[1:07:38] in Galatians 5 and 22 it talks of the
[1:07:42] fruit of the spirit here it says the
[1:07:44] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[1:07:47] long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith
[1:07:50] meekness Temperance against such there
[1:07:54] is no law
[1:07:56] and they that are Christ have crucified
[1:07:58] in the flesh with the afflictions of
[1:08:01] lust
[1:08:02] if we live in the spirit let us also
[1:08:05] walk in the spirit
[1:08:07] let us not be
[1:08:09] judicious
[1:08:11] I'm not saying that right desires of
[1:08:14] vain Glory provoking one another
[1:08:17] envying one another
[1:08:19] and then another translation it says
[1:08:21] about in Galatians this is the passion
[1:08:23] translation it says of the fruits it
[1:08:26] says Divine love in all the variety of
[1:08:30] expressions
[1:08:31] joy that overflows peace that subdues
[1:08:35] patient that endures kindness and action
[1:08:40] life full of virtue
[1:08:43] faith that prevails
[1:08:45] gentleness of the heart and strength of
[1:08:48] the spirit
[1:08:50] I like that I like that love in all the
[1:08:54] variety of expressions
[1:08:58] we find that each and every one of those
[1:09:00] in Christ
[1:09:02] as in verse
[1:09:04] First Timothy it says it says and Grace
[1:09:07] our Lord was exceedingly abundantly
[1:09:09] faith and love
[1:09:10] which is Christ Jesus
[1:09:13] which is faithful saying
[1:09:15] is a faithful saying and worthy of all
[1:09:19] acceptation
[1:09:20] that Christ Jesus came into the world to
[1:09:23] save Sinners of whom I am chief how be
[1:09:27] it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in
[1:09:30] me first Jesus Christ might show forth
[1:09:33] all long-suffering
[1:09:35] for a pattern to them which you're
[1:09:37] Hereafter believe
[1:09:39] on him to life Everlasting
[1:09:43] Oh What A Love Like That
[1:09:45] a love like that with Christ
[1:09:49] in that
[1:09:51] love in all the variety of expressions
[1:09:56] the Greeks have four words for the the
[1:10:00] word love
[1:10:02] enter us
[1:10:04] is the word that is relationship
[1:10:08] Sensational relationship with your
[1:10:10] partner
[1:10:12] throughout the whole body it expresses
[1:10:14] Eros how you should love your wife
[1:10:17] husband loves your wife
[1:10:20] maybe we'll turn over to
[1:10:25] don't even have written down but it says
[1:10:27] husbands love your wives even so is
[1:10:28] Christ loved the church
[1:10:30] but that that love like that
[1:10:33] we look back to Song of Solomon and how
[1:10:36] that that is filled with the love of
[1:10:38] Eros and how that that teaches us
[1:10:41] younger men how to love our wives
[1:10:44] and us women
[1:10:45] excuse me not us women
[1:10:48] I ain't even there
[1:10:52] but the women how to love their husbands
[1:10:54] in the Song of Solomon in the eighth
[1:10:58] chapter and the seventh verse the bride
[1:11:01] is speaking unto Solomon it says many
[1:11:03] Waters cannot quench love
[1:11:05] neither can the floods even drowned it
[1:11:07] if any man would give all that substance
[1:11:10] of his house for this love
[1:11:14] money couldn't buy it from her
[1:11:17] floods floods couldn't keep them apart
[1:11:20] floods couldn't drown it from them
[1:11:23] that's the kind of love that you need to
[1:11:25] have in your relationship
[1:11:26] that's the kind of love that you want to
[1:11:28] look for young people in a husband or a
[1:11:30] wife
[1:11:31] that's what you want that kind of love
[1:11:35] that Above All Things money can't buy it
[1:11:39] nothing could separate it
[1:11:42] the devil wants to divide everything he
[1:11:44] wants to separate everything he wants to
[1:11:46] separate marriage
[1:11:48] he wants to separate you
[1:11:50] but there's no separation in that so you
[1:11:53] have that in your mind that that love
[1:11:56] amen another one is storage love it's a
[1:12:00] family love
[1:12:01] a love for the family
[1:12:03] the other one is filio love brotherly
[1:12:06] love for your brother for your sister
[1:12:08] then agape love agape love of God's love
[1:12:13] unconditional love a love that loves
[1:12:16] like no other
[1:12:17] that we can't even express how much God
[1:12:19] loves us
[1:12:21] amen
[1:12:25] so many times in friendship
[1:12:28] I'd like to give the definition it says
[1:12:30] in Friendship there is more is more than
[1:12:32] just a casual acquaintance or a social
[1:12:35] connection
[1:12:36] it is a bond that is built on love trust
[1:12:39] Mutual understanding true friends are
[1:12:42] those who accept us for who we are
[1:12:44] supporting us through the thick and thin
[1:12:48] they are there to collaborate our
[1:12:51] victories to lead us into helping hand
[1:12:54] during challenging times
[1:12:57] that's a true friendship right there
[1:13:00] when the times of your life are
[1:13:01] struggled
[1:13:03] the main thing that I've learned in life
[1:13:06] a lot of times we don't always get it
[1:13:07] right the first time
[1:13:09] I told this to my children and my wife
[1:13:11] the other night in our devotional we
[1:13:13] don't always get it right the first time
[1:13:16] in what we would say or what we would
[1:13:18] think
[1:13:20] and many times it don't come out like
[1:13:22] what you're thinking
[1:13:23] and and so when you try to discipline
[1:13:27] your children or you you say something
[1:13:30] to your wife
[1:13:31] but it comes out worse than what you
[1:13:34] actually thought I don't know if you've
[1:13:36] ever had that happen but it's happened
[1:13:38] at our house praise the Lord maybe I'm
[1:13:41] just the only one honest here this
[1:13:42] evening but
[1:13:44] and then then the Lord will come back
[1:13:46] and say you might not should have done
[1:13:48] it just quite like that
[1:13:50] you know I heard something the other day
[1:13:52] there's three of the hardest things to
[1:13:54] say as a southern man I'm sorry
[1:13:58] please forgive me
[1:14:00] and Worcestershire sauce
[1:14:11] those are hard things to say
[1:14:14] you know but we don't always get it
[1:14:16] right that first time
[1:14:18] and so when you have that partner in
[1:14:20] your life that you go
[1:14:23] I didn't get it right and they know you
[1:14:25] didn't get it right and sometimes it
[1:14:29] takes a while for them to let you know
[1:14:32] they might let you know quicker than
[1:14:33] others but
[1:14:37] but you don't always get it right the
[1:14:38] first time
[1:14:40] brother Branham would would say this in
[1:14:43] one of his sermons
[1:14:45] and it says
[1:14:47] no I know you're just home folks here
[1:14:49] this morning and if I've ever impressed
[1:14:52] you brother and her sister as a
[1:14:54] know-it-all please forgive me I don't
[1:14:56] mean to do that
[1:14:58] I'm sitting here this morning talking
[1:15:00] before men who are Scholars men who are
[1:15:04] smart
[1:15:06] I'm illiterate I can't even pronounce my
[1:15:08] scriptures right
[1:15:10] I got a chapter to read this morning
[1:15:13] and I'm going to ask my brother if he
[1:15:17] would read it for me because I can't
[1:15:18] even pronounce the names of it it's
[1:15:21] first Chronicles 13 He says if you will
[1:15:24] brother Jack will you be hunting that up
[1:15:27] for me for my scripture I can't even
[1:15:30] pronounce those names and I'm letting
[1:15:32] him do that because he can pronounce
[1:15:34] them
[1:15:36] and I know I'm talking to Smart men and
[1:15:39] but Brethren these things are done that
[1:15:42] you might not look at my illiteracy
[1:15:46] but believe that I'm telling you the
[1:15:48] truth it's God telling you the truth
[1:15:51] that's the truth
[1:15:53] and he says that in trying to do God a
[1:15:55] service without being in God's will so I
[1:15:59] want to take this
[1:16:01] brother Branham
[1:16:03] standing before this audience of
[1:16:05] Scholars men and women and he he wants
[1:16:08] to impress on them that please don't
[1:16:11] think that I'm a know-it-all
[1:16:13] but I also want to say here is
[1:16:16] brother Branham was the prophet
[1:16:19] brother brother Branham could have
[1:16:22] carried himself a little differently
[1:16:25] but to his home folks to his people to
[1:16:28] the Bride of Jesus Christ he wanted them
[1:16:30] to make sure he knew he was a he was
[1:16:32] just a humble man
[1:16:35] he could have pushed through the
[1:16:36] scriptures that that was being read here
[1:16:38] he could have pushed through the the
[1:16:40] names and and nobody would have said
[1:16:42] nothing to him there might have been
[1:16:44] some Scholars or somebody there that
[1:16:45] would have thought well that's not
[1:16:47] exactly how he could pronounce it but
[1:16:48] that's fine that's fine he's given us
[1:16:51] the message that's laid upon his heart
[1:16:54] and and he's he's bearing this that
[1:16:57] I'm not I'm not always getting it right
[1:17:00] here
[1:17:02] as far as what I say but
[1:17:04] but he's presenting the word
[1:17:06] and he's wanting you to know that I'm
[1:17:09] trying my best here
[1:17:11] because when I'm getting it it's fresh
[1:17:15] and from where I come from
[1:17:18] we don't know how to say all these
[1:17:20] things and do all these things and so
[1:17:22] many times and and we're all people of
[1:17:25] the valley here we do the same thing
[1:17:29] we we might say a word a certain way
[1:17:31] that somebody don't know what you're
[1:17:33] what you're saying I mean Granddad Homer
[1:17:36] used to watch a show called a mountain
[1:17:37] talk and and some of the words that was
[1:17:40] on the show Mountain talk we knew what
[1:17:43] they were
[1:17:44] I mean poke is a sack go down to Creek
[1:17:47] and it's just right down there yeah and
[1:17:49] I mean a lot of Northern or other people
[1:17:52] might not even know what you're talking
[1:17:53] about
[1:17:55] but sometimes you just don't get it out
[1:17:57] the way that people don't understand it
[1:17:59] that way
[1:18:00] and so you want them to understand it
[1:18:02] but you want them to have that
[1:18:03] friendship because we all want to be
[1:18:04] friends we all want to have friends
[1:18:08] we it's just something about us we want
[1:18:10] to be with people
[1:18:12] we want to have that
[1:18:14] and many times
[1:18:16] as it would say in the Bible it says a
[1:18:19] brother
[1:18:20] offended is harder one than a strong
[1:18:23] City
[1:18:24] but also when we're saying these things
[1:18:28] think about it first
[1:18:30] think about what you're saying I know
[1:18:32] and people say Well it fell out before I
[1:18:34] before I could even think about it well
[1:18:36] that's pretty hard to do sometimes
[1:18:39] and there's some people that you go I
[1:18:42] wish I could have duct tape and just put
[1:18:44] right over their mouth
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:48] we all know one like that amen we thank
[1:18:50] the Lord for people like that because it
[1:18:52] makes us better people
[1:18:54] amen because then we go I need to even
[1:18:57] do better about thinking about what I
[1:18:59] say
[1:18:59] because I don't want to sound like that
[1:19:01] amen
[1:19:04] but we want to be friends to them we
[1:19:06] want to show them kindness we want to
[1:19:07] show them things
[1:19:09] but it's hard sometimes
[1:19:12] so so you got to accept sometimes the
[1:19:16] way that they are
[1:19:17] and the way that it's going to come out
[1:19:19] and you're going
[1:19:20] oh my word
[1:19:22] God bless them Hallelujah
[1:19:27] many times we want as friends
[1:19:30] we need to learn how to give and take
[1:19:31] advice
[1:19:33] not always do we need a yes person in
[1:19:35] our life
[1:19:36] everybody likes to hear the word yes you
[1:19:39] can do this yes you look great in that
[1:19:41] yes yes you don't you don't need to go
[1:19:43] on a diet yes you're fine you're fine
[1:19:46] the way you are yes yes yes we don't
[1:19:48] always need a yes person in our life
[1:19:51] sometimes we need that person that says
[1:19:53] put that donut back
[1:19:57] or
[1:19:59] or that that vest might be a little
[1:20:01] tight on you this evening
[1:20:03] maybe we'll walk again tomorrow amen
[1:20:08] so you don't always need that yes person
[1:20:11] so when you're looking for a bride don't
[1:20:14] look for one that's going to be yes yes
[1:20:16] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
[1:20:17] yes yes
[1:20:19] you look for a bride or a husband that
[1:20:22] is a man or a woman of the home
[1:20:25] one that that knows Christ
[1:20:29] many times I
[1:20:31] in today's age you look
[1:20:34] at the outward first
[1:20:38] instead of looking at the inside
[1:20:40] I want to tell you young people their
[1:20:42] first priority ought to be Christ
[1:20:44] when you're looking for a husband or
[1:20:46] wife
[1:20:47] the first priority
[1:20:49] ought to be Christ
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:56] brother Branham says it like this
[1:20:58] and I want to read this passage and
[1:21:00] excuse my my reading this evening so
[1:21:02] much but I have so much hay on the fork
[1:21:04] I don't want to get it messed up
[1:21:09] now it's a serious thing
[1:21:12] when you choose a wife a man
[1:21:14] for the vows here till death
[1:21:17] do we part
[1:21:19] and it's how we should keep it and you
[1:21:22] take that vow before God
[1:21:24] that only death will separate you
[1:21:28] and I think that we should a man in his
[1:21:31] right mind that's planning a future
[1:21:33] should choose a wife very carefully be
[1:21:37] careful of what you're doing and a woman
[1:21:39] choosing a husband or accepting the
[1:21:42] choice of a husband
[1:21:44] she should be real careful with what
[1:21:46] she's doing and especially these days a
[1:21:49] man should think and pray before he
[1:21:51] chooses a wife
[1:21:53] I think today what's got so many divorce
[1:21:56] cases now
[1:21:57] that lead the we lead the world in
[1:22:00] America
[1:22:01] in divorce cases we lead the rest of the
[1:22:04] world there's more divorces here than
[1:22:06] anywhere else in this nation and we sh
[1:22:09] and we're supposed to be a Christian
[1:22:10] Nation what a reproach our divorce
[1:22:13] courts I think are the reason because
[1:22:16] men got themselves away from God and
[1:22:19] women got away from God
[1:22:21] and we find that if a man prayed and a
[1:22:24] woman prayed over the matter not just
[1:22:26] look for the pretty set of eyes or big
[1:22:28] strong shoulders or such as that or
[1:22:31] someone other than worldly affection but
[1:22:35] would look to first to God and say God
[1:22:38] is this your plan
[1:22:41] so if you're sitting here this evening
[1:22:42] or if you're by the way the internet and
[1:22:44] you're looking for a husband you're
[1:22:47] looking for a wife
[1:22:48] have you prayed about it
[1:22:51] have you prayed
[1:22:52] have you prayed Lord send them maybe
[1:22:55] that's what you need to pray I don't
[1:22:57] know
[1:22:58] you know you you might just be ready but
[1:23:00] just more simple but pray about the
[1:23:02] matter
[1:23:04] many young people sitting here
[1:23:06] not even looking towards that but you
[1:23:08] might need to start praying about your
[1:23:10] future husband or wife
[1:23:11] Lord help them build the character that
[1:23:13] I would want in my house
[1:23:16] and then that's when you start looking
[1:23:18] for that husband or wife
[1:23:28] forgive me here
[1:23:33] as he's talking about here in divorce
[1:23:35] cases and and I would say that if if he
[1:23:38] would be in today's age
[1:23:41] he would shake his head about the
[1:23:43] divorce cases that we have and
[1:23:45] but it's not maybe so much divorce cases
[1:23:48] but just sleeping together or being with
[1:23:50] each other before even marriage
[1:23:54] it's rampant in in our nation
[1:23:57] but that's what Satan wanted to do he
[1:23:59] wanted to separate marriage
[1:24:02] he wanted to make adultery okay
[1:24:05] he wanted to say Satan wanted to tell
[1:24:08] you
[1:24:09] it's it's all right to do that it is not
[1:24:12] all right let me tell you
[1:24:15] it is a sacred thing and the world has
[1:24:18] perverted it
[1:24:19] has divided it
[1:24:21] the immorality of the today's age
[1:24:25] but I want to tell you when you're
[1:24:27] looking for a husband or wife
[1:24:28] look for that Godly character
[1:24:31] in them
[1:24:33] for it says in mark it says a kingdom
[1:24:35] divided against itself a kingdom that
[1:24:38] cannot stand
[1:24:39] if you're living and being with a
[1:24:42] non-Christian things are so much harder
[1:24:47] you're at War almost all the time back
[1:24:49] to back I could not imagine I have a
[1:24:53] lovely wife Christian wife Godly wife
[1:24:56] that has raised our kids in the fear of
[1:24:58] admiration of the Lord
[1:25:00] I could not imagine coming home and
[1:25:03] having to straight everything out if I
[1:25:05] did not have a Christian wife
[1:25:07] one that taught my children Christ
[1:25:11] a friend that I could speak with like
[1:25:14] that
[1:25:15] I thank the Lord for a wonderful wife
[1:25:17] like that
[1:25:20] says unconditional love and acceptance a
[1:25:23] true friend loves us who we are
[1:25:26] accepting our flaws or imperfections or
[1:25:29] embracing our uniqueness and provide us
[1:25:31] with a safe place
[1:25:33] for ourselves without fear of rejection
[1:25:39] aren't you glad that you have someone
[1:25:41] like that through Christ
[1:25:45] through Christ that can look down
[1:25:46] through all of the imperfections through
[1:25:48] all of you flaws
[1:25:50] and he says I love you
[1:25:52] an unconditional love
[1:25:55] like that
[1:25:56] A Love Like Ruth and Boaz as Ruth would
[1:25:59] go to glean in the field
[1:26:01] she would be with Naomi and she had left
[1:26:04] and she was a moabitus and as Boaz Came
[1:26:06] Upon her cleaning in the field
[1:26:09] he wanted to know who she was by his
[1:26:12] servants there he wanted to know who
[1:26:14] this this lady is I have not seen before
[1:26:18] and as she's gleaning there he tells her
[1:26:21] don't glean nowhere else look to no
[1:26:23] other fields but hear
[1:26:26] he told his servants how to take care of
[1:26:28] her let her even glean over in the other
[1:26:31] let her glean where there's even more
[1:26:33] food than what there is here with the
[1:26:35] others
[1:26:37] and I want to say that she did something
[1:26:40] to
[1:26:41] to step out
[1:26:43] when
[1:26:44] there's many things that people won't do
[1:26:47] she chose to go and work
[1:26:50] her beauty could have found her
[1:26:53] affection in a husband
[1:26:55] because she was a beautiful lady but she
[1:26:58] chose to get out in the field she chose
[1:27:00] to go working for Naomi
[1:27:03] she chose to go to work and I want to
[1:27:05] say young people when you're looking for
[1:27:07] a bride or you're looking for a husband
[1:27:09] and I and I know this is kind of leading
[1:27:11] towards that but we have several Youth
[1:27:13] and several Andrews speaking to several
[1:27:16] of them but
[1:27:18] look for ones that work
[1:27:21] look for ones that do things around the
[1:27:23] home
[1:27:24] you don't want just some baby doll
[1:27:26] princess
[1:27:28] and you don't want some just gamer that
[1:27:29] sits on the couch in his mom and Daddy's
[1:27:31] basement
[1:27:33] amen
[1:27:35] so when Ruth was gleaning in the field
[1:27:37] she said I can work I can do things
[1:27:42] that caught his eye first
[1:27:45] so raise up your children how to do
[1:27:47] things around the house
[1:27:49] teach them how to do those things I
[1:27:51] teach we have our kids we have them
[1:27:54] clean the toilets we have them clean
[1:27:55] their bathrooms we have them vacuum the
[1:27:57] floors
[1:27:58] yes they hate it
[1:28:00] but what are you doing you're teaching
[1:28:02] them how to work
[1:28:04] I teach them how to iron their clothes I
[1:28:06] do not want them going to their first
[1:28:08] job interview and the the boss looks
[1:28:11] across the table and go
[1:28:13] when was the last time you ironed your
[1:28:15] shirt
[1:28:17] as a young age I was taught how to iron
[1:28:21] so now I can teach my children how to
[1:28:23] iron
[1:28:24] and you know what this teaches them when
[1:28:26] you teach them how to clean the toilets
[1:28:27] how to clean the bathrooms it makes them
[1:28:29] not want to go do those things later in
[1:28:32] life
[1:28:33] so they'll work a little harder
[1:28:35] amen but you still got to do it yeah
[1:28:39] you still got to do it you still got to
[1:28:42] carry out the trash Monday morning
[1:28:43] dad come back home today and I actually
[1:28:46] went up beforehand and we've had a bear
[1:28:48] getting into our trash and I thought
[1:28:50] he's going to come home from preaching
[1:28:51] all these meetings and there's going to
[1:28:52] be trash all through the woods and I
[1:28:55] don't want him to have to go pick that
[1:28:56] up
[1:28:57] so I went and did that but if I had not
[1:29:00] heeda went right out there and he'd have
[1:29:01] picked up the trash so even after all
[1:29:04] he's been through all that he's done he
[1:29:06] still will go pick up the trash
[1:29:10] so think about that kind of thing think
[1:29:13] about that
[1:29:14] the power of that working going and
[1:29:17] doing things
[1:29:18] think about what that's going to build
[1:29:20] in your life
[1:29:23] but see Boaz also looked and he said I
[1:29:27] know her past she was a moabitus I know
[1:29:30] what she went through having a husband
[1:29:32] the first time
[1:29:34] I know how she left her family how she
[1:29:36] left her for that land and come to a
[1:29:38] foreign land with Naomi all of those
[1:29:40] things all of those little things that
[1:29:43] that he could have said I don't need a
[1:29:46] bride like that I I don't want one like
[1:29:48] that but he chose Ruth
[1:29:50] through all of that
[1:29:52] all of that to be his bride
[1:29:56] what a love what a kinsman redeemer like
[1:29:59] that what a love that we have in Christ
[1:30:02] like that
[1:30:04] what a love that he would come and show
[1:30:07] us support and encouragement
[1:30:09] because true friends are our
[1:30:11] cheerleaders offering unwavering support
[1:30:13] and encouragement they can motivate and
[1:30:16] reach
[1:30:17] that we would reach our fullest
[1:30:19] potential
[1:30:20] leading us into helping to achieve our
[1:30:24] dreams
[1:30:26] that's what our parents
[1:30:28] has done for us me Andrew and Whitney
[1:30:32] so a friendship role as I said before in
[1:30:35] that
[1:30:36] storage a love that love of a parent
[1:30:39] that family love that showed us how to
[1:30:41] do things and encouraged us encouraged
[1:30:45] us
[1:30:47] so you're not don't don't just beat your
[1:30:49] children and tell them they can't
[1:30:51] achieve their goals don't keep a cinder
[1:30:53] block on their head so to speak and say
[1:30:55] you're not going to ever grow up you're
[1:30:57] not encourage them to achieve great
[1:31:00] things
[1:31:01] and charge them in their life
[1:31:06] I tell Titus all the time quote the
[1:31:08] scripture I can do all things through
[1:31:11] Christ that gives me strength I've

[1:32:31] in Psalms 23 we we read this we know
[1:32:34] this it says the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:32:36] shall not want.
[1:32:37] it's there
[1:32:39] it's not that I don't want him as a Lord
[1:32:42] he's already provided it I've just got
[1:32:45] to accept it I've just got to believe it
[1:32:47] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[1:32:49] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[1:32:51] Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth
[1:32:55] me in the past of righteousness for his
[1:32:56] name's sake yea though I walk through
[1:32:59] the valley of the shadow of death I will
[1:33:00] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:33:03] rod and thy saith they comfort me thou
[1:33:05] prepare us to table before me in the
[1:33:07] presence of mine enemies now known as my
[1:33:09] head with all and my cup runneth over
[1:33:12] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:33:14] me all the days of my life and I will
[1:33:17] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:33:20] see our Lord he is our emotional and our
[1:33:23] mental help
[1:33:24] a genuine friendship
[1:33:27] a friendship that has a profound impact
[1:33:30] on our emotional and mental well-being
[1:33:33] he provides a course of relief during
[1:33:36] times of distress
[1:33:39] reduce feelings of loneliness and
[1:33:41] increase overall happiness and
[1:33:43] contentment that's what our Lord is
[1:33:45] there for
[1:33:46] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:33:48] the shadow of death
[1:33:50] there's going to be some dark times in
[1:33:52] your life there's going to be some times
[1:33:54] in your life that you have nowhere else
[1:33:56] to turn to but Christ Our Lord is there
[1:33:59] for us
[1:34:01] Christ Our Lord is there to lead us and
[1:34:04] guide us
[1:34:05] through all of it a truer friend in life
[1:34:09] as pilate rejected a friendship like
[1:34:12] Christ you could bring him back
[1:34:15] stand pilot here
[1:34:17] today bring him from the regions of the
[1:34:20] lost and you can ask him what happened
[1:34:22] two thousand years ago what happened
[1:34:25] that day and he would stand here and say
[1:34:28] as I brought him before the Judgment
[1:34:30] seat
[1:34:32] and I stood there
[1:34:34] and then my wife came to me and she says
[1:34:37] have nothing to do with this just man
[1:34:39] for I have many dreams about him
[1:34:43] and as I stood there that day
[1:34:46] I look before Jesus
[1:34:49] and I chose friendship
[1:34:52] the wrong friendship
[1:34:54] the friendship that led me down a long
[1:34:57] Lonely Road a low road full of
[1:35:00] Destruction and death
[1:35:03] but if I could stand there today
[1:35:06] if I could look at those Pharisees today
[1:35:09] I would say Jesus
[1:35:12] was the friend that I needed
[1:35:15] Jesus was the leader that I needed
[1:35:19] when the Pharisees was crying out Caesar
[1:35:22] is our only King they should have been
[1:35:24] crying out he is the king of kings he is
[1:35:27] the Lord of lords
[1:35:29] he's the truest brightest Morning Star
[1:35:32] there is he's the greatest friend that I
[1:35:34] know
[1:35:36] but they chose a different way he chose
[1:35:39] to wash the blood of Jesus Christ off
[1:35:42] his hands he chose to try to wipe it off
[1:35:46] so even two thousand years later
[1:35:49] he still can't wipe off the blood of
[1:35:51] Jesus Christ
[1:35:52] we could bring back Judas we could say
[1:35:55] Judas is a carrot As you stood there and
[1:35:58] you sold Jesus Christ out for gold for
[1:36:01] silver
[1:36:03] you could hear the silver rattling on
[1:36:05] the platform tonight
[1:36:07] you could say I slayed innocent blood
[1:36:10] he would say that to you tonight the
[1:36:13] friend that I should have chosen as I
[1:36:15] was a disciple as I was a friend to
[1:36:18] Christ I slayed innocent blood
[1:36:21] the Roman soldier as you put the spear
[1:36:24] in his side
[1:36:27] and he would hear father forgive
[1:36:29] for they know not what they do
[1:36:32] he would say
[1:36:34] I wish I hadn't done that
[1:36:36] I wish I hadn't put a spear in his side
[1:36:40] I wish I hadn't
[1:36:42] because now torment death
[1:36:45] hell
[1:36:46] Destruction has led on my life
[1:36:50] because I chose the wrong road
[1:36:55] what road would you choose
[1:36:58] would you stand there and would you
[1:37:00] trade your friendship over Jesus Christ
[1:37:04] you might say no no I wouldn't do Jesus
[1:37:06] like that well don't do them like that
[1:37:08] today don't choose the world over Jesus
[1:37:11] Christ today
[1:37:13] join don't choose some watered down
[1:37:15] gospel over Jesus Christ today
[1:37:19] you need of Christ you need Jesus you
[1:37:22] need this message to clean you oh it's
[1:37:25] hard sometimes is oh brother brother
[1:37:27] Matthew you get all over my toes they
[1:37:29] get all over me all the time and it's
[1:37:32] just so hard but you need that for a
[1:37:34] clean
[1:37:35] you don't want to stand at the end of
[1:37:37] the road in hell and look and say I wish
[1:37:40] I'd chose Jesus as my friend
[1:37:43] I wish I'd would have chose him
[1:37:46] oh but maybe we'll look and we'll
[1:37:49] we'll see
[1:37:51] instead of some of his enemies standing
[1:37:53] here
[1:37:55] shadowrack
[1:37:57] Hebrew children
[1:38:00] how was it they'd stand there and they'd
[1:38:02] say
[1:38:03] oh that morning might have been gloomy
[1:38:06] all the clouds rolled in the sky that
[1:38:09] pit of fire it was hotter seven times
[1:38:13] hotter than hot
[1:38:15] oh but that Dave's Shadrach Meshach and
[1:38:18] Abednego as we standing there
[1:38:22] we turned and we looked and there he was
[1:38:24] the son of God
[1:38:26] standing in the fire with us oh he was a
[1:38:30] friend to me that day
[1:38:31] he was a friend to me that day
[1:38:34] Ezekiel Ezekiel I want to call for you
[1:38:37] testify for us this evening Ezekiel
[1:38:39] would stand there and he'd say oh I seen
[1:38:42] him I seen him in the wheel in the
[1:38:44] middle of the wheel as he stepped out
[1:38:47] Roland clouds like dust off of his feet
[1:38:51] that was the son of God
[1:38:53] that's the greatest friend I've ever
[1:38:55] known
[1:38:57] oh Daniel Daniel would say he's the
[1:39:00] stone he's the one I seen the white wig
[1:39:03] one oh he's a friend to me
[1:39:07] oh but let's say
[1:39:09] what did God say about him what did God
[1:39:12] say on Mount Transfiguration
[1:39:15] when they was all standing there and
[1:39:17] Jesus guessed to the side
[1:39:19] and God would say from heaven this is my
[1:39:23] beloved Son
[1:39:25] in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him
[1:39:31] because he's a friend to you God knew
[1:39:33] that you needed a friend in this day and
[1:39:35] age God knew what you would need
[1:39:39] in the times of life
[1:39:42] like blind Fanny Crosby would say
[1:39:46] I needed a friend like that
[1:39:48] she was scorned by the world tortured by
[1:39:51] hands
[1:39:52] but she would still cry out pass me not
[1:39:56] hold gentle savior
[1:39:59] oh Pass Me Not O General savior hear my
[1:40:03] humble cry
[1:40:06] that's the friend I need
[1:40:09] and I'll stand here before you this
[1:40:11] evening Matthew Spencer and say the
[1:40:13] friend that I needed was Jesus Christ
[1:40:17] he was a best buddy to me in the darkest
[1:40:19] time of my life
[1:40:21] he was a time when there was nobody else
[1:40:23] to turn to but I could turn to Christ
[1:40:26] I could turn to him
[1:40:30] brother Brandon would say it like this
[1:40:32] when I was a little boy I remember I was
[1:40:34] raised up in a real poor family I
[1:40:36] remember many times that I would go out
[1:40:38] with the fellas I couldn't dress like
[1:40:40] they go out decent places
[1:40:43] but I don't know there was something
[1:40:45] about the people I liked I like getting
[1:40:48] with them
[1:40:49] but I was more or less what they call
[1:40:51] the black sheep and when I got saved and
[1:40:54] I found that something in me that I was
[1:40:57] thirsting for
[1:40:59] friend
[1:41:02] somebody that would be a buddy to me
[1:41:05] somebody that I could trust somebody
[1:41:07] that I could sit down and I could talk
[1:41:10] my troubles with over and over
[1:41:13] I found a real true satisfaction When I
[1:41:17] Found Jesus Christ
[1:41:20] the real true satisfier that takes away
[1:41:23] all quenches all the thirsts gives you
[1:41:27] something
[1:41:28] that just looks for
[1:41:31] oh he was a friend to me
[1:41:34] he was a true friend to brother Branham
[1:41:36] he'll be a true friend to you this
[1:41:38] evening
[1:41:39] in the time of your life when you need a
[1:41:42] true friend
[1:41:43] he'll be that friend
[1:41:45] that unconditional agape love that
[1:41:47] overshadows us
[1:41:49] in the darkest times of her life
[1:41:52] he'll be that friend to you this evening
[1:41:55] he'll come and he'll comfort you
[1:41:59] he'll lead you
[1:42:01] be careful who you choose as a friend
[1:42:04] be careful in this world

[1:42:15] what you're listening to

[1:42:59] Eve
[1:43:01] she just stopped long enough
[1:43:04] to be deceived
[1:43:06] just long enough
[1:43:07] to be deceived
[1:43:10] brother Branham says if she had not have
[1:43:12] stopped there had never been no
[1:43:14] deceiving but Eve stopped and when she
[1:43:16] stopped
[1:43:18] that's where she got her deceiving
[1:43:19] instead of pressing on
[1:43:22] the reason Eve was deceived she never
[1:43:25] kept the full word of God
[1:43:27] Satan quoted it to her
[1:43:30] but he never told her the whole truth
[1:43:33] but she'd say long enough to hear part
[1:43:36] of the word and didn't take all of the
[1:43:38] word
[1:43:38] and that's what's the matter today the
[1:43:41] sleeping version has stayed long enough
[1:43:43] to get part of the word but not all the
[1:43:46] word
[1:43:48] the deceived Church stays long enough to
[1:43:51] get part of the word but not all of the
