[15:56] [Music]
[15:57] gracious heavenly father lord we just
[15:59] thank you for coming and being with us
[16:01] in this service tonight we thank you for
[16:03] the wonderful blessings that you've
[16:04] blessed through throughout the services
[16:07] last week his brother aaron was here and
[16:08] spoke directly to our hearts and spoke
[16:10] to many needs that was within the
[16:12] building lord we're just believing that
[16:14] you could do the same thing tonight and
[16:15] just use the minister in a mighty way
[16:17] use them in a way that can speak to the
[16:19] needs that are within the building and
[16:21] even over the airwaves of of the
[16:23] internet lord jesus as these prayer
[16:25] requests come across lord you know each
[16:27] and every need you know exactly what
[16:29] what is needed to be able to
[16:31] allow everything to go back in the
[16:33] perfect working order lord jesus whether
[16:35] it's a sickness or or injury whatever it
[16:38] may be just as you've done in the in the
[16:40] young boy this week is they couldn't
[16:42] find anything there in the brain lord
[16:43] jesus that is nothing but the working
[16:45] hand of you lord we know that if you if
[16:48] you were there
[16:49] death and sickness and everything must
[16:51] flee and lord jesus i just asked that if
[16:53] there would be any bonding spirits or
[16:55] anything that come and try to hinder the
[16:57] service or anything that may come by the
[16:59] way lord i just ask that you will just
[17:01] cast it out and lord jesus i just think
[17:03] that thank you for sending us a prophet
[17:05] that that you he could go and pick out
[17:07] directly what those spirits would do and
[17:09] and he would say it would be like a
[17:10] rubber band if it was a deaf person and
[17:13] it'd be a rubber band squeezing around
[17:14] that that eardrum and and hold it off
[17:17] from that person being able to hear lord
[17:19] jesus it is nothing but a spirit lord
[17:21] jesus i just ask that if there is any
[17:23] spirit that is binding the people i just
[17:25] ask that you will just loose them in the
[17:27] name of jesus christ lord jesus we hear
[17:29] all the spoken requests and we also hear
[17:31] the unspoken request lord jesus we know
[17:34] that there are many needs the lord jesus
[17:36] one that comes across my mind is there
[17:38] there is mothers that are that are
[17:39] praying for for a loved one lord and not
[17:42] just a loved one that that may be lost
[17:44] in a prodigal son lord jesus but i'm
[17:46] believing that that those mothers that
[17:48] are praying to just birth a son or
[17:49] daughter lord jesus that you could just
[17:51] come by their way and that spirit that
[17:53] binds that womb or
[17:55] binds the father lord jesus you can just
[17:57] loose that in the name of jesus christ
[17:59] lord because where you have planted a
[18:01] seed and said there is going to be a
[18:03] seed that will come forth no matter what
[18:05] to say no matter what satan says or no
[18:07] matter what the doctor says lord that
[18:09] seed will come forth and lord jesus we
[18:11] know the testimony of sister whitney and
[18:13] how the doctor said there was no way for
[18:14] that child to be born and now she has
[18:16] two i'm believing that those testimonies
[18:18] will start coming forth lord jesus and i
[18:21] just thank you for those things and i
[18:22] thank you for what you were going to do
[18:23] for us tonight in jesus name we pray
[18:26] amen
[18:31] amen good to be here isn't it amen at
[18:33] this time we're going to receive this
[18:35] evening's offering maybe brother donny
[18:37] would you like to sing one for us this
[18:38] evening
[18:39] amen we have brother donny come sing one

[39:02] i'm glad i didn't go flying in that
[39:03] piano so
[39:05] amen
[39:06] amen i thought that was just a powerful
[39:09] illustration and uh i believe that's
[39:11] something that these little children
[39:13] won't forget and even us older children
[39:15] amen amen exodus chapter 40 and verse 33
[39:20] and he reared up the court around about
[39:23] the tabernacle
[39:28] and the altar and set up the hanging of
[39:30] the court gate
[39:32] so moses finished
[39:35] the work
[39:36] then a cloud covered the tent of the
[39:39] congregation and the glory of the lord
[39:41] filled the tabernacle
[39:43] and moses was not able to enter into the
[39:46] tent of the congregation because the
[39:48] cloud abode thereon
[39:50] and the glory of the lord filled their

[40:04] the tent of the congregation because the
[40:07] cloud abode thereon and the glory of the
[40:10] lord
[40:11] filled the tabernacle
[40:14] and when the cloud was taken up from
[40:16] over the tabernacle the children of
[40:18] israel went onward in all their joint on
[40:21] all their journeys
[40:23] but if the cloud were not taken up they
[40:26] journey not till the day that it was
[40:29] taken up for the cloud of the lord was
[40:31] upon the tabernacle by day
[40:34] and fire was on it by not
[40:37] in the sight of all the house of israel
[40:39] throughout all their journeys
[40:42] let's just speak to the lord this this
[40:44] afternoon
[40:46] heavenly father we come before you
[40:48] lord you are a faithful high priest that
[40:51] can be touched by the feeling of our
[40:52] infirmities and lord what a privilege it
[40:55] is for us to be able to come before you
[40:57] and to reach out and touch you lord and
[41:00] we realize that just one touch
[41:02] lord just of the hem of your garment it
[41:05] healed a blood issue father and maybe
[41:08] there's somebody here that has had a
[41:10] blood issue or has a blood issue in
[41:12] their life but i plead the blood of
[41:14] jesus christ over this congregation
[41:16] tonight and over their lives and over
[41:18] every situation
[41:20] and lord we just want to just cling unto
[41:22] you father and and lord may the holy
[41:25] spirit as we begin to feel you tug on
[41:27] our hearts lord jesus we we've not come
[41:30] here to occupy a pew father we've not
[41:32] come here to be seen of men but father
[41:35] we know that that we're in a very
[41:37] special and a very important time in
[41:40] life that men and women are making
[41:42] decisions even right here and their pews
[41:44] father and lord we know that there is
[41:47] power in our decision and we realize
[41:49] that we are put here on free moral
[41:51] agency but father we we want our choice
[41:54] to line up with your choice and father
[41:57] we ask lord that you would come and you
[41:59] would have the preeminence in this
[42:00] service tonight that you would begin to
[42:02] bless your children like never before
[42:05] father we've we've heard this word all
[42:07] of our life we're not we're not a people
[42:09] that that are new to these things we're
[42:11] not a people that have just come about
[42:14] but lord i understand lord jesus that
[42:16] we're a mature group father we are
[42:18] listening to the word of god daily and
[42:21] lord it would begin to
[42:23] get a little bit more than a man could
[42:25] handle if he began to think about in his
[42:27] own human ability but we realize father
[42:30] that you have something that you want to
[42:32] speak unto us and lord we realize the
[42:34] importance of going to church lord that
[42:36] you told us not to forsake the
[42:38] assembling of ourselves together there
[42:40] as we see the day approaching father so
[42:43] we realize that that you went to church
[42:45] father lord you had to pray so father we
[42:48] how much more as sons and daughters of
[42:50] god is it our importance to draw close
[42:53] to you father and and to ask the lord
[42:56] that your word would come and take the
[42:58] preeminence in our life forgiving us of
[43:00] all of our sins our mistakes and our
[43:02] failures lord and ministering to the
[43:04] lost and the bound father and lord we'll
[43:07] be careful to serve you and give you all
[43:09] the praise the glory and the honor
[43:11] tonight and lord may you be high and
[43:13] lifted up in this place in the name of
[43:15] the lord jesus christ amen amen
[43:19] i'll let you have your seats this
[43:21] evening i'd like to speak to you this
[43:23] evening on awakened awakened to the
[43:27] shekinah awakened to the shekinah and i
[43:30] sent this this quote quotation there
[43:33] brother branham said the identified
[43:34] christ of all ages
[43:36] he said until you come in behind that
[43:40] badger skin
[43:41] and until you get out of your old skin
[43:43] your old thoughts your old creeds and
[43:46] come into the presence of god
[43:49] then the word becomes a living reality
[43:52] to you
[43:53] you see if you're always out there in
[43:54] your own thoughts if you're always out
[43:56] there in your own ways or if you're
[43:58] always staying out there you're you're
[44:00] going to have your own opinion you're
[44:02] going to have your own thoughts he said
[44:03] but he said if you can come in behind
[44:06] the badger skin he said then the word
[44:08] becomes a living reality to you then
[44:11] you're awakened to the shekinah glory
[44:14] then the bible becomes a new book then
[44:17] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[44:20] and forever you're living in his
[44:22] presence eating the show bread that's
[44:25] only provided that day for believers for
[44:28] priest only and we realize that we're
[44:31] living in a very very special and
[44:33] powerful moment in time that we're
[44:35] living in the fulfillment of malachi 4
[44:38] and we're living in the fulfillment of
[44:41] luke 17 and 30 and
[44:43] revelations 3 and 14 and revelations 10
[44:46] 1 and 10 7 but we realize that there's a
[44:50] people that are fulfilling they're
[44:51] fulfilling that portion of scripture
[44:53] that is laying there that's laying in
[44:56] the word of revelations 10 8 through 11
[44:59] that we are to prophesy again and we
[45:02] know that the bible has told us that we
[45:05] are kings and priests and we realize
[45:07] just to set a little set a little
[45:09] foundation that that at the the
[45:12] establishment of the tabernacle that
[45:14] only the priests were able to go in
[45:17] under the tabernacle and carry carry the
[45:20] burdens of the people but the bible
[45:22] tells us in the book of revelations that
[45:24] we are kings and priests and none
[45:27] knowing this that as message believers
[45:30] that this message that we have received
[45:32] is none other than the king's message
[45:35] and this king's message is not leaving
[45:37] us where we were it's not leaving us in
[45:39] our mind complacent it's not leaving us
[45:42] as we were it didn't we didn't come as
[45:44] we were and stay as we were but this
[45:46] message it changed us i remember when i
[45:50] got behind that old badger skin and i
[45:52] remember how that how that this message
[45:54] how that the message brought a new light
[45:56] to the book i remember meeting him face
[45:59] to face one night i i remember the day
[46:01] that he that he got a hold of my life
[46:03] though he saved me 2 000 years ago but i
[46:06] remember the day that i woke up to the
[46:08] fact that i always was a son and
[46:10] daughter of god and i though i'd read
[46:12] this bible many times i read it from
[46:15] matthew to revelation i'd i went back
[46:18] and forth i'd familiarize myself with
[46:20] the psalms but when i had an
[46:22] acquaintance with the shekinah my this
[46:25] bible become a new book i couldn't put
[46:27] it down my wife said there's got to be
[46:29] something up with him
[46:31] i don't know what happened to him out
[46:33] there on those streets but i i got a new
[46:35] husband and i'm so thankful that there
[46:38] was one that came looking for me even
[46:40] though i may not have been looking for
[46:42] him but he woke me up to the fact that
[46:44] he's not a dead god but he's a living
[46:46] god and i'm so thankful to realize this
[46:49] evening that that we're children of the
[46:51] most high god and even though we've got
[46:53] struggles and even though we've got
[46:56] carnal things that are constantly going
[46:58] on this message is moving us into a
[47:00] faith that we're that that we're
[47:02] believing for rapture it's it's taking
[47:05] us higher in our thought it's taken us
[47:07] higher in our worship and we realize
[47:09] that brother madam would say that there
[47:11] is rapturing faith that is laying it
[47:13] right here in the word and i'm so
[47:15] thankful to know that it's this message
[47:18] that'll wake you up to the fact that you
[47:20] don't have to stay here till the bombs
[47:22] drop you don't have to stay here in the
[47:24] tribulation you don't have to go through
[47:26] this chaos but there is a way of escape
[47:29] and we realize that we're living in a
[47:31] world where satan's got an agenda it's
[47:34] not just against the world but it's an
[47:36] attack on the bride of jesus christ and
[47:38] we realize that satan is forcing his
[47:41] agenda he's forcing his temps he's he's
[47:44] forcing his demons to try to influence
[47:46] the service and try to hinder and try to
[47:48] move you into your thoughts and move you
[47:51] out of this service in a way to take you
[47:53] out of this building and take you to
[47:55] your lawnmower or take you to your car
[47:57] problems or or take you to your
[47:59] financial problems but i believe that
[48:01] there's a force of the holy ghost here
[48:03] as well
[48:05] that'll make you leave your problems
[48:07] when you come in a door i believe
[48:09] there's a force of the power of god
[48:11] that'll make you move right into
[48:12] rapturing faith to believe that all
[48:15] things are possible to them that believe
[48:20] we realized that brother branham would
[48:21] say that national forest had put israel
[48:24] back in her homeland he said national
[48:26] forests will also put the world put the
[48:28] church in the world cancel the churches
[48:30] but he said it would be the power of god
[48:32] that would put the people in the bride
[48:34] he said the world forces this way and
[48:36] the world forces that way but god forces
[48:39] upward and we're not sitting here this
[48:41] evening as a bunch of
[48:43] elementary school girls we know exactly
[48:46] what we're talking about this evening
[48:47] and we realize that we are forcing or we
[48:50] are forcing the forcing the issue and
[48:52] standing here and pushing back
[48:56] satan is pushing against us like never
[48:58] before we ought to push back on hell and
[49:01] we ought to tell hell we're not going to
[49:03] stand back and let you run over top of
[49:05] us
[49:08] if hell's going to fight we ought to
[49:09] fight back as well if hell's going to
[49:11] lose every every power it's got against
[49:14] us we ought to lose every power that we
[49:16] got and not just stand back and hold
[49:18] back everything that we've been
[49:20] garnering all these years if there ever
[49:22] was a time to stand up and preach the
[49:24] gospel of jesus christ it's this time if
[49:27] there ever was a time to testify of the
[49:30] god that saves it's this time if there
[49:32] ever was a time to testify there's a god
[49:35] that heals there's a god that delivers
[49:37] if there ever was a time we ought to
[49:40] just wake ourselves up to the fact that
[49:42] jesus christ ain't done with us
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:51] hallelujah
[49:52] [Applause]
[49:55] realize that satan is trying to stop the
[49:57] very purpose of god
[49:59] but do you realize to to think about
[50:01] that that satan is trying to stop the
[50:04] very purpose of god
[50:06] i believe that god's got a purpose to
[50:08] heal you he's got a purpose to fill you
[50:10] he's got a purpose to save you and we
[50:12] realize that satan has got a purpose to
[50:15] stop or try to defeat the very purpose
[50:18] of god but if he could do that he
[50:21] wouldn't be known as satan the prince of
[50:23] the power of the heir he would be known
[50:25] as satan the almighty
[50:27] you see he would be known as satan
[50:29] almighty but he can't stand here as the
[50:32] almighty god he can't stand here as the
[50:34] omnipotent god because there's one that
[50:37] already has claimed that title tonight
[50:40] his name ain't some weak name it's the
[50:42] most powerful name that's ever been
[50:44] named on the face of the earth
[50:47] you're not asleep to the fact to realize
[50:50] that you're serving a weak god you have
[50:52] awoken to realize that you are servant
[50:54] the mighty god he's you're serving el
[50:57] shaddai you're serving jehovah samuel
[51:00] the lord is there you're not serving a
[51:02] weak god that's pushed back in the
[51:04] corner by satan the prince of the power
[51:06] of the air your servant el shaddai
[51:10] elohim rock elohim the god that created
[51:14] you the god that sustained you
[51:19] i want to tell you tonight church the
[51:21] god that you're serving is not asleep
[51:24] but he's woke up and looking over you i
[51:26] say let god arise and let his enemies be
[51:29] scattered
[51:36] hallelujah he's the god that created the
[51:38] stars he's the god that created the
[51:41] molecules he's the god that created you
[51:48] all blessed be the name of the lord most
[51:51] high
[51:56] isn't he wonderful
[52:01] isn't he wonderful
[52:08] now notice what
[52:10] what david said in psalms chapter 3
[52:14] he said i cried unto the lord
[52:18] with my voice and he heard me out of his
[52:20] holy hill
[52:22] he said i laid me down and slept but i
[52:24] awake
[52:25] for the lord has sustained me
[52:27] for i will not be afraid of ten
[52:29] thousands of people
[52:31] let them set themselves against me round
[52:33] about
[52:34] and to think that david was in a spot
[52:38] many like you're in a spot tonight
[52:41] that david was in a spot when every it
[52:44] seemed like every gun was turned on him
[52:47] where it seemed like every every every
[52:49] enemy was against him but david said i
[52:52] laid me down and i sleep and i slept and
[52:55] i awaken
[52:56] notice when he got up he was just as
[52:59] safe and secure
[53:00] as he was when he went to bed
[53:02] he had not been suddenly attacked by his
[53:04] foes he had not been crushed by his own
[53:07] anguish in his spirit he had been he had
[53:10] he had he had woke up to the same
[53:12] enjoyments of life that he went to sleep
[53:14] with
[53:15] and i'll say this man is not the maker
[53:18] of our destiny
[53:20] man is not the maker of your destiny so
[53:22] even satan himself that cannot be the
[53:25] crusher of our destiny he knows where
[53:28] you're at god knows what you're going
[53:30] through so satan cannot check make god
[53:34] and try to say that this is your last
[53:36] move
[53:37] you can't strip god of his omnipotence
[53:40] but we have been awakened to the
[53:42] knowledge that god is our sustainer that
[53:45] god is our protector that god is our
[53:47] deliverer
[53:49] i'm not i'm not asleep on this matter
[53:51] but i am awakened to the fact that he is
[53:54] my mighty conqueror
[53:56] i am awakened to the fact that he is he
[53:59] is the same yesterday today and forever
[54:03] i'm not asleep on this fact
[54:05] i realize he's the mighty angel so every
[54:08] devil in hell is not going to be able to
[54:10] lull me back to sleep
[54:13] with some man-made idea let me say this
[54:16] to you brother branham said that the
[54:18] mighty conqueror is here he said and
[54:20] when he's here doomed devils are on the
[54:22] run i'll say this to the church of the
[54:25] living god almighty god is here and
[54:29] doomed devils are still on the run and
[54:31] there will be running
[54:39] hallelujah
[54:44] we are awakened to the fact that we are
[54:47] the temple
[54:49] of the most high god for the bible said
[54:51] in first corinthians 6 and 19
[54:53] know you not that your body is the
[54:55] temple of the holy ghost
[54:57] which is in you which you have of god
[54:59] and you are not your own for you are
[55:01] bought with a price
[55:03] therefore glorify god in your body and
[55:06] in your spirit which are gods colossians
[55:08] 1 and 26 even the mystery which has been
[55:12] hid from ages and from generations but
[55:15] now was made manifest to his saints to
[55:17] whom
[55:18] god would make known what is the riches
[55:22] of the glory of this mystery amongst the
[55:25] gentiles which is christ in you
[55:28] the hope of glory
[55:29] you see god don't accept no fellowship
[55:32] outside of these words right here christ
[55:35] in you the hope of glory he doesn't
[55:37] accept the fellowship card he doesn't
[55:39] accept the denomination he doesn't
[55:41] accept the creed he doesn't accept
[55:43] anything else because it's dead and it's
[55:45] been pruned off but he does accept that
[55:48] christ is in you the hope of glory and
[55:51] that's what god is wanting to do like
[55:53] never before
[55:55] he wants you
[55:57] you're his tabernacle
[55:59] you're his dwelling place
[56:01] chicana simply means the dwelling place
[56:05] of god
[56:07] it is the physical manifestation
[56:10] of god
[56:12] and the tabernacle was the place
[56:15] that he came to dwell
[56:18] to realize tonight that he's willing to
[56:20] have the preeminences in you
[56:22] you realize that what he has spoken he
[56:25] is the god that created it and he is the
[56:27] god that said it was good so if he said
[56:30] it he will be that if he said let there
[56:32] be light there had to be light or he
[56:34] wasn't god
[56:35] so he's the god that performs the word
[56:38] and that's exactly what he's wanting to
[56:40] see his children acting like the father
[56:44] you see the reason why you can say that
[56:46] your body is the temple or your body is
[56:49] the tabernacle of the holy ghost is
[56:51] because the dynamics are there
[56:54] is that right it ain't just good enough
[56:56] just to have the mechanics it's not just
[56:58] good enough to sit there and know all
[57:00] the scriptures or know all the dates and
[57:02] know all the quotes but you gotta have
[57:04] the dynamic power of the holy ghost you
[57:07] can't separate one from the other but
[57:09] you cannot make this run you cannot make
[57:12] this message work without the dynamics
[57:15] of the holy ghost
[57:18] you realize that when you go to reading
[57:20] over genesis that there was a guy that
[57:22] was much like some of you he had the
[57:24] name of he was a he was a shyster he was
[57:27] a liar
[57:30] you know who i'm talking about don't you
[57:32] i'm talking about jerry oh wait a minute
[57:34] i'm talking about brother fred no i'm
[57:35] talking about jacob
[57:37] he was a shyster he was one that could
[57:40] pull something over on he'd pull it over
[57:42] on his brother he pulled it over on his
[57:44] father he'd pull the wall over his own
[57:46] father-in-law laban back there
[57:48] but you know when you find that in the
[57:50] bible that jacob was traveling in
[57:53] genesis 28 that you'll find that genesis
[57:56] that jacob was traveling from beersheba
[57:58] to her on and when he got over there the
[58:02] bible said that he found a place and he
[58:04] lifted off that he laid himself down to
[58:07] sleep now here i've never been in that
[58:09] country before but the bible declares to
[58:12] us that jacob made his pillow out of
[58:14] stones now i've not been over there they
[58:16] must have they must have the softest
[58:18] stones i ever that i've ever that i've
[58:20] ever that you ever could imagine
[58:23] but here jacob i can't imagine sleeping
[58:25] all night on the back of a rock
[58:30] but if you'll catch a spiritual
[58:32] revelation of it
[58:33] you'll find yourself sleeping on a stone
[58:37] but jacob is there and he's laying he's
[58:39] laying there and he goes to sleep and
[58:41] the lord visited him in a dream
[58:44] he visited him in a dream and there was
[58:47] a ladder that was hooked that was hooked
[58:49] on earth and it and they came and hooked
[58:51] on earth and there it was hooked in
[58:53] heaven and there was angels ascending
[58:56] and descending and the lord was at the
[58:59] top of that ladder
[59:01] and the lord spoke unto him jacob the
[59:03] land where you're laying i'm giving that
[59:06] to you
[59:06] i am the i am the lord your god of your
[59:09] father abraham and the god of isaac but
[59:11] i am also your god
[59:13] but the land where you're laying on is
[59:16] the land that i'm going to give unto you
[59:18] and when jacob woke up
[59:21] go and read it when jacob woke up he'd
[59:24] realize that he the bible said that he
[59:28] woke up out of his sleep and said surely
[59:30] the lord is in this place and i knew it
[59:33] not
[59:34] i'm afraid that too many times people
[59:36] are just like jacob
[59:38] and they are asleep on the fact that he
[59:40] is still here they have missed their
[59:42] recognizing of the day and the message
[59:45] that they're living in
[59:48] but jacob didn't just stay there in his
[59:50] slumber or in his sleep he woke up to
[59:53] the fact that jehovah was his portion
[59:58] he didn't stay there or forget what lord
[1:00:00] what the lord had dropped into his heart
[1:00:02] and visited him by a dream
[1:00:06] what did the bible tell us that jacob
[1:00:08] got up
[1:00:09] and he built an altar
[1:00:12] and if there ever was a time to rebuild
[1:00:15] your family altar
[1:00:21] if there ever was a time to have the
[1:00:22] fire fall from god from heaven again
[1:00:25] it's time again
[1:00:27] maybe you could be like maybe you could
[1:00:29] be like elijah when you're standing up
[1:00:32] there with the prophets of baal and said
[1:00:34] maybe your god's a dead god maybe he's
[1:00:36] out there on a fishing trip maybe he's
[1:00:38] out there asleep
[1:00:40] why don't you go wake him up but they
[1:00:42] never could wake up the god bell because
[1:00:45] he wasn't a living god
[1:00:47] but elijah said go ahead and put put
[1:00:51] water all over this fire put water all
[1:00:53] over this sacrifice and let the god that
[1:00:56] answers by fire let him be god what did
[1:01:00] elijah do he was rebuilding the altar
[1:01:04] oh if the fire is going over your altar
[1:01:07] you can't enter entertain some strange
[1:01:09] fire and entertain some cold form of
[1:01:12] religion it'll never get you nowhere he
[1:01:14] won't get you in a body change he won't
[1:01:16] get you in a rapture but if you can get
[1:01:19] the fire that was on the altar
[1:01:21] [Music]
[1:01:23] it won't go out
[1:01:31] hallelujah
[1:01:36] notice this is the place that he's
[1:01:37] resting in
[1:01:38] where jacob is resting in
[1:01:41] he's resting right here on this thought
[1:01:44] and the place that you're laying in
[1:01:47] jacob
[1:01:48] this is your land
[1:01:50] as far as you can search that way as far
[1:01:53] as you can run that way as far as you
[1:01:55] can go that way and as far as you can go
[1:01:57] that way that land is your land it's not
[1:02:01] just your land but it's your offspring
[1:02:03] after you
[1:02:05] you see what is god saying to you church
[1:02:07] where you're resting at in this message
[1:02:10] of the hour is your inheritance for the
[1:02:13] bible said in isaiah 28 that with a that
[1:02:16] with a stammering tongue and another
[1:02:18] tongue will i come and this will be the
[1:02:20] refreshing of the lord
[1:02:23] those that are weary can rest right here
[1:02:26] that the holy ghost is your only place
[1:02:28] of heaven a place of rest
[1:02:34] it's time that you wake up and realize
[1:02:36] that god is here
[1:02:38] what did he do he woke up and he built
[1:02:40] an altar and he said this
[1:02:42] is the house of god and this is the gate
[1:02:46] of heaven
[1:02:47] what was he saying this is the house of
[1:02:50] god's bread
[1:02:51] if you're ever going to get fed you got
[1:02:53] to go to bethel
[1:02:55] that's why the prophet would preach a
[1:02:56] powerful message on why little bethlehem
[1:03:00] why did the god of heaven come to a
[1:03:02] little bitty town that was so
[1:03:04] insignificant
[1:03:08] why'd he come to this little town
[1:03:10] because he was the bread
[1:03:13] of heaven
[1:03:15] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:03:17] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:03:21] mouth of god
[1:03:23] and any man that taketh away or added to
[1:03:26] him shall be receiving of the plagues
[1:03:29] that are laid here in the book you
[1:03:31] cannot have overcoming power and take
[1:03:33] away from the bread of life you'll never
[1:03:35] feed yourself on the on on this message
[1:03:38] you'll never feed your soul trying to
[1:03:40] feed your fire trying to feed your flesh
[1:03:45] but if you can feed upon bethel one time
[1:03:49] there was a reason why david long for
[1:03:51] that water there was a reason why jesus
[1:03:54] had to come to that little town because
[1:03:56] he was the bread
[1:03:58] of heaven
[1:04:03] what did jacob wake up to
[1:04:06] what he wake up to the fact that jehovah
[1:04:08] was his portion and that god was for him
[1:04:12] and for his seed
[1:04:13] that even though that even though jacob
[1:04:16] was hated and even though jacob was
[1:04:18] scorned by his family but because jacob
[1:04:21] loved the birthright
[1:04:24] god was saying i got a place for you
[1:04:28] and some of you been running from pillar
[1:04:30] to post trying to find your direction
[1:04:32] but god is saying i got a place for you
[1:04:35] this is the place of your rest it ain't
[1:04:38] in some man's ideas it ain't in some
[1:04:40] man's creeds but it is in the very word
[1:04:43] of god
[1:04:47] notice when when moses was given the
[1:04:49] instructions on the tabernacle in the
[1:04:51] wilderness you see the tabernacle it
[1:04:53] served as a place of worship for israel
[1:04:56] after god gave moses on mount sinai the
[1:04:58] commandments an ordinance he gave moses
[1:05:01] instructions to construct the tabernacle
[1:05:04] that this would be the place
[1:05:06] where god's presence would come as i
[1:05:09] said to shekinah the shekinah is the
[1:05:11] visible manifestation of the presence of
[1:05:14] god
[1:05:15] and that's what i'm i'm driving at
[1:05:17] tonight is that that we are awakened to
[1:05:19] the fact that his physical presence
[1:05:22] is here
[1:05:25] that's who you're feeding on
[1:05:27] that's the one that comes time after
[1:05:29] time and feeds your soul and ministers
[1:05:32] unto you and many many carnal people
[1:05:35] look around and think well that was just
[1:05:37] a man or that was just his doing but
[1:05:40] you'll wake up to the fact if our god
[1:05:42] ever gets ahold of you this is the
[1:05:45] lord's doing
[1:05:47] this is the lord's doing
[1:05:49] but notice
[1:05:50] on the outside on the outside of the
[1:05:53] tabernacle where it was surrounded by a
[1:05:55] white curtain that was known as the
[1:05:57] outer courts and out there in the outer
[1:05:59] courts was a brazen altar was the brazen
[1:06:02] lefer where the priests would wash and
[1:06:04] kill the sacrifice the tent itself was
[1:06:07] covered by by four separate coverings
[1:06:09] with with linen and them pure white
[1:06:12] goat's hair ram skin that was dyed red
[1:06:15] but the very top layer that jehovah
[1:06:18] would look on as he would come and
[1:06:21] condescend upon the tabernacle was that
[1:06:24] of badger skin
[1:06:26] which is the meanest animal
[1:06:28] which was one of the fiercest animals
[1:06:30] that there is
[1:06:33] notice that in that tent there was two
[1:06:36] rooms there was the outer eastern court
[1:06:38] which was known as the holy place and
[1:06:40] then the holy place there was furniture
[1:06:43] of the altar of incense there was a
[1:06:45] seven golden candlesticks and there was
[1:06:48] a table of the shoe bread where the
[1:06:51] priests would make it every sabbath
[1:06:53] there was a period there was a there was
[1:06:55] a layer for the 12 tribes
[1:06:58] for the 12 tribes and it had to be fresh
[1:07:01] every day or every sabbath it had to be
[1:07:04] made over
[1:07:05] but over on the inner western room was
[1:07:08] known as the holies of holish
[1:07:12] and to think that today
[1:07:14] that you're a triune being
[1:07:18] you're a triune being and how many times
[1:07:21] have you tried have you tried to please
[1:07:24] this outside
[1:07:26] how many times have you judged your
[1:07:28] christian walk by this outer court
[1:07:34] there's some days when this outer court
[1:07:36] don't look like don't look like a place
[1:07:38] of the tabernacle where shekinah is
[1:07:40] dwelling there's some days where it's
[1:07:43] raining on the outside there's some days
[1:07:45] when it seems like you can't ever get
[1:07:46] the fire lit there's some days out there
[1:07:49] when it seems like the sacrifice ain't
[1:07:51] copper cooperating with you they're
[1:07:53] trying to run away from you
[1:07:57] but there's some days when you move in
[1:07:59] to the to the to the inner room to the
[1:08:01] holy place but in there is the golden
[1:08:05] candlesticks if you stay in there in a
[1:08:08] spot of sanctification you'll stay there
[1:08:10] and get all smutty up
[1:08:14] i went one time there's a place in
[1:08:15] pennsylvania that's got a recreation of
[1:08:18] the tabernacle and wilderness and you
[1:08:20] walk into that outer court and you look
[1:08:22] at it and you see all the glory but you
[1:08:24] walk in you walk into the holy place
[1:08:27] into the first room they light the seven
[1:08:29] golden candlesticks and they burn the
[1:08:31] incense there you can't hardly stay
[1:08:34] there
[1:08:35] because of the smoke that is in the room
[1:08:41] you can't you can't hardly see what's on
[1:08:42] the other side of the room you can't
[1:08:44] hardly even see the furniture that is
[1:08:46] laying there because of the smoke that
[1:08:49] is in the room and if you stay in a spot
[1:08:51] of sanctification
[1:08:53] your life will become so smoked up that
[1:08:55] you can't see the purpose of going to
[1:08:57] church on saturday and going to church
[1:08:59] on sunday
[1:09:01] if you stay in a spot of sanctification
[1:09:03] you'll think playing tapes is okay and
[1:09:06] just live in any way any kind of way you
[1:09:08] want to
[1:09:09] if you stay in there in the inner courts
[1:09:12] if you stay out there you're going to
[1:09:13] have troubles
[1:09:16] storms are going to rise up and you'll
[1:09:17] think well
[1:09:18] god don't love me no more
[1:09:22] i can't see his presence anymore oh i
[1:09:25] remember i remember how it was when he
[1:09:27] first got a hold of my life but if you
[1:09:29] stay in a spot of sanctification you'll
[1:09:31] forget those days because your memory
[1:09:34] will get all foggy
[1:09:36] i think where in the world is my god at
[1:09:40] if god was really for me
[1:09:42] if god was really for me he'd move on
[1:09:44] this situation if god was really for me
[1:09:47] he would drive away this cancer out of
[1:09:49] brother ron's life or he'd drive the
[1:09:51] cancer out of sister erica's parker's
[1:09:52] life or this that one or the other
[1:09:54] that's dealing with certain things
[1:09:57] you see you're living in a spot where
[1:09:59] you can't see the purpose of god
[1:10:04] you watch somebody they're always up
[1:10:06] against it or they never can't figure
[1:10:08] out the way why's god a god got to do it
[1:10:10] this way or why has it got to come this
[1:10:12] way they never went far enough yet
[1:10:15] but if you can walk if you can walk just
[1:10:18] a little bit further
[1:10:20] don't stop
[1:10:22] don't stop in your experience in just
[1:10:24] the holy place move on a little bit
[1:10:26] further
[1:10:28] you see
[1:10:29] everything had to be in order
[1:10:31] and when you move over in into the
[1:10:34] holies of holies there was a curtain
[1:10:37] that was separating there was a curtain
[1:10:39] that was separating the holy place from
[1:10:41] the holies of holies and there was only
[1:10:43] one piece of furniture that was in that
[1:10:45] room
[1:10:47] and you think about all the materials
[1:10:49] where where moses is telling telling all
[1:10:51] these tribes you get this one from that
[1:10:53] one you go you build it according to
[1:10:55] this there's only one piece of furniture
[1:10:58] in there
[1:10:59] because god only wants your attention on
[1:11:01] him
[1:11:03] he don't want your attention on what the
[1:11:05] world's going he don't want your
[1:11:06] attention on what russia's doing he
[1:11:08] don't want your attention on what
[1:11:09] biden's doing he's wanting your
[1:11:11] attention solely on him
[1:11:16] in there was only one piece which was
[1:11:19] the ark of the covenant but on the
[1:11:21] inside of that ark of the covenant
[1:11:23] what's the two tables or stones that
[1:11:26] held the commandments of almighty god on
[1:11:28] the inside of that ark of the covenant
[1:11:30] was the golden pot full that was full of
[1:11:33] the manna that rained down and every
[1:11:35] priest that would come into there and
[1:11:37] was able to partake of the original
[1:11:40] manna that fell down on the very first
[1:11:42] day
[1:11:44] oh i want to preach to you right there
[1:11:46] every person sitting here has the
[1:11:48] ability to feast on the original manna
[1:11:51] that fell down on the day of pentecost
[1:11:54] it's the same as it was 2 000 years ago
[1:11:57] it don't get old in there it don't get
[1:12:00] rotten in there it don't give wiggle
[1:12:02] tails in there
[1:12:04] because it's housing the shekinah glory
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:12] we say brother andrew
[1:12:13] [Applause]
[1:12:15] there's no way that i could ever live
[1:12:18] this kind of message
[1:12:22] there's no way that i could ever beat to
[1:12:24] a prophet's drum like that
[1:12:27] my life if you could take a look at my
[1:12:29] life
[1:12:30] it ain't nothing
[1:12:32] i've been so dried up i look like a
[1:12:34] cactus all you needs a little bit of
[1:12:35] water
[1:12:39] i'll tell you what if god ever gets a
[1:12:40] hold of your life you'll be amazed at
[1:12:43] what you do in this world you'll be
[1:12:45] amazed how you act they put aaron's rod
[1:12:48] that was nothing but a dry old stick
[1:12:50] they put it in that ark of the covenant
[1:12:52] and when the kind of glory would come
[1:12:54] down it blossomed exactly like it was in
[1:12:57] the very beginning and yo you may be
[1:13:00] we'll know you may be dark you may have
[1:13:02] sinned stacked up against your life you
[1:13:04] think there's no way you let the
[1:13:06] shekinah come over your life
[1:13:09] and you'll show exactly what you were to
[1:13:11] show in the very beginning because he is
[1:13:14] the life
[1:13:25] that was only allowed you can go back
[1:13:26] and study the scriptures through
[1:13:27] leviticus
[1:13:29] powerful studies
[1:13:30] but the high priest and you know these
[1:13:32] things that i'm i'm going through these
[1:13:33] things again for a purpose
[1:13:36] but the high priest is only allowed to
[1:13:37] go in there one time a year
[1:13:41] and you get the joy of coming into it
[1:13:43] day after day after day after day
[1:13:47] [Applause]
[1:13:49] we said well i don't know about that if
[1:13:51] you're god's tabernacle do you realize
[1:13:53] brother branham said that god goes to
[1:13:55] church every day
[1:13:58] and you can't hardly show up once
[1:14:00] a month
[1:14:01] but god if god is your tabernacle
[1:14:04] if you are the tabernacle of almighty
[1:14:06] god brother the brother random said that
[1:14:09] god goes to church every day he's living
[1:14:11] in you and expressing out of you his
[1:14:14] godhead deity showing again that god is
[1:14:17] alive living in this mortal flesh
[1:14:21] [Applause]
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:24] this high priest
[1:14:26] you know the stories you know the
[1:14:27] scriptures he had to be dressed right he
[1:14:29] had the head to oil dripping off of him
[1:14:31] he had to have the blood that was
[1:14:33] touched on his ear touched on his hand
[1:14:35] and touched on his foot showing that
[1:14:37] when you walk into the presence of
[1:14:39] almighty god you've got to hear through
[1:14:41] the blood you've got to do actions
[1:14:43] through the blood and you've got to walk
[1:14:45] with the blood
[1:14:47] and he's walking he's walking and he's
[1:14:50] got his priestly garments on he's
[1:14:52] carrying the ephod on his shoulders with
[1:14:54] two onyx stones and when he's walking in
[1:14:56] there on those arnic stones is the name
[1:14:59] of the tribes of the children of israel
[1:15:02] so when the high priest is walking in
[1:15:04] there he's not walking in there alone
[1:15:07] he's walking in there with your name on
[1:15:10] it and the bible said he is the high
[1:15:12] priest of our confession
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:20] he's walking in
[1:15:23] he don't just stay out there
[1:15:25] where it's raining
[1:15:28] when there's troubles on every side when
[1:15:30] there's wars and there's rumors of wars
[1:15:33] he don't just stay out there he moves
[1:15:34] into the holy place
[1:15:37] beard is dripping with oil
[1:15:41] he's dressed right
[1:15:42] and he walks
[1:15:44] once a year
[1:15:46] once a year walks into this place
[1:15:48] and on the bottom of his priestly
[1:15:50] garments there's pomegranates and
[1:15:53] there's bells
[1:15:55] that are ringing out holy holy holy is
[1:15:58] the lord
[1:16:00] i think if a bail on a pomegranate could
[1:16:02] do it
[1:16:07] if a priest garment could do it
[1:16:10] what the children of god be able to do
[1:16:15] he walks in there
[1:16:17] he walks in there
[1:16:19] notice the noise wasn't only for god but
[1:16:22] the noise was for the other people too
[1:16:26] because that was the only sign that the
[1:16:29] priest was still alive
[1:16:31] you say well i don't want to bless god
[1:16:33] you say i don't want to praise god i
[1:16:35] don't want to worship god i'm going to
[1:16:38] because i'm going to let the outside
[1:16:40] world know that there is a living god
[1:16:43] and i'm still living in his presence i'm
[1:16:45] still shaking and blessing his holy name
[1:16:48] in his presence
[1:16:52] he said well i'm not going to do it
[1:16:54] there's going to be somebody that'll be
[1:16:56] a king and priest that'll walk into the
[1:16:58] shekinah glory and know a player walking
[1:17:01] right dressing right living right
[1:17:04] praising his name right
[1:17:12] well if you study his message out
[1:17:14] you'll find that brother branham said he
[1:17:17] says in a way that that room was a
[1:17:19] soundproof room
[1:17:22] he said it was built in such a way that
[1:17:25] you couldn't pay attention to the lines
[1:17:27] on the outside and if there ever was a
[1:17:29] time to shut up the critics and shut up
[1:17:31] the people making fun of you and shut up
[1:17:34] the people that are saying things about
[1:17:35] you and saying things about your pastor
[1:17:37] and saying things about this message if
[1:17:40] there ever was a time to drowned out the
[1:17:42] outside world and come into a room and
[1:17:45] not pay no attention to whatever
[1:17:47] endeavor in hell is trying to do against
[1:17:50] this church and do it against this
[1:17:51] message you ought to let your bells and
[1:17:54] your pomegranates bring out one more
[1:17:56] time holy holy holy
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:02] you get one time in his presence and
[1:18:04] you'll not pay attention to the
[1:18:06] naysayers you'll not pay attention to
[1:18:08] satan you'll not pay attention to his
[1:18:10] demons
[1:18:14] come with me i'm going over jesus
[1:18:27] that little tent
[1:18:29] is where god tabernacled
[1:18:34] that little place
[1:18:35] could you imagine
[1:18:38] as an onlooker coming over the hill
[1:18:42] looking over and saying
[1:18:45] what's that going on down there
[1:18:48] i'm gonna tell you what
[1:18:50] it takes a big place to put two million
[1:18:52] people at
[1:18:54] but could you imagine brother tyler
[1:18:57] coming over and looking over that hill
[1:18:59] and somebody said what in the world is
[1:19:01] going on
[1:19:03] what's what's
[1:19:04] why are those people camping out
[1:19:07] this ain't no time for camping
[1:19:09] it's a time to be moving
[1:19:11] and somebody said well you don't know
[1:19:12] what they're doing
[1:19:14] you see
[1:19:15] that tent there
[1:19:16] they're
[1:19:20] you're not gonna believe this
[1:19:23] but there's a prophet that got
[1:19:25] instructions
[1:19:26] on how to build this body
[1:19:34] i know you're not gonna believe this but
[1:19:35] that's where
[1:19:37] what's that dinky looking tent out there
[1:19:40] and it's covered around by them curtains
[1:19:42] what are they so scared about
[1:19:45] you don't realize
[1:19:47] but that's where our god lives
[1:19:54] you got to be kidding me
[1:19:57] that's where your god lives that we
[1:19:59] carry our god around
[1:20:01] oh brother we don't have to carry our
[1:20:03] god he carries us
[1:20:09] he in and out on him an image
[1:20:11] but he's made us an image
[1:20:13] [Applause]
[1:20:16] and he wants your tent
[1:20:19] and you think
[1:20:20] what in the world's god doing inside of
[1:20:23] that little girl
[1:20:25] that's where god's living at
[1:20:27] and the rest of the world said why is
[1:20:29] she acting like that this the shekinah
[1:20:31] came down
[1:20:32] and the shekinah began to bless and the
[1:20:35] shekinah began to pour out
[1:20:37] she couldn't contain herself you mean to
[1:20:40] tell me that's where your god lives at
[1:20:42] absolutely
[1:20:44] you mean to tell me that he lives under
[1:20:47] the fifth rib of your heart that he
[1:20:48] wants to dwell there absolutely
[1:20:52] but you don't know him like i know him
[1:20:55] you don't know him like i know him let
[1:20:57] me tell you the first thing that god
[1:20:59] seen when it came down was nothing but
[1:21:01] an old badger skin
[1:21:03] [Laughter]
[1:21:05] some of the meanest people i ever knew
[1:21:07] in my life sitting in this message
[1:21:11] they ain't known as an old badger no
[1:21:13] more
[1:21:16] i'm gonna tell you right now you don't
[1:21:18] want to mess with us the way we are but
[1:21:19] you definitely didn't want to mess with
[1:21:21] us when we had that old stinking nature
[1:21:23] on us
[1:21:31] what was it it was a veil
[1:21:34] and it was hiding to the outside world
[1:21:37] almighty god
[1:21:39] and when they came in hebrews or john
[1:21:42] chapter 12 and and those and those
[1:21:44] greeks they desired to see god and they
[1:21:46] were looking at him
[1:21:47] but they couldn't see him because of the
[1:21:49] veil
[1:21:50] and they can't see him today because of
[1:21:52] the veil and they get confused and say
[1:21:55] that ain't nothing but an old badger
[1:21:56] skin it used to be on an animal
[1:21:59] but that is a place where god's wanting
[1:22:01] to dwell there's a lot of people that
[1:22:03] look on it today and said ain't nothing
[1:22:05] but a bunch of holy rollers but that's
[1:22:07] where god lives at
[1:22:09] [Applause]
[1:22:11] let me tell you you ever get good and
[1:22:13] woke up one time
[1:22:14] man you sleeping good
[1:22:17] you sleeping a night away you don't took
[1:22:18] 15 melatonin to get that way and baby
[1:22:21] you're rocking out some logs
[1:22:26] but all of a sudden your wife hears a
[1:22:28] knock or she here thinks she hears a
[1:22:30] knock
[1:22:33] oh hell ain't gonna keep you asleep
[1:22:36] you wake up and grab a baseball bat say
[1:22:38] hey wait a minute let me grab my glasses
[1:22:40] i can't even see who i'm swinging at
[1:22:45] i know i heard something honey
[1:22:47] i had that never that's never happened
[1:22:49] to me i'm just going by another story
[1:22:52] about somebody else
[1:22:55] did you hear that
[1:22:57] must be them bears again
[1:22:59] but you you
[1:23:01] you never get good and woke up like that
[1:23:02] you ain't going back sleep
[1:23:04] ain't something pumping on the inside of
[1:23:06] you
[1:23:09] you can take nyquil you can take zeke
[1:23:11] wheel you can take all kinds of benadryl
[1:23:14] but you're not gonna put that thing back
[1:23:15] to sleep
[1:23:18] you might as well go ahead and study the
[1:23:20] seventh seal because you woke up
[1:23:25] you can't put that thing back to sleep
[1:23:28] that body's jacked up because somebody
[1:23:31] has woke you up
[1:23:34] let me say this to you
[1:23:35] the reason why you catch this message is
[1:23:38] because it was seven thunders back there
[1:23:42] that woke this bride up
[1:23:44] and there's no way that no cold creed
[1:23:46] dogma will ever put this bride back to
[1:23:49] sleep we've been woke up shook up and
[1:23:52] there's something pumping on the inside
[1:23:54] of this body
[1:23:56] i'm waking to the fact that the shekinah
[1:23:58] wants this body that doesn't kind of
[1:24:00] wants to live here that she kind of
[1:24:02] wants to pour out
[1:24:07] it's the greatest place to rest at but
[1:24:09] it's the greatest fact to wake up to
[1:24:11] that is the same yesterday today and
[1:24:14] forever
[1:24:27] that was a type
[1:24:29] the tabernacle was a type
[1:24:31] of christ coming to dwell in you
[1:24:34] he said well there's no way i can live
[1:24:36] this but i want to tell you he's your
[1:24:38] waymaker
[1:24:39] because the bible said in hebrews 9 11
[1:24:41] but christ being come a high priest of
[1:24:43] good things to come
[1:24:45] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[1:24:48] not made with hands that is to say not
[1:24:49] of this building neither by the blood of
[1:24:52] goats and of calves but by his own blood
[1:24:54] he entered in once into the holy place
[1:24:56] having obtained eternal redemption for
[1:24:58] us for if the blood of bulls and goats
[1:25:00] and ashes of a heifer sprinkling the
[1:25:02] unclean sanctified to the purifying of
[1:25:06] the flesh
[1:25:07] and we i i absolutely love studying on
[1:25:09] the tabernacle of the wilderness but
[1:25:11] hegei chapter 2 tells us that the glory
[1:25:15] of the former will be greater than the
[1:25:17] glory of the former
[1:25:19] and to think that tonight that as great
[1:25:22] as the tabernacle of the wilderness was
[1:25:24] to think about the tabernacle of the man
[1:25:26] jesus christ
[1:25:30] they ain't never been a man like this
[1:25:31] man there's never been anybody walking
[1:25:34] shoe leather like this one
[1:25:36] there's never been anybody that could
[1:25:38] lay hands on a sick like this one
[1:25:42] so you you ask you ask this question
[1:25:44] who's the one that's doing the work
[1:25:46] amongst us it's got to be the one in
[1:25:48] this tabernacle again
[1:25:52] now notice notice but dwight moody said
[1:25:55] this
[1:25:56] he said the moment that moses finished
[1:25:58] the work the moment
[1:25:59] the moment that he finished the work the
[1:26:01] moment that the tabernacle was ready the
[1:26:03] cloud came down the shekinah glory came
[1:26:06] and filled it so that moses was not able
[1:26:09] to stand before the presence of the lord
[1:26:11] and dwight moody said i believe firmly
[1:26:14] that the moment that our hearts are
[1:26:16] empty to pride
[1:26:17] selfishness and ambition and
[1:26:19] self-seeking and everything that's
[1:26:20] contrary to god's law the holy ghost
[1:26:23] will come and fill every corner of our
[1:26:25] hearts
[1:26:26] but if we are full of pride and conceit
[1:26:29] and ambition and self-seeking pleasures
[1:26:31] in the world
[1:26:32] there's no room for the spirit of god
[1:26:36] i believe many a man's praying to god to
[1:26:37] fill him when he's already full
[1:26:40] of something else he said but before we
[1:26:43] pray that god would fill us he said i
[1:26:45] believe we ought to pray
[1:26:47] that he empty us
[1:26:53] i believe that cs lewis said god can't
[1:26:55] feel you if you're full of yourself
[1:26:58] but this
[1:26:59] is the human flesh that deities want to
[1:27:01] dwell in again
[1:27:04] to think this is a tabernacle where god
[1:27:08] wants to dwell he wants your tent
[1:27:10] he wants your 16 elements
[1:27:12] he wants your heart
[1:27:15] he don't need your money
[1:27:17] he don't need your stinking attitude
[1:27:21] he don't need your abilities
[1:27:23] he just wants your heart
[1:27:26] sampson gave everything away
[1:27:29] he gave his power to god he gave his
[1:27:31] strength to god but he gave delilah his
[1:27:34] heart
[1:27:36] if he would have simply gave god his
[1:27:38] heart they never could have been able to
[1:27:40] whip him
[1:27:45] and if they sisters if you sisters ever
[1:27:47] allow the enemy come to take your
[1:27:49] nazarite vow away from you
[1:27:56] let me move on
[1:28:00] the veil
[1:28:02] the veil hid
[1:28:04] to the outside world
[1:28:07] what was laying there
[1:28:09] you see there's where god dwells at is
[1:28:11] in his church
[1:28:14] that's laid up
[1:28:16] in accordance to his word
[1:28:18] and the bible tells us that god
[1:28:21] is dwelling in earthen vessels
[1:28:24] and paul would say that we have this
[1:28:25] treasure
[1:28:27] in earthen vessels
[1:28:30] that the excellency of the power may be
[1:28:32] of god
[1:28:33] and not of us
[1:28:36] to think about what a power that you
[1:28:38] have
[1:28:39] that you have this treasure in earth and
[1:28:41] vessels
[1:28:45] what i love about i absolutely love that
[1:28:48] scripture second corinthians 4 7 that
[1:28:51] that we have this treasure
[1:28:53] it's the greatest treasure you'll ever
[1:28:55] find young people
[1:28:56] it ain't gold and ain't silver
[1:29:00] jesus said put your treasure up where
[1:29:02] man can't steal it and rust can't
[1:29:03] corrupt it
[1:29:05] but we have this treasure in earthen
[1:29:07] vessels
[1:29:09] that the power the excellence should be
[1:29:11] a power of god and not of ourselves
[1:29:15] how many believe that
[1:29:17] how many believe that you have this
[1:29:18] treasure in earth and vessels
[1:29:23] so when you go through some stuff
[1:29:25] are you able to say we have this
[1:29:26] treasure
[1:29:28] because paul said that we are troubled
[1:29:30] on every side yet not distressed we are
[1:29:33] perplexed but not in despair we're
[1:29:36] persecuted but not forsaken we're cast
[1:29:39] down but not destroyed but we're always
[1:29:41] bearing about in the body the dying of
[1:29:44] the lord jesus that the life also of
[1:29:46] jesus might be made manifest in our
[1:29:51] glory to god
[1:29:53] to think that tonight that you have a
[1:29:55] part of almighty god living on the
[1:29:58] inside of you
[1:30:00] you remember brother branham talking
[1:30:01] about that chinese laundromat how we
[1:30:03] would come over here he said it was a
[1:30:05] great contract that they had he said
[1:30:06] even better than what we've got today he
[1:30:08] said because man can forge statements
[1:30:10] that they write out on letters he said
[1:30:12] those men they'd come over here and
[1:30:14] they'd take that piece of paper and
[1:30:17] before you could you take your dirty
[1:30:18] clothes in there and before you could
[1:30:20] get them back the ticket had to match up
[1:30:24] so they would rip it and when you come
[1:30:26] in there if you didn't have the right
[1:30:28] parts you couldn't get your clothes back
[1:30:31] but if you had the right part you get
[1:30:33] your dirty clothes back clean again
[1:30:35] and he said up there on galgotha
[1:30:39] he said god tore his only son apart
[1:30:43] he said but he sent down his son he sent
[1:30:46] down his spirit to live in you he said
[1:30:49] and now we're watching the two parts of
[1:30:51] the contract come back together
[1:30:54] he said jehovah of the old testament was
[1:30:57] jesus christ of the new and he matched
[1:30:59] every old prophecy that was laying there
[1:31:02] and he said everything within me is
[1:31:04] testifying that this message of the hour
[1:31:07] matches everything
[1:31:11] you realize tonight that you've got a
[1:31:13] part of heaven living on the inside of
[1:31:16] you
[1:31:19] i got the message of the hour
[1:31:22] in me
[1:31:25] it ain't on the outside it ain't on
[1:31:27] tapes and books
[1:31:29] god wants your heart
[1:31:33] see we're not living under we're not
[1:31:35] living under the light of luther's day
[1:31:37] or wesley's day we're living under the
[1:31:39] light not even the light of a pentecost
[1:31:41] day we are living under bride time
[1:31:45] and when jesus was standing there he
[1:31:48] told them he said in vain do you worship
[1:31:51] me
[1:31:52] if you're going to worship god you've
[1:31:53] got to worship him in spirit and in
[1:31:56] truth true worship comes from the heart
[1:32:00] true worship is a giving is a giving
[1:32:02] worship expecting nothing in return
[1:32:07] it is more blessed to give than it is to
[1:32:10] receive
[1:32:12] but too many people got their hands out
[1:32:14] today wanting to receive without giving
[1:32:16] anything
[1:32:17] but gee let me move on jesus said that
[1:32:20] in vain do you worship me teaching for
[1:32:23] doctrines the traditions of men and he
[1:32:26] said by that you've made the word of god
[1:32:28] no effect he said so if i come to
[1:32:30] preaching to you a methodist message he
[1:32:33] said it won't have no effect on you he
[1:32:35] said because this is bride time he said
[1:32:38] but if there's a predestinated seed that
[1:32:40] has come to this moment it's got to be
[1:32:42] watered with the same with the same
[1:32:45] water that is under the anointing that
[1:32:47] it's in
[1:32:48] so you can't water this message seed
[1:32:51] with some cold baptist idea
[1:32:57] you can't separate you can't separate
[1:33:00] the word and the spirit because they're
[1:33:02] one
[1:33:04] and neither can you separate us from the
[1:33:06] message because we are a part of the
[1:33:09] message
[1:33:11] let me move on i'm going to drop a few
[1:33:13] quotes right here he said the shekinah
[1:33:16] he said it ripens a showbread that we
[1:33:18] feast on and drive across the country
[1:33:20] for hundreds of miles he said it's the
[1:33:23] believer's food it's only for a believer
[1:33:26] remember the show bread was only for
[1:33:27] believers only the shoe bread seed he
[1:33:30] said what does it do that's the kind of
[1:33:32] glory over the shoe bread keeps it from
[1:33:36] spoiling
[1:33:37] again he said what's this economy this
[1:33:39] kind of glory today he said it's to
[1:33:41] break beyond the veil to see who god is
[1:33:44] standing before you the pillar of fire
[1:33:47] he is veiled in human flesh but what
[1:33:50] does this kind of what does the shekinah
[1:33:52] what did it do he said the showbread
[1:33:55] seed the word that we're to live in this
[1:33:57] day
[1:33:58] by these promises the shekinah glory
[1:34:01] ripens that shoe bread and brings it to
[1:34:03] pass and makes it bread to the believer
[1:34:06] that laid there in the pages of the
[1:34:08] bible year after year the word for this
[1:34:11] age
[1:34:12] so if he said it
[1:34:15] i believe it
[1:34:16] so if he said it it's got to come to
[1:34:19] pass
[1:34:20] he said he would come and his promises
[1:34:22] is equal to his presence
[1:34:26] again he said but what does it do in
[1:34:28] this last day what is it to reveal to
[1:34:30] bring forth what malachi 4 to do it's to
[1:34:34] turn back the people
[1:34:36] from the stump from that stumbling block
[1:34:38] to break down the traditions and reveal
[1:34:41] the bread with the sakana glory watch it
[1:34:44] ripen and produce just exactly what it
[1:34:48] said it would do
[1:34:49] the shoe bread
[1:34:51] of this h
[1:34:53] so you can take this message and you can
[1:34:55] stick it out on your own island
[1:34:57] but without the shekinah it'll never
[1:34:59] work
[1:35:01] and there's men that try to push it off
[1:35:03] and say you can do this or if you follow
[1:35:05] this
[1:35:11] well i'm just going to stay home i'm
[1:35:13] just going to do it this way or i'm
[1:35:14] going to do it that way it'll never
[1:35:16] produce john 14 and 12.
[1:35:19] but if you fall in line with the shoe
[1:35:22] brand of this day and it's only for
[1:35:24] believers you'll never be able to eat on
[1:35:26] the unfailing body of the word if you're
[1:35:28] an unbeliever but if you're in line with
[1:35:31] the word
[1:35:33] that shoe bread and the shekinah glory
[1:35:35] meeting up together will produce the
[1:35:37] same works that jesus did
[1:35:41] it'll produce the same faith that jesus
[1:35:43] had it'll produce the same works because
[1:35:46] you are a believer
[1:35:48] and you may not be able to figure out
[1:35:50] how in the world i can do that how in
[1:35:52] the world i can lay hands on a sick how
[1:35:53] in the world can brother joseph get
[1:35:55] better how in the world can this one
[1:35:57] overcome this one and how can this one
[1:35:59] overcome this sickness
[1:36:01] but the shekinah coming behind the
[1:36:03] message will make it work out exactly
[1:36:06] what he said there
[1:36:08] you see you're not alone but you're
[1:36:10] walking into an atmosphere where the
[1:36:13] presence of the lord is
[1:36:17] you're not
[1:36:18] the shekinah cannot be separated
[1:36:21] the dynamics will not come to a
[1:36:22] tabernacle that's not feeding on the
[1:36:25] mechanics
[1:36:29] notice he said you get the people in the
[1:36:31] right kind of atmosphere
[1:36:33] and all kinds of things will happen
[1:36:35] you see if you're out there in the outer
[1:36:37] courts nothing's going to happen for you
[1:36:39] if you're out there in sanctification it
[1:36:41] may you may get a glimpse of it the
[1:36:43] curtain may open just a little bit but
[1:36:45] you've not went on far enough he said
[1:36:47] but it takes the atmosphere it takes the
[1:36:50] atmosphere of the people to create the
[1:36:53] miracles
[1:36:55] i got one quote
[1:36:57] that i i got to drop to you
[1:36:59] and then i'm gonna then i'm gonna

[1:39:31] man of fresh all the time where your
[1:39:33] neighbor treats you right or not you
[1:39:35] love them anyhow
[1:39:36] that's the kind of attitude that you
[1:39:39] gotta have to make the word of god come
[1:39:42] to pass
[1:39:42] [Applause]
[1:39:45] i i enjoy
[1:39:47] let me just drop this and this is free
[1:39:49] this is for me
[1:39:51] maybe not for anybody else but i
[1:39:53] i enjoy i enjoy revivals we're coming up
[1:39:55] on a revival we've got brother wayne
[1:39:56] lawson coming here in a couple of weeks
[1:39:58] we're looking for a great time invite
[1:39:59] your friends invite your neighbors
[1:40:01] invite your enemies
[1:40:02] it works
[1:40:04] i enjoy these meetings and i enjoy i
[1:40:07] enjoy going to these camps i enjoy going
[1:40:09] to this great these great meetings and
[1:40:11] watching the power of god come down
[1:40:15] i'm preaching these things i'm going to
[1:40:17] these things because i want to see one
[1:40:19] soul saved
[1:40:20] but everybody loves riding the ways of
[1:40:23] the holy ghost and they're living and
[1:40:25] you watch so many times today
[1:40:28] young people running from this camp to
[1:40:30] that camp and i'm formed on
[1:40:33] but you ought to be able to bring
[1:40:34] something back home
[1:40:37] some people are only living during
[1:40:39] spring and summertime when all the camps
[1:40:42] are really going on
[1:40:44] and they go two weeks without a camp and
[1:40:46] man god's not for them and god's against
[1:40:49] them
[1:40:50] what they got is the missed meal cramps
[1:40:53] and they're just feeding off of the
[1:40:55] atmosphere of a meeting
[1:40:58] but i happen to believe we're blessed
[1:40:59] people here tonight
[1:41:01] and we feel like we've got convention
[1:41:03] atmosphere
[1:41:04] weekend after weekend night after night
[1:41:07] i believe if you ain't get something
[1:41:09] from your church this is going out over
[1:41:11] the internet and if you ain't getting
[1:41:13] something from your pastor you're
[1:41:15] probably not putting nothing in
[1:41:18] but if you can get an atmosphere and
[1:41:20] create an atmosphere where the holy
[1:41:22] ghost is welcome
[1:41:24] you'll watch the spirit of the living
[1:41:26] god come like never before
[1:41:30] will you say my pastor don't preach like
[1:41:33] brother ron or my pastor don't preach
[1:41:35] like brother wayne do you made man
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:40] i ain't preaching this to you because
[1:41:41] y'all are the
[1:41:43] y'all my church so i'm gonna say this
[1:41:45] y'all the best day manners there isn't a
[1:41:46] message
[1:41:48] if you want to beat that when i'm going
[1:41:49] somewhere go ahead and try
[1:41:56] but you say well my pastor don't preach
[1:41:57] like that or my my church don't teach
[1:41:59] like that or preach like that why don't
[1:42:01] you start worshiping and why don't you
[1:42:04] start praising god like you're at a
[1:42:06] convention every weekend every service
[1:42:09] and you'll watch an atmosphere created
[1:42:11] where the miraculous can take place
[1:42:14] i tell you when you create an atmosphere
[1:42:16] like this that you feel right now this
[1:42:19] is the kind of atmosphere that eagles
[1:42:21] are born in
[1:42:22] this is the kind of atmosphere that
[1:42:24] cancer get cast out in
[1:42:27] this is the kind of atmosphere that
[1:42:29] young people get filled with the baptism
[1:42:32] of the holy ghost
[1:42:35] i'm awakened to the fact that god still
[1:42:38] god and his enemies are liars
[1:42:40] i'm awakened to the fact
[1:42:42] [Applause]

[1:46:38] eye he thought you were worth going in
[1:46:41] front of everybody
[1:46:43] and the bible said there was one that
[1:46:45] was closer of kin
[1:46:47] than that of boaz

[1:46:54] his own inheritance
[1:46:57] he said
[1:46:58] if you if you redeem naomi you got to
[1:47:01] take ruth
[1:47:03] and he wasn't willing to marry his
[1:47:04] testimony
[1:47:06] but god was willing to step out into the
[1:47:09] public eye
[1:47:10] and kick his shoe off
[1:47:12] and make a public testimony that i am a
[1:47:15] mighty man of wealth

[1:47:35] twinkling of an eye between the hours of
[1:47:38] six and nine i woke up to the fact
[1:47:44] oh it's a body change for the body of

[1:48:48] bless him all my days
[1:48:53] i woke up to the fact that every devil
[1:48:56] in hell has got his guns trained against
[1:48:58] us
[1:48:59] but i can't go back to sleep and think
[1:49:01] that we ain't got enough power to shut
[1:49:02] them up

[1:49:11] i got to quit
[1:49:12] preaching you ain't gonna put me back to

[1:49:30] i woke up to the fact that i can't go
[1:49:32] back to sleep brother matthew

[1:49:37] there on the streets of canada he can
[1:49:39] meet you in a church building i can't go
[1:49:42] to sleep on this fact
[1:49:46] arise thou that sleepless
[1:49:51] god wants your tent
[1:49:54] he's wanting to wake you up
[1:49:56] to the knowledge
[1:50:00] the deity's dwelling in you
[1:50:06] i know it's a hard fact
[1:50:07] to admit sometimes where the jerry
[1:50:13] but that's a tabernacle
[1:50:15] man
[1:50:18] i'm sure she can upset you sometimes
[1:50:22] but little rebecca's the tabernacle of
[1:50:24] almighty god
[1:50:28] it's hard
[1:50:30] it's hard
[1:50:31] it's hard to wake up and look over by a
[1:50:33] chainsaw
[1:50:35] snoring in the bed beside you
[1:50:36] and see god living in them
[1:50:40] let me go back to sleep on that fact
[1:50:45] but i can't be put back to sleep
[1:50:50] and think that that little girl right
[1:50:51] there
[1:51:16] you may go through some stuff
[1:51:20] i want you to know this
[1:51:22] that if god is your
[1:51:24] your everything
[1:51:25] [Music]
[1:51:27] your loved ones can walk away from me
[1:51:29] your friends can mock you make fun of
[1:51:31] you
[1:51:34] but if you ever get woke up
[1:51:37] it doesn't matter what the critics say
[1:51:38] about you doesn't matter what your
[1:51:40] family says about you it doesn't matter
[1:51:41] the storms that surround you
[1:51:44] you'll never go back to sleep because
[1:51:46] you've been awoken to the fact that the
[1:51:48] shekinah
[1:51:50] is living
[1:51:52] i'm thankful to know
[1:51:54] that it ain't just in one man
[1:51:57] but i'm thankful to know that god's got
[1:51:59] some tabernacles
[1:52:00] like stephen and chris short
[1:52:03] that when i'm in trouble that i can ask
[1:52:05] my brothers to pray for me
[1:52:07] the god's living in a person by the name
[1:52:10] of jordan martin that when i'm in
[1:52:11] trouble i can i can call on him and
[1:52:14] he'll go to prayer for me i can't go
[1:52:17] back to sleep on the fact that god has
[1:52:19] still got some prayer warriors
[1:52:22] that's willing to press through the pain
[1:52:24] of living on their knees all night long
[1:52:26] and calling out to god
[1:52:35] young people i want you to know this
[1:52:38] there's a whole lot of things that are
[1:52:40] going on out there in the world but
[1:52:41] don't get your eyes on it
[1:52:43] get your eyes on jesus christ
[1:52:46] and keep your eyes on him
[1:52:48] for he will be everything to you
[1:52:50] when you don't know where he'll be your
[1:52:52] way when you can't make a way he'll make
[1:52:54] a way he said i am the way i am the
[1:52:57] truth and i am the life
[1:52:59] and whenever devil's got his gun pointed
[1:53:02] on you you'll be all right
[1:53:05] you'll stand there that's the time
[1:53:06] you'll stand right there because god is
[1:53:08] here
[1:53:11] let me tell you my little girls if they
[1:53:13] get the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:53:15] they're sensitive to the holy spirit
[1:53:17] they're sensitive to the moving of the
[1:53:18] angel
[1:53:21] but if they ever get him
[1:53:25] i'm not worried about what comes in life
[1:53:28] parents
[1:53:29] it's time you turn your focus off of
[1:53:31] everything that's going on
[1:53:33] in the natural and turn it to the
[1:53:35] spiritual
[1:53:37] do you woke up to the fact
[1:53:39] that the shekinah wants to live in you

[2:08:50] filthy garments
[2:08:53] she walked around from house in the
[2:08:54] house and
[2:08:56] would ask for bread here or ask for a
[2:08:58] piece of clothing there
[2:09:02] and everybody would shut her out they
[2:09:04] wouldn't give her anything
[2:09:07] she'd ask for different garments or
[2:09:09] different maybe just a cold drink of
[2:09:11] water here or there just
[2:09:13] lived a smuddy old life
[2:09:15] she looked up on a hill and there's a
[2:09:17] fine mansion up there on the top of the
[2:09:19] hill
[2:09:21] she said i'm sure those are nice people
[2:09:24] surely they won't put me aside
[2:09:27] she knocked on the door
[2:09:29] she knocked on the door
[2:09:32] there was a man that opened the door and
[2:09:34] said
