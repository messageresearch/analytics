TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] is any good to us and some tough bugs that's gone around and we've got a bug here now that's you better not drink the water Manuel amen things are happening here at this place so today we I watched a special thing take place brother Tim Pruett dedicated brother Michael Dexter it's a little new baby and Brooke and Brooke Kirsten and to the Lord and and if you remember it was her father that was standing in the pulpit that had that had stepped just into the washroom and he just knew in that presence it was just it's just something he'd never felt before and then and then he would go to the pulpit and he'd had a story he had a story that he felt to share and that was the story of that sister miss Cole told at Switzerland that there was a couple that was desiring a baby and they were in a boat with brother branham and they were going across some waters that had had logs in the water and they called him dead heads and the captain of the boat was kind of just earring and all of a sudden just a sudden bump hit the side of the boat and brother branham said no that's that's not a law that's the angel of the Lord and he's came into the boat and he's going to give this lady's want in the child and he's going to give this lady a child and he tells that story and and the Lord that meets us there that day and and and today they had had four miscarriages in a row and after that event took place sister Bethany had a had a pregnancy and and literally every kind of complication that you could have she seemed to be going through it they kept telling their the baby was deformed and all of those different kinds of things and you know all those things just weary in your mind and and we pray for at the meeting and then and then brother Tim had a dream that she would be born and she would be beautiful and everything would be well he dedicated that miracle to the Lord today and so we just thank the Lord for yeah amen brother Jeremy do you have a picture for me I want to share a picture a man this is a miracle at Easter I met this man and brother David sent me a picture of him this morning he said you recognize this man well this man was in and brother David mayor's had came to the meeting as a visitor and he had a hair longer than most of your sisters do and as in a ponytail and he's and his clothes were just really ragged and and he just kind of walked with a stoop like this right here a very tall man about your height brother Josh and he just walked kind of stooped and you can tell he's taller than brother David and brother David is uh is a quite tall man as well well this man he came into prayer line and I told him the Lord told him you have a suicidal spirit and you're fighting depression and God set him free hallelujah I like it when God does work don't you hey man and brother David wanted to send us that and tell us that God's still alive and well a man I believe was Monday morning we got the call that or Monday during the night was that Monday during the night yeah it was Monday during the night 2 a.m. we begin to get calls that brother Terry Melton which his sister Betty sister Betty his brother Joe green sister that that she comes here and many times plays the organ as well and and she stays upstairs and and her husband you know there's just certain people that you just click with and Terry was the kind of guy that just clicked with he was in a good old boy club and hey if just good guy and hunter and fisherman and kind of guy that just kind of stood out on the porch and everybody loved to talk to and all those kind of things and he'd come to church for decades fall different little weaknesses in his life and but he's always would come to church and you know coming to church and knowing the Lord to different things and so he and I were buddies and he was a kind of guy that actually had actually let me hunt in his tree stand to give you an idea he never let none of his boys hunting a tree stand but he let brother Ron hunten his tree stand brother Joe Green never got to hunting his tree stand never got to hunt on the property but he took me I always felt kind of special that he took me in so and so we we we've been that kind of a friend through the years and and it was in the August camp that if you'll remember it was that I believe it was a Wednesday night service that the Lord had just done some very special things I told him I said if if I could just operate behind a curtain to where man couldn't see it or or nobody could hear my voice but just see the Lord Jesus that's what I would really like to see take place and as it would be there would be a circle that would come to the altar and we would pray for them and then after the service brother brother Matthew here and and and then brother Alden was just a faithful deacon he just came and they were they would meet me at the curtain and take me to the office and and I changed my clothes and get ready to leave and and so and so I as I was going through the curtains you know when I went through the curtain like I begin to just feel that feeling and we begin to one after another begin to have prayer with them and brother Nathaniel Greene being one and his wife Caitlin and and then and then there was a couple more that was standing there it would be the night to which that also brother gido if you know the story about brother Dido and brother Dido as he's coming and he's watching these things take place brother ghido says as he's standing it is just coming his arms stretched out like this and I begin to tell him brother ghido I see trouble coming for you and he's and and then a couple other things that came and then brother ghido there's a train that's coming and her to be okay for you to get on even in that then brother Dewayne Jackson and his wife was standing there just had prayed for her only moments ago but now I called brother Dewayne to pray for him and and I began to talk to him you've been running from a call for 17 years and then I begin to speak to him about total commitment to God and you know the just presence of the Lord came I don't know exactly the sequence of it all but Terry was standing there brother Alden was was there and Terry was standing there and he was just watching all that happen and tears running down out of his eyes and when I came to hear he said I can serve a god like that and he looked at me said brother Owen I need prayer and I just bundled him up he's a man built much like me and I just bundled him up in my arms and I begin to pray with him and I just felt him just heaving and tears and and just just giving his whole life to Jesus Christ sister Betty told me she said he was coming to meet her to take her home and they were going out the back because she was playing the organ and as they would leave out and she told me she said he was different from the moment he left you said I walked out of that building with a different man brother Andrew would speak to him just only a few weeks later and and he would talk to her and he says I met him that night I met him that night and and he would begin to tell him service because a few weeks later he would find out he had cancer and he's in between his lungs and he said you know I'm not I'm not scared of them of the cancer though I have no fear of that but I really hate to leave my wife none of us want to do that none of us wanted to leave the other morning need they had went out to get a little bite to eat and with some friends and they came home and did like a lot of us do that sat down on Sunday evenings and they sat down and they set in their easy chairs and sit there and and they just drifted off to sleep and about 1 o'clock in the morning that woke up and and so we ought to go to bed I don't know if many of you guys do that we we can't do that sometimes and so they they made ready to go to bed and sister Betty was making her way to bed and brother tape Terry was cutting off all the lights and and as he was laying down he he he sometimes couldn't breathe well and so he he'd said he's set up and and he coughed him and I won't go into it but he coughed and he said Betty get 9-1-1 just a few moments he went home to be with the Lord they called me the next morning and talked to me about it and I told them I said I could come if you know if you want me to come and so they invited me they wanted me to preach the funeral yesterday and I would say in attendance it was probably only brother homers funeral would be larger than then Darius and if you could have set him probably couldn't have set them all in the parking lot and yeah it was just you know when a man is a friend to everybody in and he's always been a buddy and been that kind of a guy and he got a lot of friends a lot of workers that had came there a lot of a lot of family members that was there and then they started at 11 o'clock in' and so they allowed us to start the funeral at 2:00 and friends were still coming and I just thought it was just I thought I'd just take a moment to share with you we don't realize in life we don't realize in life how quickly it all comes and how it goes brother out and just said something to me just a moment ago it that he's given thought to he said had he came and spit there and just kind of slipped on maybe just slipped on to the car he too missed his opportunity I don't want to miss my opportunity when Jesus comes by I think sometimes God has eternal purposes that he wants to do and so we just thank the Lord and I think a what an incredible miracle that was and I think now brother Dwayne Jackson I think he's preached about ten sermons now since that night but the ghido has went to be with the Lord in a complete surprise only only just a little bit before he's playing with his grandchildren they're up on his edie he's reading the paper and they're just milling around his head like any grandpa would do and they're shuffling his hair and you know he's playing and they're done and in a few moments he's going to be with the Lord we don't know we don't know it's not about what we attained in this life it's not about what we attain in this life or what we own in this life it's about who we meet and in that special moment in a manner IIIi think of all of those things and as I would stand here this evening I I just I just think oh god help me to be at the right place at the right time a manner so we just thank you for your sharing us last night now Andrew did an awesome job we listened to the songs sung and the preaching as it was preached and I I just so enjoyed that with all of our hearts and I was driving up the road and a Manning with you and sister Connie was a man and with us and Amen when he finished we stopped at McDonald's and got herself a hamburger just like we would do it we was here so a man got home last night about 11:30 and we left after the cookie exchange and we drove into the night night I think we got in bed about 2 o'clock and then got up yet Sunday morning Saturday morning and and I got ready for the funeral and and then drove home and got home last night about 11:00 11:30 probably 11:30 as type thing and and tried to get to bed and and then I have to be honest we've got slept in a little bit this morning and Amen kind of the weariness of the trip and well I say slip in I didn't sleep his note midnight midday now if I sleep past 7:00 I've slept in so so god bless you and I hope you hope that's okay we've got a birth that we got a Christmas present coming for you next week we thought about it as boys what could we give our audience as a Christmas present you know if I give you candy you eat it you'll make you fat and then come January 1 you'll have to work on that thing you know if I had if I sing a song you'll all leave but brother branham said that God has a present for us and it's wrapped wrapped in humanity so we've invited brother Danny Stephen to come and preach for you next week and we're going to take care of the experience expenses of Latin and I want you to enjoy him I want you to enjoy him and brother Danny's been a special friend to us it's the only time that he could come and he's been a special friend to us his meeting is actually going on right now and so brother Mike walls is there and so we want to pray that God would just bless that maybe somebody else is there but there it's gone it's gone right now but but we would pray that God would just bless that meeting a man you come to have Church a man it any good to us love him with all of our hearts let's stand to our feet hey one thing about it we'll try to get you as much exercise here at churches you can get you and so amen we love you with all of our hearts Saint John chapter 5 and verse 31 glad I'm still standing aren't you after Andrews sermon last night um I still believe Amen I believe you believe why brother Branham said I could preach to believers all night so maybe a man how many still believers amen god bless you st. John chapter 5 in verse 31 if I bear witness of myself my witness is not true therefore there is another that beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true you sent unto John and he bear witness unto the truth but I receive not testimony from man but these things I say that you might be saved he was a burning and shining light and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light it's quite a statement in it you enjoyed his message for a while but I have a greater witness than that of John for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me and you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding you in you for whom he hath sent him you believe not search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and you cannot come to me that ye might have life a man I want to read this I think it was read last night Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God so that the things which are not were not saying are saying were not made of things which do appear let's talk to the Lord just now Almighty God we love you with all of our hearts this evening and we bow our heads before you to the dust which we came and we want to remember her sister Betty and her family and Lord sister Tanya the boys there we pray that you would just bring them strength today many needs that are going on even around the world we pray that you would touch them and strengthen us may you anoint these words this evening father touch Lord bring strength to those that are even listening now I pray that you'd stretch forth your hand of mercy do a supernatural work we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask a man and an a man and a man god bless you you may be seated I'd like to just take for a thought that his purpose might stand our purpose will not stand too long our energies will not last long but God is a determined God God is very determined hebrews chapter 11 and III just like to just take a through few thoughts here just for a little bit hebrews chapter 11 you'll turn there with me Hebrews 11 I can just I can only fathom the thought of what it was like when Paul was writing this script as he's laying it out of each my faith and my faith and by faith and by faith Abraham and by faith Moses and and each one of them by faith a lot of things were unseen a lot of things were dropped into them by revelation and they grabbed ahold of it and held on it and they became passionate and they gave their very life for it the scripture and I pick it up in verse 31 and by faith the harlot Rahab perish not with them which believe not when she had received the spies with peace here was a woman that caught the message of the hour and her entire city her entire city was literally destroyed with me now thousands upon tens of thousands of people we don't have an exact count there but thousands upon tens of thousands the spice it came in and sawed how it was laid out but there was a promise of God his purpose was getting ready to stand and here's one woman with an occupation of being a harlot but a predestinated seed on the inside of her it didn't bother God her occupation he was not ashamed they knew she was in him before the foundation of the world and this woman literally in a few years is going to be a woman that is married in an incredible situation but at this point she's identified as a heretic I wonder how many of us had some pretty bad history to which that we don't even want to talk about tonight but God rich in mercy bypassed our original purpose what we thought we'd do and what we were doing and how we destroyed her life listen a lot of bad that we had done in our lives but God rich in mercy and the walls were crumbling around her and she had a promise when this city falls we're still going to be here when everybody dies around us we're going to overcome we're going to be preserved I'd say this view we live in and this layout of seeing darkness and chaos and immorality and terrible turmoil let the world fall apart because it's supposed to listen it's coming to its end with me it's coming to its end but that end that's got laman the scripture said it's a great and dreadful day of the Lord when more I save for the time would fail me of Gideon and Bay Ark and of Samson and Jeff and I and and of David and of Samuel and of the prophets their single name in God's Great Hall of Fame must have sent shivers to the devil oh brother on I'd like to have a chapter oh I don't need a chapter I just want my name cuz this there when there's no more Lucifer no more of these devils and the imps and his purpose is destroyed I'll still be there and I just happen to believe that's the way it is notice these words who through faith subdued kingdoms are you with me now can you put your name there who through faith subdued kingdoms he with me you subdued kingdoms of Laodicea and it didn't overcome you you subdued the fashion of this world you subdued the sins that it so easily could be said others and you're still standing oh brother ah I haven't done anything supernatural this week you're here you know I haven't I haven't done knows I haven't spoke the world into existence I haven't done nothing i I actually sometimes feel like I I don't want to feel like a Christian but you're still here sometimes we do things very naturally and don't realize it's very supernatural Satan six layers and traps and all different kind of things for you and you just karley you're going to school you're a senior this year if I'm might think so and as you're going to school and you're going through school and there's not too many people look like you would that be right you'd be probably in the minority yeah you're in the minority too many people conduct themselves like you you've been in minority but what they do don't matter to you all but what they do offends me let them look this is their heaven they're serving their purpose you just had been called to a higher purpose and his purpose will stand are you with me quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong what's valued to turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder how many's had at that kind of day that's not our age we're not being stoned with stones we're not being sawn asunder we're not being pulled apart we're not being burned at the stake our job is to overcome Laodicea are you with me are you with me it's an age to where that churches are dying people are dying off people don't want to go to church and yet God put a desire inside of you that you can't wait till those doors come open who did that I say God did that that his purpose will stand Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1 wherefore seeing we are so compassed about with with so great a cloud of witnesses I'm going to share a few things with you this evening let us lay aside every weight and the sin was best so easily beset us and let us run let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto our favorite preacher looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God what powerful writing Malachi 4:5 and in their verse 6 behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turned the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse there was a day that we preach God send and Elijah God send and Elijah God send and Elijah and Elijah came the Pentecost frites God sending Elijah the Baptist preached God's ending Elijah Spurgeon preach God's going to send Elijah he warned his own ministers that they couldn't reveal the seven seals a prophet will come and do that and God was just as good as his word he sinned Elijah and Aleya he sinned Elijah we're not ashamed of that but he was a man like light passions like me and you he made mistakes like you and I let me just say this year we're not to worship William Branham we're not to disrespect him whatsoever he said I he would have wanted to be a trapper if given his purpose he would have liked him in a trapper let me just bring it back to you and I thought this was interesting last week you heard a preacher that was a trapper at one time when brother Kelly was a younger man he was a trapper that laid trap lines up in the northern were up in the northern country of Canada there and they would run those those schema bills and and they would run them and go out for months at a time and you know brother Kelly the way he conducts himself never looks like the kind of guy that would that would be out there on the trap lines and and and and sleeping on that cold ground and building those pelts and building it together and spend months at a time and then when your snowmobile breaks down you walk for just tens of miles and and have to get parts and come back and redo it all over and just spend the whole time and but you see it was God was building a man that's what brother Branham wanted to be he wanted to be a trapper he wanted to do those things but God had a higher calling for him he had a higher calling for you many of us were the nominal people and many were in there skipping the denomination feeling that they were right but one day one day what you were listening to was not enough sitting in a Pew of going you know in the same ritual over and over again and you look around and there's no life here where's the life that and then just something begin to brood over you like an eagle calling somebody handed you a book somebody told you about a story somebody invited you to church maybe walked into this church saying I'll never come back again but you knew that there was life to that you felt that little something and that's something just kept pulling it's a song said something keeps holding me I'd like to say this that we're not holding herself I'm really glad of that to Luke for 17 and verse 30 Jesus is standing there and he says even that shall it be and that day when the Son of Man is revealed so we've lived in the day of the revealing of who Jesus Christ really is oh we've had the Bible for many many years now people have fought and died over heaven the print of the Bible arguments have taken place which Bible is correct but in this day it has become an open book to us and we've seen Jesus Christ that is among us even now and in that day which shall be he shall be upon the housetop and and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is afield let him not class not to return back and Jesus says three words here that it's always astounding remember Lot's wife we do not want to be identified with her that even angels came to her house and and brought them out of Sodom and brought them out and and and they didn't go back to where Abraham was but as they came out Lot's wife turned and looked back she turned and looked back remember this the scripture says that when a man puts his hand on the plow and he turns and he looks back he's not fit for the kingdom of heaven I want to be fit I want to be fit I want to say this year there's nothing in this world there's nothing in this world that I have seen and I've seen some very special things in life I've been in some really interesting places there's nothing here I want to stay for Hollywood gives you a picture of how life ought to be really really and then make a movie together and then they fall in love and they leave their wives and then they go make another movie together and they fall in love and they divorce this one to marry this one for a little island and stars become rock stars and country stars and before long you find out there living secret lives it's no reality to it I heard brother Andrew talk about an unreal world in and this world that's in the imagination and the games and the things people are so caught up and the world is so caught up as hell they're they're trying to live in an imaginary world that's not real brother branham would say those things are preparing people for a Tribulation Period whosoever shall seek his life to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose this life or shall preserve it and I tell you that in that night there shall to be two men and in one bed and once you'll be taking another one shall be left two women grinding together one shall be taken another left two men in the field and one shall be taken and the other left I want to fulfill the part of taken are you with me I want to fulfill that part taking I don't want to show up here on the Sunday after the after the people leave and go wherever is everybody act I don't have a conversation with people that may be amiss that are standing there and going where they all act what a haunting affair would that be so we're anointed by Almighty God just fulfilled the overcome and portion in this day somebody's going to overcome somebody's going to overcome here with me now somebody is going to overcome somebody's going to be raptured I just happened to believe it's me brother branham was standing and he's come to the end of the service the man named Victor LeDoux which is he's standing there and he's and there's also French interpreters that are standing in the building not giving you all the history and he's standing there he's given brother Branham some cufflinks and these cufflinks have a have a line and a red line in it they're white and somebody was sitting two pictures or maybe actually seen the cufflinks but they have a little red line in it and they see standing there he's talking to brother Branham about this could be the 20/20 the next chapter of the Book of Revelations and when he does he begins to speak in tongues and this man don't know Fritz but he begins to speak in French and three people being interpreters all captured what this man said and one being a very distinguished interpreter and it said because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way that was walked in your own choosing and I have a reason to say this eleven years I worked at the radford Arsenal and we made bombs there and I'll never forget we were there and I I said as a committeeman in the in the Union and had a position there one day one of the vice presidents wanted to be a little bit snide with me and and he began to begin to make some remarks to me and they began to kind of make fun of me for being a preacher working in a bomb factory and I guess costing me real quick them kind of turned these wheels just a few moments but this poin I I cut it out and I put it on my locker I put it on my locker and I look at it every day because it was more than just brother branham's choice or here anymore they just brother branham's choice it's our choice are you with me listen to me here we had to leave somewhere we left the world and we're here we left the opportunity is the world and we're here I want to read this again and what this become personal now to you and remember this lesson William Branham saying it about his self this was God saying it doing and Branham because thou has chosen the narrow path the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven a will await thee I believe I'm part of that I believe I'm part of that what a glorious decision thou hast made hallelujah let me just say this year we want to hear well done down here and we love to be encouraged down here but I can't wait to hear that from God [Music] what a glorious decision thou hast made this in itself it's that which will give and make to come to pass the tremendous victory and the love divine somebody asked me the other day where you get that energy actually my father said this to me on Friday evening he said where do you get that energy to do this and just stay so busy and go in here he said how do you keep all of that straight in your mind he said how do you go from this to this to this this and and you just and and it's just going on and he says he said hey I just I kind of have trouble having breakfast and then going feeding the cows I said bad were driven something on the inside of us we're driven for a purpose this ain't no time to relaxing and sit back this is our opportunity I want to challenge you tonight this is our opportunity God place to drive on the inside of us and he placed the seal a seal of burden a real burden on the inside of us to carry God's word this audience has a burden for the bright around the world and a vision to help others that others can have a opportunity to hear the same message that you hear all of this will be accomplished I think about the accomplishment that men has made and brother Branham talks about every generation must have its own revival talks about the cycle of passion of life and death in every every generation it seems to get weaker as it goes on even in a church that seems like the next generation if they're not careful it Falls and it fails away and the next generation gets worse and worse the next generation gets worse and there's a dying and if it's only a denomination the next generation don't look like the original but what's different about this place what's different about this place we have come we came through a couple of generations now give it a few more days the pathan will be handed to the next pastor well he wants me but this church is not regressing with me we're pressing forward all along we're pressing flowers [Applause] with me I heard Andrew preaching last night and I thought about it here then I was driving up the road better than 70 miles an hour and I'm listening to the service and and I I'm just listening and I'm thinking in my mind I can't be there I'd love to be there but God you made a way you made a way I didn't put that gift there God put that gift there you made a way Gladys a provider are you with me now remember this jesus said in our in Revelation chapter 3 and verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock remember what brother Brandon said about this quotation this is the first time that God is on the outside of the church knocking the church has put him outside he's no longer welcome to run the church but a governing body of a man as is governing the church and Jesus is on the outside and they've taken the scriptures and made them an on effect and said it's not inspired or we don't use that no more and just begin to explain away the supernatural buying prayers and buying obeisance and buying different things and before long generations become blinded before long sin contaminates the church and sin contaminates the pulpits it would be interesting if Elijah was here today what he would say brother Andrew used a word last night as a very difficult word word called bastard and that's that's a child that doesn't recognize his father doesn't have father and I and brother branham would call it that kind of a generation that we're living in an illegitimate generation and I'd say if he looked around that our government in our church world and the music and all that different kind of things if he would thought 65 was bad [Applause] brother Jason I'd say he would literally that ought to give us our CEO like never before to be on fire God don't let my fire go [Music] now let let me just say this to you how does the fire go out well if you were hunting and out in the mountains and you wanted to put your fire out at night you just start separating the coals you just start separating the coals and after a while this cold will roll over here it'll start to get cold and after a while you'll see the redness leave it after a while it'll be it'll be just a coal black clump of where fire used to be at listen you lay out of church a few times and for they say not the assembling of yourselves together just stop praying a lot just just stop listening to the message of the IRA Walla what I just come to church even if you come to church and just kind of fold your arms and sit there before long they're just like a cold that has been rolled off to the side a little bit why I didn't get nothing out of church what did you put in [Applause] you listen me we expect the minister to preach a masterpiece every service we really do we expect to we expect the singer to never hit a sour note ER musicians to always spend on perfect time maybe maybe Matthew or Andrew doesn't get to get though I can say that about them and maybe they don't get the the tone just right or the melody just right and you're you're going you know I wish they'd just get it together well maybe maybe you know brother Andrews the triangles preacher somebody's trying to preach and you're going wow I've heard this 20 times before yeah I just kind of wish they get somewhere get somewhere with this somebody said something to me yesterday about a critic and they said well you know are you aren't you worried about what they say and I just look like I look to the deacon that was talking to him and I said have they ever won one soul have they ever won one soul to Christ heaven had they ever really effectively preached one sermon and you want to write an 80-page book to tell me where I'm wrong I'll tell you get over yourself don't do something for Christ are you with me we got a quotation for brother Donnie Ragan little this week that I thought it was just applica lie I thought I'm gonna hang on to that because they didn't want the New Testament that came generations that literally tried to go back and say that Pontius Pilate never lived they spent centuries trying to disprove the Bible saying Pontius Pilate never lived they spent their whole life trying to prove he never lived so that they could disprove the Bible do you know about ten years ago they found the stone that Pontius Pilate signed so they spent hundreds of years trying to prove he didn't live and they wasted their entire life trying to prove that this Bible's wrong a lot of people who spend their entire life what trying to fight brother Branham when he's dead gone and gone they'll spend their life trying to fight men like brother Homer fight men like me or fight men all over the world and they'll spend their life and it's gone and they become nothing nothing even dust won't even come become dust but what will you do with your life why would you do with your life [Applause] brother Brown talked about a man named emer shik Aryan he came along and he sold Pentecost right back to her room and he was that close to the message and he sold her right back to Rome you heard that generation next generation gets worse the next generation gets worse and here we come and we're living with his his fallen grandchildren and one of them is the highest fashion model is the youngest I think billionaire names Kendall Kardashian I let me just say if I go by the way of the grave and my grandchildren turned out to be that I'm gonna say this I'm gonna say this and if it gives me repercussions sister Brenda the other day at our Frasier dinner I just kind of stood back and I was standing there I was looking around the room and now we've got generations that's wet growed up and I'm glad to have brother Vernon and sister Francis I'm glad to have them standing here doors I make a request sister Brenda and this is where I might get in trouble I'd like about 15 minutes next year at that dinner and I want to bring myself maybe I can get somebody to bring me a microphone and a speaker and I want to preach on have you forgot where you came from by the Vernon your grandma your grandma shouting and that grottoes down there shouting in those meetings brother Homer he stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the greatest men that ever lived we can look in the folder back there thousand said he baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and brother Beatle and brother Vernon and other deacons baptize them in the name of Lord Jesus Christ let me just say if you give a servant of God a cold drink of water you get a reward this is going to get a reward one day sure there's a lot of darkness in the world but there's lights there's light that is here i don'ts mean that is a reflection to anybody brother on you're throwing a stone at me if it hits you this was the spot to get it fixed brother are not offends me here's the spot to get it fits not at the white throne judgment while there's still life on the inside of you get it fixed give your heart to God don't waste another day don't waste another month or with the life spit your life for Jesus Christ a few months we'll go to Japan where there's a handful of believers that are catching the fire of God then we'll go to the Philippines and within just a couple of days then back to Japan again to preach a meeting they're already getting incredible response that's going to go on their mother on why put your life in jeopardy I'll never see that person but somebody spent the time to get you somebody spent the time to get you the scripture says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared unto his servants the prophets that's been fulfilled no need to try to fight that that's been fulfilled and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the book which is open it's open its open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and I went into the angel said unto me give me the little book and he said take it and eat it and it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it and it was in my mouth sweet as honey in the sinners I had eaten it my belly was bitter it cleared my life of all the inconsistencies because God wants more than a Bible in your hands he wants the life in your heart [Applause] and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings but the man has a quotation that we read from literally you hear it almost all the time he comes right in the middle of them and would just pick up right just a just a just a part of it he says that he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army I'm not looking for a church coming it's here we're people of Destiny what people of God's purpose we're people of God's crowning achievement hallelujah are you with me now though we see the hand of God being manifested among us we have become a lived voices lift voices annoying it to fulfill under the influence of their the mighty angel overcoming in this day when it seems like nobody can stand forgive me it seems like nobody can stand everything's been shaken that can be shaken but God's got a hook of our lives he has pre-planned there's going to be some overcomers he's pre-planned us to overcome we have been ordained we have been elected and we have been placed to live in this day and God's got work for us to do I'd like to declare to you that the my expectation is the rapture I'd get up every morning my expectation is the rapture it don't happen today I'll be looking for it tomorrow that'll happen tomorrow I'll be looking for it the next day I don't know about you but sometimes I wake up disappointed that I'm still here we come out of incredible services and we go home literally feels like the rapture is happening around us we go to bed and we wake up and it's another morning and I just kind of go sometimes go through the house well we're still here this is another day to overcome so we realize it's brother Tim Pruett preached here we are people of an open book we realize that we are people of 1st Thessalonians 4:13 we're remaining we are consistent we're remaining and if our time runs out and we go by the way of the grave we heard it last week hey you know great go hold my body down I'm gonna take a little liberty here just for a moment if that's gonna be ok you heard a song and you you you you heard a song then you enjoyed how they enjoyed that ain't no grave can hold my body down this is ok I'm just going I'm just gonna go and it was put on your heart to sing it and then there was some apprehension as a matter of fact I believe it was one of the girls that said no I don't you know there's certain things that's sacred you just don't want to do I don't touch that now we may not get it right I just don't I don't feel nothing no another sing it and then listen to it again and
