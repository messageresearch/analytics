[50:39] Lord that we are setting on Holy Ground
[50:41] father lord it's a place that we
[50:44] recognize that the angels of God have
[50:46] gathered to watch your children worship
[50:49] you father for only we as your children

[51:17] in the natural that sustain us but this
[51:19] is our real sustaining father This Is
[51:22] Where We Gather our strength from lord

[52:32] this service into your hands in the name
[52:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray these
[52:36] things amen and amen if you have your bi
[52:40] your Bibles this evening we'd like to
[52:41] look over in the Book of Genesis CH 4
[52:45] verse three and then also to Numbers
[52:47] Chapter
[52:49] 23 Genesis 4 and Numbers Chapter
[52:54] 23
[53:11] you love the Lord this evening amen the
[53:14] Bible says here in Genesis 4 and3 that
[53:16] in the process of time it came to pass
[53:20] that Cain brought of the fruit of the
[53:22] ground an offering unto the Lord and he
[53:25] also brought of the firstlings of his
[53:28] flock and of the fat thereof and the
[53:31] Lord had respect unto Abel and his
[53:33] offering but unto Cain and to his
[53:36] offering he had not respect and Cain was
[53:39] very wroth and his countenance fell and
[53:42] the Lord said unto Cain why art thou
[53:43] wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen
[53:46] if thou doest well shall thou not be
[53:50] accepted and if thou doest not well sin
[53:52] lith at the door and unto thee shall be
[53:56] his desire and thou shalt rule over him
[53:59] and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[54:00] and it came to pass that when they were
[54:02] in the field that Cain rose up against
[54:04] Abel his brother and slew him Numbers
[54:08] Chapter
[54:09] 23 verse one
[54:13] here the Bible says that and balum said
[54:16] unto Balo build me here seven altars and
[54:20] prepare me here seven oxen and seven
[54:23] Rams and Bao did as balum had spoken and
[54:27] Balo and balum offered unto every on
[54:30] every altar a bolock and a ram and balum
[54:33] said unto Bao stand by the burnt
[54:35] offering and I will go per adventure of
[54:37] the Lord will come to meet me and
[54:39] whatsoever he showeth me I will tell
[54:41] thee and he went to an high place and
[54:45] God met balam and he said unto him I
[54:47] have prepared seven altars and I have
[54:50] offered upon every altar a bolock and a
[54:53] ram and the Lord put a word in bam mouth
[54:55] and said return unto Bao and thus shalt
[54:58] thou speak and he returned unto him and
[55:01] lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he
[55:04] and all the princes of Moab and he took
[55:06] up his Parable and said Balo the king of
[55:08] Moab hath brought me from Aram out of
[55:12] the mountains of the East saying come
[55:14] curse me Jacob and come defile Israel
[55:18] and how how shall I curse whom God hath
[55:21] not cursed or how shall I defy whom the
[55:25] Lord hath not defied may God bless his
[55:28] word you may be seated here in the
[55:30] presence of the Lord I'd like to speak
[55:32] to you this weekend on a thought uh Lord
[55:35] willing here on a thought that the Lord
[55:37] placed on our heart last weekend while
[55:38] brother Ron was speaking he was speaking
[55:41] along these lines of developing a
[55:44] picture that God developing his picture
[55:46] of of us and his predestination and
[55:48] knowing the journey that we are on that
[55:51] that we are walking with him and God
[55:53] developing that picture and one brother
[55:55] Ron began to speak those things this
[55:57] this thought dropped in my heart that
[55:58] I'll speak to you this weekend on on a
[56:01] collision of atmospher and immediately
[56:04] when brother Ron began to speak those
[56:05] things my mind went to reeling back into
[56:08] in my schooling and remembering when we
[56:10] would when we would take photography and
[56:12] videography classes that when we would
[56:14] develop the pictures that they had to go
[56:16] through a dark room process that they
[56:18] had to go through the solution that they
[56:20] had to be had to sit there for so long
[56:22] and they had to go through an agitation
[56:24] process before they could be brought
[56:26] back into the light and and so tonight
[56:28] by the help of the Lord I'd like to
[56:29] speak to you this thought uh is very
[56:31] fresh to me and uh so we just we just
[56:34] take it as far as we go tonight and let
[56:36] the Lord lead us as he does but that
[56:38] word Collision it is the act of striking
[56:42] together it is it is a clashing it is an
[56:45] opposition a collision can mean a
[56:48] running against each other as just like
[56:50] it ships at Sea that we would see or
[56:53] maybe in olden times when we would look
[56:55] back and think about when when kings and
[56:57] kings and queens would have jousting
[56:59] events when two knights would be fully
[57:01] decorated in their heavy armor as they
[57:03] would as they would go against each
[57:05] other and they charge each other and
[57:07] horse back back and forth with lanches
[57:09] and they would do it with all and trying
[57:11] to hit each other as hard as possible
[57:13] and they were what they were doing they
[57:15] were causing a reaction to their actions
[57:18] that they were that they were in the
[57:20] process of doing they they they created
[57:23] a collision and the one that the one
[57:25] that maybe got pierced through or one
[57:27] that moved at a terrific rate of speed
[57:29] was the one that maybe would win the
[57:31] battle or whatsoever but it caused a
[57:33] collision as we would know and it caused
[57:36] a reaction to what they were looking at
[57:39] and there are there are many common
[57:40] chemical reactions that we are aware of
[57:43] that we would see in our everyday life
[57:45] but we don't necessarily think about the
[57:47] process of them because we just simply
[57:50] expect the results of them and one of
[57:52] them being combustion which we enjoy y
[57:55] all enjoy a fire and especially as a
[57:57] season that we're getting ready to go
[57:59] into but we don't think about the
[58:00] process of combustion how that it takes
[58:03] three elements to bring about the the
[58:06] fire that we all enjoy it takes it takes
[58:09] oxygen it takes heat it takes fuel and
[58:11] it you can you can understand that you
[58:13] don't really think about it you don't
[58:15] really think about the the process of
[58:17] what we enjoy necessarily even in a
[58:19] meeting like what we're having here
[58:21] tonight or or things that have happened
[58:23] in our past or maybe that are happening
[58:25] in our future it's because of all of the
[58:27] elements of Prayer of fasting and
[58:30] believing how that they come together
[58:32] and it creates a fire of the Holy Ghost
[58:34] that that channels our that channels our
[58:36] belief into a into and it causes a
[58:39] reaction when all of these elements come
[58:41] together it's wonderful to know that
[58:43] there is power in prayer it doesn't
[58:46] matter who is praying it it doesn't
[58:47] matter where they're praying it but we
[58:49] realize that we understand that many of
[58:52] times we don't understand the effects on
[58:54] or the design or the elements of prayer
[58:57] but we all enjoy the results of prayer
[59:00] there are many things that we pray about
[59:02] that we don't necessarily see in our
[59:04] maybe in a week or so but maybe there
[59:06] are things that we have prayed about
[59:08] maybe maybe months and years ago but we
[59:10] don't even realize that healing or or or
[59:13] the power of the Lord is already worked
[59:15] we don't think about all the elements
[59:16] that are involved we just think about
[59:18] the results it's just like one time I
[59:20] was when I was working as a kid with
[59:22] brother Thomas back when I was in high
[59:23] school we we were cleaning this chimney
[59:26] and this guy he was I believe he was a a
[59:28] professor or doctor and he was he was
[59:31] beginning to tell brother Thomas how to
[59:32] create a fire and went through all the
[59:34] steps of it but he couldn't create a
[59:36] fire I thought it was amazing this guy
[59:38] could tell brother Thomas all about how
[59:40] to build a fire but yet he couldn't do
[59:42] it and it's amazing how people can take
[59:44] all the chemical ideas of all their
[59:47] ideas and try to make a church just work
[59:49] exactly the way it is but you see it's
[59:51] amazing how God Gets behind certain
[59:53] elements and then God begins to build a
[59:56] fire there are certain elements about
[59:58] these things that we common common uh
[1:00:01] chemical reactions that we don't even
[1:00:02] think about it's like everybody that is
[1:00:04] sitting here tonight you don't even
[1:00:05] think about your respiration system but
[1:00:08] it's something that God created on the
[1:00:10] inside of you that you have the ability
[1:00:12] to breathe in and to breathe out and
[1:00:15] when you breathe in you are breathing in
[1:00:17] oxygen and you're breathing out CO2 you
[1:00:19] don't even think about it but those
[1:00:21] plants that are out there those trees
[1:00:23] they are putting off they're putting off
[1:00:25] that oxygen they're breathing out oxygen
[1:00:27] to us and we're breathing out CO2 to
[1:00:29] them you don't think about it but every
[1:00:31] single one of us here are are operating
[1:00:34] through a chemical reaction that is that
[1:00:36] has happened and without that action in
[1:00:38] our life we couldn't be sitting here
[1:00:40] tonight it's it's what we understand
[1:00:42] what if you would take a if you would
[1:00:44] take a 1950 old Ford truck that you had
[1:00:47] kept up in the garage somewhere that
[1:00:48] you'd never seen that it was always
[1:00:50] garage kept and you ever kept it you
[1:00:52] kept it real clean and nice and
[1:00:53] everything it would stay in its perfect
[1:00:56] condition if it was out from underneath
[1:00:57] the elements but you take that truck and
[1:00:59] you put it out there under the elements
[1:01:01] of of water and air and under the
[1:01:04] conditions of of the atmospheres that
[1:01:06] it's in you you you'll see what you'll
[1:01:08] see is you'll begin to see a brownish
[1:01:10] oxide color that will come over that
[1:01:12] truck and that's that's one thing that a
[1:01:14] dealer is it's his worst nightmares to
[1:01:16] see one of those classic trucks that
[1:01:19] that has rust on it because rust is a is
[1:01:21] a truck's worst nightmare and the to go
[1:01:24] back in there but you don't really think
[1:01:26] about you don't really think about the
[1:01:28] process of it you just see the results
[1:01:30] of it you don't think about while while
[1:01:32] it's out there setting in the rain you
[1:01:34] don't think about the rust but after a
[1:01:36] while it begins to be a reaction to the
[1:01:39] elements that it's under and you don't
[1:01:41] really think about the power of the
[1:01:42] preaching of the word but when you see
[1:01:44] the results of it you understand that
[1:01:47] there was a collision of atmospheres
[1:01:49] that took place in the world that you're
[1:01:51] living in I think it's amazing that we
[1:01:53] have the ability to tap into a world
[1:01:55] that maybe we don't fully understand but
[1:01:58] yet there's something on the inside of
[1:02:00] us that wants to tap into that world of
[1:02:02] Faith or the world of the word and to
[1:02:05] tap into it and when you begin to
[1:02:07] operate in that level that you move in
[1:02:09] there by faith you begin to pull down
[1:02:11] things of God you don't really think
[1:02:13] about the process of the song leader
[1:02:15] working and beginning to stand there and
[1:02:18] begin to build an atmosphere you don't
[1:02:20] really think about it that much but all
[1:02:22] of a sudden that man that has a gift
[1:02:24] from God he he takes the atmosphere and
[1:02:26] he he changes it according to the Lord's
[1:02:29] desire you see that's the power of A
[1:02:32] Gifted Man Of God he understands what
[1:02:34] it's like to to get into the mind of God
[1:02:37] he's prayed about it he's he's studied
[1:02:39] what the Lord wants and he begins to
[1:02:41] move under the elements of the
[1:02:43] atmosphere and we always recognize that
[1:02:46] though no matter where we go that there
[1:02:47] is a there is a battle that is between
[1:02:50] the natural and the spiritual and we
[1:02:52] always recognize that that there are
[1:02:54] twins of every Revival and I don't have
[1:02:57] time to go through every twin that came
[1:02:59] but we know that there was Cain and Abel
[1:03:01] which we read of and throughout every
[1:03:03] Revival it always produces a twin of it
[1:03:06] but we recognize immediately in the
[1:03:08] Bible that there is a collision between
[1:03:11] Lucifer and Michael when Lucifer which
[1:03:14] was God's coworker in heaven to think
[1:03:17] about this tonight that God God had a
[1:03:20] man that was his right-hand man he was
[1:03:22] his leader of Music they in in heaven
[1:03:26] and this man was a right-hand man to
[1:03:28] almighty God but this man had something
[1:03:31] that would rise up on the inside of him
[1:03:33] which is pride that he wanted to lift
[1:03:35] himself above the stars of God but this
[1:03:38] man had every ability that God had
[1:03:40] except for the ability to be able to
[1:03:42] create so he had the ability to to stand
[1:03:46] out there and to create or to to worship
[1:03:48] God but he did not have the be the
[1:03:51] ability to speak things into existence
[1:03:54] so so tonight to know that you have more
[1:03:56] power than Satan has ever
[1:03:59] had I think it ought to make you be able
[1:04:01] to Rejoice to understand to know that
[1:04:04] you have done something tonight by your
[1:04:06] worship that Satan has never
[1:04:09] done you have created something here by
[1:04:12] these elements of of respiration you
[1:04:15] have breathed in and you have breathed
[1:04:18] out the Praises of almighty God you have
[1:04:20] done something that Satan has never done
[1:04:22] but what Satan can do he can pervert
[1:04:26] what God has created so what he does he
[1:04:28] cannot have the ability to be able to
[1:04:30] create anything so he simply deforms or
[1:04:33] he perverts what God has created you
[1:04:36] watch any seed that's that God has
[1:04:38] created the only ability that Satan has
[1:04:41] is to be able to pervert it or to change
[1:04:44] it in some way it's just like the cells
[1:04:46] of our body every one of those cells in
[1:04:49] our body was formed to be a product of
[1:04:51] almighty God but Satan wants to get get
[1:04:54] into those Cs and he wants to break up
[1:04:56] those CS because if he can break up
[1:04:58] those CS he can make us sick so Satan
[1:05:01] comes in to what we would realize is is
[1:05:04] what we are made of of of 16 different
[1:05:06] elements that are in our body there are
[1:05:08] 206 bones that are in our body that our
[1:05:11] little my little daughter taught me
[1:05:12] about today but there are six there's
[1:05:15] there's 16 elements that we are made out
[1:05:17] of and there every one of them they have
[1:05:19] a we have a cell on the inside of us and
[1:05:22] if we know that those cells are created
[1:05:25] for God to use but Satan wants to come
[1:05:28] in there and pervert those cells and
[1:05:30] brother Brandon would take that and he
[1:05:31] would type it and he would break down
[1:05:34] what cancer is that cancer is a life he
[1:05:38] said it's just like a cell that's in
[1:05:40] your body he said you can look at
[1:05:41] anything in the natural and it'll type
[1:05:44] the spiritual he said you look at cancer
[1:05:46] he said what it is he said it's a
[1:05:48] backsliding sail he said but you look at
[1:05:50] it he said if you look at it in the in
[1:05:53] in the spiritual he said it's a devil he
[1:05:55] said but in the natural it's like a
[1:05:57] buzzard it's like a scavenger he's
[1:05:59] eating on dead things that sell was
[1:06:01] meant there put there to be to be an
[1:06:05] abstract an an attribute of almighty God
[1:06:08] to begin to express what God had in his
[1:06:11] mind you see these bodies were formed so
[1:06:14] that we could bless God these bodies
[1:06:16] were formed that we would prosper and be
[1:06:18] in good health but Satan is against
[1:06:21] everything that God is for is that right
[1:06:25] so we see that when when Satan comes
[1:06:27] into that sail here you see every single
[1:06:29] one of us we come through we come
[1:06:32] through the bedding grounds of our
[1:06:33] mothers and our fathers and it doesn't
[1:06:35] matter what God intended that seed to be
[1:06:38] whatever that germ is whether it's a dog
[1:06:41] or whether it's a bird or a foul of the
[1:06:43] air God has destined that cell to
[1:06:46] produce exactly what he thought of that
[1:06:48] germ that it would be and it's just like
[1:06:50] when you pass through the bedding
[1:06:52] grounds of your mother and your father
[1:06:54] father you were then a product of what
[1:06:56] your father was but your father could
[1:06:59] not fellowship with you in that realm so
[1:07:02] he had to produce you he had to produce
[1:07:04] you so that he could have fellowship
[1:07:06] with you and God wanted to understand
[1:07:09] what it was like to be a savior so God
[1:07:11] created himself something that he could
[1:07:14] save so he reached down and he grabbed
[1:07:16] Adam and Eve out of their condemnation
[1:07:18] and he wrapped them up with a blood cell
[1:07:21] of a lamb and he allowed them the Eed
[1:07:24] that they were born to be in he allowed
[1:07:26] them to walk back into it by this body
[1:07:29] in this generation to walk back into
[1:07:32] that same atmosphere of the Garden of
[1:07:34] Eden as the body of Jesus Christ now has
[1:07:38] done we understand that cancer it comes
[1:07:42] from a bruise for instant may he would
[1:07:45] say he in my hand he said it hasn't got
[1:07:47] cancer he said it may have sometime but
[1:07:49] right now it doesn't he said but what is
[1:07:51] cancer he said it's some sale or germ in
[1:07:54] my body that backslides it gets bruised
[1:07:56] or something sets in
[1:07:58] it and he said from that cell it starts
[1:08:01] a multiplication of cells and
[1:08:03] multiplying and and it forms a Cancer
[1:08:05] and it begins to start eating on my body
[1:08:09] now brother random said now he would say
[1:08:10] he said now any sale he said any kind of
[1:08:13] germ he said it will nothing he said if
[1:08:16] nothing interrupts that program he said
[1:08:18] God's program if nothing interrupts it
[1:08:20] it'll be a perfect it'll be a perfect
[1:08:22] maybe it's a dog bear or bird or bear or
[1:08:25] any a child or anything he said if
[1:08:27] nothing interrupts God's program it'll
[1:08:30] be perfect he said it'll grow to be a
[1:08:32] perfect normal adult he said if nothing
[1:08:35] if nothing interrupts it he said but
[1:08:36] when something interrupts it he said
[1:08:39] then it's bound to be evil that
[1:08:40] interrupts God's program he said God
[1:08:42] didn't intend you to be sick he made you
[1:08:45] in his likeness and he wants you to be
[1:08:47] well he's done everything that he can to
[1:08:49] keep you well but it's Satan that is
[1:08:52] against you it's Satan that is against
[1:08:55] you you see that sale has a life like
[1:08:58] you have a life so there is something
[1:09:00] that is calling for you to live and
[1:09:02] there's something that is calling for
[1:09:03] you to die and we realize this that
[1:09:05] Satan is absolutely obsolute without a
[1:09:08] body to work
[1:09:09] in is that right we look we look back in
[1:09:13] the Bible and we see when Legion is
[1:09:15] standing there before Jesus that he
[1:09:17] stands there and he those demons begin
[1:09:19] to cry out send us into that herd of
[1:09:22] swine because those Dem demons have no
[1:09:24] ability unless they have a body to work
[1:09:27] through that's why Satan hates anything
[1:09:30] that is that is including Mark chapter
[1:09:33] 16 because he recognizes when the church
[1:09:36] begins to believe the word of God they
[1:09:38] have the ability to lay hands on the
[1:09:40] sick and they shall recover and Satan
[1:09:43] knows that when you begin to tap into
[1:09:46] the spiritual that there is a collision
[1:09:49] with the carnality that Satan is trying
[1:09:51] to produce in your own body
[1:09:54] you see Satan knows that if he can make
[1:09:56] you sick he can make your mind weak if
[1:10:00] he can make your mind weak he can make
[1:10:01] you doubt God's
[1:10:03] word but this we know that that when
[1:10:06] Whenever there is a class when the
[1:10:09] carinal and the spiritual meat there
[1:10:11] always is a collision we notice when
[1:10:14] Judas and Jesus Jud Judas and Jesus
[1:10:17] excuse me when they begin to meet there
[1:10:18] was a collision there was a clash one of
[1:10:20] them one of them was was the pastor and
[1:10:23] one of them was a treasure of the church
[1:10:25] just like Cain and Abel there was a
[1:10:27] collision that happened between
[1:10:29] them it was a collision that happened
[1:10:32] between them and notice what it is it's
[1:10:34] always a constant war or a collision
[1:10:37] between the two you notice always there
[1:10:40] was when Saul and David were on the same
[1:10:43] on the same scene at the same time there
[1:10:45] was always the Bible said there was war
[1:10:48] between Saul's house and David's house
[1:10:51] and David's house got stronger and
[1:10:52] stronger but Saul's house got weaker and
[1:10:55] weaker but this we know that Jesus said
[1:10:58] in Matthew chapter 24 that you will hear
[1:11:01] of wars and rumors of wars and this we
[1:11:04] know that brother Brandon would teach us
[1:11:06] he said if you see this National spirit
[1:11:08] and they cause a war against this
[1:11:10] National Spirit he said what it is is
[1:11:13] two demon spirits that are at War at
[1:11:15] each other he said they cannot get along
[1:11:18] he said so they begin to fight each
[1:11:20] other that's exactly what happened in
[1:11:22] World War I and World War II it was
[1:11:24] demonic powers that were against each
[1:11:26] other so they begin to fight it
[1:11:29] out they begin to fight it out but the
[1:11:31] angel of the Lord came and stopped that
[1:11:36] war but I don't know if you read the
[1:11:38] news today or not but we realize that
[1:11:40] Israel is at War right now they're at
[1:11:43] War right now with Hamas and Iran and we
[1:11:46] recognize that that everything of hell
[1:11:49] is against anything that has God
[1:11:52] called and we know notice that even all
[1:11:54] the way back with with with Esau and
[1:11:57] Jacob that we go all the way back from
[1:11:59] Abraham and lot that we realize that
[1:12:01] there's always been a clash between the
[1:12:03] natural and the spiritual it doesn't
[1:12:06] matter what type it is in Christ or
[1:12:08] Antichrist but there's always a battle
[1:12:10] between the two and didn't Yahoo said
[1:12:13] today he said our enemy will pay a price
[1:12:16] they'll pay a price of which it has
[1:12:18] never known he said we are in a war and
[1:12:21] we will win it and Satan doesn't realize
[1:12:25] that he's going to pay a price that he
[1:12:27] has never known and he may battle us and
[1:12:30] he may attack us sale after sale time
[1:12:33] after time but we will win this
[1:12:36] war we will win this war it doesn't
[1:12:39] matter the attacks of the enemies it
[1:12:41] doesn't matter how he comes against us
[1:12:43] but we will stand here under our
[1:12:45] god-given
[1:12:46] privileges you go and study out how big
[1:12:49] Israel is Rhode Island's almost bigger
[1:12:52] than Israel but every Army in the in the
[1:12:55] Nations is against that one place but
[1:12:58] anybody that is for Israel God will
[1:13:01] bless them and anybody that is for
[1:13:04] Spiritual Israel God will bless them in
[1:13:07] return don't you see when somebody
[1:13:09] begins to bless you or bless your
[1:13:11] children that you'll see the benefits of
[1:13:14] almighty God poured out upon them and
[1:13:16] they don't know nothing about this
[1:13:18] message it's because of who you
[1:13:20] are if you stand for Israel God will
[1:13:23] stand for you and if you'll stand for
[1:13:25] this message God will stand for
[1:13:30] you we look all the way back let us let
[1:13:33] me just roll through these scriptures
[1:13:35] just real quick that we roll all the way
[1:13:37] back in the Garden of Eden there we find
[1:13:39] that when God begins to create man and I
[1:13:42] just want to make reference to these
[1:13:43] things that there God in in Genesis 1
[1:13:47] and 26 he said let us make man in our
[1:13:49] image in Genesis chap 2 and 7 there we
[1:13:53] see that God formed Man Out of the Dust
[1:13:55] of the ground and there he breathed into
[1:13:57] him the breath of life and there when
[1:14:00] God had created the Garden of Eden
[1:14:02] Eastward he there took man and he placed
[1:14:05] him in there of which he was formed out
[1:14:07] of the ground of the earth and we notice
[1:14:10] that there in that Garden was two trees
[1:14:13] there there was the tree of knowledge of
[1:14:15] Good and Evil and it was the tree of
[1:14:17] life that was setting there in Genesis
[1:14:19] chap 2 and 16 then we see the command
[1:14:23] commment that God gives unto man that
[1:14:25] thou shall not eat or or or of every
[1:14:28] tree of the garden thou might freely eat
[1:14:31] except of the tree of the knowledge of
[1:14:33] Good and Evil so we immediately watch
[1:14:35] that God creates man in his own Spirit
[1:14:39] then God after his own Spirit then God
[1:14:41] creates Man Out of the Dust of the earth
[1:14:43] then God places that man under a under a
[1:14:46] Commandment that thou shalt not touch
[1:14:48] these things so we immediately watch
[1:14:51] that in that Garden there are two ATM
[1:14:53] atmospheres there are two atmospheres
[1:14:55] there's two persons and that each person
[1:14:58] has an atmosphere it's like everybody
[1:15:00] sitting here tonight you put off your
[1:15:02] own air or you put off your own
[1:15:03] atmosphere there's a lot of people that
[1:15:05] are here tonight or maybe people that
[1:15:07] you meet out there brother bandam said
[1:15:08] there's certain people that you just
[1:15:09] love to be around he said then there are
[1:15:12] certain people that you don't want to be
[1:15:13] around at all he said be it's because of
[1:15:16] the atmosphere that they create you
[1:15:18] don't have to ask people how they're
[1:15:20] doing typically their face will tell you
[1:15:22] how they're doing
[1:15:24] they'll they'll they'll tell you by
[1:15:25] their acent you watch a mama that ain't
[1:15:27] got no sleep all night she's been up all
[1:15:29] night putting up with children they had
[1:15:31] and hardly slip you'll watch that mama
[1:15:33] she snaps real quick at her children she
[1:15:35] snaps at her husband it's because you
[1:15:37] never know what a mama's going
[1:15:39] through you never know what a mama's
[1:15:41] going through and you watch you don't
[1:15:43] have to you really don't have to stick
[1:15:44] around long to find out that that Mama's
[1:15:46] had a long night by the atmosphere that
[1:15:49] she's creating but oh if you'll give
[1:15:51] that Mama eight hours of sleep she'll be
[1:15:53] just as good as
[1:15:55] new you don't really have to ask
[1:15:57] somebody what kind of atmosphere or what
[1:15:59] kind of day that they're having you can
[1:16:01] simply tell by the atmosphere that
[1:16:03] they're creating you don't have to ask
[1:16:05] your boss on the job how his weekend was
[1:16:07] when he comes in there and he ain't
[1:16:09] talked to you after three cups of coffee
[1:16:11] you understand there has been a
[1:16:13] collision in his life that has wrecked
[1:16:16] up wrecked up what he had going on this
[1:16:18] weekend and things didn't pan out like
[1:16:20] he wanted
[1:16:22] to but we watch right there in that
[1:16:25] scene that we've just seen that the
[1:16:27] prince of the power of the air comes on
[1:16:29] the
[1:16:30] scene this is your first
[1:16:33] introduction to the wrong
[1:16:36] atmosphere then you immediately roll
[1:16:38] over into Genesis chapter 3 and you'll
[1:16:41] find that there is a serpent that was
[1:16:45] more subtle than all the beasts of the
[1:16:47] land he was one so close to humanity
[1:16:50] that brother Brandon would say in the
[1:16:52] church age book he said there was
[1:16:53] definitely an affinity between him and
[1:16:57] Humanity that his seed could intermingle
[1:16:59] between
[1:17:00] Humanity but then God hid that but
[1:17:04] notice what Eve said when when they find
[1:17:07] themselves outside of God's will when
[1:17:10] they find themselves awakened to the
[1:17:13] fact that they are fully naked that they
[1:17:16] are not dressed how did they come by
[1:17:18] this knowledge Eve said this word the
[1:17:21] serpent that you created begot me and
[1:17:24] what did Adam do the woman that you gave
[1:17:27] me god notice what he did he immediately
[1:17:31] begins a blame game in
[1:17:33] humanity it's so amazing how people
[1:17:36] begin to start the blame game when they
[1:17:39] get caught in the act of sin that they
[1:17:41] blame this one or they blame their
[1:17:42] mother well I my daddy died with that or
[1:17:44] my mama dealt with that there was carnal
[1:17:47] impersonations in my life there was
[1:17:48] there was always drugs in my family
[1:17:50] there was alcohol in my family there was
[1:17:52] cancer in my family and they begin to
[1:17:54] blame it on that but here she says the
[1:17:58] serpent beguiled me that word begal
[1:18:02] means to entice it means to catch by
[1:18:04] bait and any good fisherman knows you're
[1:18:07] only as good as a bait that you're
[1:18:10] using you're only as good as a bait
[1:18:12] you're using I know of a I know of a
[1:18:14] story one time of an oldtime that used
[1:18:17] to go up there in the mountains and he
[1:18:19] and he he would go up there after him
[1:18:20] native trout and he would take maybe his
[1:18:23] grandson with him or or or somebody in
[1:18:24] his family he'd take them up there and
[1:18:27] and you had to use certain type of baits
[1:18:28] when you was fishing after them native
[1:18:30] Native fish and you had to have certain
[1:18:33] things and all the elements everything
[1:18:35] just right according to the state laws
[1:18:36] and I don't really know all that cuz I
[1:18:38] ain't necessarily done all that native
[1:18:40] trout fishing but I believe you can ask
[1:18:41] somebody in here but there there was
[1:18:44] there was there he be to he be to go out
[1:18:47] and maybe the grandson come back didn't
[1:18:48] have no fish but the granddaddy come
[1:18:50] back and he had all kinds of fish he
[1:18:53] said now tell me what are you doing
[1:18:55] different than I'm doing and he took him
[1:18:56] over and began to stomp on a little
[1:18:58] thing the grubs fell out you ain't
[1:18:59] necessarily supposed to do that and I
[1:19:01] don't know anybody and I ain't calling
[1:19:02] nobody a name that would do that but I
[1:19:04] do know that there are people in the
[1:19:05] past that would do that this man had
[1:19:07] been out there fishing with the wrong
[1:19:09] type of bait what he was supposed to be
[1:19:10] and he didn't catch anything but this
[1:19:12] man had a secret and he had the ability
[1:19:15] to go in there and catch those fish and
[1:19:18] and Peter knew of anybody Peter knew of
[1:19:20] anybody that knew how to fish Peter knew
[1:19:22] how to fish and he's standing there in
[1:19:24] second Peter chapter 2 and 14 he said
[1:19:26] having eyes of full of adultry then that
[1:19:29] cannot cease from sin beg galing
[1:19:31] unstable Souls so Peter begins to tell
[1:19:34] us that there are men that are full of
[1:19:36] adul tre that cannot cease from sin and
[1:19:39] they immediately entice or catch by bait
[1:19:42] unstable Souls you watch somebody that
[1:19:45] maybe it's the weakest of Christians
[1:19:46] they're always attracted to to different
[1:19:49] things or unstable in their soul it's
[1:19:51] easy sometimes it seems like it's easier
[1:19:54] for Satan to get a hold of them weaker
[1:19:55] ones than it does them that them
[1:19:58] stronger ones that's been in there a
[1:19:59] long time but Satan knows that if he can
[1:20:02] entice you by the right kind of bait and
[1:20:04] you know Satan's real slick he's real
[1:20:07] slick in what he's doing he's been doing
[1:20:08] this for 6,000 years so he knows and he
[1:20:11] studied your family history and he knows
[1:20:13] there are things that are laying there
[1:20:15] so he realizes that if he if he sees you
[1:20:17] going this way and you're going Full
[1:20:19] Speed Ahead in the right direction oh
[1:20:22] Satan's got to do is come to you in the
[1:20:25] other direction with the right kind of
[1:20:26] enticement and he can turn you
[1:20:29] around so Satan has the ability to study
[1:20:33] you and you watch a daddy you watch a
[1:20:36] daddy or aead of a home that's always
[1:20:38] carnal always thinking about carnal
[1:20:40] things always thinking about always
[1:20:42] thinking about things of of of Nature
[1:20:44] and never thinking about spiritual
[1:20:46] things you'll find that you'll be that
[1:20:48] those children will be a product of
[1:20:50] their father they will have the
[1:20:52] carnality of their father but you take a
[1:20:54] husband or a head of a home that is
[1:20:56] constantly keeping his family in prayer
[1:20:59] or keeping his family ever before the
[1:21:01] Lord you will watch the children that
[1:21:03] are under the in influence of that
[1:21:06] father that they'll be praying children
[1:21:08] they'll be reading Bible kind of
[1:21:10] children there'll be people that love
[1:21:12] the message what is it Satan knows that
[1:21:15] if he can ever trap somebody in that
[1:21:17] type of carnality he can keep them there
[1:21:20] he has studied he has studied God's
[1:21:22] children for so long he knows that if
[1:21:24] there's somebody that has dealt with all
[1:21:26] kinds of enticements of lust all he's
[1:21:29] got to do is show them the wrong kind of
[1:21:32] AD and immediately that their mind
[1:21:34] begins to think on those things and they
[1:21:36] have such a hard time getting out of it
[1:21:39] because of their carnality but you put
[1:21:42] Satan Satan can put those same ads right
[1:21:45] in front of a born again son and
[1:21:46] daughter of God and it won't inflict
[1:21:48] pain on him it won't inflict bad
[1:21:50] thoughts on him why because he got
[1:21:52] something that he's anchored on
[1:21:55] to that's why James would say in James
[1:21:57] 1:14 but every man is tempted when he's
[1:22:00] drawn away after his own lust and
[1:22:03] enticed he's literally drugg off by his
[1:22:06] own passions Paul would say in Romans
[1:22:08] 7:11 he said for sin Tak an occasion by
[1:22:11] commandment deceive me deceived me and
[1:22:15] it slew me when you look up that word in
[1:22:17] in the Greek expat it means to cheat to
[1:22:21] thoroughly to dece
[1:22:23] the thought is to be completely deceived
[1:22:25] as to accept falsehood for the truth and
[1:22:29] Paul said for sin taken occasion by
[1:22:32] commandment it deceived me it looked
[1:22:34] right that's right the law looked right
[1:22:38] but it did not have the grace to unlock
[1:22:40] me from my sin it was a deceiving it was
[1:22:43] a deceiving carnal commandment that's
[1:22:46] why the Book of James would say in James
[1:22:48] 1 and22 but be ye doers of the word and
[1:22:51] not hearers only deceiving your own self
[1:22:55] when you look up that word in the in the
[1:22:57] Greek a par parazo it means to
[1:23:01] miscalculate to be imposed upon it
[1:23:04] refers particularly to being
[1:23:06] beged by mere
[1:23:10] probability by mere probability that
[1:23:12] word probability means it has the
[1:23:14] appearance of
[1:23:18] Truth is be ye doers of the word and not
[1:23:21] hearers of the word only deceiving your
[1:23:24] own self so you don't want to just look
[1:23:27] like a Believer you don't want to just
[1:23:29] talk like a Believer you don't want to
[1:23:31] just dress like a Believer you want to
[1:23:34] be a believer you want to do like a
[1:23:36] Believer you see there are a lot of
[1:23:38] people that sit around the skirts of the
[1:23:40] message or the fringes of the message
[1:23:42] and they want to stick close enough just
[1:23:44] to get the blessings of the message
[1:23:46] William brandham said that's more
[1:23:47] dangerous than going out there and
[1:23:51] sinning you see because people have the
[1:23:54] ability to play the part of a h
[1:23:56] hypocrite but probability is the
[1:23:59] appearance of the right kind of
[1:24:01] agreement but maybe I'll just put this
[1:24:03] in my kind of words unpracticed truth is
[1:24:06] no better than denying the
[1:24:09] word unpracticed truth is no better than
[1:24:12] denying the word so you can know the
[1:24:14] word you can have the word and never act
[1:24:17] on the word or cause a reaction to the
[1:24:19] word it's no better than denying the
[1:24:21] word is that okay in my hillbilly kind
[1:24:23] of a language so it it means it means if
[1:24:27] you got what you got take what you got
[1:24:30] and do something with
[1:24:32] it that's just like King Saul he was a
[1:24:35] servant of the most high God the
[1:24:37] Israelites were the children of Promise
[1:24:39] they had all the Commandments on their
[1:24:40] side they had a covenant on their side
[1:24:42] they had circumcision on their side but
[1:24:44] they didn't do nothing with that giant
[1:24:46] that was in their way what were they
[1:24:48] doing they were hearers and not doers
[1:24:50] but the ears of David Avid walked into
[1:24:53] the camp one day he was not just a
[1:24:55] hearer only but he was a doer of the
[1:24:57] word of God and when Satan came against
[1:24:59] David it was a hit on
[1:25:02] collision it was a h on collision
[1:25:05] because Satan was running
[1:25:07] headlong he was going along with his
[1:25:09] plan but when David stepped into the
[1:25:12] camp Hallelujah it was a head on
[1:25:15] collision there's one thing they taught
[1:25:17] me about football I never was too good
[1:25:20] at it but what they did teach me they
[1:25:22] said now look you are lacking what your
[1:25:25] brother
[1:25:27] has but your brother is lacking what you
[1:25:30] have all I had on my side was a quick
[1:25:32] step and they taught me this I was small
[1:25:36] I'm trying to get back down that body
[1:25:38] weight one more time I highly doubt I
[1:25:39] ever see it again maybe my glorified
[1:25:42] body but they taught me
[1:25:45] this because you got a quick step the
[1:25:48] harder you hit them the harder their
[1:25:50] fall they taught me that that if you
[1:25:53] they might be bigger than you they might
[1:25:55] they might have more power than you but
[1:25:56] if you can learn how to make the right
[1:25:59] kind of collision rate at the right
[1:26:01] speed you can knock them right where
[1:26:03] they
[1:26:04] belong and maybe you might be weak in
[1:26:07] faith or maybe you might be small in
[1:26:09] your own mind but if you can just have
[1:26:11] the right Collision rate if you can have
[1:26:14] the right signs to it all maybe you
[1:26:16] don't understand the elements but maybe
[1:26:18] the results is what you're looking
[1:26:21] for
[1:26:23] well Glory little is much if God is in
[1:26:26] it the Bible said that there is a day
[1:26:28] when they despise the day of small
[1:26:30] things this is maybe a little bride but
[1:26:33] she's not weak in strength she's strong
[1:26:36] in almighty
[1:26:39] God was it they had everything they had
[1:26:42] need of but they wern't doing anything
[1:26:44] with it and that's many times the way
[1:26:47] that so many so-called Christians want
[1:26:49] to do they want to do something but they
[1:26:52] don't want to take what God give
[1:26:55] them and do something with
[1:26:58] it but brother bandam said that's what
[1:27:00] we need tonight is to get somebody who
[1:27:03] will take what you got and put it into
[1:27:06] action it might be something that you
[1:27:08] don't even want to do it might be it
[1:27:11] might be something so far off that you
[1:27:13] don't even want to pursue you know that
[1:27:16] Jeremiah got in the same spot a prophet
[1:27:18] of the Lord he had got tired of people
[1:27:21] re rejecting him he got tired of people
[1:27:24] turning down his message and said Lord
[1:27:26] I'm no longer going to speak in your
[1:27:28] name I'm no longer going to talk in your
[1:27:30] name I'm not going to do it
[1:27:36] Lord and we get so
[1:27:40] territorial so
[1:27:42] territorial about
[1:27:46] us that well if it ain't something I
[1:27:48] want to do I don't know if I'm going to
[1:27:50] do it
[1:27:52] and we get so territorial about well
[1:27:55] that person got prayed for and I didn't
[1:27:56] get prayed for or you know there C
[1:27:59] there's certain time there's certain
[1:28:00] people I I typically have a choice in
[1:28:03] this kind of if I got anybody treats me
[1:28:06] like this I'll just go ahead and decide
[1:28:08] to walk away from them kind of people
[1:28:10] but you ever had them kind of friends
[1:28:12] that were territorial about you that if
[1:28:14] they were your friend you were the only
[1:28:15] friend that they could
[1:28:20] have them's a kind of friends you need
[1:28:22] to drop and walk walk away like a bad
[1:28:26] habit but so many times we get
[1:28:29] territorial about our space or what we
[1:28:31] want to do in the kingdom of God or in
[1:28:33] the economy of God well I don't want to
[1:28:35] go out and pray for that sister I know
[1:28:37] how bad she's
[1:28:39] been Jeremiah said God I'm not going to
[1:28:42] no longer talk in your name I'm not
[1:28:43] going to speak in your name but then he
[1:28:46] said these words it was like a fire shut
[1:28:49] up in my bones that I couldn't keep my
[1:28:51] mouth shut
[1:28:52] even when it's things you don't want to
[1:28:54] do and you don't want to pursue God has
[1:28:57] the ability because Jeremiah knew that
[1:29:00] obedience was greater than
[1:29:02] sacrifice he knew against his own will
[1:29:05] against his own wants he wanted to obey
[1:29:08] almighty
[1:29:12] God so many times we get in our realm or
[1:29:16] our walk or our talk and our ideas and
[1:29:19] we just don't want to do it but when God
[1:29:22] speaks to you when God puts that
[1:29:24] pulsation on the inside of you that's
[1:29:27] why William Brandon would say he said
[1:29:28] you give me a church that's so
[1:29:30] completely Anointed with God to their
[1:29:31] every action and move as thus sayith the
[1:29:33] Lord and walk in that sh kind of Glory
[1:29:36] he said I'll show you a messiah an
[1:29:38] anointed one of God that is standing
[1:29:40] upon the
[1:29:42] Earth you see now Jesus would stand
[1:29:44] there when he would preached to us the
[1:29:46] parable of the swer that went out to sow
[1:29:49] his seed and he sowed it and the Bible
[1:29:51] said that some fell on good ground and
[1:29:53] some fell on Stony ground and some fell
[1:29:55] by the wayside William bandham said you
[1:29:58] first have got to let the word fall in
[1:30:01] the right type of faith and he said
[1:30:03] every seed will produce its kind if it's
[1:30:06] put in the right kind of atmosphere and
[1:30:09] under the right kind of condition you
[1:30:11] see if you put the right kind of a seed
[1:30:13] no Farmers PL planting corn thinking
[1:30:16] he's going to get strawberries he's
[1:30:17] planting it in the right condition if
[1:30:20] there is that kind of misconception in
[1:30:23] the seed it's somebody that's pulled a
[1:30:25] trick on him and when you watch as that
[1:30:28] old Slicker slipped out there after the
[1:30:30] Good Men went out there and threw good
[1:30:32] seed out there then the black man or the
[1:30:35] man in the black hood went out there and
[1:30:38] threw out tears into the
[1:30:40] field the owner of the field knew that
[1:30:44] there was a trick that had been played
[1:30:46] and you might feel like the attack of
[1:30:49] the enemy of throwing tears in your
[1:30:51] family family and cancer in your family
[1:30:53] and destruction in your family that it's
[1:30:55] an attack against you but you've got the
[1:30:57] picture completely wrong the attack is
[1:31:00] against the owner of the field and the
[1:31:02] owner of the field is obligated to make
[1:31:05] sure that the tears and the weak grow
[1:31:08] together at the right
[1:31:11] process don't you try to get rid of it
[1:31:14] the owner the angels will make sure to
[1:31:18] get rid of the tears in your life
[1:31:26] that tear ain't doing nothing you doing
[1:31:28] nothing to you but destroying the
[1:31:30] nutrients that was meant for you it's
[1:31:33] amazing how the carnal impersonators can
[1:31:36] attach themselves brother Randon would
[1:31:37] call them suckers grafted suckers that
[1:31:40] they would be grafted in and they would
[1:31:41] suck the very life out of the line that
[1:31:44] out of the vine that it was meant to be
[1:31:47] what are they doing they're sucking the
[1:31:48] very life out of it what is that terar
[1:31:50] doing all of those nutrients in the
[1:31:52] ground was meant for
[1:31:54] you but they were pulling it out trying
[1:31:57] to make you weaker but what Satan didn't
[1:32:00] realize is there was an angel that was
[1:32:02] watching over your seed the entire time
[1:32:04] that's why we understand the power of
[1:32:06] predestination that we come through all
[1:32:08] kinds of carnalities and all kinds of
[1:32:11] sickness and through all kinds of
[1:32:12] turmoils and snares but God was always
[1:32:16] there he was always
[1:32:20] there you can't release your
[1:32:24] potential living outside of your
[1:32:26] god-given
[1:32:27] privileges you say I want to be blessed
[1:32:29] I want to I I want to I want to be
[1:32:31] blessed God can never bless somebody
[1:32:35] that is not willing to give their
[1:32:37] all but if you're willing to give your
[1:32:40] all if you're willing to give your
[1:32:41] everything God can turn around and bless
[1:32:43] you God cannot bless somebody that robs
[1:32:46] from him he cannot bless somebody that's
[1:32:48] not willing to be his partner and give
[1:32:51] him of 10% of what is rightfully owned
[1:32:54] if you really want to release your
[1:32:56] potential you've got to give God your
[1:32:58] everything you see that's why the eagle
[1:33:01] could never produce his potential down
[1:33:04] there in the chicken pin was because he
[1:33:06] was under the atmosphere of a
[1:33:09] hen and you will never be able to
[1:33:12] produce the right kind of an atmosphere
[1:33:15] living with chickens thinking like
[1:33:17] chickens but oh if you can get in the
[1:33:19] atmosphere of an eagle one time
[1:33:22] I know it might be hard for you to
[1:33:23] understand but you are going so far
[1:33:26] against the grain of things that leoy is
[1:33:28] going to have to push you right out of
[1:33:30] here one of these
[1:33:35] days what is it you're not built for
[1:33:39] that kind of
[1:33:42] growing you're built you're built to
[1:33:45] grow in the
[1:33:48] atmosphere of
[1:33:50] faith
[1:33:53] to be
[1:33:56] continued let's
[1:34:03] stand so if we want everything right the
[1:34:06] right
[1:34:09] atmosphere
[1:34:11] everything we've got to lay out all
[1:34:14] things we've got to labor we've got to
[1:34:18] labor for the right things we've got to
[1:34:20] create the right kind of elements we've
[1:34:23] got to produce the right kind of product
[1:34:26] if we want to be
[1:34:28] considered in the
[1:34:30] whole of
[1:34:33] Fame there's a lot of things that we
[1:34:35] recognize as great art but before it can
[1:34:38] be great art it has to go through the
[1:34:40] Hall of
[1:34:42] critics a lot of people don't want to go
[1:34:44] against and they don't want to they
[1:34:46] don't want to
[1:34:47] stand they can't stand
[1:34:49] rejection amen I always want to be
[1:34:53] accepted on and man I just want to say
[1:34:56] this if we ever live in an age where the
[1:34:59] children of God are ever rejected we're
[1:35:01] living there right now we're rejected on
[1:35:04] every front on every angle Satan is
[1:35:07] against us like never
[1:35:09] before so if you if you if you can't
[1:35:11] stand being rejected well let me tell
[1:35:14] you let me talk to you about a king that
[1:35:17] was the rejected King that should have
[1:35:19] been the most accepted King there ever
[1:35:20] was
[1:35:25] but tomorrow I'll tell you about the
[1:35:27] Collision of the atmosphere that Jesus
[1:35:30] met when he came God richly bless you
[1:35:32] tonight brother Shannon would you sing
