continue remember brother ron sister connie in prayers out of town as well as brother andrew sister katie and the family amen we certainly heard of some wonderful reports of what happened there at the camp you know i was thinking how wonderful it is the world saints is literally going insane and yet our children our young people are having such experiences and getting the holy ghost and this insane generation you talk about light in goshen while the world is groping in darkness and darkness that can be felt and yet you can come god has put the desire in your heart to be in the house of god tonight when you could have been brother shannon in a thousand other places yet god put it in your heart to be here tonight in the presence of god where all things are possible amen god bless you praise the lord jesus isn't he so worthy he's so good he's so worthy and so good and saints let me just say this too as a theme of tonight's sermon we should be the most happiest people on the face of the earth there's not a single reason we should walk around with the frown there's not a single reason why we should walk around with a negative testimony for everything that god has done for us for everything we should be the most happiest people on the earth we have a promise to get out of here this world does not have a promise to get out of here amen amen god bless you tonight we'll just go in the word thank you musicians if you turn with me to psalm chapter 40. amen psalm chapter 40 with help of the lord i like to speak on a title a subject a new song a new song psalm chapter 40 verse 1 will begin the bible says i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and establish my goings and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such has turned aside to lies many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou has done and thy thoughts which are to us word they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered ain't that the truth sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire mine eyes thou has opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me i delight to do thy will oh my god yea thy law is written in my heart amen let's go to him in prayer the kind heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for this opportunity that we have that we can be gathered father lord with the purchase of your blood father we just ask that you have your way with us lord may meet each and every need father may you go to each and every home father as a word may you come to borrow our address speak to our hearts and may we give you all the praise on and glory for you alone are worthy in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you you're seated i'd like to start also with a quote here the sermon hear ye him brother abraham said think of it when jesus comes and the redeemed stands there singing those redemption songs kind of like amazing grace like we just saw angels will be circled around the earth with bowed heads not knowing what we're talking about they never need redeeming they don't know what it means to be lost and be found but we was lost and we're found and we sing the redemption story tens of thousands times thousands with their hands up singing the redemption stories while we'll crown while we're crowning him king of kings and lord of lords when the angels with their heads bowed around the earth oh what a day what a day amen now brother braham teaches us that before god god is an object of worship amen so before god was even god he had to create something to begin to worship him and that is what made him god and affect god so the first thing that he created was the angels and the cherubims and they began to worship him as god and that made him god and then god the genesis story begins and god begins creating the heavens and the earth and everything that we see so i want us to point out that the angels we understand by the scripture that god created lucifer that lucifer was once he he was he was a bright and shining angel but he began to be lifted up with pride in his heart because we know that sin began in heaven not in the earth so satan went and he's a master of deception and we can never think within ourselves that we can ever outsmart the enemy within ourselves satan is a master of deception we find that he you find that lucifer actually deceived the very angels that seen god create the very angels that seen god say let there be light and there was light and let the earth bring forth seed after yielding after his kind the angels all seen god create yet satan was still able to deceive them into thinking that they that he could make himself greater than god and that is demons and evil spirits are fallen angels the ones that fail for satan's lie but i want us to understand something here with the prophet tells us that satan deceived two-thirds of the angels in heaven to believe of his life now we don't know what number that is but the bible tells us in the book of revelation that there's two hundred thousand thousand demons in the river euphrates that were unleashed to persecute the jews so we know by that number alone and that doesn't include the sicknesses and the evil spirits of torments that there's millions and millions of evil spirits so when these angels fell and listened and were deceived by lucifer god didn't move to save them god let them fall and he was not their redeemer millions and millions of angels fell and god didn't move a muscle for it but then when he made man brother ron preached on the masterpiece last weekend he made man and adam and eve was his masterpiece in the garden of eden the absolute expression the perfection that god had made so adam and eve fell his son fell and when one sun fell god came looking for him god came himself he didn't send another angel he didn't send gabriel he didn't send michael the lord himself came into the garden of eden screaming adam adam where are thou for one son but the millions of angels that fell god didn't move for brother stephen but whenever you fell and you needed a savior you were born a sinner god came looking for you god came the prophet of god picks it up and he says that he came screaming he said and here was the searchings of god walking running up and down through the garden screaming for his lost boy the the god god jesus christ is still screaming for his lost son and daughter of god in every single sermon you hear that's god's voice trying to speak to you because you can be hiding behind the world you hiding behind fig leaves as it was you can be hiding behind religion you could be hiding behind your parents you could be hiding behind church attendance you could be hiding around anything but the voice of god is speaking to you and has come looking for you this evening that is the love of god and if you had been brother josh jones if you would have been the only one that would have failed god would have still done it all if you are the only one sister cassie that needed a prophet sent to you to be restored and you were the only one that believed this message god would have still sent brother brown that's the kind of god we serve millions can go by not care think about god but god cares so much for you that he came himself for you he came himself for you in the garden of eden looking for you one son he was a part of adam one son and god came himself because the angels the angels that stayed in their first estate they don't they've never been sick they've never been lost that is why you can sing amazing grace that is why you can sing amazing grace like they can't because what satan hates how jealous it must make the devil that you have the holy ghost and he doesn't that you have the power within you to create a world and go live on it yet he's desired brother matthew to that that's what his desire was was to be like god so he can't create so he then is a great perverter of god's creation so you have the power that he's always lusted for because in you are in christ before the foundation of the world so you are before god created lucifer you're now god lucifer can't destroy you and you'll be after lucifer how how angry that must make the devil because you were before him you're now and you'll be long after he's gone you will you are with the father before the foundation of the world so a new song comes by experience it's a it's not just a song like like what it's it's a song is something you sing absolutely but a song is also a praise it's a lifestyle it's how you express yourself to the lord it's all a song now god is so vast and he's so inexhaustible there's so much to god to discover you remember brother i'm talking about the fish and you talk about the mouse and the garners of egypt and about how it god is inexhaustible and there's people and good people in the world today that know god is a creator they look around and they enjoy all the beauty of this valley in the mountains or and wherever the oceans and they know god created that but they only know him as a creator they don't know him as a savior so come on up you know him as a creator come up and learn know of him as a savior know of him as a redeemer know of him as a justifier that he will make that he will so forgive you of your sins that it is as though you've never ever done it in the first place and if you're justified in god there's more to him he's a sanctifier he cannot only forgive you for what you've done but he can take the very desire of your heart to do it again and once you know him as a justifier you then know him as a holy ghost filler and there's always something to know of him you trouble strikes the home you then know him as a defender you know him as a conqueror you get sick you then know him as a healer you lose someone is very dear to you you now know him as a comforter he begins to just unfold himself to you and i believe even in the millennium we will continue to learn of him he will continue to unfold himself of him of himself to us the book of revelation tells us that to him that overcometh will i get to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it so brother jim there's a name that he has for you on the other side after you've overcome this age that he's going to reward you with and no one's going to know it but you it's going to have to do with you overcoming brother graham said it could very well be our original names on the lamb's book of life and he's saving that for us and he said he there's always there's going to be a constant eternal unfolding he's just absolutely so wonderful so the first mention of a song in the bible is when moses when they were coming out of the out of the first exodus and they were coming out of egypt they had a red sea experience now redemption god is perfect god does not start something and then not finish it when that masterpiece in the garden of eden started and it fell fl and satan caused it to fall god didn't leave it there he raised it back up so when god starts a work in you he's gonna finish the work he knew so when he took the children of israel out of egypt he took them it has two parts out of and into something so if god takes you out of the world he's not going to just leave you sitting on the fence he's going to take you into christ if he if there was a voice in the center that said come out of her my people then we're to come out of the denominations and come into christ the word he would not tell you to come he would not tell us to call us out of something and then just leave us here he's going to bring us into something so he called israel out of egypt with the intention of bringing them into the promised land so in colossians 1 13 the bible says who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son most of us if not all of us at one point would did not want to be here would not have wanted to be here would not have come wanted to sit down for a couple hours or whatever it is in a church service we would never even dream of the idea you remember brother brown was ready to fight somebody for calling him a baptist preacher telling that he looked like a baptist preacher and then later after his conversion he said it's the greatest compliment someone could give them so we so god delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins so as israel was coming through the red sea egypt god caused heart and pharaoh's heart and we all know the story and they begin to follow them into the red sea but god ordained that path for israel not for egypt that path was god's provided way in that first exodus for his called out people so i'd like to type the red sea this evening with the blood of jesus christ the blood of jesus is not for the devil the blood of jesus is not is not for demons and and wicked spirits the blood of jesus is for people is for whosoever will and that's who the blood of jesus is for so in exodus 14 21 and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by strong east wind all that night and may the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on the right hand and on their left and the egyptians pursued and went in after them in the midst of the sea you talk about a hard-headed devil all them all in plagues that he had already had to to to endure and then he's actually going to think he's going to get them do you know what's often attributed to albert einstein as saying the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over and over again but expect a different result so satan is insane because he's had all the he's been defeated so many times again he tries again yet he tries again yet he tries again he was defeated in the first battle in heaven and he's gonna be defeated at the very end but yet he keeps trying he's insane how many times has he been cast out but he's still gonna try and come back so the devil is truly insane so moses stretched out his hand and we know that that is a sign of victory whenever god told him stretch out your hand and the ocean the red sea is going to go back and destroy the enemy and that is how we destroy the enemies when we give god the praise and we accept we respond to the word and we catch the word and we say thank you lord that is for me that begins to destroy the enemy's ground in our lives because footsteps mean possession and remember whenever he was fighting against the enemy there i think is the amalekites or someone where moses had to have his hand stretched and every time they went down the enemy would start winning but every time they were put up israel was winning so the blood of jesus will destroy every devil that tries to follow you because remember the blood of jesus is so powerful you say the blood of jesus is gone how it's the life behind the blood to add the literal blood of jesus right here and you make sure this is closed and you pour it all over you you pour it all over you it will not sanctify you okay it would not sanctify you the literal blood of jesus remember the romans got the blood on them when they were beating him to death the one that stuck him in the cider with the in the side with that spear got his blood on him but he was not sanctified he was not forgiven but those that believed on him after he done died went to hell conquered hell or raised like us we are the beneficiaries of the blood of jesus christ so satan can't cross the bloodline the blood is for you and your enemy whenever you dip something in the blood of jesus christ and ask god to forgive you god so breaks that apart is as though you've never done it now the blood is not to be trampled on the blood is not to be played with you say what what does playing with the blood mean playing with the blood would mean whenever you just use god as someone to just you do something premeditatingly and then you just use him as someone to just forgive me my sins i'm sorry lord but yet you don't really repent in your heart the blood is not sent for that our lord and savior did not shed his blood for that in the old testament there was something called city of refuge and what that was is god had moses set that up because they were under an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and what would happen is if someone killed someone else the person the victims family with the and friends and associates would then begin to track you down to kill you for it so god had moses throughout whenever he had set up the the promised land he he forwarded to joshua and they set up cities of refuge so in other words it would be called in today's term as like involuntary manslaughter or something that that you actually did kill someone but you had nothing against them there was no history of you ever hating them there was nothing you were trying to take from them you did it accidentally there was a city that you could then run to and there were people there and that would be your protection and the people that were looking for your life they were called the avengers and the avengers could then as long as you could prove that you did not commit premeditated murder in our modern terms you were then safe in the city of refuge but if you if that person did actually commit it in a premeditated way they could take them out and stone them and kill them so the city of refuge the bible tells us in proverbs 18 10 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and is safe you'll find that everything in the bible points to jesus christ you can't get away from it every single every single story every single thing points to our precious lord and savior jesus christ so he is that city of refuge now it's interesting because whenever they were in them city of refuge they had to stay there and live there until the high priest died and then they could go out but the bible tells us that he is in high priests that abideth continually there's never a reason to leave this city a refuge so if tonight if if you are stuck in sin and satan has got you in sin but you don't mean to do it you don't you feel bad but yet satan has got you bound there's hope for you in the city of refuge but once you get in the city of refuge don't keep going in and out because the bible said that he that sins willfully there's no more sacrifice for sin but once you're in this city a refuge you've got to stay there for as long as the high priest is alive and our high priest the lord jesus christ can never die praise the lord so the blood is for you and not for the devil it completely completely annihilates sin in verse 27 and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength from the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the hosts of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them there was no baggage on them when they came over the red sea killed every egyptian that followed them every devil that tries to follow you through the blood of jesus christ cannot get to you because it's your token it's your protection because you know what satan can't walk where you walk devils can't walk where you walk you've been called to a higher order you've been called to a higher walk as i said earlier satan lusts for the power that you possess in your soul if you have a holy ghost he can't get it and it makes him so mad but it makes us so glad so whenever moses was coming through and they in in this ocean just crashed back together and they began to see what god had done for them it inspired the first recorded song in the scriptures and we're going to read it in exodus 15. and see moses moses in israel experienced this journey it was not a second-handed religion they actually experienced the exodus they literally walked on dry ground and they literally seen the bodies of their tormentors floating on the water and that began to give them a new song it began to give them a new utterance of praise and thankfulness for what god had done for them then saying moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea the lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him in habitation my father's god and i will exalt him the lord is a man of war the lord is his name pharaoh's chariots and his hosts have he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone thy right hand oh lord has become glorious in power thy right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy and the greatness of thine excellency has thou and in the greatness of thine excellency has thou overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentenced forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood upright as in heap and the deaths were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them thou this bloweth i win the sea cover them they sink as lead in the mighty waters who is like unto thee oh lord among the gods who is like unto thee glorious and holiness fearful and praises doing wonders thou stretches out thy right hand the earth swallow them thou and i mercy has led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou has guided them in the strength and thy strength unto thy holy habitation the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold upon the inhabitants of palestinia then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm shall they be still as a stone to thy people passover o lord to the people passover which thou has purchased thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established forever the lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea praise the lord amen do you know that song it was mentioned all the way in the book of revelations moses brings it back up and this very event god did such a major event that all like when nate when the spies went over and spied out the land rahab said and admitted that our hearts have melted because of what we heard what god did for you in egypt that story that reputation so preceded them it began to make their enemies be afraid now it's very interesting because moses says the horse and his rider have he thrown into the sea and we know the book of revelations tells us that there's four horse riders there's the white horse there's the red horse the black horse and the pale horse and there's a rider he's an antichrist that gets on these horses and they're they're they wind through the church ages but yet the blood of jesus christ god's mercy to us has overthrown the influence of the horse riders upon our lives we're not deceived the elect cannot be deceived millions of angels were deceived by lucifer but the bride cannot be deceived the bride cannot be deceived the very angels that seen god unfold the planets roll the planets off of his mighty hand yet they were deceived by lucifer but you cannot be deceived you cannot be deceived why because the lord has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea he's got no influence on you the pel horse rider is riding around the land but he's got no influence on you because the lord has overthrown the rider and his seed he's overthrown them into the sea the blood of jesus christ amen praise the lord god looks out for his own god looks out for his own brother and talks about as the eagle stirs her nest and he's and he said let a coyote get after one of them eaglets you watch the mama just flog him to death oh my goodness god is so good now watch what happens whenever moses began to sing this song brother matthew he began to sing this song that began to then inspire others miriam then took the tambourine and she began to shake it and i want us to notice and mary and the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timber on her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances and miriam answer them sing ye to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider have he thrown it to the sea she just said the same thing moses just said because she experienced the same thing moses experienced she went through the red sea of the blood just like moses did now god sent us a prophet in this end time and he was a law giver like moses he went up in the mountain and received commandments of the lord like moses he was a man of the desert like moses he's seen the pillar of fire like moses but yet we have to experience the same thing that he experienced now we're not called to have the same message or or to preach the message that's already been given the fivefold ministry does preach the message but we aren't called for them gifts like he was called but you are called to meet the same god you are called to meet the same i am you are called to meet the same pillar of fire you are called to be cleansed by the same blood you are called to have the same holy ghost god don't love brother brahm no more than he loves you god called him as a as a prophet of the age and that's the prophetic office that he held but he had to overcome in his personal life just like you do and just like i do so miriam is the type of the bride and she then repeats the word that has already been preached sung by a vindicated prophet so whenever the same task masters that moses had was the same task masters that miriam had the same width that my that beat moses when he went back to his brethren was the same width that beat mario the same temper brother branham had to overcome the same temper that some of us have to overcome so whenever they're floating like i can imagine mary man she's as she's running and dancing and whenever she was struck with that inspiration to sing a song to the lord she runs and she and she sees them then they're floating head they're floating face down into the in the water so she picks one of them up and she recognizes them he beat me i remember him she runs over here she picks up this one i remember him what he did to my sister and what do we do in this end time we run on the other side of the blood and we pick up we say that was fear that one used to beat me that right there that's a line spirit and that one that used to have a hold on me that right there it was that's a temper that's a lust spirit but i've been delivered and it begins to give us a song of deliverance it begins to make us shout and praise the lord because we don't we've overcome by the blood of the lamb so it gives us a song because remember brother and said that the bride would be the final voice to the final age under her messenger so miriam was a prophetess just like the bride so when so she repeated the same thing brother she repeated the same thing brother moses said and she had the same victory that he had she had the same victory she experienced the same salvation same born-again experience we experienced the same born-again experience that brother branham had do you know whenever jacob whenever he was running from the lord up until he wrestled with that angel he was on god was only the god of abraham and isaac jacob didn't know him as the god of abraham isaac and himself and jacob it took a wrestling with the angel and he then began then he knew god as abraham and not not just his dad and grandparents grandpa's the god but as his god we can't know this message just by the god of our the message of our parents the message of our pastors the message of the ministry we've got to know this as our message it is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever same salvation same holy ghost we've got to find our place in the same book just like brother brahm did we've got to find our name written in the book just like he did because remember it's a family album god cannot be separated from his word in the old testament god gave moses the tabernacle of witness and he had it set up and it was a reflection of heaven there was there was there was a holy of holies and there was a laver and you can find all this terminology all the way in the book of revelations you'll find that the word what you find in genesis you'll find all the way in revelation and that that is how the that's how the truth works it's like a scarlet thread so the ark was something that was very well guarded for israel it was something that was very sacred the ark was very sacred by the mark because the ark contained the word and whenever they said of the tabernacle of witness that is where the pillar of fire would come down and it would settle over where the word was which is where the law that god gave to moses up in the mountain they put it in that ark and god would come down and he'd begin to speak to moses so the ark was actually israel's secret to success in their battles they would always take the ark with them they would always take the ark and whenever they wouldn't have the ark like whenever the spies went out to spy the land they said we can't do it we can't do it there and i think it's number 14 they then once god pronounced judgment and said for every day you went over there for 40 days to spy out the land you're going to wander through this wilderness for 40 years well then the unbeliever started feeling really bad if he got so convicted but god had already spoken it so they then said okay we're very sorry we're going to go up there and we're going to go we're going to attack in the morning moses said don't do it they went up there they presumed they went up there themselves without the ark and they were killed the ark was israel's the enemy was always trying to capture the ark because it contained the word and the word is our secret weapon just like samson he had an azerite vow of his hair our nazarite vow is the word that is where satan got eve is when she got off the word that's where the only way that satan could ever get to any one of us is get off that word as long as you stay behind that word satan can't touch you so during the days of eli they're in first and second samuel the ark was actually captured they began to let down the bars eli was a priest and he began to he he began to turn his head his sons were doing very evil things and taking bribes and things and he was turning his head at what his sons were doing and he wasn't upholding the word like he should have so the the the story goes the philistines came and they actually took the ark and it caused israel to get demoralized so bad but after a while the ark was then the god plagued the philistines for taking the ark and then it began to be to work its way back to israel you can read about it like i said first and second same it began to work its way back into israel but it wasn't ever in quite in divine order like it was at the beginning it was in people's houses or it was here or it was there well david became king and became anointed and after a while god put in david's heart i want the ark back in its place you know david david said i live in a cedar house i live in a wood house and it's wonderful and i'm so comfortable and how is that that the ark of my god is just thrown about so he had a desire to bring the ark of the lord back so when one whenever he had everything set up and they were bringing they were bringing the ark back david got a little excited david actually got very excited and he danced for 17 miles because the word was being restored now we know that david was a great psalmist so whenever he seen that the word after all these years was coming back to the place where it was supposed to be he got excited people wonder what we're so excited about is because we see the word and it is returned back to its place it's been a restoration of the word it's it's been in the land of the philistines and denominations long enough it's now come back to its place it's come back to the original that's what we're so excited about in first chronicles 15 so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obedient with joy and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams and david was was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bear the ark and the singers in chennai the master of the song with singers see there's always songs there's always worship david also had upon him an ephod of linen thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the coronet and with trumpets and with symbols making a noise with sultries and harps and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david that mikhail the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart she seen as david the king was he was supposed to be a dignified king and he was over there showing off his legs and dancing and shouting and embarrassing her do you know the prophet of god said that and the bible also speaks that god closed her womb god cursed her for doing that and there's people that criticize this message there's people that criticize are rejoicing over the open word and god closes their spiritual womb they can't receive seed anymore they can't receive the word the spoken word is the original seed and they just go out into the world because they're critical because we're rejoicing because the word has been restored that's something if i'll say this because i feel impressed to say it if you ever get over the revealing of the word and the restoration of the word you have backslidden that is something that you should never ever get over that's right the prophet of god called revelations 5 when he came i don't know hopefully we'll get to it when he came and took the book as the most sublime scripture in all the bible is when he came and took that book because if he hadn't done that we wouldn't be here so the ark was a representation of god in their midst brother brahm in the church age book said he's quoting he said i am the word jesus speaking if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone or anything get between you in that word if you want god in your home get the word if you want god in your life receive the word because the spirit will channel itself through the word he said that which i'm giving you the word is a revelation of myself i am the word remember that i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst because remember true emotion emotion is not an evidence of anything you had in the old testament whenever israel came out and they made remember moses was in the mountain and they got aaron to make that that uh idol and they were all dancing and shouting and just having such a good time at the idol god wasn't in that the 400 hebrew the 400 prophets in israel whenever they had that mount uh carmel showdown over there they were cutting themselves and jumping up and down and being emotional emotion is not an evidence it is a side effect our emotion is word based now whenever the word gets you to shouting and jumping and and praising the lord you've got something but we don't major on the emotion but we certainly because remember if your religion ain't got some emotion some life in it brother and said you should bury it we have we believe in emotion but that's not the evidence of anything the evidence is the life that you live whenever we receive the word whenever you receive the word it then bears fruit that's the evidence because remember even jesus when he came he said in vain they do worship me in vain so if you're writing scriptures down you can read after after this after the the ark comes back in first chronicles 16 david there writes a song you'll find there's so many examples and there's so many we're not going to get to because the sake of time but there's so many examples whenever the word comes back god does something it then causes a stir to that generation it starts a revival to that generation they write songs about it i appreciate songs and i love singing but there's something special about a song that's written by someone in the bride have y'all ever experienced that that it's something so special like you you get blessed and many times people get under such the inspiration of say the nominal church and they get inspired and they write they pin a song and then when a person gets up here and sings it it takes on a whole new meaning because there's a life behind that song that's the key so after so first chronicles 16 you can read more about the david song but then one day solomon he built a temple for the lord and it took seven years to build that temple just like it took seven church ages for god to rebuild his temple remember the final the final revelation of the word ends up in flesh that's where god wants to dwell god's plan is not to dwell in buildings god's plan he's unfolding himself and he allowed it but he's getting closer and closer to flesh so the word that the ark jesus christ type the ark so when he died and sent back the holy ghost now we can all be like like many arks if you will we can all have the word of god within us and we can have the pillar of fire over our own lives because of the holy ghost so when solomon is dedicating the temple he begins to pray and he has everything in order and you can you can read about it in second chronicles five and the second kings eight i believe it is and then they have everything in order and it took seven years and everything is just so perfect and then solomon goes to dedicate the temple in the second chronicles chapter 5 verse 13 and it came to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard and praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth forever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house that's exactly what happened brother mark whenever moses dedicated the temple the same thing happened the glory of god came down and they couldn't even stand to minister that sounds like acts 2. on the day of pentecost and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all in one accord in one place and there suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them cloven tongues like has a fire and it sat upon each one of them and they begin to stagger and to act like drunk people they couldn't even stand under that presence of god that dropped down that is the fulfillment of what happened in solomon's temple that this right there in acts 2 that is what god wants that is god's desire and you that's been filled with the holy ghost that is god's desire that it was his desire from the very beginning that is why he went immediately down to adam and eve and he promised them that he would come in flesh right there in the garden of eden he didn't wait he promised that he'd come immediately he gave the promise of the savior there in the garden of eden immediately because he was not going to have his masters his masterpiece spoiled the bride of jesus christ is god's masterpiece she's been struck out of the churches she's been kicked out nobody wants nothing to do with her she's called fanatic she's called a cult she's called the branamite she's called all men holy roller all manner of evil things she's called but that doesn't change the fact that doesn't change a fact because do you remember whenever moses whenever michelangelo struck that brother ron had it right up here remember whenever michelangelo struck the knee what did he say he said speak what does revelations 10 tell us that brian's going to do prophesy again struck out of the church struck out of the world nobody wants her but she's speaking the bride's got something to say she's got something to say it's something that was already been said under her messenger but she's got something to say you know david in psalm 137 this was before they were carried off in babylon but david picked up picked up on it in prophecy form it's very important it'd be very good for you to understand the history of israel because she had the presence of god in her she then backslid and was carried away into captivity into babylon and then after 70 years god promised brother gabriel that she would return back to her original land so that is an exact type of this bride that is an exact type of our journey as the bride that on the day of pentecost they had the unadulterated word of god then the antichrist spirit began to work and influence the word and men begin to inject their own ideas and it got so bad in the dark ages imagine this it got so bad in the dark ages people couldn't even read the bible for themselves the catholic church seen it seen it in their best interest to keep people from reading the word so the only way the common people like us would know what the word said is when a priest got up to tell us what the word said that's right so if the priest got up and said you've got god said that you've got to come and you've got to confess all your sins to me or you've got to give whenever whenever you die you got to leave what you have left to the church or you've got to do this or do that or do this and do that in the other the people didn't know because the bible was written in latin that is what made the reformation such an earth-shaking praise the lord wonderful thing amen that's what made it a wonderful thing that that's that's what made it go out like that okay because all of a sudden martin luther took it upon himself to begin to translate the bible into the common people's language which was german so then people could then begin to get the bible for themselves and say wait a minute i don't have to confess my sins to you the bible tells me that the just shall live by faith and he's the one that gives me the salvation not the church so that began a reformation so god began restoring the church and in the end time god then sent this message god then sent a prophet to restore all the truths that have been hidden because remember the amount of faith that you have the amount of word that's been given for a certain age is directly tied to the amount of faith they can have martin luther didn't have all the words so he couldn't take a rapture john wesley didn't have all the words so they couldn't take a rapture the pentecostals didn't have all the word they had more but they didn't have all of it take the rapture we've got all of it revealed to us that is why we can take a rapture because we have the faithful rapture it's a rapturing faith and a rapturing message to give to take us out of here so in psalm 137 david picks up in prophecy form that they're going to be carried over to babylon he said by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion how shall we sing the lord's song in a strange land you can't sing this song in the world you can't sing the song of this glorious message in the denominational church it's not the people it's the system that's keeping them bound that's why god sent us a voice in that since time in time that said come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins because the churches the church world is judged and the bible uses does not pull any punches on what kind of woman she is now i'm gonna say something strong but you adults will understand okay the church why does god call her an ill-famed woman because the womb for a married woman is only meant for the seed of her husband that's it so the church spiritually speaking is supposed to only receive the original spoken word seed of god but what does she do like an ill-famed woman she lets every kind of man's seed come in her do you see the spiritual application so god pulls no punches he's got judgment waiting for her so the call is now to come out of the system we have no law but love no creed but christ and no book of the bible there's no book there's no kind of membership for us to join there's no nothing freely as you come freely give free we just we believe god's word and we believe this message with all our hearts i'm just going to mention the scripture here y'all can i don't think we're going to get to it but as in ezra 3 when they're laying down the foundation again of the house how the people rejoice and they begin to to sing unto the lord they rejoice because they see god's order coming back in ephesians 2 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly joined fitly frame together groweth into a holy temple in the lord see you're god's holy temple you're god's holy temple the presence of god is in this place because you brought him that is why he's in this place in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit in john 14 god jesus says and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth and the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither know with him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you see god condescending down being to be one of the original nobody would be a jude and nobody wants to be a judas to be the original 11 one of the 11 disciples would be a wonderful thing but having him in you is a whole lot better than having him with you they experienced that on the day of pentecost think you can love your spouse so much brother jerry you can you can you can love your spouse so much but but yet there's another level god loved us so much but yet you cannot live in them but god takes it to another level and he can live in you and that's what the holy ghost is is the life of god in you yet a little while i love this yet a little while and the world seeth me no more the world they don't want god they don't see god but yet as i said at the beginning of the service yet we're enjoying the praises and the blessings and the presence of god and he's changing our lives he's changing us out there the little hell has come up has come off so if the bible says that when the enemy comes in like a flood and the spirit of god raises the standard against it so if hell has come up and the enemy has come in like a flood then there's got to be a standard against it and that means heaven has come down that means heaven has come down in the form of his word to incarnate you the bride now one day there was a young teenage girl and we talked a lot about her and we should but her name was mary and she was walking one day and just doing the mundane just going to work in her way just doing about her daily chores nothing out of the ordinary but she met she had a very different morning that morning she met an angel of god and she believed that angel and she believed the word that the angel had had spoken to her now she had a cousin and she had a cousin her name was elizabeth and she was pregnant with john at that time but there was no movement john was basically dead in her womb but yet mary because she believed the word of an angel she went and she testified of what the angel had told her the angel came and said hail mary and you know the story and begin to talk to her and begin to to go into the scripture about a virgin shall conceive and mary said be it unto me according to your word and she went and she repeated what the angel told her to her cousin elizabeth and it brought her life it brought elizabeth life because remember the angel told the angel gabriel which types brother branham came to the virgin mary and told her the word mary believed the word and she believed the spoken word and she literally conceived by hearing the spoken word that is how we receive the word that is how we bear jesus christ our generation is by receiving the word from an angel so then we go so mary goes and she's all excited and she goes to her cousin elizabeth and she says that you know i met an angel and and he told me that i'd have a baby without knowing no man and that his name was jesus and as soon as elizabeth heard the name jesus she was filled with the holy ghost so was john in in her womb and it brought life to her because she repeated the same testimony the same word that she received from an angel and it brought life and the holy ghost to a dead woman that's what the bride ministry does can't you see it the final voice under her messenger is the final voice of the final age and as the word is preached you receive the word and it brings life to you because you receive the word life channels through the word and then it brings about a praise it brings about a new song what kind of song do you think brother ron's gonna have after his body lines up to the word what kind of song do we have if you've gotten the holy ghost and the life that you live you've got a whole brand new testimony you've got a whole brand new song what kind of song do you have when you're when your kids come to the lord what kind of song do you have whenever your child receives the holy ghost what kind of song do you have whenever your loved ones are healed whenever you're healed god with every victory god gives a song because you even find mary after she got pregnant by the spoken word of an angel she had a song the bible scofield calls it magnificat which means an utterance of praise let's read it luke 1. and mary said 146. and mary said my soul just magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoice in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold all from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty has done in to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation and he hath showed strength with his arm he had scattered the proud on the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he had filled the hungry with good things and the rich yet sent away empty he hath hope and his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed forever once she received the word of an angel that caused her to rejoice that caused her to have a new song that caused her to give glory and praise to god because she realized that the old testament prophecy was now going to be revealed through her how many scriptures and stories speak of a rapture but it's going to be revealed through you you will be you the people of the open book are the people of the rapture typed all the way to enoch 6 000 years ago about 4 000 you had a man of god on the earth that so pleased god with his faith god took him he was a representation of a multitude of people because remember mary had to believe something sister stephanie that has never been done before we're believing something that's never happened to a multitude of people before abraham was turned young but he went by the way of the grave elijah was translated but he was old we're going to be changed there's going to be the resurrection we're going to be changed and then we're literally going to ascend up and meet the lord in the air we're that people we're that people and it's never happened before but we believe it anyway it's never happened before it's easy to believe something after it's happened it's easy to believe in the man christ jesus 2000 years later for most people for a lot for multitudes of people but what about the jesus this message what about the god of this message that is him but whenever he came manifested we want moses we want his law we don't want nothing to do with you and they picked up stones to stone him when moses was the prophet of the hour they picked up stones to to kill moses it's easy to love and serve a god of history but the god of the present that's that's where the faith is that takes the grace of god let's read revelations 5 we begin to close and i saw on the right hand of him that sat in the right hand of him that sat on a throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wet much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david had prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof do you realize that if god that jesus christ had not come and taken the book to open the seals we'd all be lost abraham isaac jacob they'd all be lost because they were all redeemed all their names are in this lame's book of life and it took a kinsmen redeemer no man was worthy whenever whenever whenever john looked whenever the eyes of god looked there was no man worthy to open the book he looked at elijah he looked at noah looked at moses they looked at enoch they looked at you they looked at me no man was worthy that is why john cried cried cried but then all of a sudden there came a voice that said weep not john we found one that was worthy not three one we found one that was worthy to open the book to loose the seals thereof so if he opened the book and he loosed the seal there had to be a prophet on the earth who the word of the lord comes to to receive that word and give it to the people because that is god's divine plan is that the word of the lord comes to a prophet so god's prophet had to be on the earth to receive the revelation of the word in verse six and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth until the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayer of the saints listen to this now this is the redeemed and they sung a new song not the song that was sung during even the church ages they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred in tongue and people and nation and has made us into our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth i find it very interesting that when brother ran preached salon shalom and he takes that prophecy out of isaiah and he said behold great darkness is upon the face of the earth but behold thy light has come remember that sermon and he talks about there being darkness in egypt but yet light and goshen all at the same time do you know that brother ram said that the most pitiful scripture in the entire bible and over you think about the resurrection i'm sorry you think about the crucifixion you think about how dreadful that was but yet he said the most dreadful scripture the most pitiful scripture in the entire bible is this lady of sin church age where christ is outside of his church knocking trying to get back in you say how is god outside of his own church they say i love jesus and they sing praises but they deny this is how he's outside of the church when they reject the word they reject him there's you cannot separate god from his word they rejected they said i love moses i love moses and they were they they were in there offering sacrifices old testament worship but yet the real lamb of god was on the cross dying they had rejected the word the denominational churches have done the same thing christ is outside so in the at the exact same time you've got the most pitiful scripture in the entire bible and you have the most sublime scripture in the entire bible which the prophet said was him coming to take the book at the same time we're rejoicing we're having a new song over the most sublime portion of scripture in the entire bible and the world is gripping with the most pitiful picture of the entire bible all at the same time all at the same time and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels in revelations 5 11. round many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was 10 000 times ten thousand and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing in every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them hurt i sand john said all the creation heard john rejoice and people don't believe in rejoicing over the word could you imagine brother matthew whenever the wise men came looking for the king of the jews looking for that baby they seen his star in the east and they came to worship him when they came in jerusalem could you imagine if they were just hey uh where is he that's born king of the jews i'm a little embarrassed but i heard he's on the earth don't don't talk too loud but i think he's somewhere here have you seen him let me know but just write me a note don't don't say nothing because i'm embarrassed they said no they said where is he that's born king of the jews they stirred the whole city and they said what the whole jerusalem had no idea but yet you had three wise men come in want to know where jesus was where's the word made flesh where's the word that's manifested that's promised to be in this hour where is it i want to see it i want to worship him nothing to be ashamed of whenever jesus came into jerusalem on that donkey and they were multitudes were spreading out their garments and they had their palms in their hands they're saying shouting hosanna cry the bible said and multitudes that went before and that followed christ saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna to the highest i promise you it wasn't hosanna to the lord blessed is he that come with me it was praising the lord it was praising victory waving their palms you say i don't have a palm yes you do wave that palm hosanna to the king in the highest hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord you're waving that palm in your hand glory to god you want to worship the lord now i'm not trying to get just an emotion out of you i want you to appreciate and to realize what god has done for us in this end time i want you and us to appreciate and have a and be to be sensitized to what god has done for us in this end time now i'm not going to read it because we're running out of time but if you'll put down in revelations 18 and brother stephen you sung i thought it was wonderful you sung about this a couple weeks ago about the babylon the greatest fallen has fallen do you know the prophet of god said that that is actually the seventh church age messenger that's calling out the spirit of god through him that's calling out to the church to the elect of the age to come out of her my people and the prophet of god said that god was so pleased with what that prophet said that he echoed it in heaven you read it well you know what we'll read it right now amen real fast revelation 18 and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was enlightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great has fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are wax rich through the abundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven that's the voice of god saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our sins and that you receive not of our plagues god is repeating exactly confirming exactly that this seventh age messenger's message is exactly right it is exactly what god echoes from heaven this message is from heaven you just can't get away from it this message is from heaven [Music] brother braham said that god you come to a point and i'm not going to read for the sake of time but i've got a quote here that shows that god can you can god can be so pleased with you and what you say in inspiration that god will echo it that god will be pleased to bring your word to pass rather he will be pleased to honor your word was he pleased to honor sister had he writes word then he'll be he can be whenever you say it not not in our carnal minds not just because we we think of it but whenever inspiration really hits and there's testimonies whenever the inspiration the spirit of god really comes down and something is said and given wesley is getting ready to walk he is making constant improvements he's pulling himself up on his own now and he's actually even we didn't get a chance to get a video of it yet but he's actually walking along the furniture with purpose he's fast he's getting fast so we're getting our running shoes on we're getting our running shoes on amen praise the lord it will come to pass there's no doubt in our minds one last scripture and then we'll close in revelation 14 verse 1 and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount zion and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their hearts and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty four thousand which were redeemed from the earth this is where this entire sermon came from this single scripture when they sung a new song the bible said that no man could learn it but the 144 000 that's the jews whenever we get raptured up this same gospel is going to them and there's 144 000 of them and they've got their own and the bible said and no man can learn that song but the 144 thousand no man can learn the bride song but the bride why because you've experienced it you go through the experience sister charlene and then god gives you the victory song based on your experience that you just had you get the holy ghost and then god gives you a victory song and it don't have to be a song i'm not saying it's a song that you pinned down even though god can inspire you but it's a praise it's a worship it's an admiration it's an appreciation then you know he rose from the dead then you know you met the same pillar of fire that moses met you met the same pillar fire that abraham and isaac and jacob and enoch met you that adam the very one that came and put adam to sleep god came down himself god's jesus christ was the greatest man he was a man's man he knew when to turn the other cheek brother matthew he knew when to do that and he also knew when to start playing ropes and beating the money changers out of there he was a man so whenever adam and eve fell god's great masterpiece he came down himself he didn't send an angel he came down to do the work himself when he came to redeem us he didn't send an angel he came down himself that's my god i mean the musicians can come and if you would at sister cast if you start playing our god is tremendous i love this song this is a bride song right here this is a bribe song and i'm gonna as she's playing i'm gonna before we begin to sing it you can stand with me i like to read the lyrics because as i read the lyrics i want you to think in your own life that have you experienced this tremendous god that's what gets you so excited it's not just an emotional work some psychological emotional work up it's you take this word that is preached every service and then how you go out and live it that is what tells the difference that's the evidence of the holy ghost brother mark is when you believe this word but not just mentally believe it but when you so believe it you prove to the world you believe it by living it it becomes a part of you so as i read these lyrics let's think on them times when you were in need and you called on the lord brother david when you were in that accident you were in need of the lord and you called on him and so did the family so did the church and he came so whenever you sing that your mind can go back to that experience and say when i called on the lord he was there it says when i'm in need i call on the lord and he hears me yes he helps me he is faithful and true won't forget his own he's my companion remember he reveals more and more of himself to you he has proven to be your companion your best friend a bet a friend that sticketh closer than a brother the only true god there's no one
