[10:48] that God's power is still alive in this
[10:51] day?
[10:53] People say that our God still
[10:58] has no power or life.
[11:04] They deny that he's living.
[11:08] [Music]
[11:09] Think this faith is a lie.
[11:15] We can't help that they say things
[11:21] for they do not understand.
[11:27] One prove that reason.
[11:32] Say that he was just a man.

[12:07] that he's done in your life. Glor
[12:14] is not just some story.
[12:19] God's power is alive.
[12:25] There's no purpose in
[12:31] God's voice in this day.
[12:37] I don't need to reason
[12:43] and the world's fing away.
[12:47] Come on now. For we have a vision.
[12:53] No, that's it. And no power can hold us
[12:57] back.
[13:00] Just stay faithful with Jesus
[13:06] and keep you.

[15:38] do you still believe that?
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that this is the message?
[15:43] &gt;&gt; And if you can believe that, there is

[17:09] that have come forth already from this

[17:29] healings, Lord. And Lord, I know my
[17:31] heart's been encouraged. And Lord, but

[17:36] great expectation for what you're about
[17:38] to do, Lord. I believe Lord today that
[17:41] Lord we can just step aside and Lord we
[17:43] always ask that you'll anoint the man of
[17:45] God and I know you will but Lord I'm
[17:47] asking that you'll anoint our ears this
[17:49] morning. You'll anoint our hearts to
[17:50] receive Lord that the word will fall on
[17:52] good ground Lord that it'll take root in
[17:55] the lives of men and women Lord and
[17:57] it'll move beyond something that we know
[17:59] and we understand but it'll move into a
[18:01] place of manifestation in the lives of
[18:03] your people father. Lord, we come today,
[18:06] Lord, as needy people. Recognizing,
[18:07] Lord, we're not like Leoa. We don't say
[18:10] we have need of nothing, but this
[18:11] morning, Lord, we need you, Lord. Lord,
[18:14] we're in need, Lord. But we're thankful
[18:15] that we serve a God who has the answer
[18:17] this morning. Lord, you know every sick
[18:20] and needy. Lord, you Lord, you see the
[18:22] need in our sister McGraw. Lord, I just
[18:23] pray that you'll just move in a mighty
[18:25] way there this morning. Lord, I pray for
[18:27] a good report. And Lord, even beyond
[18:29] that, I'm looking to your report. Lord,
[18:31] I'm looking to a word that says, "By
[18:33] your stripes, we are healed." And I know
[18:35] without any shadow of a doubt that word
[18:37] hasn't lost any of its power. It's good
[18:39] today, Lord, and we stand on it today.
[18:42] We stand faithful today, Lord, expecting
[18:44] you to move, looking for you to take
[18:45] complete control of this service, Lord.
[18:48] There's many people, Lord, gathered this
[18:50] morning. Lord, I know, Lord, your bride
[18:52] around the world is gathering this
[18:54] morning. I pray you'll meet with each
[18:55] and everyone. every group, no matter
[18:57] where they are, Lord. May your presence
[18:58] come and Lord, just be that portion that
[19:01] they have need of today. And we're

[19:05] Lord, may you get in the worship. May it
[19:07] please you, Lord. May may everything we
[19:09] do please you. And then may Lord, you
[19:11] come and just break the bread of life,
[19:13] Lord. Lord, we'll be careful to give you
[19:15] the praise, the glory, and the honor for
[19:17] you alone deserve it. We commit this

[23:13] In a deep dark cave of trouble, a soul
[23:17] was in distress. Evil whispered in my
[23:21] ear.
[23:23] You'd be left for dead in the trial of
[23:27] my life. All I could do was cry. Then

[28:41] And I remember,
[28:45] how you sustained me
[28:49] when you stepped in
[28:52] to save my life.
[28:57] If I knew then
[29:00] what I know now,
[29:04] I would be still
[29:07] and let you work it out.
[29:13] Jesus,
[29:14] [Music]
[29:16] I was toast in the water,
[29:20] but I never went under.
[29:24] You were always on time.
[29:30] And Jesus,
[29:33] when I went through the fire,
[29:37] you were right there beside me. You were
[29:43] always on time.
[29:46] You were always
[29:49] always
[29:52] on time.
[29:55] You were always
[30:00] always on time.
[30:04] And I remember
[30:09] how you carried
[30:11] [Music]
[30:13] when I couldn't
[30:17] take a step.
[30:21] And I remember
[30:24] [Music]
[30:25] how you loved me
[30:29] when I couldn't
[30:34] love myself.
[30:39] Jesus,
[30:42] I was tossed in the water,
[30:46] but I never went under.
[30:50] You were always on time,
[30:55] Jesus.

[31:17] always on time.
[31:20] And you were always
[31:24] [Music]
[31:25] always on time.
[31:28] And you were always
[31:32] always
[31:35] on time.
[31:37] And you were always always
[31:43] on time.
[31:49] There's never been a day, never been a
[31:52] minute, never been a moment that you
[31:56] weren't in it. There's never been a time
[31:59] that you didn't see me through God. So I
[32:03] worship you. There's never been a day,
[32:07] never been a minute, never been a moment

[38:17] we have seen God use them time after
[38:20] time, but not just in the past, but

[45:07] weekend. And Amen. And u and brother

[45:12] we've been praying for Sister

[45:21] Amen. I got out of here Friday night and
[45:23] I really thanked brother Nathan, Sister

[45:28] forgot to say a word about my wonderful
[45:30] wife.
[45:32] Amen. But it's certainly good to have

[45:59] may be the first time I've ever preached
[46:01] and you in the congregation. Amen. Dr.

[46:05] up and he was out there and Amen. And
[46:08] but we we certainly Amen. have had a
[46:10] real brotherhood and friendship. People
[46:12] thinks we're brothers. I say I'm the
[46:14] better looking one, but I'm not sure. I
[46:16] mean, y'all had to make that up, you
[46:18] know. And Amen.
[46:21] I'm the one with the mic, so I'm going

[46:46] Oh, we certainly certainly love him.
[46:48] Isn't it good to be a Christian?
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. just to be able to feel the

[46:54] kind of liberty where you can just feel
[46:56] good about being in the house of God.
[46:58] Amen. Come together with your brothers
[47:00] and love him and Amen. What a wonderful

[47:18] service last night? Amen. Amen. So, we
[47:21] certainly want to if we can uh just turn
[47:24] into the word of the Lord. Of course,
[47:25] you're supposed to have brother Donnie
[47:27] Reagan this morning, and I'm certainly
[47:28] no replacement for brother Donnie, but
[47:30] we certainly just want to give our heart
[47:32] and speak a few things. And um if we
[47:36] can, uh we're going to be looking in the
[47:38] book of Hebrews.
[47:41] And just before we read the word, let's
[47:44] just bow our hearts and speak to the
[47:45] author.
[47:47] Father, we thank you today for your
[47:49] grace.
[47:51] We thank you for your mercy, Lord, the
[47:53] blessing that you have given us.
[47:55] We certainly thank you for these men of
[47:57] God, Lord, for this assembly, for those
[48:00] that have gathered in from other parts,
[48:02] Lord, to make these meetings possible.
[48:05] Lord, we do it for your kingdom. These
[48:08] people put their hearts and their lives
[48:10] and their efforts and their money. Some
[48:12] are here, Lord, have invested lots of
[48:15] funds and Lord, their vacation times and
[48:19] they've set aside this just to come
[48:21] together, Lord, to see the kingdom
[48:23] prosper, Lord, to see this great message
[48:25] we all believe to see it lifted higher.
[48:28] And Lord, and there's many needs here in
[48:30] the building, Lord. We're aware that
[48:32] there's needs of every which kind, but
[48:35] Lord, there is a God we believe this
[48:38] morning to answer those needs. And we
[48:40] want to invite you to make you welcome
[48:43] in this building this morning. Lord, we
[48:45] don't want you here just as a observer,
[48:49] but Lord, we'd like you to come and be
[48:51] Lord. Lord, we'd like you to come and be
[48:53] the healer we know you are. We want to
[48:56] see you move into the hearts, Lord, and
[48:58] be the deliverer, Lord, and bring your
[49:00] mercy upon your people. Now, Father, we
[49:02] invite you to take your word and use it
[49:05] for your glory. In Jesus name we pray.
[49:09] Amen. And amen. And God bless you. If
[49:12] you have your Bibles, we'd like to look
[49:13] into Hebrews chapter 1, verse 13, verse
[49:17] 14.
[49:31] Hebrews 1 verse 13 and verse 14.
[49:35] But to which of the angels said he at
[49:39] any time
[49:40] sit on my right hand until I make thine
[49:43] enemies thy foottool?
[49:45] Are they not all ministering spirits
[49:49] sent forth to minister for them? Who
[49:52] shall be the heirs of salvation? Amen.
[49:56] We'd ask the Lord to bless his word this
[49:58] morning. You could be seated.
[50:00] Uh I I want to take some uh time this
[50:03] morning and speak to you uh about if I
[50:06] would take a title. Let me just title
[50:08] this angelic involvement
[50:10] &gt;&gt; in human affairs.
[50:13] Angel involve involvement in human
[50:16] affairs. Amen. Do y'all believe in
[50:18] angels?
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do I I I certainly am a believer.
[50:23] Uh you know, we've heard the sermons
[50:26] Brother Brand preached on demonology.
[50:28] Uh, I believe we could call this
[50:29] angelology. Uh, I I certainly believe
[50:32] there are angels and uh I do believe
[50:34] that angels do appear to human beings. I
[50:37] believe they uh are messengers that are
[50:40] sent from God and they certainly
[50:42] influence many things that are on the
[50:44] earth and people are not always aware
[50:47] that it's happening. Uh when I say this
[50:50] um in the book of Hebrews the 13th
[50:52] chapter Paul will say this don't be
[50:54] forgetful to entertain strangers for
[50:56] thereby some have entertained angels
[50:59] unaware. And when he says that you know
[51:01] he has something specific in mind. He
[51:03] he's not just saying that but there's
[51:05] been some places that he knows that God
[51:08] had appeared to people and they were
[51:10] unaware that it was an angel. Amen. Now
[51:13] it's certainly uh in the quote the
[51:15] resurrection brother Brandham in 1953 he
[51:17] said before God sends a message to the
[51:19] earth he sends angels sometimes a
[51:22] messenger to the earth to bring his
[51:24] message do you believe that God has
[51:26] angels now sometime ago someone called
[51:29] me out on that and they said brother
[51:31] Brandham a great fundamental brother he
[51:33] said now there's only one flaw that I
[51:35] can find with your message to the people
[51:38] &gt;&gt; he said what's that my brother he said
[51:39] it's not scriptural then I'll get rid of
[51:41] it and I'll repent
[51:42] He said, "Well, you're always referring
[51:44] to an angel." And he said, "The angel of
[51:46] God met you and told you such and such a
[51:48] thing." And Brother Brandham, don't you
[51:50] know that God doesn't use angels to
[51:52] direct his church? He uses the Holy
[51:55] Spirit to direct his church. I said,
[51:56] "Yes, that's true. But God also has
[52:00] angels, ministering spirits sent from
[52:03] God."
[52:05] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Brother Brandham, that was
[52:06] Old Testament doctrine." He said,
[52:07] "You've mixed the New and the Old." And
[52:10] I said, "See, one's just the shadow of
[52:12] the other." And I said, 'You've got to
[52:14] have the Old Testament. It's a shadow of
[52:16] the New. And the Old Testament, and both
[52:19] of them together confirms God's attitude
[52:23] toward his people.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I certainly believe that's one
[52:29] thing, amen, that that is there is it's
[52:31] God's attitude toward the people. Do you
[52:34] know God has a certain attitude and he
[52:36] don't change that attitude? Whatever
[52:38] attitude he had towards someone in the
[52:40] Bible, he has that same attitude towards
[52:43] you this morning. Amen. And when we see
[52:45] then, of course, the prophet is teaching
[52:47] us this. Amen. And that angels
[52:49] themselves meet and and and interact
[52:52] with human beings. Do you know if an
[52:54] angel appears or an angel comes in your
[52:56] midst, Amen. If you're dealing with
[52:58] angels, they're influencing towards you
[53:01] a divine and a sovereign will of God. If
[53:03] a if an angel's making influences upon
[53:06] you or an individual, it would always be
[53:09] toward the divine will of God. It would
[53:11] never like an angel would never appear
[53:13] to you to push you into organization or
[53:15] to push you into something that would be
[53:17] anti-word or it would never do that. But
[53:20] angels always influence toward a
[53:22] sovereign and a divine will. They appear
[53:25] in both New and Old Testaments. And if
[53:27] you're looking in the Old Testament, of
[53:29] course, there's a there's a Hebrew word
[53:31] which represents angels. In the Old
[53:33] Testament, it's a Hebrew word. And then
[53:34] in the New Testament, written in Greek
[53:36] before it was English. And the there's a
[53:38] Greek word. Both of those ends up
[53:40] meaning messenger. An angel is a
[53:42] messenger. And if you uh uh uh study
[53:45] your scripture, you're going to find
[53:46] later sometimes it refers to human
[53:48] beings being angels like a prophet,
[53:50] seventh messenger. And then it also
[53:53] refers to angels who are uh angelic
[53:55] heavenly beings that appear in human
[53:58] instances and push something a certain
[54:01] way. Brother Bam says, "See, if you
[54:03] don't believe angels are ministering
[54:05] spirits sent from the presence of God,
[54:07] then you don't know your Bible."
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Someone said, "Brother
[54:10] Brandom, angels is in the only in the
[54:12] Old Testament." He said, "That's an
[54:14] error. The new church, the New Church
[54:16] had more angels ministering than the Old
[54:19] Testament did." That's right. And he
[54:22] quotes Hebrews chapter 1, of course.
[54:24] Now, the first time uh that angels come
[54:27] into the Bible is very relevant because
[54:29] when Paul mentions this in Hebrews 1, he
[54:32] said that angels are ministering spirits
[54:35] unto the heirs of salvation. Now, on
[54:38] Friday night, we spent the first 15 or
[54:40] 20 minutes talking about the inheritance
[54:43] or the heirs of salvation, joint heirs
[54:45] with Christ. And as Abraham's seed, you
[54:48] are an heir of God. Amen. So therefore,
[54:52] these angels are appearing to who? Unto
[54:54] the heirs of salvation. Amen. So the
[54:58] first time that it appears in the Bible,
[55:00] it appears unto Hagar who is uh holding
[55:04] Abraham's seed, Ishmael. But think about
[55:07] this because Hagar has conceived on a
[55:09] slightly uh on a slightly doubted
[55:12] promise because God has promised unto
[55:14] Abraham that he was going to have a seed
[55:17] and then Sarah saying unto Abraham,
[55:19] "We've not had it yet." So Hagar could
[55:21] take my place. Amen. And when Hagar
[55:24] conceived, she began to despise Sarah a
[55:26] bit. And then Sarah despised her a bit
[55:29] and then got real rough on her. And
[55:30] Hagar decides to flee the camp. And she
[55:33] runs out in Genesis 16:7. She runs out
[55:36] in the wilderness and she's out there by
[55:38] herself, a lady expecting the baby. And
[55:40] the Bible said, "And the angel of the
[55:42] Lord found Hagar near a spring in the
[55:45] desert. And it was a spring that is
[55:47] before the road to shore." Now, the
[55:49] angel of the Lord found her there. It
[55:52] found Hagar. Now, this is the first time
[55:54] that the Lord appears as angelic form to
[55:57] talk to someone. Amen. And it has to do
[55:59] with the seed of Abraham. Amen. It's a
[56:02] beautiful story because if you really
[56:04] know who this woman is. Amen. She is
[56:06] typing not the bride of Christ. She's
[56:09] actually typing them that had a slightly
[56:12] doubted promise. But yet God was so
[56:15] interested in the seed of Abraham that
[56:17] he wouldn't even let Hagar take and
[56:19] destroy Ishmael out of his presence, but
[56:22] rather send an angel unto her. And when
[56:25] Hagar had received of the angel, the
[56:27] angel corrected her and told her, "You
[56:29] go back to the camp of Abraham and
[56:31] submit yourself under thine handmaidaden
[56:33] and have this child and you call his
[56:35] name Ishmael." Amen. And he begin to
[56:38] tell that great nations would come out
[56:39] of him and begin to prophesy. And
[56:42] Genesis 16 and 13, Hagar answers, and
[56:45] she said, "She called the name of the
[56:46] Lord that spake unto her. Now God see
[56:49] me, for she said, I have also looked
[56:52] after him that seeth me. Amen. Him that
[56:56] seeth me. She named the angel thou God
[57:00] seeest me. Amen. And wherefore the well
[57:03] was called Bora.
[57:05] It sounds like Amen. Maybe. But behold,
[57:09] it's it's a well. Brother Bram said it's
[57:10] the well of he that liveth and seeth me.
[57:14] She gave the name of the Lord Elroy. In
[57:17] other words, like Elon or El Shadi, she
[57:21] named the angel Elroy, which means a God
[57:24] who has vision. So when this woman meets
[57:27] this angel, she says, this is the
[57:29] response to her that God sees me. Now,
[57:33] isn't it beautiful? Because she thinks
[57:35] that she's out of the sight of Abraham.
[57:37] She's out of the sight of Abraham and
[57:39] Sarah and thinks she's outside of the
[57:41] promises of God. But God sees her. Amen.
[57:44] and and she is is actually showing here.
[57:47] Amen. The attitude that God has toward
[57:50] the believer that he's able to see her.
[57:52] Now, I want you to think if God can see
[57:55] that woman and what she represented, how
[57:58] much greater can God see the believer
[58:00] today who is the royal seed of Abraham
[58:04] that God sees you. And I know and
[58:06] recognize there are many people that
[58:08] thinks God is so small that he can only
[58:10] see a few people at a time. And and
[58:12] surely he can only see the higher ups or
[58:14] the bigger people or the more religious
[58:16] people. But this woman did not represent
[58:19] the most religious among us. She
[58:21] represented the other side. But God is
[58:24] telling you if he can see Hagar, how
[58:26] much greater can he see the royal seed
[58:28] of Abraham? He is the God that sees us.
[58:32] He is big enough to both be seen, but he
[58:35] can also see. You remember brother Bam
[58:37] telling the story about the boy in
[58:39] Canada there with a king and he said he
[58:41] saw the king going by. Amen. And and and
[58:44] and the and the teacher noticed he was
[58:46] crying. Said, "Why are you crying, son?
[58:48] Didn't you get to see the king?" He
[58:50] said, "Yeah." He said, "Didn't you get
[58:51] to wave your little flag at him?" He
[58:52] said, "I did." He said, "Well, then
[58:54] what's wrong with you?" He says, "But I
[58:56] don't think he saw me." Amen. Because
[58:58] earthly kings are big enough to be seen.
[59:01] They're big enough to rise above the
[59:03] crowd and to be carried in chariots, but
[59:06] they're not big enough to look at a
[59:07] crowd and see every person and know
[59:10] every thought and know every situation
[59:12] that's in that crowd. But the King of
[59:15] Kings, he's big enough that we can all
[59:18] see him. And I say we lift him so high
[59:20] that every person in this building this
[59:23] morning can see our God lifted up high.
[59:26] But brother, know this. When you look on
[59:28] him, he's looking back at you and he
[59:31] sees every need in this building.
[59:34] Brother Ron, our God is big enough this
[59:36] morning. He's the kind of God that you
[59:38] can have a personal audience with him.
[59:41] Amen. I know we think, well, amen, he's
[59:43] not big enough that if I'm talking to
[59:45] him and somebody else is talking to him
[59:47] and somebody else is talking to him, but
[59:50] he can hear every one of you. He can
[59:52] deal with every need. He knows the
[59:54] tallow of every flea and every fly. He
[59:57] knows every hair on your head. He knows
[59:59] every need that's in your heart. There's
[1:00:01] not one person in this building that's
[1:00:04] too small for God to see. There's not
[1:00:07] one need that's too little for God to
[1:00:10] know what you have need of. Why did he
[1:00:13] curse a fig tree to prove he's the
[1:00:15] Messiah? Why was it that he created a
[1:00:18] fish and made a resurrection of that
[1:00:20] little fish? Why did he do it? And
[1:00:21] brother Ram said, to show he cares about
[1:00:23] the smallest of things.
[1:00:26] My goodness. Isn't he a God that sees?
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; You might see him, but this God sees
[1:00:32] you.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; He looks back and sees you. And the
[1:00:36] actual name of this is the God that sees
[1:00:38] you. Now, in 1 Peter chapter 3 and verse
[1:00:42] 12, Peter acknowledges this and he says,
[1:00:44] "The eyes of the Lord are over the
[1:00:47] righteous
[1:00:48] and his ears are open unto their
[1:00:51] prayers." Do you believe the eyes of the
[1:00:54] Lord is upon the righteous? Do you know
[1:00:56] there's actually two appearings of the
[1:00:57] angel to Hagar? The first time she's
[1:01:00] expecting a baby and the second time she
[1:01:02] has a baby. Amen. And the second time
[1:01:05] when she's threw out of the camp, she
[1:01:07] goes out into the wilderness and it's a
[1:01:09] dry and thirsty place and and she lays
[1:01:12] the baby down a bow shot away and goes
[1:01:15] over and says, "Well, he's just going to
[1:01:17] die now. We're going to die of thirst
[1:01:19] out here." But the Bible says that God
[1:01:22] heard the cry of the lad. Amen. Watch
[1:01:26] what Peter said. He sees and he hears.
[1:01:29] And God heard the cry of this lad. Now I
[1:01:33] say this. The first time the angel saw
[1:01:35] her. And the second time he heard the
[1:01:38] cry of the lad. And I tell you this
[1:01:40] tonight or this morning, every person in
[1:01:43] this building that God's arm is not
[1:01:45] short and his ear is not heavy. If you
[1:01:49] have a need this morning, if you just
[1:01:51] cry out to the Lord, he can hear the cry
[1:01:54] of the righteous. If he could hear the
[1:01:56] cry of Ishmael, how much greater can he
[1:02:00] hear the voice of the bride of Jesus
[1:02:02] Christ this morning? Oh, I tell you
[1:02:04] this. Amen. That second appearance of
[1:02:06] that angel, you know, Amen. The first
[1:02:08] one she found out there was a whale of
[1:02:11] he that liveth and seeth me. And the
[1:02:13] second time he doesn't reannounce the
[1:02:16] whale. He just tells her to open up her
[1:02:18] eyes and that well is still bubbling.
[1:02:21] And I say this, I know, Amen. Many
[1:02:23] people thinks this well somehow it goes
[1:02:25] dry. You know, you found it when you
[1:02:27] were in your toughest time and you were
[1:02:29] in your greatest trouble and then and
[1:02:31] then 10 years later or 15 years later,
[1:02:34] you come to a real dry time in your life
[1:02:36] and the enemy says you're going to die
[1:02:38] in this desert. You're just going to dry
[1:02:40] up and fade away. Amen. But there's a
[1:02:43] story in the Bible to remind you the
[1:02:45] same well you drank from that gave you
[1:02:48] the Holy Ghost is right here in this
[1:02:50] building right now. There's a well
[1:02:53] there's a fountain opened in the house
[1:02:55] of David and your eyes may not see it
[1:02:58] but the visitation of an angel will open
[1:03:01] up your eyes that the same well that was
[1:03:04] in the Bible is in this building this
[1:03:06] morning. And there's water running from
[1:03:08] the rock all across this building right
[1:03:11] now. Oh yes sir. It's a second
[1:03:14] appearance of that angel. He is him that
[1:03:16] liveth and he that seeth me. Hallelujah.
[1:03:20] Abraham saw angels when they come to the
[1:03:23] tent door. One of them was God himself.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Two of them were just angels that went
[1:03:29] down to Sodom. Amen. Those angels were
[1:03:32] there to warn of oncoming judgments.
[1:03:35] Those angels had spoke to Lot and Sodom
[1:03:38] and dealt with them. But one of those
[1:03:40] angels had talked to Abraham and and he
[1:03:43] knew their names, but he was there
[1:03:45] inspiring them in the supernatural.
[1:03:48] Isn't it amazing? When angels appear,
[1:03:50] they don't come for the purpose of
[1:03:52] natural things. Angels don't appear
[1:03:55] among you or inspire you towards a
[1:03:58] natural thing. They're there to inspire
[1:04:00] you to believe for the impossible
[1:04:03] things. There Abraham and Sarah was old
[1:04:06] in their body, but there's an angel
[1:04:09] saying to them, you may be old, but
[1:04:11] you're going to have a child anyhow
[1:04:12] because all things are possible to God.
[1:04:15] You see, without without God, things are
[1:04:17] impossible, but with God, all things are
[1:04:20] possible. And we see here, we see an
[1:04:22] angel appearing. Now, watch those angels
[1:04:25] appearing to the heirs of salvation.
[1:04:26] You'll see a pattern. You see it here,
[1:04:28] amen, with Eleazar. When when Abraham
[1:04:31] gets ready for his son Isaac to take a
[1:04:34] wife, he don't go down and he don't send
[1:04:36] Isaac down. He sends Eleazar down. God's
[1:04:40] way of choosing a bride for his son was
[1:04:43] to send a faithful servant.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; My ain't you glad to know that he sent a
[1:04:48] faithful servant in this age? Because
[1:04:50] that's God's way of choosing a bride.
[1:04:53] You say, "How do I know I'm bride?"
[1:04:55] Because God chose me his faithful way of
[1:04:58] choosing. He sent a servant to identify
[1:05:02] the right woman at the whale.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Amen. You You see this man,
[1:05:07] Eleazar had a great task. Can you
[1:05:09] imagine the richest man in the world who
[1:05:11] is your master said, "Go find my boy a
[1:05:13] wife." You talk about responsibility,
[1:05:16] brother.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; You talk about pressure. Now that's real
[1:05:19] pressure. Amen. You get this wrong. I
[1:05:22] could see this going really bad.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go get my boy a wife. And you know
[1:05:27] how picky young men are. You know,
[1:05:33] you know, a lot of these poor little
[1:05:34] girls can't hardly get married. Now,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; another note,
[1:05:41] Eleazar comes down there. Now, he knows
[1:05:45] it's going to be bad, but he says to uh
[1:05:48] Abraham before he leaves, "Now
[1:05:50] prevention, the woman will not follow
[1:05:52] me." And he said unto him, "The Lord
[1:05:55] before whom I walk will send his angel
[1:05:58] with thee, and he will prosper thy way."
[1:06:02] Amen. You know why this man decided he
[1:06:05] would go down after that wife? Because
[1:06:07] the angel that brought Abraham to his
[1:06:09] land was going to go in front of him to
[1:06:11] choose a wife. In other words, it
[1:06:14] wouldn't be the choice of the faithful
[1:06:16] servant. It would be the faithful
[1:06:18] servant following the angel who was
[1:06:21] doing the choosing. and inspiring
[1:06:24] responses. When the when the Bible tells
[1:06:26] us here, it tells us about the great
[1:06:28] prayer. You talk about a prayer meeting.
[1:06:30] Eleaser had a prayer meeting on the way.
[1:06:32] Amen. He began to talk to the Lord about
[1:06:34] the seedline of Abraham and how he
[1:06:36] didn't want to make the wrong choices.
[1:06:38] And he said, "Lord, I'm going to go up
[1:06:39] to this well, and when I go up to this
[1:06:41] well, I'm going to stand there, and it
[1:06:43] shall come to pass when the virgins come
[1:06:45] to draw water." Now, there's a lot of
[1:06:48] beautiful types here. Amen. It's in the
[1:06:50] evening time when the virgins come to
[1:06:53] draw water is when Abraham's servant is
[1:06:56] at the well to choose a wife. When
[1:06:58] they're all coming to the water, I will
[1:07:00] draw for thy camels. And let the same
[1:07:03] woman who the Lord has appointed to be
[1:07:05] my master's son. So now he says, the
[1:07:08] white girl for Isaac will be responsive
[1:07:12] in this way.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; He says, this is what she'll do before
[1:07:16] I'm done speaking. Behold, he says, I
[1:07:18] will say to them a a little water of thy
[1:07:21] picture to drink, and she will say to me
[1:07:24] both, drink, and I will give for thy
[1:07:26] camels. Let the same be the woman whom
[1:07:29] the Lord had appointed out of the
[1:07:30] master's son. And while he had done
[1:07:32] speaking in his heart, Rebecca came with
[1:07:35] her picture on her shoulder. And she sat
[1:07:38] down at the well and drew water. And I
[1:07:40] said unto her, "Let me drink, I pray
[1:07:43] thee." And she made haste and let down
[1:07:45] her pitcher from her shoulder and said,
[1:07:48] "Drink, and I will give thy camels to
[1:07:50] drink also." And she made the camels to
[1:07:53] drink. Now, now he did not tell her what
[1:07:56] to say, but something in her had
[1:07:59] inspired her to say the exact words that
[1:08:03] would qualify her as the bride of
[1:08:06] Abraham's son. Now, now, now, Brother
[1:08:09] Brandham tells us the mystery behind
[1:08:10] this. How many knows the mystery behind
[1:08:12] how she knew the right thing to say? But
[1:08:14] Abraham said the angel that had brought
[1:08:16] Abraham to that land and that had sent
[1:08:19] Eleesar was a half hour out in front of
[1:08:22] him and she had and he had already been
[1:08:26] dealing with Rebecca before Rebecca met
[1:08:29] Eleazar. So that when the two of them
[1:08:31] come together, she knew just how to
[1:08:34] respond to the message of Eleazar. Oh, I
[1:08:38] tell you something. today. Nobody told
[1:08:40] us how to accept this message. Nobody
[1:08:42] told us how to believe it. Matter of
[1:08:44] fact, they said, "You shouldn't believe
[1:08:45] it." But something on the inside of our
[1:08:48] hearts said, "We believe that word. We
[1:08:51] believe that message." And not only
[1:08:53] would we water that prophet, Amen. We
[1:08:55] started watering the camels that brought
[1:08:57] him. Amen. You say, "Preacher, water the
[1:08:59] camels." Yes, sir. That's watering them
[1:09:02] with your praise. Amen. Amen. And I'll
[1:09:04] say this this morning. The power of the
[1:09:07] Holy Ghost brought this message to the
[1:09:10] earth. Amen. And I say, if we're going
[1:09:13] to go home on the power of the Holy
[1:09:15] Ghost and we are to water the thing
[1:09:17] that's going to carry us, how do I water
[1:09:20] it? We begin to praise the Lord. I tell
[1:09:23] you this, the camel carrying me, it's
[1:09:25] not going to die of thirst, brother.
[1:09:27] Amen. I am going to praise the Lord and
[1:09:29] empower the spirit that carries me.
[1:09:32] It'll carry me out of depression. It'll
[1:09:35] carry me out of family situations. I say
[1:09:39] get on your camel. Amen. And ride into
[1:09:42] the presence of almighty God.
[1:09:46] It will not be organizational power. It
[1:09:48] will not be tribulation power. It won't
[1:09:50] be pressure that makes this bride go.
[1:09:53] It'll be the power of God that carries
[1:09:56] this bride into the rapture.
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:10:01] Brother, I believe it. I believe when
[1:10:03] you begin to praise God, I believe the
[1:10:05] very thing that's going to change our
[1:10:07] body begins to move in the church,
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; what did he say? The same spirit that
[1:10:14] raised Jesus from the dead shall also
[1:10:17] quicken your mortal bodies.
[1:10:22] Y'all know I'm telling you the truth.
[1:10:24] That spirit going to get a hold of you
[1:10:25] and it's going to carry you out of this
[1:10:27] world.
[1:10:30] I refuse to let the camels that's going
[1:10:32] to carry me die at the door
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; of skepticism and criticism and dry. Can
[1:10:40] you imagine the our our power that's
[1:10:43] supposed to carry us? Can you imagine it
[1:10:46] being being thirst to death
[1:10:50] because somebody said, "Well, you
[1:10:51] shouldn't praise him."
[1:10:54] Well, angel might not have angel might
[1:10:57] not have geared you that way,
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; but he inspired me that way.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; He inspired me that way. Do you see that
[1:11:10] angel? Amen. It was it was it was moving
[1:11:15] in the seed of Abraham, the heirs of
[1:11:17] Abraham. Now, Jacob, a great seed of
[1:11:20] Abraham, remember when he gets the
[1:11:22] birthright and he begins to flee after
[1:11:25] his birthright, he crosses over and he's
[1:11:27] headed out of the country and he goes
[1:11:29] one night and lays down and the Bible
[1:11:31] said in a certain place he tried there
[1:11:33] and when he did he meant he took some
[1:11:36] stones and built himself a pillar and in
[1:11:39] the middle of the night he began to have
[1:11:40] a dream and he dreamed that there was a
[1:11:43] ladder that was connected to the heaven
[1:11:45] and to the earth. And while he looked
[1:11:47] upon that, he seen angels of God
[1:11:49] ascending and descending on it. Isn't
[1:11:52] that something that there is a
[1:11:54] connection between heaven and earth?
[1:11:56] Amen. That the angels of heaven can go
[1:11:58] up and down that ladder at any time. Do
[1:12:01] you ever hear Brother Bam talk about the
[1:12:03] angel and he said people say, "Well,
[1:12:05] heaven's a million miles away." He said,
[1:12:07] "It's not."
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "How could that angel appear
[1:12:10] and disappear so quickly if it was that
[1:12:13] far away?" He said, "But the real truth
[1:12:15] of it is it's an dense a dimension just
[1:12:18] a little faster than this one so he can
[1:12:21] just open the curtain a little." Amen.
[1:12:23] What is it? He's telling you there is a
[1:12:25] connection between heaven and earth.
[1:12:27] It's called Jacob's ladder. And Jacob
[1:12:30] saw it in the dream. He saw him going up
[1:12:33] and down that ladder. Amen. Y'all know
[1:12:35] what he called it? Amen. When he got up
[1:12:37] from there, he stacked it all up and he
[1:12:39] said, "This is going to be called the
[1:12:41] gate of heaven." Amen. This will be the
[1:12:43] place called the gate of heaven, and I
[1:12:45] will call its name Bethl. And right
[1:12:47] there, he be to realize that he had a
[1:12:50] ladder. Do y'all believe God still got a
[1:12:51] ladder?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; He still got Jacob's ladder. Brother
[1:12:55] Brandham said it like this. I pray he
[1:12:58] let the angels of heaven come down off
[1:13:00] of the ladder of Jacob. They take their
[1:13:02] positions now as soldiers. They take
[1:13:05] their post of duty, setting every place,
[1:13:08] every corner, every place. Take their
[1:13:10] right positions. And may they not leave
[1:13:12] the building until the revival is over.
[1:13:16] I said, "Glory be to God. God's got a
[1:13:19] way to pack this building full of the
[1:13:21] angels of God this morning." Listen, you
[1:13:23] may have come with a need, but the angel
[1:13:26] of deliverance is here. You say, "Well,
[1:13:28] I got a need. The angel of healing is
[1:13:30] here." You say, "Well, Brother Wayne,
[1:13:32] amen. I don't know what to do." The
[1:13:33] angel to inspire you, amen, to move
[1:13:36] toward the supernatural
[1:13:38] is in this building right now. And I
[1:13:40] pray they don't leave till the revival
[1:13:42] is over. Can we take it another level? I
[1:13:44] believe the angels of God have come into
[1:13:46] this message. Amen. And they won't leave
[1:13:50] until this revival is over. I'm talking
[1:13:52] about this bride's revival. Amen. The
[1:13:55] angels of the Lord will stay with this
[1:13:57] bride until the revival is over. And
[1:14:00] this revival won't end until there's a
[1:14:03] change of the body. And brother, we're
[1:14:06] going to go up that ladder with the
[1:14:07] angels into another dimension. Amen.
[1:14:11] Just like Enoch left the earth. We're
[1:14:13] going to leave this earth right up that
[1:14:16] ladder. Brother,
[1:14:18] you say we're going to get We're already
[1:14:20] on the ladder. We already got started.
[1:14:23] When God filled us with the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:25] we got up on that ladder and brother
[1:14:27] Bram said he had angels to bear thee up.
[1:14:30] In other words, you're on a ladder you
[1:14:32] can't fall off of.
[1:14:34] Hallelujah.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; This ladder is not going to tip over.
[1:14:39] You're a painter. When you go to set a
[1:14:41] ladder on the bottom, you got to make
[1:14:43] sure it's all level and ain't no mud
[1:14:45] holes and ain't no problems. Brother Ram
[1:14:47] said, "God put Jesus Christ on the earth
[1:14:50] and he hooked the ladder in the solid
[1:14:52] rock of Jesus Christ and the other end
[1:14:55] is hooked into the heavens and if you
[1:14:57] ever get on that ladder, you can't fall
[1:15:00] off.
[1:15:02] He's got angels to bear you up. You You
[1:15:07] might fall back a rung, but brother,
[1:15:09] you'll never fall off. You might you
[1:15:11] might backslide a little. You might get
[1:15:13] a little discouraged, but God's got an
[1:15:16] angel to pack you back into the presence
[1:15:19] of God. Once you get the baptism of the
[1:15:22] Holy Ghost, there ain't no devil. There
[1:15:24] ain't no power. There ain't no nothing
[1:15:27] can keep the child of God from going in
[1:15:29] the rapture. everything we have need of.
[1:15:34] How you know you're going? I'm already
[1:15:36] on the ladder, brother. I'm walking an
[1:15:39] Enoch walk.
[1:15:42] You're a little discouraged. God's got
[1:15:44] an angel this morning. Say, "Come on,
[1:15:46] Idia." Amen. He's got an angel. Come on.
[1:15:48] Come on. Come on now. You can make it a
[1:15:51] little higher. Little higher. Little
[1:15:53] higher.
[1:15:56] And after a little while,
[1:16:00] amen, we're going to go to another body.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Why don't everybody else know about it?
[1:16:07] Well, Romeo, he slipped that ladder up
[1:16:10] to Julieta.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Well, this ladder didn't slip up to you.
[1:16:16] It slipped down to your window.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is pulling this church back up
[1:16:21] on back up on this ladder. Now, Jacob on
[1:16:26] his way back. He's seen that on the way
[1:16:29] out and he's on his way back. I like
[1:16:32] that feeling. Don't you? He's on his
[1:16:34] way. He's a little scared of meeting his
[1:16:36] brother. He needs to He needs a little
[1:16:38] furtherance. Amen. He needs a little
[1:16:40] something to help him meet his brother
[1:16:42] as he's a little worried about how
[1:16:44] things are going to go. Amen. And the
[1:16:46] Bible says, Amen. And Jacob in Genesis
[1:16:49] 32 and1 and verse two, beautiful
[1:16:51] reading. And Jacob went on his way and
[1:16:54] the angels of God met him. And when
[1:16:58] Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's
[1:17:01] host." And he called the name of that
[1:17:04] place Mahanim. Now, think about this.
[1:17:07] Mahanim. Now, Amen. Y'all forgive me,
[1:17:10] but this about this is about place where
[1:17:11] I need to clear the altar a little
[1:17:13] while. Amen. You know what that word
[1:17:15] mahanium means? It means two camps. He
[1:17:19] saw he said this place is called two
[1:17:21] camps because he knew there was a camp
[1:17:23] of angels and there was his camp. He
[1:17:26] knew there was a natural camp and he
[1:17:28] knew there was another camp. He's on his
[1:17:30] way back. But he realizes here, amen,
[1:17:33] that some of them off of that ladder has
[1:17:35] come down and made a camp right here
[1:17:37] next to me. Now he's sitting here. He's
[1:17:40] sitting here getting ready now to go
[1:17:41] into this great battle. Amen. He sends
[1:17:44] all of his beloveds away and he sends
[1:17:46] all the gifts out and then here comes
[1:17:49] one of them men out of that camp. Amen.
[1:17:51] And the Bible says he saw a man down by
[1:17:54] the river. Amen. And the Bible tells us
[1:17:56] that Jacob went over there and got a
[1:17:59] hold of that angel and decided to
[1:18:01] rrestle it out. You know what that
[1:18:04] means? He recognized his moment of
[1:18:07] opportunity had come. He recognized
[1:18:10] what's in front of me can change me. I I
[1:18:14] maybe have wandered all over this land.
[1:18:17] But right at this very moment, there is
[1:18:20] something within hand grasp that when I
[1:18:23] leave the bank of this river, I will
[1:18:26] never be the same Jacob anymore. And
[1:18:28] when he got a hold of it, brother Oh,
[1:18:31] Brother Bam said, "God's got an agent
[1:18:33] like that tonight." He said, "If you
[1:18:35] ever get a hold of it, don't you let go
[1:18:36] of it. You begin to get a Amen." You
[1:18:38] know why people let go of it? Because
[1:18:40] they don't believe what they got a hold
[1:18:41] of. But I tell you what, you ever get a
[1:18:43] God called preacher in the pull pit and
[1:18:45] he'll tell you that that spirit that's
[1:18:48] moving around you right now, that
[1:18:50] inspiration that moves through this
[1:18:51] building, that that's called the Holy
[1:18:53] Ghost. And if you'll reach out and get a
[1:18:55] hold of that, don't you let go of that
[1:18:58] until the deliverance in your life
[1:19:00] comes, until your healing comes, until
[1:19:03] the blessing comes under your life. Hey,
[1:19:06] can you imagine getting a hold of that
[1:19:07] and beginning to wrestle?
[1:19:10] And he's wrestling because because he
[1:19:12] knows I got a hold of what's going to
[1:19:15] change me because my name is Jacob and
[1:19:18] I'm a deceiver. I'm living two lives.
[1:19:21] I'm deceiving people. I'm not what I'm
[1:19:23] supposed to be. And I know I'm not what
[1:19:26] I'm supposed to be. I'm one thing in the
[1:19:28] church. I'm something else at home. I'm
[1:19:30] one thing when I'm with my friends. I'm
[1:19:32] something else when I'm in my car. Amen.
[1:19:35] But right in the presence of Jacob on
[1:19:37] the bank of that river was one that
[1:19:40] could change him from Jacob to Israel, a
[1:19:44] prince with God. And there's a changer
[1:19:47] in this house right now. You can reach
[1:19:49] out and get a hold of him. And you can
[1:19:51] change your name. Amen. From depression
[1:19:54] to joy.
[1:19:56] From bound to delivered. From lost to
[1:19:59] saved. You could change your name from
[1:20:01] Baptist to Christian. You can change
[1:20:04] your name from Amish to Holy Ghost
[1:20:07] filled. You can move from a Menite to a
[1:20:09] son of God. If you just get a hold of
[1:20:12] the angel this morning, he'll change
[1:20:15] you.
[1:20:19] I know what I'm talking about.
[1:20:23] You can leave here this morning and thy
[1:20:25] name shall not be called deceiver.
[1:20:27] You'll call a prince with God. Somebody
[1:20:29] that's wrestled it out. You know how you
[1:20:31] know them? They walk different.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Sure. Don't you walk the same and tell
[1:20:38] me you got the Holy Ghost. Don't you
[1:20:40] walk in the same old barrooms. Don't you
[1:20:42] walk in the same old nonsense. Don't you
[1:20:44] go to the club on Saturday night in
[1:20:46] church on Sunday morning and tell me
[1:20:49] that you've got a hold of the angel. If
[1:20:51] the angel ever gets a hold of you, he
[1:20:53] will change you. He will change your
[1:20:55] name. He'll change the way you walk.
[1:20:58] He'll change the way you talk.
[1:21:03] And he could even get along with his
[1:21:05] brother after that.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Touched him.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; That old man got touched.
[1:21:12] What happened to you, Jacob? I I've been
[1:21:14] with the angel. I got I got touched.
[1:21:17] Amen. They didn't have to ask if
[1:21:18] something happened to him. They didn't
[1:21:21] have to ask. His walk told him something
[1:21:24] happened to Jacob. What was it? I tell
[1:21:26] you what it was. I went down to that
[1:21:28] full gospel lighthouse and they were
[1:21:30] having a meeting over Labor Day weekend
[1:21:31] and there was something that was
[1:21:33] loosening that building. I got a hold of
[1:21:35] it and it changed my name. It made me
[1:21:38] look different, act different, walk
[1:21:40] different.
[1:21:43] Psychology will never do it for you.
[1:21:46] Intellectuals will never do it for you.
[1:21:49] But one wrestling with the angel of
[1:21:51] almighty God,
[1:21:54] [Applause]
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; not Jacob, Israel.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Change your name, change your walk,
[1:22:04] change the way you talk.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz you done some wrestling.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Wayne, how do you know about
[1:22:15] it? Cuz I did it.
[1:22:20] I did it. Somebody preached the promises
[1:22:22] of I remember my old pastor, brother
[1:22:24] Dave Morris, happened to be my uncle. He
[1:22:25] preached the promise of the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:27] I think they preached it every Sunday
[1:22:28] and every Wednesday for months when I
[1:22:30] first got saved. And I wanted it and I
[1:22:34] knew it had to be real because I could
[1:22:36] see it in the Bible and I could hear it
[1:22:37] in the promise. But I needed something.
[1:22:41] I still chewing backer.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:22:46] that that ring in your pocket ain't gum.
[1:22:48] We know that.
[1:22:51] I still chewing backer. I still wanted a
[1:22:54] cigarette. I still would have liked to
[1:22:56] had a beer. I just wasn't doing it. But
[1:22:57] I really would like to have one. And I
[1:22:59] knew that if I didn't get that out of my
[1:23:01] heart that that wouldn't be Amen. about
[1:23:04] a week after I got out of church, I was
[1:23:06] going to be right back where I was
[1:23:08] because I was a real sinner and I had a
[1:23:10] real pull from the world on me. Amen.
[1:23:12] But when I got in that altar, I got to
[1:23:14] pray him one night and I said, "Lord, I
[1:23:16] got to have more than just somebody
[1:23:18] shaking my hand. I got to have more than
[1:23:21] some preacher telling me, you're going
[1:23:23] to be okay." Don't tell the kid they're
[1:23:25] going to be okay. Tell them to get in
[1:23:27] the presence of God and then they'll be
[1:23:30] okay. I'm telling you, young person, you
[1:23:33] ain't okay until you wrestled it out
[1:23:36] with God's angel. Until you change that
[1:23:39] heart.
[1:23:42] And I remember it.
[1:23:45] People don't want me telling it. They
[1:23:46] don't want me talking about it. But let
[1:23:47] me tell you what happened to me. I got
[1:23:49] down in an old altar with holes in the
[1:23:51] bottom of my boots. And I prayed
[1:23:53] through. Amen. Until a p a ball of fire
[1:23:56] rolled off of that altar and I seen it
[1:23:58] with my own eyes and it hit me about
[1:24:01] right here. And I got drunker. I
[1:24:03] probably shouldn't tell this, but I was
[1:24:05] drunker right then than I was when I was
[1:24:07] drinking White Lightning. Amen. Ricardi
[1:24:10] 151 ain't got nothing on a real revival
[1:24:13] Holy Ghost fililled son of God. I
[1:24:16] remember getting drunk. I remember
[1:24:18] getting slain in the spirit. But I had a
[1:24:21] hold of the angel of God. And I want you
[1:24:23] to know it's real. It's real. It's real.
[1:24:27] And it can change your life this
[1:24:29] morning.
[1:24:32] Don't you let no educator educate you
[1:24:35] out of it. Don't let you let no doctrine
[1:24:37] of divinity talk you out of it. It's
[1:24:40] your experience.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; It's your experience. Don't let somebody
[1:24:46] tell you what it ought to be.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; People used to get an interview with
[1:24:53] brother Brandham, you know, and somebody
[1:24:55] say, "Well, don't ask him this and ask
[1:24:56] him that and don't say this and do say
[1:24:58] that." Hey, man. You know what?
[1:25:01] It's my time.
[1:25:03] That's right.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Well, don't you ask the Lord for that
[1:25:06] and don't you ask for that experience
[1:25:07] and don't you ask me? Amen. Hey, look.
[1:25:10] Look, this is my time.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; And just so happens that God has made a
[1:25:15] promise in this age.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; We are at a junction of time. And in
[1:25:21] junctions of time, miracles and angels
[1:25:24] and anointings and powers begin to fill
[1:25:26] this earth. Why is there so much
[1:25:28] demonology? Why is the devil everywhere?
[1:25:31] Why is he in every phone, in every
[1:25:33] computer, on every television screen?
[1:25:35] Amen. But if the devil is running
[1:25:37] rampant, what about the heavenly host of
[1:25:40] God? He ought to be in every meeting. He
[1:25:43] ought to be in every sermon. He ought to
[1:25:45] be in every book we read.
[1:25:48] I say, "Fill us, Lord.
[1:25:51] Fill us with a supernatural God."
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:57] I have had enough of dead religion. I
[1:26:00] want to see the God of Abraham break out
[1:26:03] upon the children of God.
[1:26:06] It's a promise.
[1:26:13] You know, every time God has revival,
[1:26:17] there is an intellectual side
[1:26:20] that's going to come against it.
[1:26:24] So when somebody tells you you're
[1:26:26] fanatical,
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; when somebody tells you, "Oh, this
[1:26:29] revival is ridiculous."
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You just read where Moab had a king
[1:26:35] named Bailo and hired a man named Balum
[1:26:38] who was fundamentally the same as Moses,
[1:26:41] but just didn't believe in the
[1:26:43] supernatural side.
[1:26:48] I am not refuting that some of these men
[1:26:50] are message believers, but I am refuting
[1:26:52] that they have lost the identity of true
[1:26:55] Christianity.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; They have received spiritual amnesia and
[1:27:00] they have forgot what happened on the
[1:27:03] day of Pentecost. They have forgot what
[1:27:06] happened in in Acts chapter 4. They
[1:27:09] forgot what happened in South Africa.
[1:27:11] They forgot what happened in California.
[1:27:13] They forgot how God visited this
[1:27:16] generation.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Forget the dead religion.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; We can have an experience with God.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Now, Balam wrote his mule.
[1:27:38] He had a way hired to prophesy against
[1:27:42] God's elect.
[1:27:44] Isn't that something? Now, Brother
[1:27:46] Rodney, it wasn't that there wasn't
[1:27:47] problems.
[1:27:49] And and I'm just going to be real
[1:27:50] straight with y'all. Look, if you're in
[1:27:52] the message of the hour and you're
[1:27:54] expecting to come to my church, Brother
[1:27:56] Tim's church, Brother Ron's church,
[1:27:58] we'll even throw brother Donny's church
[1:27:59] in. He's not here, but he would agree.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; You're going to see some things you
[1:28:06] don't like.
[1:28:10] But I want you to say, see, and
[1:28:11] understand, God sees the same thing you
[1:28:14] see.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; But he can't see what you're looking at
[1:28:17] because he's looking through the blood.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; So, don't God see? He could see, but the
[1:28:28] blood is in between him.
[1:28:33] And you can hire all the preachers you
[1:28:35] want to to prophesy against me,
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; but God can't see the critic's view of
[1:28:40] you.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; And when Balam was on his ride to do it,
[1:28:50] God sent an angel to stop him.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Draw his sword. Don't go on this trail.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Don't get on a trail of condemning men
[1:29:01] of God.
[1:29:04] The angel said, "Get off that mule."
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, sons of God. You don't belong
[1:29:11] on a mule riding against God's
[1:29:14] supernatural children.
[1:29:20] Get off of the mule and get back in the
[1:29:23] Bible and remember the God of Abraham
[1:29:27] that has saved you and sanctified you
[1:29:30] and filled you with the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:34] Well, Brother Wayne, there's all kinds
[1:29:35] of fanaticism. There will always be
[1:29:38] fanaticism, but we're going to worship
[1:29:40] God in the middle of the fanaticism.
[1:29:46] It's always going to be there.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne, you better be careful
[1:29:53] talking about the angel because you
[1:29:54] don't know what kind of fanaticism.
[1:29:56] Amen. Do you think Brother Brandon was
[1:29:58] careful about talking about it?
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:05] Well, now that that's off my chest,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Gideon himself
[1:30:14] had gotten into the place
[1:30:19] where he was going to hide and do his
[1:30:20] work.
[1:30:23] I'm just going to get back here and hide
[1:30:24] because these Medianites made it really
[1:30:26] rough on us.
[1:30:29] Well, the Bible says the angel of the
[1:30:31] Lord found him in his hiding.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; And when he found him, he didn't say,
[1:30:38] "Oh, hello there, hider. How you doing,
[1:30:41] thou weak one?"
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "How are you, thy mighty man of
[1:30:47] valor?"
[1:30:50] [Applause]
[1:30:52] Who Who you talk Who you talking to?
[1:30:57] I'm talking to you,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; brother Timothy. I'm talking to you.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; I know the feelings to hide. I know all
[1:31:05] about it. It's easier to pull back and
[1:31:08] let them all have their way. Amen. But
[1:31:10] there's an angel that appeared in this
[1:31:12] age. And he said, "Thou are a mighty man
[1:31:15] of valor."
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. You You never had no
[1:31:21] battles unless you're a preacher, then
[1:31:22] you know them.
[1:31:24] And only a preacher knows that statement
[1:31:26] truth.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Thou mighty man of valor. Now, now, now
[1:31:30] he had already decided that the
[1:31:32] Medionites were undefeable, especially
[1:31:34] with his army and his ability. But here
[1:31:38] was a message of his greatness.
[1:31:43] It's easier to believe the bad. Y'all
[1:31:45] know that.
[1:31:47] Somebody says, "Well, you're just ugly
[1:31:49] and no good." Do you know how much
[1:31:50] easier that is to believe than you're a
[1:31:52] good-looking old boy?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; It's easier to say for me, too.
[1:32:03] But it's harder to believe the good. You
[1:32:06] humble. You humble yourself to the bad.
[1:32:08] That's I remember when I first started
[1:32:10] fellowshipping brother Ron. Amen. He He
[1:32:13] saw something more in me than I saw in
[1:32:15] me. Sincerely. And he would, brother
[1:32:18] Ron, he'd always compliment my sermons.
[1:32:20] I finally told him one day, I said, "As
[1:32:21] long as you and my mom are alive, I'm
[1:32:23] all right."
[1:32:26] So, I've been praying for him.
[1:32:30] He'd be saying, "That's one of the
[1:32:31] greatest sermons I ever heard." And I'm
[1:32:33] feeling like, "Oh, God."
[1:32:37] But he don't lie. He don't lie.
[1:32:41] But God will lead people into your life.
[1:32:45] He will lead supernatural presences in
[1:32:47] your life that they believe in you when
[1:32:49] you don't believe in you.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; They'll inspire you for the greater part
[1:32:53] of you. I always like your story. I'm
[1:32:55] going to steal your story right here. I
[1:32:57] think it was Muhammad Ali, wasn't it?
[1:32:58] That his that his coach, he said he's a
[1:33:01] great fighter. He said, "I just have to
[1:33:03] remind him as a champion. That's all I
[1:33:04] do." See, a real good coach don't have
[1:33:07] to make you. They have the ability to
[1:33:09] pick the right people and they start
[1:33:12] encouraging because they know there's
[1:33:14] something on the inside. This angel
[1:33:16] didn't change Gideon. He just told him
[1:33:19] who he really was.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And there's an inspiration in this
[1:33:24] message that is coming to this hour.
[1:33:28] It'll tell you who you really are. It'll
[1:33:30] tell you what you're really about, what
[1:33:32] you're really supposed to do.
[1:33:36] you you're not just a nobody.
[1:33:39] You're a mighty man, a mighty woman of
[1:33:41] almighty God. And by divine direction,
[1:33:44] he said, "Amen." He's sitting there with
[1:33:46] the prophet's message in his heart. How
[1:33:48] many ever heard this? If God be with us,
[1:33:50] where's the miracles? Brother Bram said,
[1:33:52] Gideon was at the wine press and the
[1:33:54] message of that prophet that had just
[1:33:56] visited him was coming across his heart
[1:33:59] and he said, "Then the Lord appeared to
[1:34:00] him."
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; You don't think the angel don't stay
[1:34:03] with this message? You take what brother
[1:34:05] Brandham says and start meditating on
[1:34:08] it. And while he was meditating on that
[1:34:11] prophet's message, the Lord came to him
[1:34:14] and vindicated what he had heard was the
[1:34:17] truth.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this, there's something
[1:34:19] that'll vindicate this to you. That you
[1:34:22] can take 300 men, Amen. and destroy that
[1:34:25] entire uh Medianite army. I believe it
[1:34:28] was when they went into the battle, what
[1:34:29] did they cry? He said, "The sword of the
[1:34:31] Lord
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; and of Gideonss."
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just, "Oh, I tell you what,
[1:34:37] brother Random had that sword in his
[1:34:38] hand and it was the third pull and the
[1:34:40] word was opened up and I say, "Amen." It
[1:34:43] was the sword of the Lord and Wayne
[1:34:45] Lawson's
[1:34:47] and Tim Puit and Ron Spencer's and
[1:34:51] Nathan's and you, Brother Aaron, and
[1:34:53] you, Brother Aaron. Amen. It's not
[1:34:55] brother Matthew just somebody else's
[1:34:57] sword. It's my sword.
[1:35:00] And I say, devil, you ought to back up
[1:35:03] because a children of God has a sword.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; There was a there was a there was a
[1:35:13] video floating around here a while back
[1:35:15] and I don't know if I should tell it.
[1:35:16] I'm Brother Ron. It's okay. And there's
[1:35:19] a there's a couple old boys getting
[1:35:20] drunk and they were drinking in this in
[1:35:22] this room, Brother Joe. And that one old
[1:35:24] boy had a sword and he was drunk. He was
[1:35:27] stugger. And the other boy had the idea
[1:35:29] to put an apple on his nose
[1:35:32] and he laid back and the guy's supposed
[1:35:33] to cut the apple. Well, he missed
[1:35:37] because you don't give a drunk man a
[1:35:38] sword and expect him not to do some
[1:35:40] damage. Amen. And when the church of the
[1:35:42] living God begins to drink the wine of
[1:35:46] the stimulation of the revelation of
[1:35:47] God, she's holding a sharp two-edged
[1:35:50] sword. And brother, she'll go to cutting
[1:35:53] the devil. She'll go to cutting him
[1:35:55] every which way. Amen. He I tell you
[1:35:58] what I tell you what you can't beat up.
[1:36:00] You know they got these karate guys and
[1:36:02] as long as you take the karate they'll
[1:36:04] tell you. So you got to stand like this
[1:36:05] and amen. As long as you do that they
[1:36:08] could they can take you but they but
[1:36:10] they don't know what to do with an
[1:36:11] idiot. You know a street fighter cuz I
[1:36:13] just clobber you. I just run in and
[1:36:15] start swinging. There's no form. There's
[1:36:17] no fashion. I'm not a sword fighter.
[1:36:20] Amen. I tell you what. I'm a clobber.
[1:36:22] Pick up your sword and clobber that
[1:36:24] devil.
[1:36:26] Just clber him. Hit him and hit him and
[1:36:30] hit him till he goes to backing up from
[1:36:32] you.
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:36] It's your sword, young man.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; It's your sword, brother.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when Arthur pulled that
[1:36:46] out of that rock?
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; How can he get that sword in his hand?
[1:36:52] Cuz he was born to it, brother.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:55] And this bride's born to it.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; That sword stuck in the rock of
[1:36:59] Revelation, it won't fit in any hand,
[1:37:01] but it'll fit in the hand of the bride
[1:37:04] of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; And when she pulls it out,
[1:37:09] you better look out.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; She's armed
[1:37:14] and dangerous.
[1:37:19] [Applause]
[1:37:22] She's armed and she's dangerous.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what it was like at your
[1:37:29] birth? Can you imagine when you were
[1:37:31] being born into the heavens and you come
[1:37:34] right out into this earth? Do you
[1:37:35] imagine what was going on around you? Do
[1:37:38] you think it was just special when
[1:37:40] brother Brandon was born or when Jesus
[1:37:42] was born or when Moses was born? You are
[1:37:45] the very wife, the royal seed of the
[1:37:48] lamb of God. And the day you were born,
[1:37:50] Amen. angelic host filled the room.
[1:37:53] Amen. To see the birth.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Now y'all, I'm not out of the Bible now.
[1:38:02] Cuz when Samson got ready to come, God
[1:38:04] sent an angel to his barren mother.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; And a woman didn't even think she'd have
[1:38:08] a child cuz she was barren. that angel
[1:38:10] visited her home
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; and told her she was going to have a
[1:38:14] child and she went and told her husband
[1:38:16] and he didn't want to believe it. She
[1:38:17] said, "But an angel met me out there in
[1:38:19] the field." He said, "Well, I'd like to
[1:38:20] talk to him myself." So, she went and
[1:38:22] asked the Lord to send him back. And one
[1:38:24] day, she walks out and that same angel
[1:38:26] was back out in that field. She run and
[1:38:27] got her husband. They went out there and
[1:38:29] talked to him. Now, I want you to notice
[1:38:31] something here because they ask him what
[1:38:33] his name was and he said, "It's a
[1:38:35] secret." Why you ask me my name? Some
[1:38:37] people say, "Well, Brother Brandham
[1:38:38] really met an angel. Why didn't he know
[1:38:40] his name?" Because the Bible said when
[1:38:43] Samson's mother met him.
[1:38:46] Brother Brandham wasn't trying to
[1:38:48] deceive you.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; No different than Samson's mother was.
[1:38:53] Didn't tell the name because it was a
[1:38:54] secret.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the supernatural birth,
[1:38:59] Amen, was being told that's what it was
[1:39:00] coming for, supernatural birth of
[1:39:02] Samson. And they went over and made an
[1:39:03] altar. And when they made that altar and
[1:39:06] sacrifice, the fire came down and
[1:39:08] consumed the altar. And the Bible said
[1:39:10] the angel went with the fire.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; That man telling you that you're about
[1:39:16] to have a child. When that fire struck
[1:39:18] that altar, it went up with the fire.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; God's fire brings them and they move in
[1:39:25] the fires of God.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; I talked to brother Billy Paul Brandham
[1:39:29] one time. I was studying angels and uh
[1:39:32] although I'm not preaching all of it
[1:39:34] this morning, I did an unde really
[1:39:35] in-depth study years back and went
[1:39:37] through every quote in every direction
[1:39:39] that you could look at an angel and but
[1:39:40] I thought of brother Billy Paul because
[1:39:42] he seen brother Bram's angel and brother
[1:39:44] Brandham identified that he's seen the
[1:39:47] same angel. You know what I'm saying?
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; So, so I called him and I said, "Brother
[1:39:51] Billy, I'd like to talk to you about
[1:39:52] that angel." It was a miracle I could
[1:39:54] get through to him, but he took time and
[1:39:56] talked to me and he told me all about
[1:39:58] it. I said, "Well, let me let me hear
[1:39:59] about it." He said, "Well, brother," he
[1:40:00] said, "Brother Brand brought me up and
[1:40:01] it was standing in the corner of the
[1:40:03] room." He held a pillow in my face and
[1:40:05] told me, he said, "Now, I'm going to
[1:40:06] take this pillow away and you're going
[1:40:07] to see this angel that comes to you,
[1:40:09] Dad." He said, "I could show you." When
[1:40:10] he took the pillow away, he said, "There
[1:40:12] was a man standing in the corner." He
[1:40:14] said he was just like dad describes him
[1:40:16] on the tape. He said he was just the way
[1:40:18] Daddy had described him. And he said,
[1:40:20] "Of course, I couldn't talk. I was so
[1:40:22] scared and frightened." He said he stood
[1:40:24] there a little while and he said,
[1:40:26] "Brother Wayne, he turned into a mist
[1:40:28] and just went out the window." He said,
[1:40:31] "Literally, he just turned into a mist
[1:40:32] and went from a from a man to a mist and
[1:40:35] just went out the window." And he said,
[1:40:36] "Where he had been standing in the room
[1:40:38] for the next half hour, a rainbow hung
[1:40:41] in the corner of our room in the middle
[1:40:43] of the night." Do you see that? That
[1:40:45] angel is real.
[1:40:48] And you see the very the very
[1:40:50] characteristics all the way back in the
[1:40:52] scriptures when you start talking about
[1:40:54] this because see we're living in special
[1:40:56] moments as brother uh brother Tim so
[1:40:58] wonderfully brought us into the Elijah
[1:41:00] ministry last night. Do you think this
[1:41:03] ministry of Elijah is less than the
[1:41:05] ministry of Elijah on the earth when he
[1:41:07] was there maybe 3,000 years ago? No.
[1:41:10] There was no there's no there's no
[1:41:12] nothing less about the message than it
[1:41:14] was back in the old. Amen. And the Bible
[1:41:17] tells us that our Elijah today, how many
[1:41:20] knows he had a real nervous problem?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; His stomach stayed all sire and tore up
[1:41:24] and and and and and it was due to his
[1:41:26] nerves. And how many knows, brother Bam
[1:41:28] actually had to leave the field one time
[1:41:30] for several days because he was so so he
[1:41:32] was got so nervous. Brother Bram, he
[1:41:34] said he actually had a a nervous
[1:41:35] breakdown. Sure. So So there was a there
[1:41:39] was a bit of a complex around that
[1:41:40] Elijah ministry. And brother Bram says
[1:41:42] in First Kings chapter 19, you're
[1:41:45] reading about Elijah. And when Elijah,
[1:41:48] he has a he has a breakdown because he's
[1:41:50] been battling with this Jezebel and and
[1:41:53] there's been such a war between the two
[1:41:55] of them and they won't repent and he's
[1:41:58] just preaching and preaching and
[1:41:59] preaching. And brother Brandham explains
[1:42:01] it in his own ministry and he says, "I
[1:42:03] would preach it like that and I'll come
[1:42:05] back next year." And he said, "It's just
[1:42:06] the same." He said, "Or it gets worse."
[1:42:09] And he said he just got so nervous and
[1:42:11] so tore up with this whole thing. And
[1:42:14] brother Bram explains this and and
[1:42:15] starts talking about him and why here's
[1:42:17] thou Elijah. See what happens with
[1:42:20] Elijah is he gets so he gets so tired.
[1:42:23] How many knows that when you get real
[1:42:25] nervous or anxious sometimes makes you
[1:42:26] real tired. People go to bed and they
[1:42:29] don't get up for days because they get
[1:42:30] so tired and so anxious. And brother
[1:42:32] Bham said he was so tired. He was so
[1:42:34] weary from the battle that he was
[1:42:36] walking up the hill and just fell over
[1:42:38] in the weeds. Now that's that's how
[1:42:41] tired he was. He just fell over in the
[1:42:43] weeds and said, "I'll just lay here a
[1:42:45] little while. I just I'm just tired. I'm
[1:42:48] too tired to get up." And so he just
[1:42:50] began to lay there. But see, amen. even
[1:42:53] falling in the weeds of that wilderness.
[1:42:54] There's scorpions and snakes and there's
[1:42:56] every kind of hyena and and there's uh
[1:42:59] actually snow leopards and and jaguars
[1:43:02] and there's all kinds of big cats and
[1:43:04] they're there in those wildernesses. I
[1:43:06] think even during that time it talks
[1:43:07] about lions. You know, David had whipped
[1:43:09] lions in that area. So, there's all
[1:43:11] kinds of animals there. But isn't it
[1:43:13] amazing that nothing touched Elijah?
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; That he just without care, without
[1:43:18] picking the right spot, just fell over
[1:43:20] in the weeds and started sleeping. Amen.
[1:43:22] But there wasn't one spider. There
[1:43:24] wasn't one snake. There wasn't one
[1:43:26] alligator. There wasn't one jaguar.
[1:43:28] There wasn't one lion. There wasn't one
[1:43:30] elephant there. Amen. You can sit here
[1:43:32] for a week and name the animals. Nothing
[1:43:34] could touch him.
[1:43:37] Because when that son of God fell over
[1:43:39] in them weeds and began to relax, Amen.
[1:43:42] Brother Ram said there was about 10,000
[1:43:45] angels watching him.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; That's a lot of folk. That's a lot
[1:43:52] bigger than the than the secret service
[1:43:53] around the president. You know,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; there's one assurance the believers
[1:43:58] have. Though the world turns you down,
[1:44:00] God loves you. And the world may call
[1:44:02] you a holy roller and they may call you
[1:44:04] a fanatic. But if you're true to God,
[1:44:07] God loves you and the angels are
[1:44:10] encamped about those who fear him.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; I love how he says it here. He says,
[1:44:16] "I'd imagine on every limb." All around
[1:44:20] through that place was swarms of angels.
[1:44:23] And God came down and said, "My poor
[1:44:25] tired servant, he's so nervous and so
[1:44:28] tore up and he don't know what to do. I
[1:44:31] want to pick out one of those angels
[1:44:33] standing there with the softest hands.
[1:44:38] Don't you love it, brother Matthew? God
[1:44:41] lined up 10,000 angels and he went
[1:44:44] through and took his time, his godly
[1:44:47] efforts, and I'm sure he's very
[1:44:49] sensitive. And he said, "Let me feel let
[1:44:51] me feel your hands.
[1:44:54] I I want to I want to feel for the for
[1:44:56] 10,000." And he he's feeling for that
[1:44:59] one just that that one angel, you know.
[1:45:02] I want I want to feel I want to feel
[1:45:04] that softness. I want to feel something
[1:45:07] that could take a nervous man. Amen. And
[1:45:10] and and touch his brow. I I want I I
[1:45:13] want to find that soft, brother Joe. I
[1:45:15] want to find that hand that can deal
[1:45:17] with a nervous problem on one of my sons
[1:45:20] or one of my servants. And they they
[1:45:22] have such a touch that they can bring
[1:45:24] comfort and they can bring a a peace
[1:45:27] into a nervous heart. Amen. And there
[1:45:30] Elijah lays and God is doing the
[1:45:32] choosing of what's going to deal with
[1:45:34] him. And he says to them angels, 10,000
[1:45:36] of you get down there. You strike up the
[1:45:39] bands. I want some sleeping music for my
[1:45:41] boy. I want you, boy. You with the
[1:45:43] softest hands. I want you. Only job you
[1:45:46] got now, brother Aaron. Just one job.
[1:45:49] The only job you got, Amen, is just
[1:45:51] brow. Just Just touch the brow. I That's
[1:45:54] all. Just one job now. Amen. And just
[1:45:56] touch that. Touch that brow. Amen. And I
[1:45:58] want you to put him to sleep. That's
[1:46:00] what I want out of you. Do you see God
[1:46:03] think so much of his children? Amen.
[1:46:06] That he would go through the efforts of
[1:46:07] picking out one angel in the heavens to
[1:46:11] just follow you around and just pet your
[1:46:14] brow. You all know what I'm talking
[1:46:16] about. When you lay down at night and
[1:46:18] you're so weary with the bills and the
[1:46:20] troubles and mama, you got children
[1:46:22] trouble and you don't know what to do
[1:46:24] and there three of them sick and you got
[1:46:26] church tomorrow and did I stay home or
[1:46:28] do I go to church or what do I do? Amen.
[1:46:31] God sends that angel in there and he
[1:46:34] begins to pet that brow and he begins to
[1:46:36] hum over you. Amen. And tell you all
[1:46:39] night, all day angels are watching over
[1:46:44] you, my son. All night, all day, angels
[1:46:50] are watching over you. He sees that time
[1:46:54] when you're in your weariest. Brother
[1:46:56] Brother Ron, when you're in that area of
[1:46:58] discouragement, God has got an angel
[1:47:01] that all he's got to do is come down at
[1:47:04] the house and he'll say, "Listen, Sister
[1:47:07] Connie, move over a minute. You're soft,
[1:47:09] but I got something softer. I want to
[1:47:11] touch my son. I want to I want to put
[1:47:14] him in a sleep where he can relax his
[1:47:16] spirit.
[1:47:21] [Applause]
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Hey, while they're playing music and
[1:47:25] while you're while you're getting his
[1:47:26] brow, hey, put the five-star cooks on,
[1:47:29] we got to put we got to cook something
[1:47:31] up for this young man. and they start
[1:47:33] dropping them supernatural vitamins in
[1:47:36] there that could take a man with stage
[1:47:38] four cancer four years into it. He can
[1:47:41] get up and walk three miles. It ain't
[1:47:43] medication, brother. It's a supernatural
[1:47:45] element that God puts in his food and
[1:47:48] able that gives strength to the weary.
[1:47:52] I'm telling you, God has got angels
[1:47:55] food. It'll give strength to the weary.
[1:48:01] If you ain't sleeping at night, let me
[1:48:03] tell you, God's got some angels to put
[1:48:05] around your bed.
[1:48:08] I ain't pulling it tear strange. But
[1:48:10] when you're wary, brother Tim, and
[1:48:11] you're at that house by yourself. Amen.
[1:48:14] Brother man told us what it was like
[1:48:15] when he lost his wife. It actually put
[1:48:18] him in the third pull one time because
[1:48:19] he was so lonely. But listen, there's no
[1:48:22] reason because God has got an angel to
[1:48:24] send down and pet the brow of our
[1:48:27] brother Tim and just remind him she's
[1:48:31] over here with us, brother Tim.
[1:48:34] She's better off today than she was when
[1:48:37] she was here on the earth.
[1:48:42] So, Brother Wayne, you're taking this
[1:48:44] too far. Brother Bam said God is not a
[1:48:45] respector of person. And he said, "The
[1:48:48] same angel he had for Elijah, he's got
[1:48:50] for you."
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Well, how does God spread out all these
[1:48:57] angels?
[1:48:59] It's cuz he's got a lot of them.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; God ain't angel poor, folks.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; God ain't got to call people and figure
[1:49:12] out who's going to who's going to pick
[1:49:13] this up and who's going to take that.
[1:49:15] And we got five coming in to Ron Oak. We
[1:49:17] got two coming into Harrisonburg. And we
[1:49:19] need somebody to get somebody to the
[1:49:20] hotel. We need God ain't ain't got just
[1:49:23] five drivers
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; when Elisha and Gahesa were in the cabin
[1:49:31] down there and Elisha had made the
[1:49:33] Syrian army mad. Y'all remember that?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Because the Syrian army said, "We surely
[1:49:38] got us a spy among us." And somebody
[1:49:40] said, "Oh no, they got a prophet among
[1:49:41] them.
[1:49:43] The spying hears the prophet is there.
[1:49:46] So, you know what they decided to do?
[1:49:47] We'll kill the prophet. We'll destroy
[1:49:49] the prophet and we'll destroy Israel.
[1:49:51] Now, if you've ever wondered why that
[1:49:53] bunch of anti- message people, those
[1:49:56] critics can get on YouTube and every
[1:49:58] which way and just try their best to
[1:50:01] kill and slay and murder brother
[1:50:02] Brandham.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; You know why they do that awful stuff?
[1:50:05] Because we got all of their secrets.
[1:50:09] We know where the devil's going to
[1:50:12] strike before he strikes.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; We know his methods. I loved how brother
[1:50:17] Tim said it last night. He trailed that
[1:50:20] serpent.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; You know, a good tracker is a good
[1:50:22] guide. A good guide is a good tracker.
[1:50:24] Brother Brandham was a best of guides.
[1:50:25] But he also was a tracker. And they say
[1:50:27] of a good tracker, he could track a
[1:50:29] snake across the rock. And Brother
[1:50:32] Brandham could track that snake all
[1:50:33] across the the church. And he could show
[1:50:36] you his spirit and where he went and
[1:50:38] what he did and this and that. But they
[1:50:39] want to destroy the prophet. But that's
[1:50:42] not the purpose.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; William Brandham is not their target.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; You are their target.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; But the seer is your defense. So if they
[1:50:54] can knock down your radar, your air
[1:50:57] defense system, then they can just bomb
[1:50:59] you. Well, I tell you this, you ain't
[1:51:01] bombing my house. You ain't bombing my
[1:51:04] church. We're going to keep our radar.
[1:51:06] We're going to keep our vision. We're
[1:51:08] going to keep our prophet.
[1:51:12] He knows that devil and how he's coming
[1:51:14] and what his plans are.
[1:51:19] We're not giving it up.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; So they thought, "Well, we'll just take
[1:51:23] him then." So they come down there and
[1:51:24] y'all know the story. And the and the
[1:51:26] Syrian army come down there after Elisha
[1:51:28] and Gahesa looked over at him and said,
[1:51:30] "Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. What
[1:51:31] are we going to do? How are we going to
[1:51:32] get out of this? What they they're
[1:51:34] saying this about brother Brandham.
[1:51:35] They're saying this about brother
[1:51:36] Brandham. were saying this about how are
[1:51:37] we going to get out of this? And Elisha
[1:51:39] finally said, "Lord, would you open this
[1:51:42] boy's eyes?
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; There's more with us
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; than there is with them."
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; And my Bible said when his eyes were
[1:51:52] opened up, he saw the mountains were
[1:51:55] full of the chariots of fire of Almighty
[1:51:58] God.
[1:52:00] It wasn't just a few. The mountains were
[1:52:02] full of them. Now, I will I will point
[1:52:04] out something here. Those angels never
[1:52:06] entered that battle. Those angels never
[1:52:09] done one thing in that battle other than
[1:52:12] encourage Gahesa.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; And sometimes God just opens your eyes
[1:52:17] to encourage you to let you know you're
[1:52:20] not by yourself in this battle.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; This is not just another message. It's a
[1:52:26] king's message. The mountains were on
[1:52:29] fire with the chariots of angels.
[1:52:32] Now, can we measure just a moment
[1:52:35] angels?
[1:52:37] In Matthew 26, Jesus himself said,
[1:52:39] "Think it not that my father that he
[1:52:42] shall presently give me more than 12
[1:52:44] legions of angels." Now, 12 legions is a
[1:52:48] a numeral speaking of the Roman army.
[1:52:51] And what a legion actually represents,
[1:52:54] Amen. is it it represents here 12
[1:52:56] legions. A legion is 6,000 soldiers. So
[1:53:00] he's talking about 72,000
[1:53:04] angels that my father could see. Now
[1:53:06] 72,000.
[1:53:10] What's here this morning? 3 400 people.
[1:53:13] A lot of folk.
[1:53:16] 72,000.
[1:53:19] How many people's in Harrisonenburg?
[1:53:23] 72,000. You say, "Well, that's a lot of
[1:53:25] angels." But if you get the impact of
[1:53:28] the statement, it means more than that.
[1:53:31] Because I'm I I I like my Bible. How
[1:53:32] many likes your Bible?
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; If you're a Bible reader, in First Kings
[1:53:37] chapter 19 and verse 35, there was a
[1:53:40] battle going on where they were trying
[1:53:42] to kill Hezekiah. And they said, "We're
[1:53:44] going to come into Jerusalem and destroy
[1:53:45] it." And Hezekiah wrote the took the
[1:53:48] letter that was sent to him to destroy
[1:53:50] him. And he and he went, excuse me, the
[1:53:53] king, it was Hezekiah sin, I believe.
[1:53:54] And the king went into the tabernacle
[1:53:56] and laid the letter from his enemy on
[1:53:59] the altar. And God said, "Don't you
[1:54:01] worry. Not one arrow will come into
[1:54:03] Jerusalem."
[1:54:04] And that night,
[1:54:06] one,
[1:54:08] somebody say one.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; One,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; one angel went into the camp of the
[1:54:12] enemy
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; and slayed a
[1:54:16] 185,000
[1:54:18] soldiers.
[1:54:21] One angel
[1:54:24] slayed 185,000
[1:54:27] demons.
[1:54:28] [Applause]
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; So when Jesus says, "I have 72,000
[1:54:33] angels to send into the battle right
[1:54:35] now," what he's telling you is 72,000
[1:54:38] times 185,000, I have ability right now
[1:54:43] to destroy 13 billion enemies in one
[1:54:47] prayer.
[1:54:51] There is only 8 billion people on the
[1:54:53] earth. He could destroy the earth two
[1:54:57] times
[1:54:59] with just one prayer with the amount of
[1:55:01] angels. Now, I tell you this, the devil
[1:55:03] can't wrestle up enough devils.
[1:55:06] When you put 300 believers together and
[1:55:09] you carry a company of angels of 72,000
[1:55:13] around every believer in this message,
[1:55:16] you ain't got enough devils in hell to
[1:55:18] cover one of the children of God.
[1:55:22] [Applause]
[1:55:23] Brother, I tell you what, the devil
[1:55:25] don't realize what he's dealing with. We
[1:55:27] are the children of God. We come from
[1:55:30] heaven. We are the sons and the
[1:55:33] daughters of Abraham.
[1:55:36] So, Brother Wayne, do they just show up
[1:55:38] out now and again? Nope.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; My Bible said they camp with you
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; all the time. If you want to win it in
[1:55:45] the scriptures, it's Psalms 34:7. The
[1:55:47] angel of the Lord encampeth about them
[1:55:49] that fear them. in Psalms chapter 91 and
[1:55:52] 11, one of his favorite scriptures, he
[1:55:54] shall give his angels charge over thee
[1:55:57] to keep thee in all thy ways, and they
[1:56:00] shall bear thee up in their hands unless
[1:56:03] thou dash thy foot against the stone.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; God's got those angels and they're
[1:56:11] camped wherever you're camped. I know
[1:56:14] devil hates this part.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; You can't outrun it, Sister Janet.
[1:56:20] There's a whole host of them carrying
[1:56:22] with you, you know. Amen. How do you go
[1:56:24] up and down that road sometimes? Amen.
[1:56:26] And you don't have no wreck and you
[1:56:28] don't have no flat tire and you don't
[1:56:29] have this. It ain't because the devil
[1:56:31] ain't shooting everything in hell at
[1:56:33] you. It's because there's angels
[1:56:35] guarding. How is it that you can get
[1:56:37] into terrific accidents, but you walk
[1:56:39] out of them? How is it that believers go
[1:56:41] into serious things, but they come out,
[1:56:43] okay? You are not just a natural people.
[1:56:47] You are the heir of salvation and God
[1:56:50] has a host,
[1:56:53] [Applause]
[1:56:57] brother Wayne. That's all Old Testament.
[1:56:59] No, brother. The New Testament is more
[1:57:01] full than the Old Testament.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Well, should should should How many
[1:57:06] knows about John's dad? You ever read
[1:57:08] about John's dad, Zachcharias? Do y'all
[1:57:10] know what he was doing when angel came?
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; He wasn't doing nothing special. He was
[1:57:14] just fulfilling the duties of a priest
[1:57:15] just like what I'm doing right now. He
[1:57:17] was just fulfilling his duty. He wasn't
[1:57:20] expecting nothing. He wasn't looking for
[1:57:22] nothing. He was just doing the God-
[1:57:24] called duty he had. And while he was
[1:57:26] doing that, God showed up and said,
[1:57:29] "There's going to be a supernatural
[1:57:30] birth in your home, and thou shalt call
[1:57:32] his name John." And he didn't want to
[1:57:34] believe it.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; But you know what God done? He shut up
[1:57:37] his mouth until the scriptures, amen, or
[1:57:40] the angel's words were fulfilled, amen,
[1:57:42] through Zachcharias because an angel was
[1:57:45] not moving him toward the natural. He
[1:57:47] was moving him toward the supernatural.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say I'll say this right here
[1:57:53] this morning. You know, there's a devil
[1:57:55] out here in this world trying to take
[1:57:58] the womb of our mothers in this
[1:58:00] generation.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And people are aborting children
[1:58:03] and they're trying to kill children. And
[1:58:05] some of our believing sisters are doing
[1:58:07] their best to have children. And
[1:58:09] sometimes they can't have children. But
[1:58:12] the same angel that come down here to
[1:58:14] Zachcharias is still moving in the
[1:58:17] church of the living God.
[1:58:20] [Applause]
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; You can believe me or not believe me,
[1:58:27] but it's my testimony.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about what I read. I'm
[1:58:33] talking about what happened to me.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; I had a I had a desire of a grandchild.
[1:58:40] I wanted a grandchild really bad. If my
[1:58:42] boy had to get married, Brother Timothy,
[1:58:44] I wanted a baby out of that mar. I mean,
[1:58:46] if we're going to get a if we're going
[1:58:48] to get a my boy's going to get married,
[1:58:49] I I got to have a grandbaby out of this.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; It's the reward for not killing your
[1:58:55] children. They say,
[1:58:57] [Applause]
[1:58:58] "I let him live so I could have a
[1:59:00] grandbaby."
[1:59:02] And they and they were misaring and
[1:59:04] miscaring and misaring and they got to
[1:59:06] talking about her having disease and
[1:59:08] some kind of a that sounded bad. They
[1:59:10] they had some kind of a a a physical
[1:59:13] ailment, a problem that run their family
[1:59:15] line. She wasn't going to be able to
[1:59:16] have children and and and I watched her
[1:59:18] go from from maybe every couple months I
[1:59:21] would see the depression hit her when
[1:59:23] she would when she would realize that it
[1:59:24] wasn't going to happen. And and it was
[1:59:26] happening and happening. We were praying
[1:59:28] and we were asking God and I was sitting
[1:59:30] in a meeting and brother Ron would come
[1:59:32] in one October I believe it was and he
[1:59:33] come down there and and and she come up
[1:59:36] for prayer and when she came up I said
[1:59:38] something in my heart to the Lord I said
[1:59:40] if Zach would come up with her I I
[1:59:42] believe it means something and Zach got
[1:59:44] up and come and joined her and they walk
[1:59:45] up to brother Ron and they asked I don't
[1:59:47] remember exactly how they asked it but
[1:59:49] he told you the situation said we'd like
[1:59:51] to have a child and brother Ron began to
[1:59:53] pray for them just like we all do you
[1:59:55] know if somebody comes to you and you
[1:59:57] pray. You know, sometimes you minister
[1:59:58] to somebody. Amen. And and and you're
[2:00:01] just ministering. You're talking. You're
[2:00:02] praying. That's just me. That's just
[2:00:04] Brother Ron. That's just a believer.
[2:00:06] You're you're you're taking what you
[2:00:07] know about the word and you're
[2:00:08] ministering to him. Amen. And I've stood
[2:00:10] next to Brother Ron in prayer line after
[2:00:12] prayer line and we've seen that and I've
[2:00:13] did it and he's did it. But something
[2:00:15] changed in that prayer line. And all of
[2:00:18] a sudden, he said, "Sister, you're going
[2:00:19] to have that child." And I went, "Oh,
[2:00:20] wait a minute.
[2:00:23] That's different.
[2:00:25] Something just changed here. And then
[2:00:28] later I came down here and preached. How
[2:00:30] many remembers it? We we clipped it. We
[2:00:32] clipped the video. Amen. And I said, you
[2:00:34] know, I'm going to be a granddaddy. And
[2:00:36] I said, and you go see the video. And I
[2:00:38] said, I don't have no pregnancy test,
[2:00:40] but I got faith.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Ron was sitting right there
[2:00:44] where you are, Brother William. And he
[2:00:45] cried out and he said, "Brother Wayne,
[2:00:47] that's thus saith the Lord."
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I went home and about uh maybe
[2:00:54] six, eight weeks, six months later, I
[2:00:56] don't remember. Zachariah and and and
[2:00:59] Amen. And here's why. Uh I was there at
[2:01:01] the house one day and and I I seen that
[2:01:04] Anna come up out of the basement there
[2:01:06] and man, she was just weeping. And I
[2:01:08] seen her go over and talk to Chissa and
[2:01:10] Chissa was just weeping. And I just went
[2:01:12] out the house and I took a little walk
[2:01:15] and took a jog and I was telling the
[2:01:16] Lord, I said, "Lord,
[2:01:20] I wanted that baby. These kids can't
[2:01:22] take no more disappointments. It's just
[2:01:23] too much. Now, if if some of you if you
[2:01:26] if you really love somebody, that's a
[2:01:28] hard thing for a person. And I was just
[2:01:31] explaining to the Lord that we just
[2:01:33] can't take another disappointment, Lord.
[2:01:35] And I really was trusting this would be
[2:01:38] the time. And I felt real bad. I got
[2:01:40] back to the house and Anna and Chrissa
[2:01:43] came up. Anna hands me a card and it's a
[2:01:46] crazy pregnancy test. She's announcing
[2:01:48] she gonna have a baby.
[2:01:51] That crying, that crying wasn't a
[2:01:54] miscarriage. That crying was we was
[2:01:57] about to have a baby and she was
[2:01:58] overjoyed.
[2:02:01] Brother, my crying turned to joy. My
[2:02:04] mourning turned to rejoicing.
[2:02:09] An angel got involved in human affairs
[2:02:13] and I got a grandbaby.
[2:02:17] Not just one. I got five of them today
[2:02:20] because God gets involved.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, God got involved with
[2:02:26] Bryce and Stephanie. That last boy, you
[2:02:28] remember you was probably in the
[2:02:29] meeting. I was preaching and I was
[2:02:31] preaching along and I was talking about
[2:02:33] Mary and Sarah. And I said, "God changed
[2:02:35] Sarah's body and he gave Mary a virgin
[2:02:38] birth." And I was looking right at
[2:02:39] Stephanie and I didn't know why. And I
[2:02:41] said, "And God could change your body
[2:02:43] and give you what you have need of." And
[2:02:45] about a year later, she come and visited
[2:02:46] the church. She said, "Here's that baby
[2:02:48] you said I could have." I said, "I said
[2:02:50] you could have it." She said, "Well,
[2:02:52] while you was preaching, you spoke it
[2:02:54] right to me." I said, "Well, I didn't
[2:02:55] know it, but God knew it because he gets
[2:02:58] involved.
[2:02:59] [Applause]
[2:03:03] I don't know where Cheyenne's at in
[2:03:04] here, but Cheyenne and Nathan wasn't
[2:03:07] supposed to be able to have no more
[2:03:08] babies, but God told him he was going to
[2:03:10] have a little baby boy. And he come
[2:03:12] through a prayer line down there at
[2:03:13] Nathan Bryce. And we laid hands on him.
[2:03:16] And when he left there, he said, "God's
[2:03:18] touched me tonight, Brother Wayne." And
[2:03:20] just a little while later, he had his
[2:03:22] little girl, Rosie. And it wasn't just a
[2:03:24] little while, he had his little boy,
[2:03:26] Reed. And they're right here. You know
[2:03:28] why? Because God got involved, an angel
[2:03:32] got involved in human affairs.
[2:03:38] I told that story on a platform in 2021
[2:03:42] at Cloverdale Bible Way. And there was a
[2:03:45] brother sitting on the piano, Brother
[2:03:46] Ryan, who had went through miscarriage
[2:03:49] after miscarriage after miscarriage. And
[2:03:51] while he was sitting there and I was
[2:03:53] telling these stories, something in his
[2:03:56] heart said, "You'll have a child and
[2:03:58] thou shalt call his name Samuel." The
[2:04:01] next year, I went back and dedicated
[2:04:03] that baby. You know why? Because God got
[2:04:06] involved in human affairs.
[2:04:11] That same angel is in this building
[2:04:13] right now. He is not a respector of
[2:04:16] persons. If you're a child of God,
[2:04:20] [Applause]
[2:04:25] you said, "Brother Wayne,
[2:04:28] you've lost your mind." No, I've not.
[2:04:29] I've not lost my mind, y'all. Y'all, I
[2:04:31] am so scriptural.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; If you take your Bible, you would have
[2:04:37] to be crazy to not believe what I am
[2:04:39] saying.
[2:04:42] Amen.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Mary met an angel and it prompted her to
[2:04:47] believe that a woman could have a child
[2:04:51] without knowing a man.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Angels propped shepherds that they would
[2:04:58] worship him when he was born. Angels
[2:05:01] ministered to Jesus while he was in the
[2:05:04] wilderness.
[2:05:07] In John the 5th chapter, even in the
[2:05:10] presence of the physical body of Jesus,
[2:05:13] angels were still appearing.
[2:05:17] Now, I'm in the Bible. Now, one of the
[2:05:20] great one of the great scriptures that
[2:05:22] Brother Bam discusses how one person
[2:05:24] could be healed and others are not
[2:05:25] healed is the pool of Bethesda. Remember
[2:05:28] that?
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; And he said that when in John chapter 5,
[2:05:31] there was a pool. Anybody ever been to
[2:05:33] that pool of Bethesda?
[2:05:35] Have you been there? I've actually been
[2:05:37] to that pool. It's It's not a real
[2:05:39] elegantl looking place. It's just a It's
[2:05:42] just a hole in the ground, but pool, but
[2:05:43] it's important to us because an angel
[2:05:46] visited that place.
[2:05:48] Now, I went there and it's something
[2:05:52] else. We had this woman uh tour guide.
[2:05:54] She was a real educated lady. She was
[2:05:56] educated in the Old Testament. She was a
[2:05:57] Jew. She had PhD and doctorates of every
[2:05:59] which kind and psychology and uh geology
[2:06:02] and something uh every which kind of
[2:06:04] that you could have. She had it. She was
[2:06:06] a real educated lady. And when we come
[2:06:08] out to pull up Bethesda, she said there
[2:06:09] was a there is a Greek mythology
[2:06:13] that winds used to blow a certain way in
[2:06:15] here and caused a disturbance in the
[2:06:16] water and they said it was an angel. I
[2:06:19] said, "Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait,
[2:06:20] wait, wait a minute."
[2:06:24] She said, "What?" I said, "Do you
[2:06:26] believe the Old Bible?" She said, "I
[2:06:27] do." I said, "What do you think it was
[2:06:30] that got on that brass serpent that
[2:06:32] healed them people?"
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; I said, "Do you think that brass bead
[2:06:37] out of a out of a Egyptian solders's
[2:06:39] helmet healed the people? Do you think
[2:06:41] that's what it was?"
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, I really don't know
[2:06:43] what it was." I said, "It was an angel."
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; The angel would got down on that pole
[2:06:49] and that angel was there for healing for
[2:06:52] those people. And brother Bram said they
[2:06:54] got to idolizing that pole and angel
[2:06:56] that that serpent until God destroyed
[2:06:59] it, but he's always interested in the
[2:07:01] healing of his children. So then the
[2:07:03] wind started moving on that pull. And
[2:07:06] brother Bam said what it was was an
[2:07:08] angel would step in that water and
[2:07:10] trouble it.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; And then I I know y'all know this,
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; but it was why the waters were troubled.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; That if somebody would step into that
[2:07:19] water, they'd be healed right then. See,
[2:07:21] because the angel was in it. Now, the
[2:07:23] real the real secret here, the one what
[2:07:26] the world is missing is the angels were
[2:07:29] invisible,
[2:07:30] but they could see the water.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; So, when the water moved, it was a
[2:07:37] physical sign of a supernatural
[2:07:40] movement.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; They had no other way to know. There was
[2:07:44] no like there was no bell hanging up
[2:07:46] next to the pool. When the angel come
[2:07:48] for healing, he didn't go ring this bell
[2:07:50] and then everybody go, "Oh, we go down
[2:07:52] there now. The angel's down there now."
[2:07:53] Or he didn't he didn't uh he didn't have
[2:07:56] this great rainbow that shoot up out of
[2:07:58] the heavens.
[2:08:00] What the sign was when he was there was
[2:08:03] the movement on that water
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; and they hey whether they was educated
[2:08:08] or uneducated or high class or low class
[2:08:11] whatever they was they could all look at
[2:08:13] that water
[2:08:15] and they had a choice to get into the
[2:08:17] water when it was moving. Now when
[2:08:19] brother Brandham takes that, he says,
[2:08:21] "Listen now, how appropriate is tonight
[2:08:24] that that same angel
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; that was in that water has returned to
[2:08:30] the earth today
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; and he is now troubling the waters."
[2:08:34] Now, how many knows what the waters
[2:08:36] represent today?
[2:08:39] The Bible said the people are the
[2:08:41] multitude of waters.
[2:08:44] So today, instead of ringing a bell or
[2:08:46] or or or or instead of a great star
[2:08:49] shining or shooting or Amen, the prophet
[2:08:52] is showing us that when the angel begins
[2:08:55] to move that you see it on the people,
[2:08:59] the people themselves. And brother man
[2:09:01] says he begins to whip them from the
[2:09:04] natural to the supernatural. He said,
[2:09:06] "You see normal people begin to scream
[2:09:09] and shout. And you see normal people
[2:09:13] start acting unseemly. You see addicts
[2:09:16] turn sober. You see drunks turn into
[2:09:18] preachers. You've got people sitting
[2:09:20] here that's got records and troubles
[2:09:23] behind them. But all of a sudden, you
[2:09:25] see the troubling of the water and
[2:09:27] something changed their life. If you can
[2:09:30] see that, it means there's an angel
[2:09:33] troubling the waters. And if you got a
[2:09:36] need, get in the water now.
[2:09:42] Don't wait for another meeting. Don't
[2:09:45] wait for another service. Come on,
[2:09:47] church. Amen. You You got to get that
[2:09:50] out of your mind. It's not one building.
[2:09:53] It's not one meeting. It's not one
[2:09:55] service. It's the troubling of the human
[2:09:57] race that God is moving upon the church.
[2:10:01] And if you'll step into the water while
[2:10:03] the waters are being troubled, you say,
[2:10:05] "Brother Wayne, what are we what are we
[2:10:06] waiting on?" We ain't waiting on
[2:10:07] nothing.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; I already see the troubling of the
[2:10:11] waters. I already see people healed. I
[2:10:13] already seen people saved. Amen. All you
[2:10:16] got to do is get up and get in.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; It don't have to be anything special.
[2:10:21] You say, "I need a blessing." I say,
[2:10:23] "Come get your blessing. I need the Holy
[2:10:26] Ghost. Come get your Holy Ghost. I need
[2:10:29] a healing. Come get your healing. You
[2:10:32] don't have to wait another minute. You
[2:10:35] don't have to wait for prayer. You don't
[2:10:37] have to wait for a right preacher. You
[2:10:39] don't have to wait for a right meeting.
[2:10:41] The waters are troubled. The angel has
[2:10:44] come into the camp. The shout of the
[2:10:48] king is in the camp. The waters have
[2:10:51] been troubled for your healing, for your
[2:10:54] salvation, for your deliverance.
[2:10:57] supernatural movements.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Wayne, I tell you what I'm
[2:11:03] in this morning. I'm in a real battle.
[2:11:05] I'm in a battle. How many of you in a
[2:11:06] battle? I'm in a battle. Some of you
[2:11:09] have been in battles a long time and
[2:11:11] you've wondered what to do. And
[2:11:12] sometimes we go offcock.
[2:11:15] We do. We attack before we think about
[2:11:18] what to do or how to do it. Well, I tell
[2:11:20] you, if there's one thing pastoring will
[2:11:21] do for you, it'll make you slow down and
[2:11:23] wait on the Lord.
[2:11:26] Because when he fixes it, it's fixed.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; It helps me understand this. And I'm not
[2:11:32] going to preach all day. So, but I I
[2:11:34] want you to see something here in the
[2:11:36] Bible, a man named David. when the Bible
[2:11:39] said that he had a a camp of Philistines
[2:11:43] that come up against him
[2:11:45] that David didn't immediately now he
[2:11:48] knew that was his enemy and he knew he
[2:11:50] had whipped Philistines before but David
[2:11:53] didn't immediately just pick up and run
[2:11:56] into the battle but he went to the Lord
[2:12:00] and he said to the Lord now here's my
[2:12:02] enemy
[2:12:03] what should I do and the Lord said to
[2:12:06] him you see that group of Mberries over
[2:12:09] on the wall a tree line there. Yeah, I
[2:12:11] see them, Lord. He said, "Well, I want
[2:12:13] you to go over there and get you a chair
[2:12:16] and I want you to turn your back to the
[2:12:17] battle and won't you look at them
[2:12:19] Philistines now. I want you to sit and
[2:12:22] look them trees." And when them trees go
[2:12:25] to blowing, you tell your men, "Get in
[2:12:27] the battle."
[2:12:29] Brother Timothy, I can't even imagine
[2:12:31] going back to all them great generals,
[2:12:34] them great warriors, and sets them all
[2:12:37] down. And they say, "Okay, David, what
[2:12:38] are we going to do?" He said, "Here's
[2:12:39] what we're going to do, boys. We're
[2:12:40] going to watch him trees.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; You mean you don't want us to send no
[2:12:49] scouts to measure?" No, no, no. It's
[2:12:52] going to discourage you when you do. No,
[2:12:54] no, no. Just watch them trees.
[2:12:56] I don't want you looking at the battle
[2:12:58] at all. I don't want you counting the
[2:13:01] enemy. I don't want you looking at their
[2:13:03] spears. I don't want you looking at
[2:13:04] their swords. I don't want I I don't
[2:13:06] want you remembering the things that
[2:13:08] they have done and who they done it. I
[2:13:10] don't want you to do none of that. I
[2:13:11] want you to look at them trees right
[2:13:13] there.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now here's the thing. Amen.
[2:13:16] When they were looking, they must have
[2:13:18] thought this man was crazy.
[2:13:22] You mean you're not going to consult one
[2:13:24] psychologist?
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; You're not going to You don't have any
[2:13:29] books on 10 steps of how to overcome?
[2:13:33] You You mean You mean we're not going to
[2:13:34] have any classes?
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; You're hallelujah.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; I can't tell where that come from, but
[2:13:42] God bless you.
[2:13:45] You You You mean David, you're simply
[2:13:48] just going to wait on that wind? That's
[2:13:51] all you're going to do? Really? Yeah.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; See, David had already been in battle in
[2:13:56] his life.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; And he knew there was nothing within
[2:14:00] himself or his army that could defeat
[2:14:02] the greatness of the Philistine army.
[2:14:05] But as he had been with Saul, he knew
[2:14:07] the God of battle.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; Now, how many knows the the secret
[2:14:11] behind the malberry tree? If you know
[2:14:13] the secret, raise your hand. There's a
[2:14:16] secret behind it.
[2:14:18] He was waiting on that wind because God
[2:14:21] when he prayed was sending angels into
[2:14:24] that battle and God was telling him when
[2:14:27] you see those trees move you'll know
[2:14:31] then that's the angels on their way to
[2:14:33] the Philistines and when you see the
[2:14:36] tree move you get to moving. When you
[2:14:39] see them trees moving, you get in the
[2:14:42] battle because the angels are going to
[2:14:44] be in front of you and instead see like
[2:14:46] if you just hit one angel, five's going
[2:14:48] to fall. You're going to look like a
[2:14:50] mighty bunch of people, you're just
[2:14:52] going to whip them every which way. But
[2:14:54] see, it's because the angels got in the
[2:14:56] battle in front of you. Listen, you
[2:14:58] might not be able to see the angels, but
[2:15:00] you can see the wind when it moves. And
[2:15:02] sometimes in these services, God will
[2:15:05] let the spirit start moving across
[2:15:07] trees. Men are trees in the Bible. And
[2:15:11] when the wind starts blowing across the
[2:15:13] trees, all the sudden, you're sitting
[2:15:16] there with a need in your body. Get up
[2:15:18] and get in the battle. Get up and get in
[2:15:21] the battle. I'll tell you, it's your
[2:15:24] time for deliverance. It's your moment
[2:15:26] for deliverance. Right now is when you
[2:15:28] can get saved right now. Don't wait for
[2:15:31] another week. Don't wait for another
[2:15:32] hour. Right now is your moment.
[2:15:38] Huh? There was all kinds of angels
[2:15:41] entering that battle. Brother, let me
[2:15:42] tell you this. When David went down
[2:15:44] there, he utterly defeated his enemy
[2:15:46] because he waited for the precise moment
[2:15:49] that angels were accompanying him into
[2:15:51] that battle. And I tell you this right
[2:15:53] now, some of you have wanted a blessing
[2:15:55] from the How many wants a blessing from
[2:15:57] God? Some of you have wanted a real Holy
[2:16:00] Ghost experience and you wanted to find
[2:16:02] yourself in the presence of God and what
[2:16:04] to do. You said, "Brother Wayne, how do
[2:16:06] we do it? How do we get in? What
[2:16:08] happens? What could take place?" Well,
[2:16:10] you know, I was I was studying this and
[2:16:12] I thought it was amazing. Amen. That
[2:16:14] brother Brandham was was going to tell
[2:16:16] us something. Now, if a man is blind, he
[2:16:20] can only he's got he he don't have all
[2:16:22] of his senses, right? So, so maybe you
[2:16:25] just take and and you you you shut
[2:16:27] somebody's eyes and Amen. Brother Aaron,
[2:16:29] shut your eyes right quick. Just shut
[2:16:31] your eyes and don't reopen them. Okay?
[2:16:32] Amen. Come right here. Amen. I want you
[2:16:34] to do me a favor. Amen. I want you to
[2:16:36] tell me who's standing in front of you.
[2:16:39] And there really is. You feel the touch.
[2:16:41] Amen. Now, you tell me who that is. You
[2:16:43] can't tell me because your eyes is
[2:16:45] closed. I can tell you who is. Brother
[2:16:46] Matt. Now, open your eyes. It's Brother
[2:16:49] Matt. Yes, sir.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; You see that? It wasn't it wasn't hard
[2:16:53] for me because I could see it.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; It was I didn't have to I didn't have to
[2:16:57] It wasn't a hard thing. I could simply
[2:16:58] see who it was. He simply couldn't see
[2:17:00] who it was. And a prophet had vision you
[2:17:03] don't have.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; And and the brother Brandon begins to
[2:17:06] explain this. And he says, "Do you see
[2:17:08] what it is? See, there's another world
[2:17:11] right here. And you don't have to go
[2:17:13] somewhere to find it, but your senses
[2:17:16] won't let you see it, but there's
[2:17:18] another world." Now, he said, "You take
[2:17:20] somebody that has seen the sun." Y'all
[2:17:22] remember the quote? Somebody walk out
[2:17:24] and they see the sun and you take a
[2:17:26] blind man and take him out in the
[2:17:27] parking lot with you and he'll feel this
[2:17:30] warm heat. He'll feel this uh thing. He
[2:17:34] He can audibly or physically he feels
[2:17:36] the heat. He feels the warmth. He He
[2:17:39] knows something's there. And the man
[2:17:41] says, "What is that I'm feeling?" And a
[2:17:43] man with sight could simply say, "It's
[2:17:45] the sun."
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Madam says, "See,
[2:17:48] there's another world." And see, you're
[2:17:51] feeling, you're bumping into things.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; What is it? You can't tell you what it
[2:17:56] is. What do you think it was? You'd
[2:17:58] think, "I was a crazy person if you
[2:18:00] didn't have the sense of sight." You've
[2:18:02] heard people say these and they've
[2:18:03] doubted it. You're bumping into
[2:18:05] something. And brother Bam says it like
[2:18:06] this. He says, "You don't understand it
[2:18:08] now because you're only bumping into it.
[2:18:11] You haven't got that sense. But when you
[2:18:13] feel a strange feeling here tonight, he
[2:18:15] says, I want to say maybe cry or to
[2:18:18] shout or something. You ever feel that?
[2:18:20] I want to cry or shout or something. He
[2:18:23] said it's the angels of the Lord.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; You mean it's not a bad spirit?
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; You mean You mean it ain't I'm out of
[2:18:33] order? You mean I ain't interrupting the
[2:18:36] service? You mean if I want to cry, I
[2:18:38] want to shout, I want to rejoice. You
[2:18:41] mean it's the angel of the Lord causing
[2:18:44] me to feel that way?
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[2:18:51] [Applause]
[2:18:55] That was a brother Ed Hunter and and and
[2:18:57] I'm I know some of you know his
[2:18:58] testimony, but he was in a in a meeting
[2:19:01] of brother Brandham's and brother
[2:19:02] Brandham was in a prayer line and
[2:19:04] brother Hunter was sitting on the front
[2:19:06] row. It's improving his word. Amen. And
[2:19:08] brother Ram is praying. And as he's
[2:19:10] praying in the prayer line, he stands up
[2:19:12] and he he looks over and he says, "Oh,
[2:19:15] you big man there. You from Texas." He
[2:19:18] said, "I see you've been praying a
[2:19:19] while." And Brother Hunter, I talked to
[2:19:21] him about it. He said, "Brother Brown
[2:19:22] revealed something he didn't really want
[2:19:24] the whole crowd knowing." He said,
[2:19:26] "You're suffering with hemorrhoids."
[2:19:29] Now, that's not something you go around
[2:19:30] tell folk.
[2:19:33] So, if you got an idea, people told
[2:19:35] people what was wrong and Brother Bam
[2:19:37] knew it like that. Sorry, brother.
[2:19:39] Brother Brother Hunter hid it from
[2:19:41] everybody, he said. And he said,
[2:19:42] "Brother Brandham called it out in the
[2:19:44] open." Said, "You're suffering with
[2:19:45] hemorrhoid." He said, "But you finally
[2:19:46] did it, didn't you?" He said, "That
[2:19:48] angel's been there next to that big guy
[2:19:50] for the last half hour." I said,
[2:19:53] "Brother Hunter, what did that feel
[2:19:54] like?" He said, "Let me tell you the
[2:19:56] truth, Brother Wayne." He said, "I was
[2:19:57] wanting in that prayer line so bad. I
[2:19:59] wanted Brother to pray for me. I'd been
[2:20:01] to about 30 of his meetings. I'd seen
[2:20:02] the power of God. I wanted to get in
[2:20:04] that prayer line." He said, "So, I was
[2:20:05] sitting there." And he said, "Well, I
[2:20:06] just decided, you know what? I'm just
[2:20:08] going to pray for the people in the
[2:20:09] prayer line." He said, "I started
[2:20:10] praying." He said, "In the presence of
[2:20:12] God, started moving over me." He said,
[2:20:14] "I got to worshiping the Lord." He said,
[2:20:16] "In a little while, I just started
[2:20:18] crying and worshiping." He said, "It
[2:20:20] felt so good." He said, "I forgot that I
[2:20:23] was in prayer Brandon Tabernacle." He
[2:20:25] said, "I forgot brother Brandham was
[2:20:26] praying." He said, "I forgot the whole
[2:20:28] thing." He said, "I was just worshiping
[2:20:30] God until brother Brandham broke me out
[2:20:33] of it and said, "The angel of the Lord
[2:20:35] is standing next to that man."
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; What does it feel like to stand next to
[2:20:39] an angel? Oh, it feels like you forgot
[2:20:42] that Brother Brandon was in the pull
[2:20:44] pit. It feels like you forgot that there
[2:20:46] was a prayer line. That you forgot your
[2:20:48] troubles. You forgot you were sick. You
[2:20:51] forgot that you were who you were. Come
[2:20:53] on, church. We need an angel to pass by
[2:20:56] so that we can worship God the way he
[2:20:59] ought to be worshiped. We ought to
[2:21:01] worship him till we forget who we are.
[2:21:03] Till we forget our problems. Till we
[2:21:06] forget our pride.
[2:21:08] I say we ought to worship him until a
[2:21:10] Holy Ghost revival breaks out in our
[2:21:13] meetings.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Get drunk in the spirit of God. Amen.
[2:21:20] It's that overwhelming feeling to
[2:21:22] worship. That's right.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; A man with sight. A man with sight.
[2:21:26] Brother Bram calls a prayer line. God
[2:21:28] and Simplicity, Albuquerque, 1963.
[2:21:31] You've heard what is the Holy Ghost?
[2:21:34] What is the Holy Ghost given for? He
[2:21:37] didn't record how to receive the Holy
[2:21:39] Ghost. But actually, Albuquerque 63, God
[2:21:43] in Simplicity, last half hour of the
[2:21:45] tape, Brother Brandham instructs the
[2:21:48] people how to receive the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:51] And while he's doing it, Amen. There is
[2:21:53] a woman praying in a checkered shirt at
[2:21:55] the altar. And all of the sudden,
[2:21:58] there's a scream goes out and brother
[2:22:00] Brandham says to brother on the stage,
[2:22:02] he said, "Did you see that woman throw
[2:22:04] up her hands?" He said, "The angel of
[2:22:07] the Lord just passed over her head."
[2:22:10] Now you said, "Preacher, why you say
[2:22:12] that?" Because somebody sitting in the
[2:22:14] congregation, they would have said, "Oh,
[2:22:16] look at that fanatic up there at that
[2:22:19] altar. She's throw Look, she's really
[2:22:21] showboating today. Look at her throw her
[2:22:23] hands up and holler. But a man was
[2:22:25] sight.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "The angel of the Lord just
[2:22:29] passed over the woman's head." And he's
[2:22:31] telling the people, "He's here. He's
[2:22:34] here. He's Look at the tree. Look at the
[2:22:36] water. It's moving on the woman. If it's
[2:22:40] moving on her, it can move on you. If
[2:22:43] it's moving on him, it can move on you."
[2:22:47] Ah, hallelujah. He's a God of Abraham.
[2:22:51] He can move on the church of the living
[2:22:52] God.
[2:22:54] She threw up her hands.
[2:22:57] Now people people start organizing the
[2:22:59] moving of the spirit, the moving of the
[2:23:01] angel. And then they see because like
[2:23:04] like me now, you get spirit on me.
[2:23:08] I'm not able to dance the shoes right
[2:23:09] off my feet.
[2:23:11] Can't dance with Andrew anymore. I'm 50.
[2:23:15] but
[2:23:17] shout, scream, talk with two, three,
[2:23:19] four different kinds of tongues, run all
[2:23:21] over the building, have a time like you
[2:23:23] ain't never had, and the spirit fall on
[2:23:26] somebody else and they weep and cry and
[2:23:29] throw their hands up and oh hallelujah,
[2:23:32] hallelujah, hallelujah. Now, if you
[2:23:36] listening to what I'm doing, the angel
[2:23:38] moved through screaming, shouting. The
[2:23:41] angel moved through the altar, hands
[2:23:43] raised, cried out to the Lord. Now,
[2:23:46] Brother Bram says, "You'll feel a sweet,
[2:23:48] humble feeling coming in the room."
[2:23:50] That's angels walking up and down the
[2:23:53] aisle.
[2:23:55] Sometimes when angels begin to move
[2:23:58] among us,
[2:24:00] it's just a weeping.
[2:24:02] It's just a crying. It's just a It's
[2:24:04] just You're sitting there and it's just
[2:24:06] so real
[2:24:08] and you're just so glad he came.
[2:24:10] Brother, I'm glad everybody in this
[2:24:12] building's here. I'm glad every one of
[2:24:14] y'all showed up to this morning. But
[2:24:16] boy, when I feel him come by,
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad he came. Well, I'm so glad
[2:24:25] when I start reading the scripture and I
[2:24:27] feel that presence start moving.
[2:24:29] Brother, I'm so glad he showed up when
[2:24:32] we preach the gospel. I'm so glad he
[2:24:34] shows up when you begin to worship him.
[2:24:37] What is it? It's those sweet, humbling
[2:24:38] feelings. it begins to move among you.
[2:24:41] Listen, I I want to make a declaration
[2:24:43] to you this morning. God ain't short of
[2:24:45] angels.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; He's got enough angels that this morning
[2:24:50] while they're having church at True Word
[2:24:51] Tabernacle in Ohio. Amen. Angels are up
[2:24:54] there inspiring a preacher named Ray
[2:24:57] Ericson. They're down there with Joe
[2:24:59] Adams in Ohio or in Louisiana. Maybe
[2:25:02] Brother Donnie preaching right now.
[2:25:03] Amen. There's enough angels that they're
[2:25:05] here and they're there and they're in
[2:25:08] Africa and they're in India. Listen,
[2:25:11] wherever God's children are,
[2:25:15] the angels of the Lord encamp about them
[2:25:17] that fear them. And I say this morning
[2:25:20] as the children of Abraham, Amen, come
[2:25:22] and get your blessings from God. Don't
[2:25:25] you let no devil talk you out of it.
[2:25:27] Don't you let no devil say it don't
[2:25:29] belong to you. The angel of the Lord has
[2:25:31] come in this age to inspire you
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; to believe.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Can the musicians come?
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; He's come to inspire you to believe the
[2:25:43] supernatural.
[2:25:46] Your parents may not believe in you.
[2:25:49] Your family might not believe in you.
[2:25:52] Your friends may not believe in you.
[2:25:56] But God believes in you.
[2:26:00] And when he sends that angel to you,
[2:26:06] see, there's a whole big difference
[2:26:09] about reading about it
[2:26:12] and when you met it.
[2:26:16] Now, I'm not trying to be a fanatic
[2:26:18] here.
[2:26:19] Just telling you my testimony.
[2:26:24] I lost a little brother when I first got
[2:26:26] saved.
[2:26:27] He died from they said rush and roulette
[2:26:29] 18 day or eight days from 18 years old.
[2:26:33] Pitiful case.
[2:26:36] Not over a couple years later,
[2:26:39] a brother I had just led to the Lord. I
[2:26:41] had baptized him. He backslid. Went back
[2:26:44] into drugs and alcohol.
[2:26:47] I left the area and had went down to San
[2:26:50] Antonio, Texas to preach a meeting.
[2:26:54] And I was leaving San Antonio going to
[2:26:55] Tucson to meet with brother Perry Green
[2:26:57] to see some of the Tucson sites. I was
[2:27:00] on I 10 down there somewhere. Pulled
[2:27:02] over to a little hotel. Had my little
[2:27:04] family with me. I don't think Bethany
[2:27:05] was around yet. I think it was me and
[2:27:07] Gracie and Zach and Cararissa.
[2:27:10] And way in the middle of the morning, I
[2:27:12] don't know why it's in the middle of the
[2:27:13] morning when these things happen. But
[2:27:15] sometimes 3 4:00 in the morning,
[2:27:18] something awoke me. Sister Lydia, I
[2:27:21] looked over and there was a man standing
[2:27:22] right here beside me. And he said to me,
[2:27:26] "You're fing to go through a great
[2:27:27] struggle and a great battle. Don't you
[2:27:30] fear it. I'll be with you."
[2:27:33] I had led my brother to the Lord. I had
[2:27:37] worked with him.
[2:27:39] [Music]
[2:27:40] But I had made some decisions.
[2:27:43] [Music]
[2:27:46] And those decisions had to do with my
[2:27:48] ministry.
[2:27:50] And it really disappointed my brother
[2:27:52] because he wanted me to lead. He wanted
[2:27:53] me to be where he could be with me as a
[2:27:56] pastor or something. And I didn't feel
[2:27:58] to do it at the time.
[2:28:02] He got in trouble that same weekend,
[2:28:04] stepped out in front of a train.
[2:28:08] [Music]
[2:28:12] Brother, it was a crushing weight.
[2:28:14] [Music]
[2:28:17] But I knew somebody had already told me
[2:28:20] before it came that it was going to be
[2:28:23] okay.
[2:28:25] [Music]
[2:28:27] I think it was that same very trip. If
[2:28:30] it wasn't, it was just a little while
[2:28:31] later. I was at brother Ron Peterson's
[2:28:34] and he had that old church building and
[2:28:36] he had a a back office and he had a a a
[2:28:41] big auditorium, had wood things come
[2:28:42] across it like this. And I was coming
[2:28:44] out to preach and I had gotten up.
[2:28:46] Brother Ron's desk was sitting like this
[2:28:48] and the door was over there and I had
[2:28:50] gotten up from the desk and I had been
[2:28:53] praying and man that was just wave after
[2:28:56] wave of the anointing was just dealing
[2:28:57] with me. I mean and they were calling me
[2:28:59] to the pull pits. I got up and walked
[2:29:01] around the desk. And just as I was
[2:29:03] walking around the desk like this,
[2:29:06] there was a almost an ivorycoled
[2:29:10] wing
[2:29:12] that started about here.
[2:29:16] Now I know I'm on the internet, okay?
[2:29:20] It was an ivory colored wing about this
[2:29:21] tall and it went like this and went
[2:29:25] completely to the ground. I didn't know
[2:29:27] angels had wings like that. I had never
[2:29:31] dreamed that. I thought they were just
[2:29:32] little short wings on their back or
[2:29:33] something.
[2:29:36] But the way it appeared to me was like
[2:29:39] it would be like three quarters of the
[2:29:41] of of somebody standing behind that wall
[2:29:44] and just part of them sticking out.
[2:29:47] The whole being wasn't there. It was
[2:29:50] just one half of that like that with
[2:29:51] that big wing come down. And just as I
[2:29:53] was headed to the to the thing,
[2:29:56] literally bumped right into me cuz it
[2:29:58] wasn't supposed to be there.
[2:30:02] You said, "Brother Wayne,
[2:30:04] are you crazy?" No. I think it was 201
[2:30:09] 19 maybe.
[2:30:11] I was sitting on the back row of altar
[2:30:15] of brother Tim Puit's services and we
[2:30:18] were having the fall meetings. Brother
[2:30:19] Josh, Brother Ron, myself, I don't know
[2:30:22] who else was speaking, but I know the
[2:30:23] three of us were there.
[2:30:26] And Brother Josh Bannon had the service
[2:30:28] that night. I think he was preaching on
[2:30:29] conflict. And I'm telling you that so
[2:30:30] you can go look it up. He was preaching
[2:30:32] on conflict between God and the devil.
[2:30:35] Brother Ron walks out and sat down next
[2:30:37] to me on the platform and we were
[2:30:39] sitting like this. Brother Tim would
[2:30:41] have been here and Brother Ron would
[2:30:42] have been there and I'd be here. And
[2:30:44] Brother Ron sits down. He looks over at
[2:30:46] me. He goes, "You know how brother Ron
[2:30:48] does. He's here."
[2:30:53] I said, "Who? What you mean? He's here."
[2:30:56] Like that. That's all he said. And if
[2:30:59] you want to go watch it, you can see it
[2:31:00] on you can see it on you can see it on
[2:31:02] the on the video. And in a little while
[2:31:06] when he says that, Josh is preaching
[2:31:10] and Josh makes a point about something
[2:31:13] about the the Lord.
[2:31:15] And I look up and there's a man standing
[2:31:18] about where the guardrail is on the on
[2:31:21] the steps coming up on brother Tim's
[2:31:23] pullpit and there's a man standing there
[2:31:25] with his arms folded just like this just
[2:31:27] staring at brother Joshua.
[2:31:31] Friend, I am not given to fanaticism.
[2:31:34] I seen it with my own eyes.
[2:31:38] And when I seen that, I bumped Brother
[2:31:41] Ron. It's on video. I bumped Brother Ron
[2:31:43] and I said, "Yes, Brother Ron, and you
[2:31:45] can see me." I said, "He's standing
[2:31:47] right over there." And when And when I
[2:31:50] said that, it wasn't just a minute. Go
[2:31:52] watch the video. The whole audience
[2:31:55] explodes.
[2:31:56] It just goes into great praise. You
[2:31:59] said, "Preacher, why are you telling me
[2:32:01] this?" Because it's real.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; It's not a bunch of crazy and heresy.
[2:32:07] We're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:32:12] I I know there's fanaticism with any
[2:32:14] what we're talking about. There was a
[2:32:16] Joseph Smith guy said he had the word
[2:32:18] and went and met I shouldn't say that's
[2:32:20] disrespectful. I'm sorry. There was a
[2:32:22] man Joseph Smith went and said he met an
[2:32:24] angel, but he had to write a whole
[2:32:26] another Bible.
[2:32:29] William Brandon said he met an angel and
[2:32:31] he opened the Bible.
[2:32:34] [Applause]
[2:32:39] There's angels among us leading us to
[2:32:42] the supernatural God. Every believer in
[2:32:45] this building has an angel assigned to
[2:32:48] you.
[2:32:52] It's still real, folks.
[2:32:55] It's still real. Could we bow our hearts
[2:32:57] right now? Father,
[2:33:01] Lord, I know my testimony is going
[2:33:03] across the screens and I'm sure there'll
[2:33:05] be plenty critics listen,
[2:33:09] but Lord, maybe someday when they meet
[2:33:12] you,
[2:33:13] they'll know these things are true.
[2:33:16] I lie not
[2:33:19] with your word before me.
[2:33:22] While I was preaching in True Word
[2:33:24] Tabernacle not more than a few years
[2:33:25] ago,
[2:33:27] Lord, I've seen a man walk out of the
[2:33:29] door of the office and walk right
[2:33:31] through the congregation of people and
[2:33:33] disappear into the wall
[2:33:35] because you still have angels.
[2:33:38] They're right here this morning and we
[2:33:40] believe it, Father. And we ask you right
[2:33:43] now, Lord, that you would entreat your
[2:33:46] people in the supernatural. Maybe
[2:33:48] somebody here this morning, Lord,
[2:33:50] they're barren in their womb.
[2:33:53] And the enemy has said they'll never be
[2:33:55] able to have children. But I pray this
[2:33:56] morning, Father. That the same God that
[2:33:59] showed mercy in my family, may you show
[2:34:02] mercy upon this place.
[2:34:05] Lord, I pray this morning, maybe there's
[2:34:07] someone here with an addiction of
[2:34:08] tobacco, but I pray the same one that
[2:34:11] met me and delivered me. Lord, I pray
[2:34:14] you'd meet them right here at this altar
[2:34:16] this morning. Lord, the one that can
[2:34:18] heal the strokes, the one that can take
[2:34:21] the diabetes away. You came down on a
[2:34:24] blast serpent. You came down on a pull
[2:34:26] of Bethesda. You came down on a seventh
[2:34:28] angel. And Lord, you're still with the
[2:34:31] message of the hour. And I pray this
[2:34:33] morning, Lord, that you would move
[2:34:35] through this congregation, touch your
[2:34:36] children. I pray for them, Father, in
[2:34:39] the name of Jesus Christ according to
[2:34:42] the will of God. In Jesus name we pray.

[2:58:21] and went astray.
[2:58:25] Thank God I didn't lose everything.
[2:58:34] Well, I lost positions
[2:58:38] that were so dear
[2:58:42] and I lost some battles
[2:58:46] by walking in fear.
[2:58:50] But in the midst of my struggles,

[3:01:42] traveled from overseas to being here, I
[3:01:46] believe God gathers us together.

[3:02:06] prayer that you have prayed for us in
[3:02:09] our battle of this journey. And we thank
[3:02:12] you. God has given us many victories.
[3:02:16] He has blessed us along our trip and
[3:02:19] he's been with us. And
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; I'd like to thank all the ones that work
[3:02:23] behind the scenes to make this meeting
[3:02:25] happen.
[3:02:27] &gt;&gt; I'd especially like to thank my boys.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; I don't have the strength to do those
[3:02:34] things anymore, but I sure know how to
[3:02:37] help them from behind the scenes. And
[3:02:38] so, amen. Thank brother Andrew and
[3:02:41] brother Matthew and
[3:02:42] &gt;&gt; all my family and everybody here, all of
[3:02:45] our host church here. We'd like to thank
[3:02:47] you.

[3:02:51] brother Tim.

[3:03:10] sermons that all they just popped up
[3:03:12] last week and got.
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; What you heard this week was a lifetime
[3:03:17] of study.
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:20] &gt;&gt; And a lifetime of experience. And
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; they came and delivered their heart to
[3:03:25] help you and to strengthen you and
[3:03:28] &gt;&gt; and to be a blessing to you. And I am so
[3:03:32] thankful to have this caliber of
[3:03:35] friends.
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Tim stays in my home every
[3:03:40] year
[3:03:47] and he's an angel of God to me.
[3:03:51] I don't know how big angels are with
[3:03:53] great big wings, but I know there's one
[3:03:55] standing beside me that's about 5 foot
[3:03:57] five and
[3:03:59] &gt;&gt; and he's been a real buddy. He and
[3:04:02] brother Wayne has been phenomenal,
[3:04:04] phenomenal friends. We have sure enjoyed
[3:04:09] being with you. I just want to share
[3:04:11] something after brother Wayne preached
[3:04:13] what he did.
[3:04:18] Just over five years ago on December the
[3:04:20] 22nd,
[3:04:24] an angel visited my room, my office,
[3:04:29] and he made this statement to me. If
[3:04:32] you'll trust me,
[3:04:35] I will use you like never before.
[3:04:40] and he has did it.
[3:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:46] &gt;&gt; We have Sister Donna Baler with us
[3:04:49] and she's been attacked with the power
[3:04:51] of cancer, the demon of cancer
[3:04:55] and she's getting good reports.
[3:05:01] [Applause]
[3:05:15] believe it's been 18 years since you
[3:05:17] guys have been with us. It won't be that
[3:05:19] much longer you'll be back. And Sister
[3:05:22] Donna didn't know. She gave a testimony
[3:05:24] outside in our driveway. And I asked
[3:05:27] him, I said, "Would you like to see my
[3:05:29] office?" Brother Tom was a hunter.
[3:05:34] They walked into my office. Brother Tom
[3:05:35] sat down beside of me and Sister Donna
[3:05:38] stood for about 30 minutes and gave
[3:05:40] testimony to what the Lord has done.
[3:05:44] She had no idea that where she was
[3:05:47] standing was where the angel of the Lord
[3:05:49] was standing when he told me, "If you'll
[3:05:52] trust me, I'll use you like never
[3:05:55] before."
[3:05:57] &gt;&gt; If your if her screaming during these
[3:06:00] services offended you,
[3:06:03] You need to get saved.
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; Scream on.

[3:06:30] raise your hand right there?
[3:06:32] Amen. Cameras, get on her. Yeah, get on
[3:06:35] her. I want the whole world to see that
[3:06:37] Satan sent every demon out of hell to
[3:06:40] defeat her. And she's standing here by
[3:06:42] the power of Almighty God.
[3:06:53] And I like it when doctors declare
[3:06:55] you're a miracle.
[3:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And we so thank we thank
[3:07:01] you, Sister Donna. We thank every one of

[3:07:07] Won't you turn to your neighbor and say,
[3:07:09] "Brother Ron loves you, and I'm shaking
[3:07:10] your hand for brother Ron.
[3:07:31] Hallelujah.
[3:07:34] Now if you come expecting,
[3:07:37] did you get what you expected?
[3:07:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07:54] Amen. Greater than any miracle is the
[3:07:56] transforming power of God.
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; And I ask you that you would just pray,
[3:08:01] "God, transform my life greater than
[3:08:04] ever before." Well, you, Brother Ron,
[3:08:06] I've got the Holy Spirit. Well, I want
[3:08:07] more.
[3:08:09] &gt;&gt; I so want more of him.
[3:08:18] I didn't finish that story, Sister Don.
[3:08:20] I got too excited. So, after you guys
[3:08:23] left,
[3:08:26] I'll do third person. After Brother Ron
[3:08:28] went and took a nap,
[3:08:30] I then walked back into the office to
[3:08:32] pray.
[3:08:34] And standing where you were standing,
[3:08:37] the angel of the Lord came.
[3:08:41] And when brother Wayne preached that
[3:08:43] this morning,
[3:08:45] he's certainly interested in our
[3:08:46] affairs.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; He's not only interested in mine, he's
[3:08:51] interested in yours. And he goes to
[3:08:54] school with you. And he watches over
[3:08:56] you. And always leave a chair for him at
[3:08:59] the table. Amen. Amen. Never go to bed
[3:09:04] without praying. And never get up
[3:09:06] without talking to the Lord. And Amen.
[3:09:09] And he's so good to us, isn't he?
[3:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Amen. I'd like
[3:09:16] to I'm not a singer like these boys.
[3:09:20] But I'd like to sing a song to you on
[3:09:22] the wings of a snow white dove.
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; And uh is that okay? Then Andrew Andrew
[3:09:29] is going to come and got some
[3:09:30] announcements for you. Amen. On the
[3:09:34] wings of the snow.

[3:11:40] [Music]
[3:11:51] over.
[3:11:53] [Music]
[3:11:56] Amen. We just want to make some final
[3:11:58] notes before we close out this meeting
[3:12:00] today. You have been such a wonderful
[3:12:02] audience to be able to worship and
[3:12:05] praise the Lord with. And we just got a
[3:12:07] few few uh mentions u before we move
[3:12:10] forward. We have a we have a fellowship
[3:12:12] dinner that we would like uh all of you
[3:12:14] to come and be a part of with us today.
[3:12:17] And uh our team of sisters have have uh
[3:12:21] been preparing. We um we have such a
[3:12:25] group of people here that just love to
[3:12:27] do things for the Lord. You all know you
[3:12:28] have those same kind of people in your
[3:12:30] church. And don't think that we got the
[3:12:32] blue bonnetic plague going on here when
[3:12:34] all them people left out. Leah's going
[3:12:36] to go get your dinner ready. And uh but
[3:12:39] we we're going to have it here at the
[3:12:40] Spotswood High School and uh you can
[3:12:43] write that address down there.
[3:12:46] Um it's 368 Blazer Drive Pin Layered
[3:12:49] there and it's it's there at the local
[3:12:51] high school. A sister from our church is
[3:12:53] I might as well say it. she runs a place
[3:12:55] and uh and uh so we're able to get that
[3:12:59] place uh free of charge and they they
[3:13:01] want to do that for us and they've done
[3:13:03] that for every year so far and we just
[3:13:05] want to take care of the building the
[3:13:07] best we know how. Just a few mentions as
[3:13:09] we're going forward. Um there's a fire
[3:13:11] lane there. If you see red paint on the
[3:13:13] curb, don't park there uh where the red
[3:13:16] lines are or where the curb is, you will
[3:13:18] get a ticket because the fire marshall
[3:13:20] comes through there. They get their gas
[3:13:22] right down in that in that school
[3:13:23] center. So, uh, just do not park where
[3:13:26] the fire fire lane is. And when you
[3:13:28] pulling into Spotswood, it's a loop and
[3:13:30] you'll just just circle around and enter
[3:13:32] into the school building at the left
[3:13:34] major entrance and we'll we'll have
[3:13:37] somebody there and uh that'll make sure
[3:13:39] that you get guided in there and we're
[3:13:42] going before we dismiss today, we're
[3:13:43] going to pray over the food. That way
[3:13:45] when you get there, you can just go
[3:13:47] right in and uh begin to eat. And but
[3:13:50] just we make this statement every year.
[3:13:53] This is a this is a public school and
[3:13:55] there's cameras everywhere and they're
[3:13:57] really really good. They can pinpoint if
[3:14:00] you had a red hoodie on and you did this
[3:14:02] or that. All they got to do is type it
[3:14:04] in and they are able to find exactly
[3:14:05] what you did. So just watch your kids. I
[3:14:08] got a statement around here but I won't
[3:14:10] say it because you already know what it
[3:14:11] is. They're your kids. You take care of
[3:14:14] them if you don't mind. And parents they
[3:14:16] if you don't mind just be with your kids
[3:14:18] and little ones. We don't have
[3:14:19] babysitters here at Full Gospel
[3:14:20] Lighthouse. Me and Brother Ron, we're
[3:14:22] not the kind of pastors that put
[3:14:23] pacifiers in in in the church's mouth
[3:14:26] here and and we are not educating any of
[3:14:28] our deacons to be that same way. So So
[3:14:31] you just watch your kids. Uh there's two
[3:14:33] gyms in the building there. One is for
[3:14:36] the little kids and it has a jumpy
[3:14:38] house, but I have already decided me and
[3:14:40] Brother Micah and Brother Tom, we're
[3:14:41] going to go through that thing a little
[3:14:42] bit later. And then the needing brother
[3:14:45] Tim if he wants to. But
[3:14:55] &gt;&gt; I think the only way that brother Tim's
[3:14:57] getting in that jumpy house is brother
[3:14:58] Ron gets in that jumpy house together.
[3:15:01] May that be something. Two angels in
[3:15:02] that jumpy house together. They be
[3:15:04] bumping into each other.
[3:15:07] And the other the other man I'm sorry.
[3:15:10] The other gym is for the young adults
[3:15:12] and the uh younger kids and there'll be
[3:15:15] volleyball and basketball there if you
[3:15:17] don't mind just helping us out. Clean up
[3:15:19] after after yourself and respect the
[3:15:21] facilities. And uh I always make this
[3:15:25] mention. It's because I I'm an associate
[3:15:28] here, but I'm also brother Ron's son.
[3:15:30] And I love brother Ron. I appreciate
[3:15:32] brother Ron. There's not there's not
[3:15:34] anybody in flesh and blood that could
[3:15:36] appreciate brother Ron more than me and
[3:15:38] brother Matthew. So, we make this
[3:15:40] statement out of love. Just be wise with
[3:15:43] your time with Brother Ron. He, some of
[3:15:45] you don't know this, but Brother Ron has
[3:15:47] eye seizures. And when he's moving
[3:15:48] through a bunch of people, sometimes
[3:15:50] those eye seizures will get him and make
[3:15:52] him super weak and sick. And so, if you
[3:15:54] wouldn't mind just helping me and
[3:15:56] Brother Matthew out. Just be real wise
[3:15:58] with your time. If you've been sick,
[3:16:01] don't shake his hand. If you think it's
[3:16:03] allergies, don't shake his hand. If you
[3:16:06] think it's COVID, don't shake his hand.
[3:16:09] You could just say, "God bless you." And
[3:16:10] brother Brandham taught us that's one of
[3:16:11] the greatest things that we could say
[3:16:13] and just just please be wise because I
[3:16:16] can tell you I'm a great guy and I love
[3:16:18] people. But that guy right there has a
[3:16:21] sharp sword
[3:16:23] and you want to stay on his good side.
[3:16:25] There's a whole lot of times in my life
[3:16:26] I never got no fights with him because I
[3:16:28] knew what he could do. So please stay on
[3:16:31] brother Matthew's good side. He is our
[3:16:33] complaint department here at Full Gospel
[3:16:34] Lighthouse. And if you got any
[3:16:36] complaints, that's the guy to see right
[3:16:39] there.
[3:16:42] Anybody got any complaints here? All
[3:16:44] right.
[3:16:46] All right. We love you guys with all of
[3:16:49] our hearts. We mean that with everything
[3:16:52] that's within us. And we thank you for
[3:16:54] taking out of your time to come be a
[3:16:55] part of these meetings. And I hope
[3:16:57] you've enjoyed yourself.
[3:17:05] Praise the Lord.
[3:17:09] I have a good friend here with me,
[3:17:11] Brother Brad Pal from Kentucky. I'm
[3:17:13] going to ask him if he wouldn't mind
[3:17:14] coming and blessing the food for us
[3:17:16] today.
[3:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:25] &gt;&gt; Hasn't it been good to be in the
[3:17:26] presence of the Lord?
[3:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:29] Thank you, Lord.
[3:17:32] You know, you don't have to leave that
[3:17:33] presence here, but you can take it with
[3:17:34] you. It don't have to stay in the
[3:17:36] tabernacle. We take it everywhere we go.
[3:17:39] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we're
[3:17:40] just thankful, Lord, for the me the
[3:17:42] ministry that's we've witnessed this
[3:17:44] weekend, Lord, and your visitation upon
[3:17:46] us, Lord, and for all that you've done.
[3:17:48] We came and we we called upon your name,
[3:17:51] Lord, and you came and you delivered,
[3:17:53] Father. You delivered freedom. You
[3:17:54] delivered victory. you delivered uh uh
[3:17:57] overcoming power through the deliverance
[3:17:59] and everything that everybody had need
[3:18:01] of. Father, we just ask Lord as we get
[3:18:04] ready to leave here that you would leave
[3:18:05] with us as well, Father. And we could be
[3:18:07] able to take that token that Brother Tim
[3:18:09] talked about and apply it into our lives
[3:18:11] and into our homes and over our children
[3:18:13] and families, Lord. And that we'll just
[3:18:15] be able to continue with this presence.
[3:18:17] And we leave here with victory and
[3:18:19] deliverance and joy and peace and
[3:18:21] comfort, Lord, knowing that your angels
[3:18:24] encamp about us, Father. And everywhere
[3:18:26] we go, your presence is with us, Father.
[3:18:28] And Lord, as we get ready to dismiss, we
[3:18:30] just ask, Lord, that you would just uh
[3:18:32] be with the fellowship this afternoon,
[3:18:34] that you would be the focus of our
[3:18:36] attention and and our thoughts and and
[3:18:39] our conversation, Lord. And bless the
[3:18:41] food that we partake of, Father, as you
[3:18:43] fed us well spiritually. We just thank
[3:18:45] you for the natural food you've given us
[3:18:47] as well. And bless the hands that
[3:18:48] prepared it. Give to those who have not
[3:18:51] today. Lord, we just want to tell you we
[3:18:53] love you and appreciate you and ask your
[3:18:55] blessings and your uh comfort and and
[3:18:58] your uh healing over the uh ministry
[3:19:01] Lord as they've been zapped of their
[3:19:02] strength and and Lord's been pulled out
[3:19:04] of them. We just ask Lord that you would
[3:19:07] get grant them strength Father Lord that
[3:19:09] they would be able to recover and serve
[3:19:11] you in a mighty way. We just love you
[3:19:13] and appreciate you and all that you do.

[3:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to let you be
[3:19:21] dismissed at this time. Make sure you
