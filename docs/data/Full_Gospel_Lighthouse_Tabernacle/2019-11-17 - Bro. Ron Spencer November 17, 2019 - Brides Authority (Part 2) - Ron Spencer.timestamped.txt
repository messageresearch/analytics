[1:06] that God is a God of great contrast with
[1:20] Joshua chapter one this evening I found
[1:27] this text interesting is it's been kind
[1:31] of on the plate for a few weeks and what
[1:33] we speak tonight and found it

[5:35] those words he is the same yesterday
[5:36] today and forever
[5:40] the man said God's given every sick
[5:44] person in here divine healing every one
[5:48] of you Jesus was wounded for our
[5:51] transgressions with His stripes we were
[5:54] healed it's yours it's yours
[6:03] but you'll have to fight for every inch
[6:05] of it to possess it everywhere the soles
[6:09] of your feet travel God told Joshua I
[6:12] have given you footprints means
[6:14] possessions let's move in it tonight
[6:17] let's go in footprints or possessions
[6:21] let's take every edge of ground that God
[6:24] give us if you haven't got the baptism
[6:27] of the Holy Ghost Peter said the
[6:29] promises unto you and your children to
[6:32] them that are afar off even as many as
[6:34] the Lord our God shall call footprints
[6:37] this possession let's go get it it's
[6:40] ours Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[6:42] today and forever less possess it the
[6:47] works that I do shall you do also less
[6:51] possess it it's God's promise don't look
[6:54] at circumstances don't look at how hard
[6:57] it is
[6:58] let's possess the land now what is it
[7:04] it's easy to feel the power of God to
[7:07] see it when you believe but then when it
[7:11] comes to a showdown are you able to
[7:15] possess the thing that you profess that
[7:18] you have that's the thing of it brother
[7:21] let's got them we've got to get it we've
[7:24] got to take it it's ours but you'll have
[7:27] to fight for every inch of it don't be
[7:33] afraid don't stay back oh well they say
[7:36] well we believe the days of miracles is
[7:38] past oh I don't know don't do that that
[7:42] don't look like a child of Abraham no
[7:44] matter how far along the promise seemed
[7:47] to hold out it went 25 years but instead
[7:51] of Abraham getting weaker he got
[7:53] stronger
[7:54] [Applause]
[7:56] for he knowed the longer that it was the
[8:00] greater miracle that it was not remember
[8:05] if God made a promise God made the
[8:08] promise and you believe it I don't care
[8:11] what takes place it's yours
[8:13] I mean believers do we have here tonight
[8:19] fight the devil on every ounce of ground
[8:24] that he stands on walk over and take it
[8:29] take the sword of the Lord
[8:32] take the sword of the word God's
[8:34] promises it's true now let me just give
[8:39] you a little background here just for a
[8:41] moment of where I stand and I've
[8:43] actually I almost feel like I got a chip
[8:45] on my shoulder here this evening when I
[8:49] preached last night and I watched how
[8:50] God moved this service and God designed
[8:53] that whole in and orchestrated all of
[8:55] that we step out my faith grab a hook of
[8:58] our promise of God but you know who
[9:02] whispered in my ear a lot today sure it
[9:06] is and so I told him just wait I told
[9:09] Andrew earlier today I said just way
[9:12] he's whispered in my ear today so I'm
[9:14] going to cut his head off
[9:16] [Applause]
[9:25] and you know what the devil I'll tell
[9:28] you what if it don't happen no matter
[9:29] God said it you got to remember that
[9:33] man's not in charge of this God's in
[9:35] charge of this and the scripture said
[9:38] these son shall follow them that believe
[9:42] we are believers not just the preacher
[9:45] but we are believers God's promises is
[9:51] true I love this and I want the devil to
[9:54] hear this it's reason applause and said
[9:56] that nothing can stop it they're God's
[10:02] promises I got a text this afternoon
[10:05] before coming to church brother Jason
[10:07] Jackson there was a man that we prayed
[10:09] for him in in the June meeting but there
[10:12] Jason spoke about him last week he was a
[10:15] live about an hour hour and a half away
[10:17] and he's a just a local guy and he
[10:20] walked into a car dealership and and he
[10:22] was trying to get a vehicle for his
[10:24] family and and he said that it you know
[10:26] that he was after he was dining at stage
[10:29] four cancer and he was dying he he he
[10:32] needed something for them for the future
[10:34] and he said I've been to all these
[10:36] churches and none of them believing
[10:37] divine healing he laid hands on the sick
[10:40] he said come to mind so that Saturday
[10:43] night he came to service he was sitting
[10:45] about seven or eight rows back with his
[10:47] two little girls and his wife and you
[10:50] could tell that they've never been in a
[10:51] service like what was going on and I
[10:53] prayed for people around the altar I
[10:55] just walked right over I walked the
[10:57] aisle right in front of him and I walk
[10:59] her right over and Eilis I begin to talk
[11:01] to him and I'd begin to ask him are you
[11:03] a believer do you believe what the word
[11:06] said do you believe the promises of God
[11:09] he said absolutely I believe I said well
[11:12] done let's just come out in the aisle
[11:13] here I want to have prayer for you and I
[11:16] begin to pray for him and when I begin
[11:18] to pray the power of God fell then I
[11:22] prayed for his daughters and I prayed
[11:24] for his wife what a report ticket today
[11:27] that same car salesman ran into that man
[11:30] and he said you'll like this but the
[11:32] Shannon he he said how are you doing he
[11:34] said huh that's over with
[11:37] I've already went back to work for the
[11:38] railroad
[11:40] [Music]
[11:44] a year ago brother Tim told us this it
[11:54] in in January or told us this in the at
[11:57] their fall meeting there was a man by
[11:59] the Kenneth Middleton that they
[12:01] diagnosed that cancer said he was going
[12:03] to die at any time and he got right down
[12:05] to the point of death and he and right
[12:07] before their family camp meeting last
[12:10] year not this year but last year in
[12:12] October he said he went in to see him
[12:15] and and he said that brother Kenneth
[12:18] what do you believe what are you wanting
[12:20] to do he said I want to get strong
[12:22] enough to get back into those meetings
[12:24] and he said I want to be at every one of
[12:27] those meetings and on Wednesday night he
[12:29] was sitting there in that wheelchair
[12:31] he's been in a wheelchair for many years
[12:33] he was sitting there in that wheelchair
[12:35] I want to report to you a couple of
[12:38] weeks ago he went to the doctor and they
[12:40] were checking his blood and there's a
[12:43] man with cancer that's destroying his
[12:45] body and that doctor said I'm I'm
[12:48] envious of you I'm really jealous he
[12:52] said your blood is better than my blood
[13:05] now I'll give you that testimony because
[13:08] brother Tim prayed for him on Wednesday
[13:11] night and brother brother Kenneth has
[13:14] had 35 heart stents 35 heart stents and
[13:21] the doctor has give him up and said
[13:23] there's just no more that they can do
[13:25] for him and he was prayed for on
[13:29] Wednesday night and I prayed as well
[13:31] here and I'm sure others prayed around
[13:33] the world prayed for him and just in
[13:36] just yesterday we was working he good he
[13:40] went right back to work and he works in
[13:43] the post office and he was sitting at
[13:45] his desk and he had to take a
[13:47] nitroglycerine pill and and this morning
[13:50] I believe it was this morning he got up
[13:52] and he was sitting on the side of the
[13:53] bed and sister Gabrielle there down
[13:56] seeing their family mouths but sister
[13:58] Gabrielle's mother baiz just went home
[14:00] to be with the Lord she walked in the
[14:02] room as a young woman and stood there
[14:06] for quite a little while brother Tim and
[14:10] I were conversing just only just a
[14:12] little bit of going and I said I want
[14:15] you to know that's good news in a lot of
[14:17] directions if God raises him up are you
[14:24] with me oh I feel I preached into now
[14:27] let me to stay when you start seeing
[14:29] that that tells you where you're from
[14:40] it don't matter when you go it tells you
[14:43] that I'm going to that land if I'm
[14:46] seeing those in that dimension that's
[14:48] over they got their new bodies I'm going
[14:51] behalf if God made a promise God gave
[15:02] the promise and you believe it I don't
[15:07] care what takes place it's yours fight
[15:09] the devil on every ounce of ground and
[15:12] stand on it walk over and take it and
[15:16] take the sword of the word God's
[15:19] promises are true nothing can stop it
[15:25] they're God's promises and he give us
[15:28] his promises just like he did the Hebrew
[15:31] children the Pentecostal church Danish
[15:34] Martinez he said Jesus Christ is the
[15:38] same yesterday today and forever can we
[15:41] walk up there and take a hold of God's
[15:44] promise and since sane it's the truth I
[15:47] claim it I own it it's mine
[15:51] God gave it to me now I'm preaching on
[15:55] God's authority but what good is it for
[15:58] God to give you authority if you don't
[16:00] use it let me say that again because it
[16:09] obviously didn't land maybe something's
[16:11] wrong this Mike God's given you
[16:14] authority he's given you supreme power
[16:23] under control of the Holy Ghost in your
[16:26] life he's giving you his infinite word
[16:29] but what good is it for him to give it
[16:33] to you if you don't use it are you in
[16:44] the now I can tell you that you are the
[16:47] bride of Jesus Christ you must believe
[16:49] it but you must do more than believe it
[16:51] you gotta act on it maybe the rest of
[16:59] you'll get with me in just a little bit
[17:00] you've got to not just believe it
[17:03] Baptist belief but I want to really let
[17:06] you know that never believes he believes
[17:09] in one God and he trembles let me just
[17:14] say there's no greater believer than
[17:15] when he stood there and was defeated
[17:17] night after night tens of thousands of
[17:20] tongues he believed God sent a prophet
[17:24] in this day because he had to fight with
[17:25] him and listen he may wish for a lot of
[17:28] things in your ear but he believes who
[17:31] you are can I get it again now
[17:44] even he believes who's who you are or he
[17:48] would not be contesting you all the time
[17:52] because you are his worst nightmare
[17:59] Clara
[18:03] well Judas go ahead and point to the
[18:05] chest I am Satan's worst nightmare
[18:11] now don't shiver in your boots now what
[18:14] he's going to do to you de Marsh end up
[18:16] on your door don't crawl back into a
[18:20] cave or a turtle in a shell and shaking
[18:23] your boots don't be afraid
[18:24] GOx with you with him said what an
[18:33] assurance of a solid rock the
[18:35] resurrection of our blessed lover of the
[18:37] Lord Jesus nothing can destroy it
[18:41] it is the planet it is the seed of God
[18:45] it is the purpose of God to give us this
[18:48] blessed Holy Spirit it is the purpose of
[18:50] God to show us signs and wonders and
[18:52] miracles it's the purpose of God and
[18:55] nothing can destroy it you remember when
[18:59] brother Brandon was standing there he
[19:01] said later he said we standing over a
[19:03] little finished boy and he said I told
[19:05] them if he's not off of the ground in
[19:07] five minutes you called me a false
[19:09] prophet
[19:12] he said that devil could have lined up
[19:15] every devil in hell now this is a
[19:18] statement he said the devil could have
[19:20] lined up every devil in hell and he
[19:23] could not have stopped that
[19:31] are you with me now let me just give you
[19:36] a matter of fact most of us has never
[19:37] fought with old Lucifer himself
[19:41] we're not powerful enough to really
[19:44] bring out the big boy but he'll send you
[19:47] some of his his his soldiers and they'll
[19:49] come to fight but remember if you can
[19:51] get this one scripture in your heart
[19:54] greater is He that is in you than he
[20:00] that is in the whole world
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:09] oh yeah you remember when brother
[20:16] branham prayed for thee the maniac or we
[20:19] stood that maniac and he fell across his
[20:22] feet he said that man the demon that was
[20:25] in him was the chief of all the demons
[20:29] and when he fell the rest of them failed
[20:35] let me just say chief or general or
[20:38] whatever they are greater is He that is
[20:41] in me now he don't have to fear this
[20:46] flesh but the god that's on the inside
[20:50] of you and I this greater this flesh may
[20:58] die tomorrow and rotten be put in a tomb
[21:00] before the week's over that don't matter
[21:02] but the seed that's on the inside of me
[21:05] will live eternally brother man said
[21:15] God's Word is it's worth no more than
[21:18] his word you've heard me quote this and
[21:21] if his word is no good he is no good if
[21:24] your word it's no good if I can't put no
[21:27] confidence in what you say you're no
[21:29] good but you're just as good as your
[21:31] word and if God is just as good as his
[21:34] word is and I as a Christian believer I
[21:37] believe that the Bible is inspired and
[21:40] it is a written by the Holy Spirit and
[21:44] it is the infallible Word of God if I
[21:48] didn't believe that I couldn't go home
[21:49] right now
[21:53] are you with me
[21:55] it is the infallible Word of God and God
[21:59] is under obligation to his word and to
[22:02] the believer that will accept his word
[22:04] and any word is a seed if you are
[22:07] accepted in your heart by faith and
[22:10] believe it and confess it God will bring
[22:13] it to pass what was just said you
[22:17] believe the Word of God and you allow it
[22:19] to go through your lips and confess it
[22:22] and believe it if f Bosworth would tell
[22:26] the patient said you keep quoting this
[22:28] scripture until you did it if you abide
[22:30] in me and my words abide in you that's
[22:32] what it will and shall be done unto you
[22:35] you quote that scripture until you get
[22:38] it and then take up your bed and why are
[22:47] you with me
[22:48] my brother Brendan said this and let me
[22:51] just bring you a balance just now every
[22:54] man has an order of days we know that
[22:58] because we're born of Adam's curse but
[23:02] you can prematurely have death come not
[23:06] to your door but you don't have to go
[23:14] cuz that don't have control over you
[23:19] help me preach now I've had that come to
[23:23] my door they were going to harvest my
[23:26] organs are you with me but you as a body
[23:29] of believers talk about how powerful
[23:32] that you are you as a body of believers
[23:34] and men of God and brother Kim came
[23:37] commissioned with the Saint the prayers
[23:39] of the Saints walked into that room they
[23:46] were going to harvest my organs listen
[23:47] we ain't playing games now when they're
[23:52] talking about harvesting your organs
[23:53] they're not playing games it's over but
[23:58] I happen to need the organs that I'm
[24:00] using tonight and God still had a
[24:04] purpose for me are you with me now but
[24:10] you prayed and believed what about you
[24:13] brother on I put all my faith up to that
[24:17] point but there came a point I had no
[24:18] more control of it I want to live a life
[24:22] of faith that when I am no longer in
[24:25] control it's in control of me
[24:36] are you with me now sometimes you meet
[24:40] Christians you don't know which side
[24:42] they're on because your tongue tells
[24:48] who's really the Lord
[24:55] listen cancer is not greater than God I
[24:58] don't care how bad it is it's not
[25:00] greater than God heart conditions it's
[25:02] not greater than God sure to not be this
[25:04] it's not greater than God God is still
[25:06] God so I'm gonna give him the glory
[25:19] authority I don't know about you and how
[25:23] you operate in your personal life or how
[25:26] you go about your your study or the
[25:30] things that you do in your life I trust
[25:31] it's every day
[25:32] I trust it I trusted that you have a
[25:35] conversation with God every day but when
[25:38] I'm listening to the Prophet when he's
[25:40] preaching and he comes to a prayer
[25:42] I don't skip that prayer because brother
[25:45] Adam can say a whole lot in two
[25:47] paragraphs in prayer because this is
[25:50] God's prophet and God
[25:52] and he can preach a sermon in prayer and
[25:56] he kind of gives us some real nuggets
[26:00] here that I'd like to just share with
[26:02] you about prayer and you've heard me say
[26:04] it before but it's just like it's just
[26:07] like the Word of God it's good what God
[26:10] calls great what man calls great got
[26:13] calls foolish what man calls foolish God
[26:17] calls great it's by the foolishness of
[26:25] preaching men are saved so what we've
[26:30] got to do is get back into the program
[26:32] of God and find out after all what God
[26:35] wants us to do because it's an action
[26:40] thing to be a Christian
[26:44] it's an action thing this is a
[26:46] seven-day-a-week thing whether you live
[26:50] in a tent or you live in a palace are
[26:55] you with me whether you drive on
[26:57] whatever a dune buggy or you drive a
[27:00] Mercedes Benz it don't matter whether
[27:05] you have the biggest job or the lowest
[27:07] all they don't matter
[27:16] prayer is the key prayer is your
[27:20] communication with God
[27:22] now remember in the dark ages the church
[27:28] had been so blinded most Catholics they
[27:32] don't even read their Bible because they
[27:34] have a priest that reads the holy Rip
[27:37] for them so really most of them don't
[27:41] even know what it says let me let me
[27:44] just tell you spend time in your Bible
[27:46] so you know what God says to you don't
[27:51] just take my word for it or brother
[27:52] branham's word for you you spend time
[27:54] with it and in the dark ages it actually
[28:00] come to the point to where that they
[28:02] felt like they couldn't pray on their
[28:03] own they had to have the priests to pray
[28:07] and if we're not careful we'll be
[28:10] Catholics in our own way
[28:14] are you with me if we're not careful
[28:16] we'll think while only brother Ron can
[28:18] pray or only brother Andrew can pray but
[28:20] you're a believer
[28:21] you can pray sure I want to pray for you
[28:26] lay hands on you anoint you with all
[28:28] whatever takes place but I want you to
[28:29] understand you have authority with God
[28:32] and prayer is the key
[28:36] you are authorized you are authorized to
[28:43] pray and you've been given the power and
[28:46] he said that's the answer prayer changes
[28:50] things prayer is the most powerful
[28:53] weapon that was ever put in the control
[28:56] of human beings
[28:57] there's no atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb
[29:02] as powerful as predator do you know that
[29:11] one bomb can destroy 900 Mouse 1 atom
[29:23] bomb can destroy 900 miles Nashville
[29:30] would be about halfway in that circle if
[29:35] you're planning on staying when Russia
[29:37] starts dropping bombs I don't care how
[29:39] pretty your house is she's gonna be
[29:42] kablooey
[29:53] that's why the raps are so important now
[29:57] let's just think about the power of
[29:59] prayer Moses pray you've heard me go
[30:02] through this I don't want you to be able
[30:05] to repeat it yourself Moses prayed and
[30:08] Egypt the greatest soldiers in the
[30:12] entire world became fish-food Daniel
[30:21] prayed and lines laid down and those
[30:28] same lines would later eat the men that
[30:31] put him into prison Elisha prayed and
[30:37] outrun the fastest horses in Israel 40
[30:41] mouths you talking about an athlete oh
[30:48] loaded was an athlete
[30:54] hello that that prophet of God felt the
[30:57] anointing of God and something
[30:59] transformed that body and he started
[31:03] running I'm gonna tell you what when you
[31:06] get in the spirit under the authority of
[31:10] God he can't run the fastest horses we
[31:18] get impressed too many times with
[31:19] athletes a man got nothing but temporary
[31:21] power
[31:27] God called this bright and invincible
[31:29] army he said that she knows what he
[31:33] wants done with the work the word is
[31:37] given now having the mind of God to know
[31:40] the objective and the motive and the
[31:42] purpose to put it in action he has given
[31:46] you a checkbook and given you authority
[31:50] to sign it and send it through the bank
[31:53] of heaven and the bank of heaven gives
[31:56] you unlimited power I'm not talking
[32:00] about Rolls Royces and Mercedes Benz and
[32:03] all of those different kinds of things
[32:05] I'm talking about power that's got
[32:07] eternal value to it
[32:09] Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still
[32:12] and gods never hearkened to the voice of
[32:14] a man like that ever before but even
[32:17] science can go back and find where that
[32:19] day actually took place I'll tell you
[32:24] why that took place he meant God himself
[32:27] and he said who's on the Lord Sun and he
[32:30] figured out it wasn't I'm on your side
[32:32] god but God come on church I'm on God's
[32:39] side it ain't necessarily that God's on
[32:43] my side but I don't gods you've heard us
[32:52] quote this for decades I pray it comes
[32:54] to us he knows that if the people get
[32:57] the true revelation of the true church
[32:59] and what she is and what is for that she
[33:04] can do the greater works she will be an
[33:08] invincible army he's talking about you
[33:15] sister Katie he's talking about you
[33:17] sister to Lord he's talking about you as
[33:20] a believer

[38:13] delegator Andrew you do this Matthew you

[38:45] I ask you is your pastor make you give
[38:48] it all the energy that I did
[38:53] this church ought to never cross their
[38:56] arms and sit there and go entertain me
[39:00] wrong church to be entertained this is a
[39:05] participation Church
[39:16] hallelujah and all of us were in a war
[39:20] here you gotta fight not fight one
[39:25] another but face the devil he said if
[39:35] Satan may pin you in a corner with
[39:37] cancer God will make a way of escape
[39:41] Satan me putting you under a car God
[39:44] will make a way of escape
[39:46] Satan me put your family away from you
[39:49] but God will make a way of escape the
[39:52] scripture said that our trials are more
[39:55] precious than how we we trade we traded
[40:05] precious chemicals or precious metals
[40:10] and you know I've watched the stock
[40:14] market every day for the last what 20
[40:17] years and watch go go up and down and
[40:21] and silver go up and platinum and
[40:23] palladium and those kind of things watch
[40:24] that as it inches backwards and forwards
[40:27] but I've never saw trials on the board
[40:33] but the scripture says that our tribe is
[40:38] more precious than gold
[40:43] now you that are always concerned about
[40:46] your hobbies and your and your
[40:48] retirement funds and the things that
[40:50] you're invested in the trials that
[40:52] you're going through when you get the
[40:54] moly drugs and you get depressed and
[40:56] feel like quitting if you can only
[40:58] realize when you're going through that
[41:00] cast aside the depression cast aside
[41:04] thank God that he that confidence in you
[41:06] just send you do that all right but I
[41:17] don't get up tomorrow morning and go go
[41:19] God see me at around noon I never get up
[41:24] and pray for patience
[41:29] if you're a Christian little while you
[41:32] never pray for patients because patients
[41:34] to get patients you got to go through
[41:36] tribulations to get the character of
[41:39] patients come on church while David was
[41:49] waiting on Goliath he had to have a bear
[41:53] and he had to have the line while his
[41:58] brothers were looking the part
[42:00] acting the part bigger than he was
[42:03] greater soldiers and he was he was at
[42:06] training because there's a lot of people
[42:10] that look the part and act the part that
[42:12] ain't when the showdown came and they
[42:16] were scared and in their foxholes
[42:20] remember last night I told you I said
[42:24] we're not when I said people that prays
[42:26] that the people that pray how many of
[42:29] you that have prayed and naturally in a
[42:30] couple of days you saw that prayer come
[42:32] to pass and I told you look around to
[42:35] see who raised their hand that's the
[42:37] person to call to pray
[42:40] I don't want somebody praying for me
[42:49] thinking I'm done he was a good pastor
[42:55] he was a good guy thank you for letting
[42:57] me be - it's horrible what the devil is
[43:03] put into I want you to pray even if I'm
[43:06] dying
[43:07] God raised him up that he can preach
[43:09] another sermon
[43:20] pray fearless I want you to say that
[43:25] with me pray fearless
[43:29] pray fearless I want you to count it
[43:32] with your hands and I want you to say it
[43:34] pray fearless ten times
[43:53] give the Lord a great big hand right
[43:55] there
[44:08] now I want you to put it into action not
[44:10] just do it
[44:11] I want you put it into action now I want
[44:14] to bring you back to your remembrance
[44:15] how many times have you prayed and while
[44:17] you're praying the devil whispers in
[44:19] your ear how many times do you pray but
[44:26] you speak then a fearless matter almost
[44:32] reckless in your faith Peter said silver
[44:44] and gold have I none but such as I have
[44:49] give out thee in the name of Jesus
[44:52] Christ rise up and walk and he took him
[44:55] by the right hand and lifted him up and
[44:57] immediately his feet and his ankle bones
[44:59] received strength and he leaping up
[45:02] stood walk entered in with him into the
[45:05] temple
[45:06] walking and living and praising God
[45:33] there was a girl that came to the
[45:36] louisiana meetings and she was actually
[45:39] a preacher's daughter life had
[45:42] disappointed her she'd fell in sin done
[45:45] things it was kind of very horrible felt
[45:49] there was no way back and Satan to put a
[45:51] perplexing demon on her she had tried to
[45:54] take her life over and over again sister
[45:56] Connie you know this girl and she would
[45:58] cut her wrists and cut her cut her arms
[46:00] and she became a cutter I don't know if
[46:02] you've ever heard of that or not she
[46:04] would try to take her life and she would
[46:06] she would cut herself and watch herself
[46:07] bleed you know she just didn't feel
[46:10] worthy of life let me just say that's a
[46:13] bit and if you ever get pushed into a
[46:16] corner where you don't feel like life is
[46:18] worthy that's a death and you speak
[46:21] directly to him in the name of the Lord
[46:24] Jesus Christ and tell him to get out of
[46:26] the room this girl came and she got
[46:30] delivered but after she got delivered
[46:33] she still had all of these scars on her
[46:35] back at the same meetings a couple of
[46:40] years later she's raising her arms and
[46:42] she always tried to wear long sleeves to
[46:46] hide that those scars this particular
[46:48] night she raised her arms and there was
[46:50] those scars and she just began to
[46:52] worship the Lord in spite of those scars
[46:55] and God came down supernaturally and
[46:59] healed every one of those
[47:15] saying that to say this many of us has
[47:18] been scarred by sin scarred my mistakes
[47:21] and scarred by failures but if you can
[47:25] only understand the blood of Jesus
[47:27] Christ has the power to wipe away our
[47:31] sins don't go back and do them again but
[47:33] that's the power to raise you back up
[47:35] and lift you out of the deep miry clay
[47:46] healed scars the scripture psalms 107
