[50:07] amen if you have your Bibles this
[50:09] evening would' like to look over in the
[50:11] Book of Revelations chapter
[50:14] 5 Revelations chapter
[50:24] 5
[50:37] say praise the Lord
[50:39] everybody
[50:41] amen and I saw in the right hand of him
[50:45] that sat on a on the throne a book
[50:48] written within and on the backside
[50:50] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[50:53] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[50:55] voice Voice who is worthy to open the
[50:57] book and to loose the seals thereof and
[50:59] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[51:02] under the Earth was able to open the
[51:03] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[51:06] much because no man was found worthy to
[51:09] open and to read the book neither to
[51:12] look thereon and one of the elders saith
[51:15] unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the
[51:18] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[51:20] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[51:22] the Seven Seals thereof and I be
[51:25] beheld and low in the midst of the
[51:28] throne and of the four beast and in the
[51:30] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[51:32] had been slain having seven horns and
[51:34] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[51:37] of God it sent forth into all the Earth
[51:40] and he came and took the book out of the
[51:42] right hand of him that sat upon the
[51:44] throne and when he had taken the book
[51:46] The Four beast and four and 20 Elders
[51:49] fell down before the lamb having every
[51:51] one of them Harps and a golden vials
[51:54] full of odors which which are the
[51:55] prayers of saints and they sung a new
[51:59] song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the
[52:01] book and to open the seals thereof for
[52:04] thou was slain and has redeemed us to
[52:06] God by thy blood out of every Kindred
[52:09] and tongue and people and nation and has
[52:13] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[52:15] and we shall reign on the earth and I
[52:18] beheld and I heard the voice of many
[52:20] angels round about the throne and the
[52:22] Beast and the elders and the number of
[52:25] them was 10 thousands times 10 thousands
[52:28] and thousands of thousands saying with a
[52:30] loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was
[52:33] slain to receive power and riches and
[52:35] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[52:37] and blessing and every creature which is
[52:40] in heaven and on Earth and under the
[52:42] Earth such as are in the sea and all
[52:45] things that are in them heard I saying
[52:47] blessing and honor and glory and power
[52:50] be unto him that sth upon the throne and
[52:52] under the lamb forever and ever and the
[52:55] 4 be said amen and the 4 and 20 Elders
[52:58] fell down and worshiped him that liveth
[53:02] forever and ever may God bless his word
[53:04] he may be seated tonight in the presence
[53:07] of the Lord I'd like to speak to you on
[53:09] a thought that I spoke to you many
[53:12] months ago that I was going to be
[53:13] speaking at some time but I would like
[53:16] to speak to you um on a thought here
[53:18] this weekend on the reason a reason to
[53:22] Rejoice a reason to rejoice and I
[53:24] believe that if anybody has a reason to
[53:27] Rejoice I believe that it is the Lamb's
[53:29] wife and I believe that we set here in a
[53:32] very special spot here tonight
[53:33] recognizing that we are Sons and
[53:35] Daughters of the most high God and it
[53:38] it's a wonderful privilege to know that
[53:40] you can serve him without bounds and you
[53:42] can serve him without without any chains
[53:44] and things that are upon your life but
[53:46] we sit here tonight and we recognize
[53:48] that by the preaching of the word that
[53:50] God has established us as Sons and
[53:52] Daughters of God and built us in a way
[53:55] that only that only we as Sons and
[53:57] Daughters of God can worship like we do
[54:00] now the Bible says here in 1
[54:02] Thessalonians 5 and 16 Rejoice ever more
[54:05] it isn't it doesn't give us an option it
[54:07] doesn't give us it doesn't give us a
[54:10] time for our opinion or a slot of time
[54:12] but it says forever more it doesn't
[54:14] matter what time it is whether it's
[54:16] morning noon or night it says Rejoice
[54:19] ever more and we realize that right here
[54:21] in this week that we are sitting here in
[54:23] the United States that we recog I that
[54:26] this is our time of Thanksgiving here in
[54:28] the Americas we're reminded that our
[54:31] nation was was was founded upon
[54:33] Christian principles how that the
[54:35] pilgrims came here many many years ago
[54:38] and and made the Americas their home
[54:40] they came here and they were seeking
[54:42] after a a a freedom of religion and
[54:45] after a certain time and after a certain
[54:47] season of harvest they begin to have a
[54:49] time where they would call it
[54:50] Thanksgiving and it didn't just last for
[54:52] one day or for a certain season but it
[54:54] actually the first Thanksgiving here in
[54:56] the Americas lasted for 3 days and now
[54:59] we recognize it as a national holiday
[55:02] but I believe that as Christians that
[55:04] Thanksgiving isn't just a day on our
[55:06] calendar but I believe that it is a way
[55:08] of life for Christians that we ought to
[55:11] give thanks every day it's something
[55:13] that that we reflect upon the blessings
[55:16] that God has bestowed upon us I believe
[55:18] that we've got something to be thankful
[55:20] for and as we begin to reflect upon
[55:23] these things and I believe that is why
[55:25] God allowed us a a certain time to be
[55:27] able to speak this thought here tonight
[55:28] is because of the time that we're in and
[55:31] I believe that we can speak things on
[55:33] certain moments that we're in and I
[55:35] believe that it that it's more effective
[55:37] in certain times and that's how God does
[55:39] things because it captures the mind of
[55:41] his people it's like it's like preaching
[55:43] it's like preaching the Christmas
[55:45] message it's like preaching a Christmas
[55:47] message necessarily on a on a certain
[55:49] day it doesn't necessarily have the
[55:51] effect as it was as it would if it was
[55:55] on on a different day or on Christmas
[55:57] Day it has a greater effect and this
[55:59] weekend we begin to reflect and think
[56:01] about the God that has blessed every
[56:04] single one of our lives and I believe
[56:06] that as we begin to reflect upon these
[56:08] things and I believe that that that you
[56:10] sat down with your family this week and
[56:12] you begin to sit down and begin to set
[56:14] and count all of your blessings and I
[56:16] believe that if we could sit here
[56:18] tonight and begin to count all of our
[56:20] blessings that time would fail us of how
[56:22] many times that we've been blessed just
[56:24] in this past week and you begin to
[56:26] reflect about the goodness and the mercy
[56:28] of almighty God it'll it'll put
[56:30] something on the inside of your heart
[56:31] that'll make you want to thank God from
[56:34] the depths of your soul begin to express
[56:36] the Gratitude and I believe that even if
[56:38] you don't have two nickels to rub
[56:40] together in your own name I believe that
[56:41] you still got something that you can
[56:43] still thank God for because God has
[56:45] given you the the very breath in your
[56:47] lungs he's given you the god that'll
[56:49] that'll always be you a God that that
[56:52] that'll never let down on on any of his
[56:54] promises I believe that it doesn't
[56:56] matter what name you are under it
[56:58] doesn't matter what situation that you
[57:00] come from whether you're a Believer or a
[57:02] non-believer I believe that you ought to
[57:04] still be able to lift your head to the
[57:06] higher power and recognize that there is
[57:08] a God that has always been watching over
[57:11] you all the days of your life he's
[57:13] predestinated moments like these moments
[57:15] that you're in to set up a moment so
[57:18] that you could give back thanks to the
[57:20] god that gave you everything that you
[57:22] ever had in this life and I think that
[57:25] if we as the children of the most high
[57:26] God begin to recognize how great our God
[57:29] is I believe that we can sit here and
[57:32] say that we've got a reason to
[57:35] Rejoice the Bible said in Philippians
[57:38] 4:4 rejoice in the lord always and again
[57:41] I say rejoice I believe that it's a
[57:44] privilege I believe it's a privilege as
[57:47] of Christians to be able to do this is
[57:49] to Rejoice at all times if if you begin
[57:53] to look what what the Philippian letter
[57:55] says he also tells us in Philippians 3
[57:58] to rejoice in the Lord but he comes back
[58:00] again in in verse in chapter 4 and tells
[58:03] us again rejoice in the Lord I believe
[58:06] that doesn't matter the circumstance or
[58:08] the situation that you're in that you
[58:11] ought to be able to rejoice and I know
[58:13] there's a million ways that we could
[58:14] take this thought here this weekend but
[58:16] I want to take a a certain or direct
[58:19] thought here this weekend notice what
[58:21] the Bible says in Psalms 106 praise ye
[58:25] the Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord
[58:27] for he is good for his mercy endureth
[58:30] forever who can utter the mighty acts of
[58:33] the Lord who can show forth all of his
[58:35] praise if you look and study out the
[58:37] Bible that particular phrase is
[58:39] mentioned over nine times throughout the
[58:42] Bible oh give thanks unto the Lord for
[58:45] he is good Psalms 107 oh give thanks
[58:48] unto the Lord for he is good for his
[58:50] mercy endureth forever let the redeemed
[58:53] of the Lord say so who whom he hath
[58:55] redeemed from the hand of the enemy
[58:57] Psalms 136 it says oh give thanks unto
[59:01] the Lord for he is good for his mercy
[59:03] endureth forever oh give thanks unto the
[59:06] god of gods for his mercy endureth
[59:10] forever oh give thanks to the Lord of
[59:12] hosts for his mercy endureth forever to
[59:15] him who alone doeth great works and
[59:18] wonders for his mercy endureth forever
[59:21] and I believe unto our God belongs all
[59:24] graise as we sat here as the redeemed of
[59:27] the lord we have come back like the one
[59:29] leper that had returned when the other
[59:32] nine went on their way there was one
[59:34] that turned around and recognized that
[59:36] healing had came to his body and he went
[59:39] back and he returned and he gave thanks
[59:41] when he recognized that the one that had
[59:43] healed him and the one that had saved
[59:45] him from this this condition or this
[59:48] disease that is a type of sin he
[59:50] returned and he gave thanks and I
[59:53] believe that there's no way that that
[59:54] you can never thank God enough I believe
[59:57] that there's no way that you can praise
[59:59] God enough I don't believe that there's
[1:00:01] no way that you can make too much out of
[1:00:03] my God I believe that the higher you
[1:00:06] build him up the more you got to do it I
[1:00:08] believe that the more that you praise
[1:00:11] him the more you're required to praise
[1:00:13] him and I believe that that you'll never
[1:00:15] put too much on my God you can brag on
[1:00:17] certain people and you'll build them up
[1:00:19] and they'll let you down but I believe
[1:00:21] that you can brag on my Jesus and my
[1:00:24] Jesus will never let you down you can
[1:00:26] talk about healing and he'll show up
[1:00:28] with healing you can talk about
[1:00:29] deliverance and he'll show up with
[1:00:31] Deliverance you can talk about
[1:00:33] manifestations of Sons and Daughters of
[1:00:35] God and he will show up and he will show
[1:00:39] out that's the kind of God that I know
[1:00:42] and that I
[1:00:43] serve it's like that Christian woman
[1:00:46] science woman one time that Christian
[1:00:47] Science woman had told William brandom
[1:00:49] said now look he said she said you're
[1:00:51] putting too much emphasis on that Jesus
[1:00:53] if I found one one fault in your
[1:00:55] ministry that you brag too much on Jesus
[1:00:57] that's the kind of fault that I'd like
[1:00:59] to have in my Ministry is that I brag
[1:01:01] too much on Jesus he said how in the
[1:01:03] world do I brag too much on Jesus she
[1:01:05] said well you make him Divine he said
[1:01:07] well he was divine he was divine she
[1:01:10] said well I can show you by your Bible
[1:01:13] that God that he was not Divine I can
[1:01:15] show you that he was a man see he said
[1:01:17] all right show me that she said just
[1:01:19] look one time when he went down there to
[1:01:21] the tomb of Lazarus and there he be to
[1:01:23] weep she said see he was a man he said
[1:01:26] I'll go with you yes he was a man when
[1:01:28] he was crying over Lazarus he said but
[1:01:30] he showed up as a God when he said
[1:01:32] Lazarus come forth I can tell you right
[1:01:35] now you can brag about a God that raises
[1:01:37] Congressman Upshaw and I'll tell you
[1:01:40] that he's the same kind of a god that'll
[1:01:42] show up one of these mornings and touch
[1:01:45] our brother Charles and he'll walk out
[1:01:47] of a wheelchair completely
[1:01:49] whole if William Bram said it in the
[1:01:51] fourth seal and he said it in the fifth
[1:01:53] seal that one of these days we'll watch
[1:01:56] missing limbs come back on I believe
[1:02:00] that this is the
[1:02:03] hour come on somebody we ain't talking
[1:02:06] about squirrels and we ain't talking
[1:02:08] about little fishes we're talking about
[1:02:09] Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:13] God
[1:02:15] hallelujah
[1:02:17] hallelujah ain't nobody like my God and
[1:02:20] I
[1:02:22] believe that's a reason why we have a
[1:02:24] reason to
[1:02:25] Rejoice cuz there's no God like my God
[1:02:29] for the Bible said in Isaiah 40 and2 who
[1:02:32] ha measured the waters in the hollow of
[1:02:34] his hands and Meed out heaven with a
[1:02:36] span and comprehended the dust of the
[1:02:38] Earth in a measure and weighed the
[1:02:39] mountains and scales and and the heels
[1:02:42] in the balance who have directed The
[1:02:45] Spirit of the Lord or or being his
[1:02:47] counsel counselor hath taught him tell
[1:02:50] me who can direct god with whom took he
[1:02:54] coun coun tell me did he take counsel
[1:02:57] with Joe
[1:02:58] Biden did he take counsel with the Pope
[1:03:01] or did he take counsel with
[1:03:03] Putin who instructed him and taught him
[1:03:05] in the path of judgment and taught him
[1:03:07] knowledge and showed him the way of
[1:03:10] understanding behold the nations are as
[1:03:13] a drop of a bucket now I believe that me
[1:03:15] and me and Isaiah could have been Chums
[1:03:17] because I understand his language right
[1:03:19] there because you drop one little little
[1:03:22] little drop of water into a bucket you
[1:03:23] can't see it in there and here Isaiah
[1:03:26] saying that the the nations are as a
[1:03:29] drop of a bucket so that their power is
[1:03:32] completely inadequate according to the
[1:03:34] power of the most high God and are
[1:03:37] counted as small dust of the balance
[1:03:39] behold he take it up the aisles as a
[1:03:41] very little thing and Lebanon is not
[1:03:43] sufficient to burn nor the Beast thereof
[1:03:46] sufficient for a burnt offering All
[1:03:48] Nations before him are as nothing and
[1:03:51] they are counted to him less than
[1:03:53] nothing in vanity to
[1:03:55] whom to whom then will you liken God or
[1:03:59] what likeness will you compare unto him
[1:04:01] Paul said in Colossians 1 and 16 for by
[1:04:05] him were all things created that are in
[1:04:08] heaven and that are in Earth and visible
[1:04:10] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:04:12] dominions or principalities or Powers
[1:04:15] all things were created by Him and for
[1:04:18] him and he is before all things and by
[1:04:21] him all things consist by him all things
[1:04:25] are held together I want to say this to
[1:04:28] you tonight there is no power that can
[1:04:30] rival or can match up to my God here
[1:04:33] tonight there's no demon that can thwart
[1:04:36] him there's no cancer that can conquer
[1:04:38] him he controls all and he knows
[1:04:42] all let me go further here tonight he's
[1:04:45] never went too far in his mercy and
[1:04:47] thought now you know what I've went too
[1:04:48] far of my Mercy that my children will
[1:04:51] think I'm too big of a merciful god and
[1:04:53] they won't respect me I believe that
[1:04:55] God's never went too far with his mercy
[1:04:58] and I believe if you're running away
[1:05:01] from this kind of a God I believe that
[1:05:03] he's got Mercy that's in front of you
[1:05:06] he's not the kind of God that's changing
[1:05:08] his mind about you or all of his
[1:05:10] promises he's a God that understands all
[1:05:15] things let me tell you he's God in
[1:05:18] heaven and he's God here on Earth but
[1:05:21] let me bring it down just a little bit
[1:05:23] further he's God in hell as well there
[1:05:26] is nothing that is getting past almighty
[1:05:28] God all of Hell's plans will never be
[1:05:31] able to stop almighty
[1:05:33] God let me tell you Muhammad all of
[1:05:36] their religions they don't have a reason
[1:05:38] to Rejoice like you got Buddha does not
[1:05:41] have a reason to Rejoice like you got
[1:05:43] here tonight their God still sitting
[1:05:45] there in a tomb with dry bones but my
[1:05:49] God my God spoke to Lazarus and he got
[1:05:53] up out of the grave my God spoke out of
[1:05:55] the mouth of Isaiah and there a virgin
[1:05:58] can did conceive my God spoke out of
[1:06:01] Joel and said that in the last days I
[1:06:04] will pour out my
[1:06:06] spirit and my God said AR raas me I will
[1:06:10] raise myself up on the third
[1:06:13] day you can look across the Eastern Sea
[1:06:16] you can look out there and it's a sign
[1:06:18] to you
[1:06:20] tonight there's an empty tomb out there
[1:06:27] Hallelujah can I give you some reasons
[1:06:29] to Rejoice here tonight the God we're
[1:06:32] serving as a living God he's so great
[1:06:34] that books can't contain him he's so
[1:06:36] alive that the grave can't hold him he's
[1:06:39] so much God that death can't stop him

[1:06:43] him he's so merciful that his Mercy is
[1:06:46] Everlasting his grace is sufficient his

[1:09:51] brother Clarence when he was in a F an
[1:09:54] accident and then God saved his leg I'd
[1:09:57] say he's got a reason to Rejoice how
[1:09:59] about you brother Randall when the old a
[1:10:01] hope would been give upon you but God
[1:10:04] never gave upon
[1:10:06] [Applause]

[1:10:15] a
[1:10:17] reason you got a reason and if you can
[1:10:19] only come up with one he's so much God
[1:10:22] that he saved little bitty old
[1:10:27] me remember brother bar would talk about
[1:10:30] that about that
[1:10:32] sister she got saved she said I want to
[1:10:36] thank the
[1:10:37] Lord I ain't what I want to be and I
[1:10:41] ain't what I need to be but thank God I
[1:10:44] ain't what I used to be brother brandom
[1:10:46] said that she knew that had she had been
[1:10:49] somewhere but now she was somewhere
[1:10:52] different you see God had a reason in
[1:10:56] Saving you God had a reason God had a
[1:10:58] reason in coming by your way God had a
[1:11:01] reason brother bandam said he said he
[1:11:03] gives me confidence that he wants to use
[1:11:06] me he's got a purpose in Saving me he
[1:11:08] said he's seen something in me he's seen
[1:11:11] something in you he said he had a reason
[1:11:13] to save you he said look at the millions
[1:11:16] that he that he could have took beside
[1:11:21] you but he took you
[1:11:25] but he took you and let me say this let
[1:11:27] me just go go right here and beat down
[1:11:29] that thought of of people's mind their
[1:11:32] mind ideas on on Election that it was
[1:11:34] not your choice that God chose you over
[1:11:38] he didn't look down the eons of time and
[1:11:40] look upon you and say well I see them
[1:11:43] out there 6,000 years later and they
[1:11:45] chose me so I chose them let me tell you
[1:11:48] my God is not that kind of a carnal God
[1:11:51] he's not that carnal to make a choice
[1:11:53] over your choice because I can tell you
[1:11:56] about my choice my choice led me to some
[1:11:59] dark alleys my choice led me looking at
[1:12:02] the end of a bottle sometime my
[1:12:04] choice my choice put me in a bad
[1:12:07] condition but his
[1:12:09] choice his choice his election his
[1:12:13] predestination I'll say it like this God
[1:12:15] sent himself on the inside of
[1:12:18] me that's why he saved
[1:12:22] me
[1:12:24] well was it it's like what William
[1:12:26] brandom said and it is the rising of the
[1:12:28] sun he said when God when he looked out
[1:12:32] there upon the atmosphere of that of
[1:12:35] that dark dismal atmosphere out there he
[1:12:37] said he looked out there and he said he
[1:12:40] spoke a word said let there be light
[1:12:43] William brandham said he had a reason in
[1:12:45] doing that he said because God knew that
[1:12:47] there was seeds all the way down there
[1:12:51] underneath underneath all that muck
[1:12:53] underneath all that water God had a
[1:12:55] reason in saying let there be light and
[1:12:57] God's Got A Reason in in letting the
[1:12:59] evening light pass over your soul
[1:13:01] brother
[1:13:02] Denny because God had seen that before
[1:13:05] the foundation of the world that there
[1:13:07] was a genan seed of God a part of
[1:13:10] himself deposited on the inside of you
[1:13:13] and God doesn't just do things to say
[1:13:15] that he does it he moves with a
[1:13:18] purpose it's like in Mark Mark 16 he
[1:13:22] said let these signs these signs shall
[1:13:24] follow them that believe in my name they
[1:13:27] shall cast out devils in my name they
[1:13:29] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:13:31] shall recover William brandham said in
[1:13:33] things that are to be he said it has to
[1:13:35] be that way he said he wouldn't have
[1:13:37] said it unless there's going to be
[1:13:39] somebody that could catch that
[1:13:41] word there's going to be somebody that's
[1:13:44] going to receive that and catch that
[1:13:46] word he didn't never spoke it if there
[1:13:48] wasn't somebody that was on the other
[1:13:51] end calling for that deep is that right
[1:13:54] so there had to be somebody that was
[1:13:56] looking for Mark
[1:14:00] 16 how many ever played a little
[1:14:02] baseball and you was out in the Outfield
[1:14:04] and you caught a you caught a Fly ball I
[1:14:06] highly doubt that you ever caught a Fly
[1:14:08] ball just sticking your glove up and not
[1:14:10] looking for it when it was a line drive
[1:14:13] but it was coming that way is the reason
[1:14:15] that you caught it it was coming by the
[1:14:17] way of the air is the reason why you was
[1:14:19] looking for it and you stuck your glove
[1:14:21] up and you caught it
[1:14:24] come on somebody I know I'm talking to
[1:14:26] you bun
[1:14:28] of I know I'm talking to you here
[1:14:30] tonight so God seen you all the way down
[1:14:33] here and he's seen you with your hands
[1:14:36] up he's seen you with your soul lifted
[1:14:38] up to him and he saw somebody that was
[1:14:41] looking for the manifestation of the
[1:14:43] sons of God so he looked in there and
[1:14:45] saw
[1:14:47] somebody saw somebody that seen Mark 16
[1:14:51] as the word of this hour
[1:14:57] I got my glove up let me tell you God is
[1:15:00] sending a word by your way and your
[1:15:03] Shore as a jeans sheit of God to catch
[1:15:08] it come on somebody what did Brother
[1:15:11] brandham say to had he said exactly what
[1:15:15] she said was nothing but the truth what
[1:15:17] was it she had her hand up she was ready
[1:15:20] to catch
[1:15:22] it
[1:15:25] H blessed be the name of the
[1:15:29] lord it's kind of like the atmosphere
[1:15:33] that's created right here this
[1:15:35] evening it's it's kind of like that same
[1:15:37] atmosphere here tonight I don't believe
[1:15:40] that we're sitting around a table that
[1:15:41] you have in your office but I believe
[1:15:43] we're sitting around the Lord's table I
[1:15:46] believe that we are creating an
[1:15:47] atmosphere where the Holy Ghost can drop
[1:15:50] into this room and someone can catch the
[1:15:54] Word of Promise and manifest that
[1:15:56] promise and watch it come to pass you
[1:15:59] watch you watch about every patient that
[1:16:02] William brandham ever dealt with matter
[1:16:04] of fact you can go back in Jesus's
[1:16:05] Ministry and go all the way back there
[1:16:08] doesn't it doesn't matter when you can
[1:16:09] hear it on tape when William Brandon
[1:16:11] whether he saw a vision or he simply
[1:16:13] laid his hand upon a patient and he
[1:16:15] prayed over them the prayer faith and he
[1:16:18] would say now go on your road rejoicing
[1:16:22] why was it maybe they didn't feel it
[1:16:25] maybe they didn't see it but if you can
[1:16:27] believe it if you can start thanking God
[1:16:30] for
[1:16:31] it because you are put here with a
[1:16:34] purpose to be able to praise God your
[1:16:36] entire purpose is to praise the almighty
[1:16:39] God and it doesn't matter the problems
[1:16:41] that you are in or under I believe that
[1:16:44] you still ought to be able to praise the
[1:16:46] almighty God I don't know how in the
[1:16:48] world you could be down while you're
[1:16:50] praising almighty
[1:16:52] God
[1:16:53] I believe that if you're still
[1:16:55] contemplating on your problems and your
[1:16:58] situations while you're praising God
[1:17:00] you're not doing it
[1:17:04] right come on somebody I hope you heard
[1:17:06] what I said I believe that if you're
[1:17:08] still contemplating on your problems and
[1:17:10] your and your situations and you're
[1:17:12] praising God at the same time then
[1:17:14] you're not doing it right but if you're
[1:17:16] doing it
[1:17:18] right if you're doing it right you can
[1:17:21] lose sight of everything that is
[1:17:23] happening down here because you lost
[1:17:25] your sight to Earthbound chickens and
[1:17:28] Earthbound squirrels because you're an
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:32] eagle William brandham said when he was
[1:17:34] talking about that ego Affair at time
[1:17:36] when he was up there hunting in them
[1:17:37] Hills that he got up there and he seen
[1:17:40] that eagle up there and he noticed the
[1:17:42] chattering of that squirrel down there I
[1:17:44] hope it's all right I'm following
[1:17:46] inspiration but he but he said he said
[1:17:49] he said I got to watch on that eagle and
[1:17:51] he thought why is that eagle so so brave
[1:17:53] up there why is he so brave up there
[1:17:56] don't he know I could shoot him don't he
[1:17:58] know I could take him out in a matter of
[1:18:00] seconds even though he wouldn't have he
[1:18:02] said but why is he so brave he said but
[1:18:04] then I got to Noti in something that
[1:18:06] eagle trusted he trusted in the power of
[1:18:11] his wings now if that eagle could trust
[1:18:15] all of his power and be so brave he
[1:18:18] could trust his wings how much more as
[1:18:20] Sons and Daughters of God should we be
[1:18:22] able to trust oursel being filled with
[1:18:24] the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:29] Ghost one time William brandom said he
[1:18:32] said the reason why that eag went up
[1:18:34] that high the reason why it was up that
[1:18:37] high is because he was built for and the
[1:18:40] reason why you are looking through the
[1:18:42] lens of the message is because you're
[1:18:44] built to
[1:18:47] see come on somebody You're Not Looking
[1:18:50] Through The Eyes of mortal men you're
[1:18:52] looking through the eyes of a prophet
[1:18:53] here
[1:18:56] tonight what the angel say to you the
[1:18:58] higher you go the more you see what is
[1:19:01] this Eagle age that we are under the
[1:19:02] higher we go in Revelation the more we
[1:19:05] see God never would have built that
[1:19:08] eagle that way if he didn't have some
[1:19:10] inspiration to get underneath of him and
[1:19:12] to go up there he would have had no
[1:19:14] reason to go up there but God built him
[1:19:17] that
[1:19:18] way there's a reason why the Church of
[1:19:21] Christ can't fly where your fly they
[1:19:23] ain't got no reason to be there but you
[1:19:27] got a reason sister
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:32] Charlene I hope you hear me talking to
[1:19:35] you tonight I got a reason to preach
[1:19:37] what I'm preaching here tonight I got a
[1:19:39] reason to talk like I'm talking because
[1:19:41] I know in whom I have believe and he
[1:19:44] called me by my
[1:19:50] name is that all right feels all right
[1:19:53] up
[1:19:54] here William brandom said he said look
[1:19:58] at old Simeon har he was 80 years old he
[1:20:00] had a fine reputation certainly he was
[1:20:02] an old sage and a renowned man had a
[1:20:04] fine reputation amongst the
[1:20:07] people and now he said the Holy Ghost
[1:20:09] had promised him that he wasn't going to
[1:20:11] see
[1:20:12] death until he seen the Lord's Christ
[1:20:15] William brandom said he had a good
[1:20:16] reason to testify about it let me tell
[1:20:19] you
[1:20:20] something if the Lord had revealed to me
[1:20:22] that I'm not going to die until I see
[1:20:23] the Lord's
[1:20:25] Christ forgive me I'm just probably a
[1:20:28] little bit too much redhead I can't die
[1:20:30] like you
[1:20:35] dying he had a good reason to testify
[1:20:38] like he was testifying because the Holy
[1:20:40] Ghost had spoke to him brother Timothy
[1:20:42] and told him you're not going to taste
[1:20:45] death until you see the Lord's Crist
[1:20:47] well I believe that you've got as much
[1:20:49] testimony as Simeon got because there's
[1:20:52] going to be somebody in this generation
[1:20:55] that's promised that they're not going
[1:20:57] to taste death there's a Rapture that as
[1:20:59] you go there's a body change that's in
[1:21:02] front of
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:04] you well if Simeon had a good reason to
[1:21:07] testify about it I believe that you got
[1:21:10] a reason to Rejoice about it you're the
[1:21:12] King's
[1:21:16] son
[1:21:17] Hallelujah now notice what the Bible
[1:21:19] says in First Kings
[1:21:21] 1:39 and zadok the priest took a hornet
[1:21:24] of oil Horn of oil out of the Tabernacle
[1:21:26] anointed Solomon and they blew the
[1:21:28] trumpet and all the people said God
[1:21:30] saved King Solomon and all the people
[1:21:33] came up after him and the people piped
[1:21:36] with pipes and rejoiced with a great joy
[1:21:38] so that the Earth rent with the sound of
[1:21:43] him y'all read what I
[1:21:46] read that men were praising and
[1:21:49] rejoicing over a natural King now if the
[1:21:53] Earth could rent and be rocked by the
[1:21:56] praise of a natural King how much more
[1:21:59] about when King Jesus shows up in here I
[1:22:02] believe that you ought to rock this
[1:22:04] place
[1:22:06] tonight I'm talking about a real Rock
[1:22:09] concert I'm talking about a real Rock
[1:22:11] and Roll concert where we rock the
[1:22:13] singles off of this place and holy
[1:22:16] rollers roll through this place praising
[1:22:19] almighty
[1:22:21] God
[1:22:23] if they can praise and thank God for a
[1:22:26] natural King that was raised up after
[1:22:29] King David how much more should we
[1:22:31] praise the King of
[1:22:33] Kings and the Lord of
[1:22:39] lords I'm building this and I hope it's
[1:22:42] okay I ain't got no timer set and I know
[1:22:45] that scares some people but there's an
[1:22:46] internal timer that I'm not going off
[1:22:48] until until the angel comes here tonight
[1:22:51] but I believe that there are angels that
[1:22:53] are here tonight I don't believe they're
[1:22:55] watching watching you worship when you
[1:22:57] begin to read Isaiah chapter 6 when you
[1:22:59] begin to see the vision that is
[1:23:01] transporting that transport Isaiah and
[1:23:04] he looks up there he looks up there and
[1:23:07] he sees the Angels the heropants those
[1:23:10] angels that are of a higher order flying
[1:23:12] with two
[1:23:13] Wings covering their face worshiping
[1:23:18] worshiping praising God singing holy
[1:23:20] holy holy is the Lord God Almighty and
[1:23:24] the Bible said that at the voice of one
[1:23:27] angel that It Rock the post of the
[1:23:30] temple one Angel did that one Angel did
[1:23:34] that by his worship saying holy holy
[1:23:37] holy is the Lord could you imagine God's
[1:23:41] got millions of angels but could you
[1:23:43] imagine the influence of Angel
[1:23:46] angelology tonight here if there's
[1:23:48] demonology surely there's angelology as
[1:23:51] well
[1:23:53] so imagine if one shook the temple and
[1:23:56] rocked that place could you imagine
[1:23:58] Millions here
[1:24:04] tonight but let me drop it down to you
[1:24:06] ain't none of them can worship like you
[1:24:09] [Applause]
[1:24:11] worship there ain't one angel that
[1:24:14] understands Amazing Grace like a son
[1:24:17] that was lost in sin that was lost in
[1:24:20] hell that was lost in a dop at condition
[1:24:23] that was lost in a pornography
[1:24:30] condition let me tell you something I've
[1:24:31] been serving Jesus I've been a Christian
[1:24:34] I've been in a Christian home my whole
[1:24:36] life but I've been a Christian a
[1:24:38] Christian for 15 years and I had people
[1:24:40] say well you're you're going to serve
[1:24:42] God like that why while you're young let
[1:24:44] me tell you I did this 15 years
[1:24:47] ago and I ain't found a new convert in
[1:24:50] Jesus Christ that can out worship me
[1:24:54] I like to see somebody try one
[1:24:57] time I like find I actually I actually
[1:25:01] had a dream about your pastor brother
[1:25:02] Wayne the other night me and him was I
[1:25:04] told my wife I woke up I had one of the
[1:25:06] best dreams I don't know where I was but
[1:25:08] me and brother Wayne was cutting a
[1:25:13] rug I can do it too if you want me to
[1:25:15] but I won't do it I won't do it just yet
[1:25:17] because I got something else to
[1:25:19] say I ain't found a new convert that out
[1:25:22] worship me I definitely ain't going to
[1:25:24] let no angel out worship me a new
[1:25:26] confort where it's fresh to them how
[1:25:29] rich in Mercy are God
[1:25:31] is I can tell you right now I ain't
[1:25:33] never going to let no angel while
[1:25:35] worship me and I ain't never going to
[1:25:37] let no Rock cry in my place if as long
[1:25:40] as there's breath in my lungs I'm going
[1:25:42] to Rejoice I'm going to worship I'm
[1:25:45] going to
[1:25:49] praise now notice those angels I believe
[1:25:52] that every son and daughter of God be
[1:25:54] ought to be able to recognize the
[1:25:56] protection that they're under here
[1:25:58] tonight because not only are those
[1:25:59] angels Built To Worship but they're
[1:26:01] built to
[1:26:03] protect because there's a reference in
[1:26:05] the Bible that we offer offer often
[1:26:07] oftenly reference here in Full Gospel
[1:26:10] Lighthouse it's in First Kings 19-35
[1:26:13] where the Bible tells us that when
[1:26:15] Hezekiah prayed that one Angel showed up
[1:26:17] and killed
[1:26:19] 185 a th000 syrians
[1:26:23] one Angel showed up let me tell you
[1:26:25] God's got millions of angels in heaven
[1:26:27] he's got corridors of Heaven he's got
[1:26:29] different leagues of angels in
[1:26:32] heaven and the Bible said that Jesus
[1:26:35] would tell us that our Angels our angels
[1:26:39] are constantly beholding our face before
[1:26:43] the
[1:26:44] father that's what William Brandon would
[1:26:46] tell us that every person has a guardian
[1:26:49] angel according to scripture not a think
[1:26:52] about this in Psalms 991 that the Bible
[1:26:54] tells us that angels are set to keep
[1:26:57] charge over you if you look at it in the
[1:27:00] right way there are angels plural and
[1:27:03] there's you singular there are
[1:27:07] angels that are built to protect
[1:27:14] you come on somebody when the car W
[1:27:17] happened right in front of you what was
[1:27:19] it Angels stood up for you
[1:27:24] I believe that ought that ought to give
[1:27:25] you a reason to
[1:27:28] Rejoice because it ought to allow you to
[1:27:30] see how valuable that you are to
[1:27:33] almighty God that he's got angels that
[1:27:36] are protecting you now let me get on my
[1:27:39] subject or y'all going to hang me the
[1:27:40] Bible said the Bible said in Amos
[1:27:43] chapter 3 and 4 please don't do it I
[1:27:44] don't like that
[1:27:46] idea the Bible said Amos 3 and 4 will a
[1:27:50] lion roar in the forest when he hath no
[1:27:52] pre notice what brother Brandon says he
[1:27:54] said the lion is roaring for a reason he
[1:27:57] said does a lion roar now without a
[1:28:00] reason does a young lion cry out of the
[1:28:02] Crave before he takes anything when when
[1:28:05] he hath no pray will a young lion cry
[1:28:07] out of his den if he taketh nothing so
[1:28:10] God has a reason and holding the
[1:28:13] Revelation for this
[1:28:15] hour because the Bible said in Amos 3:7
[1:28:18] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:28:20] he revealeth his secret under his
[1:28:22] servants of Prophets The Lion hath
[1:28:24] roared who will not fear the lord God
[1:28:27] hath spoken but who can but
[1:28:29] prophesy brother random said he's
[1:28:31] roaring now he's roaring by his
[1:28:33] Vindicated word when he Roars forth then
[1:28:37] something follows that Roar yes because
[1:28:40] he's coming forth then he said God has
[1:28:42] got a reason to Roar because he knows
[1:28:45] that judgment is at hand his word his
[1:28:47] word is a prophet he is this is the
[1:28:50] prophecy of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:28:52] revelation God revealing himself to us
[1:28:55] through his written word and he is the
[1:28:57] word now notice that the Bible says in
[1:29:00] Isaiah 55 7-1 that God's word will not
[1:29:05] return void unto him but his thoughts
[1:29:09] are higher than our thoughts so God has
[1:29:12] a
[1:29:14] reason God has a reason and dispatching
[1:29:18] the seventh angel in this hour he's got
[1:29:21] a reason in the seventh angel standing
[1:29:23] there and standing there proclaiming
[1:29:26] we've probed at it for so long we've
[1:29:28] looked at it for so
[1:29:32] long but now it's open what is it the
[1:29:35] line is roaring notice what he says in
[1:29:38] the breach he said now watch real close
[1:29:41] this is something you must get he said
[1:29:42] now he had been doing his mediat work
[1:29:45] making intercessions for the believer
[1:29:47] for 2,000 years he'd been back there a
[1:29:50] lamb now he's stepping forth from
[1:29:52] eternity to take the title deed book and
[1:29:55] to break the seals and to reveal the
[1:29:57] Mysteries let me say this to you this is
[1:30:00] not young people this is not a hoof lamb
[1:30:04] this is not a woolly lamb that is coming
[1:30:06] up and taking a book with his hoofs out
[1:30:09] of the right hand of almighty God but
[1:30:11] this was a man this was a sacrifice of
[1:30:15] Calvary this is the one that was beaten
[1:30:17] the one that was
[1:30:20] battered when John saw him it looked
[1:30:23] like he'd been in battle he had blood
[1:30:25] all over him because he'd been in a
[1:30:29] war he'd been in a war what was in a war
[1:30:32] over
[1:30:35] you he was in a war over
[1:30:39] you and he
[1:30:41] overcame and he overcame he was not
[1:30:44] going to let pilot win he was not going
[1:30:46] to let Rome win he was not going to let
[1:30:48] Herod win Hallelujah he was not going to
[1:30:51] let the son of predition
[1:30:54] win he was in battle because he thought
[1:30:57] that you was worth
[1:31:00] saving millions and millions of lambs
[1:31:03] had been slain under the old order but
[1:31:06] none of them had the power to wash away
[1:31:08] the
[1:31:10] sins of the most innocent sinner much
[1:31:13] less the most guilty it only had the
[1:31:16] ability to cover
[1:31:18] sin but this
[1:31:20] lamb
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:25] this lamb this lamb thought that je was
[1:31:28] worth dying
[1:31:29] for when he was up there in the Garden
[1:31:31] of Gethsemane and he was praying father
[1:31:34] not my will but thy will be done William
[1:31:38] brandham said that is where the greatest
[1:31:40] victory was won right there in the
[1:31:43] Garden of Gethsemane when he surrendered
[1:31:45] his own will it's the same way with
[1:31:47] every single one of you sitting here
[1:31:48] tonight it's where the greatest battle
[1:31:50] was fought right here and your mind when
[1:31:52] you surrender your
[1:31:57] will watch watch what the lamb does in
[1:32:00] Revelations
[1:32:02] 5 he said no one could do it he walks
[1:32:05] right up to the right hand of God and
[1:32:07] took the book out of his hand and
[1:32:08] claimed his rights can I put this in red
[1:32:11] letter for
[1:32:12] you I have died for them I am their
[1:32:15] kinsman redeemer I am the mediator my
[1:32:18] blood was shed I have become man I did
[1:32:21] this in order to get that church back
[1:32:23] again the one that I foresaw before the
[1:32:25] foundation of the world I have purposed
[1:32:27] it I spoke that it would be there and
[1:32:30] nobody was able to take it but I went
[1:32:32] down and done it myself I am their
[1:32:34] Kinsmen I became kin folks to them and
[1:32:37] they took the
[1:32:40] book what is it what's so precious about
[1:32:43] this book of life it's got your name on
[1:32:48] it why was John weeping in Revelations 5
[1:32:54] because John looked over there and he
[1:32:58] saw his name he saw his name on the
[1:33:01] book and when he seen that all of Heaven
[1:33:04] had been searched over and there was
[1:33:06] nobody found worthy in heaven nobody
[1:33:08] found worthy on the earth nobody below
[1:33:11] the Earth that was found worthy to take
[1:33:13] the book but there was somebody that
[1:33:16] spoke up and said weep not John for the
[1:33:19] lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[1:33:22] prevailed and when John turned around
[1:33:24] what did he see not a lion but a
[1:33:29] lamb hallelujah what do you need most
[1:33:32] right now a lamb of Mercy a lamb that
[1:33:35] washes
[1:33:37] you it was that precious blood that
[1:33:40] you're bought
[1:33:41] with let me tell you you sometimes you
[1:33:44] go shopping and you buy
[1:33:46] something you get that thing called
[1:33:48] buyers
[1:33:50] remorse
[1:33:52] especially when you take it back to the
[1:33:54] place that you bought it and they said
[1:33:56] we're not accepting that back and then
[1:33:58] you got to learn to love
[1:34:01] it laugh all you want to wait till

[1:34:34] pastor's advice right there that will
[1:34:35] get you in
[1:34:36] trouble I don't know but I think it
[1:34:39] would never tried that have I uh but

[1:34:46] bought you he never one time thought you
[1:34:49] know what I need to return them I I need
[1:34:51] to take them back I guess I just have to
[1:34:53] learn to love them like they are no when
[1:34:56] God bought you he thought that you was
[1:34:58] worth dying for before the world began
[1:35:01] and he saw the lamb
[1:35:05] slain come on somebody come on somebody

[1:43:06] reason a reason just one reason to

[1:43:19] rejoice
[1:43:24] how long I've been too long or not long
[1:43:29] enough might have heard both there I a
[1:43:34] sure but Satan will never get
[1:43:38] you I like that forgive
[1:43:49] me
[1:43:52] I they put me in a fullback position
[1:43:56] when I was a junior yeah I was behind
[1:43:59] that guy trying to run he was the only
[1:44:01] guy could run behind cuz he was only one
[1:44:02] thought if I don't step up for him he's
[1:44:04] going to get
[1:44:06] killed but I would have loved to have
[1:44:09] that power as a
[1:44:13] fullback and just take the ball take off
[1:44:16] running have that power of a stiff arm
[1:44:18] before they ever get to you you know
[1:44:19] what I'm saying
[1:44:23] Can't Touch
[1:44:28] This Lord help me you got me in this get
[1:44:31] me out of it
[1:44:35] Lord I got scripture to back up what I'm
[1:44:37] talking about here tonight not
[1:44:38] necessarily about the Heisman right
[1:44:39] there but I got scripture talking about
[1:44:40] that the devil can't get a hold of me
[1:44:43] because the Bible said in Revelation
[1:44:44] chapter 17 let me move on to something
[1:44:46] spiritual Revelation chapter 17 says
[1:44:48] that the shall make war with the lamb
[1:44:51] and the lamb shall overcome them for he
[1:44:53] is the Lord of lords and the king of
[1:44:54] kings and they that are with him are
[1:44:57] called and chosen and faithful now I
[1:45:00] don't know about you but that makes me
[1:45:02] want to shout right there the
[1:45:04] ain't with him Kings and potentates
[1:45:06] ain't with him Rome ain't with him the
[1:45:08] church World ain't with him politics
[1:45:10] ain't with him but they that are called
[1:45:13] and they that are
[1:45:15] chosen and they that are faithful are
[1:45:18] with him I'm with the
[1:45:22] lamb the pope ain't with him hell ain't
[1:45:26] with him but
[1:45:31] I I may not have been faithful all my
[1:45:34] life but I was
[1:45:36] chosen I may have not been faithful all
[1:45:39] my life but I was called so it makes me
[1:45:45] faithful that ought to give you enough
[1:45:47] reason right there to shake those
[1:45:49] singles off of this
[1:45:54] place I was seen with him in the Lamb's
[1:45:58] Book of
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:06] Life That's My
[1:46:08] Destiny don't touch
[1:46:16] it Lord help me this is too much fun
[1:46:23] if y'all if it's your first night
[1:46:26] here I'm always like this I'm
[1:46:33] sorry Dad will clean it up tomorrow
[1:46:36] that's all
[1:46:37] right the politician will show
[1:46:42] up it's okay if I go just a little bit
[1:46:45] longer I ain't going to tell you how
[1:46:46] long I'm going to go because that'll
[1:46:47] make a liar out of
[1:46:49] me
[1:46:51] I can't stand it when the preacher said
[1:46:52] I'm going to go 18 more minutes and then
[1:46:53] they go 85 more minutes so I'm not going
[1:46:55] to tell you how long I'm going to go I'm
[1:46:56] just going to go till I'm finished but
[1:46:58] if Christ the lamb I believe brother
[1:47:00] Vernon is with me if Christ the lamb is
[1:47:02] in heaven has taken a book to claim his
[1:47:05] Redemption rights then I believe the
[1:47:07] counterpart his wife his shadow on Earth
[1:47:11] must move on Earth and do the same thing
[1:47:13] we must take the book we must eat the
[1:47:16] book and we must go out and claim our
[1:47:19] Redemption rights come on Joshua come on
[1:47:23] Joshua Christ just setting his feet as
[1:47:26] pillars of fire on the earth come on
[1:47:28] Joshua come on Joshua that's my family
[1:47:31] that's my inheritance that's my promise
[1:47:34] that's my holy ghost that that's my
[1:47:37] pastor that's my
[1:47:39] health come on Joshua it's your land
[1:47:43] it's a good land you already been there
[1:47:48] Joshua come on let the rest rest of them
[1:47:50] 10 spies say what they want to but as
[1:47:53] for me in my house I know it's a good
[1:47:55] land I know it's a land that's FL with
[1:47:57] milk and
[1:48:01] honey and I'll say it like King David
[1:48:05] said it before he was a King when he was
[1:48:07] facing one of the greatest obstacles
[1:48:09] that he'd ever come up against when he
[1:48:11] was facing Goliath he said this day this
[1:48:14] day you're going to Bow before me and
[1:48:17] I'm going to feed you and all the host
[1:48:19] of the Philistines to the foul of the
[1:48:21] air that all of Israel might know that
[1:48:24] there is a God in
[1:48:30] Israel come on Joshua come on
[1:48:33] Joshua come on Joshua they've been
[1:48:35] staring they've been staring at you and
[1:48:38] they've been running their mouth at you
[1:48:39] but it's time that you start claiming
[1:48:41] your god-given
[1:48:45] privileges I do not believe that God is
[1:48:49] up in heaven giving out permiss Mission
[1:48:51] just to every demon in hell to go send
[1:48:53] out cancer where they want
[1:48:56] to I do not believe that I know I was
[1:49:01] talking to a guy one time asked me how
[1:49:03] my daddy is doing I said well he's doing
[1:49:07] good doctors diagnosed him with cancer
[1:49:10] he said yeah I hear that's going around
[1:49:11] real bad like it was a cold or something
[1:49:13] you got easily
[1:49:17] can Jesus said the poor you have with
[1:49:19] you always I say it like this the
[1:49:21] ignorant you have with you
[1:49:25] always hope you don't like hope you
[1:49:27] don't get mad at my inity interpretation
[1:49:29] that's the way it
[1:49:30] said but I do not believe that God is up
[1:49:34] in heaven given every demon in Hell
[1:49:37] permission to touch his
[1:49:40] children I believe that before them
[1:49:42] demons have the ability to come out
[1:49:44] there and touch your life and try to
[1:49:46] work on you and make you doubt and make
[1:49:48] you make you fear and make you do I
[1:49:50] believe that they have to go before my
[1:49:53] father and ask him permission but I do
[1:49:55] not believe that I'm serving the kind of
[1:49:57] God that is openly openly just giving
[1:50:00] every demon in P every demon in Hell
[1:50:03] power to touch sons and daughters of God
[1:50:05] but I do believe that God has an open
[1:50:08] book and he is openly showing it to his
[1:50:11] children get rid of them demons get rid
[1:50:14] of them Philistines get rid of them
[1:50:17] amorites come on now that's your land
[1:50:21] [Applause]
[1:50:22] I'm sick and tired of watch my daddy get
[1:50:24] sick I'm sick and tired of watching him
[1:50:26] deal with cancer deal with Kemo deal
[1:50:28] with seizures I'm sick and tired of it
[1:50:31] but I've got god-given privileges here
[1:50:33] tonight I got a reason to Rejoice I'm a
[1:50:36] Son of God Satan you're not messing with
[1:50:39] just somebody you're messing with a with
[1:50:41] an Andrew an Andrew Lee Spencer that
[1:50:44] knows who he
[1:50:49] is
[1:50:54] I told brother Tim
[1:50:56] puit when I found out four years
[1:51:00] ago I tell you what that's got to baffle
[1:51:02] some people's mind right there four
[1:51:05] months turns into four
[1:51:10] years do you have a reason to
[1:51:13] Rejoice I
[1:51:18] do
[1:51:33] but I told Tim BR four years ago I told
[1:51:36] him when my dad went through the fire I
[1:51:39] was one way I was a one Angel Spencer I
[1:51:41] didn't even know really God at that time
[1:51:43] I'd heard about of
[1:51:45] God but then I seen God I was like job
[1:51:48] said I have heard but now I see
[1:51:51] I said but the difference between this
[1:51:54] trial and that trial I'm a different guy
[1:51:58] I know in whom I hath believed and I
[1:52:00] know the power that I have and I know
[1:52:03] that Satan does not have to listen to me
[1:52:05] but he has to listen to the one that I
[1:52:07] represent and I am sick and tired of
[1:52:10] Hamas and cancer trying to thwart Israel
[1:52:14] and trying to stop the Church of the
[1:52:15] Living God we are born to possess our
[1:52:19] inheritance it's my god-given privileges
[1:52:22] it's my healing it's my Miracle it's my
[1:52:27] way I got a reason to Rejoice there
[1:52:30] ain't no devil going to stop me from
[1:52:33] praising my
[1:52:38] God hallelujah don't you recognize
[1:52:41] tonight that you are disputing with a
[1:52:44] conquered enemy he has no power he's got
[1:52:47] an arrows he's got a bow but no Arrow
[1:52:49] arrows to go in it he's been stripped of
[1:52:52] his authority and all of his
[1:52:54] [Applause]
[1:53:05] power I ain't just raising my voice to
[1:53:07] get you
[1:53:09] excited I ain't talking to you about
[1:53:11] some Disney fairy tale
[1:53:18] here I'm talking about a people that
[1:53:21] have the ability to look out there and
[1:53:24] see a well
[1:53:26] body and walk right into
[1:53:30] it I believe that you've got every right
[1:53:33] to worship your way into a new
[1:53:37] bodyall William brandom said he couldn't
[1:53:39] stop John Ryan from praising God out
[1:53:41] there once he recognized that healing
[1:53:43] was for me he said I couldn't stop him
[1:53:45] said he stopped the whole
[1:53:47] service he stopped the whole service
[1:53:49] nervous to start thanking God that he
[1:53:52] was healed before he was ever healed he
[1:53:54] testified while he was selling
[1:53:56] newspapers that he couldn't even read
[1:53:58] I'm
[1:53:59] Healed and while he was sitting in a
[1:54:01] barber's chair he worshiped his way into
[1:54:05] a new body and had eyes that could
[1:54:08] see look at Georgie Carter when her
[1:54:11] uncle and ravished her and done an awful
[1:54:14] deed to
[1:54:15] her she was on her way to music lessons
[1:54:20] yeah and Satan put a complex on her and
[1:54:24] she laid in that bed for n years laid
[1:54:27] there at 47 lbs but what was the first
[1:54:30] thing that she was doing when God healed
[1:54:32] her she got up and started praising God
[1:54:35] on that
[1:54:36] piano showing that you've got power in
[1:54:40] your praise that is greater than your
[1:54:43] [Applause]

[1:55:07] you've got things stop thinking them
[1:55:09] kind of
[1:55:11] thoughts we're one body we're one
[1:55:16] unit and the power that breaks jealousy
