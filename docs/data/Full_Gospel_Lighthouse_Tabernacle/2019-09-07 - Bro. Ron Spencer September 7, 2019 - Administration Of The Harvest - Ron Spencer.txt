speaking this weekend and then I will be away at brother Kelly Hildebrandt's for his annual meetings and and I would like for you to pray for us that God would just do but the Kelly sent me a note this afternoon he said would you have your church pray for us that God would just do incredible meeting there they watched what happened here and many of his church people watched and thank you to

and their brother Donnie Reagan's tonight they'll be here tomorrow night for us and and we want to make them welcome I know you will you've had plenty of practice through the years and so it's kind of a unique thing they've they've always wanted to make this trip to the Shenandoah Valley and look at our front yard and so they should be here tomorrow to do that god bless you if you'll turn with me to Matthew chapter 13 this afternoon in verse 2 and the great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore and many things and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow and when he had sowed some fell on the son fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up and some fell on stony places and where they had not much earth forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of the earth and when the Sun was up they were scorched because they had no root and they withered away and some fell among thorns and and the thorns sprung up and choked them I want to be this next part but either fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some a hundredfold and some sixty and some thirty fold who hath ears to hear let him hear and the disciples came and said unto Him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you two though the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given I'm glad to be a part of that to them that fell on good ground maybe you have a need tonight you just like to lift it before the Lord this evening Almighty God how we love you with all of our hearts tonight and we're thankful to be in your house this afternoon and we took a vote we voted for you tonight and I ask you tonight that you would just come and anoint our lips and our words Lord Jesus come and bless this audience there's many needs that are among us and Lord we just pray that you'd send your word and heal them this evening Lord Lord I just asked you that you would guide our thoughts like a laser-guided missile to the place that it needs to go Lord now not just not just the speaker but I ask you to anoint the ears of the hearer and Lord as we respond to the Word of God may we may we pull on you to get what we have need of this evening in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you may be seated whenever we bill with harvest has been the bride of Jesus Christ we we just cannot help ourselves unless we go to the Book of Ruth Ruth chapter 2 and verse 4 we find her in Boaz is filled yet some interesting instructions that I want to remind you of before we go too far and Boaz came and from came from Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the Lord be with you and they answered him the Lord blessed thee and then said Boaz unto his servant and said over the Reapers whose damsel is this and the servant that was said over the Reapers answer said is the Moabite us damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country Moab now remember they thought she was a cursed person and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers amongst the sheaves and so she came and and continued even from the morning until now and she tarried a little in the house and then said Boasson to Ruth Harrison now not my daughter notice these instructions go not to glean in another field neither go from hiss from hence but abide here fast by my maidens I love those instructions don't go to another field you stay in my field let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go after them having not charged the young men that that they shall not touch thee when thou art a thirst go to the vessels and drink of of that which the young men have drawn did she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace and Dinah eyes that thou should has take knowledge of me saying I'm a stranger and then Boaz answered and said unto her it hadn't been fully been showed me all that thou has done and to thy mother law sister death of thine husband and how that thou has left thy father and thy mother and the land of Nativity and and her come to a people which which thou knewest not heretofore notice these next words the Lord recompense by work he's a good reckon keeper and a full reward be given Dean of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings thou art come to trust can I read that last verse and you read it with me the Lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings thou art come to trust now we realize that we're at harvest time we can look around a little bit and anybody's got any common sense can realize that as we we are not in the planting season but we're beginning to see the combines as they are beginning to go through the field you don't do that in the jewel hour up in June that's the time to word you watch it at one time there was a there was a seeds in a farmers hands certified seeds that they would reproduce themselves now if you kept them they can't reproduce if you just keep them in a sack or and keep them in a bin they'll never reproduce themselves but under the right atmosphere and the right conditions and planted in the right ground that is that is just ready it given time and conditions will reproduce itself again but the random would ask them would say these words he says now if you would ask me to give you an oak tree I'd give you an acre I'd give you an acre it has the potential to be an oak tree great questions is ask you know it's easy to count the seeds in an apple but it's impossible to count the apples inside of the seed [Music] are you with me just to look at some of you just to look at where you came from God knew what he deposited on the inside of you before the foundation of the world now we look around a little bit we can sense the change we can sense where we've come from we can sense that we're not in the days of preaching God sent us Elijah now we did that for decades God sent us Elijah Elijah has come and we preach to Elijah was and we we preach the the the the initial doctrines of the message and we had to lay them down in order for absolute years what was that that was a calling out of her my people there was a gathering that took place it was gathering out of denominations gathering out of the world now let me just say you didn't come to hear a man's voice a man didn't draw you to that it was God himself the Lord of the harvest you heard the voice that's behind the voice has it begin to call to you like a deep calling to the deep maybe you walked into the building for the first time and you said now this is different now this is different maybe you walked in here and you felt for the first time in your life I'm at home I'm at home this is a place to work and be a refuge for me and and I and from the storms of life I can come here and and I can worship God and I can feel free to worship God you see if the harvest it's a time to where that the wind can blow through the wheat and it can glorify on the siege stand out and they can worship in Liberty they're not bound up but they can worship in Liberty they're not hidden in the ground no longer or in the stalk or in the tassel but they're the seed has become seed again it's reproduced itself by the brilliance so what was once captured by a prophet of God and as he begin to speak the word brother Brandon would explain it to us in the first seal how that he would go catch the mysteries and then bring it to the people or he with me now and we've been we've been enjoying that word as this winter for decades now let's watch them reel to reel then on books and then it became unknown unknown higher levels of technology to where we've got it at our fingertips anymore but you see the work is the rapid the rapid production of harvests has come to a season to where we realize time is really of the essence now I'm getting ready to go to Canada hearing and there they're preparing there will be people that will miss the services because of they have huge farms and just thousands of acre farms and so it's critical that that harvest come in when it's just right it can't be too moist and it can't be too dry and so it has to be just right now the rapture will be right on season now to some it looks like it's been a great delay and it's way over time let me just say God's always on time are you with me as with those lashes he was on time he was perfectly on time he will always be on time for you too because remember he's the father he knows the best he is the administrator or the Redeemer he is over top of the redemption he will do the work Naomi told Ruth you know the work we realize this we have what we have preached for for for so long we have started stood with great energies we're now witnessing among us thought about the energy but it was in this building last weekend you could feel it when you turned up on the hill you literally could feel it and you could feel it as the week started getting closer and closer you could just feel almost like a pressure almost like an overwhelming joy has it begin to come and the meetings were excited and some of you said in your seats for two hours before service you can't tell me you don't love God because it's more than just for a seat but the Branham says we come to weave he says now any Mason can lay block it takes a master stonemason to turn a corner I'd say we've turned the corner we've witnessed the book of Acts among us I'd like to say this you it's a sin for us now to disbelieve we've seen every gift we've seen miracles take place among us that are phenomenal even breathtaking under this administration of this egg's were not being we have not been preached to by a reformer we have not been reproached to buy some theologian but God took a man and hid himself behind him Revelation chapter city and says and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow butts upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun and his feet his pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth now let's just remember remember this the enemy has always stood near when the word is being made manifested when God was creating the heavens and the earth the enemy was near watching him when he was doing it how do you know that brother rung remember when he came and when he spoke everything into existence and then when he broke that chain and he made out of the atom ax and took a rib and created a wife mother Eve Satan was standing real near so he knew he had a link when Jesus is standing there Satan was very near he's always been critical of the written word because he can always work and discombobulate it but he has great trouble when the word is manifested and the word being manifested always defeats him that's why you are so dangerous to the devil you see you're more than a book or a tape or a picture on the wall or a myth but you're the living realities of God and you're being a living epistle of this age defeats devil the devil at any place and at any time under any condition now we're in a season we must declare this and no man is in charge of this this is not we're not looking to a man we're looking to Jesus Christ the author and the finisher of our faith now remember this what he has promised he will fulfill I want you to grab that that's important what he has promised he will fulfill where can I rest my hope and work and I rest my faith in him remember he has resurrection power he said he was the only man that could ever say I had power to lay my life down and the power to take it up again but remember he also said the corn of wheat must go into the ground and die there it must rot and it may have looked like maybe for hundreds of years what was God doing and the critics might have stood off and thought what about Marius God what was he doing he was putting his seed into the ground but if you could only look at her in the house she's risen in power she's risen in faith are you with me I'm absolutely overwhelmed when I think about what even men in Columbus Day and arrhenius day their deacons their trustees their men of faith people that serve God with them God not only made their messenger a promise he made them overcomers of that day of promise on that Resurrection Day are you with me the scripture says wherefore comfort one another with these words he promises a resurrection now we get in a hurry a lot of times but you remember God promised that he was going to send a deliverer to Egypt and Joseph said don't you bury my bones down in here so no matter how bad a day that they had they would go by the tomb of where Joseph was that in that lead coffin and they lay their hands over on that coffin because they knew God made a promise and Joseph said don't burry me are you with me don't burn me down here in Egypt but when you go across you carry my bones across there because in that land there's going to come a resurrection Joseph knew that he had to be buried where Jesus was gonna race again hello God also made in Israel promised in this day God's doing a couple of different things at the same time he has raised the Gentile bride to the end Tom calling bringing her to rapturing condition but he has not neglected his word with Israel and he has gathered them from all realms of the earth and brought them back home now the same God that's made us a promise he made them a promise brother Vernon I was thinking about when I come to this note this evening I believe if I have this right you were in brother branham's meetings as a boy and in the earth in the 50s in about 58 we went with your father am i right on that there are others that have been here in the past that that were in that meeting it was one of your cousins that would actually believe he's a cousin to yours that would help orchestrate that meeting he was also a friend of of brother Carl Williams now III want you to understand God made a promise to this generation he made a promise to this generation he made a promise to us and we've come to the season of harvest are you with me now remember we must be identified for the gathering of the harvest everything's got to be ready the token has got to be applied the tickets got to be in your hand if you get on an airplane I don't care what you said you bought but if you don't have the right ticket for the right seat you'll not ride that airplane I don't care what your story says I don't care what your story says and I don't care who you are you've gotta have a ticket in your hand it's got a barcode on it that identifies you with that ticket that it's bought for and paid for and you have the opportunity to sit in that seat are you with me now I have a barcode I have a token of life that lives on the inside of me it's not me but it's him of what he deposited on the inside of me and he sealed me with the seal of the Holy Ghost are you into me brother random will talk about people come to church and they'll shake a preacher's hand he said we've adopted shaking and preachers hand for for for for being a Christian or lighting a candle he would say many different things or I go to a certain church that's not the new birth I'm gonna say this to you it's not the new birth you got to die to yourself and be filled with the Holy Ghost and your life's got to be cleansed by the Word of God the washing of the word the purging out we heard it last Saturday night the purging out of our life of things that's not like Jesus Christ everything's got to be in order but the random will type it unto a like a a rail car and he set that rail car he said there's an inspector that comes to see how it's been packed and he will check the packing of that to see that it'll be okay because it's got to make the journey are you with me we've got some incredible railroad men here and they understand what uh what uh there's a there's a seal that goes on there there's some paperwork and computer work that goes with that and that seal has got a number on it and the inspector is identified that with that seal so if it would go down through the the country and the the the packages start falling apart they'll go back to the inspector I say that in church world today there's too many faulty inspectors word just lets anything right and anything going and lives are not packed up for the journey are you with me here is what we did everything packed up and get it ready to go and make sure that it's wrought judgment begins at the house of God first we want we won't stand in the judgment there but we'll sit here and our response to the word tells us so the screen went out come out of her my people now under under some under under under great duress you left from places and maybe left churches people made fun of you for leaving Wow my grandma believed this and it was good for Grandma but the season changed there was a time that the Methodist was right but they organized that there was a time that that the Pentecost was right but they organized that and death came into the pot are you with me now I I don't want to just be a message Church and there's no life in here I don't want to have just a message labeling pictures on the wall and and are you with me in Allen and books and tapes available I just don't want to be a labeled Church I want to be the living realities of the Word of God of this day thought about the last meeting I thought about it in some comparison as I was as I was said in here I thought about if I could just go back for just a bit the Lutheran Church if Martin Luther could go to where they were they worship maybe to the head Church I'm not talking about the spin-offs maybe to the head Church I'd say he'd be quite disappointed I I would adventure to believe he'd be quite disappointed we could just do some skipping I'd say John Wesley that actually got kicked out of the Lutheran Church because his father was a part of that and then it then he came and he began to preach that that you needed a clean life and there was a deep that was calling and they kicked him out of the church and and even in the preaching fields and preached on street corners and and he began to have an open vision and send the word to everybody I'd say if he came to the Methodist Church today I'd say it'd be quite disappointed I'd say he'd be quite disappointed with all the politics and a lot of seeing spirit that's come a moment I'd say if FF Bosworth and men like that could be gone to a Pentecostal churches and see where they're at today with their money schemes and their programs and where they are today compared to where they were almost a hundred years ago I'd say that messenger would be disappointed but I thought about the services last weekend if it's we was to introduce brother Branham I'd say that messenger would be quite pleased now we're not looking for brother branham to come back and preach are you estimating I want you to listen to tapes I want you to read the books I want you to do that but let me just say this youyou must have a live ministry that's anointed with the holy ghost ghost got garden called Thunderbolts to the pulpit that's a God in action for you and this day are you with me are you with me now notice what brother Branham says we've come to the last stage the Laodicean age that is our age we know it's the last stage for the Jews are back in Palestine no matter how they got there they are there this is the harvest time and before that can be a harvest there has to be a ripening I'm a maturing of both of the vines the Lutheran age was springtime in the Wesleyan age was a summer growth and the Laodiceans it's a harvest time of the gathering of the tears for the bonding and burning and the garnering the wheat for the Lord harvest turn have you noticed that the harvest time there is a a real acceleration in the ripening there is consequently a slowing of growth until there's no growth is that not exactly what we are seeing now are you with me now notice notice of statement I just I just joined the statement with that the people who took his revelation from God B became to live in epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodists failed God raised up others so that has gone through the years until the Indus last day there is again another people in their land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age that's more than a quote you're the reality to that amen amen are you get are you getting too cold or you're too hot or they say you're cold so mother and if you can just work on the could be in too cold I don't want them too cold I want you to do cold don't you're too hot I want you just wrapped I don't want too big a chance to little chair I want one just right I don't want too big too bad or too little a bit I want one just right I don't want to bigger bowl or too little Bowl I want one just right now I've got the babies on board you know that in the masterpiece he said he'll never be at the harvest time the seed is back to the original condition I must have all the word in order to be the see you can't have a half a seed it won't grow in that right you can't have a half a seed it won't grow you got to have it all you gotta have it all well this is what I think no you've got to have it all you got to eat the whole book forgive me for squeaking my allergies are acting up I feel like Feeny up here brother Brennan said he was squeaking and and people said well why why why do people come to see you preach and he said well he said they must come to see Jesus well you've got a squeaky voice well they come to see Jesus you're an ugly man well they come to see Jesus he said now I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah I believe in speaking in tongues that's just part of the scene he said back now now but now there is added to that he said the life not the gifts the life of the gifts see what I mean weird the end time brethren let me just say this if you we did we've got Jesus we've got every gift Scout the tassel the husk it's dead and dry now there's only one thing that has to happen that is to be gathered in the World Council of Churches for it's burning the world has become flesh exactly like it was promised to do in Luke chapter 17 in Malachi chapter 4 and that's right revelations all true life that was in the stalk and the tassel and the husk is now gathering into the seat ready for the resurrection ready for the harvest the Alpha has become the old make up the first has come last and the last has come first the seed that went in has come through a process and has become seed again the same seed that went down this the same seat that came up with me you'll identify with these scriptures in Hebrews chapter 11 in verse 37 they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were tempted and slain with the sword and they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute and afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they were our brothers and sisters of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens in the cave and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us cannot be made perfect and they'll look at you sometimes we stand in awe how could they give their children up and I want to be too graphic here but there's just nothing you know in this day what makes me want to give my children up as a matter of fact we're anointed to fight for our children will not leave a hoof come on will not leave a one come on there's none of you that I want to lose [Applause] wherefore wish we were compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses all of those has run the race now notice now we come to a next part let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that's so easily beset us and let us run but with patience the race that is set before us I'd like to say this to you I am committed to finishing if my finishing is tonight or next week or 10 years or 20 years or until the rapture happens I am committed I'm not committed till I lose my faith or my emotions go by the wayside or or I don't have the energies no more I am committed sometimes there will be a thousand with you all along the way and it's easy when everybody's energies right there with you and it's raw raw but when you're standing alone that's generally where Satan meets you I'm committed with a thousand or by myself hallelujah what you just think we could have all chosen easier way softer approach more gentle path any cute we got a bottle choose easier ways softer approach easier path had to say it together my thoughts again but I'd like to just report to you I have no regrets so if we've come to the harvest we're the results of all of these years the decades that I've served the Lord since a boy has not been mistake-free there's times that I'm embarrassed and even my own conduct as being a Christian embarrassed that my thoughts never been embarrassed of God under his administration I've never been embarrassed at God but I sure embarrassed him but it didn't throw me away I'm real glad that God don't look at my mistakes said this before this is a good place to have a fresh start you come in from the world you you've had so many habits in your life you come in and God begins to clean you up and begins to worship now in God's memory it's as though you never did it in the first place so that's why I look at you Anna I don't want to I don't want a 15 page report of all the things that you've been through and the habits that you've had and the difficulties and all the things that you've done wasn't good at soccer anyway and I don't need all of those things in your life just jump in there's work to do what can I do feel the need if it's water that needs to go carry water somebody needs an encourage of it pat on the back pat him on the back if you're a man preferably you plant a man on the back you might get some woman but her husband upset at you so if I have no regrets somewhere I committed I've got to do my best I know brother Branham says that you know he uses what you surrendering and he uses what you what you give to him and and all your gifts he can't use that but he uses your weakness I understand that quote but you know if I hired a man and he constantly had his hands in his pocket and said I can't do that I wouldn't have him around long I'm gonna preach to you now now you know if you can find something for me to do you know that's in my ability so what you've got to do is you got to find a spot you see I've been in the secular world I've worked it with government facilities and let me just say the reason that they hire you is is they've got a job to do now they're not going to put I made bombs at one time so their number put your name on the bomb when they sent him over there and then and Iraqi war some of the bombs that I helped make was was shipped off they never told them Ron Spencer help make that bomb but you see America needed some bombs mate and so I was in a program to wear that we made bombs and and and I didn't need my name attached to that are you with me now I was a I was a I was a meat cutter at one time and I didn't sign my name to the filet mignon I never forget I just give you a little story there was a man there was a man that came in to the store and he was a big gruffly Manning to tell if he had money and and he was standing there and I was the youngest butchered in his shop and he said I want I want I want 12 filet mignons that's it and I want his prettier filet mignons is you've ever seen and he said I want you to cut him and I want him right and I said absolutely so I took the time I cut him I I got him ready I put him out and I showed him to the man he said that's not filet mignons okay so the oldest butcher his name was will burn he took those same filet mignons he went back into the cooler he stood down he he goofed off and me and him talked for a while he rearranged those filet mignons and he walked back out and showed demand of LeMans he said now that's what I'm looking for long story short God gives these young people as well as he uses old people we've got a job to do do the best that you can do in that job [Applause] when you can say it like this I have given my all I have given my all I've left nothing undone that's quite a statement nothing has been left undone I can look back and see where I could have done better I'm gonna look back to see where I could have done better but it was the best that I had at the moment that I was in everybody can be a Monday Morning Quarterback or Blanca and look back at two human mistakes what I'd like to say that even tonight I want to present my best whether I'm the speaker or whether that I'm the hero I want to give my best so our church is not a Church of what we would say entertainment our church is a church where we come and we worship together and we're at the harvest time and so we realize that every minute is important I do realize in this fast-moving world that in the entertainment you're entertained you get up in the morning I heard brother Donnie talking the other day you get up in the morning the Fox News and CNN news and and The Weather Channel and and the local channels and after a while you find the scripture that doesn't mean all those things are wrong you just gotta have a good balance to it I was interested in the storm that was coming up the coach this week and and I prayed diligently if there's ever been a storm the prayed for I prayed for that one it would stay at sea because I've been through some storms I don't like him I don't like lightning I really don't like it sister Katie she loves lightning flash and she likes to go out and settle the Borchard watch the lightness of flash but you see up in on the end of one of them things knocked head off my weed eater thank God I had a weed eater in my hand man named Spurgeon's walking down the road with his best friend he's a boy lightning hits his best friend kills his best friend that lightning bolt killed his best friend but it woke him up to eternal life he was left here for a job I'd like to say that you've been left here for a job last weekend we came to this building with expectation and I trust our expectation has not been diminished are you Amy Paul would say it like this for I'm now ready to be offered up and the time of my departure let's just call it his harvest season what's at hand notice what he says I have fought a good fight I have finished my course notice these next words I have kept the faith Satan has sent me a lot of different directions but I'm still standing henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge now let me just say this to you he is the administrator of the wheel so he knows whether we've done good or bad he knows whether we've done our best he knows shall give me at that day not to me only but unto them all of them that love his appearing he would say it again brethren Philippians 3 verse 13 brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind are you with me we're not Catholics we don't relive it over and over and over and over again and scar and bring it all up over and over and over again what you are wear in your past bury that thing let it die don't even bring it up if I brother Kim Boyer could have a tumor that was in his brain and he refused to give that thing voice and it was destroying his life he refused to take an aspirin he refused to take a Tylenol he refused to take a pain pill because he did not want to give that thing voice in his life let me just say cancer it's not your ruler depression is not your ruler so there's no need worshipping it I'm not against you taking pain medicine I'm not against you taking the drugs that you need to take that was his revelation are you with me I go to doctors I have good doctor I'm getting ready to go to a dental appointment on Wednesday to have oral surgery I'm not looking forward to that but I know if I don't do it I won't look good as sister Gregory looked those who know you know forgetting those things which are behind you ever felt like someone's telling somebody don't you just forget it why why don't you just forget it you might make them mad they keep bringing you up and up and up and up again now let me just say this to you I don't bring this up with Connie she don't bring this up with me she don't compare me to somebody else that she knew before maybe one of her boyfriends when she was in school or whatever she never brings that up I I don't never bring up nothing are you with me now those things are dead and you were married at one time to the old sin nature don't bring them back up I'll took you around the corner that's how to get you to don't bring that original ruler of your life back up well III miss what those drugs did for me and I I miss are you come on church I miss that and I'm gonna rehab center let me just say if you get a hold of Jesus and you get him just right that'll be baked out of your life let it go let it go my god oh no I came here as a pastor about ninety nine we started the process mm brother Homer and I took a trip together it was just he and I we took a trip together and we were driving down the interstate we were about 12 hours from here we're driving down the interstate and we're just going down the road and and I just made a little statement about my past life in the business world and then the chimney world and he and he just said and it's over and it's over and God just closed that chapter and it's over we're driving and we're getting up we're getting off on an exit I still remember we're getting off an exit and the revelation of how God cello's as a chapter on your life is kind of like that and he goes that's the end that's the end hit me and it hit me in that moment how God transitions you from one spot to another spot and how he moves you and you just kind of closes the chapter I'm coming toward a closer to an end of the service and Ruth was a more Vitus she was a servant in the field there come a time he just went rehab was a heart was a harlot and she became the captain's wife and the sin that was deposited in her later part of the lineage of Jesus Christ [Applause] many years ago I was called to the place it was away from here and a girl had lived a real ragged life night she had been devastated and boys had taken advantage of her she had got drunk and boys had taken advantage of her and her life seemed to be destroyed they called us to her to do a room we made the journey to where she was at I didn't go with a critical view I didn't walk into where she was at with a critical telling her all kind of things I began to talk to her about a god rich in mercy a God that can take you from last night and that be done and over with a God that can forgive you and help you to forgive yourself and can take you and make a real lady out of you a real lady out of you I'll tell you that girl that had a had a stained past and almost destroyed listens it don't take just moments for sin Satan to just destroy you and and and that girl right there in that room give her heart to Jesus Christ and I'll tell you she's a real lady today come on church Oh some people say well I've made some mistakes I know God knows how to change the chapter isn't that right I know God against the parole board and this is your you're free you're forgiven it's like God knows how to change your life live in a society this full of secret in nine cents it goes on God knows how to come and in that secret you know tell the world you're not to tell a bunch of people you don't have to be accountable like a vowels of Alcoholics Anonymous you just need a touch of Jesus that's what you need just a touch of Jesus let him transform your life maybe I'll close here now I'd like to say this to you Satan could have hid he destroyed you in a moment he would have destroyed you with the choices that you made because some of your choices wasn't good choices and others had bad intentions that caught you in circumstances you don't even want to tell your children about or maybe not even your made about but you know that it took God rich in mercy to get you here I like a God that knows how to take and forgive us of those things and not hold it against us no more and then we teach our children never do those things don't you do those things don't do this thing I'm preaching to you I'm preaching to you we can't live in Laodicea and overcome it we can't live in or Laodicea there's going to be some overcomers sage the song says it when we're inside those gates of pearl we'll learn a lot of things we'll have a heart that's made of gold perhaps a thousand string well sing and shout and dance about the lamb will dry your tears we'll have one grand homecoming week the first well the Homer came up to our place one day and he was in an old truck it's a guiding him just worse it's working on a bulldozer across the where you live Andrew he's working on a bulldozer Homer drove up we'd

about dry our tears brother Branham says this he said I believe that's right at the door really makes me nervous when I think not nervous for myself but nervous nervous of this have I done my best is there one more ounce in me that I could give for the kingdom of God is there something that I could have done because this is the only opportunity we're ever going to have right now I want you to realize you're only mortal once you're only mortal once that's a good time to praise the Lord right there I'm really glad I don't have to go through this again that's a reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and said in the book of life there will come a sound from heaven that'll take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into the bride that will take her from the earth in a rapture in grace God promised it I don't care how many science and how many astronauts that they signed up and everything else and how many million miles they can see I don't care nothing about that I like that I don't care nothing about that there is a heaven and there is a literal Lord Jesus Christ there will come in a body form to receive the church to himself no matter how old the story seems it's still the truth God said so and that's what believers believe [Applause] that's what we believe [Applause] well I looked at my hands and my hands look new I looked at my feet and my feet did too
