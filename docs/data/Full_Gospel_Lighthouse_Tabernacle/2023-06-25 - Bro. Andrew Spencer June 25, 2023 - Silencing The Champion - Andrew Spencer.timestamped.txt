[50:03] you have your Bibles this morning would
[50:04] like to look over in the scriptures of
[50:06] first Samuel chapter 17.
[50:09] first Samuel chapter 17 and verse 4 and
[50:12] also Matthew chapter 27 and verse 26
[50:15] again this morning
[50:36] first Samuel chapter 17.
[50:39] and verse 4.
[50:42] I'd like to speak to you again this
[50:44] morning
[50:44] pick up where we left off last evening
[50:47] on silencing
[50:49] the champion
[50:52] and there went out a champion out of the
[50:55] camp of the Philistines named Goliath of
[50:57] gath whose height was six cubits and a
[50:59] span
[51:00] and he had a helmet of brass upon his
[51:02] head and he was armed with a coat of
[51:04] mail and the weight of the coat was five
[51:06] thousand shekels of brass
[51:08] and he had Grieves a brass upon his legs
[51:10] and a target of brass between his
[51:12] shoulders and the staff of his spear was
[51:15] like a Weaver's beam and his Spears head
[51:17] weighed at 600 shekels of iron
[51:20] and one bearing as Shield went before
[51:22] him and he stood and Cried unto the
[51:24] armies of Israel and said unto them why
[51:27] are you come out to set your battle in
[51:30] Array and not I a Philistine and you the
[51:32] Servants of to Saul choose you a man for
[51:35] you and let him come down to me and if
[51:37] he be able to fight with me and to kill
[51:39] me then will we be your servants but if
[51:42] I Prevail against him and kill him then
[51:45] shall ye be our servants and serve us
[51:48] and the Philistine said I defy the
[51:51] armies of Israel this day give me a man
[51:54] that we may fight together and when Saul
[51:57] and all of Israel heard those words of
[52:00] the Philistine they were dismayed and
[52:03] greatly afraid
[52:04] Matthew chapter 27
[52:07] verse 26
[52:15] Matthew chapter 27 and verse 26 there
[52:19] amen isn't he good to us this morning
[52:27] amen
[52:29] then released he Barabbas unto them and
[52:32] when he had scourged Jesus
[52:35] he delivered him to be crucified
[52:37] then the soldiers of the governor took
[52:40] Jesus into the common Hall and gathered
[52:42] unto him the whole band of soldiers
[52:44] and they stripped him and put on him a
[52:46] Scarlet robe and when they had planted a
[52:49] crown of thorns they put it upon his
[52:51] head and a reed in his right hand and
[52:54] they bowed the knee before him and
[52:56] mocked him saying Hell
[52:58] King of the Jews and they spit upon him
[53:01] and they took the Reed and smote him on
[53:03] the head
[53:04] and after that they had mocked him they
[53:06] they took the robe off from him
[53:09] put on his own Raymond on him and led
[53:11] him away to crucify him
[53:14] and as they came out they found a man of
[53:16] Cyrene Simon by name
[53:19] him they compelled to bear his cross and
[53:21] when they were coming to a place called
[53:24] Golgotha that is to say a place of a
[53:28] school may God bless his word he may be
[53:30] seated today in the presence of the Lord
[53:32] so Seb would like to speak to you again
[53:34] on this thought
[53:36] on silencing
[53:37] a champion
[53:40] brother Burnham makes this statement
[53:42] several times
[53:45] but he said one day when Adam's race was
[53:47] backed into a corner
[53:50] where the law and the judgments and the
[53:52] prophets and everything had been sent
[53:54] and failed nothing could be done
[53:57] human race was doomed the great armies
[53:59] of hell was marching on well trained and
[54:02] in their ranks and every man to his
[54:03] place
[54:04] he said they'd backed Adam's children
[54:06] into the corner where they could go no
[54:08] farther they sent the law they couldn't
[54:11] keep it they sent judgments they
[54:13] wouldn't listen to it they plunged right
[54:14] on and they sent the prophets they
[54:16] stoned those and nothing could be done
[54:18] they were backed into a corner but in
[54:21] glory one day the most precious thing of
[54:24] Heaven stepped out before the angels of
[54:26] God and said this day will I give my
[54:29] life for the sons of Adam this day will
[54:31] I do something that'll break the ranks
[54:34] of the enemy the angels all said what
[54:36] will you do what will you do he came to
[54:39] the Earth as a virgin and at Calvary
[54:41] when he went to Calvary stood on this
[54:43] Earth and preached the gospel he said
[54:45] I'm going to give you some material I
[54:47] want you to go up to the city of
[54:49] Jerusalem and I want you to wait
[54:50] therefore I'm going to dress you I'm
[54:53] going to make you soldiers to fight
[54:54] against The Wiles of the enemy but first
[54:56] before you go into the Battlefront go up
[54:59] to Jerusalem and wait there and I want
[55:01] and what I give you you follow me and
[55:04] fight as best as you can and he said
[55:07] there on that dark day of Calvary the
[55:09] Lamb of God the precious son of God that
[55:11] came down from Glory never taken the way
[55:14] of a denomination he never taken the way
[55:16] of some easy Road he never taken the
[55:18] form of some ecclesiastical system but
[55:21] he went to the darkest and roughest part
[55:23] of the spears the Valley of the shadow
[55:25] of death he grabbed all of death and
[55:27] threw it into his bosom and he died a
[55:30] hero when he sit down the Holy Ghost on
[55:32] the day of Pentecost as I said I want to
[55:36] speak to you on this thought on
[55:37] silencing the champion and last night we
[55:40] left you in a spot with Goliath down in
[55:42] the valley but this morning I want
[55:43] somebody to do something for me I want
[55:46] you to wake that Goliath up and tell him
[55:48] that it's his day to die
[55:51] I hope you had a good night's sleep down
[55:53] there Goliath we left you down there all
[55:55] night thinking about what's coming today
[55:57] but wake up
[55:58] there's a storm coming
[56:03] wake up David wake up David it's your
[56:07] morning too you've been rise up for this
[56:10] moment for this hour and we recognize
[56:12] that that God's going to do something
[56:14] special on this day that we watch these
[56:17] two dramas God is getting ready to do
[56:19] something that has never been done
[56:21] before we've got two scenes that are set
[56:23] before us two Champions that are set out
[56:25] before the children of God that they
[56:27] they show up and they're constantly
[56:30] warring against the children of God
[56:32] breathing threatening lies down upon
[56:34] them and a champion a champion is
[56:37] somebody that has never lost to somebody
[56:39] it's a champion that undertakes a combat
[56:41] it's a champion that fights in the cause
[56:44] of somebody else he's known as a
[56:46] mercenary he's he's known as a warrior
[56:49] he's known as the as the enemy of death
[56:52] he is known as one that challenges and
[56:55] he does not lose and these two Champions
[56:58] have come to this come to this Valley or
[57:00] come to these moments and they've come
[57:02] here with a purpose in mind so that they
[57:05] would win the battle but today is a
[57:08] different day we look and we see one is
[57:10] the descendant of the anakims he's over
[57:13] nine foot tall he he weighs over 700
[57:16] pounds in his natural abilities David
[57:19] only weighed 110 pounds death Wade had
[57:24] all of the statures of killing men
[57:26] thousands of men millions of men and had
[57:29] never lost but there was a man that
[57:32] weighed under 150 150 pounds it didn't
[57:35] matter how big he was brother random
[57:37] said he was a small man in stature he
[57:40] said the angel of the Lord is about six
[57:41] foot tall he said but Jesus is a real
[57:44] small man here here's this man weighing
[57:46] under 150 pounds but it isn't the size
[57:49] of the dog in the fight it's the size of
[57:53] the fight that's in the dog and this man
[57:55] Jesus Christ is looking at something
[57:58] that has never been defeated there have
[58:00] been great men that look death in the
[58:02] eyes but this day was going to be a
[58:04] different day because death was going to
[58:06] meet God face to face they had looked
[58:09] about it they had talked about it all
[58:11] the ranks of Hell had looked about this
[58:13] one they've seen his actions as the
[58:15] Messiah but brother Branham said that
[58:17] the cross was the greatest was the seal
[58:20] the final seal to his messiahship and
[58:23] here as Jesus is going and making his
[58:26] Triumph up to calvary's heel Satan
[58:29] doesn't even realize what he is about to
[58:31] do
[58:33] he would have never done what he was
[58:35] going to do on this day if he would have
[58:37] really known that Jesus was the son of
[58:39] God if he knew that he was going to
[58:41] bring that much threat to his kingdom
[58:44] he'd never allow those Roman soldiers to
[58:47] stick that spear in his side or to hang
[58:50] him upon that cross but today is a
[58:52] different day today death does not reign
[58:55] as a champion no more today Goliath does
[58:58] not reign as a champion no more
[59:00] you said well I'm looking at the battle
[59:02] from my natural eye and it looks like
[59:04] Goliath he's about 600 and
[59:07] 680 pounds more than what David is if
[59:11] you're going to look at this battle with
[59:12] your natural eye you are going to lose
[59:15] because the Bible says in second
[59:17] Corinthians 4 and 17 that our light
[59:20] Affliction which is butter for a moment
[59:22] working for us a far more exceeding and
[59:25] eternal weight of Glory while we look
[59:26] not at the things which are seen But of
[59:29] the things which are not seen for the
[59:30] things which are seen are temperable but
[59:33] the things which are not seen are
[59:35] Eternal that means that they are without
[59:37] beginning and they are Without End they
[59:39] never cease so the things that you
[59:41] cannot see in this room today
[59:44] the victory that you need in your life
[59:46] is not going to end
[59:50] come on somebody you are looking at a
[59:52] victory through the resurrection you're
[59:54] not looking at a victory through some
[59:57] man's doings you're looking at a victory
[59:59] through the Eternal God that said that
[1:00:02] you was going to win the battle
[1:00:04] we are not looking at the things of the
[1:00:06] temporal world the things that you're
[1:00:07] constantly battling things of the trials
[1:00:10] and the Sorrows of life you see if you
[1:00:12] keep your mind fixed holy upon the
[1:00:14] sicknesses that you face in the battles
[1:00:16] that you fear and the things that you're
[1:00:18] going against every little light and
[1:00:20] brief suffering is going to cause you
[1:00:22] great turmoil in this life but if you
[1:00:25] can just simply turn your eyes
[1:00:27] turn your eyes away from sickness turn
[1:00:29] your eyes away from pain
[1:00:32] what am I saying to you I'm saying that
[1:00:34] you've got to get your eyes off of
[1:00:36] Goliath and you've got to get your eyes
[1:00:38] upon the Battle of what God has said
[1:00:40] that there is a word
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:43] I know that I'm a little bit ahead of
[1:00:45] myself here but I want you to know that
[1:00:47] there is prophecy that will take you
[1:00:49] through your temporal moments because
[1:00:51] the Bible said I reckon that the
[1:00:53] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:00:56] worthy to be compared to the glory which
[1:00:58] shall be revealed in you and I so
[1:01:01] Goliath is only working for my good
[1:01:05] foreign
[1:01:06] every little trial every little
[1:01:08] toothache every little headache every
[1:01:10] little thing that you go through is
[1:01:12] simply working things out for the good
[1:01:14] because Christians are not designed to
[1:01:16] look at the problems Christians are
[1:01:19] designed to look at the promise
[1:01:21] if that was not so then Moses when he
[1:01:24] looked out the same window that Pharaoh
[1:01:26] looked out he would have simply seen the
[1:01:28] same thing from Rosine which was mud
[1:01:30] daubers and slaves but when Moses took a
[1:01:33] look out that same window he seen a
[1:01:36] promise on a people that were slaves
[1:01:38] people that were beat people that were
[1:01:40] in turmoil he was looking at the same
[1:01:42] things but through a promise
[1:01:45] and if you can look at your problem
[1:01:46] through the promise the problem is over
[1:01:50] if you need a provider he is your
[1:01:53] provider
[1:01:54] if you need somebody to take you and be
[1:01:57] your Providence he is that kind of a God
[1:01:59] let me tell you if he could take George
[1:02:01] Washington because of across a frozen
[1:02:04] Delaware River
[1:02:06] with Providence on his side he knew that
[1:02:08] he was going over there and he was
[1:02:10] taking an army that didn't have shoes on
[1:02:13] their feet they were freezing but they
[1:02:15] were men that had believed and prayed to
[1:02:18] almighty God
[1:02:21] George Washington teaches us a very
[1:02:24] powerful statement and a very very
[1:02:26] powerful key in life if you can be
[1:02:28] persistent in your prayer life you can
[1:02:31] pre persistence in your battles
[1:02:37] the battle is spent 90 percent time
[1:02:41] in prayer
[1:02:45] my brother Brandon said that David when
[1:02:46] he come to this battle he didn't even
[1:02:48] have to pray through
[1:02:50] because God had already prayed him
[1:02:52] through him
[1:02:56] this guy ain't never been beat
[1:03:02] this guy has never he's never lost a
[1:03:05] case
[1:03:06] he's went out time and time again
[1:03:09] and he brought back the spoils to the
[1:03:11] Philistines but this day was a different
[1:03:13] day
[1:03:17] these things are built for a purpose the
[1:03:19] trials that you're in the troubles that
[1:03:21] you're in are built for a purpose
[1:03:24] but we recognize that we as Christians
[1:03:27] we recognize that our whole armor is
[1:03:30] Supernatural that we are not relying
[1:03:32] upon the things that we see because you
[1:03:34] cannot be a Christian and have to see
[1:03:36] the thing you cannot see you cannot you
[1:03:39] cannot see your faith
[1:03:41] but you can see your works
[1:03:44] you cannot see the holy spirit in this
[1:03:46] room but you can see the effects of the
[1:03:48] Holy Spirit
[1:03:49] you cannot see your Victory as it's
[1:03:51] coming to pass right now but you see the
[1:03:54] manifestation of the word as it's being
[1:03:56] coming and to pass you see you are up
[1:03:59] against a great obstacle you are up
[1:04:01] against Great needs you are up against
[1:04:03] big things but you need a supreme god
[1:04:06] that made a supreme promise and a
[1:04:08] supreme result will come to pass what am
[1:04:11] I saying is that this God is superior to
[1:04:14] all others and brother random said in
[1:04:16] looking at the Unseen that when a man
[1:04:18] once catches that vision of the
[1:04:20] invisible God and knows that he's always
[1:04:22] present that there's something that
[1:04:24] stabilizes that man's thinking it
[1:04:27] stabilizes his actions in the time of
[1:04:29] distress it'll still make him look
[1:04:31] upward and above the things that are
[1:04:33] happening around him because he's
[1:04:34] looking at the Unseen yet by a promise
[1:04:37] so you've got to go beyond what you see
[1:04:39] you've got to go beyond what you feel
[1:04:42] you've got to go beyond your
[1:04:43] Consciousness you've got to go beyond
[1:04:45] your imaginations to find a supernatural
[1:04:48] God
[1:04:50] come on now if you sit there in your
[1:04:52] condition if you sit there with what you
[1:04:55] see you are simply going to allow
[1:04:57] Goliath to win the battle but I believe
[1:04:59] with everything that's within me that
[1:05:01] there's some Davids in the room today
[1:05:06] okay
[1:05:08] let me tell you you cannot just tell
[1:05:10] this Goliath to stick his sock in it and
[1:05:12] keep your mouth shut you've got a job to
[1:05:14] do
[1:05:15] the things that keeps whispering in your
[1:05:17] ear of complexes and stigmas of things
[1:05:21] that I'm not well I'm not good enough I
[1:05:23] always deal with this you cannot simply
[1:05:26] say stick a sock in that keep your mouth
[1:05:28] shut you've got to deal with the thing
[1:05:31] you see you've got to come to a spot
[1:05:33] where the enemy cannot make you
[1:05:35] compromise you've got to come to a spot
[1:05:37] like Joshua when he was coming down to
[1:05:39] the end of his ministry and he said
[1:05:41] choose you this day whom you're going to
[1:05:43] serve whether you're going to serve the
[1:05:45] gods of Egypt or whether you're going to
[1:05:47] serve the god that is the god of Heaven
[1:05:49] I cannot imagine anybody in the right
[1:05:52] mind going out and serving a God that
[1:05:54] will beat you that will whip you that
[1:05:57] will put you in Chains put you in a mud
[1:05:59] pit make you a slave beat you slay your
[1:06:02] children antagonize you constantly whip
[1:06:05] you constantly attack you
[1:06:07] but Joshua's saying choose you this name
[1:06:10] if you want to be beaten if you want to
[1:06:12] be destroyed if you want to be
[1:06:13] antagonized go out there and serve that
[1:06:16] God but as for me and my house
[1:06:18] first for me and my house we are going
[1:06:21] to serve the Lord
[1:06:22] he said well I don't see anybody going
[1:06:24] out there going down in the mud pit oh
[1:06:27] yes you do you see a lot of so-called
[1:06:29] Christians that are still dressing like
[1:06:31] the world dancing like the world acting
[1:06:34] like the world but today's a day where
[1:06:36] you choose
[1:06:38] it is choosing day you either let
[1:06:40] Goliath through your life you let
[1:06:42] complexes rule your life you let stigmas
[1:06:45] you let jealousy you let bitterness or
[1:06:48] you're going to choose to serve the god
[1:06:50] that is able
[1:06:53] to cast to cast things down to clock cut
[1:06:56] his head off is well I'm not able to do
[1:06:58] it let me tell you what you've been
[1:07:00] given has the ability to cut his head
[1:07:02] off
[1:07:03] jealousy is not going to win in this
[1:07:05] Arena bitterness is not going to win in
[1:07:07] this Arena when the world tries to slip
[1:07:10] in and stick its polish upon our young
[1:07:12] girls and stick its ideas upon our young
[1:07:15] boys we say we're going to be different
[1:07:22] laughs you're living in a world where
[1:07:25] everybody you see out there is weird
[1:07:29] and they look on you as the weird ones
[1:07:33] they look on you and think man why in
[1:07:35] the world are they still dressing like
[1:07:37] that don't they know that we're in the
[1:07:38] 21st century that we can do whatever we
[1:07:40] want to let me tell you something
[1:07:42] there's not one ounce of me that wants
[1:07:45] to look like the world dressed like the
[1:07:47] world act like the world there ain't
[1:07:49] nothing Goliath has upon his armor that
[1:07:52] I think that I need upon my body I don't
[1:07:54] need a spear I don't need his Target of
[1:07:57] brass I don't need his shekels of iron I
[1:07:59] don't need anything that Goliath's God
[1:08:01] because when I get done with the Goliath
[1:08:04] he will be able to carry it no more he
[1:08:08] might be 700 pounds but he won't be able
[1:08:10] to carry this 200 pound of armor when I
[1:08:13] get done with him
[1:08:15] come on somebody the giant you might be
[1:08:18] facing might be close to a thousand
[1:08:20] pounds but the word of the Lord says
[1:08:23] take his head off
[1:08:26] there ain't a cancer devil too strong
[1:08:31] for the rock that David's got in his
[1:08:33] hand they're in a tuberculosis demon out
[1:08:36] there that is too big for the rock that
[1:08:39] David's got in his hand
[1:08:42] I hope it's okay today but they're in a
[1:08:44] depression or an oppression a stigma a
[1:08:47] complex an idea that is bigger than the
[1:08:50] rock that David's got in his hands it's
[1:08:53] time that we give Goliath a makeup
[1:08:55] change and we show him who's boss in the
[1:08:58] arena
[1:09:00] come on somebody he's been roaring for
[1:09:03] 40 days
[1:09:04] we're the message of the hour but he's
[1:09:07] been ruined for 40 days we got the most
[1:09:10] powerful God on our side but he's been
[1:09:12] roaring for 40 days
[1:09:16] come on now
[1:09:19] he Wars in your flesh he Wars in your
[1:09:22] mind and he Wars in your soul
[1:09:25] he roars
[1:09:27] he whispers he lies he tells you things
[1:09:31] that are going to come to pass he tells
[1:09:34] you things that you're going to live
[1:09:36] with this the rest of your life
[1:09:39] let me tell you something I have
[1:09:41] listened to that devil over and over and
[1:09:44] over again
[1:09:45] I spent hours in my study
[1:09:51] I've spent hours in my study
[1:09:54] and Satan's standing back there so you
[1:09:55] better not preach that
[1:09:58] they're gonna get mad at you and papa
[1:10:01] says go ahead
[1:10:03] go ahead go ahead
[1:10:09] you're gonna make people mad they're
[1:10:11] gonna get upset on you they're gonna get
[1:10:12] mad at you papa says you go right ahead
[1:10:14] you preach them the abilities that they
[1:10:17] have the abilities to cut Cancer's head
[1:10:20] off to cut suicide's head off couldn't
[1:10:22] do to cut depression heads off
[1:10:25] to cut the rest of the Wilderness off
[1:10:27] what is it there is a word of the Lord
[1:10:30] that is greater than the lives of the
[1:10:32] enemy the enemy will try to make you
[1:10:34] compromise and not live the word preach
[1:10:37] the word and be the word but papa says
[1:10:39] you can do it you can do it you can live
[1:10:42] this message the Goliath stands out
[1:10:45] there said send me somebody down here
[1:10:47] and we'll serve them or you'll serve us
[1:10:50] but we're not here to compromise
[1:10:58] let me tell you we've had enough of the
[1:11:00] devil
[1:11:01] trying to come into the ranks of the
[1:11:02] message and say that these things are
[1:11:05] not the way that they used to be
[1:11:07] we've had enough of the devil trying to
[1:11:09] slip in under the walls and try to come
[1:11:12] under the word and try to push things
[1:11:13] upon our young people and push things
[1:11:15] Upon Our ideas upon upon our own our
[1:11:18] brothers and sisters Veterans of the
[1:11:19] message
[1:11:20] and makes him think that it's okay
[1:11:23] but I'm not serving a dead God
[1:11:26] I'm serving to God
[1:11:29] I'll be honest with you god ain't
[1:11:31] looking for some hoochie God is looking
[1:11:34] for somebody that knows how to dress the
[1:11:36] message live the message and be the
[1:11:39] message if God wanted to rest to the
[1:11:41] world he'd went out there and got them
[1:11:43] but God is looking for a Ruth and he's
[1:11:45] looking for a Rahab yeah you gotta but
[1:11:48] you gotta pass yes you got a history but
[1:11:50] when God gets done with you you're not
[1:11:53] known like that no more you don't dress
[1:11:55] like that no more you don't act like
[1:11:57] that no more what is this about
[1:12:01] this is saying that there's a land
[1:12:04] it's a Holy Ghost Land it's a redeeming
[1:12:06] land there's a power in this land
[1:12:16] let me tell you if the king wanted vasty
[1:12:19] he could have had her
[1:12:21] but God ain't wanting a vasty when he
[1:12:24] can have an Esther
[1:12:26] come on message people God ain't one he
[1:12:30] ain't One Nevada dresses herself up the
[1:12:32] way that she wants to he's wanting an
[1:12:35] Esther that dresses the way that the
[1:12:38] king wants her to dress
[1:12:41] [Applause]
[1:12:45] another random said if I had 20 lives to
[1:12:47] live or a hundred lives I'd want every
[1:12:50] one of them for the Lord Jesus he said
[1:12:52] if there wasn't a heaven to go to
[1:12:53] afterwards I'd still want to serve the
[1:12:56] Lord Jesus for the peace and
[1:12:57] satisfaction that I have of knowing that
[1:13:00] he lives and because how he lives I can
[1:13:03] live also
[1:13:04] is what I can live with this I've got by
[1:13:07] with it so far brother Branham said he
[1:13:10] said you better destroy your enemy
[1:13:11] before your enemy destroys you
[1:13:14] I can deal with this doping I can deal
[1:13:17] with this smoking I can deal with this
[1:13:19] dipping
[1:13:22] you better destroy your enemy before
[1:13:25] your enemy destroys you
[1:13:29] it's okay if we quote the prophet in the
[1:13:31] Pulpit here today you better destroy
[1:13:34] your enemy before your enemy destroys
[1:13:36] you because Goliath has got the strength
[1:13:39] Goliath has got the power Goliath has
[1:13:41] got the mentality Goliath has got the
[1:13:43] ideas he's a warrior
[1:13:46] and he's looking for somebody that's
[1:13:49] easy to take so you better destroy your
[1:13:51] enemy before your enemy destroys you
[1:13:54] how do we do it William hanum bring back
[1:13:57] them old-fashioned prayer meetings
[1:14:00] old-fashioned repentance when they stay
[1:14:02] to the altar until they was dead and
[1:14:04] finished with sin you never seen a woman
[1:14:06] go to the Altar and die to sin and next
[1:14:08] day come back with bob hair painted on
[1:14:10] her face and there's no such the Holy
[1:14:13] Spirit teaches nature does the nature of
[1:14:15] the Holy Spirit he said you never seen a
[1:14:17] woman going out there dressing sexy and
[1:14:20] coming in and trying to cover themselves
[1:14:21] up you never seen a man that was afraid
[1:14:23] to stand up and Afraid his little wife
[1:14:25] would leave him or something another
[1:14:26] because he took the initiative well man
[1:14:30] we're men in them days and they spoke
[1:14:32] like they were men and they governed
[1:14:34] their own house
[1:14:38] that's for me and my house
[1:14:40] we gonna serve the Lord
[1:14:43] what are you talking about brother
[1:14:45] Andrew I'm talking that I'm on this
[1:14:47] altar
[1:14:51] I'm on this altar
[1:14:54] I'm on this altar I'm here laying before
[1:14:56] the Lord Lord whatever it takes
[1:15:03] I come to this cancer giant time and
[1:15:06] time again
[1:15:09] and I look him in the face
[1:15:13] and I see him whispering all kinds of
[1:15:16] threats
[1:15:19] but I go to a rock that's higher than me
[1:15:25] and I speak these words Lord
[1:15:27] if there's anything in my life
[1:15:30] that would hold Randy Hinkle back from
[1:15:32] getting completely delivered or Ron
[1:15:34] Spencer or Erica Parker or this brother
[1:15:36] brother brother Donnie and sister Betty
[1:15:38] anything if there's anything
[1:15:40] in my life
[1:15:44] what is what are you saying I'm saying
[1:15:46] we're her body
[1:15:48] and the body cannot operate at full
[1:15:50] power
[1:15:51] unless we're operating at the same speed
[1:15:53] but if you can get the man down in the
[1:15:56] engine room and the man up top saying
[1:15:58] the same thing and going in the same
[1:16:00] room in the same realm you are going to
[1:16:03] break into a realm of impossibilities so
[1:16:07] if I can get my heart right and I can
[1:16:09] get my spirit right and I can get my
[1:16:11] flesh so much Sanctified that all of a
[1:16:14] sudden hell don't know what to do with
[1:16:17] the Church of the Living God
[1:16:21] David knew what he was doing walking
[1:16:24] down into this Valley
[1:16:27] Jesus knew what he was doing climbing up
[1:16:29] that hill he had enough power
[1:16:33] to stop all of them in their tracks he
[1:16:36] could have stopped the spit in their
[1:16:37] mouth before it ever got out their lips
[1:16:41] he knew what he was doing
[1:16:48] but Jesus
[1:16:50] don't care what you do to him on the way
[1:16:52] to the cross
[1:16:57] spit on him
[1:16:58] knock on him make fun of him curse him
[1:17:06] this is for you Doug Bowman
[1:17:09] this is for your family let them spit on
[1:17:12] me
[1:17:13] because I think you're worthy enough
[1:17:16] I think you're great enough
[1:17:18] I think you're righteous enough I'm
[1:17:20] gonna let him spit on me
[1:17:30] I'm the god that created heavens and
[1:17:32] earth
[1:17:33] I'm the god that spins worlds into
[1:17:36] existence right off my fingertips
[1:17:39] but I'm gonna let my own creation
[1:17:42] take the saliva that I created in their
[1:17:44] bodies
[1:17:46] to wet their lips and wet their mouths
[1:17:48] when they're in a dry spell
[1:17:50] I'm going to allow it
[1:17:52] to form in the back part of their mouth
[1:17:57] and I'm going to allow them
[1:17:59] to spit on me
[1:18:02] so that they can't spit on you
[1:18:07] is this man Worthy
[1:18:12] I'll say he is
[1:18:18] you see what am I doing this for
[1:18:20] it's because this thing that you
[1:18:22] constantly face in your own life
[1:18:25] has never been defeated
[1:18:27] you live to a certain age of 70 to 80
[1:18:30] years old and you constantly go by the
[1:18:32] way of the grave
[1:18:34] man is appointed to death and he's given
[1:18:37] a spotter and last spot of time to 70
[1:18:39] years old and anything over that is the
[1:18:42] grace of the Lord
[1:18:44] but he is saying that I am going to be
[1:18:48] their propitiation that I am going to
[1:18:51] offer up my life once and for all
[1:18:54] so that you don't have to bear the power
[1:18:57] of sin upon your life I'm going to take
[1:19:00] it upon my flesh I don't know sin but
[1:19:03] I'm going to take your sin
[1:19:08] you better know what you're doing when
[1:19:09] you go down in this Valley because when
[1:19:11] you get in this Valley you're going to
[1:19:12] get scarred you're going to get made fun
[1:19:15] of you're going to get ridiculed you're
[1:19:17] going to get spit on people are going to
[1:19:19] say you're too small you ain't big
[1:19:20] enough don't know the message don't have
[1:19:22] the Holy Ghost you better know what
[1:19:24] you're doing
[1:19:28] you better know what you're doing when
[1:19:30] you walk into this Valley
[1:19:33] you're too Ruddy you're too young you're
[1:19:36] not big enough you're not strong enough
[1:19:42] you better have a revelation that that
[1:19:45] champion is his last name you better be
[1:19:48] able to look like Through The Eyes of
[1:19:50] Jesus Christ and see that this is the
[1:19:53] last day that death Reigns over my
[1:19:55] mortal bodies
[1:19:57] hahaha
[1:20:02] Hallelujah
[1:20:05] Hallelujah
[1:20:08] Hallelujah
[1:20:11] Hallelujah
[1:20:13] because what Satan is wanting to do to
[1:20:15] you
[1:20:18] is disarm you
[1:20:21] by his Whispers of Lies
[1:20:23] because brother Bynum would say that
[1:20:25] your weapon is powerful it's the
[1:20:28] greatest weapon that's ever been given
[1:20:29] unto mankind was the word of the Lord
[1:20:32] but if Satan can make you feel like your
[1:20:36] weapon is inadequate he's got you
[1:20:38] whipped right there and he's disarmed
[1:20:40] you because he's got you to disbelieve
[1:20:43] that your weapon is powerful enough
[1:20:45] but notice notice when William Branham
[1:20:47] goes into and he goes to break into the
[1:20:50] Philadelphian Church age in Revelations
[1:20:52] 3 and 8 he said I know thou Works he
[1:20:54] said behold I've set before thee and
[1:20:56] open doors that no man can shut it for
[1:20:58] thou has little strength and has kept my
[1:21:00] word and has not deny my name and when
[1:21:03] brother Branham goes in there to break
[1:21:04] into this break into this uh Church age
[1:21:07] here the Philadelphia Church age that
[1:21:10] there he begins to show us a lap over
[1:21:12] and you remember that brother by him
[1:21:14] that the Lord shows brother around him a
[1:21:16] dream of a of a man that is beating this
[1:21:18] woman brother Brown thought it was his
[1:21:20] mom at first and there that man was
[1:21:22] beating this this woman with a
[1:21:24] three-corner club which we knew was
[1:21:26] Triune baptism and every time that she
[1:21:29] would go to receive power that that man
[1:21:31] would begin to beat on her and we
[1:21:33] recognize that that woman was the
[1:21:35] churches of the world but that man was
[1:21:37] the denominations that was ruling her he
[1:21:39] said but notice he said he said if these
[1:21:41] people can't see the truth of the
[1:21:43] godhead but fight it he said can never
[1:21:45] see the rest of the truth because the
[1:21:47] Revelation is Jesus Christ in his church
[1:21:49] and his works in the midst of the church
[1:21:51] for in the seven Church ages he said do
[1:21:53] you get that he said now I'm sure that
[1:21:55] you understand and it goes in the
[1:21:57] scripture thou has a little strength and
[1:22:00] has kept my word and not denied my name
[1:22:03] he said now we have already mentioned
[1:22:05] how the strength was returning he said
[1:22:07] it was the power of the Inquisition had
[1:22:10] Wane and people had left their home
[1:22:13] lands and demanded a freedom of worship
[1:22:15] he said the Yoke of hierarchy was being
[1:22:18] broken the governments were finding it
[1:22:20] was not wise to Champion one segment
[1:22:22] against another in fact well-meaning but
[1:22:25] poorly LED people were willing to wage
[1:22:27] war to defend their religious rights you
[1:22:31] see the age that they were living in
[1:22:33] under the man age they had the abilities
[1:22:35] and they had a tenacity to wage war for
[1:22:39] their religious rights so what were they
[1:22:41] warning against they were warring
[1:22:43] against a society or or a power that was
[1:22:47] wanting to shut down the move of the
[1:22:49] Holy Spirit but notice he said he said
[1:22:51] but perhaps the greatest show of
[1:22:53] strength of the religion in this age was
[1:22:56] the fact that throw though France failed
[1:22:59] in the revolution that the great
[1:23:01] Wesleyan Revival kept the revolution
[1:23:03] away from the Great Britain and saved
[1:23:05] her to be an instrument in the hand of
[1:23:07] God for many glorious years he said the
[1:23:10] preaching of the word was never greater
[1:23:12] as Satan raised up his hordes of free
[1:23:14] thinkers as organ Originators or
[1:23:17] Originators of Communism rose up as
[1:23:20] liberal theologians spread their filthy
[1:23:22] waiters he said but God raised up Mighty
[1:23:25] Warriors of the faith he said the
[1:23:27] greatest works of Christian literature
[1:23:29] and teaching and preaching came from
[1:23:31] this era he said never has it preachers
[1:23:34] and teachers been matched and never will
[1:23:36] they be he said there was spurgeons
[1:23:38] Parkers McLarens Edwards and bunions and
[1:23:40] muellers and brainards and barns and
[1:23:43] Bishops and all came from this era they
[1:23:45] preached and taught and wrote the word
[1:23:46] and they glorified his name so the
[1:23:49] Bibles is telling us of this age that
[1:23:52] their strength returned by keeping the
[1:23:54] word and out of this age came some of
[1:23:57] the greatest preachers that ever has
[1:23:59] been
[1:24:01] they could they as far as theologians
[1:24:04] there's nobody in this age that could
[1:24:06] compare to those men under the anointing
[1:24:09] of the man age so they are the strength
[1:24:12] that they had was because they kept the
[1:24:14] word they preached the word they taught
[1:24:16] the word he said but it did not have the
[1:24:19] open door of power that it ought to have
[1:24:21] had so you can have the abilities to
[1:24:24] preach the word you can have the power
[1:24:25] to preach the word but you do not have
[1:24:27] the demonstration of the word
[1:24:30] so they were they were they had they
[1:24:32] were able to hold men Spellbound Charles
[1:24:35] Finney was able to stand upon upon upon
[1:24:38] a bow and stand out there and preach and
[1:24:41] Men five miles away would drop their
[1:24:43] lunch pails
[1:24:45] and give their heart to the Lord Jesus
[1:24:47] Christ these were men Spurgeon which was
[1:24:50] the prince of peak preachers over 88 000
[1:24:53] sermons
[1:24:54] but they did not have the ability to
[1:24:57] express the power of the word that they
[1:25:00] were preaching he said it was only in a
[1:25:03] few scattered groups they did not have
[1:25:05] the power that was there laying in the
[1:25:07] word but brother Branham when he come to
[1:25:10] the seat is not heir to the shuck he
[1:25:12] said but at the opening of The Seven
[1:25:14] Seals of Revelation 10 he said the full
[1:25:17] word is to be born in a manifestation
[1:25:19] again and Vindicated by the spirit of
[1:25:21] God in the full strength as it was when
[1:25:24] he was here on Earth so they didn't have
[1:25:27] the strength that you have because the
[1:25:30] seals were still on the book
[1:25:32] but because the seals were released it
[1:25:35] made you realize that there is no weapon
[1:25:38] that has formed against you shall
[1:25:40] prosper what they had was so great but
[1:25:44] what you have is magnified on top of
[1:25:47] that it's because the anointing of the
[1:25:50] eagle has taken their strength to
[1:25:51] another level
[1:25:55] let me dumb it down for you a little bit
[1:25:57] I'm saying that the strength that you
[1:25:59] need has returned
[1:26:00] I'm saying the power that you need to
[1:26:02] overcome is in the room I'm saying that
[1:26:05] you don't have to live with the devil
[1:26:07] another day
[1:26:13] either we realize what we've got in our
[1:26:15] hand or we let the devil run over top of
[1:26:18] us
[1:26:19] it's time you take the opening of word
[1:26:21] you take that sling and you start
[1:26:23] whirling it into the air break the
[1:26:26] atmosphere break the situation in your
[1:26:28] life
[1:26:30] come on now you got family members that
[1:26:33] are constantly dealing with the same
[1:26:34] thing if you're still circling the same
[1:26:36] Mountain it's time that you move on
[1:26:39] if you're in the same spot that you was
[1:26:41] five years ago it tells me something
[1:26:43] about your spiritual life
[1:26:50] but I want you to know that there's
[1:26:52] ground for you to take
[1:26:54] there's an anointing here to make sure
[1:26:56] that if you take one step I am with you
[1:26:59] that I'll never leave you and I'll never
[1:27:01] forsake you I will be with you even in
[1:27:03] you to the end of the world it doesn't
[1:27:05] matter what the opposition you face
[1:27:06] David you're more than able to do it
[1:27:13] I'm saying to you that death is on its
[1:27:16] last ride
[1:27:17] when we recognize that when when William
[1:27:19] Branham breaks into the fourth seal and
[1:27:21] he goes in there and he shows us that
[1:27:23] pale horse rider that he's riding out
[1:27:25] there and he comes under the
[1:27:26] conglomeration of all the mixtures of
[1:27:29] the ages we recognize that he was trying
[1:27:32] to hide himself in the first and second
[1:27:34] and third Rider but he comes out boldly
[1:27:36] showing that his name was death in the
[1:27:39] fourth beast but there is a power to
[1:27:42] combat the power of death
[1:27:44] hallelujah what is it it's Isaiah 59 and
[1:27:48] 19 when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:27:51] God raises up a standard death does not
[1:27:54] have a hold on you Church
[1:28:01] you don't know how that makes me feel
[1:28:04] that I can tell my people that death is
[1:28:07] on his last ride
[1:28:08] because you are on another Power
[1:28:11] you're not riding this power to the
[1:28:13] Grave you're not riding this power to a
[1:28:15] bottomless pit you're riding this power
[1:28:17] into a body change
[1:28:23] I'm talking to a people
[1:28:25] that are getting ready to change the
[1:28:28] mentions
[1:28:29] they didn't let nothing stick on them
[1:28:31] they wouldn't magnetize through the
[1:28:33] world they were magnetized to the word
[1:28:37] whoa
[1:28:39] glory to be the god what are you looking
[1:28:41] for this word is our Chariot that take
[1:28:44] us right out of here
[1:28:47] well I'm gonna take a trip on that good
[1:28:51] oh Gospel Ship
[1:28:54] glory to God that's your on your last
[1:28:57] ride but I'm on my ride home
[1:29:01] Hallelujah
[1:29:03] I will not let death reign in my mortal
[1:29:06] bodies I won't let sin reign in my body
[1:29:16] this ain't some Disney fairy tale I'm
[1:29:19] telling you about
[1:29:21] I'm telling you
[1:29:23] that if you let the things of the world
[1:29:25] go God is going to lift you out of this
[1:29:28] whole world he's ain't a packing up time
[1:29:30] when we pack up the world and try to put
[1:29:33] more on WE simply let the things of the
[1:29:36] world go
[1:29:42] Hallelujah it's time
[1:29:48] oh Lord forgive me
[1:29:51] y'all forgive me for the next little bit
[1:29:53] I may not be able to hold myself
[1:29:55] together up here
[1:29:58] what am I saying to you I'm saying that
[1:30:00] Old Devil that's been whispering in your
[1:30:02] ear he woke up for the last time this
[1:30:04] morning that complex his head that
[1:30:07] you're going to deal with fact for the
[1:30:08] rest of your life that you'll never be
[1:30:10] associated with the message of the hour
[1:30:12] today he woke up for the last time well
[1:30:15] he said I ain't going to receive it
[1:30:16] today but somebody here is
[1:30:18] somebody says I'm a David I'm a legend
[1:30:22] of this I'm called to this
[1:30:26] Hallelujah
[1:30:29] Hallelujah
[1:30:31] somebody's gonna break some psychos
[1:30:33] somebody's gonna press the battle
[1:30:37] Hallelujah
[1:30:40] Hallelujah I want you to know that
[1:30:42] there's a reward there's a reward coming
[1:30:44] to you if you fight for this
[1:30:47] God didn't raise somebody that's wimpy
[1:30:49] and don't know how to use a sword he had
[1:30:51] men like Peter Cartwright
[1:30:53] he had men like William Branham he had
[1:30:55] men like Paul he had been like Ron
[1:30:58] Spitzer he had men like Homer Fraser he
[1:31:00] had men like Henry green
[1:31:03] he had men like he had men like us
[1:31:05] standing in this hour
[1:31:09] that they could say
[1:31:11] I must fight if I'm going to reign
[1:31:14] character is a victory
[1:31:18] and if you want Power you better have
[1:31:20] some character with it because character
[1:31:22] power without character is satanic
[1:31:26] there's a lot of people that can feel
[1:31:28] the anointing of the Lord there's a lot
[1:31:30] of people that get under the inspiration
[1:31:31] of it when the Holy Ghost Falls in here
[1:31:33] but they go out and still live the same
[1:31:36] way that they're living in
[1:31:37] but God is looking for a character
[1:31:40] Hallelujah that can walk down into the
[1:31:43] valley of the shadow of death and they
[1:31:45] will fear no evil
[1:31:51] David
[1:31:53] he said what's going to be given to the
[1:31:55] man
[1:31:57] that rolls away the reproach of Israel
[1:32:01] and kills his philistine
[1:32:04] you know that they had gotten such a
[1:32:06] spot that the need and the situation
[1:32:09] that got so desperate that Saul needed
[1:32:12] to offer
[1:32:13] a three-part bride
[1:32:16] he was offering his princess he was
[1:32:19] offering a cash offer and he was
[1:32:21] offering a tax exemption that the man
[1:32:24] that kills this Goliath him and his
[1:32:27] house will be free and always right here
[1:32:29] let me tell you what you get in battling
[1:32:32] this you get the princess you get to
[1:32:34] live free and you get some money with
[1:32:36] the deal
[1:32:38] let me tell you the price is right come
[1:32:39] on down
[1:32:47] what am I saying to you that there's a
[1:32:49] reward for you fighting in this battle
[1:32:52] there's a reward for the god that rolls
[1:32:54] away the reproach of this and David
[1:32:56] recognized that there was a reward there
[1:32:59] and the rest of the men of Israel were
[1:33:01] looking at physical life out there said
[1:33:02] man he's too big for you his brother
[1:33:04] said man what are you doing down here
[1:33:05] uses the rule already old thing he said
[1:33:07] you just come down here to see the
[1:33:09] battle but they didn't recognize that
[1:33:11] David was the one that was getting ready
[1:33:12] to receive the Lord and roll the
[1:33:14] reproach away from Israel
[1:33:17] you see the rest of the world or the
[1:33:19] rest of the Israelites were focused on
[1:33:21] the material things but David was
[1:33:23] focused on the reputation of Israel and
[1:33:26] the honor of his living God because the
[1:33:28] Bible said that David was a man after
[1:33:31] God's Own Heart he cared about the
[1:33:34] things that God cared about
[1:33:38] you see he saw the problem in spiritual
[1:33:40] terms not in fleshly terms when the men
[1:33:43] of Israel said said this man David said
[1:33:47] this uncircumcised Philistine he
[1:33:50] recognized him as more than just a man
[1:33:52] but he recognized him as an enemy to the
[1:33:55] Covenant when the men of Israel said
[1:33:57] surely he has come up to defy Israel
[1:33:59] David said that he should defy the
[1:34:01] armies of the Living God when the men of
[1:34:03] Israel said the man who kills him David
[1:34:06] said the man who kills this Philistine
[1:34:08] he put his name where he was he
[1:34:11] identified him he didn't baby him around
[1:34:13] he simply identified the problem
[1:34:17] the man that kills this Philistine and
[1:34:20] takes away the reproach from Israel so
[1:34:23] David was looking at things through the
[1:34:26] eyes or the perspective of almighty God
[1:34:30] the only way
[1:34:32] to silence The Voice
[1:34:35] is to cut his head off
[1:34:40] both these champions
[1:34:42] and screamed
[1:34:44] 40 days
[1:34:46] and four thousand years
[1:34:49] foreign
[1:34:50] but you got to take his head off
[1:34:52] you say well I'm not strong enough and
[1:34:54] I'm not good enough I'm not big enough
[1:34:55] let me tell you you just simply put the
[1:34:57] word before you
[1:34:59] and the enemy will fall you've got
[1:35:02] example after example in the Bible but
[1:35:03] the Bible tells us in first Samuel 5
[1:35:05] that when they took the Ark of the
[1:35:07] Covenant and put it in the temple of
[1:35:09] Dagen that they put it up there and they
[1:35:11] were trying the Philistines were trying
[1:35:12] to hide it from the children of Israel
[1:35:14] and David and all of Israel back there
[1:35:16] they were trying to hide it back there
[1:35:18] that they stuck it in there in the house
[1:35:20] of Deacon and when they put the ark
[1:35:23] before Dagen that they that that day can
[1:35:25] fell before his face so they stood Degen
[1:35:28] back up they stuck him back up there but
[1:35:30] when they put the ark back in his
[1:35:32] rightful position or when the ark was
[1:35:33] there they put Dagen back up there but
[1:35:36] this time when they came in in the
[1:35:37] morning Dagan's head and his palms had
[1:35:40] completely fell off so it is assigned to
[1:35:43] you that your enemy that you are facing
[1:35:45] does not have a head and it does not
[1:35:48] have hands to bind you
[1:35:52] oh come on now buckle up it's time to
[1:35:56] take some heads off
[1:35:59] and the Bible said in verse 43 that the
[1:36:02] Philistine said unto David am I a dog
[1:36:05] that thou cometh to me will stays and
[1:36:07] the Philistine cursed David by his gods
[1:36:10] now you know David must have thought
[1:36:11] that was real cute
[1:36:14] here he is
[1:36:16] David
[1:36:17] is serving the god that is the god of
[1:36:19] Heaven he created worlds with his words
[1:36:22] serving a God that took men over the Red
[1:36:25] Sea when there was an enemy that was
[1:36:27] chasing them down
[1:36:29] he knows who he's talking about but here
[1:36:31] this awful listening comes out there 700
[1:36:33] pounds in his natural flesh got 200
[1:36:36] pounds of armor upon him and he starts
[1:36:38] cursing him by his Gods can you imagine
[1:36:40] Goliath carrying his little out there
[1:36:43] with him
[1:36:44] dusting it off in the morning
[1:36:48] today is going to be a good day I'm
[1:36:50] going to curse David by my little Idols
[1:36:52] let me tell you something I ain't got to
[1:36:54] carry my God my God carries me
[1:36:59] and this old giant starts cursing the
[1:37:02] family of God by his little gods
[1:37:05] and the Philistine said to David come to
[1:37:07] me and I will give thy flesh unto the
[1:37:09] fowls of the air and to the beasts of
[1:37:11] the fields so what is he saying brother
[1:37:13] random said that he was going to take
[1:37:15] that Spear and pick David up and put him
[1:37:18] up there on that tree so that the birds
[1:37:20] could come and pick on him
[1:37:22] foreign
[1:37:28] where's that one that little Griffith
[1:37:30] boy he said it's a beautiful day
[1:37:33] it's a beautiful day
[1:37:37] oh my it's a beautiful day
[1:37:41] hey
[1:37:49] y'all enjoying y'all's Jesus
[1:38:00] I know you're in a valley
[1:38:04] but if you can trust me for a minute
[1:38:09] you're gonna come out
[1:38:14] David
[1:38:15] says to him
[1:38:17] you meet me as a Philistine in the name
[1:38:20] of the Philistine with an armor with a
[1:38:22] spear and all your psychology and
[1:38:24] Theology and everything else that you
[1:38:25] got there
[1:38:26] but David said thou cometh to me with a
[1:38:29] sword and with a spear and with a shield
[1:38:31] but I come to thee in the name of the
[1:38:34] Lord of hosts the god of the armies of
[1:38:37] Israel whom now has defied this day I'm
[1:38:41] not waiting till tomorrow I'm not
[1:38:43] waiting till next week I'm not waiting
[1:38:45] till the next prayer line I'm not
[1:38:46] waiting to the next Revival but this
[1:38:48] state where the Lord delivereth thee
[1:38:51] into my hand and I will smite thee and
[1:38:54] take thy head from thee and I will give
[1:38:56] the carcasses of the host of the
[1:38:58] Philistines this day unto the fowls of
[1:39:00] the air so David recognized what was
[1:39:03] David doing he was prophesying he didn't
[1:39:06] just say you he said but all of the
[1:39:09] Philistines
[1:39:11] I'm gonna give their carcasses to the
[1:39:13] fowls of the air into the wild beasts of
[1:39:15] the Earth at that the all the Earth
[1:39:17] might know that there were a God in
[1:39:21] Israel and all
[1:39:24] verse 47 and all this assembly shall
[1:39:27] know that the Lord's saveth not with
[1:39:30] sword and spear for the battle is the
[1:39:33] Lord's and he will give you into our
[1:39:35] hands
[1:39:37] brother Branham said he knew where he
[1:39:39] was Hallelujah every day that's sitting
[1:39:41] here tonight you're positionally in
[1:39:43] Christ Jesus God has confirmed it
[1:39:45] election calling anointing placing he
[1:39:48] elected you and called you he elected
[1:39:50] you called you then anointed you with
[1:39:52] the Holy Spirit and now he's placed you
[1:39:54] in the body of Christ each one of you's
[1:39:56] Davids where's that Goliath who's the
[1:39:59] Goliath brother Branham he said that
[1:40:01] cancer that's eating you up that tumor
[1:40:03] that's hanging on you them cataracts on
[1:40:05] your eyes that crippled arm everything
[1:40:08] looks as it says it can't be done the
[1:40:10] devil says you might as well quit
[1:40:12] believing you might as well settle down
[1:40:14] because you can never no more get well

[1:40:18] world all the rest of them said so you
[1:40:21] can't get well
[1:40:22] but the Christ that made you stop your
[1:40:25] drinking made you stop your smoking and
[1:40:27] lying and stealing that saved you from a
[1:40:29] life of drunkenness from riling and from
[1:40:31] sin in the devil's grave if God can do
[1:40:34] that for you
[1:40:37] if God can do that for you he can save
[1:40:40] you from your TB from your cancer he's a
[1:40:43] Goliath but don't take his voice stand
[1:40:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus and
[1:40:48] challenge him to a showdown amen
[1:40:50] hallelujah
[1:40:54] the Bible didn't say that David ran for
[1:40:57] cover the Bible said that David hastened
[1:40:59] himself and he ran towards the battle he
[1:41:02] ran to meet the armies
[1:41:06] come on I'm looking for a giant to stand
[1:41:09] up today because I got a rock that's got

[1:43:42] you got enough power
[1:43:45] to do the impossible
[1:43:55] what are you looking at I caught a
[1:43:57] glimpse of my victory
[1:44:06] and Jesus on the cross
[1:44:10] looking through the blood
[1:44:13] reeling in his body
[1:44:16] pain and misery
[1:44:18] start seeing
[1:44:20] a little Challenger
[1:44:24] start buzzing around
[1:44:27] days of Miracles have passed
[1:44:32] I got able I got Daniel I got David I
[1:44:37] made all them fall and I'm getting ready
[1:44:39] to take you
[1:44:40] and Jesus is hanging there
[1:44:43] looking through the blood as he sees the
[1:44:46] sting of death as he's kind of floating
[1:44:47] around there
[1:44:49] and he said I've been looking for you
[1:44:52] for a long time
[1:45:16] there's one that has antagonized you
[1:45:19] this one that's whispered in your ears
[1:45:22] of depression
[1:45:24] of anxiety
[1:45:26] pains in your body
[1:45:33] Jesus ain't looking out there and seeing
[1:45:36] a champion
[1:45:38] he's looking out there and seeing his
[1:45:40] victory
[1:45:42] I have looked for you for all of these
[1:45:45] ages but now in my flesh
[1:45:49] you see this bee had came and he had
[1:45:52] stunned David and it took him to the
[1:45:54] Grave it had stunned Daniel and it took
[1:45:56] him to the grave and it stung Abraham
[1:45:58] and it took him to the Grave it stung
[1:46:01] Adam and it took him to the grave but
[1:46:03] this body was a prepared body it was a
[1:46:07] virgin born body

[1:46:52] you see them 2 000 years from now
[1:46:55] I'm doing this for them
[1:46:58] so that they recognize that there is an
[1:47:01] opening of the word that they have
[1:47:03] received more than just an Acts 2
[1:47:05] anointing but in Revelations 10 I only
[1:47:07] tell you
[1:47:12] David
[1:47:15] you're down in the valley you might as
[1:47:16] well go ahead and do it
[1:47:21] brother Byron said that he went down
[1:47:22] there
[1:47:23] and he grabbed five
[1:47:26] of them stoned and he wrapped them up in
[1:47:29] his fingers
[1:47:31] in one place brother random said that he
[1:47:32] stuck those stones down in the script
[1:47:35] bag
[1:47:37] that he was using for a sheep he said
[1:47:39] when he pulled him out he said they was
[1:47:41] full of honey
[1:47:43] what is it is honey on the rock
[1:47:49] and he starts whirling out there
[1:47:52] I practiced for this I prayed about this
[1:47:55] I spent time alone with almighty God
[1:47:58] I've been in prayer I've been in prayer
[1:48:01] and it feels like the burdens ain't
[1:48:03] going to leave me but I just kept on
[1:48:04] praying
[1:48:06] it felt like I was never going to get
[1:48:08] the Holy Ghost how about I kept on
[1:48:10] praying
[1:48:12] it didn't look like this one was coming
[1:48:14] but I kept on praying
[1:48:16] and I just kept slinging my sling of
[1:48:19] faith and I knew what I had in it and I
[1:48:22] kept praying
[1:48:34] brother said
[1:48:37] I just kept praying
[1:48:41] and I just kept believing
[1:48:44] and brother Bynum said that when you get
[1:48:46] that when you get that pollination of
[1:48:48] Faith put on there and all of a sudden
[1:48:50] you begin to whirl those things together
[1:48:52] brother Bynum said that the Holy Ghost
[1:48:54] got into that slingshot
[1:48:59] I can't do it I'm not big enough I'm not
[1:49:01] good enough but I kept praying but the
[1:49:04] Holy Ghost got in that slingshot

[1:54:39] [Applause]
[1:54:47] that David
[1:54:51] placed Goliath's head upon that spear
[1:54:57] now I got a phrase from my buddy brother
[1:54:59] Timothy Pruitt
[1:55:02] he told me to school drag that devil
[1:55:06] but brother Timothy and some brothers
[1:55:07] were over there in Israel while back
[1:55:12] and they were over there and they were
[1:55:13] down in that Valley of Eli
[1:55:20] they were down here in that Valley
[1:55:23] and they took him up to a spot and said
[1:55:24] it seemed like it was just an ordinary
[1:55:26] spot no really no markers around it or
[1:55:28] whatever
[1:55:30] but they said this is the place
[1:55:32] where they hung a life's head
[1:55:35] it was a major Crossway
[1:55:38] it is known as the place of the school
[1:55:42] and where did Jesus hang death but on
[1:55:46] thou gotha's Hill the place of the
[1:55:49] school so Jesus Took death all the way
[1:55:53] up to the same place that Goliath's head
[1:55:56] hung upon so this champion
[1:56:00] lost when he fought David and this
[1:56:03] Champion lost when he fought Christ it
[1:56:05] was in the same spot
[1:56:09] I'm going to tell you young people
[1:56:10] you're in the same spot that your Mamas
[1:56:12] and your daddy's got the Holy Ghost
[1:56:13] you're in the same spot where they got
[1:56:15] healed you're in the same spot and we're
[1:56:18] serving that God says the same yesterday
[1:56:19] today and forever
[1:56:22] this ain't some just ordinary ordinary
[1:56:25] walkway but this is a major Junction in
[1:56:28] a place where everybody that was
[1:56:30] traveling by they seen the head of that
[1:56:33] Goliath
[1:56:35] that everybody knew that there was a God
[1:56:38] in Israel
[1:56:40] I want to hang the head of cancer so
[1:56:43] high
[1:56:44] that all the world sees that he's the
[1:56:46] god that heals Ron Spencer
[1:56:49] [Applause]
[1:57:15] you're at a junction
[1:57:18] you're at a moment
[1:57:22] um told us
[1:57:24] when he preached the junction of time
[1:57:27] he said
[1:57:29] these things happen when we're at a
[1:57:32] junction
[1:57:34] Angels appear
[1:57:36] Miracles return profits arise
[1:57:40] he said you see carnal impersonations
[1:57:42] out there don't you get worried about
[1:57:43] them Cardinal and person haters
[1:57:46] they're supposed to be there
[1:57:49] but what about this and what about that
[1:57:51] don't get your eyes on them
[1:57:53] look at the angels that are here look at
[1:57:56] the prophets that is here look at the
[1:57:58] supernatural that is here
[1:58:05] it shows to you
[1:58:09] that you're in a spot where Goliath's
[1:58:11] head is hung so high
[1:58:18] whether Andrew I fought these things in
[1:58:20] my flesh
[1:58:23] I've been wrong
[1:58:26] I've hurt others
[1:58:28] I've had hard words towards my wife or
[1:58:31] towards my husband
[1:58:34] I gave up on God
[1:58:40] upon you
[1:58:46] what am I saying to you
[1:58:48] that Jesus defeated death
[1:58:54] it's a sign
[1:58:56] of the spiritual
[1:59:02] but he keeps buzzing around me
[1:59:05] I got these things
[1:59:09] I got these things that I can't overcome
[1:59:11] my own
[1:59:16] that dude that's buzzing around you
[1:59:19] I want you to remind him he ain't got a
[1:59:21] stinger
[1:59:23] because the greatest punch that Satan
[1:59:26] has is death every demon in all of him
[1:59:31] is underneath the death depression is
[1:59:34] Underneath Him anxiety is underneath of
[1:59:37] him oppression and sin and cancer and
[1:59:39] every TB and every disease is underneath
[1:59:42] a death so that when Jesus defeated
[1:59:44] death two thousand years ago every demon
[1:59:48] is underneath the feet of the pride of
[1:59:51] Jesus Christ and the God of Peace shall
[1:59:54] bruise Satan under your feet shortly
[1:59:58] every devil is under the feet of the
[2:00:01] body of Jesus Christ if I was you I'd
[2:00:04] have myself a dancing party David
[2:00:07] it's time to wake dance on top of this
[2:00:10] devil
[2:00:15] taken back
[2:00:16] and back everything
[2:00:23] oh come on now
[2:00:25] oh Goliath he stood so tall but little
[2:00:28] David he was all so small
[2:00:30] but David said the battle's not mine The
[2:00:33] Battle Belongs to the Lords and as long
[2:00:36] as you know that you are fighting
[2:00:38] against an enemy that does not have a
[2:00:41] stinger you're fighting against an enemy
[2:00:43] that cannot win
[2:00:47] let him lie let him whisper let him tell
[2:00:49] all kinds of things it ain't nothing but
[2:00:51] a bluff but brother Branham said that
[2:00:53] you're made out of stuff that does not
