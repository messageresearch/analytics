[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] so
[0:18] [Music]
[0:24] i've got a little slogan that i'll say
[0:27] it quite a bit
[0:29] it might be good for you to take it
[0:32] a winner never quits and a quitter never
[0:36] wins
[0:38] just think of it a winner
[0:41] never quits and a quitter can't win
[0:46] you must hold on and before you even
[0:50] start
[0:50] be dead sure you're right and then be
[0:54] persistent let nothing move you
[0:56] go on i've had quite a bit of experience
[0:59] of that and you know what
[1:01] i know this one thing when you're dead
[1:04] sure that you're in the will of god
[1:06] when you're dead sure you're centered in
[1:08] calvary
[1:09] nothing's going to move you you're there
[1:14] this little woman she was a greek
[1:18] and a serpeology
[1:21] and she had heard about the fame of
[1:24] jesus
[1:25] how does faith come by hearing
[1:28] hearing of the word she had heard of him
[1:31] and
[1:33] you know she might have had a lot of
[1:36] things to hinder
[1:38] by her being a greek faith cometh by
[1:40] hearing we know that
[1:42] and she had a a lot of things to hinder
[1:44] her
[1:45] but faith finds a source
[1:50] no other knows anything about faith
[1:53] finds this source
[1:56] that no one can explain it it's
[1:58] something that you
[1:59] know others can't see it but faith sees
[2:02] it
[2:04] faith sees that where the natural eye
[2:06] doesn't see it
[2:07] but the inside eye sees that thing
[2:11] now she had a need of jesus she first
[2:14] thing you have to do if you're going to
[2:15] find christ
[2:16] you've got to know that you've got a
[2:18] need of him when you think that you just
[2:21] don't need him then you'll never find
[2:23] him because you
[2:24] won't search him diligently
[2:28] did you notice that scripture where it
[2:30] says seek and you shall find
[2:33] knock and it'll be open actually that's
[2:36] just not
[2:36] knock like it'll be open
[2:40] e that's not you say well i went out
[2:43] lord here i am you want me
[2:45] no that's not it he that seeketh
[2:48] he that knocketh continuation
[2:52] it has to compare with the rest of
[2:54] scripture like the unjust judge
[2:56] and the widow she constantly knocked on
[3:00] his door
[3:01] she was persistent if he turned her away
[3:04] today to marshes
[3:05] on his hands again that's the way you
[3:08] want to get god
[3:09] be on his hands every morning every
[3:11] night every day all the time
[3:13] constantly just keep seeking keep asking
[3:16] keep knocking
[3:17] just don't knock a little while get
[3:19] tired and go away just
[3:20] keep standing there god i'm here
[3:24] and i'm not going to leave i'm on your
[3:26] hands now
[3:28] i'm going to stay right here getting
[3:30] tired listen i'm having a great time
[3:32] knocking going on oh you're coming
[3:36] that's when something happens yes get
[3:38] you off of his hands
[3:40] so he comes out to answer you

[1:00:19] heaven
[1:00:20] and a new earth
[1:00:23] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:00:26] were passed away

[1:02:08] hallelujah and he said unto me write for
[1:02:11] these words are true
[1:02:13] and faithful and he said unto me
[1:02:17] it is done i am alpha and omega the
[1:02:20] beginning and the
[1:02:21] end and i will give unto him that is a
[1:02:24] thirst of the fountain
[1:02:26] of water of life freely
[1:02:30] and he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:02:33] things
[1:02:34] and i will be his god and they will be
[1:02:37] my people amen amen
[1:02:43] and he shall be my son amen
[1:02:46] saint john chapter 1 and verse 1.
[1:02:51] in the beginning was the word
[1:02:54] and the word was with god and the word
[1:02:56] was god
[1:02:59] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:03:01] and all things were
[1:03:02] made by him and without him was not
[1:03:04] anything
[1:03:05] made that was made
[1:03:09] in him was life and the life was the
[1:03:12] light of men
[1:03:14] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:03:16] the darkness
[1:03:18] comprehendeth it not i want to read one
[1:03:21] more scripture this morning
[1:03:23] before we before we take our seats
[1:03:26] in jeremiah chapter 1 and verse 4 and i
[1:03:29] want to wait
[1:03:30] i want to wait till it's up on the
[1:03:32] screen if we can do that
[1:03:34] or here quick the word of the lord
[1:03:38] came unto me saying
[1:03:41] before i form thee in the belly
[1:03:44] i knew thee
[1:03:53] before i formed thee in the belly
[1:03:56] i knew thee you can be seated
[1:04:09] regardless of which aisle the politics
[1:04:11] that you stand
[1:04:12] this morning i want you to kind of begin
[1:04:15] to get a grips that we understand that
[1:04:18] there's coming a new world
[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:24] things are not going to always be as
[1:04:25] they are now
[1:04:27] jesus said this 2000 years ago
[1:04:32] and we are at the time of the coming of
[1:04:34] the end of the gentile dispensation
[1:04:37] we can see that we're at the end of this
[1:04:40] we you can't vote your way out of the
[1:04:43] problems of
[1:04:44] life uh there's many things that we
[1:04:47] could say right there
[1:04:49] but there's coming a new world
[1:04:54] jesus made a statement to his very
[1:04:57] close disciples let not your heart be
[1:05:00] troubled
[1:05:02] and he began to tell him of a of another
[1:05:04] realm to where that i go to prepare a
[1:05:07] place for you
[1:05:09] now i i was just reading i was reading
[1:05:12] this week
[1:05:15] in my my morning devotions
[1:05:18] and it was there was just a little a
[1:05:21] little piece
[1:05:22] that was there when you die
[1:05:25] you're going to a place
[1:05:29] you're going to a place it's not an
[1:05:32] illusion it's not some man's figment of
[1:05:35] imagination
[1:05:36] god has prepared a place for us
[1:05:41] are you with me now there'll be no more
[1:05:44] sorrow no more tears no more
[1:05:46] agony he's the he's got a place for us
[1:05:49] set aside
[1:05:51] and it's a brother branham would use the
[1:05:53] term future home
[1:05:56] now this home is a very temporary home
[1:05:59] regardless of the size that you live in
[1:06:02] from small to large it's only temporary
[1:06:07] are you with me but let me just say even
[1:06:10] our bodies are temporary
[1:06:14] are you with me but if we could just
[1:06:17] think
[1:06:18] maybe we look at our birthdays and we
[1:06:21] celebrate our
[1:06:21] birthdays and we mark the years on the
[1:06:24] calendar
[1:06:25] and especially as you get older you're
[1:06:27] thankful to see another birthday
[1:06:30] and i was very happy to see a birthday
[1:06:32] this year
[1:06:33] and i i trust i can see another one and
[1:06:37] and i was asked the other day how long
[1:06:40] do you want to live well that's a kind
[1:06:42] of an open end conversation
[1:06:46] we'd like to know how to treat you how
[1:06:48] long you want to live
[1:06:49] well they're they're saying we can only
[1:06:51] extend your life bo
[1:06:53] well i got a book here that has a cure
[1:07:06] now there was a time that i was in my
[1:07:08] father
[1:07:10] and there was a time that i was in my
[1:07:12] grandfather
[1:07:14] and there was a time that i was in my
[1:07:15] great-grandfather
[1:07:17] i'm not going to go too much longer and
[1:07:19] i was time i was in my
[1:07:20] great-great-grandfather
[1:07:23] there was a time that i was in adam
[1:07:28] and there was a time that i was in god
[1:07:34] and god thought of us before the
[1:07:36] foundation of the world
[1:07:39] and that seed is what makes us
[1:07:42] eternal with god
[1:07:46] now we have an enemy and that enemy is
[1:07:49] lucifer and lucifer is the
[1:07:52] anti-type of god god built
[1:07:56] him god created his own enemy
[1:08:01] he is the opposite of god
[1:08:06] he's the opposite of love
[1:08:10] love in many forms he's the opposite of
[1:08:14] all of that
[1:08:15] he is the opposite of light
[1:08:21] are you with me he's the very opposite
[1:08:24] of it
[1:08:25] he is the opposite of faith
[1:08:32] he's the very opposite of all of that as
[1:08:35] a matter of fact
[1:08:36] god built an enemy to which
[1:08:39] that knows and can read the book the
[1:08:41] same as you and i
[1:08:43] and finds that he will come to a point
[1:08:45] he's no more
[1:08:48] but yet he can fight
[1:08:54] like he's got eternal life
[1:08:57] but you and i can read the book
[1:09:01] and we were in the beginning and we were
[1:09:05] before the beginning
[1:09:07] and we were in the mind of god i knew
[1:09:10] you before you were even
[1:09:12] formed in the womb jacob and esau he
[1:09:16] knew which one
[1:09:20] you with me he knew what you would be
[1:09:23] he predestinated you when
[1:09:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:29] remember you're dealing with an
[1:09:30] infinite god and so when the devil tells
[1:09:35] you you're
[1:09:36] nothing remind him
[1:09:39] you remind him that god thought of me
[1:09:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:09:48] it does not require me to have 15 phd
[1:09:52] degrees to be a son or daughter of god
[1:09:57] are you with me it doesn't matter what
[1:09:59] my natural
[1:10:00] job is where my natural home is
[1:10:03] i've got a seed laying on the inside of
[1:10:06] me
[1:10:08] oh glory to god we have some
[1:10:17] students that are watching even now
[1:10:20] that are that are from japan
[1:10:24] from different countries from portugal
[1:10:27] different
[1:10:28] different places i can't actually even
[1:10:30] go into it where they're at and they're
[1:10:32] watching
[1:10:33] they're watching from colleges and
[1:10:37] and let me just say god knows how to
[1:10:39] find you
[1:10:42] he knows how to go and get you i was
[1:10:45] preaching in alaska one time and
[1:10:48] as i was preaching actually in a
[1:10:50] catholic
[1:10:51] in a catholic camp and these brothers
[1:10:54] have rented to camp and come together
[1:10:55] and i was preaching in this camp
[1:10:58] and i was just preaching on god knows
[1:11:00] how to find you
[1:11:01] god knows how to watch over you god
[1:11:03] knows how to come and get you
[1:11:06] and i was going i said you might be a
[1:11:09] wall from the army
[1:11:11] and running and thinking nobody knows
[1:11:14] where you're from
[1:11:15] or where you're at and you're hiding
[1:11:17] from everybody
[1:11:19] but god knows exactly where you're at
[1:11:22] and there was a man sitting almost a
[1:11:24] mile away in a green pickup truck
[1:11:28] and he was awol from the army
[1:11:32] and he said i might as well go up there
[1:11:34] and listen to that man
[1:11:36] god knows where i'm at
[1:11:40] and what was the interesting thing is
[1:11:42] that man was from covington virginia
[1:11:48] and god had me in alaska preaching to
[1:11:51] find a seed from covent in virginia
[1:11:59] now let me just think just for a few
[1:12:00] moments brother brennan brings us a
[1:12:03] representation
[1:12:04] we've got farmers here that you already
[1:12:06] know this but
[1:12:07] sometimes we need to be reminded but in
[1:12:10] every
[1:12:11] seed release let me say it
[1:12:14] diplomatically in every seed release
[1:12:18] there's like a million seeds of life
[1:12:21] that is released into the womb
[1:12:24] one is predestinated
[1:12:27] to life
[1:12:31] one is predestinated to life
[1:12:35] and that one has got something on the
[1:12:38] inside of
[1:12:39] it that will
[1:12:43] overcome all of the death traps
[1:12:48] and it will find that seed or that egg
[1:12:51] and it'll come to life now you think all
[1:12:55] the way since
[1:12:56] adam
[1:13:00] of one seed production
[1:13:05] 9999 and you can keep saying all the
[1:13:08] nines
[1:13:08] they all died but one was predestinated
[1:13:12] to life
[1:13:14] all the way to the generations back
[1:13:21] come on church and god knew what color
[1:13:25] hair you'd have
[1:13:26] he knew how tall you'd be he knew what
[1:13:29] your weight
[1:13:29] would be like he knew what your nature
[1:13:32] would be
[1:13:33] he knew who your father and mother would
[1:13:35] be all the way through the generations
[1:13:38] because remember it's in the book
[1:13:44] it's in the book sister kim said it's in
[1:13:48] the book
[1:13:49] god knew you would be sitting here this
[1:13:52] morning
[1:13:53] so he has to watch over your seat
[1:13:58] all the way down your natural seed he
[1:14:01] has to watch over that
[1:14:04] an infinite god watches over that
[1:14:07] natural seed all the way through
[1:14:11] and here's what i want to say and satan
[1:14:14] can't stop it
[1:14:24] now here's what i want to say to you now
[1:14:27] i know
[1:14:28] many of you are having great difficulty
[1:14:30] even
[1:14:31] in your natural life now but if god
[1:14:34] could get you here
[1:14:40] if god could get you here he's more than
[1:14:43] able
[1:14:44] to get you there
[1:14:53] he watched over your your natural seed
[1:14:55] through
[1:14:56] through natural disasters through moving
[1:15:00] from one country to another country
[1:15:03] through wars through plagues
[1:15:07] through death camps
[1:15:15] he literally tried to destroy
[1:15:17] generations
[1:15:19] to destroy you
[1:15:22] he destroyed marriages he destroyed all
[1:15:25] different kinds of relationships
[1:15:28] trying to get to destroy you
[1:15:31] but god that is rich in his mercy
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:51] hallelujah you're better protected than
[1:15:54] the president
[1:15:55] of the united states of america
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:05] psalms 91 says that you're encamped
[1:16:08] about
[1:16:09] with angels
[1:16:13] angels are guarding that seed
[1:16:20] i'd like for you to get your eyes off of
[1:16:22] your natural flaws
[1:16:25] i'd like for you to get your eyes off of
[1:16:27] your natural
[1:16:28] cockle barrel nature i'd like for you to
[1:16:32] get your eyes off of your
[1:16:34] excuses for just enough time to realize
[1:16:38] it's not your flesh
[1:16:42] that we're depending on or your feelings
[1:16:46] or you're up and down relationships of
[1:16:50] with your even your own self but god is
[1:16:53] depending on the seed
[1:16:55] that he deposited on the inside of you
[1:17:02] that thing that causes you to be driven
[1:17:08] when you would personally give up
[1:17:11] god put something on the inside of you
[1:17:15] that you're driven
[1:17:20] you're driven and there's no going back
[1:17:24] there's no quitting
[1:17:31] hallelujah you're not depending on your
[1:17:35] brother
[1:17:35] or your sister or your mother or anybody
[1:17:40] else you're dependent on god and god's
[1:17:44] made a promise
[1:17:46] i'll see you through
[1:17:58] glory to god
[1:18:14] there's a nation
[1:18:18] that almost every nation in the world
[1:18:20] has turned against and hates
[1:18:23] who put that hatred there
[1:18:27] but god chose that nation
[1:18:31] it's a little bitty nation and they have
[1:18:34] to fight
[1:18:35] for their for their identity
[1:18:39] every day they have to be
[1:18:43] willing to sacrifice it all every day
[1:18:47] they know that if they get in a war
[1:18:49] their enemies is wanting to exterminate
[1:18:52] them
[1:18:54] because they've been through it before
[1:18:57] at isolates
[1:18:58] they were there listen hitler wanted to
[1:19:01] extinguish them
[1:19:04] and destroy them and wipe them off of
[1:19:06] the face of the earth
[1:19:09] that's what satan wants to do to god's
[1:19:11] seed
[1:19:14] that's why he fights you so hard
[1:19:23] why do you think he's fighting me so
[1:19:25] hard
[1:19:30] why do you think he's fighting me so
[1:19:31] hard
[1:19:34] he'd love to he'd love to take my life
[1:19:39] as i got back in bed last night and i
[1:19:41] put my head on the pillow
[1:19:43] i told connie i said it just shows you
[1:19:47] another time
[1:19:49] he'd love to take my life
[1:19:54] but he don't have enough
[1:20:16] uh
[1:20:18] god had a conversation with abraham
[1:20:22] and he had a conversation with him
[1:20:23] lipped it here
[1:20:28] and remember god's an eternal god
[1:20:32] infinite god and he's sitting at a tent
[1:20:37] you and i don't know what size tent that
[1:20:39] was
[1:20:40] it don't matter we don't know
[1:20:43] maybe even the exact location it don't
[1:20:46] matter
[1:20:48] but an infinite god
[1:20:53] picked up the elements of the earth
[1:20:58] and blew himself a body and stepped into
[1:21:02] it
[1:21:05] now maybe he didn't describe it to all
[1:21:07] the angels what i'm doing today
[1:21:15] he didn't have to tell him that but he's
[1:21:18] going to have a conversation with
[1:21:20] abraham
[1:21:22] who is the father of the faith
[1:21:26] he is the beginning of god race
[1:21:31] he is a man that god is going to use
[1:21:35] to be the natural seed of a father
[1:21:38] of many nations
[1:21:43] but he's childless
[1:21:46] it's impossible for him to have children
[1:21:50] god loves impossibilities
[1:21:54] and so today
[1:21:58] melchizedek visits abraham
[1:22:04] and so in the visiting of abraham
[1:22:09] he begins to talk to him about
[1:22:12] seed that would be
[1:22:19] all right are you with me now seed
[1:22:23] that would be now
[1:22:27] let's just say that this is a a family
[1:22:31] photo album
[1:22:35] now abraham is here
[1:22:40] in genesis 15 through about
[1:22:43] 24 and abraham is is is here
[1:22:46] in this first photo
[1:22:50] and he can't see even that he's going to
[1:22:52] have natural seed
[1:22:54] but he believes
[1:22:58] but abra melchizedek is sitting in front
[1:23:01] of him
[1:23:02] and he's looking into the eyes of god
[1:23:04] himself
[1:23:07] that is the alpha and the omega
[1:23:11] and god knows the rest of the book
[1:23:15] and in the rest of the book you're here
[1:23:22] no kings were sitting there or
[1:23:25] ambassadors or great orchestras playing
[1:23:28] it was god and the father
[1:23:32] of nations who could not produce seed
[1:23:36] even on his own
[1:23:37] through sarah
[1:23:40] but god that was sitting there
[1:23:44] talking to those talking about those
[1:23:47] seeds
[1:23:51] knew that they were on the way
[1:23:54] and he was not only knowing they were on
[1:23:56] the way
[1:23:57] but he was the protector
[1:24:01] a placing you to be on the way
[1:24:09] are you with me now
[1:24:13] now god begins to tell
[1:24:16] abraham that your seed is going to
[1:24:19] sojourn in a land
[1:24:21] in egypt and they're going to go there
[1:24:26] but after 400 years and he begins to
[1:24:28] talk to him about how it's going to lay
[1:24:30] out
[1:24:31] he talks up to him about sodom and
[1:24:34] gomorrah
[1:24:35] how they're going to be destroyed
[1:24:38] he talks to him about the children going
[1:24:40] to egypt
[1:24:42] and i'm going to visit them now now
[1:24:45] understand this
[1:24:47] abraham cannot absorb everything that
[1:24:50] god's staying doing
[1:24:51] you know sometimes people go well i know
[1:24:54] all about the bible i know all about god
[1:24:57] you and your paper ain't mind amen
[1:25:00] you can't comprehend sometimes what
[1:25:03] color pants to put on
[1:25:10] i'm gonna bring you back to reality just
[1:25:11] for a moment oh i know all about the
[1:25:14] bible
[1:25:15] you're a nut
[1:25:21] you're just a knot
[1:25:25] if god don't show it to you you're lost
[1:25:33] you're just you're just you're just
[1:25:35] going your own way
[1:25:37] but god rich in mercy so happened to
[1:25:40] choose
[1:25:41] that you'd be a part of all of this
[1:25:53] let me just tell you a children's story
[1:25:55] there's a boy grew up and as he's
[1:25:57] growing up he dreams dreams
[1:25:59] and as he's dreaming dreams he tells his
[1:26:01] brother said
[1:26:02] you'll bow down and worship me well that
[1:26:04] went well
[1:26:07] and they they sold him off into slavery
[1:26:11] and he goes over into this strange land
[1:26:15] and he goes to prison for quite a while
[1:26:18] and there's a there's a butler and a
[1:26:20] baker
[1:26:21] you're getting the story and then this
[1:26:24] man becomes the
[1:26:26] the right hand man to pharaoh
[1:26:32] and his name's going to be joseph
[1:26:35] because he was in the book
[1:26:42] he was there when abraham
[1:26:46] was talking to melchizedek in
[1:26:48] melchizedek's mind
[1:26:50] joseph was there
[1:26:53] i find it interesting that when joseph
[1:26:55] gets ready to die
[1:26:57] he said don't you bury my bones down
[1:26:59] here
[1:27:02] don't you bury my bones down here in
[1:27:04] egypt
[1:27:05] you carry my bones into the promised
[1:27:09] land
[1:27:13] are you with me for 400 years there was
[1:27:16] a lead coffin
[1:27:17] with with joseph's bones inside of it
[1:27:20] and you say what's important about that
[1:27:22] one day jesus will be in the promised
[1:27:25] land
[1:27:25] and he'll go to calvary in the land
[1:27:30] where joseph was was to be
[1:27:33] buried at because that's where the
[1:27:36] resurrection was going to take place
[1:27:43] because it was in the book
[1:27:51] it gets close to 400 years
[1:27:55] it's kind of like getting close to the
[1:27:58] to the gentile end of the gentile
[1:28:00] dispensation and they knew god was going
[1:28:03] to do something
[1:28:09] and two very insignificant by the world
[1:28:12] standard people amram
[1:28:16] and joseph bad
[1:28:21] they're slaves too
[1:28:25] and they are under great persecution too
[1:28:30] and great affliction too
[1:28:34] but only a prophet could look back and
[1:28:36] see that he would go up in the attic
[1:28:39] and pray every night
[1:28:44] and upon one of that one of those
[1:28:46] meetings he has a visitation with an
[1:28:49] angel
[1:28:52] now understand that pharaoh
[1:28:55] realizes that there's a there's a male
[1:28:59] child that's coming that's a prophet
[1:29:03] and he's going to destroy his kingdom
[1:29:07] and so he begins to have male children
[1:29:09] destroyed
[1:29:13] and has the midwives to destroy trying
[1:29:16] to destroy the seed
[1:29:19] but remember the seed of god is
[1:29:22] indestructible
[1:29:27] [Applause]
[1:29:34] i wish i had the energy to shout all
[1:29:36] over this building right now
[1:29:40] now god's very good in his way he does
[1:29:43] business
[1:29:44] you remember as for those that were
[1:29:45] watching last night
[1:29:47] a few months ago i or a couple of months
[1:29:49] ago i went to the eye doctor
[1:29:52] the cancer eye doctor oncologist cancer
[1:29:55] eye doctors
[1:29:57] and and they looked at my eyes and was
[1:29:59] about four hours of test
[1:30:01] and then that four hours of tests and
[1:30:04] all of the pictures and all of the
[1:30:06] the the the test that they went through
[1:30:09] they found those two bits of cancer
[1:30:12] now they think that that's where the
[1:30:14] cancer started
[1:30:18] and so they're excited to wear that they
[1:30:22] think this is the beginning of where it
[1:30:24] started if they can find the origin
[1:30:26] that's what they're looking for well
[1:30:27] that's what satan's doing
[1:30:30] he's trying to find the origin
[1:30:34] he'd like to get back into heaven
[1:30:41] he'd like to take your place he'd really
[1:30:43] like to take your place
[1:30:49] so here we are two months later and i'm
[1:30:52] sitting before another oncologist
[1:30:55] and he's looking and he's he's ran all
[1:30:57] the tests
[1:30:58] and he's looking at this he's got this
[1:31:01] set of
[1:31:02] pictures here and my new set of pictures
[1:31:05] here
[1:31:06] and he says well i can tell you this
[1:31:09] what you had here a couple of months ago
[1:31:11] isn't here
[1:31:24] i'd like to bring that just a little bit
[1:31:26] further
[1:31:28] sometimes there's a screen of your past
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:35] and what you had over here and all of
[1:31:38] those sins that was in your life
[1:31:41] and was so literally trying to destroy
[1:31:45] your
[1:31:45] life in this new screen
[1:31:49] of the blood of jesus christ you can
[1:31:52] look and look and look and you can't
[1:31:54] find it
[1:31:58] [Applause]
[1:32:10] hallelujah
[1:32:13] so what you once was you're no longer
[1:32:17] that man nor woman
[1:32:24] anymore
[1:32:31] glory
[1:32:35] and there's nothing satan can do to stop
[1:32:38] that
[1:32:50] moses is born do you think that jesus is
[1:32:54] do you think that jesus is stable was
[1:32:57] the only place that angels hung out
[1:33:03] i'm not making light of that there was
[1:33:06] angels there when you were born
[1:33:11] because you were a seed of god
[1:33:14] you were productionated
[1:33:17] little naked babies screaming crying and
[1:33:20] the angels of god
[1:33:21] are watching over that child
[1:33:27] moses is born almost in secret
[1:33:34] can i get a drink of water
[1:33:38] i want being long now
[1:33:47] how are you going to keep him alive
[1:33:51] god can
[1:33:56] god can
[1:34:02] i want to drink a piece of that just a
[1:34:04] moment
[1:34:11] due to cobit i can't give you none of
[1:34:16] this
[1:34:27] and god asked his mother
[1:34:30] to do something very strange
[1:34:35] i want you to make a bull rush
[1:34:38] i want you to be a certain way i want
[1:34:41] you to place the baby
[1:34:44] in this basket
[1:34:48] i want you to put it in the crocodile

[1:34:58] sight

[1:35:08] want you to be real honest
[1:35:10] we got mothers sitting all over this
[1:35:12] building
[1:35:14] just asked that mother to do something
[1:35:18] impossible for her humanity
[1:35:29] but you remember she's got a faith that
[1:35:32] she can lean back
[1:35:33] on because her grandfather abraham many
[1:35:37] generations back
[1:35:39] was told by god
[1:35:42] take thy son
[1:35:46] thy only son
[1:35:50] and offer him as a sacrifice now you say
[1:35:56] well brother ron
[1:35:57] how could abraham do that remember
[1:36:01] god had set with him
[1:36:04] at his tent and told him i'm going to
[1:36:08] give you a seed
[1:36:10] and you're going to be the father of
[1:36:11] many nations
[1:36:14] so abraham realized
[1:36:17] i'll give him to god and god will raise
[1:36:20] him right back up
[1:36:23] because through isaac
[1:36:26] nations is going to come so
[1:36:29] i even can't destroy him
[1:36:38] i can't even destroy him god's asking me
[1:36:42] to give him to him
[1:36:45] absolutely he didn't even tell
[1:36:48] sarah what he was doing
[1:36:52] but he told those boys at the count at
[1:36:54] the at the
[1:36:55] at the animals he told them said
[1:36:58] i and the lad will return
[1:37:02] father we have wood we have fire but
[1:37:05] where's the sacrifice
[1:37:06] god will provide himself
[1:37:09] a sacrifice
[1:37:14] it was that kind of faith that that
[1:37:17] little mother
[1:37:18] pushed that baby out in that crocodile
[1:37:22] infested water now now stay with me over
[1:37:25] the next few minutes
[1:37:28] she could not see god say gabriel
[1:37:34] line up thousands of angels up and down
[1:37:36] this crocodile-infested waters
[1:37:41] gabriel you stand on this
[1:37:44] bush on this basket and every time the
[1:37:48] crocodile comes up to bite him
[1:37:51] you push him back down in the water
[1:37:58] it's not what you see it's what you
[1:38:01] can't see
[1:38:02] that is so important in your life
[1:38:09] it's not what you feel it's what you
[1:38:11] can't feel
[1:38:13] that's so important past what you see
[1:38:18] think past what you think
[1:38:27] he'll get into whirlpools you get him
[1:38:29] out of it
[1:38:31] he'll get into spots you get him out of
[1:38:34] it
[1:38:37] and where did he wind up
[1:38:41] in pharaoh's house
[1:38:45] brother branham said
[1:38:48] god has a way he let the enemy train him
[1:38:54] and send him to school
[1:39:01] destroyed moses he wasn't going to
[1:39:04] destroy him
[1:39:08] but brother ron who's the smallest baby
[1:39:11] in this building now
[1:39:13] who's a small do we have a small baby in
[1:39:14] this building
[1:39:16] amen why sister connie that's just
[1:39:20] perfect well bring that baby here
[1:39:25] now she's got one on her brother
[1:39:30] i won't take her because she may cry
[1:39:39] don't you fall come on up here with me
[1:39:45] hey yeah
[1:39:48] now this baby can't defend itself
[1:39:55] is he awake you tell him when he wakes
[1:39:58] up what happened
[1:40:02] this baby can't watch over itself
[1:40:06] it can't do that are you with me
[1:40:12] but this baby has been protected
[1:40:15] since adam
[1:40:19] it's been protected since adam and now
[1:40:23] god gave it a mother and a father to
[1:40:25] watch over and protect it
[1:40:27] but they're not alone in that there's an
[1:40:29] angel
[1:40:30] standing there's angels standing even
[1:40:33] now
[1:40:34] maybe close to me i think i know what
[1:40:37] i'm talking about but
[1:40:38] there's angels watching over here
[1:40:52] because she's a daughter of god amen
[1:40:56] thank you thank you
[1:41:02] i want to just drop a couple more
[1:41:04] thoughts here and maybe
[1:41:06] maybe i'll have strength to preach next
[1:41:07] sunday morning

[1:41:13] why did pharaoh tried to destroy
[1:41:16] generations
