ourselves out of the way father to receive something from you father that we didn't even expect to receive Lord we grant our or we ask Lord that you would take complete control of the service tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride says amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the book of haggai chapter 2 . haggai chapter 2 and verse 1. if you don't know where it's at it's in the Old Testament between the Z's of Zephaniah and Zechariah if you go to Matthew and flip back three chapters three books you'll find haga very very short book to us but it's a very powerful book very powerful book and you know God does all things all things will and he has everything planned out according to his timing amen amen hey God chapter 2 and verse 1. and in the seventh month and in the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet haggai saying speak now to zerubbabel the son of the son of shatel governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of jehoshadek the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as of nothing yet now be strong O's a rubable saith the Lord and be strong o Joshua son of jehoshadek the high priest and be strong O ye people of the land saith the Lord and work for I Am With You whenever God speaks to us and says I'm with you it doesn't matter what we're going through it doesn't matter what we're facing it gives us a courage to press on in the battle for I Am with You saith the Lord of hosts according to the word that I Covenant with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts the glory of this latterhouse shall be greater than of the former saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts John chapter 1 and verse 14. then also down to John chapter 14. John chapter 1 and verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and of Truth also John chapter 14 and verse 12. verily verily I say unto you that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord and from these scripture readings tonight I'd like to gather a thought from the word of God here in hagai that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former the glory of the latterhouse shall be greater than the former and out of the message of lifting him up out of History he says he said we're standing here tonight upon the brim and watching come to pass and unfold two great scenes and those two great scenes are these one of them is the ending of history and the other one is the ending of time and many great men down Through the Ages has long deceived this hour that we are now approaching as we live in this glorious setting of mortal sun and breaking of eternal life he said I do feel that we are living in one of the grandest ages that has ever been that man that ever man has been permitted to live because it's the closing out of time and it's the blending in of Eternity history only tells us what we have read of what has been and what's in the future lays in the very hand of God and we recognize that tonight that if time would go on that there would be history books that would be that would be ruled after this generation that would come but we recognize that we are at the very ending of time that there will be no there will be no history upon upon what you're going through right now and I think that tonight I think Where We Gather this thought of lifting him up out of history and I think that there ever was a time that we ought to lift our Lord Jesus Christ out of history that it's right now because we're recognizing that we are living in a world that that is wanting to do away with the very image of God they're wanting to do away with a very simple of God and ever there was a time that we ought to lift up the name of Jesus Christ and not be afraid to stand up for our god-given rights it's right now in the midst of this lay Odyssey and age when we recognize that we are in the darkest of all ages but we recognize that it is in this age that he comes at the ending of all of the seeing all of the things that he gives us the very token life and we recognize that after all of them seals that was laid back there that that had been bound for all of those years but now all of the message is capped off in this one thing and it is the very token life of almighty God now just to give you a little bit of background just for a moment of Hagia that Hagar was a prophet of the restored Remnant after the 70 years of that captivity where they were down there in Babylon and you go to studying out the book of haggai you'll look at his ministry that the very theme of it was to them of the unfinished Temple and his mission was to admonish was to admonish and encourage the builders or the workers of that day so so you begin to look and you'll begin to see in the book of haggad that he began to rebuke them because of their lack of their fervency of working upon the Temple of the Lord but then he comes around and he brings a message of encouragement and I think it's amazing that God what he does he causes us to repent but then he grings about a message of Grace he shows us where we're wrong but he brings about a message of Grace so haggai he rebukes them for their lack of fervency but he comes behind them with a message of encouragement you see God will not leave you where he found you at God will not leave you in the current condition that you are in he will not leave you in your former condition but I want to say this or let this be a theme of our thought tonight that the latter part of your life will be the greater part of your life and that's what hagasa Ministry was it was to set about a course to encourage them in the very work of the Lord and if there's one thing that I I want to do in my life I want to encourage every person every young person every little child every middle age and every old person to encourage them to believe that God is still God and that he's still on his throne and he still cares about you but notice notice then he brings he brings this message of the future glory of the temple you see that the very general design of the book of haggai it was to reprove the Jews for their negligence in the building up of the temple after that they had been given or Liberty that was granted to them my Cyrus to build to build the work of the Lord and their haga he encouraged them to look and look that there was a promise of a messiah that was coming and when you look at haggai's name his name his name signifies or speaks to us to be able to keep a feast or it signifies a time of festival or a time of joy and haggai was standing there under under his under his name and under his character and he was standing there and he was telling them you're looking at the work but I'm telling you that there's a time of joy that is coming you see what heck I was doing he was he was said about haggai that one Earnest man can arouse the entire Community you see you let a Fire Glow in our hearts and it'll spread that's what John Wesley said he said you like one man you set one man on fire and the world will come and watch him burn and haggai was assured of God's presence and had I assured the Church of the Living God of that day The Remnant that was left over there he assured them of God's presence and within three weeks the whole land was awake to the fact that God was going to come and do a greater work now let's think about this message that it's that it circled the world seven times over and what has it done it has awoken a sleeping virgin it's awoken abroad to recognize who they are it's encouraged our heart to recognize that the former shall be greater than the latter so so the glory of this latter house is going to be greater than that of the former says the Lord of hosts so you see the very former or the first house which was built by Solomon which was which was a very glorious one and if we would consider the very the the very Treasures of Solomon's Temple where you look at the riches that was laid up by David and was given to Solomon for building it if you look at the great workmen that worked upon Solomon's Temple that was employed to work upon it or if you look at the statelessness of the fabric of the of the Dynamics of the building itself then you would look at the latter house and you would think Ma this is nothing to compare to the former house to the like which we see in the first house it was you see the very depiction you see the very one that drawn it out the architect was almighty God you see he'd set out the decorations of it he'd set out the vessels in it and above all the glory of the Lord came down and it filled it and continued there but God was saying about this I know that it doesn't look like it was in Solomon's time but I want to say to you that the glory of the latterhouse is going to be greater than that of the former house so I want you just just to grab your mind just for a minute that in the Jews mind that that this Temple that's coming that this Temple that's going to be built it's going to be very great I'm going to have to be glorious it's going to have to exceed it's going to have to exceed some great things to be greater than that of Solomon's Temple but when the latter house was built the Jews themselves recognized things lacking in the latter which is laying there in the former they begin to look at it they begin to look at it through the scriptures or they begin to look at it through the through the lens of their opinion or through their perspective and they were not looking at it in the way that God looked at God asked them to look at it and I think it's amazing that Humanity has the ability to look at things the way they want to instead of the way that God wants them to look at it so they were looking at the former house and they seen things that were missing in the latter house they seemed that the Ark of the Covenant was missing they seemed that the original fire that was that was lit by all almighty God was missing they seen that the urum and famine was missing they met they seemed that the anointing oil and the cherubims they were missing and all of the older men that had that had seen the the former house they begin to sit there and they begin to weep because of that it came short of the other house that was there in the former house yeah you can imagine those that had seen the former house and those that had seen the latter house and I think it's a it's it's it's human tendency to depreciate the present because of the glories of the past the old people look back to the days of the former Temple even as we are out to look back to upon times of great preachers of the past of all I wish for the Homer could be back here or oh my we sure had a wonderful time back there when when we were back there on Summit or we we sure had a good time when we were up there in brother Bill's house or are we sure we sure had a good time when we was out there in an old tent meetings you know it's amazing that Humanity can look through the lens of their perspective instead of the way God wants them to look at it see they will sit there they were sitting there and think this this Temple that is built has nothing compared to the temple my let me let me drop back and just preach just for a moment this this one has no no caught the converts the converts that we got when we were back there in the old house meetings or the or the sabbaths that we kept back there in the temple they'll never be compared to what's happening here you know what Satan's middle name is it's regret it's regret and a lot of people they'll sit there in the days gone by and they'll say my I wish I could have gone back to Days Gone By I wish I could have been here when Jesus was here what day are you living in the same yesterday today and forever you don't need to look back to Days Gone By you need to look up to the hour that you're living in it's the hour it's the hour of the son of man [Music] but I really I really want to grab your attention right here and I know that I'm going just a little bit differently but this is how the Lord is laying some things out but a lot of times Humanity has a way of looking at things and they'll have a lay of looking at things in my when brother Homer was here things was completely different you're right you're right we're not taken away from the former is that right but you see that Satan's middle name is Regret and a lot of times people spend time thinking about days gone by and things are things man I wish I could have really been here when William Bradham was here I wish I really would have I wish I really would have enjoyed where I was living at you see the reason why people live in regret is because they did not accept what was really happening and if time will tarry you will speak about the seasons of life that we are in right now and if you don't accept if you don't accept where we are you will go on to regret what is happening now so I want to say to you don't miss what is happening and enjoy the season of the lord The Rapture is at hand don't miss don't miss what is happening it is the Shekinah Glory that is amongst us you see what they were looking at they were looking at the natural instead of the glory that was going to come and fill the latter house you see what gave the latter house the greater glory was a very personal presence of the Messiah in it you see his presence is what makes the difference I can look at every single one of your lives tonight and I could say this over your life that you're the latter part of your life is greater than the former part of your life William Branham said the only regret that I have is I didn't serve him so good in the first 25 years like I did in the past 25 years so let me say you it doesn't matter the hell hole you came out of it doesn't matter the sickness that you went through it doesn't matter the trouble that Satan put on your life the latter part is the greater part because it is his Destiny it is his power [Applause] it is his power that's making the difference it's Humanity that's making the difference but I want to say to you that a greater than Solomon is here and greater than all of the prophets is here and greater than Abraham we don't need to look back and think man I wish I could have lived there and had William Brandon discern my heart Who was the discerner who was the one that was there reading the very secrets of the heart it's the same one that's at the pulpit it's the same one right here and he's greater if the queen of the South could ride all of those months and go up there to try to find the Messiah go up there and see the Messiah and Solomon how much more should we be able to look in the revealing of the son of man and see that it's still the same yesterday today and forever come on now but a lot of times I'm sorry I'm laboring here but a lot of times but I really enjoyed it when this one was here or that one was here and they're missing what's happening right now we are not diminishing what was we are just saying that we would not be here if they had not went we would not be standing on the Forefront where we're standing at if it hadn't been Trailblazers that had set a trail before us we're not saying or taken away from anybody but the reason why the fire is so great is they laid the fuel out there and when the Holy Ghost Came Upon it it made that which when the former greater in the latter what do Joe say that in the last days I will pour out my spirit on All Flesh the former and the latter rain and you are here in the greatest moving of the Holy Ghost you don't need to wish that he was back in 1906 to see the manifestations of the Holy Ghost it's a greater day than you ever looked at and ever lived in it's this day he said well I wish I could have been there and seen those great healings you are in the greatest healing Revival that you've ever seen the world is on fire with the moving of the Holy Ghost [Applause] you don't need William Branham to discern your heart he's still here the mighty Angel is still here you don't need a man to lay his hands on you you are under the greatest message that there is the opening of the word [Applause] but when Jesus Jesus went in the temple a Passover he walked in there and he looked at his father's house and said you've made my father's house a house of merchandise you've made it a den of Thieves and the Bible said that he that he scored together hurry bound together a small cord and he began to he began to get out into the fruit of the spirit and they begin to overthrow the table the money changers and he looked at on on them and said now look he said you destroy this Temple and in three days I'll race it back up again they said it took us 46 years to build this Temple and yet you're saying that you can rear it back up in three days but they didn't recognize that he was talking about the Temple of his body because there was a veil in front of them there when the pillar of fire would stand behind the veil and he would hide behind the veil but now he was standing there in the robe of humanity and they didn't recognize that the very Shekinah Glory that came down on Mount Shania was standing there robed in the flesh of Jesus Christ if they were hid Their Eyes Were hidden because of the Veil come on now what did they miss they were missing the very glory of the Lord that was right in front of them you know when Jesus well Jesus is out preaching the Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 12 that Jesus and his disciples were passing through a cornfield and his disciples were hungered and they began to pluck off the ears off out of the field and they begin to eat and there was those bunch of busy body Hypocrites over there they said now look here look at here your disciples are a bunch of Sinners they don't even keep this sabbath but Jesus reminded them of the word he said don't you remember when David our father when he was up there and he was hungered that he went into the place that he didn't belong in and started eating on the priests so bread that it was unlawful for him to eat of he said but I'll say this to you there is one amongst you that is greater than the temple that you're looking at you are not looking at a day you are looking at the lord of the Sabbath I'm Lord over this I own the rest so if he owns arrest he can give you peace and in this place I will give you peace now some of you went through all kinds of turmoil but this is a place that you'll find peace at Hallelujah it is not in what days gone by it's right now right now in your flesh is wrong deity deity's not in heaven deities in you everything you have need of in this life's journey what's given unto you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know but Jesus said to him because of your stinking traditions made my Commandments of no effect you see you see what you've done by your traditions and by your sacrifices and by your eye by by going in and making all of these Traditions what are you doing by all of your theology you are making my power unaffected and every time you try to put an intellectual giant over top of the word of God he makes the word of God uneffective but you put a real holy ghost-filled person whether they're a preacher or whether they're a wash woman you put the Holy Ghost on the inside of them and they'll recognize the very power of the Holy Ghost and it's not unaffected but it's effective that's why Satan is trying to do his very best to keep that the very deity of almighty God from getting behind your flesh you say once he was on the backside of badger skins and now he is still foreign he's ruthless but God wanted to hide himself through behind some hillbilly Badgers some Mountain talking batchers some people that the some people that had some rough characters about them some people that had some dark history about them some people that didn't know one thing about God but he wanted them because he knew that they would hide him and when when things would get rough you knew how to fight in the first place you was a fighter but he took that old nature out of you but he lays some of the character in there so that you'll fight for the Holy Ghost you see God put something on the inside of the elect of God she's not pushed around she's not having to be Mammy pimsy she doesn't have to have a bottle in her mouth all the time she knows who she is birthday he said no no notice what he says in serpent seed he said the reason that God is opening these things to us is God is bringing his sons in the manifestations and he's going beyond the limitations of any human knowledge way into the spiritual Revelations and he's bringing it down you see when Jarius had got in his condition when his very own daughter was out at the point of death Jarius knew that intellectual Creeds that he'd been studying as a priest would never get his daughter out of the condition that she was in he knew that the Theology of cairversis would not raise his daughter from the dead that she was in but I'll say this that if you are walking with Jesus you are walking Beyond human limitations you get what I'm saying to you if you're walking with Jesus you're walking Beyond human limitations so where I can take you is only so far because there's limits on where I can take you but where Jesus can take you is far beyond the bar it's far beyond your Creed it's far beyond your sin when you are walking with Jesus you are going Beyond human limitations but Jesus sometimes forces the issue to get you to believe him you see Jairus he was convinced that he was Jesus he was concerned he was convinced but Jesus gets you to a spot that he's going to force the issue to see if you'll really believe her to Show Your Colors he'll put you in trouble to really see if you really believe him you know the story there's a woman with a blood issue has dealt with this thing for 12 years she don't deserve to be around him according to the laws according to their theologies she has no business with Jesus but her faith was so strong that if I can just touch the hymn of His Garment the outer parts of His Garment that I'll be made home I want you to catch in the same picture there's Darius and there's a woman with a blood issue and Jairus was convinced he was convinced he was Jesus he was convinced of that which he read about in the Traditions when he read about Moses when he read about the glory of the Lord that had come down upon the mountain that even if a beast touched the mountain that he had to be thrust through he was convinced that that same power was he was convinced that the same one that said let there be was in this Temple he was so convinced that there was nothing there was nothing in his school that could keep him from believing in Jesus but I want you to watch the attitude of Jesus that when Jesus is touched by the woman with a blood issue Jarius doesn't get jealous Jarius doesn't lose Faith watch his attitude he doesn't get jealous that she got healed first [Applause] he doesn't get jealous his faith didn't leave her I don't care if I'm in the worst condition I don't care how bad I am if he can get to you first let him get to you because I know that Jesus is on his way because I've called him to come I've asked him to come my attitude is not wavered in what I'm looking at when other people are getting healed it's just the further it's in my faith that greater is he that is in me that in he that is in the world if he could do it for her he can do it for me I'm not concerned if he lost his power he said virtue went for me when somebody touched me but Jarius was convinced he was so much Jesus he knew what he saw in the former would be greater in the latter are you how are you preaching with me tonight he knew what he saw in that little woman that what he'd see in his little daughter would be greater let me tell you he's still Jesus and he still raises a dead he's still in the resurrection power he's still in the Holy Ghost given power [Applause] hell messed up nothing can happen to you except God and allow the enemy to touch your life I know we have a hard time sometimes parents we tell our kids not to say stupid but we are dealing with a stupid devil can he say Amen now think about this God allows his arch enemy to touch your life because God knows that he's got confidence in you and you're convinced of who he is and Satan said oh how are we going to miss time but yet throughout it all who gets the glory you said well I don't know why I keep going through the mess that I'm in don't you recognize that all of your trials are precious gold don't you recognize that even though hell can touch your life it can make you sick as a dog it can make you it can make you it can make you do all kinds of different things hell has an effect upon it but do you realize that the effect of Heaven is greater than the fact of hell so hell has messed up when it's touched the children of the most high God you see there's a lot of people that don't want this in their Church there's a lot of people that don't want this power in their Church but God is as good as his word that if you believe him if you ask him he'll come by your way you know I was raised around farm animals all all our life and I can't tell you how many times I spent my papa Charlie getting cattle out of the fence they just they just love sticking their head through that woven wire and reaching over there what are they going after it's not that they want to get their head stuck they're going after the grass on the other side because they have ate up everything on this side of the fence and brother Branham said he said I am convinced that Pentecost is not an organization but Pentecost is an experience he said you can't fence off this Pentecostal experience you can try to Finch Us in and you can try to say that our young people will never get this Pentecostal experience but you can't fence in the Holy Ghost you see what we're doing we are making a way in the fence because there's somebody there's somebody asking there's somebody looking there's somebody seeing that there is a move of God let me tell you you can try to fence in the Ducks but God will raise the water so that the ducks can just float over the walls you can try everything you want to to keep us from understanding the power of Pentecost has returned but this that you're looking at is greater than what you've seen at Azusa it's greater than what you've seen in Acts 2 this is the restoration of all things foreign you see what his Shekinah Glory did we dropped down in the temple it ripened the showbread so what did it do what did it do that which was laying there in seed form he brought the pass in bread form you see what everything what God is doing right now is there has been Gene seeds of God that have been deposited throughout his foreknowledge and what is he doing his Shekinah is coming down and it is ripening what is laying there in the word so what is he doing with his glory right now he's bringing it to pass thank you he's bringing it to pass through a Ministry of Malachi 4 and is revealing it to the very hearts of the children that have been turned back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers what is he doing he says in your Veil to bring his word to pass you see just like 2000 years ago just like 2000 years ago if you look at it in that perspective that Humanity was looking at it is that we'll never get out of the case of the Fall that because of Adams because of out of sin that we're going to stay here in this condition we'll be here in this condition but all of the prophecies that was laying there throughout all of the Old Testament was wrapped up in one man our Lord Jesus Christ and what did he do he embodied the very heart of the father and the father wanted some children that he could call his own so he reversed the curse of the devil in your life and he redeems you he brought you back what is he he is the greater Boaz if you look at Ruth what did Boaz do he rolled back the title of Ruth the moabitus and he gave her the title of Ruth the redeemed that's why William Branham said I'll not call you church I'll call your bride because he was not looking at a church body he was looking at the redeemed what he saw in the Pentecostal organization what's greater in the pride what he saw out there in a charismatic move was greater in the pride they might have portions of it but this is the ad this is the return of the Holy Ghost he was the fullness of the godhead body but you make up all of him what is this this is the bride coming of Christ it was once in one man but now it's in a many member bride he said the words that I do shall you do also but greater look at your neighbor say greater but greater than these that's how you do what am I saying to you that the greater is here in the latter that where you are standing at is everything that God dreamed of filled in his mind they architect himself seen you here the architect designed you being here foreign I'm not too much of a builder I'm more of a demolisher but there's some brothers here that have some real gifts to be able to put some things together it was not chosen my lot in life to be that but you know that's right but you know that when a sisters got her house lined out she's got the blueprint in front of her pray for a good marriage right there good some of you know some of you young people are going to figure it out but when she's got this house designed exactly to her speculation she's dreamed of it she's thought of it it's a terrible thing when she said well I didn't turn out the way I wanted it you know what that cost you an extra thirty thousand dollars but when but when God goes to design it he knows exactly what it's going to look like he's not surprised by the peace that he had to chisel down he had to work on them it seemed like they was never going to get it but they were the missing piece he knew where they were going to fit in at say when God the great artist looks at it said it's even better than I thought it was going to be like can you imagine I've designed this building so that she'll talk like me that she'll dress like me she'll act like me she'll do the works like me I tell you she's so much like me it's like I'm looking at the word it's like I'm looking at myself you know when you go through Galatians chapter 4 and you look at the adoption process that when the father sends out the tutor he sends a tutor with a son and the tutor comes back and he gives him word he's just like his daddy he looks like his daddy he operates like his daddy you can send him out into the field he's over your inheritance he thinks like you the father knows the father knows because you are in his paternal inheritance he knows that you won't do anything outside of his word I see what it does by you looking at this you say I appreciate your collapse I appreciate your excitement I appreciate you getting getting moved by the word but what I appreciate is you saying Amen to the word because even though it seems cutting and though it seems like it's hurting your body if you can say Amen to it it's bringing your body under subjection and William Branham said in the token message that full obedience through the word of God entitles you to the Token so I appreciate you getting excited but let your excitement be because of your amen let it be because you believe that this is exactly that then so be it if he's preaching on me so be it Lord if he's cutting at me so be it Lord the reason why we are in a church that is a mature church is because we know what the word is and we know what it does and we can say Amen foreign you see when that Passover was happening what did they do they had to lay their hand upon the sacrifice to identify themselves with the sacrifice because you see the blood of bulls and goats was a covering for them it was a religion for them at the time that's what religion is it's a covering but you see they had something they had something there that would lay upon all of the sins of their life but they would go out with the same nature but there was coming one you see what they were seeing in part you are now seeing in the supreme power of the supernatural you see what they were seeing in part you are seeing in full you see because you have a supernatural Supreme token and what did this token do it placed us as the manifested Sons and Daughters of God and has brought us back to the adoptions of sons that now are we the sons of God you see what that token is that token is our identification that we have believed God and God has accepted us it's not us saying I believe your word it's not just us sitting there and saying Amen to it but God is saying amen back to your faith you see if you've got the very token life of almighty God upon you God is saying I am a man in your faith this is what I wish I wish I could have one of them gifts like like brother rohan's got a gift of knowledge or a gift to discernment or the gift of speaking in tongues if you've got the gift of faith you are in the body you can sit there and say Amen to the word of God stop looking for something else say Amen to it stop wishing for somebody else's gifts you'll operate out of your power but if you can say Amen to it and live in the gift of your faith you'll operate the word in your position Hallelujah Hallelujah somebody say hallelujah brother random told us he said now he said when a man takes that inspired word and he reads that inspired word he said them two Inspirations come together and it brings about her result so when you read the inspired word and you say Amen to the inspired word and you get inspired to believe that it's going to bring about a result just like when Moses he got inspired to run under the message of Abraham that thy seed would sojourn in a Strange Land he got under the inspiration of Abraham's Covenant and he took a people right on to the to the promised land have a good time by myself up here but when shamgar got under the inspiration when he got on the inspiration that he was under the Abraham Covenant of circumcision he recognized that the Bible said that want to put a flight a thousand so he got under the inspiration of it and he killed 600 devils he said well I'm facing more than a thousand let me join up with your team because I want to put a flight a thousand and two ten thousand it doesn't matter what you're facing we are a broad body under the inspiration of Malachi 4 under the restoration of the word of the hour and we call black black and white white let me tell you ain't got a promise message up you ain't gotta pump this message up you ain't gotta sing it up you ain't gotta tune it up just preach it like it is and let it settle where it is Satan will have to do what he's got to do I'm not pumping you up by my voice it's the voice of almighty God that is calling you to come up a little bit higher well I don't understand I don't understand why things are this way we're under the inspiration of it you don't understand why things are going like they are but there's somebody that's laid out that is on why is this one this way why is this one sick why am I going through this the latter shall be greater than the former he's still Jesus he's still on the throne he's still away maker let me say this to you that the glory that Moses and Heron fellowshipped with was in the body of Jesus Christ let me tell you if he was not the Shekinah Glory if the glory of the father did not dwell on the inside of Jesus blind Bartimaeus would still be blind jairus's daughter would still be dead Lazarus would still be dead the water would still be water instead of wine come on somebody the 5000 would still be hungry the leper would still be known as a leprous man if if he was if he was who he says he was he had the ability to come the storms and to walk upon it but if he didn't if he was not the Shekinah he just sunk right there and the storm would have stayed in a place but because he's still Jesus Devin's sitting here Jason Smith sitting here Melissa Hill is still sitting here because he's still the begotten of the father and he's full of grace and he's full of truth because he still is Jesus you wouldn't be here without his glory you wouldn't be in the picture without his power but because of his power the latter shall be greater Hallelujah Hallelujah this is beyond human limitations you shouldn't be here by human standards but we're not following a Methodist move we're not following a Wesleyan move we're not following Azusa Pentecostal move this is beyond that this is the restoration of the word I want you to think how far you want to get in this life I want you to think about how far you want to get I want you to think about how far you want to get in your financial status you forgive me just for a minute but I'm going to get to you on your level for one way you think about where you're at in your financial status think about where you are as a family think about where you are in a natural and God will go beyond your human limitations you see when the meal was running out and the oil was out he went beyond her human limitations let me tell you when the oil had run out in the Pentecostal movement he said I am the god that restores you see you can expect certain things but God will do greater than what you're expecting you can expect a certain way for your Miracle to come but he's going to do it greater than You're Expecting I want to say to you what you're expecting it's going to be greater I'm expecting Erica Parker to be completely healed but it's going to be greater than I can imagine I am expecting Ron Spencer to completely walk out of cancer but it's going to be greater than I could ever imagine I'm expecting this bride to go but it's going to be greater than I can imagine because it's beyond my human limitations [Applause] let me tell you if you're still trying to catch up with me you're riding on a horse and buggy come on somebody I'm not trying to preach to you some Pentecostal Jubilee where I pump you up sing you up it'll only take you into the skies but I'm preaching to you something that'll take you beyond the heavenlies it'll take you further than man's ever went and preach to he preaching to you an astronaut's age message let me tell you where you are walking the methodists have never walked well you're walking the Mennonites have never walked forgive me forgive me if I hurt your feelings but what the what the Mennonites had what the Brethren had what the westlings had what the lutherans had when all of them denominations had or never put you in a rapture because it's full of ideas and it's worth full of theology but this message is straight from the Throne of God if this message is wrong then all Christianity is wrong this message is the bodyman of Jesus Christ did God take his picture with in this day he didn't take it with John Smith he didn't take it with the denominations of the world he took it with your message it's this pillar fire that'll lead you beyond human limitations Hallelujah you see the children of Israel thought they were going this way but the pillar of fire took them that way and you thought you were going this way to your rapture but God says no I'm taking you further foreign but I got critics let me tell you the most criticized being in the room is the pillar of Fire sister Rachel it's the most criticized thing in this room and it's a pillar of Fire and when men are criticize it and when men make fun of it he will back up what he said you remember the FBI agents you remember what they were trying to act like they were trying to cause they were trying to cause I ain't show them they were trying to cause a showdown of fire and the pillar fire showed up you see there was men back there that was impersonating the FBI or trying to say that the FBI was coming to expose William Branham as a Divine healer as a false prophet but he stood there he said it ain't the FBI it's them two backslidden preachers back there once in a gray suit and one's in a blue suit if they'd have come down to there to that pulpit and stood where William Branham stood at that had been two men carried out that night you can criticize this but the pillar of fire will show up let me tell you we are not great he's the one that is great if you're looking at the man William Branham and you're saying that he's the great one you are missing a picture it's a pill or fire in the picture that is the great one what is that that's our headship that's our intellect where are you getting this material at well brother Andrew I'm getting I ain't getting it from Jeffersonville I ain't getting it from Rome but I'm getting it straight from the Throne of God [Music] [Applause] Pentecost thought they had a great movement in 1906 but they denominationalize it and they organized it and put a fence around it but God says I'm not done yet I said well I don't want none of that ax too 38. I don't want none of them screaming blabbering hollering youngins it shows what kind you are because well I don't want that kind of stirring up or emotion in my church you know something somebody's got to be an idiot I mean I I'm a little bit partial to this guy back here but I just want to say something I feel like we're under some of the greatest training that we should be you're not just some schoolgirl that don't know what she's doing you've been well trained you've been well taught and you know what I have enough faith in this guy right back here that if we did get out of order he'd come and put us in order but the problem with so many people and so many people want to sit around the outskirts of the message they never had a restoration so they can't have a fulfillment so they gotta sit back and say well we gotta we gotta hold our people back because if I'll tell you what I'll tell you what if we let them get over there where the grass is really green at we'll never hold them in with a fence don't you worry if you built the fence God will get them out [Applause] [Music] God is the one that built this message God is the one that sent this message I don't care if I got us grow in tongues scream in tongues I don't care what I gotta do let me do exactly what is predestined in this hour to do [Applause] I just come to see if it's really real I'll say like Jesus said come and see you won't be the last Gentile that he shows himself to but let me point you to the first one that he showed himself to she was simply looking for a crumb and maybe you're looking for a crumb from the master's table and he's called you out said I have no part with you bunch of dogs right do you still want what he's got when he tells you that the way that you're living is not my kind of living do you still want what he's got let me tell you let me tell you something Jesus my daughter is sick with the Devil she's sick with the devil I'm not asking for a full plate from you I'm simply asking for a crumb because I know that if I get one little piece from you it will be everything that I have need of Jesus himself couldn't push this siren information woman away from him he couldn't push her away from him when Jesus can't push you away how in the world can the devil try to push you away I just won one piece [Applause] come all the way up here for one piece let me tell you if you get one piece it's worth it and when you get this one piece you're going to be criticized you're going to be talked about you're going to be made fun of you remember when you left the house she was having one of them fits she was over there throwing herself in a temper tantrum rolling around well let me tell you when I give her this crumb she's going to do the same exact thing but it'll be under a different spirit [Applause] what is it then people can't see that he's behind them Badger skins and they call them a bunch of holy rollers but it's the same El Shady eye that was back there with Abraham that was up there with Abraham and had a conversation with Abraham and he started talking to him what this Angel wants to deposit we'll give you enough faith that you can go through the truth you can go through the worst of tiles you can go through tribulations in this world but what the angel is depositing to you you might be walking back with a crowd and somebody says do you really think that what he's given you is enough to take care of her amen amen people might talk about you the way that you drive an hour and a half to get here but it's worth it when you get a crumb from the master table it's everything you have need of [Applause] when she got back to her home she said you know what the latter is greater than the former when my wife got a new husband she said the latter is greater than the former I got a pretty look I got a pretty good idea of what the message is you get the Holy Ghost the latter is greater than the former you say you got to get to a spot that you can let yourself go you got to let go and you got to let God because this is beyond what you think I ain't preaching to you some Hocus Pocus I'm preaching to you about the one that's in the room he is my provider he is my satisfying portion he is my everything I'm not trying to get you to think about something or let your mind drift off because that's where you're going to get in trouble is when you let your mind get off at just drifting off you're setting yourself up for an evil spirit but what I'm trying to get you to do is open up your soul realm to accept that the father is here you gotta let go and let God parents stop trying to make them get it and let go and let God I believe in keeping a standard I believe in setting the standards but when the enemy comes in like a flood who's the one that raises the standard not you God you gotta let go with your own life stop trying to figure it out stop trying to make yourself do something that you weren't destined to do brother Branham said he said you take that little fishy he said he has the ability to drop all the way down into the ocean he has a law there that allows him to let himself go to it and he can sink all the way down he said but if he takes the wrong perspective I said well I'll tell you what I got to do I gotta run up there on top of the water and I got to get me a great big gulp of oxygen he said what he'll do he'll try to sink down and he'll blow up but he just lets himself go to it he said the bird don't think I gotta go take off running and running at it and then I'll just take off but he's got all that controls him you and I don't have that long I wish we did that'd be pretty cool wouldn't it you imagine me preaching with that kind of law I'll be at the back with brother Adam before you know it what'd he do he just let go and let God he said but what you've got to do is you've got to let go and you've got to let God do it sometimes we just want to control it and work it all out get all the details fixed out and sit back and say well God didn't I do a nice job and he says I ain't the way I drawed it up I'll tell you if we had our way man we come into heaven we'd be wearing our three-piece suit our hair would be just perfectly right where'd they come from they must just step out a magazine they sure didn't come out of layout say it that way but God has a way of letting us go through some real stuff he lets this one get diagnosed with this way he lets this one get diagnosed with this way but he's got this brother over here that's praying for this history over here and when you come to get on the Chariot with the King you had to let go to fight you had to let go to get on my brother random said when you let go he'll bring you to your healing he'll bring you to your miracle he said he'll bring you to any of his promises when you let go and let God brother Andrew I was really hoping that you'd preach to us at seven seal tonight I just did you mean it's that simple what is it it's the token life of Jesus Christ operating through a third pole Ministry and a bride that says let go what William Branham do he didn't he didn't set them things up he said then things were sovereignly given he said he spoke to me what are you out here hunting for and he's been speaking to your heart what are you here hunting for some of you come here hunting for a crumb and you got it he said he's done more in my little humble Ministry than he did in his own he said he took those he took those those five fish in those two loaves and he broke peace after peace after peace he said but in my Ministry he took something that was not there and put it there what is he asking you to do Let Yourself Go Let Yourself Go to the message stop getting your idea of what you think it's got to be Let Yourself Go I'm not saying let yourself go to Every wind of Doctrine and just blow all over the place but stay right here stay right here in this field Ruth everything you have need of is right here you ain't gonna have to wonder if this is right or that is right Boaz has put everything in your field and when Boaz gets done with you you ain't gonna be known as the moabitus or Gentile but you are going to be known as the Queen of Heaven what was she doing resting stand with me she was resting resting in it hey man hey man hey man amen Amen Let the brother say oh yeah let the brother say

Hand touches your life you could have never screamed out Amazing Grace in the condition that you were in but when the master of the word begin to strum his bow over your life it must have been the hand of the Lord what got you in this condition what got you in this place it must have been to be honest the music that you were putting out before it was hard on the ears and talking to you when he began to rub the bow of the word across your life it didn't sound too churchy sound a whole lot like a bottle sounded a whole lot like a bad night but when the word began to strung over you and the Master's Hand took you in his hand and he began to tune it just the way he wanted it this ain't according to man's ideas but this is the way while I was a praising somebody touched me oh while I was praising somebody touched me while I was a praising somebody touched me I know it was a hand of my lord well while I was singing Somebody Touched Me While I was a singing somebody touched me while I

holy Glory [Music] Glory [Music] I don't understand how it's glory glory glory [Music] I know it [Music] was expected [Music] I begin receiving I'm not looking for somebody else's hand I'm looking for his hand look at your life man tried to put his hand on your life all it tried to make you manhandle but you never turned out to anything some men tried to put some unsound Doctrine on you and try to make it ring out something ain't right but when the Masters had come on somebody sane tried his best to put you in a honky tonk and he tried to put you in a devil's grave but when the hand of the Lord touched I'm not trying to work you up like I said I ain't trying to sing you up but I'm trying to tell you that what you are feeling in the room is the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost it is the Lord it is the Holy Ghost he's standing at the pulpit it's him everything you have need of is wrapped up in this one he's still Jesus he's still a back healer he's still a cancer defeater laughs he still destroys tuberculosis he still destroys every devil in hell it's him that's going to touch you it's him that's going to make the difference it's his glory it's wrapping up your vessel and feeling you to the uttermost followed after the Lord and the Lord has been my shepherd and he's made me to never want it's him that's done the work it's him that's here who you wanted somebody to give them give the Lord a hand clap of praise foreign [Music] Satan tried to keep us from you [Music] see I'm on this side of it and I know I know sometimes technology is my friend sometimes it ain't and there was material on top of material that got erased just completely gone [Music] I'm the kind of guy that when I look at a scripture I look at it in three angles I look at it the way God looks at it I look at the way the humans look at it and look at the way that Satan looks at it [Music] and I was building some points on those things I come back and I don't understand all that but all of them points that was laying there was completely gone couldn't see it couldn't find it it was gone but while the preaching was going on he brought all of it out and I got a pretty good memory but there's no way that I can remember everything that he put there and Satan tried to get rid of it say what you want to or not I know what he's done in this service I know and you can question in your own imagination right here or whether I'm telling you the truth or not but you just had to take me at his word I know what happened in this service I know who was standing right there I know and I know that when he does something he's doing it for you he's not doing this for me he's doing this for you I want you to understand you may not understand this fully right now but I want to say this to you that the glory of the latter part of your life [Music] is going to be greater than the first part of your life sing it with us today Hallelujah just for your spirit out on me and for just my grace oh saturated oh my thirsty Soul who come again [Music] oh hell you heal my heart and make me [Music] oh honey [Music] just for your spirit [Music] oh Lord I Seek You who help me find you how I need your time foreign
