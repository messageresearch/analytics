come and take these needs before the father this morning as brother Shannon praise you pray with him God bless you [Music] may I just share something with you this morning because as the Lord spoke with me I just said Lord if it be so I'd share it with y'all because it isn't just for me it's for us last week we were on the train and we were coming up the tracks a little Beagle dog come out into the track and I've asked God that while I'm on that train I don't want to take the life of no animal like that because it's a terrible way for them to have to go being hit and run over by that train but a dog when he gets in the track he won't get out he just runs that gauge he won't step out of it and it was just a young dog and as we come up on him and we lose sight of him I just bow my head there and I'm remembering the prayer that I asked the Lord that we've not take no life with no animal no I understand that this whole world there's life and there's death but as the evening progressed and I was home that evening and I was walking the neighborhood with my little dog the Lord started speaking to me about that and he said that dog could live I ain't hearing no audible voice but there's just something in my heart and it's just speaking to me the same angel that was with you and Greg when y'all should have died it's the same Angel that's on that train with you and that dog can be alive and I said Lord if it be so and tomorrow morning when we come up that track and that dog's not laying there I know that that angel got that dog out of that track and I will share it with the people because he also laid on my heart and brother Jason brought it up last night that when this bride recognizes who she is the greater things that he did what we do also you see that's a small thing but I'm telling you that dog should have been laying there dead but it's not it's alive and if we got the faith that we can talk to the Lord and he cares that much about these small things how much more for our loved ones that is fighting these cancers and these needs let's hold it in our heart let's believe y'all believe that with me tonight I know we do let's take it to the Lord in prayer

[Music] these Lions can't hurt me [Music] Jesus [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] thank you to the wind inside [Music] [Applause] aren't you thankful that you're on the win inside I was thinking been thinking about it as of lately the last few weekends just just what a privilege it is to be in the presence of the Lord and and to see our young people how they're growing in the Lord and I tell you I've been I've been watching sister and she's not here this morning so it might be the best time to say it but I've been watching sister Erica Hensley's granddaughter I believe her name's Mia and just how sensitive that she is to the moving of the Holy Spirit and she's been here the last maybe six months maybe I'm not sure how long it is but just to see her so impacted by the Holy Spirit the we didn't ask these young people to come forward and to set up here we didn't we didn't ask our daughters we didn't ask our sons we didn't ask them to come up here but they've desired to be as close to the presence of the Lord that they can be and I I think it's it's an admonishing to to the the ministry here that to see these young people feel the poor the Holy Spirit and I tell you it's a blessing to watch these young people and and then you see people that sat there all their life and they're just not moved by it but you see somebody that's so influenced and it just it's you see the heart of a worshiper and a young girl like that and I just think God's doing specific and special things and what he's doing this weekend to have brother Jason here and brother Danny here they've been my friends for for so many so many years and we could go on about all the friends that we have in this world but there's there's nothing like close friends and ever since I was a little child we were we were always connected with the steaming family and and I always thought even when I wasn't living right if I if I could ever if I ever wanted to be a real Christian or if I wanted to look up to somebody I could really look up to brother Danny steaman and he's just he's a man that wants you he he just he makes you feel like a real Christian he makes you feel like you're important and that's the person brother Brandon would tell us about you find out if who makes you important is the man that the man that's great is the one that makes you feel important and brother Danny has such a powerful Ministry and he's been such a friend and I tell you serving our Lord Jesus Christ is the best thing that we've ever done in this life would you stand with us this morning we invite the ministry to come this morning I'd like to sing that song Stay know what it's like to be in the presence of the Lord [Music] not know what time it is because time Stood Still and bodies were here oh and families restored because we stayed here foreign [Music] for this treasure [Music] [Music] so I'll say stay safe I don't want you to go cause my heart is burning in your prayers [Music] day [Music] I don't want you to

presence comes nothing else matters anymore Trials of life problems you're facing things that you're going through the burdens that are upon you all begin to fade away as his presence makes the difference I'm so glad to be in his presence this morning amen I would have sung it more but I I didn't know it amen so praise the Lord but certainly a wonderful privilege to be here with you this morning I want to bring your greetings from the house of Fellowship in Sarasota Florida and the Spencer family has has just been a part of our lives for many years now he's trying to remember how long it was and we came up with 1995 if you're counting that's 27 years it's been a long time and first met brother Ron and he was evangelizing in that time and and come down to our church and ministered there and the rest has been history we just have a close Bond and a real love for for brother Ron and his family when I first met him all of his children were small now his grandchildren are growing up so this is how long it's been and I was young and my children were small now they're grown up and they have children and so it just time doesn't stop but what's wonderful is to see the same God that we serve then still the same God now and our love hasn't we haven't lost our love for him it's grown stronger and stronger what a day we're living in amen and what a privilege it is to be in this day you know we begin to understand a little bit when when we hear a prophet say that all the sages and all the prophets if they could have chosen what time to live and they'd have took your place they'd have said on the front row they would have been here they would have sung these songs and they'd all said Moses David every one of them say I want to live in this time this is the greatest hour it may be the weakest the darkest the most perverted hour amen but it's because the darkness has been condensed because the light is pressing it and it's going home time Hallelujah and he's not going to lose one of us I'm so glad of that so Hallelujah so God bless you this morning thank you brother Ron we love you with the love of the Lord Brother Andrew amen what a wonderful Pastor you've become we appreciate you both these men have ministered brother Ron many times in our pulpits brother Andrews ministered there and it's been a wonderful blessing and and I mean that I don't just mean they come and preach good sermons but something that changed people's lives and and I know you're a privileged people amen we appreciate brother Jason and the message he brought last night brother Jason's been a friend for not not since 95. you'd have been pretty young then but uh amen but we appreciate him and we certainly enjoyed that message amen there's a couple of times that he was preaching I said Lord stop him because uh not because he was going long but because you know I want to preach something in my notes that I had there already and uh every preacher knows what I'm talking about but uh amen the Lord is good amen let's bow our heads out before you do I also want to say appreciate amen the song that my wife sung I just have to mention it because she don't sing very much anymore she's going to tell me when I get done it's because you don't sing very much anymore and we used to when we was evangelizing we used to go around and sing a lot and and preach and and there's something about when you preach a lot it starts doing something to your voice so amen but I appreciate my wife being able to be here amen so God bless you let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer our heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity that we have for this wonderful group of people father for all all those that I didn't mention that you know each one of them and and I appreciate them I appreciate their friendship appreciate this church this Lighthouse that has been set here Lord the word that goes forth here father we appreciate and thank you for it Lord most of all we thank you for a place that your presence is welcome and moves and is real father we ask you to move again as you we already feel your presence and know you're here you inhabit the Praises of your people you've prepared the hearts for the word of God Lord we want want this morning to be a a moment Lord where the enemy has no place to hide Lord that the people of God is I believe it was mentioned Lord a little bit ago in in the brother giving a testimony that when they know who they are Lord that's what the word comes to do is to show us who we are Lord we ask you to anoint my lips and get me out of the way Lord bless your people anoint their ears I pray any sick or among us and we know as long as we're in these bodies we'll have it that you would touch him this morning any deliverance we know as long as we're in this body we need it you would deliver them this morning we want to say we believe you're the same yesterday today and forever in the name of Jesus Christ we ask amen and amen God bless you if you turn in your Bibles to First John the third chapter and the seventh verse and I also wanted to say that we appreciate brother William mortavon and I found out that you know just about any church I show up and there's a borlavon in it there's even one in mind amen but uh so I told him that he has to come down and visit he's got family there and and uh so we'll look forward to that amen amen amen the family of God is a wonderful family and I'm glad we're not all the same could you imagine if we was and thought if everybody was like me what in the world and be a mess but I'm glad it's not that way amen yes be careful amen I'm preaching with this lapel mic this morning because I found out the other other mic was get very loud and and it forgot time so we're going to try to use this this lapel amen praise the Lord that's not the right thing to say before you preach oh is it amen I want a title this morning the Triumph of the woman's seed the Triumph of the woman's seat I've been ministering for quite some time on a subject to home called The Trail Of The Serpent and this is something in the course of the those services that the Lord brought me to and we just want to the help of the Lord as we studying on this this uh Saturday and uh just bring it to you this morning amen First John 3 the 7th verse little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil's sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because because he is born of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother amen you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word at the time of the writing sure it's been somewhere around are over 4 000 years since the prophecy that was made in the Garden of Eden the Lord speaking to the serpent and and he would tell him that I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel that prophecy came forth in a very dark hour it came forth when the condition was upon Adam and Eve a Darkness had come it was a fallen condition it was man had lost the consciousness of his presence they had lost their their their Estates they didn't know who they were anymore now they was in fear of God and they made themselves the Fig leaves to cover themselves up amen but they needed somebody greater than them to come down and begin to show them amen that's not the covering I accept and and that's not the way it's going to be and and he spoke a prophecy in that moment and and he spoke it to the serpent and he spoke it to the woman that there will be enmity between your seed amen but amen the woman's seed will bruise amen the the head of The Serpent and the serpent will bruise the heel of of the uh of the woman's seed so we see that has been that enmity and there's been that conflict since the beginning of time and that conflict never stopped at Calvary amen but it moved on because amen the woman's seed would have a seed amen now we understand that amen the New Testament without the Old Testament it's not going to be understood amen and neither without the Old Testament without the New Testament the Old Testament cannot know its fulfillment so to take both of them they come become a whole amen and then to take both of them you see the full revelation of who Jesus Christ is amen the Old Testament was amen the prophecy gone forth he is coming he is coming he is coming the New Testament has been he is here he has been here he was here he was here and not just speaking it but validating it and conferring it praise the name of the Lord we've come to a special time amen and if you bear with me this morning I'm going to move I'm in pretty fast we have we have come to a special time this time is called Harvest Time not just the Harvest of a of an age but the Harvest of the world is that right and two vines that grew together from the Garden of Eden and had enmity with one another intertwined amen has come all the way down to this time and they have come to their Harvest time and it is the time of Separation that's the time we're living in now the time of Separation one is separating to their Harvest and the other is separating to their Harvest praise the name of the Lord one is being bound and taken away the other has been gathered together amen so the combine can come and pick us up that's why we're here praise the name of the Lord amen the prophet of God said that those fruits of those Vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate Garners and the two spirits will go to their separate destinations now we can going all the way back to the Garden of Eden I know I mean this has been a controversial subject amen through through the church ages amen but it took a prophet to come Amen in the Holy Spirit to show him and bring to light amen that the seed of the serpent that came in the Book of Genesis he was born and I want you to notice he was born apart amen from human male instrumentality right amen the the seed and the serpent came amen apart from human male uh instrumentality and then in the Book of Luke we find the exact account how the seed of the woman came apart amen from human male instrumentality amen one came by the by Satan and the other one came by the Holy Ghost two spirits amen one produced what we know and called serpent seat and you have to be careful what you call serpent seat amen because you look like serpent seat you say no not me I I wore a long dress on my life I had long hair on my life it's not that it's not a put on Holiness and it's not what you've done amen that makes you who you are it's who you accept it that makes you who you are I want to tell you something this morning you can stand in a place where the devil amen will not know what to do with you because there's not a part of your life amen that has not been uncovered by the Holy Ghost hey man that's the hour we're living in if this is the hour of the Harvest amen we have come to our fruition amen we have the fruits have come to the top [Music] it is here that God vindicates Amen what is prophecy was from the very beginning if it had stopped in Jesus Christ it would not have been enough but he came so that he could bring many sons unto God [Music] and those sons that would come to God for many of them they would look like they came from the other side they would talk like they would come from the other side they would act like they came from the other side now the woman Eve she thought that that Cain came from God and you will find that there's a long time the prophet said that it took her a while to understand that Cain did not come from God the life that he had The Gift of Life came from God but the seed did not come from God you know perhaps she was confused because she looked at Cain and Abel and she said when Cain was born I've gotten a man from the Lord and then amen when the scripture says and then she bear Abel and she never said that about Abel but she said it about Cain which shows the the church amen is confused about the life and where it comes from and I read you the scripture first John he said he that is uh committed sin is of the devil now what is John talking about he's talking about two births he's talking about one that is born in sin and he's talking another one about a new birth that's what he's talking about every one of you were partakers of the first one there's not a person in here including every one of us sitting on the platform to say we were exempt from being born in sin shaping an iniquity come to the world speaking lies every one of us came like that amen the way of sin was already in us the habits of sin the hereditary things the ancestral things was already in US amen and we were committing sin and we were of the devil in our life but not in our election in our life but not in our election Amen in our election would become known by the word that was sent to the age [Applause] that's the only way we could know what election was is if the voice of God had a special sound to us in our heart and it might have took a long time for you as a Son of God to recognize that voice you might have confused that voice with the preacher or somebody else but one day you realized it was not the high priest it was the voice of God that has been speaking to you all along blessed be the name of the Lord amen and that enemy that held you could not keep you what what came out of what came out of of of Eve what come out of the out of her womb it was named Cain grew listen that mankane had the opportunity just like you and I have the opportunity to be serpent seed does not mean you do not hear the message of your hour he heard his message face to face with God felt the presence of God heard the voice of God and knew the will of God [Applause] come on but to him it was another Sunday morning sermon another Thou shalt not do this or Thou shalt not do that and who are you to tell me that I should act like my brother you see because God told him amen he said if you give a sacrifice like your brother gave a sacrifice I will accept you what a mercy that God would tell serpency amen the serpent son I will accept you God wasn't playing with words God was not saying I don't really mean that when he told the Serpent's son I will accept you that man I will give you the benefit of my presence I'll give you the benefit of my healing I'll give you the benefit of my attributes I'll even save you [Applause] hello but in the presence of God Cain could not accept it and when it came when the when the satanic Spirit came from Heaven to Earth it had even more of a Defiance on Earth than it even had in heaven because the characteristics of Cain his utter defiance in the presence of God that he would speak back to God the way he did wouldn't and and and he was willing hey man he was willing to to break the word of God and kill his brother you find the accountant amen you find here in the in the Book of Genesis the third chapter in the fourth chapter amen you find excuse me I'm over 50 I got to get my breath you'll find amen the mark of the beast amen placed upon a man and what did the prophets say it was the mark of the beast was a man went out from the presence of the Lord and could never hear his word again to receive it the Bible says the soul that sinneth thy Soul shall die what that means the very desire to hear it the effect of it will have no effect upon your desire anymore your soul becomes so hard amen that the word would have no effect that's why it's a blessing brother and sister amen that you stand in the presence of the Lord and it moves you and he's not here just to move you and to excite you we all love that hey I came out of a church and didn't even believe in saying amen so we love it we love to be moved by the Holy Spirit but if there's Holy Spirit he leads us he's got a goal [Music] [Applause] amen if you're here sick he wants to lead you amen from sickness unto Health if you're here and you're not believing he wants to lead you from doubt to belief that's what the holy spirit is here for hey man just to just to uh to make a make a declaration of what what God came to do he said now when man was made in the image of God a man was Jesus Christ and God came down in the image of man to redeem man and that brought man and God together Heaven and Earth hugged and kissed each other God and man embraced each other as fatherhood and sonship when the logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us right Jesus could say I come from God and I go back to God and after his death and burial and resurrection and Ascension when the body was taken up he said at the right hand of God now it doesn't mean that God's got a right hand because God is a spirit amen but what it means that all power and authority of God is in Jesus Christ that every name everything in heaven is named after it and subject to it everything in Earth is named after it and subject to it it's a name above all names Jesus Christ now the logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is Anointed with the same logos now we see the purpose of God Amen was to bring you Amen to the place amen that you would understand you are anointed with the same word because that's the logos you're Anointed with the same word that was in him now I have the right then if I'm Anointed with the same word the same same word that Jesus Christ is I have the right thing to recognize Satan and who he is and tell him what to do well Satan will understand about you that he has certain rights about your flesh he can still make you sick he can still Place doubts in your mind come on I had a man tell me the other day he said I know the thoughts I have are from Jesus Christ because Satan doesn't know my thoughts I said man you sure don't know Satan come on yeah Satan knows how to put thoughts this is the greatest I tell you I figured out brother that man never listened to greatest battle ever fought did I say fault of thought amen it's the same thing amen because amen this is the Battleground this is the place of neutrality amen where God and Satan chose to make your mind the battleground of their thoughts that Satan would Place thoughts there you can never be healed you can never be delivered you can't have the Holy Ghost it's not for you and God would place his word there I came I healed you I sent my words come on you're under my delivering power right now amen I am here to set you free and Satan will say no he's not and God will say yes I am and whichever way you choose that's the way it's going to be this morning God did not come here just to have a protracted service but he gave every minister of this age an Open Door of word and power amen and he expects a harvest of that word Satan right now amen is being robbed of his subjects because hell has been conquered death has been conquered the grave has been conquered there's not a place in life that Jesus Christ never conquered I can meet it this morning then and know amen I am more than a conqueror amen I can do all things through Christ foreign I don't even know how to get my coat off this morning in Mennonite Church they never taught us how to take our coat off Now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself this is what his spirit is doing this morning God the Creator created himself a part of the creation this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose now John said this is his purpose that he would be manifested that we would destroy the works of the devil this purpose took form through election that is why I love this statement that the prophet said that is why he could look down all the way to the last age amen when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church not the church that put him out but the church that glorifies him they would still see him there as the author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power is bringing it to pass and I love what brother Ram said about the Sovereign will of God nobody can tell him what to do nobody can say he's not worthy of that salvation or amen you shouldn't forgive a man like that and that person over there strung out for years he don't have no right to Deliverance or that person over there with a sex habit he has no way of Deliverance you see it's not based on your flesh it's not based on your worthiness it's based on Jesus Christ I am not saved in myself I am saved through Jesus Christ if I'm speaking to somebody like that we give notice to the enemy this morning amen you're losing another subject devil will tell you you've done too much you've marked yourself up you've lost your your virtue you have no right you there's nobody gonna love you I want you to know the Bible said when you were yet in sin amen he died for you even how can I love him because he first loved me he loved me so much that he would allow me to preach a message of Love Back to his children we are not going to settle for less brother and sister we're going to take all that the Holy Spirit has blessed be the name of the Lord I could look all the way down into this age and still see his church giving him glory [Applause] all right Jesus said the works I do you shall do also we've seen the church lay hands on the sick we see Devils come out at the mention of his name we see people shout and rejoice and speak in a new tongue we see all these things but that's not the only works Jesus done amen one of his Works was get behind me Satan you shall not tempt the Lord thy God Amen he knew when Satan was quoting the word wrong [Applause] I just want to make a statement amen that when Jesus met him on the mountain he met him for you and when he met him on the mountain after 40 days Jesus was at his weak as Satan was at a strongest and suicidal thoughts and thoughts of glory and and hunger was consuming him Satan began to talk to him begin to tempt him I want you to know every time Jesus answered there's three accounts brother Benham said it directly corresponds amen with the Temptation and the fall in the garden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes amen and the pride of life every one of them give your life glory and and and the sin the lust of the flesh amen indulge those appetites first oh man all these things were flooding Jesus Christ amen if you go back and read those accounts of Jesus answering Satan he only answered him out of one book he only took a few a few verses out of the book of Deuteronomy and there is some dispute that that is even enough an authentic book I love that that God would take something that the scholars would doubt would be authentic and God would take it [Applause] [Music] in just a few verses amen he didn't take the whole Bible he took a few verses and defeated Satan [Applause] amen what if you as a church turn the full power of the word upon the enemy this morning I'm not just turning on in Deuteronomy 8 or one of these verses I can turn upon Him Isaiah 53 I can turn upon Him Isaiah 61. I can turn upon Him Malachi 4 I can turn upon Him Luke 17 30. I can turn upon Him Revelations 10 7. full barrels drop the bomb [Applause] foreign Hallelujah now Jesus said the works I do you shall do also see amen the same God the works I do more than this for I go into my father the church will be a little longer in the light vindicating his promised word Jesus was here for just a short period of time and his life made such an impact on Earth that he split time into what Jesus did not come to live he came to die so that we could live this morning somebody totally different than any other man he came to die from the beginning he was telling them I if I be lifted up the son of man must be lifted up he kept telling him I have come to die in other words I have come to take your place oh we need a savior to Deliver Us from Rome no you need a savior to deliver you from Hell amen raw hell is much greater than Rome Rome is just an attribute of hell amen but it's not the Final Destination so now the prophet says that the church will be a little longer in the light see as God did his promises in Christ's body so is Christ doing his same Works in his body the church now making his mystery known to his bride tree in the last day bringing forth the fruits that was in the tree at the beginning well I tell you this this is the holy spirit's leading this is what he's doing he said then he goes on to say that the bride body must follow the head for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery you know people said here and they will spend all their lives trying to figure out the mystery and the prophet said you're part of it you are part of the mystery amen it's how God has revealed himself here and raised up the body by the word so he Reveals His church and he raises her up by the same word it's part of his threefold mystery now I know you're well taught here and you've listened to the to the message brother Branham said that three-fold mystery you'll find that in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said number one it was to reveal himself in Christ God above us amen couldn't be understood or or felt but God wanted to be known God wanted to be more than just this great being who was above them that could not be understood he wanted to come and rub shoulders and be a part of the Affliction and and it'd even be said of him amen that he um and I wish I could remember what was said of him the one scripture about our afflictions what is it see they don't know that you know preachers are the most least informed people on the face of the earth when they're up here sometimes amen I hate it when a preacher turns to me and says where is that chapter because I can't think of it then but I knew it but I can't think of it amen but the Bible said he tasted the same things you tasted that you have a high priest who is touched by the feeling of your infirmities he knows exactly and that's not mean that he just he just knows yours brother Shannon it means he knows yours and he knows yours and he knows yours you can go down the line there's not a person in this room that has escaped his understanding [Applause] I don't even care if it's the perversion of this age you know the lgbq2 VW X double z double z whatever I mean they keep adding alphabets they want to take over the whole alphabet they can't do it amen I'll let you know even people even people Bound in that amen it's just something that questions where they came from they don't know who they are it's a spirit it's a perverted spirit that does you might say I'll never be like that but if you're sitting here amen and you don't want to give up your old ideas you don't know who you are either you know amen you say you men you men would say I'll never be like a woman but yet you won't give up your Baptist ideas which is a church come on you might be big Burly and wear denim but amen amen there's still something in there that should be taken out the only thing that a dude is a baptism of the Holy Ghost under the message of the hour Amen to let you understand Jesus knew exactly who he was they tried to tell him he was born a fornication they tried to call him a devil your bl's above you're this we know about you he said I come from God I go back to God I know where I came from I know where I'm going and every seed of God can sit here this morning and say the same thing that's revealing himself revealing himself yeah let me come back to the lgbq2 do whatever ninja I mean even listen I know it sounds funny but even in this hour you can be a cat you can be a box you can be whatever you want it's demonic perversion and Invasion that has taken over so-called intelligent people amen man what it does they open their mouth and they fulfill prophecy amen all they should say is I'm from Sodom I'm from Sodom I'm from Sodom this is the days of Noah this is the days of Noah that's really what they're saying but yet because it's of laodicea and because it's of this present Darkness it catches seeds seeds amen that can't help what time in bed they're planted in what families they raise up in I want to say something it's always great to me and no I don't remember what exactly chapter it was in the book of Exodus but you'll go find it you remember when it was when Moses went down and told them let my people go that they may serve me Pharaoh stood up and he said I'm not going to let him go and I don't know your God you know amen it was an age they didn't know who who God was because they didn't know his power so it just seemed it just seemed like it was something randomly placed in the scripture because then right in the same chapter I think it's around chapter six somewhere around there amen you go look it up for yourself and and right there it places a genealogy it's amazing pharah says I'm not going to let him go and then God begins to give the genealogies of the Levites oh well what in the world has that got to do with this Satan just made a huge claim I'm not letting them go and God wants to count people don't even make sense to me why would God want to count people when Satan says I'm not letting you go I'll tell you exactly why because God knows exactly who's his and this is way of saying amen this is mine this one comes from this one this one comes from that one that one comes from this one that one comes from that one Satan said I'm not letting you go and God said this one came for me this one came from me this one came from me this one came from me this one came from me this one came from me amen there is nothing going to stop the election of God nothing no drugs no sin no devil Satan himself all the powers of Hell nothing will stop the election [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord I had a brother tell me this a pastor he's dealing with a situation in his church or where a uh one of his members was caught having an affair with another man both of these men were married one was from The Message Church one was from a denomination both of these men did not want to be in their situation they was in they wanted to be free they were secretly secretly getting counsel going to family helps or psychologists or whoever they were going to to try try to get help and nothing would change for them and then it began to be exposed then it began to came out you understand both these men were family men had children you understand the effect the bomb effect the bombshell effect what it would do on those children you see when Satan is afflicting you he's actually trying to afflict your heritage because he wants it to be a testimony they had the Bible it didn't work they had the message it didn't stop them from committing adultery that's what he does is he puts everything on display like Samson in the Wheelhouse grinding for the enemy amen with his eyes put out here's this great warrior now as a trophy and what did they say our God has got the victory over Jehovah it's always Satan's purpose our God the world is more powerful so this this came out and this pastor's testimony was he was talking to this man in his congregation on the phone and this man was complaining about his situation nobody understands that's one thing the devil wants to afflict you with it and I in in a pastoral position I'm sure you've heard it here it might be something exclusive to Florida I don't know where people tell me you don't understand and I always tell them and if I and they say that because they're saying I didn't go through that I you're not the one that committed adultery I'm the one that committed auction I always want to tell them you're right if I did I would not be here and you wouldn't be talking to me so why complain to me like that you're wasting time but you should understand that I represent one who has all the answers I am not going to point to you brother William to a plaque on the wall and tell you where I learned it I'm going to point to you the one who sent his word and healed your disease so that's an Affliction well it's Affliction of the righteous you don't understand it's really an excuse and that's actually satanic talk saying I don't want to be free because if it can say the pastor don't even understand well we'll find a sympathizing devil that'll go along with it and say yeah we knew he never understood that guy you see that's the devil that's the trail of the serpent that he hides upon see that was one of the Mysteries spoken of in proverbs 30 that that that man by the name agor he gave he said one of the four things that are wonderful too wonderful for him is one of them was a serpent upon a rock a way it's just hid it just leaves no trail of his passing but there's one who doesn't know that trail and it's the Holy Spirit and so this Pastor said I I began to tell that man that man's saying you don't understand what it's like to be attracted to another man and and the pastor says you're right you're right I don't understand he said right at that time I felt the Holy Spirit tap me on the shoulder and say you tell him I understand no no Holy Spirit wouldn't understand what it's like to be tempted by homosexuality Woody Woody and what did it mean in the Bible it says all manner yet without sin in other words that Spirit of that age presented itself to Jesus in a provocative and attractive manner and Jesus met him with thus saith the Lord [Music] all right I want you to know the power of the word when that Pastor followed what the holy because that's a strange one it's a challenge for a pastor to say that when that Pastor followed the leading of the Holy Spirit you tell him you tell him I understand when he repeated that to that man that the Holy Spirit just told me to tell you phone went quiet then he began to hear that man break up begin to weep then the Holy Spirit came in and totally delivered that man now I want to say something else it didn't just deliver that man it delivered the damn both of those men went and stood in their home pulpits and and repented to the church for their sin and God restored both of those men and that man's testimony was we've spent hours in the in the offices of these medical professionals and we've not got any help but five minutes in the presence of God I want you to know I'm in the presence of a god that'll just point a finger and the demons will flee every devil is subject to the name Jesus Christ don't say that name Jesus Christ don't say that name Jesus Christ they cannot stand before the power of that name the prophet said that we are his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days we are his body the manifested truth of his promised word to his last days this was brother branham's way of saying the same thing that Paul said you are living Epistles read and known of all men people know amen what Paul believes by the way you live now Christ was manifested to destroy the works of the devil you believe that amen he was manifested to destroy his works who was he God's word which destroys the hybrid The Works of the devil is that right he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil now his body is to do the same because the body is head and body together if Christ is ahead is the word his body has to be the same thing amen the head was and if he amen was born of the word virgin born of the word not denominational but virgin born from the word but now amen we know that when sinning entered in is separated man from his entire expression from his presence that's what sin and death did but God said I have an age this last stage is to prove Amen to Satan you want to know what's going on right now you want to know why we have the struggles and the sicknesses and the attacks and the trials oh I've asked God to heal me and I asked him two years ago he healed you two years ago in fact he healed you at Calvary let's just face it then why why brother Madam said if God would give you everything that you ask right when you asked for it he said it would make you impatient with him but there's something in the trying of your asking when you ask and then you stand and believe Abraham where's your baby it's in that box of diapers right there really open it up well I see and there's diapers that's my testimony he's a coming [Applause] 25 years that's a lot of diapers you know I don't know how Abraham done it maybe he did a diaper a year or a diaper a month just to prove to Sarah we're still going to have it go get some Pampers you know just that's going to be your belief Sarah you you're you're fighting with me you're fussing you're saying that I'm getting older it's getting past time it's not going to work go buy a box of diapers can you imagine Sarah well I don't know how their stores looked back then just a few years after that I'm sitting here here you have Sister Sarah I have none but I will have many that's what my box of diapers say yeah you see you just got to keep on doing it because this age is to prove to Satan that this church is not like Eve Eve gave up at a wrong interpretation and then she added to the word go read what she said she said something God never said but here here is his this bride who believes the word if he said my family is going to be saved that's what I'm going to say then I'm not going to talk about where my daughter's at I'm going to talk about how I'm going to read my genealogy come on Church Hall you know my daughter she's in sin she's she's a lesbian she's this she's that let's talk about what our genealogy says you know so-and-so's on drugs you know he was wounded for our transgressions in fact I'm gonna I want to read something to you here I'm on a timer Jason amen this bride I want to make a statement about this church I want to make this statement about you because this is where your faith is you are not like Eve you you might say well if I was in a perfect church with a perfect pastor but you're close to perfect brother Rob I mean you are perfect in him I'm talking like people talk all right if I wasn't a perfect church I if I was if with a perfect bunch of people where there's never any trouble no trials if I had the perfect job if I had this I would serve God we'll ask Eve how that worked out she was in a paradise she had a perfect husband I I've got my glasses off I can't see expressions perfect Paradise perfect husband presence of God deceived and God said I'm going to take the most perverted age the most perverted people at the weakest time and I'm going to have a group of people amen that are going to serve me and they're going to believe me and they're going to prove amen we are not like ease foreign oh you want that perfect Church where nobody amen has trouble with anybody else but you need to talk to Paul and see how that worked out he said I have trouble in the church I had trouble in the city I had trouble in the wilderness I had trouble in the Deep amen I was amen I was Shipwrecked amen three times amen I was left for dead stoned and left for dead I was a basket case in Damascus but he was always with me and he never left me I was amongst false Brethren I had the care of the church and Paul never gave up Paul's last words was he stood with me and delivered me from the life of the Lion blessed be the name of the Lord you're not going to give up you're not going to fall he has presented you spotless [Applause] your son or daughter of God he knew what age you'd be in new at times in fact the prophet would prophesy over this seed and said she's manifested to meet the challenge of this hour it's not your vote at the voting booth it's going to change it it's your life that is lived by the word that is making ripples that is pushing back hell Isaiah said in Isaiah 61 10 he said I will greatly rejoice in the Lord my soul shall be joyful in my God for he hath clothed me with garments of Salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom dick of himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels he has clothed me he has put the robe of Salvation upon me she's presented in a way that the people of that age would know she's the bride amen so Paul said Christ has presented himself a bride Amen to present means somebody to stand beside him amen it means to provide one to see and to question God has provided a vessel in this age that can be questioned you gonna leave too see the questions you don't get to write them we would love that wouldn't we are you going to leave too your best friend left and you know they were a stronger Christian than you were and you know if she left You're Gonna Leave but we have an answer to the devil's question it's not me that liveth but it's Christ the name of the Lord amen I'm going to start my message now so I can close it now my got a good church to preach to brother Ron God bless you it's a credit people hungry to hear the word not hungry just go out and eat your callings your purpose it's not only to expose The Works of the devil but it's to see the purpose of God in election in his calling that it will not fail you might look well well how how long does these conditions Gonna Last you know the devil wants you to battle with do you have enough Faith do you not have enough enough faith faith is presented in your standing right right come on brother Branham we all know the story him raising the little dead baby in Mexico that little mother baby was declared dead that morning she waited till that evening and there wasn't a line of ushers that could stop that mother from getting there and her faith produced a vision a little baby hung right out there above the congregation smiling no teeth yeah brother Brown was going to have Brother Moore go pray for that little what's that sure not know who it is he hadn't called it that's when God showed him the vision that woman's Faith produced that vision brother Branham prayed for that baby in that stiff dead form kicked and began to cry everybody else thinks my baby should be the same but you were not that little Mexican girl you're you and you don't get to choose how it comes at you you do get to choose how you respond Julius stadscliff him and his wife have a little baby there in Germany a baby's sick and it dies they have faith in brother Branham and his ministry that God answers his prayer and they had enough faith that they persuaded those doctors to keep that baby under an oxygen tent preserve that baby so that brother Branham could fly over from America to Germany and pray for this baby and this baby they knew would race from the dead brother Branham prayed and asked the Lord what to do and God told him that's the hand of God don't touch it this wasn't in Mexico this is now in Germany and you can't always reproduce Mexico in Germany our Germany in Mexico it's what God is choosing to do that'll help the people the most [Music] because God knew if I raised every baby uh that was dead and then one wasn't raised that person would leave they would lose hope Lord told him don't touch it brother Branham called him and said Lord told me not to go sister statscliff asked brother Brennan said brother Branham was it because I didn't have enough faith is that why God said no is that why God said don't fly all the way over there you're wasting your time she don't have enough faith for this brother Brahm says no you have great faith he said it's easy to have faith when everything's going the right way but when everything's coming against you and you're still saying I believe he can be raised did you have great faith brother Branham wrote a letter to them I have the letter not not the actual letter but I have the copy and brother she gone thought enough to explain to explain why this happened and brother Branham he didn't know everything but he told him in this letter you know the Lord knew what lay down the road and he began to relate his own experiences and he began to tell him about his wife passing and then his little baby now you imagine the the love of a father looking down at a baby suffering so hard his her eyes are crossed and she's dying there's no hope and he's laid in hands and and God refuses to hear him will not answer his prayer and then the devil moves up said after all you've done for God you prayed for the sick God healed him you did this you did that and and God won't now it's your own baby and God won't listen to you he's absolutely refuse you and it was not at a high time of brother Brown's life it was at the lowest time of his life he lost his wife his daddy had died his brother had died his church was dwindling now his baby's dying and Satan moved up and said after all you've done and then he tempted him you ought to just quit LeBron said everything the devil was telling me was the truth these things that happen in his ministry everything he's telling me is the truth and I opened up my mouth to say if that's the way it's going to be then I'm no longer serving it was his thought it was his energy to leave the message God had given him that's the way he said but when I opened up my mouth something down here came up and said William Branham who are you anyhow and then what God did is he showed him his grace to even save him and it changed see this is what the president Lord would do it changed how he thought about it and he laid his hand said I'll see you soon honey now why did that happen to brother Branham why did he have to see his little baby suffer and die and then now he's writing this in the letter to the stats Cliffs he said and I was asked a while back could I I he said I was sitting on the hill and seeing something asked me could you go through this again Could you actually go through that trouble again all that you lost Could you actually go and live it over and he said I'm thinking to myself I couldn't do it then I remembered all the thousands of babies that God healed because of my experience with Sharon Rose that there wasn't another cross-eyed baby that I came in the presence of that God didn't heal because of my experience in that room [Applause] Vernon wrote to him yes said yes I do it all over again you know why because every soul is worth ten thousand words far greater than the trials and afflictions of this Earthly Journey that we're in [Applause] God's using your journey for an eternal purpose Hallelujah brother Ron he's using your journey he's using your journey brother Dave yay to the least have an impact Satan Can't Stop we see Jesus when he came he came exactly according to the word submitting himself exactly to the word he didn't come say I'm the one you've waited for and I'll do whatever I want because of who I am he came and had submitted himself he would not have been Jesus if he'd done that but he humbled himself and took on the form of man and and he humbled himself to the word submitted himself to the word of the hour to be washed in the Jordan suffer it to be so for me cometh us to fulfill our righteousness and he became the matchpiece of every believer fulfilling every Old Testament type he was Moses on the mountain he was David in the valley amen he was Daniel Under Pressure come on Church he'd been in the water he'd been in the fire he'd been on the mountain been in every trial he was Joseph in prison he was Abraham believing come on Church he was a he was the first Adam amen we know what Adam was like in the beginning because Jesus is called the second Adam Adam could walk on water Adam could stop the wind sick and Adam come he walked on water he stopped the winds and the waves peace be still there wasn't a demon that come in his presence he didn't know what to do with them [Applause] [Music] and once you notice and he never healed any of them the same go read your accounts of all the Blind Men that got healed he didn't heal them the same one he told to go Washington to pull us alone spit on the ground put mud on his eyes go wash him to pull us alone the other one he took out of the city of Therese and he took him out let him out by the hand prayed for him and asked what he saw and pray for him again amen he had to get him out of that City because he'd already cursed that City had to lead him out to where his healing was you want to be healed in something cursed it's not going to work you'll go right back to what made you blind but God let him out told the lepers one leper said I know you can heal me if thou will Jesus said I will be Thou made hold he's made whole ten lepers come to him will you heal us he said go back to your priest and show yourself do exactly what the word says and when they turned and went and obeyed they were healed while they walked you don't get to tell him how he does it you get to believe him you get to say he is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] the prophet said he fulfilled every type the Bible says he fulfilled every time there was no man like him and he is the match piece of the Bible he is the match peace to every believer we can see him in David David the adulterer David the murderer I don't see Jesus in that but I see Jesus in his repentance in his steadfastness to get back to the word I didn't see Jesus when Moses was rebelling and and and and and breaking the word by smiting The Rock twice but I saw him in Moses when he came down with the Commandments and so it's been said of old times I can see him in every because he's the match piece of every believer of the Old Testament and if he is the match piece of every believer there he is the match piece of every believer here you know you spend a lot of time talking about the negative I I did this and I did that and I did it and it's hard you can't see Jesus there but look what he came to do let's see let's see this Mass peace Jesus was different than whatever Satan wanted to try to put in I just want to drop a thought in here is everybody still awake if you're still awake say Amen one two three four five people counting the Deacon I'm glad the deacons are awake amen are you guys awake just a little bit longer my watch hasn't gone oh no I got 18 minutes remaining who gets to set the time brother Brandon said he preached a message called kinsman redeemer he says what is a redeemer how does he become a redeemer and remember a redeemer redeems you completely he redeems you he don't he don't redeem you so you can be a member in the church right and have a party Doctrine no he don't redeem you to that he redeems you from your sin he redeems you from your sickness he redeems you from everything that's wrong he is a Redeemer turn with me in your Bible's most feared words of heard at the end of a service turn with me in your Bibles to Ruth the fourth chapter and our reason I said most feared words because Satan doesn't like it you don't want to see a nail clenched he wants you to leave here with doubt you see in every Revival there's a twin can anybody in here in here tell me what Adam and Eve and Abraham and Sarah and Jacob and Rebecca had in common anybody tell me Cain Ishmael and Esau oh wait a minute I thought he's going to say Abel Isaac thank you huh and Jacob I'll wait a minute no I did mess up didn't I Isaac and Rebecca know Jacob didn't marry his own mother maybe in his age whoo he redeems us from all wrong wow remember I corrected it yeah why didn't you help me man they each they each brought forth a twin that interacted with the revelation of the hour do you know Jesus had a twin it was Judas do you know the Holy Spirit has a twin it's the Antichrist and that's why the scripture that I read in first John is like he that committeth Sinners of the devil he that is born of God cannot commit sin he's talking about twins that's why brother Madison power of transformation he said he said the deception this hour is a Pentecostal move what is a Pentecostal move he's talking about the birth of the supernatural the deception is in the birth Satan will come with a false birth God comes with the true come on every birth is sovereign amen so now route 4. then went Boaz up to the gate set him down there and behold the Kinsmen of whom Boaz spoke of came by so that means there's been something going on in the previous chapters boy as it told told Ruth there's a near Kinsman than I Ruth had made a claim upon boys went and laid at his feet Boaz when he saw her faith he gave her six measures of barley said you're not going to go back empty every time you come to God you'll never go back empty boy as is a type of a redeemer amen he is a kinsman redeemer he's at Harvest time it's in the Book of Judges the most perverted time in the Bible of the Old Testament but he told her there's another Kinsman and I'm going to deal with him and so he he called out as this Kinsman he went and sat by the gate and he called out to this Kinsman he said hold such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and said down I love it that day never the writer of this never writes down who that Kinsman was I love it that he would not mention his name he's not worthy of it because he can't do the work so don't keep toiling out his name don't give the credit to the one who don't deserve it and he says such a one say here by me and he took ten Elders of the city and they sat down and they sat down and he said unto the to the Kinsmen Naomi is coming in out of the country of Moab sells a parcel of land which was our brother a limilex and he said unto the Kinsman Naomi that has come out again of the country of Moab selleth the parcel of land which was our brother elimilex I put it down twice and I don't know why well the Lord want me to read it twice all right and I thought to advertise he's saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the Elders of my people if you will redeem it redeem it but if you're not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I'm after thee and there's no name man this nearer Kinsmen said I will redeem it why would he say that because although hasn't said is there some land and Satan can read can take land because it's already cursed come on and you are born in sin you are shaping iniquity this land is cursed he can take what is cursed praise come on now Boaz is going right by the Word of Promise that Moses has wrote down the law of Moses how to get the land back he he is he is repeating it back to the elders and repeating it back to to this no-name Kinsman and he's saying this is what the word says this is a near a Kinsmen of yours they have a parcel land they were in Moab he is dead Naomi's back here this land has been sold can you redeem this land to her inheritance he said yeah I can do that I'll take that land then said Boaz when you buy that field from the hand in the homie you must also buy this Ruth the moabitus the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead you have got to bring sons that I should have been there in the first place you have to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance and the Kinsmen said I cannot redeem it for myself lest I Mar my own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for I cannot redeem it then why do we allow Satan become our closest friend when he has already testified I cannot redeem them I can get you sick but I can't heal you I can get you in prison but I can't open the door amen I can take your children and bring the sins amen and make them magnified in their life but I Know a Man who stepped up to the plate in the hour of the Gentile bride and said I'll redeem you don't worry Ruth just rest there with the barley that I gave you I'll redeem you oh I think about that moment I'm closing but I think about that moment Ruth and Naomi's sitting there watching I'm in a chair and they're watching what is he saying he's given him the opportunity redeem it but you know amen my Lord the lord of the Harvest knows that nearer Kinsmen better than I could ever know him and he knows what he's capable of and what he's not capable of yeah hey man you can lay claim to a land that's already poisoned and a land that's already afflicted Jesus say that's my land that's what he offered Satan excuse me what he offered Jesus I'll give you the glory of these kingdoms I'll give you all of this if you just fall down and worship me but Jesus the Lord of the Harvest our Boaz he knew what he was coming into and he knew that Satan could not redeem a gentile bride Satan has no message for you that'll set you free that'll give you the Holy Ghost that'll save your children amen that'll fill you full of the joy of the strength of the Lord [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord I cannot redeem it brother William he cannot redeem your children I could not save your soul I can make your job hard I can make your body sick as I I can squat on the land and I can affect the land but I can't get that soul the profits all stood up there's a gentile Rod coming there's a gentile bride coming he loves a gentile woman you know Boaz ever been said Boaz you get to choose what's time you're living in but the requirement of that time is you got to marry a gentile woman not me Lord I want to marry you now you're going to live in that time and you're going to love her and you're going to raise up seed that should have been there in the first place here's Boaz he's forcing the issue with this no-name person come on and this person opened I can't redeem it I cannot redeem it I love this because there's a prophecy all the way from Genesis coming out in this story you know Boaz told him take off your shoe then you don't own it no more give a public testimony that you cannot redeem this woman now we don't see it happening here but the book of Deuteronomy Moses wrote said if a man refuses to raise up to take that inheritance and raise up seed then the woman who is rejected she gets to spit in his face you're not worthy to raise up the seed of my family you're not worthy of me take off your shoes Satan take it off throw it on the ground hop around like The Afflicted person you are you have no right to a son or daughter of God you have no power over them my redeemer has already come my redeemer has already paid the price about Redemption this message is all about Redemption the open book is all about Redemption Revelation 10 it's the book of redemption [Applause] if you see somebody hopping through real quick it's that devil he's lost a shoe [Music] come on he can't walk real comfortable around children of God I can't well you know if I have both shoes on I can have some confidence but man he told me take off your shoe I've been anointed in this hedge to bruise Satan under my feet and to let him know I am the one they prophesied up I'm part of that body blessed be the name of the Lord hey Ruth the moabitus Ruth the Gentile Ruth who should have nothing with the inheritance Ruther should have nothing with the promise of the Messiah but God brought her in Into The Inheritance he didn't only bring her in he married her and he made statements over her all our city does know you're a virtuous woman foreign don't you know the word has said the same thing in this hour the prophet stood up in a Pulpit in Shreveport Louisiana said she is the pure virtuous pride of Jesus Christ never done it in the first place there it goes blessed be the name of the Lord who was his name back there in chapter four we don't know it's not worth writing it down let me tell you about Boaz he's the lord of the Harvest he's the owner of the fields he drops he drops handfuls of purpose in my path just to encourage me let him know and then he tells me don't leave that field come on don't leave that field s oh I talked to a girl the other day who come and she told me bless her heart said my best friend left the message this year and said I I'm being I I'm just being just being assaulted with with doubts and so forth that I need the Lord to confirm this message to me and I said I want you to know if you'll let him he'll do it I said but don't look for the positive amongst the negative quit going to that no-name Kinsmen and seeking out his advice what does he know about
