just go to the Lord in prayer this morning Heavenly Father we approach you father Lord with humility in our heart Lord Jesus and expectation as well father Lord we we come father and we ask Lord that you would break us father and put us back together Lord Lord as as it were the prophet would say Lord we put us back on The Potter's will father mold us into thy thine image Lord Jesus we don't want to be conformed to this world but we want to be transformed Lord Lord we want to match you father in every aspect of our life Lord we want our speech our conversation our our actions Lord to express you father and Lord if there's anything unlike you father in our life Lord we just want to we just want to surrender it to you Lord that we could be a vessel father Lord a vessel Lord Jesus that you could use for your service today Lord God we commit oursel to you father I know know that standing before me is a needy people just like myself Lord that needs a a Special Touch from you today Lord and we've gathered here in your house Lord and Lord we we come boldly before you and ask Lord that the mighty Angel would begin to begin to minister to us and help us along life's way Lord I pray that you'd break open the scriptures father Lord and may we see you father Lord we don't want to miss what you're doing along the way I know that these are Moder and events that are being made clear by prophecy I know that you're walking with us I know that maybe we don't understand everything but Lord I I pray that we would get so shut in with you Lord Jesus and we would compel you to stay with us father until we fully see the manifestation of who you are in this generation Lord Lord not something for days gone by but right now Lord I pray that you would begin to break the bread of life and we'd say that was Jesus with us Lord I pray God your blessings upon this service Lord help us get out of the way father do a good job for your kingdom in Jesus name amen and amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening or this morning we'd like to look over into a few portions of scripture uh Hebrews chapter 2 and then to 1 Corinthians chapter 5 then also Revelations chapter 6 I'd like to reintroduce myself I'm brother Andrew Spencer it's hard to believe it's been a month since we've been behind the pull pit preaching and and uh so last time I was speaking I was in Belgium and I had a translator with me so I asked brother William if he could do my translation today in Romanian so he's not as willing as but we're very happy to be here and I have some things that the lord has laid on our heart and and and um I thank you for bearing with us and allowing us to have brother Tim and brother Donnie here last weekend and just felt those things on our heart and we seen we' seen the benefits of it all so it wasn't that I was trying to neglect my duty here behind this Pulpit but I just felt led as a leader here to do those things and so I believe that we've touched the the the kingdom of God and I believe that we've we we've stirred his heart and I believe that God's going to do spiritual things right here amongst us amen amen Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and Disobedience received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great of Salvation so we don't want to neglect these things we want to diligently stand before them how are we going to escape if we neglect so great a Salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him also 1 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 7 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says here Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth also Revelations chapter 6 and verse 7 amen and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed him now if you you're very keen on the message you're very aware that this is the only time that this Rider is titled but notice who it is it is the anointing that names this Rider and behold a Pale Horse and his name that sat on him was death and Hell Followed him and power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth may God bless his word you may be seated today in the presence of the Lord I would like to speak to you today on a thought that the Lord laid on my heart while I was there in Belgium actually just during a conversation I was having with Brother David Iverson the Lord be to deal with me and I told sister Katie that I felt like everything that I'd give out in that meeting sitting down the angel of the Lord just sitting down at the table with me and Brother David and the Lord just begin to pour in things to us there and just completely I felt like I told her that I I felt like everything that I had given out in in that meeting that the Lord returned back to me but I'd like to speak to you on a thought today sincerity the power over death sincerity the power over death and brother brandham said in the message influence he said now we're at the time of the Rapture he said it's going to happen because it's been perfect every other time it's going to be perfect this time God is calling out a people see it's the time we got to be sincere and notice what brother brother puit spoke to us last week in the hour has come so it's time so we we recognize we're at the time of rapture but notice what the prophet says we've got to be sincere again he would say over in the Christ the mystery of God revealed he said then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible and the Bible is in us then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say or think should be Christ is that right he should be the Principal theme of all of our life if he's the principal theme of The Bible he should be the Principal theme of all of our actions and I believe that it matters how that you approach God I believe that Everything Changes on how that you approach God you remember that when they were standing there and they they they had Jesus and they would put him put upon him the the crown of thorns and they would hit him in the face and they didn't get anything out of him because they didn't approach him in the right way but you remember that lady that had that blood issue how that she approached him that she went through the crowd and didn't care what anybody else said but when she reached out and touched him because she was the principal theme of all of her life of everything that she had heard about him he was getting to getting ready to release under her I believe that she she went in there with a real sincere heart because she understood what the Bible said that she shouldn't be around Humanity that she shouldn't be around other people in that day in those days of of her condition that she was in but she approached him in the right Manner and I believe that if we're going to get anything from God that we've got to approach him in the right manner of everything of life it's it's like it's like this brother brandham said right out here in Harrisonburg he said he said it's like you raising your hand you'll think well do you really get anything out of that brother brandham he said oh absolutely you do he said it changes from life to death if you really mean it so if you recognize that you have need of a savior and you just slip up your hand it changes things from Death unto life it matters how that you approach almighty God now that word sincerity it means honesty of mind or in attention that word it actually means that you are free from hypocrisy or you're free from disguise or you're free from false pretense as dis as as sincerity is a declaration of love it's like you you might say one thing with your words but your actions will prove differently because of your sincerity you you see there are many of men that are married to a to a woman but that that man may say unto her that I love you but his actions prove completely different he might say it with his actions or he might say it with his words but his actions might prove completely separate of the words that are coming out of his mouth so we don't want to be just people of confessors but we want to be possessors of the promises of God that we want to come boldly before him and we want to come before him with the right words just like Hattie did but we want to have the right heart as well we don't want to just simply come here out of tradition and just offer up a hand clap or offer up praise and all of those things just because of tradition but we want to come here under the power of an honest mind of an honest intention that Lord I need more of you Lord I I want more of you Lord I need healing and I Lord I need these things and I believe that how you approach him would change the situations of all of your lives no matter how old you are no matter how young you are I believe that if you approach him with a sincere heart that you will get the releas of your desire from the mind of God now brother mam said I don't believe that you can get too sincere about the work of God he said that's right the more sincere you are the better God can lead you ain't that wonderful the more sincere you are the better that God can lead you you see sincerity it it is a force that goes beyond words it reaches into our innermost being and shows all of our intentions and it shows all of our actions just like light as a genuine light begins to pierce through the darkness sincerity illuminates the paths of all of our beliefs it is not merely just saying the right words but it's aligning our soul with the word of God you notice that when brother brandham is there and he's getting ready to receive his commission by the angel of the Lord that there the angel meets him in that room he he would call it his special room or his his special spot and there the angel comes and meets him he meets him there and you notice what he begins to talk to him and he gives him his commission but but notice what he tells him he said if you'll be sincere and get the people to believe you that nothing will be able to stand before your prayer and brother brandham asked the question he said what about cancer and the angel said not even cancer so notice what this commission is hanging on or hinging on it is hinging upon sincerity and believing and I believe that nothing has change with almighty God I believe that if it was meant for William brandom and he is our messenger and we are under this message that I believe that if we can be sincere and if I believe that if we can really believe that nothing shall be able to stand before our prayer not even cancer you notice how that how that the Angels spoke those words and you'll notice that I was just I sent it to our family just yesterday about how that brother randam as soon as he got his commission one of the most major cases that's described throughout all the message is Sister Margie Morgan you can go back and study out through the message I don't I don't want to I don't want to go through the all the details but she had cancer all throughout her body intestines and it was wrapped up in there and when brother brandom prayed for her and he said those words over her you're not going to die but you're going to live brother brandham said that he's he not I want you to catch this that brother Morgan looked up there because he was friends with those doctors he knew the sincere or he knew the seriousness of this condition he said but if I can get you to believe me if I can get you to believe me because he said I believe with all of my heart he said I believe it with all of my heart he said but if I can get you to believe that with all of your heart is that right he said so I want you to notice that there he was speaking face to face with this supernatural being and he said if I can get you to believe me with all your heart you see it's very powerful this morning if I can get you to believe me with all your heart then you can go to believing God and that's what brother Brandon would tell us he said that's what moves God is your faith in him he said then you're healed your faith has saved you you see your faith that you had to believe has saved you but you because you because just because you say the right words it will never manifest unless you mix it with sincerity come on somebody we've had a whole lot of emotions we've had a whole lot of Pentecostal movements around the message but we don't want to just mix up our words with just emotions we want our words to be mixed with with truth we want our words and our action and our dance and our speech and our and our gifts we want it to be mixed with sincerity I don't want something that's just on the flesh or in the carnal Realms that can leave us at any moment but if we can mix it with sincerity if we can mix it with truth come on somebody if you know what you's dancing about then nobody can take it away from you if you know what you're amening about there's no devil that can rob it from you if you know why you got got your joy back and it's mixed with sincerity and it's mixed with truth let the devil come let him try to rob from you nothing ain't nothing change with God if you approach him in the same way as William brandom approached him in every prayer line sincerity and in truth I believe that you can get the same response I believe that you can get the same works I believe that you can get the same manifestations brother Brandon was asked the question one time he said well does everybody get well he said everybody that believes everybody that believes gets well now there's hundreds that got sick again after they got prayed for but look at all of those that did believe but I believe that this message came more than just to give us a first pull and a second pull I believe that this message came more than just for Divine Healing I don't think I'm way out of here I know that we need Divine Healing like never before in this place but I believe that this message came more for us than just to receive Divine Healing I believe he's came to give us Divine Health where we never get sick no more where we don't have to worry about the about the chaos of life I believe that God's got something out there in front of us and I believe that this message is that that gives us power over death come on somebody what good is this message doing if it ain't giving us power over death come on somebody it was more than just for a Elijah's Ministry it's for you come on Elisha wrap yourself up in this robe of the message of the hour we don't want just Divine Healing we don't want just gifts of the Spirit we want a body change hallelujah hallelujah now the Bible says in Proverbs 11:3 that the Integrity of the upright shall guide them or the sincerity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them notice anybody can be sincere brother random said if if all God requires is sincerity then Cain had it if all God requires is a sacrifice then Cain had it so let me make myself very clear today before we go too much further sincerity does not save you Works sincerity where it works is is not of is not of sincerity sincerity is not works but it's by Grace is that right so let me make this very very very clear to you you can be as sincere as all get out but it does not save you look at Paul on the road to Damascus he was sincere as anybody else in the land he was following the message of Moses to the letter and he did it gladly and he had sincerity in his heart but when he met that angel when he met that Pillar of Fire what happened it changed him him to the truth so what did it do he had sincerity but he didn't have truth you can have sincerity and not have truth and miss the whole picture what was Paul doing he was up there in sincerity and he was killing out the children of God brother random said the most sincere people that I know of in all the land is they give themselves up to sacrifices he said they're sincere in doing it he said a man can sincerely take medicine from a from a from a doctor but he said that doctor or that pharmacist could get it wrong he could be doing it sincere and get it completely wrong and mix death into his body but notice that God does not judge you by your sincerity God judges you God judges you by the grace of God he judges you by the word that he deposit it on the inside of your heart so sincerity does not save you what are you saying to us brother Andrew I'd say that we're living in a very special hour I believe that we're living under the greatest message that there ever has been I believe that what has been released to us as the body of Jesus Christ that we ought to we ought to hold oursel up to another standard of the message I don't believe that we need to knck oursel down and lower oursel down just to try to match some kind of a denominational idea but I believe that if we're going to do something in this life as message Believers then we got to be sincere now notice what the Bible tells us in second Timothy and I'm not going to read the whole scriptures but you notice that when when when uh Paul is writing out this letter to Timothy here in 2 Timothy and three that Paul lays out the the attitude of Le oosa that in the last days there will be hey high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God what was it they had got away from sincerity and they'd gots away from the faith of the true Faith that's why when in the book of Jude it tells us that we ought to earnestly contend for the faith the faith not a not a faith but the faith the same faith that Paul had notice what brother random said in the message all things he said God hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless but any religion that has Christ in it is under his own blood it's got power in it you say well God hates a religion without power he said your solemn Feast is a stink I guess he does hate it he said it makes me sick and remember he told this rich leodys and church that because you're lukewarm you in other words you make me sick I'll spew you out out of my mouth and we've come to that age how many more churches can we build how many more denominations can be out there but that is not what God is looking for of more buildings come on somebody we got more Bibles and we ever had before we got more church members that are going there for popcorn and ice cream and coffee than there ever has before but they're not there for truth they're there for activities but what are you here for come on somebody I wouldn't give you a nickel for somebody that just showed up here sincerely just to say that they came to church for another weekend but I wouldn't take a million dollars for somebody that shows up in the house of God that mixes their sincerity with the power of this message but let me tell you something you can have your sincerity all you want to but give me the message of the hour put it on the vessel of somebody that's living out the message ain't no devil in hell knows what to do with a young girl that's so completely sold out to herself that she don't even think her own thoughts no more that little boy don't think his own thoughts no more but he's so embodied by the power of the Holy Ghost that the devil doesn't know what to do with him God hates a powerless religion he said God send us an is Isaiah to chop the thing to Pieces he said lay it out before the people spare not he said you think he'd be accept it certainly not but he cried just the same your solemn Feast there a stink he said notice he said God hates a powerless religion he said it's got to have power in it it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know that you've passed from Death un life he said God wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explains it away and says it's for some other day and something how can God who wants to fulfill his word and perform his word among the people and the people deny that he does it yet they go through all of the rituals so we don't want a ritual we want power is that right we want anointing is that right what is anointing it's the supreme power under control it ain't flying off loose of the cannon speaking things into existence that never will come into existence but the anointing it's supreme power under control was that brother Andrew why don't you start speaking squirrels into existence if you got that kind of power I'm not in need of squirrels but I am in need of my dad's healing I am in need of my brother receiving his prodal back home I am in need of a body change come on now let the anointing that's been released in this generation by the opening of the seals of this day release an anointing through your life come on somebody you're not in need of squirrels you're not in need of giving back a little posum his life back again you're not in need of giving a little fish back his life again but you are needing that real Sanctified holy life that the devil doesn't know what to do with you you do need that overcoming life what do we got to do brother Angel then we got to have blood on our heart we don't want just sincerity is that right I'm going somewhere we don't want just sincerity because look at the chief priests and the elders they were more sincere than probably some of you here they were sincere about the law they were sincere about carrying out Moses's message but when Jesus the one that could fulfill all the law was standing before them in Matthew chapter 27 you go to read it out it's very powerful when they've got a choice between power or death notice what happen they come to a certain season when the Bible said that there's a season when they would let out a a a a notable prisoner in that age but notice how close Satan gets he makes it look like going to church is the right thing he makes it look like he makes it look like doing all these rituals is the right thing is that close in Matthew 24 and 24 that it would deceive the elect if it was possible notice how close he gets here's pilot standing in the middle here's barabus on this side known as a murderer this murder had been around since Mary was riding over the hills on a donkey and here's Jesus on this side can I put it to you in Hebrew and Greek will you choose Jesus or will you choose Jesus because if you look up Jesus and you look up barabus their name aligns together the son of the father see how close he is see how close he comes in front of you and said if you'll just accept accept a little handshake now you're too smart for that but if you'll just accept a little emotion or if you'll accept this you just just shout your way into the Holy Ghost if you accept that Jesus or Jesus it could be very confusing for somebody that does not have the Holy Spirit are you preaching me the message or are you preaching me the message am I choosing Jesus or am I choosing Jesus so let me put it to you like this do you want a murder or do you do you want a LIF taker or do you want a lifegiver do you want somebody that's known as bringing healing to the body do you want somebody that's known for bringing manifestations back to the Church of the Living God or do you want somebody at the end of the day that all they can offer you is death now look I look at this picture look at this drama they're said here before today these guys in the middle they got you all Here In This Crowd this multitude is gathered and you came here with one thought you came here with one thought in this building let me take you back 200000 years you come in this arena with one purpose there's a choice before you but brother random said they made a Ras mistake when they chose a lifetaker instead of a lifegiver let me say this to you anytime you choose cigarettes you made the wrong choice every time you choose to worship worship Satan instead of God you made the wrong choice every time you try to you look down through the things of of Life of maybe just giving you a little bit more pleasure you chose the wrong thing these people had such an effect they had such a Ministry don't tell me Joe o ain't got some power don't tell me don't tell me that man that fell down there in Louisiana that that that that was there that was really close that that that Jimmy swaggered he was really close to it and he fell in sin and he told the whole world that he fell in sin don't tell me he ain't got power he influences the crowds and they think they're worshiping Jesus think I'm wrong go listen to God of this evil AG think I'm wrong they were that close they were choosing barabus or Jesus look how close it was they was that close and this crowd of Chief priest the Bible said that they persuaded them they pers persuaded them to choose a lifetaker I'm going somewhere today and I can feel all all the brickles of hell trying to upset some things here but I want to show you something these men were sincere but they were sincerely wrong you can have truth but without sincerity you cannot make the word of God live for the day is that right you can have the message you can have it in your room you can have the pictures on your wall but without sincerity brother brandom said that when he was there in the Houston debate I read this yesterday about about blew me away but he said he said when I he said when I was there in the Houston debate he said I really thought that Dr best was sincere he said I really did think he was sincere he said I really did think he was sincere he said until he looked out there and said I feel sorry for those people that out there in those Wheelchairs and those Cs and dying with Cancers he said he couldn't have sincerity when he was trying to rob them children of the only hope that they ever had he said he was trying to rob them he was he said it was they were like a robin a starving man of a meal he said how can you been sincere taking away the only hope that we got let me tell you something you can take this whole world but give me this message you can take my house you can take my money you can take my job you can take my family but give me this message come on somebody what are you without this message what are you without it they were so close to it but they failed to recognize the power of the message that was standing before them well brother Andrew you're preaching to us sincerity how about you let me throw myself in here ministers should be the utmost example of sincerity let me tell you y'all get to hide your yourself I get to live in a glass glass house and everybody sees everything you will judge everything that I do by them girls right there if I preach to you a message of Holiness and they don't live up to it who's going to be the first one to call me out come on somebody if I preach to you a message that we ought to live this message with everything of power and sincerity of spending hours reading our Bible listening to the message and my daughters never listened to it what good is my preaching it's just words but if my daughters get filled with the same holy ghost that I got filled with then it's a sign to all of hell that the message still works and I got news and I'm putting the devil on notice today the message still works I got little girls that got the same holy ghost that I got Hallelujah come on somebody if this message can't produce the same works that William Brandon produced in the 1960s what are we doing here I'm putting it down to you today what are we preaching what are we living what are we asking for where are we we at if God spoke a word over Zoe little Zoe back there and said that she was going to speak and she never spoke her entire life then you would say something's wrong with the ministry here come on somebody what if the Lord had a vision of a little Isaac and there never came one come on somebody either we're testifying the truth or we're defy to a lie but I recognize there's a power behind this word that I'm not the one or brother Ron's not the one or brother Tim's not the one or all of these other brothers we are held to an example of sincerity so I better be right when I walk out that back door I better not have anything carnal on my mind I better not have anything out there that would disrupt me from you getting your blessing and I love you more than I love myself I'm responsible for 200 people to preach to them the message Paul said in Titus 2: 7 it says in all things showing thyself a pattern of Good Works in Doctrine showing uncorrupt this gravity and sincerity ministers it should be sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you so he that's on the other side ministers ought to be able to live such a life that those that are on the other side of Truth would not be able to have anything said of you how you going to live that out brother Andrew it ain't me living is him notice 2 Corinthians 2:17 for we are not as many which corrupt the world word of God but as of sincerity but as of God in the sight of God speak we in Christ so we cannot as Paul said in the Hebrew letter how are we going to escape these things if we neglect so great a Salvation now notice what brother brand said he said how are we going to escape it he said you neglect to eat you're going to die he said you neglect to turn the corner you'll wreck you neglect the milk of the cow she'll go dry you neglect your teeth you'll have to have the all pulled out certainly he said you'll pay for your negation say it to me neglection all brandom Tabernacle oh you visitors let me tell you something you neglect to testify of the glory of God you neglect to give God the praise and glory and you'll find yourself cold formal and backsliding you give God praise how are we going to escape these things if we neglect to give it notice what Peter said in 1 Peter 2 and 21 for he even here unto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth no deceit no subtility no craftiness in his words it was simply truth in his mouth he left us an example again 2 Corinthians 1:12 for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in Simplicity and godly sincerity so all of our whole conduct everything that our heart engages should be that in Simplicity and godly sincerity not with f fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you word so everything about us should be done in s sincerity thank you brother Andrew you're getting right there on my level thank you I'm glad you like that let's conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God in everything that we do what did I ask you last weekend consecrate yourself like never before is that right if we're going to see Miracles then we got to consecrate oursel like never before we ought to conduct ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God a daughter of God don't go out there and live in beer joints and paint her face up and cut her hair off and act like a prostitute conduct yourself as a daughter of God you're a daughter of the king sons of God don't you go out there and take the Bible and say oh days of Miracles has pass all that kind of that all that kind of stuff he said you stand up for everything that God said that's how you ought to conduct yourself is aligning everything with the word of God because we're Sons and Daughters of the king notice when notice when Joshua is coming out to the closing hours of his ministry and Lord willing I'm going to be taking a a series on something that the Lord dealt with me this past past week on on providing The Inheritance but I want you to notice I want you to notice Joshua's last charge in Joshua chapter 24 most of you have most of you have it in your home that as for me in my house we'll serve the Lord but just before Joshua tells tells those things in Joshua 14 he says therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt serve ye the Lord if you go to looking up that word in the Hebrew tamim of sincerity it it means it is what is complete or it's entirely in accord with truth so in other words we ought to serve him by being in line with the word of God now you're going to come against you're going to come against Crossroads you're going to come up against things in life but stay in line what did the prophet say what was the message that came at the preview of the Bride stay in line little bride stay in line little bride what voice got you back in line it was this Prophet messenger that gave a voice in this generation what was it when Moses was out there and he was back there on the backs side of that desert and the word of the Lord came unto him and said you're going to come back here and you're going to worship me upon on this mountain Moses had some obstacles that he had to go through he had some hurdles that he had to jump through you might be sincere and you might be a real Christian but you're still going to get bombarded by Satan you're going to still get bombarded you're still going to have cancer maybe hit you you're still going to have troubles that hit you maybe you go to a doctor and the doctor says you're going to die or different things like that it doesn't change your salvation Moses had a little bitty pharaohs and a little bitty Egyptian armies that were going after him they didn't change his mind about what God said about him brother brandom said that he stayed right there all that time in the line of duty and I believe that if there's any ever anything that we need to do in this message we ought to get right back in line with it are you with me are you with me you ought to get so sincere you ought to get so sincere about about about your prayer life you ought to get so sincere about your about your walk with God you ought to get so sincere about your devotions you ought to get so sincere about your prayer life how that how that you can set an atmosphere right there in your home so that you set an atmosphere and the presence of God would drop down in your home because you had some sincerity about you brother Brandon would talk about that woman up there that widow's airpath how that she got so sincere how that she was coming down through her last meal and she was right there in a time of famine she was coming down there when death was getting ready to strike at her door getting ready to strike at her door but brother bham said that she broke into another realm and she went in there and her her prayers were me with so much more sincerity in her prayer life notice what she did she aligned herself with the word here's this Widow she's in a time of famine ain't nobody eating but this little widow she don't know what blessings coming on her heart because she's or what's getting ready to come by her way is because she stayed in prayer it's because she stayed up there when nobody else was worshiping she stayed up there in prayer when nobody else was in Feast she was getting ready to come into a feast he said well brother Andrew I ain't seen no blessings come by my way you stay right there young people you stay right there in the message you stay right there in that truth don't you back off of it you stay right there whether you see it coming or whether you don't stay right there stay in line with that stay in line with it she was getting ready to die brother Doug go listen to desperations and hear what the prophet says go listen to it but here this little lady she's coming down to her last meal but there was a prophet that had been fed by crows had been fed by those Ravens all those days but the spirit of the Lord come whirling over top of him and said get down there to S path I got a woman down there that's going to feed you don't you recognize what you've been doing in your prayer life I want you to I want you to listen real close today don't you recognize what she's getting ready to do she's getting ready to fix her last meal she's getting ready to take a little bit of oil and she's going to fix it for her son and they're going to die but when she come to a prophet messenger when she got hooked up with Elijah come on somebody she took Elijah's word she aligned herself with Elijah's word and it gave her power over death don't you see what this message is doing unto you the rest of the world Amos said is in a famine but you're not in a famine you got a seven course menu before you you got spiritual food in newe season that's been poured out to you and because you aligned yourself s with Elijah's message because you aligned yourself with it now you brothers that are Hunters you know good and well if you ain't got no scope on there you going to have to open sight that thing and if you don't line up your marks you're going to miss the target notice what this woman was doing she was lining up everything in her life her prayer life was in line and when the message came by her way everything was in line it did not bring her death brought her life what do the denominations offer you Eternal separation they offer you death but what did this message offer to you life come on somebody that old devil that on sloot he's come to steal to kill and destroy but Jesus said I have come to give you life and life more abundantly Hallelujah Hallelujah you got to get so sincere about your worship that it confuses everybody around you brother Danny it's going to get good here in a minute but you ought to get so sincere about your worship that it confuses the preacher Hall that be some mighty sincere worship you believe that that you can be so sincere that it'll confuse preacher Hannah got so sincere she got so sincere before God brother Bram said when all them other ladies was going up there to shoh just to take a look at the cinal Realms and see what kind of hats and what kind of dresses that the rest of the world was looking at Hannah went up there with sincerity and brother brandham said that her sincerity brought a misunderstanding to that priest and he didn't understand he thought she was drunk you recognize that your sincerity about your need can bring such a power to it that it'll be misunderstood well I need quotes for it brother Brandon said we're not a bunch of Fanatics we're just misunderstood that's all let me tell you something I've spent the God forgive me I've spent most of my Ministry worrying about what other people thought about me I'm coming down with it today but I don't hold anything what anybody else thought about me wrong because I know the sincerity of my heart let me say this I spent a lot of time worrying about what other people thought about my image but you done messed up now Satan I don't give a flip about what you think about my image I don't care about how you think about how I act or how I dance or how I worship or how I preach or how I get in tune with the spirit of God I don't really care you might measure me with your measureing stick and I may not measure up to it but who's the one Ezekiel that's measuring out the lines it ain't you how do you get to that kind of spot brother Andrew don't care don't be ashamed don't be ashamed sincerity brings power come on somebody I don't care if you're screaming tongues cro tongues Dance all over this building or sit still but be [Applause] sincere come on somebody I ain't asking for you to get loud I ain't asking for you to clap your hands I ain't asking for you to get up and shout and dance I'm asking you to align yourself with the message come on somebody you ever watch somebody I know I'm talking to a bunch of people used to go to the club you ever watch somebody that's always scared to get up off the bar store some of y'all been to a club I see that cuz they're afraid they're afraid how they're going to act out there oh you give it about midnight and the whole atmosphere changes now ktie hadn't never been too much around drinking too much thank God sure don't act like it now does she I took her to a Swanky hotel or not hotel but a Swanky restaurant and I was told they had the best burgers and you talk to a country boy likes Burgers well we'll go for it went went there and it was tiny little joint it wasn't no bigger was no bigger from here to that wall but the place was real close ain't amazing you pay $80 sat down right beside somebody you don't even know sometimes and all of a sudden things got triggered it was a real quiet place in there and all of a sudden you could hear the volume change in that place it was one of them places that they they stage all your meals you get a a piece of lettuce where's the rest of it it's coming just wait on it it give you a p piece of lettuce here give you a piece of bread here you dip it in this oil I'd never been I'd never been to the any of these places like this where you have to be coached how to eat let country people we just throw down EA some beans and taters and all these things we don't really care what if we got some hanging off of our jaw or not half time I sit down with my family and they're telling me but all of a sudden the the atmosphere changed in there what was it they got under the influence of what was being sold in there what happens in a place like this when you begin to mix your sincerity with the stimulation by Revelation the atmosphere begins to change and in that atmosphere I'm going to quote you the message because that's the only thing I know is in that kind of atmosphere Eagles are born Eagles are born in that kind of atmosphere let me tell you I don't know what to do I don't know how to get your prodical back here I don't know where they are all I know how to do brother Shannon is preach the message and we create such an atmosphere that they go [Applause] up that you take your token you apply that token and you take your token and you put it over your family some of youve been setting heater and you've been applying the token and you've been doing it day in and day out what I do brother Andrew keep applying the token come on somebody the message got a hold of me when I thought I was unworthy when I thought I was not good enough but the token worked let me encourage you parents you may be sitting out there you may see no signs of God's approval on you putting your token your Holy Ghost life over top of your children but I want you to know your father is satisfied as long as you got the blood the life of Jesus Christ over your heart store Hallelujah let me tell you that's the only thing that's the only thing when Joshua was standing there he standing there in Joshua 24 what is he doing he's encouraging the people you stay right here put away them Gods you ever think about this where we are in Revelations chapter N9 where we see the smoke coming out of a bottomless pit we see leoy on every hand your young people are dealing with more homosexuality in your school than than any of us adults ever had to deal with what is it it's a confusion smoke is a confusion they don't know which way to go brother s they don't know whether to go to the light or the right or the left they don't know you young people are facing more demons but I want you to know something God's Got Confidence in the seed that he placed on the inside of you let me tell you something when you feel like you ain't sincere enough your jean seed of God makes you sincere what did he do he's telling them put away them things put away them carnal things they didn't do you no good down there in Egypt put away the gods that you know come on now put away them things but Joshua wasn't just taking them to a spot of justification or sanctification what are we under we're under a Joshua commission what was Joshua doing he was taking them to a spot where the the token had to be applied in their life what was it what was it Joshua was looking out there a real leader looks out there in the future and Joshua was looking out there and he saw a promise over there he saw a Promised Land over there he saw milk and honey over there and what was he telling them put away your Gods he ain't telling them just to sanctify yourself for the battle get yourself full of the Holy Ghost what was he doing he was aligning himself with the word of God God because he recognized that out there was an inheritance for them that it was rightly theirs they had every right to it they had every right to it I want you to know that you've got every right that had a right grabbed a hold of right here in this building if you align yourself with the word right if you serve him in sincerity and Truth God will back up his word just look at Enoch Enoch walked with God and the Bible said that he was not the Bible said that by Enoch by by faith Enoch was translated by faith he held this testimony that he pleased God Enoch name means dedicated he was dedicated when he was walking with God he was dedicated when his wife didn't want him to go he was dedicated when his children wasn't walking with him but the Bible tells us that Enoch prophesied of the Lord's coming so do you recognize that he was a type of you he was typing out a people that were built for the Rapture you're dedicated for the Rapture you're sincere about the Rapture you're consecrated for the Rapture and he was living an hour and it was much worse than this he was living in an hour he'd Liv 57 years with Adam on the earth he'd talked with Adam about going back to Eden he'd heard about it he'd been there with him he talked with him all of those things and Enoch just kept on walking he just kept on walking when nobody else would align thems with what Enoch was being talked to by Adam Hallelujah he was aligning himself because if I don't do this there's a people that's coming that won't have a type I'm the seventh from abam I'm the seventh from Adam I'm living in a world of Le osia with doomed people doomed for Destruction but I'm making a step I'm watching I'm walking constantly in fellowship with an Eden realm with doomed people young people you rub shoulders with people in your H in your classrooms that are doomed people but you're walking on because you're dedicated you got young people that'll surely go through the tribulation there but you're not dedicated for the tribulation you're dedicated for the Rapture come on somebody come on somebody he lives so perfect but before almighty God he lived so dedicated that God could not deny him the Rapture and my mama don't go it ain't going to hinder me if my daddy don't go it won't hinder me if the deacons don't go he won't hinder me I'm on my way praise God I'm on my way Enoch kept walking when his wife wouldn't walk with him he said I'm dedicated for this walk I'm dedicated for this message I'm dedicated for a translation I'm dedicated for it and what is it going to take little bride it's going to take a people that is dedicated like never before I notice when brother brand when he goes in there and he starts he tells us a vision and I always I believe you do this as well but a vision is the very mind of the lord it's the word of the Lord in Vision form and we know that we know there's over 8,000 Visions in the message but I want you to recognize this those Visions just wasn't for William Brown those are your Visions right I don't know about you but that's how I see myself that's how I see myself in the message you might think that's a little strange but let me tell you something who's the message for me it's for me so those visions that were held there that for were were William brandham he had the Visions he was simply a prophet messenger he held those Visions there but when William brandham comes and he depicts those things let me tell you the best thing that you can do when you're watching out a drama is to put yourself right there in that drama what would you do in this picture what would you do in this drama and brother bandam are telling us in 1961 in the Paradox about a about a a about death that it was coming that there he was and he sawed this Vision before the Lord he said he he said I was sitting there and I watched his vision before the Lord there that he gave unto me and he said I begin to watch he said he said there he said there's certain different snakes that have different different abilities as soon as they strike you if you don't get to the hospital you're dead he said but over there in that foreign country he said when men hear that word Mamba they run and they beat their heads because they know that it's sudden death that it was sudden death and brother bandam said he said there I was he said I was watching in this Vision he said and that Vision was that Vision was showing that Mamba and said he kept that Mamba kept coming at me he said but he couldn't get to me he couldn't get to me and he said when he couldn't get to me he started going after my friend and he said then I begin to see that my friend was jumping up through those weeds just kept jumping up here and jumping up there and he said I thought oh Lord he said if that strikes him it's death immediately he said I begin to look at that and I begin to think and he said I'll begin to look at it he said then all of a sudden he said the word of the Lord came unto me and said you've been given power to bind that now notice I'm going to go through that just a little bit just a little bit but notice what the what the angel says to him he asked the question what must I do what must I do this is where I find myself what must I do what must I do he said you must must be sincere now it wasn't that brother random wasn't sincere very much the contrary you can look throughout all of brother bram's Ministry hear it on tape and hear all the testimonies brother brandham had a sincerity that was a deep sincerity he was he was led of the Lord in everything and it's not that I'm preaching to you that you're not sincere but it's very much contrary I believe that you're one of the most sincere people that I know of but I believe that we as the body of Jesus Christ we've been given something to us that we're held to a different standard come on somebody you are held higher than Paul was held to you're held higher than Luther was held to you're held higher than what Wesley was held too why is it you have been given a fully restored word of the hour and you are facing more demons than ever before than any other age Paul Luther Wesley Columba all of these men they've never faced all of these demons like you're facing it wasn't that brother random wasn't sincere but the angel was asking him or telling him you must be more more sincere I'd say if we would examine oursel right here there's definitely some areas that we could we could say yes I can be more sincere here come on somebody we got an extreme devil that is dealing with a man behind this Pulpit trying he's not just trying to make him sick he's trying to kill him that same Devil's after you that same Devil's after you today and if let me tell you something it's going to take more than you're just Penny Andy just going up and confessing going to the Altar and beating on the altar it's going to take real sincerity it wasn't that brother random wasn't sincere but the angel was giv him a commission what you've been given in your hand is the king sword you got to hold it right you got to hold it in your hand just right and be more more sincere what was it what was it he was calling for a deeper consecration a deeper sincerity a deeper walk because let me tell you something if this mama strikes that brother he's dead what happened when you go in Revelations chapter 6 let me get to the meat of my message now I've held you here but let me get to this when you look at Revelations and you start seeing the seals begin to break and you start seeing it through out of all the ages it's held there and all of the theologians even brother brandham thought at one point that was Christ riding on that white horse rider what did he do when he saw him going out in the first seal when it was broke what did he see he thought that was the mighty conqueror Christ himself he said I would have made a horrible mistake if the angel of the Lord had not come into the room he said that's not that Antichrist he said that's not the Christ he said it's that Antichrist and he's riding out there to conquer and to conquer what was he riding out there to he was riding out there to conquer the Le he was going out there trying to prove that he had the power to stop the Church of the Living God I want to say this to you the devil's not smart enough to stop you the devil's not ahead of you the devil's not ahead of God that Antichrist Rider is riding out there and you watch as it as it moves to the red from the white to the red to the black all the way down to the pale and what does brother bam do when he breaks open the fourth seal he said what is it he said notice notice what he does he Blends or merges himself together all three of them colors all them Powers merge together what is it he said it's those political and church Powers blendings together to cause an eternal separation that's what death is that's what this message is about sincerity brings power over death what was it these political and church Powers were combining themselves up in a pale horse look at people they're so confused today they don't know what they don't know what tribe they belong to they don't know whether they're male or female whether they're a cat or a dog notice this Pale Horse he can blend in he can fit right in notice how Lucifer comes in there notice how he those two Vines they're always connected together but don't you try to disconnect them it's the angel that disconnects them it's the messenger that disconnects them notice don't you do that job you just stay steadfast in the promises of God notice that angel that angel is standing there and it's announcing notice this pale horse rider what is he it's the only time that the horse rider is named and he's named death now notice when brother random goes in that vision of 1961 he said it's death out there it's death out there he said if that Mama strikes if that serpent strikes he said it's death out there he said if he strikes my brother he said but all of a sudden he said something came over top of me and charged me he said it charged me and he said Satan I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ what did the message say it said that that little that snake he said it automatically curled up and begin to choke on itself and bound itself up he said in a little and sign a backward s he said and means bind this one and anything below it bind death and anything below it what was the question question throughout all the ages can man if a man dies can he live again what did the prophet messenger deliver unto us this vision is for you little bride you've got the power to bind death you've been given a sincerity and a power to bind death what did you do you have

has a greater capacity you have the power you have the power to bind this you see you you're battling you're battling right now to get into an atmosphere of heavenly places but I want you to know this is a worthy fight everything that you're fighting for everything that you're needing it's a worthy fight right now some of you are you're fighting to break into an atmosphere some of you are asking for a breakthrough some of you are asking for miracles be sincere your sincerity will bring your promise be sincere dedicate yourself it's not that you're not sincere but there's a job in front of you Elijah you got a job in front of you if Enoch was the first to go on a Rapture and Elijah was a second to go in the Rapture and Jesus was a third Rapture there's going to be a fourth Rapture and there's going to be somebody that says I've got power over death what is the rapture little bride this Eagle anointing it's taking you over the power of death Hallelujah let me tell you something you ain't just going to walk out there you ain't going to just walk out there frivolously kicking around skipping up to the devil and take the power away from him this is the hour when full manifested Sons and Daughters of God walk up to Satan I've come here to take it you ain't skipping up there like you're coming up there to grab a sack of candy you got to walk up there with authority you got to walk up there with power you got to walk up there sincerity let me tell you tumors have no power under sincerity and under truth I bind tumors in the name of Jesus Christ I bind cancers in the name of Jesus Christ I have the authority by God's word and by this message to say Satan take your hands off of God's Property it's a battle Worth Fighting For What is Satan doing he's trying to rob you of headship recognize the battle that's going on in here come on somebody I'll be your pastor as long God as long as God allows me to be your pastor I'll stand right here behind this pull pit and I'll preach to you but I got a motive and an objective Lord I want your headship I want my pastor what's my motive I want the headship of almighty God I believe with everything that's within me there's still more work for Ron Spencer to do I still believe that I need his headship I still believe that it's not that I'm scared of the position I know where I'm at but I believe with everything that's within me the briad of Jesus Christ needs this miracle we need a Hatty R we need a Georgie Carter we need a congressman UPA so why can't we have a Ron Spencer [Applause] notice the words he says put yourself here put yourself in a vision you must be more sincere Lord forgive me of my sincerity and give me sincerity young people all Christians here you ought to check yourself every day I believe that's what a Christian does they check thems up and if something ain't right you bring it back in line it's not that you're not sincere you're a godly people you're elected of almighty God yeah but he's calling for a deep sincerity I think that you ought to take every special in sincerity that's right we ain't here for no show to be honest if we wanted a show we'd have went on the cruise with brother Chris and them I let's just be honest they're going to enjoy that they're going to but that you can get on you can get on YouTube and watch a show we don't want a show we want sincerity come on somebody we don't we don't want just people here that just fill up pews come on now you don't know how many times I walk these aisles in the middle of the night I walk these aisles I come down here and I'd be doing a job and I'd come down here and I walk these pews Lord don't just fill these pews and I know there's other brothers here with me come down here unannounced and walk these pews Lord don't just fill these pews up with people to fill up pews fill them with real sons and daughters of God that believe the message with all their heart come on somebody we don't want to we we done got past the days of playing games of church come on somebody we got a Rapture in front of us we got death to destroy we got something in front of us a pale horse rider that says we're not going to make it that says we're not going to overcome but you got a job little bride destroy that devil you got the power to do it sister one you got it in you and I love this Vision cuz I told you I done put myself there but I caught something this week about toring me apart brother William when I caught this I've read over this Vision because I love it because I like reminding Satan where he needs to be at brother Stephen I really enjoy that I really take pleasure in making the devil feel like a loser and then he starts pointing to me say well look at all your mistakes and then I say well look at that you didn't get that one you didn't get that one you didn't get me then and you ain't going to get me now Look at that one look at that one all I do I like pointing out to the devil all of his mistakes and all of his lies y'all forgive me I get a little excited here I won't do something in front of you that I wouldn't done in my study but I I was reading that quote brother Gabriel and I began to look at that and brother brand said Satan I bind you and he said he went into a little went to a little and sign he said that means him and anything below it but brother brandom said I walked over there and I mashed on it I about tore my study a part brother Doug I went over there and I mashed on it I don't know how foolish I was to read over that all them years years and miss it but he said I went over there and I mashed on it you want to know what Mash means it means to bruise what was prophesied all the way back there in Genesis chapter 3 and This Woman's seed shall bruise the head of this serpent what is this woman seed this bride doing in this generation she's bruising the head put that devil underneath your feet come on Revelations in you got the pillar of fire put your foot on it put your foot on it Mash that devil bruise that devil it's time that bruis Sals get bruised back mash it crush it defeat it come on little bride you're not your own you're the [Applause] father's Hallelujah I told this I told this all over but I it's powerful brother George brother Jim excuse me I've told this all over cuz I like proving to the Devil he's a loser he never got you brother Jim he never got you he tried to hold you but he never got you he tried to keep you from the message but he never got you how about you how about you he tried all of his Works to get you but you were raised as the Jean Sheed of God to crush the enemy's [Applause] head and I got to read in that quote where brother brandham heart's talking about that woman that was dealing F arthritis he said he starts talking to her in the prayer line he starts talking to her prayer line he said why don't you go ahead and stomp just a little bit what was he doing he was wanting her to feel the effect of her healing that the arthritis had left her feet I told that quote here I read that quote here when I spoke that I started speaking things about sugar diabetes and different things in the body and brother Jim stood up he stood up on his own and he said Lord I received that and he started stomping it and sugar diabetes was destroyed come on somebody what about you in your life what about your personal problems what about your spiritual problems why did you mash that devil why don't you show up and show out you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you were not to be put under Satan but you were built to put your foot on him I ain't just telling you to start walking around here and stomping ain't the kind of people that we are but I think you ought to spiritually walk out as pillars of fire in re gations 10 and put your foot on that devil stomp him Mash that death he ain't going to hold you he's held you he's held you here he's held you here and he made you think that you weren't going to make it but Elisha saw what Elijah happened to Elijah Enoch's family watched what happened to Enoch the disciples watch what happened with Jesus but this time when Jesus comes to get his body he ain't going to leave any of his disciples behind he's going to take you with him when he comes to catch his body that's what you are he's the head we're the body what is up there what is up there on Sabia Canyon what's up there on Mount Sunset what is that cloud up there what did the angel tell him turn it to the right turn it to the right what was it when you turn it to the right it's perfectly Hoffman's head of Christ where is he looking at he's looking at the Earth go look at it it's right there turn it to the right he's looking at his body but he's not looking at you in defeat he's looking at you with Seven Seals a book that's opened that's got full of Power full Authority now it ain't going to work you up it ain't going to work you up it's going to be like any other day sister Whitney you're going to go through brother brandom said you're going to be putting your roof you're going to be putting shingles on your roof he you just go ahead and put them on there he said live like he's coming today he said but live like he's going to be if it's 10 years from now live that kind of a life he said if you're putting shingles on today go ahead and put them shingles on you go ahead and occupy till Jesus comes come on somebody you just go on if you planting taters he said go on planting taters if you're out there in the garden you just go on about your work but keep your eyes up little bride because you've been given the power over death what is it that little seed that little bitty seed that kept you from going in sin that kept you from troubles it just kept persevering it was something on the inside of you that kept making you long for more of the message when the world was more pleasurable for a season that seed kept calling out to you and said come back here water with this water with this message feed it with this message and that seed that seed between the hours of 6 and N you're going to understand in a moment in the twinkling of an eye what it's like no sorrow there let me tell you let me tell you I've been a lot of prayer lines brother Ron's been in a whole lot more than me I've seen some phenomenal Miracles seen things in Belgium we didn't have a prayer line but we had an altar call and and Lord began to do stuff there things that things that I personally believe that just make me believe we're at the coming of the Lord but I've laid hands on sick and I've seen them recover I've seen planter fasciitis dissolved I've seen dislocated shoulders pop right back in place I've seen New Birth happen after New Birth but I've never prayed for anybody like what we're getting ready to happen I never prayed for anybody and watch him have a bald head and all of a sudden hair comes back on them amen that's right I never prayed for somebody that had false teeth and all of a sudden they fall out and got their teeth back I never seen anybody I lay my hands on them all of a sudden all them gray hairs start going back to their original colors but we're getting ready to watch it what am I saying to you little bride your sincerity your sincerity is bringing power over death let's stand Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise in here [Applause] hallelujah I don't know who sent it to me I know it's one of these brothers here had a picture of an eagle fighting a snake in the sky the eagle does not fight the snake on the ground it picks it up into the sky and changes the Battleground and then it releases the snake into the sky the snake has no stamina no power no balance in the air it's useless weak and vulnerable unlike on the ground where it's powerful and wise and deadly what are you going to do you can't leave that serpent there you can't leave that serpent there on the ground you got to take him into a realm that he don't know where to fight at you got to take him up there what are you saying to us brother Andrew what are you saying what is this whole message take this devil that's trying to rob you of your joy your strength your health whatever it is take it right in the message take it in the message the devil can't live in this message he can't live in this realm he can't live in this atmosphere ask what is doing this message is crushing his head that's why he's coming against the ministry that's why he's coming against worship that's why he's coming against atmosphere I sent brother Ron a quote this morning from Robert E Lee said I was too weak to defend he said so I attacked maybe you too weak to defend your Battleground but attack him and take him right into this message and watch my Jesus show up Amen brother Andrew where do I live at how do I live in sincerity live right here in the message live right here in the message it ain't that hard let me tell you young people I don't know anything else but this message I don't know anything else but it I don't know sports stats I don't know how much money's in Wall Street I don't know how much money is over there in Fort Knox I don't I couldn't tell you how much money the Catholic church has got right but what I do know is this message and this message will defeat Satan every single time I've watched the power of this message put hair back on a little bitty baldheaded girl that had alapa I watched this message take a little bitty baby that didn't know how to talk and she started talking I watch the Power of this message take a little bitty Wesley that didn't know how to walk and made him walk I watch the Power this message take a man that was paralyzed from his waist down falling off a roof and made him walk again I watch the Power of this message take a man that was burned 17 years ago and put him back in the pull pit I watch the Power of this message come when cancer tried to Rob us of a pastor I watch this message be displayed he said if you trust the message I'll use you like never before where you living at where you living at let's go more let's go deeper let's go beyond the surface come on somebody let's go beyond the surface we are tired of playing games what are you saying brother Andrew let me if you're going to make the Rapture you're going to have to be sincere Lord Lord we come to you father Lord I I recognize that sometimes a service like this it begins to get received and thinking where where we living at is there something that I could check up is there fingers being pointed to me is this is
