where so in all of your presence Lord and we're so thankful to you Lord that we have a way father to access you through the blood of Jesus Christ that perfect spotless lamb father Lord that walked the Earth the Lord Jesus two thousand years ago Lord You Came you took a part of our suffering Lord you took a part of our battles Lord in our Humanity Lord so that you can understand Lord so that you can pay the ultimate price for us Lord so that then Lord Jesus we can be clothed in your righteousness oh God what a paradox that we Lord that were born the way we were born with a life that we had that we could literally become born again father the Lord by this Holy Ghost by the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ where we read in the scriptures Lord of how you moved and how you did nothing except the father showed you you were so led by the spirit and you knew where you stood you knew what the word said about you all the devils in hell were subject to you because of who you were and now Lord Jesus your body is on the earth with the same Authority with the same power led by The Same Spirit Conquering the same Devils oh God where what kind of people should we be Lord how could we ever keep from praising you how can we ever keep from thanking you enough for what you've done and Lord you heard each request the Lord that it that was read across this Pulpit this morning Lord and you know each and every desire and one day Lord Jesus you are on the way Lord to heal a Believer a secret believer's daughter who had passed you had your mind set to where you were going and what the father had you do but yet there was a little woman of great faith that in the midst of the crowd she still reached out and she touched you and that touch of Faith was so powerful Lord that it weakened you virtue left your body Lord You're the same God and if you're the same God then that means that the same faith of any believer can touch you with the same touch and we can get what we have need of because Lord your Holy Ghost is here as the great enforcer and you're here to enforce your word you'll see that your word does not fall to the ground that is your priority and that is your will and Lord we commit all these requests there are many but lord they're not too many for you father God whether we're through the valley or on the Mountaintop you're there even if we don't feel you that doesn't change the fact that you're not there and Lord we lift up brother Randy heco teach us now with sister Wanda Lord and father God they're going through a valley but Lord you're there with them and you've seen it before the foundation of the world Lord your love and your healing power does not change based on where we're at we ask Lord Jesus that you just be with him give his body strength give him Joy despite his Humanity give him Joy give him peace give him comfort and Lord for those that have lost loved ones for those that have loved ones on their deathbed Lord it just shows us that no matter what life holds no matter what we accomplish in life the true question is are we ready to meet you that is the question Lord and that is that is true success is that when we've made you when we've made our way back to you and you said that no man can come to me except the father draw him what a blessed people we are Lord that we've even been drawn to you we ask now your blessings over

isn't it good to us amen man God bless you thank the Lord that it's just warm enough it's rain and not cold enough it's ice or snow God bless you sisters one day you'll get snow one day so love you this morning so glad to be here with you to be able to stand and speak the words of life and amen after last night I just thought well maybe we just replay the tape so that was so great amen amen God bless you if you will turn with me in your scriptures this morning I'd like to look at Esther chapter 4 verse 13. and then habakkah chapter 2 I'd like to speak to you for just a short time today on Unleashed potentials Esther chapter 4 and verse 13. and then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther now this is a powerful statement think not with thyself that thou shalt escaped in the King's house more than all the Jews for if thou all together Hold Us thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for such a time as this habakkah chapter 4 2 and verse 2. and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not Tarry you may be seated I want to read to you probably one of my favorite scriptures or portions of scriptures from the Apostle Paul in Romans chapter 8 and verse 28. and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn of many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified he's already did the work it's a finished work in his mind and he said and what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us how shall he not with him freely give us all things all of Heaven belongs to you that ought to make you shout right there who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified and it's as though you never did it in the first place there's not a sin marks against you who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is sitting at risen again and who is at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us all who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or perilous sword that ought to about cover everything as it is written for thy sake we're killed all the day long and were accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things press it nor things to come nor height nor depth or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Give the Lord a great big hand there just think about who is saying this about you not what you are saying about you but who is saying it about you it's always a dangerous thing when you blow your own horn but when you're quoting what God said about you the infinite God that said let there be a sun and moon and stars that same God thought of you before the foundation of the world and placed you in the Lamb's Book of Life and there's not a devil in hell can destroy that thought of God oh my God now I want you to remember what the prophet said now sons and daughters who has the most power before God an angel a servant he said they're his servants what are you his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side a sinner that's been saved by grace has more Authority in heaven than an archangel that stood by his side without a sin because he is a son and a son has more Authority than a servant Hallelujah Hallelujah a quote I found says that spectacular accomplishment is never preceded by less than spectacular preparation brother Brown says this he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church notice these next words and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army he's talking about you more than a squirrel more than a 42 inch Caribou more than a silver tip grizzly bear more than a fish live more than a possum on the porch he's talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ that was God's mission to the Earth with this message Hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah brother bear says I'm so glad that a man can so completely serve God till the devil don't know what to do with him I want to say this to you regardless of your fears and regardless of your anxieties I hope you're awake this morning Satan can't take your life until God is finished with you there is nothing that can happen unto you unless God permits it there's no big evil can come unless God permits it and it's for your good he's working it out [Applause] I want you to remember as God's Prophet as a seer of this age God's thoughts not William branham's thoughts called you the final voice the final witnesses to the final age who is saying that who is declaring you to this position more than a man and I'm saying these words to you more than a man God's saying that about you the other man says that the hour is here if I could have been back there before the days that the world was created and looked down and seen the whole thing and the father had said to me what day would you want to live in I would say now this is the hour this is the greatest hour that the church has ever moved in just before the coming of the bridegroom Jesus would say it like this in Luke chapter 9 and verse 62 and Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and look it back it's fit for the kingdom of God brother Brian said this God's strategy is to take empty-human vessels and shake the world with it Patrick Henry stood to his feet and made a proclamation one day that shook our nation and actually helped create this nation and he used these words he had got them from a preacher here in Culpepper Give me liberty or give me death it was more than a statement it was a life I refused to live in laodicea and just become a part of it this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my citizenship is Way Beyond the United States of America my kingdom is heaven that's where I'm headed to my feet are going to walk on streets of gold my eyes are going to see walls of Jasper and Gates of peril I'm going to stand at the feet of Jesus Christ who is the King of Kings and the Lord of lords I I will sit at the marriage supper of the Lamb there's no going back I'm only pressing forward [Applause] [Music] another man was known by a sermon that or a speech that he gave a man stood in front of him and spoke for two hours nobody remembers his name but when a tall lanky man with a beard with the concern of the whole United States of America that was broken and shattered brother against brother sister against sister a nation divided he gave an address that is remembered to this day that Gettysburg Address where he shook Nations and reminded us that God is God sometimes we have to be reminded of Who We Are nothing great has ever been done without persistence there's no testimony that's ever been molded and been able to put down on paper unless it was definite overcoming life is not Hollywood life is difficult there's going to be some trouble in your life you haven't had trouble it's just you're getting ready for it trouble may be behind you you may be going through it and trouble's going to be in front of you we were born in sin we were shaping an iniquity man is born of woman in his few days and full of trouble but God said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he's an infinite God I heard brother Brown say the other day he knows how many fleas that's been in the Earth how many times that they batted their eyes and the highest species more than an angel but Sons and Daughters of God that's how much God thinks about you it's not how much the world thinks about you it's not even how much you think about yourself it's what God thinks about you and with our God there's nothing that is impossible brother round said give me it give me a housewife give me he says notice this give me a preacher give me a Christian give me a housewife give me a farmer a factory worker that'll put God first in everything and I'll show you a man that'll be successful in spite of all that the devil can put on him Give the Lord a great big hand right there [Applause] Mike shazefski one of the greatest coaches that ever lived his team was was down like never before a record amount he brought him into a huddle they came out of that huddle and shut the other team down and they want an epic fashion many would ask him what did the players what did he say in the Huddle that made everything change did he scream at you did he berate you did he say anything bad and all of them are said with the same chorus no he reminded us of Who We Are Angelo Dundee who was the groin of the greatest Corner men for boxers he trained a lot of men like Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard and a lot of men and there's one of a couple of these statements he said I didn't have to tell Ali how to fight I just had to remind him of who he was he was losing an incredible bout about it shouldn't be lucid and he got him into the ring and he got him into the corner he says you're gonna blow it son you're going to blow it remember who you are I want you to remember that statement sometimes I like to scream it in some people's ear you're going to block it we're right at the rap so keep your focus get over yourself [Applause] ever yourself get yourself out of the way your greatest enemy is not your husband wife Pastor teacher not the president of the United States your greatest enemy is yourself I flunked the sixth grade all F's it must have been they needed somebody to go to the seventh grade so they promoted me forward to the seventh grade I don't understand to this day there was a teacher named Mrs Bennett she was a seventh grade teacher one day she called me out of another lady's class she called me in that lady was named Mrs Hall I disdained her I used to stain for a good word there she called me out of that class and took me to a desk and sat down and she said Mr Spencer you're probably one of the most talented people that I've ever taught you'll probably have the greatest gift that I've ever taught or ever will teach but you haven't recognized it you need to reach deep within yourself and find that gift she would pull me into her class moved me from another class and pull me into her class then in studied Halls she would take me and and and I would spend time in her class and every day she had me to write short stories when I would give a little dilatory kind of lose my focus she would remind me you're not looking deep enough you're only looking at the outside you're not looking deep enough fate would have it that her husband would pass away our principal his wife would pass away both from cancer they would marry in my 30s I cleaned her chimney I didn't know who I was cleaning the chimney for when I finished cleaning the chimney she said I'd like for you to sit down here and she looked me in the eyes and she said Ron I want to talk to you she said maybe nobody else has had history with you like I have she said but you still have not discovered the gift within you I talked to you in the seventh grade look deep within yourself reach down there she looked at me and she said Chimney Sweep is not your purpose in life that's not your purpose that's your job but you haven't reached deep enough inside to find what God's gift is in your life a school teacher taught me that a school teacher would tell me that in my 30s I'd like to stand as your pastor and say some of you need to reach deep with inside yourself I've never told yourself told you those statements but sometimes we gotta need to look back and say well brother Ron I've been through a lot of pain in my life sometimes your pain becomes your strength sometimes your pain becomes the courage to drive you forward blind can't hear cancer whatever the situation is your new life your DNA grab bag that you've been given in your life you're greater than all of that brother run but I've made some mistakes but you lived through it get up I'm gonna scream to you get up I want to stand in your corner this morning get up reach deep within yourself [Applause] some people have a doctorate degree on pity party some people have a doctorate degree and all about themselves you don't dare ask them how are you today you know you'll be there 30 minutes let's get lower one day Thomas Edison came home and gave a paper to his mother he told her said my teacher gave me this paper to me and told me that to only give it to my mother his mother's eyes were tearful as she read the letter out loud to her child your son is a genius this school is too small for him and doesn't have enough good teachers for for training him please teach him yourself after many years after Edison's mother died and he was now one of the greatest inventors of the century one day he was looking through old family things and suddenly he saw an old foil did paper and the corner of the drawer in the desk and he ought took it and he opened it and the paper was written your son is mentally ill we won't let him come to school anymore and Edison cried for hours and then he wrote in his diary Thomas Calvin Edison what's a mentally ill child that my hero mother became the genius of the century oh yeah I would say there's some Mrs Bennett's Sitting In This Crowd there are some teachers that care and they look Beyond family problems and they look Beyond DNA situations and they look for the potential in a child that's acting up a child that's having great difficulties if they can capture that that's what's inside of them and get them to realize the gift that's on the inside you don't need to tell them how bad they are how horrible they are how miserable they are just tell them what they can become the word dumb the word stupid should never come out of your mouth toward your children if you've used those words to your your children repent it's because you had a demon out of hell foreign he was talked to like that I pray that you looked above what your parents told you one of the greatest preachers that I know was told he would never amount to nothing maybe you've been told you'd never amount to nothing I was but I didn't listen I chose not to listen to my critics what could be said there but I won't that's a bride of Jesus Christ you have his potential inside of you more than the DNA of your mom and daddy they are actually your weakness and when you catch that they are actually your weakness but God put something on the inside of you that's him and when he plants a seed whether it's grass or flowers or trees it reproduces itself cows reproduce cows that's what they do you've got horses and you may not understand it now but when horses have colts you don't go out there and find a calf they produce horses that's what they do so what happens when the Kentucky Derby is getting ready and the Preakness and the Belmont men look at DNA and they search the DNA and sometimes they pay millions of dollars for the DNA of the black line because it UPS the odds of having a champion but once in a while a horse will be soaked because it doesn't look like a champion it doesn't act like a champion but somebody that's got an eye will see it going around the ring and he'll give fifteen thousand dollars for it and he'll put it in the he'll put it in training because he knows there's something on the inside of it if he can only get that horse to believe it and catch it that's how much the last year's Kentucky Derby winner went for fifteen thousand dollars everybody else didn't believe he was a champion but one man did the whole world was against you even Lucifer himself said there's nothing in you but God but God said I planted something else inside of him before the foundation were on [Applause] and God reproduces God [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah the the members of the Virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they're subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our head notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was shown to him by the Father John 5 19. this harmony is now to exist between the the groom and the bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it I like that he shows her his Word of Life she receives it and she never doubts it Glory never doubt it why don't you just say it with me she never doubts it and for nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of it the word in the is in the bride as it was in Mary and the bride has the same mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word and she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that it's planted and watered and it comes full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride only do his will no one can make them do otherwise I read that this morning again and again and again and again and again and I said there's not a devil in hell can make me do otherwise there's no power can make me do otherwise my future is clear I walked to the pulpit this morning you think well our brother Ron's just preaching a motivational sermon yep I am But the irony of it is I probably had one of the most difficult nights as I as a human ever ever had but that's all right that's all right his word's still true all right [Applause] they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he was in his Earthly Ministry so now he works and in through the bride he's talking about you brother Branham never shook her hands from for most of us 99 of us never preached in public to us but you've heard the words you've caught the message a lot of people looked at it said that's not for me that's right it wasn't for it it wasn't for them listen let's just be real honest with you this ain't for everybody this ain't for everybody this is for a select group of people you look at it and say that's the mirror that's exactly what I believe that's right you can show your neighbor you can show your family and they laugh at they make fun of it but it's alive to you and there's not a devil in hell can shake you away from it brother man said Jesus is waiting on his church to get ready his bride has made herself ready we got the potentials the holy spirit is here God is here the power to heal the sick the power to do all things that Christ did I've seen it demonstrated Myself by the holy spirit so the potentials is him but listen as long as it lays in potential form it's dormant you're gonna have a bag of very well certified seed but until you plant it it's only sitting in sight form in the side of the barn but you put it in the ground under the right conditions it will come up it will reproduce itself there will be nights maybe nights that you come here and you feel like you've just almost made a rapture enjoy those nights because there's going to be days you come here that you feel like every devil in hell everybody's talking about you every eye is on you you feel like you've got the moly growth but God is God hey God is God whether you feel him or you don't feel him whether everybody shook her hand on nobody shook your hand whether everybody smiled at you and nobody smiled at you whether you're feeling good or you're feeling horrible God is still God he's still God and if God before us [Applause] your name you're asked for your signature your signature is unlike anybody else's some of you can't read your own signature every one of you have a different fingerprint every one of you have a different eye pattern every eye pattern in this building is different not only that in the whole world is different God made you special you're fearfully and wonderfully made God made you that way that's why nobody can praise God like you can praise God there's much reason nobody can worship God like you can worship God and God is so big you can be in thousands of people worshiping God he can hear you and you may be in the midst of the deepest valley that you've ever been in your life and he can hear your prayer [Music] so reach deep with inside of yourself and remember who you are and what you have been called to and the weapons that he has placed at your disposal and across your lips instead of confessing negative confess positive I am healed I am healed I am victorious you may not realize that but your name makes the kingdom of Hell shudder Shadrach Meshach could have been to go still makes the the world shadow let me just say shamgar still makes kingdoms of Hell shut up it reminds Satan we sent 600 demons to his house and he whipped every one of us and so be careful when you go to Full Gospel Lighthouse you better take a thousand and one if you're gonna do any good and then just look at the Devil you stupid devil I got the word of God and prayer is like an atomic bomb and when I start praying and words start going across my lips my prayer may feel like it only goes to the ceiling but my prayer goes to the great intercessor himself and I call the King of Kings the greatest champion on the scene and he is here [Applause] brother Branham called you lived voices Paul would call you written Epistles sometimes we come into the Earth and we think well what is my purpose what is my purpose Stephen do you mind if I pick on you just for a moment the gift that you have to be able to stand behind the pulpat and sing a song Hollywood would love to have Nashville would love to have it they'd like to produce that they try to train that but God put it inside of you and the enemy will remind you over and over again you're nobody does he tell you that you're nobody you're never going to be successful you're never good well remind him I've got a house that will never fade away and maybe the devil's whispered in your ear you'll never get married you'll never find a mate you'll never you have got so many complexes you'll never get anybody and yet you can say Hey listen in my eternal realm I'm going to have the right one we're going to spend eternity and I'm going to have children there yeah because God knows what's the potential of you can I preach to you can I preach to you that's what that's what Hollywood's looking for that's what the Kentucky Derpy guys are looking for potential and God knows what he put in you God's not guessing brother Lawrence brother Jordan God's not guessing but the rain no matter how much The Devil Makes You question yourself God's not in the guessing game he knows what he planted so when buddy Robinson he knew that he would he would travel two million miles have a hundred thousand conversions preach 33 000 sermons and Peter Cartwright who brother random would say call him out in in the greatest battle ever thought he actually preached in our area here another man would talk about when he was getting ready to have a Revival in the town and in that town he's cleaning the windows he's got the doors open and the bully of the Town said before you can have a Revival here you got to whip me he got down off of the ladder he rolled his sleeves up and whipped him he was at a meeting where 30 men walked in and wanted to fight him he whipped every one of them man you think we're brutal preachers and the Sunday after preaching that after whipping 30 men all of the other ministers said we'll have nothing to say after after what took place here on Wednesday night he said well I'll preach and he preached on the Gates of Hell will not prevail and the service went all day Sunday and all night Sunday night and all day Monday and all night Monday night all day Tuesday and all day Tuesday and on Wednesday they baptized 300 people God's Got A Plan Nathan will not worth it Robert sheffy who is one of my favorite of life carried a lamb stem because his life had been so wretched as a child and he prayed and whiskey steals would be broken down by a tree way up in the top of the mountains and it would pray and you pray for a Mighty Oak Tree to come down off of that mountain and Crush that steel later in the night storms would come not just one time by coincidence but many times that happened most of the time the steel guy became the pastor of the local church one day he was down praying and in his prayer he said Lord I haven't had any persecution for weeks and about that time a a rock went past his head was he he said Thank You Lord a man named Spurgeon he was called the prince of preachers his own church put him out his own schools put him out but he still built one of the greatest biggest Metropolitan Halls one of the greatest churches that ever ever was built in that time it was a friend that was walking with him enlightened and struck that friend and killed him I say we're walking down the street and he said if God spared my life I give my life to Jesus Christ and he would go on to preach some of the greatest messages for his time that ever lived I'll just for for lack of time man named Moody Moody who is known for having 500 000 Souls come to the altar during his life he preached and he came to the end of his service and he ran out of time and didn't have an altar call Chicago burned down that night Moody went into an incredible depression he actually would move from the United States of America running and he was sitting in a barbershop chair everybody was talking and yakking and Moody was sitting in that chair and all of a sudden without saying a word men fell on their knees and began to cry out to God he never said a word as a man cut his hair he said I would never cut a man's hair with that kind of a presence when they asked him later they said find out who that man is that would cause that kind of a presence and he said I promised God I'll never preach again and so some men just talked to him said well why don't you just address the audience maybe just give a little testimony service asking a preacher to testify is like asking the Niagara Falls to quit running when you start talking about God and how great he is and Moody began to preach and came back to America and would shake the world in his day do you see he was trying to hide what was laying on the inside of him wake up children here we are God is planted something on the inside of you that you don't have to pump up you don't have to prime it the seed has got life inside of itself it has been predestinated to have the resources that it meets to meet the challenge of the hour the word that you're listening to will change your body now sometimes you walk in you walk into a service and you think man I don't know if I can contribute anything to this service I am drained from the weak how many has ever felt like that and then all of a sudden that song leader who's inspired he starts singing and he'll start singing another song before long your foot starts working and your hands start working and you start singing the testimony because songs is only testimonies and you start singing and words come across your lips that you start believing from your heart and all of a sudden you create an atmosphere around yourself all right be careful if you make fun of shouting be careful if you make fun of worship you know it's probably you've never been you've never got into it yourself so you'll only make fun of it because you've never been there but if you've ever been there if you knew what I know if you could only have went to what I have went through if you could have only walked through the valleys that I've walked to just give me a few minutes I I want to thank the Lord [Applause] just give me a few moments if I can preach to you just for a few moments and make you realize who you are then on Monday morning you'll get out of bed and go together [Applause] bird ever that's more than a book it's more than a tape it's more than a sermon now [Applause] won't you just raise your hands and Worship the Lord right there he called you bone of food bones he called your life of his life he placed your spirit his spirit in you he put them's own self inside of you knowing you couldn't conquer by yourself he put himself inside of you Hallelujah the Holy Spirit the trainer himself is here he knows what's in there you know reach deep inside Rich deep inside we're sleep inside do you know what he planted do you know how powerful it is you can stand brother Greg one day I'd like to if God in his great infancy could maybe somewhere maybe somewhere take us to a place maybe he would just ask us would you like to see how I created the sun moon and stars I'd be I'd sign up I'd say hey oh yeah I won't see that Hey listen I want to see that I thought of it this is what I want to do and so when I thought of a son I wanted a son that would never go out would have enough energy that would heat planets millions of miles away and the seeds that was in the dirt maybe 12 15 even 40 feet deep that I put enough just the right amount of heat on them until one day they'll wake up and all the sudden start fighting through the mud and all of a sudden start coming out Ron as a matter of fact all through your DNA I watched you all the way down since Adam and I watched your grandfathers go to war and I protected them and I watched I

was bringing your seed to Virginia and they went through incredible turmoil but I was watching over them when they thought they would die they were carrying your DNA and I refused to let them die run when your daddy first saw you he said you're the ugliest baby he ever seen [Music] dad always had a way with words [Music] I was dark my head was all twisted in maybe that's what my dad could see but
