[42:32] Lord in prayer this morning Heavenly
[42:34] Father we approach you father Lord
[42:37] knowing father there could have been a
[42:39] many different chapters in our story
[42:43] father Lord but you decided Lord to take
[42:46] up the pen and begin to write out the
[42:49] story Lord how the song would sing it of
[42:53] Amazing Grace a predestination
[42:56] father Lord we recognize that we're in a
[42:59] moment in time Lord that we we're here
[43:02] as we're gathered as the children of God
[43:05] lord we can sing these songs that
[43:07] Blessed assurance that Jesus is mine
[43:11] been through many a trials and many
[43:13] troubles but Lord through it all you've
[43:15] been right there holding our hand you
[43:17] promised us that you never leave us and
[43:19] you never forsake us Lord we look back
[43:22] and we see the footprints on the sands
[43:24] of time seen that it was in those
[43:27] moments that you were carrying us father
[43:29] we just want to be mindful today Lord as
[43:32] we enter into your presence Lord the
[43:34] atmosphere that has been said Lord the
[43:36] songs that have been sung we are
[43:38] standing father Lord just like you stood
[43:41] up in this generation we're standing now
[43:44] as a bride body we are standing under
[43:46] the fullness of our revelation of who we
[43:49] are and I pray today Lord that you would
[43:52] just come amongst us as a church body
[43:54] today you'd begin to to minister unto us
[43:57] according to thy promises that are rich
[43:59] in grace and mercy father Lord there's a
[44:02] certain allotment for this day Lord and
[44:04] I pray that you would begin to release
[44:06] the things that you have on your heart
[44:08] for this moment in time to give us give
[44:11] us Faith to go through the Journey I
[44:14] pray you be at the needs of your body
[44:16] today we commit them unto you in Jesus
[44:19] name amen amen amen if you have your
[44:22] Bibles today we'd like to look over in
[44:25] the Book of Genesis chapter 15 also down
[44:28] to Joshua chapter 1 and I know that
[44:31] you've had a wonderful week amen I know
[44:34] that uh I know that many of you that are
[44:38] have been a part or seen some of these
[44:40] testimonies that has came out this week
[44:42] of people just sharing what the Lord has
[44:44] done with them just at the end of
[44:47] service last week we just felt a
[44:48] commission to just a commission to
[44:52] testify and we've seen the the benefits
[44:55] of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done
[44:57] amongst his bride body and and I just
[45:00] thank the Lord for it all and what we're
[45:02] seeing it's it's stirring up the the
[45:04] spirit of faith on the inside of a body
[45:07] of Believers to believe that all things
[45:08] are possible we know those things but to
[45:10] see a God In Action that's what this
[45:13] message is it's a God in action and to
[45:15] see that displayed in front of us and I
[45:18] believe great things will come out of
[45:19] this but I want you to know as well it's
[45:21] stirring up the spirit of Faith but it's
[45:23] also stir stirring up the spirit of hell
[45:25] as well so you just stand firm on your
[45:27] testimony you're the one that said it
[45:30] you're the one that was there that God
[45:31] met you there you you put a mark down
[45:33] and God met you there I think it's a
[45:36] wonderful thing I think we should never
[45:38] grow tired of testifying of the power of
[45:40] our Lord Jesus Christ amen Genesis CH 15
[45:45] and verse 4 and the Bible said here and
[45:48] behold the word of the Lord came unto
[45:50] him this speaking to Abram said this
[45:53] shall not be thine heir but he that
[45:56] shall come forth out of thine own bows
[45:59] shall be thine Heir and he brought him
[46:00] forth abroad and said look now toward
[46:04] heaven and tell the Stars if thou be
[46:06] able to number them and he said unto him
[46:08] so shall thy seed be and he believed in
[46:12] the Lord and He accounted it to him for
[46:14] righteousness and he said unto him I am
[46:17] the Lord that brought thee out of her of
[46:20] the ches and to give thee this land to
[46:24] inherit it and he said Lord God whereby
[46:27] shall I know that I shall inherit it
[46:31] also Joshua chap 1 and verse one if you
[46:35] go reading the rest of Genesis chapter
[46:38] 15 you'll find that there Abraham
[46:40] prepares a a sacrifice and an altar and
[46:43] he begins to lay things out before the
[46:45] Lord just to see how shall I know that I
[46:48] shall inherit these things brother
[46:50] brandham said something very profound
[46:52] about that he said that God put Abraham
[46:54] to sleep to show him to show Abraham you
[46:57] don't have nothing to do with this and I
[47:00] believe that that that is the key in a
[47:02] lot of Our Lives if we can just allow
[47:04] allow the Lord to take control instead
[47:06] of us we don't have nothing to do with
[47:08] this it's his job he will get us where
[47:11] he needs to get us to Joshua chap 1 and
[47:14] verse one and the Bible said here now
[47:17] after the death of Moses the servant of
[47:20] the Lord it came to pass that the Lord
[47:22] spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses
[47:25] Moses Minister saying notice we're
[47:27] watching a transition here in the
[47:30] ministry and Moses my servant is dead
[47:34] now therefore arise and go over this
[47:36] Jordan thou and all this people under
[47:39] the land which I do give unto them even
[47:42] to the children of Israel and notice
[47:44] Moses was dead but his message was not
[47:47] dead every place verse three every place
[47:50] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[47:51] upon that I have given unto you let's
[47:55] say that together that have I given unto
[47:57] you as I said unto Moses from the
[48:00] Wilderness and this Lebanon even under
[48:02] the great river Euphrates all the land
[48:05] of the Hittites and under the great sea
[48:07] toward the going down of the sun shall
[48:10] be your Coast there shall not any man be
[48:14] able to stand before thee all the days
[48:16] of thy life as I was with Moses so I
[48:20] will be with thee I will not fail thee
[48:23] nor forsake thee and that gives us great
[48:25] courage right there doesn't it to think
[48:27] that we can tie that together with
[48:29] Romans with the book of Romans of
[48:30] chapter 8 and said what shall what shall
[48:32] we then say to these things if God be
[48:34] for us who can be against us not any
[48:37] man's going to be able to stand before
[48:38] you all the days of your life verse six
[48:41] be strong and of a good courage For unto
[48:43] this people Thou shalt divide an
[48:46] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[48:49] their fathers to give them only be
[48:51] strong and very courageous that thou
[48:53] mayest observe to do according according
[48:55] to all the law which Moses my servant
[48:59] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[49:01] right hand or to the left that thou
[49:03] mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest
[49:06] this book of the law shall not depart
[49:08] out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[49:10] therein day and not thou mayest observe
[49:14] that thou mayest observe to do according
[49:16] to all that is written therein for then
[49:18] Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and
[49:21] then Thou shalt have good success have
[49:23] not I commanded thee be strong and of a
[49:26] good courage Be not Afraid neither be
[49:28] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[49:31] with thee withs soever thou goest may
[49:35] God bless his word you may be seated
[49:36] today in the presence of the Lord as we
[49:40] stated to you last
[49:41] weekend that we we were dealt with by by
[49:45] the Lord in in in our in our sleep a few
[49:48] few weeks ago on on this thought and I
[49:51] know it's a very vast subject so I I
[49:53] intend uh by the help of the the Lord to
[49:56] take maybe a few services on this
[49:58] thought today on dividing The
[50:01] Inheritance dividing The Inheritance and
[50:03] we recognize that that is a very very
[50:05] vast subject that we could spend the
[50:07] rest of our Christian Life talking about
[50:09] dividing The Inheritance but I believe
[50:11] that it's it's we are in a very special
[50:13] season as the body of Jesus Christ we
[50:16] recognize what commission that we are
[50:18] under here we are not under a Moses
[50:20] commission but we are under a Joshua
[50:22] commission we understand what Joshua's
[50:24] Commission was it was to go in there not
[50:27] to re not to recreate a new message but
[50:29] it was simply to take the same message
[50:32] and go in there and possess the to go in
[50:35] there and possess the land and we
[50:36] recognize as we just jump into this
[50:38] today that as the children of Israel and
[50:41] the Seed of Abraham that the elect of
[50:43] God that they had been given a certain
[50:46] of of a allotment of inheritance as
[50:49] their portion all the way back all the
[50:51] way back from their forefather Abraham
[50:54] it had been promised under to them that
[50:55] they were going to have an inheritance
[50:58] that they were going to go in there and
[50:59] they were going to have a portion they
[51:01] were going to have a portion that was a
[51:03] lot it specifically unto them and that
[51:06] word divide it means to separate into
[51:08] portions and and to give each man
[51:10] according to to what is rightfully his
[51:13] and there we recognize that Abraham
[51:16] Abraham has given a word of the Lord to
[51:18] him that is he's telling him that your
[51:19] seed is going to go in there and they're
[51:22] going to inherit it but we recognize
[51:24] that when when God is speaking to
[51:26] Abraham he's not just necessarily
[51:28] speaking to him about where he's at in
[51:30] his current life he is speaking to him a
[51:32] message that is out there in his future
[51:35] so we recognize that the promise was to
[51:37] Abraham's seed and to his seed after him
[51:40] so we recognize that that when when God
[51:43] is speaking to Abraham when he speaks
[51:45] those word it means inherit it means
[51:48] something that you've got to go in and
[51:50] you've got to dispossess that and you
[51:52] see notice that word it is a future word
[51:55] inheritance is something that has
[51:57] already happened and it's been left
[51:59] behind but here God is speaking to
[52:01] Abraham and he's telling him you are
[52:04] going to go in there and you're going to
[52:05] inherit this land and when God speaks
[52:08] those words to Abraham it immediately
[52:11] Clicks in Abraham's mind there's
[52:13] something out there for me that maybe I
[52:15] don't see just yet but there's something
[52:17] there that I've got a job to do I've got
[52:19] to go out there I've got to follow the
[52:22] leadership of the Lord and you know
[52:24] maybe Abraham himself s NE never stepped
[52:26] full in the full Properties or the full
[52:29] manifestations of the promise of God but
[52:31] he did step in that in his seed in that
[52:34] is that right so we recognize that it
[52:36] was something that was in the future for
[52:38] Abraham as God was saying that if you
[52:41] look into that word in the Hebrew word
[52:43] it means to dispossess that there there
[52:46] were men that were in that land you know
[52:48] that if you go to studying out those
[52:50] histories that at that time there were
[52:52] men that wasn't even on that land but
[52:54] Satan was standing really close when God
[52:56] was speaking to Abraham and as soon as
[52:59] the promise begin to go out of Abraham's
[53:01] mouth that men begin to go in there and
[53:03] go to inhabit that land isn't that
[53:06] exactly how Satan does you that God will
[53:09] give you a promise of the baptism of the
[53:10] Holy Ghost and there the squatter will
[53:13] begin to go in there and go move in on
[53:15] your property that's what the word
[53:17] inherit means it means to dispossess so
[53:21] Abraham has showing God is showing to
[53:23] Abraham that you're going to receive an
[53:26] inheritance and if you're going to ever
[53:28] receive something as an inheritance as
[53:31] as somebody that is that is something
[53:33] that has been left behind you have to be
[53:35] an heir you have to be an heir of of of
[53:39] of The Inheritance or you're not going
[53:41] to be able to grab of what was laying
[53:43] there in the wheel in Testament and you
[53:45] know you know that be before maybe a
[53:48] mother or a father if they leave behind
[53:50] certain possessions in the whe you see
[53:53] that executive he's got a a job to do
[53:55] he's got to go in there and show points
[53:58] that this is what the the father's will
[54:01] was this is what the mother wanted or
[54:03] maybe it was some rich uncle that that
[54:05] that that left you something you've got
[54:07] to identify yourself in The Inheritance
[54:10] before you can never receive anything
[54:13] you know there there's actually websites
[54:14] that you can go on and search out your
[54:16] name and find if somebody's left you
[54:18] some lost long inheritance out there I I
[54:22] personally don't have anybody out there
[54:23] that's decided to do that to
[54:26] me yeah there's a website out there for
[54:28] it but the Bible said in Romans
[54:32] 8:14 that as many as are led by the
[54:34] spirit they are the sons of God I may
[54:37] not have an inheritance in the natural
[54:39] of somebody that was rich in the natural
[54:42] that left me anything but I do have a
[54:44] heavenly father that owns the cattle on
[54:46] a thousand hills he owns the gold on the
[54:49] inside of the mountains and he's able to
[54:51] leave us in inheritance but we don't
[54:53] just want Natural Things from God do we
[54:56] we don't want just Health just here we
[54:58] don't want just benefits of driving a
[55:00] nice car and having a nice house there's
[55:03] something there that God's got for us
[55:05] and I I believe that if God's left us
[55:07] something then we ought to jump right
[55:09] into it the Bible goes on to say for you
[55:12] have not received the spirit of bondage
[55:14] again to fear but you've received the
[55:16] spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba
[55:20] Father the spirit itself beareth witness
[55:22] with our spirit that we are the children
[55:25] of God and if children then hirs and
[55:28] Heirs of God and join HS with Christ if
[55:30] so be that we suffer with him that we
[55:33] may be also glorified together I think
[55:35] it's a very powerful thing to recognize
[55:38] yourself as a son and daughter of God
[55:41] you know before you can ever go in and
[55:43] fully possess your inheritance whether
[55:46] it be from your mother your father your
[55:47] grandfather you've got to show your
[55:49] identity you've got to show who you are
[55:52] you've got to have some you've got to
[55:53] have some certificates you've got to
[55:55] have an identity that allows you to go
[55:58] into the lawyer's office and put put a
[56:00] claim down that I am a part of this
[56:02] Kinsman I'm a part of this one and when
[56:05] you have the right identity to it that's
[56:07] why Jesus would tell Nicodemus that's
[56:10] why you must be born again because
[56:13] without this identity there's a lot of
[56:15] people that are coming out with their
[56:17] hands open they're got their hands out
[56:19] trying to grab the inheritance but they
[56:21] don't have an identity to attach thems
[56:25] to The
[56:26] Inheritance now come on somebody I'm
[56:28] preaching to you the message because the
[56:30] reason why that you have the ability to
[56:33] grab a hold of this inheritance of
[56:35] Malachi 4's Ministry is because you've
[56:38] been birthed under it you didn't come
[56:40] out under Moses's Ministry you wern't
[56:43] baptized under Moses's Ministry but you
[56:45] have been
[56:46] baptized you have been baptized under
[56:49] the ministry of Malachi 4 and you can
[56:52] identify
[56:53] yourself
[56:55] you can identify yourself with this
[56:58] message and when you have the right
[57:00] identity you can go into the lawyer you
[57:03] can go before the judge and said I have
[57:06] every right to go in there and possess
[57:09] my god-given
[57:11] privileges you've got every right to go
[57:14] in there if your life lines up with the
[57:17] promises that are there if it says it's
[57:20] for John Smith and your name is in John
[57:23] Smith on
[57:26] come on somebody let me preach to you a
[57:28] little bit if your name doesn't line up
[57:30] with it then something is wrong with
[57:32] what you're trying to attach yourself to
[57:35] but if your name is in the book if your
[57:38] name is in the book your identity is
[57:40] there that's why you can't see anything
[57:43] else but Malachi 4 that's why you can't
[57:45] see anything else but William Bram and
[57:47] Malachi 4 it's because you're there as
[57:52] well behold I will send you my name is
[57:57] there I can't see anything else brother
[58:00] hoopin my name is there Hallelujah
[58:04] blessed be the name of the Lord you see
[58:07] his presence is vindicating
[58:10] truth that he is here to make sure that
[58:13] you receive of this will and testament
[58:16] so we recognize we recognize that there
[58:19] is an authority here to make you align
[58:22] yourself with this inheritance
[58:25] now notice that when God is up there on
[58:28] the mountain in Genesis chap 22 when
[58:31] he's spending time with the patriarch
[58:33] Abraham because Abraham trusts God he's
[58:36] put his full trust in him he takes his
[58:39] son up there and he and he he goes all
[58:42] the way up there I believe it's very
[58:45] powerful that you go all the way with
[58:47] the word of the
[58:48] Lord is that right notice what he does
[58:52] God begins to have a conversation with
[58:54] him him and he he stops him in the part
[58:57] of the process when he's getting ready
[59:00] to kill his own son and said no I've
[59:03] already provided a way for you and he
[59:05] begins to talk to him what is he doing
[59:08] he first shows himself as Jehovah Gyra
[59:11] to Abraham but he doesn't just leave it
[59:14] to Abraham he shows it to all of the
[59:17] seed you see it wasn't just William
[59:20] branham's message it wasn't just
[59:22] Abraham's message it was his seed's
[59:25] message and he begins to tell them I am
[59:28] Jehovah dyra I provided this lamb I
[59:31] provided this way you couldn't done this

[1:00:18] ministry of Jehovah
[1:00:23] Gyra you just fast forward just a minute
[1:00:26] you go all the way to the time of Moses

[1:00:31] has got his commission he's up there and
[1:00:33] meets a pillar of fire for himself and
[1:00:35] the pillar of fire comes off of the Bush
[1:00:38] and comes into Moses he said I will take
[1:00:41] you to me for a people and I will be to
[1:00:45] you a God and you shall know that I am
[1:00:47] the Lord your God which bringeth you out
[1:00:49] from under the burdens of the Egyptians
[1:00:52] and I will bring you into the land
[1:00:55] concerning the which I did swear to give
[1:00:57] to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I will
[1:01:02] give it you for inheritage I am the
[1:01:07] Lord you got to think where they're
[1:01:09] living at you got to think about the
[1:01:11] spot that these that these people that
[1:01:13] were listening to the message of the day
[1:01:15] where they were living at they were
[1:01:17] living in a much chaotic time like
[1:01:20] you're living in they were living in a
[1:01:22] time when when there when there were
[1:01:23] people that was trying to move them out
[1:01:26] they were trying to bruise them they
[1:01:28] were trying to put them under slave
[1:01:30] mentality they were doing everything
[1:01:32] within them to crush out the very idea
[1:01:35] that God was going to raise up a
[1:01:37] deliverer but notice that God begins to
[1:01:41] speak directly to them he sends a
[1:01:43] prophet messenger by their way and he
[1:01:45] begins to deliver the
[1:01:47] message when Moses is up there and said
[1:01:50] who am I going to tell him send
[1:01:52] me what did William brandham say who am
[1:01:54] I going to say did this who am I going
[1:01:56] to tell don't you worry I'll be with you

[1:02:18] the age that they were living in it was
[1:02:20] getting really hot it's been over 400
[1:02:23] years since Joseph was around that
[1:02:25] Pharaoh don't even know anything about

[1:02:44] down there that got Israel out of the
[1:02:47] out of the problems that they were in

[1:09:51] that's where we are we've come we'
[1:09:54] become from Mortal beings from time
[1:09:55] beings to Eternal beings when the word
[1:09:58] of God lit our souls and we become Sons
[1:10:00] and Daughters of God with the attributes
[1:10:03] the gene of God to be Sons and Daughters
[1:10:05] of God in heaven crying ABA father you

[1:10:12] genos of
[1:10:14] God think that's that's where it all

[1:10:58] soul you got something out there in
[1:11:00] front of

[1:11:05] I'm just going to make a point and go on
[1:11:07] I don't want to spend too much time here
[1:11:08] but I absolutely loved this last weekend
[1:11:10] when brother Ron was preaching he
[1:11:12] started singing that song you don't know
[1:11:13] like I know and the spirit of God began
[1:11:15] to move out
[1:11:16] here forgive me sis I thought it was
[1:11:19] very powerful but sister with sister
[1:11:23] Devon
[1:11:24] she stepped out there to the end of that
[1:11:26] aisle I thought it was amazing she was
[1:11:29] giving the Lord
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:32] opportunity used to go in used to go in
[1:11:34] dances back in the day and everybody was
[1:11:36] so scared everybody so scared they stand
[1:11:38] back up against the wall just waiting on
[1:11:41] somebody to come across the
[1:11:44] room she looking at
[1:11:49] me I thought it was amazing sis she got
[1:11:53] out there there and gave her dancing
[1:11:55] partner an opportunity to come and when
[1:11:58] Jesus stepped out said I'll be a dancing
[1:12:01] partner let me tell you what you got to
[1:12:04] do in your promises if giv God an
[1:12:07] opportunity to be everything that he
[1:12:10] said he would
[1:12:13] be come on somebody we ain't over there
[1:12:16] in the wall trying to figure out if he
[1:12:18] wants us or not we're right here in the
[1:12:20] arena of God's company he's here he's
[1:12:25] not coming he's
[1:12:28] here he's here why shouldn't we praise
[1:12:31] him why shouldn't we love him why
[1:12:33] shouldn't we give our all to
[1:12:36] him I know who I
[1:12:39] am I'm identified as the body of Jesus
[1:12:47] Christ well blessed be the name of the
[1:12:51] Lord I got a lot a land to
[1:12:56] cover but I'm not going to cover it all
[1:12:58] one
[1:13:01] day I'm going to get to a
[1:13:04] part I'm going to divide that
[1:13:05] inheritance for the
[1:13:08] day and y'all can to have it go home and
[1:13:11] eat on the land of
[1:13:14] it we got 60 Mi across and we got 75
[1:13:19] miles that we've got to conquer we got
[1:13:22] some land to go out
[1:13:24] you may not see all of it just yet but
[1:13:26] there's some land out there ain't very
[1:13:28] big is it brother you can go 75 miles in
[1:13:31] a day 60 miles that way but that's your
[1:13:35] land and I'll tell you this if it's got
[1:13:38] my name on it I got every right to
[1:13:41] go out there and lay my claim on
[1:13:44] it that land does not represent Heaven
[1:13:47] that land had Wars in it it had killings
[1:13:50] in it but brother brandom said what it
[1:13:52] did identify identified that it was a
[1:13:55] type of the Holy Spirit but notice what
[1:13:58] the Bible said in Ephesians 1:11 in whom
[1:14:01] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:14:03] let's say that together obtained an
[1:14:05] inheritance being predestinated
[1:14:08] according to the purpose of him who
[1:14:10] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:14:12] his own will that word obtain it
[1:14:14] literally means to acquire by lot or
[1:14:19] then to receive in whom we have also
[1:14:24] obtained an inheritance brother brand
[1:14:27] goes in the message of adoption if you
[1:14:29] ain't listened to it for for a while go
[1:14:30] in there and listen to those
[1:14:32] things but brother bandam it's very
[1:14:34] powerful he said we have obtained an
[1:14:37] inheritance he said somebody has to
[1:14:39] leave you something is that right
[1:14:41] somebody's got to leave you something he
[1:14:43] said so God before the foundation of the
[1:14:46] world left you
[1:14:48] something you want to know what he left
[1:14:50] you brother Chris a name written on a
[1:14:52] book that when the lamb had been slain
[1:14:54] you'd be recognized with him what's my
[1:14:57] inheritance my name wasn't written down
[1:15:01] 15 years ago it was written down before
[1:15:04] heaven was ever
[1:15:09] created I got myself some kind of
[1:15:12] inheritance I got an inheritance that
[1:15:15] ain't no slewfoot and ain't no squatter
[1:15:17] ever going to take away from me because
[1:15:20] if he put my name there brother brandham
[1:15:22] said it like this that eroded with
[1:15:24] indelible R ink that means it's unable
[1:15:28] to be
[1:15:30] erased that's quite the inheritance he
[1:15:33] said how do we get this inheritance he
[1:15:35] said because we walk upright how do we
[1:15:38] get this inheritance it's because we're
[1:15:43] predestinated you you want hear what the
[1:15:44] prophet said
[1:15:50] [Applause]
[1:15:52] wo
[1:15:53] how'd you get where you are I didn't put
[1:15:56] myself here he predestinated me to
[1:16:00] this well glory be to God the land was
[1:16:03] The Inheritance the promised land is
[1:16:06] your Holy
[1:16:12] Ghost that's a burden off you ain't got
[1:16:15] to go out and try to figure out what it
[1:16:17] is the prophet said your inheritance is
[1:16:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:16:24] it is the Holy Ghost now notice notice
[1:16:27] that when God got out there in Numbers
[1:16:29] Chapter 13 that you watch that Moses I
[1:16:32] know I'm jumping just a bit but I'm
[1:16:34] trying to paint this picture to you that
[1:16:36] that Caleb and Joshua was a part of the
[1:16:38] 10 other spies and they're sent out
[1:16:40] there and they're sent out there to look
[1:16:42] at it they're going to be a a a vision
[1:16:46] of what's getting ready to come to pass
[1:16:48] and God sends out 12 Spies to go out
[1:16:52] there what does 12 represent it
[1:16:54] represents the Patriarchs it represents
[1:16:57] worship there's 12 tribes of Israel so
[1:17:00] God chose one of every tribe to go out
[1:17:04] there and look at their
[1:17:09] portion now what if your representative
[1:17:12] came back and said you can't have
[1:17:16] it what if somebody came
[1:17:19] back and it's been told to Abraham you
[1:17:22] can have div healing you can have
[1:17:24] Miracles you can have promises but then
[1:17:27] somebody comes back and says no wait a
[1:17:30] minute that's not for
[1:17:34] us well I'd say it for me in my house
[1:17:38] it's time to jump ship and get in this
[1:17:41] tribe I don't identify with somebody
[1:17:45] that says I can't have the Holy Ghost I
[1:17:47] can't have
[1:17:52] blessings
[1:17:54] but that's exactly what was happening 10
[1:17:56] of them came back and brought up an evil
[1:17:59] report I said man you ought to seen them
[1:18:01] things big old grasshoppers over
[1:18:04] there it's amazing what your imagination
[1:18:06] would do to you we look like his big old
[1:18:09] Giants over there no doubt there was
[1:18:11] Giants over there they was the sons of
[1:18:13] anic they was Giants over there but if
[1:18:16] you could only recognize that Jean seed
[1:18:19] of God I know your problems seem all so
[1:18:22] big
[1:18:23] but if you can recognize that it ain't
[1:18:25] you it's the promise that it ain't what

[1:20:16] right up there to the border line he
[1:20:18] said they got so close that they could
[1:20:20] taste the grapes but they wouldn't go in
[1:20:23] I don't identify
[1:20:25] there let me tell you where I identify
[1:20:27] with this is a good land I identify with
[1:20:31] Caleb and Joshua I put it in the words
[1:20:33] of the prophet he said Joshua stood up
[1:20:35] there say Shut

[1:20:40] Land well come on devil Shut Up This Is
[1:20:44] My Land This is my Holy Ghost that's my
[1:20:48] family that's my
[1:20:51] inheritance
[1:20:56] sister Francis your grandson called me
[1:21:00] your grandson called me this past week
[1:21:01] and started testifying to me about
[1:21:03] miracles this guy don't go to our church
[1:21:06] but he ain't here yet but I ain't
[1:21:08] counting it out but he called me he was
[1:21:10] so happy here's a man that should have
[1:21:13] been dead by Co sister Francis should
[1:21:16] have been dead late in the hospital how
[1:21:17] many
[1:21:21] days yeah that's a
[1:21:25] lot 10 and some days laid up in the
[1:21:28] hospital with Co she died how many times
[1:21:31] went cold blue so many
[1:21:33] times never going to work again but he
[1:21:36] had something on the inside Brian had
[1:21:38] something on the inside of him he wanted
[1:21:41] to work again he wasn't like the Le rest
[1:21:43] of the bums in America that just simply
[1:21:45] want to sit around and eat upon the
[1:21:49] governments he wanted a
[1:21:51] job he he work for it they told him
[1:21:54] you'll never get that job you don't have
[1:21:56] the has to still walk around has to use
[1:21:58] oxygen every once in a while but he
[1:22:01] pressed towards it he kept pressing
[1:22:03] towards it and he just pushing forward
[1:22:05] but he testified to me thank you for all
[1:22:08] your prayers and your church family for
[1:22:10] praying for
[1:22:12] me he got hired on last week at a
[1:22:15] full-time
[1:22:20] position should have never been able to
[1:22:22] work again should have never been able
[1:22:24] to testify how good God is I don't care
[1:22:27] if he ever sits in this building God was
[1:22:30] God to
[1:22:31] Brian so if God was that kind of a God
[1:22:34] to Brian what about your God is he still
[1:22:38] not Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:22:40] today and
[1:22:47] forever It's Your
[1:22:51] Land
[1:22:54] brother BR I'm said now there's three
[1:22:55] stages to this journey he said the first
[1:22:58] of it the first of it is justification
[1:23:01] they left Egypt he said the second part
[1:23:04] of it was sanctification in the Red Sea
[1:23:07] where they killed their
[1:23:09] past I know that there's a lot of times
[1:23:11] that people stay right
[1:23:14] there it's good to stay there at the Red
[1:23:16] Sea and watch them
[1:23:18] drown I enjoy looking back and seeing
[1:23:21] them but you can't stay there
[1:23:24] you can sit there and look at them all
[1:23:25] your days but just because you see them
[1:23:27] laying in the ground you got to go on
[1:23:29] and live because if you're constantly
[1:23:31] looking at that giant that whipped you
[1:23:34] and beat you you're no greater than him
[1:23:38] if you're still chained to that
[1:23:40] man if you're still chained to that man
[1:23:43] you're not living any higher than him
[1:23:45] but you got to go
[1:23:47] on that's why brother brandham would
[1:23:49] preach a token he said it's a climax of
[1:23:52] my my Ministry the token which is the
[1:23:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:23:57] there's three parts to this journey he
[1:23:59] said it's first leaving Egypt second
[1:24:01] killing your past he said but the third
[1:24:03] part of it is crossing over
[1:24:06] Jordan because it is a sign of death to
[1:24:09] yourself that you're getting ready to
[1:24:11] move into your
[1:24:14] inheritance now I'm going to read this
[1:24:16] to you cuz I don't want I don't want you
[1:24:18] to miss it my brother brandom said that
[1:24:20] at one the third stage is when they
[1:24:22] cross cross over Jordan he said their
[1:24:24] inheritance never laid there in Egypt
[1:24:28] though God blessed them down there their
[1:24:30] inheritance never laid there again in
[1:24:33] adoption series he said now remember God
[1:24:35] predestinated you by for knowledge that
[1:24:37] you are coming to this everybody
[1:24:39] understand it raise your hand see God by
[1:24:41] forn knowledge predestinated you to come
[1:24:45] to the promised
[1:24:48] land what is the promised land for the
[1:24:51] Christian today
[1:24:52] just raise up your hand if you know it
[1:24:55] the promise is unto you and to your
[1:24:56] children and to them that are far off
[1:24:59] and it shall come to pass that in the
[1:25:01] last days sayith the Lord I will pour
[1:25:03] out my spirit upon your flesh and on
[1:25:06] your sons and your daughters don't you
[1:25:08] recognize that you're predestinated to
[1:25:11] walk into that
[1:25:14] land you may not understand this but
[1:25:17] you're predestinated to get filled with
[1:25:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you may
[1:25:21] not want anything to do with this
[1:25:22] message but you're predestinated to go
[1:25:25] in there and Conquer this land he said
[1:25:28] the promise and question and answers he
[1:25:30] said the promise is the baptism of the
[1:25:33] spirit which is Promised of all
[1:25:35] throughout the Old Testament and New too
[1:25:37] he said the promise is behold I send the
[1:25:39] promise of my father upon you Peter said
[1:25:41] on that day he said on the day of
[1:25:44] Pentecost that is the promise the
[1:25:46] promised land is to live in this land of
[1:25:49] the Holy Spirit that's God's promise for
[1:25:52] for the church is to live in the power
[1:25:55] of the spirit he said it's another world
[1:25:59] it's another land you have to come out
[1:26:01] of that condition that you've been in to
[1:26:04] come out and live in this promised land
[1:26:07] to receive the promise that's the
[1:26:10] promised land for the believer is to
[1:26:12] come out there and live under the power
[1:26:15] of the
[1:26:19] spirit now look all of you ain't going
[1:26:22] to let L your hands on a sick and watch
[1:26:23] them recover but it's for
[1:26:27] you is that right it's for you let me
[1:26:30] say this to you there are different part
[1:26:32] counterparts of this land let me say
[1:26:35] this to you you may not go over here and
[1:26:37] live in Dan's inheritance you may not go
[1:26:40] over here and live in ephraim's
[1:26:42] inheritance but it's still the children
[1:26:44] of
[1:26:45] Israel's and the Bible said that they
[1:26:47] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:26:49] shall recover they shall take up B
[1:26:51] deadly things and it shall not harm them
[1:26:54] we ain't walking around like a bunch of
[1:26:56] snake handlers and going around and
[1:26:57] trying to tempt God by that but I do
[1:27:00] believe that there is a portion of the
[1:27:02] body that just like Paul when he was
[1:27:05] over there preaching a message and a
[1:27:07] snake come out of the fire Paul just
[1:27:09] shook it off I ain't going out there
[1:27:11] looking for the snake but if he comes by
[1:27:14] my way I can simply throw him under my
[1:27:17] feet and keep on preaching the
[1:27:21] message now ain't all of you going out
[1:27:23] there and trying to drink arsenic po
[1:27:25] arsenic
[1:27:27] poison but I believe that if you
[1:27:29] accidentally got into
[1:27:32] it that our God would show up I forget
[1:27:36] that brother's name but just coming to
[1:27:37] me forgive me I don't have the quote in
[1:27:38] front of me but this brother one time
[1:27:40] there was a guy that was up there
[1:27:41] challenging Mark 16 he was standing up
[1:27:43] there and old hillbilly come up there he
[1:27:47] was challenging Mark 16 hillbilly come
[1:27:48] up here grabbed the Apple out of
[1:27:51] his bibed overalls and started biting on
[1:27:54] that thing and he looked up at him and
[1:27:55] said can you tell me if that Apple's
[1:27:59] sweet or bitter he said well how am I
[1:28:00] supposed to know I ain't taste it yet he
[1:28:02] said
[1:28:04] exactly how can you know if there's no
[1:28:07] power if you've never tasted of
[1:28:11] it that same man stood there and said
[1:28:15] now if there is any real Christians out
[1:28:17] there that believe in Mark chapter 16
[1:28:19] that you can take up deadly things if
[1:28:21] you drinking didly thing and shall not
[1:28:23] harm you he said now let me tell you
[1:28:24] something he said I he said I don't
[1:28:27] believe I got to do this he said but I'm
[1:28:29] not going to stand there and let you
[1:28:30] challenge the very word of God he took
[1:28:33] that arsic poison and said in the name
[1:28:35] of Jesus Christ drunk it and kept on
[1:28:39] living let me tell you
[1:28:41] something Billy Graham stood up in front
[1:28:44] of the raw heathens and stood there and
[1:28:47] they challenged to see Jesus Christ the
[1:28:49] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:28:51] Billy Graham couldn't answer them
[1:28:53] William brandom said he said I tell you
[1:28:55] what I would have done he said I
[1:28:57] wouldn't let some raw Heathen try to
[1:28:59] challenge me and let God go down into
[1:29:01] defeat he said whether God would have
[1:29:03] showed up or not I'd have stood for
[1:29:07] Jesus I can lay my hands on you and I
[1:29:10] can believe you with all my heart but
[1:29:12] whether you get healed or not I'm still
[1:29:14] going to stand up for
[1:29:19] it let all the naysayers come and try to
[1:29:23] tell us that this message This Land Is
[1:29:26] Not Right But I already seen the
[1:29:28] Borderlands of it I've already had
[1:29:31] somebody go over Hallelujah I've already

[1:30:50] the cluster was hanging all the way to
[1:30:52] the ground I'll tell you what was in

[1:31:24] time that some young people start
[1:31:27] walking back the
[1:31:29] evidence I'm a part of the land I may
[1:31:33] not be there yet but I'm on my

[1:32:33] we really shouldn't go inherit this
[1:32:37] land if it's really not that good then

[1:32:48] right if it
[1:32:50] really
[1:32:54] if it really if his holy ghost ain't

[1:32:58] telling us that it ain't real if it

[1:34:23] we're in this land of testimony just for
[1:34:25] a
[1:34:25] minute maybe you didn't go out and smoke
[1:34:28] and drink get caught up in all the world
[1:34:30] thank you
[1:34:34] Jesus thank you
[1:34:36] Jesus we need testimonies like
[1:34:40] that I didn't go out there and dope I
[1:34:42] didn't go out there and smoke I didn't
[1:34:44] go out there and get involved in sin but
[1:34:46] I was still born in sin I was still
[1:34:49] shaped in iniquity but I I recognized
[1:34:52] that I needed a Joshua
[1:34:59] savior I heard a preacher tell it one
[1:35:01] time I about beat the socks off of them
[1:35:04] too he said you know what there's a
[1:35:07] season in young people's life message
[1:35:09] preacher said our young people got to go
[1:35:12] out there and so their Wild Oats I said
[1:35:13] that's a bunch of
[1:35:17] baloney that's a lie Straight From Hell
[1:35:20] you ain't got to go out there
[1:35:21] and so that you can have a greater
[1:35:23] testimony you can sit right here in this
[1:35:25] message Church all the days of your life
[1:35:29] and have one of the most powerful
[1:35:32] testimonies I caught the revelation of
[1:35:35] who Jesus
[1:35:36] [Applause]
[1:35:41] was I know it's simple but it's still my
[1:35:44] land let me tell you it may not be as
[1:35:46] Bountiful as your land it may not
[1:35:48] produce crops and grain like Bethlehem C
[1:35:51] but let me tell you it's my
[1:35:58] land I love this I found this B
[1:36:05] said that Jesus knew that Satan was
[1:36:08] going to try to keep you from
[1:36:12] this he said so he slayed the lamb
[1:36:14] before the foundation of the world and
[1:36:17] put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:36:20] he said he seen the deceitfulness of
[1:36:23] Satan and what he would do so he put
[1:36:25] your name on
[1:36:27] there he knew what Satan would try to do
[1:36:31] let me tell you there was nothing that
[1:36:33] Satan didn't try to accumulate or try to
[1:36:36] build up that God doesn't already know
[1:36:39] so he saw the deceitfulness of
[1:36:41] Satan said nah I'm going to write their
[1:36:44] name on the
[1:36:47] book let me say this to you whether you
[1:36:50] see your name or not not I believe I
[1:36:54] believe you're going to come to the spot
[1:36:55] where you recognize that this is who you
[1:36:59] are I really believe with all of my
[1:37:01] heart that we are living in an hour
[1:37:03] where you can know that your name is on
[1:37:06] the Lamb's Book of Life this is no
[1:37:08] longer guessing do I have the Holy Ghost
[1:37:11] or do I not have the Holy Ghost you know
[1:37:13] that you got the Holy
[1:37:16] Ghost let me say this to you how do you
[1:37:19] know that it's for you because you keep
[1:37:22] showing back up you keep pressing the
[1:37:24] battle you keep listening to the message
[1:37:27] when Satan tried his
[1:37:31] best he didn't just write your name down
[1:37:35] with pen that could be erased he wrote
[1:37:38] it down with the blood of the Lamb let
[1:37:41] me say this that over your name sister
[1:37:44] Cindy over your name
[1:37:47] brother it's the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:37:51] amen when David was on his way when the
[1:37:55] ark was making his way
[1:37:58] back David put on his Priestly
[1:38:03] ephod the ephod he put on the 12 tribes
[1:38:06] of colors he put on the the Y and thumb
[1:38:09] but he put on the he put on the priest
[1:38:13] of
[1:38:19] ephod and it had all
[1:38:21] 12 tribes names on
[1:38:24] it I had a dream this
[1:38:27] is I wasn't going to tell it but we're
[1:38:31] here I had a
[1:38:35] dream and the Lord the Lord showed me
[1:38:39] show showed me two parts of it and I
[1:38:40] knew that I knew immediately that it was
[1:38:43] of the
[1:38:44] Lord but there was a brother that had
[1:38:47] given me a
[1:38:49] gift he gave me a gift
[1:38:52] and I Heard a Voice said
[1:38:54] this this is representative of the 12
[1:38:58] Champions and then the dream is shifted
[1:39:03] over and I was standing out on this
[1:39:05] great
[1:39:06] ledge out on this great ledge and out in
[1:39:08] front of me was this shelf of all kinds
[1:39:10] of goods and I Heard a Voice say it's
[1:39:13] time to divide the
[1:39:16] inheritance when David is out there
[1:39:19] dancing before the Lord
[1:39:22] he's got 12 Champions on his
[1:39:24] shoulders and there's coming times in
[1:39:26] your spots of your life that you don't
[1:39:28] recognize that you're a
[1:39:31] champion but whether you feel it or not
[1:39:35] a king has walked into the shika Glory
[1:39:39] wearing your name he's wearing your name
[1:39:43] he's wearing Benjamin he's wearing he's
[1:39:46] wearing Reuben he's wearing Ephraim and
[1:39:49] as David is dancing before the Lord he's
[1:39:52] carrying your
[1:39:55] name the voice said be careful but it's
[1:39:59] time to divide the inheritance let me
[1:40:01] tell you there's going to come some
[1:40:02] spots where you look out there on your
[1:40:04] land and you say well I don't know if I
[1:40:06] can go in there and possess it or not
[1:40:08] but let me tell you everything that you
[1:40:10] have need of is laying there in Exodus
[1:40:13] 23 and 20 behold I send my angel before
[1:40:17] thee to keep thee in the way you're
[1:40:19] going to come up against cancers but
[1:40:21] you're still going to press through
[1:40:22] you're going to come up against trials
[1:40:24] you're going to come up against tumors
[1:40:26] you're going to come up against
[1:40:31] criticism Hallelujah you don't have to
[1:40:33] work this up Moses didn't have to do
[1:40:39] anything just preach the message
[1:40:43] Moses just preach a m just preach a
[1:40:47] message Lord spoke some to a brother a
[1:40:50] while back so when you get in when you
[1:40:52] get in a tough spot simply preach a
[1:40:55] message Moses you don't have to work
[1:40:57] this up you ain't try to God you ain't
[1:40:59] got to create anything you ain't got to
[1:41:01] go out there and make it all happen just
[1:41:03] preach a message Moses little bride just
[1:41:07] say what the tape
[1:41:10] say come on somebody I know it might be
[1:41:13] cliche but let me say it like this just
[1:41:14] say what the tape say don't try to add
[1:41:18] your own ideas don't try to put
[1:41:20] Pentecostal is M or Lutheranism in this
[1:41:23] message don't you try to hinder the most
[1:41:26] holy thing I've ever put my hands
[1:41:28] on just preach a
[1:41:31] message come on
[1:41:34] somebody I ain't disregarding Luther and
[1:41:37] I ain't disregarding Wesley but this
[1:41:40] message is the most holy thing that I
[1:41:43] can give to our young
[1:41:46] people that's why I want to preach it to
[1:41:49] them with everything that's with within
[1:41:51] me because it will give them power to
[1:41:54] [Applause]
[1:41:57] overcome don't take my message from
[1:42:00] [Applause]
[1:42:06] me let me say you're going to get into
[1:42:08] some spots in this land but it's still
[1:42:12] for you and when it looks like that
[1:42:15] you're not going to go over there and
[1:42:16] possess what those jebusites are on let
[1:42:18] me say this to you as we I I got more
[1:42:21] material here on this than you can ever
[1:42:25] imagine but when you get up against that
[1:42:27] mountain and it looks bigger than
[1:42:32] you just whisper at it your
[1:42:37] mine your
[1:42:39] mind that's what you did Brother
[1:42:42] Randall you got some big mountains in
[1:42:44] your way just looked over that and your
[1:42:49] mine every one of you say sitting
[1:42:52] here every one of you sitting here is a
[1:42:54] miracle by God's grace and whether you

[1:42:59] this to you your life proves who you
[1:43:02] are I really don't care if you post it
[1:43:05] on the Internet or not but I believe
[1:43:06] it'll help somebody I'm not pushing you
[1:43:08] to do that but I want you to live this
[1:43:10] message because if you live this message

[1:43:20] I'm giving you
[1:43:26] let me say this I don't know how to heal
[1:43:28] brother on all I know how to do is
[1:43:31] preach a message and God will back up
[1:43:33] his
[1:43:41] word I don't know how it's all going to
[1:43:43] come to pass but if I can preach the
[1:43:45] message and you can accept it it's
[1:43:48] liberty it'll do its job
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:58] if we live another 30 or 40 years let me
[1:44:00] tell you all of us the whole dynamics of
[1:44:03] this church is going to
