across this pulpit this evening father each one is such a serious situation lord each one is so important father lord there are some that are even between life and death father lord and father we send you lord in the name of jesus christ father to those needs lord father god lord your prophet preach your sermon lord that you care but the question was do we care father lord do we care enough lord jesus lord god to believe your word father lord when it looks so dark when it looks like there's no way do we care enough to believe your word father god you said if a man loved me he'll keep my word father we've assembled ourselves here this evening father because we love you and because your word teaches us to not forsake the assembling of ourselves and even so much the more as we see the day approaching father god as we come before you prayer lord with his needs upon our hearts father lord in each hand that was raised father lord and not the presence of man or flesh and blood but in the presence of you lord the great healer father the great doctor the great physician father we just send the holy spirit to each and every need father lord jesus we remember father the time whenever a sister lord was prayed for of a tumor or something in the prophet's prayer line and lord she went home lord with and it looked in the natural like it was still hanging on but father one day the angel of the lord passed through that neighborhood and she woke up and she was shaking the sheets looking for it the mighty power of god came by that day and touched her lord and fulfilled your word father lord she held on to that promise lord until that word was fulfilled and lord we have a promise to hold on to lord and we just pray oh god that may that same angel of the lord sweep over each and every request lord each and every raised hand man sweep across this building this evening make it a special service father for your honor in your glory father we humbly ask oh god that you forgive us of our sins lord help us lord jesus to draw closer to you father lord as we see the evil in this end time lord we only have one place to look not to politics not to one another but to look up for our redemption draweth night father we ask you bless your servant this evening lord i pray that you make him father lord a vessel of your voice father lord that has spoken so many times and may your voice father just speak to him one more time father lord that we'll give you the praise honor and glory we ask you blessings over the main of the service bless each and every one father there's a single soul father here that hasn't met you in the power of your resurrection may this be the night in jesus christ's name we pray and ask all these things amen amen god bless you amen you can be seated at this time before we go any further i'd like to just give some words words of wisdom from brother matt are you like that sometimes they'll send certain people into battle for certain things and i guess i'm that bulldog type of thing get the point across we've been having wonderful services haven't we and they keep getting better and better and better and we want to continue that don't we amen now they were good when it was down to 10 but with all of you here it's just so great but we want to keep it that way with all of you here amen so to do so covet 19 guidelines are have been set in place so we have to abide by them for restriction orders amen but some of that can help by you if you have fever or chills cough shortness of breath or difficulty breathing these are the cdc guidelines for the covet 19 okay fatigue muscle body aches headache new loss of taste or smell sore throat congestion or runny nose nausea or vomiting or diarrhea but if it gets worse it will be trouble breathing persistent pain pressure in the chest new confusion inability to wake or stay awake andrew says i have that already and i don't have cove at 19 though but amen inability to stay awake amen blush lips or face so if you have had or having those symptoms it's not a good idea to call up someone and say is it still okay to come to church or come to work ask yourself wwms what would matt say just real quick [Applause] that's a no no i i i'm not a person of many words so no when cassie texts she'll send me a letter i'll send her back that k so no so if you have to pick up the phone and think that is it still okay for me to come to church or even maybe i'm i'm helping your co-workers out if can i come to work they are probably gonna say no and they're going to stand at the door with their gloves their mask their eye shields and a temperature gate going net so please be aware of that and those symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after being around somebody so if you have been around somebody or somebody has constructed covet 19 and you're still not showing in them symptoms it's probably still not a good idea to come to to church if you're living with those individuals have taken a trip with them and has been in a vehicle with them more than 15 minutes wwms praise god let's stand victory is mine victory is mine aren't you glad of that today old victory is mine oh victory is victory today it is it this is is [Music] it is [Music] is [Music] because the joy of the lord it is mine i rose up this morning oh i rolled up this morning well i didn't have a doubt that the lord could bring me out oh so i got down on my knees and i said lord help me please [Music] victory today it is amen victory is ours tonight you can be seated may we have sister angela lilly come sing for us tonight if she would and then of brother stephen short if you prepare to have one for us if you would and then we'll have sister cassie it's been requested for her to sing come thou fount of every blessing amen i normally don't add much lib to this song but i would just like to say tonight that there was a gentleman in arkansas who had written part of the verse and part of the chorus and he talked to me and we collaborated on the phone and the lord gave me a second verse to this song and i was reading a comment that sister connie spencer had put on the sister that brother ron had asked for people not to have pity for him just to thank god and as i was walking through remission monday will make five weeks i know god moves and so i pray this song was a blessing to you tonight and i dedicate this to sister connie and brother ron god is good god is good in spite of everything i've been through god is good yes he is though the road may not be easy and the hills are hard to climb god is good and he's good all the time while i've had trials tribulations i've been tested on every side i've had heartache from the faces that i trusted with my life but through it all god gets the glory cause he never left my side and god is good and he's good all the time yes god is gone oh god is good oh in spite of everything i've been through god is good yes he is though the road may not be easy and the heels are hard to climb god is good and he's good all the time oh just like damon there's a giant and it's standing in your way well the circumstance so tall but don't you be afraid on gun call and

get out um but uh i like the this one song that lafontaines wrote i'm gonna try and sing it uh i haven't sang it for a while but i like the verse that he um brought it out of and so instead of trying to do it in the middle of the song i'll just say it now revelation 18 2 says babylon the greatest fallen has fallen and become the habitation of devils and the hold of every unclean and hateful bird or every foul spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird but verse 4 says i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and yet receive not of her plagues babylon teaching me her pleasure-driven ways have some fun forget about tomorrow live today her music and her fashion her hollywood and passion can stimulate the flesh just like wine and all the while she pulls us all away from everything divine but i have heard a voice calling me out of babylon to a higher place there's a mountain i can live upon i have made my choice jesus is my joy in liberty [Music] babylon will never never have babylon the mystery reaches further to the soul put religion on but never let the spirit have control she stands against revival the truth within the bible binding hungry hearts with chains of fear and somehow makes confusion of the world god has made so clear but i have heard a voice calling me out of babylon to a higher place there's a mountain i can live upon and i have made my choice jesus is my joy and liberty babylon will never never have its hold on me i have heard a voice calling me out of babylon to a higher place there's a mountain i can live upon and i have made my choice jesus is my joy and liberty babylon will never never have its hold on me babylon will never never have its hold [Music] on thank you y'all pray for me i have never sung this song so if you know it i think i know one verse so i'll sing the verse i know and you all can sing with me and i'll play the rest [Music] come thou found of every blessing to my heart to sing your praise streams of mercy never ceasing call for songs of loudest praise teach me meliodious sun head taught by flaming tongues above streams my heart lord take and seal it seal it for thy courts above come thou found of every blessing to my heart to sing your praise streams of mercy never ceasing call for songs of loudest [Music] here's my heart lord take and seal it seal it for thy quartz above [Music] [Applause] amen what a wonderful job all the singers this evening the manchester rocks sister pat had requested that this evening for sister roxy so we thank sister cassie for doing that and i actually thought that that was a song she sung so i apologize for that amen good job though better than i would have done it's not my key amen let's stand at this time as we prepare to turn it over brother andrew this evening let's sing that song why should i worry why should i fear when the very same jesus he is always so near amen we have nothing to fear to be afraid of amen [Music] storms raging high that's not my key amen [Music] they failed to remember that the master was nigh and he spoke the words and the wings all stood still and even the waters they obeyed his will and he calmed their [Music] [Applause] [Music] if i just remember that he lives deep inside why should i worry why should i be when the very same jesus he is always and he hears when i'll call on his name to heal the storm pass his mind [Applause] when he walked with me to the darkness with the way you so dear how great it would happen [Music] and [Music] i know he'll be there on time all i have to do [Music] is oh why should i feel when the very same jesus he is always so neat [Music] name until the storm passed his mouth to sing it again [Music] why should i worry

holy spirit [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign and holy spirit [Music] let your voice be heard come and change our hearts as we stand on your word holy spirit [Applause] father that's our desire tonight is that your holy spirit would begin to reign upon your children father lord very early this morning i i awoken lord with such a deep desire lord for the children of god to experience that raining down of the holy ghost an upper room experience on your children father with tongues of fire would fall when the spirit would fall upon men and speaking to a heavenly language father and to be able to edify the god of heaven and edify your children lord to declare that you're a living god lord this day i i feel humanly lord as if i'm sitting on a rocket lord just knowing the things that you're doing and the things that you will do lord we've seen so many things father we've seen so many miracles father things that we've related to the children of god father my heart is heavy for those that still need that touch oh god that that still desire and still need the healing in their body still need a miracle-working god and lord what we desire father is that you would come and take your children by the hand and guide them right to the promise that has their name on it tonight lord for brother seth hinckley brother donny nicholson father lord children that would love to be in the house of the lord but the enemy is afflicted i just come against the enemy today in the name of jesus and asked father that you would deliver them lord i pray that you would speak to us live to here tonight now father lord i've studied this thought for the last three weeks father and looking over these things but father even today lord i just i i know that the enemy is nervous father lord i was told that a great man was asked one time do you ever get nervous he said oh i get nervous but that's a sign that the enemy's nervous father i pray tonight that the holy spirit would begin to move over nervousness right now and begin to push past the things that we feel with our senses father and allow us to reach him with that sick sense of faith father and pull down the promises father from the arcade lord i pray that that if maybe it's too high for one of your children father that you'd allow me grace to be able to get on the ladder and be able to pull it down for your children lord god i i know that you're here i sense the moving of the spirit of the lord jesus and i'm asking lord that you'd be high and lifted up in our midst lord you know these words you know these thoughts i pray that you would express them in the way that you've brought them to me in jesus christ's name amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll we'll turn over to the book of hebrews chapter 13 and verse 5. i feel with every fiber of my being that god's got something to say this weekend i feel that way every weekend but i feel like we will hear his voice god's got something to say i'd like to speak to you along the same thoughts that we've been dealing with on o king i'll see you in the morning but i'd like to take as a thought tonight on courage in the cave courage in the cave hebrews chapter 13 and verse 5. this is my favorite scripture let your conversation be without covetness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said that i will never leave thee nor forsake thee now i can be quite content with that and be content with such things as you have for he has said that i will never leave thee nor forsake thee verse six so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me may god bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the lord courage courage in the cave look with me at deuteronomy chapter 31 and verse 6. now this is when when israel is getting ready to cross over into the promised land cross over jordan and moses is called to stay back but notice what notice what the instructions here in deuteronomy 31 and 6 it says to be strong and of a good courage and to fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doeth goeth with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of all of israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people under the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it verse 8 and the lord he it is that doeth goeth before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not i love that fear not neither be dismayed and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests and the sons of levi which bear the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto the elders of israel now now notice the the context of the scripture we've just read i've noticed the placing of it that just before the going over that just before you're getting ready to go over into the promised land and we understand that that we are under a joshua commission that we're standing here and all of the inheritance of god the mind of god the the very the very the very seals of god that have not been sealed from god or from our lord jesus but have been sealed to add to us as humanity have been sealed for over thousands of years but those things have been released in this hour and in a time and we realize that we're standing here and we're looking at we're looking at a crossing over in time but here what moses instruction was to to joshua and to all the levites and all the priests and here we are standing under a melchizedek priesthood and we're standing here in this hour and the word to us is to take courage that i am the lord that i will be with thee and i will not fail thee that i will not forsake thee you know i i could go anywhere in life knowing that god is with me i believe that i can take faith in knowing that i'm not standing here alone or when i go to down the road or when i get in my car but i can take courage in knowing that god has said that he be with me now there are times in life that may may come and there might be causing an interruption in life or maybe a maybe a a conversation and maybe it leads you to a path in which you don't feel necessarily don't necessarily feel the holiest of holies and you don't necessarily feel like you're you're on top of the mountain but maybe you're down in the valley but you can have that same reassurance down on the inside of your soul that there is a god that that has said that he'll not leave you and he will not forsake you you know there's going to come seasons in your life that there will be times of victory and there will be times of despair and there'll be times of battle but i want you to take courage in the midst of the chaos of life to take courage that there is a mighty angel that is very present over your situation and over your circumstances but notice notice what webster tells us what courage is he tells us that the courage is bravery it is intrepidity that that quality of mind which enables men to encounter danger and difficulties with firmness or without fear or depression of spirits it is a valor it is a boldness it is a resolution it is courage is it is a mindset courage is the quality in the mind in which you know it enables you to encounter the danger of life and you look at the hour that we're living in and we hear the prophet teaching us that we're living in the most dangerous time of life he would tell us that he would teach us that that at the midnight hour at the twilight is when it's the most dangerous of times when you're traveling when it's at that hour of chaos an hour hour of darkness that's when it's the dangerous and here we are living in an hour where we see false christ amongst us when we see the anointed ones at the end time and and jesus would tell us over in matthew chapter 24 and 24 that that that they're in the last days that false christ will arise amongst you that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible and we we see that where we're living out we're living in such an hour where it's not been like this through two thousand years through the church ages through six thousand churches or six church ages there has not been jesus kicked out but on this side in this church age we see jesus kicked out and on the outside of his church and if there's ever a time that the people of god need to have courage in their life it's in the moments of these things and i want to say to you that that that there's never been anybody that's walked out of this cave before there's not been anybody that's walked into this despair before that's never walked into this lines then before it ever came out of it but there will be a people that will come out of this cave that will have courage in the midst of all of the sicknesses and all of the turmoil and all the darkness and the lukewarmness there will be a people that have the courage that when there's remains to be nobody that has courage she will have a courage and i will tell you what causes that courage is a trust that he can use you like never before you see that's what trust does trust will cause the courage inside of you trust will cause you to believe in him you see if you trust me you'll walk with me wherever i go and if you trust god you got courage to go with him wherever he says go there's going to be times when it seems like this he's taking you out on a limb but he's leading you right to the perfect promise in which he has ordained you to walk and it's going to take a courage to walk through this spot philippians 4 4 says rejoice in the lord always and again i say rejoice hallelujah rejoice rejoicing good times rejoice in bad times rejoice when you're happy rejoice when you're low rejoice when you're sick rejoice when you're broke rejoice when you got money let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and mind through christ jesus now notice what the age of the lord has spoken to us in this hour it's about thinking past what we see it's about thinking past and looking past and believing past what we see but it's the peace of god that will keep your hearts it is not what you see at the pulpit it is not what you see in your financial status it is not but it is the peace of god that will keep your mind in your heart hallelujah finally my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good rapport if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things you can't think about the things that are going on in the world i read over fox news and some of the news outlets sometimes and i i do it justin i don't read but half of the half of the headlines because it makes me sick in my stomach but i have hardly found one thing good or positive in the news for the last six months but i have found good and positive things in these things i have found pure things just things holy things and i have set my course to think on these things you see if you can get your mind right you can do anything when your mind is set right if you can change your mind to go to thinking about what god has said instead and what you're seeing if you can change your mind you can change the way you walk if you can change your thinking you can change the way you talk you say well i just didn't think about that you had to think about it before you said it so before you say something go to thinking about what you're saying go to thinking about what you're posting go to thinking about what you're expressing or what you're liking or what you're pinning or all of those things speak on these things you see if you can get your mind right there's a whole lot of things you can do you can be like paul and you say i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor things present no things to come no height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate me from the love of god you see if you're persuaded in your mind and in your heart you can do a whole lot of things and you can be like paul and you can say i can do all things through christ which strengthens me are you with me if you've got your mindset on what he said and i'm talking to you more than a hope but a revelation from god when your eyes is fixed on the word of god you can look all the way through the heroes of faith in daniel or hebrews chapter 11 and you could read down there and it would say that what can i more say for time would fail me to tell you about rahab and tell you about barlock talia tell you about samson tell you about the prophets and tell you how they shut the mouth of lines oh but let us run this race what is it it's not looking to what's behind you but it's looking to the author and the finisher of your faith if your eyes is not on the things of god you will not project the things of god you see a person that is sick if they can ever set their mind to what god has said you'll watch as that sickness is shortened are you with me if you can go to setting your mind to receiving the baptism of the holy ghost setting your mind to what the word is said you can watch as the spirit of god will draw near to you are you with me how many has how many remembers that time when you were seeking the baptism of the holy ghost and you went to go sit in your mind well we got five people that wouldn't seek the holy ghost we got about 900 900 people out there on the internet that needs to seek the holy ghost but we got five here that sought it so let's get the rest of the congregation seeking the baptism of the holy ghost and we'll get our eyes on what things what things ought to be on all right but faith you see you see a lot of times people got hope instead of faith but faith is a revelation from god and what faith will do it'll create something on the inside of you that'll make you look past what you see brother branham would use hope like an acorn he would say potentially you got an oak tree he said if you ask me for an oak tree and i give you an acorn he said potentially you've got an oak tree he said but a lot of times people come with an imagination in their mind well i've seen this person do that so i can do that and they're just hoping for it but faith is the substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things that you do not see it's amazing what faith will do faith the father of faith abraham was able to look into a realm for 25 years and he could see that there was time after 30 30 days in a month time after time after time again and there would be failure of conception but what faith did was brought whoo what brought a production to a conception and brought forth life oh hallelujah but he looked past what he was seeing in the natural oh hallelujah you see jesus had to look past what he was seeing in the world around him but jesus had to believe what the word said about jesus oh come on somebody there were people that were around jesus that did not want to believe what it said about jesus but jesus had to step into the body of the word you see hope will not produce it will not produce what faith produces but what you have is potentially faith you're right there on the cusp of a breakthrough but if you keep watering that hope if you keep watering that seed of hope and you keep saying what the word says you watch faith get in line and all of a sudden hope becomes faith and you've got an oak tree on your hands because you chose to water that seed a seed laying on the inside of you that is waiting to be released there'll be nuggets of faith that'll be dropped right here this evening that'll give you courage and he did not he did not ask you to do what you did not have the capacity to do are you with me he will not put anything on you that he knew that you wouldn't be able to bear it he must think a lot about the bride of jesus christ to send her through wars through calamities through distresses and all of those things but he has not put more on you he's not asked you to go through laodicea unless you had the capacity to go through laodicea you see he deposited something on the inside of your soul before the foundation of the world and he knew that you had what it took to overcome he knew what he deposited was more than a hope so but it was a belief from the foundation of the world oh sure there's a lot of seeds that get thrown out on the ground but sure they get thrown on stony ground sure maybe the sun comes up and it dries them out but there is a seed that has been deposited in good ground and fertile ground and that seed will produce none other than what the word called for it to do are you with me if you're a daniel you're going to produce a daniel if you're a david you're going to produce a david if you are an isaac you will produce an isaac and if you are the bride of jesus christ you will produce the bride of jesus christ when cool when dogs give birth they give birth to dogs catch the cats humans are humans and when god gives birth he gives birth to sons and daughters of god [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah this message didn't come just to prove that william branham was malachi 4. it did not just come so that we could see miracles and that we could see signs and wonders this message didn't come to lift up a man but this message came to place sons and daughters of god and has told us that we have representation by predestination that we are a people that is built to stand against all the wiles of the devil that we are built to overcome the pressures of laodicea oh i tell you what a confidence that god has got in his children she knows what he wants done with the word are you with me she's able to look past she's able to look past what she sees she's able to look up here in that arcade and said there's joy in the time of mourning and she brings it down she's able to look up there in the arcade and look up there and says that i am the lord that heals all of thy diseases she looks past what she sees and reaches into that realm and pulls down what he knew of her from the beginning oh hallelujah it's faith that cometh by hearing it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight that's in the dog that's what it takes it's somebody who's got courage and faith god does faith in god to stand there and say thus saith the lord you see faith moves in and everything else takes it place when faith moves in you see but faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god if you need salvation listen to the word of god if you need healing listen to the word of god if you need satisfaction in your soul listen to the word of god if you need a baptism of the holy ghost listen to the word of god if you need your prayers answered listen to the word of god if you need a blessing for your soul a blessing for your children a blessing for your family a blessing on your job listen to the word of god you see faith is a ladder that we climb on from hearing ground to receiving ground and faith believes that god will work it out faith is a latch that unlocks heaven's door by faith the walls of jericho fail hallelujah faith does not say that there's no walls there faith acknowledges that there's a problem but faith says there is a god that is bigger than the walls [Applause] if you're afraid to shout your walls will never come down oh hallelujah you can look at your circumstance but it's going to take a circumstance of faith on the inside of your soul to look past what you see it's judging that land faith didn't say there wasn't no giants there faith said that we're more than able to take it sure there's a denomination that says that we can't have healing no more but faith says it's there for us sure is there ideology out there so you can't have the baptism of the holy ghost and the apostolic days are over but there is a faith that says it's for me and my house i believe brother branham says it and how can i overcome i'll paraphrase it just but he said he said something along these lines he said if you're diagnosed with cancer he said you can't say it's not cancer he said that's not overcoming he said but overcoming is to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks sure he may pin you in a corner sure he may try to steal your job away from you or steal your wife away from you but overcoming is recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks is that right but faith will push past that trick whoo faith has said not today faith has said you ain't got enough satan faith will tell you satan you're not strong enough you're not good enough you're not powerful enough how about some young people say hey i'm tired of living this way i'm ready to go higher faith will take you high how about some ladies and gentlemen of god that said i'm tired of living in this sinful condition i want to allow your faith to push you out of this realm of what you see it takes real courage to walk into a cave but you got to know that god will do his part now i got i got 90 with me on that one maybe we'll get you seeking the baptism the holy ghost all right but you got to realize that god will do his part just like when jesus said it's to the believer that they can lay hands on the sick and it's for god to make them well the book of james would tell us that the believers may anoint the sick with oil and pray the prayer on their behalf and james tells us that it's the lord that will raise up the sick you see god will say to you you do your part and i'll do my part come on somebody you go to seek him and he'll go to feeling you go to ask him and you go to point out on you [Applause] you see do what god tells you to do and you can expect god to do what he said to do that is faith you see we have the mind of christ that we're never going to give up when christ came there was more doubt in the in the land then than it is now but he did not give up because he was sent for a purpose and jesus had courage in what the word said about him and he said he said that he would never give up but he would go all the way and if we could ever have that mentality that we we've heard the voice of god that he's told us who we are that we've heard his name we've heard him declare his name over us that he's told us to be strong he's told us big to be courageous he's told us that he's faithful you see everything depends on god and god depends on nothing you see if god says he's with you he's with you if god says he's got this he's got this if god says that i am the lord thy god that fights all of your battles he's the lord thy god that fights all of your battles so if god is with you he's with you so you can remain collected in the fight you can have composure and calamity you can have confidence in the conflict and you can have inspiration in the midst of warfare because the bible tells me in hebrews 4 and 12 that the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-widget sword who piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and it is a gerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart he's still discerning the faults and the intents of the children's heart he has the ability to reach in to your mindset and know what you're thinking he knows that when you're sitting there under the preaching of the word and he sees all that you're going through and all that you're facing but i want to encourage you do not stay under your husband's shadow no longer i want to encourage you not to stay under the taskmaster of sin no longer hallelujah he has the ability to reach into that realm and tell you that you've been doing filthy things and that's why you can't overcome and have an overcoming life he has the ability to reach into that realm and call your name tell you who you are tell you that you've seen a heavy tech doctor this week had had rim that grim glasses on and he diagnosed you with this and he tells you all those things he's still a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart you see it's a fact that god is still here it's a fact that god is not going to leave you it's a fact that he is committed to his promise it's a fact just like he told paul i'm with you and then he proved he was with paul it's a fact that he says he's with this bride and he's proven he's with this bride the bible says in isaiah 43 but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed the o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine when you pass through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walk us through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon me you can tell me about your cave but as long as you know he's with you it don't matter what the cave looks like you see you can say like paul said that i can do all things through christ which strengthens me in difficulty i can do all things through christ in weakness i can do all things through christ in strength i can do all things in christ through pain through struggles through all things it'd be amazing if you actually lived in that kind of mentality i can do all things are you with me you heard me say this before if you actually went to your boss you went to your boss and he asked you what can you do and you said i can do all things you'd blow his mind really if you went and told you young men that are trying to court some ladies in here and she asked you what you do for her for a profession and she asked you what you do and you told her i can do all things she's got a tendency probably not to believe you but if you would go ahead and express to her that i can do all things through christ which strengthens me i can go through cancer knowing that i can do all things through christ which strengthens me i can go through the valley of the shadow of death knowing that i can do all things through christ which strengthens me he's not called us just to be a bunch of quotas he's not called us just to be able to be able to quote all the all the statements of faith and be able to tell you all the years that brother branham preached to us and tell us all the scriptures he's not looking for a computer he's got a bunch of tablets today that still don't know how to live right but god is looking for a vessel that's made of 16 elements that's got a soul that the devil can't kill well i've been studying all week but you ain't overcome one second that study didn't do you no good oh it hurts but i was listening there's a lot of people that list me tonight will walk out of here the same condition i can preach till i'm blue in the face i can scream i can lead you to the water but i still can't make you drink it but my cave my cave is so dark if you could see if you could see in my cave brother andrew you'd understand why i have this reluctancy to give forth i'm afraid that too many times we've mishandled this message and we've not produced what the message has called us to be brother branham said that i'm afraid that too many times we're getting the people to church instead of getting them to christ if all you are is identified is with full gospel lighthouse that's not good enough if all you're identified is with ron spencer's ministry or andrew spencer's ministry it's not good enough it's a time to be birthed by this word amen you know on rapture morning i'll never have another nightmare of young people getting destroyed by sin because we made it all then on rapture morning i'm not gonna be so sick of my stomach that i can't hardly come out of my study thinking if one person don't get this because we all made it on rapture mourning but i'm doing everything within my power to make sure that i give you all the ammunition to walk into that cave and come out i'm not giving you the ammunition to stay there get out of that cave my cave is scarred with alcoholism my cave my cave is scarred with all kinds of family troubles brother andrew my cave is scarred with drugs my cave is scarred with with parents that hurt me that abuse me you can tell me about all the stalactites and all the stalagmites all the parasites and all the dirty websites in all of your caves it's still a cave oh but my cave is so dark my cave is so deep my cave has got more bats in your bats i'm so scared of them it's still a cave but the word to you is to give you courage that mourning is coming and you ain't gotta stay in that cave no longer oh come on somebody it's a call to come up you can stay in that cave and die drunk you can stay in that cave and die being a gamer all your life or you can rise up out of that cave and said oh king i'll see you in the morning that's a thinking man's filter that's a man that thinks past what he's seeing a man with that kind of mentality he can look over there and see in isaiah 54 that this ain't just a blanket covering for all christians but this is for the heritage of the lord that there is no weapon that is formed against thee that shall prosper and every tongue that rises against thee in the judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the saints remember when that maniac came against the prophet he said in that book he said probably some of you read of that night when the maniac run to the platform out there in oregon was going to take my life and someone said brother branham was you scared i said no sir not a bit as long as jesus is there as long as he's told me to do this and i'm in his will there's nothing to fear as long as you're doing what he says do and you know you're doing and you're directly led well then there's nothing to fear perfect love cast out all fear there's no fearing god love takes away fear he said but when i turned to that man he said i knew he was whipped right there there was something on the inside that moved up and said don't fear i'm standing with you in another place he said there's never been one time that i stood at the pulpit and there'd be an ounce of fear that entered my heart to think about that here's a man that met satan himself in a challenge and there's not been one lick of fear as long as you know what you're doing and you're in the will of god there cannot be one ounce of fear that strikes your heart you ever been in that spot when it feels like you're staring hell right in the face it's kind of like what i'm preaching to tonight when hell is looking you right in the face you better know where you're standing at and you better have some courage about you maybe you won't like this but there'll be people that says you need to grin and bury or you need to suck it up you need to know where you're standing at you can either back up or you can bow and give in but when you're staring fear and staring hell right in the face and it's challenging everything that you believe in you better know where you're standing at that's why a prophet would tell us in works as faith expressed that we ought to be fearless in our testimony be fearless in our life be fearless in our walk but wayne lawson sent me a sent me a video this week of a lady had met i believe he met her in arkansas and she was i believe she was from new uh new mexico and she was in one of brother branham's meetings here and there was a girl a girl that she was acquainted with and that went through the prayer line there and she went through and they were acquainted with her she was about 18 years old and she was deaf and dumb and when she went through the when she went through the prayer line that brother branham held the microphone up to her voice up to her mouth there and she began to speak mama mama and she would say those things that she was miraculously healed and she went back home and she began to tell her parents of everything that she went through everything she experienced how brother branham told her all of these things and her parents called her a liar and told her that she'd been faking for all of that time of 18 years called her a liar mocked her and made fun of her and she lost her healing and she stopped confessing that she was healed you see you've got to hold on to that word if you've been given a word from the lord you hold on to that word i was given a word from the lord at the very beginning of our journey that this sickness is not unto death and i've held onto that word and i want you to know that there's got to be a shout that matches the miracle there will be a people that match what the word says hallelujah now notice if you're a son of god or a daughter of god you were in god all the time but he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted so now you're made a creature and son of god manifest the son and daughter of god to meet the challenge of the hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time you were manifested you can have a little swagger about yourself right there brother tom i was manifested to vindicate the message that's coming forth in this hour satan you can do all you want to move to me you can try to stop me but i was brought forth he knew in which pretty down that i be planted in and i am manifested to show the devil exactly who i am all blessed to be the name of the lord you see faith will pull you into a position to know that god is with you just like sam gar all those years all those times end of me coming in taking everything you own but one day shamgar remembered who he was he remembered that he had a birthright and he was tied to a covenant of the lord that he was a circumcised israelite and he was standing there and it was a time it was a time when the philistines was coming in and it was at harvest time that when those philistines came in to steal from him and schenger rose up in his position and he realized that the god of abraham and the god of isaac was with him shim guard got some courage about himself and he brought down 600 philistines the bible says in psalms 37 and 39 but the salvation of the righteousness is of the lord he is their strength in a time of trouble and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust because they trust in him you see if you trust him he'll use you like never before ain't no man ever walked out of this cave ain't nobody ever walked in here came out but daniel was a man like you and i daniel had what we'd call humanly he had complexes about him he had circumstances of life but daniel knew that god was with him and daniel could look back he could look back to what abraham went through and he could give him courage in the midst of his cave he can look back to see what lot went through and he looked that abraham took 318 of his of his male servants and he went down and recovered all that the enemy had stolen he could look back there he could see what the prophet said he realized that if god before me who can be against me and daniel could have courage in the midst of his cave now anybody can run from a line anybody can run from a roaring lion but it takes somebody that's got a god given courage that would look out as the moment that they're getting ready to be dropped in to a cave that says o king i see you in the morning though these hungry lions are roaring i will see you in the morning though i can feel their hot breath i will see you in the morning though i'm outnumbered i will see you in the morning though there's more form that gets me i will see you in the morning it takes courage when you're outnumbered but i want to tell you brother wanna put a flight a thousand and two ten thousand you are not alone in this battle there is a mighty army that has risen up with courage you can talk about the god of history they can talk about the god of the bible but it's a time that people start lifting him up out of the history i love hearing about moses i love hearing about paul i love hearing about brother branham but i want to hear about a god of today it's somebody that's not afraid to testify or somebody is not afraid i sought the holy ghost i believe for healing i believe for my family yeah it didn't look like it was coming but even when you don't feel like it's coming he's still working [Applause] hallelujah i looked past what i saw i could tell that the doctors was given up but i looked past what i saw i could see that people gave up on you but i looked past what i saw it takes a real courage for a pastor to stand here and you sit there and don't ever move it takes real courage for that man of god to say i'm not giving up until there's no breath left in my lungs [Applause] and i'm just the man that i'm not giving up on any person that's sitting here [Applause] afraid to shout that's the miracle afraid to dance that's the miracle afraid to clap your hands max the miracle oh yes pardon the noise it's just the sound of freedom [Applause] let's say you gotta go into a boxing ring and on the inside of that boxing ring is a mammoth ugly looking fella that's known as a keeler a killer he's not a killer a killer but on the inside he's been known to be dangerous and he slobbering at the mouth and he is calling your name out it would take some real courage if i told you all you got to do is get in that ring and hit him one time is that right it takes some real courage say sarah this dude's like seven foot seven he's got more muscles than you can imagine but all you gotta do is hit him one time it's gonna take some real courage to walk up in there oh i'd love to see that sarah walker how dare you look at me like that slobber i smack you how about i smack that slobber right off your face what if i told you that's all that it took and you knocked him down are you with me it don't take a whole lineup of scriptures it only takes one scripture to knock the devil down and he won't get back up hallelujah hallelujah brother branham said if i was a great beast that was attacking me he said well he wouldn't do me no good just to cut his claw off he said just knock his head off oh there's a goliath that's roaring at you and boasting but just hit him one time with the stone of revelation and it won't get back up allow me to lift this guard out of history for a moment the bible says in daniel 11 and 32 but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits you need to remind yourself that this is what he has done surely he can do it again when i look out upon a queen by the name of sister karen pruitt who came home on tuesday and had a great big welcoming party and did a little dance on herself on her own porch there when doctor said she couldn't live and if she would live she'd be a vegetable oh i'll tell you that'll give you courage in the midst of your cave that if god could do that for her he can do that for me there's a lady that's sitting here in the front pew that had masses amount of lymphatic leukemia that was present and they took scans and she is cancer-free that'll give you courage when you're going through a battle that if god can do it for her he can do it for me [Applause] you remember us lifting up sister sister dottie brian brother nathan bryant's mom she had cancer throughout her body had nodules on her breasts on her neck and in lymph nodes and cancer was widespread throughout her whole entire abdomen she had scans this past week and every bit of that cancer is completely gone except for one small lump that is decreased by half it's the only thing left and doctor said as far as he's concerned she's cancer-free there's no god like jehovah in 2020 we're seeing miracles like never before hallelujah and it gives me a courage that if he can do it for her he can do it for sister erica parker i talk to my brother george quinn king george every week and he sends his greetings every week but i got this note from brother george today and he said one important thing we will see miracles absolutely he said last week after church my daughter said to me did you hear that extra voice today i said no was it an angel voice for we've heard them sing with us at times she said no well what it is here it is the miracle my wife sister jacqueline did not have an easy childhood being the eldest her father was a drinker and they got treated very badly brother george said with that when i met her she could not sing and when we married i tried my utmost to help her to no avail she knew every hymn and how it should go but could not get the words out so my daughter said dad it was mom she sang out for the first time perhaps in 35 years and at the end of the prayer service she still can sing oh hallelujah there's a bride that's got a voice we got something to sing about we got something to shout about hallelujah brother harold they told you that you was gonna have you had all kinds of ulcers down three intestines but they looked through there and the scans show that we are seeing miracles in 2020 and they're completely gone that will give you courage that no matter the darkness of your cave you can come out of it this morning i woke up and i said god let there be an upper room experience today and before before nine o'clock i had done received all of these testimonies i said god you're doing it right here in this office what will you do in the whole house of god tonight i got this note from brother joseph harmon he sends his greetings as well [Laughter] he says has a toaster testimony you remember we lifted his mom up for prayer his mom was diagnosed the same week that brother ron was diagnosed she found out about his about his sickness she was she was eating up with cancer and medically there was no hope for her cancer in the stomach cancer in the lymph nodes cancer in the female organs i was moved by the holy spirit to pray for her and just last week she went back to the doctor for a checkup and the doctors declared her cancer-free there's no trace of it being in our bodies that doctors are stunned god miraculously healed her completely we will and have and are seeing miracles at 75 years old you think it's too late for god to do a work but at 75 years of age when doctors had given her no hope the fire of god burned the cancer out of her body and leaving absolutely no trace of it [Applause] if you don't know this god you can experience this god if you're listening by the way of the internet and you design that upper room experience you can have that upper room experience that same god is not bound by time nor airwaves he's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that i could ever ask of here think of him i could have a brother's dim the lights for me i believe we ought to be fearless in our testimony are you with me on december the 22nd we was asked to trust god and he would use us like never before shortly after being diagnosed with cancer melanoma in his lymph nodes and in his lungs on march the 6 the first brain surgery was performed on your pastor by the wrong this is the first picture after surgery if we could show the second picture now to me this ain't just working on some car this is the brain they're dealing with and i i remember numbers like nothing else and so does my dad i went in and i asked him directly after surgery very specific numbers that only he and i would know about and he was spitting them off like that this picture that you see is four days after brain surgery back at home third picture please this picture is from march the 17th this was a very very dark day when we had to go back to uva and they was telling us that the other tumors and brother aaron's brain was bleeding again and that they would have to do more surgeries and the doctors were telling us now the more surgery we do the more brain tissue you lose and the memory you lose and sight you lose and all of these things and this is when covet was first striking and they weren't allowing hardly anybody in hospitals but i went with a purpose i went with a purpose i dressed to the lines and i made sure i got in there because i didn't have a commission from a doctor but i had a commission from god to walk into a hospital room to lay hands on a sick and they shall recover fourth picture please this is right after surgery don't that blondie look good fifth picture this is two days after brain surgery and he's back home and what is he immediately doing he is studying and he is calling the devil's name and putting the devil in his place i'd say that that would give you courage in the midst of your case next picture please this picture is on may the 3rd when all we had was a skeleton crew but this is the first time that brother ron spoke to you after two brain surgeries hallelujah hallelujah that ought to give you courage to come out of that cave next picture please [Laughter] this is on july the 2nd when we took a trip to louisiana where i witnessed three boys get the baptism of the holy ghost in an instant the weekend before brother ron had spoken was inspired inspired and he spoke that 17 hours those people would drive to brother branham in ambulances and they had to get to jesus live or die it was 17 hours for us to get to louisiana and he dropped god dropped in brother ron's heart i got to get to jesus my miracle is identified there god dropped it in his heart and what you're watching and witnessing is when a miracle was birthed i enjoy preaching to you but i whole lot more enjoy preaching with my partner in crime and taking down giants one at a time since that time he has spoke to you every sunday morning he has gotten stronger he has preached like the old ron spencer he's called the devil out in the street and he shot him right in the eyes that ought to give you courage to walk into a cave and come out of it glory be to god the lions tried to shut up mouth but an angel stood up the angel stood up the angel stood up and if an angel stood up for brother eye if an angel stood up for sister terry if an angel stood up for sister angela he will stand up for you he is on the rise and he's coming i got one more clip for you go ahead brother brothers i'm gonna preach now for a little while there ought to be enough god on the inside of you this is time for me to go to church and when i get there i'm gonna have church i'm not worried about who i'm sitting with i'm not worried about what everybody else is doing i come to have an encounter with jesus i come to worship the lord i come to have a [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah does that look like a man that had brain surgery does that look like a man that doctors had that he'd never preached again that he'd never be able to be the same man that he was i say to you doctors oh hallelujah the music is more important than the struggle that ought to give you courage to get out of your cave let the musicians come now i've been told did a little bit of research i've been doing this for three weeks and i've been trying to every find every corner in the cave so i could call it out for you and tell you you can come out of that cave but what i don't know what you call them scientists or archaeologists but they say the best way to explore a cave is to sing in it they say it's the best way because you can find it can be dark all around you but if you're singing you can find out if then you're in a hollow spot a real shallow spot or you can find out if you're in a great big hall now a lot of times back before they had loudspeakers of things what the musicians would do they would go and they'd take all of their instruments and they would go down into these caverns and they would have themself a musical because of all of the sound that was able to let it loose in there that they didn't have to amplify but the cave had the ability to silence some and it had the ability to echo others oh hallelujah hallelujah you see if you're in the midst of your cave the best place to be able to explore your cave and find your way out of that cave maybe you can't see the light but just go to sing it just go to sing and you'll find out how close you are to the opening and when you don't hear the echo no more you realize that you're getting ready to come out oh david said that i will extol thee oh lord how will it sing unto the lord david said in psalms 150 praise he the lord praise god in the sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty hacks praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with a sultry and a heart praise him with a timber praise him with a dance praise him with string instruments and organs praise him with loud sound and symbols praise him upon the high seldom symbols let everything that hath breath praise ye the lord you hear that you hear that you're coming out of the cave don't let nothing silence your voice
