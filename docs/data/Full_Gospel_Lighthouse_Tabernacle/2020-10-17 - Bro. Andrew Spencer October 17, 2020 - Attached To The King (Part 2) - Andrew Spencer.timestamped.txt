[37:55] but the house on the rock remained
[38:02] one day a pharisee to jesus
[38:05] brought a woman in adultery caught
[38:10] that man walked away in the sand
[38:14] condemned
[38:16] but the woman's guilt was gone
[38:25] jesus stood for sinners that no one else
[38:29] would stand for
[38:32] then he stood at calvary when we thought
[38:35] he could stand no more
[38:50] in the days after jesus had gone away
[38:54] a man named stephen was full of faith
[38:59] but
[38:59] because of men who were full of hate
[39:04] he went on trial for his faith
[39:16] he fearlessly preached about the days
[39:20] of when the prophets their fathers
[39:23] laid and how they all rejected
[39:27] the holy ghost stephen gave his life
[39:32] that day and that's why we remember his
[39:37] name

[49:58] father i believe that sometimes it
[50:02] just kind of it takes our breath to
[50:04] think about that father
[50:06] to to think that when we go to lifting
[50:08] up holy hands and begin to
[50:11] lift up hands which gravity wants to
[50:12] hold down and lift up our voice
[50:15] it kind of catches us lord and makes us
[50:18] realize
[50:19] how powerful our praise is lord may we
[50:23] never take it for granted the the

[51:04] are connected with so many people in
[51:06] different areas of life and
[51:08] different different places father but
[51:10] tonight i pray
[51:12] lord specifically for full gospel
[51:14] lighthouse i pray
[51:15] that you would pour out a blessing on

[51:47] very special way
[51:49] lord i pray that you would take the
[51:51] words of life and
[51:53] just come into our our hearts lord and
[51:56] minister to us
[51:57] on a level that we would know that that
[52:00] was jesus speaking
[52:02] i come lord like the greeks came and
[52:06] they would say we would see
[52:08] jesus but they turned away because they
[52:12] could not see past the veil i pray you
[52:15] open our eyes this evening that we would
[52:17] see you
[52:18] oh we love you and appreciate you in
[52:21] jesus name
[52:22] amen if you have your bibles we'll turn
[52:24] over in the book of genesis chapter 4
[52:27] and verse 1 and then first john chapter
[52:30] 4.
[52:34] genesis chapter four and then first john
[52:36] chapter four
[52:38] amen it's good to be in the house of the
[52:44] lord i'd like to speak to you this
[52:47] evening again
[52:48] on the thought on attached to the king
[52:51] attached to the king amen
[52:56] everybody happy this evening and
[52:59] wonderful amen
[53:02] the bible says here and adam knew his
[53:04] wife
[53:06] and she conceived and bear cain and said
[53:09] i have begotten a man from the lord and
[53:11] she again bear his brother abel
[53:14] and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain
[53:18] was a tiller of the ground and in the
[53:20] process of time it came to pass that
[53:23] cain
[53:24] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[53:26] offering unto the lord
[53:27] and abel he also brought of the
[53:30] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[53:32] thereof
[53:34] and the lord had respect unto abel and
[53:37] to his offering
[53:38] but unto cain and to his offering he had
[53:41] not
[53:41] respect and cain was very wroth and his
[53:45] countenance failed
[53:47] first john chapter 4 and verse 1
[53:52] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[53:55] the
[53:56] spirits whether they are of god because
[53:59] many false prophets are gone out into
[54:01] the world
[54:02] hereby we know that hereby know ye
[54:06] the spirit of god every every spirit
[54:09] that confesses
[54:10] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[54:13] is of god
[54:14] now notice there's a there's a
[54:16] two-letter word that you'll catch if
[54:19] if you're paying attention through this
[54:20] through this dialogue we read here this
[54:22] evening
[54:24] of of and it's a very very pertinent to
[54:27] our fault this evening
[54:28] but notice that hereby know ye the
[54:31] spirit of god
[54:32] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[54:35] christ
[54:36] is coming the flesh is of god and every
[54:39] spirit that confesseth not that jesus
[54:42] christ has come in the flesh
[54:44] is not of god and this is that spirit of
[54:47] antichrist whereof ye have
[54:50] heard that it should come and even now
[54:52] already
[54:53] is it in the world ye are of god little
[54:56] children
[54:57] and have overcame them because greater
[55:00] is he that is in you
[55:01] than he that is in the world they
[55:05] are of the world therefore they speak of
[55:08] the world
[55:09] and the world heareth them we are of god
[55:14] amen we are of god he that knoweth god
[55:18] heareth us and he that is not of god
[55:21] heareth not us hereby know we the spirit
[55:25] of truth
[55:26] and the spirit of aaron may god bless
[55:28] his word you may be seated in the
[55:29] presence of the lord
[55:30] so he said we'd like to speak to you on
[55:32] this thought on attached
[55:34] attached to the king and if you go to
[55:36] looking at that word
[55:38] of of it it means the expressing
[55:42] of the relationship between a part and a
[55:44] whole
[55:45] and when when you're using that word of
[55:48] it
[55:48] is it is saying that that this whatever
[55:50] you are saying is identifying with this
[55:53] as i would say that that this is a
[55:56] sleeve of my coat
[55:57] or just like i maybe we would say that
[56:01] saturday is one of the days of the week
[56:03] or
[56:03] or it's a it's a it's a series it's a
[56:06] series of sermons or
[56:07] or i can't wait to get a piece of my
[56:10] favorite cake you see you're taking a
[56:14] part of something when you're
[56:16] identifying and putting of in that place
[56:19] and you're placing and saying that that
[56:21] there is a relationship between this
[56:24] one thing and the other and notice
[56:27] what what the word of god says in first
[56:30] john 4
[56:30] 4 that that ye are of
[56:33] god now if you if that's all you catch
[56:36] here this evening you went away you
[56:38] could go away very happy
[56:40] that that you are being expression
[56:43] of a part of the whole that you are of
[56:47] god is that right that ye
[56:50] are of god hallelujah you see we're a
[56:54] part of god
[56:55] and if we are a part of god then no more
[56:58] we can no more perish than what god can
[57:00] perish
[57:01] and the prophet would say that in he
[57:04] that is in you he said you
[57:05] are of god little children and have
[57:07] overcame them
[57:08] talking of the antichrist because
[57:11] greater is he that is
[57:12] in you than he that's in the world has
[57:15] two pronouns see
[57:16] he personal pronoun and he that is in
[57:19] the world and he that's in you
[57:21] and he that's in you is greater than he
[57:24] that's in the world now to me
[57:26] that gives me great consolation this
[57:28] evening that he that's on the inside of
[57:31] me
[57:31] is greater than anything out there in
[57:33] the world
[57:34] anything any new germ that they come up
[57:37] with
[57:38] this god is greater than what they've
[57:40] got out there
[57:41] anything that satan wants to develop in
[57:44] his
[57:44] in his laboratories i am saying to you
[57:47] and the bible is saying to you that
[57:49] stronger is he
[57:51] that is in you than he that is in the
[57:54] world
[57:55] and he would say in in thinking man's
[57:57] filter he said that
[57:58] when you're born of the spirit of god
[58:01] you
[58:01] you are a son of god you always was a
[58:04] son of god and you always will be a son
[58:07] of god
[58:08] and there's no way to separate it
[58:10] because you
[58:11] have eternal life and eternal never did
[58:14] begin
[58:15] i don't think that even people in the in
[58:18] the
[58:19] denominational realm even grasp the
[58:21] power
[58:22] of eternal that if you would begin to
[58:25] think about that
[58:26] this being is temporal but there's
[58:28] something that is laying there that is
[58:30] eternal
[58:31] that will never pass away that will
[58:34] never perish that
[58:35] that even though you get sick and body
[58:37] that soul is still
[58:39] saved and sealed until the day of
[58:41] redemption
[58:42] you see you can go through the pressure
[58:44] cooker of life
[58:45] but there has been a preserve that has
[58:47] been put on top of you
[58:49] it don't matter you can put uh you can
[58:50] put a black jar in the pressure cooker
[58:52] you can put a green jar in a pressure
[58:54] cooker you can put a blue jar and a
[58:56] pressure cooker
[58:57] you can put a clear jar in a pressure
[58:59] cooker but if the seal's been put on
[59:02] there
[59:02] it will be preserved are you with me for
[59:05] years on top of years
[59:07] and you may be all kinds of different
[59:09] races you may have come in
[59:11] all kinds of different colors but i want
[59:13] to say to you
[59:14] that if you have been put in the
[59:16] pressure cooker of life
[59:18] and there's been a seal put on you you
[59:20] can go through
[59:21] covet in flying covers you can go
[59:24] through laodicea
[59:25] with flying colors because there has
[59:27] been a preserver
[59:29] that has put a seal on top of you that
[59:31] you will not be troubled
[59:33] by the sickness and by laodicea and all
[59:36] of the things of life
[59:38] and satan can't keep the revelation down
[59:41] when god wants to give it
[59:45] hallelujah now if you notice and just
[59:48] just turn back your clock just for a few
[59:50] minutes and you look back into the 1960s
[59:54] and you will see that there were three
[59:56] kings that were on the scene in 1960s
[59:59] and you watch as the movement of those
[1:00:01] three kings
[1:00:02] how that there was an attachment that
[1:00:04] was made to those three
[1:00:06] kings there you watched the movement of
[1:00:08] martin luther king
[1:00:10] and you watch as as men would would
[1:00:13] strive
[1:00:14] and they would they would press their
[1:00:15] way to be a part of that movement they
[1:00:17] would attach themselves
[1:00:19] and even a prophet would say he said
[1:00:21] they're not down there in slavery if
[1:00:23] they were in slavery he said i'd be down
[1:00:25] there with
[1:00:25] them but you watch as people would
[1:00:29] identify themselves with that movement
[1:00:31] and be identified with the king and even
[1:00:34] today you still see the work of that
[1:00:36] king
[1:00:37] are you with me it's still leading
[1:00:40] millions to their death
[1:00:42] identifying themselves with a movement
[1:00:45] that they are attaching themselves to a
[1:00:48] to a kingship in this world but also
[1:00:51] there was another king on the scene
[1:00:53] there was the king of rock and roll
[1:00:54] elvis and there's a lot of people that
[1:00:56] still call him their king
[1:00:59] are you with me i have to say that he
[1:01:01] probably wasn't nothing but a hound dog
[1:01:03] but you watched that there was an
[1:01:05] attachment to people that attached
[1:01:08] himself
[1:01:08] to a movement of a king
[1:01:12] you watch how that he come out of that
[1:01:14] pentecostal realm
[1:01:16] and then he began to he began to take
[1:01:19] that ability and that potential that he
[1:01:21] had
[1:01:22] that he got in his grandfather's tent
[1:01:24] revival
[1:01:25] he would take that and manipulate the
[1:01:28] power
[1:01:29] of worship and manipulate it in such a
[1:01:32] way
[1:01:32] that people would become attached in the
[1:01:35] spirit realm
[1:01:36] to a song that would send their
[1:01:40] souls to a devil hell you see they
[1:01:43] they're they well i'm just listening to
[1:01:45] it i just
[1:01:46] love that kind of music you see when you
[1:01:49] do that
[1:01:50] you are attaching yourself to a king
[1:01:55] the king of rock and roll but also in
[1:01:57] the 1960s
[1:01:59] there was more than earthly kings that
[1:02:01] were on the scene
[1:02:02] there was another king there was king
[1:02:05] jesus
[1:02:06] that was on the scene and there was a
[1:02:08] people that were attaching themselves to
[1:02:10] a kingship
[1:02:12] they were identifying themselves that
[1:02:15] this voice that they were hearing
[1:02:17] is the voice from another realm
[1:02:21] they were attaching themself to a king's
[1:02:23] word
[1:02:24] are you with me they were attaching
[1:02:27] themselves to a pull of the word
[1:02:29] that was drawing them not to a man but
[1:02:33] to a
[1:02:34] ministry of the son of man
[1:02:38] i say that you're that kind of people
[1:02:41] that you are the people of an open book
[1:02:45] that have attached yourself to a kingdom
[1:02:48] to a kingdom that will never cease to a
[1:02:51] kingdom that will never fall
[1:02:54] are you with me there we know that the
[1:02:56] governments of the world
[1:02:58] and the kingdoms of the world they will
[1:03:00] fall
[1:03:01] they were offered to jesus but jesus
[1:03:04] turned them down because he knew that he
[1:03:05] was going to come heir to them in the
[1:03:07] millennium
[1:03:08] but he told us right there that the
[1:03:10] governments of the world
[1:03:12] wherein the kingdoms of the world were
[1:03:15] of
[1:03:15] the devil and the devil had complete
[1:03:17] control over them
[1:03:19] but this world is not my home
[1:03:22] i'm just a passing through the kingdom
[1:03:26] and the citizenship that i am under is a
[1:03:29] kingdom that
[1:03:30] will never cease
[1:03:33] he said and hear ye him he said if if
[1:03:36] we could have an obedience to those
[1:03:39] three words tonight
[1:03:42] you'll see a repeat of pentecost in this
[1:03:45] building
[1:03:46] it's just small but oh there's enough
[1:03:48] power in there
[1:03:50] that the rest of the bible
[1:03:54] will connect to it oh
[1:03:57] hear ye him you see if you could if you
[1:04:00] could identify yourself
[1:04:02] and come under obedience to those words
[1:04:05] of hear ye him
[1:04:07] that if you go to hearing this and you
[1:04:10] go to eating this
[1:04:11] and you go to digesting this you go to
[1:04:14] manifesting this
[1:04:16] is that right you are what you eat
[1:04:20] if you don't eat this whole book you
[1:04:22] will only produce
[1:04:24] part of the book but i don't believe
[1:04:27] that we are a people
[1:04:28] that's just wanting to produce half the
[1:04:31] book
[1:04:32] this is a full gospel this is a seven
[1:04:35] course menu that we have been given
[1:04:38] from above and
[1:04:41] we have received a kingdom that
[1:04:44] cannot be shook and we have heard a
[1:04:48] voice from another world
[1:04:50] that has told us this world
[1:04:54] is not your home what was god doing he
[1:04:58] was gathering himself a body
[1:05:02] now i read this to you last week and
[1:05:04] i'll give it to the brother so they
[1:05:05] could put it up and i feel it's
[1:05:07] fitting so that you catch where we're
[1:05:08] going
[1:05:10] and he says now it says that he hath
[1:05:12] chosen us
[1:05:13] in him jesus
[1:05:16] let's say it together he hath chosen us
[1:05:19] in him
[1:05:20] jesus before the foundation of the world
[1:05:23] that means that that we're right there
[1:05:26] with him in the mind and thoughts of god
[1:05:28] before the foundation of the world that
[1:05:31] gives
[1:05:32] an eternal quality to the elect
[1:05:36] you can't get away from that let me
[1:05:37] inject the thought in here
[1:05:39] even our natural birth is based upon
[1:05:42] election
[1:05:43] the female ovaries produce many many
[1:05:45] eggs but
[1:05:46] why is it that at a certain time at a
[1:05:49] certain
[1:05:50] time an egg comes down and all another
[1:05:52] one and then amongst the male sperm for
[1:05:54] no known reason
[1:05:55] a certain germ attaches itself to the
[1:05:58] egg
[1:05:59] while others so that could have that
[1:06:01] could have just as easily attached
[1:06:03] himself
[1:06:04] or had a better opportunity to do so did
[1:06:07] not do so
[1:06:08] and perished there is an intelligence
[1:06:12] behind all of this otherwise what
[1:06:15] determines whether the baby is a boy or
[1:06:17] a girl
[1:06:18] blonde brunette light or dark type of
[1:06:20] eyes and etc
[1:06:22] you can read all the books you want to
[1:06:24] about how
[1:06:25] you that you can eat this type of
[1:06:27] vegetable or
[1:06:28] this type of cookie and if you eat this
[1:06:32] type of lemon bar or this whatever that
[1:06:34] it'll produce
[1:06:35] it'll have the ability to produce the
[1:06:38] genetics that you're wanting you're
[1:06:40] wanting the redhead sure we all wanted a
[1:06:42] red here coming out of the spencer
[1:06:43] family
[1:06:44] i don't know why i know how redheads are
[1:06:47] but we all wanted a redhead but we
[1:06:49] didn't get a red hit
[1:06:50] so there's got to be an intelligence
[1:06:52] that's over
[1:06:53] toppled all of this are you with me
[1:06:57] i'd say that there's some of you that
[1:06:59] would say you know what
[1:07:00] if i could i would look like brother
[1:07:03] william back there honestly if i could
[1:07:05] be about six foot
[1:07:06] six foot five i'd never have to worry i
[1:07:08] don't know six foot two
[1:07:09] i wouldn't ever have to worry about
[1:07:10] getting my skin all burned up like a
[1:07:12] lobster
[1:07:13] wouldn't have to wear long sleeve shirts
[1:07:15] everywhere sure we'd like to pick out a
[1:07:17] different stature
[1:07:18] i'd like to be the size of josh jones
[1:07:20] back there when i come through the doors
[1:07:22] the devil knows i'm in a place but you
[1:07:25] see
[1:07:26] there is an intelligence that tells
[1:07:29] every person
[1:07:30] what they're going to be like he knows
[1:07:33] how tall you are
[1:07:34] how skinny you are how fat you are how
[1:07:37] short you
[1:07:38] are he's in control
[1:07:42] oh wouldn't you like to have the button
[1:07:44] to push yes
[1:07:48] six foot two dark hair
[1:07:51] perfect teeth breath never smells bad
[1:07:58] they made a tool for that it's called a
[1:08:00] toothbrush
[1:08:01] you might want to try it out ask your
[1:08:03] wife
[1:08:04] but you think about that every person
[1:08:07] sitting in this place tonight
[1:08:09] is completely made up differently if you
[1:08:11] go to looking at your fingerprints
[1:08:14] there's not one of you in here that has
[1:08:17] the same identical
[1:08:18] fingerprint as the person beside you
[1:08:22] you see there's a code that is laying on
[1:08:25] the inside of your human genos
[1:08:28] that tells you where you came from
[1:08:31] and if you go to studying out dna and
[1:08:34] you go to looking at the
[1:08:35] the power of dna to me
[1:08:39] when i go to reading those things i'm
[1:08:41] just thanking the lord that he's in
[1:08:43] control of all this
[1:08:45] and but when you go to looking at how
[1:08:47] powerful
[1:08:48] the human body is how so
[1:08:52] precise that it is when you go and look
[1:08:54] at an eyeball
[1:08:55] and you look at all the different nerves
[1:08:58] of everything that runs through there
[1:09:00] there's got to be somebody that's in
[1:09:03] control
[1:09:04] surely we didn't just evolve into these
[1:09:07] creatures of matter that we are
[1:09:10] but if you look at that gene if you
[1:09:13] would take a gene which you can't even
[1:09:15] see with your own eyes
[1:09:16] there's millions of them if you let them
[1:09:18] put them underneath a microscope
[1:09:20] but if you would take that one dna
[1:09:23] sale and you would stretch that one
[1:09:26] dna cell it would be over six
[1:09:30] foot long
[1:09:34] one little cell but if you would take
[1:09:37] the whole dna from a human body
[1:09:41] it's over a hundred billion miles
[1:09:44] of dna that's in one
[1:09:48] body you have enough dna
[1:09:52] inside of your body to span our solar
[1:09:55] system
[1:09:56] 14 times
[1:10:01] but i got the choice today
[1:10:05] whether i want to be a male or a female
[1:10:10] you see the kind of leodyster age that
[1:10:14] we are in
[1:10:15] when people want to manipulate the cells
[1:10:18] of
[1:10:18] life and they want to turn and change
[1:10:22] what they were there
[1:10:25] is an intelligence that told you that
[1:10:27] you was going to be a boy
[1:10:29] and there was an intelligence that told
[1:10:32] you that you was going to be a girl
[1:10:34] and if you've got some kind of
[1:10:36] intelligence that's telling you
[1:10:38] that you have the right to change that
[1:10:41] you need to change
[1:10:42] your own intelligence
[1:10:46] god made you into the creature
[1:10:49] that you are
[1:10:54] hallelujah
[1:10:57] hallelujah i'm more than here just to
[1:10:59] give you a science lesson on dna tonight
[1:11:02] i'm trying to tell you where you came
[1:11:03] from
[1:11:05] if i can tell you where you came from
[1:11:07] and you can realize where you're going
[1:11:10] there won't be one thing down here
[1:11:12] that'll control your mind
[1:11:14] more than just getting up there
[1:11:19] one dna cell one of them
[1:11:23] has enough storing power to hold
[1:11:27] and is the equivalent to 358
[1:11:31] 000 hours of hd video
[1:11:35] one cell you see you are carrying
[1:11:40] things in your in your dna code that are
[1:11:43] telling you
[1:11:43] that this was your grandfather that this
[1:11:46] was your grandmother
[1:11:47] and search it all the way back and
[1:11:50] you'll watch as those
[1:11:51] those dna cells that were brought down
[1:11:54] through the issues of life
[1:11:56] and they're passed right on through you
[1:11:58] and going to your children
[1:12:00] and it just keeps going and going and
[1:12:02] going
[1:12:05] but you see there's so much dna
[1:12:10] that's laying on the inside of you 358
[1:12:14] 000 hours if you watched it
[1:12:19] if you watched it it would take you
[1:12:23] i believe over 90 years
[1:12:26] watching it every hour of your life
[1:12:29] to watch one dna cell
[1:12:35] but i want you to think about this where
[1:12:38] did you come from
[1:12:41] where are you attached from you see you
[1:12:44] can
[1:12:45] i save you some money they got this
[1:12:47] thing out there
[1:12:49] and call it i'll just give it to you in
[1:12:52] in simple virginia language you can spit
[1:12:55] in this tube
[1:12:57] and you can put it in the mail and
[1:12:59] they'll send it off to somewhere
[1:13:01] in kalamazoo and they'll send it back to
[1:13:04] you and they'll
[1:13:05] tell you where you came from let me tell
[1:13:07] you something saints
[1:13:08] let me save you 59 or 100 dollars
[1:13:12] i know where you came from if you are
[1:13:15] born again son and daughter of god
[1:13:18] you came from god and you're going back
[1:13:20] to god
[1:13:22] and there's so much dna of the blood of
[1:13:26] jesus christ on the inside of you
[1:13:28] if there's 358 000 hours
[1:13:32] let satan study that dna look it over
[1:13:36] satan
[1:13:36] take a look at this dna take a look at
[1:13:39] what the blood did
[1:13:41] it didn't just cover my flesh it covered
[1:13:44] every cell in my body
[1:13:48] oh there is a blood
[1:13:51] hallelujah
[1:13:54] so if there to be a son of god you had
[1:13:56] to be in him
[1:13:57] always that gene of your life that
[1:14:00] spiritual life tonight was in god the
[1:14:02] father
[1:14:03] before there was ever even a molecule
[1:14:07] and you're nothing but the manifestation
[1:14:10] of the gene of life that was in god as a
[1:14:14] son of god
[1:14:15] now you're expressed after his word has
[1:14:18] come in you to light up this age
[1:14:26] walk out the door you can go out here
[1:14:28] saying
[1:14:29] that i was before the foundation of the
[1:14:31] world and i was manifested in this hour
[1:14:35] that gene was released in this hour to
[1:14:37] light up this age
[1:14:38] there might be some people that want to
[1:14:40] put it out there might be some people
[1:14:42] that want to kill us
[1:14:43] but we were manifested to light up the
[1:14:46] age
[1:14:47] that was the darkest of all ages
[1:14:50] when nobody wants the word no more with
[1:14:53] no money when nobody wants the baptism
[1:14:55] of the holy ghost anymore
[1:14:57] there is a gene seed of god that was
[1:15:00] electing you and choosing you
[1:15:02] before there was an ever molecule ever
[1:15:05] spoken into existence
[1:15:12] hallelujah you can't impersonate this
[1:15:15] seed
[1:15:17] you can't dress it up science may be
[1:15:19] able to hybridize
[1:15:21] and they might be able to manipulate the
[1:15:24] the
[1:15:24] the gene of a flower and the gene the
[1:15:27] gene of a tree
[1:15:28] and a and of a plant and manipulate it
[1:15:31] and
[1:15:32] hybridize out but only the original will
[1:15:35] bring forth life you can plant that
[1:15:38] hybrid
[1:15:39] and it will not come up again the next
[1:15:41] year but you take that original life
[1:15:44] and you put it down in the ground it's
[1:15:46] got to come up
[1:15:48] that's why i know that if there is a
[1:15:50] gene seed of god
[1:15:52] that's sitting on the inside of you when
[1:15:54] the word of the sun
[1:15:56] begins to come across your life it'll
[1:15:59] bring it up
[1:16:02] he's the one that planted it surely he
[1:16:05] can get it up
[1:16:07] i'm not going to give up what i was
[1:16:11] i'm not going to give up my drinking i'm
[1:16:13] not going to give up my good old times
[1:16:16] try all you want to are you with me
[1:16:20] if you're his god is good at getting his
[1:16:22] children
[1:16:26] he knows where you're sitting at you can
[1:16:28] play hide and seek all you want to
[1:16:31] he's coming for you hallelujah
[1:16:34] and he ain't ever lost one surely he
[1:16:37] can't lose him now
[1:16:40] if he thought of you before the world
[1:16:42] ever began
[1:16:43] surely
[1:16:47] him being an infinite god knows where
[1:16:49] your hiding place is
[1:16:51] well there's no hiding place down here
[1:16:55] there's no hiding place down here
[1:17:00] oh hallelujah
[1:17:04] hallelujah might be one of them singing
[1:17:06] songs
[1:17:07] singing sermons tonight get y'all happy
[1:17:09] here hallelujah
[1:17:11] when we go back and you look at our text
[1:17:13] of genesis chapter 4
[1:17:15] and you watch how that it was the seed
[1:17:19] that made the difference and you notice
[1:17:22] what eve said notice
[1:17:23] it was eve that said this that i have
[1:17:26] gotten a son from the lord
[1:17:28] you know brother biscuit he put his
[1:17:31] whole
[1:17:32] he put his whole emphasis when he was
[1:17:34] coming to brother branham with his
[1:17:36] questions on serpent seed
[1:17:37] he come to him with genesis chapter 4
[1:17:42] and he laid it out before him and he
[1:17:45] took away every bit
[1:17:47] of his strategy when he said that's
[1:17:49] absolutely the truth
[1:17:51] he said but go on and read verse two he
[1:17:54] said i
[1:17:54] had spent so much time studying verse 1
[1:17:58] that i didn't know what verse 2 was
[1:18:01] hallelujah hallelujah and she
[1:18:04] again bore abel
[1:18:07] certainly god is the only creator of
[1:18:10] life
[1:18:11] only life can come through god it can't
[1:18:14] come through satan
[1:18:15] satan can pervert but he cannot create
[1:18:19] but you see but you see god is the only
[1:18:22] creator and through the spirit
[1:18:24] that he let come upon him you couldn't
[1:18:27] attach what cain did
[1:18:29] to what got to god you couldn't attach
[1:18:32] that jealousy
[1:18:33] spirit that was on cane to god that
[1:18:36] didn't come from god
[1:18:37] that came from the pits of hell and let
[1:18:40] me say it to you now
[1:18:42] it still comes from the pits of hell
[1:18:45] i'm jealous of this christian watch what
[1:18:48] you're attaching yourself to
[1:18:52] you see where did he get that nature to
[1:18:54] be jealous from
[1:18:56] his father from satan his father where
[1:18:59] did he get that spirit of murder the
[1:19:01] first murder
[1:19:02] you couldn't say that come out of god it
[1:19:04] had to come
[1:19:05] out of the devil but you watch what abel
[1:19:09] brought forth
[1:19:10] you watch the issues of life where did
[1:19:14] abel come from
[1:19:16] when you watch what he brought before
[1:19:17] the lord his sacrifice
[1:19:20] it had to come from adam
[1:19:24] you see but cain bore the full
[1:19:27] spiritual characteristics of satan and
[1:19:30] the animalistic sensual fleshly
[1:19:32] characteristics of the serpent
[1:19:35] notice in first john 3 and 12 he says
[1:19:38] that not as cain who was of
[1:19:42] that wicked one apart identified with
[1:19:46] the whole
[1:19:47] cain was of that wicked one
[1:19:51] so you see the power of the seed that
[1:19:54] the seed
[1:19:55] was the one that made the difference
[1:19:57] that you had one of the serpent seed
[1:19:59] and one of the seed of adam you watched
[1:20:02] that seed
[1:20:04] it'll be so close
[1:20:08] cain longed to worship god
[1:20:13] cain was as religious as abel but you
[1:20:16] watch what
[1:20:18] cain brought cain brought of the fruit
[1:20:21] of the land
[1:20:22] showing are you with me showing where he
[1:20:24] was coming from
[1:20:25] but abel caught a revelation abel caught
[1:20:29] a revelation of faith
[1:20:30] that it was the blood that got them out
[1:20:32] of eden that'll put them back into eden
[1:20:35] and surely it'll be blood that'll put
[1:20:37] you back there
[1:20:38] abel knew that this was the only way
[1:20:42] that god would receive his sacrifice
[1:20:46] the seed always produces exactly
[1:20:50] what it is you watch as that true and
[1:20:53] that false fine
[1:20:54] as they begin to intertwingle themselves
[1:20:57] i didn't say that right that's country
[1:20:59] but they begin to intertwine themselves
[1:21:02] and they begin they get so
[1:21:03] close that if you don't pay attention
[1:21:07] you can't watch which one's the true one
[1:21:10] and which one's the false one
[1:21:12] but oh there's an angel that knows
[1:21:15] he knows where you're sitting at tonight
[1:21:17] he knows where you are
[1:21:19] in your home he knows who you are
[1:21:22] this ain't some santa claus that just
[1:21:24] watches you when you're sleeping
[1:21:26] he sees when you're pouting he sees when
[1:21:28] you're awake
[1:21:29] he knows all of your mistakes this is a
[1:21:32] god that knows
[1:21:33] all things
[1:21:38] you see and when you watch when it come
[1:21:41] time for the royal seed
[1:21:44] the second adam not to be born he was
[1:21:46] not born of man
[1:21:48] but he was conceived in the womb of mary
[1:21:51] that mary was the incubator to bring
[1:21:54] forth the perfect sun
[1:21:56] you see that blood cell it had to come
[1:22:00] from his father you see it
[1:22:04] that blood is passed down the life is
[1:22:07] passed down
[1:22:09] from the husband
[1:22:14] it was not part mary neither was it part
[1:22:18] god
[1:22:19] it was all god if it was just
[1:22:22] part mary and part god we're all lost
[1:22:25] tonight
[1:22:26] you see what you got god doing right
[1:22:28] there having an
[1:22:30] act with a fleshly woman it won't work
[1:22:33] it won't get you out of the grave it
[1:22:35] won't get you
[1:22:36] it won't make you whole but the blood
[1:22:39] that i'm talking about tonight
[1:22:41] that is all god it'll get you out of the
[1:22:43] grave
[1:22:44] it'll wash your sin it'll pick you up
[1:22:48] and make you a new creature in christ
[1:22:49] jesus
[1:22:50] oh this blood hallelujah is not part jew
[1:22:54] nor part gentile it's all god
[1:22:58] his created blood cell
[1:23:02] and when that blood cell broke at
[1:23:04] calvary
[1:23:07] all my sins are washed
[1:23:10] they're all washed away
[1:23:15] hallelujah well you see mary was not
[1:23:18] that seed she was simply
[1:23:21] a carrier of that seed just like
[1:23:24] pentecost
[1:23:25] pentecost was not that seed pentecost
[1:23:29] was a carrier of that seed
[1:23:32] and you watch as it was so close
[1:23:35] that even jesus would say in matthew 24
[1:23:38] that in the last days that it would be
[1:23:39] so close
[1:23:40] that it would deceive the very elect if
[1:23:43] it was
[1:23:44] possible you watch as that stalk is
[1:23:47] coming forth
[1:23:48] but you remember that the that the seed
[1:23:51] will not be air with that suck as it's
[1:23:53] coming all the way
[1:23:54] up through there that life is pressing
[1:23:57] out
[1:24:01] some of you are ashamed of where you
[1:24:02] came from but if you remember
[1:24:04] it was pentecost that protected you it
[1:24:07] was pentecost
[1:24:09] that protected that seed are you with me
[1:24:12] are you with me you see for you to have
[1:24:15] life
[1:24:16] the shock had to pull away it had to
[1:24:19] pull back
[1:24:20] it had to give way
[1:24:23] oh hallelujah they were a part of the
[1:24:25] process but they are not the seed
[1:24:28] it's seed time it's bright time
[1:24:31] it's manifesting time the same seed that
[1:24:34] went in the ground
[1:24:35] is the same seed that's come up it's not
[1:24:38] another seed
[1:24:39] it's the seed
[1:24:42] oh the life that i now live hallelujah
[1:24:48] the life that i now live i was watching
[1:24:52] i was watching a video you probably some
[1:24:55] of you that if you listen to music if
[1:24:57] you watch it
[1:24:58] on youtube you watch that there's
[1:25:01] there's a pentecostal group that sings
[1:25:03] waymaker i believe it's a pentecost of
[1:25:05] alexandria and you watch them you watch
[1:25:08] them and you see
[1:25:10] you see them in their worship and you if
[1:25:12] you go on you can see some of their
[1:25:14] some of the preachers and you would
[1:25:17] think if you'd watch some of that just
[1:25:19] for a moment
[1:25:19] you'd catch a glimpse that they were
[1:25:22] that close
[1:25:23] i was speaking uh brother the brothers
[1:25:25] this week and i was telling them
[1:25:28] you're watching they were right there
[1:25:32] they had it in their grips
[1:25:35] the father of pentecost
[1:25:38] let it slip away what for
[1:25:43] but you watch how powerful their
[1:25:45] ministries are
[1:25:46] sure they'll speak in tongues maybe more
[1:25:49] speaking more in tongues than what you
[1:25:51] do
[1:25:51] they may shout more than you two may
[1:25:53] they might even have a bigger hairdo
[1:25:55] than you do sisters
[1:25:57] they say higher the bun the closer you
[1:25:59] are to god
[1:26:01] but you watch them they can dance in the
[1:26:03] spirit and sure it's a true spirit of
[1:26:06] god
[1:26:06] because the rain falls on the just and
[1:26:10] the unjust
[1:26:11] but you watch when it comes down when it
[1:26:14] comes to the word test they'll always
[1:26:16] fail
[1:26:17] are you with me they will take
[1:26:19] pentecostal bait
[1:26:21] they'll take a sign and they'll take a
[1:26:23] wonder over what the word says
[1:26:25] but you let the bride see that she'll
[1:26:28] say it's nothing but the word for me
[1:26:30] but i'll take them signs and them
[1:26:32] wonders too
[1:26:35] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:40] we're not seeing in part
[1:26:44] is that right that's what paul would say
[1:26:46] when i was a child i spake as a child
[1:26:49] but when i became
[1:26:50] a man he didn't speak like a child no
[1:26:52] more
[1:26:53] he spoke like a man church of the living
[1:26:56] god
[1:26:57] you can be a man you can be a real
[1:27:00] man of god a real daughter of god and be
[1:27:04] a real man
[1:27:05] be a real believer remember where you
[1:27:08] came from
[1:27:13] you're watching you're watching
[1:27:17] if they ain't been with that if they
[1:27:18] ain't been with the male
[1:27:20] you can watch those little you can watch
[1:27:22] in springtime
[1:27:23] you can watch them little robins they
[1:27:25] begin to build their nest
[1:27:26] they'll go in there and they'll build
[1:27:28] their nest maybe you got like that
[1:27:30] little boy syndrome still inside of you
[1:27:32] and you'll climb a tree
[1:27:33] and you look in there and blue then blue
[1:27:36] eggs that are sitting there
[1:27:38] and you'll watch them mama rob and
[1:27:40] she'll come and sit on that nest
[1:27:42] and sit there and sit there and sit
[1:27:44] there
[1:27:45] and sometimes you'll see them little
[1:27:47] robins pop her head up
[1:27:49] but sometimes you can climb up in a tree
[1:27:52] i don't know
[1:27:53] anybody else done that i'm speaking as
[1:27:57] somebody else here
[1:28:01] but you climb up in there when you watch
[1:28:03] all them other little robins start
[1:28:04] flying away and you can climb up in
[1:28:06] there and you can look
[1:28:07] and then blue eggs still sitting there
[1:28:11] they sit there and sit there and that
[1:28:13] mama sits on them faithfully
[1:28:16] every day but because they had never
[1:28:19] been with a male
[1:28:20] are you with me he will never come to
[1:28:22] life just like a hen
[1:28:24] if she ain't never been with a rooster
[1:28:26] those eggs can sit right there
[1:28:28] they can sit right there and they can
[1:28:30] never produce anything
[1:28:31] but just an egg but like brother jules
[1:28:34] said i like eggs but i like the
[1:28:36] manifestation of the egg a whole lot
[1:28:37] better
[1:28:39] but you can see you can put that egg
[1:28:42] right up in there
[1:28:43] let me preach to you just a little bit
[1:28:46] you can put that egg in there
[1:28:48] oh ain't little susie just a fine
[1:28:50] looking egg
[1:28:51] she's got such a perfect rounded shape
[1:28:54] got a great nice eggshell of color about
[1:28:57] her
[1:28:57] and oh it's such strong got calcium in
[1:29:00] it
[1:29:00] and oh it's just so beautiful you can
[1:29:03] look like an egg
[1:29:04] you can even wobble like an egg but if
[1:29:06] you ain't been with a male
[1:29:08] it ain't coming to life
[1:29:11] i just preached to you hallelujah
[1:29:16] if you have not been with the male
[1:29:19] if you have not been with jesus you will
[1:29:22] not produce
