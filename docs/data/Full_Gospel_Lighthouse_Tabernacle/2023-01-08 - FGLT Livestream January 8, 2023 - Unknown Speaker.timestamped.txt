[42:03] verse 1 chapter 1 verse 3.
[42:07] this morning
[42:16] First Peter chapter 1
[42:18] and verse 3.
[42:23] and it says it like this says blessed be
[42:25] the God and Father our Lord Jesus Christ
[42:28] which according to His abundant Mercy
[42:32] hath begotten us unto the Lively Hope by
[42:36] the resurrection of Jesus Christ from

[43:26] more precious than of gold that perished

[44:03] love reading this word this morning Lord
[44:05] we ask you that you'll just bless us at
[44:07] this time
[44:08] Jesus name amen
[44:10] amen amen you can be seated this morning
[44:14] this morning I'd like to speak to you
[44:16] for a little bit on what we are built
[44:19] for
[44:20] what we're built for so I'd like to just
[44:23] go about it by telling you a dream that
[44:24] I had a couple years ago and in this
[44:27] dream I was speaking and as I was
[44:30] speaking I looked and about in the
[44:33] middle here I seen my teeny which is my
[44:35] my grandma dad's dad's mother she was
[44:38] sitting there and she was in a young
[44:40] body
[44:41] and she was sent in directly beside
[44:43] sister Craighead sister Craighead is the
[44:46] one that's known for writing the song My
[44:48] theophany
[44:49] and both of them in a young body
[44:52] and as I was sitting there looking at
[44:55] both of them I was speaking and I had a
[44:58] lug nut in my hand
[44:59] now I just you just think well what in
[45:02] the world is that
[45:03] but something said you're speaking what
[45:06] you're built for
[45:07] what you're built for now I thought what
[45:10] what a great time that it would become
[45:12] forth even right now that I would hold
[45:15] this until now what we're built for
[45:20] her Sweden being the songwriter of my
[45:23] theothony both of them sitting there in
[45:24] a young body
[45:26] and me speaking on a little lug nut what
[45:28] you're built for
[45:30] now this this is a lug nut if nobody
[45:32] knows what this is in the building here
[45:34] this evening
[45:35] this goes on to your vehicles holds the
[45:38] tires the rims there to the vehicle
[45:40] it's a small thing
[45:42] but it's a great thing
[45:45] the the way it's designed you can't just
[45:48] put any old little nut on it and you
[45:50] might think Matt you're a nut this
[45:52] morning
[45:53] you're right
[45:56] as granddaddy would say I'm screwed on
[45:58] the right Bolt
[46:00] amen
[46:08] so this lug nut is designed for a
[46:10] certain purpose and that purpose is to
[46:13] hold those wheels on a vehicle
[46:15] now
[46:16] it has to be tried
[46:18] it has to meet certain requirements
[46:21] it has to go through several tests
[46:24] and if there's one little just thing
[46:27] that's wrong it has to be placed through
[46:29] another fire
[46:30] it has to be sent back and formed to be
[46:33] perfected again
[46:34] so many times in our lives trials may
[46:37] come along
[46:38] and you go
[46:40] I don't know if I can handle that but
[46:41] God said
[46:42] this is what you're built for
[46:45] this is what I made you for
[46:46] amen
[46:48] so you're made for a purpose in this
[46:50] last day
[46:52] brother Brandon would say it like this
[46:53] said and we're expected to be tested and
[46:57] that's good lesson for my brother back
[46:58] there also he cometh to God must first
[47:02] be tested test it with the word that's
[47:05] God's test do you believe it he cometh
[47:08] to God and must be tested only that only
[47:12] shows a true child
[47:14] then C be tested and when the test comes
[47:17] you can't overcome unless there is tests
[47:20] given to you and when the test is given
[47:22] it's to see whether you can overcome or
[47:25] not and Jesus said to him that
[47:27] overcometh the test the test is the
[47:31] greatest thing that you'll ever happen
[47:32] to you
[47:33] believe it's written in the scripture
[47:34] Peter said that our trials are worth
[47:37] more
[47:38] to us than precious gold
[47:40] your trials are worth more to you than
[47:42] precious gold that's a testing time one
[47:46] good evidence to us that God is with us
[47:49] aren't you glad that he's with you when
[47:51] you're going through a test of Life the
[47:53] trials of life you can look back and say
[47:55] hey that's because God is with me with
[47:58] this he's put me through a test he's
[48:01] testing me in this last day
[48:04] this little lug nut
[48:06] it might not be much
[48:09] but it has to be hardened through it
[48:11] can't just be a surface hardening to
[48:14] where that if the service is broken it's
[48:16] corrupted but it has to be tried
[48:19] completely through that's the way these
[48:22] lug nuts are designed just this piece of
[48:25] metal right here but that's also the way
[48:27] you're designed you have to be tried
[48:29] completely through it can't just be some
[48:32] surface tension that's just there on the
[48:34] outside laying there and then when the
[48:36] Devil comes along puts a little crack in
[48:38] it and you're gone
[48:40] it it's just worthless after that but
[48:42] you're hardened through not hard enough
[48:45] heart to where you can't receive God but
[48:47] you're hardened through to the things of
[48:49] the world Amen we have trials as
[48:51] children children has little trials in
[48:54] the middle of the night they'll get up
[48:55] crying and just screaming and you think
[48:57] oh my Lord what in the Lord so you burp
[49:00] them you feed them you change their
[49:01] diapers diapers but they are going
[49:04] through a trial that they have to go
[49:05] through
[49:07] Charles is teenagers and then we look
[49:10] back at when we was teenagers and we go
[49:12] well that wasn't much of a trial but as
[49:15] a teenager it's a trial to you to get
[49:17] you where you need to be matured in the
[49:19] word amen trials as adults trials is
[49:23] elderly as we get older things come
[49:25] along and you go well I don't understand
[49:27] that didn't happen to me before why has
[49:30] that happening to me now that's a trial
[49:32] that you're going to have to go through
[49:33] to get you where you're going amen
[49:36] and that's recognizing what you've been
[49:39] through
[49:39] that has brought you to this point
[49:42] aren't you glad of that that you can see
[49:44] that that point in your life has brought
[49:47] me to this place at this moment in my
[49:50] life amen we're built for overcoming
[49:53] we're not built to fall at this that or
[49:55] the other anything that would come along
[49:57] like a reed shaking in the wind hey no
[50:00] we're built for this age at this time
[50:03] amen
[50:05] and brother Branham said it like this in
[50:07] Israel in the church and said we started
[50:09] off with Ephesus and ending up in layout
[50:11] I see you the lukewarm Church age where
[50:14] we are now see they have a form of
[50:16] godliness by denying the power thereof
[50:19] going to church having people come and
[50:21] saying just accept Christ just accept
[50:24] Christ put their name on a book but
[50:27] denying the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:29] and the power and miracles and the signs
[50:32] and wonders and making fun of it
[50:34] this is brother Brandon saying that in
[50:36] his age and now look at where at today
[50:38] people making fun of the baptism of the
[50:41] Holy Ghost saying that's for a Time past
[50:43] that ain't for you the Miracles ain't
[50:45] for you the Praises the shouting that
[50:47] ain't for you it's for a Time past no
[50:49] that's for me
[50:51] that is for me amen we're in that layout
[50:54] of CN age that lukewarmedness age that
[50:57] God said I'm going to spew you out of my
[50:58] mouth I don't even know you amen
[51:02] that is a trying time Hallelujah and I
[51:04] believe the elect is going to be taken
[51:06] up amen but see when those Trials come
[51:10] it forms you into exactly where you're
[51:12] supposed to fit correctly correctly be
[51:14] in place there now this little thing it
[51:17] can hold a lot of pressure but it can't
[51:19] do it by itself
[51:21] amen if you go to your car this this
[51:24] morning whatever you go out there and
[51:26] you might be able to look at it and you
[51:27] might say well there there's many on
[51:30] there well that's correct
[51:31] amen it's going to take all of us to go
[51:34] in a Rapture it's going to take every
[51:36] single one of you to go it's not just
[51:38] one of us holding on there might be four
[51:40] of them little lug nuts on that thing on
[51:42] one tire but you go to every single one
[51:45] of them and every single one of them is
[51:46] going to have four if you're missing one
[51:48] seek a deacon
[51:50] you need that amen you need that this
[51:54] morning
[51:55] but there are several that's on there
[51:57] little cars is going to have about four
[51:59] and you can't have no less than that
[52:01] because it's not going to work correctly
[52:03] it you see a tire and it's going down
[52:05] the road gets a little wobbly and you're
[52:07] like and you're following that vehicle
[52:09] and you're going oh man
[52:11] and that tire is just shaking like that
[52:13] and you're going well I'm going to pass
[52:14] this guy but I don't know if I should
[52:15] I'll slow down but that thing's just
[52:17] wobbling like that well there's an issue
[52:19] there
[52:21] and and you can see the issue but they
[52:24] might not even know it while they're
[52:25] driving you see some people and they're
[52:27] just going along and they don't even
[52:28] have a clue but that's the way it is
[52:30] even now
[52:32] you see people that's just going
[52:36] and you're going they have an issue but
[52:38] see we can see that
[52:40] and see and what happens is the word of
[52:42] God will come forth and he'll be able to
[52:45] just put that certain person in the
[52:46] right place at the right moment and God
[52:49] can come in with a power tool brother
[52:51] Mark Spencer he works on power tools and
[52:53] those power tools will come down
[52:56] certain pressures got to be presented at
[52:58] that point
[52:59] but you go Lord I don't want that
[53:01] pressure I don't want that in this life
[53:04] I do not want that it hurts so bad
[53:09] but that's what it takes that's what it
[53:11] takes the word of God coming forth amen
[53:13] the speaking of the message it's got to
[53:15] come forth to put you where you need to
[53:17] be in this last day amen he comes along
[53:20] with a torque wrench do you all know
[53:21] what a torque wrench is I'll explain it
[53:23] here a torque wrench applies certain
[53:24] amount of pressure and after it gets to
[53:27] that pressure it breaks it says that's
[53:29] exactly where it needs to be if you put
[53:33] too much pressure on something like that
[53:35] it will snap the metal inside
[53:37] but God knows exactly how much pressure
[53:40] that you're going to take
[53:42] amen God knows what you're going through
[53:46] God sees you and he says
[53:49] just a little bit and that breaker bar
[53:51] just
[53:52] he says he's right now
[53:53] it's perfect now
[53:55] and I believe that's exactly where we're
[53:57] at in this last day God's coming down
[54:00] and he's showing us things that we have
[54:01] never seen before amen we're feeling
[54:03] things we're seeing things Miracles

[54:28] come forth and said hey that one right
[54:30] there that one's perfectly fitted

[54:59] people just shouting and screaming

[55:37] were built for amen
[55:40] I thank the Lord for that this morning
[55:42] in job 23 and 10 it says but he knoweth
[55:46] the way that I take
[55:48] when he hath tried me I shall come forth
[55:51] as gold
[55:52] aren't you glad of that this morning
[55:54] when he has tried me I have come forth
[55:57] as gold oh what a pureness what a thing
[56:01] that we have men
[56:03] brother Branham would talk about the
[56:05] story of Hattie right and not to like to
[56:07] read some to to you this morning
[56:10] and it says when I was sitting at the
[56:12] table eating dinner and I had been
[56:15] explaining what faith was
[56:18] and sister Hattie Wright was sitting way
[56:20] back out there toward another room and
[56:22] she didn't have much to say never does
[56:25] and then while we were talking I'd say
[56:27] if the Lord showed me a vision and
[56:30] something was to take place then I could
[56:33] say that's it that's what raises my
[56:36] faith I said when the Lord shows me what
[56:39] will take place I have the confidence
[56:41] it's going to be that way
[56:44] when he showed me I said I'd come right
[56:48] here
[56:48] if the little reflected girl sitting
[56:50] there and the Lord had showed me that
[56:53] she was going to be healed I come right
[56:56] here and I'd stand on in track and see
[56:59] everything was just exactly the way he
[57:01] said and I'd then say thus saith the
[57:04] Lord either rise up and walk and I said
[57:08] you see those little legs unfold and the
[57:11] little hands unfold and she'd get up
[57:13] from there and walk up to Gloria to the
[57:16] glory of God I said if it would come to
[57:19] me like that see he was explaining
[57:21] raising their faith a little bit telling
[57:24] exactly how it would be
[57:26] and as it was sitting there and while we
[57:28] were talking I said I want to ask you
[57:31] something what put those squirrels there
[57:34] there's no squirrels in those woods I've
[57:36] been hunting and hunting and I'm not the
[57:38] best hunter but I've hunted since I was
[57:40] a little boy and I'd I'd hunt it's close
[57:43] and
[57:44] they're the most ridiculous Place
[57:46] ridiculous way I could call them I said
[57:49] what put them there
[57:52] and I said I wonder if it's that my
[57:55] Ministry is fixing to take another
[57:57] change that the god of Abraham is
[58:00] confirming his promise as he did to
[58:03] Abraham when he was up on the top of the
[58:05] mount and when he needed a sacrifice for
[58:08] instant of his son instead of his son
[58:11] Jehovah Jireh performed a miracle and
[58:14] the and he placed a ram a hundred miles
[58:17] back and their three days journey and an
[58:20] ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day and
[58:24] lift up his eyes and saw the mountain
[58:26] afar off and then went to the mountain
[58:28] and went up to the top of the mountain
[58:30] while the ram was back there a sheep
[58:33] wild animals would have killed it
[58:36] and then up on the top of that mountain
[58:37] where there's no water see he's
[58:39] explaining where he was at at this
[58:42] moment where Abraham was at
[58:45] how did that realm get there what
[58:47] happened God needed a sacrifice to prove
[58:50] to Abraham that he was Jehovah Jireh the
[58:53] very same God creation spoke that Ram
[58:56] into existence
[58:58] now it wasn't a vision he killed that
[59:00] right that realm the blood came out of
[59:03] that animal it wasn't a vision it was a
[59:06] ram and I said that same God hallelujah
[59:09] Jehovah Jireh he's just as much Jehovah
[59:12] Jireh today as he was with the mount on
[59:14] on Abraham with Abraham he can still
[59:17] produce an animal to his glory those
[59:20] squirrels was not just a vision I shot
[59:22] them blood came out of them I dressed
[59:25] them and I ate them they wasn't a vision
[59:28] they were squirrels and I said that same
[59:31] Jehovah Jireh trying to keep
[59:34] trying to get his promise over me
[59:37] in my thickness of my dullness of mind I
[59:40] could speak to my need into it I could
[59:43] speak my need into existence that same
[59:46] as he spoke Abraham's need into
[59:48] existence
[59:50] no more than I had said now I want you
[59:52] to listen to here now I said no more
[59:54] than I had said said that until sister
[59:57] Hattie sitting there crying now hadn't
[1:00:00] said a word and she said that's nothing
[1:00:02] but the truth
[1:00:05] see she said the right thing she said
[1:00:09] she said just look look Banks said down
[1:00:12] there I Heard a Voice see he brother
[1:00:16] Branham heard that same voice swept to
[1:00:19] my ears just like it was in the woods
[1:00:21] to speak those Scrolls into existence
[1:00:23] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:00:29] and the loaning came up on brother
[1:00:30] Branham and he said you tell Hattie that
[1:00:33] she's found Grace in the sight of God
[1:00:37] who would have thought tell tell her to
[1:00:40] ask whatever she will and then speak it
[1:00:43] by the gift of existence whatever she
[1:00:46] asks speak it into existence and I
[1:00:49] looked at to my sister first time
[1:00:52] as I ever performed on a human and I
[1:00:54] said sister Hattie
[1:00:57] ask what you will
[1:00:59] God is going to give it to you
[1:01:01] God's going to give it to you this
[1:01:03] morning you just say that's exactly the
[1:01:05] truth this morning
[1:01:07] God's going to give it to you and what
[1:01:10] do you think of that does it does it get
[1:01:12] into you seven times and he had
[1:01:15] confirmed it by the animal seven is
[1:01:17] God's completed number here is the time
[1:01:20] the first time on a human
[1:01:23] on a human being and when he did
[1:01:26] he chose he didn't excuse me and he
[1:01:31] what did he choose some great
[1:01:37] some great noted Minister a poor little
[1:01:40] widow woman that could hardly write her
[1:01:42] name God knows what he's doing
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:47] ask what you will had he said brother
[1:01:49] Branham what do you mean and I said ask
[1:01:52] anything your heart's desire
[1:01:54] and it shall be produced right here
[1:01:57] and you'll know the Lord the god of
[1:02:00] Heaven answers his scriptures are true
[1:02:02] and my first time with the with the new
[1:02:04] gift my first anointing I could hardly
[1:02:07] hear
[1:02:08] and she looked around
[1:02:10] and went and had been talking
[1:02:13] about her little crippled sister
[1:02:16] and I said oh he was thinking oh
[1:02:18] doubting my in his in his heart
[1:02:21] within a few minutes little Edith will
[1:02:24] be jumping up giving God the glory
[1:02:26] little Hattie looked around all over and
[1:02:29] she said brother Bill the greatest
[1:02:32] desire is for the Salvation of my two
[1:02:35] boys
[1:02:35] what the greatest desire
[1:02:39] is the Salvation of my two boys
[1:02:43] she was built for that moment
[1:02:46] brother Branham says it after this right
[1:02:48] after he says that it says while there
[1:02:50] couldn't have been a greater thing
[1:02:53] she could have asked for thousands of
[1:02:55] dollars
[1:02:56] she would have gotten it what if it had
[1:02:58] been millions of them she could have
[1:03:00] been a millionaire she could ask for
[1:03:02] another million God knew what she was
[1:03:04] going to ask for
[1:03:06] God knew where she'd be placed at that
[1:03:08] right moment at that right time what she
[1:03:10] was going to ask for the Salvation of
[1:03:12] her two boys
[1:03:14] that's what she was designed for at that
[1:03:16] moment in that hour
[1:03:18] he didn't just play somebody that would
[1:03:19] ask for wealth at that moment he didn't
[1:03:21] ask somebody that would just ask for
[1:03:23] just a a miracle yes it would have been
[1:03:25] a great thing but many people have seen
[1:03:27] Miracles but what's going to last is the
[1:03:30] Salvation of her two boys as he said as
[1:03:32] before there's going to be two boys I

[1:04:31] salvation of our souls this morning

[1:04:41] praise the Lord for I am fearfully and
[1:04:44] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[1:04:47] that my soul knoweth the right way

[1:30:15] and we didn't know what the evening's
[1:30:17] events was going to be like and and so I
[1:30:20] sat down with her and and the worship
[1:30:23] was going on and I just sat down and
[1:30:25] talked to her
[1:30:26] what I was really doing was picking up
[1:30:28] the spirit and
[1:30:30] and I said you know Abigail means one of
[1:30:32] this most brilliant women in the Bible
[1:30:35] smartest women she became David's
[1:30:37] counselor and she'll probably be
[1:30:40] Reuben's counselor through the life and
[1:30:42] so
[1:30:43] and and I just told her I said now that
[1:30:45] baby everything is going to be all right
[1:30:48] they would go home and then then her
[1:30:51] blood pressure would spike and those
[1:30:53] things and cause a little anxiety but
[1:30:56] Miss Ellie Grace came and perfectly well
[1:30:58] and so we thank the Lord for that give
[1:31:01] the Lord a good hand for them
[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:10] today we want to announce
[1:31:12] congratulations
[1:31:14] to brother Gabriel and Sister Sarah
[1:31:18] they had an ultrasound this week and
[1:31:20] they have a healthy baby on the way
[1:31:24] [Applause]

[1:31:53] those that got baptized last night

[1:32:01] and and we are so thankful amen

[1:32:16] turns

[1:32:30] so love you with all of our hearts last
[1:32:33] night is the worship was going on
[1:32:35] I look back and saw sister Zoe
[1:32:38] she was shouting and
[1:32:41] and Andrew was singing and and she was
[1:32:45] just rowing backwards and forwards and
[1:32:47] her head laid back and her eyes closed
[1:32:50] and
[1:32:50] she was just shouting you know you know
[1:32:53] there may be some dead hits in this
[1:32:55] message but boy these children really
[1:32:57] like it so
[1:32:59] [Applause]
[1:33:09] amen so we love you amen
[1:33:12] amen we love you with all of our hearts
[1:33:14] and so
[1:33:16] this morning I I just have on my heart
[1:33:18] and I've had it for a few weeks and I
[1:33:20] just want to speak to you today and this
[1:33:23] will be kind of real close to me and
[1:33:25] I try not to get too emotional to it but
[1:33:28] the Lord just dropped in my heart and I
[1:33:31] I would say about four weeks ago
[1:33:34] On fight to live
[1:33:38] 15 years ago I laid in a coma
[1:33:43] and
[1:33:45] it was there that I would hear these
[1:33:48] words for the first time when they were
[1:33:50] taking me off of life support
[1:33:53] and a nurse was screaming in my ear
[1:33:57] and this will mean something to you she
[1:34:00] was screaming in my ear
[1:34:02] fight to live
[1:34:04] fight to live
[1:34:06] only you Ron can fight for your life now
[1:34:10] fight to live
[1:34:12] they were taking me off of the life
[1:34:14] support that it had me on almost a month
[1:34:17] and now it's one of the most treacherous
[1:34:20] times of coming off of the life support
[1:34:22] now to try to live on your own and she
[1:34:25] was screaming in my ear no doubt she had
[1:34:27] did that many times to to many different
[1:34:30] ones but today was my turn
[1:34:33] and as I thought
[1:34:35] you see there were times that in that
[1:34:37] induced coma to where that they would
[1:34:40] allow me to come up so far till they
[1:34:42] could measure how I was doing
[1:34:45] what my reactions was like and it was in
[1:34:49] one of those times to win that I was up
[1:34:51] just enough to be somewhat
[1:34:53] semi-conscious that I looked through the
[1:34:55] glass and their sister Connie and she
[1:34:58] had such a
[1:35:03] a look on her face
[1:35:16] hey one more time wanted to tell her I
[1:35:18] loved her
[1:35:24] I just wanted one more day with my
[1:35:26] family
[1:35:41] a couple of months ago while preparing
[1:35:44] for a test they were going to put me to
[1:35:46] sleep
[1:35:52] a lot of doctors and nurses around me
[1:35:54] and
[1:35:55] biopsies were going to happen
[1:36:01] and I heard the
[1:36:03] I heard the doctor tell the others said
[1:36:06] I must be losing my touch
[1:36:08] I can't make him go to sleep
[1:36:16] foreign
[1:36:29] and she said Ron you're going to be okay
[1:36:32] you're gonna be okay you're in good
[1:36:34] hands
[1:36:36] and she said
[1:36:41] what makes you relax the most
[1:36:46] what do you enjoy doing
[1:36:49] I said I enjoy spending time with my
[1:36:51] family
[1:36:54] I enjoy spitting it down with my friends
[1:37:00] and I heard her say good night Ron
[1:37:12] this morning has been a difficult
[1:37:13] morning
[1:37:15] foreign
[1:37:18] extremely difficult
[1:37:23] maybe it's supposed to be that way
[1:37:28] but I want you to know something I'm
[1:37:30] fighting
[1:37:36] maybe our young people don't understand
[1:37:38] what it's like to fight for life
[1:37:43] life is so precious
[1:37:48] sorry to be emotional
[1:37:51] it's so precious I took for granted life
[1:37:55] for so long
[1:37:59] Heaven's going to be a wonderful place
[1:38:03] many of our friends are already there
[1:38:07] I can't fathom what it's going to be
[1:38:09] like and I can't thousands of friends
[1:38:11] that'll come
[1:38:13] to shake my hand and tell me welcome
[1:38:15] home
[1:38:18] but I'd like for that to be a long way
[1:38:20] away
[1:38:23] and I want to spend every day that I
[1:38:25] have with you
[1:38:28] thank you to all the friends around the
[1:38:30] world
[1:38:31] that pray for me
[1:38:33] this week I've got some very difficult
[1:38:35] tests to take and the next week I've got
[1:38:38] scans to go through
[1:38:42] we made a choice
[1:38:44] in our early Journey
[1:38:47] to have extension of life
[1:38:51] and I thank God for every moment that
[1:38:54] I've had
[1:38:57] thank God for that
[1:38:59] I'd like to turn that to a spiritual
[1:39:01] Realm
[1:39:04] as the Bride of Jesus Christ is fighting
[1:39:07] in this darkness of laodicea
[1:39:15] it seems like there's a spiritual
[1:39:17] abortion that's happening not only in
[1:39:19] the church but in the bride
[1:39:21] or they no longer want the moving of the
[1:39:24] spirit
[1:39:26] no longer want that Holy Ghost Revival
[1:39:30] but they want to polish and Hollywood
[1:39:33] dies
[1:39:34] an
[1:39:35] intellectualizing
[1:39:37] explain the message away
[1:39:40] to where that it's it's digestible
[1:39:45] it happened in the early church where
[1:39:47] that
[1:39:48] that slaves had the Holy Ghost but now
[1:39:51] doctors and lawyers and and I don't mean
[1:39:54] no way for our lawyers sitting here to
[1:39:57] make it look bad to you but they they
[1:39:59] wanted to make it to where it would be
[1:40:01] polished to where that that the class of
[1:40:04] society would feel welcome in their
[1:40:06] churches
[1:40:08] but in bringing in the world you take
[1:40:10] God out of it
[1:40:14] let me just say you'll have to fight for
[1:40:16] life
[1:40:18] and as I brought myself into it whether
[1:40:21] you realize it or not to come to service
[1:40:23] and enjoy these Services the way you do
[1:40:25] you'll have to fight for life
[1:40:30] now there's a nation called Israel
[1:40:33] she can't afford to lose one day
[1:40:38] she can't she can't afford to lose one
[1:40:41] war
[1:40:42] her boundaries are set they negotiate
[1:40:46] and seems like the whole world is
[1:40:48] against her but she's actually the
[1:40:51] strongest army in the entire world
[1:40:55] because God is on her side
[1:40:58] not that she is strong with her own with
[1:41:01] her own self but God has made a choice
[1:41:05] and chose her
[1:41:07] God not only chose Israel but he chose
[1:41:10] this bride
[1:41:12] and he refuses to lose your War
[1:41:16] yeah
[1:41:19] he'll not lose a one
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:26] he'll not lose a one
[1:41:31] so our boundaries are clear
[1:41:34] this message stands sure
[1:41:37] this message is real
[1:41:40] this message was more than a man called
[1:41:42] William Branham
[1:41:45] it was not his message and he made it
[1:41:48] clear to us you're not feeding on the
[1:41:50] mind of a man
[1:41:52] but you're feeding on the body word of
[1:41:54] the son of man
[1:41:57] and so with that we stand to our feet
[1:42:00] and and I've worked my way through my
[1:42:02] nervousness and the battle that I'm
[1:42:05] fighting with my own eyes and so so we
[1:42:09] thank you we thank you for your patience
[1:42:11] and I may take more than my 25 minutes
[1:42:14] if that's okay
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:22] I went back and talked to brother Joel
[1:42:24] before service and
[1:42:27] I told him I said I make I break all the
[1:42:29] rules so you know
[1:42:31] amen
[1:42:33] in Psalms chapter 42 and verse 1 this is
[1:42:36] a very familiar portion of scripture
[1:42:39] Psalms 42 and verse 1.
[1:42:44] as a heart panteth for the water Brooks
[1:42:47] after the water Brooks
[1:42:49] so Panther my soul after thee o God
[1:42:53] my soul thirsteth for God for the Living
[1:42:56] God
[1:42:57] When shall I come and appear before God
[1:43:00] my tears have been my meat day and night
[1:43:03] while they continually say unto me where
[1:43:07] is thy God when I remember these things
[1:43:10] I pour out my soul in in me for I am had
[1:43:15] gone with the multitude I went with them
[1:43:18] to the house of God with the voice of
[1:43:21] joy and praise with a multitude that
[1:43:25] kept holy day where thou cast down O my
[1:43:29] soul and wire thou disquieting in me
[1:43:32] hold thou and God for I shall yet praise
[1:43:36] him for the help of his countenance oh
[1:43:40] my God my soul is cast down Within Me
[1:43:43] therefore will I remember thee from the
[1:43:46] land of Jordan and or hermitite and and
[1:43:49] the hill of mizar deep calleth unto the
[1:43:53] Deep at the noise of thy water spouts
[1:43:56] all thy way waves thy and thy billas are
[1:44:00] gone over before me yet the Lord will
[1:44:02] command his loving kindness in the
[1:44:04] daytime and then the night his song
[1:44:07] shall be with me and my prayer unto God
[1:44:10] of my life I will say unto God my rock
[1:44:15] I thought thought of William when you
[1:44:17] were saying that last night where we
[1:44:19] were going this morning why hast thou
[1:44:21] forgotten me
[1:44:23] why go I mourning because of the
[1:44:26] oppression of my enemy as with a sword
[1:44:30] in my bones mine enemies reproach me
[1:44:33] while they say daily unto me where is
[1:44:38] thy God Amen you can be seated
[1:44:49] let me just make some adjustments here
[1:44:51] real quickly
[1:44:52] amen
[1:44:55] amen
[1:45:04] Isaiah chapter 43 and verse 1.
[1:45:07] but now thus saith the Lord that create
[1:45:10] Theo Jacob
[1:45:12] and he that formed the O Israel fear not
[1:45:16] ice these words
[1:45:18] for I have redeemed thee
[1:45:20] I like that
[1:45:22] I have called thee by thy name
[1:45:25] Thou Art mine
[1:45:30] Whitney this is your your picture on my
[1:45:32] wall
[1:45:33] when thou past us through others I will
[1:45:36] be with thee and through the rivers they
[1:45:39] shall not overflow thee when thou
[1:45:42] walkest through the fire they shall not
[1:45:44] be burned neither shall the flame Kindle
[1:45:47] upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the
[1:45:51] Holy One of Israel thy savior I gave
[1:45:54] Egypt for thy Ransom Ethiopian seba for
[1:45:57] thee since thou was precious in my sight
[1:46:00] thou has been honorable and I have loved
[1:46:03] thee therefore will I give men for thee
[1:46:06] and people for thy life fear not I am
[1:46:10] with thee
[1:46:12] it's quite a statement isn't it I will
[1:46:14] bring thy seed from the East and gather
[1:46:16] thee from the West I will say to the
[1:46:19] north give up and to the South keep not
[1:46:21] back bring my sons from the foreign
[1:46:24] daughters from the ends of the Earth
[1:46:27] even every one that is called by my name
[1:46:31] for I have created him for my glory I
[1:46:35] have formed him yea I have made him
[1:46:38] bring forth the blind people that have
[1:46:41] eyes and death that have ears let all
[1:46:44] the nations be gathered together let the
[1:46:47] people be assembled
[1:46:50] whom who among them can declare this and
[1:46:55] show us former things let them bring
[1:46:57] forth as for their witness that they may
[1:47:00] be justified or let them hear and say it
[1:47:03] is truth ye are my Witnesses saith the
[1:47:07] Lord and my servant whom I have chosen
[1:47:10] that ye may know and believe me and
[1:47:13] understand that I am hate
[1:47:16] before me there is no God formed neither
[1:47:20] shall there be after me I even I am the
[1:47:25] Lord and beside me there is no savior
[1:47:31] Paul would write it like this in First
[1:47:34] Corinthians chapter 15 behold I show you
[1:47:37] a mystery we shall not all sleep
[1:47:40] but we shall be changed in a moment in
[1:47:44] the twinkle of an eye at the last Trump
[1:47:46] for the trumpet shall sound
[1:47:49] and the dead shall be raised
[1:47:51] incorruptable and we shall be changed
[1:47:54] and this corruptable must put on
[1:47:57] incorruption and this Mortal shall put
[1:47:59] on immortality so when this corruptable
[1:48:02] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:48:05] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:48:07] then shall be brought to pass the sand
[1:48:10] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:48:13] Victory
[1:48:15] oh death where is thy stink
[1:48:19] oh grave where is thy victory
[1:48:22] The Sting of death is sin and the
[1:48:25] strength of sin is the law
[1:48:28] brother Branham said he wrote those
[1:48:30] words while they were sharpening
[1:48:34] the acts that would cut his head off
[1:48:39] Hallelujah
[1:48:40] what a powerful what a powerful words
[1:48:45] I've always found that this was an
[1:48:47] incredible statement brother Branham
[1:48:49] makes
[1:48:50] standing where brother Branham stood and
[1:48:52] fellowshipping with the angels
[1:48:56] he said if I should take a trip tonight
[1:49:00] and go up into heaven and to meet with
[1:49:02] Father Abraham and I'd say Abraham
[1:49:05] what is the most glorious thing that you
[1:49:07] have ever known
[1:49:09] what is the most essential thing that
[1:49:11] you have ever known
[1:49:13] and Abraham would say to me life
[1:49:18] eternal
[1:49:19] and then I'll take a little trip and we
[1:49:22] go again and we'd go up to the great
[1:49:24] Archangel Gabriel who is the messenger
[1:49:27] of the Covenant to the Israel the Jewish
[1:49:29] people who stands at the right hand of
[1:49:31] God one of the highest order of Angels
[1:49:34] in the heavens and they would say to him
[1:49:36] Gabriel Thou Art the mighty Angel who
[1:49:39] art loved of God
[1:49:42] and you've been here for eons of time
[1:49:44] and you perhaps know everything in the
[1:49:46] heavens and where everything is placed
[1:49:49] because you're the one of God's
[1:49:51] right-hand angels and you know the great
[1:49:54] secrets of heaven and you sounded the
[1:49:56] trumpet at the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:59] and you announced the first coming
[1:50:01] and you shall announce the second coming
[1:50:05] and so you must be a mighty man or a
[1:50:09] mighty angel I want to ask you
[1:50:13] you in all of God's Great Treasures
[1:50:18] what is the greatest thing that you have
[1:50:21] found among his treasures
[1:50:24] and I can see Gabriel bring himself to
[1:50:27] attention and say the greatest thing
[1:50:30] that I have found in great in God's
[1:50:33] Treasures
[1:50:34] since he created me
[1:50:37] is life
[1:50:40] God made me to live for eternal
[1:50:44] for eternity
[1:50:47] life
[1:50:48] is the greatest thing that there is
[1:50:53] no matter how rich you might be
[1:50:57] no matter how popular you might be
[1:51:01] no matter who you might be
[1:51:04] the greatest thing that any man can
[1:51:07] achieve on this Earth
[1:51:10] is to achieve
[1:51:12] eternal life
[1:51:15] you might be a king
[1:51:17] a potentate
[1:51:19] though you rule the world for a million
[1:51:23] years
[1:51:25] as a king
[1:51:26] as a young man and you fail to find
[1:51:29] eternal life
[1:51:31] you've lost the greatest thing
[1:51:35] that anyone
[1:51:37] can lose
[1:51:42] I've often said if I be a young man 25
[1:51:45] years old
[1:51:46] if God would appear on the platform
[1:51:48] tonight and say I will turn you to a 25
[1:51:51] years old age and Daryl you'll remain
[1:51:55] for a million years
[1:51:57] and I'll make you King over all the
[1:51:59] universe
[1:52:00] everything will be at your command
[1:52:03] and I'll give you a hundred years of
[1:52:05] maybe or I'll give you a hundred years
[1:52:07] of misery and woe and trouble and sorrow
[1:52:12] and at the end of the Hundred Years I'll
[1:52:14] give you
[1:52:16] eternal life
[1:52:21] but at the end of a million years
[1:52:24] you'll be lost
[1:52:28] listen to his response
[1:52:31] I'd say Lord God I don't have to wait
[1:52:34] any longer to make the choice
[1:52:38] let me have that hundred years of misery
[1:52:40] and woe
[1:52:42] any kind of a death that you choose for
[1:52:45] me to die only Lord give me eternal life
[1:52:50] for though I own the whole world and and
[1:52:53] as a king for a million years and at the
[1:52:55] end of that million years become a
[1:52:57] hell-bound creature
[1:53:00] but no matter how bad my lot is here on
[1:53:03] Earth
[1:53:06] if I've got eternal life
[1:53:10] I'll live on you in your blessed
[1:53:12] presence forever
[1:53:15] and forever
[1:53:18] I pray that my grandchildren know this
[1:53:21] eternal life
[1:53:27] so many times we find life is
[1:53:29] difficult at its best
[1:53:33] we realize that there's no Miracles
[1:53:35] without messes
[1:53:39] Sarah endured
[1:53:42] 90 plus years
[1:53:44] the frustrating
[1:53:47] embarrassment of being barren
[1:53:51] it was a care it was a almost a curse in
[1:53:54] the world
[1:53:56] but there came a miracle
[1:54:00] there came a miracle by her way
[1:54:03] and that Miracle Oscar is there anything
[1:54:08] too hard for the Lord
[1:54:11] what and you know she even questioned
[1:54:15] and laughed for me an old woman
[1:54:18] how can I have pleasure again with my
[1:54:21] Lord Brother Branham talks about that
[1:54:24] how it would be
[1:54:26] for this modern Church world
[1:54:29] to go back to those Holy Ghost Field
[1:54:31] meetings of worshiping and speaking in
[1:54:35] tongues and the supernatural to be among
[1:54:38] us
[1:54:40] I'll read some of that in just a moment
[1:54:42] Isaac endured shattering through the
[1:54:45] through the darkness of night of
[1:54:48] blindness
[1:54:50] and it was because that God had to Blind
[1:54:53] him
[1:54:55] because Jacob he would have never chosen
[1:54:59] he would have chosen Esau over Jacob
[1:55:03] many many times
[1:55:05] but God had to Blind him
[1:55:08] so the blindness was a miracle for all
[1:55:12] of Israel
[1:55:14] there was a widow in her son that was
[1:55:17] starving to death
[1:55:18] just before dying God's sin Elijah to
[1:55:24] her place and ask her for her life
[1:55:27] sometimes he's asking for our life man
[1:55:30] called Shadrach Meshach and Abednego we
[1:55:34] know those names by heart since we were
[1:55:37] children but we would not know them had
[1:55:39] they have never stepped to info to a
[1:55:41] fiery furnace
[1:55:43] but before they stepped there there was
[1:55:46] a miracle of overcoming encouragement
[1:55:48] that was in their heart
[1:55:51] they knew their God if they die today
[1:55:54] they knew their God had the power to
[1:55:57] raise them back up again
[1:56:01] Bartimaeus experienced a lifetime of
[1:56:04] blindness
[1:56:05] being led to a gate
[1:56:07] experiencing a lot of things
[1:56:10] but one day Jesus came by his way
[1:56:14] from that day forward he was not the
[1:56:16] blind man anymore
[1:56:18] Legion was in tombs naked alienated from
[1:56:22] society and his family but Jesus came by
[1:56:25] his way from that day he was no longer
[1:56:28] called Legion anymore
[1:56:31] Lazarus was dead in a tomb had it been
[1:56:35] there seemed like Jesus had went away
[1:56:37] but when Jesus came by
[1:56:40] he became the Man known
[1:56:44] for the man that raised up out of the
[1:56:46] Grave because Jesus came and called him
[1:56:50] back to life again
[1:56:52] Daniel had been thrown into a lion's den
[1:56:55] and then that Lion's Den Angels stood by
[1:56:59] his side those same lines would later
[1:57:02] eat up his accusers but those same lines
[1:57:05] laid down and he enjoyed the night
[1:57:10] a kingdom was shaken but he enjoyed the
[1:57:14] night
[1:57:16] and the King came the next morning
[1:57:20] calling to his friend
[1:57:24] Hallelujah
[1:57:25] and he had a testimony that our God
[1:57:28] lives
[1:57:30] I have a testimony today
[1:57:36] there was a day they said I'd never walk
[1:57:39] again
[1:57:40] but I'm standing today there was a day
[1:57:44] they said my lungs would never function
[1:57:46] again but they function today there will
[1:57:50] be a day
[1:57:57] that I'll Stand and say I'm cancer-free
[1:57:59] when they said I'd never lived but four
[1:58:02] months
[1:58:05] there will be a day that I can stand and
[1:58:08] say cancer no longer holds me bound any
[1:58:12] longer
[1:58:23] you say brother on that's a pretty bold
[1:58:25] statement I gotta I got a quote for you
[1:58:28] he said Satan cannot take your life
[1:58:30] until God has finished with you
[1:58:34] there is nothing can happen to you
[1:58:36] unless God permits it there's no evil
[1:58:39] can come until God permits it and it's
[1:58:42] for your good
[1:58:49] in Acts chapter 3 and verse 1 and now
[1:58:52] Peter and John went up to the temple to
[1:58:54] The Hour of Prayer and it was the ninth
[1:58:56] hour
[1:58:57] and a certain man lame from his mother's
[1:58:59] womb was carried whom they had laid
[1:59:02] there at Daily at the temple which was
[1:59:04] called Beautiful to ask Toms of him who
[1:59:07] had entered into the temple who jesusi
[1:59:11] and Peter and John about to go into the
[1:59:13] temple ask in the arms and Peter
[1:59:16] fastened his eyes upon him and with John
[1:59:18] said look on us
[1:59:20] and he gave heed unto them and expecting
[1:59:22] to receive something from them and Peter
[1:59:25] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:59:28] such as I have give I Thee in the name
[1:59:31] of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and
[1:59:35] walk
[1:59:38] brother Graham said and when they passed
[1:59:40] through that date called Beautiful their
[1:59:42] laid a man the Holy Ghost said Peter
[1:59:44] that that that that man can be healed
[1:59:47] he's got faith and when he perceived
[1:59:49] he's had Faith to be healed he said
[1:59:51] stand upon your feet and he picked him
[1:59:54] up and held him till his ankle Bose
[1:59:55] receive strength and the way he went
[1:59:58] leaping and jumping and praising God
[2:00:01] you know what that caused more trouble
[2:00:03] than all the preaching that they ever
[2:00:04] did do brother let me just tell you that
[2:00:07] the on the phenomenal side to start
[2:00:09] watch how every Rogue and Hound in hell
[2:00:12] will go hollering at him craving blood
[2:00:15] I'll tell you Peter preached the on the
[2:00:18] sermon on the day of Pentecost three
[2:00:20] thousand Souls were saved the never
[2:00:22] leave the devil never even moved out of
[2:00:24] his bed
[2:00:26] said oh well just let him alone but when
[2:00:28] he passed through the date of beautiful
[2:00:30] the next day it healed a man crippled
[2:00:33] from his mother's womb and all hell
[2:00:35] turned loose on him
[2:00:37] throwed him in jail and kept him there
[2:00:40] overnight put him into a prison in the
[2:00:42] Inner Cell because of the phenomena the
[2:00:44] devil said I can't let this thing get
[2:00:47] started now Divine Healing if they do
[2:00:49] that they'll knock the props out from
[2:00:52] under me
[2:00:53] cause I might be fooled them around with
[2:00:56] a little theology once in a while but I
[2:00:59] can't fool them with that real thing
[2:01:01] [Applause]
[2:01:06] and the people will see it was done I'll
[2:01:08] just stop this before they ever gets the
[2:01:10] group started he never stopped it then
[2:01:14] he can't stop it now
[2:01:17] God's gospel will move on and on and on
[2:01:20] and on and when there is no more heavens
[2:01:22] and no more Earth that word will still
[2:01:25] remain the same for heavens and earth
[2:01:30] will pass away but my words will never
[2:01:32] pass away
[2:01:33] it can't pass away but this words is
[2:01:37] Heath mortal as God himself he can't
[2:01:40] pass away and I believe every word of it
[2:01:43] all things that Jesus was he is now
[2:01:48] and he always will be
[2:01:51] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:01:55] forever
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:02:02] the same holy ghost that fell on the day
[2:02:04] of Pentecost
[2:02:05] it's the same Holy Ghost today
[2:02:09] I'll admit it's been trampled on and
[2:02:11] made fun of and misinterpreted and
[2:02:13] misrepresented and everything like that
[2:02:15] that's only the devil trying to
[2:02:17] counterfeit it but there is a real
[2:02:20] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:22] that'll bring the same results as it did
[2:02:25] on the day of Pentecost sure the devil's
[2:02:28] got old crave crowbates out there I'll
[2:02:30] tell you the truth every time you see a
[2:02:32] scarecrow remember there's something
[2:02:34] good around it
[2:02:37] you don't see a scarecrow on Old
[2:02:40] pineapples
[2:02:42] hedge apples
[2:02:45] you get under the big tree sweet trees
[2:02:47] it's where you see a script crew because
[2:02:50] they're wanting to scare us away the
[2:02:53] devil sticks out at every scarecrow real
[2:02:55] good Holy Ghost religion that he can to
[2:02:58] put it around it because right in there
[2:03:01] Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God
[2:03:04] with his Immortal power he's still the
[2:03:07] same yesterday today and forever
[2:03:14] amen
[2:03:17] that means so be it
[2:03:23] right
[2:03:26] I'm just skipping
[2:03:42] as a little rabbit
[2:03:45] the story of the hounds
[2:03:48] was right behind him
[2:03:51] he could fill their hot breath
[2:03:54] upon his feet
[2:03:57] just a little while maybe another jump
[2:03:59] or two and the Hound was going to get
[2:04:01] that little fella
[2:04:03] and he would be godled up just in a
[2:04:05] moment
[2:04:07] but after a bit he saw the hole in the
[2:04:09] rock
[2:04:11] he thought if I could only get into that
[2:04:13] hole
[2:04:15] in the Rock I'll be safe
[2:04:18] and just as that dog made the last leap
[2:04:21] that last jump at him he could feel his
[2:04:25] hot breath on his heel
[2:04:27] but he run into that rock
[2:04:31] then it could set down there and let off
[2:04:34] the pressure
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:41] that devil can scratch that Hound can
[2:04:44] scratch but it can't stretch through
[2:04:47] that rock
[2:04:49] when you see a man struggling to live
[2:04:53] there's somebody in the hospital or in a
[2:04:56] sick man or an accident or struggling
[2:04:58] the death rattle in their throat pulling
[2:05:00] and crying and screaming for Life what
[2:05:02] does it mean
[2:05:03] that there's a place somewhere
[2:05:07] there's a body that doesn't struggle and
[2:05:10] scream for that
[2:05:14] they're temporal gifts to us
[2:05:17] these are only expressing that there is
[2:05:20] one that
[2:05:21] that is eternal one
[2:05:24] that's what Jesus has gone away to
[2:05:26] prepare
[2:05:28] the Eternal one for us
[2:05:32] you know in your natural life you get
[2:05:34] married
[2:05:37] you have a new home
[2:05:40] but in a few days she'll go
[2:05:42] you know those walls I'd like for them
[2:05:45] to be a different color
[2:05:49] you just built that house
[2:05:51] and you'll think well
[2:05:54] I thought it was good but it was good
[2:05:56] for that day
[2:05:59] but now a few years later they've been
[2:06:02] look it looked better a different color
[2:06:05] so you paint it now if you live long
[2:06:08] enough
[2:06:10] she'll take pictures down off of the
[2:06:12] wall and she'll hang new pictures there
[2:06:15] be new flowers there
[2:06:18] and then a little while she'd say you
[2:06:19] know it's time to change the color of
[2:06:21] that wall
[2:06:24] it's just the seasons of life
[2:06:28] now you see Jesus knows when he went
[2:06:31] away to prepare a place for us
[2:06:35] he knew what you would like
[2:06:38] in your Eternal Realm
[2:06:42] and the amazing thing is you you'll like
[2:06:44] it for eternity
[2:06:47] because you don't really know what you
[2:06:50] like
[2:06:56] you really don't know what you'll like
[2:06:58] but he's prepared you a home that will
[2:07:01] be satisfactory throughout
[2:07:04] eternity
[2:07:06] Hallelujah
[2:07:07] [Applause]
[2:07:09] [Music]
[2:07:15] now
[2:07:17] today they are they've just discovered
[2:07:20] this last week
[2:07:22] that
[2:07:24] they discovered the pool where Jesus
[2:07:27] healed that man
[2:07:30] God always knew it was there
[2:07:33] but due to uncovering and Excavating
[2:07:36] and looking
[2:07:38] they found that place
[2:07:40] that's kind of like the message
[2:07:44] the seals were there
[2:07:47] but God blinded it from all of those
[2:07:50] schools
[2:07:52] and theologians and he had it laying
[2:07:56] there all the time
[2:07:58] and they tried to explain which one was
[2:08:00] the horse rider and and what the colors
[2:08:03] meant and and they did everything that
[2:08:06] they could to try to explain it but when
[2:08:09] the author himself
[2:08:12] met the messenger in Arizona and told
[2:08:16] him to go back east
[2:08:21] now you can try to explain that event
[2:08:23] away but there's been a lot of men stood
[2:08:25] right there on the same ground but they
[2:08:27] never came back east and opened the
[2:08:30] Bible
[2:08:34] but this messenger it was not him
[2:08:39] he was just the vessel
[2:08:42] and the author of the book
[2:08:45] wanted to give it to you
[2:08:49] not just any church but he wanted to
[2:08:52] give it to you
[2:08:54] now for a long time we preached God sent
[2:08:57] a prophet because that was the message
[2:09:00] of the day because we must identify that
[2:09:03] God had sent a prophet
[2:09:05] and we preached you know how we got to
[2:09:08] dress and how we got to do all that
[2:09:09] because we really needed the Holy Ghost
[2:09:12] and once you get the Holy Ghost you'll
[2:09:14] dress right
[2:09:16] all right
[2:09:19] and once you get the Holy Ghost you'll
[2:09:22] you'll only do the things where Jesus
[2:09:24] want to be at anyway
[2:09:27] you won't have to be beat no longer once
[2:09:29] you really get married to Jesus you
[2:09:32] won't want to disappoint him or make him
[2:09:34] ashamed
[2:09:36] but Allah he's are wanted to tell us
[2:09:38] some things about Isaac
[2:09:41] and he wasn't falling in love with
[2:09:43] elohiser we were falling in love with
[2:09:46] Isaac oh we're going to see Jesus
[2:09:51] and sure we'll love his appearing and we
[2:09:54] love his presence when he comes here but
[2:09:56] there comes a day one of these days
[2:10:00] we're going to see him because that's
[2:10:03] what Believers believe in the physical
[2:10:06] corporate return of Jesus Christ
[2:10:13] but now
[2:10:15] we struggle for life
[2:10:18] we get a cold and that coal will almost
[2:10:21] take your life
[2:10:22] you'll struggle with it for weeks you'll
[2:10:25] have a cough your your residue and
[2:10:28] everybody that gets around you they go
[2:10:31] she's got covet
[2:10:38] because you're struggling
[2:10:40] you wasn't made in that Eternal realm
[2:10:43] there were no coals but because of the
[2:10:45] fall of sin
[2:10:47] you were born in a body of Flesh and you
[2:10:51] struggle you have to have glasses
[2:10:54] teeth
[2:10:57] mine are glued in
[2:10:59] you you know before long you'll have to
[2:11:02] have artificial things
[2:11:04] to help you through life
[2:11:09] but it tells us that we're going to a
[2:11:11] land
[2:11:14] I don't know what they'll do with all of
[2:11:16] this metal that's in our bodies but
[2:11:17] we're going to a land
[2:11:19] where we're not going to need any of
[2:11:21] these things down here on this Earth
[2:11:24] [Applause]
[2:11:31] we say I do
[2:11:34] she stands in a beautiful dress
[2:11:38] most of the time you're standing in some
[2:11:40] sort of a tuxedo or a tie or a shirt
[2:11:43] that's nice
[2:11:45] and you make a promise that
[2:11:48] that you'll that you'll spend life
[2:11:50] together brother Rand said we step out
[2:11:53] of the realm of Eternity into a realm of
[2:11:56] time
[2:11:57] will go through life and we'll meet one
[2:12:00] another
[2:12:01] whoo
[2:12:06] she'll take your breath
[2:12:08] you've met a lot of girls but that one
[2:12:10] takes your breath
[2:12:12] and you'll just know that she's the
[2:12:14] right one
[2:12:16] I was standing the other day at
[2:12:17] Christmas Inn
[2:12:20] and
[2:12:21] the man named Jack he's a return retired
[2:12:23] sheriff's officer and he now is a he's
[2:12:27] now a a guy that takes your luggage in
[2:12:30] and out is what his daughter is the
[2:12:32] manager of the place and
[2:12:34] and he oh Jack looked at me and he said
[2:12:37] Ron I want to ask you a question
[2:12:41] how in the world did you ever get such a
[2:12:44] beautiful woman
[2:12:47] he said I'm just asking you honestly he
[2:12:49] said you look a lot older than she does
[2:12:56] he said she's a beautiful woman
[2:12:59] I didn't ask her for permission to tell
[2:13:01] this story
[2:13:03] and I said see Jack this is the deal
[2:13:06] have you ever heard about those blind
[2:13:07] days
[2:13:10] that's where the skin comes up over the
[2:13:12] snake's eyes I'm not calling her snake
[2:13:14] now
[2:13:15] and they become blind for a little while
[2:13:17] and
[2:13:18] and I said she was in that period of
[2:13:20] being blind and
[2:13:26] one day she woke up
[2:13:29] and she looked and you
[2:13:34] I said we've made it work out all these
[2:13:36] years
[2:13:42] huh
[2:13:45] I'll take you to dinner
[2:13:53] for better for worse
[2:13:57] now I'm talking about a natural marriage
[2:14:00] when you're standing there you don't
[2:14:02] think about cancer
[2:14:05] you don't think about being broke
[2:14:08] you don't think about bankruptcy in
[2:14:11] business
[2:14:12] you don't think about the struggles of
[2:14:14] life you don't think about I'm going to
[2:14:16] be a pastor's wife and watch my husband
[2:14:18] go through a lot of ups and downs in his
[2:14:21] life
[2:14:22] be there to
[2:14:24] to wipe his brow and to encourage him
[2:14:28] you don't think about that but life
[2:14:31] comes
[2:14:32] Matthew you said it right
[2:14:35] the trials of life you got to be tested
[2:14:37] to go through it
[2:14:39] and the only thing that will hold you is
[2:14:41] Jesus
[2:14:45] you come to church now I turn it just a
[2:14:48] little bit you come to church and you
[2:14:51] you at the first year it gets a little
[2:14:53] bit of a honeymoon experience
[2:14:56] everything seems good for a while
[2:14:58] but after a while the struggle starts
[2:15:02] and the enemy begins to work on you and
[2:15:04] he begins to test you and he begins to
[2:15:07] make a lot of fun of you and before long
[2:15:10] it's your energy that you got to
[2:15:12] struggle with
[2:15:13] maybe just to get to church
[2:15:18] maybe to pray
[2:15:20] maybe to read your Bible maybe to listen
[2:15:23] to tapes
[2:15:24] he'll present you with a lot of things
[2:15:26] in your life to try to get your
[2:15:28] attention in a lot of different
[2:15:30] directions
[2:15:31] but a God that's rich in Mercy
[2:15:35] he'll get you through the test of your
[2:15:37] life there will be mountaintops and
[2:15:40] there will be deep valleys but it's down
[2:15:42] in the valley it's where the real
[2:15:44] flowers and the real Gardens grow up on
[2:15:48] the mountaintops we all enjoy that but
[2:15:50] it's up there where you'll freeze in the
[2:15:53] winter
[2:15:56] that's why Paul could write it who shall
[2:15:59] separate us from the love of Christ
[2:16:02] shall tribulation distress or
[2:16:04] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[2:16:06] parallel sword he could write it because
[2:16:08] he had felt it
[2:16:09] as it is written for thy sake were
[2:16:11] killed all the day long and were counted
[2:16:13] as a sheep for the slaughter nay and all
[2:16:15] these things
[2:16:18] we're more than conquerors through him
[2:16:21] that loved us for I am persuaded that
[2:16:24] neither death nor life nor angels or
[2:16:27] principalities no powers nor things
[2:16:29] presence are things that come nor height
[2:16:32] nor death nor any other creature shall
[2:16:34] separate us from the love of God which
[2:16:37] is in Christ Jesus
[2:16:39] our Lord
[2:16:46] the longer you're married
[2:16:49] the more you love one another
[2:16:54] the longer you're married
[2:16:56] the more in love with God
[2:17:00] you are
[2:17:04] anybody can serve him when everything's
[2:17:06] well
[2:17:09] when the bills are paid
[2:17:12] you're in a beautiful home
[2:17:14] your car's running good
[2:17:17] job's great
[2:17:19] marriage seem like it's a honeymoon
[2:17:25] every old hypocrite's happy
[2:17:32] but let it flip upside
[2:17:35] [Applause]
[2:17:37] let the doctor say words you know people
[2:17:40] panic when they just hear the word see
[2:17:44] and then it turns out it wasn't
[2:17:47] but there's sometimes it turns out it is
[2:17:51] and your whole perspective
[2:17:57] you don't believe me
[2:18:00] you hear a request
[2:18:03] you have prayer requested Happy Valley
[2:18:07] and you read those requests
[2:18:11] you know when you're reading about other
[2:18:13] people
[2:18:16] you know you have a
[2:18:18] a real heart for them
[2:18:21] but all of a sudden you're reading about
[2:18:22] yourself
[2:18:24] you're in the medical field and you know
[2:18:26] what I'm talking about
[2:18:30] you know when it's this guy or that
[2:18:32] woman or this one over here
[2:18:35] or maybe across the sea
[2:18:38] but all of a sudden it's your child
[2:18:43] all of a sudden it's you
[2:18:46] it's amazing how you can change from one
[2:18:49] day
[2:18:50] to another day
[2:18:53] now I want to come to this point
[2:18:56] and I'm just about done
[2:19:02] I go to the doctor
[2:19:06] I have a heed in my stomach
[2:19:10] it's a heat that you can feel on the
[2:19:12] outside
[2:19:14] I told sister Connie standing beside of
[2:19:16] a Christmas tree
[2:19:18] I said life couldn't be better
[2:19:21] in that rain we both were standing in
[2:19:24] aprons
[2:19:25] where we're going to have our whole
[2:19:26] family there brother Vernon you guys
[2:19:28] were coming for dinner
[2:19:30] and we were just looking forward to
[2:19:32] serving 30 to 40 people that day and and
[2:19:35] we said life could not be better
[2:19:39] I go to the doctor and
[2:19:42] he comes back in and he said Ryan I'm
[2:19:44] getting ready to send you down a dark
[2:19:45] Road I'd later ask him said how did you
[2:19:48] know that and he said you're a preacher
[2:19:50] and he said you can feel cancer he said
[2:19:52] I'm a doctor and I can feel it
[2:19:58] I'd go for tests
[2:19:59] I'd go for scans
[2:20:02] and I had a meeting to preach
[2:20:06] at that point it was just a thought
[2:20:11] we would go after Christmas after those
[2:20:13] days and we would go and
[2:20:15] we'd go to Dollywood
[2:20:18] God bless dolly
[2:20:24] we'd go to Dollywood and
[2:20:26] we'd be standing at a certain place
[2:20:28] right where where the Eagles are are
[2:20:30] caged they're a rehabilitation for
[2:20:33] Eagles we were standing right there when
[2:20:36] I got the call from the little Russian
[2:20:37] nurse you know her well sister Dolores
[2:20:41] and she said Ron you've you've got
[2:20:43] something in your lungs
[2:20:46] and
[2:20:48] and so sister Dolores I was getting
[2:20:51] ready to go home and I was going to fly
[2:20:54] to brother bissell's meeting
[2:20:57] and so
[2:20:59] sister Dolores call Connie and told her
[2:21:01] said you need to go with him because
[2:21:03] he's going to get some news
[2:21:05] he's supposed to get some news this week
[2:21:07] that's going to be disappointing
[2:21:09] and Connie called the airline and they
[2:21:12] placed her on the same seat right next
[2:21:15] to me on all the flights
[2:21:18] whoever that was was God ordained and
[2:21:20] she got her ticket cheaper than mine
[2:21:28] on the evening that I'm getting ready to
[2:21:30] go to the meeting
[2:21:33] I'm standing there and the sermon
[2:21:36] tonight is going to be called courage
[2:21:41] I'm going to preach to an audience
[2:21:45] of maybe six to seven hundred people on
[2:21:47] Courage
[2:21:51] I'd spoke it before
[2:21:54] but five minutes before I left the hotel
[2:21:56] room I get a call
[2:21:59] and that call would say Ron you have
[2:22:02] cancer
[2:22:04] it's in your lungs
[2:22:07] the sermon don't change
[2:22:12] the word of God don't change
[2:22:15] I'm preaching to you now
[2:22:17] my pastorship don't change
[2:22:22] God didn't change because I got a car
[2:22:26] there would be biopsies that I would
[2:22:28] have to go through
[2:22:30] there would be times of great fear great
[2:22:33] struggle
[2:22:36] one of the tumors was right beside of
[2:22:38] the atrial to my heart
[2:22:41] and they had to find out what was in it
[2:22:44] in the tumor
[2:22:47] and was quite a fearful thing they told
[2:22:50] me all the things that I might have
[2:22:51] might struggle with
[2:22:54] and I was laying and they kept flipping
[2:22:56] me around and flipping me around and say
[2:22:58] he was flipping me around I I was
[2:23:00] thinking there's no cancer there
[2:23:02] and finally one of the doctors came in
[2:23:04] and he put his head in the in that big
[2:23:07] you know what I'm talking about that big
[2:23:09] thing
[2:23:10] and he said Ron it's not that we can't
[2:23:13] find it it's just so much of it
[2:23:15] we got to pick the right place
[2:23:19] and he said would you like me to pray
[2:23:20] with you
[2:23:21] I said yeah I I would really like that
[2:23:25] Andrew had seen
[2:23:28] the lady doctor she had a Bible verse on
[2:23:31] her Bible
[2:23:35] and she quickly covered it up when
[2:23:37] Andrew pointed it out
[2:23:39] she didn't know what we were but we were
[2:23:41] believers
[2:23:42] let me just say we're real believers
[2:23:47] and we would say it like this though God
[2:23:49] slay me yet I'll trust him
[2:23:54] are you with me now
[2:23:56] Erica Reagan is in a fight for her life
[2:24:00] and that fight is very real
[2:24:02] you may have never got a diagnosis but
[2:24:05] listen when you get a diagnosis it's a
[2:24:07] struggle for life but many people don't
[2:24:10] know that the sword is coming
[2:24:13] and it's a fight for your life every day
[2:24:15] is a miracle for you
[2:24:23] you prayed with me and he said would you
[2:24:24] would you like to go to sleep
[2:24:27] I said yeah that'd be real nice
[2:24:30] he said well good night
[2:24:32] so he put me to sleep
[2:24:35] I've got a lot of great knock doctors
[2:24:38] I'll see some great doctors on on
[2:24:40] Tuesday
[2:24:46] they don't want me to go blind
[2:24:52] because the cancer is on the optical
[2:24:55] system
[2:24:57] I'm not afraid
[2:25:02] I spoke to brother Wayne Lawson
[2:25:04] yesterday for about 40 minutes
[2:25:09] we talked about life
[2:25:11] we talked about things
[2:25:14] he asked me what I was thinking as I was
[2:25:16] facing trials
[2:25:18] and I said brother Wayne wherever it
[2:25:20] takes me he's with me
[2:25:24] at the end of it
[2:25:26] brother Wayne's making about a 10-hour
[2:25:28] Journey
[2:25:29] brother Joel you'll like this
[2:25:31] you know God don't have to tell you
[2:25:33] things
[2:25:36] some things seem so insignificant but
[2:25:38] yet so great
[2:25:40] at the end of it I just sent brother
[2:25:42] Wayne a note
[2:25:44] this is exactly where you are
[2:25:47] in your journey
[2:25:49] and I talked to him for about 40 minutes
[2:25:51] and the Lord Dropped In My Heart of his
[2:25:55] 10-hour Journey exactly where he was
[2:25:58] you know sometimes
[2:26:01] in your journey of life
[2:26:04] it just seemed so insignificant but God
[2:26:08] just tells you
[2:26:09] this is exactly where you are
[2:26:19] Andrew
[2:26:22] Matthew
[2:26:25] every day is a miracle we share together
[2:26:31] every day is a miracle when I get to
[2:26:33] enjoy my grandbabies
[2:26:35] every day is a miracle when I get to
[2:26:37] stand in front of this audience again
[2:26:40] every day
[2:26:44] now
[2:26:47] for me my struggle might be a little
[2:26:48] different than yours
[2:26:55] my fight might be a little different
[2:26:57] than yours
[2:27:00] maybe sometimes you don't realize that
[2:27:02] you see people jumping and shouting
[2:27:05] praising the Lord you don't know what
[2:27:08] they went through for the week
[2:27:12] and maybe you're watching my internet
[2:27:14] and you're going that bunch is just
[2:27:16] emotional
[2:27:19] well what you don't realize we may be
[2:27:21] that emotional part of Heaven
[2:27:27] [Applause]
[2:27:36] we might be that rivers of life section
[2:27:39] that's over there where the leaves are
[2:27:41] waving and
[2:27:43] where the stream is a bubbling
[2:27:46] now for the critic they might be the
[2:27:48] desert
[2:27:52] where everything is sticky and punchy
[2:27:56] now let me just say that's a real tough
[2:27:59] place to live and I understand that you
[2:28:01] want to be our critic
[2:28:04] but you might ought to see where you're
[2:28:05] at
[2:28:07] you don't have to live in the desert
[2:28:09] [Applause]
[2:28:11] [Music]
[2:28:17] you don't have to stay there
[2:28:19] you can rise and
[2:28:23] have a fresh and true Revival
[2:28:31] oh brother Ron one day you'll mature in
[2:28:34] the message
[2:28:36] can I give you one more story before we
[2:28:38] close
[2:28:40] brother Branham had a little group come
[2:28:42] over to his church
[2:28:45] and that little group came over and they
[2:28:47] were going to do some singing for him
[2:28:48] and
[2:28:50] and brother Branham was sitting there
[2:28:52] and he was watching them one of them
[2:28:54] grabbed a washboard
[2:28:57] and another one grabbed a tambourine and
[2:29:01] they started singing
[2:29:04] and they were playing that washboard and
[2:29:06] one was playing that piano and before
[2:29:08] long one of those sisters was was a
[2:29:10] dancing and she was throwing her head in
[2:29:13] a certain way and
[2:29:15] brother random began to make some
[2:29:16] statements like a lot of people do
[2:29:20] and he said they're going to turn my
[2:29:22] church into a hoedown
[2:29:34] now
[2:29:36] this might help you
[2:29:38] the angel started talking to him
[2:29:42] you know the one that revealed the seals
[2:29:46] you know the one that talked with him
[2:29:49] about getting some squirrels
[2:29:51] you know the one that talked to him
[2:29:53] about
[2:29:54] you know talking to that storm and
[2:29:57] telling it to go back where it came from
[2:29:58] you know the same one that said Sun
[2:30:01] stand still
[2:30:04] you know the one that told Moses to
[2:30:06] stretch his Rod out over the sea
[2:30:11] that one
[2:30:13] and that one
[2:30:15] said if you had the victory
[2:30:18] that she had
[2:30:24] [Laughter]
[2:30:27] if you had the victory that she had
[2:30:31] what was that song we got sent to us
[2:30:34] this morning Satan your kingdom is
[2:30:37] coming down
[2:30:40] oh Satan your kingdom is
[2:30:43] coming down
[2:30:45] oh I Heard a Voice
[2:30:49] from Heaven say
[2:30:53] Satan your kingdom is coming down
[2:30:59] there was a fella sitting on the stage
[2:31:01] he was looking around how everybody was
[2:31:03] enjoying the service
[2:31:06] and he was looking this way and he was
[2:31:08] looking that way and he's looking that
[2:31:10] way now you know all he needed to do was
[2:31:12] put his hand on his foot on his leg a
[2:31:14] little bit
[2:31:15] now brother Branham said after the angel
[2:31:18] talked to him if you had the victory she
[2:31:20] had
[2:31:20] he said I started patting my foot
[2:31:25] oh brother Ron but I'm afraid I'll get
[2:31:27] in the flesh we'll just start patting
[2:31:28] your foot a little bit
[2:31:32] and then he started patting his knee
[2:31:35] now you know what he said he said I
[2:31:37] found myself out in the floor doing the
[2:31:40] same thing that she was doing
[2:31:44] [Applause]
[2:31:55] oh but I can hear the critics say well
[2:31:57] that was before the seals well let me
[2:31:59] give you one
[2:32:00] just before he passed away
[2:32:03] invisible Union of the Bride he said
[2:32:05] that modern Church don't want any of
[2:32:07] these acts 2 38. screaming whooping
[2:32:10] youngins
[2:32:14] miserable creatures she thinks they are
[2:32:18] the modern Church don't want none of
[2:32:20] them but that's the only kind
[2:32:24] that the word can produce
[2:32:28] I don't know what kind your church is
[2:32:30] wanting but I want that kind
[2:32:32] [Applause]
[2:32:35] so therefore we're fighting for our life

[2:49:55] wholeness
[2:49:57] Hallelujah isn't he wonderful isn't he
[2:50:01] wonderful to think that our God loves us
[2:50:03] so much they said I'm gonna come back
[2:50:06] and I'm gonna snatch you right out of
[2:50:08] the hands of the enemy
[2:50:10] that death can't hold you the grave
[2:50:13] can't conceal you
[2:50:14] Hallelujah I'm looking for that day with
[2:50:16] everything with every fiber of my being
[2:50:18] and I'll say it's worth fighting for
[2:50:21] I was talking to Malachi and Khloe last
[2:50:24] night where you have a little Fellowship
[2:50:25] after service I said if there's one
[2:50:26] thing that I want to see it's the change
[2:50:29] right there
[2:50:31] it's a change to watch these molecules
[2:50:36] change
[2:50:38] to watch old skin become loose skin
[2:50:42] waking up with different pain in your
[2:50:44] body every single day where'd that one
[2:50:46] come from what I do yesterday to think
[2:50:48] that one of these Mormons you're going
[2:50:49] to wake up and you're not going to have
[2:50:50] no pain
[2:50:52] maybe today could have been the last day
[2:50:54] that you woke up and sat on the side of
[2:50:55] the bed and you read your Bible or you
[2:50:58] made up maybe you had a little prayer
[2:50:59] before you got out of the bed and you
[2:51:01] wanted to make sure you made that first
[2:51:02] step right today could have been the
[2:51:04] last day that you made that kind of
[2:51:06] commitment that I've got to get up
[2:51:07] slowly tomorrow could be the morning
[2:51:09] that you wake up and all of your body
[2:51:11] parts are starting to change you look in
[2:51:12] the mirror and everything everything
[2:51:14] that you're looking at is completely
[2:51:15] different
[2:51:17] I think I'm gonna have a Time
[2:51:19] I think I just have myself I might tell
[2:51:22] I might tear my little cabin out there
[2:51:24] in them Woods I might tear it down and
[2:51:25] burn it because I ain't gonna need it
[2:51:27] much longer
[2:51:29] if I see these molecules start changing
[2:51:31] you can have everything I got you can
[2:51:33] have the deed in my home you can have
[2:51:36] this church you can have my cars you can
[2:51:38] have all you want to because I ain't
[2:51:40] going to need them much longer because
[2:51:41] change is upon my body
[2:51:44] well come on somebody give him praise
[2:51:50] are you looking for the change
[2:51:54] amen amen
[2:51:56] amen we're going to let you be dismissed

[2:52:00] our heart we thank you for being a part
[2:52:02] of these services this weekend
[2:52:03] participating I we enjoy these these
[2:52:06] Services they come once a year and we
[2:52:09] certainly appreciate how the Lord
[2:52:10] dovetails and matches everything up
[2:52:12] perfectly together and I'm so glad that
[2:52:15] we can hide under the rock I'd say it's
[2:52:17] worth fighting for don't you
[2:52:19] I think we ought to jump with everything
[2:52:21] that's within us to get inside of the
[2:52:23] Rock Amen why don't you turn to your
[2:52:25] neighbor greet them God bless them and
[2:52:27] and send them on their way

[2:52:36] poor
