and we're not going to barely make the Rapture we're going to more than make the Rapture the finish line is not going to just be right here and we just scooted in and the door hits us no we're stepping right into it because we've been called for it hallelujah amen what what a privilege and an honor it is to be a believer in this end time amen God bless you let's go to him in prayer dear gracious kind Heavenly Father we how we thank you Lord Jesus for your presence oh God that's already here and Lord if if your angels love to watch the children worship how much more do you because you're the one that redeemed us not an angel and father I believe you've come to take notes to see our reaction to the word to see us worship Lord and to see how the word excites us father God we want to tell you that we're impressed and the word is so exciting to us it's it's ever living it's so fresh every time we open the word father you're speaking to us we ask oh God now that you bless each and every one here please be with all the sick and needy Lord many are out father during this season and this time but father in sickness or in health you're still our healer you're still Our God but father we just ask that may your spirit go and minister to each and every one we love you with all of our hearts Lord and we just ask you forgive us of our sins may you take the Frailty oh god of humanity once more and use it for your honor and your glory May something be said here tonight Lord that would give a boost Lord to your son and daughter how we love you Lord and we're conscience Lord that we have the purchase of your blood before us we just pray you have your will and your way from the first word to the last in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless each and every one of you thank you musicians if you will if you'll turn with me to the book of Hebrews and the Book of Luke we'll begin with the Book of Luke first Luke chapter 29 I'm sorry Luke 22: 19 and then down to Hebrews 9 Luke 22:19 and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me likewise also he took the cup after serer supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you in Hebrews chap 9:1 but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of bulls of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the H and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve a living God and here's the part I want to emphasize verse 15 and for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity everybody say necessity necess be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated ated without blood amen God bless you as you have your seats with the help of the Lord I'd like to speak on God's will and testament I found it kind of fascinating sitting back here you know last weekend brother Ron was kind of making some closing statements kind of getting there at the end and he hit he hit really good on this will and I was like thank you Lord praise God he knows how to speak to you when you're in the right channel amen and see many of these things may be familiar to you we just pray we open up our hearts and like brother Donnie Donnie Reagan has said you know I can always preach from the maps that's always a place you can go amen but the help of the Lord will will speak some things to you that will be a blessing to you amen so Paul here is talking about a last will and a Testament now the Bible in plain language is God's will now the Bible is God's will whenever you look at it as his desire what is God's will for my life right here what is God's will for who I'm supposed to marry right here what's God's will for how I'm supposed to run a family on and on and on it's God's will it's his desire but a deeper understanding that this isn't just God's will is in his desire but it's literally God's will in the form of inheritance everything that you've been promised in this Bible he paid dearly for it and he had to die to enforce it he had to it to to die because the LA what is the last will in Testament a last will and testament in the natural is a legal document that communicates a person's final wishes pertaining to their assets it provides Specific Instructions about what to do with their possessions but God's will is in your inheritance it belongs to you now One requirement as we read for a will to and Naturally Speaking the will cannot go into effect without the person passing but what what what's so different and wonderful about our Lord Jesus Christ he didn't just he wasn't just a martyr to just give his life for a good cause but he said that the because I have I laid down my life and I might take it up again no man taketh it from me but I lay it down myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again this commandment have I received of my father he had power no man was able to kill Jesus until before his time he had power to take it down and to raise it back up what a statement what a statement but it took the death of Jesus Christ to release the Holy Ghost without the death of our Lord and savior there would be no Holy Ghost it would all been encapsulated in one man the Lord Jesus Christ but it was by because he as the testator was killed and when they stuck that spear water blood and Spirit came forth and that then released the new birth to the Believers it released the elements as it was of the new birth water blood and spirit if Jesus would have went all the way to the cross and he would have healed the sick and he would have cleansed the leper and he would have raised the Widow of na son and all them things but at the cross he would have come off we'd be hopelessly lost we would be hopelessly lost but he sat there until until every prophecy was fulfilled and then these precious words rolled off of his lips it is finished and he bowed his head and he died and at that time he gave his life to make this a reality a reality that the prophets and the sages and great prophets like Elijah you are experiencing a reality that he could not under the blood of bulls and goats you are experiencing a daily overcoming reality that David could not experience what's the difference the testator gave his life and now we have access to the Holy Ghost we have access to what our will isall and we should be just as interested in what God's will says as of what will in the natural would say the real book of the Old Testament if you'll follow me here is actually the book of Acts because you have the gospels and they recorded what Jesus did and there at the end it was after his resurrection but the book of Acts records what the Believers did with this Holy Ghost what do they do with this inheritance what do they do when the word became Quicken you then start reading the book of Acts and you see them like a house like a wild like a wildfire on a windy day the prophet called it why is that because he gave his life life and it enacted and it enforced the word it made the word where you can live it you can live the word in a day and age where PE where where people can't even love their neighbor you are the word made flesh you can live it because you've been called to it because remember no man can come to me except the father draw on so it's not something that we attach ourselves to it's something that he does the calling now God has Eternal Eternal qualities there attributes about himself in in the in the world especially those of atheistic beliefs and things because atheism is a belief they don't admit it but it's something they believe okay they always go to why is there such pain why is there such suffering why this why that they don't understand that God had attributes within himself but they were locked up in one great spirit and he as a father desired to unlock them attributes and make them avail available to you to so that you all those that are sick out so that they and all the prayer requests so that we have all experienced him as a Healer he's a savior and if you haven't experienced him that way then he's here to be experienced that way he's a holy ghost filler and that's how you can know that he rose from the dead is because he gave his life so that you will know and he didn't just give his life for them to make some statue and say that was Jesus he gave his life so he rose from the dead and now he's not only he was with them but now he's in us now if it wasn't for the fall we'd be just like the Angels we'd never sin we'd know nothing of Redemption all we know is one thing worship that's it but God has a different plan for his sons and his daughters the entire gospel you know somebody came and asked Jesus a question one day about what's the great commandment and at all all 10 he said that you should love the Lord thy God with all your heart with all your mind and with all your soul and you should love your neighbor as yourself the entire gospel in this message is built on love if you read the word if you hear the tapes of the Prophet if you hear a true called Minister preach and you're not getting love you you're missing something either they're not preaching it right because the Bible is love God is love and it's all based on love what is this Capstone in the stat of a perfect man what is of all messages this Capstone is actually connected to perfect love God gave the prophet experiences in perfect love that no other messenger or Prophet ever experienced because perfect love brother Ram said is the only thing to enter over there perfect love but he had these attributes in him and these attributes that we experience when we go to bodies that won't get sick when we go to bodies that don't get tired we will be singing his Praises for ceaseless ages to come now God is a family man God has a family and that's why Satan attacks the family have you noticed go Satan hates families because God allowed marriage and he instituted the first marriage between a man and a woman and he instituted the family because it's a reflection of his own family he's a father so we can Now understand him by the natural things that we experience in Ephesians 3:14 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is name now he has sons and daughters and they're literally Brother Ray a part of him that can never be lost his elected bride there's those that are saved and then there's the bride God has a place for them we should never discount somebody that can't see this message but this message is only for the bride the Rapture is only for for the bride in Colossians 1:16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him now Paul's talking about Jesus here so this right here must be real confusing for the trinitarian idea because Paul was saying that Jesus created all things and he is before all things and by him all things consist so nothing that was made nothing that we see nothing that we feel and handle that was made the Bible says that was not made by him so then how did he make it in the sermon the seed shall not be air with the Shook and I'm going to try and and go slow so we can catch this thought here he said he was God the logos the word that went out of God so you have God the Eternal Spirit he's the self-existent one he's by himself with his attributes he creates the angels and he he creates the seraphim and all these things of Glory but yet you're still in him at that moment you're in him you're in him before the foundation of the world he knows you he knows what age you're coming he knows exactly where you'd be sitting right now at that moment he said the word that went out of God when he begin to brood over the Earth and it brought forth marine life when the spirit of God the logos the word we're going to connect some scriptures here which God said let there be and there went the logos which is the word out from him not a separate person it was a part of him that went out as a Loos and as as a mother would brood over the Earth and begin to create things that was in the beginning you were in him then at that moment he was already slain in the mind of God glory in which when God said let there be there went the logos which is the word because all this was in the logos the whole word the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age was in him but it wasn't expressed in book form it wasn't expressed in pyramid form he was expressing it in Star form that's the first Bible but yet the Stars will agree with the pyramid and the pyramid agrees with this because there are three Bibles not separate versions they're the same version but it took a prophet to come and explain the pyramid it came the prophet of God to come and explain the Stars God had it in a prophet so we could understand this so that word was in him already at the time of creation the whole word of God the whole Bible for every age so that is whenever the bride for every age you're believing this end time message our brothers and sisters that believe the Pentecostal message our brothers and sisters that believed uh Wesley's message and on down they their their belief in the message of their day proved that they were in him before the foundation of the world proved that they were in the mind of God because by believing the word it identified them that they were in him what did the prophet say because in the non-elect there's nothing to Quicken so if there's something to quicken in you sister Anna that means that you had to have been somewhere before you don't remember it just like we don't remember being in our Earthly father but is a DNA test will prove that real fast there's no denying that while our Earthly parents were on the earth decades before we were born we were in them Medical Science proves that so if that happens in the natural why would it not be that way in the spiritual you don't remember it we don't remember it but there's a there's a human Spirit there's a human flesh but somewhere in you that cannot be seen only God can see is a part of God if you're born again and that is why I believ in this message is so easy because you're a part of it you've heard you've been somewhere you you don't identify it you can't say exactly but you know this is real I've heard it somewhere this is this grips me but it may not grip your neighbor it may not grip your sibling but it grips you because the way we come into the Earth naturally is just God's plan should not be overlooked but the real you is coming from God that's why never ever beat yourself up about the background you came from what what what does brother Ron Brother Andrew always preach look forward we don't care about what your past was that though your family history does not matter a single bit how your brother may be and how your sister may be and how your parents will be don't matter we because when you're born again you realize you're from a Heavenly Father you've got a Heavenly parent so it's that deep that calleth to the deep it works differently for different people but for a lot of people they only have to hear it once some more and that's okay God has his way don't feel bad if it took you a long time the main thing is be thankful you heard that's the thing be thankful you heard so then he said as the Loos so you see here you see Jesus in logos he has not taken body of Flesh yet are yall still with me he was still in Loos form we're going to get to John 1 when he said in the beginning was the word we're reading about it right here the word was with God and the Word was God the prophet said that the logos the word went out from God but he did not take flesh yet then in one in St John 1:14 he says that word became flesh and dwelled among us then he could die for you then he could be sick for you then he could bleed for you but at this point he could not but he was creating and he was brooding and and as he brooded you know evolution is is a satanic perversion of God's actual Evolution so to speak when God said let there be that's what it was and every seed brings forth of his kind but he started with a low life and actually built himself up so the Capstone it was of of the Garden of Eden of his creation was man Adam and Eve so Satan attacked that and when he attacked that and that fell that brought everything out it made the fall cuz it was up God created up and when the very top creation fell everything fell underneath it now they're all waiting on us to come to maturity because the Bible said there the Earth is groaning and crying waiting to be go back so he said as the low God Gods begin to breathe upon the Earth there come marine life and building up the bird life up onto animal life and finally there comes something in the representation or looked like the thing that was brewing it brooding over it God a man in the very image of God that man fell like the seed has to fall and then God began to brood over that after the fall so how'd he begin brooding again whenever man sinned how did he begin brooding again because remember he had to bring it back up it fell he brought up a Enoch he brought up an Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought up Prophet after Prophet trying to restore that image again see that perfect couple fell and God would give out his word throughout the Old Testament and Noah came and all these different prophets and it was getting closer and closer and it was building on up building on up and finally he said upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself which was God the logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us so so God died for you you understand God died for you he took on flesh that Lowa that's why he said I came from God and I go back to God John 1 4 in the be or 1:1 rather excuse me in the beginning was the word so now that you read that with that quote in the back of your mind this should be even more clear to us in the beginning was the word that's when he was broody and the Word was with God and the Word was God same person the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made Paul picks up the same thing he made it all in him was life and the life was the light of men and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and now brother R comes back comes down to you now that same logos has a part he's got a bride and the same logos this word that cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring the word to its full manifestation that's what the Holy Ghost is doing in this end time because the logos has a part because you were in him as Eve came from Adam we came from him Jesus was a Capstone of the of the Old Testament born in virgin flesh and Jesus Christ is the Capstone of the New Testament in Bride flesh husband wife man woman see how God is brooding and he fixes it just like in the Old Testament he was sitting there and he was brooding and brooding and brought a prophet and brought another prophet and brought another Prophet all of a sudden he steps out in the in the New Testament he has a church and she F fell so what does the Holy Spirit do he Broods he Broods he Broods there was a dark age and the just shall live by faith he's brooding he's brooding and now what do he see you see a full word Bride on the earth with the same works that he had there was a reason why none of the other uh Messengers could have the the ministry brother R had because they were Messengers and not word prophets there's one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ one God Amen in Acts 4:12 neither is there salvation and any other for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when a person back to the Natural here when a person writes a will he does it while he's living and the instructions as I said are only carried out when the individual dies and a will has to name an executive he's got a name an overseer and that person is responsible for administering the estate he's to make sure that siblings don't fight he's to make sure that everything is carried out exactly as a testator wanted it the executive is the Holy Ghost it is his job to make sure that the word finds every child of God just like it's the executive's it's the executive's job to make sure no matter how hard and long he's got to search he's got to do everything within his reasonable power to locate the airs and John 16 verse 5 and now I go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whether goest thou but because I have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you in verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come and he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you the job of the Holy Ghost is to reveal this word to you the job of the Holy Ghost is to bring God's children back to him now when the exe Naturally Speaking when the executive you know goes to look and and does everything and come to find out he's a homeless guy sitting on the side of the road he could be the biggest bum in Harrisonburg and he's just sitting there holding a sign been begging for all of his life and just or not for for years should I say but all of a sudden a nice car pulls up and says hey are you so and so and he's probably looking for a hand out when turns out he owns companies one moment changed it one moment in 1 Corinthians 2:10 and God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God the holy spirit is looking for you and if you're running if you're running from God and you belong to God he's not going to quit looking for you he's not going to quit calling for you no matter what background you've come from and no matter what it doesn't your your past doesn't matter what matters is that the the the executor the Holy Ghost came and knocked on your heart and said hey you're not you're not the Son and Daughter of so and so you are the Son and Daughter of God what is that it's the Holy Ghost bringing you back to your position now we live we live Naturally Speaking we live in a very dark time but that just makes the lights shine that much more now in SE in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 8 and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power in signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and them that per per is because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved that's why we have the generation we have is because they receive not a love for the truth and Paul goes on in verse 11 and for this cause because they receed not a love for the truth God shall send them a strong delusion that they should believe a lie and actually be damned by it why all because they would not receive a love of the truth why is this country in the shape that she's in because she received not a love of the truth why are churches the shape that they're in is because they receive not a love for the truth you remember whenever Abraham was down there out of Sodom and them two them Three Angels came down and one stayed with Abraham and them two angels went down brother Andrew into Sodom and Gomorrah to see you'll find that when they went their preaching did not help them them it actually smoked them blind it made them even worse off and remember it it blinded them and they couldn't find the door well who's the door the Lord Jesus Christ they can't find the door and I want you to notice also how aggressive the sodomites were do you see that same spirit in today they're aggressive with it they want to come after our kids they want to come after everything but because they receive not a love for the truth and they that in verse 12 that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness but we are bound to give to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth you think in this great spiritual famine that we're in it's so dark remember one of the last plagues in Egypt was a darkness that could be felt it's so dark if if a sincere heart just had a desire for the truth where would they find it God is the truth but if they don't have a heart for Him they're not going to find it you go and ask you you go in a in in a busy place and you ask them if you had to if you had to ask if they ever heard of William brandom if they ever heard of the message of the hour think of what a 0.000000% that you would get where they've even heard of him but especially believe what he said and not just preach what he said from behind the congre from behind a Pulpit and not give the prophet credit but to actually have even heard of him so think of what an exclusive group that you are the fact that you're here and you hear the truth we hear the truth twice a week we hear the truth on tapes during the week and and in different places you're blessed people because the Holy Ghost is locating and is trying to find those that God had redeemed the ones that were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world think of the prodal son the Bible said that when he came to himself he was a son all along but there came a point where he had got spiritual Amnesia and there came a point where he had to come to himself and go back home even on his worst day of sin he was still a son I love that go that that God put that story in the Bible there because when his father seen him come and he didn't chastise him he got the best robe he put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and killed the fatted calf brother R tells a story a very powerful parable about an eagle an eagle chick that's caught in a barnyard the farmer moved it and and we're all very familiar with the story and and the E and the eaget hatched and it was just a strange looking bird but to the chickens and it just could not quite be satisfied but one day the executive came flying overhead and when that executive gave that eagle scream that little eaglet chick looked up because it had hurt it it it was born in the chicken coop it couldn't identify that it hurt it but yet there was a deep within that little Eagle chick that called out it recognize the chickens might not have even lifted their head it wasn't a cluck but it was an eagle scream when the eagle screams the great Papa Eagle it gets his it gets his eaglets in order we're Children of the king everything the father has he gives to his children the joy that he had the peace that he had he now gives to you you don't have to live with a troubled mind you don't even have to live with a broken heart because he is the Healer of the broken hearts you don't have to live in depression and anxiety and all the things that Satan tries to put on you you think here you are if you have the Holy Ghost you are a holy ghost filled son and daughter of God with more power and authority than the angel Gabriel in heaven and Satan comes to attack you with depression but sometimes we allow ourselves we live under our Privileges and allow ourselves to be beat up into a corner you never seen Jesus apologize to the devil you never seen Jesus get put in a corner well you're not going to see his wife get put in a corner either oh he'll come oh he'll attack that's what he does but how it just must make him gloat to see a child if if no doubt he could he would think if they only realized but there's got to come a point when that spiritual Amnesia drops off of your mind and you know that you've called Satan has no bound on you Satan has no authority over you you belong to the Lord Jesus Christ the new body that he had belongs to you the resurrection he experienced it belongs to you it's all yours it's in the will and if it's in the will he died and rose again to make it available to you and now he rose again to enforce because he's the Holy Ghost too so he rose of the dead he's now in the form of the Holy Ghost to enforce the word do you remember whenever I forget what that brother's name was but he's the one that he had a car and he was going to the Tabernacle I think it was brother Evans and that Thug or whatever came and just stole his car and was driving and he came to brother brandham and brother Bram said let's pray and they prayed and they released the Holy Ghost over that situation and turns out that man that was doing that used to be a Christian and the Holy Ghost was able to deal with his heart to go bring it back release the Holy Ghost over your situations release the Holy Ghost over your lost loved ones release the Holy Ghost over your infirmities it may not be instantaneous as as that man was but release the Holy Ghost and he will enforce the word brother R said it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out honest hearts that will believe the message everything in the Bible that was promised is to that believer and when you accept it in its fullness and God knows that you'll do it he gives you the abstract to that and then every promise that's made in your possession and the Holy Spirit is there to Quicken that to you has there ever come a moment in your life where you're dealing with stuff even if it's in natural and you're like wait a minute why am I dealing with this I ain't got to deal with this well well let that righteous indignation kind of come up in your spirit too and if Satan's pushing you around say wait a minute I'm a son adopted son or daughter of God I don't have to deal with this that's why the new birth is so vital because it births us from natural sinful Tendencies we're all born with to a Heavenly family a New Creation one of my favorite scriptures 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new now there's God has a provided way to be an adopted son and daughter of God you got to be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost but even from a time you didn't remember you were still in his will when you were crawling around when you were an infant you were in his will when you were running from God like the prodigal you were in his will because you always were with him your flesh and the spirit have a beginning and an end but the part of you that actually is went to God that is a part of God can no more die than God can listen to this he says in the Lamb's Book of Life he said now believer have you got your joy shoes on listen to this if you're a Christian you are truly a God child your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world oh my the same time that Christ that God said Christ would be slain he wrote your name with his your picture is right next to his in the in the family album how can he deny you is Jesus's name on the Lamb's Book of Life absolutely he is the lamb and yours is there and the prophet is God said that your name is written right next to his God wrote your name associated with his before the foundation of the world God's not ashamed of you do you know that God is not ashamed of you so we should never be ashamed of him sisters should never be ashamed of how they look and how they dress because they do it for him Brothers should never be ashamed of how they carry themselves and how they act because it's a love offering to him you think in the gospels there whenever the disciples were all coming back and they were just so rejoicing and so happy that all the Devils were subject to their name and all the Miracles that they did and Jesus just looks at them and he says Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you but Rejoice rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven that's a real reason to Rejoice if you've never you know if you can't put your finger back on where you just did something so Supernatural or had such a supernatural experience as long as you're name is written on the Lamb's Book of Life that is all that matters that is all that matters and and you know speaking of subjects being of spirits being subject to you don't wait for the preacher or for church if you are a holy ghost filled son or daughter of God you have every right sister Tracy and every authority to cast that devil and stand on his head and to rebuke him you don't have to wait you are a son or daughter of God it is your right we'll pray with you we'll pray for you but don't forget the authority than adopted Sons and Daughters of God has the word brother said when he talking about John when he was baptized in in Jordan the word of God Jesus came to him the word always comes to the truly Spirit fill how many are here that weren't raised in the message if you could raise your hand okay all over the building so what brought you here the word looked for you found you brought you here why because of what he just said the word always comes to the elect always it will find you God will not lose a single one of you now Jesus is not here in his Corporal body to do the works but he's here in the church by the Holy Ghost to enforce the word it's the holy ghost that does the work he said in force in the restoration of the briery have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is Law and God is in is in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back back and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus sayeth the Lord he's got to give it up because the holy spirit is there to make him do it but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sick of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon him it's your right brother Gabriel he's not here but let me use him as an example he's here but he's not sitting here if Gabriel just picked a random house to go and kick their door in he'd end up on the wrong side of the bars wouldn't he but yet if he's got the legal right and authority to do so he not only has the legal right and authority to do so but he's then equipped to do it so we within ourselves can't do anything but now that you have been equipped by the Holy Ghost you've been given legal right to take back what the Devil's taken from you if it's your health if it's your mind it doesn't matter if it's your joy if it's your finances you have the god-given right to take it back to serve notice on the devil here's the notice here's the warrant and all of heaven will back you up with the badge of the Holy Ghost and the warrant of his word we can take everything back now as I mentioned earlier the love of God is a very powerful thing it reaches in places and in ways that we cannot even begin to imagine in Matthew 22:35 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying Master what is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like unto it thou shal love thy neighbor as thyself one on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets now Satan is always attacking love isn't he he'll come up with demonic phrases Like Love Is Love like all love is the same doesn't matter who loves who and what what side of the thing Love Is Love well know there's a Godly love and there's a perverted love so Satan not only attacks love but he'll also attack love to Christians and make us feel like we're not loved he'll make you feel like your brother and your sister don't love you he'll try and make you feel like God doesn't love you and then what he'll do is he'll first say well God doesn't love you and then he'll start and then if you believe it he'll then go to his next phase and he'll start breaking it down well that's why he ain't answering this prayer that's why this is happening that's why this is happening and when you listen to the devil it breaks down your experience it breaks down your faith should I say now in St John 17 one of my favorite chapters in The Bible Jesus is praying and I want you to listen to these words in verse 18 he says as thou has sent me into the world even so I have sent them into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the the truth neither pray I for these alone but for them also which should believe on me through their word that's you right here that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given them do you see this transfer of the will the glory that he had and he now he said I give to them that they may be one even as we are one and I and them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me now listen to these words and has loved them as thou has loved me so what am I saying God loves you as much as he loves himself oh he practices what he preaches he said Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself God loves you as much as he loves himself and Paul picks it up and says so ought men to love their wives as their own body it's scriptural he that loveth his wife loveth himself because she is a part of him so when God loves you he's loving himself in verse 24 father I will chapter 17 father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world that statement belongs to you too he loved you before the foundation of the world when you wanted nothing to do with God he still loved you because you were in his will and everything he died for belongs to you amen oh righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou has sent me and I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou has loved me may be in them and I am them you talk about real Oneness here the very love that God has for himself the very love that God expressed in Jesus Christ that's how much he loves you that's how much he loves you now whenever God called Abraham he promised him all that land and that land was a land of inheritance and it belonged to Abraham and to his seed remember look northward look Southward and that's what the that's what the children of Abraham that's what we are we the seed of the royal Seed of Abraham through Jesus Christ then we should be walking through the word and see what we own see the promises of God that he he has for us so Joshua was the one that was commissioned by God to divide the land amen and St in Joshua 1:6 be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them after all the battles were won Joshua by the by by the Holy Ghost wisdom was able to divide the land to every tribe all the land that they conquered now belong to them and it was supposed to they were supposed to serve God and God would make sure it stayed theirs forever now we know they sinned and backslid but that was God's plan was that they were to stay in that land Israel was to stay in their position and we know that Ephesians parallels Joshua and our great Joshua the Lord Jesus Christ he conquered death hell in the grave and everything under it everything that causes death all sickness all sin he conquered it everything that would send a person to hell he conquered it so you don't have to go but Ephesians parallels Joshua and Ephesians 1:6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted and the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in our wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which Heath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance in the Lord Jesus Christ being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will as that quote that we read earlier when he was creating when he was brooding you were already in him predestinated in him in verse 14 which is the earnest of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory you know in a natural will sometimes people are left something but they have to come to a certain age of maturity before they're able to get that well there's things in this word that we've been promised that we're full heirs to but we we haven't quite gotten there yet like the body change like the translation it's there and it's coming but the bride has got to get God is looking the executor is looking and when he finds that last one then it's time to go home then it's time to go home when the last son and daughter of God come home so some things are left in the will for a specific time speaking of inheritance in the Old Testament there was a man in the Old Testament his name was naboth he lived in the in the Days of Elijah and he had a Vineyard and he cared for it because that's what God commanded them to do they were supposed to live in their inheritance they were supposed to take care of it God wants you to appreciate what he's given you spiritual and natural and or naboth rather was cultivating this Vineyard and he it was just a beautiful place so Ahab was the Wicked king of of of that day he married Jezebel and he looks out of his window and he sees nebo's Vineyard over there and he begins to envy and to covet his Vineyard so he approaches naboth and he says hey look you know I'd really like to really like to have this Vineyard I'll pay you for it I'll pay you for it in First Kings 21:3 and Nebo said to Ahab the Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers un unto thee now Satan is going to make you some offers Satan's going to throw some Temptations across your path but the Lord forbid it that you should give up the inheritance of your fathers so Ahab comes back home and he's all Melancholy and he's all upset and pouting and Jezebel walks in she said what's the matter and he tells her what's going on and she said are you not the king of of Samaria and Israel go take it I'll I'll take care of it for you and so she got some false witnesses to to try and and say that uh nabbo blaspheme there and had him stoned and killed that made God very angry it made him so angry what Ahab did that the Prophet Elijah came out and pronounced a curse on both Ahab and on Jezebel because the way she forced and kill healed righteous naboth what did what was ahab's Doom the dogs licked his blood Jezebel the dog would eat her and that's what happened now just because we're Sons and Daughters of God and on our way to heaven with a new birth does not mean there's not trials there's many of us missing here tonight because of the trials but God always makes a way for it he always makes a way for it and brother R in one place he said that he's right behind your trial and he watches us he said that's the power of Faith to believe when he as standing over behind the Dark Cloud that you can't see with your natural eyes but Faith standing by you directs you to that God of resurrection and a God of all wisdom who has ordained our path he's standing just behind every every trial he's standing just behind brother Ron's trial he's standing just behind your trial an attitude is so important our attitude with how we take trials when they come are very important God wants us to handle it with Grace and we have to trust the Lord to do that he says oh I love it don't you to to know that Peter said that every trial is worth more to us than gold for it's working every son that cometh to God must first be tried score is chastened and if you get a little heartache after you get born again a little trial that upsets you somewhere and you run back into the world again it shows you wasn't a child to begin with he said you become an illegitimate child and not a child of God if a man once anchors his heart against the heart of Calvary all devils in hell will never never Shake him no more he's there you could be having the hardest trial of your life yet that doesn't change your position before God you're still a son and daughter of God then a man that's born again of the spirit of God knows exactly where he's at that's right nothing phases him because something inside of him has already witnessed somebody outside the Cloud Yonder by faith he sees him God gives us as adopted Sons and Daughters of God he gives us checkbook Authority think about that that your prayer can carry more weight with him than an angel of Heaven if in the natural somebody very capable handed you an empty checkbook and they signed their name at the bottom of every check and said here you go that'd be a reason to shout wouldn't it how much more but see whenever but anything you could ever write that check for would end in this life but yet the checkbook Authority the checkbook that God gives you you're going to Rejoice with your loved ones on the other side because some of you have written out a check for your prodigal some of you have written out a check for your parents so the checkbook of Heaven is actually benefited from all the way on the other side it's not just in the natural Jesus is everything he's our Prophet he's our priest and he's our King he's all three now Earthly Kings they were not not allowed to mix offices remember when Uzziah when he was a king and he was a good King but he got he he tried to he tried to push himself into the priest's office and got smitten with Leprosy remember David went to bring the Ark of the Lord and he was King but the word was supposed to be carried on the shoulders of Levites it always causes problems one day in Matthew 20 then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what wil thou think about this an audience with God and he's asking you what do you want what would you like for me to do for you she said unto him grant that these my two sons May sit the one on thy right hand and the other on thy left in thy kingdom and Jesus answered and said ye know not what you ask are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they said we are able and he said unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that that I am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father that's your place because in the Book of Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame overcame and him sit down with my father in his throne see he overcame brother Donnie and he sat down with his father in his throne and now he's going to give that same Dominion to you because you're in his will You're Going To Rule and reign with Jesus Christ remember in the beginning Adam and Eve were co-equal it's the fall that put the man in the position of headship but that's Godly headship not carnal I'm the boss kind of we'll put it I'll put it like this as it's been said before if a man ever says I wear the pants in this house there's a good chance he doesn't because true headship in the right kind of Union the wife loves to reverence her husband the husband loves to reverence or or loves on the wife as Christ does the church Jesus doesn't Jesus doesn't beat on his wife he loves her he nurtures her and she loves him oh the feeling to see each other is most definitely mutual we can't wait to see him but he can't wait to see you either he can't wait no doubt you know I can only imagine as he's as he said I've gone to prepare a place for you and he no doubt must be getting so excited I can't wait till my family comes home and they see everything I've done for them it's going to be wonderful Revelations 5:9 we'll begin to bring this to a close and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue people and nation and has made us see he has made us unto our God Kings and Priests amen and we shall reign on the earth in Revelations 10:8 and when the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now I want you to notice that John here represents the bride amen and John was told to go and take the book out of the mighty Angel's hand it wasn't out of the seventh angel messenger's hand it was the mighty Angel let's read it again and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth that's Jesus Christ God opened the book and he sent it to the revelations 10:7 Revelations 10:1 open the book to Revelations 10:7 so that we as Revelations 108 can know what belongs to us it is our inheritance no preacher can make you believe this message brother random the prophet messenger himself could not make you believe this message if he could he would have made all his friends believe brother Gabriel but he could only be a submitted vessel to preach the word that was given to him and now we stand on this side of the open book you know it's a blessing to be on this side of the Cross but think what a special blessing it is and what God really thought of you to have you live brother Randall on this side of the open book that we don't have to scratch our heads about anything but Christ Jesus Christ has completely come and made himself known Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever do we deserve it nope we're worthy of death but yet God came and we were in his mind and he wrote our name next to his before the foundation of the world and he came looking for us when we weren't looking for him it doesn't matter if you were raised in this message in in this church you're he still had to come for you in a special way you you still had to have your moment with him there's many people that were raised in this message and that are out in the world today but yet God's grace is kept you why because you belong to him amen let's stand to our feet the musicians will come I came across this story and sister Cassie could you play uh he said that I could go free I came across this story from the from the prophet and it really just spoke to my heart because no matter how long you've been a Christian we all can identify ourselves in this story a god of love and a god of Mercy that knew us before the foundation of the world and when we were yet sinners the Bible says Christ died for the ungodly it's a bit lengthy but I I I pray you stay with me here he said God's grace is like this let me tell you a story in ending God's grace is like this one time there was a mighty king and this mighty king had a son and it was his only son and one day a murderer killed that boy and through that Kingdom went the delegates hunting for that murderer they finally found that murder and when they found him they brought him back and imprisoned him and when they did a trial was set and a sentence was made oh it was a terrible thing he had murdered the King's son and he knowed what was coming to him they put him into inner cells they locked the doors they put pads on so no one the guards around it cuz we know what kind of a horrible punishment this boy was going to receive because he killed the King's son the Royal King's son guards were placed all around the doors he was put in Inner Cell stripped with nothing but a loin cloth on and there he was set in that condition starving wouldn't give him nothing to eat he was sitting there in that condition then they brought him out to a trial and he was found guilty and proven guilty a sentence was made that he would be executed under horrible capital punishment and he was to be killed by inches until his mortal life was gone sentenced by the judge he was ready to die and he begged and cried and said though I'm guilty though I'm guilty I'm sorry that I did it I wish I would have never done it I'm sorry I did it in a moment in a rage of temper I did it I didn't mean it that way one day the king went down to the place to visit the boy to tell him talk to him and tell him about killing his own son the only son he had he that had killed the boy and he said I'm going to go down and talk to him and when he went down there he looked back in that cage like a caged animal he saw his little skinny body laying back there in a corner crying his face all sunk in his jaw sank back his eyes way back matter was all in his eyes and his mouth was all Whited over no water thirsty laying back there on his face crying and the King said stand up and he come to him and looked at him and he said why did you kill my son why what did my son do to you why did he what did he do to Merit such a death as you killed him stabbing him with a spear he said nothing my Lord not one thing just my own impudence impudence just my own ways I killed him because I was jealous of him I got in a temper fit and I killed killed him and said now I'm to die under your Justice sir I realized that and I deserve to do it only thing I'm crying for that I'm just sorry that I killed that Royal man like that Without a Cause have you placed yourself in that [Music] story The King turned on his heels and walked out went out to the desk and said destroy all the records you know on the prophet said put them in the sea of forgetfulness destroy all the records wash them up clean them up I'll send down a robe for him after a while a great big limousine drove up to the door when it did a carpet was spread out to the prison cell the king stood at the end of the limousine said come my son and ride home with me to the Palace put the king's robe around his shoulder he said from henceforth you are my son because he had pity that's Grace that was me that was you we killed the Son of God with our sins we were alien dirty filthy laying in the cells of the world God washed us with the blood of his own son and cleansed us put on the robe of the Holy Spirit now the great Chariot of God will back up to the door someday and we'll go home to live with them all records are destroyed and we can't be
