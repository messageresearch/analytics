[53:20] how much we love you and have been
[53:21] praying for each and every one of you

[53:26] time we've had
[53:28] three funerals here or we'll have three
[53:30] funerals here in the last couple weeks

[53:32] it's a time in which you can't

[53:38] funerals as we
[53:39] as we would and pack it out and show our

[55:24] lord tonight
[55:26] father we come to you tonight in the
[55:28] name of our lord jesus christ
[55:31] lord there's none like you lord when
[55:34] we begin to worship lord the god of
[55:38] ages and begin to feel the anointing of
[55:41] the lord as you begin to
[55:43] just slip in the room and begin to touch
[55:46] lives
[55:48] lord we we know that when we're lifting
[55:50] our hands father that we're not lifting
[55:52] our hands to a man we're not
[55:54] lifting our our thoughts before others
[55:57] that they might see it but we're lifting
[55:59] it up to a god that cares the god that
[56:02] sees
[56:03] the god that understands a god that is
[56:06] that is never changing but is always the
[56:09] same
[56:11] and is more than able to do exceedingly
[56:14] abundantly above all that we could ever
[56:16] ask or think according to the power that
[56:18] works in us
[56:20] now father you see lord every person
[56:23] that is sitting here under the sound of
[56:24] our voice
[56:26] lord our half of our congregation can't
[56:29] be here tonight
[56:30] lord due to the circumstances of life
[56:33] but lord i pray that you would be god to
[56:35] them
[56:36] right where they are where they stream
[56:38] at where they're
[56:39] listening to this service i pray that
[56:42] you would
[56:42] pour out a supernatural blessing upon
[56:45] them
[56:46] lord you see the hands and you see the
[56:49] heart
[56:49] father we pray that you would come down
[56:52] in such a way
[56:53] and make yourself god to them to the
[56:55] kelly family
[56:57] we pray god that you would just show
[56:59] forth your compassion
[57:01] and let them know that you are the
[57:03] comforter of comforters
[57:05] now fathers we get ready to delve into
[57:07] the word of god we pray that you would
[57:10] anoint us like never before
[57:12] i've been studying on these things for
[57:14] quite some time lord and you finally
[57:16] allowed us to be able to
[57:18] to look at these things but father i
[57:20] know
[57:21] that that even the prophet would say
[57:23] that when he would get before the people
[57:24] that
[57:25] that he would think it would go a
[57:27] certain way and then it would go
[57:28] completely different because of the
[57:30] people's form
[57:31] now father you know what they are
[57:33] pulling for and what they need in their
[57:35] life
[57:37] lord that's something i do not but i do
[57:39] know this
[57:40] that the word of god is quick it's alive
[57:43] it's a sharp twitched
[57:45] sword and i pray that you would discern
[57:47] the very hearts
[57:49] lord even our pastor sitting here had a
[57:52] rough week this week dealing with
[57:54] the the the treatments of life and and
[57:57] the
[57:57] treatments of chemo and then dealing
[58:00] with his own blood sugar father
[58:02] i know tonight without a shadow of a
[58:04] doubt that you're a healer of that
[58:06] and i pray that you would be ever
[58:09] mindful of the need of the body lord our
[58:11] pastor lord we need him
[58:13] we need his strength we need his
[58:15] encouragement lord that he gives
[58:17] an endlessly lord and his so selfless

[58:23] gives out
[58:23] even when he don't feel good father even
[58:26] when he's sick father he stands behind
[58:28] this pulpit
[58:29] and i just pray that you be mindful of
[58:32] him tonight

[58:35] special way tonight and speak to us

[58:45] amen amen god bless you if you have your

[59:33] details but
[59:34] we're just happy to have brother charlie
[59:36] green here and
[59:37] if you haven't seen a miracle take a
[59:40] look at him tonight
[59:41] and uh he's he's a real miracle first
[59:45] samuel chapter 17
[59:46] and verse 56 and i'd like to speak to
[59:49] you tonight on
[59:50] on attached to the king
[59:53] attached to the king first samuel
[59:55] chapter 17 and verse 56 and we'll
[59:58] go right into first samuel chapter 18.
[1:00:01] that's right after chapter 17.
[1:00:05] and the king said inquire thou whose son
[1:00:08] the stripping is and as david returned
[1:00:12] from the slaughter of the philistine
[1:00:14] abner took him and brought him before
[1:00:17] saul
[1:00:17] with the head of the philistine in his
[1:00:19] hand
[1:00:20] and saul said to him whose son art thou
[1:00:24] thou young man and david answered i am
[1:00:27] the son of thy servant jesse
[1:00:30] the bethlehemite and i i like this
[1:00:34] i like this portion of reading because
[1:00:37] here we see
[1:00:38] as as as david is identifying himself
[1:00:41] here
[1:00:42] he's also got the head of his enemy
[1:00:45] right in his hand
[1:00:47] chapter 18 and it came to pass that that
[1:00:49] when he had made an end of speaking unto
[1:00:52] saul
[1:00:52] that that the soul of jonathan was
[1:00:55] knit with the soul of david and jonathan
[1:00:58] loved him as his own soul and saul
[1:01:01] took him that day and would let him go
[1:01:04] no more to his father's house
[1:01:07] then jonathan and david made a covenant
[1:01:09] because he loved him
[1:01:11] as his own soul notice the the
[1:01:14] connection
[1:01:15] and the attachment that these two have
[1:01:17] made
[1:01:18] and jonathan stripped himself of the
[1:01:21] robe that was upon him and gave it to
[1:01:23] david
[1:01:24] and his garments even to his sword
[1:01:27] and to his bow and to his girdle and
[1:01:30] david went out with us whoever saw
[1:01:33] sent him and behaved himself wisely and
[1:01:36] saul set him over the men of war and he
[1:01:39] was accepted in the sight of
[1:01:41] all the people and also in the sight
[1:01:44] of saul's servants may god bless his
[1:01:47] word you may be seated in the presence
[1:01:48] of the lord
[1:01:50] at last scripture reading in verse 5 is
[1:01:52] a very
[1:01:53] very astounding scripture as you look at
[1:01:55] it that david
[1:01:57] as saul set david over over the men of
[1:02:00] war
[1:02:01] and david was accepted in the sight of
[1:02:04] all the people and
[1:02:05] in the sight of all of saul's servants
[1:02:07] now if you
[1:02:08] you you know that if you being in the
[1:02:11] lineup of servants that
[1:02:13] that servant sometime they they work
[1:02:15] their way up as they go
[1:02:17] but david is immediately moved to a
[1:02:20] place
[1:02:21] of position in which he has placed over
[1:02:24] the men
[1:02:25] of war that that he being he being a
[1:02:28] leader in that day just from this
[1:02:30] one this one deal that that has just
[1:02:34] went down when he's holding
[1:02:35] the head of goliath in his hand and so
[1:02:39] we see that we we look at that
[1:02:41] attachment that jonathan
[1:02:44] and david have there and so we want to
[1:02:46] focus just on that for a moment but look
[1:02:49] with me at
[1:02:50] matthew chapter 27 and verse 35
[1:02:53] and they crucified him and parted his
[1:02:56] garments
[1:02:57] casting lots that it might be fulfilled
[1:03:00] which was spoken by the prophet
[1:03:02] that they they parted my garments among
[1:03:05] them and upon my vesture did they cast
[1:03:08] lots
[1:03:10] and sitting down they watched him there
[1:03:13] and set up over his head his accusation
[1:03:17] written
[1:03:18] this is jesus the king of the jews
[1:03:22] and here they they paid to him what they
[1:03:26] thought was a dishonor but this was the
[1:03:28] greatest compliment that they could set
[1:03:30] over
[1:03:31] jesus's head as they set this accusation
[1:03:34] above him
[1:03:36] here was our king here was
[1:03:39] here was the one that was the the giver
[1:03:42] of life and the
[1:03:44] the author of life and who the whole
[1:03:46] christian
[1:03:47] faith was in and here is set up that
[1:03:50] this is the king of the jews
[1:03:55] now in spiritual amnesia as the brothers
[1:03:57] have this quote
[1:03:59] he said now now to be a true christian
[1:04:01] you have to be the same
[1:04:03] we don't want to figure forget that all
[1:04:05] that he was i'm identified with him
[1:04:08] i'm identified with him notice he is in
[1:04:10] me and i
[1:04:11] and in him notice then every christian
[1:04:14] that's a real genuine
[1:04:15] christian was with him when the morning
[1:04:18] stars
[1:04:19] sang together and the sons of god
[1:04:21] shouted for joy before there was a
[1:04:23] foundation of the world
[1:04:25] we were identified in the immortal
[1:04:27] realms with god
[1:04:29] 10 million years before the world was
[1:04:31] ever formed
[1:04:32] i was back there with him if i've got
[1:04:35] eternal life
[1:04:36] i was there with him i was identified
[1:04:38] with him when the morning stars sang
[1:04:41] together and the sons of god shouted for
[1:04:43] joy
[1:04:44] i was with him when he called abraham at
[1:04:47] the age of 75 years old
[1:04:49] and his wife being 65 and told him that
[1:04:52] they were going to have a baby
[1:04:54] i was with him when he took his stand
[1:04:56] upon thus saith the lord
[1:04:58] and i'm going to have the baby i stood
[1:05:00] with him
[1:05:01] every other christian stood with him i
[1:05:04] was with him when
[1:05:05] when he when his temptations come i was
[1:05:08] with him when he was up on the mountain
[1:05:10] to offer up isaac i was with him when
[1:05:13] the ram appeared
[1:05:14] i was with joseph when he rejected when
[1:05:17] he was rejected of his brothers because
[1:05:19] of he was a spiritual and the rest of
[1:05:21] them was carnal
[1:05:23] i was with him when he know the reproach
[1:05:25] that he had to stand by his own brothers
[1:05:28] what he was i am what i am he was
[1:05:31] for we are all one in christ jesus i was
[1:05:34] with joseph in the cave
[1:05:36] and the grave i was with him when he
[1:05:38] went to the right hand of pharaoh
[1:05:40] you had to be identified with him i was
[1:05:42] with jacob that night when he wrestled
[1:05:44] all night with the angel
[1:05:46] i wrestled myself i know what he went
[1:05:49] through with
[1:05:50] so i wrestled with jacob the same time
[1:05:52] he did for i
[1:05:53] am his brother i was with moses when he
[1:05:56] went down into egypt i was with moses at
[1:05:59] that burning bush
[1:06:01] if you're a christian you're identified
[1:06:03] with him with the bible characters don't
[1:06:06] forget it i was with moses
[1:06:08] when all the people turned against him i
[1:06:10] was with moses when they crossed the red
[1:06:12] sea
[1:06:13] when he raised his hand and walked
[1:06:15] forward and the red sea opened
[1:06:17] i was identified in christ right then
[1:06:20] i was with moses at that hour what every
[1:06:23] christian has been what every believer
[1:06:26] has been
[1:06:27] every believer now is identified with
[1:06:29] that same person
[1:06:31] whatever it is you must be identified
[1:06:33] and don't forget that
[1:06:34] when you do you've got spiritual amnesia
[1:06:38] and you've forgotten who you are
[1:06:41] now identified with him with moses when
[1:06:44] he crossed the red sea
[1:06:46] i was with elijah in the days of ahab
[1:06:48] when they had to make a choice
[1:06:50] who they would serve god or balaam when
[1:06:52] he was with him on mount carmel
[1:06:55] when he had to make this choice for for
[1:06:57] we are identified in the body of the
[1:06:59] same god that he was identified in
[1:07:02] so if we're identified in that body then
[1:07:04] we must remember that
[1:07:06] we were with we were there with him
[1:07:08] that's right
[1:07:09] now i was with david when he was
[1:07:11] rejected by his own brethren i was with
[1:07:13] david and you were too
[1:07:16] if you're a christian you have to be
[1:07:19] identified in his rejection
[1:07:21] i was with the hebrew children in a
[1:07:23] fiery furnace
[1:07:24] when the fire couldn't burn them because
[1:07:26] the presence of the fourth man
[1:07:28] i was with daniel in the lines then i
[1:07:31] was identified there
[1:07:32] when elijah uh when the angel of the
[1:07:35] lord identified him in there
[1:07:37] and i was most surely with him at
[1:07:39] calvary
[1:07:40] i must be identified with him at calvary
[1:07:43] i must be there to a place that
[1:07:45] where not also was i identified with him
[1:07:48] at calvary
[1:07:49] i died with him at calvary every
[1:07:52] christian must die with him at calvary
[1:07:54] and if you don't die with him at calvary
[1:07:56] you can't be none of his
[1:07:58] i was there when he died i died with him
[1:08:02] and then i was with him when he raised
[1:08:05] up from the dead
[1:08:06] i came upon easter morning with him in
[1:08:09] the resurrection
[1:08:10] that whatever he did i was right there
[1:08:13] with him
[1:08:14] every believer was the same and now i
[1:08:17] am seated with him heavenly places in
[1:08:20] christ jesus
[1:08:21] with all powers of hell conquered
[1:08:24] through him
[1:08:25] every christian believer was seated the
[1:08:28] same way
[1:08:29] because you have to be identified
[1:08:35] are you identified with him it shows
[1:08:38] that there
[1:08:39] is an attachment when you can identify
[1:08:42] yourself
[1:08:43] with the king of kings and the lord of
[1:08:45] lords
[1:08:46] and when you go to thinking about all
[1:08:48] the connections of
[1:08:50] life that that have that have happened
[1:08:52] to every individual that is sitting here
[1:08:54] tonight
[1:08:55] you know every one of us have an
[1:08:57] attachment with somebody else that is
[1:08:59] sitting here
[1:09:00] and if it was not for the ministry in
[1:09:03] this last day
[1:09:04] we wouldn't be sitting here i would have
[1:09:07] never met my wife
[1:09:08] if it wasn't for the ministry of malachi
[1:09:11] 4. i would have never met
[1:09:12] brother nate green if it wasn't for the
[1:09:14] ministry
[1:09:15] of malachi 4. and you go to thinking
[1:09:18] about the attachments
[1:09:20] that are done and the connections that
[1:09:22] are made just
[1:09:23] because of this message and and you
[1:09:26] begin to identify yourself and begin to
[1:09:28] get in that channel
[1:09:30] of thinking that that you would not be a
[1:09:32] part of the
[1:09:33] the powerful ministry if it was not
[1:09:36] for the ministry of this last day when
[1:09:40] you go to thinking about the ministry of
[1:09:42] brother nathanael's grandfather brother
[1:09:44] henry and brother joe
[1:09:46] and you think about the connection that
[1:09:48] we as a church body has
[1:09:50] had with the green family it's all done
[1:09:53] because of an attachment with a message
[1:09:56] when you go to thinking about brother
[1:09:58] brady down there in jamaica and you
[1:10:00] begin to think about
[1:10:01] all the testimonies that we've shared
[1:10:03] throughout time
[1:10:04] it's all because of an attachment with a
[1:10:07] message
[1:10:08] in this day and thinking about great men
[1:10:10] like brother bisco
[1:10:11] and brother jackson and brother lawson
[1:10:14] and brother pruitt
[1:10:15] brother reagan and these great men you
[1:10:17] see we are all
[1:10:19] drawn according to this last day's
[1:10:22] message
[1:10:23] and we are attached by that message of
[1:10:26] the hour
[1:10:27] but you see we didn't attach ourselves
[1:10:29] to that we didn't
[1:10:30] we didn't make ourselves come to love
[1:10:32] one another or make us some group that
[1:10:34] we just identify ourself with
[1:10:36] but there is a gene seed of god that has
[1:10:40] attached us to this ministry in this day
[1:10:43] and if it was not for that gene seed of
[1:10:45] god
[1:10:46] you remember when brother branham was
[1:10:48] going through the trial of his life
[1:10:50] and and he was going there and sharon
[1:10:52] rose was dying and his wife had just
[1:10:54] died
[1:10:55] he said if it had not been for that new
[1:10:58] birth
[1:10:59] he said i would not know you and i would
[1:11:02] not be standing here
[1:11:04] but because the new birth held him in
[1:11:06] that hour
[1:11:07] when satan said when satan said
[1:11:10] god don't love you and and god surely
[1:11:13] can't be with you
[1:11:14] when he's taken all of these things away
[1:11:16] from him but you see that new birth
[1:11:19] held him in the moment of his trial
[1:11:22] you see that was the attachment that
[1:11:25] held him
[1:11:26] was that new birth and it is the only
[1:11:28] way that you will stand throughout
[1:11:30] laodicea
[1:11:31] is through the attachment to that new
[1:11:33] birth
[1:11:34] you see i am identified with the spencer
[1:11:37] family because of a birth
[1:11:39] i didn't join the spencer family
[1:11:42] i didn't join or i didn't shake their
[1:11:44] hands and say you know what brother ron
[1:11:46] i want to be your son
[1:11:48] i didn't shake his hand and get that but
[1:11:50] because
[1:11:51] of a betting ground and through the
[1:11:53] pressing out of a seed
[1:11:54] there was an attachment that every one
[1:11:57] of you have with your mother
[1:11:59] and your father you see it's it's it's a
[1:12:02] natural attachment that we have
[1:12:05] in life but when you go to looking at
[1:12:09] at that expression of that seed that
[1:12:11] comes forth
[1:12:13] you begin to look at the power of that
[1:12:15] seed
[1:12:16] now maybe you're just quiet because
[1:12:18] you're astounded by what i've just said
[1:12:21] okay but when you go to thinking about
[1:12:25] that seed and you begin to think about
[1:12:26] the connections
[1:12:28] of life and you think about david and
[1:12:30] jonathan and the friendship that they
[1:12:32] had
[1:12:33] built up and the bond that they had the
[1:12:35] bible says that their souls
[1:12:38] were knit together there was an
[1:12:40] attachment there and you look at
[1:12:42] jonathan's character
[1:12:44] as it's shown in the generous love of
[1:12:47] king david and the admiration that that
[1:12:51] jonathan had
[1:12:52] just because of this one deed
[1:12:57] i'd say that there's a lot of people
[1:12:59] that we've come in contact
[1:13:01] in life with that we have become
[1:13:04] attached
[1:13:05] by one deed by one word
[1:13:10] you can look at some of your friends and
[1:13:12] you can look at maybe a testimony that
[1:13:14] that while you're here and i think about
[1:13:16] sister mary vance that is here
[1:13:18] just because of one event just because a
[1:13:22] man of god
[1:13:23] walked into a long john silvers one time
[1:13:26] that whole family the vance family is
[1:13:29] setting here
[1:13:30] because of one deed that was done
[1:13:34] and we think sometimes that we're just
[1:13:36] going through the motions of life
[1:13:38] and you realize that god's got a greater
[1:13:41] purpose
[1:13:42] in all things that god's attaching his
[1:13:45] body
[1:13:46] with the headship in this hour and you
[1:13:49] think about that
[1:13:50] that because of the slaying of a giant
[1:13:53] brought about this connection
[1:13:55] between between jonathan
[1:13:58] and david what's going to happen when
[1:14:01] you slay your giant
[1:14:03] what a tonight what attachment what
[1:14:05] connection is going to happen
[1:14:07] when you look at the thing that has
[1:14:09] cursed
[1:14:10] all of the children at full gospel
[1:14:13] lighthouse and you go out there and say
[1:14:15] i am not going to allow you to allow you
[1:14:19] to condemn
[1:14:20] our army i'm not going to allow you to
[1:14:22] stand against our army
[1:14:24] what will the attachment and the
[1:14:26] connections of life be
[1:14:28] when you stand up to the giants in your
[1:14:31] life
[1:14:32] and you realize that the anointing that
[1:14:34] you have
[1:14:35] that he is your shield and he is your
[1:14:38] buckler
[1:14:39] that he has given you a weapon to take
[1:14:41] down your giants
[1:14:42] and watch the connections that are made
[1:14:45] in your life
[1:14:49] we're not looking there's there's some
[1:14:51] people that won't get anything i say but
[1:14:53] one word tonight
[1:14:55] and if all you get is one eternal word
[1:14:59] you have came and attached yourself
[1:15:02] to the word of god not to a man
[1:15:05] but to a word that will never fail when
[1:15:08] heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:15:10] this word will never pass away when
[1:15:12] there is
[1:15:13] no more cancer when there is no more
[1:15:16] death when there is no more covet
[1:15:18] you have attached yourself to a word of
[1:15:21] god
[1:15:23] that satan cannot defeat that satan
[1:15:26] cannot destroy
[1:15:28] because you attached yourself but look
[1:15:31] when you look at jonathan here jonathan
[1:15:33] was a king's son
[1:15:36] he was the son of a king but jonathan
[1:15:40] is attaching himself to the anointed
[1:15:43] king
[1:15:44] even when king saul swore that he would
[1:15:48] kill david
[1:15:50] when he throws the javelin at him when
[1:15:52] he when he when he does everything
[1:15:54] within his power
[1:15:55] and milka hides david in the bed and
[1:15:59] puts
[1:15:59] goat hair over the pillow to make them
[1:16:02] think that david's laying in the bed
[1:16:04] so that they can slay him but jonathan
[1:16:07] still attaches himself to the anointed
[1:16:10] king
[1:16:11] even though his own flesh and blood hate
[1:16:14] this man
[1:16:17] but you see there was something that was
[1:16:19] laying there
[1:16:21] that jonathan was attaching himself to
[1:16:24] you know there's some people i don't
[1:16:26] know if you know this or not but there's
[1:16:27] some people that think you're crazy
[1:16:30] because you have attached yourself to a
[1:16:32] ministry
[1:16:35] you they they think well them people
[1:16:37] down there full gospel lighthouse they
[1:16:39] think there's something
[1:16:42] well why shouldn't we
[1:16:46] i heard a voice from another world that
[1:16:49] has told me
[1:16:50] that this world is not my home and i'm
[1:16:53] just a passing through
[1:16:55] i'm not staying here for the tribulation
[1:16:58] i ought to know exactly where i'm going
[1:17:02] because a word showed me so
[1:17:07] you see before david ever stepped into
[1:17:09] the role when he looked like a shepherd
[1:17:11] yea he was a shepherd
[1:17:13] when he dressed like a shepherd because
[1:17:14] he was a shepherd
[1:17:16] though he though he was identified as a
[1:17:18] shepherd
[1:17:20] dressed like a shepherd smelt like a
[1:17:22] shepherd
[1:17:26] he was still god's anointed
[1:17:30] king before the world began
[1:17:33] when everybody else was standing in
[1:17:35] front of david
[1:17:36] and they looked more like a king david
[1:17:39] was still king
[1:17:41] when the church world looked a whole lot
[1:17:43] better when esau looked a whole lot
[1:17:45] better
[1:17:46] there was a promise that was already
[1:17:48] spoken
[1:17:50] jacob i have loved and esau i have hated
[1:17:54] and when samuel went to anoint the next
[1:17:57] king
[1:17:58] of israel that he goes before him
[1:18:01] and the spirit of the lord tells him
[1:18:05] not to look upon the countenance
[1:18:08] of the man you see
[1:18:12] seven other brothers stand in front of
[1:18:14] samuel
[1:18:15] but there was one thing that couldn't
[1:18:17] happen that
[1:18:18] oil that was in that jar could not be
[1:18:21] poured out
[1:18:24] there was a lot of people that look more
[1:18:27] like the real thing
[1:18:29] there was some more people that maybe
[1:18:32] had to dress
[1:18:33] right maybe they had everything just in
[1:18:37] order
[1:18:37] and it looked like you know what they
[1:18:40] are the real deal i want to tell you
[1:18:43] do not look at what you see
[1:18:47] because i can tell you there are some
[1:18:48] books that will they will mess you up by
[1:18:51] just looking at the outside of it
[1:18:54] i don't know about you i've bought some
[1:18:56] books because i thought they were
[1:18:57] picture books but when i got there they
[1:18:59] wasn't one picture in there
[1:19:01] and there's a lot of people that dress
[1:19:04] themself up
[1:19:05] like a picture book but when you open it
[1:19:07] it ain't nothing in there to look at
[1:19:14] hallelujah but seven other brothers
[1:19:16] stand before him
[1:19:18] stand before the anointed prophet and
[1:19:22] samuel noticed samuel would have been
[1:19:25] willing
[1:19:26] to pour the oil out if it wasn't for a
[1:19:29] voice
[1:19:31] there's a lot of times that that people
[1:19:33] get fooled
[1:19:35] by the way that you look or by the way
[1:19:38] that other people dress or at
[1:19:40] themself but god knew that the oil
[1:19:43] couldn't be
[1:19:44] poured out upon one person and samuel
[1:19:48] said
[1:19:48] is there not anybody else here
[1:19:51] he said i got a son but he's back there
[1:19:54] on the backside
[1:19:55] of a mountain hurting my sheep what was
[1:19:58] he doing
[1:19:58] he was doing everything that god had
[1:20:01] ordained him to be
[1:20:03] him hurting those sheep was teaching him
[1:20:06] how to sing songs on the backside of a
[1:20:08] desert
[1:20:09] him sitting back there as a shepherd
[1:20:12] watching those sheep
[1:20:13] as they would grow as they would graze
[1:20:15] in those green
[1:20:16] pastures it would bring out things of
[1:20:19] the eternal
[1:20:20] that we will still read even today
[1:20:24] you see god was molding david
[1:20:28] into the man that he had destined him to
[1:20:31] be
[1:20:33] samuel said i will not pour the oil i
[1:20:36] will not set down
[1:20:38] until the black until the lad comes
[1:20:41] here comes this ruddy looking fella
[1:20:46] didn't look like nobody but yet
[1:20:50] in whose mind would have thought
[1:20:53] that this would be the next king of
[1:20:56] israel
[1:20:57] but god so let me
[1:21:01] let me just attach you with this salt
[1:21:03] just for a moment
[1:21:05] who would have thought that you would
[1:21:07] have been the bride of jesus christ
[1:21:09] but god when the church world when your
[1:21:13] friends
[1:21:14] denied you from being a real believer
[1:21:17] but god thought something of you when
[1:21:20] satan thought there's no way
[1:21:23] that they could ever be what god has
[1:21:25] qualified
[1:21:26] or selected to be in this day but god
[1:21:30] but god when you was trumped down and
[1:21:33] apart
[1:21:33] but god it's not the life that you once
[1:21:37] lived but the life that i now
[1:21:40] live
[1:21:42] there you're not attached to the old man
[1:21:46] you're attached to the new man
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:55] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:04] maybe jonathan couldn't understand why
[1:22:07] he was attaching himself
[1:22:10] to this this man that his own daddy
[1:22:13] wanted to kill
[1:22:16] maybe he couldn't understand why he was
[1:22:19] what's drawn to this man but yet
[1:22:22] he he felt this attachment
[1:22:26] he felt this pull to to
[1:22:29] to knit himself in his own soul that
[1:22:32] they
[1:22:32] knit themselves together because
[1:22:35] of an eternal quality that was laying
[1:22:38] there
[1:22:41] you know there's some times in life that
[1:22:43] you don't even
[1:22:44] you don't even realize you know you ever
[1:22:46] been around somebody that
[1:22:48] you don't know why you're attracted to
[1:22:50] them or you don't know why
[1:22:52] you're attaching yourself to them but
[1:22:54] you just know that
[1:22:55] by yourself attaching let me let me make
[1:22:58] it personal by myself attaching myself
[1:23:00] to brother shannon or attaching myself
[1:23:02] to brother danny or any of
[1:23:04] these other brothers and sisters when i
[1:23:06] attach myself to them
[1:23:08] i know it's going to be a benefit for me
[1:23:11] let me give it to some of you
[1:23:13] business-minded people
[1:23:15] that that there's some re there's
[1:23:16] sometimes that you you'll just look at
[1:23:19] you'll look in an account and you'll say
[1:23:20] i'm not going to attach myself to that
[1:23:22] because
[1:23:23] they're either going to drag me down or
[1:23:25] put me in a hole but then there's
[1:23:26] sometimes that you'll look at an account
[1:23:28] or
[1:23:29] you'll look at a business and say now
[1:23:31] i'm going to attach myself to this
[1:23:34] because they're going to be a benefit to
[1:23:36] me
[1:23:37] in business you're hoping that they make
[1:23:40] your wallet just a little bit thicker
[1:23:43] and when when a business is not
[1:23:46] when it's not gaining you anything it's
[1:23:48] time to release that thing
[1:23:52] now i've got your attention i have
[1:23:54] talked to your heartbeat
[1:23:58] but when you go to attaching yourself to
[1:24:02] people that are nobodies
[1:24:04] to people that'll never be good enough
[1:24:09] you're attaching yourself to somebody
[1:24:12] that'll never make it
[1:24:14] but if you go to attaching yourself to
[1:24:17] somebody like
[1:24:18] jonathan was attaching himself to he was
[1:24:21] not attaching himself to a mistake
[1:24:24] he was not attaching himself to a
[1:24:26] wannabe
[1:24:27] he was not attaching himself to a phony
[1:24:30] he was attaching himself
[1:24:32] because he's seen the benefit of who
[1:24:35] david was
[1:24:38] hallelujah when you go to reading in
[1:24:40] first samuel 19 and 20 and you look at
[1:24:42] the hatred and the jealousy that was in
[1:24:45] saul's heart towards david
[1:24:49] it would make you wonder
[1:24:53] if brother adam attached himself to me
[1:24:57] and brother out and hated me it would
[1:25:01] make you wonder
[1:25:03] why why would flesh and blood
[1:25:08] be so perplexing and be so opposite
[1:25:12] in the matter and here jonathan
[1:25:16] he'd watch saul when he was anointed
[1:25:19] king
[1:25:20] he watched him as he was there in his
[1:25:22] glory as a king
[1:25:24] but then he watched that anointing leave
[1:25:26] saul and saul become
[1:25:28] tormented and evil spirits come and evil
[1:25:31] spirits would
[1:25:32] would drive him insane and they had to
[1:25:35] have a little bitty boy
[1:25:37] that nobody would have picked that this
[1:25:39] would be the man
[1:25:41] that would that would calm the troubled
[1:25:44] waters
[1:25:44] that were around saul and drive away
[1:25:46] those evil spirits
[1:25:50] but jonathan watched as the anointing
[1:25:54] left his father and the anointing was
[1:25:57] upon
[1:25:58] this man david
[1:26:04] young people you must watch who you
[1:26:06] attach yourself to
[1:26:08] if you're attaching yourself to phonies
[1:26:11] if you're attaching yourself to carnal
[1:26:13] impersonators
[1:26:14] you better watch who you're attaching
[1:26:17] yourself
[1:26:17] to because it's going to lead you down
[1:26:20] some wrong
[1:26:21] wrong long wrong long roads
[1:26:27] trust me
[1:26:31] you see if you're attaching yourself to
[1:26:33] people that are always causing
[1:26:35] you trouble if you're attaching yourself
[1:26:37] to people that are always
[1:26:39] that is always bringing your spirit down
[1:26:41] if you're attaching yourself to somebody
[1:26:44] that that you can't feed on their spirit
[1:26:46] or you can't
[1:26:47] you can't get anything supernatural from
[1:26:49] their spirit
[1:26:50] you need to detach yourself from that
[1:26:52] person
[1:26:53] if they're not bringing you closer to
[1:26:55] christ they are not your friends
[1:26:58] they are not being a benefit to you but
[1:27:00] if you can attach yourself to somebody
[1:27:04] and and attach yourself to an anointing
[1:27:06] that is upon a body
[1:27:08] it'll lead you into green pastures it'll
[1:27:11] lead you to a relationship
[1:27:13] that will grow in christian love
[1:27:19] if you're attaching yourself to a bunch
[1:27:21] of chickens instead of eagles you need
[1:27:23] to watch your anointing
[1:27:26] are you with me because if you're
[1:27:28] attaching yourself to those kind of
[1:27:30] people that are bringing you down
[1:27:32] drawing the life out of you i know y'all
[1:27:35] don't know anybody like that
[1:27:37] they just man they sap your energy they
[1:27:39] take away your atmosphere you sing all
[1:27:41] day and all of a sudden
[1:27:42] you get around that person one good time
[1:27:46] lord have mercy you in a bad mood for
[1:27:49] two weeks
[1:27:50] you need to detach yourself from that
[1:27:53] person
[1:27:55] are you with me if they are driving your
[1:27:58] spirit to the ground
[1:28:00] you need to watch you have attached
[1:28:02] yourself
[1:28:03] maybe with a false anointed one instead
[1:28:06] of the true anointed one
[1:28:09] i can tell you this i've been places in
[1:28:11] the ministry been around the world
[1:28:13] places
[1:28:14] throughout the nation and every time you
[1:28:16] meet a real
[1:28:17] son and daughter of god they have that
[1:28:20] spirit like you've known them
[1:28:22] all of your life
[1:28:25] but you meet some people and you're
[1:28:27] thinking my lord have they been a child
[1:28:29] of the devil all their life
[1:28:31] what happened to them
[1:28:34] better not ask they might give you a
[1:28:36] full story
[1:28:40] hello
[1:28:43] now notice
[1:28:46] when brother branham is there in wisdom
[1:28:49] versus faith
[1:28:51] he he begins to make some some comments
[1:28:55] and dealing with two wires and as soon
[1:28:58] as i
[1:28:58] go into these things you'll remember if
[1:29:00] you're very familiar and a student of
[1:29:02] the message but
[1:29:04] but he'll make these statements about
[1:29:06] two wires that they
[1:29:07] they can look just they can look just
[1:29:09] alike but one of them's got the dynamo
[1:29:10] and one ain't
[1:29:12] and you know that we have got to connect
[1:29:15] ourself to the word of god we've got to
[1:29:18] attach ourselves to it because
[1:29:20] everything else is
[1:29:21] it's fleeting and failing and life is
[1:29:24] just but a vapor
[1:29:25] and if we don't attach ourselves to
[1:29:27] something eternal
[1:29:29] what have you done in your life
[1:29:32] but notice when the random would said
[1:29:34] that jesus
[1:29:35] that when satan hit jesus he hit that
[1:29:39] hundred billion vote
[1:29:40] that hundred billion vote wire right
[1:29:42] there and he would go on to say that as
[1:29:45] soon as he hit him
[1:29:46] he flew off a lot faster than when he
[1:29:49] flew on
[1:29:51] he said now remember satan had a wire
[1:29:53] too but no matter how nice that copper
[1:29:56] the wire is it hasn't got no life in it
[1:29:59] it's dead she won't act that same wire
[1:30:01] one has got energized from the dynamo
[1:30:03] and the other one has no connection at
[1:30:05] all
[1:30:06] that's the reason that's the reason
[1:30:09] it'll work
[1:30:10] in a predestinated vessel that's the
[1:30:13] reason the word will work
[1:30:15] where it's connected connected where
[1:30:18] with the denomination
[1:30:19] no sir that's a dead socket having a
[1:30:21] form of godliness
[1:30:22] and denying the power thereof but
[1:30:25] connected with the word
[1:30:26] which shall never pass away and can
[1:30:29] produce
[1:30:30] the same power that he had that's where
[1:30:33] it at
[1:30:36] if you just realize the power of that
[1:30:38] one statement
[1:30:40] that here brother adam has said that
[1:30:42] that when he hit jesus
[1:30:44] he hit a hundred billion vote wire
[1:30:47] but when there is a connection it'll
[1:30:50] produce the same power
[1:30:53] when you connect yourself to jesus he's
[1:30:56] not going to drag you down
[1:30:58] he's going to lift you up when you
[1:31:00] connect yourself to jesus he's not going
[1:31:02] to make you sick
[1:31:03] he's going to make you whole when you
[1:31:05] attach yourself to jesus
[1:31:07] he's going to produce on the inside of
[1:31:09] you the same power
[1:31:11] same life same works same wonders
[1:31:17] because of a connection
[1:31:22] and it will only work in a predestinated
[1:31:24] vessel
[1:31:25] deuteronomy 7 and 6 for thou art and
[1:31:27] holy people under the lord thy god the
[1:31:29] lord
[1:31:30] thy god hath chosen thee to be a
[1:31:33] special people unto himself above all
[1:31:35] people that upon the face of the earth
[1:31:38] the lord did not set his love upon you
[1:31:40] nor choose you because you were more in
[1:31:42] number than any people
[1:31:44] for you were the fewest of all people
[1:31:47] but because the lord loved you
[1:31:49] and because he would keep the oath which
[1:31:52] he had sworn unto your fathers
[1:31:54] half the lord brought you out with a
[1:31:56] mighty hand and redeemed you out of the
[1:31:57] house of bond men
[1:31:59] from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt
[1:32:02] deuteronomy 10 and 15 only
[1:32:05] the lord had delighted my fathers to
[1:32:08] love them
[1:32:09] and he chose their seed after them even
[1:32:13] you above all people
[1:32:16] as it is this day
[1:32:20] ephesians 1 and 3 blessed be the god
[1:32:25] and father of our lord jesus christ who
[1:32:28] hath
[1:32:28] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:32:31] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:32:34] according as he have chosen us in him
[1:32:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:32:38] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:32:41] before him in love
[1:32:44] having predestinated us say it through
[1:32:46] your mass to your neighbor
[1:32:48] having predestinated us under the
[1:32:51] adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:32:54] to himself according to the good
[1:32:56] pleasure
[1:32:57] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:33:01] of his grace
[1:33:02] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:33:05] beloved
[1:33:06] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:33:09] blood
[1:33:10] the forgiveness of sins according
[1:33:14] to the riches of his grace
[1:33:17] to his grace now it says that he hath
[1:33:21] chosen us
[1:33:23] in him jesus before the foundation of
[1:33:26] the world that means that
[1:33:28] that we were right there with him in the
[1:33:30] mind and thoughts of god before the
[1:33:32] foundation of the world
[1:33:33] that gives an eternal equal eternal
[1:33:37] quality
[1:33:38] to the elect you can't get away from
[1:33:40] that
[1:33:41] now notice he says now let me inject a
[1:33:43] thought in here
[1:33:44] even our natural birth is based upon
[1:33:46] election
[1:33:47] the female ovaries produce many many
[1:33:50] eggs
[1:33:50] but why is it that at a certain time
[1:33:54] and a certain egg comes down and not
[1:33:56] another one
[1:33:57] and then amongst the male sperm for no
[1:34:00] known reason
[1:34:01] a certain germ attaches itself to that
[1:34:04] egg
[1:34:04] while others that could have just easily
[1:34:07] attached himself
[1:34:08] or had a better opportunity to do so did
[1:34:11] not do so in paris
[1:34:14] there is an intelligence behind all of
[1:34:17] this
[1:34:18] otherwise what determines whether the
[1:34:20] baby is a boy or a girl
[1:34:22] blonde or brunette light or dark type of
[1:34:25] eyes etc
[1:34:27] i'd say that if i could have had my
[1:34:30] choice
[1:34:32] that i would made sure that none of the
[1:34:35] girls carried any of my characteristics
[1:34:40] but i didn't have a choice in the matter
[1:34:43] you see there is a dna attachment
[1:34:47] that even though i heard stories all of
[1:34:50] my life
[1:34:52] about how andrew was
[1:34:56] that mental child syndrome that that red
[1:34:59] head
[1:35:00] deal just a little bit of extra fire
[1:35:05] on top of it all but there were things
[1:35:09] that i thought that i could stop
[1:35:12] by being a good parent
[1:35:17] by being a real
[1:35:20] man but i passed it right on down
[1:35:25] to two little girls
[1:35:29] now they may be female in type but you
[1:35:32] watch that little girl right there ali
[1:35:34] and you'll see me
[1:35:38] 30 some years ago well 9 30 ain't that
[1:35:41] old
[1:35:42] 29 some years ago
[1:35:46] get this baby right katie told me when i
[1:35:48] turned 30 that i had to grow up i keep
[1:35:50] pushing it back
[1:35:51] but if you watch how that there are
[1:35:54] things in qualities in ally's life
[1:35:57] because
[1:35:58] of that dna code and the dna markers
[1:36:01] that are passed down
[1:36:03] that she's attached to me
[1:36:06] in this temporal life she could
[1:36:10] jump off a bus and land on her feet
[1:36:17] hurt herself every day and think
[1:36:22] what happened where was my parenting
[1:36:25] skills at
[1:36:26] i thought that i'd read all those books
[1:36:28] on parents
[1:36:30] for dummies learn all about it
[1:36:34] fix all the problems get it out the
[1:36:37] system i thought i got it all out the
[1:36:39] system 29 years ago
[1:36:42] but it passed down
[1:36:45] and you're going to watching that little
[1:36:47] girl and you're watching little reagan
[1:36:49] you watch little alley and they'll carry
[1:36:51] those
[1:36:52] characteristics because of the
[1:36:55] attachment of life
[1:36:58] and you go to thinking about those
[1:37:00] things
[1:37:02] and you see that that there is something
[1:37:05] that is
[1:37:05] that is that is testifying of a
[1:37:08] different world
[1:37:10] that there is an attachment between
[1:37:12] father
[1:37:13] and his children that that though
[1:37:17] he he tried though though satan tried
[1:37:20] his worth
[1:37:21] to try to push it all out and tried to
[1:37:24] stop
[1:37:25] it he still couldn't stop you brother
[1:37:28] nathanael
[1:37:29] from producing christ he tried his very
[1:37:32] best to offer you
[1:37:34] cigarettes or offer you life or offer
[1:37:36] you this out here
[1:37:37] but you still are connected through a
[1:37:41] birth and you can only push out
[1:37:43] what you are
[1:37:47] oh hallelujah you see when you go to
[1:37:50] looking at when they started putting a
[1:37:51] crown of thorns on jesus's head
[1:37:54] when they begin to mock him and they
[1:37:56] begin to strip his clothes off of him
[1:37:58] and put on put on that scarlet robe
[1:38:01] around
[1:38:02] him and mock him and say hell king of
[1:38:04] the jews
[1:38:06] satan never would have allowed that to
[1:38:09] happen
[1:38:10] if he knew that your sins were connected
[1:38:12] to this man
[1:38:14] he would have never allowed this to
[1:38:16] happen if he knew that your healing was
[1:38:18] connected to this king
[1:38:19] he would have never beat him if he knew
[1:38:22] that your joy was connected to this king
[1:38:25] he would have never put him on a cross
[1:38:27] if he knew that eternal life
[1:38:29] was attached to that king
[1:38:32] oh but satan's so stupid he thinks
[1:38:36] he thinks he stopped it but he never has
[1:38:39] stopped it
[1:38:39] and he never will stop it
[1:38:43] you can hang him on a cross you can put
[1:38:45] him in a grave
[1:38:46] you can seal it with a roman seal but
[1:38:49] you can't stop the life of god
[1:38:55] because of an attachment
[1:38:59] that was passed down
[1:39:03] through seed before time began
[1:39:08] that gene seed of god would come forth
[1:39:14] and we as parents we try to think about
[1:39:16] all the things
[1:39:18] that we could keep our children from
[1:39:22] is that true parents
[1:39:26] again you must be astounded by what i've
[1:39:28] said
[1:39:30] we try to keep our children from these
[1:39:33] things
[1:39:35] because that's what we are
[1:39:39] how about father when he knows that
[1:39:45] if you do this
[1:39:48] don't touch that wet paint you're going
[1:39:52] to get
[1:39:52] pain on your finger how many times has
[1:39:55] he
[1:39:56] tried his very best to try to stop you
[1:40:00] from
[1:40:00] going this direction
[1:40:03] and you find out
[1:40:07] i thought i felt a little nudged to go
[1:40:08] the other way
[1:40:10] but because of my own selfish will
[1:40:13] it pushed me down the road
[1:40:17] that made me look back to him
[1:40:22] you try your very best to keep them from
[1:40:28] doing the same things that you did
[1:40:31] you try your very best
[1:40:34] i'm not making a way for sin right here
[1:40:36] at all
[1:40:39] and i'm not saying and trust me and i
[1:40:41] don't want you going down that avenue or
[1:40:43] thinking well
[1:40:44] well i've got to sow my wild oats or
[1:40:46] i've got to do these things so that i
[1:40:48] can have a testimony
[1:40:50] wherever you hear those things that came
[1:40:53] from the pit of hell
[1:40:55] i believe that you can have an
[1:40:57] overcoming life
[1:40:58] and never go out on the devil's
[1:41:00] territory
[1:41:02] you ain't gotta have you ain't gotta
[1:41:03] smoke one one
[1:41:05] cigarette you ain't gotta take one drink
[1:41:07] of alcohol
[1:41:08] you ain't gotta dabble in drugs just to
[1:41:10] have a testimony
[1:41:12] you can have a testimony setting right
[1:41:15] here in the house of god though you
[1:41:17] never got tempted by the things of the
[1:41:20] by the world and went out there and
[1:41:22] danced and went out there and parted in
[1:41:24] those things
[1:41:24] if you overcame your unbelief
[1:41:28] you have a testimony that'll shake hell
[1:41:31] to its core
[1:41:33] that there is a power that has attached
[1:41:35] itself to you
[1:41:38] but god is trying to keep you from
[1:41:41] delving into those things
[1:41:46] so many times i look at the things that
[1:41:48] that i went through
[1:41:50] and i try to relate to these young
[1:41:52] people and try to tell them about these
[1:41:54] things
[1:41:56] just so they know that they can point to
[1:41:59] somebody
[1:42:00] that got attached by a birth to a
[1:42:04] kingship
[1:42:05] that they can attach to that there is
[1:42:08] overcoming
[1:42:09] power in the name of jesus christ that
[1:42:12] even though they might have walked into
[1:42:14] a valley
[1:42:15] they can come out of that valley that
[1:42:17] even though that
[1:42:18] they got entrapped by sin they can get
[1:42:20] out of that
[1:42:23] there's a blood hallelujah that's
[1:42:26] greater than all the sin
[1:42:28] of the world you see if there was not an
[1:42:31] attachment between esther and king of
[1:42:34] hazaresse
[1:42:35] she would have died to death when she
[1:42:37] walked into his courts
[1:42:39] uninvited but because the king
[1:42:43] loved her and there was an attachment
[1:42:45] there
[1:42:47] the king extended his scepter
[1:42:51] oh hallelujah that even though you may
[1:42:54] have walked in here and you may have
[1:42:56] felt like you was uninvited
[1:42:58] there is a blood that has caused an
[1:43:01] attraction
[1:43:02] and an attachment to this headship
[1:43:08] hallelujah
[1:43:11] there is a waymaker and he is a god
[1:43:15] that if you just connect yourself to in
[1:43:18] this life
[1:43:19] that he will be he will be your god in
[1:43:24] life
[1:43:26] he'll take you down roads
[1:43:29] only that lead to him
[1:43:35] we go to thinking about you go to
[1:43:37] thinking about all our lost loved ones
[1:43:39] and we go to thinking about
[1:43:40] everyone that's went across the chasm of
[1:43:43] time
[1:43:43] and you go to thinking about when you go
[1:43:45] to thinking about great men
[1:43:47] of pillars like brother homer and
[1:43:48] brother harold blair
[1:43:50] and sister virginia wilson brother john
[1:43:52] kelly and you go to thinking about those
[1:43:54] men
[1:43:55] you begin to think about their legacy
[1:43:57] and you begin to think about who they
[1:43:58] were
[1:44:00] there's got to be somebody that steps
[1:44:04] up because god has got to have a
[1:44:08] testimony
[1:44:09] that there is a body on earth that is
[1:44:12] attached to a headship
[1:44:14] that will only express his mind
[1:44:22] stand with me
[1:44:29] god knows your future
[1:44:34] some people are always haunted about
[1:44:35] their past
[1:44:38] they're always haunted about what they
[1:44:40] did
[1:44:42] surely if he's god and he knows about
[1:44:44] your past
[1:44:47] what about your future
[1:44:50] what's your future going to be like
[1:44:53] what's your life going to be like
[1:44:55] surely he knows your future he knew all
[1:44:58] about david
[1:44:59] before david was ever birthed there in
[1:45:02] here on the earth
[1:45:04] but he knew that david would be king
[1:45:07] and out of david's loins would come
[1:45:11] the son of david the royal seed
[1:45:15] what are you carrying
[1:45:18] in your life
[1:45:22] what expression is going to be made
[1:45:25] what's attached what testimony is
[1:45:27] attached
[1:45:28] to your life
