who's been here before him and his wife have sought the lord for a baby a child of their own for 16 years forgive me if i get a little emotional but just last week they announced actually last saturday they announced that they are expecting a child after 16 years so i just want to tell you this evening if you've been praying for something for a long time don't give up don't give out and don't give in just keep keep holding on to the promises 16 years they waited brother dwayne said i was prepared to wait to 25 like abraham did but i'm thankful i didn't have to but i just wanted to share that little faith-building testimony this morning it's amazing god uses medicine you know we some people fight the doctors and don't want to don't want to do do what they're supposed to do but god uses medicine to help us and we're just thankful for that miracle there at home my goodness when brother dwayne announced that on sunday we had church and i'm expecting no less tonight not just

evening amen let's just approach our heavenly father just now father we come before you as your children and lord what a privilege it is for us as your children to come before a faithful high priest who makes intercession upon our confession and lord we're so thankful father that we have lived to see another thanksgiving lord jesus to come through this time where we begin to give thanks father but as for a christian it's not just for a day it's not just for a week but father we give thanks unto you every time that we enter into your courts with praise we enter in with thanksgiving on our heart and father lord we we're just so grateful for what you are doing in our midst lord it seems like daily we begin to count all of the benefits that you have loaded us with lord we begin to think about how that you blessed us and you kept us lord and we just begin to praise you from the depths of our soul and father we ask lord tonight as as you would come and stand behind this pulpit and begin to bring forth the word of life i would ask lord that you would begin to minister to your children lord on their needs on their on their hearts desires i ask father that you would begin to make yourself known in a very special way to them lord that they might recognize that it has been you that has been speaking unto them you see their hands you see their hearts lord you see their efforts for being here i pray you bless them in the name of the lord jesus christ as we get ourself out of the way lord i pray you use us like never before in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in psalms chapter 63 and then revelations chapter two man psalms chapter 63. a psalm of david when he was in the wilderness of judah oh god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus i will bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name revelations chapter 2 and verse 7. notice this is this is in the ephesian church age but this is not just to the ephesian church age this is to every church age notice this reward to the overcomer amen let's just read it together this evening revelations chapter 2 and 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to ede of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to take my my text tonight from this scripture on giving rights to the tree of life and if you begin to look at that that word give it has the meaning of grant to deliver to bestow and to bring forth and certainly we can go over and we can certainly begin to thank the lord for what he has given us in this life he's given us health he's given us abilities he's given us he's given us time he's given us finances he's given us one another he's given us a a wonderful church building that we can serve him and worship him in and there's so many things that we could begin to thank him for what he has given us in this life but the most precious thing that we could thank the lord jesus christ for is life itself the ability to know him and the power of his resurrection that is life and we could sit here and begin to think and reflect upon what life has meant to some people and what life means to the christian and to a christian life is the lord jesus christ and outside of the lord jesus christ there really is no life but we know that that that our lord has given us great things he has given us his word he has given us his power he has given us his spirit and the bible tells us that the in second in second timothy in 3 and 16 that all scripture is given if you have your bibles just keep them handy we'll go through some scriptures here this at the beginning of the service this evening that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and it is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and for instruction in righteousness and we realize that an inspiration if you go to studying out the word that it means the the breath the breath of god and and we realize that the bible teaches us and tells us that the very world that we live on the world was was framed by the very word of god and and the word of god is formed by god's own breath and when a man begins to speak it is his life's breath that begins to form his words and when god begins to speak through humanity it is the life of god or the holy ghost forming his words as that man or that or that minister begins to speak as god's holy oracle it is the very breath of god that is breathing out the very word of god and that's what you identify and you begin to pull upon the gift of god and god will breathe over top of your situation or he'll breathe over your life and he will give you of himself once again or he'll give you healing or he'll he'll give you he'll give you different things or different things that that are laid out in the scriptures there are things that are laid there but when the inspiration of the holy ghost can begin to move across the congregation and you watch that that it's not the man but it's the it's the inspiration of almighty god and you could be sitting here you know all the scriptures you you know and you might be sickened by it you might have a different need and you know all the scriptures you have all the faith in the world you could sit there and they could say there's no sin in your life but yet what you're needing is the inspiration of almighty god to come and to quicken that word to life to make it alive to you to see that it's more than just a scripture of days gone by or maybe necessarily just the inspiration of god to come and to step in and to come and elevate your faith or take you into another level it's the inspiration of god that begins to give you to give you those things that are laying there in his word and notice what the bible said in isaiah and six that for unto us a a child is born and unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counsel or the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace so we recognize right away that god has given us something but more more than just recognizing in the scripture but we look here and see that this was given by by a man that necessarily didn't understand what he was saying he didn't necessarily maybe grasp by isaiah when the inspiration of god would come and move over across him and he would speak these things but notice there's more than just a sun in the picture but there is a people that is in the picture that is there to receive that which he has given and you look and you see that god had a certain time in a certain season that he would deliver this word to a people that were ready to receive it and notice when jesus begins to begins to take them through matthew 13 when he begins to take them through the spoken word is the original seed and he takes them through the seed chapter and he begins to speak to them about the parable of the sower and then the man that came through there in a dark clothe and he came through there and he sold out tares and different things but notice what when jesus is laying out when he's laying out the foundations of what the seed is there he begins to teach them about the seed some fell by the wayside some fell on stony ground but some fell in fertile ground and jesus began to tell them that he that hath an ear let him hear and when when his disciples came to him they began to ask him said now why are you talking in these riddles why are you talking to the people why are you talking to them like this why are you talking to them in parables and notice what jesus would say he said to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to them it is not given you see you have been granted as an overcomer in the day that you're living in for it is for a select people that can walk in the light and know that he is in the light but notice blessed are your eyes for you see and blessed are your ears for you here are you with me this evening but notice what the bible says in romans 8 and 31 that what shall we say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us how shall he not with him also also freely give us all things amen can you read that with me how how shall he not with him also freely give us all things he has granted us access to the one and the true and living god and when brother branham would say that when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost he said that you have everything everything that you have need of in this life's journey was given to you when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost and you remind i'll just remind you just for a moment when brother branham would come in 1962 when he would preach on a subject on all things and there he is and right around thanksgiving time and he's and he's speaking these things on all things but you remember brother man i'm saying now he said now i can't surely i surely can't speak on all things he said but i'll speak on part and he said i can speak on pardon and a pardon means to be freed from guilt it means to be completely set free completely in your mind completely your soul completely pardoned completely free just like when a governor would walk into walk into the prison door you have the right to accept it as a pardon or turn it down as a pardon but it's only received if you receive it as a pardon but you remember where brother madam is standing at at that time in life where where brother branham is called down to a scene when there's a man that has been his critic that has criticized divine healing has criticized the move of god has criticized the pillar of fire but here a man by the name of william branham goes and stands in a court of law before here he was standing standing as an advocate standing up for somebody that criticized him and to think that the one that criticized him was the man was the man that he was criticizing was the one that came and gave a testimony that got is child out of trouble but you remember that this is more than just a man that's standing there in time but notice where we are at when brother branham becomes in that 1963 he begins to walk in there and he begins to bridge the gap a breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals and he is standing there as a man but notice it's at a time that the lamb is standing up and reading and standing up and waiting for redemptions claims he is coming to a time when he is going to set his children free completely free and if you are free you know you're free you remember the story about little johnny co the man came by and set him free but he had the captivity upon his mind he was so locked up in his mind that he was still thought that he was locked up there you don't have to stay where you're standing at you can go out the prison doors have flung wide you can walk out of here you can fly south you can fly north i ain't found one spot in the scriptures that you can't fly but a son knows that he's free a son is not weak in the thought that he's not a son he's not weak in a thought that he's a servant a son is a son and maybe you might have gone through a spot of spiritual amnesia that you forgot who you are but wake up soldier boy wake up soldier boy you'll not commit suicide you'll not commit those things soldier boy you know where you're at you know where you're standing at but his son knows where he's at all you got to do is take a look up at the water tower take a look up there and recognize i've been here before i've been in worship like that before i've been in i've been in an atmosphere like that before i've sat in a place you've been granted the greatest thing in life notice notice what life is notice that the greek word for for for eternal life is zoe which means god's own life and if you are a son or a daughter of god you were you were in god all the time but he knew what bed and time that you'd be planted in so now you're made a creature a son of god manifested son or daughter of god to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living god of this hour the message that's coming forth in this time so you see you have been risen to a time for such as this to come and to vindicate the very message and to manifest and meet the challenge of the hour and god has always had men throughout time that would come and would rise and meet the challenge just like when jonah would get in trouble when he was out there and he knew that he was the one that was creating all of this trouble he said throw me over i'm the reason why this thing is happening but he got down there and he had circumstances more than any human being could have had ever had everywhere he looked was whale's belly everywhere he looked was a circumstance that was pointing to his death but there was on a hill there was a a temple up there that he would remind himself about that when solomon was building that temple when he moved upon david it's hard to build that temple and god worked through solomon to build that temple and solomon said that if any of god's children would ever be in a time of trouble that they could turn their eyes towards the east and to pray and god would deliver them out of trouble and you could be in the worst circumstances of life but you can turn your eyes towards jesus and you can turn your eyes towards the one that knows how to set you free you can turn your eyes to one towards the one that knows how to get you out of circumstances you can turn your eyes to the one that gave you life hallelujah hallelujah david knew this that loving kindness was better than life we know that life is what controls us we are known by the very life that we live and it's been said that our life speaks louder than words i can hear your testimony your life your life speaks so much louder and you can't even hear your testimony by the life that you're living because your life is speaking louder than what you're saying it's the life that you live shows what character that you are because your life always builds your character you can say one thing and do another but if it's not really in there something's not going to come out right now let me let me just change the scene just for a moment i know you've been fed full of turkey so i'll change it up for you just for a moment so so you can get loose maybe how gravy you get to work but you remember you remember when when brother burnham when brother branham was he said when i preached about my very first sermon he said he said i preached my very first sermon there and he said he said i i i was he said i the the minister called me and he said i come over and he said i was i come over and i was preaching i was gonna preach on that wednesday night and he said he said i come in there and he said you know he said i i come in there and i put all the emotions in it he he said i cried i i swear i waved my hands back and forth he said i waved my hands back and forth i slapped the desk i did everything and and i put all the emotions into it and he said he said when i went back here to the back he said all the other sisters uh the elderly were coming back there and slapping me on the back and saying oh that was a fine job billy god's gonna make a preacher out of you and he went over and asked dr davis you remember he said i went over and asked dr davis said what did you think he said that's the worst i ever heard that's the worst they ever heard he said billy he said i want you to come he said i want you to come down to my office tomorrow about two o'clock and when he got over there dr davis said he said i said i'm sure i hurt your feelings he said well he said they just kind of stepped on a little bit they stepped on a little bit and he said he said billy so when i tell he said i want to tell you something he said one time before i was a preacher he said i was a lawyer not studied law he said i went to the courtroom and i went in there and he said i'd watched how all those other lawyers had come in there and had done everything and he said i watched and he said it was my first case and i went in there and i i was representing this this woman that was going through a divorce and he said i went in there and he said i put all the emotions into it he said i screamed and i i boo-hooed and i hollered i slapped the desk like other lawyers had done it i had done everything i could and then the then the opposing attorney was on the other side and he stood up and said judge how much more can this nonsense of this nonsense can this court handle and there that man was a it was a bribe it was a friend for us a friend to dr davis and the judge was a friend he said i did that for a purpose he said i did that for your good he said all of your emotions was right he said what did i do wrong he said all of your emotions was right he said but you didn't have one iota of law into it he said you had all the emotions he said he said but you didn't have one iota of law and the people are not set free they're not set free by emotions they're set free by the verdict of the law of what the law says and there are some people that go through or they base their christianity strictly upon emotions they base their religion or what they think of what god is or what god's got to do and and they put him in a box and and they get they base all of their christianity upon emotions and upon feelings you'll watch some people that you'll watch how the spirit of the lord will move and he'll work through a man of god and that man of god will say something he'll maybe prophesy over somebody or you'll watch it god will come down and thus saith the lord and speak something but because they put their own private interpretation to it because they put their own private interpretation to it they take it one way or maybe a preacher said something over top of you or something like that and maybe things didn't come out the way you thought they would but god had everything worked out and you get all emotional you get all the feelings you get excited oh my we just love we love when the spirit of the god begins to move across the congregation and man he begins to move and you can feel the freedom of christ just begin to rise up and some people base all of their christianity strictly upon feelings and upon emotions but then there's some people that come on the other side and be a fanatic of the other side and work up the holy ghost so much that the holy ghost can't move anymore they're so dead by the letter that they won't allow the holy ghost loose but it's about finding that balance in the word and staying right there you see you can get yourself so excited you can get yourself so under the emotion so under the atmosphere of the holy ghost but if what you're missing if what you are watching take place it's not backed up by the word you'll never move anything you can have a train looking fine sitting on the track you can have everything in order but if it ain't got no steam in it if it ain't got no fire in the wood if it's only mechanics it'll never produce it'll never set it'll just sit right there and it'll become an antique all of its days but oh just let the dynamics begin to move you watch and you begin to watch everything come in order and you watch it quickening of the holy ghost you watch somebody you watch somebody that's real solid in the word you watch somebody when the atmosphere gets right you watch an eagle they know how to fly now a chicken can get just an emotional when the feed gets thrown out on the ground they can get emotional and they can peck around and they can hoop and holler and all kinds of things but oh they can't get up above the post but an eagle knows how to get up there he's been up there before hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord isn't he good to us hallelujah no no no now watch this watch this here in future home he said now are we the sons of god not we will be but we are the attributes of god's thinking now you say well well look at this preaching he's speaking of the priest in the days of jesus he said look at this priest wasn't he a son of god it it proved he wasn't because he couldn't recognize what what did he say he said i believe the bible sure but he couldn't recognize the express word of god or the express word of the hour he only had an intellectual learning from some group that had been back before him and it's the same thing today i know it's that strong but it's the truth that's what the word er that's what that was the word i spoken exactly for that day and yet he was a scholar yet he had he was a renowned person but he he couldn't recognize it why no matter how scholar he was anything like that he still didn't have representation of predestination only to predestinate it will only be the ones who does it only can be and you only can do it because look it proves predestination because if you've got eternal life you had to be a part of god at all times because he's the only one is eternal life you begin to think about all the attributes and you begin to think about all the rights that you have as a son and daughter of god you have a right to worship you have a right to praise you have a right to access him by the throne of grace and come boldly before him because there's a blood that is upon the mercy you can come before him and you recognize that he will daily load you with benefits you can watch all of these things you know all of your rights but we are living in an hour where men are being stripped of their rights in humanity the republicans are stripping you from your rights the democrats are stripping you from your rights they're wanting to take your arms they're wanting to take your take your freedom of speech they're wanting to take freedom of religion away from you they're wanting to take away all of your freedoms now now i know i did something to you last weekend and i i i'm sorry i did that to you but i was doing it for a purpose you all got so excited because somebody said something personally about me and i was speaking about the spirit of anger man alive it was a whole congregation got so upset they got so upset because somebody said something about me i know what you're talking about i'm glad you come out to fight for me i mean hey i'm glad i got somebody who loves me thank you for that i really do appreciate that but you'll watch so many christians sometimes get their rights of worship taken away from them and they'll sit there and never move off the promises of god or they won't move over and say well i guess that's going to be all right you don't recognize what you've been given and when something gets taken away from you then you realize how powerful a thing you've been given you let somebody come in here and try to take your bible away from you man you'll jump up and you'll do everything you can to stop somebody from taking it but you let the enemy come in and he'll start whispering lies into your ears whispering oh it's okay it's okay to lay out it's okay to do this or it's okay to smoke it's okay to dip it's okay to try one of these things and the enemy will come in and he will steal your god-given rights away from you it's high time that the sons and daughters of god would begin to recognize their position and let god prove himself one more time prove that he's god prove that he's the same you watch tomorrow as we baptize these children and these older adults we baptize them in a watery gate in a watery grave in the name of the lord jesus christ god will prove himself he'll prove himself i don't have to fill them with the holy ghost but god is obligated to the very word of god to give them an outpouring of the holy ghost glory be to god i'm sorry brothers but i i sound like a barrel up here if y'all could help me out i sure would appreciate it i don't know how it sounds out there but up here i sound like i i've been wrung out but notice notice when when jesus begins to deal he begins to deal with a sister we're very acquainted with a story but he comes he comes to this lady this woman of he'll fame he begins to deal with her when when he comes from one way and she comes from a total different way of life he should have never been in this area but the bible said that he had needs to go by samaria and here was this man that was that was was there was a teacher of teacher he was a master of masters and here he was he sent his disciples by one way because hey not everybody can understand what jesus is doing not everybody can understand why a pastor or a preacher would come off of his subject to go by a whale somebody and go sit down by a well when nobody else would go around him when nobody else would go around this woman of real fame maybe but jesus will go where pharisees won't go jesus will go where some so-called message people won't go jesus will go where the gene seed of god is because god knows where his seed is laying out he knew where he cast it out you might be the preacher and you might be sowing seed just because that's your job you don't know where it's going to land at but you just sow the seed but god is obligated he knows which one fell on stoney ground and he knows which one fell involved on fertile ground and he's obligated to get his seed but here jesus goes over here notice what brother branham says improving his word he said he was watching he was watching he was watching you imagine as jesus begins to take this journey because he knows where his seed has been sown at and you begin to get so caught up in the circumstances of life because there's tears in there and there's wheat in there and you get so caught up and say man i got to get my children out of that i've got i got to do this you see when that enemy came by there and he began to throw tares out he began to throw that evil seed out there it was not an attack against you it was attack against the owner of the field but i want you to know that god has angels that are sent out to separate the wheat from the tare and you watch what is taking place as the separation begins to take place how the day how that the angels begin to move and you watch the wheat as it comes out and it begins to stand out in front of the congress in front of the world it begins to stand out oh my you begin to see what's right and what's wrong and here everybody was looking they thought they were looking at a tear they thought oh this woman would never walk with jesus this woman would never be welcomed but she was sitting at the right spot at the right time you think you think jesus didn't know what he was doing he was walking through elkton because he had a seed that was sitting down there by whale this was not a woman that was just thirsty for natural water she was thirsty in her soul jesus was watching he was watching what would happen and he begins to tell her you worship what you know not but we jews know what we worship he said by the way why don't you go get your husband she said i have no husband he said you've sold the truth for the one you're living with and the five others they weren't your husbands i have come to give you life and to give your life more abundantly and he was watching he was watching what she would do now if there would have not been anything on the inside of her it would have never stuck but because there was something laying there because there was a gene seed of god that was there oh i tell you that's a thing to put on your mind and put on your heart when the enemy begins to whisper you start speaking positivity and saying i am a gene seed of god i am made in the image of god i'm a verb i'm a born son and daughter of god i know who i am but something was laying there that took a hold she had representation by predestination but here was this here was this priest or this pharisee that was saying this man's beelzebub he he cast out devils by he didn't have no predestination he didn't have no representation but she said sir i perceive that thou art a prophet watch what brother brandon said he said that's just all he wanted her to see that's just all he wanted her to see i can take you help me lord that's all he wanted to see you can come up to somebody's front door and you can judge a whole lot you can look at that joe you can look at that door and you can see you can see what kind of house they got there you can open up that door and you ain't got to go all the way in you can see what kind of house he got just by looking at the door and jesus said i am the door that's all he wanted her to see was who he was and when he seen when she seen who he was she dropped everything that she was she ran and dropped everything and ran and told those men she went and told those pharisees that she'd been dealing with she said come and see a man that told me the very things and secrets of my heart is this not the man come on somebody she got the inspiration god began to breathe over her and all of a sudden that gene seed of god began to quicken i mean i let me just say this your warfare is not determined by your past it's determined by your future the devil ain't shook up about what you were the devil ain't shook up about what you are right now but he is shook up about what you will be the reason why some of you have fought so hard to believe this is because the devil is afraid of what you will be goliath was not scared of david as a shepherd he was not scared as a son of jesse but when this man david when he recognized he was going to be king all hail turned loose on david your warfare is not determined by your past it's determined by your future and if you are fighting hell it shows heaven is in your future [Applause] [Music] you need to walk around with a chip on your shoulder and acknowledge that the enemy is expecting you to be defeated enemy you listen up we will not be defeated we will not go down and ruin but we will rise we will come up conquerors we will come up overcomers because we have been given rights to the tree of life we know who that tree is [Applause] now notice now we all know the story in john chapter 11 we all know the story of how jesus went by the way of his friend's grave and how he went by there and he resurrected his friend lazarus you know the story of quite well but you you remember in john chapter 12 we recognize that from the time of lazarus's resurrection that the pharisees took counsel to kill jesus and though here we recognize that these were men that didn't have representation but they were actually lacking who jesus was and they were living in the glare of the law but notice they didn't know they were not aware that there was a new dispensation at hand and really they didn't recognize that the message that they were preaching was past time and it had an expiration date on it it was no longer effective what they were preaching and these pharisees began to say amongst themselves how that they come up with all these schemes how do they try to destroy lazarus and try to destroy jesus but notice what the bible said in 12 john 12 19 perceive how you prevail nothing behold the world's gone after him they come up with all of these schemes that and they come up these tactics but the pharisees are describing it themselves an attraction that is taking place to the man jesus to a man by their standards they had no right to preach or he had no right to do miracles yeah they weren't they weren't they weren't shook up by the rumors that he was a illegitimate child but they were shook up about what he would be and what he would do in the kingdom they didn't realize that they were in a junction and didn't realize where they were living at they didn't recognize that the prince of peace was right amongst them they didn't recognize that unto us his son is given but there was a people that had come to the realization because there was predestination that was laying there that was laying in front of them that's why they began to catch who he was and all of their schemes that the pharisees were coming up with for stopping the crowds from believing on him had failed and actually the more jesus preached the more faith grew the more miracles and healings that were done his fame grew and they prevailed nothing they couldn't stop people from believing on him they they was able to hang him on a cross but they couldn't stop him from believing on him they they hung him on a cross and they killed him but they couldn't stop him from believing on him they placed him in a tomb but they couldn't stop him from believing on him they rolled a stone in front of him and put a roman seal on it but you couldn't stop him from believing on him heaven didn't stop believing when jesus was in a tomb jesus believed what a backslidden prophet had said that thou will not suffer thy holy one to see corruption he went to the cross on a backslidden preacher's words because heaven will never let prophecy fall to the ground well what about me brother andrew what about my promise what what about what about what i was spoken god would not allow one word to fall to the ground he's the one who sowed it he's the one that'll water it you watch get ready to reap if you don't faint in due season you will reap what you have sown and if you have sown in faith you will reap in faith but if you sown in doubt if you stood there and what let your let you let them let the love of god wax cold in your life you'll start reaping the benefits of things that you've been sowing here these men they were looking around saying i don't know what we're going to do but they didn't realize that there was a new era at hand it doesn't matter what the religions of the world or the media of the world tries to do what the scoffers do in this day heavens declare that this word is true now notice notice now we we recognize we recognize that in the bible that we that we're taught in the old testament and the new testament there are four anointings that would come and we realized that that god would work through those anointings told in the old testament of the lion the ox the man and the flying eagle but notice that those anointings are always pointing forward they're never looking backwards like a like a frog but they're always pointing forward and those what what we understand is that those are the four anointings they are the guards to the book of life and we we look a and we recognize that when jesus would come and he would take the scriptures in matthew chapter 10 and he would say and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease and brother branham when he comes and he takes on takes the the series on revelation he said you see that guard sitting there at the gate he said the gospel guard to back up that book of acts that was wrong now jesus knew that there would be scoffers rise jesus knew that there would be critics that would come against it that's why jesus didn't build the church upon a man and that's why jesus didn't build the church upon himself but he built it up strictly upon the revelation of who he was i i you remember that jesus said that the gates of hell will not be able to prevail against it you remember you remember it now i want you to notice that this rock that jesus is building on it's not a rock that can be thrown it's not a rock that can be thrown away it's not a rock that can be cast it's not a rock that can be skipped across a river but this rock is a rock that can go in a swing and it can take down a goliath and here that here we recognize that the four gospels are the framework to back up pentecost and there were men in brother branham's day it said that that that the book of acts was a scaffold work but brother branham would come and he would speak he said that's not the scaffold work he said the four gospels what's the framework to be the way it was before it was the four gospels i mean the four gospels framed up the church they framed up the temple then pentecost came into existence the reason why we can preach to you baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ the reason why we can preach to you a baptism or the revelation of who he was and in acts 2 38 experience is because the gospels are backing us up you know jesus walked around and he's got these men that are following matthew mark luke and john and they're following him around everywhere he goes and they're following him and here jesus walks around and he starts predicting and starts telling what's taking place and those men begin to take and they begin to write down what jesus was saying and all of a sudden brother marlon said that they framed up the church he said they framed up the church all around it he said that's the guard work that protects the main temple the throne the pentecostal blessing it's the framework it's the guard but you remember when adam and eve was kicked out of the garden of eden they were kicked out of the garden of eden and god put cherubims there with swords to guard the rights back to eden but you remember when when they were they were there and brother branham said that when he said if you're scared of the holy ghost you're scared you'll never get in he said because it's that holy ghost that's guarding the rights to the tree of life he said but notice he said adam was given the word to live by but he failed moses was given the lord the word to live by but he failed david was given the word to live by but he failed and when moses is standing there in exodus 14 he begins to tell them he said in no other place shall you worship me not in this gate not in that gate not in here he's but in the place that i choose to put my name and he chose no other place but in his son christ jesus to put his put his name in and there is power in that name and when we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ you're not taking on and you're not taking on just a mortal man's name you're taking on the name of all heaven for jesus said all power in heaven and in earth is given unto me think about it all power in heaven and in earth is given unto me and when you begin to take on his name you are married to him but when you are baptized in trinitarian baptism you're not taken on a name you're taking on titles matter of fact the name you're taking on is roman catholicism that'll never resurrect you actually that'll bury you but the name of jesus christ is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are saved hey man it is good but notice when brother brown comes an ephesian church age and he begins to walk in there and he begins to take a look he said how astonishing it is to think that all that adam was rejected from has now given as a reward to the overcomer he said that that cherubim had to sheath his sword and allow access back to the gate he said but oh that sword had the blood of the lamb on it to allow you to get back into the access you see because where there is no blood there is a powerless religion you and i as christians we can point to an empty tomb we don't brag it's just facts there is an empty tomb there is power in this empty tomb because the one who walked out of there is our lord jesus christ now there's other there's other gods that's still living in their tombs and people worship under that but that god can never come and live on the inside of the worshiper but this god has come and said that i will worship i will worship in you i will live in you i will fill you i will be your comforter i will be your god i will be with you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you you have been given the greatest thing in life access to the lord jesus and to think all that was turned down you now humanity has access to this tree of life tree is not a natural tree it's a human it's a person and this person is jesus but this is only granted to a select people to the overcomers of the age i'm i'm all i might blow some of your socks off right here it might be a little deep for you but whatever you give someone comes from you mind-blown it comes from you look gabriel come here i know your birthday was back in september but happy birthday happy birthday buddy i give him a hundred dollars for his birthday he's gonna give it to sarah that's a smart man but whatever i give somebody comes for me i'm identified with that now he can take it he could buy himself some hunting clothes or he can take that and buy her a nice dinner or he can buy or something nice for christmas i don't know what he'll do with it but there's one major difference when i give somebody something because i don't know what they'll do with it but god knows what you'll do with it god knows with what you will give what you've been given what you will do with it you've been granted the greatest access to the person of life and he knows exactly what you'll do with him now he could throw that right there on the ground ain't taking that there'd been somebody else come real quick faith was already eyeing that thing but whatever you give somebody comes from you so i am now identified with what i just gave what i just give away i'm identified with it he can't spend that hundred dollars without thinking about the one that give it to him but jesus come in the book and he said i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on him on earth shall be loosed in heaven you cannot bind anything on earth without thinking about the giver you can't lose anything on earth without thinking about the giver he's identified with what he gave and he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him when abraham was walking when he'd separated his whole entire life he'd separated from his mother and separated from his father he separated from his nephew it cost him something you're sitting here tonight because it cost you something it costs you a friendship to be here it costs you some money to get here abraham lost everything he lost his land but when god seen what abraham was willing to do he told him to arise and walk through the land look to the height look through the breath look through everything i have given to you the land that you're walking through as a possession was given to you by the giver of all mighty life god himself some of you you struggle for peace you struggle for peace at night your war in your mind your war of anxiety you war with things in your past you wore your war can i really be forgiven you warriors it's really true is it is god who he says he is man i think i dialed in can i really have that peace that passes all understanding does god really love me does god really care about me you know what it's like when you lay your head down on the pill and you begin to cry yourself to sleep because you can't find peace thanksgiving always isn't a wonderful time for people there's family members that are lost they're things that that family members can't come by because of hurt feelings or different things man you really struggle with that finding that peace finding that but notice what jesus said he said come unto me come unto me and i will give you rest where do rights to them tree come from where do rights to that peace come from where do rights to a sound mind come from where the rights to a clear well come from where the rights to a perfected marriage come from source it back where'd it come from it come from the giver so let me turn it one more time satan's tried to give you cancer he's trying to give you anxiety he's tried to tear away your mind tear away your peace tear away your children say they'll never be saved they'll never get in they'll i born in this family that maybe maybe just being close enough they wars in your mind where'd that come from that kind of mindset that whispers in your ear you're going to have to deal with that where did that come from it come from a liar it didn't come from a sustainer it didn't come from the author of life where did it come from satan is the one that's giving out lies satan's the ones that giving out anxiety don't stand in his line you ain't got to stand in his soup line everything he gives out you got to eat start standing in the line for the tree of life he's given you peace he's given you hope he's given you a sound mind stand in the line with jesus he never hands out nothing bad unto me i'll give you rest god bless you this evening come musicians set your wings to the winds
