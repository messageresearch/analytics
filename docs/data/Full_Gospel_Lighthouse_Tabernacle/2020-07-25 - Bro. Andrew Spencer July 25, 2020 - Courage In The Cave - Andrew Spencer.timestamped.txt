[37:57] seated at this time
[37:59] before we go any further i'd like to
[38:02] just
[38:04] give some words words of wisdom from
[38:06] brother matt
[38:08] are you like that sometimes they'll
[38:13] send certain people into battle for
[38:14] certain things and
[38:16] i guess i'm that bulldog type of thing
[38:20] get the point across
[38:23] we've been having wonderful services
[38:26] haven't we
[38:28] and they keep getting better and better
[38:30] and better
[38:32] and we want to continue that don't we
[38:35] amen
[38:37] now they were good when it was down to
[38:38] 10 but with all of you here
[38:41] it's just so great but we want to keep
[38:44] it that way with all of you here
[38:46] amen so
[38:50] to do so covet 19 guidelines
[38:56] are have been set in place so we have to
[38:58] abide by them
[39:00] for restriction orders amen
[39:03] but some of that can help by you
[39:08] if you have fever or chills
[39:12] cough shortness of breath
[39:15] or difficulty breathing these are the
[39:18] cdc
[39:19] guidelines for the covet 19
[39:22] okay fatigue muscle
[39:26] body aches headache
[39:29] new loss of taste or smell sore throat
[39:33] congestion or runny nose nausea
[39:36] or vomiting or diarrhea
[39:42] but if it gets worse it will be
[39:45] trouble breathing persistent pain
[39:48] pressure in the chest
[39:51] new confusion inability to wake or stay
[39:54] awake
[39:55] andrew says i have that already
[39:59] and i don't have cove at 19 though but
[40:02] amen
[40:03] inability to stay awake amen
[40:06] blush lips or face so if you have had
[40:10] or having those symptoms it's not a good
[40:14] idea to call up
[40:15] someone and say is it still okay to come
[40:18] to church
[40:19] or come to work ask yourself
[40:23] wwms what would matt say
[40:30] just real quick
[40:30] [Applause]
[40:34] that's a no no i i
[40:38] i'm not a person of many words so no
[40:42] when cassie texts she'll send me a
[40:44] letter i'll send her back that
[40:47] k so
[40:50] no so if you have to pick up the phone
[40:54] and think that
[40:55] is it still okay for me to come to
[40:57] church or even maybe
[40:59] i'm i'm helping your co-workers out if
[41:01] can i come to work
[41:03] they are probably gonna say no and
[41:06] they're going to stand at the door
[41:07] with their gloves their mask their eye
[41:09] shields and a temperature gate going
[41:12] net
[41:16] so please be aware of that and those
[41:19] symptoms may appear
[41:20] 2 to 14 days after being around somebody
[41:24] so if you have been around somebody or
[41:27] somebody has constructed
[41:29] covet 19 and you're still not showing in
[41:32] them symptoms
[41:35] it's probably still not a good idea to
[41:37] come to to church
[41:38] if you're living with those individuals
[41:40] have taken a trip with them
[41:42] and has been in a vehicle with them more
[41:44] than 15 minutes

[50:17] god bless y'all i'm nervous as i'll get
[50:20] out
[50:21] um but uh i like the
[50:24] this one song that lafontaines wrote
[50:28] i'm gonna try and sing it uh i haven't
[50:30] sang it for a while
[50:31] but i like the verse that he um
[50:34] brought it out of and so instead of
[50:37] trying to
[50:38] do it in the middle of the song i'll
[50:39] just say it now
[50:41] revelation 18 2 says babylon the
[50:44] greatest fallen
[50:46] has fallen and become the habitation of
[50:48] devils
[50:49] and the hold of every unclean and
[50:51] hateful bird
[50:53] or every foul spirit in a cage of every
[50:56] unclean and hateful bird
[50:58] but verse 4 says i heard another voice
[51:01] from heaven
[51:02] saying come out of her my people that
[51:05] you be not partakers of her sins
[51:06] and yet receive not of her plagues
[51:15] babylon teaching me her pleasure-driven
[51:20] ways
[51:23] have some fun forget about tomorrow live
[51:29] today
[51:32] her music and her fashion her hollywood
[51:37] and passion can stimulate the flesh
[51:41] just like wine
[51:44] and all the while she pulls us all away
[51:49] from everything divine
[51:55] but i have heard a voice
[51:59] calling me out of babylon
[52:05] to a higher place
[52:09] there's a mountain i can live upon
[52:14] i have made my choice
[52:18] jesus is my joy in liberty
[52:22] [Music]
[52:27] babylon will never
[52:30] never have
[52:38] babylon the mystery reaches further to
[52:43] the soul
[52:48] put religion on
[52:51] but never let the spirit have control
[52:59] she stands against revival
[53:03] the truth within the bible
[53:06] binding hungry hearts with chains of
[53:09] fear
[53:13] and somehow makes confusion of the world
[53:17] god has made so clear
[53:23] but i have heard a voice
[53:27] calling me out of babylon
[53:34] to a higher place
[53:38] there's a mountain i can live upon
[53:45] and i have made my choice
[53:48] jesus is my joy and liberty
[53:56] babylon will never never have its hold
[54:01] on me
[54:06] i have heard a voice
[54:10] calling me out of babylon
[54:17] to a higher place
[54:20] there's a mountain i can live upon
[54:27] and i have made my choice
[54:31] jesus is my joy and liberty
[54:38] babylon will never never have its hold
[54:43] on me
[54:49] babylon will never never have its hold

[1:06:12] experience
[1:06:14] that raining down of the holy ghost an
[1:06:17] upper room experience on your children

[1:08:55] the way that you've brought them to me
[1:08:59] in jesus christ's name amen
[1:09:03] if you have your bibles this evening
[1:09:05] we'll
[1:09:06] we'll turn over to the book of hebrews
[1:09:08] chapter 13 and verse 5.
[1:09:19] i feel with every fiber of my being that
[1:09:23] god's got something to say
[1:09:25] this weekend i feel that way every
[1:09:29] weekend but i feel
[1:09:31] like we will hear his voice
[1:09:35] god's got something to say
[1:09:39] i'd like to speak to you along the same
[1:09:43] thoughts that we've been
[1:09:44] dealing with on o king i'll see you in
[1:09:47] the morning but i'd like to
[1:09:49] take as a thought tonight
[1:09:52] on courage in the cave
[1:09:55] courage in the cave hebrews chapter 13
[1:09:59] and verse 5.
[1:10:02] this is my favorite scripture let your
[1:10:05] conversation be without covetness
[1:10:08] and be content with such things as you
[1:10:11] have
[1:10:12] for he hath said that i will never leave
[1:10:14] thee nor forsake thee now i can be
[1:10:17] quite content with that and be content
[1:10:20] with such things as you have for he has
[1:10:22] said that i will never leave thee nor
[1:10:24] forsake
[1:10:25] thee verse six so that we may boldly
[1:10:28] say the lord is my helper my helper and
[1:10:31] i will not fear what man shall do unto
[1:10:34] me
[1:10:34] may god bless his word he may be seated
[1:10:37] in the presence of the lord
[1:10:39] courage courage in the cave
[1:10:44] look with me at deuteronomy chapter 31
[1:10:46] and verse 6. now this
[1:10:48] is when when israel is getting ready to
[1:10:50] cross over
[1:10:52] into the promised land cross over jordan
[1:10:54] and moses
[1:10:56] is called to stay back but notice what
[1:10:59] notice what the instructions here in
[1:11:01] deuteronomy 31 and 6
[1:11:03] it says to be strong and of a good
[1:11:06] courage
[1:11:07] and to fear not nor be afraid of them
[1:11:09] for the lord thy god
[1:11:11] he it is that doeth goeth with thee
[1:11:14] he will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:11:17] and moses called unto joshua and said
[1:11:20] unto him in the sight of all of israel
[1:11:24] be strong and of a good courage for thou
[1:11:26] must go with this people
[1:11:28] under the land which the lord hath sworn
[1:11:30] unto
[1:11:31] their fathers to give them and thou
[1:11:34] shalt cause them
[1:11:35] to inherit it verse 8 and the lord
[1:11:39] he it is that doeth goeth before thee
[1:11:42] he will be with thee he will not fail
[1:11:45] thee neither forsake thee
[1:11:47] fear not i love that
[1:11:51] fear not neither be dismayed
[1:11:55] and moses wrote this law and delivered
[1:11:58] it unto the priests
[1:12:00] and the sons of levi which bear the ark
[1:12:03] of the covenant of the lord
[1:12:05] and unto the elders of israel now now
[1:12:08] notice the
[1:12:09] the context of the scripture we've just
[1:12:11] read i've noticed the placing of it
[1:12:14] that just before the going over that
[1:12:16] just before you're getting ready to go
[1:12:18] over into the promised land and we
[1:12:20] understand that that
[1:12:22] we are under a joshua commission that
[1:12:24] we're standing here and all of the
[1:12:26] inheritance of god the mind of god the
[1:12:29] the very the very the very seals of god
[1:12:32] that have not been sealed from god
[1:12:34] or from our lord jesus but have been
[1:12:36] sealed to
[1:12:37] add to us as humanity have been sealed
[1:12:40] for over
[1:12:40] thousands of years but those things have
[1:12:43] been released in this hour and in a time
[1:12:46] and we realize that we're standing here
[1:12:48] and we're looking at we're looking at a
[1:12:51] crossing over in time
[1:12:53] but here what moses instruction was
[1:12:56] to to joshua and to all the levites and
[1:12:59] all the priests
[1:13:00] and here we are standing under a
[1:13:02] melchizedek priesthood
[1:13:04] and we're standing here in this hour and
[1:13:06] the word to us
[1:13:07] is to take courage that i am the lord
[1:13:10] that i will be with thee
[1:13:12] and i will not fail thee that i will not
[1:13:14] forsake thee
[1:13:15] you know i i could go anywhere in life
[1:13:18] knowing that god is with me
[1:13:20] i believe that i can take faith in
[1:13:22] knowing that i'm not standing here alone
[1:13:24] or when i go
[1:13:25] to down the road or when i get in my car
[1:13:28] but i can take courage in knowing
[1:13:30] that god has said that he be with me now
[1:13:32] there are times in life that may
[1:13:35] may come and there might be causing an
[1:13:37] interruption
[1:13:38] in life or maybe a maybe a a
[1:13:41] conversation and
[1:13:42] maybe it leads you to a path in which
[1:13:44] you don't feel necessarily
[1:13:46] don't necessarily feel the holiest of
[1:13:48] holies and you don't necessarily feel
[1:13:51] like you're
[1:13:51] you're on top of the mountain but maybe
[1:13:53] you're down in the valley but you can
[1:13:55] have that same reassurance down on the
[1:13:57] inside of your soul
[1:13:59] that there is a god that that has said
[1:14:01] that he'll not leave you
[1:14:03] and he will not forsake you you know
[1:14:04] there's going to come seasons in your
[1:14:06] life
[1:14:07] that there will be times of victory and
[1:14:10] there will be
[1:14:11] times of despair and there'll be times
[1:14:13] of battle but i want you to take courage
[1:14:16] in the midst of the chaos of life to
[1:14:18] take courage
[1:14:19] that there is a mighty angel that is
[1:14:22] very present
[1:14:23] over your situation and over your
[1:14:26] circumstances
[1:14:27] but notice notice what webster tells us
[1:14:30] what courage is
[1:14:31] he tells us that the courage is bravery
[1:14:35] it is intrepidity that that quality of
[1:14:37] mind which enables men
[1:14:39] to encounter danger and difficulties
[1:14:42] with firmness
[1:14:43] or without fear or depression of spirits
[1:14:46] it is a valor it is a boldness
[1:14:49] it is a resolution it is courage is
[1:14:52] it is a mindset courage is the quality
[1:14:55] in the mind in which you know
[1:14:57] it enables you to encounter the danger
[1:15:00] of life
[1:15:01] and you look at the hour that we're
[1:15:03] living in and we hear the prophet
[1:15:05] teaching
[1:15:05] us that we're living in the most
[1:15:07] dangerous time
[1:15:08] of life he would tell us that he would
[1:15:11] teach us that
[1:15:12] that at the midnight hour at the
[1:15:15] twilight is when it's the most dangerous
[1:15:17] of times
[1:15:18] when you're traveling when it's at that
[1:15:20] hour of chaos an hour hour of darkness
[1:15:23] that's when it's the dangerous and here
[1:15:25] we are living in an hour
[1:15:26] where we see false christ amongst us
[1:15:29] when we see
[1:15:30] the anointed ones at the end time and
[1:15:32] and
[1:15:33] jesus would tell us over in matthew
[1:15:35] chapter 24 and 24
[1:15:37] that that that they're in the last days
[1:15:40] that false christ will arise amongst you
[1:15:42] that it would be so close that it would
[1:15:45] deceive the very elected
[1:15:47] if it was possible and we we see that
[1:15:50] where we're living out we're living in
[1:15:52] such an hour
[1:15:53] where it's not been like this through
[1:15:55] two thousand years through the church
[1:15:57] ages
[1:15:58] through six thousand churches or six
[1:16:00] church ages
[1:16:01] there has not been jesus kicked out but
[1:16:03] on this side in this church age
[1:16:06] we see jesus kicked out and on the
[1:16:08] outside of his church
[1:16:10] and if there's ever a time that the
[1:16:12] people of god
[1:16:13] need to have courage in their life it's
[1:16:16] in the moments of these things
[1:16:18] and i want to say to you that that that
[1:16:21] there's
[1:16:22] never been anybody that's walked out of
[1:16:24] this cave before
[1:16:26] there's not been anybody that's walked
[1:16:28] into this despair before
[1:16:30] that's never walked into this lines then
[1:16:32] before it ever came out of it
[1:16:34] but there will be a people that will
[1:16:36] come out of this cave
[1:16:37] that will have courage in the midst of
[1:16:40] all of the sicknesses
[1:16:42] and all of the turmoil and all the
[1:16:44] darkness and the lukewarmness
[1:16:46] there will be a people that have the
[1:16:48] courage that when there's remains to be
[1:16:50] nobody that has courage
[1:16:52] she will have a courage and i will tell
[1:16:55] you what causes that courage
[1:16:57] is a trust that he can use you like
[1:17:00] never before you see that's what trust
[1:17:03] does
[1:17:04] trust will cause the courage inside of
[1:17:06] you
[1:17:08] trust will cause you to believe in him
[1:17:10] you see if you trust me you'll walk with
[1:17:12] me wherever i go
[1:17:14] and if you trust god you got courage to
[1:17:17] go with him wherever he says go
[1:17:19] there's going to be times when it seems
[1:17:22] like this he's taking you out on a limb
[1:17:24] but he's leading you right to the
[1:17:26] perfect promise
[1:17:27] in which he has ordained you to walk and
[1:17:30] it's going to take a courage
[1:17:34] to walk through this spot
[1:17:38] philippians 4 4 says rejoice in the lord
[1:17:41] always
[1:17:42] and again i say rejoice hallelujah
[1:17:46] rejoice
[1:17:47] rejoicing good times rejoice in bad
[1:17:50] times rejoice when you're happy
[1:17:52] rejoice when you're low rejoice when
[1:17:54] you're sick rejoice when you're broke
[1:17:56] rejoice when you got money
[1:17:59] let your moderation be known unto all
[1:18:01] men the lord is at hand
[1:18:04] be careful for nothing be anxious for
[1:18:07] nothing
[1:18:08] but in everything by prayer and
[1:18:10] supplication with thanksgiving
[1:18:12] let your requests be made known unto god
[1:18:16] and the peace of god which passes
[1:18:19] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[1:18:23] and mind through christ jesus
[1:18:26] now notice what the age of the lord has
[1:18:29] spoken to us in this hour
[1:18:31] it's about thinking past what we see
[1:18:34] it's about thinking past and looking
[1:18:36] past
[1:18:37] and believing past what we see but it's
[1:18:40] the peace of god
[1:18:42] that will keep your hearts it is not
[1:18:44] what you see at the pulpit
[1:18:46] it is not what you see in your financial
[1:18:48] status
[1:18:49] it is not but it is the peace of god
[1:18:52] that will keep your mind in your heart
[1:18:57] hallelujah finally my brethren
[1:19:01] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:19:04] things are honest whatsoever
[1:19:05] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:19:08] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:19:10] whatsoever things are of a good rapport
[1:19:12] if there be any virtue
[1:19:15] if there be any praise think
[1:19:19] on these things you can't think about
[1:19:22] the things that are going on in the
[1:19:24] world i read over fox news and
[1:19:26] some of the news outlets sometimes and i
[1:19:29] i do it justin i don't read but half of
[1:19:31] the half of the headlines because it
[1:19:33] makes me sick in my stomach
[1:19:34] but i have hardly found one thing good
[1:19:38] or positive in the news for the last six
[1:19:41] months
[1:19:42] but i have found good and positive
[1:19:45] things
[1:19:45] in these things i have found pure things
[1:19:49] just things holy things and i have set
[1:19:53] my
[1:19:53] course to think on these things
[1:19:57] you see if you can get your mind right
[1:19:59] you can do anything when your mind is
[1:20:01] set right
[1:20:02] if you can change your mind to go to
[1:20:04] thinking about what god has said instead
[1:20:06] and what you're seeing
[1:20:07] if you can change your mind you can
[1:20:10] change the way you walk
[1:20:12] if you can change your thinking you can
[1:20:14] change the way you talk
[1:20:16] you say well i just didn't think about
[1:20:18] that you had to think about it
[1:20:20] before you said it so before you say
[1:20:23] something
[1:20:24] go to thinking about what you're saying
[1:20:26] go to thinking about what you're posting
[1:20:29] go to thinking about what you're
[1:20:30] expressing or what you're liking or what
[1:20:32] you're pinning
[1:20:33] or all of those things speak on these
[1:20:35] things
[1:20:38] you see if you can get your mind right
[1:20:43] there's a whole lot of things you can do
[1:20:47] you can be like paul and you say i am
[1:20:49] persuaded
[1:20:50] that neither death nor life nor things
[1:20:53] present no things to come
[1:20:54] no height nor death nor any other
[1:20:56] creature shall be able to separate
[1:20:59] me from the love of god you see if
[1:21:01] you're persuaded in your mind and in
[1:21:03] your heart
[1:21:04] you can do a whole lot of things and you
[1:21:06] can be like paul
[1:21:07] and you can say i can do all things
[1:21:10] through christ which strengthens me
[1:21:13] are you with me if you've got your
[1:21:14] mindset on what he said
[1:21:16] and i'm talking to you more than a hope
[1:21:18] but a revelation from god when your eyes
[1:21:21] is fixed on the word of god you can look
[1:21:24] all the way through the heroes of faith
[1:21:26] in daniel
[1:21:26] or hebrews chapter 11 and you could read
[1:21:29] down there and it would say that what
[1:21:31] can i more say for time would fail me
[1:21:33] to tell you about rahab and tell you
[1:21:36] about barlock
[1:21:37] talia tell you about samson tell you
[1:21:39] about the prophets and tell you how they
[1:21:40] shut the mouth of lines
[1:21:42] oh but let us run this race
[1:21:47] what is it it's not looking to what's
[1:21:50] behind you
[1:21:51] but it's looking to the author and the
[1:21:53] finisher of your faith
[1:21:55] if your eyes is not on the things of god
[1:21:58] you will not project the things of god
[1:22:02] you see a person that is sick if they
[1:22:04] can ever set their mind to what god has
[1:22:06] said
[1:22:07] you'll watch as that sickness is
[1:22:09] shortened
[1:22:12] are you with me if you can go to setting
[1:22:14] your mind to receiving the baptism of
[1:22:16] the holy ghost
[1:22:17] setting your mind to what the word is
[1:22:18] said you can watch as the spirit of god
[1:22:21] will draw near to you
[1:22:23] are you with me how many has how many
[1:22:25] remembers that time when you were
[1:22:26] seeking the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:28] and you went to go sit in your mind well
[1:22:30] we got five people that wouldn't seek
[1:22:31] the holy ghost we got about 900
[1:22:33] 900 people out there on the internet
[1:22:35] that needs to seek the holy ghost but we
[1:22:36] got five here that sought it
[1:22:39] so let's get the rest of the
[1:22:40] congregation seeking the baptism of the
[1:22:42] holy ghost and we'll get our eyes on
[1:22:44] what things
[1:22:45] what things ought to be on all right but
[1:22:48] faith you see you see a lot of times
[1:22:50] people got hope
[1:22:52] instead of faith but faith is a
[1:22:55] revelation from god
[1:22:57] and what faith will do it'll create
[1:23:00] something on the inside of you
[1:23:02] that'll make you look past what you see
[1:23:05] brother branham would use hope
[1:23:07] like an acorn he would say potentially
[1:23:10] you got an oak tree he said if you ask
[1:23:12] me for an oak tree
[1:23:13] and i give you an acorn he said
[1:23:15] potentially
[1:23:16] you've got an oak tree he said but a lot
[1:23:20] of times people come with an imagination
[1:23:22] in their mind well
[1:23:23] i've seen this person do that so i can
[1:23:25] do that and they're just hoping for it
[1:23:27] but faith is the substance of things
[1:23:30] hoped for
[1:23:31] it is the evidence of things that you do
[1:23:34] not see
[1:23:38] it's amazing what faith will do faith
[1:23:41] the father of faith abraham was able to
[1:23:44] look into a realm for
[1:23:45] 25 years and he could see that there was
[1:23:49] time after 30 30 days in a month time
[1:23:52] after
[1:23:52] time after time again and there would be
[1:23:55] failure
[1:23:56] of conception but what faith did
[1:23:59] was brought whoo what brought a
[1:24:02] production
[1:24:03] to a conception and brought forth life
[1:24:07] oh hallelujah but he looked past what he
[1:24:10] was seeing
[1:24:11] in the natural oh hallelujah you see
[1:24:15] jesus
[1:24:16] had to look past what he was seeing in
[1:24:18] the world around him
[1:24:20] but jesus had to believe what the word
[1:24:23] said about jesus
[1:24:25] oh come on somebody there were people
[1:24:28] that were around jesus
[1:24:30] that did not want to believe what it
[1:24:31] said about jesus
[1:24:33] but jesus had to step into the body of
[1:24:37] the word
[1:24:42] you see hope will not produce
[1:24:48] it will not produce what faith produces
[1:24:53] but what you have is potentially faith
[1:24:56] you're right there on the cusp of a
[1:24:59] breakthrough
[1:25:01] but if you keep watering that hope if
[1:25:04] you keep
[1:25:04] watering that seed of hope and you keep
[1:25:07] saying
[1:25:08] what the word says you watch faith
[1:25:11] get in line and all of a sudden hope
[1:25:14] becomes faith
[1:25:15] and you've got an oak tree on your hands
[1:25:17] because you chose to water
[1:25:21] that seed
[1:25:26] a seed laying on the inside of you that
[1:25:28] is waiting
[1:25:29] to be released
[1:25:33] there'll be nuggets of faith that'll be
[1:25:35] dropped right here this evening
[1:25:38] that'll give you courage
[1:25:43] and he did not he did not ask you to do
[1:25:47] what you did not have the capacity to do
[1:25:51] are you with me he will not put anything
[1:25:53] on you
[1:25:54] that he knew that you wouldn't be able
[1:25:56] to bear it
[1:25:58] he must think a lot about the bride of
[1:26:00] jesus christ
[1:26:02] to send her through wars through
[1:26:04] calamities
[1:26:05] through distresses and all of those
[1:26:07] things but he
[1:26:08] has not put more on you he's not asked
[1:26:11] you to go through laodicea
[1:26:13] unless you had the capacity to go
[1:26:16] through laodicea
[1:26:17] you see he deposited something on the
[1:26:20] inside of your soul
[1:26:21] before the foundation of the world and
[1:26:23] he knew that you had
[1:26:25] what it took to overcome
[1:26:28] he knew what he deposited was more than
[1:26:31] a hope so
[1:26:32] but it was a belief from the foundation
[1:26:35] of the
[1:26:36] world
[1:26:40] oh sure there's a lot of seeds that get
[1:26:43] thrown out on the ground
[1:26:44] but sure they get thrown on stony ground
[1:26:46] sure maybe the sun comes up
[1:26:49] and it dries them out but there is a
[1:26:51] seed that has been deposited
[1:26:53] in good ground and fertile ground and
[1:26:56] that seed will produce
[1:26:58] none other than what the word called for
[1:27:00] it to do
[1:27:04] are you with me if you're a daniel
[1:27:06] you're going to produce a daniel
[1:27:08] if you're a david you're going to
[1:27:10] produce a david
[1:27:11] if you are an isaac you will produce an
[1:27:14] isaac
[1:27:15] and if you are the bride of jesus christ
[1:27:17] you will produce
[1:27:19] the bride of jesus christ
[1:27:22] when cool when dogs give birth they give
[1:27:26] birth to dogs
[1:27:27] catch the cats humans are humans and
[1:27:30] when god gives birth
[1:27:31] he gives birth to sons and daughters of
[1:27:34] god
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:39] hallelujah
[1:27:44] hallelujah this message didn't come
[1:27:47] just to prove that william branham was
[1:27:49] malachi 4.
[1:27:51] it did not just come so that we could
[1:27:53] see miracles
[1:27:54] and that we could see signs and wonders
[1:27:56] this message didn't come to lift up a
[1:27:58] man but this message
[1:28:00] came to place sons and daughters of god
[1:28:04] and has told us that we have
[1:28:05] representation by predestination
[1:28:08] that we are a people that is built to
[1:28:10] stand against all the wiles of the devil
[1:28:14] that we are built to overcome the
[1:28:16] pressures of laodicea
[1:28:18] oh i tell you what a confidence that god
[1:28:20] has got in his children
[1:28:25] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:28:27] word are you with me
[1:28:29] she's able to look past she's able to
[1:28:32] look past what she sees
[1:28:36] she's able to look up here in that
[1:28:37] arcade and said there's joy
[1:28:40] in the time of mourning and she brings
[1:28:42] it down
[1:28:43] she's able to look up there in the
[1:28:45] arcade
[1:28:46] and look up there and says that i am the
[1:28:48] lord that heals all of thy diseases
[1:28:51] she looks past what she sees and reaches
[1:28:54] into that realm
[1:28:55] and pulls down what he knew of her from
[1:28:58] the beginning
[1:29:02] oh hallelujah it's faith that cometh by
[1:29:05] hearing
[1:29:08] it's not the size of the dog in the
[1:29:10] fight it's the size of the fight that's
[1:29:11] in the dog
[1:29:12] that's what it takes it's somebody who's
[1:29:14] got courage and faith
[1:29:16] god does faith in god to stand there and
[1:29:18] say thus saith the lord
[1:29:20] you see faith moves in and everything
[1:29:22] else takes it place
[1:29:23] when faith moves in you see but faith
[1:29:26] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:29:29] word of god
[1:29:30] if you need salvation listen to the word
[1:29:33] of god
[1:29:34] if you need healing listen to the word
[1:29:36] of god if you need
[1:29:37] satisfaction in your soul listen to the
[1:29:40] word of god
[1:29:40] if you need a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:29:43] listen to the word of god
[1:29:44] if you need your prayers answered listen
[1:29:46] to the word of god
[1:29:48] if you need a blessing for your soul a
[1:29:50] blessing for your children
[1:29:52] a blessing for your family a blessing on
[1:29:54] your job
[1:29:55] listen to the word of god you see faith
[1:29:58] is a ladder
[1:29:59] that we climb on from hearing ground to
[1:30:02] receiving ground
[1:30:03] and faith believes that god will work it
[1:30:05] out faith
[1:30:06] is a latch that unlocks heaven's door by
[1:30:10] faith the walls of jericho fail
[1:30:14] hallelujah faith does not say that
[1:30:17] there's no walls there
[1:30:19] faith acknowledges that there's a
[1:30:20] problem but faith says
[1:30:23] there is a god that is bigger than the
[1:30:25] walls
[1:30:26] [Applause]
[1:30:28] if you're afraid to shout your walls
[1:30:31] will never come down
[1:30:33] oh hallelujah you can look at your
[1:30:35] circumstance but it's going to take a
[1:30:37] circumstance of faith on the inside of
[1:30:39] your soul
[1:30:40] to look past what you see
[1:30:44] it's judging that land faith
[1:30:47] didn't say there wasn't no giants there
[1:30:50] faith said that we're more than able to
[1:30:53] take it
[1:30:55] sure there's a denomination that says
[1:30:58] that we can't have healing no more
[1:31:00] but faith says it's there for us
[1:31:04] sure is there ideology out there so you
[1:31:06] can't have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:31:08] and the apostolic days are over
[1:31:10] but there is a faith that says it's for
[1:31:12] me and my house
[1:31:28] i believe brother branham says it and
[1:31:30] how can i overcome
[1:31:34] i'll paraphrase it just but he said he
[1:31:37] said something along these lines
[1:31:41] he said if you're diagnosed with cancer
[1:31:42] he said you can't say it's not cancer
[1:31:45] he said that's not overcoming he said
[1:31:48] but overcoming is to recognize the devil
[1:31:51] in every one of his tricks
[1:31:54] sure he may pin you in a corner sure he
[1:31:57] may
[1:31:57] try to steal your job away from you or
[1:32:00] steal your wife away from you
[1:32:02] but overcoming is recognizing the devil
[1:32:05] in every one of his tricks
[1:32:10] is that right
[1:32:14] but faith will push past that trick
[1:32:20] whoo faith has said not today
[1:32:24] faith has said you ain't got enough
[1:32:25] satan faith will tell you satan
[1:32:28] you're not strong enough you're not good
[1:32:31] enough
[1:32:32] you're not powerful enough how about
[1:32:35] some young people say hey
[1:32:37] i'm tired of living this way i'm ready
[1:32:39] to go higher
[1:32:40] faith will take you high how about some
[1:32:43] ladies and gentlemen of god
[1:32:45] that said i'm tired of living in this
[1:32:48] sinful condition
[1:32:49] i want to allow your faith to push you
[1:32:52] out of this realm of what you see
[1:33:02] it takes real courage to walk into a
[1:33:06] cave
[1:33:10] but you got to know that god will do his
[1:33:12] part
[1:33:18] now i got i got 90 with me on that one
[1:33:21] maybe we'll get you seeking the baptism
[1:33:22] the holy ghost
[1:33:26] all right but you got to realize that
[1:33:28] god will do
[1:33:29] his part just like when jesus said it's
[1:33:32] to the believer that they can lay hands
[1:33:34] on the sick
[1:33:38] and it's for god to make them well
[1:33:41] the book of james would tell us that the
[1:33:43] believers may anoint
[1:33:45] the sick with oil and pray the prayer on
[1:33:48] their behalf
[1:33:49] and james tells us that it's the lord
[1:33:52] that will raise up the sick
[1:33:54] you see god will say to you you do your
[1:33:57] part
[1:33:58] and i'll do my part come on somebody
[1:34:02] you go to seek him and he'll go to
[1:34:05] feeling
[1:34:06] you go to ask him and you go to point
[1:34:09] out on you
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:13] you see do what god tells you to do
[1:34:18] and you can expect god to do what he
[1:34:20] said to do
[1:34:22] that is faith
[1:34:26] you see
[1:34:30] we have the mind of christ
[1:34:34] that we're never going to give up
[1:34:39] when christ came there was more doubt in
[1:34:41] the in the land then than
[1:34:43] it is now but he did not give up
[1:34:48] because he was sent for a purpose and
[1:34:50] jesus
[1:34:51] had courage in what the word said about
[1:34:54] him
[1:34:55] and he said he said that he would never
[1:34:58] give up
[1:34:59] but he would go all the way and if we
[1:35:01] could ever have that mentality
[1:35:03] that we we've heard the voice of god
[1:35:06] that he's
[1:35:07] told us who we are that we've heard his
[1:35:10] name
[1:35:10] we've heard him declare his name over us
[1:35:13] that
[1:35:14] he's told us to be strong he's told us
[1:35:16] big
[1:35:17] to be courageous he's told us that he's
[1:35:19] faithful
[1:35:23] you see everything depends on god
[1:35:27] and god depends on nothing
[1:35:32] you see if god says he's with you he's
[1:35:35] with you
[1:35:37] if god says he's got this he's got this
[1:35:41] if god says that i am the lord thy god
[1:35:44] that fights all of your battles
[1:35:46] he's the lord thy god that fights all of
[1:35:48] your battles
[1:35:49] so if god is with you he's with you so
[1:35:52] you can remain
[1:35:53] collected in the fight you can have
[1:35:55] composure
[1:35:56] and calamity you can have confidence in
[1:35:59] the conflict
[1:36:00] and you can have inspiration in the
[1:36:02] midst of warfare
[1:36:03] because the bible tells me in hebrews 4
[1:36:06] and 12
[1:36:07] that the word of god is quick and
[1:36:10] powerful
[1:36:11] and sharper than any two-widget sword
[1:36:13] who
[1:36:14] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:36:16] soul and spirit
[1:36:18] and of the joints and marrow and it is a
[1:36:20] gerner
[1:36:21] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:36:23] heart
[1:36:28] he's still discerning the faults and the
[1:36:31] intents
[1:36:32] of the children's heart he has the
[1:36:35] ability to reach in
[1:36:37] to your mindset and know what you're
[1:36:39] thinking
[1:36:40] he knows that when you're sitting there
[1:36:43] under the preaching of the word
[1:36:45] and he sees all that you're going
[1:36:47] through
[1:36:48] and all that you're facing but i want to
[1:36:51] encourage you
[1:36:52] do not stay under your husband's
[1:36:56] shadow no longer i want to encourage you
[1:36:59] not to stay under the taskmaster of sin
[1:37:02] no longer
[1:37:06] hallelujah he has the ability to reach
[1:37:09] into that realm
[1:37:10] and tell you that you've been doing
[1:37:12] filthy things
[1:37:13] and that's why you can't overcome and
[1:37:15] have an overcoming life
[1:37:19] he has the ability to reach into that
[1:37:21] realm
[1:37:22] and call your name tell you who you are
[1:37:25] tell you that you've seen a heavy tech
[1:37:28] doctor this week
[1:37:29] had had rim that grim glasses on and he
[1:37:32] diagnosed you with this
[1:37:34] and he tells you all those things he's
[1:37:36] still a discerner of the thoughts
[1:37:39] and the intents of the heart
[1:37:43] you see it's a fact that god is still
[1:37:46] here
[1:37:47] it's a fact that god is not going to
[1:37:49] leave you it's a fact that he is
[1:37:51] committed to his promise
[1:37:53] it's a fact just like he told paul i'm
[1:37:56] with you
[1:37:56] and then he proved he was with paul it's
[1:37:59] a fact
[1:38:00] that he says he's with this bride and
[1:38:02] he's proven he's with this bride
[1:38:05] the bible says in isaiah 43 but now thus
[1:38:09] saith the lord that created thee o jacob
[1:38:11] and he that formed the o israel fear not
[1:38:15] for i have redeemed thee i have called
[1:38:18] thee by name
[1:38:19] thou art mine when you pass through the
[1:38:22] waters i will be with thee
[1:38:25] and through the rivers they shall not
[1:38:27] overflow thee
[1:38:28] when thou walk us through the fire thou
[1:38:30] shall not be burned neither shall the
[1:38:32] flame kindle upon me
[1:38:40] you can tell me about your cave
[1:38:43] but as long as you know he's with you it
[1:38:46] don't matter what the cave looks like
[1:38:50] you see you can say like paul said that
[1:38:52] i can do all things through christ which
[1:38:54] strengthens me
[1:38:55] in difficulty i can do all things
[1:38:58] through christ in weakness i can do all
[1:39:01] things through christ
[1:39:02] in strength i can do all things in
[1:39:05] christ
[1:39:05] through pain through struggles through
[1:39:08] all things
[1:39:14] it'd be amazing if you actually lived
[1:39:17] in that kind of mentality i can do all
[1:39:21] things
[1:39:24] are you with me you heard me say this
[1:39:26] before if you actually went to your boss
[1:39:29] you went to your boss and he asked you
[1:39:30] what can you do and you said i can do
[1:39:32] all things
[1:39:34] you'd blow his mind really
[1:39:37] if you went and told you young men that
[1:39:39] are trying to court some ladies in here
[1:39:41] and she asked you what you do for her
[1:39:42] for a profession and she asked you what
[1:39:45] you do
[1:39:45] and you told her i can do all things
[1:39:50] she's got a tendency probably not to
[1:39:51] believe you but if you would go ahead
[1:39:55] and express to her
[1:39:56] that i can do all things through christ
[1:39:59] which strengthens me
[1:40:01] i can go through cancer knowing that i
[1:40:04] can do all things through christ
[1:40:06] which strengthens me i can go through
[1:40:09] the valley
[1:40:10] of the shadow of death knowing that i
[1:40:12] can do all things
[1:40:15] through christ which strengthens me
[1:40:22] he's not called us just to be a bunch of
[1:40:24] quotas he's not called us just to be
[1:40:26] able
[1:40:27] to be able to quote all the all the
[1:40:29] statements of faith
[1:40:30] and be able to tell you all the years
[1:40:32] that brother branham preached to us
[1:40:34] and tell us all the scriptures he's not
[1:40:36] looking for a computer
[1:40:40] he's got a bunch of tablets today that
[1:40:43] still don't know how to live right
[1:40:44] but god is looking for a vessel that's
[1:40:47] made of 16 elements
[1:40:49] that's got a soul that the devil can't
[1:40:52] kill
[1:40:57] well i've been studying all week but you
[1:40:59] ain't overcome
[1:41:01] one second that study didn't do you no
[1:41:04] good
[1:41:05] oh it hurts but i was listening
[1:41:09] there's a lot of people that list me
[1:41:11] tonight will walk out of here the same
[1:41:13] condition
[1:41:16] i can preach till i'm blue in the face i
[1:41:18] can scream
[1:41:19] i can lead you to the water but i still
[1:41:23] can't make you drink it
[1:41:36] but my cave
[1:41:41] my cave is so dark
[1:41:46] if you could see if you could see in my
[1:41:49] cave brother andrew you'd understand
[1:41:52] why i have this reluctancy
[1:41:57] to give forth
[1:42:01] i'm afraid that too many times we've
[1:42:04] mishandled this message
[1:42:08] and we've not produced what the message
[1:42:13] has called us to be
[1:42:16] brother branham said that i'm afraid
[1:42:18] that too many times we're getting the
[1:42:19] people to church
[1:42:21] instead of getting them to christ if all
[1:42:23] you
[1:42:24] are is identified is with full gospel
[1:42:27] lighthouse
[1:42:28] that's not good enough
[1:42:32] if all you're identified is with ron
[1:42:35] spencer's ministry
[1:42:36] or andrew spencer's ministry it's not
[1:42:39] good enough
[1:42:42] it's a time to be birthed by this word
[1:42:52] amen you know on rapture morning i'll
[1:42:56] never have another nightmare
[1:42:58] of young people getting destroyed by sin
[1:43:01] because we made it all then
[1:43:04] on rapture morning i'm not gonna be so
[1:43:07] sick of my stomach
[1:43:08] that i can't hardly come out of my study
[1:43:10] thinking if one person don't get this
[1:43:14] because we all made it on rapture
[1:43:16] mourning but i'm doing everything within
[1:43:19] my power
[1:43:20] to make sure that i give you all the
[1:43:23] ammunition
[1:43:24] to walk into that cave and come out
[1:43:29] i'm not giving you the ammunition to
[1:43:31] stay there get out of that cave
[1:43:44] my cave is scarred with alcoholism
[1:43:48] my cave my cave is scarred with all
[1:43:52] kinds of family troubles brother andrew
[1:43:54] my cave is scarred with drugs my cave is
[1:43:57] scarred with
[1:43:59] with parents that hurt me that abuse me
[1:44:04] you can tell me about all the
[1:44:07] stalactites
[1:44:08] and all the stalagmites all the
[1:44:10] parasites and all the dirty websites in
[1:44:12] all of your caves
[1:44:14] it's still a cave
[1:44:22] oh but my cave is so dark my
[1:44:25] cave is so deep my cave has got more
[1:44:28] bats in your bats
[1:44:32] i'm so scared of them it's still
[1:44:36] a cave but the word to you
[1:44:40] is to give you courage
[1:44:44] that mourning is coming and you ain't
[1:44:47] gotta stay in that cave
[1:44:49] no longer oh come on somebody
[1:44:53] it's a call to come up
[1:44:59] you can stay in that cave and die drunk
[1:45:02] you can stay in that cave
[1:45:03] and die being a gamer all your life or
[1:45:06] you can rise up
[1:45:07] out of that cave and said oh king i'll
[1:45:10] see you in the morning
[1:45:19] that's a thinking man's filter that's a
[1:45:22] man that thinks past
[1:45:24] what he's seeing
[1:45:32] a man with that kind of mentality he can
[1:45:34] look over there and see
[1:45:37] in isaiah 54 that this ain't just a
[1:45:40] blanket covering for all christians
[1:45:42] but this is for the heritage of the lord
[1:45:45] that there is no weapon
[1:45:47] that is formed against thee that shall
[1:45:49] prosper
[1:45:50] and every tongue that rises against thee
[1:45:53] in the judgment
[1:45:54] thou shalt condemn this is the heritage
[1:45:58] of the saints
[1:46:12] remember when that maniac came against
[1:46:16] the prophet
[1:46:21] he said in that book he said probably
[1:46:23] some of you read of that night when the
[1:46:24] maniac run to the platform
[1:46:26] out there in oregon was going to take my
[1:46:28] life and someone said brother branham
[1:46:30] was you scared i said no sir not a bit
[1:46:34] as long as jesus is there as long as
[1:46:36] he's told me to do this and i'm in his
[1:46:39] will
[1:46:39] there's nothing to fear as long as
[1:46:41] you're doing what he says do
[1:46:43] and you know you're doing and you're
[1:46:45] directly led
[1:46:47] well then there's nothing to fear
[1:46:49] perfect love
[1:46:50] cast out all fear there's no fearing god
[1:46:54] love takes away fear he said but when i
[1:46:58] turned to that man
[1:46:59] he said i knew he was whipped right
[1:47:01] there there was something on the inside
[1:47:04] that moved up and said don't fear i'm
[1:47:07] standing
[1:47:08] with you in another place
[1:47:12] he said there's never been one time that
[1:47:14] i stood at the pulpit
[1:47:15] and there'd be an ounce of fear that
[1:47:17] entered my heart
[1:47:19] to think about that here's a man
[1:47:22] that met satan himself in a challenge
[1:47:29] and there's not been one lick of fear as
[1:47:32] long as you know what you're doing
[1:47:33] and you're in the will of god there
[1:47:35] cannot be one ounce of fear that strikes
[1:47:37] your heart
[1:47:39] you ever been in that spot when it feels
[1:47:41] like you're staring hell right in the
[1:47:43] face it's kind of like what i'm
[1:47:44] preaching to tonight
[1:47:46] when hell is looking you right in the
[1:47:48] face you better know where you're
[1:47:49] standing
[1:47:50] at and you better have some courage
[1:47:52] about you
[1:47:56] maybe you won't like this
[1:48:00] but there'll be people that says you
[1:48:02] need to grin and bury
[1:48:03] or you need to suck it up you need to
[1:48:05] know where you're standing at
[1:48:08] you can either back up or you can bow
[1:48:11] and give in
[1:48:14] but when you're staring fear and staring
[1:48:16] hell right in the face and it's
[1:48:18] challenging
[1:48:19] everything that you believe in you
[1:48:21] better know
[1:48:22] where you're standing at that's why a
[1:48:24] prophet would tell us
[1:48:26] in works as faith expressed that we
[1:48:28] ought to be fearless in our testimony
[1:48:30] be fearless in our life be fearless in
[1:48:33] our walk
[1:48:38] but wayne lawson sent me a sent me a
[1:48:41] video this week
[1:48:42] of a lady had met i believe he met her
[1:48:45] in arkansas and she was
[1:48:46] i believe she was from new uh new mexico
[1:48:48] and she was in one of brother branham's
[1:48:50] meetings here
[1:48:52] and there was a girl a girl that she was
[1:48:54] acquainted with and that
[1:48:55] went through the prayer line there and
[1:48:57] she went through and they were
[1:48:58] acquainted with her she was about 18
[1:49:00] years old and
[1:49:01] she was deaf and dumb and when she went
[1:49:04] through the
[1:49:04] when she went through the prayer line
[1:49:06] that brother branham held the microphone
[1:49:08] up to her voice
[1:49:09] up to her mouth there and she began to
[1:49:12] speak mama
[1:49:13] mama and she would say those things that
[1:49:15] she was miraculously healed
[1:49:17] and she went back home and she began to
[1:49:20] tell her parents
[1:49:21] of everything that she went through
[1:49:22] everything she experienced
[1:49:24] how brother branham told her all of
[1:49:26] these things and her parents
[1:49:28] called her a liar and told her that
[1:49:30] she'd been faking for all of that time
[1:49:32] of 18 years called her a liar mocked her
[1:49:34] and made fun of her
[1:49:36] and she lost her healing and she stopped
[1:49:38] confessing that she was healed
[1:49:41] you see you've got to hold on to that
[1:49:43] word
[1:49:44] if you've been given a word from the
[1:49:47] lord you hold on to that word
[1:49:49] i was given a word from the lord at the
[1:49:52] very beginning of our journey
[1:49:54] that this sickness is not unto death and
[1:49:56] i've held onto that word
[1:49:59] and i want you to know that there's got
[1:50:00] to be a shout
[1:50:02] that matches the miracle
[1:50:11] there will be a people that match what
[1:50:14] the word says
[1:50:17] hallelujah now notice if you're a son
[1:50:21] of god or a daughter of god you were in
[1:50:23] god all the time
[1:50:25] but he knew what bed and time that you'd
[1:50:27] be planted
[1:50:28] so now you're made a creature and son of
[1:50:30] god manifest the son and daughter of god
[1:50:33] to meet the challenge
[1:50:34] of the hour to vindicate the true and
[1:50:37] living
[1:50:38] god of this hour the message that's
[1:50:40] coming forth
[1:50:41] in this time
[1:50:45] you were manifested you can have a
[1:50:48] little swagger about yourself right
[1:50:50] there brother tom
[1:50:51] i was manifested to vindicate the
[1:50:54] message
[1:50:54] that's coming forth in this hour satan
[1:50:57] you can do all you want to move
[1:50:59] to me you can try to stop me but i was
[1:51:02] brought
[1:51:02] forth he knew in which pretty down that
[1:51:05] i be
[1:51:06] planted in and i am manifested to show
[1:51:09] the devil
[1:51:10] exactly who i am
[1:51:16] all blessed to be the name of the lord
[1:51:19] you see faith will
[1:51:20] pull you into a position to know that
[1:51:23] god is with you
[1:51:34] just like sam gar all those years
[1:51:38] all those times end of me coming in
[1:51:43] taking everything you own but one day
[1:51:47] shamgar
[1:51:48] remembered who he was he remembered that
[1:51:51] he had a birthright and he was tied to a
[1:51:53] covenant of the lord
[1:51:55] that he was a circumcised israelite and
[1:51:57] he was standing there
[1:51:58] and it was a time it was a time when the
[1:52:01] philistines was coming in
[1:52:03] and it was at harvest time that when
[1:52:05] those philistines came in to steal from
[1:52:07] him
[1:52:08] and schenger rose up in his position
[1:52:11] and he realized that the god of abraham
[1:52:14] and the god of isaac was
[1:52:16] with him shim guard got some courage
[1:52:20] about himself
[1:52:22] and he brought down 600 philistines
[1:52:30] the bible says in psalms 37 and 39 but
[1:52:33] the salvation of the righteousness is of
[1:52:35] the lord
[1:52:36] he is their strength in a time of
[1:52:38] trouble and the lord shall help them and
[1:52:40] deliver them
[1:52:41] he shall deliver them from the wicked
[1:52:43] and save them because they trust
[1:52:50] because they trust in him you see if you
[1:52:53] trust him
[1:52:54] he'll use you like never before
[1:53:10] ain't no man ever walked out of this
[1:53:11] cave
[1:53:15] ain't nobody ever walked in here came
[1:53:16] out
[1:53:19] but daniel was a man like you and i
[1:53:28] daniel had what we'd call humanly he had
[1:53:31] complexes about him
[1:53:34] he had circumstances of life but daniel
[1:53:38] knew that god was with him
[1:53:42] and daniel could look back
[1:53:45] he could look back to what abraham went
[1:53:48] through
[1:53:49] and he could give him courage in the
[1:53:51] midst of his cave
[1:53:53] he can look back to see what lot went
[1:53:56] through
[1:53:57] and he looked that abraham took 318 of
[1:54:01] his
[1:54:01] of his male servants and he went down
[1:54:03] and recovered all
[1:54:04] that the enemy had stolen
[1:54:09] he could look back there he could see
[1:54:12] what the prophet said
[1:54:14] he realized
[1:54:18] that if god before me
[1:54:21] who can be against me and daniel could
[1:54:25] have
[1:54:26] courage in the midst of his cave
[1:54:30] now anybody can run from a line
[1:54:41] anybody can run from a roaring lion
[1:54:45] but it takes somebody that's got a
[1:54:49] god given courage
[1:54:53] that would look out as the moment that
[1:54:56] they're getting ready to
[1:54:57] be dropped in to a cave that says o king
[1:55:01] i see you in the morning
[1:55:05] though these hungry lions are roaring
[1:55:08] i will see you in the morning though i
[1:55:11] can feel their hot breath
[1:55:13] i will see you in the morning though i'm
[1:55:16] outnumbered
[1:55:17] i will see you in the morning though
[1:55:20] there's
[1:55:20] more form that gets me i will see you in
[1:55:24] the morning
[1:55:30] it takes courage when you're outnumbered
[1:55:33] but i want to tell you brother wanna put
[1:55:35] a flight a thousand
[1:55:37] and two ten thousand you are not alone
[1:55:40] in this battle
[1:55:41] there is a mighty army that has risen up
[1:55:44] with courage
[1:55:50] you can talk about the god of history
[1:55:52] they can talk about the god of the bible
[1:55:54] but it's a time that people start
[1:55:56] lifting him up out of the history
[1:55:58] i love hearing about moses i love
[1:56:00] hearing about paul
[1:56:02] i love hearing about brother branham but
[1:56:04] i want to hear about a god of today
[1:56:08] it's somebody that's not afraid to
[1:56:10] testify or somebody is not afraid
[1:56:12] i sought the holy ghost i believe for
[1:56:15] healing
[1:56:15] i believe for my family
[1:56:20] yeah it didn't look like it was coming
[1:56:23] but even when you don't feel like it's
[1:56:25] coming
[1:56:26] he's still working
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:30] hallelujah i looked past what i saw i
[1:56:33] could tell
[1:56:34] that the doctors was given up but i
[1:56:36] looked past what i saw
[1:56:38] i could see that people gave up on you
[1:56:41] but i looked past what i saw
[1:56:46] it takes a real courage for a pastor to
[1:56:48] stand here
[1:56:49] and you sit there and don't ever move it
[1:56:52] takes real
[1:56:53] courage for that man of god to say i'm
[1:56:56] not giving up
[1:56:57] until there's no breath left in my lungs
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:02] and i'm just the man that i'm not giving
[1:57:06] up
[1:57:06] on any person that's sitting here
[1:57:10] [Applause]
[1:57:17] afraid to shout that's the miracle
[1:57:21] afraid to dance that's the miracle
[1:57:25] afraid to clap your hands max the
[1:57:27] miracle
[1:57:33] oh yes pardon the noise it's just the
[1:57:36] sound of freedom
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:58:02] let's say you gotta go into a boxing
[1:58:05] ring

[1:58:15] is a mammoth ugly looking fella that's
[1:58:18] known as a keeler a killer
[1:58:21] he's not a killer a killer
[1:58:26] but on the inside

[1:58:38] and he slobbering at the mouth
[1:58:43] and he is calling your name out
[1:58:50] it would take some real courage if i

[1:59:11] imagine
[1:59:12] but all you gotta do is hit him one time

[1:59:45] devil down
[1:59:46] and he won't get back up hallelujah
[1:59:51] hallelujah
[1:59:54] brother branham said if i was a great
[1:59:56] beast that was attacking me he said well
[1:59:58] he wouldn't do me no good
[2:00:00] just to cut his claw off he said just
[2:00:02] knock his head off
[2:00:04] oh there's a goliath that's roaring at
[2:00:06] you and boasting

[2:00:10] of revelation
[2:00:11] and it won't get back up
[2:00:16] allow me to lift this guard out of
[2:00:18] history for a moment
[2:00:21] the bible says in daniel 11 and 32
[2:00:27] but the people that do know their god
[2:00:30] shall be strong
[2:00:34] and do exploits
[2:00:38] you need to remind yourself that this is
[2:00:41] what
[2:00:42] he has done surely he can do it again
[2:00:49] when i look out upon a queen
[2:00:53] by the name of sister karen pruitt who
[2:00:56] came
[2:00:57] home on tuesday and had a great big
[2:01:00] welcoming party
[2:01:01] and did a little dance on herself on her
[2:01:03] own porch there
[2:01:05] when doctor said she couldn't live and
[2:01:08] if she would live
[2:01:09] she'd be a vegetable oh i'll tell you
[2:01:12] that'll give you courage in the midst of
[2:01:14] your cave
[2:01:15] that if god could do that for her he can
[2:01:18] do that for me
[2:01:24] there's a lady that's sitting here in
[2:01:25] the front pew that had masses amount of
[2:01:28] lymphatic leukemia
[2:01:30] that was present and they took scans
[2:01:33] and she is cancer-free
[2:01:37] that'll give you courage when you're
[2:01:39] going through a battle
[2:01:41] that if god can do it for her he can do
[2:01:44] it for me
[2:01:45] [Applause]
[2:01:48] you remember us lifting up sister sister
[2:01:50] dottie brian brother nathan bryant's mom
[2:01:53] she had cancer throughout her body had
[2:01:55] nodules on her breasts
[2:01:57] on her neck and in lymph nodes and
[2:01:59] cancer was widespread
[2:02:01] throughout her whole entire abdomen she
[2:02:03] had scans
[2:02:05] this past week and every bit of that
[2:02:07] cancer is completely gone
[2:02:09] except for one small lump that is
[2:02:11] decreased by half
[2:02:13] it's the only thing left and doctor said
[2:02:16] as far as he's concerned she's
[2:02:19] cancer-free
[2:02:22] there's no god like jehovah in 2020
[2:02:26] we're seeing miracles like never before
[2:02:31] hallelujah and it gives me a courage
[2:02:33] that if he can do it for her
[2:02:36] he can do it for sister erica parker
[2:02:46] i talk to my brother george quinn king
[2:02:49] george every week
[2:02:51] and he sends his greetings every week
[2:02:53] but i got this note
[2:02:55] from brother george today and he said
[2:02:58] one important thing we will see miracles
[2:03:02] absolutely he said last week after
[2:03:05] church my daughter said to me
[2:03:07] did you hear that extra voice today i
[2:03:10] said no
[2:03:11] was it an angel voice for we've heard
[2:03:13] them sing with us at times
[2:03:15] she said no well what it is
[2:03:20] here it is the miracle my wife sister
[2:03:23] jacqueline
[2:03:24] did not have an easy childhood being the
[2:03:27] eldest
[2:03:28] her father was a drinker and they got
[2:03:30] treated very badly
[2:03:32] brother george said with that when i met
[2:03:33] her she could not sing
[2:03:35] and when we married i tried my utmost to
[2:03:37] help her to no avail
[2:03:39] she knew every hymn and how it should go
[2:03:41] but could not get the words out
[2:03:43] so my daughter said dad it was mom
[2:03:47] she sang out for the first time perhaps
[2:03:50] in 35 years
[2:03:51] and at the end of the prayer service she
[2:03:54] still can sing
[2:03:58] oh hallelujah there's a bride that's got
[2:04:01] a voice
[2:04:02] we got something to sing about we got
[2:04:04] something to shout about
[2:04:09] hallelujah brother harold they told you
[2:04:13] that you was gonna have you had all
[2:04:14] kinds of ulcers down three intestines
[2:04:17] but they looked through there and the
[2:04:18] scans show that
[2:04:20] we are seeing miracles in 2020
[2:04:23] and they're completely gone
[2:04:28] that will give you courage that no
[2:04:30] matter the darkness of your cave
[2:04:32] you can come out of it
[2:04:39] this morning i woke up and i said god
[2:04:42] let there be an upper room experience
[2:04:43] today
[2:04:44] and before before nine o'clock i had
[2:04:48] done received all of these testimonies
[2:04:50] i said god you're doing it right here in
[2:04:52] this office
[2:04:53] what will you do in the whole house of
[2:04:55] god tonight
[2:05:04] i got this note from brother joseph
[2:05:06] harmon
[2:05:07] he sends his greetings as well
[2:05:09] [Laughter]
[2:05:11] he says has a toaster testimony you
[2:05:13] remember we lifted his mom up for prayer
[2:05:16] his mom was diagnosed the same week that
[2:05:18] brother ron was diagnosed
[2:05:20] she found out about his about his
[2:05:23] sickness she was
[2:05:24] she was eating up with cancer and
[2:05:26] medically there was no hope for her
[2:05:28] cancer in the stomach cancer in the
[2:05:30] lymph nodes
[2:05:31] cancer in the female organs i was moved
[2:05:34] by the holy spirit to pray for her
[2:05:36] and just last week she went back to the
[2:05:39] doctor for a checkup
[2:05:40] and the doctors declared her cancer-free
[2:05:43] there's no trace of it being in our
[2:05:45] bodies
[2:05:46] that doctors are stunned god
[2:05:48] miraculously
[2:05:50] healed her completely
[2:05:54] we will and have
[2:05:57] and are seeing miracles
[2:06:03] at 75 years old you think it's too late
[2:06:06] for god to do a work
[2:06:07] but at 75 years of age when doctors had
[2:06:11] given her no hope
[2:06:12] the fire of god burned the cancer out of
[2:06:14] her body
[2:06:15] and leaving absolutely no trace of it
[2:06:20] [Applause]
[2:06:29] if you don't know this god you can
[2:06:30] experience this god
[2:06:32] if you're listening by the way of the
[2:06:34] internet and you design that upper room
[2:06:37] experience
[2:06:37] you can have that upper room experience
[2:06:40] that
[2:06:41] same god is not bound by time nor
[2:06:44] airwaves
[2:06:45] he's more than able to do exceedingly
[2:06:47] abundantly above
[2:06:48] all that i could ever ask of here think
[2:06:50] of him i could have a brother's dim the
[2:06:59] lights for me
[2:07:05] i believe we ought to be fearless in our
[2:07:06] testimony
[2:07:09] are you with me
[2:07:12] on december the 22nd we was asked to
[2:07:16] trust god
[2:07:17] and he would use us like never before
[2:07:23] shortly after being diagnosed
[2:07:26] with cancer melanoma
[2:07:29] in his lymph nodes and in his lungs

[2:07:52] second picture
[2:07:57] now to me this ain't just working on
[2:08:00] some car
[2:08:02] this is the brain they're dealing with
[2:08:05] and i
[2:08:08] i remember numbers like nothing else and
[2:08:11] so does my dad
[2:08:13] i went in and i asked him directly after
[2:08:16] surgery
[2:08:17] very specific numbers that only he and i
[2:08:20] would know about
[2:08:22] and he was spitting them off like that
[2:08:25] this picture that you see is four days

[2:08:52] aaron's brain was bleeding again
[2:08:54] and that they would have to do more
[2:08:56] surgeries and the doctors were telling
[2:08:58] us
[2:08:58] now the more surgery we do the more
[2:09:02] brain tissue you lose and the memory you
[2:09:04] lose and
[2:09:05] sight you lose and all of these things
[2:09:09] and this is when covet was first
[2:09:11] striking
[2:09:14] and they weren't allowing hardly anybody
[2:09:16] in hospitals

[2:09:22] i went with a purpose i dressed to the
[2:09:25] lines
[2:09:26] and i made sure i got in there
[2:09:29] because i didn't have a commission from
[2:09:31] a doctor but i had a commission from god
[2:09:33] to walk into a hospital room to lay
[2:09:35] hands on a sick
[2:09:37] and they shall recover

[2:10:10] devil's name

[2:12:25] courage
[2:12:26] to walk into a cave and come out of it
[2:12:45] glory be to god the lions tried to shut
[2:12:49] up mouth

[2:13:37] and when i get there i'm gonna have
[2:13:40] church
[2:13:41] i'm not worried about who i'm sitting
[2:13:43] with i'm not worried about what
[2:13:46] everybody
[2:13:46] else is doing i come to have an
[2:13:49] encounter
[2:13:50] with jesus i come to worship the lord
[2:13:55] i come to have a
[2:14:01] [Music]
[2:14:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:14:11] hallelujah
[2:14:14] hallelujah does that look like a man
[2:14:18] that had brain surgery
[2:14:22] does that look like a man that doctors
[2:14:24] had that he'd never preached again
[2:14:26] that he'd never be able to be the same
[2:14:28] man that he was
[2:14:29] i say to you doctors
[2:14:32] oh hallelujah the music is more
[2:14:36] important than the struggle
[2:14:46] that ought to give you courage to get
[2:14:48] out of your cave
[2:14:52] let the musicians come now i've been
[2:14:55] told
[2:14:57] did a little bit of research i've been
[2:14:59] doing this for three weeks
[2:15:01] and i've been trying to every find every
[2:15:04] corner in the cave
[2:15:06] so i could call it out for you and tell
[2:15:08] you you can come out of that cave
[2:15:11] but what i don't know what you call them
[2:15:14] scientists or
[2:15:14] archaeologists but they say the best way
[2:15:18] to explore a cave is to sing
[2:15:22] in it
[2:15:27] they say it's the best way because you
[2:15:29] can find
[2:15:31] it can be dark all around you but if
[2:15:33] you're singing you can find out if then
[2:15:35] you're in a hollow spot a real shallow
[2:15:37] spot
[2:15:39] or you can find out if you're in a great
[2:15:40] big hall
[2:15:42] now a lot of times back before they had
[2:15:44] loudspeakers of things
[2:15:46] what the musicians would do they would
[2:15:49] go and they'd take
[2:15:50] all of their instruments and they would
[2:15:51] go down into these caverns
[2:15:53] and they would have themself a musical
[2:15:55] because of
[2:15:56] all of the sound that was able to let
[2:16:00] it loose in there that they didn't have
[2:16:02] to amplify
[2:16:04] but the cave had the ability to silence
[2:16:07] some
[2:16:10] and it had the ability to echo others
[2:16:14] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:16:17] you see if you're in the midst of your
[2:16:19] cave
[2:16:20] the best place to be able to explore
[2:16:22] your cave
[2:16:23] and find your way out of that cave maybe
