[4:22] tremendous testimony of God's grace and
[4:25] that God is still a miracle working God
[4:28] that's why we're here this evening is
[4:30] because God is still God Amen Acts
[4:34] chapter four and verse seven we'd like
[4:36] to speak to you this evening again on
[4:38] the moment of the miraculous and when
[4:42] they had set them in the midst they
[4:44] asked by what power or by what name have
[4:47] you done this then Peter filled with the
[4:50] Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of
[4:53] the people and elders of Israel if we
[4:56] this day be examined of the good deed
[4:58] done to the impotent man by what means
[5:01] he has made whole be it known unto you
[5:05] all and to all the people of Israel by
[5:08] that by the name of Jesus Christ of
[5:11] Nazareth whom you crucified whom God
[5:13] raised from the dead even by him
[5:16] this man stand here before you hold this
[5:20] is the stone which was set at nought of
[5:23] you builders which has become the head
[5:25] of the corner neither is there salvation
[5:28] in any other for there is none other
[5:31] name under heaven given among men
[5:33] whereby we must be saved now when they
[5:37] saw the boldness of Peter and John and
[5:40] perceived that they were unlearned and
[5:43] ignorant men they marveled and they took
[5:46] knowledge of them that they had been
[5:48] with Jesus and beholding the man which
[5:52] was healed standing with them they could
[5:54] not they could say nothing against it
[5:57] but when they had commanded them to go
[6:00] aside out of the council they conferred
[6:04] amongst themselves saying what shall we
[6:06] do with these men for indeed a notable
[6:09] miracle has been done by them is
[6:13] manifest to all them that dwell in
[6:16] Jerusalem and we cannot denied amen may
[6:20] God bless his word he may be seated this
[6:22] evening I love it when the enemy cannot
[6:26] figure out an excuse I love it when the
[6:29] enemy has to just sit there completely
[6:31] quiet because they know that they can't
[6:33] deny what has taken place in front of
[6:35] them here's a man that that we've read
[6:38] many times in the scriptures we've read
[6:40] over this story how that this man was
[6:43] crippled from his mother's wounds
[6:45] how that he laid there at that beautiful
[6:47] gate day in and day out and would sit
[6:50] there and beg for alms and now this man
[6:53] the Bible tells us if you go on to read
[6:55] that this man was above 40 years old so
[6:58] that the so that the testimony was was
[7:01] more sure because of his age and because
[7:04] of all of his years laying there and
[7:06] setting in that condition it made the
[7:08] miracle more outstanding because of what
[7:12] how prolific the miracle was you can
[7:16] imagine as this man as he had set there
[7:19] by that gate day in and
[7:21] sitting there begging for alms how that
[7:23] how that he would watch normal people
[7:26] how that they would walk he would watch
[7:27] as some people how that they would carry
[7:30] themselves some having a limp and some
[7:33] having a different sway about them he
[7:35] would watch people of of different
[7:37] statures of society men of rich and men
[7:41] of poor he would sit there and watch but
[7:43] no doubt he would long no matter who who
[7:47] passed him how rich they were or what
[7:49] kind of garments they had on I'd say
[7:51] that his mindset was oh if I could only
[7:54] allow my my limbs to operate like their
[7:58] limbs he know when you're in that
[8:00] condition it doesn't really matter money
[8:02] doesn't matter to you it doesn't matter
[8:04] how big a house you're in when you're in
[8:06] that type of a condition you're just
[8:08] waiting for your moment of miraculous
[8:11] and I could imagine his mindset sitting
[8:14] there I've been sitting here I'm all I'm
[8:17] over 40 years old I've been laying here
[8:19] by this gate day in and day out people
[8:22] walk past me and people go by me but yet
[8:25] there's been no help but at this moment
[8:27] that when Peter and John walk past a
[8:30] beautiful gate to go to the house of
[8:32] worship his eyes fell upon different men
[8:35] that day and and when Peter looked on
[8:38] him he knew that he was begging for arms
[8:41] and he looked at him and he said brother
[8:43] Peter is silver and gold have I none but
[8:46] such as I have give are thee in the name
[8:49] of Jesus Christ rise up and walk you see
[8:52] the moment that he had dreamed of the
[8:55] moment that he had laid there and
[8:57] thought about all of his life all of his
[8:59] years laying there was now that moment
[9:02] was standing in front of him only the
[9:04] events that had led up of all of the
[9:07] things that were going through his mind
[9:08] well will I ever be healed
[9:11] will I ever be touched will I ever get
[9:13] up out of my stupor will I ever rise up
[9:16] out of this condition but at this moment
[9:18] all of the events and the process of
[9:21] time had led up to this moment of the
[9:25] miraculous he had to realize that there
[9:28] was more than a man that was standing
[9:31] there but this was none other than Jesus
[9:33] Christ of Nazareth that walked the
[9:35] shores of Galilee that raised Lazarus
[9:38] from the grave that touched the lepers
[9:40] and they were made clean that raised the
[9:43] widow of nain son this was that same God
[9:46] living in his apostles Peter and John
[9:50] his moment was not for verse a done by
[9:54] Jesus in His own corporal body but it
[9:58] was done in his many member body that
[10:01] same God is alive today
[10:03] you see wherever God is it is
[10:06] supernatural because God is a
[10:08] supernatural God and we are witnesses
[10:11] tonight and we are here to prove that
[10:14] there is a living God amongst us can you
[10:16] testify of that that there is a living
[10:18] God amongst us you see where God is it's
[10:21] a supernatural but I want you to know
[10:23] that to God the supernatural is just
[10:26] natural to us whenever a healing takes
[10:29] place or a miracle takes place it's
[10:31] supernatural but with God it's natural
[10:34] you see it's natural for God to be in
[10:37] your car and be reading your book it's
[10:39] natural for God to show up and work
[10:41] miracles in your life
[10:42] it's natural for God to come by your way
[10:45] and speak directly to you it's natural
[10:48] for God because he's God it's natural
[10:51] for God to deliver you from your chains
[10:53] and your bondage of your seeing as your
[10:55] fear it's natural for him to do that
[10:57] because he's God he's God tonight I hope
[11:03] you don't mind me talking about a God
[11:05] that heals because that's what I'm gonna
[11:07] talk about tonight I hope you don't mind
[11:10] me talking about that God that works
[11:12] miracles because that's a God that I'm
[11:14] serving and I have found in life that
[11:16] whenever you go to talking about God God
[11:18] shows up hallelujah all of humanity
[11:24] after the fall of humanity and we look
[11:27] over in the book of Genesis we look at
[11:29] the fall of humanity and and we see
[11:31] there that God had commanded Adam and
[11:34] Eve to not protect of a certain tree of
[11:36] the garden and it was not
[11:38] the Apple in the tree that calls the
[11:41] fall it was the pair on the ground that
[11:43] caused the fall and you see God had
[11:45] foretold when he was cursing the serpent
[11:48] which was an upright beast he was not a
[11:51] reptile but that here at this moment he
[11:53] cursed the beasts the curse that serpent
[11:56] to his belly that he would eat dust the
[11:59] rest of his days but he told him in
[12:01] Genesis chapter 3 and 15 that I will put
[12:04] enmity between thee and the woman and
[12:06] between thy seed and her seed we agree
[12:10] that the woman had a seed and we
[12:12] realized that that was Christ and it
[12:14] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[12:16] bruise his heel we realize it is a
[12:20] well-known predicted it is predicted
[12:23] well known that the predicted bruising
[12:25] of the Serpent's head was in actuality a
[12:29] prophecy concerning what Christ would
[12:32] accomplish against Satan at the cross
[12:34] and there at the cross Christ would
[12:37] bruise the head of Satan and all of the
[12:41] prophets of old were looking for the
[12:43] coming of this serpent Bruce they were
[12:45] looking for the coming of the Messiah
[12:47] and when Christ rose on the scene those
[12:51] that came in contact with him excluding
[12:53] all the unbelievers they recognized him
[12:56] believe that this was the Messiah they
[13:00] recognized that the one that's doing
[13:01] these miracles Nicodemus had to
[13:04] recognize that God was with him
[13:06] Lazarus when he come up out of the grave
[13:08] he recognized he thought it but yet he
[13:10] recognized when he come out of that tomb
[13:13] and he had his old grave close on that
[13:16] there was more than a man that was
[13:18] standing on the outside of that tomb how
[13:20] many of you have been spoken to when you
[13:23] are wrapped up in your grave clothes and
[13:25] you realize that it was more than a man
[13:27] that was talking to you that called you
[13:30] out of the trespasses but their sins in
[13:32] life it was more than a man that read
[13:35] your book it was more than a man that
[13:37] told you to play that tape it was more
[13:39] than a man that told you to come to
[13:41] church and I say to you tonight more
[13:44] than a man is in this building
[13:48] halleluja halleluja
[13:53] but when death came at Calvary all of
[13:56] the disciples and all of his followers
[13:58] they watched him be spit on they watched
[14:01] him as he was ridiculed they watched him
[14:04] as he was mocked and scourged and those
[14:07] that had hoped that this was the Messiah
[14:09] all of their hope seemed to be fading
[14:12] away at this moment it looked like all
[14:15] hope was gone of him being the Messiah
[14:17] after seeing all that the disciples had
[14:20] seen you can imagine all of the miracles
[14:23] that had taken place and Jesus's
[14:25] ministry but all of these things that
[14:28] the disciples had seen seemed to kind of
[14:30] fade away in their memory when they
[14:33] watched their Savior going down when
[14:37] they watched him hang there as he took
[14:39] the crux of the curse it man whoa but
[14:45] they didn't realize the power of the
[14:47] cross that he was going there for them
[14:50] but they watched him as he climbed the
[14:53] Galvez Hill they watched him as he was
[14:56] spit on they watched him as he was
[14:58] whipped they watched him and they
[15:01] thought all hope is gone of this being
[15:04] our Messiah but Jesus would tell them
[15:07] over and over and over again believe me
[15:10] that I am in the father and the Father
[15:12] me
[15:13] and if you can't believe that believe
[15:15] the works that I do for the works that I
[15:18] do prove Who I am the words that Jesus
[15:21] did proved who he was it proved that he
[15:25] was the Messiah he proved when he was
[15:28] there hanging at Calvary that he was
[15:31] everything that God had for ordained
[15:33] before the law began hallelujah all of
[15:39] these miracles as we would stack him up
[15:41] in Jesus's ministry as they would come
[15:44] to pass the Bible says over in the book
[15:46] of John chapter 21 that the Bible could
[15:50] not contain all of the miracles that
[15:53] were done the world could not contain
[15:55] the miracles that were done in the
[15:58] Ministry of Jesus Christ
[15:59] and in the early 1950s brother Badham
[16:02] you'll hear him say in the early 1950s
[16:04] we have seen we have seen him do mighty
[16:08] more miracles in this humble ministry
[16:11] than he did in all of his earthly
[16:12] ministry in three and a half years that
[16:16] same God has amongst us but after seeing
[16:20] all the mighty works that God did still
[16:23] doubt entered into their heart but early
[16:27] on Easter morning early on Easter
[16:31] morning hope began to rise when death
[16:34] could not contain him and the grave
[16:36] could not hold him in that moment in
[16:40] that moment when every bit of sin was
[16:43] hanging in the balance when humanity was
[16:45] hanging in the balance was this mother
[16:49] Messiah or not but in that moment the
[16:51] miraculous took place the same question
[16:54] was settled there forever the
[16:56] requirement had been met hallelujah they
[17:02] watched him bowel Friday but they
[17:04] watched him rise on Sunday hallelujah
[17:08] he's God he looked like a man when he
[17:16] was crying at Lazarus his grief but when
[17:19] he said Lazarus come forth it was more
[17:22] than a man that was speaking and the
[17:24] same son of man is speaking come forth
[17:27] little bride come forth rise up out of
[17:32] your super rather plan of your unbelief
[17:35] rise up this is your moment for gospel
[17:40] lighthouse rasa rasa past her fears
[17:45] razza pester unbelief rise up when he
[17:54] was here on earth he said he was God he
[17:56] looked like God he talked like God he
[17:59] preached like God hallelujah He healed
[18:02] like God heroes like dava he ascended
[18:06] like God because he was God he was God
[18:09] in the flesh
[18:10] God was in his son manifesting himself
[18:12] to his people and that's my god the
[18:19] Bible was never written to show us what
[18:21] God has done in the past but the Bible
[18:24] was written to show us who God is
[18:26] somebody say who God is and what he
[18:29] wants to do in every generation in every
[18:32] walk of life everywhere on earth to live
[18:34] in a people as that's right
[18:39] the Bible says in Genesis 33 excuse me
[18:44] Galatians 3 and 23 the devil don't like
[18:52] me using this microphone he's trying to
[19:00] hit her in every way he can but I got
[19:05] something to deliver tonight Galatians 3
[19:09] and 23 but before faith came we were
[19:14] kept under the law shut up under the
[19:19] faith which was should all should
[19:21] afterwards be revealed you see the law
[19:25] kept us shut up it kept us bound the law
[19:31] only pointed out sin but it had no great
[19:34] sinner law was the policeman but it yet
[19:40] it had no grace in it
[19:45] we're for the law verse 24 was our was
[19:50] our schoolmaster to bring unto us Christ
[19:53] that we might be justified by faith but
[19:58] after that faith has come we are now no
[20:01] longer we are no longer under a
[20:03] schoolmaster for ye are all children of
[20:07] God by faith
[20:08] somebody say by faith we are all the
[20:13] children of God by faith excuse me in
[20:16] Christ Jesus for as many of you as of
[20:19] you have been baptized into Christ have

[21:48] seed and heirs according to the promise
[21:52] God give has given us a sure promise to
[21:57] Abraham seed that in blessing I will
[22:00] bless thee and in multiplying I will
[22:02] multiply thee and thy seed shall possess
[22:05] the gate of his enemies you were elected
[22:08] to this before the foundation of the
[22:10] world you were born to be serpent
[22:13] bruisers before there was a world you
[22:16] were elected to it you were elected to
[22:19] take a hold of it and you will win the
[22:21] battle

[22:49] him and if ye be Christ's he cannot
[22:53] destroy you because you are a part of
[22:56] God
[22:57] [Applause]
[23:01] I'm a part of God I'm an heir of
[23:05] salvation purchase of God we are a
[23:10] people that's been called by his name
[23:12] same life same power the Book of Daniel
[23:16] tells us that the people that do know
[23:18] their God will be strong and shall do
[23:22] exploits Paul said in the book of
[23:24] Ephesians 5 and 27 that this church
[23:27] would be a glorious church without spot
[23:30] without wrinkle and without a blemish
[23:33] there's nothing that's laid at your
[23:36] Accord
[23:37] the blood of Jesus Christ has made you
[23:40] sinless the blood of Jesus Christ has
[23:44] made you justified as if you've never
[23:46] done it before the world began you never
[23:49] did it to begin with
[23:51] God did not see you in your sin God did
[23:55] not see you in your despair God seen you
[23:58] in perfection the devil would support to
[24:02] you and point you to your mistakes and
[24:05] point to your failures but you point to
[24:08] Christ that's what God seen you as
[24:13] [Applause]
[24:17] improving his word he said we should
[24:20] realize that in us has been given we who
[24:24] believe Jesus Christ and been born of
[24:27] his spirit and filled with that
[24:28] quickening power that power that's in
[24:31] you somebody say Amen by laying on hands
[24:36] on the others like the disciples did and
[24:39] down through the age
[24:40] it's absolutely heal the sick it's
[24:43] raised the dead it showed visions and
[24:45] prophecies and the very same spirit that
[24:48] lived amongst the early apostles is
[24:51] living in the church today working the
[24:54] very same things and as quick as we can
[24:57] recognize that no matter how much it's
[25:00] working you've got to recognize and
[25:02] believe that he won't do you one bit of
[25:05] good until you believe it he won't do
[25:09] you one bit of good till you believe but
[25:11] the
[25:11] moment that you believe your troubles
[25:15] are ended the moment that you believe it
[25:21] your troubles are in you know God is
[25:25] omnipotent he's all-powerful God's not
[25:28] not big heavy spots and guy he's not not
[25:31] little bitty weak spots every every
[25:34] little bit of touch of God he's
[25:36] omnipotent the least little touch of God
[25:38] he's omnipotent who I could preach all
[25:43] night just from that one quote right
[25:45] there the least little touch of God he's
[25:47] all-powerful you know dad used to work
[25:51] in the Arsenal in the government there
[25:52] whether they made nitroglycerine and
[25:55] that dad would come and he would tell us
[25:57] of these stories about men that would
[25:59] take just a little tablespoon of
[26:01] nitroglycerin and they set it on a stump
[26:03] and shoot it from several hundred yards
[26:05] away and he would blow a stump
[26:08] completely out of the ground just that
[26:10] little bit of nitroglycerin would blow a
[26:13] stump out of the ground why one day we
[26:17] was down at a yard and we was working
[26:19] and the man was telling us that this
[26:21] material this piece of metal that we
[26:24] were buying it came out of the Arsenal
[26:27] in which that worked him and when he
[26:29] began to tell to have that dad looked at
[26:31] it he said yeah he said I remember that
[26:33] I remember that piece of material I
[26:36] remember that how how that those things
[26:37] were there in the Arsenal and great dad
[26:40] just grabbed that piece of metal and
[26:42] just threw it up on the trailer I took a
[26:46] great big step back because I had heard
[26:49] the stories of what nitroglycerin would
[26:51] do that if a building would go off it
[26:54] would blow down in the ground several
[26:56] hundred feet and they would have to go
[26:58] in there and if somebody was in there
[27:00] and looked for bodies I knew what
[27:01] nitroglycerine could do and here dad
[27:04] just takes that thing and throws it on
[27:07] the trailer I'm glad it didn't blow up
[27:11] but you think about the natural power of
[27:14] nitroglycerin of what it can do what
[27:16] about the power of God the least little
[27:19] touch of God when he touches your life
[27:21] touches your sin touches your sickness
[27:24] touches your life it'll completely set
[27:27] you free it'll blow it'll blow the gates

[29:19] tributes in your life to demonstrate
[29:21] that there's no God like Jehovah and I

[29:31] power
[29:32] he loves to declare that he's God he
[29:35] loves to declare and decree there's no
[29:37] god like him but God on that hand does

[37:15] there and he was standing there and he
[37:17] said thou our mighty man of Valor and
[37:20] the Lord is with thee and Gideon said if
[37:23] God before us why is all of these things
[37:26] befallen us while we out here hiding and
[37:28] threshing wheat in a in in a field under
[37:31] an oak tree we're all back here we're
[37:33] scared we ain't got no courage at all if
[37:35] God is for us then why are all these
[37:38] things befallen us I wonder sometimes if
[37:41] that ain't our attitude why is it me
[37:44] pour me pour me pour me if God is for us
[37:47] then where's his miracles if that's your
[37:51] resolution tonight here's your miracle
[37:55] if you think God don't do it no more if
[37:58] you're a miracle tonight I want you to
[38:00] stand up if God be for us then we're be
[38:06] all of his miracles they're right here
[38:20] hallelujah hallelujah god bless you
[38:30] could be seated
[38:33] you see when Gideon begin to act upon
[38:37] God's Word he then seen the miracle when
[38:40] he went in and got himself a kid got a
[38:43] goat and took it out there and placed it
[38:44] upon the altar and the angel of the Lord
[38:47] touched it with a rod and consumed it
[38:49] with fire he's seen the miracle working
[38:52] God was with him and if you will ever
[38:55] lay yourself upon the altar and
[38:57] sacrifice your life you begin to see the
[39:01] miracles of God you see how are you
[39:04] going to see the miracles of God until
[39:07] you become a miracle of God this man had
[39:12] somet God that God ordained him that he
[39:16] took 300 men and went down and destroyed
[39:19] a hundred and thirty-five thousand
[39:21] Midianites the odds were stacked up
[39:24] against him it was four hundred to 1
[39:27] million nights against the years her
[39:28] life but when God is your partner and
[39:31] when God is fighting on your side no
[39:35] weapon that is formed against me shall
[39:38] prosper he will give you a battle plan
[39:41] that will make sure you come out
[39:43] victorious he'll give you a battle plan
[39:45] that will show you that you're on the
[39:48] winning side you look dull you look over
[39:58] in the book of Exodus and you see the
[40:00] mighty man mighty hand of God that God
[40:03] was a mighty man of war when he'd come
[40:05] down and he produced 10 major miracles
[40:08] that were done there in Egypt God's
[40:11] power was shown and the enemy was
[40:13] thwarted sure they had their
[40:15] impersonators sure they had their
[40:18] impersonators but who was first it was
[40:21] Moses you see they could go along with
[40:25] all of their miracles and all of those
[40:27] things trying to follow right in with
[40:29] Moses but Moses is you remember when
[40:33] Moses threw down his rod and then they
[40:35] threw down those magicians of Janus and
[40:38] Jambres flew down there odd Moses his
[40:40] rod ate up the impersonators this word
[40:44] will eat up the impersonators any day of
[40:47] the week this word will defeat Satan any
[40:50] time any place under any circumstance
[40:56] time after time God show forth his power
[40:59] so that he was a miracle working God and
[41:03] finally it come down to it that the
[41:05] enemy Pharaoh decided to let God's
[41:08] people go but you know one thing I have
[41:11] found about how about the devil sister
[41:13] Stephanie is that he's a stupid ever
[41:17] after the children of Israel walk out in
[41:20] Egypt they walk out of the cosmos here
[41:24] the enemy comes chasing them again the
[41:27] enemy loves to put his fear tactics over
[41:29] upon you and tell you that you'll never
[41:31] be able to be free but God's got a word
[41:35] for you that where the Spirit of the
[41:36] Lord is there is Liberty there's a
[41:40] freedom in this place that if you feel
[41:42] like you can't be set free there's a God
[41:45] that's here that's got the keys to the
[41:48] chains that are holding you bound and
[41:55] the enemy chased them all the way down
[41:57] to the Red Sea and it looks like that
[42:00] that the enemy had dogs children backed
[42:03] up into a corner but I have found in
[42:05] life that God that's where he shows up
[42:08] is when you look like you're backed in a
[42:11] corner when all of humanity was backed
[42:13] in a corner
[42:14] Adams race was backed in a corner there
[42:17] came one from heaven and when the
[42:19] children of Israel went back into a
[42:22] corner when the air when the Pharaoh and
[42:24] all of his army were breathing down upon
[42:27] them it looked like they were backed up
[42:32] into a corner and then there came a
[42:34] voice in that moment that spake unto
[42:38] Moses walk rock speaking and go forward
[42:42] this process this was a process
[42:46] that led to a moment of the miraculous
[42:51] for over 440 years the process of time
[42:56] was going on but at that moment the
[42:58] miraculous showed up that Red Sea had
[43:02] been there since God created in the
[43:04] world but God chose this place
[43:09] hallelujah God chose this place to drown
[43:12] his enemy in since before the time began
[43:20] but God chose that place to destroy his
[43:24] enemy how about you tonight the Bloods
[43:27] been there for 2,000 years it's been
[43:30] there
[43:30] God the lamb God's lamb was slain before
[43:32] the foundation of the world he saw the
[43:36] perfect place to destroy your enemy and
[43:39] in the blood of Jesus Christ how this
[43:46] process led to a miracle that'll never
[43:49] be forgotten we're two million people
[43:51] walked across on dry land he's still the
[43:56] same God you see because of this miracle
[43:59] lives have been changed I was telling
[44:05] about the miracle of this in Arkansas
[44:07] not too long ago I was telling about all
[44:10] of the odds that have been stacked up
[44:12] against God's children and stacked up
[44:14] against God but God knew exactly God
[44:17] knew exactly how to get his children
[44:19] across and there was a sister there that
[44:21] was dealing with fibromyalgia and in
[44:24] that instance she stood up and said if
[44:26] God can do that
[44:28] what about my sickness if God can do all
[44:34] of that what about depression
[44:35] what about anxiety because of this
[44:41] miracle
[44:42] Rahab had faith to apply the token
[44:44] because of this miracle Jericho was all
[44:47] walled in and shut up and their hearts
[44:50] melted and courage had left them here
[44:56] was a miracle inside of a
[45:01] and I wonder how many miracles are
[45:04] laying on the inside of you I wonder
[45:08] when you decide to raise your voice I
[45:11] wonder when you decide to let out your
[45:14] shout how many miracles are coming out
[45:18] of Rahab's house
[45:19] I wonder tonight I wonder if there's
[45:25] some mamas and daddies or sisters or
[45:28] brothers that say mama daddy get in this
[45:32] household get under this token get under
[45:35] here because that's coming us out that's
[45:38] coming to shout get in here the walls
[45:42] are coming around but you're a sword
[45:44] under this token you will be safe and
[45:48] you will be secure there's miracles in
[45:51] the miracle and when the children of
[45:58] Israel got on the other side of this
[46:00] miracle there came a sound when they got
[46:04] on the other side of the Red Sea there
[46:07] became a sound that will never be
[46:09] forgotten because they had seen their
[46:12] taskmasters
[46:13] they had seen the ones that had whipped
[46:15] them time and time again they had seen
[46:18] they had seen they had seen their
[46:21] Avenger cast into the sea and they seen
[46:25] chariot wheels fly out floating up to
[46:28] the top of the Red Sea you talking about
[46:31] a feeling when you look out there and
[46:35] you see the enemy that once held you
[46:37] bound is completely destroy that enemy
[46:40] that keeps telling you that you're gonna
[46:42] have to put up with anxiety the rest of
[46:45] your life I want you to know he's a
[46:46] roaring line but he ain't got no teeth
[46:49] in his mouth he can roar oh he wants to
[46:54] but it's barked his bark is way louder
[46:58] than his bite
[47:02] oh yeah you can breathe down my neck all
[47:07] you want to you can tell me I'm going to
[47:10] be two feet at all you won't to but let
[47:12] me get on the other side of the blood
[47:15] let me get on the other side of the
[47:18] blood yeah
[47:22] hallelujah let me get on the other side
[47:24] of the Red Sea and that's coming out of
[47:27] shout it's coming out of dance on the
[47:34] other side that's coming out of praise
[47:37] on the other side that's coming out of
[47:41] my voice a worship that's coming out of
[47:44] my mouth of praise that's coming out of
[47:46] my mouth uh shall I hallelujah I think
[47:49] you're Jesus that's coming out of my
[47:50] mouth on the other side of the issue
[47:55] hello did their sound match their
[48:05] miracle Exodus 15 and 1 then sang Moses
[48:12] who you're talking about a song singing
[48:16] service yeah well the Mathew sometimes
[48:19] when I get up here and I lead services
[48:21] sometimes when you lead service it's
[48:23] almost more than you could handle
[48:24] because the people have come expected
[48:27] you know you know when you walk to this
[48:29] pulpit that those they're children of
[48:31] God have come to worship you know that
[48:33] sometimes that yes sometimes you're just
[48:35] pushing you're trying you sticking that
[48:37] plow in trying to get that ground
[48:39] fertile but there's some times when you
[48:41] walk out here and it feels like every
[48:43] hair on your heads blowing backwards
[48:45] because there's a children of God that
[48:48] are under expectation they have seen a
[48:50] mighty God in action and he's worth
[48:52] praising could you imagine the prophet
[48:55] Moses as he began to sing this song how
[48:59] he felt hallelujah
[49:04] I don't know how long Moses his beard
[49:06] was but I'd say ever he would every hair
[49:10] home there was sticking completely
[49:11] straight out
[49:14] there's some times when I get to singing
[49:16] up here it feels like everybody every
[49:19] one of these red hairs I got on my head
[49:21] I standing completely out and I'm
[49:23] thankful for the jail that I put on my
[49:25] hair or I'd look like one of these
[49:27] crazies today because there's a
[49:32] supernatural God that is and that is
[49:35] accepting I worship and then Moses sang
[49:40] and the children of Israel this song
[49:44] unto the Lord and spake saying I will

[50:58] concealed in the heart of the sea the

[51:22] the sea covered them they say kiss
[51:26] in the mighty waters who is likened to
[51:29] the Lord among the gods who is like unto

[51:48] Michael Jordan and Tom Brady and LeBron
[51:50] James like this God can those god save
[51:54] you from the Red Sea can those God save
[51:57] you from the chariots but this God has
[52:03] so said as I upon you that he will not
[52:06] lose you and he will not leave you and
[52:09] he will not forsake you no matter what
[52:13] you're going through even when you don't
[52:15] feel in working I know that you're
[52:18] working even when I don't see that
[52:21] you're working I know that you're
[52:23] working because you never stop you never
[52:26] stop you never stop working my god
[52:38] Daniel Williams came to Tim Pruett
[52:41] service when he when he had got into a
[52:43] spa and his last service that he
[52:45] preached there I believe he came to the
[52:47] pulpit what checked himself out of the
[52:50] hospital after he had had surgeries and
[52:53] different things and he walked to the
[52:55] pulpit and preached about the God that I
[52:57] serve he said I don't know about the
[53:02] gods of the sports room I don't know
[53:04] about the gods of the professor's I
[53:06] don't know about the gods of Congress
[53:08] but this God this God I know about that
[53:11] God I know that this God works miracles
[53:13] I know that this God is a healer I want
[53:21] you to try this God tonight and see if
[53:24] he fits the bill and I promise you that
[53:27] he will they were shouting because the
[53:33] miracle
[53:35] their sound was matching the miracle you
[53:44] know we got our critics today the
[53:51] critics of our praise the critics of our
[53:55] worship the critics of our preaching and
[53:58] they're even here tonight we got our
[54:01] critics of praise and our critics of
[54:03] worship they're trying to tell us how we
[54:06] should and how we shouldn't worship God
[54:08] they tell us what type of songs that we
[54:11] need to sing but those critics of raise
[54:15] are under the same inspiration as Mikkel
[54:18] David's wife they're under the same
[54:21] inspiration today
[54:23] she was critical not necessarily of King
[54:26] David but she was critical of the praise
[54:28] that was due God and it's the same
[54:32] spirit today that brings about an
[54:35] unfruitful life from that point forward
[54:38] Mike Hale never was able to have
[54:41] children because she criticized the
[54:44] worship of God you see not necessarily
[54:48] were they critical are they critical of
[54:51] me or critical of sister can't see a
[54:53] critical brother Donnie or critical of
[54:56] sister Debra but they're critical of the
[54:59] praise that is to God they're not
[55:02] critical of me that critical of the
[55:05] praise that's to the king but you know
[55:09] as I said last night that God is an
[55:12] object of worship and he deserves to be
[55:15] praised he deserves to be worshipped
[55:25] you see the reason why people never
[55:28] change it's because and maybe they've
[55:30] never made a move it's because they have
[55:33] never experienced the god of miracles
[55:35] they never walked him behind the veil
[55:38] and they never walked back there and got
[55:40] rebaptised God she got there got a
[55:43] renewing of their mind and a
[55:45] transformation of the heart they're
[55:48] critical of our praise they're critical
[55:50] of our worship they critical of our
[55:52] dance but as I say before I don't care
[55:55] what the devil don't like I'm gonna
[55:57] praise him with all of my mind if I feel
[56:02] like praising him that's what I'm gonna
[56:04] do if I feel like dancing that's what
[56:07] I'm gonna do if the Spirit of God moves
[56:09] on me
[56:10] to speak in an unknown tongue that's
[56:12] exactly what I'm gonna do you don't like
[56:17] myself my shout it's just matching my
[56:20] miracle if you've seen your taskmaster
[56:31] drowning in the blood of Jesus it would
[56:34] give you something to shout about the
[56:37] reason why you can't shout is because
[56:39] you're still holding on to the chains
[56:41] that are holding you bail you love
[56:43] hanging on to that old dead folk old
[56:46] form of worship you like hanging on to
[56:51] those old hymns that nobody ever moves
[56:54] and they're so quiet that you can hear a
[56:56] Churchmouse moving but I believe that if
[56:59] you ever get to heaven it's going to be
[57:01] loud in heaven and if you go to hell
[57:04] it's gonna be loud inhale
[57:16] hello the reason I worship him it's
[57:22] because the miracle oh yeah
[57:29] somebody's gonna rise up somebody's
[57:32] gonna rise up they say well I'm gonna
[57:34] sit here and I'm gonna do what I'm gonna
