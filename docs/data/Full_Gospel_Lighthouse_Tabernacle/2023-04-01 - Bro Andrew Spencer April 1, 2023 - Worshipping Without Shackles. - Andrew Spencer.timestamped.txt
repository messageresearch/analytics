[48:23] be around brother Quinn I'd say that
[48:25] you've missed out in life because
[48:27] brother Quinn is is such a gentleman and
[48:30] he's a man that I we grew up as a
[48:32] Spencer family he was in our home he was
[48:34] he worked with us he's just he's been
[48:37] he's just been a real friend to us even
[48:39] through the past three years the
[48:42] friendship that brother Quinn has had
[48:44] with us throughout throughout our life
[48:46] it just grew even richer throughout the
[48:49] past three years so we want to be
[48:50] remembering him also uh brother Aaron
[48:53] Oglesby his his father passed away which
[48:57] it was uh it was expected but yet even
[48:59] then it's it's still hard losing your
[49:01] father I spoke with brother Aaron
[49:03] several times this week and before
[49:05] brother brother Aaron had had spoke with
[49:08] him the last time he was speaking with
[49:10] him was Monday and maybe one other time
[49:12] on Wednesday but brother Aaron was due
[49:14] to preach at brother Donnie Reagan's a
[49:16] youth service this weekend and the last
[49:19] time brother Ross was able to speak he
[49:20] told him he said whatever you do don't
[49:22] cancel your trip
[49:24] you see those young people mattered in
[49:27] that Eternal realm there's no such thing
[49:29] as death you don't even think about
[49:30] those things you're thinking about the
[49:32] Eternal things so we we certainly
[49:34] appreciate a hero of Faith like that can
[49:37] see the value in the service and so we
[49:40] just want to be remembering the Oglesby
[49:43] family there so we just asked the Lord
[49:46] would Minister to them I also want to
[49:48] make mention to you that Louisiana Camp
[49:51] would be this coming week and many of
[49:54] the church here I think there's around
[49:55] 30 35 will be headed down there to to
[49:58] brother Pruitt's
[50:00] Easter Camp there and so we'll just ask
[50:03] that the Lord would would just be in it
[50:05] all and young people you you just
[50:08] take care of all the things that you
[50:10] need to take care of and and make sure
[50:12] to bring a rain jacket and an umbrella
[50:15] of the weather looks like that but I
[50:16] believe there's going to be some Holy
[50:19] Ghost reign as well so so I ask you to
[50:21] be Mentor remembering brother Ron
[50:23] brother Donnie and myself in prayer will
[50:25] be ministering there this this week Lord
[50:27] willing also next weekend brother
[50:30] William and brother Matthew will be
[50:31] speaking here for you next weekend so I
[50:33] know that they will appreciate your
[50:35] prayers
[50:36] and in remembering them I know that the
[50:38] Lord's been dealing with them upon some
[50:40] thoughts and so we just asked that the
[50:42] Lord would get in it and just maybe we
[50:44] had just a wonderful time in the Lord
[50:46] and so how many he's come expecting here
[50:48] tonight

[51:11] the Lord of all our heart here
[51:13] he means everything to us and I tell you
[51:16] I tell you this message is our life here
[51:18] and I don't know anything else but this
[51:21] message but I know that the message
[51:22] works so so we just greet you tonight in
[51:26] the name of the Lord and say just come
[51:27] on in with us tonight and
[51:30] I spoke some of these things while I was
[51:32] there in in Oklahoma
[51:34] and I would like to labor on some of
[51:38] these slots again tonight and and
[51:41] musicians you can you can be seated now
[51:43] so thank you for thank you for staying
[51:45] there
[51:46] um but we we labored on some of these
[51:48] thoughts and tonight I'd like to just
[51:50] just gather some inspiration the Lord
[51:53] and giving us some fresh inspiration
[51:55] upon these thoughts and while I was
[51:58] while I was there in Oklahoma the Lord
[52:01] had had dealt with me to specifically
[52:03] speak upon a thought there for that
[52:06] meeting
[52:07] on worship worship Warriors worship
[52:10] Warriors and and if you're you've been
[52:13] around for a little bit of time and you
[52:15] know that that statement comes from our
[52:17] pastor talking about worship Warriors
[52:19] and and song leaders that that would do
[52:22] war and worship and and I just felt very
[52:24] directed to take some things upon that
[52:26] line of thought in the Lord certainly
[52:28] got behind it and even even there were
[52:31] multiple counts throughout the weekend
[52:34] where the the spirit of the Lord was
[52:36] seen in a Milky presence a heavy milky
[52:39] presence and and the Lord got behind it
[52:41] and it was a real blessing but I'd like
[52:43] to just gather some of those those
[52:46] things and I'd like to speak to you
[52:48] tonight on worshiping without shackles
[52:52] worshiping without shackles and man if
[52:55] you have your Bibles tonight we'd like
[52:57] to look in the book of Ephesians chapter
[52:59] 6 and verse 10 Joshua chapter 5 and then
[53:03] also John chapter 4 verse 23
[53:06] amen amen we certainly love the word of
[53:10] the Lord it means it means so much to us
[53:13] in this hour when men try to do away
[53:15] with the word of God it is our refuge
[53:18] and it is our place of rest and we find
[53:21] the great hope in this hour in the word
[53:24] of God is that right
[53:27] amen amen let's let's just speak to the
[53:30] author of the word before we dive into
[53:32] the message tonight Heavenly Father we
[53:35] come before you tonight Lord we humble
[53:37] our hearts before you Lord Jesus and we
[53:40] recognize the Lord that your presence is
[53:42] here Lord I personally have watched and
[53:45] watched how you got into the songs
[53:47] Tonight Lord Jesus to line up my
[53:49] thoughts Lord Jesus to to just set a
[53:51] course father for these for these
[53:54] Services here tonight Lord and I pray
[53:56] father that you would just come Lord I
[53:58] know that your word is real and I know
[54:00] it is preeminent father but I pray that
[54:02] sonidas as we as your humble children we
[54:05] yield ourselves over to the power of the
[54:07] Holy Ghost and we invite you father to
[54:10] speak from Heaven father to our hearts
[54:12] Lord Jesus we remember the Quinn family
[54:15] the Oglesby family and the other needs
[54:17] Lord that are presented here we ask
[54:20] father that your Holy Spirit would come
[54:22] tonight and you would just just get into
[54:24] the word father and let us get aside
[54:26] let's inside every thought and every
[54:28] fear and every little anxious feeling
[54:31] that we might feel in the room but
[54:32] father I pray Lord as we would labor in
[54:35] these thoughts tonight that your Holy
[54:37] Spirit would would get into it father
[54:39] and that you would just grab it father
[54:41] and take it to a a higher place than
[54:43] what we could even expect for you to
[54:45] take it Lord we are looking unto you you
[54:48] are the author and the finisher of our
[54:51] faith father we know God that you're
[54:53] going to do something special father
[54:55] here tonight Lord even things in my
[54:57] study today Lord that that you begin to
[55:00] reveal to me I just look unto you Lord
[55:02] tonight and as father Lord like those
[55:05] like those men that came to see you that
[55:07] we would see you father and that that
[55:09] we'd not be mistaken or if we would not
[55:11] be misled by looking at the veil but let
[55:14] us see you father
[55:16] open-facedly Lord not through a glass
[55:18] Darkly but let us see you father Lord we
[55:21] commit all of these things unto you in
[55:24] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[55:26] and man
[55:28] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10.
[55:31] finally my brethren be strong in the
[55:34] Lord and in the power of His might
[55:37] put on the whole armor of God that you
[55:40] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[55:43] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[55:45] flesh and blood but against
[55:47] principalities against Powers against
[55:49] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[55:52] against spiritual wickedness in high
[55:55] places Joshua chapter 5 and verse 13 and
[55:59] while you're turning there we want to
[56:01] thank the Lord that he was he was with
[56:03] sister Faith in the school there at
[56:05] Shenandoah Elementary this past week and
[56:07] and I know that that's a very scary
[56:10] situation the world is on edge right now
[56:12] from the the constant Wows of the devil
[56:16] that are roaring and that's why we plead
[56:18] the blood of Jesus Christ across this
[56:20] congregation we speak Psalms 91 every
[56:23] morning over this congregation and I
[56:25] know we live in a scary world but we
[56:27] have a great big God that that knows how
[56:29] to wrap his arms around his children
[56:31] amen Joshua chapter 5 and verse 13 and
[56:35] it came to pass that when Joshua was
[56:37] about miracle that he lifted up his eyes
[56:39] and looked and behold there stood a man
[56:41] over against him with his sword at drawn
[56:44] in his hand and Joshua went unto him and
[56:47] said unto him art thou for us or for our
[56:50] adversaries and he said nay but as a
[56:52] captain of the host of the Lord am I now
[56:54] come and Joshua notice that Joshua fell
[56:58] on his face to the Earth notice where he
[57:00] was he was by Jericho he was looking at
[57:03] the problem that was in front of him but
[57:05] notice immediately that his Focus
[57:08] changes from what he was looking at
[57:10] Jericho and now he is worshiping the
[57:13] host of the Lord and the Bible said and
[57:16] Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and
[57:18] did worship him and said unto him what
[57:21] saith my Lord unto his servant and the
[57:23] captain of the Lord's host said unto
[57:25] Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot
[57:28] for the place where on thou standest is
[57:31] Holy and catch these four words and
[57:33] Joshua did so
[57:35] and Joshua did so John chapter 4 and
[57:38] verse 23 while you're turning there we
[57:41] many times we read over the scriptures
[57:43] and we read over The Very word of God
[57:45] and sometimes we we miss the very key
[57:47] elements of it the reason why Joshua was
[57:50] doing these things was exactly because
[57:52] the word was telling him to do these
[57:55] things the reason why we should be doing
[57:57] anything in this life is because the
[57:59] word of the Lord has told us to do so I
[58:02] believe that if we pray we ought to do
[58:04] it by the word of God I believe that if
[58:06] we speak we ought to do it by the word
[58:08] of God and I believe that if we worship
[58:10] we ought to worship by the word of God
[58:12] John chapter 4 and verse 23 but the hour
[58:15] cometh and now is when the true
[58:18] worshipers I say that together the true
[58:21] worshipers shall worship the father in
[58:23] spirit and in truth for the father
[58:26] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[58:30] spirit and they that worship Him must
[58:33] worship Him in spirit and in truth may
[58:37] God bless his word he may be seated in
[58:39] the presence of the Lord and brother
[58:41] Brandon said here in Gabriel's
[58:42] instructions to Daniel he said I like to
[58:45] worship don't you
[58:53] now we don't come to church just to hear
[58:55] a sermon that goes with it he said but
[58:57] we come to church to worship Worship in
[59:01] the spirit and in truth you've heard the
[59:04] truth that's the word he said but now to
[59:06] worship is to express yourself to Him
[59:10] worship is to express yourself to him
[59:14] and to think about these thoughts that
[59:15] tonight that that worship without
[59:18] shackles to worship without shackles and
[59:20] I think about all of the songs that
[59:22] we're saying tonight that fear was a
[59:25] liar and and I think it's something
[59:27] amazing that is laying there there isn't
[59:29] any rock that is going to stand or sing
[59:31] in my placement and tonight to realize
[59:34] that we are serving we are serving in a
[59:37] very amazing God who is who is always
[59:39] faithful in our trials in our troubles
[59:42] in our victories in our good times and
[59:45] in our bad times our God is faithful and
[59:48] he knows how to speak to us according to
[59:50] his word and in our current life crisis
[59:53] that we're at he knows how to drop a
[59:55] word in due season for where we are
[59:58] living at it God reveals himself in
[1:00:00] truth and so that he may be worshiped in
[1:00:04] truth he reveals himself in truth so
[1:00:06] that he can be worshiped in truth you
[1:00:08] see God has not revealed himself in
[1:00:10] falsehood because we are not worshiping
[1:00:13] in falsehood we are worshiping him in
[1:00:15] the truth and I believe it's an amazing
[1:00:17] thing tonight that that even right here
[1:00:20] while the word of God is being being
[1:00:22] released that that our worship is going
[1:00:24] to a place that no man could take us to
[1:00:27] that to realize that that even while
[1:00:30] you're sitting there in your seats and
[1:00:31] you begin to amen the word of God and
[1:00:34] you begin to feel the very cool presence
[1:00:36] of the Holy Ghost maybe move across you
[1:00:38] and maybe touch you in a different way
[1:00:40] what is it our God is a very danger a
[1:00:43] tangible God and he wants to be touched
[1:00:45] he wants to be felt he wants to be
[1:00:47] handled and some of the greatest
[1:00:49] Miracles that I've ever seen is when you
[1:00:51] are worshiping God and I know that there
[1:00:53] there's a lot a lot of people that maybe
[1:00:54] understand what I say right here but the
[1:00:57] time to worship Him is not necessarily
[1:00:59] when the music is going on it's right
[1:01:02] now while the word of God is going forth
[1:01:04] that is the greatest time to worship him
[1:01:06] because you see what magnifies our
[1:01:09] worship when the music gets in it is
[1:01:11] because our a man has been caught up
[1:01:14] with the word of God that takes us as I
[1:01:17] said if we're going to do anything we
[1:01:19] ought to do it by the word of God I
[1:01:20] believe that if we're going to a man the
[1:01:22] word of God then we ought to be able to
[1:01:24] recognize why we're saying Amen to the
[1:01:27] word of God and when we begin to say so
[1:01:30] be it over that word that was dropped
[1:01:33] you recognize that it is taking you from
[1:01:36] the natural realm that's what worship
[1:01:38] does it takes you from the things that
[1:01:40] you see to the things that God's wanting
[1:01:42] to manifest in your life and I think
[1:01:45] it's an amazing thing tonight that we
[1:01:47] can worship him without shackles upon
[1:01:49] our life now brother man I would preach
[1:01:52] a message many times from Jeremiah where
[1:01:55] he would read that is there no bomb in
[1:01:58] Gilead and Jeremiah 8 and 22 the Bible
[1:02:01] said that is there no bomb in Gilead is
[1:02:05] there no physician there then why then
[1:02:07] is not the health of the daughter of my
[1:02:10] people recovered and you see what God
[1:02:12] was saying I've got I've got I've got
[1:02:15] the healing right here I've got a bomb
[1:02:17] for her then why is she not recovered
[1:02:19] and brother Brandon would preach from
[1:02:21] that thought of why or or there's bomb
[1:02:24] there in Gilead but notice what brother
[1:02:26] Bynum says here in 1962 in the message
[1:02:29] why he said I challenge every person in
[1:02:32] here to believe that inoculation
[1:02:35] I challenge every person in here to
[1:02:38] believe that inoculation he said Do you
[1:02:40] believe it all of you believed it then
[1:02:42] stand upon your feet and receive your
[1:02:44] healing in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:02:46] he said that's right amen now notice he
[1:02:49] speaks to a lady that's in a wheelchair
[1:02:51] he said take your chair and push it on
[1:02:53] home there she is up out of the chair
[1:02:56] for the kingdom of God do you believe it
[1:02:58] Glory now don't you see that he's here
[1:03:02] the inoculation the bomb is here glory
[1:03:05] to God believe it friends don't you be
[1:03:07] afraid to trust him Hallelujah where's
[1:03:10] your faith he said now you feel
[1:03:12] different don't you say sir you take
[1:03:14] your own wheelchair now and go home and
[1:03:16] be well don't you doubt don't you doubt
[1:03:19] he said just keep the same faith that
[1:03:21] you got if you've got enough you know a
[1:03:24] woman touched His Garment well you did
[1:03:26] the same thing then go ahead and believe
[1:03:28] it he said you keep the same faith that
[1:03:31] you got the faith that got you out of
[1:03:33] your sickness is a faith that'll keep
[1:03:35] you out of your sickness you keep the
[1:03:37] same faith that you got that got you out
[1:03:40] of your sickness got you out of the
[1:03:42] wheelchair got you out of the things
[1:03:43] that held you bound that same faith will
[1:03:46] keep you
[1:03:48] tonight that that the Church of the
[1:03:51] Living God is not believing in a dead
[1:03:53] God she's not worshiping a dead God but
[1:03:56] she is worshiping a God who is very much
[1:03:59] alive
[1:04:00] Can Be Touched by the feeling of our
[1:04:02] infirmities I want you to I want you to
[1:04:05] gather this tonight in your thought that
[1:04:07] while the very word of God Goes Forth
[1:04:09] that there is a one that is walking the
[1:04:12] aisles Where You Are
[1:04:15] notice and I've been reflecting upon
[1:04:17] these things I've been reflecting up
[1:04:20] over these needs of our local assembly
[1:04:23] and I believe that that if there's
[1:04:25] anything that we want to see we want to
[1:04:28] see the healing of our pastor
[1:04:31] I've been I've been reflecting over
[1:04:33] these things they've been very heavy on
[1:04:35] my heart and just thinking over the
[1:04:37] needs of our local assembly of our of
[1:04:39] our precious brother uh brother Donnie
[1:04:41] Nicholson and our sister Ruth Ann and
[1:04:44] and sister Betty and brother Randy and
[1:04:46] brother Bill and sister Linda little Zoe
[1:04:48] and all of these local needs and I just
[1:04:51] been so burdened to see to see the our
[1:04:55] lord Jesus come and rise with healing in
[1:04:57] his wings and sweep over us in a Rapture
[1:05:00] and completely make all of us whole at
[1:05:03] once I believe that it's something that
[1:05:05] the Church of the Living God should be
[1:05:07] expecting I don't believe it's something
[1:05:09] that we should lay off and into the
[1:05:12] future of thinking of things well why
[1:05:14] aren't we have any because we recognize
[1:05:16] there is a bomb here
[1:05:19] we recognize there is a power here we
[1:05:21] recognize there is an anointing here and
[1:05:24] I believe
[1:05:26] I believe that if we're going to do
[1:05:28] anything then we ought to believe in the
[1:05:30] god of the Bible I believe if we can
[1:05:32] spend our time on frivolous things of
[1:05:34] the world of looking at nature and
[1:05:37] looking at money and looking at the
[1:05:39] things of sports world and I think if we
[1:05:41] can look at things of the nature want to
[1:05:43] buy different things then we ought to be
[1:05:44] able to look
[1:05:45] into the true word of God
[1:05:49] I believe if the world can go out there
[1:05:51] and they can have their exhibitions then
[1:05:53] the Church of the Living God ought to be
[1:05:55] able to celebrate the victory of our
[1:05:57] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:00] why shouldn't we have this
[1:06:04] come on somebody I lie I'll give a
[1:06:06] million dollars to anybody that can
[1:06:08] stand up to me tonight and tell me why
[1:06:10] we can't have it
[1:06:12] if the word of God has sowed has told us
[1:06:15] so we can have it then we ought to be
[1:06:17] able to worship like we got it
[1:06:19] I don't believe there should be any
[1:06:21] shackle upon our faith I don't believe
[1:06:23] there should be any Shackle in our
[1:06:24] worship I don't believe there should be
[1:06:26] any shackle on our belief but I believe
[1:06:29] that with everything that's within me
[1:06:31] that the Church of the Living God ought
[1:06:33] to be able to believe like it's so that
[1:06:35] we ought to be able to worship like it's
[1:06:37] so that we ought to be able to praise
[1:06:39] like it's already over
[1:06:43] let me tell you God is with this church
[1:06:46] and he is not going to leave her
[1:06:49] shouldn't be in panic when you are in
[1:06:51] the midst of your crisis you shouldn't
[1:06:53] be in the midst of stress when you are
[1:06:55] in the midst of your crisis
[1:06:56] I was called to a certain case the other
[1:06:59] day and it immediately it raised a panic
[1:07:02] on the inside of me said get here right
[1:07:04] now and I took off and I was in a panic
[1:07:08] begin to flutter my heart and all of a
[1:07:10] sudden the spirit of the Lord dropped
[1:07:12] upon my heart and said settle down
[1:07:15] I'm already there
[1:07:17] before I could ever get to the place
[1:07:19] where the case was the angel was already
[1:07:22] there I shouldn't be nervous I shouldn't
[1:07:25] be shook up because the angel is already
[1:07:28] where I need to be at
[1:07:31] even when you don't see him he's working
[1:07:33] even when you don't feel him he's
[1:07:35] working I don't know what's going on up
[1:07:37] here but it seems like it's very distant
[1:07:38] but even when I don't see him even when
[1:07:42] I don't feel him he's already there just
[1:07:45] settle down about it breathe a little
[1:07:47] bit let it go rest in it I'm already
[1:07:51] there
[1:07:53] he's already in your trouble he's
[1:07:55] already in your midst of your crisis
[1:07:58] I'm there
[1:08:04] it depends on what you're looking at
[1:08:07] you see if you're only looking at the
[1:08:09] problem that's all you're going to see
[1:08:11] but if you're looking at the promise
[1:08:13] can't see any problem because of the
[1:08:16] promise well I've got bad news for
[1:08:18] cancer I've got bad news for sugar
[1:08:20] diabetes I got bad news for liver
[1:08:23] problems I got bad news for kidney
[1:08:26] problems the promise of God is so big
[1:08:29] that I can't even see the problem
[1:08:32] come on somebody the promises of God
[1:08:36] have so have enveloped the Bride of
[1:08:38] Jesus Christ that we shouldn't be Shook
[1:08:40] Up
[1:08:44] when Moses sent out the 12 Spies what
[1:08:47] was it 10 of them went over there and
[1:08:49] they brought up an evil report
[1:08:51] but there was two that helped that were
[1:08:53] thoroughbreds they knew where they had
[1:08:55] been born at and they were not looking
[1:08:58] at what they seen they were looking at
[1:09:01] what Abraham had told them
[1:09:03] because Abraham was fellowshipping with
[1:09:06] one that had the abilities to change his
[1:09:09] bodies and change the molecular pattern
[1:09:12] in his body and to make him an old man
[1:09:15] and turn him into a new man so Caleb and
[1:09:18] Joshua were birthed under the same
[1:09:20] commission and they were not looking at
[1:09:23] those giants over there even though
[1:09:25] they've seen him over there
[1:09:28] they've seen them over there they seen
[1:09:30] them wall cities over there they seen
[1:09:33] them big old Giants over there but they
[1:09:35] were not concerned about what they were
[1:09:37] seeing they were simply birthed under
[1:09:40] the word
[1:09:41] you see because it matters where you're
[1:09:43] born at the reason why these two men
[1:09:46] Joshua and Caleb could stand there and
[1:09:49] have that tenacity and say we are more
[1:09:52] than able to take it was because they
[1:09:54] had a birth under a thoroughbred it
[1:09:57] could search it all the way back that
[1:09:58] the faith that they had was not in vain
[1:10:01] the faith that they had received was not
[1:10:04] some man-made man man-made thought or
[1:10:06] man-made intellectualism but God had
[1:10:09] dropped something on the inside of
[1:10:11] Joshua and Caleb that even though the
[1:10:13] problem was in front of them
[1:10:16] they were raised for a purpose to take
[1:10:19] the children of God over and you have
[1:10:21] been put here to believe the very word
[1:10:24] of God even though you see problems even
[1:10:27] though you see troubles
[1:10:29] we are looking at a promise
[1:10:33] you're looking at a promise you see the
[1:10:35] word of God when the word of God has the
[1:10:37] preeminence in his body it doesn't
[1:10:40] matter what intellectual is saying it
[1:10:42] doesn't matter what reason says it
[1:10:44] doesn't matter what wisdom says because
[1:10:46] the word of God is having the
[1:10:49] preeminence in his body
[1:10:52] another man of sad in letting off the
[1:10:53] pressure he said are you believing now
[1:10:55] are you accepting now he said but he
[1:10:58] said he said do you believe that your
[1:11:00] faith has shook off or beat off every
[1:11:04] shackle of unbelief
[1:11:05] has it beat off every shackle of
[1:11:07] unbelief can you believe it that much
[1:11:10] that it's the very shackle of your
[1:11:12] understanding has been beat off that
[1:11:14] nothing hinders you there's not one
[1:11:17] thing in your way but do you believe
[1:11:19] that you're free you believe that
[1:11:21] although unbelief has gone from you you
[1:11:23] believe that you're now in Haven of Rest
[1:11:25] You Believe
[1:11:27] will I be healed can I be healed you're
[1:11:30] already healed
[1:11:33] what does the word of God do it loosens
[1:11:36] your mind to accept the promises as yes
[1:11:39] and amen the word of God will never put
[1:11:43] the promises of God in days gone by but
[1:11:46] what the word of God with aligned with
[1:11:48] faith for this hour it will raise the
[1:11:51] believer's expectation to say that he's
[1:11:54] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:11:57] if I tell you if there's one thing that
[1:11:59] the Church of the Living God ought to do
[1:12:01] they ought to lift him up out of history
[1:12:03] and say he's not just a god of our past
[1:12:05] he's not just the god of the days gone
[1:12:07] by he's the god of my future he's the
[1:12:10] god of my presence I think if there's
[1:12:12] any day that we ought to lift him up out
[1:12:15] of History
[1:12:16] we gotta lift him up if he healed
[1:12:18] Georgie Carter he can do it right now if
[1:12:21] he healed a little blind girl in Memphis
[1:12:23] he can do it right now
[1:12:25] [Applause]
[1:12:28] come on somebody what's the word do it
[1:12:31] breaks the band
[1:12:33] of the enemy that's put a band upon your
[1:12:35] life
[1:12:38] oh come on now
[1:12:41] you know good and well you can't worship
[1:12:43] with a shackle on your face something
[1:12:45] that's holding you back you can't
[1:12:47] worship the way God built you to worship
[1:12:49] sitting there in your unbelief saying
[1:12:51] well it ain't just going to happen for
[1:12:53] me it's for the people up front it ain't
[1:12:55] for me back there in the back if you
[1:12:57] believe that get up here where they're
[1:12:58] sitting at you ought to sit here tonight
[1:13:01] let every shackle
[1:13:04] let every shackle come off of your faith
[1:13:06] and why don't you let the promises of
[1:13:08] God as the chains are falling
[1:13:12] worship the God that I take you to
[1:13:14] another world
[1:13:18] I tell you what is good to be home
[1:13:26] God's gonna get my praise God's gonna
[1:13:30] give my praise devil get out of my way
[1:13:34] cause God's gonna give my praise
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:43] he knows what he's doing he's in control
[1:13:45] of his word you didn't move here just to
[1:13:48] move here just to say you went around
[1:13:50] Spencer's Church the angel brought you
[1:13:53] here and the angel brought you here will
[1:13:56] take you
[1:14:00] you let the critics say what they're
[1:14:01] going to say you let criticism say what
[1:14:04] it's going to say the angel is in
[1:14:06] control of the word and he knows where
[1:14:08] to deposit it so that it'll come out
[1:14:10] exactly what he asked for
[1:14:16] when you got that kind of Faith you're
[1:14:18] going to throw yourself liable for
[1:14:19] criticism but if you're like Mary the
[1:14:22] baby the mother of Jesus if you're like
[1:14:25] her you don't care what the critics say
[1:14:29] you throw yourself alive before
[1:14:30] criticism when you believe the Angel
[1:14:33] that's talking to you
[1:14:37] it's unseemable
[1:14:40] it's inconceivable but the angel said
[1:14:43] that I'm going to bring forth a child
[1:14:46] the angel said that there's going to be
[1:14:48] a perfect harmony that she would have
[1:14:50] the mind of Christ she would act in his
[1:14:52] name she would speak in his name the
[1:14:55] angel told her that you're going to call
[1:14:58] his name Jesus and when the angel told
[1:15:01] us to pick up the pen and write this is
[1:15:04] the only kind that the word can bring
[1:15:07] forth
[1:15:09] because she's in perfect harmony with
[1:15:12] the one that broke every shackle
[1:15:18] now come on you know I'm preaching you
[1:15:19] the message
[1:15:20] every shackle of every denomination has
[1:15:24] been struck off the Church of the Living
[1:15:26] God
[1:15:28] every little doubt every little fear of
[1:15:32] wondering will it be has been struck off
[1:15:35] the Church of the Living God and every
[1:15:38] devil in hell has been trying to keep
[1:15:40] you from this
[1:15:42] throughout all your life he said six
[1:15:45] thousand years to work upon your family
[1:15:47] and work on their DNA but you see you
[1:15:51] see God is as good as his word and the
[1:15:55] same thing that has been deposited in
[1:15:57] the gene seed of God is the very life of
[1:16:00] the father and if you've got his life
[1:16:05] there ain't no shackle
[1:16:08] gonna hold you back
[1:16:10] come on somebody God ain't looking at
[1:16:13] your failures God ain't looking at what
[1:16:15] you used to be if he was that kind of a
[1:16:18] god he'd have gave up on Samson when
[1:16:20] Samson was down there living in a
[1:16:22] harlot's house doing all kinds of sin
[1:16:24] but he wasn't looking at Sampson sin he
[1:16:27] was looking at that Nazarite Covenant
[1:16:30] you see what God is looking upon you
[1:16:32] sisters today he's looking upon that
[1:16:34] Covenant and you might feel like you
[1:16:37] failed you might feel like God's gave up
[1:16:39] on you but God ain't looking at you he
[1:16:42] ain't looking at your flesh he ain't
[1:16:44] looking at what you're going through he
[1:16:46] is looking at his blood-bound promises
[1:16:51] [Applause]
[1:16:54] get your eyes off the things of the
[1:16:56] world and get your eyes on Jesus
[1:16:59] come on now
[1:17:02] he's that kind of a God he knows how to
[1:17:04] go into the room
[1:17:05] because prayer was made
[1:17:08] you out of your prison cell of unbelief
[1:17:11] I believe his same Angels right here
[1:17:13] tonight
[1:17:14] the Bible said that there was prayer
[1:17:17] made up there in John Mark's house
[1:17:19] and they were up there praying for Peter
[1:17:21] that was locked up in the prison down
[1:17:22] there and the Bible said that the Angels
[1:17:25] slipped through the window and went in
[1:17:27] there and took the shackles off of Peter
[1:17:29] and said now it's time you get up what
[1:17:31] did the angel do he woke him up and told
[1:17:33] him to stand up and start walking that's
[1:17:36] what the angel was doing right now he's
[1:17:38] tapping you on your shoulder said Johnny
[1:17:41] Crow it's already been took off for you
[1:17:44] laughs go ahead walk on out but I want
[1:17:48] you to notice the prayer directed The
[1:17:50] Angel to Peter he didn't direct him to
[1:17:53] everybody else down there in the prison
[1:17:54] house the prayer directed The Angel to
[1:17:57] where Peter was and there has been
[1:18:00] prayer on top of prayer on top of prayer
[1:18:03] that is directing an angel Hallelujah
[1:18:05] he's directing the Angel by your way I
[1:18:08] said well come on now let's enjoy our
[1:18:11] freedom if he let me out then let me
[1:18:13] worship him like I'm loose
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:22] whatever Devil's trying to keep you from
[1:18:24] this
[1:18:24] random said an expectation he said when
[1:18:27] those little shackles and Dark Shadows
[1:18:30] get broke away then
[1:18:32] the Holy Spirit can come right in
[1:18:35] four miracles
[1:18:47] when those little shackles
[1:18:54] them little shackles and them Dark
[1:18:57] Shadows
[1:18:59] when they get broke away then the Holy
[1:19:02] Spirit can come right in and perform
[1:19:05] Miracles he said there's nothing
[1:19:07] impossible with it then
[1:19:12] how many here

[1:19:23] here that are asking for complete
[1:19:25] healing I know that there's a few needs
[1:19:27] that are here tonight that are asking
[1:19:29] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost

[1:19:35] telling you something that you don't
[1:19:36] know you're very aware of it but if the
[1:19:38] shackles and the Dark Shadows can roll
[1:19:40] away then the Lord

[1:19:47] atmosphere he's got control of the
[1:19:49] universe when them things get pulled

[1:22:12] only one place you are God's provided
[1:22:15] place of worship he said well that's a
[1:22:17] little bit out there William random said
[1:22:19] that she is him the father dwelleth in
[1:22:23] secret and in truth it's in this body
[1:22:27] there ain't nobody that can worship like
[1:22:29] God father there's nobody that can speak
[1:22:31] to me like my father and if he speaks
[1:22:39] every devil
[1:22:41] every devil
[1:22:43] let me tell you he's walking on the
[1:22:45] water
[1:22:48] in the eye of your storm he is walking
[1:22:53] on the water
[1:22:54] now you remember what brother Brandon
[1:22:56] was there and he preaches Christ The
[1:22:58] Mystery of God revealed and he comes all
[1:23:00] the way down there in paragraph 6 37
[1:23:02] he's standing there and brother Baron
[1:23:04] starts singing Take the name of Jesus
[1:23:07] Christ with you always he's singing that
[1:23:09] song Precious name oh how sweet and he
[1:23:13] said now you that are spiritual you that
[1:23:16] are spiritual he said look back there at
[1:23:18] that clock he said it's at two o'clock
[1:23:20] on the dot he said look back there he
[1:23:23] said what is it he said it's the ending
[1:23:26] it's the ending of the second poll he
[1:23:29] said it's showing that the third poll is
[1:23:32] at hand and brother random goes back to
[1:23:35] singing he goes back to singing Take the
[1:23:38] name of Jesus Christ with you he said
[1:23:40] but oh he said and then he stops he said
[1:23:43] did you notice how the spirit got in
[1:23:46] that same song and took it a higher
[1:23:48] octave what did it the spirit didn't
[1:23:51] change the word he just shake took it up
[1:23:54] a little bit higher right he didn't
[1:23:56] change a word when the between the
[1:23:58] transition of the second pool to the
[1:24:00] third pole he only took our faith a
[1:24:03] little bit higher
[1:24:05] oh man I I don't know if I got enough
[1:24:08] glue in my body to hold me together
[1:24:09] tonight but God has built us to go a
[1:24:13] little bit higher to go a little bit
[1:24:15] further the next point is a hand what
[1:24:17] was it it was the token life of Jesus
[1:24:20] Christ Living on the inside of the body
[1:24:22] taking this word manifested for this
[1:24:25] hour a little bit higher
[1:24:28] John Wesley couldn't go where you're
[1:24:30] going Luther couldn't go where you're
[1:24:32] going
[1:24:33] it costs couldn't go where you're going
[1:24:35] you are under an ego anointing
[1:24:44] they call that lambano which holds the
[1:24:47] milk the body together
[1:24:50] the glue that holds the body together
[1:24:52] is called lembano
[1:24:55] it's a sale that looks exactly like a
[1:24:57] cross
[1:24:58] that holds your body together it's
[1:25:01] called the glue of the body I'm glad the
[1:25:03] cross is holding me together tonight
[1:25:07] you say because because we are not under
[1:25:10] of days gone by Ministry
[1:25:13] I'm afraid that too many people around
[1:25:15] the ranks of the message have sat there
[1:25:17] and said oh if William Branham was here
[1:25:20] then I could go to him and ask him I
[1:25:24] never was I never was sitting there
[1:25:27] and here heard brother Branham speak my
[1:25:30] name
[1:25:33] I didn't hear my name on tape there's
[1:25:36] some Spencers on there but he didn't
[1:25:37] call my name I wasn't sitting there even
[1:25:39] in the very first stage it was so close
[1:25:42] that it would deceive the very elect
[1:25:44] theologians even William Branham
[1:25:46] preached it in 1954 throughout his
[1:25:49] ministry until the angel met him a
[1:25:52] player and broke a sound barrier and
[1:25:55] took him to look into the open Word and
[1:25:59] see that that was not our Lord on that
[1:26:02] white horse
[1:26:03] he said
[1:26:04] he said that it was the Antichrist
[1:26:06] Spirit he said it was so close he said
[1:26:09] but if you'll notice that Antichrist
[1:26:11] rider was riding he had a bowl but he
[1:26:14] didn't have no arrows so everything that
[1:26:16] he is just doing he's flapping that old
[1:26:18] bow and it sounds like banjo music to
[1:26:21] you but you recognize he ain't got no
[1:26:24] power
[1:26:25] simply nothing but a bluff but what
[1:26:28] happened the trail of the serpent was
[1:26:30] working through that age the Antichrist
[1:26:32] was working through that age trying to
[1:26:35] stop all the belief of believing in the
[1:26:38] power that was released but that's why
[1:26:40] when the very power of Satan Begin to
[1:26:44] Fall that God raised up a standard
[1:26:47] what was it what was it every single
[1:26:50] time you watched that Antichrist ride
[1:26:52] out God sends out his power to combat
[1:26:55] the spirit of hell that was released
[1:26:58] notice what was it in the very first age
[1:27:00] he released the lion anointing what was
[1:27:03] it it was the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:27:06] in the form of the Lion of the word of
[1:27:09] God that's why they had miracles in that
[1:27:12] day that's why they had that's why they
[1:27:14] had healings and miracles and visions
[1:27:16] and power is because it was a lion the
[1:27:19] very word of God made manifest he said
[1:27:23] you see the Antichrist sent out his
[1:27:25] power but God sent out his word
[1:27:28] so what was it it was the word that
[1:27:31] conquered the enemy in that day but now
[1:27:33] notice hold that word has been laying
[1:27:37] here for two thousand years waiting for
[1:27:40] your arrival
[1:27:42] he was looking over the seeds that he
[1:27:45] had deposited and the Lord knows exactly
[1:27:48] where they are laying at but I want you
[1:27:50] to know that even though you can look
[1:27:52] back there you can look in Paul's day
[1:27:55] you could see the lion anointing as he
[1:27:57] would go out and it would thwart the
[1:27:59] very power of hell but God did not leave
[1:28:02] us here in this earth or in this age
[1:28:05] like a little wimpy little child he did
[1:28:08] not leave us down here like a little
[1:28:10] bitty kitten but he has left us here
[1:28:12] under the ego anointing to restore our
[1:28:16] faith back to the faith of the
[1:28:18] Pentecostal fathers that's exactly what
[1:28:21] the ministry of Malachi 4 was to do was
[1:28:24] to return or restore our hearts back to
[1:28:28] the faith that was deposited in the
[1:28:30] first generation and Paul would say Paul
[1:28:33] would say over in the New Testament that
[1:28:36] when that is turned towards the Lord the
[1:28:39] veil would be taken off and after Paul
[1:28:42] says that he said now the Lord is that
[1:28:46] spirit and where the spirit of the Lord
[1:28:48] is there is Liberty there is no liberty
[1:28:52] in a Creed there is no liberty in the
[1:28:55] denomination because you see ever since
[1:28:58] the seals were released we recognize
[1:29:00] that the Church of the Living God had
[1:29:03] been bound by those demons for two
[1:29:05] thousand years but when the seals were
[1:29:08] released two hundred thousand thousand
[1:29:10] demons were released but you and I are
[1:29:13] not really rejoicing and worshiping in a
[1:29:16] hidden truth but we are rejoicing from a
[1:29:20] heart that has been restored and we are
[1:29:22] rejoicing in the unveiling of the word
[1:29:25] of God what did this Eagle anointing do
[1:29:28] it flew over every one of those Creeds
[1:29:31] that had completely destroyed the very
[1:29:34] power of the word
[1:29:37] what did it do it flew over top of those
[1:29:40] Creeds and it tied all of those loose
[1:29:43] ends up
[1:29:44] you see healing was taken from the
[1:29:46] Church of the Living God but the
[1:29:48] anointing of Christ tied it back
[1:29:50] together so that you could believe that
[1:29:53] the days of Miracles are not gone but
[1:29:56] they're here
[1:29:57] where the spirit of the enemy come in
[1:29:59] and he separated the power of looking
[1:30:02] into the word of God and seeing that it
[1:30:05] wasn't sex back there in the garden he
[1:30:07] was serpent seed or not looking in their
[1:30:09] Scene It was fruit but you've seen it
[1:30:11] was sex what was it it was the anointing
[1:30:14] of that day that that naviste that tied
[1:30:17] it back together so that you can clearly
[1:30:19] see why we needed a virgin-born son of
[1:30:23] God
[1:30:25] all of those things that had been torn
[1:30:27] off of eternal security of looking in
[1:30:30] there and seeing water baptism William
[1:30:32] random said water baptism don't even
[1:30:34] need a revelation but because men had
[1:30:36] misconstrued the very word of God they
[1:30:39] took in there and put in the names of
[1:30:42] titles and took away the power of
[1:30:44] baptism if you are going to be baptized
[1:30:47] you want to be buried you don't want to
[1:30:50] be sprinkled and you don't want to be
[1:30:52] covered by just three pieces of dirt you
[1:30:54] want to be covered by a name that's got
[1:30:56] a resurrection power in it
[1:30:59] but what was it the anointing of this
[1:31:02] day come flying over top of those words
[1:31:04] that had been bound up that had been
[1:31:07] tied and so they kept away from the
[1:31:09] Church of the Living God the anointing
[1:31:11] of Malachi 4 returned our faith
[1:31:16] things where we couldn't get to the
[1:31:18] power things where we couldn't get to
[1:31:20] the truth they had been blocked off but
[1:31:23] the blood of Jesus Christ took us over
[1:31:26] not into the world of Creeds and dogmas
[1:31:29] where things are still bound up there
[1:31:31] and you can't see it true but now you
[1:31:34] are here under the opening of the word
[1:31:37] what is it this is the liberation of the
[1:31:41] power of almighty God that has returned
[1:31:44] our hearts back to true worship
[1:31:48] and worship
[1:31:50] is only due to him
[1:31:54] to him I hope I dropped too too much
[1:31:56] heavy stuff on you but I believe that
[1:31:57] you're the church that can receive these
[1:31:59] things
[1:32:02] you follow me okay tonight
[1:32:05] you're that people
[1:32:07] you're that group
[1:32:09] that William Branham saw over there
[1:32:12] where the bride had come into preview
[1:32:15] and then the church walked out and he
[1:32:18] said oh God have I worked all my life to
[1:32:21] present to you a church like that but a
[1:32:23] voice Came From Another World and said
[1:32:26] but the bride will come in to preview
[1:32:28] again what was it the same one that was
[1:32:31] there in the beginning is the same word
[1:32:33] that is here in the evening time what is
[1:32:36] it it's a time to arise and shine that
[1:32:39] even though we're in an hour of Darkness
[1:32:41] but notice Isaiah's proclamation in
[1:32:43] Isaiah chapter 60 arise and shine even
[1:32:46] in chaotic times the word
[1:32:50] has brought you back under your freedoms
[1:32:53] they were Satan tried to rob you from
[1:32:55] the power and Rob you from your victory
[1:32:58] can I get down to the bare Knuckles he
[1:33:00] tried to Rob your family out of your
[1:33:02] life he tried to rob the very strength
[1:33:04] and the Very joy out of your family and
[1:33:07] try to take everything from you but this
[1:33:10] word is about restoring if your joy has
[1:33:14] been taken from you God's going to
[1:33:16] restore it if your health has been taken
[1:33:18] from you God is going to restore it if
[1:33:21] the devil has robbed from you God is the
[1:33:23] kind of Banker that he puts more in your
[1:33:26] bank account than when Satan robs from
[1:33:28] you
[1:33:31] if there's anybody
[1:33:32] if there's anybody that ought to be able
[1:33:34] to worship Him
[1:33:37] it's you
[1:33:45] let me tell you what real worship is
[1:33:47] real worship don't care how hot it is in
[1:33:50] church and how cold it is in church
[1:33:52] real worship don't care what kind of
[1:33:54] chair you're sitting on real worship
[1:33:56] don't care what you see about the people
[1:33:59] that are sitting around you real worship
[1:34:01] don't care about the necessities of life
[1:34:03] real worship don't care if you're
[1:34:05] sitting on a pine bench it don't care if
[1:34:07] you're sitting there and you're seeking
[1:34:09] your body real worship doesn't matter
[1:34:11] about what you see or by what you feel
[1:34:13] real worship comes from the heart and
[1:34:16] it's their new to the father himself
[1:34:21] I tell you what real worship does real
[1:34:23] worship will make you look past yourself
[1:34:26] and look to the Future to what God has
[1:34:29] said about you
[1:34:31] real worship don't care where you're
[1:34:33] sitting at in your physical life or in
[1:34:35] your spiritual life real worship will
[1:34:37] take you past that
[1:34:44] you're special people
[1:34:46] you know how to yield you know how to
[1:34:48] give over to the Holy Ghost
[1:34:50] it's amazing thing
[1:34:52] you know good and well that when you get
[1:34:54] comfortable
[1:34:55] you know what I'm talking about brother
[1:34:56] Jeffrey when you get comfortable and
[1:34:58] there's certain people that you're more
[1:34:59] comfortable with than than maybe certain
[1:35:01] others and you get good and comfortable
[1:35:05] and you don't care what everybody else
[1:35:06] is thinking about you they don't real
[1:35:09] worship doesn't care doesn't care who's
[1:35:12] sitting around and who's looking at you
[1:35:14] because when you get good and
[1:35:16] comfortable you really don't care how
[1:35:18] you act
[1:35:21] there are friends and then there are
[1:35:24] friends
[1:35:27] you know what I'm talking about ain't
[1:35:29] everybody the kind of people that you
[1:35:30] just let your hair down and act any way
[1:35:33] you want to
[1:35:34] are you with me now
[1:35:36] but when you get comfortable in your
[1:35:38] skin as a son and daughter of God you
[1:35:41] can worship him like the way he wants
[1:35:43] you to now I want you to think about it
[1:35:45] like this but when God gets comfortable
[1:35:47] in your skin
[1:35:49] when God gets good and comfortable where
[1:35:51] you're living at and he knows that
[1:35:54] you're right and he knows you got faith
[1:35:55] and he knows you got the blood on your
[1:35:57] altar and he knows you got real worship
[1:35:59] and he knows you got real faith in it
[1:36:01] knows you don't care what everybody else
[1:36:03] says but when God gets so comfortable I
[1:36:06] can put my anointing on them they don't
[1:36:08] care if they slobber they don't care if
[1:36:09] they scream they don't care if they
[1:36:11] dance they don't care if they shout real
[1:36:13] worship comes from the heart of a
[1:36:15] worshiper that worships God it's spirit
[1:36:18] and in truth whether they got music
[1:36:20] whether there's hand clappings whether
[1:36:22] there's an atmosphere they are going to
[1:36:25] create an atmosphere you are worshipers
[1:36:28] [Music]
[1:36:31] and I believe that if you know you got
[1:36:33] the victory you can worship him all day
[1:36:36] long all night long worshiping him in
[1:36:39] Good Times worship Him in bad times
[1:36:41] [Applause]
[1:36:45] what did Moses tell them and prophesy of
[1:36:47] them in Exodus chapter 14 that the
[1:36:50] enemies that you see today you're going
[1:36:52] to see them no longer and when they got
[1:36:54] over there in Exodus chapter 15 The
[1:36:56] Bible said that Moses sang a song it was
[1:36:59] not a song of defeat it was not a song
[1:37:01] of them that had been conquered but it
[1:37:04] was the song of victory
[1:37:07] Exodus 15 says then sang Moses and the
[1:37:11] children of Israel this song unto the
[1:37:13] Lord and speak saying I I will sing unto
[1:37:17] the Lord for he have triumphed
[1:37:19] gloriously the horse and his rider have
[1:37:22] to be thrown into the sea the Lord is my
[1:37:24] strength and my song he has become my
[1:37:27] salvation he is my God I will prepare
[1:37:30] him a habitation my father's God and I
[1:37:34] will exalt him the Lord is a man of war
[1:37:36] the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots
[1:37:40] and his hosts have be cast into the sea
[1:37:42] his chosen captains also are drowned
[1:37:45] into the Red Sea The Depths I've covered
[1:37:47] them they sank into the bottom as a
[1:37:50] stone thy right hand O Lord
[1:37:52] is become glorious in power thy right
[1:37:56] hand O Lord hath dashed the pieces of
[1:37:58] the enemy in the greatness of thine
[1:38:01] Excellency thou has overthrown them that
[1:38:04] rose up against thee thou sendeth forth
[1:38:06] I wrath which consume them as stubborn
[1:38:11] what was Moses looking at he was singing
[1:38:14] this song
[1:38:15] because the experience he just had
[1:38:20] come on it's a dry it's one of those
[1:38:22] moments where you can drop the mic right
[1:38:23] here and walk off
[1:38:27] in this song because of a victory that
[1:38:30] he just had he was not singing unto them
[1:38:32] we're still bound we're still facing
[1:38:35] Pharaoh's armies he was saying God
[1:38:39] has thrown our Devils has thrown our
[1:38:42] enemies into the Red Sea
[1:38:45] you think I'm crazy you take 600 000
[1:38:48] women grabbing themselves a tambourine
[1:38:51] having themselves a victory party
[1:38:54] [Applause]
[1:38:55] what was it they were looking
[1:38:58] at the victory
[1:39:00] you know that the Bible tells us in
[1:39:02] Revelation chapter 15 that they sang
[1:39:04] that song of Moses
[1:39:08] that they looked over there and they had
[1:39:10] gotten a victory over the image of the
[1:39:12] Beast and the image of it and all of its
[1:39:15] powers and they sang the song of Moses
[1:39:18] and of the Lamb
[1:39:22] come on now
[1:39:23] you see what they were doing they were
[1:39:26] singing and if you hear some singing it
[1:39:29] means there's something going on
[1:39:32] you remember when Paul Rader was nine
[1:39:35] and they came in there and sang them
[1:39:37] slow songs he said hey who's dying in
[1:39:40] here me or you
[1:39:42] he said sing me some of them old gospels
[1:39:44] snap his songs let me tell you a
[1:39:47] Christian can't die
[1:39:51] because every Satan every Kingdom of
[1:39:54] Satan has been torn down
[1:39:56] death has been torn down hell has been
[1:39:58] torn down the Grave's been torn down he
[1:40:01] don't even have the keys to his own
[1:40:03] house
[1:40:04] so how can he try to trick you into
[1:40:06] believe that you're still bound when the
[1:40:08] father's already got the keys in his
[1:40:10] hands and said get out of it
[1:40:17] when you hear singing when we come back
[1:40:20] from the wars in v-day brother Bynum
[1:40:22] tells us he tells us he said when we
[1:40:24] come back from Wars he said you were
[1:40:26] hearing cheers of Victory they were
[1:40:29] singing songs of victory in the street
[1:40:31] when David had slain the Goliath over
[1:40:34] there the giant that had been swearing
[1:40:36] that he was going to destroy the armies
[1:40:38] of the Living God they came back and
[1:40:41] there was singing in the streets that
[1:40:43] Saul hath killed his thousands but David
[1:40:45] his tens of thousands what was it it was
[1:40:49] a sign of Victory and David had so much
[1:40:53] victory that he led the rest of the
[1:40:55] Church of the Living God right on over
[1:40:57] there into complete Victory our Lord
[1:41:00] Jesus Christ when you look up there on
[1:41:03] Easter morning 2 000 years ago we don't
[1:41:06] see him as defeated
[1:41:08] we don't see him you might look at him
[1:41:10] on the cross on Friday but you give him
[1:41:13] till Sunday and he'll show you who's a
[1:41:15] real Victor
[1:41:17] devil I want you to have yourself a good
[1:41:19] dancing party while you can because when
[1:41:22] my Lord gets up on Sunday

[1:41:27] been stole away from you

[1:41:33] back give me my worship back give me my
[1:41:36] health back it's Sunday it's son day

[1:41:52] tell down every critic let's tear down
[1:41:54] every devil that says we can't have it

[1:42:01] sister Francis he told me I can have it

[1:42:37] [Applause]
[1:42:40] devil get out our way
[1:42:44] we're free
[1:42:46] sin has been conquered
[1:42:48] every devil is defeated
[1:42:56] I know what I'm talking about
[1:42:59] because I'm not looking at a sealed tomb
[1:43:01] I'm looking at an empty tomb
[1:43:05] the rest of the world their gods are
[1:43:07] still laying there in their bag of bones
[1:43:09] but our Lord Jesus Christ gave us a sign
[1:43:13] Eternal sign that everything that was
[1:43:16] struck against the Church of the Living
[1:43:17] God when he took those stripes and he
[1:43:20] opened up the grave everything has been
[1:43:22] taken off
[1:43:25] and when the disciples came up there
[1:43:27] and they would come up there on Easter
[1:43:30] morning in Luke chapter 24 and they come
[1:43:32] up there to bring spices to anoint his
[1:43:34] body
[1:43:36] because they knew that something was
[1:43:38] about to set in
[1:43:41] you know what I'm talking about
[1:43:42] corruption was about to set in and they
[1:43:45] knew that if he stayed in that condition
[1:43:47] that it was going to start smelling but
[1:43:49] Jesus was so much God he couldn't even
[1:43:52] have stink on him
[1:43:56] foreign
[1:43:57] come on now he was so much God that
[1:44:01] corruption had met its Master when it
[1:44:04] met our Lord Jesus Christ death was
[1:44:07] starting it looked like death was going
[1:44:09] to start working in his members and
[1:44:11] start working in his body but God said
[1:44:12] oh no there's a prophecy laying over
[1:44:15] there in Psalms chapter 16 that not even
[1:44:19] corruption thou shall destroy this body
[1:44:25] and when those disciples went up
[1:44:29] when I put packing their packing their
[1:44:31] spices up there they looked and the
[1:44:34] stone was rolled away
[1:44:36] Stoners rolled away and there was
[1:44:38] standing Two Men and bright bright
[1:44:40] garments
[1:44:41] and they said why seek ye the living
[1:44:43] amongst the dead he ain't here
[1:44:47] let me tell you if you're looking for a
[1:44:49] live thing you better not go to a
[1:44:51] graveyard
[1:44:52] but he is telling you he ain't here the
[1:44:55] one that is the very author of Life the
[1:44:58] one that only knows how to give life the
[1:45:00] one that knows how to give life give
[1:45:02] hope give joy Give Peace give
[1:45:04] Deliverance he ain't into this whole
[1:45:06] dead place
[1:45:07] he's not in this tune he can't even
[1:45:10] smell like that he is not a part
[1:45:13] he's not a part of this dead religions
[1:45:16] of the world today that want to keep him
[1:45:18] back there bound up in the Yokes but I
[1:45:21] believe that there's some heartfelt
[1:45:23] religion around here
[1:45:25] they're in him dead creatures he ain't
[1:45:28] there
[1:45:30] he ain't there in your dead worship
[1:45:35] I'll tell you what William Branham said
[1:45:37] anything dead needs burying how can you
[1:45:40] bury Jesus when he is the very author of
[1:45:43] life
[1:45:45] what did the angel say he was here but
[1:45:49] he ain't here no more
[1:45:50] he was in the lutherans too thou he
[1:45:53] wasn't a Lutheran three ages ago he was
[1:45:56] in the West Winds two ages ago but he
[1:45:58] ain't there now
[1:45:59] he's risen
[1:46:01] why are you seeking the author of Life
[1:46:04] out there in the rest of the world why
[1:46:06] are you seeking him out in drugs why are
[1:46:09] you seeking him in pornography why are
[1:46:11] you seeking him down there in a prison
[1:46:12] house he ain't there he's alive
[1:46:19] come on now he's alive
[1:46:22] I'll tell you how much alive it was that
[1:46:25] when Jesus got done with where he was
[1:46:27] laying at he folded up his Linens and
[1:46:29] put him back there
[1:46:31] because he was not associated with that
[1:46:34] spot no more he wasn't there
[1:46:37] I don't know if y'all hear me talking to
[1:46:39] you tonight but I believe I'm talking to
[1:46:40] you tonight he ain't there you can throw
[1:46:42] them old Creeds you can throw them old
[1:46:44] dogs in the back hair cause he ain't in
[1:46:46] them things he ain't in them tombs this
[1:46:50] is not a dead religion this is not a
[1:46:53] dead God this is a God
[1:46:56] who is alive
[1:47:00] he's so much alive when they brought
[1:47:03] Lazarus forth from the grave he said
[1:47:04] Jesus said take the grave close off of
[1:47:07] him but when you see Jesus again there
[1:47:09] wasn't no such thing as the grave
[1:47:10] clothes on him he was so much God he was
[1:47:13] so much God that he could speak Lazarus
[1:47:16] come forth he was so much God that when
[1:47:19] they got over there in Luke chapter 24
[1:47:21] and he began to open to them their
[1:47:23] understanding all the way down the road
[1:47:25] of Emmaus and they said did not our
[1:47:27] hearts burn within us has he talked to
[1:47:29] us along the way and he gets over there
[1:47:31] in John Luke chapter 24 and verse 44 and
[1:47:34] it begins to speak to them that's what I
[1:47:37] love about this he's talked to them and
[1:47:39] he's seven miles in a different spot but
[1:47:41] they ran all the way back to Jerusalem
[1:47:43] where the other disciples were and said
[1:47:45] hey we've seen him he's alive
[1:47:49] you mean to tell me that you're telling
[1:47:52] the same stories that all them other
[1:47:53] stories of them sisters said that he's
[1:47:56] alive let me tell you he's alive how you
[1:47:59] know he's alive I've seen him in real
[1:48:01] worship I've seen him in this Brethren
[1:48:03] I've seen him in this sister he showed
[1:48:06] himself a life he still knows how to
[1:48:08] take take grave clothes off
[1:48:14] come on if he could get ray McBride to
[1:48:17] get baptized and watch all him sins off
[1:48:19] of him
[1:48:21] I'll say it's good enough to get anybody
[1:48:23] in the building tonight
[1:48:28] [Applause]
[1:48:32] I ain't as bad as that yes you were you
[1:48:35] was thinking you was rotten and you was
[1:48:37] good for nothing
[1:48:39] but then Jesus came
[1:48:43] but the Bible said that when he got over
[1:48:45] there
[1:48:47] he was so much God he walked right
[1:48:49] through the building
[1:48:52] have you any meat here I'll tell you
[1:48:54] what they was eating they was eating
[1:48:56] Katie's kind of food they was eating
[1:48:57] broadfish and honeycomb
[1:49:01] Hallelujah even Jesus knows what's good
[1:49:04] for you
[1:49:06] bring to them their understanding
[1:49:10] [Laughter]
[1:49:13] he was doing everything and the Bible
[1:49:16] said and they remembered his words when
[1:49:19] he opened your understanding you know
[1:49:21] he's the one that's been talking to you
[1:49:24] Hallelujah he's so much God he's in your
[1:49:27] conversations he's so much God is in
[1:49:29] your mind he's so much God he's in your
[1:49:31] heart when you were there crying in the
[1:49:33] middle of the night he was there
[1:49:36] watching those tears fall on your pillow
[1:49:44] can I Outlast the night
[1:49:50] can I Outlast my struggles
[1:49:54] but they remembered
[1:49:57] his words
[1:50:01] what was it
[1:50:03] he took the shackles
[1:50:05] off of their understanding
[1:50:11] it was a rumor
[1:50:13] and he was God
[1:50:18] on the second day
[1:50:20] it was just a rumor
[1:50:22] but on the third day it was more than a
[1:50:24] rumor
[1:50:29] he said what are you doing brother
[1:50:30] Hendra I'm preaching to you my Easter
[1:50:32] message
[1:50:36] he's opened your understanding the
[1:50:38] message didn't add to and take away it
[1:50:42] opened our understanding
[1:50:45] this is where he wants to be worshiped
[1:50:46] at this is where he wants to be praised
[1:50:49] at this is where he's inviting you to
[1:50:51] he's not taking you to days gone by but
[1:50:55] he's taking you to a future home he's
[1:50:58] taking you to your he's taking you to
[1:51:00] your home it's in the sky
[1:51:02] this is where I'm at
[1:51:04] this is where I want to be worshiped at
[1:51:06] this is where life is at oh you
[1:51:08] shouldn't be acting like that brother
[1:51:10] Andrew You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet
[1:51:15] you think I'm enthused now and you think
[1:51:17] I'm excited now
[1:51:19] you wait
[1:51:22] it's what I music ain't got nothing to
[1:51:24] do with this absolutely it does
[1:51:29] foreign
[1:51:32] music is a part of worship
[1:51:36] he said praise him on a high selling
[1:51:38] symbol praise him on hello seven and
[1:51:40] symbol
[1:51:42] praise them on a string instrument
[1:51:44] Praise Him in No Hands Praise Him in the
[1:51:47] woods
[1:51:54] worship
[1:51:55] is what we do
[1:52:00] he gave you everything in life
[1:52:03] he gave you your health
[1:52:05] he gave you your strength he gave you
[1:52:07] your spouse
[1:52:11] there's a big thing if you say Amen to
[1:52:13] that
[1:52:14] he gave you everything in life
[1:52:17] but worship
[1:52:18] is the only thing that you have rights
[1:52:22] to give back to him
[1:52:28] you are an amateur God
[1:52:31] and when you begin to Echo out praise
[1:52:35] and you begin to Heckle out worship
[1:52:38] it takes you away brother Zach
[1:52:41] foreign
[1:52:47] worship makes you look past your own sin
[1:52:53] worship makes you look past your whole
[1:52:55] failures
[1:52:59] worship makes you look past your
[1:53:01] attitude
[1:53:04] has bitterness
[1:53:06] past Rebellion past hurts
[1:53:09] that's what worship does
[1:53:15] the prophet got so mad
[1:53:18] Elisha got so mad
[1:53:23] when they came up an army up there that
[1:53:25] was seeking
[1:53:26] seeking water they've been without water
[1:53:32] he was mad
[1:53:34] here comes up these these unknown Kings
[1:53:37] up there that had turned their back on
[1:53:39] God
[1:53:42] let me tell you
[1:53:44] Elisha was miffed
[1:53:47] he was upset
[1:53:54] when he has a moment in your life when
[1:53:57] you feel real human
[1:54:01] and you say some things
[1:54:06] and you regret them immediately
[1:54:13] but worship takes you past what you
[1:54:15] think
[1:54:17] the spirit of the Living God didn't even
[1:54:19] come upon Elijah
[1:54:21] until he asked for a menstrual
[1:54:25] and when the music began to play then
[1:54:27] the prophet saw a vision
[1:54:30] and you think that we shouldn't have
[1:54:32] worship and we shouldn't have music what
[1:54:34] is it it's taking us into a spot where
[1:54:38] the Prophet can have a vision and the
[1:54:40] word can speak and can lead us right
[1:54:43] into an atmosphere where we can have our
[1:54:47] water again
[1:54:52] he said well you don't you don't you
[1:54:54] don't belong down there you don't you
[1:54:56] don't belong and I'll tell you what this
[1:54:57] worship does worship will shake down
[1:55:00] every formal shackle
[1:55:02] and brother Branham said I'll tell you
[1:55:04] brother when we get all the informal
[1:55:06] shackle shook down and the spirit of God
[1:55:08] in the songs again and get back to a
[1:55:10] place where we can have the spirit of
[1:55:12] God moving into place then the prophet
[1:55:15] can see a vision then the powers of God
[1:55:17] can come in the church
[1:55:19] and he can show you this is where he's
[1:55:20] at this is where he wants to be
[1:55:22] worshiped at
[1:55:29] he didn't have anything to it
[1:55:32] to it he didn't take anything from
[1:55:40] him you just got to step into your
[1:55:41] Liberty
[1:55:50] God wants worshipers
[1:55:56] worshipers
[1:55:58] that worship him through the pain
[1:56:07] worship him through the fears
[1:56:11] worship him through all of the
[1:56:13] anxiousness of life in the complexes of
[1:56:15] life
[1:56:20] if they come out of my place let me tell
[1:56:22] you I'm not
[1:56:25] because I believe that if we're going to
[1:56:26] do anything we ought to do it by the
[1:56:29] word
[1:56:33] praise is what leads you into battle
[1:56:37] Judah means Praise And even though Leah
[1:56:41] looked like she was mocked all of her
[1:56:44] life
[1:56:45] she had three other Sons
[1:56:47] and Jacob didn't even look at her
[1:56:51] but Leah began to turn when she had her
[1:56:54] fourth son and said now will I praise
[1:56:58] the Lord and she called his name Judah
[1:57:01] and every single time that the children
[1:57:04] of Israel went into the battle they went
[1:57:07] in with worship going before them Judah
[1:57:11] was the banner that led the children of
[1:57:13] Israel into battle so God was showing us
[1:57:17] that if we're going to do war with Satan
[1:57:19] down here and Satan's Eden there has got
[1:57:22] to be some worship that leads you into
[1:57:25] battle
[1:57:26] you see what it was he looked like he
[1:57:29] was fourth but he was the very first you
[1:57:32] see even job when he was in his moment
[1:57:34] of Despair in Job chapter 1 and 20 that
[1:57:38] he ripped his robe and he worshiped the
[1:57:40] Lord what was David he was a true
[1:57:44] worshiper
[1:57:46] David's life
[1:57:47] was spent in caves
[1:57:52] David's life was spent on the backside
[1:57:55] of the desert
[1:57:56] back there
[1:57:59] dispel a sheep on him
[1:58:02] where he learned the heart of the
[1:58:04] worshiper
[1:58:08] what are you doing brother Andrew I'm
[1:58:10] telling you how to win this war if
[1:58:13] you're going to win and I believe you
[1:58:15] are then you're going to have to worship
[1:58:17] Judah you're going to have to lead into
[1:58:20] worship you're going to have to praise
[1:58:22] when it don't look like the walls are
[1:58:24] coming down you're going to have to
[1:58:26] praise
[1:58:27] it might seem like a paradox
[1:58:31] walking around this whole this Army of
[1:58:34] Jericho and these walls for 60 days
[1:58:38] but finally Joshua said we've been
[1:58:40] silent long enough
[1:58:41] why did the shout come what's because
[1:58:44] the word asked for it to come
[1:58:46] why did our praise come because the word
[1:58:49] asked for it to come
[1:58:51] you remember when jehoshaphat's up there
[1:58:53] when that when they when there was a
[1:58:55] multitude of ammonites that came up
[1:58:57] there in the mountain of Sierra and and
[1:58:59] the other and the moabites that came up
[1:59:01] there that the Bible said that that
[1:59:03] Jehoshaphat immediately went and seen
[1:59:06] the multitude he ran into the house of
[1:59:08] the Lord and he began to seek the Lord
[1:59:10] and Proclaim to fast throughout all the
[1:59:12] land
[1:59:13] you go read it in second Chronicles
[1:59:14] chapter 20 that he goes in there and he
[1:59:17] proclaims the fast through all of Israel
[1:59:19] and the spirit of the Lord comes down
[1:59:21] and says don't you fear and don't you be
[1:59:23] dismayed for the battle is not yours but
[1:59:26] it's God's
[1:59:30] I'm gonna tell you it's crazy
[1:59:33] this is crazy but this is how they won
[1:59:36] the war
[1:59:40] this ain't your battle brother Doug it's
[1:59:42] God's
[1:59:45] come on brother Charles this ain't your
[1:59:47] battle it's God's
[1:59:48] don't you worry don't you worry this is
[1:59:51] God's battle and when God goes to move
[1:59:53] in every devil better get out of the way
[1:59:56] and he said this is my battle you ain't
[1:59:59] even going to have to fight in this
[2:00:00] battle and the Bible said that
[2:00:02] Jehoshaphat set up singers and he set
[2:00:06] them up to sing to the beauty of his
[2:00:08] Holiness for his Mercy endures forever
[2:00:12] and the Bible said that when they begin
[2:00:15] to sing aloud and praise the Lord that
[2:00:18] the Lord sent out ambushments
[2:00:21] if you get to studying out that word it
[2:00:24] means to lie in wait that the Lord was
[2:00:27] lying and wait for all of them enemies
[2:00:30] if you go to studying a little bit
[2:00:32] deeper it said that the Lord said
[2:00:34] ambushments what was it it was a
[2:00:37] confusion their praise caused a
[2:00:40] confusion to come upon the enemies and
[2:00:43] the enemies turned around and destroyed
[2:00:45] themselves
[2:00:49] let me tell you when fear gets a
[2:00:52] fighting anxiety and depression gets a
[2:00:55] fighting suicide and you start singing
[2:00:58] your way through it's time to have
[2:01:01] yourself a dancing party
[2:01:05] the Lord is in your praise and your
[2:01:09] praise
[2:01:10] [Applause]
[2:01:18] come on somebody the Lord was their
[2:01:21] Warrior praise was their weapon but God
[2:01:24] was their victory
[2:01:28] what are you doing brother Angela
[2:01:30] we will not be defeated
[2:01:35] I'm not sure I'm not worshiping him
[2:01:37] through shackles I'm worshiping him
[2:01:41] and our worship has been so great
[2:01:45] I'll tell you how great it is
[2:01:48] you want me to tell you how great it is
[2:01:50] your joy that the enemy stole from you
[2:01:52] it'll take you three days to get it back
[2:01:56] so what are you talking about I'm
[2:01:58] talking about The Spoils of the enemies
[2:02:00] that had come against Jehoshaphat and
[2:02:03] the children of God when they begin to
[2:02:05] worship they didn't lift up their sword
[2:02:07] they didn't lift up their Spears all
[2:02:09] they did sister Melissa was lift up
[2:02:11] their voice and all of them Devils
[2:02:14] turned on themselves and destroyed
[2:02:17] themselves and it took them three days
[2:02:19] to get all the spoils I'll tell you
[2:02:22] there's so much riches in your praise if
[2:02:25] you can praise your Devils will defeat
[2:02:28] if you can praise they will fall down if
[2:02:31] you can praise suicide will crumple if
[2:02:34] you can praise fear will fall
