[42:20] God. Thank you. When I'm
[42:24] [Music]
[42:27] broken, I've been
[42:31] weakened. Ever holy
[42:35] name. Hallelujah. Don't we serve an
[42:39] awesome God? Amen. He's so worthy of all
[42:42] praise, honor, and glory. Amen. He's so
[42:45] awesome. Death couldn't hold him.
[42:49] Then he took your sins and he went to
[42:51] hell. And brother Vernon, hell couldn't
[42:53] hold him.
[42:55] We serve an awesome God.
[42:59] Hallelujah.
[43:01] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[43:06] Amen. Now, aren't you we we should be
[43:08] the happiest people in the world to be
[43:10] serving a living God. It's not just
[43:13] doctrine and Sister Heather. It's not
[43:15] just forms. It's not just creeds, but to
[43:17] serve a living God.
[43:20] One day, we're going to see him face to
[43:22] face.
[43:23] But until then, we feel the presence
[43:25] that we feel right here.
[43:28] He's so real.
[43:30] And if you don't know him in this
[43:32] reality, he's real.
[43:35] He can be accessed in this reality
[43:39] where faith becomes so real, brother
[43:42] Matt, that you don't even need to see
[43:44] him. You know he's here.
[43:48] His word said he'd be here. But you as
[43:51] the elect body of Christ has got
[43:53] something called the six sense of faith.
[43:57] And you can just tell when he draws an
[44:00] so thankful. so thankful that he would
[44:02] come to us and and and speak to our
[44:05] hearts and and see what do my children
[44:08] need. What can I do for you today?
[44:13] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[44:14] Certainly good to be in the house of the
[44:15] Lord. God bless each and every one of
[44:16] you. It's such an honor and a privilege
[44:19] to stand before you. As it was mentioned
[44:21] already, we certainly want to remember
[44:23] and pray for Brother Ron that God will
[44:25] just give him supernatural strength.
[44:27] Amen. God's been so good to him. But you
[44:30] know, we all need the Lord every day.
[44:32] Amen. So, we just continue to pray for
[44:34] Brother Ron and Brother Andrew there in
[44:36] New Zealand. Have a wonderful services
[44:38] and just pray the Lord continue to bless
[44:41] as he faithfully does. And then don't
[44:43] forget Brother William in Elton,
[44:45] Virginia.
[44:46] Come on, buddy.
[44:50] Amen.
[44:53] I need your prayers, too. And remember,
[44:55] Brother Matt in the morning also in
[44:57] Elton, Virginia. Amen. Amen. God bless
[45:00] you and happy Easter and resurrection
[45:02] weekend to you all. You know, we sorry
[45:04] to keep you standing here, but you know,
[45:06] we called yesterday Good Friday. Amen.
[45:08] And it is a good Friday for us.
[45:12] But, you know, it was a rough Friday for
[45:14] somebody.
[45:17] It was. And it was a terrible Friday for
[45:20] the devil.
[45:24] He thought he had him. He thought it was
[45:25] a victory.
[45:27] Satan thought he had a victory on the
[45:29] Lord Jesus. Turns out it was his
[45:31] greatest defeat.
[45:34] His greatest defeat. Thank you, Lord
[45:37] Jesus. Amen. If you'll turn with me to
[45:39] the scriptures. Thank you, musicians.
[45:40] We'll read in two places. We'll begin in
[45:42] Exodus chapter
[45:44] 25 and then we'll slip over to Matthew
[45:47] the 27th chapter. Brother Matt, could
[45:49] you get me a bottle of water? One of the
[45:51] brother
[45:53] Matts. Amen. God bless him.
[45:56] Exodus chapter 25, we'll begin reading
[45:58] in verse 17.
[46:06] The scripture reads, "And thou shalt
[46:09] make a mercy seat of pure gold. Two
[46:13] cubits and a half shall be the length
[46:14] thereof, and a cubit and a half the
[46:16] breath thereof. And thou shalt make two
[46:18] cherubams of gold, thank you. Of be in
[46:21] work shalt thou make them. In the two
[46:24] ends of the mercy seat, and make one
[46:27] cherub on the one end, and on the other
[46:29] cherub on the other end, even of the
[46:31] mercy seat shall ye make the cherubams
[46:34] on the two ends thereof. And the
[46:36] cherubams shall stretch forth their
[46:37] wings on high, covering the mercy seat
[46:39] with their wings. And their faces shall
[46:42] look one to another toward the mercy
[46:44] seat shall the faces of the cherubams
[46:46] be. Notice what direction the face of
[46:49] the cherubams are facing. And thou shalt
[46:51] put the mercy seat above upon the ark.
[46:54] And in the ark shalt thou put the
[46:55] testimony that I shall give thee. And I
[46:58] will meet with thee, and I and there I
[47:02] will meet with thee, and I will commune
[47:04] with thee from above the mercy seat,
[47:06] from between the two cher cherubams,
[47:08] which are upon the ark of the testimony,
[47:10] of all things which I will give thee in
[47:12] commandment unto the children of Israel.
[47:15] Amen. In Matthew 27 and verse
[47:20] 46, and about the 9inth
[47:22] hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice,
[47:26] saying, Eli, Eli, Lama
[47:30] Sabaki. That is to say, my God, my God,
[47:34] why hast thou forsaken me? Think about
[47:36] what a
[47:37] question. Here he was his entire life,
[47:40] his entire ministry on the earth in a
[47:44] constant communication with his father
[47:46] doing nothing but what the father shows
[47:48] him. And at this pivotal moment, Amen.
[47:52] When humanly speaking, it looks like he
[47:54] would need him most. He screams out, "My
[47:57] God, my
[47:58] God, why have you forsaken
[48:03] me?" But Jesus took your sins.
[48:06] Jesus died a
[48:09] sinner because that's why he had to go
[48:11] to hell. Part of the reason he went to
[48:14] hell was because he died a sinner. Amen.
[48:17] Let's read on. Verse 47. Some of them
[48:20] that stood there when they heard it
[48:21] said, "This man cried calleth for
[48:24] Elijah." And straightway one of them ran
[48:26] and took a sponge and filled it with
[48:27] vinegar and put it on a reed and gave
[48:29] him to drink. The rest said, "Let be let
[48:32] us see whether Elijah will come to save
[48:34] him." Jesus, when he had cried again
[48:37] with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.
[48:40] And behold, the veil of the temple was
[48:42] rent in twain from the top to the bottom
[48:45] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[48:48] rent. Let us pray. Dear gracious
[48:51] heavenly father, Lord, as we stand in
[48:52] your divine presence, Lord, we thank you
[48:55] for the faithfulness of your presence,
[48:56] Lord. And you said where two or three
[48:58] are gathered, Lord, in your name, you'll
[48:59] be in our midst. And you've been so
[49:01] faithful, Lord, ever since. We love you
[49:03] with all of our hearts. We pray you
[49:04] forgive us of our sins. I pray Lord if
[49:07] you help me do one thing tonight Lord is
[49:09] to get out of the way. Speak to us Lord
[49:12] Jesus. We're all hungry for you and
[49:14] we've all come to hear from you. Bless
[49:15] us now we pray. We commit the service
[49:17] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name.
[49:19] Amen. God bless you as you're
[49:24] seated. With the help of the Lord this
[49:26] evening, I'd like to title this the
[49:28] unveiled mercy seat. Hallelujah. Amen.
[49:32] You know, we all come from different
[49:34] backgrounds. We all have different
[49:36] stories of how we're here. But there's
[49:37] one thing that we all have in common.
[49:40] Come on. Is we need mercy. Amen. We need
[49:43] the mercy of the Lord
[49:45] Jesus. And in the beginning in the
[49:47] Garden of Eden, Adam, God would speak to
[49:50] Adam and Eve face to face. He'd come
[49:51] down and he tuck them in at night as it
[49:54] were. And he took such great care. He
[49:56] made the Garden of Eden just to their
[49:58] liking and had everything so perfect.
[50:00] But you know what's ever since the fall,
[50:02] God has had to veil
[50:04] himself right when being worshiped.
[50:07] That's right. Because man, whenever Adam
[50:09] and Eve fell, they it sold the entire
[50:11] human race away into sin. So we cannot
[50:14] access God as as Adam and Eve once did.
[50:17] Nor has God even intended that we that
[50:20] we access him. So we had to make a
[50:23] substitution. And that's where the blood
[50:24] of bulls and goats came. In the garden
[50:27] of Eden, there was a promise of a
[50:28] savior. But until that time came to
[50:30] fruition, he accepted the blood of bulls
[50:33] and goats. We understand there that Adam
[50:35] and Eve try to make a fig leaf apron.
[50:38] Amen. And they try to cover themselves
[50:40] because they realize that they were
[50:41] naked. And God killed an animal and he
[50:45] clothed them with the animal skins.
[50:47] That's right. Now, if you'll if you'll
[50:49] pardon me just just a moment here, if
[50:51] y'all if y'all could pull up uh
[50:53] Leviticus chapter 16, we'll begin with
[50:55] verse two. And just it's a bit of a
[50:57] lengthy read, but just to kind of lay a
[50:59] foundation for tonight if you bear with
[51:01] me here. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[51:04] speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he
[51:07] come not at all times into the holy
[51:09] place within the veil before the mercy
[51:11] seat, which is upon the ark, that he die
[51:13] not. For I will appear in the cloud upon
[51:15] the mercy seat. Thus Aaron shall come
[51:19] into the holy place with a young bullock
[51:21] for a sin offering, and a ram for a
[51:24] burnt offering. So, this is the time
[51:26] that God is laying things out to Moses
[51:28] on how to worship him, how to come back
[51:32] and fellowship with him, right? And they
[51:34] have the tabernacle of witness. And uh
[51:36] it's been some years back, but if y'all
[51:38] go to Lancaster, they have got a
[51:40] recreation of this tabernacle of
[51:42] witness. If you haven't seen it yet,
[51:43] it's it's a really neat place to go and
[51:45] see. And it it just gives you the visual
[51:47] and it gives you the the scale and the
[51:48] perspective of what the Old Testament
[51:51] saints there, Israel, had what the
[51:53] process they went through and things. In
[51:55] verse three, thus shall Aaron come into
[51:56] the holy place with a young bullock for
[51:58] a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt
[52:00] offering. He shall put on the holy linen
[52:02] coat, and he shall have the the linen
[52:04] breaches upon his flesh, and shall be
[52:06] girded with a linen girdle, and the
[52:09] linton and the linen miter shall he be
[52:12] attired. These are holy garments.
[52:14] Therefore shall he wash his flesh in
[52:16] water, and so put them on. And he shall
[52:18] take of the congregation of the children
[52:20] of Israel two kids of the goats for a
[52:23] sin offering and one ram for a burnt
[52:26] offering. Now everywhere you look you
[52:28] see Jesus Christ. That's right. And
[52:31] Aaron shall offer his bullock for the
[52:33] sin offering which is for himself and
[52:35] make an atonement for himself and for
[52:37] his house. And he shall take the two
[52:39] goats and present them before the Lord
[52:40] at the door of the tabernacle of the
[52:42] congregation. And Aaron shall cast lots
[52:45] upon the two goats, one for the Lord and
[52:47] the other lot for the
[52:49] scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the
[52:52] goat upon which the Lord's lot fell and
[52:55] offer him for a sin offering. But the
[52:57] goat on which the lot fell to be the
[52:59] scapegoat shall be presented alive
[53:01] before the Lord to make an atonement
[53:03] with him and let him go for a scapegoat
[53:06] into the wilderness. Again, Jesus Christ
[53:09] represents both of these. both the goat
[53:10] that had to be killed and the goat where
[53:12] where Aaron would confess the sins of
[53:15] Israel on the the goat that was allowed
[53:17] to to live the scapegoat and would
[53:19] release him into the wilderness. The
[53:21] prophet said that both of them type the
[53:22] Lord Jesus Christ because he bore our
[53:25] sins. He both died for our sins but he
[53:28] also bore our sins. Amen.
[53:30] And in verse 12, and he shall take a
[53:33] sensor of full of burning coals of fire
[53:36] from off the altar before the Lord, and
[53:37] his hand, and his hands full of sweet
[53:40] incense beaten small, and bring it
[53:42] within the veil. And he shall put
[53:44] incense upon the fire before the Lord,
[53:46] that the cloud of the incense may cover
[53:49] the mercy seat, that is upon the
[53:51] testimony that he die not. And he shall
[53:54] take the blood of the bullock and
[53:55] sprinkle it with his finger upon the
[53:57] mercy seat eastward. And before the
[53:59] mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood
[54:02] with his finger seven times. So to give
[54:06] you a mental picture of how the
[54:07] tabernacle was set up, you had the outer
[54:10] court and then you then that's where
[54:12] they would sacrifice and wash wash the
[54:14] sacrifices. And on the inside of that,
[54:16] they had a a veil would go through there
[54:17] and you'd go in and that would be the
[54:19] inner court or sometimes called the holy
[54:21] places. And that's where the lampstand
[54:22] would be. That would be where the shoe
[54:24] bread would be, right? That would be
[54:25] where where where the the table was set
[54:27] there. And the priests would go in that
[54:29] first holy place and they would
[54:31] minister. They'd keep the the candles
[54:32] lit. They'd keep fresh bread on the
[54:34] table and they would minister in that
[54:37] first holy place.
[54:39] Beyond the holy place, you had another
[54:41] veil and that was to cover the holiest
[54:44] of holies. Amen. Now, in there, only one
[54:48] priest, one chosen man went in that
[54:52] holiest of holies once a year on the day
[54:55] of atonement. Right? And that's what God
[54:57] is explaining. That's what we that's
[54:59] what we're reading right here is that
[55:00] God had a certain way that he had to be
[55:03] approached. So whenever the the high
[55:05] priest would go into the holiest of
[55:07] holies, he had to have this blood with
[55:10] him and he would go in and he he would
[55:12] first and he would he would offer blood
[55:14] for his own sins because he was a man
[55:16] and he had sins. His family had sins. So
[55:20] he would offer the blood for himself,
[55:22] for his family, and all of Israel. And
[55:24] he would dip his finger in the blood of
[55:26] an innocent bulllock and goat, and he'd
[55:28] strike the mercy seat seven times.
[55:35] And the scripture says, "Then shall he
[55:37] kill the the goat of the sin offering
[55:39] that is for the people and bring his
[55:41] blood within the veil and do with that
[55:43] blood as he did with the blood of the
[55:45] bullock." So the first was for him and
[55:46] his family. And then he would go back in
[55:48] and do it for all of Israel and sprinkle
[55:50] it upon the mercy seat and before the
[55:52] mercy seat. And in verse 16, and he
[55:55] shall make an atonement for the holy
[55:56] place, because of the uncleanliness of
[55:58] the children of Israel, and because of
[56:00] their transgressions, and all their
[56:02] sins, so shall he do for the tabernacle
[56:05] of the congregation that remainth among
[56:08] them in the
[56:10] midst of their uncleanliness.
[56:14] God require this, right? And when he
[56:17] would go in and once a year as I said
[56:19] and he would sprinkle the blood and then
[56:21] seven stripes of blood type the seven
[56:23] church ages right that all are covered
[56:26] by the blood
[56:29] now the Bible talks about the cherubams
[56:31] being on the mercy seat we we recall
[56:33] that whenever Adam and Eve when they
[56:35] fellowshipped with God in perfect
[56:37] harmony brother Chris they they would it
[56:40] was perfect fellowship well after the
[56:41] fall they then the the tree of life is
[56:45] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. The tree of
[56:47] life and the mercy seat is both inter
[56:50] used interchangeably and it is the Lord
[56:52] Jesus Christ. Right. Amen. So whenever
[56:56] Adam and Eve sinned, they could no
[56:58] longer have access to the tree of life
[57:01] in the same way they did before. That's
[57:03] right. They then had to sacrifice and
[57:05] come under the blood of bulls and goats.
[57:09] So what did God do? He set, you can read
[57:11] there in Genesis that he in Genesis uh
[57:13] 3:24 that he placed at the east of the
[57:16] Garden of Eden cherubams, right? There
[57:20] were four cherubams. Come on. And the
[57:23] cherubams each had a flaming sword,
[57:24] brother Gabriel. And they kept the way
[57:26] of the tree of life, right? What does
[57:29] that mean? That means that they would
[57:30] block humanity's access to the tree of
[57:34] life. Right. for a given amount of time
[57:37] until that tree of life became flesh.
[57:43] And when that tree of life became flesh,
[57:45] that changes the picture.
[57:49] We'll get to that a little later on
[57:51] hopefully. But God was then protecting
[57:53] the tree of life because they could not
[57:56] access the tree of life with sin on
[57:59] them, right? And live forever, right?
[58:03] God had to do something to redeem them
[58:06] back. Amen. The tree of life had to take
[58:08] on flesh. Amen.
[58:12] So the only way to regain fellowship now
[58:14] was through the shedding of innocent
[58:16] blood. The animal life didn't sin.
[58:20] Humanity sinned. But because they were
[58:23] they were the top creation, everything
[58:25] fell underneath it. So So as as we go
[58:29] along after the Garden of Eden, we know
[58:31] the story of Noah and the flood. And
[58:32] then after knowing the flood, as a a
[58:35] point, God begins to deal with Abraham.
[58:37] We're very familiar with that. And then
[58:39] Isaac and Jacob. And then Jacob gets his
[58:42] name changed. And then Joseph and they
[58:44] all end up in Egypt. Right? You
[58:46] following me so far? They all end up in
[58:48] Egypt. And they're there just like God
[58:49] told Abraham for 400 years.
[58:54] Just over 400 years.
[58:57] So after all that slavery and all that
[58:59] bondage, one day a deliverer is born.
[59:04] Moses knew he was a deliverer because
[59:06] his he was raising the message, right?
[59:08] He was raised up to believe the things
[59:10] and his mama told him, "You're a special
[59:13] boy, right? Remember the angel of the
[59:16] Lord met met his dad there, his mom, his
[59:18] parents, right? That is why she could
[59:20] have the faith to put him in a basket
[59:22] and send him down the Nile cuz she knew
[59:25] that he was going to be the the the
[59:27] prophet messenger of that age. She knew
[59:30] he was going to be the deliverer, right?
[59:34] So Moses throughout the process of time,
[59:36] he needed his own experience. So you
[59:38] know the story, he got he he got run out
[59:40] of Egypt and he's up there hurting the
[59:41] sheep and begin to lose the burden of
[59:43] the people. And God met him in a burning
[59:47] bush and gave him his own experience.
[59:51] And every single one of us need that
[59:53] same burning bush experience. We must
[59:55] meet the Think about this. You hear the
[59:58] prophet talk about the same pillar of
[59:59] fire that led Moses is with us. But we
[1:00:02] have got to meet the same pillar of
[1:00:04] fire. We've got to meet the same God
[1:00:07] Moses did. It doesn't change. Moses had
[1:00:10] to meet the same God that Jacob wrestled
[1:00:11] with. Jacob had to meet the same God
[1:00:14] that Isaac met. Isaac had to meet that
[1:00:16] same God of Abraham. So just you can go
[1:00:19] backward or forward. We have to meet the
[1:00:22] same Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Come on.
[1:00:26] So Moses is there and he and he's having
[1:00:28] a conversation with God. God tells him
[1:00:30] he's on holy ground and he takes his
[1:00:32] sandals off and he's in there talking to
[1:00:33] God and God gave Moses begins to tell
[1:00:36] Moses that you've got to go down. And
[1:00:38] what does Moses do? He begins to make
[1:00:40] excuses about how he stutters and he's
[1:00:43] not able and all these different
[1:00:44] excuses. But God and then he said, "How
[1:00:46] will how will the people know? How will
[1:00:48] they believe me?" And God told Moses,
[1:00:51] "I'll give you two signs
[1:00:54] to vindicate your
[1:00:56] ministry." And in Exodus 3:12, "And he
[1:01:00] said talking, God speaking here,
[1:01:01] certainly I will be with thee, and this
[1:01:04] shall be a token unto thee that I have
[1:01:06] sent thee. when thou hast brought forth
[1:01:09] a people out of Egypt, ye shall serve
[1:01:11] God upon this mountain. So, what God is
[1:01:15] promising Moses is right here where
[1:01:17] you're kneeling before me. That's right.
[1:01:19] I'm giving you two signs to go call them
[1:01:21] out.
[1:01:23] When you do call them out and y'all all
[1:01:26] come out and you're leading them, two
[1:01:28] million plus people, you're going to
[1:01:29] lead them right back to this spot where
[1:01:31] I'm meeting you, right? And you're going
[1:01:34] to worship me at this mountain. That's
[1:01:36] right. That was a promise that God made
[1:01:39] to him. See, Moses met God at the
[1:01:43] burning bush privately. That's right.
[1:01:46] Nobody was there. That's right.
[1:01:49] He had to come down and he went into
[1:01:51] Egypt as a one-man invasion. Right. And
[1:01:54] he said, "The God of your fathers have
[1:01:56] met me." And they begin to ask him,
[1:01:58] "What's his name? I am that I am." And
[1:02:00] he begin to perform the signs. Right?
[1:02:04] And then after all the plagues and they
[1:02:06] come out of Egypt, God then leads them
[1:02:08] right back to the mountain so that he
[1:02:10] can publicly vindicate Moses. That's
[1:02:13] right. Is it starting to sound a little
[1:02:15] familiar to you? Right. When when
[1:02:18] brother Brandon first met the angel of
[1:02:19] the Lord in that cabin, was there any
[1:02:21] witnesses?
[1:02:24] None. He was there by himself and he was
[1:02:27] praying about the gift that all the
[1:02:28] preachers were calling the devil. And
[1:02:30] all of a sudden, an angel steps out of
[1:02:31] that light, right? And he begins to
[1:02:34] testify and people are still doubting.
[1:02:36] And the angel told him as Moses was
[1:02:39] given two signs. You're going to be
[1:02:41] given two signs.
[1:02:44] And he said, if you're humble and
[1:02:46] sincere, the day will come where you're
[1:02:48] even going to know the secrets of their
[1:02:49] hearts.
[1:02:51] That not even cancer will be able to
[1:02:53] stand before you prayer. The prophet
[1:02:56] comes and he starts testifying and he
[1:02:58] spearheads the healing revival. And then
[1:03:00] there comes a day whenever God publicly
[1:03:03] vindicates him.
[1:03:06] Come on.
[1:03:08] Before thousands of people. That's
[1:03:09] right.
[1:03:12] That's right. He tells a story. He tells
[1:03:15] a story.
[1:03:17] There's scoffers. There's unbelievers.
[1:03:20] This is a blessing to preach to
[1:03:21] believers. But imagine brothers
[1:03:23] preaching where you've got people
[1:03:24] pulling against you. That's right. where
[1:03:27] you've got preachers that sneak into the
[1:03:29] congregation after they warn their
[1:03:30] congregation to not come hear you, but
[1:03:32] then they come in here and you got all
[1:03:34] kinds of spirits flying around.
[1:03:37] When that picture was taken, it was
[1:03:39] under a very Go ahead and put it up if
[1:03:41] you don't mind so the audience online
[1:03:43] can see it
[1:03:44] too. Whenever this picture was taken,
[1:03:48] Amen. It was taken in a coliseum full of
[1:03:52] even critics. That's right. It was a
[1:03:54] mix. There were believers there. There
[1:03:55] were people that were healed that stood
[1:03:56] up and testified that they were healed.
[1:03:59] But it was taken under very extreme
[1:04:01] pressure. And you know that even the
[1:04:03] Exodus pulled out a mixed multitude.
[1:04:08] A mixed multitude. There were people
[1:04:10] that were there that were true believers
[1:04:12] and then there were people there that
[1:04:13] were there for the wrong reasons. Right.
[1:04:16] Now notice in Exodus 19, he's now
[1:04:18] getting ready to vindicate Moses. As I
[1:04:20] said, in the sight of all Israel. Moses,
[1:04:23] you've been faithful. You told them that
[1:04:25] you met me. You You performed the signs.
[1:04:28] You did everything I told you. Now I'm
[1:04:30] getting ready to prove to
[1:04:32] them that this is indeed you are the
[1:04:37] undisputed word messenger of the day.
[1:04:41] You are the first Exodus prophet. Moses
[1:04:45] had nothing into it, but God was
[1:04:47] stepping in and he was then going to
[1:04:49] show that this is what he did. That's
[1:04:51] right. In Exodus 19, and the Lord said
[1:04:53] unto Moses, "Lo, I come unto thee in a
[1:04:55] thick cloud, that the people may hear
[1:04:57] when I speak with thee, and believe thee
[1:04:59] forever." And Moses told the words of
[1:05:01] the people unto the Lord. And the Lord
[1:05:03] said unto Moses, "Go unto the people,
[1:05:04] and sanctify them today, and tomorrow
[1:05:06] let them wash their clothes, and be
[1:05:08] ready against the third day. For the
[1:05:10] third day the Lord will come down in the
[1:05:13] sight of all the people upon Mount
[1:05:16] Si, and thou shalt set bounds unto the
[1:05:18] people round about, saying, Take heed to
[1:05:20] yourselves, that ye go not up into the
[1:05:22] mount, or touch the border of it.
[1:05:25] Whosoever touchth the mount shall surely
[1:05:28] be put to death. There shall not in hand
[1:05:30] touch it, but ye he shall be surely
[1:05:32] stoned or shot through, whether it be
[1:05:34] beast or man, it shall not live. When
[1:05:37] the trumpet soundth long, they shall
[1:05:40] come up to the
[1:05:42] mount. If a man, God comes down on the
[1:05:45] mountain, Brother Randall, and he's so
[1:05:46] holy,
[1:05:49] he's so holy,
[1:05:52] a believer, a person couldn't even go
[1:05:55] and touch that mountain.
[1:05:59] If an animal happened to accidentally
[1:06:02] stray and touch that mountain, he must
[1:06:04] immediately be killed. That's right.
[1:06:07] That is the holiness of God.
[1:06:12] So, how does God ever save people like
[1:06:14] us?
[1:06:19] Through the mercy seat.
[1:06:23] That's how a holy God. Brethren said
[1:06:26] that angels can look dirty in his sight.
[1:06:29] Saraphims are constantly around him.
[1:06:31] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.
[1:06:34] But one simple prayer of repentance.
[1:06:40] But for you, brother Davey, he's got
[1:06:42] justification.
[1:06:45] As though you've never done it in the
[1:06:47] first place.
[1:06:49] That holy of a God to be able to do such
[1:06:52] a thing. What love.
[1:06:55] What humility.
[1:07:01] So he comes down and all the people in
[1:07:04] the camp begin to
[1:07:06] tremble because Mount Si the scripture
[1:07:08] says was allto together on smoke because
[1:07:10] the Lord descended upon it in
[1:07:16] fire. And remember another place in the
[1:07:18] scriptures they said Moses don't let God
[1:07:21] speak. Right? They were so terrified at
[1:07:24] the presence of God coming down. They
[1:07:26] said don't let Moses don't let God speak
[1:07:27] or we're going to die. Moses you speak
[1:07:29] for God. Right.
[1:07:32] But God was vindicating his prophet.
[1:07:36] Brother Ram, in the in the sermon, the
[1:07:38] unveiling of God, he says, "The pillar
[1:07:39] of fire appearing visibly among us,
[1:07:41] identifying that the message is right
[1:07:44] like he did at Mount Si."
[1:07:46] Amen.
[1:07:48] Pillar of fire identifying that this
[1:07:51] message is right like he did at Mount
[1:07:53] Si. Amen.
[1:07:55] The first Exodus like he vinded the
[1:07:58] first Exodus and the first Exodus
[1:07:59] prophet he's vindicated the third Exodus
[1:08:02] prophet.
[1:08:05] identified by a pillar of fire.
[1:08:09] Undisputable.
[1:08:12] I don't care what the critic said. I
[1:08:14] said it was undisputable.
[1:08:19] What did Brother Ram said? He said the
[1:08:21] picture is more evidence than you seeing
[1:08:23] it.
[1:08:25] You think about that. Why is the
[1:08:26] picture? Because you can't you can't
[1:08:28] blame maybe somebody opening a door or
[1:08:31] Satan can't reason that away from you.
[1:08:33] That is a picture. The the light struck
[1:08:36] the lens.
[1:08:39] That's as basic English as you can get.
[1:08:43] The light struck the lens. Come on.
[1:08:48] And when that same light strikes your
[1:08:51] lens of your heart,
[1:08:54] you'll then understand the message.
[1:08:56] You'll believe the message. You'll then
[1:08:58] come to life.
[1:09:00] It'll be it won't be no fluke.
[1:09:04] Amen. Good. So he identifies the
[1:09:08] messages, right? Like he did at Mount
[1:09:09] Si. Remember before the true message
[1:09:11] come forth, Moses preached and he led
[1:09:14] them out of Egypt. But there before the
[1:09:17] real commandments was laid down, the
[1:09:20] seals was brought
[1:09:23] in that he said that. That's right. So
[1:09:27] here you have the prophet typing the
[1:09:29] commandments with the seals.
[1:09:32] Up in a mountain.
[1:09:35] Come on. And the smoke thereof ascended
[1:09:39] as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole
[1:09:41] mount
[1:09:43] quakdly. There was some thundering going
[1:09:46] on. Oh yeah.
[1:09:50] He said, "God, come down before the
[1:09:52] people and prove that Moses was sent
[1:09:54] from him in a pillar of fire that Moses
[1:09:57] said he has seen in a bush and talked to
[1:10:02] him." And the Lord
[1:10:04] came upon Mount
[1:10:08] Si. This is in Exodus 19 verse 20. And
[1:10:12] the Lord came down upon Mount
[1:10:14] Si on the top of the
[1:10:17] mount. And the Lord called Moses up to
[1:10:20] the top of the mountain.
[1:10:22] And Moses went
[1:10:25] up. Now, I want us to watch something
[1:10:27] here. I want to take just a a brief
[1:10:29] moment of time to point something out
[1:10:30] here. Could you pull up Malachi chapter
[1:10:33] 4? Remember what he said? He met him in
[1:10:37] the burning bush and said, "You're going
[1:10:38] to worship me again on this mountain."
[1:10:41] Malachi chapter 4 verse
[1:10:44] 1. For behold, the day cometh that shall
[1:10:47] burn as an oven, and all the proud, yay,
[1:10:49] and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:10:50] stubble. And the day cometh that shall
[1:10:52] burn them up, sayeth the Lord of hosts,
[1:10:54] that it shall leave them neither root
[1:10:56] nor branch.
[1:10:57] But unto you that fear my name shall the
[1:11:00] son of righteousness arise with healing
[1:11:02] in his wings, and ye shall go forth and
[1:11:04] grow up as calves of the stall, and ye
[1:11:07] shall tread down the wicked, for they
[1:11:09] shall be ashes under the souls of your
[1:11:11] feet in the day that I shall do this,
[1:11:13] sayeth the Lord of hosts." Now, here
[1:11:16] it's about to be announced. Brother
[1:11:18] Brandham's coming. But look at what he
[1:11:21] says here in this verse. Remember ye the
[1:11:25] law of Moses my servant which I
[1:11:28] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[1:11:31] Israel with the statutes and judgments.
[1:11:35] Mount Horeb and Mount Si is the same
[1:11:38] place. Right? Amen. So God before he
[1:11:42] gives out the promise of Elijah,
[1:11:45] he says remember the law of Moses my
[1:11:49] servant. Right?
[1:11:51] He had he met God and he brought the he
[1:11:55] brought the chosen people right back to
[1:11:56] the same place.
[1:11:59] Thank you, Lord. And now he says,
[1:12:01] "Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:12:03] before the coming of the great and
[1:12:05] dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall
[1:12:08] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:12:09] children and the heart of the children
[1:12:10] to their fathers, lest I come and smite
[1:12:13] the earth with a curse." Same mountain.
[1:12:18] Amen. Remember the sermon, is this the
[1:12:21] time of the end, sir?
[1:12:24] Brother Brandham has a vision of an
[1:12:26] explosion and God gives him a sign. It
[1:12:28] says, "When they drive a stake on at the
[1:12:30] end of your driveway, that's your sign
[1:12:32] to move west." Right? Amen.
[1:12:37] There's no deserts in the east, right?
[1:12:40] But he was also a prophet like unto
[1:12:44] Moses. Jesus Christ was the fulfillment
[1:12:46] of that prophecy. But in type, brother
[1:12:49] Brandham was also like a Moses. That's
[1:12:51] right. He was the third Exodus prophet.
[1:12:54] He was identified by a pillar of fire.
[1:12:57] God revealed the seven seals to him
[1:13:01] and he's in the desert and remember he's
[1:13:03] picking cocoa birds off of his trouser
[1:13:05] leg
[1:13:07] and he hears a blast
[1:13:09] and he was caught up and met seven
[1:13:11] angels.
[1:13:14] That happened in the desert. Amen.
[1:13:18] Mount Sunset
[1:13:21] in the evening time
[1:13:24] because as the as the sun rises in the
[1:13:26] east, so it sets in the west. So shall
[1:13:29] the coming of the son of man be. That's
[1:13:31] right. You can't make this up.
[1:13:35] You just can't. The word is perfect.
[1:13:40] In our own natural lives, God will make
[1:13:42] us a promise and we think it's going to
[1:13:43] come to pass this way and we're in
[1:13:45] expectation and we should be. But after
[1:13:47] it comes to pass, we realize that's the
[1:13:49] way God wanted it. He interprets his
[1:13:51] word by bringing it to pass. When God
[1:13:55] brings his word to pass, that's the
[1:13:57] interpretation of it. Right?
[1:14:01] So God tells Moses to come up in this
[1:14:03] mountain and he reveals he he was
[1:14:06] revealing the text that we read about
[1:14:07] how to worship him. He he was up there
[1:14:09] for 40
[1:14:10] days and 40 nights.
[1:14:14] He was receiving the word of the Lord.
[1:14:16] And while he's up there, Israel was just
[1:14:18] trembling at the presence of God. And
[1:14:20] while Moses is up there, they already
[1:14:22] forgot, right? They already begin to
[1:14:25] make an idol. And they already begin to
[1:14:27] to to ordain a priest and say, "Take us
[1:14:29] back to Israel." What I don't even know
[1:14:31] what happened to Moses just 30 something
[1:14:34] days ago. You were you were begging
[1:14:36] Moses to speak instead of God. Right?
[1:14:39] And now you're ready to forget about
[1:14:41] Moses and go back to Egypt.
[1:14:44] Do you see? I'm I'm going to say it. Do
[1:14:46] you see the insanity of unbelief? That's
[1:14:49] right.
[1:14:51] People call us crazy. I say unbelief is
[1:14:55] crazy. When God vindicates his word,
[1:14:58] you're crazy not to believe it.
[1:15:05] When God vindicates his word, you're
[1:15:08] crazy not to believe it.
[1:15:12] And then people down there were losing
[1:15:13] their minds
[1:15:15] in just 40 days.
[1:15:21] 40 days, right? They started losing it.
[1:15:26] So Moses is up there and he you think
[1:15:28] he's in that heavenly atmosphere and God
[1:15:31] begins to clue him in on what's going on
[1:15:33] down there. That's right. And he said,
[1:15:35] "I'm going to destroy them and I'm going
[1:15:37] to start a nation all over with you."
[1:15:40] And Moses, brother, the Bible says there
[1:15:42] was there wasn't a meek man like Moses.
[1:15:44] I know that we can see a temper side of
[1:15:46] him and his humanity, but the scripture
[1:15:49] said that there wasn't a there was no
[1:15:51] man as meek as Moses. And Moses throws
[1:15:54] himself in the in the breach and he
[1:15:56] said, "God, you take you block my name
[1:15:58] out."
[1:16:00] Brother Ram said for the longest time it
[1:16:02] looked like it that part really confused
[1:16:04] him because he he thought it looked like
[1:16:07] Moses had a better idea than God because
[1:16:10] God was like, "You know what? You're
[1:16:11] right. That that's actually I'm going to
[1:16:13] listen to you, Moses." But what was it
[1:16:15] that softened God's heart? He's seen
[1:16:19] Jesus Christ in Moses. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:22] Right. Who became sin for us, he became
[1:16:26] a curse for us.
[1:16:29] Amen.
[1:16:31] So when Moses comes down off the
[1:16:33] mountain in Exodus 32:15, and Moses
[1:16:35] turned and went down from the mount, and
[1:16:37] the two tables of the testimony were in
[1:16:38] his hand, y'all seen the Ten
[1:16:40] Commandments. Now watch this language.
[1:16:43] And the tables were written on both
[1:16:46] their
[1:16:47] sides. On the one side and on the other
[1:16:51] side were they written. Amen. And I saw
[1:16:56] on the right hand of him that sat upon
[1:16:58] the throne a book written within and
[1:17:00] without. Come on. Written within and on
[1:17:02] the backside sealed with seven seals.
[1:17:05] And Moses is coming down off the
[1:17:07] mountain being in the presence of God.
[1:17:09] Come on. With the word. Because remember
[1:17:12] the entire Old Testament is written and
[1:17:15] based off the law of Moses, right?
[1:17:20] And he comes down from that heavenly
[1:17:22] atmosphere and what does he
[1:17:24] see? Hell came up.
[1:17:28] That's right. What did the prophet say?
[1:17:31] He said, "When you're in them
[1:17:33] atmospheres and then you come down and
[1:17:35] you see sin all out in the world, it
[1:17:38] tears you to pieces." Right. What's it
[1:17:40] What does it do to you? Enjoy such
[1:17:42] heavenly atmosphere in the weekend on
[1:17:43] Monday morning, you got to go back to
[1:17:45] work.
[1:17:47] You got to go to Walmart.
[1:17:51] Come on. Everybody always knows what
[1:17:53] that means.
[1:18:01] In verse 16, and the tables were the
[1:18:03] work of God, and the writing was the
[1:18:04] writing of God graven upon the
[1:18:08] tables. And when he comes down, and
[1:18:10] Joshua heard the noise of the people as
[1:18:11] they shouted, and said, he said unto
[1:18:13] Moses, there's a noise of war in the
[1:18:15] camp, but he said, "It's not the voice
[1:18:16] of them that that shout for mastery,
[1:18:18] neither is it the voice of them that cry
[1:18:20] for being overcome, but the noise of
[1:18:22] them that sing do I hear." And he came,
[1:18:24] and it came to pass as soon as he came n
[1:18:26] to the camp that he saw the calf and the
[1:18:28] dancing. And Moses's anger waxed hot and
[1:18:32] he cast the tables out of his hand and
[1:18:34] break them beneath the mount.
[1:18:38] Amen. He couldn't stand to see the sin.
[1:18:40] They were because see Mount Si wasn't a
[1:18:43] mercy seat yet.
[1:18:46] That is why God said, "Whoever touches
[1:18:47] it, whoever comes near it, you kill him
[1:18:49] on the spot." Right? The mercy seat was
[1:18:52] not set in order. So here you have a
[1:18:54] prophet that came out of the presence of
[1:18:56] God and he sees all this sin.
[1:18:58] Amen.
[1:19:00] And when Moses stood in the gate,
[1:19:04] Christ of the camp and said, "Who is on
[1:19:06] the Lord's side? Let him come unto
[1:19:10] me." Could you imagine being
[1:19:14] there and he comes off the mountain and
[1:19:16] Moses after 40 days finally comes down
[1:19:20] and he's got the Ten Commandments with
[1:19:22] him. He's got the law, the word of God.
[1:19:24] He's got thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:19:26] And there's filth and nonsense going on
[1:19:28] in 40 days, right? And he breaks these
[1:19:32] commandments and God's judgment begins
[1:19:33] to to rain down and he bellows out,
[1:19:35] "Who's on the Lord's side? Let him come
[1:19:38] to me." That's right. He wasn't talking
[1:19:40] about the man 16 elements of Moses. He
[1:19:43] was talking about the God.
[1:19:47] Who's on the Lord's side?
[1:19:50] That cry is going out now.
[1:19:53] Who's on the Lord's side? Let them come
[1:19:55] to this message and stand with Jesus
[1:19:58] Christ. That's right. That's right. And
[1:20:01] the sons of Levi gather them themselves
[1:20:03] together. In the sermon, the indictment,
[1:20:05] brother said, I say it on tape and for
[1:20:08] this audience, I say this under the
[1:20:10] inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Who is on
[1:20:12] the Lord's side? Let him come under this
[1:20:15] word.
[1:20:17] God will surely bring this wicked Christ
[1:20:19] denying Christ rejecting generation into
[1:20:22] judgment for blasphemy, the crucifixion
[1:20:24] of his identified word. They're coming
[1:20:28] to the judgment. I indict it. Who's on
[1:20:30] the Lord's side? Said Moses, let them
[1:20:32] come unto me when the pillar of fire
[1:20:33] hanging there as an evidence.
[1:20:37] Who is on the Lord's side? Let him take
[1:20:38] up the word, deny his creed, and follow
[1:20:42] Christ daily. Right?
[1:20:53] Judgment struck those who rejected the
[1:20:55] vindicated word. And that same principle
[1:20:58] is the same today.
[1:21:01] When they came against Moses and they
[1:21:03] said, "You think you're the only holy
[1:21:04] one. You think you're the only one that
[1:21:06] hears from God." What happened to them
[1:21:08] people of Dayton and Corora?
[1:21:10] the ground opened up right where they
[1:21:12] were, brother Jerry, and swallow them.
[1:21:15] What happens to people that say, "What
[1:21:16] makes him think that he's the only
[1:21:18] prophet, that he's the only talk, you
[1:21:19] know, that that talks for God and that
[1:21:21] met an angel? There's there's other
[1:21:22] people out there, too. I don't believe
[1:21:24] this anymore." What happens to them
[1:21:26] people?
[1:21:28] The world opens up and swallows them.
[1:21:31] That's right.
[1:21:34] The same thing. You have the same pillar
[1:21:37] of fire. You have the same vindicated
[1:21:38] prophet. You have the same word is
[1:21:40] because the word for the day is Jesus
[1:21:42] Christ and they come against the word
[1:21:44] and the world swallows them up.
[1:21:48] This is serious. Amen.
[1:21:51] See, brother Ron just preached last
[1:21:53] weekend about you got to fight your way
[1:21:55] to hell.
[1:21:57] That's mercy if I ever heard it. Right.
[1:22:01] See, there's mercy right now,
[1:22:04] but mercy will
[1:22:06] literally be over one day. That's right.
[1:22:10] Come on. And when God turns from the
[1:22:12] Gentiles to the Jews, mercy will be
[1:22:14] over. It doesn't matter how much
[1:22:15] somebody begs and how much they cry.
[1:22:18] See, what's the difference when you have
[1:22:20] when you have God's throne? What is the
[1:22:22] difference between a judgment seat and a
[1:22:24] mercy seat? Brother William, what is the
[1:22:26] difference? Blood. That's right.
[1:22:31] Blood. When the blood comes off the
[1:22:34] mercy seat, it's then a judgment seat.
[1:22:35] That's right.
[1:22:37] Who's going to judge the world? Jesus
[1:22:39] Christ and his bride. That's right.
[1:22:40] Well, I thought Jesus Christ was a
[1:22:42] sacrifice. He is. And once once mercy is
[1:22:45] over, he's then the judge. That's right.
[1:22:50] Same. Who's the father? Jesus God. Jesus
[1:22:53] Christ. Who's the son? Jesus Christ.
[1:22:55] Who's the holy ghost? Jesus Christ. It
[1:22:57] all just depends in what office he's in.
[1:23:00] God above us, God with us, God in us.
[1:23:02] There's one God.
[1:23:05] And Jesus Christ is his name.
[1:23:08] We've got to move along. My
[1:23:10] goodness. When Moses came down, I want
[1:23:14] to get to this real quick. When Moses
[1:23:16] came
[1:23:17] down, you think under the blood of bulls
[1:23:19] and goats, the Holy Ghost wasn't given
[1:23:20] yet. When he came down, his countenance
[1:23:23] was so changed
[1:23:25] that his face lit
[1:23:28] up and he had to wear a veil over his
[1:23:32] face. As long as Moses was preaching the
[1:23:36] was giving them the word, he he was
[1:23:38] acting like God. I'm about to read you a
[1:23:40] quote. And he had to veil his face
[1:23:44] because of the glory that he was in.
[1:23:46] That's right. Remember, God is always
[1:23:49] veiled.
[1:23:52] prophets. You can read that. We're I'm
[1:23:54] going to skip over for the sake of time,
[1:23:55] but in Exodus chap chapter 34,
[1:23:58] prophets are deity veiled.
[1:24:02] That's right. That's a quote of your
[1:24:03] prophet. Prophets are deity
[1:24:07] veiled. But you know, our prophet said
[1:24:10] that when you put the word of God upon
[1:24:11] your lips in faith that you're also
[1:24:14] deity speaking. Right?
[1:24:16] See, it's not about you or this flesh.
[1:24:20] It's about the word that's coming forth.
[1:24:24] If you hear a minister preach and you
[1:24:27] don't receive it like it's the word of
[1:24:28] the Lord, it does this much good for
[1:24:30] you. That's right.
[1:24:32] If you take it as the preacher's
[1:24:34] opinion, they're criticizing me.
[1:24:37] Somebody told them I did that. Somebody
[1:24:40] said this, you'll get zero value. But
[1:24:42] when you say, "Lord, that's you speaking
[1:24:45] to me." Then you draw something out of
[1:24:48] it. You come here for prayer. We pray
[1:24:51] for you if you don't mix it with your
[1:24:54] own faith. There it is.
[1:24:58] Good, buddy.
[1:25:00] It takes faith.
[1:25:02] There's no good in any one of us, but
[1:25:04] it's who we represent.
[1:25:07] Because remember, they were accusing one
[1:25:08] of the big things they had against Jesus
[1:25:10] is, "You make yourself God.
[1:25:13] He was. But look, he still gave them the
[1:25:15] scripture and said, "Don't the law even
[1:25:17] say that ye are gods if the word of God
[1:25:20] came to him?" Now look, look, let me
[1:25:22] read this real fast. The unveiling of
[1:25:23] God. Moses is coming from the presence
[1:25:25] of God. He has been into the word. The
[1:25:27] word has been wrote and he in the
[1:25:29] presence of God with the word. He had
[1:25:31] the word for that age. There is a word
[1:25:34] for each age. And Moses coming forth,
[1:25:36] his face shines. So see the word was in
[1:25:38] him ready to be manifested. give out to
[1:25:41] the people the true word. God had wrote
[1:25:43] it and it was with Moses. Notice it was
[1:25:45] with Moses and was ready to be
[1:25:46] manifested. He was the word to them.
[1:25:53] He was the living word hid veiled
[1:25:56] himself. Moses had to put a veil over
[1:25:58] his own face. Why? He was that word.
[1:26:02] That's right.
[1:26:04] Well, I thought Moses was a man with a
[1:26:05] temper. And I I thought Moses lied. I
[1:26:08] thought he even killed somebody. I
[1:26:09] heard. Come on.
[1:26:16] Until that word was made known, Moses
[1:26:18] had avail himself. Amen. He said Moses
[1:26:20] had the word. Now remember, after the
[1:26:22] word was made manifest, Moses was Moses
[1:26:25] again.
[1:26:27] Amen.
[1:26:29] When he's got the word, when a prophet
[1:26:31] has thus sayaith the Lord, they're
[1:26:32] representing God to us. We receive the
[1:26:36] word. Isn't this message thus sayaeth
[1:26:38] the Lord? Amen. Not thus sayaith William
[1:26:40] Brandham or thus sayaith this person and
[1:26:42] that person. It is thus sayaeth the
[1:26:45] Lord. So how can we and our our faith in
[1:26:49] that is what allows us by the Holy Ghost
[1:26:51] to live overcoming lives.
[1:26:55] 50 60 years. Well goodness it's been
[1:26:58] longer than that. I can't even do the
[1:26:59] math in my head. But it's been a long
[1:27:01] time since he's been gone. Right.
[1:27:06] But yet this message still holds you.
[1:27:10] How and why is because it's thus sayeth
[1:27:13] the Lord.
[1:27:15] So when when the prophet would step into
[1:27:17] the pull pit and he he just had a he
[1:27:19] just had a visitation of an angel and
[1:27:21] here he comes and he's preaching the
[1:27:22] seals or he's preaching God and
[1:27:23] simplicity or it doesn't matter. He then
[1:27:26] has the word of the Lord.
[1:27:29] But then when on the way home or you
[1:27:31] know next day you can go fishing with
[1:27:32] him and he's William Brandham again.
[1:27:37] Don't let that stumble you.
[1:27:41] Because remember you God was veiled. It
[1:27:44] was a son of man revealing the son of
[1:27:46] man.
[1:27:48] He needed a new birth like we all do.
[1:27:50] That's right. That's right. He was born
[1:27:53] in sin, shaped in iniquities. He told
[1:27:55] lies. God had to deal with him. He made
[1:27:57] mistakes as a man. Moses made mistakes
[1:28:00] as a man. But there's no mistakes. See,
[1:28:02] Moses wrote most the foundation of the
[1:28:04] Old Testament. And there's no mistakes
[1:28:06] in it. That's right. But in Moses's
[1:28:10] personal life, there was mistakes. Come
[1:28:12] on. This message is thus sayeth the
[1:28:15] Lord. But in brother Aram's own personal
[1:28:18] life, he was still human. That's right.
[1:28:22] So you had So So you see how people get
[1:28:25] in trouble. Then when they begin to die,
[1:28:26] they say, "Well, that was God. What? How
[1:28:27] much of it was God?
[1:28:32] Get next to yourself.
[1:28:38] Moses was Moses again. See, but while
[1:28:40] the word was in him to give out, he was
[1:28:43] God. Well, he wasn't Moses no more. Had
[1:28:46] the word of the Lord for that age.
[1:28:48] That's how powerful the word is.
[1:28:52] That is how powerful the word that you
[1:28:54] can be Messiah. Right.
[1:28:58] That you can confound the devil with
[1:29:01] your own voice, Sister Julia.
[1:29:05] Why? Because it's not you.
[1:29:08] When you fight your battles and I fight
[1:29:10] my battles and we take the word of God
[1:29:11] and put it on our lips. We're not doing
[1:29:13] the fight. We're We're fighting, but
[1:29:15] we're not. We didn't arm ourselves. He
[1:29:17] armed us. That's right. That's why we
[1:29:19] can defeat the devil. That's right. Let
[1:29:21] me move on. If anybody needs more
[1:29:23] clarification, go listen to the
[1:29:24] unveiling of God.
[1:29:26] Amen. Let me read this one, too. In
[1:29:29] 1951, a very popular quote, but let me
[1:29:31] just go through it real fast. Now, I'm
[1:29:33] just your brother by the grace of God.
[1:29:35] But when the angel of the Lord moves
[1:29:37] down, it becomes then a voice of God to
[1:29:40] you.
[1:29:43] He said, "Maybe I offended you by saying
[1:29:44] that. Forgive me, but I felt that might
[1:29:46] have been resented. But I am God's voice
[1:29:49] to you."
[1:29:50] Amen.
[1:29:53] Who was it that discerned the hearts of
[1:29:55] men with
[1:29:56] 100% accuracy?
[1:29:58] Not a man. Who was it that appeared on
[1:30:02] the banks of the Ohio River when he was
[1:30:03] baptized in the 17th person and in front
[1:30:06] of 500 witnesses? A voice spoke and a
[1:30:08] pillar of fire came down and said, "As
[1:30:10] John the Baptist was sent to forrun the
[1:30:11] first coming of Christ, you shall forrun
[1:30:14] the second coming of Christ." That's
[1:30:15] right. Who was it that appeared in the
[1:30:17] Houston Coliseum and had his picture
[1:30:19] taken with the prophet? Who was it that
[1:30:22] stood in a man just about five foot
[1:30:25] tall, maybe a couple inches, and said,
[1:30:26] "I take every spirit under here under my
[1:30:29] control for the glory of God." A man
[1:30:32] can't do that.
[1:30:37] Who was it that opened that preached
[1:30:40] rather the seven seals that was contrary
[1:30:43] to every Bible teacher of the day?
[1:30:45] Contrary to even his own human way of
[1:30:47] thinking, right?
[1:30:50] Who said why I'm against organized
[1:30:52] religion?
[1:30:55] Was it Brother Brandon that was against
[1:30:56] organized religion or was it God? Come
[1:31:00] on.
[1:31:02] Who's really against organized religion?
[1:31:05] That's right.
[1:31:06] Who is this Melzdc?
[1:31:13] It was deity veiled in the flesh of a
[1:31:15] prophet.
[1:31:19] We're not feeding on the mind of a man,
[1:31:22] brothers and sisters.
[1:31:24] We're feeding on the body word of the
[1:31:26] son of man.
[1:31:29] Now remember I mentioned them cherubams
[1:31:32] around that tree of life. Whenever the
[1:31:33] tabernacle of witness was set up, there
[1:31:35] were four cherubams set up. There were
[1:31:36] the 12 tribes of Israel set up. Four on
[1:31:39] the north, four on the south, east and
[1:31:40] west. Three tribes in each direction.
[1:31:44] And
[1:31:44] each group of three tribes were under a
[1:31:47] banner. And there was a lion, the ox,
[1:31:51] the man, and the eagle. That's right.
[1:31:53] And that was their cherubams that was
[1:31:55] protecting the mercy seat. That's right.
[1:31:58] Amen. Now, all of
[1:32:01] that all of everything that we've just
[1:32:04] been preaching and sharing on about the
[1:32:05] mercy seat and the blood and sprinkling
[1:32:07] seven times and and the live goat and
[1:32:09] and and the goat that was killed and the
[1:32:11] bullock and and and Aaron had to be
[1:32:13] dressed a certain way and anointed and
[1:32:14] walk a certain way and had bells on the
[1:32:17] on the hems of his garment so all of
[1:32:19] Israel would know that he's still alive.
[1:32:22] Because what good does it do if if a
[1:32:24] priest goes in to atone for your sins
[1:32:27] and he drops dead because he's not
[1:32:29] worthy?
[1:32:32] They had to know this man, this man's
[1:32:35] doing the work, right?
[1:32:37] My sins are going to be covered.
[1:32:41] We'll come back around to that in a
[1:32:43] minute. But the but the cherubams were
[1:32:45] all around it. All this was a all a
[1:32:48] beautiful
[1:32:49] type of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:32:52] Christ.
[1:32:54] He is the true mercy seat. Because
[1:32:58] remember even the ark was wood overlaid
[1:33:00] with gold. He was a man and deity.
[1:33:05] Now in the Old Testament, Scoffield
[1:33:07] picks this up and I think it's
[1:33:08] beautiful. But in the Old Testament, the
[1:33:09] veil was actually made of blue and
[1:33:11] purple scarlet and cherubams were even
[1:33:14] in embroidered on it. And Scoffield
[1:33:17] picks this up and said, "The blue is how
[1:33:18] Christ came from heaven. The purple is
[1:33:22] his royalty and red types his blood
[1:33:27] sacrifice." Every detail of that
[1:33:30] tabernacle of witness points to our Lord
[1:33:32] and Savior. Amen. when he was here on
[1:33:35] earth. You think the God of Mount Si,
[1:33:38] well, let's put it like that. The God of
[1:33:40] Mount Si that thundered forth that that
[1:33:43] that his holiness just terrified people
[1:33:47] came in a
[1:33:48] man, a meek man. He came in a
[1:33:50] tabernacle. See, the prophets were deity
[1:33:53] veil. Let me inject this real fast. The
[1:33:56] prophets were deity veil where they
[1:33:57] where they had the word of the Lord and
[1:33:59] they'd come and they'd preach the word
[1:34:00] and they' take the place of God. Look
[1:34:01] how Moses threw himself in the breach
[1:34:03] and he they pre and then he became Moses
[1:34:05] again. Isaiah one day he was Isaiah but
[1:34:07] then he said a virgin shall conceive.
[1:34:09] That wasn't Isaiah. But then they had
[1:34:12] they'd go back to their humanity. But
[1:34:13] this man right he was God from the very
[1:34:17] his first breath to his last. That's
[1:34:20] right. He didn't have well Jesus came
[1:34:23] and when he preached the word he was God
[1:34:24] but then he became Jesus again. He was
[1:34:27] always God. When he was sleeping he was
[1:34:29] God. When he was eating, he was God.
[1:34:31] When he was casting out devils, he was
[1:34:33] God.
[1:34:35] So one day there came, you remember, he
[1:34:37] sent the disciples forth with a with a
[1:34:39] with an anointed them to cast out
[1:34:40] devils. It wasn't he anointed them to do
[1:34:43] the work. And after their their
[1:34:45] ministry, they came back and they were
[1:34:46] rejoicing. And there was a man that came
[1:34:48] to Jesus in the book of Mark there and
[1:34:51] he was pretty upset because they brought
[1:34:53] in verse 20, Mark 9:20, and they brought
[1:34:57] unim, let me back up. In Mark 9:18, "And
[1:35:00] whethersoever he taketh him, he teareth
[1:35:02] him." This child had epilepsy, and he
[1:35:05] foamth and nashethth with his teeth, and
[1:35:06] pineth away. And I spoke, and I spake to
[1:35:08] thy disciples, and they should not that
[1:35:10] they could not that, excuse me, to thy
[1:35:12] disciples that they should cast him out,
[1:35:14] and they could not. He answered them,
[1:35:16] and said, "Oh faithless generation, how
[1:35:18] long shall I be with you? How long shall
[1:35:20] I suffer you? Bring him unto me." And
[1:35:23] they brought him unto him, and when he
[1:35:24] saw him, straightway the spirit tear
[1:35:26] him, and he fell on the ground and
[1:35:28] wallowed, foaming. And he asked his
[1:35:30] father, "How long is it a go since this
[1:35:33] came upon him?" And he said, "Of a
[1:35:35] child." And of times they have cast him
[1:35:37] into the fire and into the waters to
[1:35:39] destroy him. But if thou can't if thou
[1:35:41] can't do anything, have compassion on us
[1:35:43] and help us. Jesus said unto him, "If
[1:35:45] thou cast believe, all things are
[1:35:47] possible to them that believe." And
[1:35:50] straightway the father of the child
[1:35:51] cried out and said with tears, "Lord, I
[1:35:54] believe,
[1:35:56] help thou my unbelief."
[1:36:01] Look at the humility of that
[1:36:03] man. Lord, if you if there's any
[1:36:06] unbelief in my heart, you forgive me.
[1:36:11] Brother picks this story up and it's
[1:36:12] just
[1:36:14] beautiful. He said, "Now when this man
[1:36:16] looked in the face of Jesus, he was
[1:36:18] anointed. He was the anointed God. Here
[1:36:20] he was standing there, the anointed man,
[1:36:22] God in
[1:36:24] man. He said, "Have compassion on us."
[1:36:26] Now he's on the right grounds. He's
[1:36:28] coming on the grounds of pleading mercy.
[1:36:30] He's coming to the mercy seat. And
[1:36:32] that's the only way you'll ever get
[1:36:33] anything from God is come to the mercy
[1:36:36] seat. Not judgment, not upon self, but
[1:36:39] upon the mercies of God. And further and
[1:36:42] a little further down. And the father
[1:36:43] looked him in the face, said tears
[1:36:46] running down his cheek. Something had
[1:36:47] struck him. A change had come in his
[1:36:49] heart at that very moment. And he said,
[1:36:50] "Lord, I believe. Forgive me." So many
[1:36:54] words. Forgive me for my
[1:36:56] unbelief. All this time I've tried to
[1:36:58] believe the Pharisees. I've doubted when
[1:37:00] the disciples failed. Forgive me,
[1:37:03] Lord, of my unbelief. Amen. And with
[1:37:07] tears rolling down, the spirit of God
[1:37:09] has struck his heart and he said, "Lord,
[1:37:11] I believe. Forgive me of my unbelief."
[1:37:14] Or the Bible quotes it helped out my
[1:37:15] unbelief. But it's
[1:37:17] forgive my
[1:37:20] unbelief. There he stands. What was it?
[1:37:22] Now watch a few moments ago. He was sir
[1:37:24] if you can. But when Jesus caught his
[1:37:28] attention, it wasn't sir. Capital L O R
[1:37:30] D. What happened when he came when he
[1:37:34] come to the mercy seat? He found mercy.
[1:37:40] Everything was okay because he came to
[1:37:42] the mercy seat. Amen.
[1:37:44] What about that woman in St. John
[1:37:46] chapter
[1:37:47] 8? She was caught in adultery.
[1:37:52] A lot like the woman at the
[1:37:54] well. And you think here you have the
[1:37:57] God that gave the law to Moses. Amen.
[1:38:00] Come on, standing in
[1:38:02] flesh. And he's standing there, brother
[1:38:04] Matt. And all of a sudden there's a big
[1:38:06] ruckus. Right? And these priests are
[1:38:11] dragging this poor woman to Jesus.
[1:38:14] Right? They've got a trap laid for him.
[1:38:17] Right?
[1:38:19] It's a good one,
[1:38:21] too. Because here they said, "The law,
[1:38:23] Jesus, the law says that this woman was
[1:38:26] caught indulging in the very act. The
[1:38:27] the law says that we should stone her."
[1:38:29] What do you say?
[1:38:35] He wasn't on Mount Si that day.
[1:38:38] Come on. He was in a mercy seat.
[1:38:44] And he said, "The law I can show you,
[1:38:46] Jesus, the law says according to the the
[1:38:48] law of Moses that we've got to kill her
[1:38:50] right now."
[1:38:54] And here was the God of Moses.
[1:38:57] The God of the law. That's right. And he
[1:39:01] stood there.
[1:39:04] He knew what she did.
[1:39:07] But he just stopped. He started doing
[1:39:13] this. He didn't say a
[1:39:16] word. And then he told him, they
[1:39:18] continued asking him. He was writing.
[1:39:21] They said, "Jesus, what are you going to
[1:39:23] what are we going to do? Come on.
[1:39:26] The word says it. What are we going to
[1:39:27] do?" And he's sitting there and he's
[1:39:29] writing and the scripture says he stood
[1:39:31] up and he looked at the priest and he
[1:39:34] said, "You, he that is without sin, you
[1:39:37] cast the first stone."
[1:39:40] And he goes
[1:39:44] back and they still had enough of a
[1:39:46] conscience to realize what they
[1:39:49] did that morning, what they did last
[1:39:52] week, what they did the day before. And
[1:39:55] no doubt when Jesus looked him in the
[1:39:56] face and said, "He that's without sin
[1:39:58] cast the first stone."
[1:40:03] They knew. He knew. That's right.
[1:40:08] So they they had rocks. Boy, they were
[1:40:10] ready, brother Matt.
[1:40:13] Oh man, they were ready. And all of a
[1:40:15] sudden, maybe it was the eldest one,
[1:40:17] maybe the one that was most respected.
[1:40:18] All of a sudden, he just said dropped
[1:40:19] the rock and left.
[1:40:23] Well, man, he he's up there. I really
[1:40:25] respect him. If he has sin, then I
[1:40:27] better I better go, too.
[1:40:31] Thud thud, thud,
[1:40:34] thud. There was enough rocks in them
[1:40:36] people's hands to kill her.
[1:40:40] So, you can imagine whenever it was all
[1:40:42] said and done, rocks laying everywhere
[1:40:47] and Jesus is still standing there. Only
[1:40:50] her and him.
[1:40:52] Hallelujah. And he asks her a very
[1:40:56] beautiful question.
[1:40:59] He
[1:41:01] says,"Woman, where are those thine
[1:41:05] accusers? Hath no man condemned
[1:41:09] thee?" She was probably all crouched
[1:41:11] down waiting for a rock to hit her in
[1:41:13] the head at any moment.
[1:41:17] And she looks around and she sees nobody
[1:41:19] is
[1:41:20] there but the Lord
[1:41:24] Jesus. Woman, where are thine
[1:41:27] accusers? Bride,
[1:41:31] in your first birth, you've done a lot
[1:41:33] of stuff.
[1:41:36] But where are thine accusers?
[1:41:44] Where are they?
[1:41:47] And she said, "No man, Lord."
[1:41:52] Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I
[1:41:55] condemn thee."
[1:41:59] Go and sin no more.
[1:42:03] Here you have the God of heaven, the God
[1:42:04] that thundered on Mount Si.
[1:42:08] The God that told Moses, "If any animal,
[1:42:10] if any person even touches this
[1:42:12] mountain, they're to die immediately."
[1:42:14] Here you have him bottled up right in a
[1:42:17] man Christ
[1:42:18] Jesus a mercy
[1:42:21] seat and he tells this woman that was
[1:42:27] guilty go I'm not going to condemn you
[1:42:31] go and sin no more
[1:42:37] that was the same love and compassion
[1:42:39] that he had for Adam and Eve it broke
[1:42:41] his heart to send them out of the
[1:42:47] Bible says in Ephesians 2:4, "But God
[1:42:50] who is rich in
[1:42:52] mercy, for his love, great love,
[1:42:55] wherewith he loved us, even when we were
[1:42:57] dead in sins, hath quickened us together
[1:43:00] in Christ. By grace ye are saved."
[1:43:05] What about the woman that came to wash
[1:43:06] his feet
[1:43:09] when she whenever they invited him to
[1:43:10] the to the feast there just to make fun
[1:43:12] of him Simon's
[1:43:13] party? He knew what kind of woman she
[1:43:16] was, right? But he was a God of mercy.
[1:43:22] The God of mercy, the mercy seat that
[1:43:24] was in
[1:43:29] flesh. the the religious people were
[1:43:31] looking for any way they could betray
[1:43:33] him. How can we get this Jesus? And here
[1:43:36] you have Caiaphasis. He was the high
[1:43:38] priest. Think about
[1:43:40] this. When we read our text about how
[1:43:43] Aaron had to go in and how he had to to
[1:43:46] be and dress and and put the bells and
[1:43:48] be anointed and offer blood, that was
[1:43:51] Caiaphas's position for that year.
[1:43:54] That's right.
[1:43:56] And a man in that position was so
[1:43:59] blinded by religion
[1:44:02] that here stood the very mercy seat in
[1:44:06] his presence.
[1:44:09] On that day when they arrested Jesus,
[1:44:15] he was there and he was so blinded. He
[1:44:19] demanded that Jesus, he was accusing
[1:44:21] Jesus and he demanded that he give him
[1:44:23] an answer.
[1:44:27] and he was a high priest that year. The
[1:44:30] very blood that he was going to carry,
[1:44:32] the the blood of the animal that that he
[1:44:34] was going to carry and put seven
[1:44:36] stripes and the altar of incense and go
[1:44:39] behind the holiest of holies and and go
[1:44:41] and approach the ark of the covenant.
[1:44:43] That God was right before him, right?
[1:44:48] Bound, not saying anything.
[1:44:55] getting lied lied on
[1:44:59] then getting slapped,
[1:45:02] spit upon.
[1:45:06] He did so much damage when they had
[1:45:08] Jesus on that Good Friday.
[1:45:12] He did so much damage to Satan's
[1:45:14] kingdom. Satan couldn't wait to get his
[1:45:15] hands on him.
[1:45:19] And no doubt when them soldiers were
[1:45:20] beating
[1:45:22] them and they and because remember they
[1:45:24] turned Jewish law allows for 39
[1:45:28] stripes but you know Romans aren't under
[1:45:31] Jewish law so history don't know how
[1:45:33] many he got but there's no telling so if
[1:45:36] the Jewish law makes them stop at 39
[1:45:38] then that must be right before
[1:45:40] death. But they were beating Jesus with
[1:45:42] a cat of nine tails and they were
[1:45:44] beating Jesus with you. You you can go
[1:45:45] online and pull up pictures and and it's
[1:45:47] just unimaginable
[1:45:49] what that did to his flesh.
[1:45:52] And as they were beating him and beating
[1:45:54] him, no doubt the soldiers getting
[1:45:57] tired. But I can imagine, brother Joel,
[1:45:59] that Satan just because you know demonic
[1:46:01] forces, they can they can make people do
[1:46:03] some pretty superhuman stuff. Brother
[1:46:06] talked about a woman when he went to
[1:46:07] pray for her and she was like crawling
[1:46:08] like a spider on the wall. Right.
[1:46:14] And no doubt Satan endued them soldiers
[1:46:17] with superhuman demonic strength to keep
[1:46:19] beating him and beating him and beating
[1:46:23] him. But you know there was a scripture
[1:46:26] that that already said that he would be
[1:46:29] wounded for our transgressions.
[1:46:32] He would be bruised for our iniquities.
[1:46:34] The chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:46:36] him. And by them stripes Amen.
[1:46:41] I'm healed
[1:46:46] by them stripes, by that blood that was
[1:46:49] running down his leg. That was for my
[1:46:51] family. That was for your family. That
[1:46:55] was for your healing. That was for
[1:46:56] brother Ron's healing. Amen. That was
[1:46:58] for Sister Ber's healing. Healing.
[1:47:00] That's right.
[1:47:03] He sat there and he took it.
[1:47:09] But how little did Satan know that each
[1:47:12] stripe was paying for my salvation?
[1:47:18] How little did he know that what looked
[1:47:20] like such weakness, that's when the
[1:47:22] greatest victory came.
[1:47:25] And you'll find in your own personal
[1:47:27] life, that's how it is a lot. When you
[1:47:29] seem like you're the weakest, you're
[1:47:31] finally in a condition where God can
[1:47:32] move. That's right. When we, brother
[1:47:35] Jerry, reach our human capacity and
[1:47:37] we're done, right? We can't do it any
[1:47:41] longer.
[1:47:43] Good. That's when God can do something
[1:47:48] because remember, even believers, it
[1:47:50] wasn't Satan thought he had Jesus, but
[1:47:52] even believers try to stop the
[1:47:55] procession that day, right?
[1:47:59] As he was going up Goltha's Hill, as he
[1:48:02] was going them cobblestone streets, and
[1:48:03] as brother M dramatizes, the blood
[1:48:05] begins to run down his
[1:48:08] legs. Mary Magdalene runs out there and
[1:48:10] tries to stop it and say, "What? What?
[1:48:12] What has he
[1:48:13] done?" But healed your sick, right? She
[1:48:17] got smacked in the mouth.
[1:48:21] God had a plan and God had a purpose.
[1:48:25] All the angels watching
[1:48:28] breathlessly. They knew who Jesus was
[1:48:33] and they were watching, ready to move. I
[1:48:35] would imagine that they had their hands
[1:48:37] on their sword just wanting to to
[1:48:40] intervene, but they can't
[1:48:43] understand redemption. That's right.
[1:48:47] They were ready to intervene, but God
[1:48:49] was doing a work.
[1:48:52] walking up the streets of Jerusalem,
[1:48:54] bloody bald patches in his beard from
[1:48:57] getting pulled out,
[1:49:00] gobbs of spit just running down his
[1:49:03] face. As he was walking through that
[1:49:05] crowd, everyone that hated him, there
[1:49:07] were a lot of people there that did got
[1:49:09] their lick in, got their slap in, got
[1:49:13] their their spit
[1:49:15] in, and the God of Mount
[1:49:18] Si, if I can put it like that, came into
[1:49:22] a place where he became the mercy
[1:49:25] seat. And and as a God of mercy, he
[1:49:28] allowed himself to be subjected to that
[1:49:31] kind of punishment. Right?
[1:49:33] a beaten bloody mess. That's right.
[1:49:37] But that precious blood of God that was
[1:49:40] that ran through his veins, not the
[1:49:41] blood of Mary. Amen. Not the blood of
[1:49:45] any man. The blood of God that ran
[1:49:47] through his veins had to be shed.
[1:49:53] Why? Because he was at mercy seat.
[1:49:55] Right?
[1:49:56] Because just as there was seven stripes
[1:49:58] of blood on the mercy seat, there had to
[1:50:00] be the blood to cover the Gentiles.
[1:50:03] There had to be blood to cover all of
[1:50:05] humanity. But God was getting ready.
[1:50:06] Think he blinded his own children,
[1:50:10] mothers, fathers, imagine turning your
[1:50:14] back on your own children for somebody
[1:50:16] else's.
[1:50:23] When naturally speaking, we love our
[1:50:27] children more than anyone else in the
[1:50:30] world.
[1:50:32] Right.
[1:50:33] You love other people's children.
[1:50:35] Absolutely. You'd even give your lives
[1:50:36] for them. That's right. But when it's
[1:50:39] your own flesh and blood, it's your
[1:50:42] children, right, Brother Joel? It's
[1:50:45] yours. God gave them to you.
[1:50:49] So imagine you turning your back on
[1:50:52] them,
[1:50:54] them despising you and you knew it would
[1:50:57] be that way and you turned your back on
[1:50:59] them for children or people that didn't
[1:51:02] even care about you that were pagans
[1:51:04] that worshiped false gods and false
[1:51:06] idols, right? Gentiles carried away with
[1:51:09] diverse lust. But yet he blinded his own
[1:51:12] family, the Jewish nation, right?
[1:51:15] because he wanted to pull out a bride.
[1:51:21] I can't wrap my mind around it. I'm
[1:51:22] gonna be honest with you.
[1:51:27] I can't. But I'm human. But he did that.
[1:51:32] Amen.
[1:51:33] The blood of God has got to be
[1:51:36] spilled. Had to be spilled.
[1:51:40] Brother Man preached a profound
[1:51:42] message called the indictment. He took
[1:51:46] one verse
[1:51:49] and when they came to the place which is
[1:51:51] called Calvary there they crucified him.
[1:51:54] That's right. And he preaches for about
[1:51:56] two hours on there the most holy place.
[1:52:01] They the most holy people crucified the
[1:52:04] most horrible death him the most holy
[1:52:07] person. Amen. That's right. And while
[1:52:09] they were doing that the mercy seat was
[1:52:12] pinned to the cross. And what did he
[1:52:13] say?
[1:52:15] Father,
[1:52:16] forgive them.
[1:52:21] He had blood running.
[1:52:24] He was looking at them through the
[1:52:25] blood.
[1:52:28] But them eyes won't always have blood in
[1:52:30] it, brothers and sisters.
[1:52:35] But he's still a mediator
[1:52:39] tonight. And he died there forsaken by
[1:52:42] man and God.
[1:52:44] hung between heaven and
[1:52:49] earth. And he cried out, "My God, my
[1:52:51] God, why hast thou forsaken me?" And
[1:52:54] when he cried again with a loud voice,
[1:52:56] yielded up the ghost, "Behold, the veil
[1:52:58] of the temple was ran in twain from the
[1:53:00] top to the
[1:53:02] bottom." Now, we can we read over this
[1:53:05] verse pretty easy, but let me give you
[1:53:07] some details.
[1:53:11] This temple veil was not just a bed
[1:53:14] sheet hanging there.
[1:53:18] Historians and historians say that the
[1:53:21] height of that veil was 60 feet
[1:53:26] tall. One story is 10 feet
[1:53:29] tall. So that's six stories. Could you
[1:53:34] imagine
[1:53:35] sixtory tall
[1:53:39] veil? The width was 30
[1:53:44] feet and the thickness was 4
[1:53:49] in. It is said to be so thick and heavy
[1:53:52] that horses tied to each end could not
[1:53:54] pull it apart.
[1:53:56] That is the the the size and the
[1:53:59] magnitude of this
[1:54:01] veil that was rent from the top all the
[1:54:04] way to the bottom. You talk about
[1:54:05] supernatural.
[1:54:07] You talk about a supernatural
[1:54:08] occurrence. When he said it is finished
[1:54:11] and when that temple veil was rent, what
[1:54:13] did it expose? What did it show? When
[1:54:15] the temple veil was what was hid the
[1:54:18] holy place, the holiest of holies, when
[1:54:20] it ran, it showed Jesus Christ, God's
[1:54:23] mercy seat on the cross. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:26] That was the whole purpose of the split
[1:54:28] is to see that God does not now dwell
[1:54:30] here. That's his mercy seat. Amen. And
[1:54:33] the day that Jesus said, "It is
[1:54:35] finished." That
[1:54:36] moment it became God did not accept that
[1:54:40] form of worship anymore.
[1:54:43] The blood of bulls and goats was over.
[1:54:46] That's right. And God rent the
[1:54:49] veil and there you got God's mercy seat.
[1:54:52] Christ.
[1:54:55] And one of the
[1:54:57] soldiers fulfilling the scriptures, but
[1:55:00] they're all anointed by the devil to
[1:55:01] crucify Jesus Christ. He gets a
[1:55:12] spear and he looks up at
[1:55:15] him and he gets his spear point.
[1:55:19] of all the men he might have stabbed in
[1:55:23] battle, there wasn't one like this one.
[1:55:29] And he puts that spear right up to his
[1:55:31] that spear point and he shoves it in his
[1:55:36] side and out of his
[1:55:39] side came the elements of a new birth.
[1:55:42] Hallelujah.
[1:55:45] water and blood and the spirit went back
[1:55:49] up to God. Amen. That was the mercy
[1:55:54] seat. The veil, the flesh, you had the
[1:55:57] mercy seat of Jesus on the cross. But
[1:56:01] even more than that, when that soldier
[1:56:03] stuck that spear and gave out the
[1:56:05] elements for my new birth, for your new
[1:56:07] birth,
[1:56:09] that's the veil of his flesh being rent
[1:56:13] so you can have access to mercy. Amen.
[1:56:16] Yes, Lord.
[1:56:20] So he can then forgive you. Your faith
[1:56:22] in that gives you justification. That's
[1:56:25] right.
[1:56:28] He said, "It's
[1:56:30] finished." The veil was rent at Calvary
[1:56:33] and the mercy seat came in plain
[1:56:40] view. Soon after that, just 35, 40 years
[1:56:43] after
[1:56:44] that, Rome came in, right? And what did
[1:56:48] they do? Whenever them Jews, remember
[1:56:51] Jesus said, "When you see the
[1:56:52] abomination that make ath desolation
[1:56:53] come around the holy place, flee."
[1:56:57] And they begin to rebel against Rome and
[1:57:00] Rome. The Titus Titus came. And he came
[1:57:04] and and and besieged Jerusalem. What did
[1:57:06] they do? Run in the temple. When that
[1:57:08] temple veil was rent, they either
[1:57:09] replaced it, they swed it. I don't know
[1:57:10] what they did, but they went back to Old
[1:57:13] Testament worship.
[1:57:15] They filled the temple. They prayed,
[1:57:17] "God, deliver us. Deliver us." And every
[1:57:19] one of them died.
[1:57:22] Mercy was over for them because they
[1:57:24] rejected the mercy seat.
[1:57:28] When the bride I'm running out of time,
[1:57:30] so I' I've got to go fast. When the
[1:57:32] bride leaves the earth, right? Mercy for
[1:57:36] the Gentiles goes up with her.
[1:57:39] And when the tribulation hits, what are
[1:57:41] they going to do? Fill the churches. God
[1:57:42] deliver us. God bless America. God
[1:57:44] deliver us. But mercy will be over.
[1:57:47] Amen.
[1:57:48] Why? Because they rejected the message,
[1:57:50] they rejected the mercy that was sent to
[1:57:52] them. That's right.
[1:57:54] Just like they rejected Jesus Christ and
[1:57:57] then run into the temple and sacrifice
[1:58:00] and God deliver us. God deliver us. The
[1:58:02] God of Moses, where are you? They
[1:58:04] crucify the God of Moses. The God of
[1:58:06] Moses was now living in in and
[1:58:08] disciples.
[1:58:10] 50 days later, he goes on the day of
[1:58:12] Pentecost and and indwells them. Amen.
[1:58:16] The mercy seat is Christ Jesus in our
[1:58:19] heart. You think about
[1:58:21] this. The mercy seat is Jesus
[1:58:25] Christ. So if you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:58:27] the mercy seat is now in you.
[1:58:35] He says this in the basis of fellowship.
[1:58:38] He talks about anointed and about
[1:58:39] hearing the bells. And he says, "Oh, how
[1:58:43] their hearts long to go in there, holy,
[1:58:45] holy, holy unto the Lord and know what
[1:58:48] it did to Aaron. Oh, he lived from year
[1:58:51] to year to go in,
[1:58:54] brother Dave." When Aaron went in and he
[1:58:56] experienced the shakina
[1:58:59] glory, he couldn't go back in until a
[1:59:02] year later on the day of atonement.
[1:59:04] Right? And no doubt people would would
[1:59:07] come to
[1:59:08] Aaron, most blessed priest, high priest,
[1:59:12] what does it feel like to go in there?
[1:59:17] What does it feel like to go into the
[1:59:19] shakina glory and the pillar of fire
[1:59:21] come down over that mercy seat when you
[1:59:23] offered
[1:59:25] blood and and God accepted
[1:59:28] it? What was that like? and Aaron could
[1:59:32] say,
[1:59:32] "Oh, it's so wonderful."
[1:59:36] I could stay there all the time.
[1:59:40] I left I you know, one time I put my rod
[1:59:42] in there, I left it in there. It was a
[1:59:44] dead stick I had for years. And when I
[1:59:47] went back to get it, it had blossomed.
[1:59:49] It had made albums. It had made almonds.
[1:59:52] The whole
[1:59:53] cycle had had come out right there in a
[1:59:56] dead a dead stick.
[1:59:59] It's so wonderful. I can't wait to go
[2:00:02] back in. Amen. And we get to experience
[2:00:05] it every day.
[2:00:08] The presence that's even here now
[2:00:12] is what they could only experience in a
[2:00:14] measure in the holiest of holies.
[2:00:20] What a blessed people that we are. Amen.
[2:00:23] We can enjoy his shakana glory each and
[2:00:26] every day.
[2:00:34] My
[2:00:37] goodness. He said, "Now, how appropriate
[2:00:40] it is now, showing that Jerusalem was
[2:00:42] ceasing when it was in effect until that
[2:00:45] hour. The blood of the lamb was right,
[2:00:48] all right, until that day. But now, at
[2:00:51] the crucifixion, it changes."
[2:00:55] Now think we're at the second
[2:00:57] crucifixion of Jesus
[2:00:59] Christ. Listen to an
[2:01:02] indictment. Jesus Christ came
[2:01:04] manifested. He did the same works that
[2:01:06] he did. They're not nailing They're not
[2:01:08] nailing anybody to a cross. How do they
[2:01:09] crucify him? From the church pull pits.
[2:01:11] Don't go and listen to William Brandon.
[2:01:12] That's right. The miracles were okay,
[2:01:15] but when they watch his doctrine,
[2:01:17] they're still doing it now. That's
[2:01:18] right. The miracles are okay. And and
[2:01:21] they'll draw certain things they like
[2:01:22] from certain sermons. They won't say
[2:01:24] where they got it from or the
[2:01:25] inspiration from or yeah, the miracle is
[2:01:27] okay, but watch that serpent seed or you
[2:01:29] wash that wash that predestination. No,
[2:01:31] no, no, no. We don't we don't take that.
[2:01:33] They're crucifying the word.
[2:01:39] And he said, "And the day that the
[2:01:40] denomination crucified the word and
[2:01:43] accepted a creed instead of the word,
[2:01:45] that's the day the word come into full
[2:01:47] effect." That's just been
[2:01:51] recently. God now requires the
[2:01:54] token. He requires the
[2:01:57] token. He requires baptism in the name
[2:02:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:02:04] Because the seals have opened the
[2:02:06] book. Remember the
[2:02:08] cherubams that were guarding the way of
[2:02:11] the tree of
[2:02:12] life until Jesus
[2:02:15] came. And now in the New Testament after
[2:02:18] the Holy Ghost, they're now driving the
[2:02:22] elect to the tree of life.
[2:02:24] What is what what is John being told by
[2:02:26] the cherubams in the book of Revelation?
[2:02:28] Come and see.
[2:02:30] Come and see. That's right.
[2:02:33] Because remember the cherubams protected
[2:02:35] the cherubams are are Matthew, Mark,
[2:02:37] like the New Testament type, Matthew,
[2:02:39] Mark, Luke, and John. They protect the
[2:02:41] book of Acts. Amen.
[2:02:44] That's why the denominations can't get
[2:02:46] over Matthew 28:19. Go ye therefore
[2:02:48] baptize all nations. But Peter said in
[2:02:50] the book of Acts, Acts 2:38, which one
[2:02:52] is it? It's a cherubam. But to you, he's
[2:02:55] showing you come and see. Whereas before
[2:02:57] it was a flaming sword to stay away
[2:03:00] now. He's pulling you. Come on. Come and
[2:03:02] see. Come back to the tree of life.
[2:03:06] That's good.
[2:03:10] I'm out of time.
[2:03:13] Well, just can you give me five more
[2:03:15] minutes?
[2:03:22] Trying to get to my five minute. See if
[2:03:24] I can find my five minute mark on
[2:03:26] here. I don't have
[2:03:33] one. It took a second crucifixion to
[2:03:36] rent the
[2:03:37] veil to reveal Jesus Christ, the mercy
[2:03:40] seat.
[2:03:42] The second crucifixion, rent the veil.
[2:03:44] Throughout all the seven out of seven
[2:03:45] church ages, men were putting their word
[2:03:47] above God's word. And what what did God
[2:03:49] say? He said, "I'll spew you out of my
[2:03:51] mouth."
[2:03:52] There was a veil that hid is he three.
[2:03:55] What what's going on? And throughout all
[2:03:57] the church ages, people were getting all
[2:03:58] mixed up. But this is end time. He sent
[2:04:02] a message and it tore the veil.
[2:04:07] There was a a book, the book of life,
[2:04:09] sealed with seven
[2:04:11] seals, everything out from beneath it.
[2:04:13] Now, God requires the token,
[2:04:17] the token life of Jesus
[2:04:19] Christ. And you can imagine when the
[2:04:21] high priest went in there to offer that
[2:04:24] blood, all of Israel stood breathless,
[2:04:27] right? Was he
[2:04:29] accepted? Did he approach it with enough
[2:04:32] reverence? Right? Did he walk? as he
[2:04:35] walked, did he play holy holy unto the
[2:04:37] Lord?
[2:04:38] Because if that priest don't come out,
[2:04:40] then that means the the offering wasn't
[2:04:42] accepted.
[2:04:46] All of creation also stood breathlessly
[2:04:48] one
[2:04:49] day when a call was made said, "Who is
[2:04:53] worthy to open the book?"
[2:04:56] Who is
[2:04:57] worthy? No man was worthy. So John began
[2:05:00] to weep.
[2:05:03] Do you know what was proof that God
[2:05:05] accepted their
[2:05:07] offering was when the priest came back
[2:05:09] out?
[2:05:11] And when the priest came back out, you
[2:05:13] could you could release the pressure. My
[2:05:16] sins are covered. Hallelujah.
[2:05:20] Could you put up that cloud picture?
[2:05:25] What's this a picture of?
[2:05:29] Proof that he came out. Right? Proof
[2:05:32] that the high priest has emerged, that
[2:05:35] he was worthy to open the book. Right?
[2:05:38] See, that's a sign of mercy. A rise and
[2:05:41] shine. Thy light has come. But to the
[2:05:42] world, it's judgment.
[2:05:45] But to you, it's peace. It's shalom.
[2:05:48] It's mercy. We love that. We're drawn to
[2:05:50] that. Amen. Because it's the revelation
[2:05:53] of Jesus Christ.
[2:05:56] The high priest has emerged because he's
[2:05:57] worthy.
[2:06:02] Aren't you so thankful tonight?
[2:06:08] Let's read Hebrews chapter 9 in
[2:06:11] closing. Paul's going over the same
[2:06:14] thing, the mercy seat.
[2:06:17] In chapter 9 19, for when Moses had
[2:06:19] spoken every precept to all the people
[2:06:21] according to the law, he took the blood
[2:06:23] of calavs and of goats and with water
[2:06:24] and scarlet wool and hissup and
[2:06:26] sprinkled both the book and all the
[2:06:27] people, saying, "This is the blood of
[2:06:29] the testament which God hath enjoined
[2:06:30] unto you. Moreover, he sprinkled with
[2:06:33] blood both the tabernacle and all the
[2:06:34] vessels of the ministry. And almost all
[2:06:37] things are by the law purged with blood,
[2:06:39] and without the shedding of blood is no
[2:06:40] remission. It was therefore necessary
[2:06:43] that the patterns of things in heavens
[2:06:45] and the heavens should be purified with
[2:06:47] these, but the heavenly things
[2:06:48] themselves with better sacrifices than
[2:06:50] these. For Christ is not entered into
[2:06:53] the holy place made with hands, which
[2:06:55] are the figures of the true, but into
[2:06:58] heaven
[2:06:59] itself now to appear in the presence of
[2:07:03] God for us. Amen. Hallelujah. When our
[2:07:07] Lord Jesus took tore these seals off
[2:07:09] this book, off the book of life, it was
[2:07:12] no no no tabernacle of witness made with
[2:07:14] hands. It was in heaven itself.
[2:07:18] And he emerged as the only one that was
[2:07:22] worthy. He is the real high priest.
[2:07:26] All the men, they were they were they
[2:07:27] were they were blessed of God in their
[2:07:28] own respective way. They were types and
[2:07:31] shadows. They were acting in the place
[2:07:33] of Christ until he came. Amen. God bless
[2:07:36] you tonight. Let's stand on our feet.
[2:07:37] Musicians can come.
[2:07:48] In the last
[2:07:49] day, this is when Jesus was on the
[2:07:52] earth, the great day of the
[2:07:55] feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
[2:07:59] "If any man thirst, let him come unto me
[2:08:02] and
[2:08:03] drink. He that believeth on me, as the
[2:08:07] scripture hath said, out of his belly
[2:08:10] shall flow rivers of living water."
[2:08:12] Amen.
[2:08:15] In Revelations 21:5, "And he that sat
[2:08:17] upon the throne said,"Behold, I make all
[2:08:19] things new." And he said unto me,
[2:08:21] "Write, for these words are true and
[2:08:23] faithful." And he said unto me, "It is
[2:08:27] done." Aren't you thankful? It is done.
[2:08:30] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and
[2:08:32] the end. I will give unto him that is a
[2:08:34] thirst of the fountain of water of life
[2:08:38] freely.
[2:08:40] The God who is rich in
[2:08:44] mercy. What are what what is our hearts
[2:08:48] holding? The mercy seat veiled behind
[2:08:52] flesh.
[2:08:56] Soon God is going to turn from us
[2:09:00] Gentiles to the Jews. That's right.
[2:09:03] Right. That's a that's an a reality.
[2:09:08] Whenever Jesus was on the earth, they
[2:09:10] couldn't imagine. They looked down on
[2:09:11] the
[2:09:12] Gentiles. They could not
[2:09:14] imagine God going to the Gentiles.
[2:09:20] But he did. He blinded his own children
[2:09:23] for
[2:09:25] that. Last quote, Brother Ram said, "But
[2:09:28] you see in this book what was redeemed.
[2:09:30] It was the book of redemption. And
[2:09:32] everything that he had redeemed was
[2:09:34] written in that book. All that he died
[2:09:36] for was written in that book. And he
[2:09:38] could not leave his mediatorial seat
[2:09:40] until he had thoroughly redeemed.
[2:09:44] And he couldn't redeem it at the cross
[2:09:46] because they were predestinated in the
[2:09:47] lamb's book of life. He had to stay on
[2:09:49] there to make intercession until the
[2:09:51] last person was finished. Glory. He
[2:09:56] says he's going to remain on that mercy
[2:09:59] seat until the last one. He's not
[2:10:01] leaving one. That's right. You think of
[2:10:04] what he did on Good Friday 2,000 years
[2:10:07] ago. But you know, Brother Tom, if you
[2:10:10] would have been the only one that needed
[2:10:12] it, right? He would have done it.
[2:10:17] The only one. He would have went through
[2:10:18] every stripe. He would have went through
[2:10:20] every agony for one person. That's
[2:10:22] right.
[2:10:24] That's my God. That's the God of mercy
[2:10:27] that I serve.
[2:10:31] A song has been on our heart on my heart
[2:10:33] this week and I just want to read the
[2:10:34] lyrics because I can't sing the lyrics
[2:10:37] but brother Isaiah Brooks used to always
[2:10:38] sing this song mercy said
[2:10:42] no mercy is a person
[2:10:47] the tree of life is a
[2:10:51] person they said mercy said
[2:10:54] no I'm not going to let you
[2:10:57] go I'm not going to let you slip away.
[2:11:00] You don't have to be
[2:11:02] afraid. Mercy said,
[2:11:04] "No." Sin will never take
[2:11:08] control. Life and death stood face to
[2:11:11] face. Darkness tried to steal my heart
[2:11:14] away. But thank you, Jesus. Mercy said
[2:11:17] no. And now when heaven looks at me,
[2:11:20] it's through the blood of Jesus,
[2:11:22] reminding me of one day long ago that
[2:11:25] mercy said no.
[2:11:31] brother and sister, if you don't know
[2:11:32] him as your Lord and
[2:11:35] Savior, I would say get in as quick as
[2:11:39] you can. That's right.
[2:11:42] Because remember that with the God of
[2:11:43] Sinai, whenever the the the God that
[2:11:46] came down, he came in Jesus Christ as a
[2:11:48] mercy seat. When he stands there at the
[2:11:51] white throne
[2:11:53] judgment, there'll be no mercy. That's
[2:11:55] right. You say, "What about the people
[2:11:57] that that will go in because they were
[2:11:59] good to the bride?" And we know that
[2:12:00] there's a class of people that God
[2:12:03] allows to enter into eternal life. They,
[2:12:05] brother Matt, they already did what they
[2:12:07] did. That's right. They were already
[2:12:09] good to you. They already ministered to
[2:12:12] you while there was still mercy. And God
[2:12:15] just took record of it. On the day of
[2:12:18] judgment, it ain't going to do no good
[2:12:19] to say, "Let me do you're you're the
[2:12:20] bride. Let me do something for you.
[2:12:23] Everyone that's holy will be holy still.
[2:12:25] Everyone that's filthy will be filthy
[2:12:27] still.
[2:12:30] Get into this word.
[2:12:33] Get covered by the blood of Jesus
[2:12:36] Christ. If you're covered by the blood,
[2:12:39] thank him for it. Let us live a life of
[2:12:43] thanksgiving, a a life of gratitude and
[2:12:46] thankfulness that God, you came and you
[2:12:49] gave your
[2:12:51] life. so I could enjoy your mercy, so I
[2:12:54] can have your life. You came and took my
[2:12:57] sin of my humanity so that I can partake
[2:13:00] of your godliness.
[2:13:02] What a blessed savior that we have. God
[2:13:04] bless you tonight, saints. Brother
[2:13:09] Matt, I was just in
[2:13:13] child when I felt my savior leading.
[2:13:19] I was drawn to what I could
[2:13:23] not
[2:13:28] understand. And for the cause of
[2:13:32] Christ, I have spent my days
[2:13:36] [Music]
[2:13:38] believing that what he'd have me be is
[2:13:44] who I am.
[2:13:47] [Music]
[2:13:49] And as I come to see the weaker side of
[2:13:59] me. Oh, I
[2:14:01] realize his grace is what I need.
[2:14:10] sins a man did
[2:14:13] justice for my
[2:14:17] soul. Mercy said
[2:14:22] no. Oh, I'm not going to let you
[2:14:27] go. Oh, I'm not going to let you slip
[2:14:32] away. You don't have to be afraid.
[2:14:38] Mercy said
[2:14:42] no. Sin will never take
[2:14:47] control. Life and death stood face to
[2:14:52] face and darkness tried to steal my
[2:14:57] heart
[2:15:01] away. Thank you
[2:15:05] Jesus. mercy said
[2:15:09] [Music]
[2:15:13] no. God so loved the
[2:15:17] world that he sent his son to save
[2:15:22] us. From the cross he built a bridge to
[2:15:28] set us free.
[2:15:34] But deep within our
[2:15:37] hearts there is still a war that
[2:15:43] rages and makes a
[2:15:47] sacrifice so hard to see.
[2:15:55] It's midnight fair on
[2:15:59] crucif
[2:16:04] day. The light of hope. It seems so far
[2:16:14] away. Has he tried to stop redemption?
[2:16:20] the
[2:16:22] Lord. Mercy said
[2:16:27] no. Oh, I'm not going to let you
[2:16:32] go. Oh, I'm not going to let you slip
[2:16:37] away. You don't have to be
[2:16:42] afraid. Mercy said no.
[2:16:48] Sin will never take
[2:16:52] control. Will life and death stood face
[2:16:57] to face and darkness try to steal my
[2:17:02] heart
[2:17:05] [Music]
[2:17:07] away. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Oh, let's
[2:17:10] sing that again. Mercy said
[2:17:15] no. Oh, I'm not going to let you
[2:17:21] go. Oh, I'm not going to let you slip
[2:17:26] away. Oh, you don't have to be
[2:17:31] brave. Well, mercy said
[2:17:36] no. S will never take control.
[2:17:42] Life and dance to face to
[2:17:46] face and darkness try to steal my heart
[2:17:52] away.
[2:17:54] [Music]
[2:18:05] Oh, aren't you so glad of that this
[2:18:07] evening
[2:18:08] that he would send his only begotten
[2:18:10] son?
[2:18:13] to save a wretch like me.
[2:18:17] Sing a song. Jesus, I love you because
[2:18:19] you care.
[2:18:22] [Music]
[2:18:24] See, not because I'm being so
[2:18:30] faithful. Not because I've been so
[2:18:35] good. You always been there for me.
[2:18:41] to provide my every
[2:18:45] need. You were there when I was
[2:18:50] lonely. You there in all my
[2:18:58] pain guiding my
[2:19:03] footsteps, shelter from the
[2:19:09] rain. And it was
[2:19:13] you who made my life
[2:19:18] complete who you are to be my
[2:19:24] everything and that is why I sing.
[2:19:33] Jesus, I love
[2:19:37] you because you
[2:19:42] care. I couldn't
[2:19:48] imagine if you were in there.
[2:19:52] [Music]
[2:19:55] Jesus, I love
[2:19:57] [Music]
[2:19:59] you. And because you
[2:20:05] care, I couldn't
[2:20:10] imagine if you were
[2:20:15] there. Oh, you are the joy of my
[2:20:21] salvation.
[2:20:24] You're the peace in my
[2:20:28] storm. Your loving arms protect
[2:20:34] me. Shelter me
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:39] from. Oh, you are
[2:20:42] [Music]
[2:20:44] al the
[2:20:47] beginning and the end.
[2:20:52] Oh my strong
[2:20:56] tower,
[2:20:59] dearest best
[2:21:03] friend. And it was
[2:21:07] you who made my life
[2:21:13] complete. You are to me my everything.
[2:21:20] And that is
[2:21:22] why you
[2:21:26] see Jesus I love
[2:21:32] you because you
[2:21:37] care. I couldn't
[2:21:43] imagine if you were right there.
[2:21:49] Oh Jesus, I love you. I love
[2:21:54] you. Jesus, I love you. I love
[2:21:59] you. Oh Jesus, I love you. I love
[2:22:05] you. Oh, because you
[2:22:10] care. Oh Jesus, I love you. I love you.
[2:22:17] Jesus, I love you. I love
[2:22:22] you. Jesus, I love you. I love
[2:22:28] you. Because you care. One more time.
[2:22:31] Jesus, I love you. And Jesus, I love
[2:22:36] you. I love
[2:22:39] you. Jesus, I love you. I love you.
[2:22:45] He is the side of
[2:22:50] you. He calls
[2:22:56] you. Aren't you so thankful for him this
[2:23:00] evening? Do you just love him? Can you
[2:23:02] lift your hand and say, "Lord, I thank
[2:23:04] you for that blood, that shed blood on
[2:23:07] Calvary,
[2:23:09] that all my sins are now
[2:23:11] gone." When all the scoffers may ask
[2:23:14] where they're at, I can say they're
[2:23:16] underneath the
[2:23:18] blood. Amen. As we prepare for tomorrow,
[2:23:21] I ask you that you'll just pray for
[2:23:23] me. God would just use me. Don't you
[2:23:27] just thank the Lord for what brother
[2:23:29] William spoke to us.
