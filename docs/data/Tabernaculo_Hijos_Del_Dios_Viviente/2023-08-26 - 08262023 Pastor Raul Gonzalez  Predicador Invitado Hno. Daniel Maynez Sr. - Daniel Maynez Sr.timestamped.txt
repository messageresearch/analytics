[49:07] we're waiting for a transformation
[49:11] but that transformation is coming
[49:16] we're not the same that we used to be
[49:20] since we accept the world
[49:22] we're being transformed
[49:27] but certainly like our brother said
[49:29] yesterday
[49:32] there's coming a transformation and a
[49:34] twinkling
[49:35] but that lady said
[49:38] I'm not what it used to be
[49:40] located
[49:45] I'm going from transformation to
[49:47] transformation
[49:49] now how many of you
[49:54] sometimes we feel like we are not worthy
[49:58] today is this morning
[50:01] I'm going to be the translator
[50:06] but I don't feel like the rest of the
[50:08] brothers
[50:10] and the preacher says oh I'm going to
[50:12] preach
[50:14] but I don't feel as clean like the rest
[50:23] so Brothers
[50:26] how many are ready to get into the world
[50:34] that plays on the heart of my brothers
[50:39] some of us we know from long time
[50:43] so here we are
[50:46] yes
[50:51] findings among us
[50:56] because we're going to be from millions
[50:58] and millions and millions foreign
[51:35] let's go into prayer
[51:42] foreign
[51:55] senior
[52:03] questions
[52:50] [Applause]
[53:02] we have a lot to talk about so let's go
[53:04] to Revelation chapter four
[53:06] a
[53:28] Toronto
[53:29] which the messenger entitled The Throne
[53:32] of judgment and mercy Los Angeles
[53:45] and we're going to be talking a little
[53:47] bit about the first four seals
[53:49] I hope to be brief
[53:52] salary
[53:59] let's read verse one
[54:02] is
[54:18] opening Heaven and the first ones which
[54:21] I heard was that they were over trumpet
[54:24] talking with me which said come up
[54:26] hither and I will show the things which
[54:28] must be hereafter
[54:33] you may be seated
[54:48] and I hope that we're able to break it
[54:51] down
[54:54] last night we heard a glorious message
[55:00] but you know you go to the restaurant
[55:03] and depends on the cook
[55:08] because the same means they don't taste
[55:10] the same
[55:14] um
[55:19] Evangelistic service to the world
[55:23] because God is a god of variety
[55:32] and process and helps servant
[55:40] foreign
[56:08] opens up
[56:11] and he hears a place that tells him
[56:18] and John the Apostle says
[56:26] behold after these things
[56:44] [Music]
[57:13] it's a church
[57:16] should I sit down
[57:19] or should I leave
[57:21] because he doesn't know anybody no
[57:23] foreign
[57:48] and he told him
[57:53] he didn't call my enemy he said friend
[57:57] how do you got in
[57:59] um
[58:01] your wedding garment
[58:03] s
[58:04] so there's some documented people over
[58:07] there he said and he realized
[58:13] that he got him somewhere
[58:16] but he didn't got him through the door
[58:19] because he was at the end
[58:22] so being invited it is an honor
[58:35] to see the things that he speaks up in
[58:38] types
[58:41] and bring them to the light of the
[58:43] revelation
[58:48] we simply are speaking again
[59:03] in reality Revelation chapter 4
[59:08] chapter written in symbols
[59:13] well not only Revelation 4.
[59:18] it's written in symbols
[59:22] to rebuild it
[59:24] people
[59:37] [Music]
[1:00:15] I am the door
[1:00:26] because there's windows
[1:00:30] there's a back door
[1:00:34] where did I get in
[1:00:37] English
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:46] but am I right that I entered
[1:00:56] Jesus Christ
[1:01:00] baptism of the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:03] Christ
[1:01:34] of Dominion
[1:01:36] the respecter of respect
[1:01:39] yes
[1:01:45] because it says
[1:01:56] because in verse 3 says
[1:02:16] something that is hard to hit
[1:02:20] because it is a stone
[1:02:22] and stone is out of Revelation even
[1:02:25] though and that's where we base apart
[1:02:39] foreign
[1:03:30] thank you
[1:03:33] Amigos
[1:03:37] he cannot catch this
[1:03:39] and why do I get it
[1:03:47] I'm just saying any employee
[1:03:51] why why did you get the word
[1:03:56] I get it by the Revelation that God gave
[1:03:58] us and
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:05] foreign
[1:04:50] foreign
[1:05:33] of this
[1:05:34] is
[1:05:46] the sons of Jacobs foreign
[1:06:19] on the airport
[1:06:22] and you find out that is Jasper
[1:06:27] the kennel supplies what does that
[1:06:29] speaks about yeah
[1:06:30] of Revelation 117.
[1:06:39] you're sorry
[1:06:40] I
[1:07:42] so how many understood the first stage
[1:07:50] and Benjamin is Jasper
[1:07:53] an apocalypses
[1:07:56] and Revelation chapter four
[1:08:00] there is a whole Revelation there
[1:08:04] is
[1:08:06] began to talk about colors
[1:08:13] with just representations
[1:08:36] foreign
[1:09:41] I just look at that and I say it is
[1:10:02] [Applause]
[1:10:06] and the next one that is very noticeable
[1:10:13] between red and yellow
[1:10:16] they produce Orange
[1:10:21] and then next to it is
[1:10:38] not when you go outside and you see the
[1:10:40] rainbow
[1:10:48] red orange yellow green blue
[1:10:51] persons
[1:11:00] every one of these colors belong to a
[1:11:02] person or a character
[1:11:04] like a distraction
[1:11:07] s
[1:11:10] have you ever
[1:11:22] it's an emerald
[1:11:29] it doesn't bring anything
[1:11:32] so the whole rainbow
[1:11:35] all together look like an emerald
[1:11:40] speaks about
[1:11:42] Judah
[1:11:51] who represents the tribe of Judah no
[1:11:55] this is
[1:11:59] because it is
[1:12:03] Jesus Christ
[1:12:11] the great lion
[1:12:29] a person
[1:12:42] god with me
[1:12:48] we're speaking about
[1:12:50] it
[1:12:52] but the kingdom has its Defenders
[1:12:59] but the Throne of God
[1:13:02] who does he defended against
[1:13:12] I'm gonna show you and we know that is
[1:13:15] speaking on Earth
[1:13:21] Guardians
[1:13:24] Defenders
[1:13:26] and vigilance Watchmen yes
[1:13:31] and in this time it's they're not accept
[1:13:36] you know that the book of Hebrews says
[1:13:46] shelter
[1:13:52] foreign
[1:14:15] we have so many people on the other side
[1:14:26] who are you about the throne
[1:14:31] or Guardians
[1:14:40] yes
[1:14:53] I was speaking with a person
[1:14:57] uh talking about the eet's ETC
[1:15:02] it is
[1:15:16] devil is not created
[1:15:18] if it's a living being president he's of
[1:15:21] God
[1:15:23] what happens if we haven't seen them
[1:15:27] we see a person with two eyes
[1:15:34] we would say
[1:15:39] horse three eyes
[1:15:42] and look it has four uh Four Hands
[1:15:45] foreign
[1:16:18] and point
[1:16:20] s
[1:16:25] in search of judgment
[1:16:27] and I do believe it
[1:16:30] and I wait and I'm waiting for them
[1:16:35] the prophet says
[1:16:45] government
[1:16:46] is
[1:16:50] my brother better has read it we have
[1:16:53] read our homes
[1:16:56] and our brother went to my house
[1:16:59] and I haven't written down
[1:17:02] I don't have him here because I'm not a
[1:17:04] computer
[1:17:05] I'm not a computer
[1:17:08] I pull up my my quotes and I tell them
[1:17:12] here says
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:17] he was wondering what are those things
[1:17:29] and we will leave
[1:17:38] but the messenger says
[1:17:42] when one of this comes down foreign
[1:18:03] foreign stops
[1:19:03] put the other one
[1:19:07] and you can walk around with two spoons
[1:19:09] and dances so then
[1:19:12] foreign
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:23] and he feels like he's burning up
[1:19:28] you know that they want to destroy
[1:19:30] Humanity
[1:19:33] how easy would they get rid of us yes
[1:19:38] in Hawaii and that happened lately
[1:19:42] people have to run to the Sea because
[1:19:46] they felt like
[1:19:48] because something fell
[1:19:56] but someone said
[1:20:00] so it says shut up
[1:20:03] it is ourselves
[1:20:08] now who are the first one that are going
[1:20:10] to die well the Elder
[1:20:17] [Laughter]
[1:20:28] I'm among them
[1:20:31] so
[1:20:54] we spoke about we talked about something
[1:20:57] of the beans that are called in the
[1:20:58] throne
[1:21:01] and we also know that the Tony has his
[1:21:03] attack
[1:21:05] and we're going to read about the song
[1:21:07] that he says
[1:21:08] foundations
[1:21:23] verse six
[1:21:25] this is Crystal
[1:22:04] was like a flying eagle
[1:22:09] so we have the throne
[1:22:15] we're going to see the throne
[1:22:19] put it like this
[1:22:23] but in reality also the throne is
[1:22:30] also the Tabernacle that Moses built on
[1:22:33] the desert is
[1:22:44] unless
[1:22:45] foreign
[1:23:42] a banner with this
[1:23:48] the flag of Mexico
[1:23:53] and the rest of the nation they have
[1:23:55] their own
[1:23:57] but we see on the scripture
[1:24:01] that that scripture says in Genesis
[1:24:06] that the first Guardian was a lion
[1:24:11] the first Guardian was a lion
[1:24:16] the lion represents the target Judah
[1:24:20] numerous
[1:24:22] numbers 2 verse three
[1:24:27] will go to the east
[1:24:30] foreign
[1:25:02] the animal sacrifice
[1:25:07] and that animal of sacrifice
[1:25:12] uh
[1:25:33] that speaks about the reformers
[1:25:48] will go to the South
[1:25:52] yes
[1:25:59] and the foreign
[1:26:18] ego
[1:26:25] performance now things began to shape up
[1:26:35] revelation 4.
[1:26:40] page 265 they're not angels
[1:26:50] he calls them living beings
[1:26:54] and these are The Gardens of the
[1:26:55] Tabernacle

[1:33:10] I want to build yes
[1:33:14] I noticed a little bit of a dispute
[1:33:17] about this
[1:33:20] line represents
[1:33:32] we still have a little bit of time

[1:34:16] and who did the eagle represent
[1:34:19] Prophet is
[1:34:39] because the Eagles will tear him down
[1:35:03] evangelist
[1:35:10] s
[1:35:25] to pray for him

[1:36:38] and then during your page you might have
[1:36:41] to do quite a bit
[1:36:43] if you have enough space you may put
[1:36:45] them together

[1:36:51] was
[1:36:51] of the four Gospels
[1:37:03] is impossible
[1:37:07] Maestro who would the teacher be
[1:37:10] Lucas
[1:37:12] Lucas

[1:37:29] he was the evangelist
[1:37:33] right
[1:37:37] places
