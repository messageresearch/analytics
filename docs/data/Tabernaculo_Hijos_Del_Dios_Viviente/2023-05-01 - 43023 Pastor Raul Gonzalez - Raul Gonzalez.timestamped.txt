[32:23] foreign
[32:33] [Music]
[33:03] always
[33:17] be ready
[33:19] up and down this post like we went to
[33:22] the year after year proclaiming your
[33:23] word
[33:24] is
[33:39] of the Bride is the truth I took your
[33:41] name by it Lord and said he wasn't
[33:43] saying the Lord
[33:47] and I feel that I'm conscious Lord of
[33:49] what I'm doing well actually even though
[33:52] you have a problem speaking to say the
[33:55] Lord
[33:59] just already
[34:00] knows a
[34:36] [Music]
[34:42] a refuge
[34:44] now
[34:46] contemporary
[34:56] evil things are supposed to be
[34:58] prophesied foreign
[35:24] foreign
[35:37] [Music]
[36:04] how can we do that
[36:07] is
[36:10] your performance to say the truth

[37:10] fellowship and walk under that
[37:13] God
[37:39] Lord help me to have peace
[37:53] in reality you're only asking for a
[37:56] favor
[37:58] but you have to stay quiet
[38:01] you speak to the Lord
[38:04] and you get quiet
[38:06] it's better you win
[38:09] until he answers and
[38:14] you are in one agreement
[38:17] [Music]
[38:21] there is a perfect communion
[38:31] a great way to have a conversation is to
[38:33] be in agreement about certain things
[38:38] but we don't get to a certain point and
[38:41] there's something strange about it for
[38:44] example
[38:45] businessman
[38:51] they used to tell us that we have to sit
[38:53] down uh
[38:57] about
[38:59] a coffee
[39:00] again
[39:56] that's what we have to do
[40:14] when he did this to make fun of him
[40:18] but this is a good very good teaching
[40:20] there
[40:24] a guest
[40:26] s
[40:27] and those who are lands
[40:30] everybody had to work
[40:35] they won't take their drinks were almost

[45:51] is that love right thing
[45:54] no
[45:55] I haven't before this there is something
[45:58] better than that in the moment use the
[46:00] law of God

[46:20] foreign
[47:02] say
[47:06] s
[47:10] related to that to wash our feet Yes

[47:54] that's all right
[48:01] but it says that we have to have the
[48:03] same feeling
[48:05] yes we have mutual agreement
[48:09] you're gonna have fellowships
[48:15] agreement with him

[48:29] 40 percent
[48:32] 60 percent
[48:34] wow
