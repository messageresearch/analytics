com [Music] for amenos uh for [Music] so [Music] the moment microphone okay you just bear with us this morning if you bear with us this morning God bless you all this morning bear with us here now as we as our sister helps us with the translation and we want to continue speaking on this ministry of of of William brandham God sent a prophet and and God had told them through a vision that his ministry would have three parts to it and and in the vision these parts were called the first poll and the second pole and the third pole it would have three parts his ministry the first poll of his ministry began in 1946 God had given him a a gift to pray for the sick and and and the gift was Vindicated by a sign in his [Music] hand and and that that first pool Ministry lasted from 1946 to 1949 but but even when that Ministry began he was already in expectation of the second part of the ministry and in 1949 the ministry changed and he went from praying to the Sick by a sign in his hand from to Discerning the hearts of the people and and in 1949 it began the second poll of his ministry lasted till 1963 we even have the date July 28th and July 28th 1963 marked the beginning [Music] of of of his third poll Ministry which which took him all the way to December the 24th 1965 when God took him home in an automobile accident just like to read a few quotes here in a in in a in a message called questions and answers on Genesis uh 1953 brother bam says this he says look the very night the very day that the angel of the Lord met me in 1946 on May the 7th May this at Greensville Indiana in Greensville Indiana that same day the the Treaty of Peace was signed for the Jews the what was signed for the Jews and they were an established Nation for the first time in 2500 years you you see God was bringing forth a [Music] restoration in the beginning of the 20th century not only for a gentile bride but but for a Jewish people not only for the bride tree but for the Fig Tree also they they were working at the same time together God bringing a great restoration what what what the prophet Joel had spoken of he said I shall restore sayth the Lord all all that the Locust has eaten all that the loc has eaten all that those four worms have eaten Amen in in Greensville Indiana in Greensville Indiana the angel of the Lord appeared and gave the prophet a commission in the message the pillar of fire 1953 he says now notice then then when a little bitty fella then the Holy Spirit spoke and said so he's saying when I when I was a little bitty fella then the Holy Spirit spoke and said don't never smoke chew or or drink defile your body in in any way there's a work for you to do when you get older and then many times down through life I try to tell people with the sincerity of my heart and they would misunderstand it they called it everything in the world well one night Yonder in Greens Mill Indiana in Greensville Indiana at a cave where I was at the angel of the Lord appeared he said you're to go pray for sick people and told me what would take place he said do not fear I'll be with you I took off and I came through the country and and down through Jonesboro telling what he said and what would come to pass and it's been that way and proved around the world and we Are Witnesses it my parents were in many of his meetings in those years in in these in these Services of praying for the sick and they said the blind the blind the blind sawu they said crippled [Music] walk and the lost were saved they were Witnesses and not only them but many in the message gifts and callings are without repentance uh preached the 1915 brother Bram says this now he says now of course a word for my people please no matter matter what sin you've done uh it'll be known here at the platform he said he said the first gift that's the first manifestation of the gift that I so that I could detect diseases as a doctor whatever it is to you would be the same thing see see but that gift doesn't heal you that was to encourage your faith to know that there's a supernatural being is standing here see then about three years later in Canada about five months ago the other gift came down and was manifested he says now I tell the secrets of the hearts the things that you do that that the things that you haven't confessed and so forth see it's perfect because it's of God it was the second call of his ministry in a in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed says this not knowing of course but but but being spiritual we watch spiritual things and not knowing this but but God knows it he said but if you'll turn and look at the clock it's it's it's 2:00 on the dock this was 1963 July 28th and he says it's the end of the second pool he told us the day we know the month we even know the hour of the day when the ministry went from his second pool to his third poll the first and second poll was healing campaigns but the third pole was the opening of The Seven Seals it began in 1963 his third full ministry it wasn't to be healing anymore God wasn't majoring there he he still still a Healer I've felt his healing touch many times he's raised me out of what more than one hospital bed when I was dying but what God is focusing on is the revealed word of God With A Plan of Salvation that teaches us how to live and how to be sensitive spiritually to everything that's happening around us to judge it by the word and to be led by the spirit in the message the anointed ones at the end time 1965 it was July 25th brother randam says this notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts but when he begins to declare his message he says the first poll was healing part one of his ministry the second pole was prophesying earning the hearts of the [Music] people amen Discerning the hearts of the people he says the third poll is the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed there is no higher order than to reveal the word through prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the very word he brings and remember the third pole was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word says do you see it in the message why are people so tossed [Music] about brother bam says this he said I noticed to my left which was would Ben to my right I was on the platform he's he's sharing a portion of the vision of the 10th Vision because I noticed to my left which had been to my right if I was on the platform because in the vision in the vision he had been taken from the platform and now he was standing way in the back now of this of this great tent and he's looking towards the platform he says he says a little wooden building and I seen that light he say they have the picture of it you know he's talking about the picture of the pillar of fire he says it's it's always in the meeting I seen that light leave me and it went to that building that little wooden building and it went inside that building and a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that will be the third pole so if God was going to meet him there in that little wooden building and that would be the third pool then we want to know what the third pool is and he just told us the third pole was the revealing of them seals so in the tent Vision God told him he would meet him in that little room he told him that would be the third poem when he was preaching the Seven Seals and in in in Jeffersonville Indiana he says and there I was in that little room and if it wouldn't have been about 12:00 today that the Holy Spirit came down and be and began telling me what to write I would have got it all wrong so maybe the symbols of this little room was that little room where he was studying in and the angel made met him every night to bring forth the revelation of these Seven Seals the third pool was the opening of them seven SE to reveal the hidden truth to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word in the message the anointed [Music] ones in that end time brother Bram says this he says Revelations 10 it it says in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel now remember seventh lah Church age the sounding of that angel when that church age is done denominated and become a church when it's in the Pentecostal organization when the messenger to that what was each messenger what was Martin Luther Lu a rebuke to the Catholic Church what was Wesley a rebuke to them lutherans what was the Pentecost what was was the the messenger to Pentecost a rebuke to them others what what was the Pentecost a rebuke to them others yeah what was the pent what was the Pentecostals a rebuke to the others where has the life gone now away from an organization no more shock no more it's it's the grain what is it a rebuke to the Pentecostals now see to fulfill the scripture of this hour notice the very day when this messenger when he starts on but not not when he starts but when he begins to declare his message see the first poll was healing the second poll was prophesying and the third pole the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed [Music] the third pole was the opening of them Seven Seals and in the vision of the tent Vision the angel told him I'll meet you in there I'll meet you in that little room and what's going to happen in that little room brother brandom what will that be what what does that mean the angel told him that will be thir so is the third pool the healing [Music] campaign is the third poll is is is meeting there is is that is that when he discern the hearts of the people no he said the third pole is the revealing of those Seven Seals that's been sealed in the word then brother BR says do you see it this T Vision people want another big healing Revival campaign to prove that God is here God wants to give you his word that will transform and change you give you the character of a true Christian to learn how to turn from sin to teach you how to be a better father a better mother better children in the home to teach a pastor how to hold the standard of Holiness in the house of God God is wanting to bring a people to be like Jesus how teach us how to stand on the word I know people I know I know people who have had great miracles in their lives a sister a friend who who had a prayer card who who who was in one of the meetings of brother brandham and they called her number and she came forth and she gave them the prayer card and and she walked the line all the way around to the right hand side of the Prophet they told her she had had had cancer and there's nothing more she they could do for her and she had only days maybe months to live and the growth was on her neck already coming out out and the growth in cancer and the prophet took her by hand and prayed for her and the growth fell off and she was completely healed and you know what else she turned her back on the word and went out to the world amen but what if she would have been in a meeting where the baptism of the Holy Ghost got a hold of her heart she'd be serving the lord Jesus yet today you think she's the only one that's been healed and then turn their back on the word no there are many there are many at 68 I'm not an old man but I'm old enough to tell you I've seen these things but I've never seen once someone receive a genuine experience with God and be born again and ever turn back on the Lord Jesus Christ but those who have been miraculous healed I've seen them with his eyes turn their back on the Lord Jesus God wants to take you to a place in your Christian walk to a place where you'll where you'll be so convinced you'll be willing to die for the Lord Jesus God rich in Mercy so the angel told the prophet he says to my right was a little wooden building it was the tent Vision I seen the light you've seen the picture of it it's always in the meeting he said I seen the light leave me no I seen the light I've seen the light leave me and it went to that little building there's some details here he doesn't say he says in other messages and he said before he went in he says a woman walked in who was sick by herself no one went in with her and she came out completely healed she said I I she said I seen a man go in who was sick and he came out completely healed no one was in there with him no other man was in there with him the pillar of fire was meeting people in that little room and the angel tells him a voice said to me I'll meet you in there that will be the third poll that won't be the first pole that won't be my second pole Ministry this is going to be my third pole Ministry the revealing of the word so William brandham had three poles in his [Music] ministry because Jesus did too in the Book of Matthew Jesus begins his ministry in Matthew chapter 4 you've read it but go back and read it again in the beginning of his ministry he was an an evangelist having great campaign healing services to where where thousands and thousands came you read the gospels that was the beginning of the first poll of William Brandon of of Ministry of Jesus Christ then then his ministry went up another level and it began Discerning the hearts of the people that was the second pole of the ministry of Jesus Christ then he entered his third pole where he wasn't praying for the sick like he used to instead he told them if you don't eat my flesh if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me it was the third full ministry of Jesus Christ the son of man at the first coming it was setting a [Music] pattern for the second coming where where God once again would do the same thing all over again why does he do things the same way because he's God Paul said in Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he unchanging in all his ways he's unchanging in all his ways he does it that way so he can hide himself from the wise and [Music] prudent and reveal it unto babes such as would learn not babes natural but Supernatural men and women who have really been born again and it began their Christian walk justified by faith Sanctified by the spirit baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire then then that really begins your journey now you're a son a daughter going through a process that the Apostle Paul called a son and daughter being adopted God rich in Mercy we'd like to read for you out of uh Revelations 8 and verse one a scripture very well known to should be known to all of us Revelations 8 and verse Oney and when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour Revelations 8 and verse 1 amen and when he had opened the seven seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour Revelations chapter 8 it doesn't tell us here in the scripture who opened it it just says he opened it we can assume who he is or we can go back into the scripture and let the Bible tell us so this is Revelations 81 John was seeing seen these visions and as he as he would see them apart he would he would write them down so to know who is talking about when it says he had opened the seventh seal and when I read scriptures like this I want to know who is he the simplest way to do it is turn back a page to chapter 7 and see what was said at the last part of chapter 7 we'll begin reading in chapter 7 verse1 15 Bible readers you're familiar with chapter S A Mighty Angel a mighty Angel he's holding back the wrath of seven of Four Angels and then it goes on to speak of of Israel in 144,000 the the chosen of God then he goes on to speak of a people who are of every Kindred tongue and Nation representing a gentile people then we come to verse 15 it says therefore are they Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple and he that sth at the throne shall dwell among them he said they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore verse 16 neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat then verse 17 for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living Fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes for then the very next thing that John says and when he had opened the seven seal so who opened it he just told us in in the last verse of chapter S the lamb that's the way this Bible is written the books and the chapters are not independent of each other no no they all come together that's why a prophet told us never take one quote never take one quote and put a period on it no don't never take one scripture and put a period on it no always put a comma because all the Bible comes together and when scripture comes together with scripture then it adds more detail and more detail and more details then that's God bringing Revelation to our hearts Revelations 81 now we can read it differently and when the lamb had opened the seven seal and when the lamb and when the lamb had open the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you see what happens when you put bring scripture together it starts revealing the plan of God it starts telling you who is opening this word it was the lamb and when the lamb had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour turn turn with me to Revelations 10 1 to3 Revelations 10y verse 1 to3 and I saw verse one and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of [Music] fire and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their [Music] voices just a minute here Revelations 10 1-3 apyp it was the time of the revealing of the word it was the time of this third pool and the message Christ is is the mystery of God [Music] revealed Christ is preached in 1963 and he declares where his ministry is at we just read it I want to read it again he said he says of course being spiritual you watch spirit things he said not knowing this God Knows It But if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot 2 o00 so while he's sharing this God is speaking to his heart and telling him look at the clock it's 2 o00 right on the DOT and the prophets thinking okay Lord but what does that mean and then and the and the Lord speaks to him and says it's the end of your second poll the third pole is at hand the healing campaigns under the first and second Pole he says your ministry is changing now now it's the revealing of the word all of that healing campaigns were to catch the [Music] attention of a little bride a bride that was in denominations a bride bride members that were in the world in the in lost that's what these healing campaigns were for to catch the attention of his children a predestinated group of people in the message the anointed ones at the end time I'm going to read this again he says notice the very day when when this messenger uh not when he starts but when he begins to declare his message she said the first poll was the healing campaign the second poll was the discernment prophesying he said but the third pole it's it's the opening of the word it's the Mysteries revealed he says there's no higher order than to reveal the word through prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word he says and remember this is 19 this is 1965 and he wants us to remember something from what the angel told him back in the 1950s he's bringing it to our remembrance this part of the vision he said Remember the third pool was the opening of them Seven [Music] Seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word he said do you see it in the same message what is the attraction on the mountain he says what what happened upon Mount Sunset I don't know if any of you have ever been there to Sunset mountain in Sunset it's there in the state of Arizona it's close to a small little town called Wilcox it's back into the dirt roads into into the ranches back in there it takes it takes a few hours to get back inside in there and there's a little mount in that area in that region called Mount sunset the prophet says what what happened upon Mount about upon Mount Sunset he said God confirming his word he say that's what all this noise is about it's God fulfilling his promised word again which promises then he tells us the promise of Revelations 10 1-7 that's what the those were the promises that were coming to pass on Mount Sunset and then he says and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message in the days the mystery of God should be finished the hidden Mystery of Revelations 10 1-7 the last message to the last Church age it's fulfilled exactly in this age he says L Luke St Luke 1730 he says the day when the son of man shall be [Music] revealed he says and there shall rise false prophets and false Christ there and there shall r false prophets and false Christ and show great signs and wonders in so much that deceive the elected possible he saids the people the people still in doubt and as usual the church is just as confused in the message the Feast of the trumpets brother Bram says this he says look I want to say one more thing closely now don't miss this how how striking how stri from the seventh Angels messenger of the seventh seal from the seventh angel the messenger of the seven seal message in Revelations 10 Revelations 10 was the seventh seal let me say that again Revelations 10 was the seventh seal you see I'm going to I'm going to believe and assume that that that all of you like me we thought that the only thing written about the seventh seal was Revelations 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the space of a half hour but Revelation 10 is 11 verses the prophet just added 11 verses of more detail of what the seventh seal [Music] is so if you read Revelations 10 1 to 11 you're reading prophecy that is that that was that was supposed to come to pass at the opening of the seventh seal did you catch that when the seventh he says verse Revelations 81 and when he the Lamb of God had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the space of a half hour and then brother Bram tells us in the message Feast of the trumpets he tells us Revelations 10 was the seventh seal so he just added 11 more verses of detail to what the seventh seal is and what are the things that are going to happen when that seal is open so what does Revelations 10 tell us there was a mighty angel with a book in his hand that book was what was it open or was it closed someone say it open Revelations 101 that angel that Covenant angel that Covenant Angel stood with one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and the book was open the word being revealed through the mouth of a prophet so the seventh seal now there's more written in the Bible than just one verse verse it now becomes the seal with the most detail of all the seals it it now becomes the seal with more detail than all the other six seals a prophet just added 11 more verses of detail to what the seven SE is he said Revelations 10 in the message the Feast of the trumpets was the seventh seal so what's happening under the seventh seal an angel descends on Sunset Mountain what happens under the seventh seal God sends the seventh angel to to sound and bring forth the revelation of how we can live Victorious Christian lives God God can heal you of some sickness but that doesn't make you a better Christian no you must be born again to be a better Christian you must receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost with fire to be a better Christian you must live by faith to be a better believer you must be you must believe that God told you to live a life of Holiness to be a better Christian and all that revealed under the seventh seal yes in 1963 it there was an article that was put out by the University of Arizona I remember one morning in 1963 a brother knocked on our door his name was brother Daniel Ramirez and he and he was a good friend of my mom and dad and he's knocking on the door knocking they answer the door and he says brother Angel do you know what just happened he says no he says no he says God came down angels have come down he says where he says on Sunset Mountain it's just 3 hours away from here he says how do you know this he says look at the picture and he had with him a little booklet he says and it was from the University of Arizona and there was a scientist a man called called James McDonald James mcdonaldd and he had written up a small article on this cloud and the article said this he says an unusual an unusual an unusual ring shaped cloud was was was observed Obed over Northern Arizona about sunset on the 28th of February 1963 he says and and was seen by a large number of people that reported it it's known to have appeared over near Flagstaff Arizona he said and from and and from the pictures that were that were taken in Tucson about 190 miles south of the cloud about 190 miles south of the cloud he says the altitude was approximately 35 kilomet he says the most the the furthest [Music] observation must was reported about 280 miles from the cloud and then he says the cloud remained Sun illuminum for 28 minutes after local sunset for [Music] you know when when John saw this cloud in the in the Book of Revelations he didn't he didn't know how to count minutes and hours like we do today that's why when he saw it he said and when the lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for the space of a half hour that was the prophecy but when it actually happened in reality in Arizona when the seven seal open now we have more detail science do you see it unrecorded of science but recorded in God's holy word in the book of Acts chapter 1 we're going to read from verse 7 to verse 11 Al mhm acts 1: 7 to1 and verse S reads like this and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and all Juda and Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the earth and when he had spoken these things they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received them out of their sight this is the Lord Jesus he ascended on high and while they looked as he went up behold two men stood by him in white apparel verse [Music] 10 which also said ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up unto Heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven here in the book of Acts this was the first time that this Cloud had descended and men had seen this wasn't just a cloud this was the same seven angels that we seen today in this 20th century in our day this is the picture that Life Magazine took this was not just the cloud that received Lord Jesus this was seven angels and the pattern in our day why because it's Hebrews 13 and8 he's the same yesterday today and forever and the pattern of his first coming Jesus having three poles in his ministry now Jesus is taken up and a cloud receives him and these two angels they tell the disciples you see the way you go so shall he return again in the same way we know how he's returned seven angels on Sunset Mountain bringing a message of the third pole to a prophet and because we know what the cloud was in our day science took the picture not us and in that picture if you've ever seen it of Life magazine you can see the angel you can see the Angels when they first gave the magazine to brother [Music] brandham he never had seen it until about six or seven [Music] months after even preached the seals and a brother M brought him the Life magazine and brother brandom looks at it he goes wow because though he had been caught up in that constellation he'd been caught up but he had never seen it in a picture and when he saw it he's looking at it and the holy tells him turn it to the right anybody here have the magazine I have it maybe next time I come I'll bring it so that you can do just what the Holy Spirit told the prophet to do what the Holy Spirit told the prophet to do so you can hold the magazine in your hand and turn it to the right I'm sure you've all seen the picture he said turn it to the right and when you turn it to the right you see the face of Christ that cloud that you see there is the same Cloud that caught up Jesus more than 2000 th000 years ago it was seven angels in our day and it was seven angels back then because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Isaiah 28 verse 9 and [Music] 10 Isaiah 28 Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast Isaiah 28 and verse [Music] n for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little what was the Holy Spirit telling us through Isaiah one quote or one scripture and preach a Doctrine on it because it'll be wrong every time it has to be precept upon precept verse 10 and precept upon precept and line upon line and line upon line and here a little and there a little here a little bit from a message in 1950 here a little a little bit from a message in 1965 here a little bit more in a message in 1962 here a little bit a message in 196 and bring them all together scure matching with scripture Revelations 10 1 and two read we'll read it again and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud apyp one Revelations 101 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven how was he clothed with a cloud be in the book of Acts Jesus was caught up in a cloud but it wasn't just a cloud it was seven angels that was his first coming and the angels told told the disciples there just the way that you've seen him go you'll see him come back again and he didn't just say that for the discip IPL not for the disciples in that day but that was written in the Bible for the Disciples of this day that was written for you this morning so you could have a revelation so you could so you could recognize your day in its message so that you could realize that you can have a real B again experience by the word not by a sensation and I Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud so this isn't the first coming this is not the first coming this must be his second coming because this isn't the first time a cloud appears in the with Jesus this is not the first time this is the second time the first time was in the book of Acts when that cloud was seen seven angels but the second time this cloud is seen is on sent Mountain in 1963 February the 28th what is it it's his coming the angel said so just as you've seen him go In This Cloud of seven angels so shall you see him come again with this cloud of seven angels that makes makes this Revelations 10 his second coming not his first and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainow was upon his head brother Bram said the rainbow represents he's a covenant angel repres and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire representing the grace of God verse two can he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth what did a prophet say of Revelations [Music] 10 he said Revelations 10 is the seventh seal and under the seventh seal the book is open when was this book open when did the cloud appear and he said he set his right foot upon the sea sea represents a multitude of people a gentile people and his left foot upon the Earth Earth represents Israel and the land of promise so this Angel is descending with a book that's open the book is the Lamb's Book of Life he's descending with the Lamb's Book of Life to bring life to a gentile people to bring life to the bright [Music] tree and to bring life to the Fig Tree Israel it's a time of [Music] restoration that's what the seventh seal is about I shall restore sayith the Lord all that those four worms had eaten down all that those four worms I shall restore he said when is the time of that restoration we are living in the day that God wants to restore Us in the message modern events made clear by prophecy [Music] brother says this the year 1965 he says these modern events is slipping by us quickly and one day we're going to find out we we'll be left behind without nothing and be caught sealed into the mark the Beast before we know it he now with patience we have to wait for the prophecies that's promised every one of them must be fulfilled in its age he says the author has done this before can we wait for him to see to see him do it again oh what a time it is that we're living in something like a calendar you look at the calendar to find out what day of the year you're living in you look at God's Bible to see what age we're living in we're not living in the Methodist age we're not living in the Baptist age the year's [Music] 1965 it's December the 6 and the prophet will be going off the scene in about another 15 days and he says we're now living in the bright age [Music] the calling time where God is bringing us back through a channel that he promised to bring us back through he promised to do it the channel he was talking about was the channel of Malachi 4 the Elijah Ministry the seventh angel he would use this ministry to bring us back into his presence so what is he saying now telling us that Revelations 10 is the bride age he's telling us that Revelations 10 is the seventh seal in the message the breach he says now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus Christ it's a book it's it's a mysterious book it's a book of redemption and now we know that the book of redemption will be thoroughly [Music] understood he says it's it's probed that what inv through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound sound sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these other fellas probe that and the Mysteries comes down from God as the as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God then the then the godhead the godhead the godhead and everything else is settled to all the Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed he said now you see I'm not just making making that up it's thus sayth the Lord I'll read it to you out of the book The sounding of the seventh Angels message the mystery of God should be finished that's been declared by his holy prophets that's what the prophets who who has wrote the word they said at the sounding the of the seventh Church age the last Church age all the Loose Ends all the Loose Ends that through these Church ages has been probed that has been proved that will be wound up together and when the seals are broke and the Mysteries revealed down comes the angel the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on the earth at the time of this coming where does it speak to us of the seventh angel Revelations 10:7 and where does it speak of that angel who descended with the cloud Revelations 101 so so Revelations 10 is the coming of the Lord what is revelation 10 of what a prophet has told us Revelations 10 that chapter it's the seventh seal Revelations 10 it's the bride age Revelations 10 Prophet said it's his coming Revelations 10 a prophet told us is when the Seven Seals of God were opened there on Sunset Mountain Revelations 10 is all these things he said Revelations 10 it's a third poll in the first seal brother preached 1963 you've got to go back and hear them all let him that ha an ear to hear hear what the spirit is speaking unto the church you're in the church this morning that God wants to speak to that God wants to speak to you are the church you are the one he died for on Calvary you are the one he shed his blood for you are the one he rose for on the third day so you should be the one searching the scriptures the Gospel of John he said search the scriptures if in them you think it has eternal life for you Jesus said blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled with the revelation of these Seven Seals the message the first seal brother bam says this but in the last days in this last age the messenger is not to start any Reformation but is to take all the Mysteries that those reformers left off and gather them together and solve them to the people let me just read it again he says he says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow upon his head his face was as the sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we saw the same thing now we saw the same thing which was Christ he's talking about the cloud and we know Christ is always the messenger to the church he's called the pillar of Fire he's the angel of the Covenant and he had in his hand a little book open then he says now the seals have done been broke he says we're breaking them now he's preaching the first seal he says the seals have done been broke in other words they've been opening Through the Ages and the first seal opened in the days of Jesus the first seal opened in the days of the first Elijah John the Baptist and the last seal was open in the Days of Elijah William brandham William you see it's a pattern in God's word God's unchanging in all his ways so that his little bride can catch the Revelation so that you can recognize who you are you're the Bride of Jesus Christ in this seventh Church age but youve walked out of laa you've walked into the bright age into that little wooden room where God is giving you a personal experience where God wants to give you a personal experience how we need a personal experience with Jesus Christ people shout and say we need another Revival where people are where we pray for the sick and they're healed no no we need to be born again baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire so that you will have the faith that when a brother comes to you and he's sick you can lay hands upon him and they'll be [Music] healed that's the bride's Revival men and women truly being born again but is it because if there's one thing I see that's not happening or very little is Believers in this message with a born again experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire message pastors message fornicators and adulterers and their congregations following in the same path and that's what the message is producing no they've left the word they've abandoned Christ they have no Revelation and they're caught in their adultery and they're caught and the congregation lets them stay as pastor and the Apostle Paul says the Elder that would do such a thing Mark him publicly he should be shamed because if he stays in the Pulpit he'll lead all the congregation in that Wicked adulterous spirit then God's house is not a House of Prayer no more then that message church is now a den of Thieves yeah that was free that's no extra charge for that one and yet it's Revelation and yet it's truth because they're not getting into the word they're not getting on their knees looking for a message for the people in the message the first seal because in Revelations 10 and the fourth verse it says and when seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and and I Heard a Voice say don't write it and everybody in the message says we don't know that that was never written so we can't know it even though it wasn't a written word you know what it is you know what it still is today you know what it still is today it's the spoken word didn't didn't he say and when seven Thunders uttered their voices that's the spoken word and what was a prophet supposed to what was a prophet supposed to bring us thus sayith the Lord what do Theus sayth the Lord the spoken word someone might say how can it come to pass if it wasn't written you go to the Book of Genesis when God created when God put the whole earth in order we read about it today but when it was spoken and when it came to pass when the it wasn't written it was Moses that wrote the Book of Genesis you know how long after he wrote [Music] it more than 2,000 years came the written word so did God did God have to wait for Moses to write it for him to bring his word to pass he did not but he allowed it to be written he allowed it to be written for us so that we could see God moving from Genesis to Revelations so that we could see he's the same yesterday today and forever so we could see the the pattern of God's word throughout the thousands of years so we could see with our eyes how God works so that we can see in our lives and that it's him working today questions and answers number four in 1963 they asked brother brandom a question we'll be closing quickly here and they asked him the question was have the seven Thunders which equal seven Mysteries already been revealed have have the seven Thunders which equals already been revealed he says were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet that was the question the answer are you interested in this [Music] answer he says no he says they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was [Laughter] about they were to reveal Ian the seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding in the days of his sounding the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh Church age so what is the thunder brother Ram said in the first seal he said this we found what thunder means that's perfect we know that see he says the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened so what would seven Thunders be then wouldn't it be the voice of God opening Seven Seals in the time of the seventh angel in 1963 in Ville Indiana Indiana could God have failed to do that could God have failed no not my God he cannot fail thus comes to pass every time so when the a so when the angel on Sunset Mountain told William Bram go back East to Jefferson Indiana IND and I will give you the revelation of those Seven Seals is that a lie or did that happen it happened if one of you last the Revelation one of you it's not because the book isn't open it's not because the Revelation didn't come it's because you need to find your place to that little room that wooden room and meet the pillar of fire and ask him for Revelation have you read the church age books the exposition of the seven Church [Music] ages what did a prophet tell us there I cannot overemphasize the need for Revelation as a matter of fact Jesus told Peter who do you say that I am Peter thou are the Christ the son of the Living God what did Jesus tell him is there any Bible readers here this morning is that scripture turning in your head what Jesus told him Jesus told Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven and Upon This Rock I'll build my church Stone by stone stone by Stone one man one woman at a time I will change your life with the revelation of these Seven Seals brother Bram said brother brandham said in the exposition of the seven Church ages Malachi 4 and Revelations 10:7 going to do two things number one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers number two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven Thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals which the the which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be this divinely revealed mystery speak truths it will be these divinely revealed that literally will turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers and that's thus sayth the Lord and of course the question keeps being [Music] asked are the Seven Seals open did the prophet have success in doing it first of all it wasn't the prophet that told us they would be open no it was God that told the prophet he would open them did you catch that it wasn't William brandom that guaranteed us that the Seven Seals would be open no it was almighty God it was the Lord Jesus that told the prophet go back to Jeffersonville and I will give you the revelation of these Seven Seals God said it I believe it that settled it for me is there another believer here to say the same to say the same that I believe what Jesus said I believe what God God said in standing in the Gap 1963 Prophet said this well it happens to be that at least one man is present this morning who was standing there when it happened talking about sunset Mountain when the seven angels came down it actually shook the Rocks off the mountain we we find out that during that time I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid that swept down and picked me up and I was brought East to open the Seven Seals for himself for God if you haven't got them if Jesus terries my great grandchildren little Paul's children that will still be the Eternal truth of the Living God now this was to find out what was sealed inside this mountain that wasn't wrote he's talking about one of the dreams of the six dreams and the One Vision that he spoke of in s is this the time in SE it had to be interpreted and when I came back in other words when I came back to Jeffersonville Indiana to preach the Seven Seals he said this the first angel on the first night opened the seal the first angel in the first night opened the seal contrary to anything we have ever heard in our life and all seven came out the same way you know that you were here present when it happened to many of you he said the first night the first Angel met him in that little room he said opened the seal contrary to anything we ever heard in our life then he said and all seven came the same way God declaring wanting you to recognize your day and your message we're not waiting for the second coming of William Brandon we're waiting for the second coming of Jesus Christ and he's come and he's here and he's here this morning he can meet you where you're sitting he can meet you on your knees at the altar but he's here to meet you inur in the message is this the sign of the answer brother Bram says this paragraph 3:14 he says now when he begins to sound the mystery will be finished you're a Bible reader you know he's speaking about Revelations 10:7 he says now notice then it's time for the seven seal voices now it's time then it's time for the seven seal voices in other words the seven Thunders so when the when the seventh angel begins to sound when the seventh angel begins to sound that's the time of the seven thunders of Revelations 10 to be revealed do you understand he said when all the mysteries of the book was completed that's the time so Revelations 10 what did a prophet tell us it is Revelations 10 is the seven seal Revelations 10 it's the bride age Revelations 10 it's his second coming Revelations 10 is when the Seven Seals was opened there on Sunset Mountain where were the Seven Seals open didn't it start in Jeffersonville Indiana Indiana no no he said brother brandom said Revelations 10 is when the Seven Seals were opened on Sunset Mountain amen and the angel spoke to the prophet the angel with an open book in his hand he says go back east and I'll give you the revelation of this book that I've opened what's the book that's opened it's the Lamb's Book of Life amen it's the Lamb's Book of Life Revelations 10 it's when the seventh angel begins to sound when did it begin to sound March 18th 1963 this day that scripture fulfilled am Amen in the message I have heard but now I see it says this now we're promised the church age to reformers and we had them but we but he promised in Malachi 4 he he'd keep his pattern in the last days what would take place to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apost apostolic [Music] fathers a but the church is so broke up in denominations and [Music] isms the church the church is so broke up in denominations and isms it's so Tor to Pieces till it's dead it's been a carrier and then he promised in the hour of the seventh Angel's message the seventh seals would be revealed and the mysteries of God would be declared then he says when in Revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message when was that brother bam says not the healing services but the message that follows the healing service the purpose of the healing Services is to catch the attention of the predestinated Bride of Jesus [Music] Christ and draw to the word the revealed word Christ in us the hope of glory I won't finish this morning even though I feel the most important parts I've just close the book on it I realize folks can only he for so long and we get tired but let me remind you I'm talking about eternal life and your position in Christ I'm talking about fathers baptized with the Holy Ghost they can lead their children to Christ I'm talking about the changing power of the Holy Spirit brother random says the churches are dead with isms of denominational thoughts [Music] it's come to this message where many houses are no longer a House of Prayer but a then of Thieves when Jesus came he saw Israel the church he told them as a hen doth gather her rude so I tried to gather you he told them but you would not you know what Jesus offered Israel the open book and the revelation of the Seven Seals that's what Israel rejected which was Jesus Christ the word made flesh amongst them that's what they rejected like Eve they took the seed of the serpent like Eve she received the seed of the serpent instead of the revealed word of God if there's someone here I encourage you run for your life and receive the word of God the revealed word spoken word so where do I begin with that spoken spoken word brother Daniel what's the pattern of the first coming it'll be the same for this time so how do you begin with begin with this Revelation straight out of the seventh seal begin with this Revelation that's brought forth through the seventh seal you know what it is repent and be baptized of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire that is what will help you recognize your day and his message as we stand our feet
