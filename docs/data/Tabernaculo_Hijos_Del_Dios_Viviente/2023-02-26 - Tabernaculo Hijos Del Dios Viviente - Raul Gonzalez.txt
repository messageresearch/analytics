[Music] and then I'm gonna ask some of you to help me so how your Bible is open and handy because thank you so Genesis chapter 22 says verse 12 verse and he said lay not that hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fear is God think thou has not withheld thy song than only son from me [Music] by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the state of the son and please also around foreign [Music] and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen um [Music] let us make a little prayer foreign [Music] Hallelujah so the name is Jehovah Jireh and Thomas [Music] it actually means God will do it because so God will make things to happen if you read if you read the whole chapter told Abraham absolutely and in a sacrifice yeah you know what that means [Music] but the Bible said in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 said Abraham believe that God was able to give Isaac back to him because the guy is capable to do that it was a tight you know people if it was it was a a shadow of something that was going to happen later on and and Abraham places in Isaac on on the outer and told us and Abraham is about to grab or Abraham grabs the knife when God speaks to Abraham and he tells Abraham I see that you're faithful I see that you believe me foreign [Music] and he wasn't stuck in the thinking how did that happen so we're going out the mountains and the Bible says that Abraham's places uh the wood in the back of Isaac he is [Music] and I said what's going on about them with his dad yeah and I said what's a little intelligence I know that my dad does things out of the ordinary he was actually possible you know bad we have the fire in here something was telling I said oh you better watch out the hope don't worry son whatever the Lord will provide a sacrifice amen amen and that was just a type yeah with uh Psalm 23 Psalm 23. again anybody can read it Psalm 23 1. yes [Music] so what is what it says there is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] somebody everybody Isaiah 53 or you know women Spanish or English it doesn't matter and then somebody else look for Peter chapter one verse three somebody else look for acts 4 12. look at those Bible verses and and somebody get it for me amen amen foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and it says how he was despised it is and he was despised because of you and me first word look what this sacrifice provides he born our dreams and carry our sorrows so those two things greens and Sorrows your griefs and sorrows or taken by Jesus on the cross the new now Serve Yourself that this prophecy against the prophecy was created about 700 years before Jesus came to the Earth foreign was about to give Isaac as a sacrifice coming down to earth and evil himself as a sacrifice foreign [Music] Jesus paid for it Jesus father foreign [Music] [Music] and with his stripes we are here so the healing of your body was also paid of that cross [Music] by Jesus Christ [Music] let's move on a little bit past first Peter 1.
