[1:31] [Music]
[1:36] [Music]
[1:44] good morning
[1:47] [Music]
[1:53] [Music]
[2:01] [Music]
[2:12] [Music]
[2:19] it is
[2:25] [Music]
[2:29] thank you
[2:38] [Music]
[2:51] [Music]
[3:00] foreign
[3:01] [Music]
[3:11] [Music]
[3:27] [Music]
[3:39] oh
[3:42] Lord
[3:44] I do
[3:49] [Music]
[3:52] yes
[3:54] it's a battery it's a pleasure to be
[3:58] here
[4:01] and uh we are appreciate the invitation
[4:05] of my brother
[4:10] happy to be here
[4:23] so we're happy to be here
[4:28] and to see you all again
[4:35] and his wife his family
[4:38] and just asking the Lord Jesus to help
[4:42] us to share something
[4:45] that will bless your heart
[4:48] maybe maybe something new
[4:52] maybe something that you've already
[4:54] heard before
[4:56] but I'm sure it'll be something you know
[5:00] that we could only know because
[5:03] God sent a prophet
[5:07] not only a prophet
[5:10] that but he was a messenger
[5:13] he was a messenger to this last eight
[5:21] amen and he brought to us the word of
[5:24] God
[5:25] the word of God that has been lost
[5:29] since the days of Jesus
[5:55] every verse seemed to be a verse all by
[5:59] itself
[6:03] and yet we know we realize the Bible
[6:05] isn't written that way at home
[6:09] that every verse connects
[6:12] from Genesis to Revelations
[6:15] and everyone speaks of the Lord Jesus
[6:19] Christ
[6:23] I like this again here in Revelations
[6:26] chapter five
[6:27] [Music]
[6:30] because Revelations chapter five
[6:38] and he's looking all the way back to
[6:41] Genesis
[6:43] all the way to the day he was living
[6:47] and he was looking to the Future
[6:51] and all of this happened
[6:54] in this one chapter
[6:56] so if you'll turn with me to Revelations
[6:59] chapter five
[7:02] Singapore and verse 1
[7:04] will read it
[7:06] and I saw on the right hand of him that
[7:09] sat on the throne a book written within
[7:12] and on the back side sealed with Seven
[7:15] Seals
[7:24] we thank you once again this evening
[7:28] and ask that you would come on the scene
[7:33] where your word can only be known by
[7:35] Revelation foreign
[7:44] give it to every born-again believer
[7:49] said when you spoke to Nicodemus I think
[7:51] we wanted to keep this unless you be
[7:53] born again
[7:55] you cannot see the kingdom of God
[7:59] you can't see a new testament rising up
[8:02] you know
[8:04] you can't see the Shadows becoming
[8:07] reality
[8:09] you can't see that the millions of lands
[8:12] that were slain
[8:20] of the Lamb of God
[8:27] so Lord we speak on this chapter today
[8:33] may you Open the Eyes of our
[8:36] understandings
[8:48] thank you
[8:49] Revelations chapter five
[8:53] begins with John saying
[8:56] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[8:59] sat on the throne
[9:01] a book written within
[9:05] on the back side and in English that's
[9:08] where the karma is
[9:12] a sealed with Seven Seals
[9:17] so for many years
[9:19] as the prophet would read this scripture
[9:23] and read that verse
[9:34] that something was written on the back
[9:37] side
[9:38] and sealed with Seven Seals
[9:42] and from the early part of this ministry
[9:47] we're back in the 19
[10:10] [Music]
[10:47] and he believed that those Seven Seals
[10:52] for the seven Thunders
[10:55] and he said in 1963 in the breach
[11:00] he says there's nothing written on the
[11:03] back side
[11:06] he says and seven Thunders is not the
[11:09] same as Seven Seals
[11:12] but for 10 years
[11:16] that he believed that it was
[11:19] but when the Holy Spirit came down
[11:27] and even corrected the opinion of the
[11:30] Prophet himself
[11:32] this is John Cena vision
[11:36] and John is seeing this vision
[11:39] and verse the first verse begins in
[11:43] Genesis
[11:46] and John is looking back to Genesis
[12:07] and he was judging the whole world in
[12:10] Genesis
[12:14] he was judging Adam
[12:16] in Genesis
[12:18] he was judging the woman
[12:21] he was going to bring judgment on the
[12:23] serpenter and this is John give this one
[12:27] looking back to Genesis
[12:30] and seeing God on the throne in Genesis
[12:34] we need judgment to his children
[12:40] it was a judgment of the whole world
[12:44] of course there was only three people
[12:51] but they were the whole world
[12:55] they were all the inhabitants that were
[12:57] on the earth
[13:02] [Music]
[13:04] let's turn to Genesis
[13:07] chapter 3
[13:11] thank you
[13:30] and read on this judgment Throne that
[13:33] was taking place
[13:41] the veil of Holiness has been taken from
[13:44] their eyes
[13:46] and now they realize they were naked
[13:50] because they're eating from the tree
[13:53] or the knowledge of Good and Evil
[13:55] together
[13:57] instead of the tree of life
[14:00] and the knowledge of Good and Evil yeah
[14:07] [Music]
[14:09] and to eat of that tree yesterday
[14:21] but only the knowledge
[14:26] you've been called to live a life
[14:39] they ate of the tree
[14:41] and in verse 13 of Genesis 3 the
[14:44] universe
[14:45] [Music]
[14:59] it's the same story today
[15:05] [Music]
[15:22] partake about the things that God said
[15:24] don't touch the unclean things
[15:27] [Music]
[15:32] and the Lord God sent unto the serpent
[15:34] because thou has done this Thou Art
[15:36] cursed of all the cattle above every
[15:39] beast of the field and upon thy Valley
[15:41] shalt thou go and thus shall thou eat
[15:43] all the days of thy life
[15:47] foreign
[15:49] [Music]
[16:47] himself
[16:48] [Music]
[17:09] but he was a beast he was all animals
[17:14] shall I go and thus shall I eat all the
[17:17] days of thy life
[17:20] the serpent was a one-of-a-kind animals
[17:27] I don't believe there was a Mr and Mr
[17:30] serpenter
[17:33] but this serpent was male
[17:37] a male Beast
[17:39] it was it was created for this very
[17:42] purpose foreign
[17:51] [Music]
[17:57] [Music]
[18:20] foreign
[18:28] [Music]
[18:59] it's why the servant was able to be was
[19:04] able to be uh
[19:05] seduced himself
[19:12] to approach the woman
[19:22] you say in order to even come close to
[19:25] believing this
[19:29] surely God would have done it somewhere
[19:31] else in the Bible
[19:34] because there's got to be a pattern
[19:38] as you read in the Book of Jonah because
[19:50] a World's Fair in Kentucky I believe it
[19:53] was
[19:54] and as he was walking with some people
[19:57] and a tour guide
[20:02] they walked in front of the skeleton of
[20:05] a whale
[20:09] and the tour guide said this is the
[20:12] largest whale in the world
[20:17] it is so many 100 and some feet long
[20:23] many many times
[20:27] and this is the skeleton of that whale
[20:34] he says but if you'll notice
[20:37] throat on this whale
[20:49] [Music]
[20:51] he says and I'm sure some of you have
[20:54] read the whole
[20:56] fables
[20:58] that Jonah was swallowed by a great by a
[21:02] whale
[21:04] well as you can see you are witnesses
[21:08] right now
[21:09] then it's impossible it's impossible for
[21:12] a whale to swallow a man Brothers
[21:56] [Music]
[22:03] could have swallowed a railroad
[22:33] [Music]
[22:36] that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[22:39] today and foreign
[22:55] [Music]
[23:08] in the line read the books of the Bible
[23:14] that God had to show someone these
[23:17] things
[23:23] and Genesis
[23:31] and the vision he's seen that has audio
[23:36] to it
[23:38] long before there was televisions
[23:41] God gave the prophet's Vision
[23:44] [Music]
[23:46] something they would see
[23:49] us
[23:53] and God wants to give us a vision
[23:57] he wants you to see it
[23:59] I'm able to hear it
[24:02] to catch Revelations
[24:05] so here in Genesis
[24:09] Moses are speaking foreign
[24:13] at this at this Throne of judgment
[24:18] and in verse 14 of Genesis 3
[24:22] Moses says
[24:24] Moses was speaking he's telling us the
[24:28] stories
[24:36] just like you might watch a video
[24:39] you see the people in the video
[24:44] that's exactly how Moses
[24:48] that's how all the prophets of God
[24:54] it's like they were right there the day
[24:57] it happened
[25:00] but he wasn't there today
[25:13] foreign
[25:46] Genesis 3 14.
[25:48] and the Lord God said unto the serpenter
[25:52] because thou has done this place each
[25:55] day Thou Art cursed above
[25:58] and above every beast of the field of
[26:01] animals
[26:12] and the world doesn't see it and the
[26:16] denominations
[26:17] [Music]
[26:31] [Music]
[26:36] the teaching of the seat of the serpent
[26:39] couldn't be more clear
[26:43] and the first time that term was
[26:48] right here in verse 14.
[26:52] and God said to the serpenter and I will
[26:56] put enmity between thee and the woman
[27:00] and between nicely
[27:07] so that's the serpency
[27:11] as I said and her said
[27:19] bruise
[27:25] and God was bringing judgment
[27:29] it was the first Throne of
[27:32] judgments but it won't be the last
[27:35] the next one at the end the answer 25.
[27:42] true
[28:00] God is a god of Holiness
[28:02] and his children had torn the veil of
[28:06] Holiness
[28:09] and God won't have his children walking
[28:12] around naked
[28:17] his daughters walking around in shorts
[28:23] wearing clothing so tight it looks like
[28:26] they were hoarding them
[28:30] since the beginning of Genesis
[28:33] God close them
[28:35] he took off the clothing that they
[28:38] thought was good enough
[28:41] remember Adam and Eve took thick leaves
[28:47] and they tried to cover themselves
[28:49] a little
[28:55] people on the beaches of today
[29:03] and God said no not for my children
[29:15] and the Lord God said to verse 22.
[29:19] the man has become as one of us to know
[29:22] good and evil
[29:24] is
[29:31] had a choice
[29:37] they had a choice
[29:40] to become like God
[30:36] what man had become like
[31:06] [Music]
[31:28] [Music]
[31:37] let my church foreign
[32:03] and he drove out the men and he placed
[32:06] him at the east of the Garden of Eden
[32:08] cherubins he hit the joke was
[32:14] and a flaming sword which turned every
[32:16] way to keep the way of the Tree of Life
[32:18] United's father is
[32:26] this is where John's Vision comes in
[32:30] here in verse
[32:32] when Adam lost
[32:35] he lost the book of
[32:39] eternal life
[32:40] he lost a friendship with the father
[32:45] he lost his leadership
[32:50] to go to Maestro he lost everything
[32:55] and he was drove out of the presence of
[32:57] God
[32:59] but there's a detail that that John
[33:02] added when he seen the vision
[33:04] one of them
[33:08] act in Revelations five
[33:11] and when John saw this scene of the
[33:15] throne
[33:17] well God saw when John saw Adam and Eve
[33:21] had been put out of the Throne of God
[33:24] [Music]
[33:26] from the point of view that God allowed
[33:29] John to look
[33:32] that Moses didn't say the most John
[33:36] looks back to Genesis
[33:38] of Hennessy after God had put his
[33:41] children out of his presence
[33:45] he says I saw I saw in the right hand of
[33:49] him you mean that
[34:01] [Music]
[34:16] that there was nothing written on the
[34:18] back side
[34:21] that everything
[34:23] word
[34:29] everything had to be within the
[34:31] atonement that was made for us
[34:36] nothing could be outside of Christ
[34:40] and after 1963.
[34:49] where the comma is placed right now is
[34:53] grammatically correct
[34:55] for the men who wrote it where we were
[34:58] men of great understanding
[35:04] they were men who studied languages
[35:16] prophetic
[35:24] opinion
[36:03] and when he read it and after 1963.
[36:10] he said and I saw on the right hand of
[36:12] him that sat on the throne a book
[36:14] written Within
[36:23] and on the back side seal with Seven
[36:26] Seals
[36:28] it changes the whole meaning can't be
[36:31] another significant there's nothing
[36:33] written on the backside now
[36:36] we went from reading something that was
[36:39] grammatically
[36:44] correctly corrected foreign
[37:22] [Music]
[37:48] he begins to descend foreign
[38:21] foreign Lucifer offered them a real
[38:25] religion loses
[38:28] [Music]
[38:34] it was supposed to be a shortcut and I
[38:37] thought
[38:40] a shortcut to what God has promised them
[38:44] already
[38:45] that's what an unjust Steward does
[38:49] uh
[38:53] that's what an unjust story
[39:00] foreign
[39:05] [Music]
[39:14] [Music]
[39:30] how much wheat
[40:05] they're putting them in the same
[40:07] condition that they are in
[40:12] because why would you want normally half
[40:15] your sins forgiven that's what I've been
[40:17] thinking
[40:18] Jesus Christ
[40:24] [Applause]
[40:29] but religions and denominations today
[40:34] they want to say I'll forgive you the
[40:37] half right now
[40:38] you don't even have to pray
[40:42] you don't you don't have to come to
[40:45] church just on Sundays
[40:52] foreign
[40:55] [Applause]
[41:50] if he could get them
[42:00] [Music]
[42:26] Lucifer put his finger in God's face
[42:54] there's something that you don't
[42:56] understand this
[42:59] whenever
[43:38] [Music]
[43:40] yeah mankind has fallen so low
[43:44] we can't go to him no problem
[43:52] [Music]
[43:52] s
[43:59] that was Revelations
[44:05] [Music]
[44:07] Revelations
[44:14] with the book that Adam lost
[44:28] and bring this word
[44:32] for the Salvation
[44:35] and then God
[44:41] and John said one thing is the next
[44:44] thing he sees
[44:46] he says I saw a strong angels
[44:52] foreign
[45:40] [Music]
[46:20] what he didn't understand
[46:24] foreign
[47:00] [Music]
[47:05] and one of the elders say them to me
[47:08] there are many Revelations five and five
[47:13] weep not
[47:15] behold the line of the tribe of Judah
[47:20] the root of David
[47:21] and prevailed to open the program
[47:24] and to lose
[47:30] [Music]
[47:37] [Music]
[47:40] Jesus
[48:10] [Music]
[48:38] that's Jesus
[48:41] that's the first coming of Christ
[48:43] Revelations
[48:56] [Music]
[49:10] the Bible says here in verse 5.
[49:23] that it was Jesus
[49:30] [Music]
[49:45] the book was first
[49:47] opening an entire Jesus Christ
[49:59] here it is remember this one point if
[50:02] nothing else
[50:21] [Music]
[50:31] we're included
[50:48] [Music]
[51:18] [Music]
[51:31] there is
[51:36] [Applause]
[51:44] Jesus Christ
[51:49] Israel
[51:57] because this line of the tribe of Jews
[52:00] he came to his own people first
[52:06] his disciples through the people of the
[52:09] Apostles he gave them a commandment
[52:12] go only to the house of Israel
[52:15] only to the lost sheep of Israel
[52:24] your only your commission is only to
[52:27] Israel
[52:28] Jewish people
[52:30] that was the line of the tribe of Judah
[52:33] the Lions
[52:36] Israel Israel but with Israel rejected
[52:43] these Seven Seals
[52:51] with the Shadows of the Old Testament
[52:55] we're blinded they couldn't see it
[52:59] and what did they reject
[53:02] the opening of the book
[53:17] of the oldest church
[53:20] was given to the youngest
[53:24] a gentile Church
[53:56] Revelations
[53:58] Revelations
[54:02] God in Genesis
[54:08] the year was about four thousand
[54:11] dollars
[54:17] somebody's God jumps to the days of the
[54:20] Angel of the Covenant with Israel
[54:24] now verse 2 jumps to about jumps to
[54:27] about 2 000 years later
[54:31] about
[54:33] about the year 2 500.
[54:39] and then verse 5
[54:42] jumps all the way to the days of Jesus
[54:51] so from verse 1 to verse five
[55:00] thousand years
[55:03] that John takes us from verse 1 to verse
[55:06] 5.
[55:07] Oh you see how this Bible is written
[55:10] therefore
[55:17] foreign
[55:21] [Applause]
[56:17] foreign
[56:48] foreign
[57:11] [Music]
[57:29] what is said
[57:33] [Music]
[57:41] must
[57:43] as the youngest son would just get a
[57:45] blessing foreign
[58:09] God bless you and goodbye

[58:16] he's dying
[58:18] has already put the Elvis at

[58:25] is
[58:39] [Music]
[59:04] right they rejected
[59:15] [Music]
[59:25] decrease
[59:40] and in Matthew 24
[59:43] he brought to them
[59:50] when you hear the message
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:03] I want you to open your Bibles to the
[1:00:06] Book of Matthew
[1:00:09] 24.
[1:00:12] I want you to open to revelation
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:01:02] [Music]
[1:01:12] 60 years later
[1:01:15] foreign so when John sees this Vision
[1:01:19] all the way to verse 5.
[1:01:22] it already happened and he lived through
[1:01:26] it
[1:01:26] as though he lived in the day it
[1:01:29] happened
[1:01:31] he didn't have the Revelation
[1:01:35] but he was a prophet he said
[1:01:41] prophets
[1:01:53] so John was having these tremendous
[1:01:56] Visions
[1:01:59] it was all history
[1:02:14] the book you have really broke the
[1:02:16] Redemption you know how the book opens
[1:02:19] so I promise he gave he gave the first
[1:02:23] part of the opening of the book
[1:02:26] to a man called John the
[1:02:30] Baptista and he said John yeah you're
[1:02:33] the Forerunner
[1:02:34] I want you to open the book with this
[1:02:37] statement
[1:02:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:57] that was the first revelation
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:06] refilling
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:54] that high place
[1:04:19] it's the original message
[1:04:22] Jesus Christ
[1:04:36] a foreign
[1:04:48] yeah
[1:04:51] after the prophet preached the seals
[1:04:55] he says this book The Bible
[1:05:04] and he had read it already for 30 years
[1:05:16] he said I can never be the same man
[1:05:18] again
[1:05:21] book The Bible
[1:05:24] is
[1:05:34] the first coming of Christ
[1:05:46] that was The Inheritance to the
[1:05:48] firstborn
[1:05:52] just as it was in the allegory
[1:06:04] but when they reject it
[1:06:06] the message
[1:06:09] The Plan of Redemption
[1:06:13] the book of redemption
[1:06:16] when they refuse to see the seven parts
[1:06:20] of redemption
[1:06:29] represented by Jacob Crossing his arms
[1:06:33] in the tree of life
[1:06:39] agenda
[1:06:43] was given to you
[1:06:49] the vision continues
[1:06:52] and I beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:06:55] throne and of the four beasts
[1:06:57] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[1:07:00] lamb as it had been slain
[1:07:08] Seattle
[1:07:09] is
[1:07:12] verse 6 my people of faith is the
[1:07:15] ministerial change
[1:07:17] God changes again
[1:07:20] from God on the throne
[1:07:22] God changed forms
[1:07:25] and became the angel of the Covenant
[1:07:30] in verse
[1:07:35] and it becomes a man he creates himself
[1:07:39] a body
[1:07:40] creates a seed
[1:07:45] and brings forth an Immaculate birth
[1:07:51] because that that man had to be a
[1:07:53] perfect man
[1:07:56] born to the sexual desire of
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:35] and in four days
[1:08:40] [Music]
[1:09:00] to uh
[1:09:02] because this land the Passover land
[1:09:05] to be a sacrifice for the entire nations
[1:09:24] foreign
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:29] washed away
[1:10:49] in Colorado
[1:11:01] having seven horns and seven eyes
[1:11:13] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:11:16] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:11:18] throne
[1:11:22] this is Jesus
[1:11:29] the change now is not a change in
[1:11:32] foreign
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:50] after praying
[1:11:54] accepting the will of the following
[1:11:58] Jesus walked out Jesus
[1:12:03] he left this Crown in the garden
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:10] and picked up his robe of sacrifice
[1:12:18] amen so now here he is foreign
[1:13:15] overcoming power in your life
[1:13:35] [Applause]
[1:14:02] but not
[1:14:18] he came only for the Jews
[1:14:26] now he's the savior of the whole world
[1:14:30] remember when the Manchester came
[1:14:39] but when the Shepherds came
[1:14:43] when they were in the fields
[1:14:45] the constellation of angels
[1:14:52] behold this day
[1:14:56] is born a savior
[1:14:59] [Applause]
[1:15:01] Lord
[1:15:13] the book has never been called the
[1:15:16] Lion's book
[1:15:20] the book has always been called
[1:15:23] the land
[1:15:28] of salvation
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:39] and Jesus again
[1:15:41] he enters into the ministry of the Lamb
[1:15:46] of God
[1:15:49] and the Bible says in verse 7.
[1:15:54] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:15:56] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:15:58] throne
[1:16:03] you see now the book is being taken for
[1:16:07] the second time
[1:16:11] Israel
[1:16:21] that was Isaiah at the first coming of
[1:16:24] Christy
[1:16:39] now jumps ahead in time again
[1:16:44] verse six I think what I'm saying it was
[1:16:46] actually just days later
[1:16:49] it's Jesus
[1:16:54] jumps all the way to the 20th century
[1:16:59] when the lamb took the book on the right
[1:17:03] hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:17:12] the days of Jesus
[1:17:19] foreign
[1:18:07] I will give you the revelation Allah
[1:18:30] and he came and took the book out of the
[1:18:33] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:18:34] throne
[1:18:38] so from verse
[1:18:42] is God back in Genesis
[1:18:45] and verse 7.
[1:18:48] almighty God
[1:18:50] in 1963.

[1:19:26] which are the prayers
[1:19:29] and they sung a new song
[1:19:33] Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:19:37] and to open the skills
[1:19:51] he was just
[1:20:15] the book
[1:20:17] s
[1:20:21] for that was slain because
[1:20:36] this is a scene of the Throne of God
[1:20:39] foreign

[1:21:26] Earth
