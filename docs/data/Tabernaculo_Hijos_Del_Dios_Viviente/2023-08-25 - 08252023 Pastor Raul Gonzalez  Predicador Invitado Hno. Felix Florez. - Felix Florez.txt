any of there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelieving departing from the Living God remember today we're in a day of confusion there are many voices the prophet of God said in his message the voice of God in these last days but even with all those limitations well false voices or false prophets those all those things are not today but Jesus said even then if anyone here's my voice and follows me remember what the word says listen to his Commission that works when you hear my voice today we're here to hear his voice we're here to hear his voice that shows that his voice is going to be there in the midst he still has a voice these boys will stay there forever and it is here Heaven and Earth shall pass but my voice shall never pass again that's why we hear his voice do not Harden your heart today could be your last day today could be the last night the last service listen carefully to what God wants from us something that my Lord likes something that he likes very much is for us to do his will that's what he's looking for the Holy Spirit sometimes we make him sad but today we're here few a small flock but without this card anxious to hear his voice and God has chose a special vessel and that's what we're here for let us receive the word today that our precious brother Felix Felix Flores listen to the voice of Our Lord you could have a very great blessing I'm glad that you came you heard the voice of the Lord this is the vessel that God is going to use today to him May the glory and honor may the Lord bless you brother we're happy to be in the house of the Lord I give thanks to God first of all for allowing us to be here this evening thanks to God and brother Raul for the invitation we are very happy for the brothers that came from Greeley Roberto his wife thanks speak to God for it how many of us are happy let us pray this is our heads beloved God we are happy with you Lord for your infinite that you have given to each one of us we give you thanks Lord bless your children unless each one of them I ask you and Heavenly Father I ask you permission to reach your word give me the inspiration in these short words that I will be speaking identification of our souls we ask at all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in every evil spirit in the name of Lord Jesus Christ victory for your church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you my name is know that God exists and he is real and God allows us to see his wonders Romans 8 1 it is in the name of the Lord Jesus there is therefore now no connection to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit City problem uh each year of that lamb of that lamb could only cover their sins and faults you will not erase them to Paradise foreign that's why the word of God says in first Timothy without uh great is the mystery of godliness this is manifested in in flesh deals in a fullness in the Lord Jesus Christ that's right when we see okay the Jesus Christ is baptized the Holy Ghost comes to him and guides him to the desert but God Came To Duel in that Tabernacle in its fullness it was God in Jesus Christ 100 it is that's why when the Lord Jesus Christ is Guided by the spirit to the death and we see that he begins to tempt him and we realize that Jesus Christ Our Lord the prophet tells us Jesus is the US Jesus is Satan eliminated him with any movement but he went to a very simple way that he did that Jesus defeated Satan with the words showing that the Christians the weakest Christian with this very same word of God That Power Authority has been it has been delegated to the church God has delegated it to each one of us that's what when we see here Jesus Christ takes it takes a perfect sacrifice in Hebrews 2 12 this is for as much then as the children are partakers of the Flesh and Blood he also himself thy wise took part of the same that through death he might destroyed him that have the power of death that is the devil the king says verse 15 and deliver them who through fear of death where all their lifetimes subject to bondage that's why we realize that Jesus Christ at the cross the perfect sacrifice will realize when Jesus Christ dies in a certain manner in a certain way the death of the Lord Jesus Christ the most tremendous part was that Gethsemane okay because the Bible says that Jesus wasn't anguished and he was crying if this cup can pass for me but if he's not my will by your will yes he wasn't so much anguish that blood he was uh shredding blood and we realize that God cannot die and Jesus was found alone at that moment his body was left in the grave and his soul who goes to hell but Jesus Christ begins to go down into hell we realize I can't imagine myself because Jesus Christ was descending I can imagine going deep into the darkness and when Jesus [Applause] in the Book of James took Christ and I realize that when Jesus Christ descends it was like a great country and no one could stop him no one couldn't stop the Lord Jesus how many of us believe in God last week they took a lady to a church and when she was sitting at the front and I began to speak what Jesus did when he descended into hell through that woman yeah that screams from Hell came out because Satan and his demons know this moment Jesus Christ Our Lord I get so emotional okay because I know for him that God is real and alive through his word left us a message I can imagine yes through his people I want God to be in me the message his children is a living message God healed her husband she said I had a problem I have a tumor in my head is a very intense pain I need eighty thousand dollars to take it out and I said sister we're gonna pray for you tomorrow and God is going to heal you and we pray to her and foreign she would send me a message United States for illness and God uh backs his word schizophrenia and when they go to the psychiatrist they go to a psychologists because there's a lot of people claim to believe the message and they deny that Jesus Christ is something psychological we have seen many cases it's all been destroyed a lot of things Revelation 1 17. and he laid his right hand upon me saying not to be fear not I am the first and the last yeah and I am he that liveth and what's dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death I ask myself sometimes people who are ignorante who worship deaths why don't they worship the one who overcame death we worship him and he said because I live We Shall Live also we see that the very same word in the book of Science in Romans 8. the reason foreign there will help escape from him we have escaped from hell yeah the prophet says all of us you would be a the Rapture had already happened but I read something interesting the messenger said foreign foreign know the opening of the seals when the lamb stands up around the place of intercession no one else would be safe anymore Jesus Christ we are waiting for him lose the essence of the transformation of our bodies foreign is but doesn't take away Jesus Christ has Justified our past we are in justification there's people who sometimes get baptized when I stop doing these things will you baptize the man who smokes that is a problem with the preachers when he descended everything was because of us of the Lamb when you are under the blood not I mean I know that all of us understand in the message adoption the prophet says many times and tomorrow I'm safe tomorrow we know that we have a message we know that we are in in the climax and the messenger said this is you cannot get lost if God called us before nation of the world the happiness he is the matter is fixed it was concluded there is no condemnation this is the religious world he wants to give salvation to make give main salvation through fasting through prayer with Jesus Christ who conquered the world at 33 years old Jesus Christ community don't be afraid you are Heirs of everything Cristiano look at the Moon who created that our creator Lord is it possible that's mine too everything is ourselves because everything has been given to me if Satan put something in the church is fear foreign I know that all of us have a lot of testimonies foreign [Music] that's why we realize this is the Lord says foreign all the members of the Lord Jesus Christ foreign my foreign but love and courage and ability all power is given unto me and in this years to use you speak the word and I will perform it that is my Covenant and it can never failure the greatest thing that I find against the church tonight is to fear about something let me tell you we're a group personas of people maybe some of us if I die who's going to take care of my children and if tomorrow I don't have work anymore what am I gonna do and if I get sick there's a lot of fears going around but there's one who tells us not to fear okay because he will be with us until the end of the world [Music] if a man has been born again he should be happy and not worry like this man saying yes we know that God takes control of Our Lives you have control of tomorrow you have control of tonight you know that's why the prophet said no the brothers the denominational Brothers sometimes they want to be safe through fasting through watching it's a great long prayers to Jesus give us that there's hundreds or thousands foreign e fficiently yes [Music] somebody give they contact us through other people and we know thousands of cases every day at night I get happy and I said brother sister foreign Eternal God let us pray let us pray I don't understand where you're at any trouble you may have place it before the Lord at this moment many people have called me and told me where I was sitting at we have the word we don't have just anything we have the word Jesus Christ is the midst of us one day we will disappeared in His Holy Spirit
