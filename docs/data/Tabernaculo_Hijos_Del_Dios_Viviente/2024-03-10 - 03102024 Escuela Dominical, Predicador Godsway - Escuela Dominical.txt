TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus Christ and you look how why should it be a donkey but not a horse or a chariot but we saw a donkey is Meek and humble and that is an attitude required of we who call our Christians you need to be meek we need to be meek need to and Obey and when we do that then we saw that Jesus was riding on the donkey and that's what we want our life to be that Jesus is riding on us not man need to die to their own self I would like to read something maybe I'll will read from Ephesians 422 I don't know if you are there we are still talking about self yeah why we need to put our way self you know y night yesterday yeah I posted something I posted something um um and I was thinking I P Christianity is sacrifice and I was reasoning about it and I said Christ died and that is a sacrifice Jesus did for us and the sacrifice we need to do is to die to ourself and live for Christ that is what is being required of us if we call our Christians and I'm reading that you put off concerning the foral conversation the old man ior you know problem which is corrupt according to the deceitful last and be renewed in the Spirit of your mind so you have the old man and that old man is yourself and the other time we saw that we saw that no Christianity is not about doing good yeah doing good is very important Christianity is not good morals but good morals is very important but you know in addition of the good morals we need to see the authority of Jesus Christ in your life no people a lot of people think I might make it to the kingdom of but if I do it right if you could go back into the Bible look at this Young Rich Young Ruler he said I obeyed all the Ten Commandments since infancy you know when he came to Jesus he wanted salvation and Jesus said go obey the Ten Commandments so I've been doing that since I was a [Music] child he was a just man according to the law but he missed something it's what there is authority of Jesus Christ in his life but Jesus saw the problem of this Rich Young Ruler and he told me go and sell whatever you have and he said where am man where a man's heart where a man heart is or where a man's desire is that's where his heart is and the Rich Young Ruler look at his status status who he was he said I'm going to sell my gos and and come and follow this man no way he was looking at himself and come and carry my cross and follow this man often times says something I love so much he said for the selling of the goose for the Rich Young Ruler to sell his resources and give it to the poor that was not a problem for him but for him to carry his cross and follow Jesus Christ that was his problem and often time that is our problem we want to worship God but we want to do it our own way we want to follow God but we want to do it our own way but my brother my sister if you want to follow God they need to die to yourself and you need to let God lead you you need to let God direct you and you know whenever we come to Christianity there's a price to be paid Jesus paid a price to Redeem Me And You from our sins but for me and you we also need to pay a price by dying to ourself dying to our freedom dying to our right right and living a Lifest as a Christian that is what is required of us today I made my mind to finish very early today I made my mind to finish very early and I want to read something from colians 3:9 yeah 39 Oh 39 yeah 39 yeah 39 I know you need to know the old self and the Deeds of the self so that when you are living your life you get to know that what I'm doing is not the deed of the self but is the is the deed of Jesus Christ in me I'm reading lie not one to another seeing that ye put off the old [Music] man with his deeds we we have we all read the scripture I hope everybody is following and the Bible is telling me and you that we should not lie to our own self we should not deceive one another seeing that seeing ye have put off the old man and this is like is an instruction it's an instruction when is telling us that we need to put off the old man and what is the old man it is the old nature of you andam said don't be deceived because the old nature of a man know how to do good the old nature of a man also comes to church also give things to people don't be deceived but you need to make sure you have put off that old man that old man if they talk about your sins you are angry that old man of quick temper that old man of impatience that old man of condemning people you have to make sure you put off that old man and that same with his deeds with his deeds is not only the old man it's not only the old man only the old man yeah yeah that is is not about putting away the old man oing but along with his deeds that me it's not only about your nature but that nature of yours need to be taken away completely and everything associated with the old man should be taken away from you and some are H are some of the nature or the attitude or the de of the old man eny Envy Envy Envy or jealous impatience fornication adultery and most importantly Disobedience to the word of God that is the most important thing said no fornication is not a sin but sin means unbelief because you don't believe in the word of God that is the reason why you do those stuffs because all these stuffs they are just an attribute of sin but if you believe the word of God there is no way you're going to go against the word of God so the most important thing is to obey the word of God and now I'll become a bad person if I tell you you should put away your old nature and I don't tell you how to get a new nature and because of that I'll let us to open to the Book of Matthew chapter 16 vers 24 and see what Jesus is expecting from us you know you have to tell the people where they are and show them where they have to be and tell them in between who can help them get there and I us to tell you ask for me I can't help you I can't have even myself it's only Jesus that can help us I'm read Matthew 16:4 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me so if you want to go after Jesus then let's see the condition Jesus is given if any come after me let him deny himself that if you want to follow Christ then you need to deny yourself of your right your freedom your thinking everything to Christ to take control If any man will come after me let him deny him himself does it end up denying does it end with denying yourself let's look at what Jesus is saying after denying yourself take up his cross not take up your cross not take up your cross you deny yourself then you take out the cross of Jesus Christ The Suffering of Jesus Christ the suffering of standing for the word of God the suffering that comes with don't neglect your children the suff that come with you need to make sure the devotion is being done in the house the the suffering and devotion need to be done in the houseing right the suffering that you have to be patient when somebody is annoying you the suffering that you have to St away from the alcohol bottles when you want to drink the suffering that need to love your wife there suffing you need to submit to your husband that is the cross you have to carry if you want to go after Jesus you deny yourself to deny yourself is to take away all your rights take away all your freedom then let Christ take over if the word of God says this if the word of God says this then you do exactly and that is where we want to come to point that it is the authority of Jesus Christ in our life that your lifestyle is not about you but it's about Jesus Christ you know you know the apostles they had their their name Christians in Antioch because of the life they were living people of Antioch look at these people and said these people are the indeed the Disciples of Christ and for that matter we call them Christians that means if you call ourself Christians then we need to live like Christ so we die to ourselves then we start living like Christ by so doing It Is by so doing it is by so doing that we can show to the world we are the disciple of Christ Jesus and I said let him deny himself and take out his cross without and just taking your cross but what and follow me so die to yourself pick up your cross the way I like music the way I like wly music the the way you like what the way I like wly music the way you like wly music yeah yeah wedding wedley yeah and you look at this wly music you like and look at the wedding music you like yeah and you you look at the word of God they so I'm throwing it away from today on from today onwards from today onwards today and I want to follow Christ from today on I want Christ to be my king you know it's difficult and your friends will see you and your friends will see you and they will be pointing hands at you remember you are carrying the cross and your friends you might you might have been the best singer or the best dancer whatever you might be the best and we have to come to the point and said today and said today I'm letting it go and I want to follow Christ everybody need to pay a price Jesus paid a price by dying on the cross for me and and me and you need to pay the price of dying to ourself and carrying the cross and follow Jesus and you know often times we we tend to complain when we are not carrying the cross because the cross is heavy and if we are carrying the cross you don't get time to be looking around to be seeing what other people do but because we are not carrying the cross we are just F our eyes looking at what people are doing and try to and try to measure our Christianity by how people live their life I said don't justify your don't justify your sins by how people live their life don't justify ourselves yeah your sins by how people live your oh your sins no and don't measure your Christianity and don't measure your Christianity by how other people live their life you know um no me what by how people live their life the standard is Jesus Christ the standard is Jesus Christ so you ask yourself is this in line with the gospel it doesn't matter how you think it's right I used to see it doesn't matter how it is how it makes sense as long as it's against the word of God you have to forget about it because it is dangerous to be against God is very dangerous and to be against God is as simple as disobeying the word of God and often times I was just listening to a sermon yesterday a sermon and one Pastor said he said if somebody go fornicate if somebody and he come to the church and tell the church and you drive more than the speed limit and you two come to the church and tell the church I drove more than the speed limit I drove more than the speed limit I being woman we being wom we will be we be human like we sitting here we think the person want fornicate did a greater thing than the person who went above the speed limit did greater yeah in the presence of God there there is no category of sin there's no what there's no category for sin whether you went to fornicate you lied or you want more than the speed limit oh but said said we should obey the speed limit I was reading yester night we say even the scriptures say we should obey those who are in Authority so if we are Christians you have to make sure that we are doing as the scripture has commanded that is what makes us special that What Makes Her different I know you have to face all the time our eyes on Jesus to our die to ourselves and other time like for people to take inventory or rest restriction of their life people to take to like examine yourself since I decided to worship God and ask yourself since I decide to worship God is this the old me or there has been a transformation you know yesterday I was reading something from Chronicles he said there was this man called yeah second chronicles called Amia Amia I think that's second chronicles I forgotten and this Amia became a King when he was a child became a king yeah and he ruled for 29 years and he did what was perfect in the eyes of the Lord oh another said he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord but not with a perfect heart and I was wondering how can a man do what is right in the sight of the Lord but without a perfect heart so it means you can walk in here each and every day thinking you are coming to worship God but your heart might not be right but if your heart is right your attitude is going to be right and for your heart to be righted you need to have Jesus in there Jesus is in your heart your thinking will be right and if you're thinking is right your attitude is going to be right and it's very dangerous and I was I was examining myself and I was looking because I'm scriptures are for you to examine yourself you might be doing the right thing you might be doing the right thing that is all right but that what is the motive behind you doing the right thing is it because you want to let people know you know how to do it you see how man often time want to please himself you know said one of the demons that was cut from The Prostitute woman Mary meline one of them was pride and how did say he say because she es herself better than others and how many how how many have we Este oursel better than others simple you see how simp sometime it can be what you see how simple how it can be how or how simple it can be just thinking to be better than somebody is sin and that the reason why examine ourself why am I doing this why am I doing this is it because I want to please the people or it's because God has told me to do it and you know if you try with your experience you are going to fail if you try with your your strength we are going to fail know could you imagine this Moses could you imagine this Moses training in the house of pharaoh but he knew who he was but he know that this Israelite are my brothers and says Moses saw a Phil saw an Egyptian beating a an Israelite and he went to save him but he killed the person in the process but he the you see when man triy to do it himself and what happened to Moses he ran away but when Moses met God and that's what said every Christian have to make sure he has made God side of the desert at the back side of the desert every Christian have to make sure he got the upper room experience The Upper Room experience when the apostles when the apostles were gathered on the day of Pentecost and the Holy Ghost came and filled the room and said every Christian is not in the pastor you know I've come to realize that most church members MERS think think the Bible is fing the pastor is what is fing the pastor following is is foring the pastor but the word of God is not for the pastor it's for you and so whenever the pastor is [Music] speaking he his work is to bring the word of God that is for you to you and you have to also see yourself that is God bringing me a message then if you see it like that it w be you just coming to church but whenever you come to church you know that God is going to speak to you and when God speaks to you it's just come to turn something around he's coming to turn something around to change and make you a better person said whenever you go to church there are two things you either go home a worse person or a better person but the choice depends on you whether you want to go home a better person whe whether you want to go home a better person or a worst person it all depends on you you said when Joshua after Joshua was old and he was about to die then he gathered the people and brought them and he said choose this day this day day who you will worship either the god of the Amorite or the god of the Egyptians or the god of the Philistines or the god of the most high but as for me and my household but as for me and my household we will serve the Lord and I want all husbands all family head to make that decision in their house and say as for me and my household we serve the Lord and that to be our desire that God have to be the king of our house God has be God has to be the ruler of my house and whatever we are doing you are going to do it because you have seen God directed us and it is our responsibility to stand for God know that time I read of the Danny Greenfield Dan Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield how he was a great American evangelist and he preached the word and one day he in a dream he saw that he's dead he saw that he was dead and he was yeah and he appear the Throne of God and his name was not found in the book and he said check well I'm Daniel Greenfield a great American evangelist I said no Dan Greenfield your name cannot be found here but I'll urge you to go before the great white Throne to plead your case and he said as I approve the great white Throne as I approached the G there came a big white big light and from the light proceeded a voice so who approaches my throne and he said my Lord I'm Daniel Greenfield I went and my name is not in the book and I was directed to come and plead my kids before you and he asked Daniel Greenfield have have you ever lied have you ever lied I said at that moment at that moment everything was so clear that all that I said was yes Lord I li said some be anything so much that people consider be like your brother will call you hello brother H my sister where are you and you you are not going to Bath you are not going to Bath you're not going to you are not going to take your bath yeah you're not going yeah or you tell the person oh I'm I'm I'm I'm coming I just sat in the car meanwhile you haven't taken your bath yet meanwhile you have you are not going to Bath mean you are not going to Bath yeah so you're going to take a bath meanwhile meanwhile you are telling the brother that you are in the car coming but you're taking a okay sometimes it be anything he can just ask for my husband you like disturbing too much as for my husband he like disturbing too much as my husband he he likes to he like disturbing too much [Music] disturbing that's what the pastor says all the time as little as this as L as this you might think it is but Dani Greenfield said in the presence of that light there's nothing that too little Daniel Greenfield Danfield have you ever steal have there up there up there I saw that I've stolen before how do you still I come to church every day some of you don't pay your tight what some of you don't pay your tight some and if you don't pay your ti you are stealing God's money nobody is going to force you but some Stu could be as simple as like this and then geld say something he said then I saw of a little shady deals I pulled of a little shady de I pulled which was not right you can do some things and by your status by your stat by who you are who are people say anything about it but remember it's not people's judgment so ask yourself is this right in the act of God all the time we should ask yourself because Daniel Greenfield they didn't kill they didn't fornicate he didn't kill he didn't fornicate he didn't go to rob a bank but that day he saw that he has done all these St that little sh deals that you don't care about that you think it is normal everybody does it muring muring or complaining my wife is like that oh my husband is like that instead of you to pray for your husband for your don't serious she just little make sure you put everything right last week I showed you in the message how sister Rebecca prayed for his wife his husband and his Husband changed I was telling the power of prayer so if you have something worrying you go to God about it why don't you just go to God and say God ask for me my temper God have mercy on me oh God work on it for me and don't be worried because after praying the next moment your wife will annoy you your hus will annoy you that is how it is but you have to remember God is working on you and you don't don't see you need to Bear the pain you need to Bear the pain suffering to overcome and go to God say God the more I pray about it the more I pray about it

accountability be responsible for their life parent let's try to do our best say we should not leave our little ones behind for our Father in heaven have them in mind some are we some are we but let's
