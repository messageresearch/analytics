TRANSCRIPT
========================================
fore amen amen Yia morning and it's it was what P what when [Music] just [Music] Pasa we are saved because of Easter because what happened during Easter because what happening Easter during Easter that we had the death we had a death burier of Jesus Christ and is because of that sacrifice Jesus did that's why me and you are alive today so we shouldn't be worried if you indeed we call we are the followers of Jesus Christ then we should be the happiest people on Earth David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord I don't know if we happy to find yourself in the house of the Lord too because you know often times people thinks it is a person that can help them but I want to tell that if God does not put it on the person's heart the person can do anything for you and if somebody's to difficult somebody is too difficult remember it is God that's why Amos 33 we say Amos 33 OS 33 333 yeah 33 33 I'm not reading but I'm paraphrasing when you read from the 3 to the S he said have they be any evil in the city that I the Lord God has not done it you said verse S right yeah and you know if somebody is difficult you don't worry about that person because God told Moses he said it is I the Lord it is I the Lord that has hardened the heart of pharaoh that the power of God will be seen so we shouldn't be worried as long as we stay in the promise of God and the promise of God is the message of this hour and the message of this hour is going to take her to our Lord Jesus Christ times we see Christians complaining I see God is dead it didn't start today after God delivering Israel from Egypt through the Red Sea now to the W these people were not complaining oh Moses you brought us here for us to die because they were demanding just for common food they have forgotten what God has done for them and they have lost faith in God and when a man lose faith in [Music] God he start complaining he start saying a whole lot of things and that said that is the nature of a man man is all the time grateful for God for what he has done for him yesterday and he's hoping for what God will do for him tomorrow but what God is doing for him today he fail to appreciate so this people was mming against Moses and they were complaining now they were Desiring back to go to Egypt but you know but the scriptures said said these things were our example that we should not repeat what the the people of Israel did in the wilderness what is our example that the Bible was talking about is to get to the point to lose faith in God and when a man lose faith in God he turns now to rely on people and you know there's nobody that can help you if God does not put it on his heart you know this morning I would like us to look at this topic Faith the topic fa and how important is faith in the Christian journey and why every Christian need to live by faith and look at some is our example so that we know what God have for us shall open our Bible to Hebrews chapter 11 from verse one I'll read as much as I can read verse one now Faith is the sub of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it for by it the ERS obtain a good report through faith we understand that the word were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of were not made of things which do not appear do appear by faith Abel offered unto God more excellent sacrifice than King by which he obtained witness that was he was righteous God testify of his gift and by it being dead yet speak and by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see de and was not found because God has translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God verse six but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that come to God has believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of that diligent seek him God bless you shall we pray Lord come and bless us this morning with in Jesus name we pray amen shall I be seated I want to continue reading and by faith Noah be one of not seen as yet moved with fear prepare an act to the saving of his house by the by by the which he condemned the word and became hair of righteous which is by faith no somebody might be thinking no I have just been reading I have just been reading some sort of scriptures and all we hear is about faith faith faith but to want to dive into it we want to go into it we want to go into Faith so that the benefit that these people that we have talked about received in the scriptures we also receive as followers of Jesus Christ no we have read we started with his something that you don't see to believe something that you don't see and that is what is what is that is what is difficult for a lot of people but said faith is not anything to difficult or complicated but even you just having fa that if I sleep I wake up even you believing that if you sleep you wake up that is Faith you know we going to look at the lifestyle of Abraham which if you want to read you can find in Genesis CH 12 verse 1-4 if you read if you want okay let me read it Genesis CH 12 vers 1 to4 to see how sometimes strangely it might be because when it comes to things of faith it is not usual it is not how we do things normal it's like somebody is dead for three days and I come and tell you this person is going to resurrect it it's against all ODS of life it's against all C of life and I don't think anybody in the right human adamic sense will accept to believe what I'm saying because the person has been dead for three days because the person has been dead for three [Music] days but Faith Can Do It it see sometime how faith is being wrapped onto you it's not how you want to see it you want see it let's just imagine what happened in Genesis now the Lord has said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy father house onto a land that I will seal thee no look at how look at how the scripture go you meet a stranger who you don't know who you can't see then talking to you he said leave your house leave your family leave everything you have and go to a place even the place he didn't mention the name sometimes this how the move of Fai is this how the moon of fi is because it's very strange and look at what he added in the verse two and I'll make thee a great nation and I'll bless thee and make thy name great and that shall be a blessing Abraham was in his father's house Abraham was in his father's house move you should leave everything behind and move then you'll be a great nation look at the difference look at it you know if I want to be great maybe my father has gained enough resources my father has gain enough resources then me to then me I also build on that resources build and I'll be a great person but this where you are telling me I should leave my house leave my father no leave everything and go to somewhere you are going to show me that I don't even know whether where I'm going I'm going to get food or I'm not going to get food no let's ask ourself what will I do this morning if I was abrah what will I do this morning if I was Abraham know often times the word of God comes to us the word of God come to us but when that word of God come to us it doesn't suit what we want it doesn't suit like you don't feel okay it doesn't go the way you want it to go and that is how all the time it has been because God is an unusual God and he does that is contrary to the understanding of men imagine isah saying a virgin shall conceive let's take all joke aside let's take all joke aside all joke yeah yeah imagine Pastor comes to church and tell you a virgin shall conceive in this age of Science in this age of science how many are going to believe that this how strange it is fa that we talked about but he said the reason why that word was able to manifest in the life of Mary it's because Mary tgh about it and Mary believed it and and Mary act according to it so if God's word comes to you if God's word comes to you and God tells you oh you are going to be great but to make the move and you stay at that position you haven't believe the word of God no you can't say it in your mouth you can say it in your mouth you can profess in your mouth you can or you cannot you can and everybody will be everybody can hear you can hear oh I'm a Christian I'm this that is fine but Christianity without the life is not Christianity Christianity is Living Like Jesus Christ so if we claim we believe Jesus Christ then our lifestyle to show the word Jesus Christ then I want to continue reading but I'm jumping to the verse four so Abraham departed as the Lord has spoken unto him often times how do will respond to the message of God for to Abraham For unto Abraham ABR he acted as the message came he acted as the message came the message God gave to him forsaking all foring and decide to follow God and for us me and you today this scripture being written here is not here just to give us a knowledge that there was a certain man Abraham but it we show unto us that God is going to come to us on the unusual way and God is expecting a response from us don't let us be deceived don't let us be deceived because we saw the last time that when he came for the Rich Young Ruler to sell his resources I said that wasn't difficult for him but to come to the point and follow Jesus Christ it was difficult for him and often time we don't want to pay or do the sacrifice and follow Jesus Christ Christianity is about sacrifice sometimes you need to forsake the things you love you need to forsake the things you love the things you have been living with and start AR fresh and start again with Jesus Christ you know sometimes people think I can do it my own way as long said the moment you told I could have a better way of doing it of doing it than what the Bible has said you have left God out of the equation and no man will make it if he leave God out of the equation no because no when it come to Christianity and when it come to Salvation it has nothing to do with me and you it is the work of Jesus Christ and by through that we are saved we are saved by the grace of God but as when we respond or when we believe that indeed that indeed or truly Jesus died for me then it his work we do in appreciation for what God did on the cross and not as Christians for we to be able to work in this Christian Journey we need faith and most importantly to believe completely in Christ Jesus because if you don't have faith you cannot walk with God we just read in the scripture that without faith it is impossible to please God that means a man cannot live this Christian Life without having faith in Christ we have heard several times we have heard several times heard several times that all things are possible to them that believe and as we used to sing the song only believe in order to have God in action we first need to believe bra said God is not doing anything new God but God did everything before the foundation of this Earth was laid but the only thing we need is Faith to bring that thing into existence imagine in the 1800 then somebody will say there's going to come a time that there's going to be a machine and I can just be talking to Brother Martin and I'll be seeing Brother Martin and Martin will be seeing me nobody would have believed it then they will say it is not possible they say it can happen but what do we have today this is just said this is just signs and look at what science is doing then imagine a child of God in the right position of the nature God created him he can do more than what science is doing no other time you see people or you see some preachers trying to make theirself God trying to let the people build faith in them but my brother my sister the truth is I can't do anything to help you I can't even save you I can't heal you when to ask brother Abraham or is it because you go and pray too much it's because I don't do anything it's the man living in me Jesus Christ Living in me that is doing the healing and if Jesus Christ is living in you then God is in you and if God is in you then you can create things into existence often times things are not difficult you just need to position yourself with God and have that Faith to speak the word of God to bring things into existence God has created as smaller Gods God say he has created us as smaller Gods God said he created man in his own nature and he created as small God so Adam when Adam was created Adam look at this and said we call this dog we call this cat we call this banana Adam was not there when God was creating Adam Adam didn't create with God said in the beginning before the foundation of this Earth was we were with God because we were taught in God and when God was creating we were there so if you find ourself in that position then say it and it will happen and Adam named everything that is the power God has given to us but for we to operate with that power we need to have faith in God no let me read a certain scripture from Mark 11:22 now we there oh let me start from the verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the Fig Tree dry up from the root and Peter calling to remembrance said unto him Master behold the F tree with that cast is wed away you see and Jesus answered said unto them have faith in God when you read Bible Bible story it said when Jesus spoke to the Fig Tre or if you should read up a little we could see that Jesus was hungry and he wanted something to eat but it wasn't the time for fake to yield [Music] fruits so somebody will say now if it's not a time for the F to yeld fruit why would Jesus C that F tree because it's not yet time but Jesus was the creator himself and if the Creator is in desire of something then that thing need to yield to the Creator need to yield but this victory was not yielding in said said but this this this fig tree was not yielding to the Creator and said when Jesus said the Fig Tree should dry from the root from the leaves to the root when he said it he didn't even look at the F tree again he wasn't going and thinking Hey would this happen oh what if what if then the next day and the Victory is not dead but he spoke the word and he went and when he spoke the word none of his disciples said anything but the next morning and in the morning they were passing by the same place and Peter said Master you see the tree that he ciss yesterday he has wed and dry from the root and Jesus said have faith in God for very I say unto you that whosoever shall see unto this man Mountain be thou removed be thou cast onto the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things that which he say shall come to pass he shall have faith you see often times people sit in church and people walk from the street and get their healing and get what they they want from God because the scripture over here whosoever so if somebody hears holding this scripture that God have said if I believe in him and I say this it's going to come to pass is going to happen in that person's life that is the reason why sometimes people who are not well grounded in the Christian faith look at people on the street and so even this person he doesn't comes to church he doesn't come to and he's frustrating he's frustrated he's prospering oh you know God has given his word and the word is not if the pastor the word is not if the pastor or the prophet or the preacher say the mountain moved or the preacher say the mountain move then the mountain will move by whosoever that is me and you has been given that power so if I believe that I want money then I pray to God then I believe it is going to happen if I want if you are sick if you are sick and I come to pray for you nothing is going to happen but if you believe that me praying for you you are going to get healed then when you are being prayed for you are going to get healed the power is with us that is the reason why you say greater is who that is in me than what that is in the world so you don't have to let anybody deceive you that oh if I fast for you and people believe somebody fast for me I'm going to get well or if if I pray for you you are going to get well it is good for me to help pray and fast for you when you are in need but for the faith to claim what you are looking from God is from you the Christian Journey the Christian walk or Journey no nobody can do anything to help you the best I can do is to stand here and Shout the best I can shout shout the best I can shout but the person who can do something is God that's the reason why I all the time want you to want to point you to God for you to come to that connection with God and when you get into that point with God you can get whatever you want from God you don't need you don't need anybody but we just need to talk to God and that is how Christianity is it's you and God are fath it's not you and your brother but it is good for me to remind you remember you in prayer if you are sick it is fine to tell me for me to pray for you but it is not me that is going to heal you but it is God the work is completely God no preacher no Pastor no Prophet can give salvation to me and you sometimes I say how pity when I hear people going to pay for money going to pay money pay for somebody to pray for them believing that if they pay money they are going to have salvation if they pay money they are going to get their heart desires and my brothers and sisters we should be careful about preachers prophets who project themselves to be God and pointing the people to themselves those people have nothing to give us it is only the power of God and that power of God you have it but the only thing is is but the only thing is you need to believe have faith then you operate with that power of God in you then if you need something you pray to God then God is going to give it to you you know see faith cannot be overemphasized because if I want to talk about faith yeah I'm going to talk about it every day because sleeping because sleeping and waking up but who promise you are going to wake up the next day but you believe but you believe you are going to wake up that is Faith said if we could have that faith that you can I can walk from here to here or walk back Wass that I need that same Faith to claim whatever it is to claim but do you know our problem we come to the point and said this thing I don't think God can do it we limit god with our mind ask for this ask for my sickness ask for what I'm going through I don't think and that is how the devil will all the time try to be painting the thing in such a way that you don't have faith to go to God because he knows because the devil knows when you get God and when you believe in God you do things Beyond man's understanding they came alive in Peter's life they came alive in Peter's life they came a time in Peter and they asked do you know Jesus so no no no no no no oh I don't know him I haven't even seen him before even this is the first time hearing of Jesus that was Peter that small little girl that small girl that small girl small yeah girl are you not one of them said I don't know him but when Peter had the Holy Ghost had an encounter with God had a revelation of Jesus Christ Living in him at the gate he told a man silver and gold I have none but in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk ah Peter it was Peter it was that same Peter who could not cast The Demon out of the G that was suffering the girl that was suffering from the maniac spirit Peter now is telling somebody who is crippled good I have none but in the name of Jesus Christ up and the person has resurrected and walk what makes me and you what makes me and you and Peter different is because Peter has believed in God and Peter has believed five five speak is going to happen I know what no Peter went through something he went through something because I've told you two Peter one was denying Jesus and now one is standing and speaking in the name of Jesus what is the trans transformation so then often times I us tell people if you pay the if you pay the sacrifice that Peter did you are going to have the power and authority Peter but often times we tend to jump things we tend to jump the process we we we tend not to go through the process and we just want to get to the top but it doesn't work that way Peter ran from Jesus Peter denied Jesus but Peter remembered that Jesus said they should go and wait in the upper room room yeah and Peter waited in that room waited in that room he waited in that room and what happened there was an experience something happened that's what see if you call yourself a Christian you have to come to the point there something has happened to you that you have met God that you have had an encounter with God because it is the only encounter with God that is going to change you imagine Paul who was persecuting the apostles who was persecuting killing the apostles came the next time and was preaching Jesus Christ what happened there was a transformation that he has met God that is the reason why me and you we have to make sure we have to make sure we have met God said said anyone who call himself a Christian should make sure he had one and one encounter God With Jesus Christ because it is the encounter with God that is going to give you Revelation and Revelation it is Fai and when you get that Revelation nobody can take it away from you not even the devil because you have seen God if a man see God his life he's walking he's talking his behavior is different from a man who have not seen God that is the reason why that is the reason why me and you need to make sure we have met God no coming to church is fine coming to church is fine but coming to church will not save you but if you meet God you will come to church but you can come and sit in the church and go back home the same person that how serious how things can be and that is the reason why people can look at those come to church so if I'm even better than this person that come my brother my brother my sister don't measure your Christianity by the standard of how somebody live their life in their church but understand by the standard by because the standard our standard is Jesus Christ no could you could you imagine little Moses Moses was raised by his mother in the house of pharaoh and said his mother taught Moses the things concerning how they got into Egypt so so Moses saw the people of Israel as his brothers and sisters but one day Moses saw an Israeli and Egyptian fighting Moses tried to go and save and mooses and in the process Moses Moses killed the Egyptian and braam said when we take a step without the direction of God all the time end in Misfortune and accident gonna end so what happened to Moses now Moses know that he was a deliverer you know that he he he the one who to take Israel from Egypt to the promised land but now Moses was running from Egypt young Moses energetic Moses energetic very strong strong Moses he's strong he's energetic he's running from the presence of pharaoh because now what happened he tried to save the people of Israel with his own [Music] strength and it failed it failed then go to Moses into the wildness Into the Wilderness and now said God need to take all the worldly ideas that has been imparted into Moses away and after that Moses had an encounter with God Moses now met God Moses now saw the burning bush and God spoke to him when he went close to the burning bush now Moses asked God if I go and the people ask me if what if I go and the people ask me the people of Israel ask me if they ask what is your name what should I tell them so when you have I'm also going to tell you if you get if you meet God if you have an encounter with God asking God what is the purp purpose what is the purpose or the plan that you have for me God I want to know so that I live my life as such you know often times we are living a lot of people soall people I just impersonating this is somebody who can sing and they also want to sing my brother it is very important for we to know our calling what God has raised up for it's very important because one day if you meet me and see my two hands on my head you might have run away you you might run away because normally the hand is supposed to be here because my hand is supposed to be here but you see my hand on my head which is strange that is the reason why we have to know our position in Christ so that we don't see that this person is doing this so so I'm also going to do some but we find what God have for us and glorify God it is very important now Moses after meeting God he was old and weak old and weak he's now using a stick or he's not using a stuff to walk but this Moses was going to Egypt and when they asking Moses where are you going oh I'm going to Egypt I'm going to deliver the people of Egypt the people of Israel and Moses when you even were you were 40 years you were you were running away you are not 120 [Music] weak you are not strong and during that time Egypt was the most powerful country with the elite Army that nobody you can read that Bible story they they could capture and fight and Conquer whoever they want to conquer and you see Moses holding his steak Moses where are you going I'm going to Egypt what are you going to do in Egypt you are almost dying you are almost about to die what are you going to do in Egypt I'm going to deliver the people of Israel H Moses where is your army H maybe Moses was coming with his soldiers but Moses has no Soldiers with him and he said he's going to deliver the people of Israel and that is strange why this man has met God and all those people laughing at Moses they didn't meet God with Moses they didn't meet God with Moses meet God with Moses but Moses had an encounter alone mes is not Moses is having a faith in God Moses not having a faith in God because Moses asked God what if the person ask me of a sign then say Moses Moses what do you have in your hand he said oh a steak so Moses put it on the floor it turned into a snake said really really how strange is this man he's talking from a burning bush I plac my stick on the floor and it has turned into a snake then he said Moses hold hold the tail of the snake it turned into the steak wowow what is happening the encounter with god build your faith in God that's the reason why we need to have that encounter then Moses ask another sign another one another sign God told Moses put your hand over here then remove your hand leprosy and during that time leprosy was the worst disease and Moses was and Moses go said don't worry put your hand back again now so if Moses is going to deliver the people of he has not have faith in God that the God turned the the stick to snake or the the god that made me a leper is with me is with me and Moses Was Not Afraid of the army of pharaoh that is what Encounter of God that is what faith can do for me and you my brother I want to tell you something today if you need something from God just have faith because it is written it is written in the Book of John Chapter 14 verse 14 that if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it so the only thing is for me and you for me and you to ask God and believe the only thing that we need to believe is to have faith in God he said by Said by faith faith it was counted onto Abraham as righteousness no Abraham was 90 years 90 when God let me move out of his country and God told Abraham you are going to have a son his wife Sarah was past the age of manul and God has told Abraham and God has told Abraham your wife Sarah is going to give birth to a son it takes only Faith to believe this and he said said when Abraham heard the word when brother had the word no Abraham H Abraham had the word he said he went to the shop he went to the shop and start buying baby clothes and when people see him Abraham what are you taking all this to oh God has told me I'm going to have a son like Jing your wife has passed menopause you have pass you know you are weak how can you have pleasure and give birth and they were mocking Abraham they were laughing at him but then Abraham go to the doctor with Sarah said Doctor what is the problem so oh I want you to check my wife if she's pregnant and then the doctor will say Abraham AB you need to go to the psychiatric because I'm sure something is wrong with your brain you past the age of bed you see how it is and Abraham will the Nur will come back come with his wife and the doctor say this man can worry it's because Abraham had had faith in God and said when God promised Abraham of a child it took even a longer time it took a longer time and nothing has happened my brother my sister something you have been praying to God for something you pray for one week you have prayed for two weeks you have prayed for one month you have prayed for 6 months you have prayed for one year nothing is happening but my brother one thing I'm telling that God is working don't give up Don't Let The Devil deceive you that it can happen keep believing keep believing on the promise of God keep acting and God is going to let it come to pass so Abraham was on Abraham bought everything baby's clothing baby stuff andah said the promise Ted The Promise Ted The Promise the promise that Abraham is going to have a son took a longer time and he said and the woman and the woman the woman lost faith lost faith in the word do you know that she lost faith you know what do you know she lost faith in the word do you know the woman Sarah lost faith in the word is because Sarah didn't meet God it was Abraham that met God and Abraham came to tell Sarah Abraham came to tell Sarah this is what God have said this is what God have said have you seen that half what somebody has said canot keep you forever but when you get your own Revelation when you get your own encounter with God he raise your faith so then sah suggested and you know how women are Abraham when God promised has been a long time God will give you a child has given long time week it's been 10 years since God has promised us with me why don't you take my my mid servant why don't you m servant hey guy and go in with her and give B and do you know something whenever man try to Aid or try to help the work of God there's all it brings all the time problem the first time a woman tried to interpret the word of God in the book in Genesis took your whole he brought sin the second time that what give bir ish that gave birth to ish he and Abraham gave birth to ish so when Abraham went in with hegi the m servant of Sarah he gave birth to is and the descendant of is is the Muslims the Muslims and what do we see today what do we see today what do see today is fighting everywhere fight fight [Music] confusion is because Sarah lost faith in the word of God and tried to do it with his her wisdom and God saw that the woman has lost faith so God came down God came down when he was going to destroy Sodom and gomorra and said God Walk God Walk God was walking and Abraham met him and he said come to my house and he prepared meat and he ate with God and God said shall I hide shall I hide I hide hide what I'm going to do against from my servant Abraham and God told Abraham God told Abraham what he was going to do to Sodom and goor because God have seen Abraham has trusted and Abraham had faith in him and when God see that you have faith in God God see you can you can you can negotiate with God because Abraham now was asking God what if you go to Sodom and you get 100 people who believe in you will oh God said no I will not destroy it God asked Abraham said what of 50 then Abraham said what of 50 God said I will not destroy it God said Abraham said what of 30 so I'll will not destroy it Abram say what of 20 God say not destroy it what of 10 God I will not destroy it that is the position you can come with God that you can negotiate with God look at the lifestyle ofah look at the lifestyle of yeah was on the bed on the bed of death and scripture said he turned onto the wall and started crying and praying he said God I've worshiped you God I have believed in you and said God added 15 years to his age God added 15 years to his age this is what we can do we can create life we can create life we can bring things into existence he's just believing in God he was dying God sent the prophet go tell isah you are about to die isah heard the word of God isah heard the word of God and didn't tell the prophet is prophet Isaiah he didn't talk to the Prophet The Prophet tried to plead with God for God to have mercy on me he didn't tell the prophet that talk to God for God to have mercy on me but himself he turned to the wall and KN down and started praying and said God I've been faithful to you I believe in you I have walk in your way and God listen to his prayer the power that we have don't let the devil cheat you of that power don't let the devil cheat you out of the blessings of God you need to exercise every Power you to obtain every promise and every gift that accompan this Christian Life every gift that accomp this life what I'm telling you Isiah he prayed himself so whatever you are going through you can talk to God yourself and God is going to turn the situation around so God now came to Abraham and God told Abraham said God intentionally he knew what Sarah is going to do intentionally and God said oh you are going to give birth to a boy give birth to a boy and say Sarah laugh in her heart that is serious that is serious she laugh in her heart that after have grown old and pass the age of menopause pass the age of Mena and my husband has no pleasure how come and God said Sarah where is your wife and God said Sarah Abraham why did Sarah laugh and Abraham ran to his wife and asked did you laugh and he said no I didn't laugh and God Abra Abraham came back to God and said she said he didn't laugh and God said didn't she say in her heart after I've have grown old the way some of us the some of us some of us when the pastor is preaching you are condemning the pastor in your head or in your heart said those things sound louder they sound louder than saying it with your mouth so we have to be careful with whatever we think with whatever we plan in our heart you know B said sometimes it is not the ACT but it is the heart that's what he said the other I read from 2 Chronicles chapter 25 verse1 Amah did what was perfect and right in the sight of godia yeah but not with a a perfect heart he did what was right in God so some people will be doing the right thing but not with a perfect heart let us check the conditions of our heart let what let us make sure the conditions of our heart is all the time right right you hear some people also say Christianity is hard by the heart it doesn't matter what you do but if your heart is right your attitude will be right if your heart is right your behavior will be right and God said Sarah didn't say in your heart after I've grown old I have grown old how can I give birth how can I God says oh the prophet said he shook Sarah it shook Sarah itook yeah and it quickened her fi Quicken her faith her faith yeah that what I was thinking in my heart this man has been able to say it said God visitation God's visitation was to raise the faith of Sarah so that you could believe the promise and God said a year by this time a year by this time a year by time and the next year they had a son called Isaac that means that God has the things for you but if you lose faith in God it is not going to come to pass the healing the blessing the whatever you are thinking of God has it in place for you but if you lose faith in God you will never get it that is the important of faith I say if you have faith you can create into existence you hav heard of the squar talk about creates squar out of into existence he create squar he created animals or rat into existence they were not there but he created it's just Faith so one day entered a temple sorry Braham entered a hospital and this lady was sick and said do you know you can be healed do you have faith and she said she said yes and said Do you believe this F can he said yes you believe said Do you believe you can make this fun [Music] 10 the lady said no that one I don't believe then said then you don't have faith and said at a fun and he started turning why did bra do that is just to raise the faith of the lady and she prayed for her and cancer vanish is the the power of faith if you desire something from God if you desire something from God and you have faith and you believe is going to happen no there is power in faith because if you have faith you can create whatever because God has given you that power but all that you need to do is to align yourself with God and will break that power it is not only in me it is in me it is in you but for we to operate it we need to align with God said you see the car it's just a mechanics the car the it's just the mechanics the mechanics but without a foel that is the Dynamics it cannot move it cannot move so you we are the mechanics the Holy Ghost is the Dynamics we need to align ourself with God then we can operate my brother if you align yourself with God you will never need anything in this world because whatever you want whatever you want whatever you desire you just to ask God you just need to talk to God no brother Abraham wanted a son wanted a son Joseph he said after he has read the lifestyle of Joseph in the Bible after he has read the lifestyle of Joseph in the Bible desired to have a son and name it Joseph but could you imagine the first chch he had was a girl and they said maybe you name her Josephine and he said no God promised me that I'll have a son and named him Joseph and today I have brother William Joseph Braham faith in the word of God it's faith and that faith is for us just to believe in God and if you just believe in God and you speak so Jesus said Mountain be mve the mountain will be moved Mountain be moved the mountain will be moved there is something in us the devil is just creating fear that's for this is still huge this is not possible this sickness cannot be cured because when you have that fear you won believe in God you stop believing in God because you afraid sometime people are afraid that oh even sometime some pastors are afraid what if you pray for this person and he doesn't get well brother it is not your business to let somebody get well your business is God said pray for him the rest is God's work and if God will stand there for his name to be put to shame if God will stand there or be there for his name to put to shame well and let's see if God will be there for his name to put shame and because God will never want his name to be pulled to Shon you will come and Grant that person healing but often times we are afraid what if I pray and the person does not get healed sometimes the person is sick and you have that desire immediately heard of their sickness the first night came to oh let me go and pray for this brother let me go and pray for this sister then the devil the devil come the devil and whisper in your ears look look at how you live your life can you pray for somebody to get healed and you look at yourself what if I pray and the person that not healed don't worry about that God said pray just do your part the rest is in the hands of God you are not the one going to heal the person you are not a person you one going to do something for the person if somebody wants a job and he come and tell you and you feel like to pray pray for that person the rest is for God do your part don't get worried No Jesus just said the Fig should dry up he just told the Fig you just get dry he didn't worry about how it is going to happen you know that God is going to make it happen and he moved on and it happened often times we are so afraid how what if it doesn't work what if it doesn't happen as how I have prayed my brother it works it works yeah it works just pray just believe just do your part do what you are supposed to do and leave the rest for God don't don't let the devil put fear in you don't let the devil put that in you no if you believe the devil the power God has placed in you the power God has placed in you you will never exercise it by the time you know by the time you know you are a great healer but
