[0:28] fore
[0:49] amen
[0:58] amen
[1:27] Yia morning and it's
[1:37] it was
[1:39] what P
[1:44] what when
[1:57] [Music]
[1:58] just
[2:15] [Music]
[2:23] Pasa we are saved because of
[2:28] Easter because what happened during
[2:32] Easter because what happening
[2:40] Easter during
[2:42] Easter that we had the
[2:45] death we had a
[2:49] death
[2:52] burier of Jesus
[2:54] Christ and is because of that sacrifice
[2:57] Jesus
[2:58] did that's why me and you are alive
[3:03] today so we shouldn't be
[3:06] worried if you indeed we call we are the
[3:09] followers of Jesus
[3:12] Christ then we should be the happiest
[3:15] people on
[3:19] Earth David
[3:21] said I was glad when they said unto me
[3:24] let us go into the house of the
[3:27] Lord I don't know if we happy to find
[3:29] yourself in the house of the Lord
[3:33] too because you
[3:35] know often times people thinks it is a
[3:39] person that can help
[3:44] them but I want to tell that if God does
[3:46] not put it on the person's heart the
[3:48] person can do anything for
[3:57] you and if somebody's to
[4:00] difficult somebody is too
[4:03] difficult remember it is
[4:06] God that's why Amos 33 we
[4:10] say Amos
[4:13] 33 OS
[4:15] 33
[4:17] 333 yeah 33
[4:21] 33 I'm not reading but I'm
[4:25] paraphrasing when you read from the 3 to
[4:28] the S he said have they be any evil in
[4:31] the city that I the Lord God has not
[4:33] done
[4:36] it you said verse S right
[4:49] yeah and you
[4:51] know if somebody is
[4:54] difficult you don't worry about that
[4:57] person because God told Moses
[5:00] he said it is I the
[5:02] Lord it is I the
[5:05] Lord that has hardened the heart of
[5:12] pharaoh that the power of God will be
[5:18] seen so we shouldn't be
[5:21] worried as long as we stay in the
[5:24] promise of
[5:26] God and the promise of God is the
[5:29] message of this
[5:32] hour and the message of this hour is
[5:35] going to take her to our Lord Jesus
[5:39] Christ times we see Christians
[5:44] complaining I see God is
[5:47] dead it didn't start
[5:50] today after
[5:52] God delivering
[5:57] Israel from Egypt
[6:00] through the Red
[6:02] Sea now to the
[6:10] W these people were not
[6:14] complaining oh Moses you brought us here
[6:17] for us to
[6:19] die because they were demanding just for
[6:22] common
[6:25] food they have forgotten what God has
[6:29] done for
[6:31] them and they have lost faith in
[6:35] God and when a man lose faith in
[6:38] [Music]
[6:39] God he start
[6:41] complaining he start saying a whole lot
[6:44] of
[6:45] things and that
[6:48] said that is the nature of a
[6:52] man
[6:53] man is all the time grateful for
[6:58] God for what he has done for him
[7:03] yesterday and he's hoping for what God
[7:06] will do for him
[7:10] tomorrow but what God is doing for him
[7:13] today he fail to
[7:19] appreciate so this people was mming
[7:21] against
[7:25] Moses and they were
[7:28] complaining now they were Desiring back
[7:31] to go to
[7:35] Egypt but you
[7:37] know but the scriptures
[7:40] said said these things were our
[7:45] example that we should not repeat what
[7:48] the the people of Israel did in the
[7:55] wilderness what is our example that the
[7:58] Bible was talking about
[8:02] is to get to the point to lose faith in
[8:07] God and when a man lose faith in
[8:11] God he turns now to rely on
[8:18] people and you
[8:20] know there's
[8:22] nobody that can help you if God does not
[8:26] put it on his
[8:28] heart you know this
[8:30] morning I would like us to look at this
[8:33] topic
[8:36] Faith the topic
[8:43] fa and how important is faith in the
[8:47] Christian
[8:51] journey and why every Christian need to
[8:54] live by
[8:58] faith and look at
[9:01] some is our
[9:07] example so that we know what God have
[9:10] for
[9:12] us shall open our
[9:16] Bible to Hebrews chapter
[9:25] 11 from verse
[9:28] one
[9:44] I'll read as much as I can
[9:47] read verse
[9:49] one now Faith is the sub of things hoped
[9:56] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[10:01] for by
[10:04] it for by
[10:06] it the ERS obtain a good
[10:12] report through
[10:15] faith we understand that the word were
[10:18] framed by the word of
[10:22] God so that things which are seen were
[10:25] not made of were not made of things
[10:28] which do not appear
[10:30] do
[10:37] appear by faith Abel offered unto God
[10:41] more excellent sacrifice than
[10:47] King by which he obtained witness that
[10:50] was he was righteous God testify of his
[10:53] gift and by it being dead yet
[10:58] speak
[11:04] and by faith Enoch was translated that
[11:06] he should not see
[11:11] de and was not found because God has
[11:15] translated
[11:18] him for before his translation he had
[11:22] this testimony that he pleased
[11:27] God verse six but without faith it is
[11:31] impossible to please
[11:36] him for he that come to God has believe
[11:40] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[11:43] that diligent seek
[11:53] him God bless you shall we pray Lord
[11:57] come and bless us this morning with
[12:01] in Jesus name we pray
[12:03] amen shall I be
[12:05] seated I want to continue
[12:08] reading and by faith
[12:13] Noah be one of not seen as
[12:19] yet moved with
[12:22] fear prepare an act to the saving of his
[12:28] house
[12:31] by the by by the which he condemned the
[12:35] word and became hair of righteous which
[12:38] is by
[12:43] faith no somebody might be
[12:46] thinking no I have just been
[12:49] reading I have just been
[12:52] reading some sort of
[12:55] scriptures and all we hear is about
[12:57] faith faith faith
[13:00] but to want to dive into it we want to
[13:03] go into it we want to go into
[13:09] Faith so that the
[13:12] benefit that these people that we have
[13:14] talked
[13:16] about received in the
[13:19] scriptures we also receive as followers
[13:22] of Jesus
[13:25] Christ no we have read we started with
[13:28] his something that you don't
[13:32] see to believe something that you don't
[13:37] see and that is what is what is that is
[13:40] what is difficult for a lot of
[13:44] people but
[13:47] said faith is not anything to difficult
[13:51] or
[13:54] complicated but even you just having fa
[13:57] that if I sleep I wake up
[13:59] even you believing that if you sleep you
[14:01] wake
[14:04] up that is Faith you know we going to
[14:08] look at the lifestyle of
[14:13] Abraham which if you want to read you
[14:15] can find in Genesis CH 12 verse
[14:18] 1-4 if you read if you want okay let me
[14:21] read it Genesis CH 12 vers 1
[14:28] to4
[14:30] to see how sometimes strangely it might
[14:34] be because when it comes to things of
[14:37] faith it is not usual it is not how we
[14:41] do things
[14:45] normal it's like somebody is dead for
[14:47] three
[14:49] days and I come and tell you this person
[14:51] is going to resurrect
[14:54] it it's against all ODS of life it's
[14:58] against all C of
[15:01] life and I don't think anybody in the
[15:04] right human adamic sense will accept to
[15:07] believe what I'm
[15:12] saying because the person has been dead
[15:15] for three
[15:16] days because the person has been dead
[15:18] for three
[15:19] [Music]
[15:21] days but Faith Can Do
[15:24] It it see sometime how faith is being
[15:27] wrapped onto you
[15:35] it's not how you want to see
[15:37] it you want see
[15:42] it let's just imagine what happened in
[15:46] Genesis now the Lord has said unto
[15:50] Abraham get thee out of thy
[15:54] country and from thy
[15:57] Kindred and from thy father
[15:59] house onto a land that I will seal
[16:03] thee no look at how look at how the
[16:05] scripture
[16:07] go you meet a
[16:10] stranger who you don't
[16:13] know who you can't
[16:15] see then talking to you he said leave
[16:19] your
[16:20] house leave your family leave everything
[16:24] you
[16:25] have and go to a
[16:27] place even the place he didn't mention
[16:30] the
[16:34] name sometimes this how the move of Fai
[16:38] is this how the moon of fi
[16:44] is because it's very
[16:47] strange and look at what he added in the
[16:50] verse
[16:51] two and I'll make thee a great
[16:55] nation and I'll bless thee and make thy
[16:59] name
[17:00] great and that shall be a
[17:02] blessing Abraham was in his father's
[17:05] house Abraham was in his father's
[17:08] house move you should leave everything
[17:12] behind and
[17:14] move then you'll be a great
[17:18] nation look at the difference look at it
[17:22] you know if I want to be
[17:23] great maybe my father has gained enough
[17:27] resources my father has gain enough
[17:33] resources then me to then me I also
[17:37] build on that
[17:40] resources
[17:44] build and I'll be a great
[17:47] person but this where you are telling
[17:51] me I should leave my
[17:53] house leave my
[17:56] father no leave everything
[17:59] and go to somewhere you are going to
[18:01] show
[18:02] me that I don't even know whether where
[18:05] I'm going I'm going to get food or I'm
[18:06] not going to get
[18:09] food
[18:10] no let's ask
[18:13] ourself what will I do this
[18:16] morning if I was
[18:19] abrah what will I do this
[18:22] morning if I was
[18:26] Abraham know often times
[18:29] the word of God comes to us the word of
[18:32] God come to
[18:35] us but when that word of God come to
[18:38] us it doesn't suit what we
[18:43] want it doesn't
[18:46] suit like you don't feel okay it doesn't
[18:49] go the way you want it to
[18:53] go and that is how all the time it has
[18:57] been because God is an unusual
[19:03] God and he does that is contrary to the
[19:08] understanding of
[19:11] men
[19:13] imagine
[19:14] isah
[19:16] saying a virgin shall
[19:20] conceive let's take all joke
[19:23] aside let's take all joke
[19:26] aside all joke
[19:30] yeah
[19:34] yeah imagine Pastor comes to
[19:38] church and tell you a virgin shall
[19:42] conceive in this age of
[19:45] Science in this age of
[19:51] science how many are going to believe
[19:55] that this how strange it is
[19:59] fa that we talked
[20:01] about but he
[20:03] said the reason
[20:06] why that
[20:08] word was able to
[20:11] manifest in the life of
[20:14] Mary it's
[20:16] because Mary tgh about
[20:20] it and Mary believed
[20:23] it and and Mary act according to
[20:27] it
[20:31] so if God's word comes to
[20:33] you if God's word comes to
[20:36] you and God tells you oh you are going
[20:39] to be
[20:41] great but to make the
[20:44] move and you stay at that
[20:47] position you haven't believe the word of
[20:51] God no you can't say it in your mouth
[20:54] you can say it in your mouth you can
[20:56] profess in your mouth you can or you
[20:59] cannot you
[21:01] can and everybody will be everybody can
[21:04] hear you can
[21:07] hear oh I'm a
[21:09] Christian I'm
[21:11] this that is fine but
[21:15] Christianity without the
[21:18] life is not
[21:21] Christianity
[21:22] Christianity is Living Like Jesus Christ
[21:26] so if we claim
[21:29] we believe Jesus Christ then our
[21:33] lifestyle to show the word Jesus
[21:37] Christ then I want to continue
[21:41] reading but I'm jumping to the verse
[21:44] four so
[21:47] Abraham
[21:49] departed as the Lord has spoken unto
[21:55] him often
[21:57] times how do will respond to the message
[22:00] of
[22:02] God for to
[22:05] Abraham For unto Abraham ABR he acted as
[22:10] the message came he acted as the message
[22:14] came the message God gave to
[22:22] him forsaking
[22:24] all
[22:27] foring
[22:29] and decide to follow
[22:32] God and for us me and you
[22:36] today this scripture being written
[22:40] here is not here just to give us a
[22:46] knowledge that there was a certain man
[22:50] Abraham but it we show unto
[22:53] us that God is going to come to us on
[22:57] the unusual way
[23:01] and God is expecting a response from
[23:06] us don't let us be
[23:09] deceived don't let us be
[23:13] deceived because we saw the last
[23:16] time that when he came for the Rich
[23:18] Young
[23:21] Ruler to sell his
[23:24] resources I said that wasn't difficult
[23:26] for him but to come to the point and
[23:30] follow Jesus
[23:32] Christ it was difficult for
[23:35] him and often time we don't want to pay
[23:38] or do the
[23:40] sacrifice and follow Jesus
[23:43] Christ
[23:45] Christianity is about
[23:48] sacrifice sometimes you need to forsake
[23:52] the things you
[23:53] love you need to forsake the things you
[23:57] love the things you have been living
[24:00] with and start AR
[24:03] fresh and start
[24:06] again with Jesus
[24:09] Christ you know
[24:12] sometimes people
[24:15] think I can do it my own
[24:18] way as long
[24:21] said the
[24:23] moment you
[24:26] told I could have a better
[24:29] way of doing it of doing it than what
[24:34] the Bible has
[24:36] said you have left God out of the
[24:40] equation and no
[24:43] man will make
[24:46] it if he leave God out of the
[24:50] equation no
[24:52] because no when it come to
[24:55] Christianity and when it come to
[24:57] Salvation
[24:59] it has nothing to do with me and
[25:02] you it is the work of Jesus
[25:05] Christ and by through
[25:09] that we are
[25:11] saved we are saved by the grace of God
[25:16] but as when we
[25:18] respond or when we
[25:20] believe that
[25:22] indeed that indeed or
[25:26] truly Jesus
[25:29] died for
[25:30] me then it his
[25:33] work we
[25:35] do in
[25:37] appreciation for what God did on the
[25:42] cross and not as
[25:46] Christians for we to be
[25:49] able to work in this Christian
[25:55] Journey we need faith
[25:59] and most importantly to believe
[26:01] completely in Christ
[26:06] Jesus because if you don't have
[26:09] faith you cannot walk with God we just
[26:13] read in the
[26:15] scripture that without
[26:17] faith it is impossible to please God
[26:21] that means a
[26:23] man cannot
[26:25] live this Christian Life without having
[26:29] faith in
[26:31] Christ we have heard several
[26:33] times we have heard several
[26:37] times heard several
[26:42] times that all things are possible to
[26:46] them that
[26:48] believe and as we used to sing the song
[26:51] only
[26:55] believe in order to have God in action
[27:01] we first need to
[27:03] believe bra said God is not doing
[27:07] anything
[27:08] new
[27:12] God but God did everything before the
[27:15] foundation of this Earth was
[27:21] laid but the only thing we need is Faith
[27:24] to bring that thing into
[27:27] existence
[27:31] imagine in the
[27:35] 1800 then somebody will
[27:38] say there's going to come a
[27:40] time that there's going to be a
[27:43] machine and I can just be talking to
[27:46] Brother
[27:48] Martin and I'll be seeing Brother
[27:51] Martin and Martin will be seeing
[27:54] me nobody would have believed it then
[27:58] they will say it is not
[28:00] possible they say it can
[28:04] happen but what do we have
[28:07] today this is just said this is just
[28:13] signs and look at what science is
[28:20] doing then
[28:22] imagine a child of
[28:25] God in the right position
[28:29] of the nature God created
[28:32] him he can do
[28:34] more than what science is doing no other
[28:38] time you see
[28:40] people or you see some
[28:43] preachers trying to make theirself
[28:46] God trying to let the people build faith
[28:49] in
[28:50] them but my brother my sister the truth
[28:55] is I can't do anything to help you
[28:58] I can't even save you I can't heal you
[29:02] when to ask brother Abraham or is it
[29:05] because you go and pray too
[29:07] much it's because I don't do
[29:10] anything it's the man living in
[29:13] me Jesus Christ Living in me that is
[29:16] doing the healing and if Jesus Christ is
[29:19] living in you then God is in you and if
[29:24] God is in you then you can create things
[29:27] into existence
[29:30] often times things are not difficult you
[29:34] just need to position yourself with God
[29:37] and have that Faith to speak the word of
[29:40] God to bring things into existence God
[29:44] has created as smaller
[29:46] Gods God say he has created us as
[29:49] smaller
[29:51] Gods God said he created man in his own
[29:55] nature and he created as small
[29:59] God so
[30:01] Adam when Adam was
[30:03] created Adam look at this and said we
[30:07] call this
[30:08] dog we call this cat we call this
[30:13] banana Adam was not there when God was
[30:16] creating Adam Adam didn't create with
[30:22] God said in the beginning before the
[30:26] foundation of this Earth was
[30:28] we were with God because we were taught
[30:31] in God and when God was creating we were
[30:35] there so if you find ourself in that
[30:38] position then say it and it will
[30:41] happen and Adam named
[30:45] everything that is the power God has
[30:48] given to
[30:49] us but for we to operate with that
[30:53] power we need to have faith in
[30:56] God no let me read a certain scripture
[30:59] from Mark
[31:18] 11:22 now we
[31:22] there oh let me start from the verse
[31:26] 20 and in the
[31:29] morning as they passed
[31:32] by they saw the Fig Tree dry up from the
[31:36] root and Peter calling to
[31:41] remembrance said unto him Master behold
[31:47] the F tree with that cast is wed
[31:52] away you see and Jesus answered said
[31:55] unto
[31:56] them
[31:58] have faith in God when you read Bible
[32:02] Bible
[32:03] story it said when Jesus spoke to the
[32:06] Fig
[32:07] Tre or if you should read up a
[32:11] little we could see that Jesus was
[32:15] hungry and he wanted something to
[32:19] eat but it wasn't the time for fake to
[32:22] yield
[32:24] [Music]
[32:26] fruits so somebody will say
[32:29] now if it's not a time for the F to yeld
[32:34] fruit why would Jesus C that F
[32:38] tree because it's not yet time but
[32:43] Jesus was the
[32:45] creator
[32:47] himself and if the Creator is in desire
[32:50] of
[32:52] something then that thing need to yield
[32:54] to the
[32:56] Creator need to
[33:00] yield but this victory was not
[33:04] yielding in
[33:06] said
[33:09] said but this this this fig tree was not
[33:13] yielding to the
[33:15] Creator and
[33:18] said when Jesus
[33:22] said the Fig
[33:24] Tree should dry from the root from the
[33:28] leaves to the
[33:31] root when he said it he didn't even look
[33:34] at the F tree again he wasn't
[33:38] going and thinking Hey would this
[33:41] happen oh what if what if then the next
[33:44] day and the Victory is not
[33:46] dead but he spoke the word and he
[33:50] went and when he spoke the word none of
[33:54] his disciples said
[33:56] anything but the next
[33:59] morning and in the
[34:01] morning they were passing by the same
[34:04] place and
[34:06] Peter said Master you see the tree that
[34:10] he ciss
[34:12] yesterday he has wed and dry from the
[34:16] root and Jesus
[34:18] said have faith in
[34:21] God for very I say unto
[34:24] you that whosoever shall see unto this
[34:27] man
[34:29] Mountain be thou
[34:31] removed be thou cast onto the
[34:34] sea and shall not doubt in his
[34:37] heart but shall believe that those
[34:41] things that which he say shall come to
[34:44] pass he shall have
[34:48] faith you see often times people sit in
[34:55] church and people walk from the street
[34:59] and get their
[35:02] healing and get what they they want from
[35:06] God because the scripture over
[35:09] here
[35:13] whosoever so if
[35:15] somebody hears holding this
[35:18] scripture that God have
[35:21] said if I believe in
[35:23] him and I say this it's going to come to
[35:27] pass
[35:29] is going to happen in that person's life
[35:32] that is the reason
[35:33] why sometimes people who are not well
[35:36] grounded in the Christian
[35:41] faith look at people on the street and
[35:45] so even this
[35:46] person he doesn't comes to church he
[35:50] doesn't come
[35:51] to and he's frustrating he's frustrated
[35:55] he's prospering oh
[35:59] you
[35:59] know God has given his word and the word
[36:04] is not if the
[36:07] pastor the word is not if the
[36:10] pastor or the
[36:12] prophet or the
[36:15] preacher say the mountain
[36:18] moved or the preacher say the mountain
[36:22] move then the mountain will
[36:24] move by
[36:26] whosoever
[36:28] that is me and you has been given that
[36:32] power so if I
[36:34] believe that I want
[36:37] money then I pray to God then I believe
[36:40] it is going to
[36:43] happen if I want if you are sick if you
[36:46] are sick and I come to pray for you
[36:51] nothing is going to happen but if you
[36:54] believe that me praying for you you are
[36:57] going to get healed then when you are
[37:00] being prayed for you are going to get
[37:02] healed the
[37:04] power is with us that is the reason why
[37:08] you say greater is who that is in
[37:11] me than what that is in the
[37:14] world so you don't have to let
[37:18] anybody deceive
[37:21] you that oh if I fast for you and people
[37:26] believe somebody fast for me
[37:30] I'm going to get
[37:33] well or if if I pray for
[37:37] you you are going to get
[37:39] well it is good for me to help pray and
[37:42] fast for you when you are in
[37:46] need but for the faith to claim what you
[37:49] are looking from
[37:52] God is from
[37:55] you the Christian Journey
[37:58] the Christian walk or
[38:01] Journey no
[38:03] nobody can do anything to help
[38:07] you the best I can
[38:10] do is to stand here and Shout the best I
[38:13] can
[38:15] shout shout the best I can
[38:18] shout but the person who can do
[38:21] something is
[38:23] God that's the reason why I all the time
[38:26] want you to want to point you to
[38:29] God for you to come to that connection
[38:31] with
[38:32] God and when you get into that point
[38:35] with God you can get whatever you want
[38:38] from
[38:39] God you don't need you don't need
[38:44] anybody but we just need to talk to
[38:46] God and that is how Christianity
[38:50] is it's you and God are
[38:54] fath it's not you and your brother
[38:58] but it is good for me to remind you
[39:00] remember you in
[39:03] prayer if you are
[39:05] sick it is fine to tell
[39:08] me for me to pray for
[39:10] you but it is not me that is going to
[39:14] heal you but it is
[39:19] God the work is completely
[39:22] God no
[39:24] preacher no Pastor no Prophet can give
[39:28] salvation to me and
[39:30] you sometimes I say how
[39:33] pity when I hear
[39:36] people going to pay for money going to
[39:39] pay
[39:40] money
[39:43] pay for
[39:45] somebody to pray for them believing that
[39:50] if they pay
[39:51] money they are going to have
[39:53] salvation if they pay money they are
[39:56] going to get their heart
[40:00] desires and my brothers and sisters we
[40:03] should be careful about
[40:06] preachers
[40:08] prophets who project themselves to be
[40:12] God and pointing the people to
[40:14] themselves those people have nothing to
[40:17] give
[40:18] us it is only the power of God and that
[40:22] power of God you have it but the only
[40:26] thing is is but the only thing
[40:30] is you need to believe have faith then
[40:35] you operate with that power of God in
[40:38] you then if you need something you pray
[40:42] to God then God is going to give it to
[40:44] you you know see faith cannot be
[40:49] overemphasized because if I want to talk
[40:51] about
[40:53] faith
[40:55] yeah I'm going to talk about it every
[40:58] day because
[41:00] sleeping because
[41:02] sleeping and waking up but who promise
[41:05] you are going to wake up the next day
[41:08] but you
[41:10] believe but you believe you are going to
[41:13] wake up that is
[41:16] Faith
[41:18] said if
[41:19] we could have that faith that you can I
[41:23] can walk from here to here or walk back
[41:28] Wass that I need that same Faith to
[41:32] claim whatever it is to
[41:36] claim but do you know our
[41:39] problem we come to the
[41:41] point and said this
[41:44] thing I don't think God can do
[41:47] it we limit
[41:50] god with our
[41:52] mind ask for
[41:55] this ask for my sickness
[41:58] ask for what I'm going
[42:00] through I don't
[42:02] think and that is
[42:05] how the
[42:06] devil will all the
[42:09] time try to be painting the
[42:13] thing in such a way that you don't have
[42:17] faith to go to God because he
[42:20] knows because the devil
[42:22] knows when you get God and when you
[42:25] believe in God
[42:27] you do
[42:29] things Beyond man's
[42:34] understanding they came alive in Peter's
[42:37] life they came alive in Peter's
[42:41] life they came a time in
[42:46] Peter and they asked do you know
[42:49] Jesus so no no no no no no oh I don't
[42:52] know him I haven't even seen him before
[42:54] even this is the first time hearing of
[42:56] Jesus
[42:58] that was Peter that small little
[43:01] girl that small
[43:04] girl that small girl small yeah
[43:10] girl are you not one of
[43:13] them said I don't know him but when
[43:17] Peter had the Holy
[43:20] Ghost had an encounter with God had a
[43:24] revelation of Jesus Christ Living in him
[43:28] at the gate he told a
[43:32] man silver and gold I have
[43:36] none but in the name of Jesus Christ
[43:39] rise up and
[43:40] walk ah Peter it was Peter it was that
[43:44] same
[43:45] Peter who could not cast The
[43:49] Demon out of the G that was
[43:52] suffering the girl that was suffering
[43:54] from the maniac
[43:56] spirit
[43:59] Peter now is telling somebody who is
[44:04] crippled good I have
[44:06] none but in the name of Jesus Christ up
[44:10] and the person has resurrected and
[44:16] walk what makes me and you what makes me
[44:19] and you and Peter
[44:22] different is because Peter has believed
[44:24] in
[44:26] God
[44:27] and Peter has believed five five speak
[44:29] is going to
[44:34] happen I know what no Peter went through
[44:38] something he went through
[44:42] something because I've told you two
[44:44] Peter one was denying
[44:48] Jesus and now one is standing and
[44:51] speaking in the name of
[44:55] Jesus what is the trans
[44:59] transformation so then often
[45:01] times I us tell
[45:03] people if you pay the if you pay the
[45:07] sacrifice that Peter
[45:09] did you are going to have the power and
[45:12] authority
[45:14] Peter but often times we tend to jump
[45:19] things we tend to jump the
[45:22] process we we we tend not to go through
[45:25] the process
[45:29] and we just want to get to the
[45:31] top but it doesn't work that
[45:34] way Peter ran from
[45:36] Jesus Peter denied
[45:39] Jesus but Peter
[45:42] remembered that Jesus said they should
[45:43] go and wait in the upper
[45:52] room room
[45:55] yeah
[45:58] and
[45:59] Peter waited in that
[46:02] room waited in that room he
[46:07] waited in that
[46:10] room and what happened there was an
[46:15] experience something
[46:17] happened that's what see if you call
[46:21] yourself a
[46:22] Christian you have to come to the point
[46:26] there something
[46:28] has happened to you that you have met
[46:31] God that you have had an encounter with
[46:34] God because it is the only encounter
[46:37] with God that is going to change you
[46:41] imagine
[46:43] Paul who was persecuting the
[46:46] apostles who was
[46:48] persecuting killing the
[46:51] apostles came the next time and was
[46:54] preaching Jesus Christ what happened
[46:58] there was a
[46:59] transformation that he has met God that
[47:02] is the reason why me and you we have to
[47:05] make sure we have to make sure we have
[47:09] met
[47:10] God
[47:11] said said
[47:14] anyone who call himself a Christian
[47:17] should make sure he had one and one
[47:21] encounter God With Jesus Christ because
[47:25] it is the encounter with God
[47:28] that is going to give you Revelation and
[47:32] Revelation it is Fai and when you get
[47:35] that
[47:36] Revelation nobody can take it away from
[47:39] you not even the devil because you have
[47:43] seen
[47:45] God if a man see God his life he's
[47:50] walking he's talking his behavior is
[47:54] different from a man who have not seen
[47:56] God
[47:57] that is the reason why that is the
[48:00] reason why me and you need to make sure
[48:04] we have met God no coming to church is
[48:07] fine coming to church is
[48:09] fine but coming to church will not save
[48:13] you but if you meet God you will come to
[48:17] church but you can come and sit in the
[48:19] church and go back home the same
[48:24] person that how serious how things can
[48:26] be
[48:28] and that is the reason why people can
[48:30] look at those come to church so if I'm
[48:33] even better than this person that
[48:38] come my
[48:39] brother my brother my
[48:43] sister don't measure your
[48:46] Christianity by the standard of how
[48:48] somebody live their life in their church
[48:51] but understand by the standard
[48:55] by
[49:01] because the standard our
[49:05] standard is Jesus
[49:09] Christ no could you could you imagine
[49:12] little
[49:14] Moses
[49:16] Moses was raised by his
[49:21] mother in the house of
[49:23] pharaoh and said his
[49:25] mother taught
[49:27] Moses the things concerning how they got
[49:31] into
[49:34] Egypt so so Moses saw the people of
[49:39] Israel as his brothers and
[49:43] sisters but one day Moses saw an Israeli
[49:47] and Egyptian
[49:51] fighting Moses tried to go and
[49:55] save and
[49:57] mooses and in the
[50:00] process
[50:02] Moses Moses killed the
[50:06] Egyptian and braam
[50:09] said when we take a
[50:12] step without the direction of
[50:15] God all the time end in Misfortune and
[50:19] accident gonna
[50:25] end so what happened to Moses
[50:28] now Moses know that he was a
[50:33] deliverer you know that he he he the one
[50:36] who to take Israel from Egypt to the
[50:38] promised
[50:43] land but now Moses was running from
[50:49] Egypt young
[50:51] Moses energetic
[50:54] Moses energetic very strong
[50:58] strong
[50:59] Moses he's
[51:01] strong he's
[51:04] energetic he's running from the presence
[51:07] of
[51:10] pharaoh because
[51:12] now what happened he tried to save the
[51:15] people of Israel with his own
[51:18] [Music]
[51:20] strength and it
[51:23] failed it
[51:25] failed then go to
[51:27] Moses into the
[51:31] wildness Into the
[51:38] Wilderness and
[51:40] now
[51:42] said God need to take all the worldly
[51:48] ideas that has been imparted into
[51:52] Moses
[51:54] away and after that
[51:57] Moses had an encounter with
[52:01] God Moses now met
[52:05] God Moses now saw the burning
[52:10] bush and God spoke to him when he went
[52:13] close to the burning
[52:21] bush now Moses asked
[52:25] God if I go and the people ask me if
[52:29] what if I go and the people ask me the
[52:32] people of Israel ask me if they
[52:36] ask what is your name what should I tell
[52:41] them so when you have I'm also going to
[52:44] tell
[52:45] you if you get if you meet
[52:48] God if you have an encounter with
[52:51] God
[52:53] asking God what is the purp purpose what
[52:57] is the
[53:00] purpose or the
[53:02] plan that you have for me God I want to
[53:07] know so that I live my life as
[53:11] such you know often times we are living
[53:15] a lot of people soall
[53:18] people I just
[53:22] impersonating this is
[53:24] somebody who can sing
[53:27] and they also want to
[53:28] sing my
[53:30] brother it is very important for we to
[53:33] know our
[53:35] calling what
[53:37] God has raised up for it's very
[53:43] important
[53:45] because one
[53:47] day if you meet
[53:49] me and see my two
[53:52] hands on my head you might have run away
[53:56] you you might run
[54:01] away because normally the hand is
[54:04] supposed to be here because my hand is
[54:07] supposed to be
[54:09] here but you see my hand on my
[54:12] head which is
[54:14] strange that is the reason why we have
[54:17] to know our position in
[54:19] Christ so that we don't see that this
[54:21] person is doing
[54:23] this so so I'm also going to do some
[54:27] but we find what God have for
[54:31] us and glorify
[54:34] God it is very
[54:37] important now
[54:39] Moses after meeting God he was old and
[54:44] weak old and
[54:47] weak he's now using a
[54:51] stick or he's not using a
[54:55] stuff to walk but this
[54:59] Moses was going to
[55:01] Egypt and when they
[55:04] asking Moses where are you
[55:07] going oh I'm going to
[55:09] Egypt I'm going to deliver the people of
[55:12] Egypt the people of
[55:15] Israel and Moses when you even were you
[55:17] were 40
[55:20] years you were you were running
[55:23] away you are not 120
[55:26] [Music]
[55:29] weak you are not strong and during that
[55:33] time
[55:35] Egypt was the most powerful
[55:40] country with the elite
[55:51] Army that
[55:53] nobody you can read that Bible story
[55:57] they they could capture and fight and
[55:59] Conquer whoever they want to
[56:03] conquer and you see Moses holding his
[56:07] steak Moses where are you
[56:10] going I'm going to
[56:12] Egypt what are you going to do in
[56:15] Egypt you are almost
[56:17] dying you are almost about to die what
[56:21] are you going to do in
[56:22] Egypt I'm going to deliver the people of
[56:25] Israel H Moses where is your
[56:29] army H maybe Moses was coming with his
[56:34] soldiers but Moses has no Soldiers with
[56:38] him and he said he's
[56:41] going to deliver the people of
[56:44] Israel and that is
[56:47] strange why this man has met
[56:51] God and all those people laughing at
[56:54] Moses they didn't meet God with
[56:57] Moses they didn't meet God with
[57:00] Moses meet God with
[57:03] Moses but Moses had an encounter
[57:06] alone mes is not Moses is having a faith
[57:10] in
[57:11] God Moses not having a faith in
[57:14] God because Moses asked
[57:17] God what if the person ask me of a
[57:23] sign then say Moses Moses what do you
[57:26] have in your
[57:27] hand he said oh a steak so Moses put it
[57:30] on the floor it turned into a snake said
[57:34] really really how strange is this
[57:38] man he's talking from a burning
[57:44] bush I plac my stick on the
[57:47] floor and it has turned into a
[57:51] snake then he said
[57:53] Moses hold hold the tail of the
[57:56] snake it turned into the
[57:59] steak
[58:01] wowow what is
[58:03] happening the encounter with god build
[58:07] your faith in God that's the reason why
[58:11] we need to have that
[58:13] encounter then Moses
[58:16] ask another sign another one another
[58:23] sign God told
[58:25] Moses put your hand over
[58:30] here then remove your
[58:33] hand
[58:35] leprosy and during that time leprosy was
[58:39] the worst
[58:42] disease and Moses
[58:47] was and Moses go said don't
[58:50] worry put your hand
[58:55] back
[58:57] again now so if
[58:59] Moses is going to deliver the people
[59:02] of he has not have faith in
[59:05] God that the God turned the the stick to
[59:11] snake or the the god that made me a
[59:15] leper is with me is with me and Moses
[59:22] Was Not
[59:23] Afraid of the army of pharaoh that is
[59:28] what Encounter of God that is what faith
[59:33] can do for me and you my brother I want
[59:37] to tell you something today if you need
[59:39] something from
[59:41] God just have
[59:43] faith because it is
[59:45] written it is written in the Book of
[59:49] John Chapter 14 verse
[59:54] 14 that if you shall ask anything in my
[59:58] name I will do it so the only thing is
[1:00:03] for me and you for me and you to ask God
[1:00:08] and believe the only thing that we need
[1:00:11] to believe is to have faith in God he
[1:00:15] said by Said by faith faith it was
[1:00:21] counted onto Abraham as
[1:00:24] righteousness no
[1:00:27] Abraham was 90
[1:00:30] years
[1:00:34] 90 when God let me move out of his
[1:00:39] country and God told Abraham you are
[1:00:43] going to have a
[1:00:45] son his wife
[1:00:48] Sarah was past the age of
[1:00:54] manul
[1:00:58] and God has told
[1:01:00] Abraham and God has told
[1:01:03] Abraham your wife
[1:01:05] Sarah is going to give birth to a
[1:01:09] son it takes only
[1:01:11] Faith to believe
[1:01:13] this and he said
[1:01:16] said when Abraham heard the word when
[1:01:20] brother had the word no Abraham H
[1:01:23] Abraham had the word
[1:01:27] he said he went to the shop he went to
[1:01:29] the shop and start buying baby
[1:01:35] clothes and when people see
[1:01:38] him Abraham what are you taking all this
[1:01:44] to oh God has told me I'm going to have
[1:01:46] a
[1:01:49] son like
[1:01:50] Jing your wife has passed
[1:01:54] menopause you have pass you know you are
[1:01:59] weak how can you have
[1:02:02] pleasure and give
[1:02:04] birth and they were mocking
[1:02:08] Abraham they were laughing at him but
[1:02:11] then Abraham go to the
[1:02:13] doctor with Sarah said
[1:02:17] Doctor what is the
[1:02:19] problem so oh I want you to check my
[1:02:23] wife if she's pregnant
[1:02:26] and then the doctor will say

[1:03:54] andah said the promise
[1:03:57] Ted The Promise Ted The Promise the
[1:04:01] promise that Abraham is going to have a
[1:04:07] son took a longer
[1:04:10] time and he said and the
[1:04:13] woman and the woman the woman lost faith
[1:04:18] lost faith in the
[1:04:21] word do you know that she lost faith you
[1:04:23] know what do you know she lost faith in
[1:04:26] the
[1:04:29] word do you know the woman Sarah lost
[1:04:32] faith in the
[1:04:36] word is because Sarah didn't meet
[1:04:41] God it was Abraham that met
[1:04:44] God and Abraham came to tell
[1:04:47] Sarah Abraham came to tell
[1:04:50] Sarah this is what God have
[1:04:53] said this is what God have
[1:04:56] said have you
[1:04:58] seen that half what somebody has
[1:05:02] said canot keep you
[1:05:06] forever but when you get your own
[1:05:09] Revelation when you get your own
[1:05:11] encounter with
[1:05:13] God he raise your
[1:05:16] faith so then sah
[1:05:21] suggested and you know how women
[1:05:24] are
[1:05:26] Abraham when God promised has been a
[1:05:29] long
[1:05:31] time God will give you a child has given
[1:05:34] long
[1:05:37] time week it's been 10 years since God
[1:05:39] has promised
[1:05:43] us with
[1:05:46] me why don't you take my my mid
[1:05:49] servant why don't you m
[1:05:54] servant hey guy
[1:05:58] and go in with her and give
[1:06:01] B and do you know
[1:06:04] something whenever
[1:06:06] man try to Aid or try to help the work
[1:06:11] of God there's all it brings all the
[1:06:14] time
[1:06:15] problem the first time a woman tried to
[1:06:20] interpret the word of God in the book in
[1:06:23] Genesis took your whole
[1:06:27] he brought
[1:06:28] sin the second
[1:06:31] time that what give bir
[1:06:34] ish that gave birth to ish he and
[1:06:38] Abraham gave birth to
[1:06:43] ish so when Abraham went in with hegi
[1:06:46] the m servant of Sarah he gave birth to
[1:06:54] is
[1:06:56] and the descendant of is is the
[1:06:59] Muslims the
[1:07:03] Muslims and what do we see
[1:07:06] today what do we see today what do see
[1:07:11] today is fighting
[1:07:14] everywhere fight fight
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:19] confusion is because Sarah lost faith in
[1:07:24] the word of God
[1:07:26] and tried to do it with his her
[1:07:30] wisdom and God saw that the woman has
[1:07:33] lost
[1:07:36] faith so God came
[1:07:38] down God came down when he was going to
[1:07:41] destroy Sodom and
[1:07:45] gomorra and said God
[1:07:48] Walk God Walk God was
[1:07:51] walking and Abraham met
[1:07:54] him and he said come to my house and he
[1:07:59] prepared
[1:08:01] meat and he ate with
[1:08:04] God and God said shall I hide shall I
[1:08:10] hide I hide hide what I'm going to do
[1:08:13] against from my servant
[1:08:17] Abraham and God told
[1:08:20] Abraham God told
[1:08:23] Abraham what he was going to do to Sodom
[1:08:26] and
[1:08:27] goor because God have seen Abraham has
[1:08:30] trusted and Abraham had faith in
[1:08:34] him and when God see that you have faith
[1:08:37] in
[1:08:39] God God
[1:08:43] see you can you can you can negotiate
[1:08:46] with God because Abraham now was asking
[1:08:50] God what if you go to Sodom and you get
[1:08:52] 100 people who believe in you will
[1:09:00] oh God said no I will not destroy
[1:09:02] it God asked Abraham said what of
[1:09:07] 50 then Abraham said what of
[1:09:11] 50 God said I will not destroy
[1:09:14] it God said Abraham said what of
[1:09:18] 30 so I'll will not destroy it Abram say
[1:09:22] what of
[1:09:23] 20 God say not destroy
[1:09:27] it what of
[1:09:30] 10 God I will not destroy it that is the
[1:09:33] position you can come with God that you
[1:09:36] can negotiate with God look at the
[1:09:39] lifestyle
[1:09:41] ofah look at the lifestyle
[1:09:45] of
[1:09:47] yeah was on the bed on the bed of
[1:09:52] death and scripture said he turned onto
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:59] wall and started crying and praying he
[1:10:02] said God I've worshiped you God I have
[1:10:05] believed in you and said God added 15
[1:10:08] years to his
[1:10:11] age God added 15 years to his
[1:10:17] age this is what we can do we can create
[1:10:22] life we can create life we can bring
[1:10:25] things into existence he's just
[1:10:28] believing in God he was dying God sent
[1:10:31] the prophet go tell isah you are about
[1:10:32] to
[1:10:34] die isah heard the word of God isah
[1:10:37] heard the word of God and didn't tell
[1:10:40] the prophet is prophet Isaiah he didn't
[1:10:43] talk to the Prophet The Prophet tried to
[1:10:46] plead with God for God to have mercy on
[1:10:50] me he didn't tell the
[1:10:52] prophet that talk to God for God to have
[1:10:56] mercy on me but himself he turned to the
[1:10:59] wall and KN down and started praying and
[1:11:02] said God I've been faithful to you I
[1:11:05] believe in you I have walk in your way
[1:11:07] and God listen to his
[1:11:09] prayer the power that we have don't let
[1:11:13] the devil cheat you of that power don't
[1:11:15] let the devil cheat you out of the
[1:11:17] blessings of God you need to exercise
[1:11:19] every Power you to obtain every promise
[1:11:21] and every gift that accompan this
[1:11:23] Christian Life
[1:11:26] every gift that accomp this
[1:11:30] life what I'm telling you
[1:11:34] Isiah he prayed
[1:11:37] himself so whatever you are going
[1:11:40] through you can talk to God
[1:11:43] yourself and God is going to turn the
[1:11:47] situation
[1:11:50] around so God now came to
[1:11:54] Abraham and God told
[1:11:56] Abraham said God intentionally he knew
[1:12:00] what Sarah is going to
[1:12:01] do
[1:12:06] intentionally and God
[1:12:10] said oh you are going to give birth to a
[1:12:14] boy give birth to a
[1:12:18] boy and say Sarah
[1:12:20] laugh in her heart that is serious that
[1:12:25] is serious she laugh in her heart that
[1:12:30] after have grown
[1:12:32] old and pass the age of
[1:12:35] menopause pass the age of
[1:12:40] Mena and my husband has no
[1:12:44] pleasure how
[1:12:46] come and God
[1:12:48] said Sarah where is your
[1:12:51] wife and God said Sarah Abraham
[1:12:56] why did Sarah
[1:12:58] laugh and Abraham ran to his
[1:13:01] wife and asked did you laugh and he said
[1:13:04] no I didn't
[1:13:07] laugh and God Abra Abraham came back to
[1:13:11] God and said she said he didn't laugh
[1:13:14] and God said didn't she say in her
[1:13:18] heart after I've have grown
[1:13:20] old the way some of us the some of us
[1:13:25] some of
[1:13:26] us when the pastor is
[1:13:29] preaching you are condemning the pastor
[1:13:31] in your head or in your
[1:13:34] heart said those things sound louder
[1:13:39] they sound
[1:13:41] louder than saying it with your
[1:13:44] mouth so we have to be
[1:13:47] careful with whatever we
[1:13:50] think with whatever we plan in our
[1:13:53] heart you know B said
[1:13:57] sometimes it is not the
[1:14:00] ACT but it is the
[1:14:02] heart that's what he said the other I
[1:14:06] read from 2 Chronicles chapter 25
[1:14:12] verse1 Amah did what was perfect and
[1:14:16] right in the sight of
[1:14:24] godia
[1:14:33] yeah but not with a a perfect
[1:14:38] heart he did what was right in
[1:14:41] God so some people will be doing the
[1:14:44] right
[1:14:45] thing but not with a perfect
[1:14:48] heart let us check the conditions of our
[1:14:51] heart let what let us make sure the
[1:14:53] conditions of our heart is all the time
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:58] right you hear some people also say
[1:15:02] Christianity is hard by the
[1:15:04] heart it doesn't matter what you
[1:15:07] do but if your heart is
[1:15:09] right your attitude will be
[1:15:13] right if your heart is
[1:15:16] right your behavior will be
[1:15:19] right and God
[1:15:22] said Sarah didn't say in your
[1:15:27] heart after I've grown
[1:15:31] old I have grown
[1:15:34] old how can I give
[1:15:37] birth how can
[1:15:39] I God says oh the prophet said he shook
[1:15:44] Sarah it shook Sarah itook
[1:15:51] yeah and it quickened her fi Quicken her
[1:15:56] faith her faith
[1:15:59] yeah that what I was thinking in my
[1:16:03] heart this man has been able to say
[1:16:09] it said God
[1:16:13] visitation God's visitation was to raise
[1:16:16] the faith of
[1:16:18] Sarah so that you could believe the
[1:16:21] promise and God said a year by this time
[1:16:26] a year by this time a year by
[1:16:29] time and the next year they had a son
[1:16:32] called
[1:16:34] Isaac that means that God has the things
[1:16:36] for
[1:16:37] you but if you lose faith in
[1:16:40] God it is not going to come to
[1:16:44] pass the
[1:16:47] healing the
[1:16:49] blessing the whatever you are thinking
[1:16:52] of God has it in place for you
[1:16:56] but if you lose faith in God you will
[1:16:59] never get it that is the important of
[1:17:02] faith I say if you have faith you can
[1:17:06] create into
[1:17:08] existence you hav heard of the squar
[1:17:11] talk
[1:17:13] about creates squar out of into
[1:17:17] existence he create
[1:17:19] squar he created animals or
[1:17:22] rat into existence they were not there
[1:17:26] but he
[1:17:27] created it's just Faith so one
[1:17:32] day entered a
[1:17:35] temple sorry Braham entered a
[1:17:41] hospital and this
[1:17:43] lady was sick and
[1:17:46] said do you know you can be
[1:17:52] healed do you have faith and she said
[1:17:56] she said yes and said Do you believe
[1:18:01] this F
[1:18:06] can he said yes you believe said Do you
[1:18:10] believe you can make this fun
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:15] 10 the lady said no that one I don't
[1:18:19] believe then said then you don't have
[1:18:23] faith and said at a
[1:18:25] fun and he started
[1:18:29] turning why did bra do
[1:18:32] that is just to raise the faith of the
[1:18:35] lady and she prayed for
[1:18:38] her and cancer
[1:18:41] vanish is the the power of
[1:18:44] faith if you desire something from
[1:18:47] God if you desire something from
[1:18:52] God and you have faith and you believe
[1:18:56] is going to
[1:18:57] happen no there is power in
[1:19:01] faith because if you have faith you can
[1:19:05] create
[1:19:07] whatever because God has given you that
[1:19:12] power but all that you need to do is to
[1:19:16] align yourself with God and will break
[1:19:19] that
[1:19:20] power it is not only in
[1:19:23] me it is in me it is in
[1:19:29] you but for we to operate
[1:19:34] it we need to align with
[1:19:37] God said you see the
[1:19:40] car it's just a
[1:19:42] mechanics the car the it's just the
[1:19:46] mechanics the
[1:19:49] mechanics but without a foel that is the
[1:19:53] Dynamics
[1:19:57] it cannot move it cannot move so you we
[1:20:02] are the
[1:20:03] mechanics the Holy Ghost is the
[1:20:05] Dynamics we need to align ourself with
[1:20:08] God then we can operate my brother if
[1:20:13] you align yourself with God you will
[1:20:15] never need anything in this
[1:20:17] world because whatever you want whatever
[1:20:20] you
[1:20:21] want whatever you desire you just to ask
[1:20:25] God you just need to talk to
[1:20:27] God no brother Abraham wanted a
[1:20:31] son wanted a
[1:20:36] son Joseph he said after he has read the
[1:20:40] lifestyle of Joseph in the
[1:20:42] Bible after he has read the lifestyle of
[1:20:45] Joseph in the
[1:20:47] Bible desired to have a
[1:20:51] son and name it
[1:20:53] Joseph but could you imagine the first
[1:20:56] chch he had was a
[1:21:05] girl and they said maybe you name her
[1:21:09] Josephine and he said no God promised
[1:21:12] me that I'll have a son and named him
[1:21:16] Joseph and today I have brother William
[1:21:19] Joseph
[1:21:22] Braham faith in the word of God
[1:21:25] it's
[1:21:27] faith and that
[1:21:29] faith is for us just to believe in God
[1:21:33] and if you just believe in God and you
[1:21:36] speak so Jesus said Mountain be
[1:21:41] mve the mountain will be
[1:21:44] moved Mountain be
[1:21:46] moved the mountain will be moved there
[1:21:50] is something in
[1:21:51] us the devil is just creating fear
[1:21:57] that's for this is still huge this is
[1:21:59] not possible this sickness cannot be
[1:22:03] cured because when you have that
[1:22:06] fear you won believe in God you stop
[1:22:09] believing in God because you afraid
[1:22:13] sometime people are
[1:22:14] afraid that oh even sometime some
[1:22:18] pastors are afraid what if you pray for
[1:22:20] this person and he doesn't get well

[1:22:25] somebody get
[1:22:30] well your business is God said pray for
[1:22:34] him the rest is God's work and if God

[1:22:46] God will stand there or be there for his
[1:22:47] name to put to
[1:22:50] shame well and let's see if God will be
[1:22:53] there for his name to put
[1:23:04] shame and because God will
[1:23:07] never want his name to be pulled to
[1:23:13] Shon you will come and Grant that person
[1:23:17] healing but often
[1:23:19] times we are
[1:23:21] afraid what if I pray and the person
[1:23:24] does not get
