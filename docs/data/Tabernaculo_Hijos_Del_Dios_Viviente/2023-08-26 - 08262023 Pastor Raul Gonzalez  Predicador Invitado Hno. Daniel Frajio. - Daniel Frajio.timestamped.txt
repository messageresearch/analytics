[39:19] God bless you all this evening
[39:26] Estes
[39:40] [Music]
[39:50] you would think by now I would remember
[39:53] to turn on a microphone
[39:55] [Applause]
[39:59] but we're thankful to God to be here
[40:04] we thank our brother Raul for invitation
[40:08] and we certainly enjoyed the fellowship
[40:13] the last two Services
[40:29] sometimes the word that comes is
[40:31] Evangelistic
[40:34] sometimes the word comes up in an
[40:36] Apostolic way
[40:39] sometimes the word is
[40:45] the teachers and pastors
[40:48] and we appreciate them all foreign
[41:28] because amongst the world there was no
[41:30] one greater
[41:33] Jesus said he was a prophet
[41:37] but I say unto you more than a prophet
[41:41] for he was an Elijah Ministry okay
[41:45] who would foreign
[42:05] [Applause]
[42:39] so we're thankful to be here tonight
[42:43] a little church there in Phoenix Arizona
[42:47] Phoenix Arizona
[42:49] we've uh from uh Tucson Arizona
[42:54] where we lived for many years
[42:57] and yet I wasn't born in Tucson
[43:01] we were born in Los Angeles California
[43:03] Los Angeles California so I hope you
[43:05] don't hold that against me
[43:08] but we're grateful to God to be here
[43:12] and God gathers his little bride from
[43:15] all over the world
[43:21] and she belongs to and she's in many
[43:24] different places
[43:26] but God knows
[43:29] if you'll turn with me in your Bibles
[43:32] tonight
[43:33] we'd like to take and read from Matthew
[43:36] 5 and verse 48.
[43:41] a very familiar scripture to us
[43:46] it's the last verse
[43:48] chapter five
[43:51] given the title of the Beatitudes
[43:57] but it's it's and that's a good and
[44:00] that's a good uh title for it yes
[44:02] but it doesn't really describe what
[44:05] Jesus was teaching
[44:08] indeed he was teaching it in a parable
[44:13] for that was the problem
[44:23] and without Parables he would not speak
[44:26] anything
[44:46] [Music]
[45:03] it's really
[45:05] is
[45:27] for perfect
[45:29] foreign
[46:10] in Matthew and Mateo
[46:13] The Book of Matthew chapter 13.
[46:16] you can turn with me if you'd like
[46:22] and verse
[46:25] 34.
[46:30] and it's it's the parable of the sower
[46:32] as you all know
[46:36] and Jesus is finishing up
[46:40] it was really a teaching
[46:42] the seat of the serpents
[46:45] there was a teaching on that this human
[46:47] race has two fathers
[46:51] that there is a
[47:02] and one of the children of the kingdom
[47:05] of God
[47:07] and the other is the children of the
[47:10] devil Jesus
[47:17] Jesus was uncovering great Mysteries
[47:22] that had happened since the Book of
[47:24] Genesis
[47:29] all these things fake Jesus into the
[47:32] multitude and Parables
[47:36] and without a Parables
[47:41] and the question would be why is
[47:44] verse 34 tells us
[47:47] because every Bible question you might
[47:50] have okay
[47:55] and many times the answer is in the next
[47:58] verse
[48:16] [Music]
[48:52] that it might be fulfilled which was
[48:54] spoken by the prophet saying I'll open
[48:56] my mouth in Parables a lot of things
[48:58] which have been kept secret from the
[49:00] foundation of the world
[49:08] del Mundo then Jesus entrances
[49:40] and went into the house
[49:45] like he has here this evening
[49:48] he's come to this house
[49:50] with his disciples
[49:55] can the disciples saying declare unto us
[49:58] the parable of the Terrors of the field
[50:00] is
[50:09] the son of man
[50:11] and he began revealing to them
[51:11] for a period of 40 days
[51:16] I was just about to ascend upon him
[51:20] and he gave a Great Commission to his
[51:23] church
[51:33] then it must be according to the word
[51:39] be a parable for sure
[51:42] hidden in his words
[51:45] and Jesus in verse 18
[51:48] and spake unto them Jesus
[51:51] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[51:54] Earth
[52:09] teaching them to observe all things
[52:23] so what's the what was the true baptism
[52:26] of the words of Jesus
[52:28] the Great Commission
[52:31] how many years believe Jesus
[52:50] baptizing name of the father autism
[53:01] as Pentecostal people
[53:06] when I was in that denomination
[53:11] we believed we didn't talk about it
[53:15] talked about Acts 2 38.
[53:18] and for us the two scriptures hit like
[53:21] two kids
[53:25] and we would talk with with those who
[53:28] were a trinitarian beliefs
[53:34] and you can go ahead and believe
[53:40] fishermen if you want um
[53:44] but we stand with Jesus they said
[53:51] they'd say what do you think about that
[53:53] so
[53:56] we struggled with that so
[54:02] until the Revelation came
[54:05] everything that Jesus said
[54:08] was in a parable
[54:33] yes it's true
[55:17] just
[55:20] like uh
[55:22] just like uh many of the evangelists
[55:25] preached in that era um
[55:28] but the time would come he would enter
[55:30] into the ministry
[55:37] you say no no he was always alive
[55:48] Jesus Jesus he came to his room we know
[55:51] Israel as the lion of the tribe of Judah
[55:54] was he at that time the Lamb of God a
[56:09] when he took his 12 disciples and gave
[56:11] him a commission
[56:14] he said go only to the Lost tribe of
[56:17] Israel
[56:20] to the Jewish people
[56:22] don't talk to no one else
[56:25] This is Gospel
[56:29] only to the Jews because he came first
[56:33] to Israel Israel he came first in the
[56:37] ministry of the Lion of the tribe of
[56:39] Jews
[56:41] it was when Israel rejected
[56:45] and what they rejected was the opening
[56:49] of the books
[56:54] [Applause]
[57:15] the island
[57:21] as a child I read it many times
[57:24] but when I heard the prophets speak of
[57:27] it more deeply
[57:29] fundamentally I realized as many times
[57:31] as I had read it
[57:34] I've never understood
[57:37] and he talks about Joseph
[57:39] takes his two sons
[57:44] according to the custom and the ritual
[57:47] of the Jewish people
[57:48] with this great patriarch
[57:53] speak the blessing to Joseph's two sons
[57:57] you remember the stories
[58:16] opportunity
[58:43] [Applause]
[59:16] Libro
[59:50] [Music]
[1:00:16] it's what Israel lost
[1:00:18] so the first time
[1:00:30] it was this day in the days of the
[1:00:33] ministry of Jesus
[1:00:36] the line of the tribe of Jesus
[1:00:39] Remember Revelations five and five
[1:00:43] John was weeping and crying
[1:00:46] an elder Rose
[1:01:29] because you know whose book it was
[1:01:30] foreign
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:29] ready it was already prophesied she
[1:02:31] would Rejects
[1:02:39] Ocho
[1:03:02] and it says be therefore perfect it is
[1:03:06] your father which is in heaven is
[1:03:08] perfect
[1:03:12] or is it a parable is there more hidden
[1:03:16] in the statement
[1:03:19] our first reaction
[1:03:21] as human beings is to say no this is not
[1:03:26] we can't be perfect
[1:03:30] I'm 68 years old
[1:03:33] I've been trying for 68 years
[1:03:39] so we can't be perfect
[1:03:47] they're in Phoenix I am Phoenix he's the
[1:03:50] pastor of uh of a church called CCV
[1:03:56] and it's a mega church
[1:03:59] they have several congregations
[1:04:04] this one has five
[1:04:16] his name was bertres Burg you're a
[1:04:19] pastor
[1:04:21] and uh so uh I also I'm a believer of
[1:04:25] God's word
[1:04:27] I tell them how about if we talk about
[1:04:30] us what we're working okay
[1:04:32] Daniel
[1:04:44] you can't not we cannot be made perfect
[1:04:48] I said but Jesus said therefore
[1:04:52] perfectly
[1:04:56] to to shoot
[1:05:00] how perfect
[1:05:02] even as your father which is
[1:05:26] I said
[1:05:49] so where are the
[1:05:53] so we can take
[1:05:55] could it be in the previous 47 verses
[1:06:07] and we need to sit down as God for
[1:06:10] Revelation
[1:06:13] brother Daniel I'm not educated
[1:06:16] I'm not talking about education
[1:06:29] she said if I cannot Touch the Hem of
[1:06:31] His garments
[1:06:35] that was not written anywhere in the old
[1:06:38] testamentally
[1:06:41] I don't know where in the scriptures
[1:06:43] that they had or the prophets was that
[1:06:45] written down
[1:07:00] she said if I can just do this wonderful
[1:07:03] things
[1:07:38] of the previous 47 verses
[1:07:42] perfecto
[1:07:59] Hebrews 11.
[1:08:01] verse 39.
[1:08:07] and these all have been obtained a good
[1:08:10] report through faith
[1:08:14] to receive not the promise
[1:08:17] of perfection the Perfection there was a
[1:08:20] reason because God have been provided so
[1:08:24] a better thing for us
[1:08:44] Hebrews 6 and verse 1.
[1:08:48] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:08:51] doctrine of Christ for let us go on
[1:08:53] important
[1:08:58] not laying again the foundation of
[1:09:00] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[1:09:02] toward God
[1:09:07] so affection in the New Testament
[1:09:09] Perfection
[1:09:16] the dictionary
[1:09:18] it gives us meanings
[1:09:23] one is to make something
[1:09:27] Perfecto to bring something to an end
[1:09:32] to add what is lacking in order to
[1:09:35] render a full thing
[1:09:39] or to bring to an end as a goal
[1:09:43] finale or to bring to a close or
[1:09:46] fulfillment something by an event
[1:09:51] like the Prophecies of the scriptures
[1:09:56] a Bible definition yeah
[1:09:59] is it embargo it has nothing to do with
[1:10:02] perfection
[1:10:04] God promises
[1:10:06] that's not what Perfection means to God
[1:10:11] in the exposition of the seven churches
[1:10:15] as you know it was a book that brother
[1:10:18] Branham uh
[1:10:19] wrote
[1:10:21] with uh with the help of Brothers
[1:10:25] can they and they took them all what he
[1:10:28] had spoken he cannot reached on the
[1:10:31] seven Church ages
[1:10:37] and here he says how highly guard
[1:10:40] regards this outworking of our patients
[1:10:46] as seen in James 1 4.
[1:10:50] let patients have a perfect work
[1:10:55] he may be perfect an entire lacking
[1:10:58] nothing
[1:11:01] this is God's will for us is perfection
[1:11:06] and that Perfection is patience
[1:11:13] then he says this is
[1:11:16] the process it is uh
[1:12:06] take us
[1:12:16] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:12:19] the process to arrive to adoption
[1:12:23] is called the three steps of Grace
[1:12:28] speaking to uh a man not too long ago
[1:12:33] it had gone to a Baptist Seminary
[1:12:38] about this class he said three steps of
[1:12:41] Grace
[1:12:42] where did you get that from thistle I
[1:12:46] said you're a seminary Baptist preacher
[1:12:48] and don't know this is
[1:12:57] justification by faith
[1:13:00] sanctification by the
[1:13:02] spiritual the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:06] it is it is the components of the
[1:13:10] born-again experience
[1:13:13] there is this Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:13:16] baptism
[1:13:18] it's the beginning of this born-again
[1:13:21] experience
[1:13:26] it says

[1:21:17] do you believe it do you believe you've
[1:21:20] had that kind of relationship
[1:21:26] that's the kind of relationships
[1:21:38] in Hebrews 7. Paul tells the Hebrews in
[1:21:43] verse 18. for there is barely a distance
[1:21:47] of the Commandment
[1:21:49] going before for the weakness and
[1:21:52] unprofitableness thereof
[1:21:57] foreign
[1:22:32] also mentions them
[1:22:35] tells us how they're being disallowed
[1:22:41] by three Divine steps of Grace
[1:22:47] happiness to the fullness
[1:23:00] you can
[1:23:03] kill him
[1:23:16] self
[1:23:24] once again
[1:23:33] are hearing the same things that Adam
[1:23:35] heard
[1:23:37] because God wants to take you to the
[1:23:40] same place he wanted to take Adam
[1:23:44] you live in his presence
[1:23:52] foreign
[1:23:53] this is what Adam heard
[1:23:55] oh that day in Eden are getting it in
[1:23:58] maybe the day before they fell because
[1:24:04] Adam heard these words
[1:24:20] I want you to be there for
[1:24:24] Perfecto even as your father
[1:24:26] which is in heaven
[1:24:33] that's a new testament verse
[1:24:39] the word of God
[1:24:41] regardless of when it's spoken
[1:24:50] Eternal Word
[1:24:52] was it not in the mind of God before the
[1:24:55] foundation
[1:24:57] Matthew 5 48.
[1:25:04] and himself
[1:25:40] perfect even as your father
[1:25:46] justification by faith
[1:25:49] brings peace
[1:25:54] sanctification by the spirit
[1:26:13] [Applause]
[1:26:16] you might have had a genuine experience
[1:26:19] of justification by faith
[1:26:23] that Jesus died
[1:26:26] washed away all your passes
[1:26:32] Salvador
[1:26:52] and we see the man doing that
[1:26:55] and in our legalistic minds
[1:27:02] and yet
[1:27:04] he made very sincerely
[1:27:08] it had a true justification by faith
[1:27:11] experience
[1:27:17] second step of Grace
[1:27:20] Holy Spirit sanctifies the vessels
[1:27:25] you see the vessel it's been picked up
[1:27:27] out of the mighty clay and the mud
[1:27:32] justify my faith but it hasn't been
[1:27:35] washed yet
[1:27:41] that's the next step is when that man
[1:27:44] finally one day
[1:27:46] a month later
[1:27:50] years later
[1:27:53] he crumbles up that pack of cigarettes
[1:27:55] and throws it away
[1:27:59] I need to be a better example
[1:28:02] of this Jesus
[1:28:21] there was a family abuna Familia a man
[1:28:24] and his wife
[1:28:25] they had children my age
[1:28:29] and they come from a very harsh family

[1:28:47] I'm gonna go testify
[1:28:51] his family a lady's name was mercy
[1:28:58] and she's walking two blocks down the
[1:29:01] street
[1:29:08] in Grace of Jesus
[1:29:12] the other neighbors came out
[1:29:15] and tells her you know
[1:29:18] mom's name don't you go there
[1:29:44] Mercy gave her life to Jesus Christ
[1:29:49] foreign
[1:30:37] hello
[1:30:50] he was outside in the yard and in La
[1:30:54] Casa I said alone I just gave my life to
[1:30:57] Jesus Christ
[1:31:00] what hinders you
[1:31:03] I can see it you're struggling inside I
[1:31:06] know you want to give your life to it
[1:31:10] he said sit down boy
[1:31:14] he says you're right
[1:31:16] no and he was smoking yes but I can't
[1:31:19] stop smoking
[1:31:21] and I'm not going to get baptized
[1:31:29] Mercy had given her life to the Lord
[1:31:32] Jesus she was in her 30s
[1:31:36] have passed
[1:31:40] they were both about in their 70s
[1:31:42] already
[1:31:45] and one day he gets up in the morning
[1:31:49] almost 30 years had passed
[1:31:53] and he tells him
[1:31:56] I got up this morning
[1:31:59] can I grab that pack of cigarettes
[1:32:02] and I just hated them
[1:32:04] and I threw them in the garden
[1:32:08] and I've given my life to Jesus Christ
[1:32:13] [Applause]
[1:32:22] to uh
[1:32:24] their advice was divorce this man
[1:32:27] divorce yesterday the token is not in
[1:32:30] your home until you leave him and get
[1:32:31] away from him
[1:32:35] she told me one time
[1:32:39] I said don't leave him alone
[1:33:19] Matthew chapter 8
[1:33:21] verse
[1:33:23] Jesus had finished
[1:33:31] on the steps that it would take in your
[1:33:34] daily life
[1:33:36] and how to get
[1:33:39] to be perfect
[1:33:41] the Father which is in heaven is
[1:33:44] Perfecto here in chapter 8 he had
[1:33:46] brought his teaching to her clothes
[1:33:51] but not completely because later men
[1:33:55] like Peter Hombres
[1:33:59] of the New Testament
[1:34:02] would continue by the same Holy Spirit
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:12] where Jesus continued his teachings
[1:34:21] I say continue
[1:34:24] because when he began where he began it
[1:34:27] was when he told Nicodemus
[1:34:30] you must be born again
[1:34:34] unless you're born again
[1:34:36] you'll never get a revelation
[1:34:42] but that's that's not a difficult
[1:34:44] Revelation
[1:34:46] that's not a difficult Revelation is
[1:34:58] seven Thunders though
[1:35:02] is the voice of God
[1:35:04] revealing the open book but that's not
[1:35:08] where God wants
[1:35:11] because Seven Virtues
[1:35:20] [Music]
[1:35:39] Jesus is teaching
[1:35:43] he's going to give us the 47 steps
[1:35:47] of how to get to verse 48.
[1:35:50] because he said being either foreign
[1:36:28] of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:36:34] and
[1:36:43] he opened his mouth
[1:36:50] blessed are the porn spirit
[1:36:53] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[1:36:57] what's Jesus
[1:37:01] don't forget this is
[1:37:05] perfection
[1:37:10] what a teacher
[1:37:12] what an incredible teacher
[1:37:14] and yet he was speaking in a parable
[1:37:19] that's revealed to us now on this day
[1:37:24] okay
[1:37:26] so we're being taught by him
[1:37:30] we're being taught by him that was made
[1:37:33] perfect foreign
[1:37:52] if you want to become a millionaire
[1:37:55] it says You must talk to successful
[1:37:58] millionaires
[1:38:03] if you want to become a super athlete
[1:38:06] you will talk to men who are super
[1:38:09] athletes and have had great success
[1:38:18] you'd want to talk to men who were
[1:38:21] considered great Carpenters
[1:38:26] you want to be perfect
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:39:03] he was talking about an experience that
[1:39:06] he had yes
[1:39:30] and being made perfect
[1:39:44] unto all them
[1:39:49] [Applause]
[1:39:54] the last
[1:39:57] um
[1:39:59] patience waiting on God
[1:40:04] but it's really God who's been waiting
[1:40:06] on us
[1:40:10] this is a process of character
[1:40:12] development
[1:40:15] so now begins
[1:40:25] blessed are the porn spirit
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:30] theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:40:34] in spirit and Espiritu is two words but
[1:40:39] it also can be used as one word
[1:40:43] and when you put the two words in spirit
[1:40:48] in English you put them together
[1:40:52] then the world changes
[1:40:56] and it means to encourage
[1:41:00] um
[1:41:03] animal that means to Quicken somebody
[1:41:06] yes
[1:41:07] it has a positive meaning
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:29] we have five senses
[1:41:42] if you don't surrender this senses
[1:41:49] to use them more
[1:41:51] oftenaves to discourage
[1:41:54] rather than encourage
[1:41:57] we have five senses of the spirit
[1:42:01] Memorial
[1:42:07] and if you don't surrender these senses
[1:42:19] in the church
[1:42:24] when through these senses
[1:42:43] to this you hit this bottom place it's
[1:42:49] actually the beginning he is
[1:43:00] the beginning
[1:43:06] Matthew 5 3.3 you are or you were
[1:43:12] this one porn Spirit
[1:43:16] but blessed are the porn Spirit
[1:43:21] descends to your life
[1:43:38] Abraham's wife
[1:43:40] found herself porn spirit
[1:43:44] and it was ruined in her life
[1:43:51] he was ruining her relationship with her
[1:43:53] husband
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:44:02] in Genesis 18
[1:44:06] it begins the story
[1:44:09] of this little lady Sarah
[1:44:12] who is a shadow of a type of us today
[1:44:22] spiritual and verse 1 says on the Lord
[1:44:24] appeared unto him in the plains of
[1:44:26] memory
[1:44:28] and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat
[1:44:31] of the day
[1:44:34] the word
[1:44:36] it has different meanings
[1:44:39] as many words
[1:44:41] if it's used as a noun
[1:44:45] [Applause]
[1:44:47] it has different meanings
[1:44:50] what are those meanings of the word
[1:44:56] I don't want to read this the way that
[1:44:58] that definition is
[1:45:01] the Lord appeared unto him Abraham yes
[1:45:22] all three men stood by him
[1:45:24] and when he saw them he ran to meet them
[1:45:28] from the tent doors
[1:45:44] a prophet told us did you did you notice
[1:45:48] there was three men but he only
[1:45:51] acknowledged one
[1:45:53] and he called them my Lord the Greek
[1:45:56] word for Lord is
[1:46:00] the great sufficient one
[1:46:06] Abraham had never seen him before
[1:46:09] but when he heard that voice
[1:46:11] remember the prophet is
[1:46:31] from the Devils
[1:46:35] the angel of the Lord came down
[1:46:39] he
[1:46:42] saw it coming from outside
[1:47:12] this is the one yesterday
[1:47:20] [Music]
[1:47:31] [Music]
[1:47:36] foreign
[1:47:45] [Applause]
[1:48:05] foreign
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:08] was fighting with everyone at home
[1:49:24] and Abraham Henson hastened unto the
[1:49:26] 10th verse 6 unto Sarah and said make
[1:49:29] ready
[1:49:30] it's a fine meal need it and make cakes
[1:49:33] upon the heart foreign
[1:50:22] for the vision that was in his mind
[1:50:29] God doesn't get a hold of get ahead of
[1:50:32] his plan
[1:50:33] neither is he ever one minute late
[1:50:37] always on time
[1:50:41] and then they said unto him
[1:50:45] for it was the purpose they came foreign
[1:51:00] and he said I will certainly return unto
[1:51:03] thee according to the time of life
[1:51:08] Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:51:13] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:51:15] which was behind him is
[1:51:36] sign of the Messiah
[1:51:46] and he said I will certainly return unto
[1:51:48] you according to the time
[1:51:53] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:51:57] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:52:00] which was behind him
[1:52:03] now Abraham and Sarah were well old and
[1:52:06] stricken in age
[1:52:09] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:52:12] manner of women
[1:52:14] and because Sarah knew this is
[1:52:17] that having a son now was impossible
[1:52:21] human The Impossible
[1:52:24] armed with this human understanding
[1:52:29] then it caused Sarah to laugh
[1:52:32] within yourself
[1:52:35] after I'm wax old shall I have pleasure
[1:52:38] my Lord being old also this place is
[1:52:50] yes
[1:53:17] a woman foreign
[1:54:18] that's what the devil wants you to
[1:54:20] believe
[1:54:23] Sarah never doubted God
[1:54:26] she just said yes
[1:54:30] doesn't Abraham understand
[1:54:35] for me is
[1:54:40] that was a woman
[1:54:41] maybe tonight it's a man
[1:54:45] in that way
[1:54:49] can't you see thanks for the word
[1:54:52] thanks for the encouragement
[1:54:55] of what you don't understand
[1:54:58] it's too late for me
[1:55:00] Sarah
[1:55:05] a Believer
[1:55:06] but simply not believing
[1:55:10] a promise
[1:55:17] she couldn't remember
[1:55:20] in all her 90 years
[1:55:22] when an old woman
[1:55:26] in her imaginations
[1:55:36] she said no this is this would not be
[1:55:38] right
[1:55:41] human affections
[1:56:00] it's too late for me
[1:56:05] and all her five senses
[1:56:16] we must believe God's word
[1:56:23] she had hit poverty level
[1:56:28] she was poor in spirit
[1:56:33] as a human being could get
[1:56:39] she was mad at Abraham yes
[1:57:26] Genesis 18 and verse 13.
[1:57:30] and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:57:34] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:57:37] have a surety bear childhood
[1:57:44] God was not Discerning her condition
[1:57:49] as his Discerning yours tonight
[1:58:09] and there's nothing she can do about it
[1:58:15] Hebrews 4 12

[2:01:21] but it would not be the last time
[2:01:26] Genesis 21.

[2:01:34] upon lines
[2:01:46] and the Lord visited Sarah this is
