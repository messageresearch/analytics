[10:42] and the prophet told us
[10:45] those Seven Seals
[10:47] it's the whole book it's bullied Genesis
[11:04] we'd like to begin in Revelations
[11:07] chapter 8.
[11:11] and verse
[11:15] Revelations chapter six
[11:19] uh is is John Cena vision
[11:24] of the first six seals
[11:27] and then it goes into Revelation seven
[11:30] you know

[11:34] is the prophet taught us
[11:38] it was a time of real world war one and
[11:41] World War II yeah

[13:39] [Music]
[13:45] there was silence in heaven about the
[13:48] space of a half hour
[13:54] and and and we look at this scripture
[13:58] and we see that's all that's said
[14:04] and we think how could we possibly
[14:06] understand our understandings
[14:10] but the way we'll understand it tonight

[22:21] messenger of the seventh seal and 5100
[22:24] message
[22:27] in Revelation 10.
[22:30] it's a revelation
[22:33] yes was the seventh seal era
[22:37] now he's connected
[22:41] so now we thought we thought that the
[22:45] seventh seal or Apen that only one verse
[22:49] was written about it in the Bible
[23:08] so now we have 11 more verses
[23:13] describing to us
[23:24] [Music]
[23:36] the Fig Tree Israel but uh in other
[23:39] words and again I grow the Bright Tree a
[23:41] gentile bride but another word
[23:43] that's you someone said that's me
[23:49] connect with it
[23:54] in 1963.
[23:59] there was a man called James E MacDonald
[24:03] he was the head of the science
[24:06] department
[24:12] they're in Tucson and he wrote up a
[24:17] scientific page on on the cloud that
[24:21] appeared yes
[24:31] was widely observed over Northern
[24:33] Arizona
[24:40] 1963
[24:48] report
[24:55] s to report there is no
[24:57] weird
[25:06] condition all over Arizona from every
[25:09] angle yeah
[25:10] [Music]
[25:15] based on four photos
[25:40] about 280 miles from the clouds
[25:44] almost 300 miles away is
[25:51] [Music]
[26:00] a
[26:21] hit the crowd but it's unusually Great
[26:25] Heights but also
[26:28] an unusually low altitude
[26:32] because it's remarkable shape is
[26:36] suggests that it was a cloud
[26:41] I've previously unrecorded time
[26:45] in other words The History of Science
[27:05] because when we read foreign
[27:26] but when we read what this man James
[27:29] MacDonald said
[27:33] he said this Cloud
[27:36] remained Sunday as dual uh
[27:41] for 28 minutes
[27:44] after the sun went down
[27:51] when the seven seal was open
[27:55] there was silence in heaven
[27:57] about the space of 28 minutes
[28:04] [Music]
[28:05] John said about a half hour
[28:20] [Music]
[28:46] to verse 11.
[28:52] and it reads like this
[28:55] and he said unto them it is not for you
[28:58] to know the time through the seasons
[28:59] which the father has put in his own
[29:01] powers
[29:07] but you shall receive power after the
[29:10] Holy Ghost has come apart
[29:17] from Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[29:20] Samaria is

[1:04:01] out
[1:04:02] what was sealed inside this mountain yes
[1:04:13] to be interpreted
[1:04:17] to say the first angel on the first time

[1:04:40] we have ever heard in our life
[1:04:53] when it happened to any of you
[1:04:59] voices
[1:05:08] and the message is this is a sign of the
[1:05:10] answer yeah
[1:05:18] now when he begins to sound
[1:05:22] that he was him
[1:05:27] but he pushes it off like it's someone
[1:05:30] else
[1:05:33] [Applause]
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:02] when all the Mysteries of the book has
[1:06:05] been completed

[1:06:10] that he would finish the Mysteries
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:22] he has told us that Revelation
[1:06:27] just told us that Revelation stands
[1:06:30] it says he has told us that Revelation
[1:06:34] stands
[1:06:35] is the time when the seven seal was open
[1:06:42] foreign
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:30] give out them together
[1:07:34] all right he said Revelation 10 is the
[1:07:37] right age
[1:07:42] foreign
[1:08:14] it says
[1:08:17] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:08:20] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[1:08:22] hand to heaven
[1:08:27] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:08:30] ever
[1:08:34] and the things they're in yeah
[1:08:38] and the things that are there in yes
[1:08:41] and the things
[1:08:44] that there should be time no longer
[1:08:49] yeah
[1:08:50] the time hand through the preaching of
[1:08:52] the seals
[1:08:55] yes
[1:09:00] it's all been there it's all in there
[1:09:04] time didn't end
[1:09:10] what happened was
[1:09:13] the Mysteries were revealed foreign
[1:09:43] [Music]
[1:10:06] video The Mysteries was revealed
[1:10:12] yes
[1:10:22] this must be a post-millennialist
[1:10:28] or something or someone that asked a
[1:10:31] question
[1:10:32] because see we got a thousand years
[1:10:34] after the church has gone home
[1:10:41] then times
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:11:14] Revelations
[1:11:17] let's read it again
[1:11:28] man Revelations 10 and verse 7.
[1:11:33] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:11:35] seventh Angels
[1:11:41] if God should be finished
[1:11:50] in the message I have heard but now I
[1:11:53] see and if it's nothing
[1:12:04] the prophet had less than 30 days to
[1:12:06] live
[1:12:10] in this message
[1:12:15] he said now we're promised a church age
[1:12:18] to reformers
[1:12:28] the church
[1:12:37] have we had them already
[1:12:39] and he says and we've had them but they
[1:12:43] promised their Malachi foreign
[1:13:38] denomination
[1:13:42] pieces till it's dead
[1:13:47] it's been a carrier
[1:13:51] and then he promised in the hour of the
[1:13:54] seventh Angel's message
[1:14:05] the mysteries of God will be declared
[1:14:09] and he says
[1:14:11] yes and the Seven Angel begins to sound
[1:14:15] this message
[1:14:17] and the question for us
[1:14:20] has been for years
[1:14:41] [Music]
[1:14:43] when did this prophecy come to pass
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:15:19] of Japan
[1:15:24] is
[1:16:24] he's showing you the best turn of the
[1:16:26] ministry of Jesus
[1:16:37] Jesus when he started out he started
[1:16:41] Healing The Sick and Afflicted
[1:16:47] everybody wanted him in his church
[1:16:53] at one time
[1:17:06] when he said except you eat the Flesh of
[1:17:09] the son of man and drink his blood you
[1:17:11] have no life
