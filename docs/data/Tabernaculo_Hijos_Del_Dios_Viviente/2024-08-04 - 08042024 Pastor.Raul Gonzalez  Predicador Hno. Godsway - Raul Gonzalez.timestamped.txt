[1:20] time I was glad when they said me let is
[1:24] go into the house of the
[1:28] Lord and said forget not the of the
[1:31] saint forget
[1:39] not come to
[1:41] church know I used we don't come to meet
[1:44] our friends our
[1:47] brothers we come to meet Jesus
[1:53] Christ it's an individual
[2:01] is between you and
[2:04] CHR so if you walk into the of the
[2:08] Lord don't be worried about whatever is
[2:12] going
[2:16] on
[2:18] Jacob meeting Jesus meeting Jesus at
[2:21] Bethlehem at
[2:25] Beth he say he wrestle with the Lord he
[2:29] wrestle with
[2:31] until his name was changed on
[2:35] Israel and when we come in the
[2:38] prayer and we know Jesus is here then
[2:42] what stop you what stop you what stops
[2:47] you from reaching out to
[2:51] Christ now say that you might be worried
[2:55] with a lot of test throughout the week
[3:01] that is fine but Jesus is here he's
[3:05] asking if you could give him all your
[3:07] burdens all your worries all your troubl
[3:09] you take care of
[3:13] it no you just don't have to worry
[3:17] much you just have to believe that he
[3:21] here and he here to H all your
[3:28] needs all that is to have the
[3:32] faith and ask and believe he's going to
[3:36] do
[3:37] it no I just don't I don't need to know
[3:39] what you are going
[3:42] through but I'm assuring that Jesus
[3:45] Christ is
[3:47] here and you have to speak to
[3:49] him you know God is for
[3:52] us God is for you and God is for me and
[3:57] so God is here because of you and me
[4:02] so if you realize how important you are
[4:04] to
[4:07] God then you not let the
[4:10] devil trust you
[4:13] about on things that are not
[4:16] important on that are not
[4:21] important and I'm happy to see all of
[4:23] you here this
[4:26] morning you know a blessing to follow
[4:29] fellowship with the children of
[4:33] God because whenever we
[4:36] gather our Lord is in our
[4:39] midst our Lord is in our
[4:43] midst know as I was I was
[4:47] coming and I was thinking about a lot of
[4:50] things and I was looking every time we
[4:53] tend to worry also about a lot of things
[5:00] said something so much I'm interested
[5:04] in he said the Battle Ground is the mind
[5:08] the Battle
[5:12] Ground and that is where you need to win
[5:15] your
[5:17] Victory so it is in your mind you have
[5:20] to come to the
[5:22] realization the
[5:24] agreement that I am a
[5:27] Christian and after that
[5:30] then you have to make a step towards
[5:32] it a step towards
[5:35] it but said the
[5:39] mind is a free
[5:45] ground
[5:49] yeah it's
[5:53] not it is neither for God nor for the
[5:57] devil nor for the devil
[6:00] no not for any of them
[6:04] yeah and any idea can comes in
[6:09] there but God has given a power and an
[6:14] ability to make a
[6:17] decision to let who to stay and who to
[6:20] re your
[6:25] life you know one way the other one way
[6:30] or the
[6:31] other we are in battle on this
[6:36] Earth and whether you want to accept it
[6:40] or
[6:41] not whether you want to accept or
[6:44] not we fight every day every
[6:50] second and you know as
[6:54] Christians we also fight a
[6:57] battle because we are soldiers of the
[7:02] cross and if we Are
[7:04] Soldiers then we are supposed to fight
[7:06] for a
[7:10] CA and I want to quick I want us to
[7:12] quickly open our
[7:15] Bible to Ephesians 6 ver2
[7:19] [Music]
[7:44] Ephesians verse
[7:47] 12 for we restle not against flesh and
[7:55] blood but against principalities
[7:59] against
[8:01] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[8:04] this
[8:07] world against spiritual wickedness in
[8:10] high
[8:14] places I want to wait here
[8:17] later I want to stand here later stand
[8:20] on this
[8:22] scripture know I like to understand that
[8:24] we are in a
[8:27] battle and we in a
[8:31] fight but we want to see the kind of
[8:33] fight we are into as
[8:38] Christians is it is it going to take a
[8:43] gun or grab some Cutlas grab some Cutlas
[8:47] or
[8:49] knife or Spar an
[8:52] arrow an
[8:56] arrow to go and fight
[9:00] but you have to know the kind of battle
[9:03] we are
[9:05] going and the kind of weapon we have to
[9:08] take
[9:09] along you know years back years back
[9:14] centuries
[9:16] back they go to
[9:19] war with arrows and catas and
[9:24] knives but if
[9:27] today if they say there war or if
[9:30] there's a word today and you go grab a
[9:34] knife everybody will be thinking there's
[9:37] something wrong with
[9:38] you because there has been a
[9:43] transformation people are using guns
[9:46] atomic
[9:47] bombs things has changed so in you you
[9:51] know the battle you are entering
[9:53] into and the kind of weapons that you
[9:56] have to
[9:57] use and as Christian
[10:00] as soldiers of the
[10:03] Cross we didn't know the battle we are
[10:07] fighting and the kind of weapon we need
[10:10] to
[10:11] use and scripture has let us
[10:15] understand that we don't wrestle against
[10:18] flesh and
[10:19] blood so it's not a feast battle it's
[10:24] not a fist battle by something different
[10:28] but as men dwelling within our mortal
[10:34] bodies we we can't fight this battle
[10:41] ourselves but one thing for certain we
[10:45] know there is a
[10:47] man his name is
[10:50] Jesus as long as he lead us to the
[10:54] battle we are going to be all right and
[10:58] for go to the
[11:01] battle you know if a
[11:03] soldier want to go to a battle he's
[11:07] going to prepare we some kind of
[11:09] clothes the same way happens he's going
[11:12] to wear his
[11:14] boot where where his safety
[11:20] V and protect all the body he he can
[11:26] protect but we Christians
[11:29] and not un battled about the
[11:33] flesh but in the
[11:36] spirit and we have to know how we have
[11:39] to we ought
[11:41] to we have to know how we ought to
[11:44] prepare ourself for this
[11:50] battle and you know there's one thing I
[11:52] love so
[11:53] much about the
[11:56] military or about the forces when it com
[11:59] to you know the other time learn to
[12:02] listen to chain of
[12:04] command chain of
[12:13] commands and the other time waiting for
[12:16] the commander to give an
[12:19] instruction and these people being
[12:23] men trust in a
[12:26] [Music]
[12:27] man who does know when he dies who
[12:31] doesn't know when he
[12:33] dies that he's a man who is killed in
[12:36] war that if he is a man who is skilled
[12:39] in war
[12:46] skilled and that man can lead them for
[12:48] the battle and bring them back home
[12:52] [Music]
[12:54] safely how much more
[12:57] we who are master and Lord Jesus
[13:01] Christ has conquered
[13:05] [Music]
[13:06] everything but he say the key the key of
[13:09] hell is in his hands the key of
[13:14] hell and he has dominion over Heaven and
[13:19] Earth and has conquered the
[13:23] grave and has overcome
[13:26] death if you are blessed blessed if you
[13:30] are
[13:32] blessed yeah and privileged to have such
[13:36] a
[13:38] man to be the
[13:41] leader We are
[13:43] following then why not
[13:46] we give all and obey the command of our
[13:50] master and Lord Jesus
[13:53] Christ you know there is no better
[13:55] Commander than our Lord Jesus Christ
[14:01] he's the one who will never leave
[14:04] you you know he told the apostles he
[14:08] told the
[14:09] apostles I'm
[14:11] going but I will not leave you
[14:15] comfortless that is the god that we
[14:17] worship maybe I I don't know what you
[14:20] are looking
[14:22] for but there's nothing more desperate
[14:25] that I want you to look for than the
[14:27] presence of God around you
[14:33] because if you have the presence of
[14:35] God you don't need to worry about
[14:39] anything because God is going to take of
[14:42] all your
[14:44] worries you know often
[14:47] times the
[14:49] devil make us forget who we
[14:53] are and how powerful our God
[14:57] is so we to wonder as an
[15:03] orphan and struggle to do things with
[15:06] our own
[15:09] strength but when you come to the
[15:15] recognition that your
[15:17] master your father is the creator of
[15:21] Heaven and Earth and there is nothing
[15:24] too difficult for
[15:27] him then you be wor
[15:29] wored the last time the last time I
[15:34] spoke about
[15:36] Amnesia a state where you don't
[15:39] recognize who you
[15:42] are and said yeah there are other wor
[15:44] disease on this Earth there's other
[15:47] worest disease on this
[15:50] Earth but Amnesia is the worst of it
[15:55] all because you don't recognize Who You
[15:58] Are
[16:00] nor even the people around
[16:03] you but my
[16:05] brother but my brother my sister there
[16:09] is nothing worse much more than
[16:11] spiritual
[16:14] Amnesia when you don't recognize who you
[16:17] are and when you don't recognize who you
[16:22] worship and you don't Rec who you serve
[16:26] and you don't Rec who you serve you
[16:28] don't recognize who you
[16:31] serve serve or who you
[16:35] worship the devil is going to toss you
[16:40] around you know it doesn't matter that
[16:42] Jesus is around it doesn't matter Jesus
[16:45] is
[16:46] around the devil is still going to toss
[16:49] you around because because you don't
[16:52] know that Jesus is around because you
[16:55] don't know that Jesus is around because
[16:58] you don't know
[17:00] you know when they were traveling by the
[17:02] ship or the
[17:04] canoe when they were traveling with
[17:06] Jesus sleeping in the
[17:12] boat Jesus traveling with the
[17:15] disciples in the
[17:17] boat and Jesus was
[17:20] sleeping of Jesus was there but there
[17:23] was a trouble there was a
[17:26] storm and thought the thought
[17:29] they thought they were
[17:33] thinking that they thought that I been a
[17:37] fisherman for years I've been a
[17:39] fisherman for years no I know how the
[17:42] sea
[17:47] works we we we could handle it with our
[17:50] experience we could handle it with our
[17:54] experence you know that is all the time
[17:57] the nature of a man
[18:00] we get to the point that that Jesus is
[18:05] in our boat Jesus is in our house but
[18:11] for this type of thing that we are
[18:14] doing we say Jesus you just rest I can
[18:19] do it
[18:20] myself but if you a Christian and Jesus
[18:23] is your commander you shouldn't come to
[18:26] a point
[18:30] it shouldn't come to a point that you
[18:32] are going to make a
[18:34] decision without considering
[18:37] God I love David I love
[18:41] David I love
[18:44] David yeah and if somebody ask me which
[18:48] Bible character do you like in the
[18:51] [Music]
[18:52] Bible I like almost everybody I like
[18:56] almost everybody I like almost
[19:00] is but there's something unique about
[19:02] David unto
[19:04] me he said whatever before David would
[19:08] take every step concerning his life
[19:11] before he would take every step
[19:13] concerning his
[19:17] life he first consult the
[19:20] Lord my question is do we consult the
[19:25] Lord whenever we want to do something
[19:30] you know David had a mighty Army David
[19:33] has had a mighty
[19:35] Army a big
[19:39] army and he went to
[19:52] war and when he went to war he
[19:57] conquered and when he came back home he
[20:00] said all his
[20:03] family and he the people we want with
[20:05] war their wife his with their wives and
[20:07] children has been taken to
[20:09] captivity have been taken
[20:14] captive you being a powerful man like
[20:17] David man like
[20:21] David you would have just gone after
[20:23] your
[20:24] enemies you have just gone after your
[20:27] enemies
[20:29] because you were a man of experience in
[20:33] war he even killed gol he even K
[20:38] gol so what stopped David for to pursue
[20:41] his
[20:41] enemies but so what stopped David from
[20:44] pursuing his enemies or going after his
[20:47] enemies what stop him from going after
[20:50] his
[20:53] enemies but the Bible said David went
[20:57] before the Lord
[21:00] and as oh Lord should I
[21:04] go after
[21:07] them he never did with his
[21:11] experiences he didn't do with his War
[21:16] skills he consult the
[21:19] Lord all the time my brother my
[21:22] sister let give preference to
[21:26] God because the back that we we are
[21:29] going to fight because the battle that
[21:32] we
[21:33] have is not flesh and
[21:36] blood we wrestle not against flesh and
[21:41] blood but against
[21:44] principalities you know sometime people
[21:48] think you know it's going to be some
[21:50] Demon come to stand before you it's
[21:53] going to be some sort of Person coming
[21:55] to stand before you
[22:00] but sometime the demon could just be an
[22:05] idea that is being sponsored throughout
[22:08] the whole world that everybody is
[22:11] believing throughout the
[22:14] world and that is where you need to
[22:16] stand your grounds that is where you
[22:18] need to stand your grounds as a
[22:20] Christian stand your ground
[22:29] [Music]
[22:31] and know says something he said the
[22:34] devil have a
[22:37] right to a
[22:39] punch and the
[22:41] devil has a right to a
[22:45] punch so we make
[22:47] sure you cover your weak
[22:52] [Music]
[22:54] spot because the Lord
[22:56] visit the Lord visit
[22:59] visit and the devil
[23:01] visit but be careful when the devil
[23:05] visit you will not be the day that you
[23:07] are weak and
[23:11] feeble look at
[23:13] job job didn't do anything
[23:16] wrong but look at the Calamity that be
[23:23] J but yet
[23:26] still in his troubled moment
[23:31] he said I know my redeemer leave
[23:33] it he was still regarding God you know
[23:38] we come to a point in our
[23:41] life and as
[23:44] Christians and we turn to believe in
[23:48] people then the God will claim we
[23:51] worship than the God we claim we worship
[23:59] and we try to do think we can do with
[24:03] friends but all the
[24:06] time David consults the
[24:10] Lord have ask
[24:12] yourself how many times have I make a
[24:15] decision without con Consulting
[24:18] God and where has it lead me
[24:24] to no the battle is
[24:27] on my brother my sister bam said we are
[24:32] not in a picnic we are not in a
[24:36] picnic you know in
[24:38] picnic everybody does whatever he
[24:42] likes but we are Christians We Are
[24:45] Soldiers of the
[24:48] Cross and we have a way we need to do
[24:51] our
[24:53] things and you see often time people
[24:57] think when I become a
[24:59] Christian I go to church I pay my
[25:04] tith that is all I don't have to face
[25:07] anything in life
[25:09] again I don't have to face any challenge
[25:11] in life
[25:14] again I don't have to get an
[25:17] accident I don't have to get an
[25:20] accident
[25:22] yeah I don't I don't have to get
[25:25] sick because I'm a Christian oh no it
[25:28] doesn't work like that yeah you are a
[25:32] Christian you go to church all right but
[25:35] you are not let off the challenges of
[25:38] this
[25:39] world you need to
[25:41] fight you know H when God delivered the
[25:45] people out of
[25:49] Egypt God said I have given you the
[25:52] land but when they send the 12 Spies
[25:55] onto the land
[25:59] he said 10 of them came
[26:01] back and said we look like grasshoppers
[26:03] before
[26:05] them and two of them
[26:08] said it doesn't M it doesn't matter
[26:10] whether we look like grass
[26:12] Whoppers or not God said the land is for
[26:18] us God promised them the land God
[26:21] promised them the land but he said you
[26:24] need to fight and God has promised us
[26:27] another kingdom
[26:29] and if you want to enter into this
[26:31] Kingdom then we need to fight we need to
[26:34] fight the desires of the
[26:38] flesh we need fight gossiping we need
[26:42] fight
[26:43] gossiping we need to fight gossiping
[26:45] lying stealing adultery we
[26:51] need we need to fight all these
[26:55] thing so if we are in the batt land is
[26:58] for
[26:59] us but we need to fight for the
[27:02] land and that is where we have come to
[27:06] and if you
[27:07] realize that the Christian journey is a
[27:12] battle and that you don't have the
[27:14] strength to fight this
[27:16] battle but you need God in your life to
[27:19] be able to
[27:21] overcome you will never live a lifestyle
[27:24] or make a decision without first
[27:26] considering God
[27:30] because you know the Bible said one
[27:32] thing that I love so much the Bible said
[27:35] one maybe you should open to Isaiah
[27:37] chapter 54:1
[27:41] 17 Isaiah
[27:45] 54:17 we look at what the Bible said
[27:47] over
[27:51] there Isaiah 54:1
[27:56] 17 said no weapon that is form against
[27:59] thee shall
[28:17] prosper no weapon that is formed against
[28:20] thee shall
[28:23] prosper that
[28:25] means a weapon shall form against you
[28:28] you a weapon shall form against
[28:32] you that means a weapon shall form
[28:34] against you a
[28:41] weapon
[28:47] yeah
[28:49] so a
[28:56] Christian stuff are going to happen to
[28:59] you and weapons will be formed against
[29:03] you weapons will be formed against
[29:10] you weapons going to form against
[29:14] you but we have the
[29:17] promise the weapons will form surely the
[29:20] weapons will form the weapons will
[29:24] form but they won't prosper
[29:28] so don't think I became a
[29:32] Christian and that is
[29:34] all if you think you were a
[29:37] Christian and he still don't take the
[29:40] authority of Jesus Christ
[29:44] serious then when the Devils form a
[29:47] weapon against
[29:49] you he's going to get you because said
[29:53] that our
[29:55] adversary the devil is going
[29:59] around as a roaring
[30:02] lion seeking who he may
[30:05] divor and the devil is not after who are
[30:08] for
[30:10] him it's not after who are for him or
[30:13] those who are for
[30:16] him but
[30:18] after me and you who have decided to
[30:23] follow Jesus Christ and that the reason
[30:26] why we need to still close to
[30:29] Jesus so that we don't give the
[30:32] devil any
[30:35] opportunity to
[30:37] strike you know each and every
[30:40] day he just putting in strategies and
[30:45] plans just the devil is just putting
[30:47] plans and
[30:48] strategies
[30:51] plans and what you can
[30:54] do to get me and you out of the way of
[31:00] God and I know whatever is happening he
[31:02] said the devil is the ruler of this
[31:07] world and know whatever the order of the
[31:10] word is moving is moving according to
[31:12] his
[31:16] Direction but let us not forget the
[31:20] signs and the times we are
[31:21] [Music]
[31:24] in so that we will not forget ourself
[31:28] who we
[31:30] are and and what God has made us
[31:36] of so that we all the
[31:39] time hold onto the name of the
[31:43] Lord now people somebody is
[31:47] thinking right now you have told us that
[31:49] we've wrestle not against flesh and
[31:52] blood we have told us that we wrestle
[31:54] not against flesh and blood
[31:58] so now how can we
[32:01] overcome how can we win the battle
[32:04] against the
[32:07] devil all that you need to yes follow
[32:09] Jesus Christ
[32:11] command I want us to open our Bible back
[32:14] to Isaiah Ephesians chapter 6
[32:21] verse2 to look at how we are going to
[32:23] prepare oursel for the
[32:26] battle and weapons we need to
[32:31] use so in a
[32:33] battle you don't all that time
[32:37] defend in a battle you don't all the
[32:40] time
[32:42] defend you don't all the time defend you
[32:45] defend and offend or you defend and you
[32:47] attack
[32:50] [Music]
[32:51] sometimes so
[32:54] sometimes the way you are living your
[32:56] life could be an attack to the kingdom
[32:59] of go the
[33:02] devil to the kingdom of the
[33:08] devil you need to know the kind of
[33:11] weapon you need to put on for this
[33:18] batt now I want I want to start from the
[33:20] verse 12
[33:23] again for we wrestle not against flesh
[33:26] and blood
[33:29] but against
[33:31] principalities against
[33:33] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[33:36] this world against wickedness in high
[33:44] places verse 13 wherefore take unto you
[33:47] the whole armor of
[33:51] God take the whole Armon of
[33:56] God you know don't say
[33:58] this word that I'm
[33:59] going this word that I'm
[34:02] going no I'm not going to take my safety
[34:07] vest you know I want to go like
[34:10] that what if an
[34:14] enemy shoot an arrow or a gun towards
[34:16] your
[34:19] chest we need to take the whole Ammon of
[34:24] God it is the whole Ammon of God it is
[34:28] not
[34:29] some it is
[34:31] everything it's everything and he say if
[34:34] a man will surrend
[34:39] everything to
[34:40] God and let God take control over his
[34:44] life then you will see how powerful that
[34:47] man will
[34:50] be that ye may be able to withand in the
[34:54] evil day
[34:58] yeah verse
[35:01] 13 and having done
[35:05] all to
[35:07] stand that means in the battle there is
[35:11] an evil day there is an EV an evil day
[35:18] evil you might be attacking the
[35:23] devil but one day one of the bullet
[35:25] might be directed towards you
[35:31] that is
[35:33] what and cover your whole
[35:37] body not
[35:39] part the whole
[35:41] body stand therefore verse
[35:45] 14 stand
[35:47] therefore having your Lo G about with
[35:55] truth so as
[35:59] Christian I would say your
[36:01] belt should be
[36:03] truth so in your work
[36:07] places in in your
[36:10] schools in your homes in your
[36:13] neighborhood you should be known as the
[36:16] person who speak the
[36:18] truth it should be your
[36:20] nature that you can't help it than to
[36:24] speak the truth
[36:29] and everybody knows if it was said by
[36:32] this
[36:33] person then that is the truth because
[36:36] that person says nothing apart from the
[36:40] truth so that is one of the that we
[36:44] need is to get our LS with a belt of
[36:51] Truth and having the breast spit of
[36:56] righteousness what you are going to
[36:58] cover your
[36:59] chest what you are going to cover your
[37:02] chest should be should be
[37:06] righteousness so in your
[37:08] neighborhood at your work
[37:10] places at your work places work places
[37:17] work your
[37:20] schools your home you should live a life
[37:27] that
[37:29] people said
[37:30] indeed indeed this is a follower of
[37:34] Jesus
[37:36] Christ you know you
[37:40] don't by the life the life you know when
[37:44] Apostles go to the
[37:47] Antioch it wasn't their
[37:50] teaching that God them the name
[37:53] Christians and said and the people live
[37:56] alive
[37:58] and the people of Antioch look onto
[38:01] them and said these people live like
[38:05] R and because of that we call them
[38:08] Christians so if we claim we are also
[38:12] Christians then we need to live like I
[38:15] and that is one of the our weapon to
[38:18] cover our breastplates and your
[38:21] feet sh with the preparation of the
[38:24] gospel of peace that is verse 15
[38:30] [Music]
[38:31] we are covering you know there are some
[38:34] people immediately
[38:36] Vis visit with you trouble when iMed
[38:41] [Music]
[38:43] visit they come with
[38:45] trouble some people when they visit you
[38:48] they just come with trouble yeah
[39:01] but some people you don't want them to
[39:04] leave your presence you want to stay
[39:08] around
[39:09] them because you feel that inner peace
[39:13] within
[39:16] you you want to be that
[39:18] person that when people are in the
[39:24] street they want to speak to they want
[39:27] to talk to because they know if they are
[39:30] able to speak to you because they know
[39:33] if they are able to speak to
[39:35] you you are going to speak for peace to
[39:39] rain in their
[39:42] heart I'm still verse
[39:45] 16 he said above
[39:48] all take the shade of
[39:50] Faith so after wearing your
[39:54] weapon after wearing your weapon
[39:59] you know you see sometimes SW or maybe
[40:01] the police they will go with some shield
[40:03] to
[40:04] protect
[40:07] shield and he said we need to a
[40:10] shield we need a
[40:12] shield because some
[40:14] arrows are going to be F towards
[40:17] you and those
[40:19] arrows cannot be with stand by the
[40:23] vest so you need a shield and that
[40:26] Shield
[40:27] that sh is Faith you have to you get to
[40:32] the
[40:33] point where the doctor will tell you

[40:42] die and you're going to tell the
[40:45] doctor is true everything is failing

[47:10] pardon until the person the pardon has
[47:12] been written it

[48:49] pardon but if they come to kill you if
[48:53] they come to kill you and you don't show
[48:55] the pardon
[48:57] to the person come to execute
[49:00] you the pardon is
[49:02] nothing the pardon is
[49:05] nothing so if you can claim to be a
[49:08] Christian Christ died for you all right
[49:11] but if you don't accept
[49:13] it it's
[49:15] nothing but to accept the
[49:18] pardon is to live a life like
[49:21] Christ it is the only way can accept the
[49:24] pardon that Jesus has provided
[49:30] and so on and the sword of the spirit
[49:33] there vers 17 which is the word of
[49:36] [Music]
[49:38] God so so we
[49:41] Christians we also have a sword we also
[49:45] have an Ammon to attack the devil but
[49:49] this Ammon is the word of
[49:52] God
[49:53] sometimes somebody could be distressed
[49:57] and in that distressful moment maybe he
[50:00] just possessed with the devil you just
[50:02] need to speak the word of God onto the
[50:04] person just some small word that God is
[50:07] with you just some small word of
[50:10] encouragement to break that person from
[50:14] the bond is in break yeah from the
[50:18] bondage that person is
[50:20] in the bondage
[50:33] [Music]
[50:39] yeah
[50:41] so our attacking weapon is the word of
[50:44] God the only weapon that we have to
[50:47] attack the enemy is the word of
[50:52] God and just to do speak the word of God
[50:55] to your friend
[50:57] the last time I told you about this
[50:59] popular
[51:03] man I'm forgetting his name again but I
[51:08] [Music]
[51:09] remember Billy
[51:11] Graham he was a friend that invited him
[51:14] to a
[51:16] church so your friends out there the
[51:20] friends out
[51:23] there just need an invitation sometime
[51:26] to share
[51:29] sometime they just need you to whisper
[51:31] Jesus in their
[51:35] ears maybe that is all you will
[51:38] do but you don't know the impact you
[51:41] will do for
[51:46] Generations Verse
