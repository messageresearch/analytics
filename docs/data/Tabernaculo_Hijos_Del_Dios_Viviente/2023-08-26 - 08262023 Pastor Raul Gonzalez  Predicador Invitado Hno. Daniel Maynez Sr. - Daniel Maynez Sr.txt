Gloria senor is minus foreign [Music] we're waiting for a transformation but that transformation is coming we're not the same that we used to be since we accept the world we're being transformed but certainly like our brother said yesterday there's coming a transformation and a twinkling but that lady said I'm not what it used to be located I'm going from transformation to transformation now how many of you sometimes we feel like we are not worthy today is this morning I'm going to be the translator but I don't feel like the rest of the brothers and the preacher says oh I'm going to preach but I don't feel as clean like the rest so Brothers how many are ready to get into the world that plays on the heart of my brothers some of us we know from long time so here we are yes findings among us because we're going to be from millions and millions and millions foreign let's go into prayer foreign senior questions [Applause] we have a lot to talk about so let's go to Revelation chapter four a Toronto which the messenger entitled The Throne of judgment and mercy Los Angeles and we're going to be talking a little bit about the first four seals I hope to be brief salary let's read verse one is opening Heaven and the first ones which I heard was that they were over trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be hereafter you may be seated and I hope that we're able to break it down last night we heard a glorious message but you know you go to the restaurant and depends on the cook because the same means they don't taste the same um Evangelistic service to the world because God is a god of variety and process and helps servant foreign opens up and he hears a place that tells him and John the Apostle says behold after these things [Music] it's a church should I sit down or should I leave because he doesn't know anybody no foreign and he told him he didn't call my enemy he said friend how do you got in um your wedding garment s so there's some documented people over there he said and he realized that he got him somewhere but he didn't got him through the door because he was at the end so being invited it is an honor to see the things that he speaks up in types and bring them to the light of the revelation we simply are speaking again in reality Revelation chapter 4 chapter written in symbols well not only Revelation 4. it's written in symbols to rebuild it people [Music] I am the door because there's windows there's a back door where did I get in English [Applause] but am I right that I entered Jesus Christ baptism of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ of Dominion the respecter of respect yes because it says because in verse 3 says something that is hard to hit because it is a stone and stone is out of Revelation even though and that's where we base apart foreign thank you Amigos he cannot catch this and why do I get it I'm just saying any employee why why did you get the word I get it by the Revelation that God gave us and [Music] foreign foreign of this is the sons of Jacobs foreign on the airport and you find out that is Jasper the kennel supplies what does that speaks about yeah of Revelation 117. you're sorry I so how many understood the first stage and Benjamin is Jasper an apocalypses and Revelation chapter four there is a whole Revelation there is began to talk about colors with just representations foreign I just look at that and I say it is [Applause] and the next one that is very noticeable between red and yellow they produce Orange and then next to it is not when you go outside and you see the rainbow red orange yellow green blue persons every one of these colors belong to a person or a character like a distraction s have you ever it's an emerald it doesn't bring anything so the whole rainbow all together look like an emerald speaks about Judah who represents the tribe of Judah no this is because it is Jesus Christ the great lion a person god with me we're speaking about it but the kingdom has its Defenders but the Throne of God who does he defended against I'm gonna show you and we know that is speaking on Earth Guardians Defenders and vigilance Watchmen yes and in this time it's they're not accept you know that the book of Hebrews says shelter foreign we have so many people on the other side who are you about the throne or Guardians yes I was speaking with a person uh talking about the eet's ETC it is devil is not created if it's a living being president he's of God what happens if we haven't seen them we see a person with two eyes we would say horse three eyes and look it has four uh Four Hands foreign and point s in search of judgment and I do believe it and I wait and I'm waiting for them the prophet says government is my brother better has read it we have read our homes and our brother went to my house and I haven't written down I don't have him here because I'm not a computer I'm not a computer I pull up my my quotes and I tell them here says [Music] he was wondering what are those things and we will leave but the messenger says when one of this comes down foreign foreign stops put the other one and you can walk around with two spoons and dances so then foreign [Music] and he feels like he's burning up you know that they want to destroy Humanity how easy would they get rid of us yes in Hawaii and that happened lately people have to run to the Sea because they felt like because something fell but someone said so it says shut up it is ourselves now who are the first one that are going to die well the Elder [Laughter] I'm among them so we spoke about we talked about something of the beans that are called in the throne and we also know that the Tony has his attack and we're going to read about the song that he says foundations verse six this is Crystal was like a flying eagle so we have the throne we're going to see the throne put it like this but in reality also the throne is also the Tabernacle that Moses built on the desert is unless foreign a banner with this the flag of Mexico and the rest of the nation they have their own but we see on the scripture that that scripture says in Genesis that the first Guardian was a lion the first Guardian was a lion the lion represents the target Judah numerous numbers 2 verse three will go to the east foreign the animal sacrifice and that animal of sacrifice uh that speaks about the reformers will go to the South yes and the foreign ego performance now things began to shape up revelation 4. page 265 they're not angels he calls them living beings and these are The Gardens of the Tabernacle the servants and then the world says Exodus 2 17. is evil son of all the tribes and today are the pastors so here I have I asked the brother he has some lasers he said no I don't know since it is we're going to take all of this foreign defends us about foreign come and see what is the first living being alone a lion yes [Music] foreign [Applause] so a black horse yes when you open up the force you I heard the boys who said come and see and behold a pearl horse they're the one that come against the Thrones the lion face him the red horse the the cast needs him [Music] he's in his face by the face which is death it is because we are the Eagles the southern messenger what can we say about this you are my message you are taking my message are you able to catch all the points of the relation in their times of the Lion we're speaking of the master I want to build yes I noticed a little bit of a dispute about this line represents we still have a little bit of time they told me that we could take three hours we're closing the lion represent the apostles here's the apostle representative Maestro man represents a teacher representation evangelist I can representative and who did the eagle represent Prophet is because the Eagles will tear him down evangelist s to pray for him I'm a teacher if Iglesia and your shirt you also leave it no I'm free when you see an apostle foreign [Applause] pastor [Applause] the Apostle and if we erase this about possible and so forth the Maestro t-shirts and then during your page you might have to do quite a bit if you have enough space you may put them together but this speaks about tambien also there was of the four Gospels is impossible Maestro who would the teacher be Lucas Lucas his profession was to be a doctor he was the evangelist right places or the Full Gospel Juan era um was a prophet he wrote the revelation store so who was the pastor I asked the Lord told him uh my certainly he was the pastor for the rest they come they called the Holy Ghost of the Apostles so in the center we have of a principle Peter because uh Paul is the first messenger if we erase all of this bear bear with me to the right evangelist Ro yeah this is the lion the Apostle uh evangelist the calf teacher hey Eagle Prophet today fight for Ministry is fighting against the prophet tell us plainly that something big is coming that's a great Beast coming at the end is the Council of churches it started like harmless started like uh yeah the one foreign then after that because the uh the White Horse that's the uh the first Beast then we go to the red ah red horse is the third one is uh uh the concrete one and the fourth one is where it's finished is the one that brings death is the Locust is and the locus now do you get the whole picture offer it is one of these means eats a little bit of the bright tree is who are you that is defending the train where are you because you have to be defending it because the current player comes the panel one and the country worm and the locusts according to the message already yes which is the Council of churches that's tremendous now do we see the message Instagram man I have a lot of work but not as much as he tremendous [Laughter] let me tell you that the point of the matter is to be on the same spirit I didn't tell Daniel many things and you know that you can catch even more and it's not going to understand the rest Ministry okay and he would say I know them [Music] from beginning if I come late I'm very lost because you have to catch it from the beginning and you can say well it's not foreign [Applause] it breaks them down you may be able to send out Divine father we thank you
