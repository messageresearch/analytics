would think by now I would remember to turn on a microphone [Applause] but we're thankful to God to be here we thank our brother Raul for invitation and we certainly enjoyed the fellowship the last two Services sometimes the word that comes is Evangelistic sometimes the word comes up in an Apostolic way sometimes the word is the teachers and pastors and we appreciate them all foreign because amongst the world there was no one greater Jesus said he was a prophet but I say unto you more than a prophet for he was an Elijah Ministry okay who would foreign [Applause] so we're thankful to be here tonight a little church there in Phoenix Arizona Phoenix Arizona we've uh from uh Tucson Arizona where we lived for many years and yet I wasn't born in Tucson we were born in Los Angeles California Los Angeles California so I hope you don't hold that against me but we're grateful to God to be here and God gathers his little bride from all over the world and she belongs to and she's in many different places but God knows if you'll turn with me in your Bibles tonight we'd like to take and read from Matthew 5 and verse 48. a very familiar scripture to us it's the last verse chapter five given the title of the Beatitudes but it's it's and that's a good and that's a good uh title for it yes but it doesn't really describe what Jesus was teaching indeed he was teaching it in a parable for that was the problem and without Parables he would not speak anything [Music] it's really is for perfect foreign in Matthew and Mateo The Book of Matthew chapter 13. you can turn with me if you'd like and verse 34. and it's it's the parable of the sower as you all know and Jesus is finishing up it was really a teaching the seat of the serpents there was a teaching on that this human race has two fathers that there is a and one of the children of the kingdom of God and the other is the children of the devil Jesus Jesus was uncovering great Mysteries that had happened since the Book of Genesis all these things fake Jesus into the multitude and Parables and without a Parables and the question would be why is verse 34 tells us because every Bible question you might have okay and many times the answer is in the next verse [Music] that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I'll open my mouth in Parables a lot of things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world del Mundo then Jesus entrances and went into the house like he has here this evening he's come to this house with his disciples can the disciples saying declare unto us the parable of the Terrors of the field is the son of man and he began revealing to them for a period of 40 days I was just about to ascend upon him and he gave a Great Commission to his church then it must be according to the word be a parable for sure hidden in his words and Jesus in verse 18 and spake unto them Jesus power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth teaching them to observe all things so what's the what was the true baptism of the words of Jesus the Great Commission how many years believe Jesus baptizing name of the father autism as Pentecostal people when I was in that denomination we believed we didn't talk about it talked about Acts 2 38. and for us the two scriptures hit like two kids and we would talk with with those who were a trinitarian beliefs and you can go ahead and believe fishermen if you want um but we stand with Jesus they said they'd say what do you think about that so we struggled with that so until the Revelation came everything that Jesus said was in a parable yes it's true just like uh just like uh many of the evangelists preached in that era um but the time would come he would enter into the ministry you say no no he was always alive Jesus Jesus he came to his room we know Israel as the lion of the tribe of Judah was he at that time the Lamb of God a when he took his 12 disciples and gave him a commission he said go only to the Lost tribe of Israel to the Jewish people don't talk to no one else This is Gospel only to the Jews because he came first to Israel Israel he came first in the ministry of the Lion of the tribe of Jews it was when Israel rejected and what they rejected was the opening of the books [Applause] the island as a child I read it many times but when I heard the prophets speak of it more deeply fundamentally I realized as many times as I had read it I've never understood and he talks about Joseph takes his two sons according to the custom and the ritual of the Jewish people with this great patriarch speak the blessing to Joseph's two sons you remember the stories opportunity [Applause] Libro [Music] it's what Israel lost so the first time it was this day in the days of the ministry of Jesus the line of the tribe of Jesus Remember Revelations five and five John was weeping and crying an elder Rose because you know whose book it was foreign [Music] ready it was already prophesied she would Rejects Ocho and it says be therefore perfect it is your father which is in heaven is perfect or is it a parable is there more hidden in the statement our first reaction as human beings is to say no this is not we can't be perfect I'm 68 years old I've been trying for 68 years so we can't be perfect they're in Phoenix I am Phoenix he's the pastor of uh of a church called CCV and it's a mega church they have several congregations this one has five his name was bertres Burg you're a pastor and uh so uh I also I'm a believer of God's word I tell them how about if we talk about us what we're working okay Daniel you can't not we cannot be made perfect I said but Jesus said therefore perfectly to to shoot how perfect even as your father which is I said so where are the so we can take could it be in the previous 47 verses and we need to sit down as God for Revelation brother Daniel I'm not educated I'm not talking about education she said if I cannot Touch the Hem of His garments that was not written anywhere in the old testamentally I don't know where in the scriptures that they had or the prophets was that written down she said if I can just do this wonderful things of the previous 47 verses perfecto Hebrews 11. verse 39. and these all have been obtained a good report through faith to receive not the promise of perfection the Perfection there was a reason because God have been provided so a better thing for us Hebrews 6 and verse 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ for let us go on important not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God so affection in the New Testament Perfection the dictionary it gives us meanings one is to make something Perfecto to bring something to an end to add what is lacking in order to render a full thing or to bring to an end as a goal finale or to bring to a close or fulfillment something by an event like the Prophecies of the scriptures a Bible definition yeah is it embargo it has nothing to do with perfection God promises that's not what Perfection means to God in the exposition of the seven churches as you know it was a book that brother Branham uh wrote with uh with the help of Brothers can they and they took them all what he had spoken he cannot reached on the seven Church ages and here he says how highly guard regards this outworking of our patients as seen in James 1 4. let patients have a perfect work he may be perfect an entire lacking nothing this is God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience then he says this is the process it is uh take us Sons and Daughters of God the process to arrive to adoption is called the three steps of Grace speaking to uh a man not too long ago it had gone to a Baptist Seminary about this class he said three steps of Grace where did you get that from thistle I said you're a seminary Baptist preacher and don't know this is justification by faith sanctification by the spiritual the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is it is the components of the born-again experience there is this Holy Ghost and Fire baptism it's the beginning of this born-again experience it says John was speaking I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance Minister Brothers [Applause] in Acts 2 38. a scripture we know very well this scripture is the Fulfillment it is words of Jesus in a Parables see them come together like this one was the prophecies repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for many years so if you fell into these categories baptized and you've got the baptism of fire it doesn't have to worry about can I share a testimony foreign testimonial I have a good friend Amigo he's in this message today loving the Lord Jesus ten years my Elder um you grew up in the Apostolic Church as a young man teenager he gave his life to Christopher he was baptized linguas a perfect denominational Pentecostal experience one that everyone in the Apostolic Church wanted to have and say they had he got it they from the time he came out of the water wanted to groom him prepare him to be the next president was exactly the dogma of that church five years later he's got long hair a long beard is packing a gun on his side and he's running with the motorcycle gangs of Southern California we said what happened to this Holy Ghost and Fire baptism in This Boy's Life sentence foreign powerful words and teachings foreign it was a promise God placing that mustard seed in your heart [Music] day by day Diya and you would increase your Revelations and these three things these three steps brings us to a restored friendship is [Music] that's what this is we sang a song Yesterday the day before Jesus on the main line do you believe it do you believe you've had that kind of relationship that's the kind of relationships in Hebrews 7. Paul tells the Hebrews in verse 18. for there is barely a distance of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof foreign also mentions them tells us how they're being disallowed by three Divine steps of Grace happiness to the fullness you can kill him self once again are hearing the same things that Adam heard because God wants to take you to the same place he wanted to take Adam you live in his presence foreign this is what Adam heard oh that day in Eden are getting it in maybe the day before they fell because Adam heard these words I want you to be there for Perfecto even as your father which is in heaven that's a new testament verse the word of God regardless of when it's spoken Eternal Word was it not in the mind of God before the foundation Matthew 5 48. and himself perfect even as your father justification by faith brings peace sanctification by the spirit [Applause] you might have had a genuine experience of justification by faith that Jesus died washed away all your passes Salvador and we see the man doing that and in our legalistic minds and yet he made very sincerely it had a true justification by faith experience second step of Grace Holy Spirit sanctifies the vessels you see the vessel it's been picked up out of the mighty clay and the mud justify my faith but it hasn't been washed yet that's the next step is when that man finally one day a month later years later he crumbles up that pack of cigarettes and throws it away I need to be a better example of this Jesus there was a family abuna Familia a man and his wife they had children my age and they come from a very harsh family even yeah all heroin addicts the grandfathers when he cooked a little bit of food I'm gonna go testify his family a lady's name was mercy and she's walking two blocks down the street in Grace of Jesus the other neighbors came out and tells her you know mom's name don't you go there Mercy gave her life to Jesus Christ foreign hello he was outside in the yard and in La Casa I said alone I just gave my life to Jesus Christ what hinders you I can see it you're struggling inside I know you want to give your life to it he said sit down boy he says you're right no and he was smoking yes but I can't stop smoking and I'm not going to get baptized Mercy had given her life to the Lord Jesus she was in her 30s have passed they were both about in their 70s already and one day he gets up in the morning almost 30 years had passed and he tells him I got up this morning can I grab that pack of cigarettes and I just hated them and I threw them in the garden and I've given my life to Jesus Christ [Applause] to uh their advice was divorce this man divorce yesterday the token is not in your home until you leave him and get away from him she told me one time I said don't leave him alone Matthew chapter 8 verse Jesus had finished on the steps that it would take in your daily life and how to get to be perfect the Father which is in heaven is Perfecto here in chapter 8 he had brought his teaching to her clothes but not completely because later men like Peter Hombres of the New Testament would continue by the same Holy Spirit [Music] where Jesus continued his teachings I say continue because when he began where he began it was when he told Nicodemus you must be born again unless you're born again you'll never get a revelation but that's that's not a difficult Revelation that's not a difficult Revelation is seven Thunders though is the voice of God revealing the open book but that's not where God wants because Seven Virtues [Music] Jesus is teaching he's going to give us the 47 steps of how to get to verse 48. because he said being either foreign of the Lamb's Book of Life and he opened his mouth blessed are the porn spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven what's Jesus don't forget this is perfection what a teacher what an incredible teacher and yet he was speaking in a parable that's revealed to us now on this day okay so we're being taught by him we're being taught by him that was made perfect foreign if you want to become a millionaire it says You must talk to successful millionaires if you want to become a super athlete you will talk to men who are super athletes and have had great success you'd want to talk to men who were considered great Carpenters you want to be perfect [Music] he was talking about an experience that he had yes and being made perfect unto all them [Applause] the last um patience waiting on God but it's really God who's been waiting on us this is a process of character development so now begins blessed are the porn spirit [Music] theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven in spirit and Espiritu is two words but it also can be used as one word and when you put the two words in spirit in English you put them together then the world changes and it means to encourage um animal that means to Quicken somebody yes it has a positive meaning [Music] we have five senses if you don't surrender this senses to use them more oftenaves to discourage rather than encourage we have five senses of the spirit Memorial and if you don't surrender these senses in the church when through these senses to this you hit this bottom place it's actually the beginning he is the beginning Matthew 5 3.3 you are or you were this one porn Spirit but blessed are the porn Spirit descends to your life Abraham's wife found herself porn spirit and it was ruined in her life he was ruining her relationship with her husband [Applause] in Genesis 18 it begins the story of this little lady Sarah who is a shadow of a type of us today spiritual and verse 1 says on the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day the word it has different meanings as many words if it's used as a noun [Applause] it has different meanings what are those meanings of the word I don't want to read this the way that that definition is the Lord appeared unto him Abraham yes all three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent doors a prophet told us did you did you notice there was three men but he only acknowledged one and he called them my Lord the Greek word for Lord is the great sufficient one Abraham had never seen him before but when he heard that voice remember the prophet is from the Devils the angel of the Lord came down he saw it coming from outside this is the one yesterday [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] was fighting with everyone at home and Abraham Henson hastened unto the 10th verse 6 unto Sarah and said make ready it's a fine meal need it and make cakes upon the heart foreign for the vision that was in his mind God doesn't get a hold of get ahead of his plan neither is he ever one minute late always on time and then they said unto him for it was the purpose they came foreign and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him is sign of the Messiah and he said I will certainly return unto you according to the time and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were well old and stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women and because Sarah knew this is that having a son now was impossible human The Impossible armed with this human understanding then it caused Sarah to laugh within yourself after I'm wax old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also this place is yes a woman foreign that's what the devil wants you to believe Sarah never doubted God she just said yes doesn't Abraham understand for me is that was a woman maybe tonight it's a man in that way can't you see thanks for the word thanks for the encouragement of what you don't understand it's too late for me Sarah a Believer but simply not believing a promise she couldn't remember in all her 90 years when an old woman in her imaginations she said no this is this would not be right human affections it's too late for me and all her five senses we must believe God's word she had hit poverty level she was poor in spirit as a human being could get she was mad at Abraham yes Genesis 18 and verse 13. and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have a surety bear childhood God was not Discerning her condition as his Discerning yours tonight and there's nothing she can do about it Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God I'm powerful yes [Music] knowing the heart of Sarah Sarah look at me is anything too hard foreign he says at the time appointed I will return to thee he's talking directly to Sarah he's not talking with Abraham no more he's talking right to Sarah [Music] thank you the Lord with the promise as it is foreign [Music] but it would not be the last time Genesis 21. remember how the word is written upon lines and the Lord visited Sarah this is I was born [Music] says for Sarah conceived verse 2. Abraham a son in his own day at the same time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac yeah and Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto you yeah Migo it was different now sometimes my wife will do something sister Karen um she says you're laughing at me images foreign God have made me to laugh so that all that hear me laugh this time because they'll see me with a promise in my arms [Music] [Music] [Applause] because we hold the promise in our arms laugh differently and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck I'm sure Abraham at that time said I was telling you all the time reminding the people of the promises of God they must be born again thank you the night's just getting away from us I try not to be a long-winded preacher I have failed many times but I've never preached more than four hours they love to worship they left they hear the word but we won't do it tonight Hebrews for the word of God is quick and Powerful sharper than any two-edged swords reaction [Music] thank you because he was wanting to know how to talk to you increase your faith foreign but we dedicate Our Lives Hallelujah in closing serrando with that said also realizing our Holy Spirit Discerning Sarah's life discerned where she was in her Christian walk this is her faith then tonight taking these principles would you believe me if I tell you that I can tell you where you are tonight in the Christian world foreign [Music] he's got thicker skin than most but maybe we'll just speak to every heart and let you know that your efforts to be here tonight consciously or unconsciously the Holy Spirit and where you are in your Christian walk you know you still understand because every one of you are here I include myself it is based on the scriptures Pueblo the holy blessed are the porn Spirit or theirs is justification by faith and sanctification by the spirit foreign that's where we stand tonight foreign instead of support oh tonight
