[5:18] the opening of the word I want to thank
[5:20] you Lord that the seals have been
[5:21] revealed I want to thank you Lord that
[5:23] the one of the tremendous mysteries have
[5:25] been revealed under the seventh seal the
[5:27] opening word that's predestination
[5:29] election a calling Lord had been in this
[5:32] a great evil and deceitful day you saved
[5:35] that great revelation as a great
[5:37] security to your bride you knew we had
[5:39] need it in this day predestination we're
[5:42] so thankful for that dear God
[5:44] Lord even I think about even John and
[5:46] revelations chapter 5 is chapter for
[5:48] seeing that great hosts around the
[5:50] throne of God the twenty-four elders and
[5:52] John knew that the that twelve the
[5:55] Twelve Apostles was a part of it and the
[5:58] twelve patriarchs and he knew that he
[6:00] was one of those a twelve apostles so he
[6:02] actually got a preview he saw himself
[6:04] their Lord what a security that was and
[6:07] as a prophet City he must have seen his
[6:08] name in that book when he was calling
[6:10] for one that was worthy to take that
[6:12] book Lord if we can just go on and on
[6:14] with those things and what about our own
[6:15] life how you've done so many things for
[6:18] us what you've done for us we see the
[6:20] Lord just as steps the righteous order
[6:22] of Lord what you've done in our lives we

[25:57] jeez
[26:00] [Music]
[26:04] penny here's me with
[26:12] till the storm
[26:15] [Music]
[26:21] thank you Lord Jesus till the storm
[26:25] passes
[26:38] man god bless you tonight happy to see
[26:44] [Applause]
[26:49] we miss y'all when we're gone amen
[26:55] I'm glad God let us walk this journey
[26:58] together let's turn to Isaiah 53 if you
[27:04] would tonight we want to look at a
[27:11] continuation of the humility and the
[27:15] glory of canosa's and before we read the
[27:21] scripture I'd like to emphasize to you
[27:23] that this is part of God that Satan does
[27:30] not understand we accredit him with so
[27:36] much more really than what he does
[27:39] understand and this is part of God's
[27:42] being that is more than a being like
[27:46] himself can understand so then we look
[27:50] at it in a broader perspective that if
[27:53] Satan can't understand it
[27:54] then neither can his children understand
[27:58] when the children of God try to be like
[28:02] this and the attributes of their father
[28:05] it will make no sense somehow God hid it
[28:11] from Satan exactly when he come to the
[28:14] earth that he never was pretty convinced
[28:17] that it was him and he wasn't convinced
[28:19] it what damn he just kind of you know he
[28:23] just wasn't really sure he has a way of
[28:26] doing that don't
[28:28] now think how blessed you are God's open
[28:32] your understanding to help you to
[28:33] understand more and more about it and I
[28:35] thank God for myself the Sun look at
[28:40] this chapter 53 of Isaiah verse 1 who
[28:44] has believed our report and to whom is
[28:46] the arm of the Lord revealed well he
[28:51] should grow up before him as a tender
[28:52] plant and as a root out of a dry ground
[28:56] he hath no form nor comeliness and when
[29:01] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[29:05] we should desire him now remember God
[29:10] created this body of Jesus so it wasn't
[29:15] that he had a Jewish nose and Gentile
[29:18] eyes and Syrian ears and you know
[29:21] Mesopotamian fingers there was nothing
[29:25] from any human being at all so God could
[29:28] have created him to be the most handsome
[29:30] of men that ever lived on the earth but
[29:35] instead he chose him to be a very plain
[29:38] simple looking sort of person no beauty
[29:44] about him that we should desire him he
[29:48] is despised and rejected of men a man of
[29:52] sorrows and acquainted with grief we hid
[29:57] as it were our faces from him in other
[30:01] words we wouldn't even look at him to
[30:04] even give him the credit that we would
[30:06] look his direction he was despised and
[30:09] we esteemed him not but now listen how
[30:15] that this parallels with the divine and
[30:18] the human surely he hath borne our
[30:23] griefs and carried our sorrows now
[30:28] Isaiah and this prophecy he takes a
[30:31] great mixture of adjectives nouns but
[30:36] the uses so many verbs which are words
[30:41] of action we're living in a now and
[30:46] Christian age and an adjective age when
[30:50] Christians want to be told out great
[30:51] they are they want to be preached they
[30:54] want the preachers to applaud them and
[30:56] just use adjectives after adjective
[30:58] after adjectives in the good way of
[31:01] course but when you go to preaching verb
[31:04] words a lot of folks go to having
[31:08] problems because they really don't want
[31:11] to do anything when it comes to the Lord
[31:14] on me but notice how that Isaiah
[31:17] whenever he mentions this now in verse 3
[31:20] he's describing him by agita cease
[31:22] despise which is an adjective of course
[31:24] and it was rejected a man of sorrows an
[31:27] adjective acquainted with grief which is
[31:29] a cross over of an action part we hid as
[31:32] it were our faces from him he was
[31:34] despised again an attitude of describing
[31:38] him and we esteemed him not but now we
[31:40] come to the action part surely he has
[31:43] borne borne our griefs and not a nail
[31:50] not an adjective a word of action yet we
[31:57] did esteem him stricken smitten of God
[32:02] and afflicted many have you have a need
[32:08] to not request before the Lord all of us
[32:11] I'm sure Lord Jesus we bow our heads and
[32:17] we come to you as humbly as we know how
[32:23] first of all we want to say thank you
[32:26] thank you for your kindness to us thank
[32:30] you for your mercy thank you for your
[32:33] grace but thank you Lord for becoming
[32:38] one of us it was God above his people
[32:44] then it was God in his people and God
[32:49] become his people
[32:52] we thank you Lord that she would come to
[32:55] this earth Condon send to such a place
[32:58] that to this day still in the realm of
[33:04] the supernatural it must be overwhelming
[33:08] to both divine angels and those who
[33:12] follow to us it is still so profound as
[33:18] Paul said great is the mystery of
[33:20] godliness Lord I'm sure that we don't
[33:24] see it the way maybe others do I'm sure
[33:28] that if we look back in time and maybe a
[33:31] year or two from now or three what a
[33:32] memorial was think oh my how much more
[33:35] we seen but I do know this I'm grateful
[33:39] for what I see tonight and I want to see
[33:42] more tomorrow and the next day and so on
[33:44] and so on
[33:45] lord I pray that should help us tonight
[33:47] may the greatness of our God be so
[33:52] expressed before us tonight that we can
[33:56] see the contrast of your prayer thy
[34:00] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[34:05] as it is in heaven and contrasts that
[34:09] father to the cosmos because we know
[34:13] there's two great kings that are at war
[34:16] two kingdoms and only two that are
[34:20] against each other every person in this
[34:23] building tonight every person that will
[34:26] hear this service where every one of us
[34:28] are identified in one or the other of
[34:31] those kingdoms may it be the kingdom of
[34:35] our Lord Jesus Christ for we ask it in
[34:38] your precious name and the Saint said
[34:41] God bless you may be seated
[34:46] I just think in my heart from his birth
[34:58] until 11 or so his life was certainly
[35:07] curious and different things about him
[35:12] that was different than other boys yet
[35:16] very similar no doubt his mother and
[35:21] Joseph being there with him
[35:24] and they would hear him say things see
[35:27] induce things not that there was
[35:30] miracles walking on water
[35:34] nothing like that yet and then when they
[35:38] lost him and they went to the temple and
[35:42] found him there as he was speaking words
[35:46] that a normal 12 year old boy should not
[35:50] know now the Bar Mitzvah for those of
[35:55] you that understand what that is it's
[35:58] whenever a young man actually becomes a
[36:02] son of the Torah and that is that he for
[36:07] his first time in life he's able to
[36:12] stand up and take the law and the priest
[36:15] tends in the law and they unroll it and
[36:18] he's able to stand up and take the law
[36:21] and read it and then to actually comment
[36:25] on the scriptures that he is read
[36:27] according to their tradition and their
[36:30] custom he is now a man which is about 12
[36:33] to 13 years old called their Bar Mitzvah
[36:37] so actually someone we were there in
[36:39] Israel so they take him around and now
[36:42] of course they would take him to the
[36:43] Western Wall and they will take him up
[36:46] on their shoulders and they dance and
[36:48] have great time of Jubilee but the way
[36:52] that
[36:53] look at it this is when the young man
[36:55] actually enters into a time that he is
[36:59] what they call a son of the Torah no
[37:03] doubt the Lord Jesus had studied it no
[37:06] doubt he had read it but where would he
[37:09] have got such wisdom to where the
[37:12] doctors of the law would have set their
[37:15] and heard him and they were just
[37:17] marveling at the words that were being
[37:20] said and then when she and Joseph Kahn
[37:23] said son your father and I have been
[37:26] concerned about you we've been looking
[37:28] for you
[37:29] it said wish you're not I must be about
[37:31] my father's business as a matter of fact
[37:34] Joseph ain't no father now there must
[37:39] have been things that was different and
[37:42] you can imagine that Satan has always
[37:44] kept his eye on the fourth dimension
[37:48] he's always wanted to see how that God
[37:53] would use those prophets and they would
[37:56] break into that realm and see future
[37:59] things that he himself would marvel at
[38:03] in summits that they would call men's
[38:06] names hundreds of years before they were
[38:10] ever born they would tell about events
[38:14] and describe them in such a way that to
[38:18] this very day it is phenomenal how they
[38:23] could describe how a city would be taken
[38:26] over how many days they'd lay siege how
[38:29] many would die so on and so on and Satan
[38:32] must have marveled at the insight that
[38:35] these natural men somehow praying and
[38:39] being alone with God and he would watch
[38:41] them and all of the sudden they become
[38:43] very strange in this atmosphere and
[38:47] maybe they might jerk a little or quiver
[38:50] or their eyes become star gazed and they
[38:53] would just look there and become
[38:55] mesmerized as if they
[38:57] were paralyzed by the presence of God
[38:59] and all of a sudden things would start
[39:03] coming out of their mouths and as you
[39:05] know many of these prophets would have a
[39:07] ascribe with it because when they were
[39:09] in these visions they could not write
[39:11] them so some of the prophets had scribes
[39:14] and as they were in the vision the
[39:16] scribe was sitting there as a Penman so
[39:19] he would write down what the prophet
[39:21] would say the profit you know wouldn't
[39:24] have any recollection many of them once
[39:26] they come out of the vision and Satan
[39:29] must have Marvel as he heard these
[39:31] things and God let the parallel of the
[39:35] prophecies of the coming Redeemer be so
[39:39] mixed on the divine glory side with the
[39:44] human humble lowly side that without a
[39:48] real genuine understanding you'd see why
[39:51] it would be so easy to misunderstand it
[39:55] so you take the prophecy the first one
[39:57] that God Himself gave in genesis 3:15
[40:00] when God said that he would raise up a
[40:03] seed and it would bruise the serpent
[40:05] well if you would take those of the
[40:07] serpent bruzer and you would take those
[40:10] of being the son of David and you would
[40:13] take certain ones of zechariah 6 12 or
[40:16] jeremiah 35 or you know it's zechariah
[40:19] 12 and you take some of these others and
[40:22] you would put them together you can see
[40:24] why that you would be looking for a
[40:26] mighty general to come not a baby so
[40:32] then you're trying to look and reconcile
[40:34] Isaiah 7:14 with a serpent brucer or
[40:38] Isaiah 9:6 was the son of David a great
[40:42] mighty king and you can see why that
[40:45] describes the Pharisees the doctors of
[40:47] the law they were looking for a mighty
[40:49] general to come down on top of the
[40:51] temple and announce his coming to care
[40:54] for and he would tell that all the
[40:55] people know the son of David has arrived
[40:59] so you know what they done they took
[41:01] quotes from the prophet
[41:04] and put together the coming of the
[41:07] Messiah and totally missed it because
[41:12] they hand-picked the quotes of the
[41:14] prophets and they put the advent of the
[41:17] coming of the Lord
[41:19] mixed in with her own generality of
[41:21] reasoning and totally missed it because
[41:24] they were not spiritual but yet yeah the
[41:27] woman - well yeah ignorant fisherman and
[41:30] so on and they did not depend just upon
[41:32] their fare sake for training and
[41:34] teaching but they would say words like
[41:37] thou art the Son of God
[41:39] the king of Israel we know Messias
[41:42] cometh him when he comes he will do
[41:44] these things either speak to thee em he
[41:47] and she dropped her water pot and went
[41:50] run into the city and say is not this
[41:53] the very Messiah now why was it that
[41:57] those prophetic prophecies did not
[42:00] confuse the elect as they did the
[42:03] learning because the learning was
[42:06] endowed with the satanic nature of
[42:10] religiosity which come with the element
[42:14] of human pride well I said a mouthful
[42:19] right then I'm telling you friends that
[42:23] Satan wanted to get his way in order to
[42:28] interject this greatest of all sings for
[42:32] sin inside of the human race that every
[42:37] individual that would be born add to the
[42:40] mixing of the seedlings every one of
[42:42] them would be tainted was an element of
[42:46] satanic arrogance and pride then they
[42:50] would tend to rely upon their own
[42:52] abilities or their own width or their
[42:56] abilities to be able to mechanize
[42:58] because man is good at operating and in
[43:01] feeding we can see that in the book of
[43:03] Genesis and Madison
[43:05] that being able to come up with ways to
[43:07] make himself a way back to God Adam
[43:10] showed us that in the Garden of Eden by
[43:12] the fig leaves
[43:13] so Satan knew with the fall of man the
[43:16] holy image of God left the men so leave
[43:18] the man alone with his intellect and
[43:21] with the word and the man will do his
[43:24] best to figure out a way back to God
[43:27] without the shedding of the blood and by
[43:30] using all adjectives and minimizing
[43:34] verbs right so we can say well I'm their
[43:38] son I'm mad and I'm mad and I'm mad I'm
[43:41] not mad and I'm that and it's all
[43:42] profession of course but he doesn't
[43:44] really have to do anything in exchange
[43:46] well praise God y'all required on me but
[43:50] notice then when God came himself now
[43:53] remember this one that we called Jesus
[43:56] he was actually the father before he was
[44:02] the sir
[44:03] [Applause]
[44:08] now I become Jesus was that which was
[44:14] created by the father and the father
[44:18] embodies in the son which is the human
[44:22] element but in order to bring us of
[44:25] course back to reconcile us notice in
[44:28] isaiah 53:10 yet it pleased the Lord to
[44:32] bruise him he has put him to grief when
[44:39] thou shalt make his soul an offering for
[44:42] sin he shall see his seed he shall
[44:46] prolong his days and the pleasure of the
[44:50] Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall
[44:54] see of the travail of his soul now
[44:57] notice it is a mixture of the divine and
[45:01] the human part of this the Spirit is
[45:05] doing but it must be in total
[45:08] correlation what's the submissive will
[45:11] of the Lamb it is the merging of the
[45:14] dove and the Lamb there are certain
[45:17] parts only the Dove can do only the Dove
[45:21] could bruise the Lamb you see the Lamb
[45:25] did not bruise himself but land did not
[45:28] lay upon himself the iniquity of us all
[45:31] but it was the Dove that laid upon the
[45:35] Lamb the iniquity of the soul it pleased
[45:38] him the dev to bruise
[45:41] the lamb hallelujah
[45:45] notice in verse 11 he shall see of the
[45:48] travail of his soul and shall be
[45:52] satisfied he the dove shall see how the
[45:55] travail of the soul of the Lamb and he
[45:58] the Dove shall be satisfied by his
[46:01] knowledge shall my righteous servant by
[46:05] his knowledge shall my the Dove
[46:07] righteous servant the lamb justify many
[46:11] for he the lamb shall bear their
[46:15] iniquities therefore well ah the death
[46:19] divided him the lamb a portion with the
[46:23] Great and he the lamb shall divide the
[46:27] spoil with the strong the redeemed by
[46:31] the lamb well glory to God because he
[46:34] the lamb poured out his lambs soul unto
[46:39] death and he the lamb was numbered with
[46:41] the transgressors and he the lamb bear
[46:44] the sin of not everybody but many I'm
[46:48] glad I'm one of them and made
[46:51] intercession for the transgressors
[46:55] now in order for God to be able to
[46:58] reflect the epitome of his own heart
[47:01] toward reconciliation of the lost it
[47:05] must be the merging together of the
[47:07] divine and the human the divine cannot
[47:11] suffer death of course we know that and
[47:13] the human cannot be able to put sin upon
[47:16] itself if the human protects off sin to
[47:21] take off sin then it defiles the
[47:23] sacrifice so it must be that the holy
[47:26] will take the sins of the unrighteous
[47:30] and lay it over that part of himself
[47:32] which can bear sin and the Dove cannot
[47:36] bear sin only the lamb can do that
[47:40] and it must be a total complete
[47:42] submission of the Lambs soul the Lambs
[47:46] nature the Lambs desire in order to make
[47:49] it work exactly with the justice of God
[47:52] God cannot listen our God cannot make
[47:56] the lamb do something that is contrary
[47:59] to his own will he cannot make the lamb
[48:03] go he cannot make the lamb suffer he
[48:06] cannot make the lamb go through all of
[48:08] this extreme punishment that he's going
[48:11] to go through the lamb must be
[48:13] absolutely 100% willing there must not
[48:18] even be a point zero zero zero zero zero
[48:21] zero one left in his will that is not
[48:26] completely submissive to the nature of
[48:29] the duh that's exactly where God wants
[48:31] us now I'm talking about that converted
[48:35] part of you this right here will always
[48:36] kick against the will of God there's
[48:39] parts about this whole body a virus that
[48:41] can obey the word and there's parts
[48:43] about it he just don't like it just be
[48:44] honest well that's right because the
[48:46] body is not yet retained but we're
[48:48] leaving it that way but the lamb must
[48:51] absolutely totally be completely
[48:54] surrendered to the will of God now this
[48:57] is one reason why of course it he lived
[48:59] this separate holy life and he chose and
[49:02] come to live thirty years on the earth
[49:04] without the fullness of the Godhead in
[49:07] him he must also experience that life of
[49:10] a person we reach through this way that
[49:12] would be justified and sanctified he
[49:15] must be able to relate not only to Holy
[49:18] Ghost feel true word born believers but
[49:21] his high priest he must be able to
[49:23] relate to the people who were just
[49:25] keeping the law as he wants the Torah he
[49:28] must be able to relate to those that
[49:30] love God with all of their hearts he
[49:32] must be also high priest to those that
[49:34] are just sanctified aren't you glad
[49:37] aren't you glad he didn't just become
[49:39] high priests to those that had the Holy
[49:40] Ghost then that made the majority of our
[49:42] Christian life many of us wouldn't even
[49:44] have been had a high priest he said well
[49:47] I'm only high priests to those that are
[49:48] got the Holy Ghost all the rest if he
[49:50] just did whatever you got to do to get
[49:51] that but he said no I'm gonna come to
[49:53] the else and I'm gonna live as a man
[49:55] without the Holy Ghost I'm gonna live as
[49:58] a man that believes and obeys the word
[50:00] and that does every single act Lee right
[50:03] all praise God but then when he receives
[50:06] the fullness that day but he never takes
[50:09] that fullness in order to overcome Satan
[50:12] because then it would be unfair for us
[50:14] don't Eve must ear into this pack to
[50:18] where the Ludd the Lamb and the dove
[50:20] will merge together in one union and the
[50:24] lamb will totally be submissive by his
[50:27] own choice notices now Philippians
[50:31] chapter 2 verse 8 I'm being found in
[50:34] fashion as a man he humbled himself now
[50:39] notice God the spirit the Dove can lay
[50:41] on him the sins of the world he can
[50:45] allow him to be chastised our
[50:47] transgressions and so on but he cannot
[50:50] make him be humble Oh hallelujah he
[50:55] cannot do that the lamb must do it him
[50:59] sell the land must you don't you see why
[51:02] he went this way
[51:03] it was to make a way for us now the
[51:06] Spirit of God friend it's not gonna make
[51:08] us serve him God's not gonna grab people
[51:12] up with an apple and then just smack the
[51:13] fire item just kick them and beat them
[51:15] and stomp on grab you by the hair the
[51:17] head I'm pulling you through the gates I
[51:19] don't care if you want to go to heaven
[51:20] wrong I'll tell her to god I'm pulling
[51:22] you there well if he does you that will
[51:24] have to
[51:25] everybody else out here the same way but
[51:28] God wants of people that are willing to
[51:30] follow in the very path of the Lamb of
[51:33] God which was of self humiliation now we
[51:39] all know what it's like to be humbled
[51:41] and we know what it's like to be able to
[51:43] sharing that but yet here is a divine
[51:46] side of being rewarded and of course the
[51:49] kenosis of the lamb was in order to come
[51:52] to the glory of God and with the glory
[51:55] of his bride since the wife is the glory
[51:58] of the man then it must be that the lamb
[52:01] must humble himself now supernaturally
[52:03] the father cannot do that because if he
[52:06] does he like to do it for every other
[52:08] son and daughter of God this is why the
[52:11] Bible tells us we must humble ourselves
[52:15] right now the pastor he can't do it for
[52:18] you I've came to it for you notice been
[52:20] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[52:23] himself and became obedient unto death
[52:28] even the death of the cross now we
[52:32] looked at this word the last time I
[52:33] dealt with it but it's look at it again
[52:35] bring low - lowered depress one soul
[52:38] bring down once pride to have a modest
[52:42] opinion of one cell now to be honest
[52:47] with you I've met folks and you have to
[52:48] that if they didn't have their self to
[52:50] talk about I'm not sure what they would
[52:53] talk about because the more you're
[52:57] around them the more they talk about
[52:59] themselves and then they wonder what one
[53:02] brother Donnie didn't say much or now
[53:03] talk to him could it be you didn't give
[53:05] me no room and yours already talking
[53:08] about yourself enough I didn't really
[53:10] want to join in
[53:12] I get sick of people here and people
[53:15] talk about themselves look friend you
[53:19] might be a millionaire sitting here
[53:21] tonight all that means is you're a
[53:23] millionaire dirt bag and in value
[53:27] you're not worth any more than I am I've
[53:29] buried a lot of folks over about a
[53:31] hundred and some since I've been here
[53:33] I never mile I've seen no casket lined
[53:36] up at hundred dollar bills if I was when
[53:38] they put him in that time everybody come
[53:40] through they wouldn't have them
[53:41] I never seen nobody buried what's her
[53:45] car what's her horse
[53:47] what's her house what's her cattle with
[53:50] her sheep but their stops and their
[53:52] bonds come on have you know and you
[53:55] never will I don't figure so what it
[53:57] really comes right down to it the only
[53:59] thing that we take with us out of this
[54:01] world
[54:02] is our character and the reputation and
[54:05] our legacy it's what we leave behind
[54:07] right and that's where it's more than
[54:10] all the money of course in the world
[54:11] anyway but yet people have an idea that
[54:15] humility is something to wear people you
[54:18] know they did RESP or now look hey you
[54:21] know what I was raised poor I know
[54:23] exactly many of you been raised poor and
[54:25] you know exactly what it's like to be
[54:27] poor and to be raised poor but people
[54:30] think humility is being poor that's not
[54:33] always true some people that are poor
[54:35] they got so much pride if somebody
[54:38] offered to help them their pride but let
[54:39] anybody else open they can have more
[54:42] pride than a rich man can that's right
[54:45] a great man is a man who's actually
[54:48] greater than you but he can convince you
[54:51] you're greater than him it's not a
[54:53] person who's all the time going around
[54:55] telling about how
[54:56] great they are they can sing better than
[54:58] everybody else play the guitar ever
[55:00] better than else and they can preach
[55:01] more and they have more visions and more
[55:03] dreams and so on that is a bag of wind
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:09] well praise the Lord
[55:11] y'all didn't say men much but it's the
[55:13] truth in hell now notice them the Lord
[55:16] Jesus was not made to do this by the
[55:20] Deaf but the land chose this on his own
[55:24] I remember the lamb is the human part
[55:26] look at the meaning of this word here to
[55:29] behave in an unassuming manner devoid of
[55:33] all holiness or metaphorically it means
[55:37] to bring into a humble condition reduce
[55:40] to meet her circumstances to assign a
[55:44] lower rank coma or place to a base to be
[55:49] ranked below others who are honored or
[55:53] rewarded now the nature of this
[55:57] humiliation it was genuine it was not
[56:01] that the Lord Jesus acted like he was
[56:04] humble and he did not impersonate a
[56:07] humble man but he was a humble man now
[56:11] in this don't don't get in your mind
[56:14] that just because he did not have a
[56:16] house and he did not have horses and he
[56:18] did not have chariots because we know in
[56:21] that day there would have been many many
[56:22] people that did not have a place to live
[56:25] there were homeless saying like there
[56:26] are now but it was not so much just
[56:29] because a lack of property but it was
[56:32] more a mindset than it was of how much
[56:35] you own you see a person actually can
[56:38] have a lot of possessions in this world
[56:40] but if they have them and use them the
[56:42] right way they can be more humble than a
[56:45] person that says flat broke all the time
[56:47] because it's not just what you own it's
[56:51] your attitude toward what you own
[56:54] well praise the Lord he owned everything
[56:57] did he not he owned everything but yet
[57:00] when you look at it he was so humbled
[57:03] that he stepped aside and laid aside of
[57:05] course the crown the diadem the roads
[57:07] and all of that but he laid aside all
[57:10] knowing he laid aside
[57:11] omnipotence he laid aside all of that
[57:13] and assumed a lower rank as Paul said so
[57:18] he come down and it was totally
[57:20] voluntary now this is what the Lord
[57:22] wants us to become as far as us humbling
[57:26] ourselves
[57:27] the God does not have to do it you know
[57:29] on sometimes we hate it
[57:30] but sometimes were hard-headed and
[57:33] stubborn goddess just what the fired of
[57:34] us he just has to take a stick and just
[57:37] beats us and we just you know ideas and
[57:39] that Daddy because he wants just because
[57:41] we're so stubborn and worse a
[57:43] hard-headed now I'm gonna go ahead and
[57:44] say Amen for me and now this amens for
[57:47] all the rest
[57:54] because y'all just sent over that
[57:56] funny-looking smile on your face
[58:00] what's this in Matthew 18:3 and said
[58:03] verily I say unto you except ye be
[58:05] converted and become as little children
[58:07] you shall not enter into the kingdom of
[58:11] heaven friends one of the truest signs
[58:15] that you'll ever know that you're under
[58:17] the rebellion of Satan away from the
[58:19] leadership is of the Holy Ghost it's
[58:21] when you cannot receive correction from
[58:23] the Word of God when the Deacons try to
[58:29] correct you or the ministers try to
[58:31] correct you and you receive nothing from
[58:34] nobody just remember you're under a
[58:36] satanic evil spirit not the Holy Ghost
[58:40] the Holy Ghost can be corrected if it
[58:44] lives in you it will lead you to
[58:46] correction well I say I'm what to preach
[58:49] and a man too
[58:52] now watch Jesus now I know this is not
[58:56] nice we don't like it we that's not deep
[58:58] and we message people don't not even
[59:00] sure these scriptures are needed by I'm
[59:03] kind of different than a lot of message
[59:04] folks Jesus said this I believe it's
[59:06] needed well the I'll say in the US said
[59:09] cheap to come be converted and become as
[59:11] little children you shall not enter into
[59:13] the kingdom of heaven whosoever
[59:14] therefore shall notice again not the
[59:17] Dove of humbling the Lamb but now the
[59:21] same that the same sequence of events is
[59:24] going to happen in the prophetic
[59:26] timeframe when the Holy Ghost is going
[59:29] to burst the church whenever the Dove
[59:31] will come and live inside more Lambs and
[59:34] he will equip them and give them the
[59:37] ability to humble themselves now Fred
[59:41] this is from the divine side we can't do
[59:44] this on her own
[59:45] whosoever therefore shall humble himself
[59:47] as this little child oh wow
[59:54] the same is greatest in the kingdom of
[1:00:01] heaven
[1:00:03] now don't raise your hands but is that
[1:00:07] your idea of who the greatest is in the
[1:00:10] kingdom of heaven praise God sweet Jesus
[1:00:18] brother Homer where you at buddy I heard
[1:00:21] you had some good meetings rushed back
[1:00:22] up here notice the words that Jesus uses
[1:00:26] is the exact same word that Paul uses
[1:00:29] Tapani oh the same Greek word the exact
[1:00:31] same meaning so it means then that we
[1:00:35] will have the ability within us to
[1:00:39] humble ourselves again in Matthew 23:12
[1:00:43] whosoever shall exalt himself shall be
[1:00:47] abased he that shall humble himself
[1:00:49] shall be exalted James 4:6 but he giveth
[1:00:55] more grapes wherefore he says God
[1:00:59] resisteth the proud but give us grace
[1:01:04] unto the humble I don't know about you
[1:01:07] but I sure need grace you see this is
[1:01:11] why the pride the proud man does not
[1:01:15] depend upon grace why his goodness
[1:01:18] generates from his own being from his
[1:01:21] own works for whatever he is look
[1:01:23] friends there's folks that are
[1:01:25] absolutely eat up with pride and I've
[1:01:28] never really done much in life but their
[1:01:31] pride is not from what they own it's not
[1:01:34] actually from what they've accomplished
[1:01:36] it's from them self itself generated
[1:01:41] don't you see what that ties it ties to
[1:01:45] the universal sin that was committed in
[1:01:48] the
[1:01:49] universe before sim was ever brought to
[1:01:51] the earth in reality they have nothing
[1:01:55] to be proud of their failure in business
[1:01:58] or a failure in this and a failure in
[1:02:01] that and yet they are so proud and where
[1:02:04] does it come from within themselves oh
[1:02:08] praise God so this is what James said
[1:02:13] that God does to the proud God resists
[1:02:16] the proud which is oppose oneself to
[1:02:19] range and battle against so and we lift
[1:02:24] up our self and pride and arrogance and
[1:02:26] this that neither God declares a war
[1:02:28] against you and you know is gonna win
[1:02:32] that war it hang will be you oh man
[1:02:35] notice this so God resisteth the proud I
[1:02:39] know I reach a lot of meanings of this
[1:02:41] words but to me that make them so real
[1:02:43] when we read him in the language they
[1:02:45] were written him and the proud means
[1:02:47] this showing oneself above others some
[1:02:54] do that but what they drive some do it
[1:02:56] but what they dress but other people do
[1:03:00] it by their spiritual means I'm more
[1:03:03] spiritual than other people at Happy
[1:03:05] Valley I feel this and I feel that I
[1:03:10] feel that and I feel there well God's
[1:03:13] got bringing for so much stuff and I had
[1:03:16] to just be honestly that the poor old
[1:03:18] devil has said and he done a lot of it a
[1:03:21] lot of its people but want to be
[1:03:23] bye-bye'd
[1:03:24] I felt led I felt led to do this and
[1:03:28] anything that's leading you contoured
[1:03:30] this word is a devil
[1:03:33] it ain't a holiness so people that look
[1:03:37] at themselves and they have such
[1:03:40] spiritual pride they are so much deeper
[1:03:44] oh they're so much more spiritual
[1:03:47] they've gone so far in God and in their
[1:03:52] pride they look down as Satan did on the
[1:03:57] Angels I might need to give me one then
[1:04:09] my bulletproof vest if I keep on
[1:04:11] preaching this way now this is what the
[1:04:17] Bible says that God does to those type
[1:04:19] of people so for those of you that are
[1:04:22] more wealthy and you're able to buy your
[1:04:24] clothes from the mall and say you come
[1:04:27] into the church and you happen to see a
[1:04:28] sister sitting there and a dress from
[1:04:30] Ross and in your pride know where she
[1:04:38] got that you need to get that devil off
[1:04:41] of you
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:47] that is from the holy ghost praise gone
[1:04:56] I'll test some of the worst ones in the
[1:04:58] message that's got this and that's
[1:04:59] preachers eat up with it Thank You Jesus
[1:05:07] brothers we model to just cut right here
[1:05:09] on out not even let's just go out on the
[1:05:11] internet I'm gonna be kilt again look at
[1:05:14] the meaning of it prior proud showing
[1:05:17] oneself above others now it's not that
[1:05:20] they are but they show their self that
[1:05:23] they are over topping conspicuous above
[1:05:33] others preeminent was an overwhelming
[1:05:38] estimate of one's means or merits
[1:05:45] despising others or even treating them
[1:05:48] with contempt holy why would God be so
[1:05:55] against this because it comes from Satan
[1:05:59] even when the Lord Jesus rebuked the
[1:06:04] scribes Pharisees Sadducees he never
[1:06:07] done in the spirit of pride it was not
[1:06:10] proud it was not arrogance it was in the
[1:06:13] spirit of love and trying to correct
[1:06:15] their error right
[1:06:17] but you've been around people and you
[1:06:19] know as well as I do that all my when
[1:06:22] you get around them and they just kind
[1:06:24] of look at you and you know they're
[1:06:25] looking at you and they feel so sorry
[1:06:27] for you maybe not so much your clothes
[1:06:29] maybe your dress you know what kind of
[1:06:31] parent to them and you look alright
[1:06:33] you're sort of kind of decent and
[1:06:34] they'll talk to you a little bit about
[1:06:36] the word and they still throwing things
[1:06:39] out there to kind of see where you are
[1:06:40] and then they see you're not where they
[1:06:42] think you're my brother they are you
[1:06:44] sure don't know very much do you
[1:06:46] you sure don't know but generally when I
[1:06:48] get around somebody like that and they
[1:06:51] go
[1:06:51] that attitude gentlemen what I do I go
[1:06:54] even lower than what they think I am
[1:06:58] because they need to feel bigger than me
[1:07:05] they need to feel bigger than me so I'm
[1:07:09] gonna help them I'm gonna add more done
[1:07:12] than what they think I am
[1:07:13] oh that's right why I'm helping them
[1:07:18] fall now I don't even understand this
[1:07:21] but there comes times to when people
[1:07:23] will not correct be corrected by the
[1:07:25] word I've actually had to give them
[1:07:28] enough rope knowing in time how would
[1:07:32] watch them hang themself because they
[1:07:35] will not match up to God's Word so a
[1:07:38] Holy Spirit goes before what a fool Lord
[1:07:45] keep me from such well hallelujah church
[1:07:50] but notice James says he give us more
[1:07:53] grace wherefore said God resisteth the
[1:07:55] proud but he give us grace unto the
[1:07:59] humble mama notice again James 4:10
[1:08:03] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[1:08:06] Lord and he shall lift you up now this
[1:08:10] word is a different Greek word as far as
[1:08:13] lift and it is to exalt to lift up on
[1:08:16] high metaphorically to raise to the very
[1:08:19] summit of opulence Wow now this is
[1:08:25] what's amazing this is what the natural
[1:08:28] man wants but he wants to do it by his
[1:08:31] own merits or works or whatever more but
[1:08:34] God said no if you want divine opulence
[1:08:38] the only way you can do it is not step
[1:08:40] on everybody else but you
[1:08:42] to humble yourself and let me do it but
[1:08:46] if you try to do it yourself I'm telling
[1:08:49] you I'll declare a war against you so
[1:08:53] the Lord Jesus must come in this same
[1:08:57] human format and feel he must have felt
[1:09:01] by the Terry afford you know the port of
[1:09:04] pride he must have felt the pull of
[1:09:07] arrogance and so on no doubt he could
[1:09:10] have answered every question that
[1:09:12] everybody ever asked him he could have
[1:09:14] answered them and totally overwhelmed
[1:09:17] and proved how great he was which is
[1:09:19] what most of us would have done cause a
[1:09:25] lot of times we speak not only what we
[1:09:27] know but a whole lot more than what we
[1:09:28] know just in case they need that too and
[1:09:35] let's just be honest we make fools out
[1:09:37] of ourselves Abraham Lincoln said it's
[1:09:42] better to be silent and be thought a
[1:09:43] fool than to open your mouth and solve
[1:09:45] all doubts wisemen OMA but really for
[1:09:54] the Father Jesus the Lord Jesus to
[1:09:58] relate to those of us left with this
[1:10:01] tempered nature that Satan was able to
[1:10:05] inject in us this element of pride and
[1:10:09] arrogance and whatever more he must have
[1:10:12] felt this and overcome this with the
[1:10:16] spirit in him love imagination conscious
[1:10:19] memory and all the feelings the gates to
[1:10:21] the flesh the gates to the eye and all
[1:10:23] this is why brother Ram said that he
[1:10:25] would always have people to bow their
[1:10:26] heads when he was casting out Devils
[1:10:28] because he said that our is the gate to
[1:10:33] the soul so he said if people were
[1:10:35] looking and they were looking around
[1:10:37] whenever he is casting out Devils that
[1:10:39] them Devils look for a place to go
[1:10:42] and somehow them setting there with our
[1:10:44] eyes open don't ask me how don't
[1:10:46] understand it but it would gain an
[1:10:48] entrance so what was it that dollar
[1:10:49] heads shut their eyes which was a sign
[1:10:52] of humility look how many people raised
[1:10:55] their heads and raised their eyes and
[1:10:58] demons went in a why sign of rebellion
[1:11:02] sign of stubbornness all praise God you
[1:11:06] mean something that simple that's right
[1:11:09] something just that simple is that
[1:11:11] all praise the Lord notice first fella
[1:11:14] Peter chapter 5 verse 5 likewise ye
[1:11:17] younger submit yourselves under the
[1:11:19] elder yea all of you be subject one to
[1:11:22] another and be closed o be closed with
[1:11:28] humility look at this word I've just not
[1:11:31] how to spell the other day I found this
[1:11:33] I'm not a knot or a band by which two
[1:11:39] things are fastened together closed this
[1:11:44] is what the word closed me so humility
[1:11:47] is something that our spirit our being
[1:11:51] is actually tied together
[1:11:53] it was the humility of God that tied the
[1:11:57] doves and the land together merging it
[1:12:00] in a slave's garment thank you Jesus to
[1:12:07] fasten or guard one's self this was the
[1:12:12] white scarf or apron of slaves
[1:12:17] so you knew a slave because he had no
[1:12:21] shoes on him right what no ring but they
[1:12:25] might have an earring or they might have
[1:12:27] something in their nose but would say
[1:12:29] was a sign that there was a slave but
[1:12:31] they were required to wear this type of
[1:12:34] garment you mean they had to dress a
[1:12:37] certain way well if they told the lessor
[1:12:41] I don't want to wear that white garment
[1:12:42] I have to wear a rainbow garment
[1:12:45] purple I like green I love this it shut
[1:12:48] your mouth and get this white slave
[1:12:50] garment all because you belong to me
[1:12:53] well praise the Lord
[1:12:55] this was the white scarf or apron of
[1:12:58] slaves which was fastened to the belt of
[1:13:01] the vest and distinguished slaves from
[1:13:06] free men so don't you see what being
[1:13:10] clothed in humility does it helps us to
[1:13:14] shut our mouths it helps us to keep our
[1:13:19] opinion to ourself many times and sing
[1:13:22] it going on Facebook family laundry our
[1:13:26] message laundry be quick to hear slow to
[1:13:31] speak slow to wrath so a real slave is
[1:13:39] not a troublemaker
[1:13:41] a real slave is never a person who tries
[1:13:44] to call us a split in the church a real
[1:13:48] slave is not one that tries to assert
[1:13:51] the authority of the pastor all the
[1:13:54] authority of the Deacons are those
[1:13:56] people that you have voted in to be able
[1:13:59] to represent you come on sings this was
[1:14:09] the white scarf or apron of slaves which
[1:14:12] was fastened to the belt of the vest
[1:14:15] well and distinguished slaves from
[1:14:19] Freeman also this refers to the overalls
[1:14:23] which slaves wore to keep clean while
[1:14:28] working and exceedingly humble god I
[1:14:36] don't mind telling your friends we can
[1:14:39] start out being clean in the work of the
[1:14:42] Lord but if we don't keep the slave
[1:14:44] guard on on by the gym we can become
[1:14:47] dirty while we're doing the work of the
[1:14:49] Lord
[1:14:50] now I don't mean we become dirty
[1:14:52] sexually we might not become dirty as
[1:14:54] for cigarettes or any of those things
[1:14:57] but I attitude becomes rotten well
[1:15:01] hallelujah we're living in a very trying
[1:15:04] age and the unredeemed bodies of God's
[1:15:08] children can be just as trying as in the
[1:15:10] other mortal you ever dealt with
[1:15:12] as a matter of fact she can be some of
[1:15:15] the most impatient people you'll ever
[1:15:17] deal with she can be unforgiving praise
[1:15:20] rather darling and if we're not careful
[1:15:23] about the DAO dealing with the people of
[1:15:25] God we will get dirty this is why we
[1:15:28] need a slave garment on to keep us
[1:15:31] unspotted from the world because we're
[1:15:34] dealing with people with attitudes we're
[1:15:36] dealing with people with unforgiving
[1:15:38] spirits we're dealing with people of
[1:15:40] pride and arrogance and worldliness and
[1:15:43] so on and so on
[1:15:44] and we deal with them all the time and
[1:15:47] if we don't keep the slave calling out
[1:15:49] on us if we're not careful we'll look
[1:15:51] around and find we've got the same
[1:15:53] attitude they've got and we're doing the
[1:15:55] same thing that they done and five years
[1:15:58] ago you condemned that now you're just
[1:16:00] like them why you took your slave
[1:16:03] garment off and you so I don't need it
[1:16:05] no more we need that now more than ever
[1:16:08] we need to be clothed in humility
[1:16:11] we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:14] old friends I don't want just a little
[1:16:16] doubt so the Holy Ghost
[1:16:18] a little teaspoon I want to be so full
[1:16:21] I'm running over with it
[1:16:24] [Applause]
[1:16:33] first Peter chapter 5 verse 6 humble
[1:16:37] yourselves therefore under the mighty
[1:16:42] hand of God that he may exalt you into
[1:16:48] time now let's look a little bit of the
[1:16:50] degrees of our Lord's emptying of
[1:16:54] himself
[1:16:55] the kenosis and the degrees the depths
[1:16:58] of the degrees of humility are
[1:17:01] contrasted by the heights of the degrees
[1:17:04] of glory he went to the extreme to learn
[1:17:09] no other mortal could ever go and he's
[1:17:12] been raised to a higher sphere the NIA
[1:17:15] of the world will ever be attentive he
[1:17:19] not only humbled himself to be a man but
[1:17:24] he humbled himself to be a mortal
[1:17:27] depriving himself as we've done gone
[1:17:29] through knowledge and so on and so on
[1:17:31] but he also now listen this is Jesus he
[1:17:35] humbled himself not only to become a man
[1:17:39] but to become a dead corpse now I'm glad
[1:17:53] that there are Undertaker's I'm glad
[1:17:56] there's people that can work in that
[1:17:57] field but I'd rather be a painter and I
[1:18:00] hate painting I'd rather be a plumber or
[1:18:03] not hate plumbing I'd I can think of all
[1:18:06] kinds of things I'd rather be than to be
[1:18:08] a mortician
[1:18:10] I'm glad by the rockin and brotherly and
[1:18:13] these other folks is able to do this we
[1:18:15] need them I'm glad that there's people
[1:18:16] who can do it but I person just don't
[1:18:18] like hanging around dead bodies whether
[1:18:23] they're nodding or laying in a box
[1:18:24] either way I just don't so he ain't not
[1:18:33] only humbled himself to become a mortal
[1:18:36] man but a corpse friend Dan is our
[1:18:42] lowest degree as far as the human body
[1:18:46] now think of movie stars kings
[1:18:50] potentates magistrate's no matter who we
[1:18:53] are how great we are in this life when
[1:18:56] it comes to that we're all on the same
[1:18:58] plane lost are saved because the save
[1:19:02] part of us in the corpse is now gone
[1:19:05] so the corpse lying there will start to
[1:19:09] generated the nose of folium it is our
[1:19:13] worst crowning in our mortality as a
[1:19:17] mortal is to become a corpse praise the
[1:19:23] Lord
[1:19:24] oh no they can hold woman's body all
[1:19:26] they want to and think one day that
[1:19:28] science will be able to resurrect him
[1:19:30] and bring into life that's a bunch of
[1:19:32] baloney they'll never give him live for
[1:19:34] here the son of gods for so give him
[1:19:36] life one day it will be judged for what
[1:19:38] he's done man we'll never break into
[1:19:40] that realm to be able to impart eternal
[1:19:42] life there's only one that can do that
[1:19:46] but he humbles himself to be Amanda had
[1:19:49] a headache all such humility I lose
[1:19:52] himself to feel stress and duress and
[1:19:54] pain and all that such humility but
[1:19:58] notice it was not Christ that became a
[1:20:02] corpse
[1:20:04] it was Jesus well let me just go ahead
[1:20:12] and give you all the clue and if I go by
[1:20:14] the way of the grave
[1:20:15] the real Dhoni won't be a corpse that's
[1:20:19] right neither will you
[1:20:20] I mean you've seen enough funerals I
[1:20:22] grew up the church and we walked by and
[1:20:23] you know I only might touch on their
[1:20:25] hands I don't like I just don't know I'm
[1:20:28] not spooked or nothing like that I just
[1:20:30] don't cuz I know that anything I want to
[1:20:32] remember him whenever I saw them in
[1:20:34] their health so my mouth happy and
[1:20:36] shouting around and praising God Wow
[1:20:38] because that is the worst degradation
[1:20:41] that we're able to be identified with
[1:20:43] laying there lapis and you're laying
[1:20:46] there and people come around looking at
[1:20:47] you and you say leave me alone
[1:20:50] don't come on you're looking at me you
[1:20:54] can't say nothing you can do nothing
[1:20:56] they don't never fix your hair you got
[1:20:58] makeup on you what come on be honest
[1:21:11] laden sod that term has my corpse but
[1:21:21] the dev on the corpse the Father Christ
[1:21:25] chosen course
[1:21:29] so he had to humble himself to the death
[1:21:33] of the cross Jesus did he bought
[1:21:41] patiently endured the shame meekly and
[1:21:47] overcome yes hell in the grave the curse
[1:21:50] he was stood it obediently that the
[1:21:54] wrath of God could be satisfied the
[1:21:57] Justice of God could be pacified and you
[1:22:01] and I could be reconciled to the
[1:22:03] presence of Almighty God I was in a
[1:22:06] conference it was not accomplished by
[1:22:09] walking on water going into the
[1:22:11] hospitals and clearing out the hospital
[1:22:13] it was through the greatest act of
[1:22:15] humility this world has ever known he
[1:22:18] did not conquer sin nor Saints by
[1:22:21] walking on water he did not conquer sin
[1:22:24] by healing the sick he conquered sin by
[1:22:27] humbling himself praise be to God
[1:22:37] notice in hebrews 10:7 then said i lo i
[1:22:42] come in the volume of the book it is
[1:22:46] written of me to do thy will o God the
[1:22:52] lamb speaking to the dove verse 9 then
[1:22:57] said he lo I come to do that will of God
[1:22:59] he taketh away the first that he may
[1:23:02] establish the second wonder why Paul
[1:23:05] kept reiterating this over and over
[1:23:07] again that the man Jesus the man Jesus
[1:23:11] became obedient he wants to run a
[1:23:13] parallel that we can see if we are truly
[1:23:16] Christians with the Spirit of Christ
[1:23:18] sent us we will be obedient to his every
[1:23:21] word
[1:23:22] [Applause]
[1:23:24] Philippians today being found in fashion
[1:23:27] as a man he humbled himself and became
[1:23:29] obedient unto death he obeyed when
[1:23:34] obedience would render him a corpse and
[1:23:42] if God asks us to clean out the books
[1:23:45] for reading or the music for listening
[1:23:48] to or movies it's filthy that you're
[1:23:51] watching a pride and arrogance and a
[1:23:56] stuffed shirt and whatever more all we
[1:23:58] just moan and groan and bellyache acting
[1:24:01] like were giving up off the singing ever
[1:24:03] us and his was completely voluntary in
[1:24:09] the attitude of an obedience sir I get
[1:24:13] my cigarettes up you might as well keep
[1:24:16] them with that attitude because you come
[1:24:20] to church and you'll be mad at me and
[1:24:22] God out on me I'm just fine no I'll buy
[1:24:29] your back cuz until you get the right
[1:24:33] spirit on you it ain't gonna do no good
[1:24:36] [Applause]
[1:24:43] remember brother branham tell him
[1:24:45] brother Charlie's daddy about smoking
[1:24:49] the cigarettes and he said I'll go buy
[1:24:51] him a pack myself
[1:24:52] he won't smoke another one wise attitude
[1:24:56] was right that's right if I could live
[1:25:00] sorry cigarette if I Nevada said there
[1:25:02] you go back to what you can do again he
[1:25:04] said well what do I have to do I he said
[1:25:06] I told him nothing you accept what he's
[1:25:09] already done so what I can do that
[1:25:11] he said here's a creek oh the very form
[1:25:19] of his dance it was not a nice placid
[1:25:23] death that he goes in and lifestyle and
[1:25:25] folds his hand and he's able to do that
[1:25:27] but he dies the lowest death a man could
[1:25:30] die do you know that crucifixion was
[1:25:32] only safe a Roman citizen could not even
[1:25:34] be crucified a normal average everyday
[1:25:38] Roman citizen could not be crucified
[1:25:41] Jesus was subjected beneath them oh my
[1:25:49] notice in Galatians 3:13 Christ has
[1:25:52] redeemed us from the curse of the law
[1:25:55] being made a curse for us for it is
[1:25:59] written cursed is every one that hangeth
[1:26:03] on a tree Hebrews softer looking unto
[1:26:07] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[1:26:09] faith who for the joy this is this who
[1:26:11] for the joy that was set before him this
[1:26:18] is the way my brother's sister we
[1:26:19] overcome hardships set the joy of your
[1:26:22] reward the rejoice over coming the joy
[1:26:25] the crown of life the joy of the things
[1:26:27] that lay in front of you who was for the
[1:26:29] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:26:32] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:26:35] down at the right hand of the throne of
[1:26:38] God
[1:26:40] now you're not rejoice of this but can
[1:26:43] you imagine living in the first century
[1:26:45] and you're a Jew and you pick up and
[1:26:48] read the Torah where the Torah says
[1:26:50] cursed is every man that hangs on a tree
[1:26:53] or you're Greek you're a Gentile and
[1:26:58] your gods are gods that are Hermes and
[1:27:01] you know Herodotus and all these
[1:27:02] different gods and you dress them and
[1:27:04] splendor you dress them and roll your
[1:27:06] robes and you're this new Christian God
[1:27:09] I'm gonna cross naked you're gonna
[1:27:13] introduce this Jesus to a Greek the
[1:27:23] Greek who is accustomed to convey its
[1:27:25] divinities with great crowns great rules
[1:27:30] you imagine as they begin to hear about
[1:27:33] this this Jesus is Jesus and he the one
[1:27:36] that did get that they killed and he the
[1:27:39] one that they beat and stripped it and
[1:27:40] you say he's caught the Son of God not
[1:27:43] only that is God Oh No
[1:27:48] did you see why was a stumbling block to
[1:27:50] the Jews it looked like according to the
[1:27:53] very law he broke their law he didn't
[1:27:57] break it he fulfilled it he was the
[1:28:00] consummation of it all he pulled it
[1:28:03] within himself can have few more minutes
[1:28:11] let's contrast I'll say a 14 with
[1:28:16] Philippians 2 Philippians 2:5 let this
[1:28:19] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:28:21] Jesus who being in the form of God
[1:28:24] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:28:25] God but made himself of no reputation L
[1:28:28] at this man being you to follow the same
[1:28:31] pattern made himself of no reputation to
[1:28:34] go upon in the form of a servant and was
[1:28:37] made in the likeness of men and being
[1:28:39] found in fashion as a man I'm not
[1:28:41] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:28:43] even the death of the cross
[1:28:45] now let's go to Isaiah 14:12 how art our
[1:28:50] fallen from
[1:28:51] heaven o Lucifer son of the morning the
[1:28:59] word there's heylia light-bearer shining
[1:29:04] one Morningstar how art thou fallen from
[1:29:13] heaven now we see a new image
[1:29:18] represented in the prophetic inside of I
[1:29:21] said the prophet able to go to the very
[1:29:25] beginning of sin in the universe now
[1:29:30] notice he doesn't say that he had a
[1:29:33] parallel or a Winston or a big cigar a
[1:29:36] God called him on a website
[1:29:39] a God called him over in the court of
[1:29:41] heaven drunk oh my this magnificent
[1:29:50] monarch the height of this order of
[1:29:55] angels oh ma he was so beautiful and so
[1:30:03] magnificent and his excellence and glory
[1:30:07] that in his pride he got lifted up
[1:30:13] Lucifer also means Daystar hail L to
[1:30:17] shine or Lucifer Daystar so here is the
[1:30:24] beginning of sin in the universe they
[1:30:28] begin with two simple words I will
[1:30:35] so the son of the morning Lord Jesus
[1:30:41] the son of the morning or the morning
[1:30:45] star hmm Lucifer he begin to look around
[1:30:51] in heaven one day and he realized in
[1:30:55] this category of angels
[1:30:57] he was the greatest the most magnificent
[1:31:01] there was no one as great as him as far
[1:31:06] as angels and there's only one place for
[1:31:10] him to go in order to excel his
[1:31:14] greatness because within himself earned
[1:31:17] sin started and he began to look at
[1:31:20] himself instead of looking at the will
[1:31:22] of God because you can't say I will and
[1:31:25] God's will at the same time unless you
[1:31:29] say not my will but thy will be done
[1:31:32] well min Carol have this saying all the
[1:31:34] time at home people's gonna do what they
[1:31:35] want to do it's pretty simple but it's
[1:31:38] true well I'll tell you what if they're
[1:31:39] gonna do that I figure I will - they're
[1:31:43] gonna do what I wanna do I want to serve
[1:31:45] God I want to go to church I want to
[1:31:48] live right
[1:31:48] I want to say with this word people's
[1:31:50] leaving the message you know how they
[1:31:51] want to do it well if I want to do that
[1:31:53] then there are to be another people that
[1:31:55] has another will inside of them that
[1:31:57] lines up works a little the father and
[1:31:59] that's the same will the Lord Jesus a so
[1:32:02] the Lord Jesus was actually able to
[1:32:04] consummate the life's phase of this
[1:32:07] battle in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:32:08] nevertheless not my will here is the
[1:32:11] Alma the answering in the contrast to
[1:32:14] what healy else said in the very
[1:32:16] beginning when sin first started I will
[1:32:20] and he says how long I won't do what I
[1:32:24] want to do I won't go the way that I
[1:32:26] wanna I will not go my way I want your
[1:32:30] will oh my goodness oh I gotta go a
[1:32:43] little bit farther here I don't leave
[1:32:44] you hanging too far
[1:32:46] listen let's look at his original
[1:32:48] position now did you know that in heaven
[1:32:51] the devil was God's right-hand man in
[1:32:55] the beginning that Lucifer the son of
[1:32:59] the morning was given power and the
[1:33:03] reason he was brought sin into the world
[1:33:05] he was able to take something that God
[1:33:07] had created and perverted back into an
[1:33:10] evil thing which started all the sholden
[1:33:12] beginning then God back before the
[1:33:14] foundation of the world was ever late
[1:33:16] now listen when this happened what he's
[1:33:18] saying what Satan done in his so I ask
[1:33:28] you is this dangerous
[1:33:35] inhales pry went over in the north and
[1:33:41] set up a kingdom and fought against
[1:33:45] Michael which was Christ and His angels
[1:33:50] do you see it I do the right hand band
[1:33:54] of Almighty God was a Lucifer so one day
[1:34:03] in heaven he got tired of being the
[1:34:04] associate pastor into Saturday to start
[1:34:06] his own church
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:16] the sound of the morning the first God
[1:34:19] granted him almost coworkers with him he
[1:34:24] was a co-worker partly equal was him
[1:34:32] this can't you see why Satan loves to do
[1:34:35] things I get in churches remember the
[1:34:40] day I was under meetings several years
[1:34:42] ago Madero pointed out a certain
[1:34:45] individual there at that place was a
[1:34:47] worker in that certain area where we
[1:34:50] were at war really dying that guy's such
[1:34:51] a blessing and I said I said brother
[1:34:53] Darrell people like that man right there
[1:34:56] are some of the most dangerous people
[1:34:59] you can have in a church he said really
[1:35:01] I said absolutely they get among the
[1:35:06] people and they talk and they do this
[1:35:09] and that and the other well little did I
[1:35:14] know that man just happened to be doing
[1:35:16] that very thing that same time that we
[1:35:19] was there just some years ago in Canada
[1:35:22] and I preached along this line about
[1:35:24] Satan being God's right hand man while
[1:35:28] they're on the pulpit some of the people
[1:35:29] I knew who most of them I didn't but
[1:35:31] there was a man said behind me that
[1:35:32] didn't know who he was
[1:35:33] I just knew this an associate on the
[1:35:35] local churches so I wrote this quote and
[1:35:39] I said
[1:35:40] like this better here he gets child to
[1:35:44] be an associate that introduced him tell
[1:35:46] me he was an associate on the church's
[1:35:47] there he decided been the associate here
[1:35:50] on the church and he wants to start his
[1:35:53] own church well in about three months
[1:35:56] they call me and said did you know I
[1:35:58] said no what he said that very man that
[1:36:02] you pointed to was behind the scenes
[1:36:04] working right then that's not important
[1:36:05] that I know what's important is God knew
[1:36:07] and he wanted him to know we do praise
[1:36:11] the Lord
[1:36:12] now friends I don't care P I feel then I
[1:36:15] feel that do whatever you want to do but
[1:36:17] when you follow into this line I'll tell
[1:36:20] you what I'm gonna call you anointed of
[1:36:22] the death I don't care but the horn does
[1:36:27] this very saying he's anointed to the
[1:36:29] death
[1:36:29] but alas brother down anybody else
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:35] and any you follow them and something to
[1:36:38] revoke that's contrary to the word
[1:36:39] you're as bad as fallen angels oh boy
[1:36:46] it's getting warm in here ain't it man
[1:36:48] alive but you see it's not just that way
[1:36:54] in a family on a church rather church
[1:36:56] family but it also gets in homes uh-huh
[1:37:00] child begins to get or they think they
[1:37:02] know more than mom and dad sometimes
[1:37:04] alive can think she knows more and
[1:37:06] sometimes a wife does know more than us
[1:37:08] but but a single justifier to take his
[1:37:10] place it's even a man steps out of his
[1:37:13] place and the whole continuity of the
[1:37:15] home is broken
[1:37:16] and many times a woman has to step up
[1:37:18] and she actually becomes the priests of
[1:37:20] the home because a man's the
[1:37:22] second-story lazy that he won't take a
[1:37:24] spiritual position in the home which is
[1:37:26] an absolute shame your Jesus I'm leaving
[1:37:31] [Applause]
[1:37:34] you men get in your place be the
[1:37:38] spiritual priest of your home be the
[1:37:41] right kind of men in your home and your
[1:37:43] wives can be in their place and their
[1:37:45] children can be in their place
[1:37:53] best and
[1:38:08] let me finish this quote for you cannot
[1:38:11] notice this it was partly equal with him
[1:38:15] only Satan could not create God is the
[1:38:17] only creator but Satan took something
[1:38:19] God created and perverted it back into
[1:38:22] something else
[1:38:22] evil question answers Satan was the
[1:38:26] original archangel of God he wants dwelt
[1:38:32] in the heaven he wants was the greatest
[1:38:35] person in the heavens outside of God so
[1:38:43] there's only one person between him and
[1:38:45] his goals one person stopping him from
[1:38:50] being everything he aspires to in his
[1:38:52] dreams just so happens it's the eternal
[1:39:01] now if it's me a simple bullet in the
[1:39:04] right place wipes me out and grenade
[1:39:09] mashed potatoes that's what I look like
[1:39:14] but you can't blow God up can't shoot
[1:39:18] him can't kill him
[1:39:20] can't drowned him can't overcoming but
[1:39:25] he was so determined
[1:39:27] he's been trying for thousands of years
[1:39:30] then I would give him credit for this
[1:39:32] he's got much more of a determination
[1:39:34] than some of us did we go Solis little
[1:39:36] saying oh my brother darlings preach on
[1:39:38] me I'm going back no more I burned this
[1:39:40] Devils hat every time I come to church
[1:39:41] and he's the most faithful member I've
[1:39:43] got he's here when some of y'all stay at
[1:39:46] the house you got a head on a stream the
[1:39:49] devil said man I ain't streaming I'm
[1:39:50] going to church I'm gonna see what kind
[1:39:52] of trouble I can cause the line back
[1:39:54] demons don't sure
[1:39:59] they covet friends preachers call him
[1:40:02] alarms preachers I'm tell you what he's
[1:40:04] doing they call him but deceiveth they
[1:40:06] called him ever name imaginable and he's
[1:40:08] right there don't stop and don't even
[1:40:10] slow him down we beat him we thrash him
[1:40:13] we whip him we cast him out we call in
[1:40:15] everything we can call him in the
[1:40:17] confines of the Word of God and he's
[1:40:18] right back down to fight tomorrow like
[1:40:20] it's a brand new day and fight like he's
[1:40:22] gonna win but he's not the winner we
[1:40:43] read this to you Satan was the original
[1:40:46] Archangel of God wants throughout in
[1:40:48] heaven he was once the greatest person
[1:40:50] in the heavens now let's be honest if we
[1:40:53] was going to make ourself an enemy we
[1:40:56] would never make one that was this close
[1:40:59] now under the law of contracts you got
[1:41:01] to prove your greatness but your
[1:41:02] greatness has to be tried by negativity
[1:41:04] it has to be tried but something to
[1:41:06] contrast against it so there was no
[1:41:08] enemy
[1:41:08] there was nothing God could not make
[1:41:10] sense so it makes this being about which
[1:41:12] knowing his Satan had a soul and in his
[1:41:14] soul is where this sin was birthed at
[1:41:16] the universal sin but he don't want to
[1:41:19] make this little video guy
[1:41:20] here's Almighty God can do all these
[1:41:22] great things and how comes his little
[1:41:24] but he wants to make him right up
[1:41:34] here where he can look God face to face
[1:41:41] and tell him
[1:41:48] you said the devil talks his people into
[1:41:50] smoking dope with the devil and smarter
[1:41:52] than that he don't smoke though you
[1:41:55] don't drink he don't do no that said
[1:41:56] you'll never catch him there he wants to
[1:41:59] be like God
[1:42:03] Otis says he said he was God's
[1:42:07] right-hand man Wow
[1:42:13] so if Jesus pre-existed as a man in
[1:42:17] heaven as a little boy setting over by
[1:42:20] his daddy's right hand the right hand
[1:42:30] men to fellowship was Lucifer none
[1:42:35] another God he was God's right hand men
[1:42:40] to fellowship and listen what happened
[1:42:42] to him
[1:42:43] he got puffed up I'm above God's Word
[1:42:52] I'm above God's plan look friends bring
[1:42:57] it down home now this is what's still
[1:43:00] left in our unconverted flesh that when
[1:43:03] we hear something preach that we don't
[1:43:05] like we're guilty of that we struggle
[1:43:06] with or we take our shovel and give it
[1:43:11] to brother lack careful careful
[1:43:14] everybody's stepping on brother night
[1:43:16] y'all ready on three one two three don't
[1:43:19] you doc
[1:43:21] [Laughter]
[1:43:24] in that guy anything left let's put it
[1:43:26] on by the team you know what you're
[1:43:33] doing don't you
[1:43:34] you're puffing up in your heart I don't
[1:43:37] need that stuff you do while we're
[1:43:40] sewing so vineyard or not well I wish
[1:43:41] they would have to maybe they'll hear
[1:43:42] the tape but you were here so apparently
[1:43:44] you needed some of you right
[1:43:52] all my friends what a great treasure
[1:43:58] humility is being able tomboy yourself
[1:44:03] not only before God but before your
[1:44:07] brothers and sisters thank God it's
[1:44:11] better to get a few and they'd like to
[1:44:21] be remembered to have before the Lord
[1:44:23] you say God keep this evil thing away
[1:44:25] from me
[1:44:26] Pratt arrogance what's one of the worst
[1:44:31] things I've ever seen in my life is many
[1:44:32] times people who's got it so bad they
[1:44:34] don't think they do they don't think
[1:44:37] they did they don't even realize how
[1:44:39] much they brag on their sale and talk
[1:44:40] about their self and exhaust herself
[1:44:42] there so eat up with it they don't even
[1:44:46] realize Lord Jesus I know that
[1:44:55] worldliness Compass's so many many
[1:44:58] things but father we see right here the
[1:45:02] king of worldliness he didn't begin with
[1:45:06] smoking or drinking or lying and we know
[1:45:08] all that's attributes of unbelief but in
[1:45:12] his heart he was lifted up because of
[1:45:15] his pride it's amazing how brother
[1:45:17] Brendan catches that whenever he tells
[1:45:19] us about sisters and they come to the
[1:45:22] Lord and they let their hair grow to
[1:45:23] growing out and then they go to looking
[1:45:26] at their self and thinking how pretty
[1:45:28] and attractive they are and Satan takes
[1:45:31] that very thing that they're commanded
[1:45:33] in the word to do and if they're not
[1:45:35] careful he'll turn it into an element of
[1:45:37] pride if we're not careful you've
[1:45:43] allowed us to hear and see and
[1:45:45] understand things that the majority of
[1:45:48] the church world will never see never
[1:45:51] hear but God help us to realize pride
[1:45:55] will try to come in and make us arrogant
[1:45:59] we'll look down on others that don't
[1:46:02] know what we know don't hear what we
[1:46:05] hear
[1:46:06] instead of approaching it with a
[1:46:07] thankful heart with appreciation we
[1:46:11] approach it with an element of pride
[1:46:13] forgive us Lord the only thing good that
[1:46:18] we have in our hearts in Our Lives
[1:46:19] tonight is because of your grace so we
[1:46:23] have nothing really in ourselves to be
[1:46:25] proud of
[1:46:25] we can't boast or brag or anything about
[1:46:30] us if we have gifts you gave them to us
[1:46:33] Lord these brothers that have been
[1:46:36] successful many of them Lord they
[1:46:38] testify it's your grace and your
[1:46:40] goodness too may they always be that way
[1:46:42] but they never begin to sink in their
[1:46:45] mind well I've done this and I've done
[1:46:46] that God keep us from such stuff
[1:46:50] ministers that are here Lord the
[1:46:52] minister around the world to the bride
[1:46:53] we see it over and over again when
[1:46:55] preachers go to get and lifting it up
[1:46:57] and thinking there's something and
[1:46:59] thinking their gift is so elite and
[1:47:02] those so super spiritual and they're so
[1:47:05] far above everybody else lord help us to
[1:47:08] realize we're on our way out when they
[1:47:11] go to thinking of such help us Lord
[1:47:14] Jesus to realize the only way we can
[1:47:17] still be used consistently is wilmarie
[1:47:21] being used more and more is that we must
[1:47:24] maintain that littleness in our own
[1:47:26] sight it's not left up to other people
[1:47:29] to think little of us it must be self
[1:47:33] generated and it can only come divinely
[1:47:37] on the birth of the Lamb and our soul
[1:47:39] and that lamb goes to living out the
[1:47:43] merged nature of the Lamb and the dove
[1:47:46] merges in us by the miraculous new birth
[1:47:50] praise God praise God then that nature
[1:47:55] helps us Lord and it's a battle every
[1:47:58] day that we live father one way or
[1:48:01] another but we so thank you for your
[1:48:04] over income overcoming power in our
[1:48:06] lives I pray for each man woman boy girl
[1:48:10] Lord we know the way Satanists got this
[1:48:12] civilization set up it ain't enough
[1:48:15] anymore to have a college education it
[1:48:17] ain't enough Lord to have just
[1:48:19] a high school diploma but you got to
[1:48:21] have this degree in that degree on that
[1:48:23] degree on that degree we know where all
[1:48:24] that's coming from and Lord we're not
[1:48:27] saying so much that it's sin or wrong
[1:48:29] for people to do it but I pray you help
[1:48:30] our young people Lord to realize the
[1:48:32] more educated they become no more smart
[1:48:35] and the more brilliant they become in
[1:48:36] their mind help them father to realize
[1:48:38] that never replace his face help them
[1:48:41] father to always keep faith first even
[1:48:44] if their education says one thing and
[1:48:46] the word says something else they always
[1:48:49] stay with the word because all it'll
[1:48:52] take is one little professor that goes
[1:48:54] to question in this or that or the other
[1:48:55] and then another and then another then
[1:48:57] another then they got all kinds of
[1:48:59] questions in their mind and their faith
[1:49:01] is being questioned by their intellect
[1:49:02] but lord help us to believe if every
[1:49:06] college in the world says we're crazy
[1:49:07] ever professor says we're out of our
[1:49:10] mind what difference does that make
[1:49:11] we're not following professors we're
[1:49:13] following the Lord Jesus we love your
[1:49:16] Lord search our hearts and out would you
[1:49:19] Jesus see if there's any pride any

[1:49:38] they follow the directions and they
[1:49:40] climb upon the table and do what they're
[1:49:42] told to do and then they let the machine
[1:49:44] do the rest of it and then the results
[1:49:47] are displayed and someone is to read it

[1:54:48] praise God thank you Father
[1:54:51] amen god bless you saints loving the
[1:54:54] Lord this pray together will let you be
[1:54:56] dismissed I know everybody is aware of
[1:54:59] this coronavirus and all this stuff
[1:55:01] that's going around
[1:55:03] we know the Prophet tells us and the
[1:55:05] last days there's going to be diseases
[1:55:06] and things that's going to come up on
[1:55:07] the earth that'll make cancer look you
[1:55:10] know like a toothache just so mild is
[1:55:13] this it I don't have a clue but I know
[1:55:15] that it's rampant I know that the CDC
[1:55:18] and who and all those different folks
[1:55:20] are really worried about a pandemic
[1:55:22] level but I believe our God is still in
[1:55:24] the business of protecting his people
[1:55:26] thank you so once you remember all that
[1:55:29] but got a lot of sickness I know that
[1:55:30] you're aware of a different prayer
[1:55:31] requests and so many needs among the the
[1:55:34] Saints but the wrong Spencer began his
[1:55:36] treatment yesterday and they're doing
[1:55:37] what they called an immunotherapy which
[1:55:39] means they take the t-cells out of his
[1:55:42] body and supercharge them somehow put
[1:55:45] those his same t-cells back into his
[1:55:47] body and then it attacks the cancer in
[1:55:50] his body so we want to just pray for our
[1:55:53] brother that God will just be with him
[1:55:54] and God will help him they helped his
[1:55:58] body to be able to react to it because
[1:56:00] the cancerous in the fourth stage in
[1:56:02] both of his lungs and because it's in
[1:56:03] both lungs they cannot of course operate
[1:56:05] be able to take the lungs out and
[1:56:07] replace them but our God specializes and
[1:56:09] things that seem like just totally
[1:56:12] impossible when the doctors told brother
[1:56:14] Ron he said there's one thing about it
[1:56:15] this miracle will be truly authenticated
[1:56:18] because we've got test after test after
[1:56:20] test and proof after proof so I like I
[1:56:23] mean you got doctors that are testifying
[1:56:25] that God is able to move
[1:56:27] a man god bless you heard you had some
[1:56:30] good services from brother home of us
[1:56:32] here and so appreciate our brother
[1:56:34] coming up and and being with us god
[1:56:36] bless you let's pray together as we go
[1:56:38] Heavenly Father is we come to the close
[1:56:41] of this another service Lord and I
[1:56:43] realize myself and every person here
[1:56:46] will have to stand an answer at that day
[1:56:48] for this very service I will have to
[1:56:52] answer for what I spoke the attitude I
[1:56:54] spoke it in the Lord they will have to
[1:56:57] answer for their response they'll have
[1:56:59] to answer for what they do with it
[1:57:01] so we know that with the word comes
[1:57:03] great responsibility so it's not that
[1:57:06] we're just setting around and being fed
[1:57:08] all the time and pampered but it comes
[1:57:10] with an awesome position for us but we
[1:57:13] believe you empower us Lord to help us
[1:57:15] fulfill that responsibility
[1:57:17] so as we depart from this place in that
[1:57:19] Lord we're so grateful that we don't
[1:57:21] have to leave your presence but you'll
[1:57:22] go with us Lord we're just thinking of
[1:57:24] all the sickness and all the disease or
[1:57:27] we will look at our nation that the
[1:57:29] shape that it's in or never ever
[1:57:32] believed that a socialist running for
[1:57:36] president would ever get off the ground
[1:57:38] in our nation but we see it Lord how
[1:57:42] frightening that it is if we look at it
[1:57:44] humanly the Lord to see the government
[1:57:48] and politics and where they are it's so
[1:57:50] scary looking at it in the natural sense
[1:57:52] but we're so glad our faith is not in
[1:57:55] politics
[1:57:56] Lord Jesus I pray you would keep us Lord
[1:57:59] in this hour of Darkness keep us Lord
[1:58:02] Jesus safe and the protection of your
[1:58:05] word not only in the physical part but
[1:58:07] keep our souls Lord God folks are going
[1:58:10] astray folks think it ain't worth living
[1:58:12] no more but Lord Jesus we want to be in
[1:58:15] love with you more than ever before
[1:58:18] hallelujah because falling in love with
[1:58:21] Jesus was the best thing we ever done we
[1:58:24] was trapped in that other marriage and
[1:58:26] we didn't have no choice but once once
[1:58:29] we started hearing your words and
[1:58:30] feeling your sweet arms around us it was
[1:58:33] the best thing we ever done in our lives
[1:58:35] go with us now Lord keep your people
[1:58:37] Lord so much sickness abound but father
[1:58:40] we still
[1:58:41] fess and believe in claim that you are
[1:58:43] our healer go with us now Lord bring us
