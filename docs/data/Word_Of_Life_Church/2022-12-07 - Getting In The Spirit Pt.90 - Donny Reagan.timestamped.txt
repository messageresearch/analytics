[24:53] while we're getting ready this this
[24:56] morning
[24:57] the Lord was able
[25:00] read a scripture
[25:02] but if any man love God
[25:04] the same is known of him
[25:08] the Lord has proven that in my life
[25:09] recently
[25:11] many of you heard a testimony and won't
[25:13] give it now
[25:14] now but it's not long ago brother Reagan
[25:17] introduced me to brother Ron Spence
[25:19] first time I think I thought I'd ever
[25:22] met him in a hotel right before he was
[25:24] in brother Green's meetings
[25:27] was a few weeks later I attended a
[25:29] service and
[25:31] became aware that I was the man that
[25:33] he'd been looking for for many years the
[25:35] Holy Spirit he spoke to him told him
[25:38] that incident for many times
[25:40] when I read that scripture this morning
[25:42] I realized
[25:43] and it's made me quite emotional that
[25:47] how much he loves us amen
[25:51] so thankful all of us I know all of us
[25:53] have that testimony
[25:57] now who can speak to a and he
[26:00] stand right up and walk
[26:02] who can cause the deaf and dumb to hear
[26:05] and start to talk and who can calm a
[26:09] fevered brow saying let it be with just
[26:13] a little bit of clay touch you in a way
[26:15] the blinded eyes didn't see I'm telling
[26:17] you that he can and I don't let you
[26:21] stand right by my side when the world
[26:24] comes crumbling

[26:51] but he's done all that he laid down his
[26:55] life and he rose live again
[26:58] oh and now what can cause an old man
[27:01] that's about to say goodbye just to lift
[27:05] up both of those dying hands the tearing
[27:08] from his eyes with his loved ones
[27:11] gathered all around him he can smile and
[27:14] say don't fear cause the one that
[27:16] brought me through the storms Gonna
[27:19] Leave me home from here Robin tell it if
[27:21] he can but I know that he'll stand right
[27:26] by my side when the world as crumpling

[40:25] [Music]
[40:31] [Applause]
[40:33] [Music]
[40:45] praise the Lord
[40:48] looking at the life of David the way we
[40:51] have been the last few weeks
[40:53] that gives that Psalm a little different
[40:54] meaning
[40:56] since that comes from the psalm psalm
[40:59] 51.
[41:00] if you have a a Bible that includes
[41:04] whenever those psalms were written in
[41:07] verse 1 it will tell you that that Psalm
[41:10] was written after Nathan had visited
[41:13] David
[41:15] with this situation with Bathsheba
[41:20] so this man was praying oh God don't
[41:23] take your spirit from me restore to me
[41:26] the joy of my salvation
[41:28] and you know what God did
[41:30] exactly that
[41:32] Lord Willem will look at it this weekend
[41:34] at the power
[41:36] of repentance what a single heart can be
[41:40] able to do
[41:42] God bless you
[41:43] let's turn tonight
[41:45] I don't want to get sidetracked on that
[41:47] do we Revelation Chapter 19 Verse 6.
[41:53] I'm just happy to be here tonight
[41:55] anybody sad to be here nobody okay good
[41:58] that's good
[42:00] we're happy to be gathered together even
[42:02] if it's in the Holiday Inn
[42:04] amen praise the Lord
[42:06] Revelation 19 6.
[42:09] and I heard as it were the voice of a
[42:12] great multitude and as the voice of many
[42:14] Waters and there's the voice of Mighty
[42:18] thunderings saying
[42:20] halleluia
[42:22] for the Lord God
[42:24] omnipotent Rangers
[42:27] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[42:30] honor
[42:32] to him
[42:33] for the marriage of the Lamb is come
[42:38] and his wife
[42:42] has made herself ready what you notice
[42:45] now he doesn't call her bride
[42:49] hmm
[42:50] doesn't call her bride but calls her
[42:53] wife
[42:55] his wife has made herself ready notice
[42:59] again she didn't make herself life
[43:03] that she made herself ready
[43:06] we do not make ourselves bright neither
[43:08] can we make our family bride or anybody
[43:10] else bride but we can by his provision
[43:14] make ourselves ready
[43:16] look at verse 8. and to her was granted
[43:21] that she should be arraigned in fine
[43:24] linen
[43:26] clean and white
[43:28] for the fine linen
[43:30] is the righteousness
[43:33] of saints that was granted unto her that
[43:36] she should be clothed in fine linen I
[43:39] love this word in the Greek whenever
[43:41] John chose to write this it's a
[43:44] different word than the Hebrew whenever
[43:45] they wrote in the Old Testament and it
[43:48] was from the purest most brilliant white
[43:52] linen that could be found during this
[43:54] time frame as a matter of fact the Lenin
[43:57] was so outstanding it was worth more
[44:00] than gold
[44:02] this linen was so beautiful and so
[44:07] brilliant and John chose that particular
[44:10] word to describe what his wife was
[44:13] dressed in let's read it again and to
[44:16] her was granted that she should be
[44:17] arrayed and find Lenin clean
[44:22] and white clean and white
[44:26] you know enough about God and so do I if
[44:29] we're ever going to stand there like
[44:30] that it's going to be a provision of
[44:32] Grace
[44:34] for the fine linen
[44:36] now this is the key to this is the
[44:39] righteousness
[44:40] of the Saints now what's amazing is
[44:44] that she is never attributed to being
[44:47] white clean or holy catharizo is the
[44:50] word there which means set apart
[44:51] Sanctified cleansed were never
[44:54] identified by being that way by our
[44:57] righteousness
[44:58] why would John ever say the
[45:01] righteousness of the Saints
[45:04] because you see it's his righteousness
[45:05] it's given and then we take that
[45:07] righteousness and do the right things
[45:09] about it
[45:11] so again the word that he used here is a
[45:13] coupling together of the grace of God
[45:16] and the works of people that we do what
[45:19] God bids us to do and it is
[45:22] righteousness what is righteousness
[45:24] right living
[45:26] right living
[45:28] I mean a lot to be remembered tonight in
[45:30] prayer we've got several in our church
[45:32] family that are sick some with flu some
[45:35] of the viruses covered this that
[45:37] brother Tim burdette's wife sister
[45:41] Elaine has been diagnosed with covid and
[45:44] I've been in touch with him the last
[45:45] couple days in Texas a couple hours ago
[45:48] and he just responded to me a few
[45:49] minutes ago and he said that she's very
[45:52] very sick and is really concerned about
[45:54] her tonight and he asked me if I would
[45:56] mention it to you that we would be able
[45:58] to remember her tonight before the Lord
[46:00] I mean he has a need in your heart
[46:03] let's just pray
[46:06] Lord Jesus
[46:08] father we know that as long as we're
[46:10] here in this life
[46:12] that our bodies are susceptible to
[46:15] sickness and disease and germs and so
[46:19] many things father the Holy Ghost within
[46:21] our soul does not always protect us from
[46:25] a cold or a cough or the flu or many of
[46:29] these other things but Lord Jesus we
[46:32] have this promise that many are the
[46:33] afflictions of the righteous but the
[46:36] Lord delivereth them out of them all
[46:38] so we pray for our brothers and sisters
[46:41] part of our family tonight that are sick
[46:44] some still dealing with after effects of
[46:47] flu and coughing and this and that we
[46:49] pray that you'll be mindful of each one
[46:51] tonight Lord we also pray for our sister
[46:54] Burdette that you would move for her
[46:57] father We join together our faith in the
[47:00] promise of your word and we ask you in
[47:02] the name of Jesus that you would touch
[47:05] our sister Lord may you make her well
[47:07] father just from Reading brother Tim's
[47:09] text I could tell that he was very
[47:11] concerned about her but may the spirit
[47:13] of God go to it where she is tonight in
[47:16] the name of Jesus would you touch our
[47:18] sister and make her well father add the
[47:21] blessings to your word tonight help me
[47:23] that I can be able to get out of the way
[47:25] speak to us those things which will be
[47:28] beneficial to us tonight in the name of
[47:30] the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints
[47:33] said amen amen God bless you you may be
[47:37] seated
[47:40] this is certainly a wonderful
[47:43] passage of scripture that we're looking
[47:45] forward to with all of our hearts to
[47:48] come to pass in our day
[47:51] marriage and betrothal and dispousal
[47:55] such a beautiful thing especially in the
[47:57] scripture with our Western Civilization
[48:00] we have so
[48:01] marred and changed it from what God
[48:05] intended for it to be but whenever it
[48:08] was actually this was written in the
[48:11] days of John it was still a carryover
[48:13] from the Old Testament and on up through
[48:15] the new to whether that an engagement
[48:18] was a very special saying betrayals all
[48:21] his spousal and it was a sacred thing to
[48:24] them they didn't just look at it as a
[48:26] girl running away from home trying to
[48:28] get away from her mom and dad they
[48:30] didn't look at it as a man and a woman
[48:32] meeting and them running out and doing
[48:34] whatever they wanted to that was not
[48:36] allowed they didn't do it that way as a
[48:39] matter of fact a girl could not just
[48:41] join together and run off of the boy and
[48:43] agree to be married it was not
[48:45] absolutely even lawful and they're that
[48:47] their day to do it but they looked at it
[48:49] as emerging of families emerging of
[48:52] goals emerging of objectives emerging
[48:55] many times it was for financial gain of
[48:58] course but many times it was not and we
[49:00] can send the days of Solomon how that
[49:02] Solomon did so he married one of the
[49:04] daughters of pharaoh married one of the
[49:06] daughters of different kingdoms and it
[49:08] was to establish his kingdom on the
[49:10] North side on the west side on the south
[49:12] side and there were political marriages
[49:14] then just have to have been down Through
[49:16] the Ages but for the Believers it was
[49:19] something that was very sacred and it
[49:21] was something that they really looked to
[49:23] and honor so for them to be able to
[49:25] write about the marriage of the lamb in
[49:28] the New Testament it took on a brand new
[49:31] view just from the Old Testament view of
[49:34] what they thought about it and you
[49:35] remember whenever Joseph had found out
[49:37] that Mary's was expecting with child and
[49:40] he was going to put her away but he did
[49:42] not want to do it in an open way but he
[49:45] was going to put her away privately lest
[49:47] it would bring shame upon her and the
[49:49] angel of the Lord had to appear to him
[49:51] and said fear not Joseph thou son of
[49:53] David to take into thee Mary thy wife
[49:55] for that which is conceived in her is of
[49:57] the Holy Ghost and He commands him to go
[49:59] ahead and take her and to be this Shield
[50:02] as it was for Mary and for the baby that
[50:06] was to come because the way they looked
[50:08] at it she had lived so unclean and his
[50:11] eyes and God had to supernaturally be
[50:13] able to Enlighten him and what had taken
[50:16] place so then John this was his
[50:18] background now the reason I say that is
[50:21] so that we might be able to understand
[50:23] it a little bit better because what
[50:25] marriage is today well it's certainly
[50:27] degraded to what it was them that a
[50:29] person would marry a pizza or a man
[50:31] would marry his hot rod or a woman would
[50:34] marry her cat I read not long ago where
[50:36] some rich multi-millionaire had given
[50:39] millions and millions of dollars to her
[50:41] dog so her dog lived in a castle her dog
[50:44] lived and and this great palace and it
[50:47] was absolutely phenomenal just looking
[50:48] at the pictures that I saw of it and the
[50:51] dog had servants and butlers and maids
[50:54] and so on and so on and so on I'm not
[50:56] sure exactly how that he told him what
[50:57] he wanted woof woof meant dog food wow
[51:00] wow meant cat food I'm not sure exactly
[51:02] how they worked all that out but I
[51:04] thought that person will stand before
[51:05] almighty God one day and not only be
[51:08] judged for a sinful life but also be
[51:11] judged for giving all that kind of money
[51:13] to an animal that don't even have a soul
[51:16] but that's where we are so people that
[51:20] have so degraded that a man would want
[51:22] to marry a man a woman to want to marry
[51:24] a woman or they'd want to marry they're
[51:25] not even sure what they are anymore
[51:26] they're just still trying to figure it
[51:28] out out I guess but so living in that
[51:31] age if we're not careful our very image
[51:34] of marriage will become tainted by the
[51:37] filth that is around us but keep in your
[51:40] mind marriage is the oldest institution
[51:43] in the world given to us by almighty God
[51:47] himself
[51:48] so when we look at marriage and we join
[51:51] together a young couple we do not look
[51:54] at it as the run-of-the-mill type of
[51:56] thing no to us it is still a sacred
[52:00] thing and then we go beyond that and
[52:03] then we look to this marriage now we've
[52:05] just closed down in Revelation chapter
[52:07] 18 and how the Harlot is judged and how
[52:11] that the great city of Rome has been
[52:13] destroyed and I find it still phenomenal
[52:15] that John would go from the destruction
[52:17] of Rome by an atomic bomb and then he
[52:21] tells the Heavens to rejoice as we
[52:23] looked at last Wednesday and then he
[52:25] jumps from that immediately the scene
[52:28] opens again and it opens with this
[52:31] salutation let us be glad and rejoice
[52:34] and give honor unto him for the marriage
[52:37] of the Lamb has come now the word there
[52:41] is a tricky word because some in reading
[52:44] this and they take the word gamos and
[52:47] they think that the bride God is not
[52:49] actually married until we reach the
[52:52] Heavenly setting and I used to think
[52:55] exactly the same thing but under the
[52:58] influence of the message of the hour you
[53:00] realize that God completely changes our
[53:04] view about when we are truly married now
[53:08] years and years ago whenever brother
[53:10] Branham would have preached this message
[53:12] entitled The Invisible Union of the
[53:14] bride of Christ no doubt a lot of the
[53:16] Pentecostals that were there which is
[53:18] where I got my previous View from they
[53:21] probably felt like that brother random
[53:23] was totally wrong by saying that the
[53:26] bride had already entered into an
[53:28] invisible Union right now so the many
[53:32] many people still to this day preach and
[53:35] promote that the wedding will take place
[53:38] in heaven but if you notice the way that
[53:41] John writes this and the word that he
[53:43] uses there's a key word to this verse
[53:46] which illuminates us that the the bride
[53:49] has actually already been wet now watch
[53:52] this let us be glad and rejoice and give
[53:54] honor to him for the marriage of the
[53:57] Lamb is come now the word that he uses
[54:00] there is gamos and it means a wedding or
[54:04] a marriage Festival so it's not actually
[54:07] a wedding ceremony but it is a wedding
[54:11] or a marriage Festival what is it it is
[54:15] the marriage supper of the Lamb so it is
[54:18] a Divine banquet that God has now spread
[54:22] forth for his people so John is not now
[54:26] saying let us be glad and rejoice
[54:28] because the lamb has now married his
[54:30] wife actually they were already married
[54:33] on the earth in an invisible Union of a
[54:37] marriage vow performed by the ministry
[54:40] of Malachi 4. you see it but through the
[54:43] uniting according to what the prophet
[54:45] told us and proving his word it was a
[54:48] uniting time that was going on by Christ
[54:52] the son of man coming down and this is
[54:55] why of course even many of the people
[54:56] around the message they still don't
[54:58] understand the significance of us
[55:00] preaching the message we've got an
[55:02] element of people that say they believe
[55:04] the message yet They Don't Preach the
[55:06] message they don't talk about the
[55:09] prophet they don't talk and preach from
[55:11] the message itself you'd be surprised at
[55:14] how many message churches do not welcome
[55:16] you as a preacher to read message quotes
[55:19] well let me just let you know where I
[55:21] stand if I cannot preach what the
[55:24] prophet said I wouldn't feel welcome in
[55:26] the first place
[55:27] now that may that may just stun some of
[55:30] you to think that there are so-called
[55:32] message people that don't want the
[55:34] message preached I don't understand that
[55:36] myself why in the world would God send a
[55:38] prophet with a message and then not want
[55:40] that message preached to the followers
[55:42] of the message it don't make a lot of
[55:45] sense to me I know I'm not very smart
[55:46] but I'm smarter than that you know Paul
[55:49] told Timothy whenever he wrote to him he
[55:52] said now be not ashamed of the Gospel
[55:54] nor be ashamed of me his prisoner I
[55:57] don't believe that Paul had wrote his
[55:59] word as his own opinion but I believe it
[56:01] was the word of God so what has happened
[56:04] to us I hope you understand that what is
[56:07] going on in this setting right now on
[56:09] this last day is that we are being
[56:12] united to Christ the lamb as the word is
[56:15] being preached so how is that happening
[56:18] as we hear him the word Christ being
[56:21] preached it severs us from the ties that
[56:25] we held formally you see that's why it's
[56:28] important that we let go of preconceived
[56:31] ideas of predestination and election and
[56:34] the calling of God and the difference
[56:36] between the bride and the church as we
[56:38] let go of this we are being united to
[56:42] what the new anointed word which is
[56:45] Christ himself we're not being anointed
[56:48] to a Dogma or to a Creed or well we're
[56:51] becoming brandomats no that's not what
[56:53] brother Branham wanted he did not want
[56:55] us to just go around quoting him and all
[56:58] belong to the Branham Tabernacle he
[57:00] wanted us to be so in love with the Lord
[57:03] Jesus and if this message does not make
[57:06] you love the Lord Jesus more than you
[57:08] have missed the meaning of this message
[57:11] in the first place well praise the Lord
[57:13] this God sent this Prophet that it would
[57:16] help us now look friend I know for many
[57:19] of you maybe it was the Miracles that
[57:21] you heard and brother Randomness
[57:22] Minister I realized there was an element
[57:24] of people in the message and they come
[57:25] from secular denominations and they were
[57:28] taught God was dead God didn't do any of
[57:30] that anymore and whenever you first
[57:32] heard about the Miracles that's what
[57:33] caught your attention it was not mine
[57:35] okay it was not mine that was not what
[57:38] caught my attention or hey or many of us
[57:40] that was in Pentecost I had already seen
[57:43] Miracles I had seen discernment I had
[57:46] seen wonders I'd seen the blinded eyes
[57:48] come open I saw a dead baby raised One
[57:51] Night in the service I've seen crossed
[57:53] eyes uncrossed miraculously by the power
[57:55] of God I saw one Miracle after another
[57:58] after another after another it was not
[58:01] the Miracles that caught my attention
[58:04] when I started hearing this message one
[58:06] of the greatest things was how we
[58:08] preached the Lord Jesus and by how he
[58:11] talked to the Lord Jesus he talked to
[58:14] him in a way that I had never heard
[58:16] anybody talk to him before how many
[58:18] knows what I'm talking about it's just
[58:20] the way he addressed him and the way
[58:22] that he set him for us and the way that
[58:24] he projected the personality of God in a
[58:28] way that I I just never comprehended it
[58:30] before and as I listened it began to
[58:33] change my view of the Lord Jesus just
[58:36] not the doctrine of serpent seed and the
[58:38] doctrine of election and the doctrine of
[58:40] predestination but it began to reshape
[58:43] the way I looked at almighty God and I
[58:47] hope you understand what I'm going to
[58:48] say I'm continuously as I feed on the
[58:52] message of the hour my view and my my
[58:55] perspective of the almighty is
[58:58] constantly being altered as I listen to
[59:01] more and more of the message Harry sent
[59:04] me a quote today in this quote brother
[59:06] Randolph said it would be a great thing
[59:08] if God would perfectly make him well if
[59:11] he was sick and God had performed a
[59:13] miracle but he said it would actually be
[59:16] greater if God would reveal to him about
[59:21] Divine Healing and he would take God's
[59:24] word and believe God's word and confess
[59:26] that word every every day and and God
[59:29] would be healing him every day and I
[59:31] thought isn't that amazing but most of
[59:33] us would probably believe the opposite
[59:36] of that
[59:37] we would believe that a miracle would be
[59:40] greater isn't it amazing how we can
[59:42] still believe things wrong but if you
[59:45] look at it from his perspective and what
[59:47] he was saying was that the lord loves
[59:50] when people will take his word and they
[59:52] will believe that word some days they
[59:54] may do good and the other days they may
[59:57] be brought in battle with the symptoms
[59:58] of what they're believing God for but
[1:00:00] they still believe God is their healer
[1:00:03] no matter how they feel
[1:00:05] but you realize an instantaneous Miracle
[1:00:07] it doesn't take a great prolonged faith
[1:00:10] it drops in your heart God does it right
[1:00:12] there and it's over but a person
[1:00:15] believing for Divine Healing it may be
[1:00:18] up and down and in and out they may be
[1:00:20] years of fighting that battle of Divine
[1:00:23] Healing but they don't give up they keep
[1:00:25] trusting God now when I hear something
[1:00:28] like that what that does it again Alters
[1:00:31] my perspective and my view of the
[1:00:34] almighty because I look and I think wow
[1:00:36] there's something about his character
[1:00:38] that he loves to hear his children take
[1:00:41] his word and they believe that word
[1:00:43] through thick and thin ups and downs in
[1:00:45] and out light and darkness whatever and
[1:00:48] that does something so much to his being
[1:00:50] toward them that it moves them and it
[1:00:53] helps me and it Alters my view then the
[1:00:57] more my view is altered about him the
[1:01:00] closer I can become to him you
[1:01:02] understand that those of you that's been
[1:01:04] married for 10 or 50 15 or 20 years
[1:01:06] however long it's been and if you and
[1:01:08] your wife are really true and joined
[1:01:10] together you know that the longer you're
[1:01:12] together the more you begin to think
[1:01:14] alike and the more that you'll begin to
[1:01:16] say things that are like one another
[1:01:17] some of y'all know in your head is that
[1:01:19] right well because it's the way that
[1:01:21] you're joined together and you begin to
[1:01:23] think a lot me and Carol do it
[1:01:24] absolutely all the time and say where
[1:01:26] you want to go we just said so and so I
[1:01:28] said that's exactly what I was thinking
[1:01:29] she said we need to do so and so I said
[1:01:31] I was going to tell you exactly the same
[1:01:33] thing so we've been together now for all
[1:01:35] of these years and the more we're
[1:01:37] together the more we understand one
[1:01:40] another now when you're married and
[1:01:41] you're young you think the most
[1:01:43] important thing is you getting your way
[1:01:45] and whenever you get into an argument of
[1:01:47] course now I'm preaching to these sorry
[1:01:48] Sinners that are streaming the service
[1:01:50] tonight but whenever you get into an
[1:01:52] argument you think well the most
[1:01:54] important things is you being able to
[1:01:56] have the life saved and you being able
[1:01:58] to say something that'll burn him up or
[1:02:00] burn her up and boy you think that's it
[1:02:03] you think you've already accomplished
[1:02:04] something but the longer you're married
[1:02:06] the more you realize that peace has much
[1:02:10] more value than proving that you're
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:13] well Hallelujah Tranquility in the home
[1:02:16] and peace and all of that it's a great
[1:02:18] thing so what are you doing you're
[1:02:20] learning what the real proper values are
[1:02:22] well the more we learn about our Lord
[1:02:25] and the more we learn about what he
[1:02:26] wants and what he dislikes well the more
[1:02:29] we're learning about his nature can't
[1:02:31] you see this is another reason why the
[1:02:33] food is Virgin the church cannot be
[1:02:35] married to him because they don't
[1:02:37] understand his personality first of all
[1:02:39] they divided him into three and made
[1:02:40] three Gods out of him and you certainly
[1:02:43] couldn't walk up and whenever you're
[1:02:44] going to walk up and think you're going
[1:02:45] to be married to three and John looked
[1:02:47] on the throne and only saw one you know
[1:02:49] you don't know who you're even marrying
[1:02:51] you don't know who your husband is you
[1:02:52] don't know anything about him so God
[1:02:55] begins to reveal himself and as he does
[1:02:57] as you would hang around a young boy or
[1:03:00] a young girl and you was around them
[1:03:01] more and more and you fall in love as we
[1:03:04] say and you begin to understand more of
[1:03:07] who they are and what they are well it's
[1:03:09] the same way with the word now here John
[1:03:11] is going to address this and he's says
[1:03:13] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:03:15] honor to him for the marriage or the
[1:03:18] marriage supper of the Lamb has come and
[1:03:21] his wife hath made herself ready so all
[1:03:24] of Heaven is given this this
[1:03:26] consultation to be able to rejoice and
[1:03:30] that they should be glad now I want you
[1:03:32] to notice that the bride is not invited
[1:03:35] to her own wedding so this is not
[1:03:38] directed to her but this is to another
[1:03:41] group of people this of course is one of
[1:03:43] the common errors that's been believed
[1:03:45] for many many years from the Old
[1:03:46] Testament but especially in the new
[1:03:48] whenever God began to project his grace
[1:03:51] and spread it over the entirety of the
[1:03:53] human race that people looked at the
[1:03:55] grace of God been given to the
[1:03:57] recipients on the earth and they looked
[1:03:59] at everybody as being exactly the same
[1:04:01] then that God does not have
[1:04:03] differentiation because of election and
[1:04:06] they think now truly as far as receiving
[1:04:08] salvation and Grace there's no rich ones
[1:04:10] Among Us no Smart Ones no dumb ones all
[1:04:13] that sort of thing but they failed to
[1:04:15] realize that God even under Grace has
[1:04:18] categories by which he reveals himself
[1:04:21] too and this is one of them tonight and
[1:04:24] that is the difference between the bride
[1:04:25] and the church so there will be guests
[1:04:28] that will be there that will no doubt be
[1:04:31] people of the Old Testament now remember
[1:04:33] in the new Earth there will also be the
[1:04:36] categories because God imperfection
[1:04:39] created these great Angelic hosts so
[1:04:42] there were cherubims there were
[1:04:43] seraphims there were zoons and he
[1:04:45] created ones which could fall once which
[1:04:47] could not fall he created some angels
[1:04:50] which had a beginning and some actually
[1:04:52] that rotated off of his being as we
[1:04:54] would say that were as Eternal as he
[1:04:56] himself was which is where you come from
[1:04:58] now because the work of God Is So
[1:05:01] Glorious he will actually unveil this by
[1:05:04] his own character again the more we
[1:05:07] learn about his character don't think
[1:05:09] I'm trying to complex him now and make
[1:05:11] it complicated for you but the more more
[1:05:13] you understand about him the more you
[1:05:15] can fall in love with him which is all
[1:05:18] this whole thing is all about
[1:05:20] now once it will be by his greatness and
[1:05:23] by his power and John said for the
[1:05:25] marriage of the Lamb is come now the
[1:05:28] church all of Heaven is now rejoicing
[1:05:31] because the bride has been resurrected
[1:05:34] up of course those have been that have
[1:05:36] been alive or changed those of our dead
[1:05:37] have been resurrected and the heavens is
[1:05:40] now starting to enter in what this is
[1:05:42] doing it's starting in the preview of
[1:05:45] the day of the Lord now the day of the
[1:05:47] Lord is a very common theme in the Old
[1:05:49] Testament prophesied by Isaiah
[1:05:51] prophesied by Obadiah prophesied by many
[1:05:53] of the prophets and we'll get into it a
[1:05:55] little later but they talked about a day
[1:05:57] that would come when the Lord would
[1:05:59] Usher it in but it comes strangely God
[1:06:02] ushers this day of the Lord in by wraths
[1:06:05] and judgment and destruction which of
[1:06:08] course was not in the dispensation of
[1:06:10] Grace now it was called of course and
[1:06:13] has been for two thousand years the day
[1:06:15] of man we are living in the day of man
[1:06:18] man's Wisdom men's technology man this
[1:06:21] man's religion man's government but this
[1:06:24] is not the day of the Lord the day of
[1:06:26] the Lord will be when the days of man
[1:06:29] have come to their end and the kingdoms
[1:06:32] of this world become the kingdoms of our
[1:06:34] Lord and of his Christ then it will
[1:06:37] usher in the day of the Lord now we're
[1:06:39] just a couple of verses away from the
[1:06:42] ushering end of the day of the Lord but
[1:06:43] the day of the Lord cannot come until
[1:06:46] the marriage situation is right in
[1:06:49] heaven so the bride is being anointed on
[1:06:52] the earth and they have been in every
[1:06:54] age since the gospel began 2000 years
[1:06:56] ago so the elect of God were United to
[1:06:59] Christ the word of their day by hearing
[1:07:02] the word now this is why the devil hates
[1:07:04] for you and I to hear the word and then
[1:07:06] become part of what we're hearing this
[1:07:09] is why thoughts of preachers this is why
[1:07:10] Fox the preachers themselves because he
[1:07:13] knows let the people along just let them
[1:07:15] stay home let them not go to church he
[1:07:18] knows they'll die the prophet tells them
[1:07:20] over and over again even people that got
[1:07:22] saved he said get you a home Church find
[1:07:25] you a Godly Pastor that'll preach you
[1:07:28] the truth he said you'll dry up and die
[1:07:31] if you don't do it well come on
[1:07:33] that's what he said he knows the value
[1:07:36] and the importance of it and as you hear
[1:07:38] you're corrected of course some Services
[1:07:40] you just feel his love all around you
[1:07:42] other services you know God cause
[1:07:44] controls it of course according to what
[1:07:47] we need and Satan knows that and Satan
[1:07:50] has done his very best for 2 000 years
[1:07:53] to break that Unity between Christ and
[1:07:56] his bride but he's failed to do so and
[1:07:59] he will fail to do so in this age as
[1:08:01] well so what is God now doing God is now
[1:08:05] calling for the Heavens to Rejoice
[1:08:07] because the bride is in heaven the
[1:08:09] marriage supper of the Lamb the table
[1:08:12] has been set and now the church has
[1:08:14] overcome now watch her Union was her
[1:08:18] glorious Lord is a reflection of his own
[1:08:21] Glory himself and gentleman on to say
[1:08:24] that his wife has made herself ready now
[1:08:26] she's joined together in an interrupted
[1:08:30] uninterrupted perfect union which was in
[1:08:34] God's mind before the foundation of the
[1:08:36] world from this point joining up in the
[1:08:39] rapture we will may never be separate
[1:08:41] again now let's look in verse 8 and to
[1:08:43] her was granted that she should be
[1:08:45] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:08:47] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:08:50] of saints watch in Revelation 3 4. now
[1:08:53] this symbolism of course is used in
[1:08:55] various places in the scripture thou
[1:08:58] Hast a few names even in Sardis which
[1:09:00] have not defiled their garments they
[1:09:03] shall walk with me in white for they are
[1:09:07] worthy now again the sardisian church
[1:09:09] Overcomers they are identified as being
[1:09:12] quote in white garments now what a
[1:09:14] contrast this is to the woman that we
[1:09:17] saw in Revelation 17 and to the same
[1:09:20] colors carried over into Revelation 18
[1:09:22] so it's called Scarlet which calls
[1:09:25] purple and we saw all them colors which
[1:09:27] identified on The Prostitute church but
[1:09:30] when John sees the bride in heaven he
[1:09:33] does not say Scarlet he does not see
[1:09:36] purple he does not identify her with
[1:09:38] gold or silver or even pearls but he
[1:09:42] identifies her by one color which is the
[1:09:45] original color now she's been brought
[1:09:48] back the color she's wearing proves her
[1:09:51] soul has come back to its original place
[1:09:54] she has now been restored to the
[1:09:56] original salt of God Remember When God
[1:09:58] Made made the first woman even brought
[1:10:01] her on the earth and she was God's
[1:10:03] perfect thought of what a woman ought to
[1:10:06] be
[1:10:07] And yet when God brought her into
[1:10:09] existence of the earth she actually
[1:10:12] never materialized into that perfect
[1:10:15] thought because had she been that
[1:10:17] perfect thought she would have never
[1:10:18] fallen from that thought but she
[1:10:21] manifested only partially of what God
[1:10:23] wanted her to be she was beautiful of
[1:10:26] course in that state and she loved her
[1:10:28] husband and everything was fine so what
[1:10:30] happened then to that thought God can
[1:10:33] never lose a thought and God can never
[1:10:35] have a new thought so what happened to
[1:10:38] that thought that God had this perfect
[1:10:40] thought about what a woman would be well
[1:10:43] if he had that thought there's got to be
[1:10:45] someone or may I say many someone's who
[1:10:49] will manifest I thought what was that
[1:10:51] thought a woman that would love her
[1:10:53] husband a woman that would be subject to
[1:10:55] the word a woman that would never die a
[1:10:58] woman that would have eternal life this
[1:11:00] was all what made up God's thought of a
[1:11:03] perfect woman and yet Eve was never able
[1:11:05] to fully manifest that perfect thought
[1:11:08] what happened to that thought well I
[1:11:10] believe it's sort of like the thought of
[1:11:12] Isaiah 7 14 when the prophet said that
[1:11:14] the prophet Isaiah spoke it and it's
[1:11:16] like it circled the Earth circle the
[1:11:19] Earth waiting for the time and the
[1:11:21] season by which one would be able to
[1:11:23] catch that word and a virgin was on the
[1:11:25] earth and it went into her womb and she
[1:11:28] called that and manifested that so where
[1:11:30] is God's perfect thought of a woman I
[1:11:33] believe it has been circling as we'd say
[1:11:34] the Earth may be again and the cycle of
[1:11:37] Eternity God waiting for a perfect woman
[1:11:40] who is it this woman here in Revelation
[1:11:42] 19. she will stand before him as that
[1:11:46] perfect thought of a woman she was
[1:11:49] tested she was try she was born lost she
[1:11:52] was born unregenerated she was born
[1:11:54] horrible she was born and come to the
[1:11:57] Earth and then after she was here for
[1:12:00] some for 15 16 years they started
[1:12:02] becoming defiled by humanity and they
[1:12:05] were scarred with all types of things
[1:12:06] and seemed like but they would have
[1:12:08] never been able to amount to anything
[1:12:10] and yet the mercy of God reached down
[1:12:12] through him and brought him through all
[1:12:14] of that trauma all of their past all of
[1:12:16] the things that they'd been through able
[1:12:18] to wash them by the water of the word
[1:12:20] and be able to present them to the Lamb
[1:12:23] of God as they walk into that
[1:12:25] manifestation of a perfect thought of a
[1:12:28] woman oh my don't you want to be that
[1:12:31] before God
[1:12:32] now Paul says then that whenever himself
[1:12:36] was liking that notice John talks about
[1:12:38] this group here in Revelation 3. so the
[1:12:42] bridal attire I'm sure your sisters I've
[1:12:44] noticed this before in reading them that
[1:12:46] in the newspapers whenever they would
[1:12:48] put it in there about John domain you
[1:12:51] know Mary whoever her name was and she
[1:12:52] become married though and one of the
[1:12:54] things that they will emphasize in that
[1:12:57] is what what the bride wore isn't it
[1:13:00] amazing that they very rarely mentioned
[1:13:03] that the that the bridegroom had on a
[1:13:05] black tux well done most of them so they
[1:13:07] have on the black tux and they had you
[1:13:08] know this cumberbund on and and the
[1:13:10] preacher had on these black cufflinks
[1:13:12] and they they you know they don't even
[1:13:14] go that way but what did they describe
[1:13:16] the bride the bride had on this dress
[1:13:19] and this lace and you sisters know more
[1:13:21] about that me than I would so they had
[1:13:23] the bride wore this and the bride wore
[1:13:25] that well look John saying true to form
[1:13:28] that John now that the wedding has been
[1:13:31] consummated and they've come in and
[1:13:32] they've have had this time so John
[1:13:34] begins to describe the bride's attire
[1:13:37] now he does not start at the top of this
[1:13:41] beautiful Tiara and start coming down
[1:13:43] you know it says this type of lace and
[1:13:45] this and that and the other but he sums
[1:13:47] up the whole thing and this beautiful
[1:13:49] portrayal of the original color of why
[1:13:52] so alter the scripture this has
[1:13:55] identified this way and this to the
[1:13:57] bride I love the way John writes for he
[1:13:59] says it was given to her or granted it
[1:14:03] was granted unto her and the same word
[1:14:04] thy means given and I love the way Paul
[1:14:07] says this in Philippians 3 9 being in
[1:14:10] found in him not having mine own
[1:14:13] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:14:16] that which is through the face of Christ
[1:14:18] the righteousness which is of god by
[1:14:22] faith now see as a True Believer when we
[1:14:25] obey God's word then the very
[1:14:27] righteousness of God is attributed to us
[1:14:31] as it was to Abra Abraham of the Old
[1:14:34] Testament so Abraham believed God and
[1:14:36] God imputed it unto him for
[1:14:39] righteousness now the blood in the Old
[1:14:41] Testament could not be countered as
[1:14:43] righteousness but what was his face
[1:14:46] his faith now I hope you don't
[1:14:48] misunderstand me one day when we walk
[1:14:52] into that Heavenly realm we will no
[1:14:55] longer need faith
[1:14:58] we will no longer need the blood of the
[1:15:03] Lord Jesus
[1:15:05] we will no longer need a veil between us
[1:15:10] and God we will no longer listen
[1:15:13] carefully we will no longer need prayer
[1:15:18] we will no longer need preachers
[1:15:23] but God will save some I'm sure as the
[1:15:25] world
[1:15:26] we will no longer need people confessing
[1:15:29] the word thy strap some Hill buy Stripes
[1:15:32] I'm delivered there'll be no confessing
[1:15:34] going on in heaven there'll be nobody
[1:15:37] that'll ever need a prayer line no
[1:15:39] preachers will ever stand up and take a
[1:15:41] text now tonight I'd like to preach on
[1:15:43] there won't be none of that there nobody
[1:15:45] will have to believe God by faith
[1:15:48] because faith will be transformed into
[1:15:51] sight
[1:15:54] listen so faith will be transformed into
[1:15:57] sight and the Very person of God will be
[1:16:01] manifested in his human Temple setting
[1:16:04] on the throne of God and the father will
[1:16:06] be this great excellent Glory that is
[1:16:09] the emanating from that that human body
[1:16:11] that will be the father of God so this
[1:16:14] is what we will come up and approach
[1:16:15] this is what we will touch it will be
[1:16:18] God's human Temple and there will be no
[1:16:21] need of these things that we have now
[1:16:23] because we would have reached that state
[1:16:26] of perfection all hasten the day Lord
[1:16:28] Jesus notice this so the double nature
[1:16:31] of this process it was given to her by
[1:16:35] the power of God but then she takes what
[1:16:38] God gave her and she translates that
[1:16:41] into a life that is lived every day by
[1:16:44] the word and that's why we quote the
[1:16:45] prophet in the church church age book
[1:16:47] saying that a life lived by the word is
[1:16:51] the word express but if a person tried
[1:16:54] to live it without the attribute of
[1:16:56] righteousness being in them what are
[1:16:58] that that is just filthy rags so a
[1:17:00] person could stop cutting their hair say
[1:17:02] it's a woman and men could stop wearing
[1:17:05] um you know whatever it is that would be
[1:17:06] worldly and they could stop drinking and
[1:17:08] stop smoking many people can do that
[1:17:10] whenever the doctor gives them a bad
[1:17:12] report said if you don't quit smoking
[1:17:13] it's going to kill him they'll say all
[1:17:15] right I'm quitting but if you're not
[1:17:17] born again that's still not
[1:17:19] righteousness so we would look and would
[1:17:21] see our sisters with dresses on and with
[1:17:23] long hair and we don't see no makeup on
[1:17:25] them and all that sort of thing and we
[1:17:27] said well praise the Lord that's
[1:17:28] righteousness all only if it's
[1:17:31] righteousness from the soul and working
[1:17:33] out on their manifestation in their body
[1:17:36] now if it's just on the outside they are
[1:17:39] no more than Amish Mennonite Hutterites
[1:17:43] right because it's not actually
[1:17:45] righteousness from the inside out
[1:17:47] they're just being made to do that until
[1:17:49] they reach the age of 18 and then
[1:17:52] they're going to do what they want to do
[1:17:53] but if it's revealed to them then by the
[1:17:57] spirit of God they put this on and they
[1:18:00] are being clothed now do you understand
[1:18:01] what you're doing every day when you
[1:18:03] live right you do right you talk right
[1:18:05] you don't cheat you don't lie and you
[1:18:07] live a Godly life you understand that
[1:18:08] you are already putting on the garments
[1:18:11] of righteousness in this world and the
[1:18:14] body change will only be a further
[1:18:16] advancement of what you're already
[1:18:18] wearing right here tonight how many is
[1:18:21] live right today how many is water today
[1:18:23] how many is done right oh sure you've
[1:18:25] made your mistakes and all that so what
[1:18:27] have you done you have put on the
[1:18:29] righteousness of God and then you let
[1:18:32] that righteousness of God manifest
[1:18:33] itself in your daily works this very day
[1:18:36] here we are on Wednesday night so it's
[1:18:39] been a few days since you've had service
[1:18:40] and brother Andrew preached that great
[1:18:41] sermon for us so try Hope by the grace
[1:18:44] of God that on Monday morning Tuesday
[1:18:46] morning Wednesday morning I'm starting
[1:18:48] tomorrow again you'll resume that same
[1:18:50] thing what will you do you'll act like a
[1:18:53] Christian talk like a Christian live
[1:18:54] like a Christian why you are a Christian
[1:18:57] so it ain't something that you put on on
[1:19:00] Wednesday night like you put on a suit
[1:19:01] man you know here you go y'all wouldn't
[1:19:03] want me to come to church the way I was
[1:19:05] dressed this morning about 6 30. I'm
[1:19:07] going over to the church and putting on
[1:19:08] some stain and some sealer and this and
[1:19:10] that I got an old pair of blue jeans
[1:19:12] that had stain here had a black mark
[1:19:14] over there and a hat on dirty shoes and
[1:19:16] had on an old shirt that had staying
[1:19:18] here and there if I would have walked
[1:19:20] out of there tonight you'd looked at me
[1:19:21] and say what in the world's wrong my
[1:19:22] brother Donnie well them clothes are
[1:19:24] very appropriate for staining and all
[1:19:26] that sort of thing but you know I really
[1:19:28] wouldn't want to preach in them so it's
[1:19:30] the same way whenever we become
[1:19:32] converted and changed that we take off
[1:19:34] the worldly garments that we're born in
[1:19:37] and we put on a robe of righteousness by
[1:19:39] the new birth and then we start acting
[1:19:42] different we start talking talking
[1:19:43] different Heaven is only the
[1:19:45] consummation of that work which has
[1:19:48] already started in us and on display
[1:19:50] right now
[1:19:52] you know I've got a strange religion I
[1:19:54] take it with me on vacation
[1:19:56] I've got a strange religion I'll still
[1:19:58] live right on Monday I've got a strange
[1:20:00] religion I believe it ought to be 365
[1:20:02] days a year I know yeah on that 366 on
[1:20:05] leap year I think y'all to live right
[1:20:07] when you're by yourself when you're with
[1:20:09] your family when your wife's present
[1:20:10] when your wife ain't present I think
[1:20:12] y'all to live right why because David
[1:20:14] said I put him ever before me and if you
[1:20:17] realize you're in his present it'll keep
[1:20:19] you off of websites you shouldn't look
[1:20:20] at it'll keep you from saying things you
[1:20:22] shouldn't say well I wish somebody
[1:20:24] preached with me tonight it'll keep you
[1:20:26] from doing things you shouldn't do
[1:20:27] because it's already on display by the
[1:20:30] grace of God
[1:20:31] whoo wow wasn't that good thank you Lord
[1:20:35] now watch this in Revelation 19 9 and
[1:20:37] you say us unto me right
[1:20:40] wow so here comes this voice
[1:20:45] and it's like he interrupts John's on a
[1:20:48] roll
[1:20:49] and now he wants him to take special
[1:20:52] heed to this
[1:20:53] right
[1:20:55] blessed are they
[1:20:57] which are called
[1:20:59] unto the marriage supper
[1:21:02] of the Lamb
[1:21:04] now this is not necessarily the bride
[1:21:08] because the bride's not invited to her
[1:21:10] own wedding
[1:21:13] she's not invited to her own reception
[1:21:16] she's already been invited
[1:21:19] so this will be guest
[1:21:22] Old Testament
[1:21:24] New Testament however God will merge
[1:21:27] them all together
[1:21:29] and he says they're even blessed just to
[1:21:32] be at the reception
[1:21:34] well if they're blessed to sit at the
[1:21:36] table can you imagine how blessed you're
[1:21:39] going to be when you're going to be the
[1:21:40] one that's being honored
[1:21:42] notice blessed are they which are called
[1:21:45] unto the marriage supper of the land now
[1:21:48] the angel who is commanding John to do
[1:21:50] this actually commands him to record
[1:21:53] this beatitude of remember the
[1:21:56] Beatitudes of course of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:58] when he gave them that in the Book of
[1:21:59] Matthew but there's many more also down
[1:22:01] through the scripture and this is some
[1:22:03] of the last ones so he identifies this
[1:22:05] as another beatitude of those that are
[1:22:08] blessed they're just invited to be able
[1:22:11] to be there but of course they have a
[1:22:13] Heavenly invitation so one of the things
[1:22:15] that has plagued the church as I said
[1:22:18] coming down to the ages has been people
[1:22:20] not being able to recognize and this is
[1:22:23] why there's been such a differentiation
[1:22:24] in between people who believe that the
[1:22:27] church would go through tribulation
[1:22:28] which I used to believe and then others
[1:22:30] say no no no the church can't go through
[1:22:32] the tribulation ain't no way that goes
[1:22:34] through a tribulation and there's still
[1:22:35] that great debate today so they take
[1:22:38] their scriptures and preach there will
[1:22:40] be a post-tribulation others a
[1:22:42] pre-tribulation and they provide back
[1:22:44] and forth back and forth and the mystery
[1:22:46] and the answer is not who's got the most
[1:22:48] scriptures on their side but the answer
[1:22:51] is finding out there's a difference in
[1:22:54] the class of peoples either under the
[1:22:56] dispensation of Grace
[1:22:58] now notice these are blessed that are
[1:23:02] invited to the marriage supper but these
[1:23:05] folks aren't actually the bride
[1:23:07] well praise the Lord now you see those
[1:23:10] are distinguished down through time it
[1:23:13] was a lot and an Abraham a Jacob and an
[1:23:16] Esau from the Old Testament we can say
[1:23:18] it as it converges right on up to the
[1:23:19] New Testament we see a gamalia we see
[1:23:22] people that help the people of God and
[1:23:24] they love the Lord we see a King Herod
[1:23:27] Who Loved John the Baptist absolutely
[1:23:30] loved John the Baptist but he could
[1:23:32] never obey what John the Baptist said
[1:23:34] and yet this man risked his own
[1:23:36] reputation because of his love and honor
[1:23:39] for John even made his old Jezebel wife
[1:23:41] mad about it because he loved the
[1:23:43] prophet but it ain't enough to love the
[1:23:45] prophet if you really love him right
[1:23:47] you'll do what he said do
[1:23:49] so you see it's a perfect type of those
[1:23:51] who just love the prophet and there's no
[1:23:54] way that he would have ever allowed John
[1:23:56] the Baptist to be killed if they had not
[1:23:58] have tricked him into it you remember
[1:23:59] the story and he loved John so much and
[1:24:02] had so much respect for him so just
[1:24:04] because people around the message loved
[1:24:06] the prophet don't mean that their bride
[1:24:09] well go ahead and preach brother Donnie
[1:24:10] I knew Pentecostal people I try to come
[1:24:13] to the message and started hearing about
[1:24:15] the message and I used to work for a
[1:24:17] certain preacher and I did his radio
[1:24:19] broadcast and I remember setting and His
[1:24:21] Radio broadcast room and there was a
[1:24:23] desk and a chair there and a microphone
[1:24:25] and I would do the intro and the outro
[1:24:27] of his broadcast and I would come in and
[1:24:29] I would say this is such and such and so
[1:24:31] and so and we're now going to introduce
[1:24:33] you into the man of God as he's going to
[1:24:35] preach so I would do that and preach
[1:24:37] about or let him preach about 12 13
[1:24:39] minutes something like that and then I
[1:24:41] would do the outro and I'd say now we're
[1:24:42] going to be here and here and here and
[1:24:44] here well one day as I was sitting there
[1:24:46] and I was listening for the sermon you
[1:24:48] know and he was he was preaching and I
[1:24:50] happen to reach up here right above my
[1:24:52] head
[1:24:53] and there were some books
[1:24:56] well for whatever reason I'd never
[1:24:58] looked at them books before
[1:25:00] but I as I pulled one of those books off
[1:25:03] of the shelf and I opened it up ah to my
[1:25:06] great surprise
[1:25:08] guess who that book was William Marion
[1:25:11] Brenham
[1:25:13] oh my the theme song of this man was he
[1:25:16] was more than a man
[1:25:18] and that was his main sermon Jesus is
[1:25:21] more than a man my I've set behind him
[1:25:23] many a time you can find it on on
[1:25:25] YouTube if you'd like to look at it I'm
[1:25:27] so there's a young fella and he was oh
[1:25:30] Jesus as a man stepped to the bow of the
[1:25:32] ship and he spoke to the wind Jesus as a
[1:25:35] man woke up and rubbed the sleep out of
[1:25:37] his eye or I've screamed before
[1:25:39] thousands of people as he would preach
[1:25:41] this oh my God hollered and jumped and
[1:25:43] run little did I know he got that from a
[1:25:46] little Prophet oh yeah how many have
[1:25:50] went and pulled from The Prophet's words
[1:25:52] I used to remember a certain other
[1:25:55] preacher from down in Yeager West
[1:25:56] Virginia and I heard him preach on Ruth
[1:25:59] and about Ruth's believing in all the
[1:26:02] four states there's nothing where in the
[1:26:04] world did he get that at and I knew
[1:26:06] another man they lived pretty close to
[1:26:08] where we were for her and now we're
[1:26:09] raised born and raised and I'd hear him
[1:26:11] preach and I would watch him he said
[1:26:13] pray for people and I'd watch him and
[1:26:15] said weak and staggering that you know
[1:26:17] lead him off the platform saying well
[1:26:18] man where in the world but if I found
[1:26:20] what was amazing was when I come to the
[1:26:22] message I found a lot of the stuff they
[1:26:25] was doing and saying come inside of the
[1:26:27] from there and and then I found out once
[1:26:30] they found out I knew where it come from
[1:26:32] they didn't want me to find it out so
[1:26:35] what did they do they separated
[1:26:36] themselves from me because they knew I'd
[1:26:38] tell
[1:26:39] they knew I'd tell they was not getting
[1:26:42] that on their own I'm not ashamed to
[1:26:44] tell you tonight A lot of the stuff I
[1:26:47] preached to you it ain't original it
[1:26:49] don't come to me first it comes through
[1:26:51] the channel of Malachi 4. and if you got
[1:26:55] a problem with that you got a problem
[1:26:56] with God
[1:27:00] oh praise the Lord you see God has this
[1:27:04] program and you know I love the way
[1:27:06] brother random says it in spoken words
[1:27:08] Original Seed you can only serve God on
[1:27:11] Earth as God's servants sin on the earth
[1:27:14] interpret God's word to you so you can
[1:27:18] see why Satan wants to break that Divine
[1:27:20] protocol of the way God does it he's
[1:27:23] always done it this way and he will
[1:27:25] continue to do so to the end time so we
[1:27:28] know there's an element of people
[1:27:29] that'll never hear this message and
[1:27:31] there's an element of people that will
[1:27:32] hear it and they will follow along
[1:27:34] remember in the very type whenever
[1:27:36] Eliezer was sent to get Rebecca and he
[1:27:38] brought Rebecca out and the Bible also
[1:27:40] says Rebecca followed the man but her
[1:27:43] maidens also followed along right with
[1:27:45] her here goes Ali is there telling her
[1:27:48] all the things about her husband to be
[1:27:50] telling her what he looks like what kind
[1:27:52] of man he is how much riches and wealth
[1:27:54] and so on and so on that he has and
[1:27:56] those maidens are falling right along
[1:27:58] here in the messenger talk to message
[1:28:01] but did them maintenance jump off of the
[1:28:03] camel and go into the tent to be married
[1:28:05] to Isaac they did not are there foolish
[1:28:08] virgins around this message they are are
[1:28:10] there foolish virgins out here in the
[1:28:12] world they are but brother Donnie well
[1:28:14] they all fit I don't have an idea and
[1:28:16] you don't either but I'm so glad
[1:28:18] almighty God knows where everybody fits
[1:28:21] and there will be people that will be in
[1:28:24] heaven that more than likely will shock
[1:28:26] us to death when we look around and say
[1:28:28] you've got to be kidding you made it and
[1:28:31] you know well you got to be king you
[1:28:33] made it and then you look in the mirror
[1:28:34] and say glory to God you mean I made it
[1:28:36] mother Grace said God I thought oh some
[1:28:40] of you I know you're so conceited to
[1:28:41] yourself ain't no question you're mine
[1:28:43] you're going well the rest of us knows
[1:28:44] it'll be the grace of God if we get
[1:28:46] there I'm just telling you tonight it'll
[1:28:48] be the grace of God if I make it but I'm
[1:28:50] going to make it because I love grace
[1:28:52] and grace has been applied to my life so
[1:28:55] God is now beckoning and he's opening up
[1:28:57] even right here to show us there's a
[1:29:00] difference between the bride and the
[1:29:02] guest so in the New Testament the whole
[1:29:05] program of God will set forth in such a
[1:29:07] way as well as the Old Testament so here
[1:29:09] it's not so much the question of
[1:29:11] difference of salvation but it's the
[1:29:13] difference of positioning in the body
[1:29:15] just like God calls in evangelist a
[1:29:18] pastor or a teacher and all of God's
[1:29:20] gifts are so different we know that they
[1:29:21] can hear Brother Darryl preach is
[1:29:23] different than brother Andrew but the
[1:29:24] Andrew preaches and other men and each
[1:29:26] one has to find the way God has made
[1:29:28] them and if they know who they are and
[1:29:30] they find in that then there should be
[1:29:32] no jealousy Among Us
[1:29:34] same way with singers same as the
[1:29:36] musicians and everything else and the
[1:29:38] program of God is exactly the same way I
[1:29:41] want you to notice now John goes from
[1:29:43] verse 9.
[1:29:46] to verse 10.
[1:29:48] and I fell at his feet
[1:29:53] to worship Him
[1:29:57] wow
[1:30:01] so John sees the church he sees the
[1:30:05] he sees the atomic bomb
[1:30:07] he sees the wedding supper
[1:30:10] and John is so overwhelmed
[1:30:14] that he falls before this being
[1:30:18] to worship Him
[1:30:22] wow y'all ain't been this quiet now
[1:30:24] since I don't know how
[1:30:27] now John is overwhelmed now remember
[1:30:30] John has not changed John's not in a
[1:30:33] word body yet this is a vision
[1:30:36] so in the vision it shows how that the
[1:30:40] recipient of the vision can be wrong
[1:30:43] I hope this don't stagger you but
[1:30:46] this being was not an angel
[1:30:49] with wings on his back
[1:30:52] it was a redeemed
[1:30:55] human being
[1:30:58] foreign
[1:31:06] now listen John said I fell at his feet
[1:31:10] to worship Him
[1:31:12] and he
[1:31:13] said unto me
[1:31:16] see thou do it not
[1:31:19] I am thy fellow servant
[1:31:21] and of thy Brethren now an angel could
[1:31:25] not say this this is not an angel a
[1:31:28] cherubim a seraphim a zoom this is a
[1:31:32] redeemed
[1:31:33] human being do you understand that it
[1:31:35] was a redeemed human being that showed
[1:31:38] John the entire Book of Revelation
[1:31:42] oh come on children that's a quote from
[1:31:43] the message huh
[1:31:45] now look he is so overwhelmed by being
[1:31:49] in this Vision ma the man has seen all
[1:31:51] of these great things and I mean who
[1:31:53] knows what it was but let me just clue
[1:31:55] you in this happened twice
[1:31:59] John does it here and he gets so
[1:32:02] overwhelmed again he does it again in
[1:32:04] Revelation 22.
[1:32:09] I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:32:12] Brethren that have the testimony
[1:32:15] of Jesus
[1:32:18] so this was not an Old Testament Prophet
[1:32:21] then
[1:32:24] it was a new testament one
[1:32:28] now listen what he says it gives him a
[1:32:30] great Revelation here
[1:32:32] for the testimony of Jesus
[1:32:35] is the spirit
[1:32:37] of Prophecy
[1:32:41] now this angel
[1:32:43] man which was guiding him
[1:32:47] and revealing these great things
[1:32:51] John is so overwhelmed not just by the
[1:32:55] personage of this man but all that he's
[1:32:58] seen he's just he's just beside himself
[1:33:02] look at me again in revelation 22 8. and
[1:33:04] now John saw these things and heard them
[1:33:07] and when I heard and seen
[1:33:09] I fell down to worship before the feet
[1:33:12] of the angel
[1:33:14] which showed me these things didn't say
[1:33:16] anything unto me see thou doeth not I
[1:33:18] mean here the man is doing it again
[1:33:24] well praise the Lord
[1:33:28] you say how us human beings are
[1:33:31] and you think you don't need Grace after
[1:33:32] you got Grace
[1:33:35] this man needed the mercy of God look
[1:33:37] what he has done he has just fell down
[1:33:39] and worshiped an angel
[1:33:42] a man a messenger that has been redeemed
[1:33:46] but there must have been such Shekinah
[1:33:49] and so much of the glory of God coming
[1:33:51] here he was just overwhelmed he's just
[1:33:53] so overwhelmed and he just gets beside
[1:33:56] himself just beside himself in the
[1:33:59] vision and he just falls down
[1:34:01] to worship this being
[1:34:06] now notice again it happens again I fell
[1:34:08] down to worship before the feet of the
[1:34:10] Angel which showed me these things now
[1:34:13] during this whole Revelation on this
[1:34:15] isle of Patmos it's been this Angel this
[1:34:20] redeemed
[1:34:21] being
[1:34:25] then saith he unto me see thou do it not
[1:34:29] for I am thou fellow servant and of thy
[1:34:33] brethren
[1:34:34] the prophets
[1:34:37] so now he gives a little further
[1:34:39] identity of who he is
[1:34:41] he was a new testament
[1:34:43] redeemed
[1:34:45] prophet
[1:34:48] and of them which keep the sayings of
[1:34:51] this book
[1:34:52] worship God
[1:34:59] well I hope you and I maybe
[1:35:03] could be a little bit more merciful
[1:35:07] when people who were overwhelmed in the
[1:35:11] presence of God or maybe in the presence
[1:35:14] of one of his Prophet Messengers
[1:35:17] and they would begin to sink in their
[1:35:19] mind
[1:35:21] it's the Lord Jesus
[1:35:24] this might help us to be a little bit
[1:35:26] more understanding
[1:35:30] now I always for whatever reason I get
[1:35:33] attacked by a lot of these folks that
[1:35:35] don't believe the message no more and
[1:35:37] they like to have my email address and
[1:35:39] share it and to be able to attack me you
[1:35:42] know in one email after another after
[1:35:44] another and tell us how wrong we are and
[1:35:46] on and on and on with our garbage so one
[1:35:48] way that I I like to answer them back is
[1:35:51] I'll tell you what when your wife
[1:35:54] your children and the people you work
[1:35:57] with mistake you for the Lord Jesus I'll
[1:36:01] fly you down to the Tri-Cities airport
[1:36:03] and then we'll sit and talk
[1:36:06] but until they do I'm going to keep
[1:36:09] following this man that they did
[1:36:12] well praise the Lord now some of you
[1:36:14] that want to dissect a message and say
[1:36:16] well this is Brother Ram's opinion
[1:36:18] that's brother Ram's opinion you want to
[1:36:20] the things you don't believe that's the
[1:36:21] way you want to get out of of obeying it
[1:36:23] I'll I'll tell you exactly the same
[1:36:25] thing uh for as any of your sons ever
[1:36:28] thought you was the Lord Jesus
[1:36:31] what about some of the people you go to
[1:36:33] church with
[1:36:35] what about your life
[1:36:38] all I see she might think you might be
[1:36:40] that other guy
[1:36:46] so she don't see the pillar of fire over
[1:36:48] your head it's horns
[1:36:53] now you know humans
[1:36:57] can I say I understand this no I I can't
[1:37:01] I've never seen this
[1:37:03] out of any man okay
[1:37:06] I I wasn't around brother random never
[1:37:08] got to be there never got the scene of
[1:37:09] the meetings I've been around Servants
[1:37:11] of God yes my whole life I've been
[1:37:14] around men of God that I've seen the
[1:37:15] anointing on them and and I was afraid
[1:37:18] because you could fear that feel that
[1:37:21] awesome thing and it it produced this
[1:37:23] austure fear doesn't it brother just
[1:37:26] being around being with around Servants
[1:37:28] of God watched them so anointed by the
[1:37:31] presence of the Lord and it makes that
[1:37:33] but if I ever felt this I haven't
[1:37:36] so it's hard for me to relate to John
[1:37:39] doing this now I could of course like
[1:37:41] you take the theological aside say John
[1:37:44] you ought to know better than that you
[1:37:46] look at here John I'll tell you one
[1:37:47] thing you should have known that was an
[1:37:48] angel you don't seem the Lord Jesus how
[1:37:51] in the world but you see I'm a man
[1:37:53] speaking without this type of experience
[1:37:56] so I don't know exactly what all John
[1:37:59] had succumbed to being in this
[1:38:01] atmosphere and being in this presence so
[1:38:05] whenever I hear the prophet tell us in
[1:38:08] Revelation chapter 5 part 2 I think it
[1:38:10] is that he says there's a dozen or more
[1:38:13] people sitting here in this building
[1:38:15] today that thought I was Jesus Christ
[1:38:20] now you and I might hear that quote or
[1:38:22] read it and we'd say well a bunch of
[1:38:24] knot heads what in the world is the
[1:38:26] matter with sin and there again you and
[1:38:28] I was not in that aura of that presence
[1:38:31] now I've talked to people who were and
[1:38:33] they talked about how powerful that it
[1:38:35] was and how moving that it was oh my and
[1:38:39] how that that Prophet won't even break
[1:38:40] into that realm tell you your very
[1:38:42] thoughts the very things you had prayed
[1:38:44] about tell you this and that and the
[1:38:46] other and you think it must have been an
[1:38:48] awesome thing to experience but now John
[1:38:51] is carried up in the realm of vision so
[1:38:55] it's not standing at a store and I asked
[1:38:57] brother Charlie Cox one time I said
[1:38:58] brother Charlie how how was it being
[1:39:00] around brother Bradham how was he said
[1:39:02] whatever they don't even you know you've
[1:39:03] been around brother random and he said
[1:39:05] we never pulled on him we never tried to
[1:39:07] pull him into explaining this and asking
[1:39:10] him all kinds of questions and he said
[1:39:12] we just let him talk he said that he
[1:39:15] would always go to the word and he
[1:39:17] brother Charlie Drew drove out a little
[1:39:19] box and and it was writings of brother
[1:39:22] Branham and it was all types of drawings
[1:39:24] of this and that and the other and he
[1:39:26] said don't ever they'd get done eating
[1:39:27] supper at night that brother random
[1:39:29] would get a piece of paper and he'd sit
[1:39:30] there and draw the rainbow and draw this
[1:39:33] and that and the other brothers Jordan
[1:39:34] still had him as a matter of fact he had
[1:39:36] a squirrel that they had shot in 1958
[1:39:40] put in a carton a milk jug and it was
[1:39:43] froze in the freezer and it was still
[1:39:45] there and he pulled it out and showed it
[1:39:46] to me the squirrels which was created by
[1:39:49] the spoken word they were created that
[1:39:51] morning they skin them that evening and
[1:39:54] ate them for supper
[1:39:55] so I said well how how was it when the
[1:39:58] people got around it he said we'd walk
[1:40:00] in them Country Stores brother Raymond
[1:40:02] have blood on his clothes his beard
[1:40:04] would be growed out and he just talked
[1:40:06] to them guys and ask them about their
[1:40:08] crops and if there's a if there's a car
[1:40:10] salesman they'd ask him about that he
[1:40:12] never told him his Malachi 4 never told
[1:40:14] him he was Elijah but they always knew
[1:40:17] there was something random because he
[1:40:18] said could you always sense that
[1:40:20] presence of being around him now this
[1:40:22] was a man that was honey can you imagine
[1:40:24] now John being carried out into the
[1:40:26] heavens and he saw this glorified person
[1:40:29] I hope you understand what I'm fixing to
[1:40:30] say one day the angels of God
[1:40:34] one day the foolish virgin which come up
[1:40:36] through the final stage of their
[1:40:38] Redemption they will stand there in this
[1:40:41] all of you
[1:40:43] I know it's hard for you to view
[1:40:46] yourself in this way but what I see
[1:40:48] Harry when I look at this human being I
[1:40:52] see a human being that was prefigured in
[1:40:56] the body change a human being which had
[1:40:59] entered into that Final Phase of God's
[1:41:02] glory and it was of such high esteem and
[1:41:05] such Glory that a prophet like John a
[1:41:09] prophet of John's caliber since this
[1:41:12] Effigy Of The Glory of God emanating
[1:41:15] from this person and it was so close to
[1:41:18] God himself I hope you understand me
[1:41:20] what happened to this redeemed human
[1:41:23] being he had entered into this stage of
[1:41:27] deity that he had come from in the
[1:41:30] beginning
[1:41:32] you see what we have received in our
[1:41:34] soul by the Holy Ghost truly is deity
[1:41:37] but it's so marred by our Humanity you
[1:41:40] see this is why we struggle with one
[1:41:42] another it's because the the human
[1:41:45] weakness of us all in our failures and
[1:41:48] our faults if we could ever appeal back
[1:41:50] beyond all of that and see what lives
[1:41:53] inside of your soul what would you see
[1:41:54] that little spot of deity but no doubt
[1:41:58] what John is seeing is the human part of
[1:42:01] this redeemed Elder Soul pulled back but
[1:42:04] he's not seeing his weakness his flaws
[1:42:07] his Humanity but he's seeing him in this
[1:42:10] Oh Glory to God and this post-figure of
[1:42:14] a redeemed Son of God standing there in
[1:42:17] a glorified body in so much that God
[1:42:19] would share the revelation of his word
[1:42:22] with this being and what happened to
[1:42:25] this person they were actually pulled
[1:42:27] back into the stage of deity which they
[1:42:30] come from oh I know you don't remember
[1:42:31] the and I don't either but before we
[1:42:34] come to this earth we were a part of
[1:42:36] Elohim we were a part of him it's
[1:42:39] further back than what our minds can go
[1:42:41] back to because we did not pre-exist I
[1:42:44] said human we did not pre-exist as a
[1:42:47] mortal there but we were in his mind we
[1:42:50] do not believe in pre-existence of souls
[1:42:52] the way the Mormon says that's right but
[1:42:54] we do believe that we dwelt in his mind
[1:42:56] and where do we come from we came from
[1:42:58] that great Elohim there's only one
[1:43:01] source of eternal life and that's him
[1:43:03] and this being had been so brought back
[1:43:06] into that tithe that John has now been
[1:43:09] been Associated and been hanging around
[1:43:11] this being which has been brought back
[1:43:14] into deity what does deity do what does
[1:43:18] deity do it demands worship and the
[1:43:21] person this person was so brought back
[1:43:24] into the deity of God that John falls
[1:43:27] down before him he's overwhelmed am I
[1:43:30] taking up for him no of course not but
[1:43:33] you can see looking at him this way you
[1:43:35] can see why a person would do it because
[1:43:37] his presence will become so great and so
[1:43:41] overwhelming that you just want to
[1:43:43] worship
[1:43:46] well I don't mind telling you
[1:43:48] I want us as the people of God
[1:43:51] I want us and our services
[1:43:55] to want him so much
[1:43:57] that he will come Among Us in a way like
[1:44:01] we have never seen him before
[1:44:04] and not that we bow before one another
[1:44:06] but we bow before him that we are so
[1:44:09] overwhelmed by his presence that when we
[1:44:12] are enter into those courts into that
[1:44:15] August courts of God and we enter into
[1:44:17] his courts with praise that we know he's
[1:44:20] sown there you've been in services and
[1:44:22] so have I joined the presence of God but
[1:44:24] so overwhelming you just see people
[1:44:26] bowed down with their chair or they get
[1:44:28] down on their face of their niece what
[1:44:30] is it it's something about deity when
[1:44:33] it's revealed in such a high Persona of
[1:44:36] God that it makes the human receiver
[1:44:38] want to worship God what does it make
[1:44:41] them want to do it makes him want to Bow
[1:44:44] and there's Humanity to the glory of God
[1:44:47] can you imagine a human being being
[1:44:49] brought so into the deity of God that
[1:44:53] another mortal would bow before them
[1:44:57] foreign
[1:45:08] Hallelujah
[1:45:11] let me just give you now a preview
[1:45:14] so after John Falls to worship
[1:45:17] then the angel tells him not to do it
[1:45:19] listen to the very next verse
[1:45:22] and I saw heaven opened
[1:45:25] and behold
[1:45:27] a white horse
[1:45:29] isn't it amazing that God understands
[1:45:33] John's overwhelming experience
[1:45:36] and he doesn't stop the vision
[1:45:38] and he doesn't punish him
[1:45:41] but he simply changes the scene
[1:45:44] they the being tells John not to worship
[1:45:48] so John corrects the error
[1:45:51] and the vision continues on
[1:45:53] what to now the breaking of the day of
[1:45:57] the Lord
[1:45:58] and I saw heaven open and behold a white
[1:46:01] horse
[1:46:02] and he that set upon him was called
[1:46:04] faithful and true
[1:46:07] and in righteousness does he judge
[1:46:11] and make war
[1:46:14] oh
[1:46:17] let's just pray
[1:46:24] Lord God just talking about this great
[1:46:26] presence
[1:46:30] oh Jesus
[1:46:33] how we long for that day when we will be
[1:46:36] called into it Lord
[1:46:39] many of us have experienced you as since
[1:46:42] we were little children
[1:46:44] without your presence
[1:46:47] but Lord we all know there's more
[1:46:51] and Lord there's been times that I've
[1:46:52] felt is so great I thought it would take
[1:46:54] my breaths
[1:46:56] I thought I can't take it no more
[1:47:01] Lord God whenever we once get back into
[1:47:03] that
[1:47:04] place where we came from
[1:47:08] but when we came from that
[1:47:11] we left it in attribute form
[1:47:14] but when we go back
[1:47:17] we will be an expressed form
[1:47:21] in a three-fold expression
[1:47:24] Soul see Gene
[1:47:26] theophany
[1:47:28] glorified body
[1:47:31] so when John is dealing with this
[1:47:34] being
[1:47:35] it's like it's post-change
[1:47:40] this being is so like God
[1:47:43] even though he was a redeemed mortal
[1:47:49] John Falls before him
[1:47:52] oh what awaits us Lord
[1:47:56] no wonder John said it does not yet
[1:47:59] appear what we shall be
[1:48:01] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:48:03] shall be like him
[1:48:05] for we shall see him
[1:48:07] as he is
[1:48:10] Lord it isn't just young men and young
[1:48:12] women you want us to become
[1:48:15] you want us to enter into that Shekinah
[1:48:20] Hallelujah
[1:48:22] we can only understand it father that
[1:48:25] when the foolish virgin type
[1:48:29] come into the city in the Eighth Day
[1:48:33] they're not just coming to see you
[1:48:36] they're not just coming to see the city
[1:48:40] but they're coming to see us
[1:48:44] because no doubt this will be part
[1:48:47] of what they will talk about out in the
[1:48:49] new Earth
[1:48:52] for eternity we will be learning about
[1:48:54] you and talking about you and you will
[1:48:57] be revealing to us
[1:48:59] the city inhabitants
[1:49:01] a level about you that the others
[1:49:05] are not supposed to hear
[1:49:07] but they will be hearing in their called
[1:49:10] degree
[1:49:11] as they did here in life
[1:49:16] Hallelujah
[1:49:18] and when they come in and they start
[1:49:19] walking up that Ascent of that beautiful
[1:49:22] pyramid-shaped city
[1:49:25] and they go to seeing us
[1:49:28] and they will bow their heads as it were
[1:49:31] and they will see human beings that they
[1:49:34] have been told by what's been told them
[1:49:37] on the outside of the city that that
[1:49:39] you're going to go in this is your first
[1:49:40] time to make the visit of the city
[1:49:43] you're going to see the great king
[1:49:45] seated there on the throne
[1:49:47] you'll see that Glory which will be the
[1:49:49] father you'll see the waters it comes
[1:49:51] down out of the thrones it trickles down
[1:49:53] but we're going to tell you now
[1:49:55] you're going to see other beings in that
[1:49:58] City
[1:49:59] they're going to look human
[1:50:02] but these are the chosen
[1:50:06] these are the elect
[1:50:11] they will be so much like him
[1:50:16] you will feel yourself
[1:50:18] being pulled to Bow your heads as it
[1:50:21] were
[1:50:22] in their presence
[1:50:24] before you ever even reach him
[1:50:28] Oh Glory to God
[1:50:30] Lord Jesus
[1:50:32] may we be that type of people on earth
[1:50:36] may we be able to lead people
[1:50:39] to you
[1:50:40] may we be so Godly
[1:50:43] may we live so in your presence Lord God
[1:50:48] that when people get around us
[1:50:51] they don't have to ask
[1:50:53] are we a Christian
[1:50:55] something about our life or tell them
[1:50:58] something will so emanate from our soul
[1:51:01] a presence and all oh it'll never be
[1:51:04] nothing like it was a brother Branham
[1:51:06] and the others and all the great people
[1:51:07] like that
[1:51:08] but just being a child of God
[1:51:11] being touched by heaven
[1:51:15] bearing witness of Heaven
[1:51:18] and when we get to heaven we will take
[1:51:20] on a Heavenly image
[1:51:23] that will be closer to the exalted image
[1:51:25] of our person that we have married
[1:51:29] the Lord Jesus
[1:51:31] than what those who live outside the
[1:51:33] city will bear
[1:51:36] and when these outside the city will
[1:51:39] come in and Throne the streets
[1:51:41] they will walk by
[1:51:43] and bow their heads as it were and they
[1:51:46] will know
[1:51:47] Jesus
[1:51:49] there he is
[1:51:51] you know they told me them people lived
[1:51:54] on earth
[1:51:55] just like we did
[1:51:58] look at him now
[1:52:01] Look At That Glory
[1:52:03] as it comes from them
[1:52:06] they tell me on Earth
[1:52:08] they was called The Bride
[1:52:12] Lord God
[1:52:15] Lord Jesus
[1:52:20] glorify
[1:52:22] thou us
[1:52:23] a glory
[1:52:25] that we had was you
[1:52:28] before the foundation
[1:52:37] oh Lord God we worship you
[1:52:41] we bless your name tonight Jesus
[1:52:45] Hallelujah
[1:52:47] oh it's not the presence of a man
[1:52:49] that we sent chair it's not the presence
[1:52:52] of a prophet
[1:52:54] or a preacher
[1:52:55] it's not the presence
[1:52:57] of a bride member
[1:52:59] that was sense near us
[1:53:02] but it's the presence of him
[1:53:04] who takes drunks and changes him
[1:53:08] and lets them bear the image
[1:53:10] of the glory of God
[1:53:13] it's the presence of him who would take
[1:53:15] a woman who was so vile
[1:53:18] she might be a street walker whatever
[1:53:19] more but so saved by the power of God
[1:53:24] that she will walk down the streets of
[1:53:26] gold
[1:53:27] people will come in her presence
[1:53:30] bow their heads
[1:53:32] the glory that we will share will be so
[1:53:35] great that day on our person father
[1:53:38] the angels will bow their heads
[1:53:41] as we come in
[1:53:44] Lord God
[1:53:46] the prophet said when we go to singing
[1:53:48] them songs of redemption
[1:53:50] the angels will bow their heads and they
[1:53:54] will circle the Earth
[1:53:56] while we are singing
[1:53:59] because they don't know the songs
[1:54:02] of redemption
[1:54:04] they have worshiped you and praised you
[1:54:07] from maybe millions of years
[1:54:10] and I tell them tonight to do good do a
[1:54:13] great job
[1:54:14] until I get there
[1:54:16] until the saints of God get there
[1:54:19] because we will be the ones
[1:54:22] that were strong
[1:54:24] the Throne of our blessed Lord our
[1:54:26] husband
[1:54:28] we will replace them
[1:54:32] and sing the songs
[1:54:34] very damn
[1:54:36] Hallelujah
[1:54:39] glory to God as we ourselves will bear
[1:54:43] the image
[1:54:44] of deity
[1:54:47] for we also will be changed and bear the
[1:54:51] image of the heavenly father
[1:54:54] that will enshroud the body of the Lord
[1:54:57] Jesus friends don't think I'm crazy
[1:55:00] one day you will take on
[1:55:03] that image that he wants to share with
[1:55:06] you he don't want you to just be young
[1:55:10] he wants you to have that Glory
[1:55:13] that you had with him before the world
[1:55:15] began
[1:55:17] this is what I see on this man
[1:55:20] that John bowed before him
[1:55:23] he was so much like Jesus
[1:55:27] John thought how could that be just a
[1:55:29] mere mortal
[1:55:31] it was the deity of God
[1:55:35] this is what awaits you
[1:55:38] so I asked you what trial could you go
[1:55:40] through
[1:55:41] what test could you go through
[1:55:43] they would even compare to the glory
[1:55:46] that awaits us
[1:55:49] when this battle is over
[1:55:52] oh Jesus
[1:55:55] my Melchizedek
[1:55:58] my God my king
[1:56:01] I worship you tonight Lord
[1:56:06] can we just raise our hands in the
[1:56:08] presence of the king
[1:56:10] oh thank you Lord Jesus
[1:56:14] Heavenly Father we worship you tonight
[1:56:19] oh Jesus

[1:56:31] are you
[1:56:32] ask for that
[1:56:34] and you prayed that prayer

[1:56:41] that I had with thee

[1:56:49] it's not just a young body
[1:56:58] we cannot have it now
[1:57:01] you cannot share it with us now
[1:57:05] but it awaits us
[1:57:08] oh blessed God
[1:57:11] blessed Lord God
[1:57:15] Jesus
[1:57:17] May the portion
[1:57:19] that we can receive tonight
[1:57:22] visit us in this place
[1:57:25] I don't ask for that which can only come
[1:57:28] Hereafter but I ask for the portion
[1:57:31] that I can take tonight
[1:57:34] Lord I ask for the portion that me and
[1:57:37] my sheep
[1:57:38] can take to that oh Lord God

[2:01:18] shine upon us that Jesus Christ can be
[2:01:21] heard out of our mouths Jesus Christ can
[2:01:24] be seen out of our everyday life that
[2:01:27] Jesus Christ can manifest himself not
