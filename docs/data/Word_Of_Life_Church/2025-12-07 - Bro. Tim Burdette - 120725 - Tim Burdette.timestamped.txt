[13:42] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts to the Lord Jesus.
[13:44] Precious Lord, again, we're thankful,
[13:47] Lord, to gather this morning with our
[13:49] brothers and sisters. Lord, we're
[13:51] thankful for all your goodness to us,
[13:54] Lord, this season of thanksgiving, this
[13:56] I guess we're most thankful that you
[13:59] predestinated us to see this end time
[14:01] word. We're thankful for that. And so
[14:03] why we've gathered again, Lord, for you
[14:06] to mold us and shape us. And like
[14:08] brother Pete Lawson preached Wednesday,
[14:10] we're the clay, Lord, and you're the
[14:12] potter. And sometimes we think, how much
[14:16] longer do we have to be on this wheel,
[14:18] but you're the one that knows just how
[14:20] long we need to be on this potter's
[14:22] wheel. And today is another day, Lord,
[14:24] for you to mold us and shape us. pray
[14:26] you'd help us forgive us of any things
[14:29] that's in that's besetting us, Lord, and
[14:32] just help us to lay aside all the
[14:34] thoughts and cares of this time of
[14:37] season where everybody's hustling and
[14:39] bustling. Let's just come into your
[14:41] house just quiet our thoughts and pray
[14:43] Lord that you'd anoint the preaching and
[14:45] anoint us to receive from you. And these
[14:48] prayer requests I have in my hands,
[14:49] Lord, each one is special. We know it's
[14:51] simply you the theme of the message of
[14:54] our day is only believe all things are
[14:57] possible. So that's what we do Lord in
[14:58] Jesus name. Amen.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you brother Dave.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ushers if you want to come at this
[15:04] time we receive the morning tithe and
[15:06] offering. Let's sing a song older older
[15:09] than any of us here probably but this is
[15:12] a good song because we're still fighting
[15:13] a fight today. Right.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; How many of you are still fighting? How
[15:18] many of you give up? How many of you
[15:21] don't even care? I believe we're on the
[15:24] battlefield for our Lord this morning.
[15:25] Don't you? Amen. And we're winning by
[15:28] the grace of God. Right. Give him one
[15:30] more good hand clap of praise if you
[15:32] love him this morning. [music]

[26:31] over. [music]

[32:42] [singing]
[32:44] [music]

[33:34] Precious be his name.
[33:37] He's the one we're here for today.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; You're not here for each other, but it's
[33:41] good to see each other. You're not here

[33:47] &gt;&gt; He alone,
[33:49] &gt;&gt; no one else.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; There could be there's so much value
[33:55] on this today.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; If we could understand the value that
[34:00] God's placed on this,
[34:03] &gt;&gt; the value money couldn't buy it.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Billions of dollars.
[34:10] $1 million is 11 days in seconds. Think
[34:14] of this. $1 million is 11 days of
[34:17] seconds.
[34:19] $1 billion is 32 years of seconds.
[34:25] And that won't touch it.
[34:27] Billions upon billions. It's so valuable
[34:31] to him
[34:32] &gt;&gt; that you're sitting here this morning.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; G.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:37] Give our king a praise offering, would
[34:39] you? [applause]
[34:47] I'm going to sing one song
[34:50] &gt;&gt; and I wouldn't sing that if he wouldn't
[34:52] leave me alone
[34:55] &gt;&gt; cuz I've got a lot to say today.
[34:57] [applause]
[35:02] You can be seated.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; [music]
[35:47] &gt;&gt; one song and then I'm going to get to
[35:49] preaching cuz I got some good stuff
[35:54] y'all. Y'all probably know this in uh
[35:56] it's an older song [music] but it'll go
[35:57] with what I want to say today.
[36:01] Try see
[36:04] from strength to strength.
[36:08] [music] We sometimes [singing]
[36:10] go,
[36:12] but then again,
[36:15] we're [music] sinking low
[36:20] in the shadow
[36:23] of the mountain,
[36:26] looming high [music] above
[36:30] our heads.
[36:32] We need not fear [music and singing]
[36:36] what lies ahead.
[36:40] For the [singing] word
[36:43] has clearly said
[36:46] that our faith
[36:49] [music]
[36:49] would be sufficient
[36:53] to make [singing] the mountain deappear.
[36:58] [singing and music]
[37:02] Speak to the mountain.
[37:07] Do not [music and singing] triumph
[37:10] over me.
[37:12] [music]
[37:13] Be thou [singing] removed.
[37:16] From here to yonder, [music]
[37:20] disappear into [singing]
[37:24] the sea.
[37:26] Speak to the mountain.
[37:30] Oh, [music] speak with
[37:34] authority [music and singing]
[37:40] and the mountain
[37:43] [singing]
[37:43] [music]
[37:44] will move
[37:46] and you shall claim victory.
[37:51] [music]
[37:57] In the midst [music]
[38:00] of the battle
[38:03] when the [singing] foe
[38:06] is gaining ground, [music]
[38:10] blue look up.
[38:13] See the mighty hand
[38:16] of [music] God [singing]
[38:19] just reaching down.
[38:22] Oh, [music and singing] speak God's
[38:24] name.
[38:26] Satan trembles.
[38:29] Speak [music] his [singing] word
[38:32] and watch him flee.
[38:35] Oh, [music] once again,
[38:39] our God delivers [music]
[38:42] the mountain
[38:45] and your feet. [singing]
[38:48] Speak [music] to the mountain.
[38:52] You're not trying
[38:55] [music] over me.
[38:58] Be thou removed
[39:01] [music] from here to [singing] yonder.
[39:05] Disappear into
[39:09] the sea. [singing]
[39:11] Speak [music] to the mountain.
[39:15] Oh, speak with [music and singing]
[39:19] authority
[39:24] and the mountain
[39:27] [singing]
[39:30] and you shall claim me
[39:35] to re
[39:36] speak to the mountain. [music]
[39:40] You're not trying
[39:44] over me.
[39:46] [music] Be thou [singing] removed
[39:50] from here yonder.
[39:53] [music] Disappear
[39:55] into
[39:57] the sea.
[39:59] Speak [music] to the mountain.
[40:02] [singing]
[40:03] Oh, speak with
[40:06] the glory. [singing and music]
[40:11] And the mountain
[40:16] [music] will move
[40:18] and you shall claim victory
[40:24] [singing]
[40:26] [music]
[40:27] and that mountain
[40:32] [singing] will move [music]
[40:34] and you shall claim me
[40:38] to reach.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[40:45] [music]
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:54] Can we sing this old one that we like so
[40:56] well?
[40:59] Out on the water,
[41:02] storms [singing]
[41:03] raging high.
[41:05] The waters around them
[41:08] [singing and music] were troubled that
[41:11] night.
[41:13] Fear filled their hearts. [music]
[41:16] They thought they would die,
[41:19] but they failed [music] to remember that
[41:22] the master [singing] was nine. Oh, he
[41:26] [music] spoke the words
[41:29] and the winds all stood still.
[41:32] [music]
[41:33] Even the waters they oyed his will.
[41:39] He calmed their storms
[41:42] [music] like he will yours and mine
[41:46] if I'll just remember.
[41:49] He lives inside. [music]
[41:52] So why should we wary? Oh why should we
[41:57] fear?
[42:00] Very saint [music] Jesus stays
[42:04] so [singing] near. He lives in my heart
[42:07] [music]
[42:09] and he hears me [singing] when I cry.
[42:12] I'm going to call [music] on his name
[42:15] till the storm
[42:17] passes by. [music]
[42:21] We read [singing] in the Bible
[42:26] where he [music] walked within
[42:29] he brought light to the darkness when
[42:32] the way [music] seems so dim. Oh, but
[42:36] how great it would be
[42:38] have his footsteps in mine. [music]
[42:42] Walk with the master [singing]
[42:45] all the time. And when trials come
[42:50] [music]
[42:51] and [singing] see,
[42:54] oh, let's call on the master, he'll be
[42:58] there on time. [music]
[43:01] And when [singing] sickness comes and
[43:04] our body heals in [music] pain,
[43:07] all we got to do
[43:10] is call on his name. [music]
[43:14] So why should we wear church? Why should
[43:18] we fear
[43:20] when the very [music] same Jesus
[43:23] said he stays always dear? [singing]
[43:27] He lives in my heart. And he hears me
[43:31] when I [singing and music] cry.
[43:34] Let's call on his name
[43:37] when [music] the storm
[43:39] passes [singing] by.
[43:42] [music] I said I read in that old Bible
[43:47] how he walked with him.
[43:50] He brought light to the darkness when
[43:53] the [music] way seemed so dim.
[43:56] How [singing] great it would be to have
[44:00] his footsteps in mind,
[44:02] [singing and music]
[44:03] to walk with the master all
[44:08] the time. [music and singing]
[44:10] And when trials come [singing and music]
[44:13] and it seems so nice, call on the
[44:18] master. He'll be there [singing]
[44:21] on time. [music]
[44:23] When sickness comes
[44:26] and [music] your body heals [singing] in
[44:28] pain, church, all you got to do
[44:32] is call on his name. So why should we
[44:38] wear? [music]
[44:39] Why should we fear [singing]
[44:42] when the very same Jesus
[44:46] stays [music]
[44:47] so near? He lives in my arms [singing]
[44:52] and he [music] hears me when I cry.
[44:56] Call on his name till the stor passes
[45:01] by. Why should we wary? [music]
[45:05] Why should I fear?
[45:09] Very same Jesus said he stays
[45:13] so near.
[45:15] lives in my heart
[45:18] and he [music] hears [singing] me when I
[45:20] cry. I'll call on his name [music] till
[45:25] the storm passes by.
[45:29] [singing]
[45:30] [music]
[45:31] I'm going to call on his name.
[45:37] [music]
[45:38] Church, let's call on his name.
[45:45] Let's call on his name [singing]
[45:52] [music] till the storm passes by.
[46:18] Oh, it's so good to be in church today.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; We're so grateful to be to be able to
[46:25] stand here today before the body of
[46:27] Jesus Christ.
[46:30] Appreciate you making your way out to
[46:31] the service today.
[46:34] Don't worry, I'm not going to say all
[46:36] this
[46:40] so y'all can see my notes. When they on
[46:41] them iPads, you don't know how much they
[46:43] got.
[46:49] I've prayed and prayed and prayed this
[46:51] week
[46:53] and this is what he gave me. I have
[46:56] preached half of this at my church. The
[46:58] rest I just got Thursday and Friday and
[47:00] last night. So, hi for this I have not
[47:03] even spoke. Hi, for this I have.
[47:08] But I want to look at a subject today.
[47:10] Let's stand together just for a moment.
[47:14] Could we sing the course again?
[47:17] I'm going to make it.
[47:19] And G G
[47:21] as we get ready because he's already
[47:24] said I could.
[47:26] Oh, I'm
[47:29] going to make it.
[47:33] [music]
[47:35] He's already said that I would.
[47:39] [music]
[47:41] I'll
[47:43] keep on trusting.
[47:47] Oh, that he's working [music] everything
[47:49] for my good.
[47:53] He
[47:55] [music]
[47:56] walks
[47:58] beside
[48:00] [singing] me. [music]
[48:01] Heaven.
[48:05] [singing]
[48:07] [music]
[48:12] Oh, hallelujah. [singing]
[48:14] Hallelujah.
[48:15] [music] Despite of myself, I'm going to
[48:17] make it. Oh. [singing]
[48:22] [music]
[48:24] [singing]
[48:25] Oh, yes I am.
[48:28] [music]
[48:32] M
[48:34] [music and singing]
[48:36] I'm going to keep on
[48:38] trusting
[48:40] all that he's working [music]
[48:44] everything for my good [singing]
[48:47] and he [music]
[48:51] walks beside me. [singing]
[48:56] He arms in my view. [music]
[49:03] I know I'm going to make
[49:06] [music]
[49:08] it through
[49:15] and the church can say
[49:17] &gt;&gt; amen.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, give him a hand clap of praise now.
[49:19] [applause]
[49:22] Hallelujah.
[49:26] Heavenly Father,
[49:28] what a critical hour we're standing in
[49:30] today.
[49:32] Oh, but what a glorious hour.
[49:36] The world's not falling apart. She's
[49:38] fell apart. We hear the prophet say
[49:41] these things many times. Flesh and red
[49:44] light of his coming. The God of this
[49:47] evil age. So many messages, Father, that
[49:50] he's be to speak. and now the
[49:53] fulfillment of all those great things
[49:55] that were said
[49:57] here before us today.
[50:00] But Lord, we're not worried about it
[50:03] because we're in you today.
[50:05] We're in Christ and Christ is in us. And
[50:08] we're so thankful for that. I pray,
[50:11] Father, that you would help me to say
[50:14] the right words today.
[50:16] Shut my mouth, Lord, when it needs to be
[50:19] shut.
[50:20] May every ear be open to hear
[50:23] because I believe with all my heart what
[50:25] a powerful subject that this is today.
[50:28] If we've sinned or failed you or any
[50:30] thoughts that's not right, forgive us,
[50:34] Lord. If we've said anything that's not
[50:36] right, forgive us.
[50:38] There's anything within these walls and
[50:41] this roof and this floor of this service
[50:43] today that would hinder the spirit of
[50:45] God, we ask for mercy and grace.
[50:49] We love you and we thank you for each
[50:50] one that's made their way. The
[50:52] musicians, the singers, every person.
[50:55] We're grateful for it today. Now bless
[50:57] your word and open it to our hearts. We
[51:00] ask these things in thy precious name.
[51:03] Amen. And amen.
[51:05] We start the service today.
[51:10] My subject title would be listen very
[51:13] carefully to the words. My subject title
[51:16] would be the power of kingdom life.
[51:21] Listen very carefully. The power of
[51:25] kingdom life. I preach constantly on the
[51:29] kingdom because that's the only thing
[51:32] that's going to be left cuz everything
[51:36] is going to fail but the kingdom.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to turn to Psalms 81 for me.
[51:44] But in the meantime, I'm going to quote
[51:46] a scripture. Genesis 1:26.
[51:49] We know that he's creating everything
[51:51] upon the earth. The first six days, we
[51:54] find him creating man. We find him
[51:57] taking his rest. We he tells us in in
[52:02] Genesis 1:26
[52:05] to have dominionship.
[52:09] Let them have dominion over everything,
[52:13] the land, the sea, everything.
[52:17] That's the way it was created.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; We find out that God owns the earth.
[52:25] I'll let you be seated in just a moment.
[52:27] Just bear with me, please.
[52:29] God owns the earth. He says, "I'm in the
[52:32] heavens."
[52:34] He said, "Adam, I want you
[52:37] to have dominion over this earth." In
[52:39] other words, he's telling Adam, "I want
[52:41] you to run it."
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Now, if I say things today that maybe
[52:47] seem out of the way, don't toss me out
[52:49] yet.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Just please hear me out
[52:57] &gt;&gt; because I look at the scriptures and I
[52:59] look deeper into them than I used to.
[53:04] So he tells Adam, "I want you. I own it,
[53:09] but I'm going to let you run it."
[53:16] &gt;&gt; We understand sin comes in, takes Adam
[53:18] out of his position.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:24] &gt;&gt; So somehow he's got to get the people
[53:27] back to their position. That's right.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Now, we know if we jump down the road
[53:31] thousands of years, we find Calvary
[53:33] comes, we find the resurrection, the
[53:34] third day. Now, he's on the road to
[53:37] restore, to renew, to refresh, to bring
[53:41] a reborn back upon the earth. We find
[53:44] out when Jesus was on the earth one
[53:46] time, just please bear with me. I was
[53:48] going to make this a one service, but I
[53:50] can't do that. And then he added all
[53:52] this to me last night. So, I'm going to
[53:53] have to see if I can get a part two down
[53:56] the road.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[53:59] &gt;&gt; He starts his work and I want you to
[54:01] remember how Jesus comes and Jesus makes
[54:04] the statement says you must be born with
[54:06] water and spirit. You remember that? And
[54:09] the Bible says Jesus breathes on them
[54:12] and says receive ye
[54:15] the Holy Ghost. You remember that he
[54:18] didn't say here take the Holy Ghost. He
[54:21] didn't say he didn't say he said
[54:23] receive. Notice the word receive because
[54:26] it's very very striking in this this
[54:29] word.
[54:30] He sith unto them receive ye the Holy
[54:34] Spirit is what he actually says. The
[54:36] word see c i v actually means to have or
[54:40] to possess.
[54:43] The word see c i ve
[54:46] means to possess. The prefix of re
[54:51] actually means again. So he's telling
[54:54] them again. Why? Because one time they
[54:56] had it.
[54:59] In the mind of God, we had it.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Sin cometh throwed us out.
[55:06] He says, "But sooner or later, one day,
[55:08] I'll bring you back." Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; So if Adam had dominionship in the
[55:14] garden, then the body of Christ today
[55:17] must have dominionship.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; If the church of Jesus Christ does not
[55:23] come back and receive dominion, you'll
[55:26] not go in a rapture
[55:29] &gt;&gt; because you got to overcome this.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; You've got to be able to speak to the
[55:35] mountain or speak to this your need,
[55:37] whatever you need. What are you doing?
[55:40] He's placing dominion back on the earth
[55:43] where it's supposed to be. So in other
[55:46] words, he says, I want you to take
[55:48] possession of the Holy Ghost again.
[55:52] Hallelujah. I want you to take
[55:55] possession of it again because they had
[55:58] it.
[55:59] Now, let me allow me to say this and I'm
[56:01] going to read Psalms 8.
[56:05] Jesus was born during a Roman Empire.
[56:08] Actually, the Roman Empire was the
[56:10] closest setting
[56:13] of the way the kingdom of God would
[56:16] actually run.
[56:18] There's a reason that he was born at
[56:20] this time. The Roman Empire would
[56:23] actually begin to expand their territory
[56:25] and they usually would bring people in
[56:27] from exile
[56:29] if you look the history up and see it.
[56:32] But in this case, they didn't do that.
[56:36] They would conquer you and allow you to
[56:38] live. Listen now. They would conquer you
[56:41] this community, this city of this part
[56:43] of this town of this country. And they
[56:46] would allow you to live in your native
[56:48] land. But here's what they would do. Oh
[56:50] my. I had one of those shouting hissy
[56:52] fits last night on this. But what they
[56:54] would do was actually let you live in
[56:56] your native land,
[56:59] but they would send a colony of Romans
[57:03] to colonize you
[57:06] [sighs]
[57:07] with the Roman culture.
[57:10] So they wanted you to forget your
[57:11] history and they wanted to teach you new
[57:15] history, which is the very same thing
[57:18] that's going on now.
[57:20] Just bear with me. It's okay. It's all
[57:23] right to get out of your box every now
[57:24] and then.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; So, in the the most powerful person that
[57:30] would be in this colony would be what we
[57:32] would call today the governor.
[57:36] Oh my. He would actually re-educate the
[57:39] people away from their old pway into a
[57:43] new kingdom that they had set up the
[57:45] Roman Empire.
[57:47] Oh my.
[57:50] But now when you come to Jesus,
[57:53] let's call him the governor.
[57:56] What's his desire? To break your old
[57:59] habits.
[58:01] He wants to set you up in this new
[58:04] kingdom.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He wants to set you up in
[58:09] this kingdom.
[58:12] I preach hundreds of services on the
[58:14] kingdom. I just can't get away from it.
[58:16] So now as you're saved and you get born
[58:19] again, you're now in the new kingdom. So
[58:22] you can't accomplish any listen very
[58:24] carefully. You cannot accomplish
[58:26] everything God wants in the new kingdom
[58:29] when you got your head stuck in the old
[58:31] kingdom.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I can't accomplish what God wants me to
[58:38] accomplish here with my mind [screaming]
[58:40] in the old kingdom.
[58:43] So our governor, our Lord, our Savior,
[58:47] our deliverer, he now is re-educating
[58:50] us.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; It started when a prophet came on the
[58:54] scene.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Now he's placed men of God around the
[58:58] world to bring [screaming] a
[59:00] re-education that will pull us from this
[59:02] kingdom that we actually live in and
[59:05] place our mindset in the other kingdom.
[59:08] Why? Because [screaming] in that kingdom
[59:10] there's power. In that kingdom there's
[59:13] power. In that there's a kingdom. Oh,
[59:16] glory to God. In that kingdom there's a
[59:19] life. [screaming]
[59:26] &gt;&gt; So the spirit is the governor of the
[59:29] kingdom. So he has power to execute
[59:33] God's way of life in this difficult and
[59:36] evil kingdom.
[59:41] Paul says, "I beseech you therefore by
[59:44] the mercies of God that you present your
[59:46] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[59:48] acceptable unto God, which is a
[59:50] reasonable service." So he's basically
[59:52] Paul was passionately
[59:54] saying and urging them to listen. And
[59:56] look what he says then. And be not
[59:58] conformed to this world, but you be you
[1:00:00] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:00:01] mind. This is just extra. Just hold on.
[1:00:03] This is you ain't got to pay for this.
[1:00:07] This is extra. This ain't even my
[1:00:09] message, but it tied in. So, I got to
[1:00:10] have it that you may prove
[1:00:14] what is good and acceptable and perfect
[1:00:16] will of God. So, now the imagery, let
[1:00:18] your mind's going. I'm fixing to read
[1:00:19] Psalms 8:1. The imagery that Paul is
[1:00:23] placing is a is a potter [screaming]
[1:00:26] with his wheel and he's on the wheel is
[1:00:30] some clay and he's molding and
[1:00:32] conforming this this this potter into
[1:00:36] what he wants it to be. He's shaping
[1:00:38] he's forming. So the [screaming] world
[1:00:40] is trying to conform me. The world is
[1:00:43] trying to conform you every day of your
[1:00:46] life. He's the world is trying to
[1:00:48] conform and shape you into their
[1:00:50] [screaming] image.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:59] Social media, YouTube, news outlets,
[1:01:01] politicians, entertainment, music,
[1:01:03] books.
[1:01:05] Why? Because we're in [screaming] the
[1:01:07] age of an information age.
[1:01:10] [snorts] Everything is information.
[1:01:12] Continually information 24 hours a day.
[1:01:15] Back in the old days, we didn't have a
[1:01:18] television back then. We never we never
[1:01:19] had that. But I would spend a night out
[1:01:21] with people that they would have
[1:01:23] television and [screaming] at 11:00 it'd
[1:01:24] be just lines.
[1:01:27] Don't act like y'all don't remember
[1:01:28] that.
[1:01:32] But now [screaming] every second of the
[1:01:34] day is something of information.
[1:01:40] So he says, "Don't let the [screaming]
[1:01:41] world don't let it form you into their
[1:01:44] image.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Let God [screaming]
[1:01:48] conform you, your mind, into the new
[1:01:51] kingdom age [snorts] where there's
[1:01:54] life."
[1:01:58] [sighs]
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And then Paul said, "Be you transformed
[1:02:01] by the renewing of your mind." In other
[1:02:03] words, he says, "Changed our brain."
[1:02:04] Brother Bram says, "A metapomorphosis by
[1:02:07] a r." There's that prefix again, renew.
[1:02:11] Why? Because you've been there before.
[1:02:14] You've had that before. Your mind's been
[1:02:16] that way before. And the word prove
[1:02:18] there means, notice what he says when
[1:02:20] Paul says that you be transformed. That
[1:02:22] you may prove. The word prove there
[1:02:24] actually means that you may allow
[1:02:29] that you may allow the will of God.
[1:02:34] [panting]
[1:02:36] So he's trying to put you back in the
[1:02:37] kingdom life.
[1:02:40] Psalms 8:1. Then I want you can be
[1:02:42] seated. To the chief musician upon
[1:02:45] Gillith, a psalm of David. Oh Lord our
[1:02:49] Lord, how excellent is thy name in all
[1:02:51] the earth who has set thy glory. Now
[1:02:54] listen carefully. I'm going to make a
[1:02:55] few statements on the glory. I'm asking
[1:02:57] you please don't turn me off.
[1:03:01] [sighs]
[1:03:03] Let me explain this.
[1:03:07] How excellent is thy name in all the
[1:03:09] earth, who has set thy glory above the
[1:03:11] heavens. Out of thy mouth of babes and
[1:03:13] sucklings, hast thou ordained strength
[1:03:16] because of thine enemies, that thou
[1:03:18] mightest steal the enemy and avenger.
[1:03:21] When I consider the heavens, the work of
[1:03:22] thy fingers, the moon and the stars
[1:03:24] which thou hast ordained? What is man?
[1:03:27] Now watching me changes to man. What is
[1:03:29] man that thou art mindful of man of him?
[1:03:32] The son of man that thou visitest him
[1:03:35] for thou hath made him a little lower
[1:03:37] than the angels.
[1:03:39] You can be seated.
[1:03:42] [sighs and gasps]
[1:03:44] Listen carefully to me today. I won't
[1:03:46] hold you long. I know I'm not going to
[1:03:48] finish.
[1:03:50] I'll find a place to stop to start
[1:03:52] another day maybe if I'm invited back
[1:03:55] after today.
[1:03:58] For thou hath made him a little lower
[1:04:01] than the angels.
[1:04:04] Wow,
[1:04:07] this is so striking.
[1:04:12] that thou hast made him, he's speaking
[1:04:14] of man, a little lower than the angels.
[1:04:19] So if we have lost something, then it
[1:04:22] would be our job to go back and get it.
[1:04:27] Right?
[1:04:30] If you look in the scriptures, you'll
[1:04:31] find that Jesus spoke on parables
[1:04:33] continually.
[1:04:36] Most of all his parables is speaking of
[1:04:38] the kingdom.
[1:04:40] The kingdom is a very important thing,
[1:04:42] friends.
[1:04:45] Without the kingdom, there'll be no
[1:04:49] there'll be no rapture. There'll be no
[1:04:51] heaven. There'll be nothing because it's
[1:04:54] the only thing that matters.
[1:04:57] You'll find he talks of the coin, the
[1:04:59] sheep, the sun. Many things he spoke in
[1:05:02] parables.
[1:05:04] But I believe there's something in all
[1:05:05] of these scriptures that is missing.
[1:05:09] Have we been speaking on it? I want to
[1:05:11] look at the word glory for a second and
[1:05:12] I want to bring that glory
[1:05:16] back to the church.
[1:05:19] Notice in verse five, he says, "Thou
[1:05:21] hast made him a little lower than the
[1:05:23] angels."
[1:05:25] Now, I personally wouldn't want the task
[1:05:28] to
[1:05:30] interpret the scriptures and put it in
[1:05:32] all the different languages.
[1:05:36] What a great task that is.
[1:05:41] They would have to go around the world
[1:05:42] continually all over the world and
[1:05:44] they'd have to learn different
[1:05:46] languages.
[1:05:48] Think of this now. They would have to go
[1:05:49] to the bush
[1:05:51] to the I mean regions that man don't
[1:05:54] even live. They'd have to go everywhere,
[1:05:56] Africa, and they'd learn all of these
[1:05:59] different languages in order
[1:06:02] to place the scriptures
[1:06:06] in
[1:06:08] another language.
[1:06:14] But in fact, it's just the facts of it.
[1:06:16] It's the truth. in these different
[1:06:18] languages and in these different
[1:06:21] translations
[1:06:23] here and there things get left out.
[1:06:27] There's times that they'll put different
[1:06:29] words in to make it basically say close
[1:06:33] to the same thing, but yet really
[1:06:34] doesn't mean exactly.
[1:06:38] The scripture here in verse 5 says he
[1:06:40] made them
[1:06:42] a little lower than the angels.
[1:06:46] The translators actually dumbed that
[1:06:49] down.
[1:06:50] That's not what it really is.
[1:06:56] Yeah, this is good. Listen,
[1:06:59] because if you think about if you would
[1:07:02] indicate in this passage of scripture as
[1:07:04] David is saying it, this passage of
[1:07:07] scripture is so powerful and so great.
[1:07:10] But if we could take it in the literal
[1:07:12] form, it would be too much for people.
[1:07:17] Well, John, it would be too much. I
[1:07:19] don't know how many people could really
[1:07:20] handle it.
[1:07:23] So, the translators dumbed it down, if I
[1:07:25] could use that terminology, to make it
[1:07:27] say angels. That's not the original word
[1:07:30] in in the original.
[1:07:34] It's actually why the church is in the
[1:07:37] condition that she's in today. And I
[1:07:40] mean church in general.
[1:07:44] So the word there is angels. Actually it
[1:07:49] the original translation of that is
[1:07:52] Elohim.
[1:07:55] So in other words it would say for thou
[1:07:57] hath made him a little lower than
[1:08:00] Elohim.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Very different. But now, what would
[1:08:07] people think if back then they would
[1:08:09] read this and David would say this and
[1:08:12] they would read it and they say, "You're
[1:08:14] just you're just a you're just a sh
[1:08:16] you're just a tad lower than God." Oh my
[1:08:20] god. They'd probably hang you.
[1:08:23] So, they have to dumb it down. They want
[1:08:25] to make it close,
[1:08:28] but we can't go awful close. I've always
[1:08:31] heard close only works in horseshoes.
[1:08:34] You've got to be right or not.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; So they would say, you know, [screaming]
[1:08:41] why thou hast made him a little lower
[1:08:44] than Elohim, God.
[1:08:47] Also it means the mighty one also it
[1:08:50] means to be godlike.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Now this is what we've got to be in the
[1:09:00] new kingdom.
[1:09:04] Oh my, you talking about a powerhouse.
[1:09:10] Now, God did not make you lower than the
[1:09:13] angels. In fact, according to the
[1:09:16] prophet of God for this age, you have
[1:09:18] [screaming] the ability to command the
[1:09:21] angels.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; So, if you're able to command the
[1:09:26] angels, how [screaming] are you lower
[1:09:29] than the angels?
[1:09:38] A lot of people talk to me and they tell
[1:09:40] me, [clears throat]
[1:09:42] "Why? Why? Why do you why do you why do
[1:09:44] you get so deep in these words? It
[1:09:46] really doesn't matter." Oh, yes it does.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Because I'm not preaching to a church
[1:09:52] world.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to somebody that's going
[1:09:55] to be the kingdom.
[1:09:57] Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; The church world will never be the
[1:10:00] kingdom that I'm talking about. They'll
[1:10:01] be [screaming] a part of that kingdom,
[1:10:03] no doubt.
[1:10:08] [sighs]
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; So, I have the ability to command the
[1:10:13] angels. There's no way he made me lower
[1:10:16] than the one that I have authority over.
[1:10:19] That's right.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; There's no way, brother Jackie, that I
[1:10:25] have the ability to command an angel,
[1:10:28] but yet I'm lower than him.
[1:10:31] That doesn't even make sense.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; So, I have the ability to command them.
[1:10:40] I have the ability to have authority
[1:10:42] over them. So, this verse of scripture
[1:10:44] actually says, "I made you lower than
[1:10:49] God himself.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; God is here.
[1:10:56] You're here.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; The angels is here.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Now, when you dumb that down, you say,
[1:11:06] "Well, we're a little lower than the
[1:11:07] angels." Now, the church world teaches
[1:11:09] this. You're made lower than the angels.
[1:11:14] You'll never become in the dominionship
[1:11:17] that God wants you to become in lower
[1:11:19] than the angels.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Now, you just give me the day. I lose my
[1:11:31] voice all the time. Just give me today.
[1:11:37] So, you mean to tell me, preacher, that
[1:11:40] I'm I'm up there? Why does the scripture
[1:11:42] say you're almost equal with God?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Who thought it was not [screaming]
[1:11:46] robbery to be equal with him? [sighs]
[1:11:49] [panting]
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; See what see word of life what we have
[1:11:55] actually got away from.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; We have actually got away from what the
[1:12:02] original scripture says.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; That's why I believe we should seek him.
[1:12:10] his wisdom.
[1:12:13] [sighs]
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; The Bible teaches here is to him that
[1:12:17] has wisdom.
[1:12:21] Remember the Bible teaches us and the
[1:12:23] prophet of God did when he made you, he
[1:12:25] made his kind.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; The angels is not his kind.
[1:12:32] [snorts]
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; You're his kind.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Now, this is very important. Listen
[1:12:39] carefully.
[1:12:42] There are 2,251
[1:12:44] hits on this. And every one of them,
[1:12:46] every one of 2,251
[1:12:50] hits leads back
[1:12:53] to Elohim,
[1:12:55] God himself,
[1:12:58] the mighty one.
[1:13:06] So
[1:13:09] now let me ask you a question. This is
[1:13:12] where
[1:13:13] y'all may want to throw me out.
[1:13:16] And [snorts] that's fine. I'll still
[1:13:17] love y'all.
[1:13:24] [laughter]
[1:13:26] Notice verse six. For thou, let's finish
[1:13:29] verse five. And hath crowned him. Thou
[1:13:32] madeth him a little lower than the
[1:13:34] angels, which the word there is Elohim,
[1:13:37] God himself, and hath crowned him. Now,
[1:13:41] who's he talking about? Who did he who
[1:13:44] David is talking about, man? What is
[1:13:47] man?
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And then David picks it up and says,
[1:13:53] "And hath crowned him with glory." You
[1:13:55] mean to tell me that the body of Christ
[1:13:58] is supposed to have some glory?
[1:14:01] Oh, come on.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; So, he crowned me. He crowned you with a
[1:14:10] portion of glory.
[1:14:12] Oh, but Tim, you can't do that. You're
[1:14:14] blaspheing. You're going to take away
[1:14:16] from God.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You you you can't say that, Tim. You
[1:14:23] can't do that.
[1:14:26] I can leave now if y'all want me to.
[1:14:30] I don't care what anybody says. I don't
[1:14:32] care what any message preacher says. It
[1:14:34] doesn't matter. God crowned [screaming]
[1:14:36] him with glory.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; But when sin steps in the garden, I lose
[1:14:44] my dominion.
[1:14:46] Adam lost [screaming] his dominionship
[1:14:48] and Adam lost his glory. Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Well, but I hear brother Brandham say
[1:14:56] that God will share his [screaming]
[1:14:57] glory with no one. Well, why don't you
[1:14:59] read the rest of them?
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Why don't we read one quote and we stay
[1:15:06] with that? What you going to do the
[1:15:08] other five or six?
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:15:20] So, so I lost my glory. [sighs]
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all lost y'all's glory.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Adam lost his glory. Is that right?
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; So, you mean God wants me to have glory?
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Verse six says, "Thou madeth him, man,
[1:15:38] [screaming] to have dominion over the
[1:15:40] works of thy hands. Thou hast put all
[1:15:43] things under his feet."
[1:15:48] So you mean to tell me I have dominion?
[1:15:50] Who? Me?
[1:15:53] Now if I don't want to use it, that's
[1:15:55] not God's fault.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; If we want to stay in the same boat and
[1:16:01] row in the boat with everybody else,
[1:16:03] [screaming] that's not God's fault.
[1:16:08] [sighs]
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Don't take me wrong here. Please don't
[1:16:11] take me wrong.
[1:16:13] [sighs]
[1:16:17] You promise you're not going to take me
[1:16:18] wrong.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; I want to hear everybody. You promise
[1:16:22] you're not going to take me wrong.
[1:16:27] [sighs]
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to ask this question
[1:16:33] because it's so awkward asking this
[1:16:36] question because people don't understand
[1:16:37] it.
[1:16:41] No, God owns it,
[1:16:46] but I want you to rule it.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; God owns it, but I want you, brother
[1:16:52] Robert, to run it.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Now, that puts God in control of
[1:16:57] everything.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Is it? Do you say amen?
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:17:03] Then why do we always make a statement?
[1:17:09] I'm just scared to say it, Janet. I
[1:17:10] don't know what to do
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; because I don't have a lot of people in
[1:17:15] my church and they looked at me so
[1:17:16] bugeyed they didn't know what to think.
[1:17:19] And I don't really want to look at no
[1:17:21] 500 bug eyes.
[1:17:25] But I will
[1:17:28] Why do we say all the time God's got
[1:17:31] listen before you don't don't say
[1:17:33] nothing.
[1:17:36] We say all the time, God has [screaming]
[1:17:38] everything in control.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Just think now, just think.
[1:17:46] Here's the way I look at that.
[1:17:49] If he owns it and he told me to run it,
[1:17:52] then who's supposed to have it in
[1:17:53] control?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; You want me to continue? You want me to
[1:18:02] leave? All right.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz I don't want to say nothing that
[1:18:05] brother Donniey's got to call me and
[1:18:06] chew me out.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Because if I look at this thing right,
[1:18:13] if God, we know he we know, brother
[1:18:15] Robert, he has it in control. We We're
[1:18:16] not We're not We're not stupid,
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and I don't like to use that word on the
[1:18:20] pull pit, but I'm just being honest with
[1:18:22] you today. We know that he has it in
[1:18:24] control. We know that he allowed Adam to
[1:18:27] run the earth.
[1:18:30] But then sin comes and it took his
[1:18:32] glory. It took his honor. It took his
[1:18:35] dominionship. Now God,
[1:18:39] that's why brother Bam said that Satan
[1:18:41] is the God of this evil age.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; So now, who's got this world in control?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Brother B tells us all the time, God
[1:18:51] allows this. God allows this. God allows
[1:18:53] this. Now, we all know, brother John,
[1:18:56] that God I if God actually had it in
[1:18:58] control, he owns it. Please listen to
[1:19:00] me.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; I know he owns it. I know it's all in
[1:19:04] his hands.
[1:19:07] But I'm just persuaded to believe if God
[1:19:09] had it in his control, he'd fix this
[1:19:11] bunch of mess that we in.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; But he says, "I want y'all to run it."
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; I want y'all to run it.
[1:19:22] Are you with me this far?
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; God's over everything. We know he owns
[1:19:28] the universe. We under that. But let's
[1:19:29] read read it for what it says. Now watch
[1:19:31] this.
[1:19:33] I believe this is what brother Brham was
[1:19:36] trying to get us to understand and
[1:19:37] trying to see because if I read my Bible
[1:19:40] right, the Bible said that God was in
[1:19:43] ownership.
[1:19:45] The Bible says the Lord, the earth is
[1:19:47] the Lord's and all the fullness thereof.
[1:19:50] Is that right?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you a question. Have you
[1:19:53] ever rented anything?
[1:19:58] Have you ever leased anything?
[1:20:03] [sighs]
[1:20:03] In a lease, you don't own it.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; In a rent, you don't own it.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; There's another owner.
[1:20:13] But let me ask you a question. If you're
[1:20:14] renting your house or you're you're
[1:20:16] leasing your house, tell me who's in
[1:20:18] charge of it.
[1:20:29] As long as you're leasing it, you're in
[1:20:31] charge of it. As long as you paying that
[1:20:34] monthly bill, [screaming] you're in
[1:20:36] charge of that land.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; So now, let me set the record straight.
[1:20:46] Man is in dominion.
[1:20:52] [laughter]
[1:20:53] God is not in control of the earth, but
[1:20:56] he's in ownership.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; I told you I look at the scriptures a
[1:21:08] little bit different.
[1:21:11] God is in ownership. Now, I know that
[1:21:14] troublesome people.
[1:21:17] But let me ask you this question. If God
[1:21:19] was in control like most of the world
[1:21:21] and most people think, I think he could
[1:21:23] have his place fixed in about one
[1:21:25] second.
[1:21:28] I'm not trying to take anything away
[1:21:30] from God. I'm placing the scriptures
[1:21:31] where they're supposed to be placed. I
[1:21:33] believe the whole thing is in his hand.
[1:21:34] Is that right?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Notice verse five. Hath crowned him with
[1:21:38] glory and honor. Actually glory means
[1:21:42] has means has surrounded him or hath
[1:21:45] bestowed [screaming] glory upon him. The
[1:21:49] word honor means to adorn with. In other
[1:21:52] words, there has been a glory placed on
[1:21:54] you to glorify God. It's not you doing
[1:21:58] it, it's God using you.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; There's nothing in us that wants to
[1:22:06] glorify God. That's why we become born
[1:22:09] again. Then everything that's in me
[1:22:11] wants to give God glory. We come here
[1:22:14] today to [screaming] give God glory. You
[1:22:17] didn't come to give man glory. We didn't
[1:22:19] come just to give musicians glory. We
[1:22:22] come to give God glory. Why? [screaming]
[1:22:24] He's the ownership.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; But if we don't take our glory back, if
[1:22:34] we don't take our honor back, if we
[1:22:36] don't take our dominionship back, what's
[1:22:38] going to happen?
[1:22:41] [sighs]
[1:22:45] [panting]
[1:22:47] The word adorn is the same word that's
[1:22:49] used in the scriptures for a woman to
[1:22:51] adorn
[1:22:53] herself in the right apparel.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; So in other words, you put upon
[1:22:58] yourself, you adorn yourself with the
[1:23:01] right
[1:23:03] word,
[1:23:05] which is the clothing of God.
[1:23:10] Same thing there as God crowns and
[1:23:12] honors.
[1:23:13] Think of it, he he crowns
[1:23:17] and honors upon you.
[1:23:22] Brother Brown said he would go to
[1:23:24] Calvary for one person.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; So tell me you're not valuable.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Tell me you're not you're not important.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; The word honor here is also a glory that
[1:23:37] is placed upon you. Now watch David. He
[1:23:40] goes straight into the sixth verse and
[1:23:43] brings dominion in.
[1:23:46] Thou hath [screaming] madeth him to have
[1:23:48] dominion.
[1:23:50] Oh my.
[1:23:53] So there's more to it than me just
[1:23:55] living upon this earth and letting the
[1:23:57] devil whoop me real good every day of my
[1:23:59] life.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Thou hath notice thou madeth him man to
[1:24:09] have dominion over the works of thy
[1:24:11] hands. Listen, keep in mind the works of
[1:24:13] thy hands. Thou [screaming] ma thou hast
[1:24:15] put all things under his feet. Not
[1:24:18] Christ's feet, your feet.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; They ain't [screaming] one sick person
[1:24:27] and one problem should leave here today.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; After this kind of subject there, there
[1:24:33] should be much power upon the kingdom
[1:24:36] life.
[1:24:42] So who has dominion?
[1:24:47] I'm asking y'all can speak now. I'm
[1:24:49] asking y'all the question. Who has
[1:24:51] dominion?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; That's about five people out of 500.
[1:24:56] What about the other 490? What y'all
[1:24:58] got?
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Who has dominion?
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; We do.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; That's about 15. Maybe if I go on a few
[1:25:08] more minutes on it, maybe all of y'all
[1:25:10] have dominion.
[1:25:12] Do you understand what God has given
[1:25:14] you?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question this way then.
[1:25:22] When a storm takes and hits a tornado,
[1:25:24] the Helen come through Irwin as I looked
[1:25:26] at it when I come down through this
[1:25:27] morning. Let me ask you a question. Did
[1:25:29] God do that?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; He allowed it.
[1:25:35] Did God send ISIS out there to do kill
[1:25:38] three almost 3,000 people in 2001?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; He allows it, but he didn't do it.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells me in Romans 8:22 that
[1:25:56] it tells me that this earth is subject
[1:25:58] to toils and groanings and travailing.
[1:26:01] Why? It's wanting a new body. And the
[1:26:04] only way this earth is going to get a
[1:26:06] new body, [screaming] a new house, a new
[1:26:07] habitation is for you
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; to realize you have dominionship. To
[1:26:14] realize [screaming] there's a glory
[1:26:15] that's supposed to be placed upon you.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Quit thinking you're taking something
[1:26:20] from [screaming] God.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; That's the problem with people in the
[1:26:24] message today. Well, I can't say
[1:26:26] nothing, but you know, I might be taking
[1:26:27] something from brother Brown. Come on,
[1:26:29] church.
[1:26:33] Brother Brand, I'm only trying to get us
[1:26:34] to understand [screaming] what God laid
[1:26:36] upon you and the value that lays in you
[1:26:38] people.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; It says it's in pain. It's rocking back
[1:26:48] and forth.
[1:26:50] There's flood ranged. Don't you
[1:26:51] understand what's happening there? It's
[1:26:53] it's travailing. [screaming] It's
[1:26:55] wanting it's wanting a new earth.
[1:26:58] Hebrews tells us that they cannot be
[1:27:01] perfect without
[1:27:03] us.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Then how you if you don't ever come to
[1:27:07] that, how you going to get them to it?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Somehow we've got to come to this. Well,
[1:27:23] I don't know about that. You know, you
[1:27:24] ain't read a quote yet.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said it was restored back
[1:27:38] to man through Christ.
[1:27:41] He says in the days of Abraham and then
[1:27:43] Orient the way they made a covenant.
[1:27:46] I'll read a quote so y'all know I'm
[1:27:48] still in the message.
[1:27:50] And they killed and split it in two just
[1:27:52] like you see a Abraham doing for God's
[1:27:55] covenant. They split the covenant in
[1:27:57] two. Then they write out their
[1:27:58] agreement. Then they take that and tear
[1:28:01] it apart. Give it one to this one and
[1:28:03] one to the other. And they take an oath
[1:28:05] over their dead this dead body. If they
[1:28:07] break this covenant, let them be as dead
[1:28:10] as the dead beast is. What an oath. And
[1:28:15] this this only way this covenant can be
[1:28:17] manifested is for both men to bring both
[1:28:20] pieces of paper.
[1:28:23] [panting and sighs]
[1:28:27] And they have to dovetail perfectly
[1:28:29] together just like that. And it confirms
[1:28:32] the oath. [screaming]
[1:28:34] Now what was God doing? He was showing
[1:28:36] Abraham how he was going to be the
[1:28:39] father of nations through Isaac and
[1:28:41] would come through Christ. And at
[1:28:43] Calvary, Jehovah God the Father taken
[1:28:45] his own son to Calvary, laid him upon it
[1:28:48] with sins and sickness of the world,
[1:28:50] tore him apart, took the body and the
[1:28:52] glory, and sent the Holy Ghost back down
[1:28:54] to the church. And when the resurrection
[1:28:57] comes, the same spirit that was in Jesus
[1:29:00] doing the same things that Jesus did
[1:29:02] when he was on earth has to be in the
[1:29:05] [screaming] church.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:17] The same spirit that was in Jesus doing
[1:29:20] the same things that Jesus did has to be
[1:29:24] in the [screaming] church. That's the
[1:29:26] covenant church. And when they come
[1:29:29] together, the same signs and same
[1:29:31] wonders that he did will have to compare
[1:29:33] with the body of Christ to be the bride.
[1:29:36] [screaming]
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; I'll read another just to convince you
[1:29:47] I'm still in the message.
[1:29:50] There is God's covenant. The light that
[1:29:52] was in Jesus was torn out of him and
[1:29:54] sent back to the church. And the light
[1:29:56] that was in Christ being in you, then
[1:29:59] Jesus, his word which he raised from the
[1:30:02] dead is living among us tonight doing
[1:30:04] the same things you did. Oh, but brother
[1:30:06] Tim, brother Brandon was on the earth
[1:30:07] then.
[1:30:09] That's why God can't do nothing for so
[1:30:11] many messes churches because they're
[1:30:13] waiting on brother Brown to come back
[1:30:14] and do it.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:20] [sighs]
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Then here's the way I see that. If we're
[1:30:24] having to wait on Brother Bam to come at
[1:30:26] what we have in church for, what we what
[1:30:27] we pray for the sick for, God ain't
[1:30:29] going to listen to our prayers anyway.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:30:32] [sighs]
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; it's a bunch of hogwash.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; That is not the kingdom life. God didn't
[1:30:39] give the kingdom life to one man.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; I know the quote you thinking about and
[1:30:44] people's going to hear it and I probably
[1:30:45] get emails from it, but [screaming]
[1:30:47] brother Banner said God could only use
[1:30:49] one man.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; I don't have time to preach on that
[1:30:54] today.
[1:30:59] [sighs]
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that Jesus said, "If you
[1:31:03] abide in me and my words in you, you can
[1:31:05] ask what you will and I'll give it to
[1:31:06] you." He said, "He that believeth in me,
[1:31:09] though he were dead, is yet shall he
[1:31:12] live. Whosoever liveth and believeth in
[1:31:14] me shall never die." He said, "That was
[1:31:16] the eternal purpose to the church. The
[1:31:19] works that I do shall you do, greater
[1:31:21] than this you do, cuz I go unto my
[1:31:23] father." That is the promise of God.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Ba makes a statement that is so
[1:31:30] critical.
[1:31:32] I don't know what I done with it.
[1:31:37] But I want okay brother said first is to
[1:31:40] express himself completely God in
[1:31:42] Christ. He said secondly he wants to
[1:31:45] have preements in the church which is
[1:31:47] his bride.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Thirdly he wants to restore the kingdom
[1:31:53] to you.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Now that should settle it right there.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't have to feud and fight over
[1:32:01] it no more. That right there should
[1:32:03] settle it. Thirdly, he wants to restore
[1:32:06] the kingdom to its [screaming]
[1:32:07] rightfully place where they fail by sin.
[1:32:11] God didn't fall from sin, Adam did.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; So, I'm the one that's going to get the
[1:32:17] kingdom life back.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; You're the one that's going to get the
[1:32:20] kingdom life back. There's power in the
[1:32:23] kingdom life. He said, "Oh, back to
[1:32:26] where he walked in the [screaming] cool
[1:32:28] of the evening
[1:32:31] and talked and fellowship with Adam."
[1:32:34] How many knows what the word cool means
[1:32:35] there?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Y'all want me to tell you?
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Spirit
[1:32:44] don't mean cool like
[1:32:47] don't mean that
[1:32:54] the word actually means ruach
[1:32:58] spirit of God.
[1:33:03] What did brother Bam tell us the book of
[1:33:05] Joshua was for or Ephesians was? We know
[1:33:08] Joshua was placed in the Old Testament.
[1:33:10] He said Ephesians is doing the same
[1:33:12] identical thing taking the people back
[1:33:14] to what they had originally.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Then the kingdom that I or the dominion
[1:33:21] that I lost or the domain that I lost
[1:33:24] and the glory that I lost and the honor
[1:33:27] that I lost. You mean to tell me I've
[1:33:29] got all [screaming] that stuff?
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; It's mine. He gave it to me.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; I just got to get [screaming] it back.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; It's God's covenant life, church. Don't
[1:33:45] say life tabernacle.
[1:33:48] Oh, I know we're not used to this kind
[1:33:50] of stuff, but it'll be all right. Notice
[1:33:52] thou madeth him to have dominion over
[1:33:54] the works of thy hands. The works of thy
[1:33:56] hands. Thou hast put all things under
[1:33:58] his feet. All sheep, oxen, yay, the
[1:34:00] beast of the field, the fowl of the air,
[1:34:01] the fish of the sea, whatsoever passes
[1:34:03] through the path of the ocean. Oh Lord
[1:34:06] our Lord, [screaming] how excellent is
[1:34:07] thy name in the earth.
[1:34:11] Notice Hebrews 2:10. For it became him
[1:34:14] who whom all are all things by whom are
[1:34:17] all things in bringing many sons unto
[1:34:22] glory
[1:34:24] to make the captain of their salvation
[1:34:26] perfect through sufferings.
[1:34:32] [sighs]
[1:34:34] When God created the heavens and the
[1:34:36] earth,
[1:34:38] God never intended for the earth to
[1:34:45] God never intended for the earth to run
[1:34:47] separate from heaven.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus, listen friends, Jesus preaches
[1:34:56] about the kingdom continually. It must
[1:34:59] be a pretty important subject.
[1:35:03] He never intended for [screaming] the
[1:35:05] earth to operate separate from heaven.
[1:35:08] He intended for the earth to be governed
[1:35:10] like the heaven was governed.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Read Matthew 6.
[1:35:20] Don't let this confuse you because I'm
[1:35:22] going to say it fast and don't ask me
[1:35:23] say it again because I can't.
[1:35:26] [sighs]
[1:35:28] God made an invisible realm for an
[1:35:31] invisible God.
[1:35:36] Invisible does not pertain to the
[1:35:38] object.
[1:35:41] It pertains to the subject.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Listen carefully.
[1:35:48] It does not mean that the object is
[1:35:50] there.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; It just means that your or it does not
[1:35:57] mean that the object is not there. It
[1:35:59] means that your eyes can't see it.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brown can make a
[1:36:07] statement. There's planes and trains and
[1:36:09] all kind of things and cars going right
[1:36:11] through this building. Now, I preached a
[1:36:14] funeral the other day,
[1:36:16] and I hadn't had a there hasn't been a
[1:36:19] funeral preached in my church since
[1:36:22] 1992,
[1:36:25] cuz normally it's at the uh funeral
[1:36:27] home, but this particular one wanted it.
[1:36:30] He had got with me years ago and said,
[1:36:32] "If when the Lord takes me," cuz he had
[1:36:34] cancer, was in bad shape. He said, "When
[1:36:36] the Lord takes me, if he don't heal me,"
[1:36:38] he said, "I want the funeral to be in
[1:36:40] the church." That's where he's been all
[1:36:41] his life. I said, "Okay, we'll do that."
[1:36:43] So, we had [clears throat] it in the
[1:36:45] church and he all his friends are there,
[1:36:48] his family's there. I mean, it's
[1:36:50] something else. It was packed probably
[1:36:52] 150 to 160, 70 people in the church. We
[1:36:55] was packed inside, outside the vestibu
[1:36:58] down the halls. They were packed on the
[1:36:59] pool pit. They were packed everywhere.
[1:37:02] And I made that statement right there.
[1:37:06] Boy, did I get some looks.
[1:37:11] But I wasn't preaching to all them
[1:37:12] people I knew that didn't believe
[1:37:13] nothing.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; I was preaching to the ones that go to
[1:37:16] my church.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; I can't help it. The rest of them would
[1:37:20] just to be sitting there.
[1:37:22] They had no idea because they they can't
[1:37:26] get out of the realm that they're
[1:37:27] actually in. They don't know how to get
[1:37:30] in the realm of God.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened to the church
[1:37:34] world. They don't know how to get in the
[1:37:36] realm out of this world. They don't know
[1:37:38] how to step from here. They go to church
[1:37:40] and all this and they sat there. I had
[1:37:42] the privilege,
[1:37:44] first time in my life, y'all gonna laugh
[1:37:47] at me when I tell you
[1:37:50] I went to mass Wednesday morning.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:38:01] [snorts]
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I can't believe I did it either.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps]
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; I'm working on this church. Well, I got
[1:38:10] one more day on it. It's humongous. I
[1:38:12] was showing brother brother uh uh Scott
[1:38:15] the pictures and what we was doing to
[1:38:17] it.
[1:38:19] And the late the assistant principal,
[1:38:20] it's a big school, big church. The
[1:38:22] church itself to the ceilings is 110
[1:38:25] foot probably.
[1:38:27] I'm using 135 ft boom lift to get me up
[1:38:30] there to what I've got to do.
[1:38:34] So I had to go in to the vestibu and the
[1:38:36] church was up with the church door was
[1:38:37] closed. Normally it's open and I'd go in
[1:38:40] the vestibu there this particular
[1:38:42] morning which was Wednesday morning. I
[1:38:44] it wasn't open. So the lady down there
[1:38:46] she opened the door for me because she
[1:38:47] knew I've been working there and she let
[1:38:49] me in. We talked a few minutes and I
[1:38:51] said what's going on? I just curious.
[1:38:54] She said we having mass. You want to go
[1:38:57] in?
[1:39:01] Wow. is different.
[1:39:05] Put this way, I don't think I'll ever
[1:39:07] become Catholic.
[1:39:12] They can't get out of the realm that
[1:39:14] they're in.
[1:39:16] They can't step. They can't understand
[1:39:18] how can trains and planes and cars and
[1:39:20] all this be going through this. You
[1:39:21] would be surprised that message churches
[1:39:23] that don't understand this because they
[1:39:25] don't understand that faster dimension.
[1:39:31] So I made that statement the other day
[1:39:33] in my church one at a funeral and they
[1:39:35] says
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; and everybody's just looking like
[1:39:38] they're looking for the planes. They was
[1:39:41] looking for the trains. They was ducking
[1:39:42] hoping they weren't going to hit them.
[1:39:44] Why? Because they don't understand it's
[1:39:46] in a quicker a faster dimension. You're
[1:39:48] not able to see it. So the invisible the
[1:39:51] object doesn't mean that it's invisible.
[1:39:53] It's just invisible to me and you. Yeah.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; God's not invisible. He's invisible with
[1:40:01] this. But if you can get into the spirit
[1:40:02] of God [screaming] and climb into that
[1:40:04] realm, there's life in that kingdom.
[1:40:10] [sighs]
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that the invisible
[1:40:15] world is a is is the apparent world. The
[1:40:19] apparent world is the subject world.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Let me say it in another way if I can.
[1:40:27] [laughter]
[1:40:28] The things that has been made was made
[1:40:30] out of things not seen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:40:40] I'm going home in a minute.
[1:40:41] [sighs and gasps]
[1:40:43] In other words, the things that you
[1:40:45] can't see is more real than the pew that
[1:40:47] you're sitting [laughter] on.
[1:40:50] The things that your eye can't see is
[1:40:52] more real than you sitting on that blue
[1:40:54] seat. You say, "But Tim, I know this
[1:40:56] seat's real." I do, too. I see that
[1:40:59] seat. But the things that's invisible,
[1:41:01] that's more realer than that. Because
[1:41:03] that'll burn one day. That'll be done
[1:41:05] away with one day. That'll fade one day.
[1:41:08] But what I'm talking about will never
[1:41:10] fade. It's the object that this eyes
[1:41:13] can't see. But it's something that's
[1:41:15] really there. If we could climb out of
[1:41:17] this realm and climb into that realm, we
[1:41:19] would say, "Oh my goodness, I can't
[1:41:22] believe this is here. I can't believe
[1:41:23] the power of God that's here. I can't
[1:41:26] believe the life of the kingdom."
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; But we come to church over and over and
[1:41:33] over and over
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; and never climb into that kingdom.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Why are we doing this?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown teaches [screaming] us
[1:41:50] there's a world that's just only feet
[1:41:52] from us.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I was caught up and I'm
[1:41:55] looking down no more than 8 foot upon my
[1:41:58] body."
[1:42:00] [sighs]
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; He's caught up in that other kingdom
[1:42:03] world.
[1:42:05] [sighs]
[1:42:06] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:42:08] [gasps]
[1:42:10] This eye can't pick up the image.
[1:42:13] [sighs]
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it's [screaming] there.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; If you look at the scriptures, you'll
[1:42:21] find out.
[1:42:23] [panting and sighs]
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; My goodness. Turn that clock back.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps]
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; If you watch the scriptures in the
[1:42:33] Bible, brother, sister, God, every now
[1:42:36] on him would allow the man of God to see
[1:42:39] that realm. Didn't happen often.
[1:42:44] Remember the scripture there? My mind
[1:42:46] goes straightly to to Elisha and
[1:42:48] Gahhesa. And Gahesa makes a statement,
[1:42:51] there's more of us [screaming] than
[1:42:52] there are them.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; What if it had been me? I'd have said,
[1:42:56] Elisha, you crazy.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; [sighs and panting]
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; There's more here [screaming] than they
[1:43:02] are with there's more with me and you
[1:43:04] than there are with them. And Jesus
[1:43:07] says, "What are you talking about, man?"
[1:43:10] And God and And Elisha says, "Lord, open
[1:43:13] the boy's eyes."
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:43:16] if God could [screaming] come and walk
[1:43:18] every pew and open our eyes,
[1:43:21] [panting and sighs]
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; we would see things we've never seen.
[1:43:25] Amen.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; We would walk out this church different
[1:43:29] than we've ever walked out before.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] [panting and sighs]
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Why? There's power in kingdom life. And
[1:43:36] that kingdom life is in the body of
[1:43:38] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:42] Open his eyes. So God made the invisible
[1:43:46] realm
[1:43:48] for the invisible God.
[1:43:51] [sighs]
[1:43:51] [gasps]
[1:43:54] The Bible says, "The heavens is for God.
[1:43:56] The earth is for the sons of men."
[1:44:01] So God made the earth a visible
[1:44:03] expression of an invisible heaven.
[1:44:06] [sighs]
[1:44:10] Then he made man an invisible a visible
[1:44:13] expression of an invisible God.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And he placed him in church.
[1:44:19] He placed him on this earth that we
[1:44:20] could return back to what we had before.
[1:44:23] You mean to tell me one time I had
[1:44:25] glory? One time I had honor, one time I
[1:44:28] had dominionship. Yes, sir. We did. And
[1:44:31] then sin come and we lost it. But
[1:44:33] brother Brown tried [screaming] over and
[1:44:34] over and over for 50s something years to
[1:44:37] get the people to understand who they
[1:44:39] was.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Not just to go to church, not just to
[1:44:43] sit on a pew, but to know who they are.
[1:44:46] [screaming]
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:53] [sighs]
[1:44:55] [panting]
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown actually makes a statement
[1:44:58] here and he says, "God wanted [snorts]
[1:45:03] God wanted [screaming] to share his
[1:45:05] glory with man."
[1:45:09] [sighs]
[1:45:10] That'll bust your bubble, won't it?
[1:45:12] [snorts]
[1:45:14] Why? because he wanted the earth to be
[1:45:17] governed like the heavens was governed.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; What did he say in his prayer in s in
[1:45:23] Matthew 6:33?
[1:45:27] [panting]
[1:45:31] He placed Adam upon the earth and he
[1:45:32] said, "Adam, I'm going to give you this
[1:45:34] glory." Man, Adam's walking around with
[1:45:36] the glory of God upon him. He's walking
[1:45:39] around the garden of Eden with honor.
[1:45:41] He's walking around with dominion.
[1:45:42] Brother Mam said, "Adam could say tree
[1:45:44] be plugged up and I want you to be over
[1:45:46] here and a tree would jump by the
[1:45:47] ground, go over there and dig a hole and
[1:45:49] put itself in it." You say, "That's
[1:45:51] crazy." That's God.
[1:45:58] [snorts]
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Our Father, which art in heaven,
[1:46:04] hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[1:46:07] thy will be done.
[1:46:12] in earth as it is in heaven.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; So now he wants the visible to be like
[1:46:19] the invisible.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; He wants the visible church of God to be
[1:46:24] like the invisible God. God don't show
[1:46:26] himself just to anybody.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; God's not going to come down and show
[1:46:31] himself to the world. God don't show
[1:46:33] [screaming] off for people.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; He comes when you come through the door.
[1:46:38] this building there. There's nothing in
[1:46:40] this building until you come. Don't you
[1:46:42] get that, church?
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; It's just a beautiful building. I mean,
[1:46:46] it's just magnificent. But God's not
[1:46:48] here until you come.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:56] [sighs]
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; You think God sits on the pew here or
[1:47:01] gets in brother Donniey's seat back
[1:47:02] there and sets with his feet up on the
[1:47:04] table and says, "Well, I'm going to wait
[1:47:05] till Wednesday night till they get back.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; [panting and sighs]
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; One day this building if when the Lord
[1:47:13] comes back one day this is going to be
[1:47:15] burnt all up. This beautiful place will
[1:47:17] be gone and burnt.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; But you won't be you'll be gone. All
[1:47:22] right.
[1:47:25] [panting]
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; You won't you won't you won't be burnt
[1:47:27] like I'm talking about. You'll be burnt
[1:47:29] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:31] He'll come down and light a [screaming]
[1:47:33] fire and set something inside of you
[1:47:35] that you say, "Wow, what happened?"
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; That's what the church of the living God
[1:47:39] needs today. Why? Because the power of
[1:47:41] the kingdom life is still upon the
[1:47:43] earth. It's still in man. We've just
[1:47:46] lost our way. [screaming]
[1:47:51] [sighs and gasps]
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; He places Adam on the earth and crowns
[1:47:57] him with the only thing. What's he
[1:47:58] doing? He crowns Adam with the only
[1:48:01] thing he's got,
[1:48:03] his glory.
[1:48:05] [gasps] God didn't have four or five
[1:48:07] houses to give him.
[1:48:12] He didn't give him three or four
[1:48:13] Cadillacs.
[1:48:15] He didn't say, "I got a thousand acres
[1:48:17] of land over. Adam, that's yours." God
[1:48:19] didn't do all that. God gave him what he
[1:48:21] had, and that was his glory.
[1:48:26] and said, "Now, Adam, operate it."
[1:48:32] Brother Brown said, "Adam could be
[1:48:33] walking through and Eve would be cold
[1:48:35] after a little wind chill would come
[1:48:36] through." And he said, Adam would say,
[1:48:38] "When be still now, Eve's a little
[1:48:42] chilly today."
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Why? He's operating it like God was
[1:48:47] operating the heaven.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; That was a kingdom there. This was a
[1:48:52] kingdom here. This kingdom was made off
[1:48:53] of that kingdom. How you think Moses
[1:48:56] built the the ark of the the the the the
[1:48:58] tabernacle in the wilderness from what
[1:49:00] he saw in heaven? He saw it there,
[1:49:02] brother John, and then come down here
[1:49:04] and made it. He wanted that kingdom down
[1:49:06] here. And God said, "Ooperate the
[1:49:08] kingdom." And then sin came into the
[1:49:11] garden and now Adam cannot operate
[1:49:13] nothing. He says, "Peace be still." And
[1:49:16] the wind still blows. He says, "Don't
[1:49:18] rain today. We want to take a little
[1:49:19] evening stroll through the cool of the
[1:49:21] garden." And the spirit of God not there
[1:49:23] anymore. And Adam says, "Oh my,
[1:49:25] [screaming] what's happened?" And God
[1:49:27] says, "Adam, Adam, where art thou? What
[1:49:29] have you done?"
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; I was reading last night. Brother B
[1:49:38] says, "And Adam, God used to take Adam
[1:49:41] arm in arm and walk through the cool,
[1:49:45] [sighs and gasps]
[1:49:46] walk in the spirit of fellowship."
[1:49:50] He said, "But now Adam stands there and
[1:49:52] none of this is happening. He's not able
[1:49:54] to operate it anymore. He's wondering
[1:49:56] what has happened.
[1:49:59] [sighs and gasps]
[1:50:00] He runs him out to the garden gate
[1:50:05] and actually God goes out the gate with
[1:50:07] him.
[1:50:11] Brother said he was in a part of his
[1:50:13] rest from the seventh day. The Bible
[1:50:15] says he rested which is a part of the
[1:50:17] millennial reign.
[1:50:19] And now God opens the gate and runs out
[1:50:22] of them out. And God goes out with him
[1:50:24] and puts the millennium on hold.
[1:50:27] Why?
[1:50:29] Why? Because the church has got to get
[1:50:31] back the kingdom.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:37] God's just waiting on me and you.
[1:50:40] [panting]
[1:50:41] We're not waiting on God, Brother
[1:50:42] Freddy. God's waiting on us. Amen.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Well, if I can get them to understand,
[1:50:48] he says, if I can get them to see that
[1:50:50] the kingdom life has power in it, if I
[1:50:52] can get them to see that this and this
[1:50:54] and this,
[1:50:59] [sighs]
[1:51:03] don't you realize when Jesus dies, St.
[1:51:06] John 6 there, the Bible says he less,
[1:51:08] who do men say I am?
[1:51:11] Well, some say thou art this and some
[1:51:13] say thou art this and some says you're
[1:51:15] this and some says you. He said, 'I'm
[1:51:17] not concerned about who everybody thinks
[1:51:18] I am. I want to know what you think
[1:51:20] about me, Peter.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Peter says, "Well, [panting]
[1:51:27] I believe thou art the son of the living
[1:51:30] God."
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Would it?
[1:51:34] Peter, flesh and blood didn't reveal
[1:51:35] this, but my father which was in heaven.
[1:51:39] Why? He's setting up his kingdom.
[1:51:44] He's now started his kingdom.
[1:51:47] Jesus, when he went to Calvary, he died.
[1:51:52] [panting and sighs]
[1:51:53] He was put in a grave.
[1:51:58] He did not have the keys.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; He only had the keys to death and hell
[1:52:05] because he give the keys to Peter.
[1:52:13] He gave the keys to Peter. All he had
[1:52:16] was the keys to the to to death and
[1:52:19] hell.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; But now Peter [screaming] has the
[1:52:22] ability to unlock it.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; The revelation has now come to Peter.
[1:52:28] You mean I'm part of the kingdom?
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; So Peter now is carrying around the
[1:52:33] kingdom life upon the earth.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Why? God is restoring the kingdom life.
[1:52:37] Then
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:52:41] God's restoring it. What's he been doing
[1:52:43] for 2,000 years? Restoring the kingdom
[1:52:46] life.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Restoring the kingdom life.
[1:52:58] [sighs]
[1:52:59] I told brother Scott this morning, I
[1:53:01] said, I don't I don't understand God
[1:53:03] sometimes.
[1:53:09] Sometimes I pray and pray and pray and
[1:53:11] can't get a prayer off the ground.
[1:53:13] [sighs]
[1:53:14] My wife's been through. [gasps]
[1:53:18] [snorts]
[1:53:19] She's been through hell on earth since
[1:53:22] September the second. Two strokes,
[1:53:26] [panting and sighs]
[1:53:27] [gasps]
[1:53:28] my beautiful queen. Two strokes.
[1:53:32] [sighs]
[1:53:34] [panting and gasps]
[1:53:34] Now, she stepped off of a little step
[1:53:36] stool the other day, two weeks ago, and
[1:53:40] fell and really jammed her leg up
[1:53:42] through. Now, for two weeks, she has had
[1:53:46] a nerve problem down through here. She
[1:53:48] can't even get out of bed. She can't
[1:53:49] move. She can't move her body. She can't
[1:53:51] go to work. She can't even go to church.
[1:53:55] I have laid hands on her I don't know
[1:53:57] how many times. I prayed for her I don't
[1:54:00] know how many times. [sighs and gasps]
[1:54:03] And I said, "God, I don't know what to
[1:54:04] do anymore."
[1:54:07] And I'm behind the pull pit preaching
[1:54:08] the kingdom life and the the dominion
[1:54:10] ship and the glory and honor.
[1:54:13] [panting and sighs] I know just barely a
[1:54:14] glimpse of what brother Ram was talking
[1:54:16] about when the devil come to him about
[1:54:18] his little daughter and his wife. I
[1:54:19] don't understand everything that Brother
[1:54:20] Ram understood. I'm not claiming to know
[1:54:22] and don't pretend to know. I'm saying I
[1:54:23] can barely just see a little glimpse
[1:54:25] where you preaching and preaching and
[1:54:26] preaching, preaching, preaching,
[1:54:27] preaching, preaching and it seems like
[1:54:28] you can't get a prayer through. But yet
[1:54:31] somebody else will call and say, "Hey,
[1:54:32] can you pray for this?" And God will
[1:54:33] move like that.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Had a lady call me the other day. She
[1:54:40] said, "Brother Tim, she said, "I I
[1:54:41] really got faith in your prayer. I need
[1:54:43] you to pray for my daughter-in-law.
[1:54:45] She's got twins."
[1:54:49] And said, uh,
[1:54:52] said, "I [snorts] need you to really
[1:54:53] pray."
[1:54:55] She's not even asking her church to
[1:54:57] pray. Now, somebody else may. She
[1:55:00] didn't. I said, "I'd be more than happy
[1:55:02] to, sis." She said, "One of the twins,
[1:55:06] their intestines is so tight and so
[1:55:08] small that the baby's going to die. One
[1:55:12] of them's going to live, one's going to
[1:55:13] die." She said, "So, the doctors is
[1:55:15] trying to get my daughter-in-law to let
[1:55:18] them go up, go in her with a laser and
[1:55:22] kill the one baby that's going to die so
[1:55:25] it don't kill the other baby or harm the
[1:55:27] la the mother." says, and that's what
[1:55:30] we're battling with. Said the baby can't
[1:55:31] live. Said there's something with his
[1:55:33] intestines that's all has been out of
[1:55:35] shape and it ain't going to make it. So,
[1:55:37] she called me and I said, "I'll be glad
[1:55:39] to pray."
[1:55:41] So, I go before God and praying, just
[1:55:43] praying and praying and praying.
[1:55:45] [panting]
[1:55:46] And I got the call two weeks ago and
[1:55:48] said, "The baby's fine living good."
[1:55:51] And I said, [applause]
[1:55:57] "That's nothing I did. I just don't
[1:55:59] understand. God, why don't you touch my
[1:56:01] wife?"
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; I'm watching her suffer every day. I
[1:56:05] watch her can't get out of bed. I watch
[1:56:07] her. She can't walk through the house. I
[1:56:09] watch her can't go to church. She can't
[1:56:10] go to work. She can't go to the store.
[1:56:12] She can't go out and eat. She can't do
[1:56:13] nothing.
[1:56:16] And I've laid h hands on her I don't
[1:56:18] know how many times.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:21] And it's like it's dry, brother.
[1:56:25] I mean, I can't even hear him.
[1:56:28] I'm wondering if he's hearing me.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; I can't explain it.
[1:56:38] [panting and gasps]
[1:56:40] But I'm still preaching the kingdom.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah.
[1:56:50] I'm still going to preach that I've got
[1:56:52] dominion.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; I'm still going to preach there's a
[1:56:55] glory upon the body of Christ's head.
[1:56:58] There's an [screaming] honor upon them.
[1:56:59] I'm still going to preach it hard as
[1:57:01] I've ever preached it.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it. Yeah.
[1:57:16] [sighs and gasps]
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; He puts his glory on Adam.
[1:57:20] And it what it means is when Adam would
[1:57:22] speak to the earth,
[1:57:25] it would have the same effect
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; as if God spoke.
[1:57:33] Oh, church, we ain't getting it. Adam
[1:57:36] would speak to the earth and it would
[1:57:38] listen to him and have the same effect
[1:57:40] as if God stood there and said it.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, why can't we see it? [gasps]
[1:57:48] [sighs]
[1:57:53] Let me find a place to close.
[1:57:56] [sighs and panting]
[1:57:58] [snorts]
[1:58:01] I do want to say I sure do want to come
[1:58:02] back and finish this though. Wow, man.
[1:58:05] This is so good. Let me say this right
[1:58:07] here.
[1:58:10] So, what Adam would say, because I'm
[1:58:11] going to show you something just for a
[1:58:12] second. Just give me
[1:58:15] how many give me five minutes.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40.
[1:58:25] So, y'all just gave me to 130.
[1:58:29] [panting] That's an old Pentecostal
[1:58:31] trick.
[1:58:33] Brother Donnie knows about that trick.
[1:58:36] So, what Adam would say when he would
[1:58:38] speak to the earth, this is so deep,
[1:58:41] friends. I would I'm going to tell you,
[1:58:43] this is so deep. It's so powerful. And I
[1:58:45] knew I couldn't finish it. But Adam
[1:58:47] would speak to the earth. Cuz what Adam
[1:58:50] would say, listen to this, had weight.
[1:58:54] Wii Ght.
[1:58:56] W E I G H. Is that how you spell wait? W
[1:59:00] E I G HT. When Adam spoke, let there be.
[1:59:05] I want this here. When be still. The
[1:59:08] earth listened to Adam's voice. Because
[1:59:10] what Adam said had weight. Do you know
[1:59:12] why it had weight?
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz the word glory in the book of
[1:59:16] Genesis means weight.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:21] Yes.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; So God put [screaming] weight
[1:59:28] on Adam.
[1:59:30] And why why you think brother Brown made
[1:59:32] a statement that policeman can stand out
[1:59:33] there and they'll run all over him. But
[1:59:34] if he'll just pull that coat back and
[1:59:36] show that badge,
[1:59:38] [screaming]
[1:59:38] they'll have a 100 car pileup wreck
[1:59:40] stopping. Why? Cuz he's got weight
[1:59:42] behind him.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; All he's got to do is hold the hand up,
[1:59:48] show the badge, and blow the whistle.
[1:59:50] and everybody's [screaming]
[1:59:51] coming to a screeching halt.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing with God. God put
[1:59:56] weight upon Adam. When Adam spoke, he
[2:00:00] would get godly results. Though he was a
[2:00:02] man [screaming] on earth,
[2:00:04] [sighs and gasps]
[2:00:06] he was crowned. The word means he was
[2:00:09] crowned with weight. In other words,
[2:00:12] when Adam would speak, God would get
[2:00:14] behind what he said [screaming] and make
[2:00:15] it happen. It wasn't Adam doing it. It
[2:00:18] was God [screaming] making it happen
[2:00:20] because there was weight behind Adam's
[2:00:22] words. There's weights behind your
[2:00:25] words. There's weights behind Word of
[2:00:27] Life's words if you will believe.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[2:00:39] [panting]
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Notice in closing
[2:00:42] musicians come I'll prove I'm closing.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[2:00:48] [snorts]
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Notice Adam stood there and Adam called
[2:00:51] it what he wanted to call it. I want you
[2:00:54] to be a oak tree. I want you to be a
[2:00:57] pine tree. I want you to be a lion. I
[2:01:00] want you to be a tiger. You a deer. You
[2:01:02] a buck. You a dough. You this. Why?
[2:01:04] Because he's got weight behind what he's
[2:01:06] saying. God's put a glory upon him. And
[2:01:10] now he's speaking that glory. And God
[2:01:13] said, "Yep, that's the same thing I was
[2:01:15] thinking."
[2:01:17] Adam would say, "Oh, [snorts] I want
[2:01:19] that to be a horse. I want that to be a
[2:01:21] palamina. I want that to be this. I want
[2:01:23] this to be." And God says, "Yep. Same
[2:01:26] thing I was going to call him."
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Why? He's speaking God's language.
[2:01:37] I'm fixing to run.
[2:01:40] He's speaking God's language. What do we
[2:01:43] have to do? Speak God's language.
[2:01:46] If we don't learn to speak God's
[2:01:48] language, it ain't going to happen.
[2:01:53] [sighs]
[2:01:55] [panting]
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to speak his language.
[2:02:01] Waits behind what brother John says.
[2:02:03] When you speak his language, God says
[2:02:06] that's my son.
[2:02:09] and all he does is not it works.
[2:02:12] Children, every one of you can do this.
[2:02:16] Every one of y'all have the ability to
[2:02:18] do this.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; It's up to y'all. Or do we just want to
[2:02:22] continue to come to church for the next
[2:02:23] hundred years till we all die?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; We just want to continue coming to life
[2:02:28] tabernacle, Word of Life, all these
[2:02:30] other churches until we all fade off and
[2:02:32] die. Then our kids is here and our
[2:02:33] grandkids is here and our great
[2:02:34] grandkids is here and we're gone. No.
[2:02:39] I want the rapture to finish
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; because it's already in progress.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said the bottom of the page,
[2:02:46] Christ the mission of God. He said when
[2:02:48] the church and the people realize, he
[2:02:50] said, [screaming] when the bride
[2:02:50] realizes her position, the rapture will
[2:02:54] leave.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; It's not coming. Why? Because it's it's
[2:02:59] already [screaming] in here.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Do you realize the rapture is in this
[2:03:03] church this morning?
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes y'all to speak it.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together.
[2:03:24] [applause and cheering]
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps]
[2:03:40] [snorts]
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; When he spoke, he was crowned with a
[2:03:44] weight.
[2:03:46] Adam would speak [sighs]
[2:03:50] and God would stand behind him
[2:03:53] and make it come to pass just like that
[2:03:58] because he's crowned. The word glory in
[2:04:02] the Old Testament means weight. He's
[2:04:06] crowned him with weight.
[2:04:08] Don't you understand what y'all have
[2:04:10] now? Don't Don't you see why you're so
[2:04:12] valuable?
[2:04:14] But that the devil will get up on one
[2:04:16] shoulder, little angel get on the other
[2:04:17] shoulder. Ain't that how we always see
[2:04:19] it, ain't it? And the devil's whispers
[2:04:21] in the ear. Well, you ain't no good.
[2:04:23] [panting]
[2:04:24] You did this a long time ago.
[2:04:28] And the angel on this on his shoulder
[2:04:30] says, I don't pay no attention to him.
[2:04:32] Then this little devil on his shoulder
[2:04:33] come back and say, I remember when you
[2:04:35] did this 40 years ago. You made a
[2:04:39] mistake 40 years ago.
[2:04:44] And then we'll get to feeling sorry for
[2:04:46] oursel. I can't believe I did that 40
[2:04:48] years ago.
[2:04:50] You're worried about something 40 years
[2:04:52] ago and you claiming to be saved and
[2:04:53] born again this morning. What's wrong
[2:04:55] with y'all?
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; God looks at you and says, "What? What?"
[2:04:59] 40 years ago
[2:05:05] [panting]
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; you're crowned with weight.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Word of life, you are crowned with
[2:05:11] weight.
[2:05:13] Young people, you are crowned with
[2:05:14] weight. If you claim salvation and born
[2:05:18] again and converted and have the Holy
[2:05:20] Ghost, you are crowned with weight.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; You have a glory about you.
[2:05:30] [sighs]
[2:05:37] I wish I had three more hours.
[2:05:42] I'll be walking this in about two hours.
[2:05:47] You're crowned.
[2:05:49] You have dominionship.
[2:05:52] I've got quotes. I've got everything on
[2:05:54] it. [gasps]
[2:05:57] [sighs]
[2:05:58] Whatever Adam called it is what it was.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Let me you let me say this before I go
[2:06:09] because this is so good.
[2:06:12] [sighs]
[2:06:16] God never meant for his word
[2:06:19] to be used
[2:06:21] to just communicate.
[2:06:24] Let that sink in very, very slowly. Now
[2:06:27] listen to me. God never meant for his
[2:06:31] word to just be used to just
[2:06:35] communicate.
[2:06:38] God uses words to create.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Example,
[2:06:46] when God came on the earth in the form
[2:06:48] of Jesus Christ, of course,
[2:06:52] what did Jesus start doing?
[2:06:55] He didn't start working with his hands.
[2:06:57] I know you thought, well, he was a
[2:06:59] carpenter. Get that out of your mind.
[2:07:03] Look at the bigger picture. What did he
[2:07:05] start doing?
[2:07:08] Speaking.
[2:07:09] Everything he did, he spoke it.
[2:07:12] We could go through, I don't know how
[2:07:13] many instances in the Bible, everything
[2:07:15] he done, brother Harry, he spake it.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; the one man trying to get into the pool
[2:07:24] of Bethesda. So many people's gathered
[2:07:26] he can't even get nowhere near it.
[2:07:29] So he goes gets four buddies of his.
[2:07:32] They take him down there and they said,
[2:07:33] "We can't get in the door."
[2:07:37] So they climb up on top of the house.
[2:07:39] They must have been roofers.
[2:07:43] Thank God I'm a roofer now.
[2:07:46] They climb on top of the house and take
[2:07:48] some of the panels off and let the man
[2:07:49] down. And Jesus just happens to walk by.
[2:07:53] Jesus didn't touch him. Jesus didn't do
[2:07:54] nothing. Jesus said, "Take up your bed
[2:07:56] and walk." Why? He's now not just
[2:07:59] communicating with his disciples. He's
[2:08:01] now creating with his words. Why? He is
[2:08:05] the glory.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; He is the one that has the weight. He
[2:08:09] can give it to me and give it to you if
[2:08:11] he wants to.
[2:08:15] We just want to use words to talk.
[2:08:19] But we've got to think like God.
[2:08:24] [sighs]
[2:08:26] Faith calls things as though they were
[2:08:30] [sighs and gasps]
[2:08:30] as though they are.
[2:08:33] Faith don't look at it like I look at
[2:08:35] it. Faith don't look at it like y'all
[2:08:38] look at it.
[2:08:40] I can see here, but faith looks behind
[2:08:43] that.
[2:08:46] That's the weight y'all carry.
[2:08:49] Now, you can leave today and you can go
[2:08:52] outside and take that weight off. It
[2:08:55] doesn't matter. It's up to y'all.
[2:08:58] I can go out that back door today, get
[2:09:00] in my car, take that weight off. I can
[2:09:01] say, "I ain't preaching no more. I'm
[2:09:03] done. I'm done.
[2:09:07] I can't get a prayer through. My wife
[2:09:09] ain't getting better. this ain't getting
[2:09:10] better. I can do that. I have the
[2:09:12] ability to do that if I want to do that.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Y'all have the ability to walk out and
[2:09:17] say, "Forget it."
[2:09:19] Or you can walk out and say, "You know
[2:09:22] what he said is in the Bible. It's in
[2:09:25] the message."
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; I've got weight with me.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; I come to church with it. I'm leaving
[2:09:31] with it. I'm going to work in the
[2:09:33] morning with it. I'm going wherever I
[2:09:35] got to go to Walmart or Kmart or
[2:09:37] whatever. I'm taking my weight with me.
[2:09:39] Amen.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; There's there's this book and this guy
[2:09:49] wrote this book. I can't [clears throat]
[2:09:50] think of his name at the moment.
[2:09:53] And he sees it basically. You would
[2:09:54] think he's a message believer.
[2:09:58] I mean, he just believes God for what he
[2:10:00] says. This guy just believes the Bible
[2:10:03] for what it says. He don't believe in a
[2:10:04] prophet. Don't know about a prophet.
[2:10:06] Don't know anything. But he just simply
[2:10:08] believes what the Bible says. Period.
[2:10:12] Claims Christianity, claims to be born
[2:10:14] again.
[2:10:16] [crying]
[2:10:17] If he's in a restaurant, if it don't
[2:10:19] matter where he is, he has
[2:10:23] if he feels a little leading coming on
[2:10:25] him, he'll just walk up to this person
[2:10:27] and say, "How you feel today, sir? Do
[2:10:30] you know Jesus?" And they'll start a
[2:10:32] conversation.
[2:10:34] and he'll say, "You feel okay?" And the
[2:10:37] guy, one instant says, "I've been having
[2:10:40] trouble in my back for weeks." He said,
[2:10:42] "Well, do you mind if I pray for you?"
[2:10:45] So, he'll pull him in close and pray for
[2:10:46] him. He gets through. He steps back. He
[2:10:48] says, "Now, he don't claim to be a
[2:10:49] prophet anything now. He's just a
[2:10:50] Christian." He says, "Do you feel any
[2:10:52] different?" And the guy says, "No." He
[2:10:55] says, "Let's pray again." He'll pray. He
[2:10:58] don't care how many times he'll stand
[2:10:59] there and pray
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; till he gets results.
[2:11:04] I'll get the name of the book and send
[2:11:05] it to somebody and y'all can get it.
[2:11:07] This book is powerful.
[2:11:09] He don't claim he don't believe he don't
[2:11:11] claim to believe in a prophet. He just
[2:11:13] simply believes the Bible.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Now, if he can do that, why can't y'all
[2:11:18] do that?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Why can't I do that? Because we
[2:11:22] complicate it.
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; We complicate that.
[2:11:31] We're standing on the streets of the
[2:11:32] courthouse the other day. We got a big
[2:11:36] courthouse, a brand new one here. Then
[2:11:38] we got our old courthouse over here.
[2:11:40] It's 150 years old. That's the job I've
[2:11:43] been on for two years doing all kind of
[2:11:45] work, copper work, crazy stuff. So I'm
[2:11:48] I'm hearing this music, this young girl
[2:11:50] sing, and I'm on the back of the
[2:11:52] courthouse and I'm on the ground and I'm
[2:11:54] by myself and I'm watching all these
[2:11:56] guys work that I've got helping me
[2:11:59] and I'm hearing this gossip. I said,
[2:12:00] "Where's that coming from?" So, I walk
[2:12:02] around this side, go up Benson Street,
[2:12:03] and I walk and I see this little young
[2:12:04] girl. She's over just singing away. And
[2:12:07] I see another lady, older lady and
[2:12:09] another guy, and they're just witnesses
[2:12:11] and talking to people. I said, "Let's
[2:12:14] just see what happens."
[2:12:17] I'm nosy, I guess.
[2:12:19] So, I walk up there and cross the street
[2:12:21] and I said, "Well, I'll just act like
[2:12:22] I'm walking by looking at my work."
[2:12:26] And the guys is up there working. And I
[2:12:28] walk over and I stand back and I'm just
[2:12:30] looking. Man, it's pretty looking good.
[2:12:32] And this lady makes her way. I seen her
[2:12:34] coming out of the corner of my eye. She
[2:12:36] makes her way over to where I'm at.
[2:12:38] Hello, sir. I says, well, how are you
[2:12:39] doing, ma'am? She says,
[2:12:43] "You doing all right?" I said, "Yes,
[2:12:44] ma'am." She says, "What are you looking
[2:12:47] at?"
[2:12:49] I said, "All that work, that copper up
[2:12:51] there." She says, "Oh." She says, "Do
[2:12:53] you like it?" I says, "I did that. She
[2:12:57] said, "Oh, this is you." I said, "Yes."
[2:12:59] She said, "Oh, okay. That's beautiful."
[2:13:02] She said, "You need anything today?"
[2:13:07] I said, "Yeah, I need actually quite a
[2:13:09] lot."
[2:13:10] She said, "Do you mind me praying for
[2:13:13] you?"
[2:13:15] I said, "Nah, pray all you want to."
[2:13:18] Now, I know that ain't gonna go over
[2:13:19] with a lot of messes, folks. Well, now
[2:13:20] she's a woman. She can't pray. Oh, y'all
[2:13:23] goodness. Yeah. Yeah. Going to make me
[2:13:25] so mad.
[2:13:28] I said, "Pray away.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Pray away. I need whatever I can get."
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:36] So all of a sudden this man makes his
[2:13:38] way over and it was her husband. So me
[2:13:40] and her get him get to talking. He says,
[2:13:44] "You from around here?" I said, "Yes,
[2:13:45] sir." "All my life." He says, I said,
[2:13:47] "Where you from?" He said, "I'm from
[2:13:49] Rhode Island." I said, 'Wh in the world
[2:13:52] are you doing down here in a little town
[2:13:54] called Anderson?'
[2:13:58] He said, 'We down here praying for
[2:13:59] people?
[2:14:02] Any of y'all ever went on the street and
[2:14:03] prayed for people? Well, Brother Tim,
[2:14:04] that's not the time for that. We don't
[2:14:06] believe in that no more. See, that's the
[2:14:08] problem.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; We don't know how to be led of God
[2:14:12] anymore. Come on.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; I stood there two and a half hours
[2:14:20] witnessing and talking to people. That's
[2:14:22] something I don't do. Now, I love to
[2:14:24] talk, but I'm not going to go on the
[2:14:27] streets and do it. But that day, I stood
[2:14:30] there two and a half hours talking to
[2:14:32] these people that's coming by. Me and
[2:14:34] him's just a talking and I just kind of
[2:14:36] watching out of corner. She comes up to
[2:14:37] another couple, lays hands on them.
[2:14:39] Another couple, she lays hands on them.
[2:14:41] She's laying hands on everybody.
[2:14:51] And that guy looks at me again. He says,
[2:14:53] [clears throat]
[2:14:54] "Tell me what you think the problem is
[2:14:57] today." I says, "How long you got?"
[2:15:02] He said, "I feel like we need a revival
[2:15:04] in the church. I feel like we need a
[2:15:06] revival. We need this in the church." I
[2:15:08] says, "Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho.
[2:15:11] I said, 'You asked, so I'm going to tell
[2:15:12] you.
[2:15:14] I stood there another hour.
[2:15:17] I don't know what he thought about it,
[2:15:19] but we walked away shaking hands, so it
[2:15:21] couldn't have been too bad.
[2:15:24] But I'm thinking, that's what the world
[2:15:26] needs. They want to see something they
[2:15:28] don't see.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; They don't see it nowhere.
[2:15:33] But y'all can show it to them.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; If you're just led by the Holy Ghost,
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; if you're just led, I was in the store
[2:15:44] the other day and I was sitting there
[2:15:45] eating and this young boy come up, comes
[2:15:47] up to me and I noticed I'm watching and
[2:15:49] I thought, does he know me or what? Cuz
[2:15:51] I didn't have I was out of town. I know
[2:15:53] he didn't know me. And he's looking at
[2:15:54] me. He's sitting in a booth. He comes
[2:15:56] over at me. He said, "Hey, sir." I said,
[2:15:59] "Hey, man." And I stood up.
[2:16:02] When I stood up,
[2:16:05] there's something different about you.
[2:16:07] And I just stand there. I throw my hand
[2:16:09] out and go to shake his hand. I don't
[2:16:10] know who in the world he was.
[2:16:12] He says, "I just feel like I need to hug
[2:16:15] you." Now, I'm I'm picky about people
[2:16:17] hugging me. I don't want people hugging
[2:16:19] me. I'll hug you. [laughter]
[2:16:22] I don't want strangers hugging me. And
[2:16:25] I'm sitting and I didn't know what to
[2:16:26] do. It caught me off guard. He says,
[2:16:28] "I'd love to hug you." And I says, I
[2:16:30] didn't know. I said, "Are you you know
[2:16:32] you [laughter]
[2:16:33] whoa now? Wo meal wo meal."
[2:16:39] He said, "I just feel like I need to hug
[2:16:40] you." And I says, "Me and him just
[2:16:43] embraced young boy." And he turn around,
[2:16:46] he says, "Thank you for that.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know what he needed,
[2:16:52] but the world's hunting something."
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; And they don't know where to get it.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Cuz the church, they can't get it.
[2:17:00] Cuz what the church has ain't changing
[2:17:02] them.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; And it's not going to change their
[2:17:05] bodies.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; But what y'all got is very valuable.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; What all y'all got is very, very
[2:17:14] valuable.
[2:17:16] Hold on dear to it.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Give me a G, Brother Harry.
[2:17:23] Let's sing Brother Donny's old song. I
[2:17:25] was on the mountain.
[2:17:28] I was wondering
[2:17:31] from the fountain. If I can get it out.
[2:17:33] When I heard my savior
[2:17:37] speak to me, [music] he said, [singing]
[2:17:41] "Won't come to me relenting."
[2:17:45] And [music] of your sins repented.
[2:17:49] Listen now. And I will lead [music] you
[2:17:52] out so you can see. Sing it now. Well,
[2:17:58] and I'm [music]
[2:18:01] so glad he [singing] found. Oh yes, I
[2:18:05] am. Oh, he bound me.
[2:18:10] He put his arms around me
[2:18:15] and he led me to the shelter. [singing]
[2:18:22] [music]
[2:18:24] Now I'm one of
[2:18:27] his own. [music]
[2:18:30] Aren't you glad that you're hes
[2:18:34] [music and singing]
[2:18:40] with my heart of glory? [music]
[2:18:44] Someday
[2:18:47] I'm going [singing]
[2:18:49] to my home. [music]
[2:18:53] Home of glory.
[2:18:56] [music]
[2:18:58] I'm going to walk on streets paid
[2:19:02] paint paid with gold.
[2:19:04] [music and singing]
[2:19:06] He said now I will love him
[2:19:10] [music and singing] ever. I'm going to
[2:19:12] stray from him. No, never.
[2:19:16] Because he's [music and singing]
[2:19:17] the dearest friend that I ever knew.
[2:19:23] [music] He said, "Now when I see him
[2:19:27] yonder, my [music and singing] love,
[2:19:31] still go fonder
[2:19:34] in that happy [singing] home beyond
[2:19:38] the blue.
[2:19:42] And I'm
[2:19:44] [singing]
[2:19:45] [music] so glad he found." Oh yes, I am.
[2:19:50] I love he found me. [music]
[2:19:53] He put his arms [singing] around me
[2:19:58] and said [music] he led me to the
[2:20:04] shelter.
[2:20:06] M.
[2:20:07] [music] Now I'm one of [singing]
[2:20:11] his.
[2:20:12] Oh,
[2:20:16] I know [singing]
[2:20:20] the joy [music] I'm knowing
[2:20:24] in my heart of glowing.
[2:20:28] Someday [music] I am going [singing]
[2:20:32] to my home. [music]
[2:20:36] Home [singing] up in glory.
[2:20:41] I'm going to walk on streets, baby. Yes,
[2:20:45] I am
[2:20:46] [music] with gold.
[2:20:50] [singing]
[2:20:54] Brother Brown said, "God,
[2:20:58] now this is so powerful."
[2:21:01] He said, "God
[2:21:03] is depending on you." Amen.
[2:21:07] &gt;&gt; The creator
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; is depending on y'all.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Do we understand the depth of that? Do
[2:21:17] we understand the value of that? God is
[2:21:21] depending.
[2:21:23] The God of heaven, the God of the
[2:21:25] universe, the God of glory is depending
[2:21:27] on me. Little old me.
[2:21:31] &gt;&gt; He's depending on y'all.
[2:21:35] Amen.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, if we could ever catch that. If we
[2:21:41] could ever catch that.
[2:21:45] [sighs]
[2:21:47] Almighty God,
[2:21:51] Lord Jesus,
[2:21:54] help us today.
[2:21:57] Lord, I've delivered what I felt that
[2:21:59] you laid there on my heart this week.
[2:22:03] [snorts]
[2:22:04] studied every night.
[2:22:08] I've delivered for the only way I know
[2:22:10] how. I'm I'm not smart.
[2:22:13] [snorts] I'm not educated,
[2:22:17] but I do believe his word.
[2:22:20] [snorts] Lord, take these words today,
[2:22:24] Lord. I pray that you'll place them in
[2:22:27] every heart.
[2:22:29] Take what was said Lord
[2:22:32] and may they accept it Lord and receive
[2:22:35] it.
[2:22:37] The word receive is possessed.
[2:22:41] Possessing, take possession. Re is the
[2:22:44] prefix which is again
[2:22:49] God let them receive
[2:22:52] what they have need of today.
[2:22:56] Jesus
[2:22:58] breathe on them
[2:23:01] and they received.
[2:23:03] God breathe on this church this morning.
[2:23:09] And may they receive
[2:23:12] what they need.
[2:23:15] If there's any here sick, Lord,
[2:23:18] if there's any here with problems and
[2:23:21] needing this or that, whatever,
[2:23:24] God, would you help them to receive
[2:23:28] what they need today?
[2:23:31] Would you hear me today, Lord?
[2:23:38] Almighty God,
[2:23:43] [sighs]
[2:23:44] as we stand here today, Lord, [snorts]
[2:23:49] I'm going to ask each person just to lay
[2:23:51] their hands up on someone close to them,
[2:23:54] their wife or another brother, sister to
[2:23:57] sister.
[2:23:59] I want to I want this church today to
[2:24:02] pray for my wife.
[2:24:05] I want them to pray for the needs of the
[2:24:07] people in this church today.
[2:24:10] I want each one here today to pray for
[2:24:12] someone else in this church. And I'm
[2:24:15] putting my wife in the mix today.
[2:24:19] Father,
[2:24:22] Lord, we've spoke thy word today.
[2:24:26] Lord, I didn't come up with this.
[2:24:30] I didn't write the promises.
[2:24:33] I didn't write the scriptures.
[2:24:36] [snorts]
[2:24:37] I didn't put the weight on Adam. I
[2:24:39] didn't put the glory on Adam and the
[2:24:40] dominionship. I didn't have nothing to
[2:24:42] do with that.
[2:24:44] But the creator of heavens and earth did
[2:24:46] that.
[2:24:49] And he said, "I'm going to let them
[2:24:51] operate this earth.
[2:24:54] I want them to operate this earth the
[2:24:56] way heaven is operated."
[2:25:00] And Lord, we stand with arm in arm, hand
[2:25:02] in hand today as children and sons and
[2:25:06] daughters of God.
[2:25:08] [snorts]
[2:25:09] And Lord, every need in this church
[2:25:11] today, God, I'm asking, Lord, they would
[2:25:13] receive what they have need of,
[2:25:16] if they're sick, Lord, may the Holy
[2:25:18] Spirit be mindful of them,
[2:25:23] God. [snorts] What if they have problems
[2:25:24] with this and the other and issues with
[2:25:27] this and whatever it is, it doesn't
[2:25:29] matter.
[2:25:31] Help this church to operate it.
[2:25:36] Help this church to operate this
[2:25:38] kingdom.
[2:25:40] The power of kingdom life in you,
[2:25:44] the church.
[2:25:47] [sighs]
[2:25:48] [snorts] Help us to operate it. Lord,
[2:25:52] I pray Lord for my wife today.
[2:25:55] I ask you, God, that the Holy Spirit
[2:25:58] would be mindful this morning that you
[2:26:01] would go to her wherever she would be
[2:26:03] lay in her standing right now.
[2:26:07] Father, as sons and daughters of God, we
[2:26:09] rebuke the devil.
[2:26:11] We rebuke his tactics.
[2:26:14] We rebuke the enemy.
[2:26:17] And God, we as children of God, we are
[2:26:20] going to operate the kingdom life now.
[2:26:23] Move in a mighty way upon every person,
[2:26:26] Lord. Every young person, whatever they
[2:26:28] need. I know those that's in school go
[2:26:31] through battles that I don't face. Per
[2:26:33] people go through battles that different
[2:26:35] people face. God, you know what they
[2:26:37] face. May we operate it this morning
[2:26:40] according to the word of God. It's not
[2:26:43] me doing it. It's not them doing it.
[2:26:44] It's Jesus Christ in the people doing
[2:26:47] it.
[2:26:49] I claim it this morning and they claim
[2:26:51] it this morning. Would you grant it,
[2:26:54] Father?
[2:26:59] Lord, there's people I know that's sick,
[2:27:01] Lord, in my hometown.
[2:27:03] In the name of Jesus, would you go meet
[2:27:05] with them, Lord?
[2:27:08] Father, may the Holy Spirit be mindful
[2:27:10] of them today.
[2:27:12] May we leave this place today closer to
[2:27:14] you, Lord.
[2:27:17] Lord, let us leave today a little closer
[2:27:19] to you.
[2:27:21] May we leave today learning a little bit
[2:27:23] more how to operate the kingdom life.
[2:27:29] Hallelujah.
[2:27:31] We thank you and appreciate you for the
[2:27:32] service that we've had today. Thank you
[2:27:35] for the people that's made their way.
[2:27:37] Lord, if they need anything today, may
[2:27:40] they believe it right now where they're
[2:27:42] sitting.
[2:27:43] If they need prayer, we'll do that. If
[2:27:45] they need hands laid on, whatever they
[2:27:47] need, I'm giving to the opportunity now.
[2:27:50] But if they just believe now, they can
[2:27:53] receive it where they stand
[2:27:55] that's operating the kingdom life.
[2:27:59] May you grant it, Lord, and hear the
[2:28:00] prayer of these people today. May you
[2:28:03] walk the aisles, Lord, in every pew in
[2:28:05] this church today.
[2:28:07] And may God you supply every need
[2:28:11] in the name of Jesus Christ, the son of
[2:28:13] God. And the church says,
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's say it again. And the church
[2:28:18] says,
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; Give him a hand clap of praise if you
[2:28:21] would. [applause]
