oppression sadness whatever it is one day they will bow at the name of Jesus I love to remind the devil of the scripture in the book of Isaiah they shall narrowly look upon thee and consider these saying is this the man to make the Nations to tremble he wants to be a God but God reminds him who he is God says also in the Book of Ezekiel he would lay him before Kings who were those kings be those who have met him in battle by the grace of God we have overcoming that's awesome and praise the Lord certainly welcome today in the house of the Lords of the presence of the Lord wish to extend to all of our mothers a happy Mother's Day thank you for your call I know that being a mother I'm sure sometimes you feel so unappreciated appreciated by your family and maybe even your husband and your kids every load of laundry you've ever done every egg you've ever burnt every piece of toast that you've burnt while learning how to cook and all the beds that you've made and all the things that you've done thank your sisters thank you so much we was very poor when we were raised and I can remember more than once my mama trying to stretch our food and make it go far enough I'm the oldest of seven as you know um I can remember her cooking and fixing and preparing the meals and then whenever it come time to eat it she said she wasn't hungry well now I'll look back and I realize she probably was but her love for us kids was greater than our hunger I thank God for a Godly mother thank God from others amen aren't you glad you have a mother aren't you glad she didn't want to terminate your life amen let me now get started on that today God bless you we love you so much let us read a few places you're in the scripture this morning will begin in Matthew chapter 18. we've read this last Sunday if you don't mind we'll read it again today I believe we're living in a great time to be a Christian to be Sons and Daughters of God and the Very onslaught of hell against us as the people of God and our nation and the world as far as that goes lets us know where we are in time and we can certainly see that we're in a great A great battle not only for our lives and for our health but for our nation and we know that she's across the line between mercy and judgment and we're so thankful though that God is still dealing with individuals one here and there and there and them wanting to give their heart to him let's read together Matthew 18 18. now remember these are not the words of a mere man these are not the words of the Theologian the doctor a teacher but the words of God himself incarnate barely I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven James chapter 5 verse 16. confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man Avail us much First John 3 21. beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence toward God which is so important when we're praying and asking God about things that we don't feel condemned in our heart and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight you see friends that's not complex it's not deep it's not real hard to understand it's very very simple if we just believe it notice the way John says this in the latter part of verse 22 because we keep his Commandments and we do those things that are pleasing in his sight how many wants that today with all your heart before the Lord let's pray together if you would heavenly father as we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth from once we were taken and know one day unless we're caught up in the Rapture our bodies will go back the same way what we're grateful in this short journey in this span of time that we've been given called life we also have the opportunity to be able to live for you and do things for you and your people in your kingdom which will allow us to enter into life eternal and father I pray if there's one here today who doesn't know you in that way that you would help them that they might be able to embrace the person of eternal life dear God we're asking for every need those that are sick and Afflicted and weary we're praying that should help them fathers would stop by to pick up Erica's girls to come to church today and Heritage is so weak father we're asking you in the name of Jesus that you touch our Lord Lance had to carry her from the bathroom Lord and lay her in the bed but we rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus Christ may you touch her body now father not only her but everyone that has needs today father we commit it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said God bless you you may be seated I've been speaking to you for a few services on the bride's Bill of Rights taking it from the founding of our nation I don't know how familiar you are with a lot of the governments of the world but our nation is very unique in that it's established for the people and by the people I've been in lots of different countries of the world in which they claim to be Democratic and they claim to have a democracy but yet what's amazing is the same man runs for president for about 40 years and gets puts in every time so that don't sound like too much democracy to me and yet of all the nations that are on the earth those that actually have a declared Bill of Rights it's very few and the law to be able to stand on their side of course the Bill of Rights not only declares the rights of the individuals that make up that Nation but it also sets limitations and statutes by which the presiding body of government can be able to prosecute or press against the citizens of that Nation so rights are for the individuals that the rights have been given to but it also limits the prosecution and the persecution of the government of the nation that they are living in we can see little by little that our nation slowly is losing those rights I figure before we get ready to leave this place we'll lose even more but the bride's rights are just as equally important and it's if we do have rights that that are declared to us then it's to help us to see what's ours and it means that there's going to be an opposing Force that's going to try to press against the boundary of what those rights are going to say so in other words if you have a right to Healing you have a right to peace you have a right to eternal life a right to Salvation a right to this a right to that then there's going to be a force that is going to press against you to keep you from getting that you understand that now I realize that myself and probably most of you understand very little about the Unseen World that we confront every day it's hard for us to imagine that in the beginning there would have been myriads as the word of angels that were created and put on a stage of may I say probation so they were placed on a a position and they were given what the Bible calls an estate so they were given an estate now we think of an estate natural property we think of whatever your idea of an estate is whenever I think of an estate there's a particular a place that I think about it's in it's in Lexington Kentucky on the east side on a place called Versailles Road so it's the road that comes out of Lexington and goes toward Versailles Kentucky very beautiful place lots of horse farms on that place there and there was a young or an elder man rather that married this young woman and her desire was she wanted to be a modern day princess and she wanted to marry a man that would be able to give her a castle well this rich man was pretty much unlimited and his money so he buys this beautiful farm right outside of Lexington here on the Versailles Road I've been by there many times used to preach out in that direction and he fills her a modern day Castle now it's made out of stone similar to the one that Mr grindstaff built down here on the lake except it's much bigger much larger she wanted to moat around this property she wanted a gate there she wanted all different types of things so whatever her desire was was what this man wanted to do so he goes in there and he purchased this and he don't put it down in a valley doesn't put it in an obscure place but he purchases hundreds and hundreds of acres and he picks this ideal spot so everybody coming to word Versailles or from Versailles whichever direction you're going everybody coming through there including those flying over going into the airport or going to see this place because he wants them to know how much he loved this woman so he builds this absolutely breathtaking beautiful place but you know what he didn't want everybody and their brother coming in there taking pictures Trace been around all over the Landscaping barking marching all the way up and down the driveway so he put it a gated thing on the outside and actually got guards the last time I was there a couple years ago and actually had guards on the outside so if you come up with your camera and your video and you want to pay put a picture of you there in front of that place on Facebook them old boys is going to kindly or maybe not so kindly ask you to leave because this man designated this to be built for this woman that he loved so with that is the right of ownership is that is the right of possession is that is the right soul when I think of an estate I'm from Kentucky of course you know I love the road also going to Richmond and the road going to some of the different places out there and those of you that have been State 75 north where it breaks away from 275 and you go around the Kentucky Horse Park and you see all those beautiful fences there one of my brother-in-laws used to work there at the Red Mile trap and used to work at some of the horse barns and he's told me and caroly's sister that some of those horses live in nicer houses and a lot of people do so I think of the mistake of the Rolling fields in the blue grass and but demons did not have such a place but demons had a domain by which they were in a probation of partaking if you understand me in a realm of deity they had given to them an allocated allotment by which God would trust them with certain things now I'll be the first to admit I don't know what they did I don't know what they've done it seems as if though by reading in the scriptures that the Earth has had several different stages by which God has used her and we know according to the Book of Genesis that the Bible says these are the generations of the heavens and the Earth so it would lead us to believe that the heavens has had Generations not just one and that the Earth has been in many forms of genos or Generations so it's hard for us to imagine how many times that the Earth has been used by God and we can see reading from Genesis of course in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void in darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the waters and God said let there be light and there was light but yet we contrast that with the book of Isaiah and we see that the way Isaiah declared the creation of the earth he does not mention the void or the darkness so it's as if though that Moses actually picks up the stage of the earth after a cataclysmic change has happened on the earth so Moses of course in Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and then he ends that sentence and then he picks up again but it doesn't necessarily mean that they are held in chronological order even though you'll go from verse 1 to verse 2 it might have been thousands of years or Millennia by which that verse 2 and verse 2 was apart but it sounds as if so from Jeremiah and from Isaiah that Satan was allowed to walk upon this place which was created and the prophet tells us and that day on Calvary 1960 that whenever Satan walked upon the Earth and she was belching out volcanic ash and the all that was coming out of the bowels of the earth that Satan walked up and down on the earth and he began to claim it as his own and he said this is mine this is what I want now this would of course been before Adam was ever here and what the scholars call a preadamite world so it was an existence of the stage of the earth and it was before man before animals but it was allotted to created beings that were Angels now remember all angels are not created in the element of time but there are some angels that are created and they are put on this probationary period they are given an estate that God would allow them a certain partaking of his own divine nature but it was not something that was inherent to them that they had it because God had trusted them with said by virtue of its nature but it was like the word power and we have two words in the New Testament that is used for the word power one of them is exclusia and the other is dunamis and excusia is a right or a jurisdiction that is given to someone by someone greater so it doesn't mean that they actually have it by their own authority but dunamis is the power of the word that we get the word Dynamite from but it is something a power that comes within you and gives you that power by an inherent nature now a policeman can have all types of authority he can turn on that blue light he can write you a ticket if he's in a bad mood well he can make your day miserable if he has power apart from character but what does he have now if he's a State Trooper then he has to go through the state of Tennessee and they give him authority to do this and that and the other what does he have excuse him he has an authority given to him by the state of Tennessee that don't mean he has one ounce of character but dunamis is something altogether different it is a power that's given to you and it works with your adoption or your placing in Christ Jesus so it's something that comes in you by the new birth and inherit nature and then as you learn to submit to God and the more God can trust you the more God will allow this power to be able to pour out of you to others when God knows that he can trust you as long as you stay humble and small in your own eyes then God will just keep leading you leading you leading you until you reach the crescendo of your life and then God will Crown you with glory and take you off the Earth but many people will have excuses but will never have dunamis so God knew that there would be an element of these angels you said why would God ever do that well remember God had created this other being and God called him Daystar or he called him Lucifer he has many names as we know him of and God said thou was perfect from the day that I created thee until iniquity was found indeed he said did not I place thee ogarding cherub was it not I that gave you your position you was in the garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis the topaz which is many of the jewels that the city of God will be built out of yet he said iniquity was found in thee because from thine heart you said I will be like the most high that's When sin actually began now God knew that Satan would actually become he would come from the stage of being Lucifer to becoming Satan he also knew that Satan could not create Angels so God placed a number of these angels Mary edge of them on this probationary period and God would share with them this element of his power this element of adaptable deity by which they would be able to enter into but also leave from I don't want that myself people say well I want what Adam what had I don't I want something greater than what Adam had because whatever Adam had Adam walked away from it what I want I don't know about you but what I want in my soul is something that I'll never leave and something that I'll never get away from you follow me now so these angels then whenever they begin to hear Satan's message now remember the first preacher that we have record of in the scripture was the devil all right yeah he began to preach to these angels so he pulled these angels over onto the north side now remember the north side is the most spiritual aspect of Heaven it is the word that is used for flank it is the word that when they built the Tabernacle of testimony of witness and in the wilderness and they had the wrapping that would go around the outside and they they built it on purpose whether it would be bigger and they would have it where it would wrap around on that word there was the flank so it was the wrapping of the glory of God that would come around the north side of the Tabernacle Satan set his heart on the North you ever notice how a lot of major cities of the Earth the north side will be the one that will have the most Finance the most economical it's it's phenomenal when you go to looking at it so Satan said that it was the Norse he wanted the north but God told him what he was going to give he wants the North and he's going to get the sides of the pit so I don't guess it makes no difference of the sides is north south east to west yeah it's going to get burned up anyway so God knew that all this would happen now for us it's hard to imagine how that angels that never curse they never lied they never done anything wrong but they began to hear this master preacher and this master preacher began to set forth you know his message of rebellion against the headship of God and these angels which have not born in sin and they begin to amen as we would say and then they begin to vote with their feet you realize that's what people do many times they vote with their feet when people leave the word they don't necessarily say all right we're having a vote this morning who wants to leave the word everybody raise your hand no a lot of times they don't raise their hand but they vote with her feet they leave the word so they voted with her feet so the Angels actually voted with their feet to rebel against God now once they did that God did not strip them of their position and even the order of the Divine protocol we can see this of course in the Book of Daniel when Daniel begins to pray and you know the story that the angel come and he comes and tells him your prayer was heard from the first day and you imagine Daniel saying well why in the world will take you so long to get here then but we realize and get a view into what was going on that the demon over that City where Daniel lived God had sent an angel from the presence of God but but it just so happened the angel that he sent ranked less an authority than the demon who is in charge of that City so he wrestled and wrestled until of course the Great Mighty Archangel was sent to be able to rescue him and want him and the Archangel begin to wrestle then this angel came on down and brought the message to Daniel now whenever he tells Daniel the message and he delivers it and he says lo I must go and I must fight with the Prince of Persia so a demon had already been chosen because now this Kingdom and this Empire is fixing to be destroyed remember the four Great Gentile kingdoms of the world and a demon had already been chosen to be the anointed hierarchy of the kingdom of Persia and he's going back to fight with that so we get an insight into how that it was now that window of the supernatural it would open a little a little bit at a time and Prophets of course which represent the eyes of God see him they would look in there and get a little bit of Glimpse and then to sight God would shut the door back and then another one would open up oh this is one reason why I love the message of the hour so much because For the First time we're allowed to peer in to the sixth Dimension Into The Fifth Dimension into the seventh Dimension into the fourth dimension were diseases and all these things are we're able to hear communication we're able to see lights Shadows darkness and so on that we never had a view of before so God had allowed his Prophet to be able to break into that realm and I I love studying not only of course the Theology and the doctrinal side of the message but I love studying prayers of the prophet and hearing how that he would challenge those demons and the things that he would actually say to them and what he would call them and what he would tell them that their Destiny was now I can tell you already here this morning there's some nervous Devils sitting here right now Hallelujah now you know because of that why would we need why would the need the bride need rights well because the powers of hell is going to be released it's like there will be a gradual releasing remember this day brought to us the opening of The Seven Seals but it was not just the Seven Seals that was going to come open but the lid is going to be torn off of Hell and Hell is going to vomit out things that has never existed on the face of the Earth before there will be disease there will be oppression there will be possession there will be such things that people never thought imaginable on the earth now I'm not just talking about the tribulation period but I'm talking about pre-tribulation anointing which is already on the earth how many knows in the last few years you'll fight more than you've ever fought in your life all hell is against it and it's not just people that are Christians but the whole world is going insane that's why they have to have a pill to get up wanting to make it to lunch time one to make it to three o'clock break time have to have another to go to sleep by they're insane they're having to have all types of things to be able to make it what is it the powers of darkness is pressing against the people so there is then a great Warfare that is going on these beings which fell from their estate they have now been allocated to come against the people of God for those that have received the Seal of the Holy Ghost the devil can never get your soul again but he can oppress you he can afflict your body he can afflict your mind he can make you feel weary sad a failure anybody know what I'm talking about does that affect us as human beings of course it does but yet God wanted us more than any other age now I've read of course the writings of Paul looked at the writings of Luther where some of the writings of Wesley some of the writings of Whitfield some of the writings of these men I have found none of them that actually sold God using such a pronounced way to help the bride to recognize her position as she did this humble little simple man from Kentucky now it wasn't because he was an educated man no it was not it was because God chose him for such a purpose and for such a time as this in order to declare to us our rights and what they are so if we have this much of a declaration of our rights I don't think God repeats himself for no valuable reason Jesus would say it over and over again verily verily verily verily now according to the Aramaic which Jesus would have spoke Aramaic and part Greek you would not have to have that verily verily because one verily in the rendering from the Aramaic language would been enough to let this know this is an important statement that I'm going to say to you but Jesus would double it and say verily verily listen listen take heed take heed so if he says verily verily we better listen better listen and if he says verily verily verily we better better listen better listen better listen because it is for our good and everybody said so let us if you don't mind this morning let us look at a few things now that we can become a little bit more aware now watch let's allow the prophet to tell us some of our rights now here he is sitting here to make session intercessions on my confession talking about the Lord Jesus and I have a right to confess that he's done anything for me that's in the Redemptive blessings there you are what was the Redemptive blessing he was wounded for our transgressions Bruce for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and where the stripes were healed is that right that's every believer's possession that's mine so everything Jesus died for is yours so will the devil just go back and sit in a corner and say well go ahead and take it then I guess I might as well just let you have it oh no he will try his best to Bluff you he will try his best and I remember those only one legal right that Satan ever has against a Believer only one but he will try to convince you that he has many many rights but Satan is a professional poker player okay now just take my word for it I've never played cards in my life so I don't know anything about poker anything about that sort of thing but I did want to look up the word because I found that the prophet uses so many times and it was a word that Satan was a bluff well I wanted to look that up and I thought I knew pretty well what it meant but I wanted to be sure and I found that they tied this to playing poker and I read a little bit about it to be able to understand so it would be like that there are several people sitting around and the stakes are high and there you know the this guy wants to win and that guy of course hopefully none of these brothers I'm poking point now play poker but they're all sitting at the table and nobody knows what anybody else has nobody knows what your cards are so it's the man who can have what they call the poker face or the bluff and he will sit there and bless you now you may have a better hand than he does you may actually have the winning hand but his face is not giving away that he's sitting there with Monopoly cards he's sitting right there and all he's got in his pocket is Monopoly money now he's hoping that you are not going to pull and really make him show that but if he can sit there and never twitch now remember I had a friend years and years ago in West Virginia they were on the board of Kentucky there in West Virginia he was a professional Gambler a man that had a heart toward the lord I prayed for him many many times he would go out west he would do it one time a year he would die he would die his hair he would change his looks totally because he was a professional card shark people was looking for him all over the world because he was so good and they were never able to catch him he would go one time a year spend a couple of weeks and live like a millionaire the rest of the year but yeah he was all the way that he did it so he learned how to hide his cards and he learned how to have that face and that's the way the devil does US many times he's sat now with Monopoly money and he's sitting there with cards and ain't a bit more valuable than nothing and you're setting up with all these rights in your head and he looks at you and he don't crack a smile but he watches your demeanor and he watches you when you live goes to quivering a little bit and your eye will go to jerkin and he knows he's got you because it's a sign of weakness and he keeps telling you it won't happen to you God won't do it oh yeah he's a Healer but he ain't going to heal you and you'll sit there and he'll tell you over and over again and he'll project that devil poke her face oh I feel like smacking that face don't you he'll project that look oh my and you will sit there and sit there and the longer he sets the more you're jerking and the more you're equivalent he's done got you whipped and yet you are sitting there with the winning hand oh my that it's already yours it's already mine if we will stand there on the promise of God notice he goes on to say you have a right tonight to enjoy the full blessing of all the apostles had this Word of Life Church believe that you have a right this is your Bill of Rights to enjoy the full blessing of all that the apostles have I don't want just the name that we're an Apostolic church I've got the right as the Son of God if I am a true Minister called of God I've got the same right to the Full Gospel that Peter had Peter ain't got no more right to the gospel that every God called man sitting in this building right here today and the church said oh some of y'all's eyes twitching notice again every born-again man is circumcised by the Holy Ghost you have a right for every Redemptive blessing let the devil rob you out of none of it and the church said notice again claim your legal rights don't let Satan press you on anything you're of God you're of God and he's got no rights to hold it now you see these demons they know how to Bluff because they work for the king of bluffers so he bluffed Adam he bluffed Eve he's bluffed right on down through time and he's bluffed me and he's bluffed you I'm going to go ahead and say it for you he's bluffed us many a time and robbed us out of the blessing of God and he was sat now with his Monopoly money among the actually God was telling him get back down to Hades you devil you know when that little thing on the Monopoly things and says go back home well that's why we're telling the devil get on back down to Hell devil you don't belong in my body you don't belong in my home you don't belong in our church you don't belong in my daughter you don't belong in my husband you don't belong in my wife get back down to Hell I am a daughter of God I am the Son of God it is my rights notice again he said if you're Christians and you have a right a legal right for everything Christ died for it's your possession you own it it's yours now the only thing you have to do is like Abraham after he endured a fight he obtained the promise Satan don't just let you take it easy you've got to have faith you've got to believe it and you've got to endure how many knows that's the hardest part all we can believe in this is yes sir with all my heart I believe it praise the Lord for coming by noon is it becoming oh my goodness it's already 12 months afternoon already and we're already like well if it don't come by three o'clock I guess it ain't going to happen yes a real believer says well if it don't happen today it'll be a bigger Miracle tomorrow and if it don't happen tomorrow be a better remember America on Tuesday or Wednesday but I know one thing I am a believer and I'm expecting my God to move that's right now let me bring this to you also on the restoration of the broad tree that the prophet who went to the Sunday morning service there's an Easter Service in 1962 and brother Neville had preached and unlike a lot of the message people that don't think they need to set under preachers brother Brandon had went through that morning and hurt by the Neville preach and by the Neville had preached an outstanding sermon but brother Neville closed out his thoughts with these words something about restore well brother random one home that was a daylight service or a sunrise service and then they come back in a couple of hours and brother Brown preaches this message a restoration of the broad tree I love it because he was not ashamed to say that he got the inspiration here and by the Neville preached well come on now that's a real man right there now once he said Webster says the word restore means to bring it back to the original to the former owner and to bring it back to a former state of condition and if a claim is made on something to make the restoration you can enforce it you can enforce it to make it come back to its right place and may God bless the feeble worse now he announces his text and what he's going to preach and he starts it out this way with this twofold aspect of it restoration and enforcing I don't mind telling you there's times that I need the enforcer to help enforce my claim now what's your restore is to bring back to who really owns it to restore us to bring them back to who really owns it or to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time to bring it back to its natural condition in order to do this we have to have a right to enforce here's another one of your rights so you ain't just got a right to claim it but you've got to write as a child of God to call on the presence of the Holy Ghost to enforce that claim don't ask the devil to leave but make him leave well praise the Lord my mouth notice this he says then when we are we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God give us for God has a law and his word is that law and God in this word will make certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan I wonder how many of us here this morning beginning with me really sees this or do we not take the back seat to the devil he pushes us around he tells us what we can and cannot do he tells us how we're going to do in church he tells you now you ain't going to get in because I ain't going to let you I'm going to make you sad in church I'm going to make your mind go here and there and there you're going to be thinking about them sweet rolls over at the steakhouse and you're going to be sitting right there with that sweet potato of yours and oh my that cinnamon butter and it says oh somebody's fixing to leave right now you're going to order that Top Cut Sarah on and you're going to order it this way you ain't going to get nothing from church you need to smack that devil in the mouth and say get out of here you ain't the enforcer I am you ain't telling me what I'm going to get from church I'm going to tell you I'm getting a blessing I'm getting healing I'm getting what I need from God I need a touch today and I'm gonna get it today therefore we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and give it back listen to these words and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down on our knees and say it's thus saith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit's there to make him do it now don't get in your mind that you can and I can't there's no way that we can do this on our own but the Holy Ghost has partnership himself with us and the Holy Ghost is wanting us to make the claim and then claim it in the name of Jesus and stand upon that claim and then the Holy Ghost will kick the devil out of your property praise be to God notice this the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he is unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church is given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and enforce this upon them if Satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of God we have a right this morning by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God bring them back if the devil is trying to assert Authority in your home pull your husband your wife your children away from serving God you need to stay in your ground and make her claim Satan in the name of Jesus you have no right to claim my husband you have no right to claim my daughter you're claiming them but I'm claiming them in the name of Jesus and the Holy Ghost is going to enforce my claim Oh Glory to God notice jump down in that quote a little bit now that this that's the enforcement restore it bring it back to its original condition a man sick a baby is sick a woman sick they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because God give it to us by stripes for heal he was wounded for our transgressions the way the stripes were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the law Giver the Holy Spirit himself is here the ancient of God to see it's done that way amen now the only way he can work is when you let him work and you've got to believe it but are we afraid are we afraid it won't happen we're afraid well I've seen so many people mess up I have to that ain't going to stop me I ain't got nothing to do with me well brother Donnie I've seen all kinds of people make claims I have too but if they're between me and God that means they're closer to God than I am they're standing in my way let me move around the Scarecrow and keep eating butter beans now what rights do we have then watch the prophet again the devil's nothing but a scarecrow now I'm ugly enough to pass for one so I'll put my arms out now watch the Scarecrow four to keep crows away from something they want to eat now in this case I could understand how a scarecrow would scarecrows I don't understand how scarecrows scare Eagles since Eagles should have their eyesight not upon the crow but upon the cross I'm not looking at the crow today I'm not looking at a doctor's report today I'm not looking at how you feel how I feel I'm not just looking at the condition of the earth I'm looking at the promise of my God let that scarecrow shine out there and say oh you're not going to get it I'm going to knock him down when I get under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and say out of my way big boy I don't cash Monopoly money in my store I'm not taking your Monopoly promises I'm not taking your Monopoly money I have got real silver of redemption by the blood of the Lamb now watch the devil's nothing but a scarecrow he just scares you into something he has no legal rights at all so we have all the rights and he has none but I don't understand why does this seem like he's the Victorious one over so much of the time but he has no legal rights at all he has no legal rights at all he was stripped of every right of principalities he spoiled everything when he died at Calvary here he is coming down now Satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a Christian do we believe this some of you the rest of you is thinking about it here Satan has got any legal rights at all over a Christian every time a man gets saved God just writes out a whole big bunch of checks like that and puts his name at the bottom said here you are fill them out are you scared of it fill it out whatever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it it'll be given to you is that right notice again he said he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere but you know what I said you this I realize he don't have to have a legal right all he's got to do is hold his cards out in front of you and sit there and look at you with that poker face you're afraid aren't you you're scared you've never been this way before have you I can see it in your face I can see it in your eyes you say you're scared you didn't realize this would ever happen to you you saw you were above such things you are feeling shaken you are feeling torn up you and he's sitting there watching you to see if you're left out or you know some people just got that twitch about them when they get nervous and you don't tell them they're getting more nervous the more they're twitching and now he's sitting with his Monopoly card go to jail which is his card but he says going to hell that's on every one of his cards I'm going to hell I am lost I'm going to be separated I'll never have eternal life I'm going to perish I'm going to burn up that's what all his cards say can you imagine he said in there because the Lord Jesus is the one to hand them to thy say all of his cards I'm lost there's no hope for me there's no peace at all I'll have been Eternal separation I'm lost I'm totally out of reconciliation from God he's such an holds that hand and said and smiles at you like you wake God nothing looking right there when he sees it and he sees my destiny is eternal separation from God playing with a loser's hand looking at you one of the greatest winners that's ever been on the face of the Earth and you're sitting there shaking and quitting hope I can make it to the end of the service I'm hoping I'll make it to the end of the service without dancing everywhere so I'm hoping I can't but the only do you feel it no but every now and that I just ought to dance to let the devil know whose side I'm on I like to praise the Lord I like to get a little bit of motion just let the Lord I let the Lord know I love him let the Lord know that I appreciate him I like to shine with the voice of Triumph I like to clap my hands David danced before the Lord with all of his might sometimes Donnie lost the deaths before the Lord with all of his might because I want the devil to know I am a winner I am victorious in Christ Jesus ah a he's absolutely legally defeated in every place the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere I want you to listen I says this he's just a devil now that's the way you all say it right it's just the devil we're saying upside down you're not saying what he said let me tell you what the devil is a password the devil hasn't got one legal right at all nowhere he's just the devil and a password and passwords get hacked all the time so I think it's time we go to hacking I think it's time to go to hacking on this password and say we've got your number devil we've got a word for you we've got a word for you devil we are more than conquerors thank you he hasn't got no legal right to any man that will accept the promise of Jesus Christ he's whipped he's whipped in sickness he's whipped in disappointments he's whipped and everything he swept in deaths he can't scare me he can't scare you he's a big old shadow now let's watch a little one-on-one confrontation I lay my hands upon her I condemn this enemy made it go out of her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come out of her Satan for God's glory for the fulfilling of the word of the Lord Jesus which cannot fail you are defeated you have no legal right Jesus Christ robbed you I just think that is so great the biggest robber that's ever been got robbed [Applause] well you know the Lord Jesus ain't gonna take nothing nothing from the devil that belongs to the devil so where did God what's he robbing the devil of what belonged to Jesus Christ you see the devil took you but you don't belong to him so what'd he do he took you away from the Devil the Earth don't belong to him Jesus Christ is going to take the hours away from the devil like he took the woman at the well away from the devil he robbed Satan for Glory you have no legal right to hold her anymore so leave her in the name of the one who died for her even our lord Jesus listen this no matter how much you scream how loud you scream how about you pray that Devil's got a legal right to stay there he will stay now listen here's the only right Satan can have as a believer that a Christian has unconfessed sin or something they should have done that they didn't do or they haven't made something right that's the only claim that he has got a right to stay there not only that but if you supposed to dumb something and didn't do it he has a legal right of disobedience so there's what it is so you calming that person and you find out just where the cause is me and Erica said the other day on reports and she said Daddy I'm just wondering have I done something wrong have I done something wrong why this has come on me I said honey as your daddy you know I love you don't you she said yes I said if you come to me and said Daddy if I hurt you somewhat of offended you you think I'd be honest with you she said I know you would and I said you've went to father and ask him yes and I said what'd he say she said he didn't show me nothing I said then you need to take that as a voice of Innocence a voice of no condemnation a voice of no give oh you say but he didn't say anything I take his silence as knows because if he loves me and I believe he does and I believe he loves you then if I'm sincere and I'm asking him father have I done something show me don't make it right if he don't tell you nothing then you take that reply as a command and you go right back to the table and look across at that liar and say to hell you go to house I go to hell you go to Deliverance I go you are a liar my heart does not condemn me therefore he hears me when I pray Oh Glory to God notice when he said thanks well move but not when he's got a legal right now listen to Satan knows what his righteous and what he hasn't got a right to do now all these quotes are some of y'all are hearing for your first time he heard him back in 54 53 52 50 51. he's been aware of this for all these years we're just now catching up to what he knows the whole time he was hoping and praying y'all wouldn't find it out today is your day to be exposed I am here to expose your high I am here to let them know you are a liar you are a bluff you ain't got no right on us you ain't got no claim on us we are God's children once again a personal conflict you have no rights to say anymore wow you have no rights to say anymore you are exposed right here from this platform your legal rights are gone your day is finished and the Church of the Living God is moving up into Realms of faith and you know that you are defeated and have been you're only a bluff you Bluff the people long enough as the Church of the Living God we take charge over thee by the Commandment of our Lord Jesus Christ and as his servant along with the church a Jersey by the Living God and his son Jesus that you come out of every person here now go out with them you are defeated and lost the battle in Jesus Christ's name Hallelujah Hallelujah Satan don't have one right of nothing he's only a bluff he was stripped of everything he had it calvary when Jesus Christ taken the sinner's place and died in Calvary Satan has no more legal rights over nothing no more Hallelujah but everything lays in the hands of the church and the believer that's it Satan's lost he's nothing but a bluff now listen what the meaning of calling someone's Bluff is to uncover a deception or challenge someone to carry out a threat or prove a dubious point now this is what it is to call someone's Bluff to uncover a deception which is what I've been doing now for the last however long it's been or challenge someone to carry out a threat or prove a dubious point also it means to challenge someone's statement or threat because it is not believed anybody with me now so you know this morning I am calling the devil's Bluff why because I don't believe his statement I'm calling his bluff that there won't be a bride I say the will I'm calling his blood that he's going to defeat us I say he won't well I don't doubt I don't believe his claim and I know he's got Monopoly money and I know his cards is holding in his hand it's telling him he's going to be lost he's going to be destroyed and I know what I'm holding my hand is by Grace I'm safe forevermore and when there is no more devil he will forever be when there is no more cancer when there is no more sickness when there is no more trouble you will be in Eternal as God is eternal oh man how many locks are good Duo anybody you may like a good duel now Satan this Duel of faith you claim her and I claim her for Jesus so here's a duel the devil is claiming this sick Afflicted woman the prophet of God has sent her said now you climber and I'm climate I claim you have no power over her I claim you have no power over nothing Jesus Christ my Lord stripped and robbed you of everything you had Hallelujah and every legal rights at Calvary well I say amen I claim the same thing I stand here as his representative and you know all about this gift oh you know about where he ministered and how he did it uh charged thee by the Living God you come out of the woman lever in Jesus Christ's name this woman is blind ever had bowed let me see your eyes and how he's speaking to the woman that he's made the duel to the devil so the devil is claimed her she's blind she can't see I said let me see your eyes I will call you if something happens now just raise your head can you see me put your hands on my nose then the prophet tells the congregation open your eyes the woman can see Hallelujah Hallelujah they're not that same Lord Jesus go to my little girl today cannot that same Lord Jesus by the mark sister Teresa go to your little boy today can not that same Lord Jesus go to your home can he go to your son your daughter your husband your wife we have rights as the people of God ah the woman can see now as I've said for those who want to challenge this message and this messenger you do what he does then come talk to me we'll sit down and listen to you but until you do we will continue with what we believe to be the truth Jesus Christ stripped him of the authority that he had he hasn't got what legal right he hasn't got one legal thing or the full penalty of sin and sickness to pay for a Calvary and will the attributes of Everything Jesus died for and he knows this is what's so sad brother friend he knows he's defeated but he knows you don't know it he's holding the losing hand and he knows he has not one right not one legal right over you if everything is right between you and God he knows all the promises are yours he knows there's nothing that can hinder your prayers When you pray if you believe but he also knows if you don't know all of the above he can treat you like a stepchild he can treat you like your second Christ citizen of Heaven when he has nothing in his hand but empty I don't mind telling you that makes me mad at you all but I am mad at the Devil and I have to say I do get mad at me sometimes well y'all to get just go ahead and say she'll get mad at yourself or you need to notice this hear you him we'll close your momentary oh God what an evil thing Satan yes he binds the helpless he comes in by force puts the children of God into corners but tonight he's exposed we realize he's just a bluff he has no legal rights Christ tripped him of everything it had at Calvary everything even fear everything was paid for it calvary and Satan you don't have any legal right over God's children they're God's heritage you can't hold them any longer come out of here I am a jewelry by Jesus Christ what's this Oneness of unity I now challenge the devil to a debate whoa now you're either nuts or you know who you're standing how about all these people the father believe the sign and they wanted to challenge me to Abate debate argue about this and they'll fly me here and they'll come down here and fly that I'll say why in the world should I take time to deal with some debate with some knucklehead like that one I've got more important people to debate with I mean I'm debating with the devil every day my goodness why in the world would I want to take time to deal with some little insignificant nothing can you imagine a prophet of God sending a man saying not I'm answering the devil's challenge but I want you to know devil I'm challenging you oh my god brother Donnie you're scaring me you're scaring me where are you going with this I'll tell you where I'm going with this out of this world out of this world I challenge the devil to a debate baked Satan you're aware you are whipped you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my Lord scripture of every Authority you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness and you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff you know that when our Lord came to the tree he cursed the tree now listen how he's talking to the devil he cursed the tree the next day it was with her and our lord said to his disciples have faith in God for your fuel say to this mountain be not moved to doubt in your heart you can believe what you had is coming to pass coming to pass coming to pass don't you understand that's why we miss it when the promise is coming to pass we're doubting it because it hasn't come to pass sometimes God's promises come to pass immediately sometimes they're coming to pass day by day hour by hour and we lose the victory because it didn't happen just like that I just taught this people that God is in them and if God is in them they can speak to that disease and say be away oh God be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease has to move for Christ said so for it's not them that speaks it's the father that dwells in them it's the father but speaking they're in need so come the name of Jesus Christ and no friends I'm not just reading quotes I'm speaking to Demons this morning I'm not just reading something that I think sounds nice I'm repeating the words of a Vindicated prophet and as I'm reading them I'm speaking to them spirits as I'm speaking to you to tell you show your hand and let him know you know he has no oh a challenge the devil in Jesus name he cannot defy the word of God for the word of God is deceived you Satan ain't that rich and you are strict of all the rights you ever had when Jesus died at Calvary he gave us the keys to the kingdom and you have no legal right in our bodies any longer we are Jews in the name of Jesus Christ leave every sick person here every crippled person every blind person every deaf person oh and you imagine when the prophet set up by this quote and wonders of unity and he says I challenge the devil to a debate this meeting had been one of the hardest meetings it ever had Waterloo Iowa 1958 the people sat on him they doubted they questioned they had all kinds of things actually makes this Challenge and he prays for the people the lion go to getting up the blind start seeing and all of a sudden you can hear it on the tape and here comes a mighty Roar and it goes like a mighty rushing wind and he said did you hear that did you hear that and you can hear the people as they are reacting he said that was the voice of God reacting back in the middle he turns around he asked the minister did you all hear that and you can hear them responding yes oh glory to God the man of God challenged the devil and the Holy Ghost showed up to accept the challenge oh roll it roller roll it remember when the demon act man the man that was possessed of the Demons the prophet tells us in 1956 the head the chief of that tribe of demons you see demons still have their hierarchy and apparently the chief and this man was in pretty good communication what a terrible identification to be the chief of that tribe of demons made a challenge and the prophet said the Holy Ghost accepted his challenge the man come up across the platform you remember the story and he said I'll break every bone of your body and he said the love of God just come around him he said Satan in the name of Jesus come out of him and the man starts spinning around and around and Falls across brother brand of his feet policeman come to get him take him off and he said is the man delivered he said the man worships that spirit and about that time someone in the back blind stood up with her eyesight crippled Lane halt why the Holy Ghost accepted the challenge but they tell you something there's got to be a challenge first for the Holy Ghost to accept it it depends on how you look at your battles oh my depends on how you look at what you're going through it could be the Lord setting you up for the seventh day it could be the Lord setting you up so the final March around the walls of Jericho that the Holy Ghost is going to accept the challenge of a cancer devil that says I'll kill you I'll take your life a blood pressure devil I'll do this and that and the other and the Holy Ghost says come on Child come on call me on the scene let me accept your challenge for you let's stand up let me read you this one Grand Prairie Alberta it is I Satan we have a word for you and we want to tell you that you've deceived the people as long as you're going to you have no legal right to hold them Jesus Christ took every right you had when he rose from the dead Triant over you and you're nothing but a bluff and he sure tonight to call your bluff and expose you and tell you who you are Dawson Creek therefore Satan you are a defeated being you have no legal right to begin with to torment these people you're a bluff and we're calling that bluff so look him in the eye without your eye twitching without your other lip upper lip going into that little convulsion that it gets into sometimes and you get all scared and tore up and tell him I don't know the hand you're holding old boy you're lost there's no hope for you you can't be saved you can't be filled with the Holy Ghost I've got something you'll never have the devil can out preach me he can out sing me he can now shout me he can now quote the word to me but there's a lot of things I can do that he can't do and one of the main things is I can live right I'm a Son of God I have the Holy Ghost and he'll never get it oh glory to God yeah he repented in Judas he repented in Alphas he received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what the prophet tells us but Elvis Presley got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the devil got it oh you're not familiar with that huh yeah when Elvis got the Holy Ghost the devil got it you say brother Donnie that confuses me it shouldn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're saved that's your spirit you see me just baptized her sister up here in water the other day I put my hand over her mouth and over her nose why keep water from going in but it should get baptized people's Spirit can be baptized into the spirit and the soul is black

numb all over I'm not made to take that long Lord oh but Jesus I'm just so glad that you give it to us on the ability that we're called to handle it maybe some of these things they heard today they're pondering they're wandering but Lord may they break it down just in such Simplicity the bottom line is this they are more than conquerors and Satan is here to challenge them to make a coin Satan's claimed them for his kingdom but as a pastor I claim them for heaven Satan would like to claim our young men he'd like to get them caught up in pornography he'd like to get our young ladies caught up in this and that and the other he claims them but as a Shepherd a god-called man I claim them for the kingdom of God I believe one day when I walk before you Lord God some of these sheep is going to

over and looking at you and say you are a defeated being and greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world I've got two quotes laying right here before me this morning devil where God's Prophet said that a person could be so completely surrendered to God that the devil don't even know what to do with it he didn't say a preacher he didn't say a prophet he didn't say the five-fold ministry he said a person I believe that's a young man a young woman a mother a father a grandmother a grandfather and that's what you don't want us to know ain't it but we've exposed your hide this morning Satan you are powerless you are a bluff you are Defeated come out of this people in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God in the name of Jesus thank you Father We Worship You Lord you demons out of hell that have robbed some of these people have been sons of God try to satisfy them with church membership in the name of Jesus take your hands off of them find them with fear because of family strange tell them they'll never get delivered of this and that I adjure you in the name of the Living God take your hands off of them Hallelujah in the name of Jesus and the church said [Music] Carolyn I was talking yesterday she said Donnie didn't you say when you prayed for that man in Kentucky years ago she said you've remembered it's that tent meeting the cancer had eat through his skull and his head was like a mushmelon she said didn't you said that's what happened I said yes Carol wasn't there his sister come in the prayer line I was over in Wattsburg Kentucky he was in the hospital and they'd only give him just a few hours she left the hospital and come straight to the meeting I was a Pentecostal preacher if the anointing under Pentecost would do that although the bride anointing do she come up in the prayer line and asked for my handkerchief she said his skull was rotten and gone his head was soft like a mushmelon the cancer was in his brain into his skull all into there's no way for him to live you've heard me tell it before she took the handkerchief back to the hospital room the next morning the man walked out of the hospital and checked himself out with a new skull a new brain Hallelujah if God can create a new skull and a new brain what is three spots on the brain of my daughter what is the battle you're facing what's the thing that you're looking at today it ain't nothing as our brother Jeremy sang it a while ago that ain't nothing but a giant in front of you but brother sister it depends on how you look at them Giants the way I
