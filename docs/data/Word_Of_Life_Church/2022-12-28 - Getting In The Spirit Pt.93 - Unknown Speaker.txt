it's good to be together tonight how long has it been since we had Church a month now or has it been like it's been forever don't it I love going to church I love going to church some folks love going to a rodeo somebody going to a football game baseball game basketball game Dollywood wherever it is that you like to go but my favorite place is going to church I enjoyed getting together with family and friends and things like that but there's just something about being in God's presence it changes you every time you're there if you'll let it hey man it's so wonderful to be able to to gather you tonight let's turn to the Book of Revelation if you would Chapter 19 Verse verse 19. Revelation 19 19. what an astounding time is laying before this world for us as the people of God it's a tremendous time absolute tremendous time that lays before us what will happen after the departure of the Bride or not so much it's going to be a terrible terrible time I wish you could be able to let everybody know but if we would head out of here tonight scream it to the top of our lungs we probably wouldn't get to the traffic light down in order to where somebody had already called the cops on us and think we were crazy have us picked up if we try to witness to the Jailer to the people in jail they'd think Luke was crazy and it's like we have the truth to be able to tell people that people simply don't want it they want their way they want what they want and what they think is right we're so blessed to desire the truth listen carefully now I saw the beasts and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army you're talking about insanity people are going to be so insane they will attack the Lord Jesus and his army and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought Miracles before him with which he deceived then that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with a brimstone now remember these are the first beings that the scripture records being cast into this Lake of Fire the Old Testament people and the New Testament people that were lost have went into Hades or Shield of the Old Testament but these go directly into the Lake of Fire and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that set upon the horse which proceedeth out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh Lord Jesus let's pray together father thank you for your mercy to us tonight thank you Lord Jesus that you have made a way of Escape that we would not be partakers of these terrible things that are going to happen father God if there's one individual in this place tonight that is not ready to meet you that does not have the token applied to their life we pray for them now Lord if there's one that does not know you as Savior one who's maybe Justified and Sanctified but never received the seal may this be the night that you will make it real to them father may you pass by this way tonight heal the sick encourage those that are down and weary Lord be remember those that are traveling still on the holiday times we pray for your mercy to them flying driving whatever they're doing be merciful to Him Father we ask we commit the service and the word into your care help me to be able to get out of the way to speak the words of Life help the people to be able to receive it for it's in the name of the word we ask amen God bless you you may be seated I don't think that our minds as much as we have the ability to imagine can every ever be able to comprehend what a terrible time that lays before the people at the end not only during the tribulation but at the end of the tribulation which is where this setting is they will be so under the wrath of God they will be so under the domain of the Beast and of the false prophet they will so be under the plagues the prophets of Revelation 11 will be given Authority power to control the elements to be able to stop winds bring all kinds of things upon the human race and yet at the end of it instead of people being of a repentant heart and a repentant attitude and saying God we're so sorry what what have we done to you instead of them having that mindset they were going to be so angry and so upset at God they will see the Lord Jesus coming out of Heaven on a white horse and the armies of heaven with him and they will have such rage and such anger that they will go out to meet him the King of Kings you've got to be kidding these people are absolutely out of their minds they're going to attack the Lord Jesus they're going to attack the saints of God in glorified bodies what would make them do such a thing well the key is where they are and who they are you see the Bible tells us here that they have received the mark of the beast they've been deceived by miraculous power of the false prophet so they will have been so duped by this religious thing they would have received the mark of the beast and they will their soul will then be turned over to a reprobate state so you know they've got in their mind they know they know they'll be able to win they believe in their mind they'll be able to win a battle against the Lord Jesus now you know demons are so they're so deceptive they they themselves believe in one God they know their Destiny they don't even question God about words are going they don't even accuse God of their judgment and their Destiny they know that he's a savior but not theirs and they are so determined but yet still they are able to anoint people to accuse God their Oneness all demons believe in one God but yet they convince many that there's three and when it comes to their own personalities and the way that they view God it's such a strange thing to me so here we come now to when the ages are now going to end it's the end of man's day and it is the day the dawning of the day of the Lord and the tendency of liberal interpreters that will take the scriptures of God and the traits and the attributes of God's love Mercy salvation goodness forgiveness and all of that and them same interpreters don't want to look at the scripture that talks about God's judgment and God's rest but let me just tell you tonight those scriptures are just as real and just as profound as those that describe his grace is that right those that all they're so caught up on the love of God and the mercy of God but you don't hear them talking too much about the wraths of God and the Judgment of God it's just as real and it will happen just as much now you know the word to a real True Believer the word is not lopsided and it's not warped but it takes a real understanding to be able to view God in this right perspective now let's move over from chapter 19 to chapter 20. now notice what happens at the end of this battle this is the battle of Armageddon it's going to be held in the valley of Jezreel that is called or the valley of megetto or the valley of Jehoshaphat very same place given different names in the context so after the Lord Jesus comes out of heaven and then the sword proceeds out of his mouth no doubt a lot of these people will be killed by Atomic Warfare but there will be many of them that will be reserved to be annihilated by the sword that proceeds out of his mouth some of them their bodies will be disintegrated this it will fulfill the scripture in Malachi 4 that the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked notice how God differentiates the deaths and the Judgment of the wicked that some of them will be eaten by vultures some of them will be tore apart by vultures and will be eat by these birds and it's called the Great supper of God and yet others of them will be annihilated and be nothing but Atomic fodder now who's to determine that God himself will we will step out on the ashes of some and on the bones of others because there they will lay and their bodies will be ripped to shreds by these vultures that have come to eat them you say that's awful well they're only getting back what they deserve you see people who turn down the mercy of God they make their own religion and they rewrite God who God is and what God is this is what God's going to give them and pay back I personally don't want none of that myself I don't care what he asked for me to do I want to do it right don't you now watch when it comes to where the beasts and the false prophet which are two separate individuals they will be cast alive into this Lake of Fire which burns with fire and brimstone notice now in Revelation chapter 20 verse 1 and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand now notice how many angels that it takes to throw the devil into the abyss I want you to notice that John does not see a whole Legion which is from two to six thousand he does not see a whole band he does not see an army as a matter of fact he does not even see a cherubim a Zune he does not see an art Archangel he does not even see a noted Angel he sees an angel apparently of minor rank but this Angel is all it takes to grab those through for it and throw him down in the pit Hallelujah notice so I saw an angel now notice John differentiates in the Book of Revelation in the categories and degrees of angels that he would cause them a mighty angel or a great angel or a shining Angel but this one is just an angel so just let you know that no matter what you're going through God don't have to be able to dispense a legion it doesn't take a mighty Angel it doesn't take a great Angel all God has to do is in just one of his ordinary Angels your way and it's way more than what you need Hallelujah now notice this Angel has a key to a certain place and it was a key to the bottomless pit now let's look at this bottomless pit a little bit and let's look at the realm of demons I know it's a world that we know very little about but let's just peer into it for just a little bit from the scripture now before I do I want to let you know something about demons and the Devil Himself and I'm not sure you're aware of but Satan actually has fear that may be something that would seem unusual but demons actually experience fear and Satan experiences fear you can find the prophet saying this in the church age book about the devil that whenever people would come up before him and the spirit of God would start Discerning them and that devil would pick up that he's fixing to be exposed and he's said he would watch the countenance of those people's face as it was changed because Satan hated and was afraid to be exposed now he knows that his end is coming I can't say that I understand him because he can read right here in the Bible and he believes that his end is coming now if you notice system or not but you will but time are done tonight these demons actually know their days are numbered they know the Lord Jesus is going to torment them they know that they're going to this place of the Abyss or the Deep or the pit and they know it is just huh and they're scared to death so what I love to hear is when the tormentors are afraid of Torment amen I read something uh this this year early in the spring about stink bugs y'all know what stink bugs are uh we've got two or three different kinds here in East Tennessee and there's one predominant one which is a brown got a little Touch of Gray on the back of it and the females are mainly the ones that stinks are bad but I was trying to figure out how to get rid of because it got a screened in porch so I've got some up there and they love that place so I was trying to figure out how to do it and what you do well you know you can do this and do this and this and what I thought was so amazing about stink bugs is this they cannot stand stinky smells that's all that's the Bible reminds me of a pole cap that can't stand you know can't stand strong smell but a stink bug cannot stand strong smells it just bothers them and they will not stick around so what I found was that you can take either camphor or you can take some strong oils essential typoles put them in a container with water and put just a few drops inside of there and then pump that dude up and whenever you see them on the Rascals all you got to do is just spray around where they are and then oh I can't stand this I gotta get out of here they can't stand it but yet they themselves are nothing but stink bugs but they don't like stinks or long strong smells and that's what I think about the devil that Devils love to bring fear they love to cause torment but they themselves are so afraid of being exposed they are so afraid of the spirit of God and hang with me now they are scared to death of a man woman boy or girl that knows their position in Christ Jesus and when you get on your knees to pray and you begin to call on the name of the Lord them Devils begin to tremble not because of you and your Humanity but because you in your deity Hallelujah you cannot be destroyed Oh Glory to God now once this instance in Matthew chapter 8 verse 28 and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gagena scenes they met him to possessed with Devils coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce so that no man might pass by that way and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God how did they know who he was what do we have to do with thee Jesus thou Son of God Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time is this the time is this the time when we're going to the pit to the abyss have you come to torment us before the time or is this the time now let me just let you in on something that apparently the demons that are under Satan's control did not know and recognize in the promise of God that there were two comings of the Messiah so when they see him and they see by of course by this time in the scripture Jesus says already been casting out devils and doing Mighty Wonder Works and things like that so they knew there was something different about him and now they are wondering is this our time to go into the pit so they were scared they were afraid because they're going into the pit now now they are not in this place so wherever they are remember II Peter talks about it how that they were kept and they were in a prison life but in that prison they can come and go they can be able to do this and that but once they get assigned into this pit or the Deep or the abyss it's like they know they can never come out so now they are afraid their Destiny has arrived and they are scared to death and I say hahaha now what have we Jesus our son of God Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time now won't you listen to this this strange faith now listen this strange faith that they have so they they know they believe that he is the Son of God and they also believe he has the authority to send them to their Destiny they believe he has the power to speak and they would be forced to leave now can you imagine we're talking about demons but look at their face look how strongly they believed who he was that if if demons could believe that that what about us as children of God if they could believe that can you imagine believing that he is a savior but also knowing he's not your savior What A peculiar face that they had you say of Faith yes they believed they believed and it was a sort of faith that they believed he could speak he could determine their Destiny he would send them to their Destiny but yet at the same time they also knew it was not for them now I find this so amazing because they fight like they are the winners and we act like we're the losers and they can look in the back of the book and they already knew their Destiny was predetermined and somehow they knew they were going to wind up in the abyss or the pit now remember the New Testament was not even written whenever they said this but they are quoting New Testament terms and it's not even wrote down in the New Testament yet and they are confessing the Lord Jesus will send them to their Destiny isn't it amazing Devils knew who he were and preacher said he was a false prophet the church crucified him and Devils testifying who he was well that's about the way it goes isn't it now notice to be able to believe he's a savior but not yours so what did they ask him Art Thou come hither to torment us before the time so this displaced to us the apprehension of the demons that live in that world that no what did they know about him what did they see what did they recognize that the rest of the world could not see there was something about him that must have been Supernatural and phenomenal that they would recognize that so the question it comes back how was they able to see it and yet they did not question him now you ain't got the right you ain't got no Authority you can't do this or that they never even question their Destiny they never even said we should not go to hell we should never have to go there no no no you made a mistake they don't even question it at all their question is is the time arrived we know we're going and we're getting what we deserve but the only question we've got is that now or not we don't know we're not sure if demons could have that kind of faiths and where they're going what are we to have brother Larry if demons can look at that and say well I know where I'm going I'm a devil I know where I'm going and I'm getting exactly what I deserve is this the time of not and we get up and down and in and out well I'm not sure if I'm saved or not well if the Rapture was to go I'm not sure if I'm going if a devil can know her he's going how much more should a son or daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost have confidence in God I know where I'm going I pass from Death unto life I'm not what I was I'm a different person the old man has died I am a new creature in Christ Jesus it ain't just mother Donnie's savior he's mine he ain't just mother random savior He's Mine He's my God he's my redeemer he's my king oh my God so they don't question his authority they don't question his determinant ability to assign them to what they deserve they don't question any of that their main question is has it arrived it's a time for us to go into the abyss and never get out again oh my goodness so they don't say one thing against it now maybe some of you have never been called to cast out devils maybe some of you have seen it happen before I'm sure you have but I've seen it many times even before I come to the message and whenever you deal with a demon-possessed person and you've got a person that's trying to make them leave and you'll watch the reaction of that demon inside that individual and that demon will try to Bluff that preacher or that individual that's trying to cast him out and if he catches the least little bit of question in the heart of that individual that's trying to make him leave you watch him Bluff and you can watch that devil and I did say him because they are him and you'll watch them I don't have to come out I don't have to come out you can't make me come out all Vibes cast someone out several years ago and that demon spoke out of a woman in a man's voice and said I was the one in the Garden of Eden I was the one who come against Eve began to talk and say these things over and over and I forbid him to preach to me I said hold your peace I knew the Book of Genesis I didn't want to hear his account of it well praise the Lord now you see he is a bluff so he will try to Bluff you now I've seen him many times so well then then if that thing goes to try to bucking against the preacher that's casting him out then he will get that edge and the preacher of Satan can pick it up you know just like a dog if you are scared of a dog and you go in a yard that dog may not bother nobody else but your body produces a an element of fear and it will produce a sense that that dog can pick it up and its smell your body produces that and that dog about you nine times out of ten my advice is for you to run like you never run in your life but somebody else can go to the same doll and say shut your mouth and lay down I'm going to tell you limb from limb and you watch that dog's tail and you know where it goes right between its legs and it'll back down and look at you like that why because your body is not putting that out and he can sense and I better keep my bark to myself this old boy's got a pretty good about himself so devils are the same way now they are the king of bluffers and that's why no matter whether your demon possess or where Satan's just trying to fight you in your mind all of you oh you say well I'm not possession of course you don't have to be but he'll still try to Bluff you on being saved being bride being filled with the Holy Ghost God's going to heal you God's going to move for you well you've been praying and God ain't done it he's trying to Bluff you away from your promise he's trying to Bluff you away from your healing but you need to stand right there and say shut up devil get back to hell and leave me alone I believe God word I'm God's son I'm God's daughter get out of my way I am healed I am delivered now what so they quote this about before the time now they know that there is a certain time that's been set aside for them to be judged now we know of course that in the last days when the Great White Throne judgment is set and Satan will be judged and all of those demons which were angels in the presence of God each one of them will be given their own judgment oh my goodness what a time that's going to be now the demons not recognizing the Messianic coming was going to be divided Isaiah 61 into two advents so they no doubt they were kind of confused by the joy and trying to understand now wait a minute the son of David things Psalms 2 Zechariah 7 Zechariah 14. what about all that what about a Micah 4 2 aren't those things going to come about so they were looking at it but here was an advent that they didn't understand you see it was that coming of the Messiah that confused the the Jews and the great teachers and they was looking for the son of David but instead he come as son of man Prophet right and then he come back on the day of Pentecost as the Son of God and the next coming we know of course was to be a son of man according to Luke 17 30. in the last days and then this coming is what the son of David to set upon the throne so these demons were kind of confused about the time they said well there's the time right are we going to the pit so notice this in Mark chapter 5 verse 1. and they came over into the other side of the sea and to the country of the Gatherings and when he was come out of the ship immediately they met him out of the tombs a man was an unclean spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains but and because they had often bound him with Fetters and chains I listened to strength that this demon would give to this man and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the Fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him now notice the word tame like you would try to tame an animal what a degenerate State a demon-possessed person can get into it and they have Supernatural power you've seen them before of course they can have Supernatural Powers just phenomenal some of the things that I've seen before and watched when people get under that influence you just think it's almost it's almost impossible for it to happen but these demons when they fell from their original estate they still kept that delegated authority given to them by God so that's why they can appear disappear angels of life and all of that now watch and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying oh and cutting himself you see there is a move and has been around for a long time where some of our young people will cut themselves well you see this is not a Godly example this is not an example of someone with the Holy Ghost trying to do this so what influence is it from the Devil you remember the false prophets upon the mountain when they begin to call upon their gods and what did they do cut themselves so it's demonic I'm not saying a person who doesn't now is full of the devil but the devil is certainly anointing them now notice this man so he was in the tombs what a place to live in a graveyard so he was in the tombs and and but his his emotions was a mixture of power Anointed with demonic influence and yet human weakness at the same time because the man would displace such power that that runner for a close by the friend that chain him and put Fetters and bonds on him and they'd be able to tackle him down and maybe waddle him down like a wild animal and just in a few minutes he'd be like like Samson was he just popped them chains off of him and the Fetters and then you would carry maybe growling like some sort of animal and then he'd weep and mourn and cry the anointing of the devil would move on him and then whenever he would do these things it would retract and he would kind of come to himself and he was a miserable creature oh Lord God notice this and when Jesus when he saw Jesus author off he ran and worshiped him a demon-possessed man and cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God first time in the New Testament these terms are used most high God this is the name he appeared to Abraham in elyon most high God and yes your demons are quoting this name of God what's his authority now what he says I a Jersey wow so this demon has enough boldness to say to the Lord Jesus I assure you I challenge you I demand an answer of you ah you're talking to the wrong one buddy I adjure Thee by God that thou torment me not ah now we see it the word torment means pain vex to question by applying torture to be harassed that's what I love to do to devils I love to apply torture by questioning how much longer you think you got devil Before You cast into the pit how much longer you think you got before God's Gonna heal me of this Affliction or whatever it is I'm dealing with I love to apply pressure you see friend we're living so far beneath our privilege because we somehow we tend to think that the devil is the only one that has the right to question and he always questions us well what about your failure and what about this and what about that and then if he goes with that then he'll say well how come God ain't healed you how come God ain't done that how can God you need to understand your rights that you've also got a right to question him well I wonder how much longer devil you got before Jesus is going to cast you down into the pit I wonder how many more days you're going to bother me with that headache or that back ache before I'm going to come shouting out of that bed talking about the power of God I wonder how much our devil oh you said that Old Devil hangs around me all the time well apparently you make it pretty comfortable for him so if you go to question in him at applying the pressure on him you might find out you got a little bit more peace and quiet oh my God he cried with a loud voice what have I to do with thee Jesus thou son of the most high God I maturity by God torment me not to question by applying torture to be harassed or distressed of those who are at Sea that are struggling with the headwind so you're at Sea and you're Roar you're roaring and you're pulling the oars and man you're roaring I'm telling you you're doing everything you know to do and there's a great big strong headwind any of you have ever flown on an airplane and you know what that is right ahead when and her tailwind and if you're meeting a headwind I've flown in them before overseas over the Pacific and over the Atlantic Ocean that 150 200 miles an hour headwind so that means that the headwind is flying and moving at 200 miles an hour and you're flying into it at 550 miles an hour and then the pilot will tell you because of this strong headwind it's going to take us longer to get there it's going to take us another 45 minutes or another hour but the the good part about it is I've also had the parties to come on and say ladies and gentlemen we have a strong 120 mile an air tailwind and because of that Tailwind we're going to arrive sooner than we thought because that tail man instead of pushing against you it's pushing for you Oh Glory to God I believe friends I am totally convinced that you and I fight a lot of headwind when we ought to be riding on the tailwind and it's because we let the devil tell us you've got to do this and you've got to do that you need to start questioning that's all y'all said and said how long does it be for you're going to be thrown in the pit oh boy how long is it going to be before the Lord God delivers me how long is it going to be before you're cast into the deep [Applause] so the next time he wants to have a conversation with you but keep having one of them cheers our brother foreign did you well sit down I'm going to harass you I found out last night I'm a Holy Ghost Field son or daughter of God I put up as your mouse I put up in your lip I've done realize I've done listening to a bunch of junk and a bunch of lies and a bunch of garbage that I do not have to put up with so if you're gonna stay in here today sit down and shut up because I've got a bunch of questions for you [Applause] as the time arrived I don't know the day I don't know the eye but I want to tell you your days are numbered you're gonna be thrown in the pit you're gonna be annihilated you're going to be destroyed so a devil I just like to shout around you a little bit and just tell you you're gonna be cast into the Lake of Fire hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] so I think I'll leave him there and preach to him a little bit so the Tormentor anticipating and dreading torment and entreating for exemption I surely thee by God boy and animation how religious he can be my Otis in Luke chapter 8 verse 20 29. he commanded the unclean Spirit to come out of the man for often times it called him and he was kept down with chains and in Fetters did he break the bands and was driven of the devil Into the Wilderness and Jesus asked him saying what is thy name question time and he said Legion because many devils were entered into him now the prophet tells us in the little sermon prodigal son 19-15 that this guy was a good guy married man had kids had a family but he started with one little thing might have been drinking might have been lying and then one devil entered and another and another and another let me tell you something friend I don't care who you are how old you are ain't none of us can outsmart the devil oh you're playing with this sin and that same time well I'm good I'm good no you're not good they none of us good enough and powerful enough to be able to withstand this demonic Force especially in this last day and they noticed they they now if you notice whenever this comes about and Jesus asks what is your name and one person answers one person answers but look how it changes in verse 31. and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep now they're getting scared so he said what's your name or my name is Legion one spokesman and then they all go to get nervous you know it's so lots of prophet whenever he would under discernment somebody would come up in a prayer line they might have cancer whatever more and he would stand there for a minute and get silencing hear it on the tape and he would say that person sitting right back there you've got the same thing and this person over yours got the same thing because I can see a dark streak going from this one to that one now what were they doing they were communicating in the fourth dimension can't you hear him he said can't you hear them this one is crying for help and he would all say also say I hear him begging for mercy oh my begging for mercy Devils begging for mercy or you say boy I'll tell you brother what am I awesome to bend that Prophet no doubt it would have been but let me just bring it on down to you in your day when the weakest Christian gets down on their knees to pray it makes hell turn me you imagine a son or daughter of God that knows who they are and they go to praying for that Wayward boy that Wayward girl that Wayward husband or wife and they go to believe in God no matter what they feel no matter if they speak in tongues or not they believe God's word in them Devils out of hell go to shaken and trembling why because the saint of God has more Authority on the earth that an archangel in heaven that's a quote a child of God down on their knees oh Hallelujah believe in the Lord is going to set him free and them Devils get all tore up hmm and they basalt begged pleaded that he would not command they recognized his authority that he would not command them to go out into the deep now this is the same exact same word that's used in The Book of Revelation for the bottomless pit the Greek word is abusos which means bottomless pit on fathomed boundless Abyss so the demons believe in God and they tremble they believe they will get a just judgment and it makes them afraid they believe and know they are Beyond Redemption how can you say that brother Donnie because there's no Redemption for an angel once it crosses the line Once An Angel ever sells out his allegiance to Satan and turns against the kingdom of God there is no Redemption Jesus never died for Angels he died for sinners then God blessed you our friends so they know this about God's character and they know their Destiny is already determined and yet they fight him they fight his kingdom they fight his economy they fight his people as if though somehow they can still win but they know they know me on the side of the dove he has power ultimate power to assign them to their Destiny say why you keep saying that if they can believe that and their Devils cannot we believe the other way we are children of God I ask you now well why are you going I ask you devil can you get back you can't tell the truth can you but I'll tell the truth for you you're going to the pit you're beyond Redemption you cannot get back but guess what I got back these people gone by was not going to the pen the pit was where I was taken from but I'm going back to this head I'm going to Paradise [Applause] they admit they have to obey his voice I don't want to tell anyone I'm praying for our Saints whether it's folks that are part of our immediate church family or people on the phone or people around the world or whoever it is that I pray for them for the sick and this and that you know uh I'll wait I know how Patiently I wish sometimes for that unction from the Holy One to where it is more than my words and it is more than my voice you understand what I'm saying when the spirit of God will cry out of you and pray out of you how many has ever had it happen well of course many of you have and we know we can do it and we continue to do it of course but there's times that he supernaturally will come and he will speak out of our human vessel and he himself will take our voice and it sounds just like our voice but it's not so much the first voice that you hear but it's the voice behind the voice that makes the devil leave Oh Glory to God I'll tell you friend as a servant of God it's one of the most awesome experiences in your entire life I've shouted I've spoken tongues I you know I had different experiences with God but when the Lord God will take your voice and actually speak to an unseen demon in an Unseen World in an unseen realm that you yourself know hardly anything about and the spirit of God will speak to that devil and that devil will turn that person loose whether it's drug addiction whether it's alcohol whether it's homosexuality whatever it is and the spirit of God will set them free and you know it's not you all you were was just a microphone just like this right here but the Holy Ghost took care of vocal cords he took your lips he transmitted that thought down and that devil recognized not your Authority so much but the authority of the same Son of God don't you understand why that Satan hates the Church of the Living God because the truth of it is the Lord Jesus wants his body to do the exact same thing that we read in these scriptures that's why the devil wants us this message people just to become a cold bunch of theologians with no Supernatural power of God and we come to church and sit there and we just don't move we don't worship we don't sing we don't do nothing I tell one thing we will never get to heaven that's not being a dried up Touch of unbelievers or a bunch of church members the Lord God wants to manifest himself as the same yesterday today and forever he still heals the sin he still casts off Devils he still delivers his children and since the cat they're free amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever oh Hallelujah [Applause] demons recognized Jesus had authority over them They begged They begged don't send us sir please don't send us to the abyss to the bottomless pit it's amazing this story here because you have three instances of people begging well the first category when actually people is demons They begged to not be cast into the pit the abyss the bottomless pit once the people of that area heard this man was healed They begged Jesus to leave can you imagine Jesus Christ does this and brother but the people of that Community went out there and begged the Lord Jesus to leave do you know geographically who these people were they were descendants a part of those that did not cross Jordan and wanted to stay on this side and get their inheritance and many generations later here's the Lord Jesus himself and they're still doing the same thing refusing to cross over and get the inheritance of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so can you imagine you'd rather have a man out of his mind your wife couldn't even go by that vicinity your children couldn't even go by that vicinity because this man don't you get up you sit right there I'm not done preaching it's not I forgot about him then you all know I want a torment that outfit your wife couldn't go by that area your children couldn't go by that area and the Lord Jesus delivers this man and you would rather have him there like he was so the demons begged the people begged and then this man that the demons left the Bible said he Basalt which is to mean beg his begging was this Lord Jesus let me go with you let me travel with you but the Bible tells us that Jesus told him no now Jesus answered the petitions of the demons and he answered the petition of those who didn't want him there but he didn't answer the petition of the man who asked for something that was seemingly good why he was asking for the wrong thing and the Lord Jesus told him he said no no you're not going it was me but what I want you to do is go back to your home and your family and tell them notice tell them what great things God has done for you and the Bible said he went back to his home there and told them what great things Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh this man must have had an insight into the godhead Hallelujah don't tell them what God has done for you you imagine him getting down there whenever you come down that old Island and the prophet said his little wife was out there and she took over and he said oh honey honey I'm changed I'm changed his little young and sowing and the people of the city saw him but he said I'm Different I met a man I met a man that he took my life and he changed me can't you see why Jesus didn't want him traveling around but he said go back to your house go back to your wife go back to your children oh praise be to God look in Revelation chapter 9 verse 1. and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star from Heaven unto the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit ah now this is Revelation chapter 9 and the other is Revelation chapter 20. he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit so you see even the pit and the key links together with certain dispensations of what's released out of it now no doubt them Devils would have loved to come out of there he said you said where you are don't you come near that door smack you down in there you hear me so God allowed smoke to come out of the very same existence but it was not time for the devil to come out nor time for these others to go in and there came out of smoke of locust upon the Earth and unto them were given power as the Scorpions of the Earth have power now notice in verse 11. and I had a king over them which is the angel Lord have mercy you imagine an angel giving a Dominion of the bottomless pit which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is a baton but in the Greek tongue hath its name apollyon chapter 11 verse 7 and when they had finished their testimony the prophets Moses and Elijah the Beast now to send us out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and overcome them and kills them now what's amazing is the Bible tells us when this happened that they will not allow Moses and Elijah's bodies to be buried so they will lay in the streets of the city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt for also our Lord was crucified that's what Revelation says which was Jerusalem not whenever they would not allow their bodies to be buried so what does God do when God kills these others he said don't bury them don't give them no ceremony but leave their carcasses out on the face of the Earth that's what they've done to my prophets that's what I'll do to them look for in God has a law whatsoever your sow that shall you also read you're so trouble guess what you're going to reap you're so arrogance guess what you're going to reap well come on now you saw an attitude that you think you're better than other people you realize you're going to reap that one day there's only one person better than all people and that's the Lord Jesus and the rest of us are dirt bags now your dirt bag May cost a little more than my dirt bag but you're still a dirt bag that's right you're a silly human being and you still stink under your arms and you've got a bad breath of a morning well come on now you may put a 500 mink coat on the prophet said it that way and he said stick your nose up in the iron if it rained it drowns you and you may think you're really something but you know what give yourself about seven to two hours after life leaves that body that you're making idle out of and see what happens to you the most beautiful women in the world the most handsome and the woman in the world you know what happens to them they become like a deer that's run over you've seen them and now in the last several weeks this time of the year it increases of course deer laying on the side of the road and yet within a few weeks or months whatever more what happens to them if it's a big buck he's got great big beautiful horns and and the bones and all the skin and everything there what goes hell what happens to that big pile of a deer laying there goes right back into the nutrients of the earth what happens to a human body do whatever you want to with it embalm it have you seen some of them guys that's been embalmed don't you I'd rather wind up looking like a bunch of dust and I will their mummies wow that's ugliest looking thing you've ever seen in your life and they're going to take that in the afterlife goodness no Give Me Jesus I want that old carcass to go over their skin draped over a rack of Bones no sir let me have a brand new body because I follow his word so there's none of us that's better than anybody else we all need Jesus we all need the Holy Ghost we all need to be saved and there's only one great one among us and that's this great Lord Jesus Revelation 17 8 the Beast that thou sawest was and there's not and Shout Ascend out of the bottomless pit now it's amazing that these other demons once they were assigned to the pit they couldn't come out but the king here apollyon and a baton he can still Ascend and descend move in and out at leisure until the day of his judgment arrives notice who's going to go into this shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into Perdition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in The Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is so a pope then he dies then another one is and he dies is and is not and yet is what is it the power moves from one to another to another don't you understand where he got that symbol at don't you understand why a word that he always impersonates God the holy ghost that was on Peter James and John and then what did God do the seven breaks Menorah what would they do they would take one light lit by the Holy Fire of God then they would take that candle and pull it out and light the other and the other and the other and the other that's why the prophet of God was sent to bring a message of restoration that would restore us back to the original lighting of the original fire that came on the day of Pentecost and friends I don't know if you're aware of or not but there is a move in and around our message that is gaining momentum that they don't want that old-fashioned fire no more they don't want that old-fashioned enlightened from that original Pillar of Fire but it's a water down mental conception of believing that God sent her prophet and many of you can live however you want to live that's a lie right out of the pits of hell it'll never change a life it'll never produce a new virus we've got to be lit little to see it has to be lit by the original Pillar of Fire just like Peter had God wants this church to have the same holy ghost that he gave to him on the book of Acts chapter 2. what's that praise be to God notice Revelation chapter 20 verse 2. now this Angel comes down with the key to the bottom of his pit and he has a chain in his hand then verse 2 says and he not they but he laid whole on the Dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan isn't it amazing how many different titles he has notice what he calls him the Dragon that old serpent the devil and Satan I love this and bound him a thousand years praise be to God aren't you glad that's our Great Mighty conqueror the Lord Jesus come up and put a seal on him not by the log chain but a chain of circumstance he can't go out no more till the thousand years were finished the prophet said we know the great day of the last rain when Satan will be bound and chained with a chain of circumstance he cannot come out and deceive the Nations no more until the Thousand Years the millennial reign will take place on the earth while we're here glorifying our Lord Jesus and adoring him and crowning him the King of Kings and the Lord of lords praise be to God oh Lord hasten the day how many wants to be ready to meet him with all your heart you can go on out there but I don't want you said my brother Keith just go on out that back door Hallelujah [Applause] oh children no matter what you're facing tonight if you can get a hold to the voice of God and speak to your trouble speak to your sickness your anxiety what you're going through that same Lord Jesus has got the same power tonight oh Hallelujah you believe it yes how many has the need in your heart your body your walk is God whatever it is those of you streaming the service raise your hand as well let's just go before the Lord right now in prayer Lord Jesus we're so thankful to know tonight dear God that we win this war Hallelujah if these demons could have such confidence and such faiths in you and in your power they knew if you would have told them to go into the abyss the bottomless pit right then they would not be able to possess another human but instead you allowed them to go into this swine this herd of pigs and it drove those pigs out of their mind and they ran down a steep place and run into the water and they were choked and of course them demons come out of them Hogs and they went out looking for other places to be able to habitate Lord God if Devils can beg you for mercy oh Lord what about us as children of God father whatever devil might be trying to torment your children tonight under the sound of my voice sickness disease heartache trouble whatever it is Lord May the spirit of God I pray anoint their face tonight we know there's times that we must fight this battle with our faith and then those Sublime moments when you know that we cannot go any farther but it's just our human Faith you intervene for us and you speak out of our lips and anoint us with your face Lord God father I pray for those tonight maybe they're they're at that place that time in their life and they need you so much Lord would you move for him Jesus Lord God we don't want you to make it so easy for us that we never struggle or have any hardships or anything but God you know how we are sometimes we get to a place that seemed like we can't go any farther help us tonight Jesus Lord God we believe you we love you we worship you mighty God Hallelujah we bless your name tonight father while we're in your presence you have honored Us by coming into this place tonight Lord every time we've met you on the Holiday Inn since we've sold our other property there's not been one service that you haven't showed up not one service that you haven't been here with us so it's it's been different for us for sure it's not our own and all of that but you've not disappointed one time and we believe tonight will be no different Lord we call Upon Your Name Lord Jesus would you come by this way and bring healing father would you bring Deliverance Lord would you set the captive free oh Lord God those that are bound with besetting sins and maybe habits that they've tried to break on their own and they just can't seem to do it May the spirit of God pass this way tonight if a devil can believe you're a savior but yet no you're not his and he can have faith in you to believe that you will determine and control his destiny how much more can we as the Sons and Daughters of God tonight believe that you're not only a savior but you're our savior not only believe that you control and determine our destiny but we believe you predetermined our destiny to be a part of your word before the foundation of the world so we don't have to go through this life wandering and pondering and hoping maybe we'll be saved somehow we we hope that we will no Lord we can have an assurance because the token brings an assurance that we have passed from deaths unto life we look at what we were and we look at what we are and what took place Jesus took place in the middle of that and that's why we're changed and will never be the same again hallelujah hallelujah oh it gives us Faith about our destiny so we're not begging you tonight it's demons oh don't cast us into the abyss don't cast us into the Lake of Fire no we're not even praying such a prayer because that's not where we're ordained to go that's not our home but you hewed us out of the pit that was not the abyss it was the pit and the mar of our sin and the Maori clay that we found ourselves in but you pulled us out of the pit you wiped us off you Sanctified us you cleanse us you filled us with the Holy Ghost you come and lived inside of our body and made our body a tabernacle of the Lord God oh Father Here We Are Tonight to worship you we raise our hands Lord if this man being so demon-possessed yet whenever you come across that devil come and bowed and that man and worshiped you if the devil would Worship You shame

brother Mike Wallace father so we want brother Mike few world coming and just say a few words say if you would in this Mission Prayer I would appreciate brother Mike coming I told him yesterday I guess it was that time over the church and brother Mike's the type of preacher that kind of sneaks in because he don't want you to feel obligated you know to use him or anything like that I really can't condemn him for that because I we certainly love our brother so I appreciate anybody it's been a real friend greedy would feel like foreign just real quick I'm thankful that the Lord has blessed us with places to worship I know you've been in this hotel for a few months we've been written a seven-day Adventist Church for a few years about 25. and they just got a new pastor and he's not real nice that I can tell yet and we need prayer to get over this little hunt so we can continue worshiping the Lord but you know what I was sitting there thinking if he needs to put us in a hotel I like this ain't bad so we thank God but you know I was thinking our brothers and sisters in Ukraine we've helped a family to get to our area and there's a family living with one of our brothers in the church and their homes back in Ukraine have been completely destroyed there's no land for them to live on and you know we had a prophet that said the last Vision he saw was the U.S smoldering in Ash and I was thinking today Lord you blessed us we got more junk and storage sheds in our yards and these people are struggling just to survive so we had a little a little part of helping a couple of families to get over here out of that tragedy we just know that God's in control and we know that we're near the end closer than we've ever imagined we have nothing to complain about it's the blessings of the Lord we're here this far he's given us the warning signs and we should be more than ready to go out brother Donnie said it so well we should not be afraid of what this Devil's saying
