[0:01] What is the expected result for the
[0:03] gospel? What is he trying to do? What
[0:07] does he want from the gospel? What does
[0:09] he want it to do in our life? Is it
[0:13] supposed to make life easy? Is it
[0:15] supposed to make our life more
[0:17] convenient? Is it supposed to to make us
[0:20] win every single battle that we face?
[0:23] What is the purpose? What is the outcome
[0:25] that he that he desires for our life? Is
[0:28] it to give us a greater knowledge of his
[0:30] word? Is that what the the gospel is
[0:32] about? Just to give us more knowledge in
[0:34] our minds. Is it did did he send a
[0:37] message in this last day for to give us
[0:40] a a greater faith in the supernatural
[0:43] and and and the way the the brother
[0:45] would just relay and we would see in his
[0:47] ministry just the mindblowing
[0:49] supernatural that lived in this
[0:51] brother's life and the greatest healing
[0:53] ministry since the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:55] himself.
[0:58] Is it just to provide us with the social
[1:00] structure of people that we fellowship
[1:02] with, people that we hang out with,
[1:04] people that that we just we we uh these
[1:07] are our people that that just this is
[1:09] our group. This is who we are. Is that
[1:11] the purpose of the gospel? Every one of
[1:13] them things is good.
[1:15] Nothing wrong with them. We need them.
[1:17] But the purpose of the gospel is to call
[1:19] the elect of Jesus Christ.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; It's to bring deliverance to the people
[1:25] of God. It is to change lives of the
[1:28] people of God.
[1:30] That is the very purpose of this gospel.
[1:33] [panting]
[1:34] What effect is it supposed to be having
[1:36] on my life, on your life?
[1:40] Is it to make us more spiritual as we
[1:43] see it? Because I'll be honest with you,
[1:45] life sometimes just feels like life. You
[1:48] know, I go to church. Um I worship the
[1:51] Lord. I feed on the word. We go to work.
[1:54] We we we do our jobs, we spend time with
[1:57] our family, and it just seems like just
[1:59] m uh problems on top of problems. It
[2:02] just seems like life. So what is is it
[2:05] it the scripture even says that all
[2:07] things work together for our good.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; Is and and we think all things working
[2:13] for good. You would think that that
[2:15] would bring perfect peace in our home
[2:17] all the time. Is it, you know, uh, you
[2:19] would think that all of our loved ones
[2:21] would be saved and they they wouldn't
[2:23] have loved ones tonight out in the world
[2:24] or out in in in false beliefs and
[2:28] [panting]
[2:31] is it is it just to provide us with a
[2:33] healthy body?
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; See friend, his view of good is so very
[2:41] different from our view of good.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; See, he thinks with a mind that is
[2:46] eternal. He thinks on the eternal. His
[2:49] love is an elective eternal love. And he
[2:52] and he works with that in mind. He he
[2:54] works in your life with that in mind.
[2:56] And he is willing to sacrifice if if
[2:59] that if necessary some some a little bit
[3:01] of peace and a little bit of comfort in
[3:04] our lives if that's what it takes to
[3:06] work what he's trying to work in your
[3:08] life to make you what he wants and he
[3:11] desires for you to be.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[3:17] &gt;&gt; We we as us as humans, we're so bound by
[3:20] time and everything we do, we think
[3:22] about the American dream, you know, and
[3:24] it's all about go we we're taught as a
[3:26] kid you you go through school and and
[3:29] and and you do your best to make the
[3:31] grades and then you go to college and
[3:32] and and then after that you get the job
[3:34] and you buy the house and you get
[3:36] married and everything is based on a
[3:38] timeline. That's how our minds work and
[3:40] and we're always working toward that.
[3:42] His mind doesn't go that way. He knows
[3:44] the beginning from the end.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; He knows what we need and that's good.
[3:50] And what we need is not always
[3:51] convenient. Most of the time it's not
[3:54] convenient.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; I read this week or Brother Brandham
[3:56] said that a church that I can't remember
[3:58] his exact wording, but a church that is
[4:00] not hurting is not a church of God.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; We've got to go through things.
[4:07] [sighs]
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Why does it feel like we lose so many
[4:11] battles?
[4:13] And how can that possibly serve his
[4:15] purpose?
[4:17] &gt;&gt; So much loss, it seems like, has been
[4:20] amplified in our lives in the last few
[4:22] years. You know, so many friends that we
[4:25] love and uh and family that we love and
[4:27] we have prayed for and we've talked to
[4:29] and we've witnessed to and and live the
[4:31] life in front of them. We've watched
[4:33] them turn and walk away from his word
[4:35] and um leaving the message. We and so
[4:38] many of us have dealt with the loss of
[4:40] loved ones and and people that were so
[4:42] so dear to our heart and people that
[4:44] believed him, people that trusted him,
[4:46] real believers,
[4:49] and watched them just watched him just
[4:50] take them.
[4:53] It seems at times like he just takes and
[4:56] takes. I'm just going to be real with
[4:57] you for a minute. It feels like it's
[5:01] not. We know it's not true, but it feels
[5:03] like he just takes and he takes and he
[5:06] breaks us and he breaks us time and time
[5:08] again.
[5:11] Negative reports everywhere we turn. I
[5:14] promise you we're going to turn this.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[5:16] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we feel like Job
[5:18] while you know, you go to the doctor,
[5:20] you and he's and I I I was at the
[5:22] doctor's office uh having him check my
[5:24] having him check my shoulder and we're
[5:26] going to proceed with the shoulder
[5:27] surgery. And then well that turned into
[5:29] hey also you got before we can do the
[5:30] shoulder surgery we got to work on your
[5:32] neck and actually probably before we
[5:34] need to work on your neck we really need
[5:35] to work on your low back your spine is
[5:37] shifting it's like Job you know it's
[5:39] like while he yet spake another one came
[5:41] running and that's what life feels like
[5:43] sometime you're going through the fire
[5:45] you're going through things that are so
[5:47] hard and and literally while you're
[5:48] going through it another thing and
[5:50] another thing and another thing comes
[5:54] and there's a reason behind it because
[5:56] he is molding something in you.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; He is making a lady that is that is that
[6:02] is worthy to stand beside of him to
[6:05] judge the world with him to reign with
[6:08] him or an enlex lady with a special
[6:11] character.
[6:13] Character does not come easy. It's hard
[6:19] &gt;&gt; character is a victory. You've got to
[6:21] fight for it
[6:24] &gt;&gt; when it comes. If you want to just tuck
[6:27] tail and run, you will never get there.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; I believe he's leading us to a place to
[6:32] where we just no longer just rely on
[6:35] just faith alone,
[6:37] but we trust him.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; When it don't work out like we thought
[6:41] it would, it don't work out like we
[6:44] prayed that it would.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; But God, I trust you. If you lead me, if
[6:49] you lead me to my grave, I will trust
[6:51] you. Yes.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; I don't understand what he's doing in so
[6:55] many of our lives. I don't need to
[6:57] understand it. I know what he's doing.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; He is making us.
[7:05] We pray and he's silent. Nothing moves.
[7:09] Just wonder, do you not hear me anymore?
[7:12] Trust is born through those quiet times
[7:16] when you hear nothing. You feel nothing.
[7:20] But I know him. I know the type of man
[7:23] that he is. And I'm going to hold on to
[7:25] him. And I'm going to follow him
[7:26] regardless.
[7:31] &gt;&gt; Have we somehow gotten out of line with
[7:33] this purpose to cause this?
[7:37] [panting and sighs]
[7:37] &gt;&gt; I told my wife and kids, and I got
[7:39] corrected by them, too. I was like, I
[7:42] feel like I'm cursed.
[7:44] I feel like everything that I touch
[7:46] blows up in my face.
[7:50] Let me tell you right off that is not
[7:53] God that is telling you that
[7:55] &gt;&gt; he does not curse his children. He
[7:58] allows things to come but it's the enemy
[8:00] that steps in and tries to tell you that
[8:03] he's got something against you. Tries to
[8:05] tell you that you're cursed.
[8:09] [sighs]
[8:10] [gasps]
[8:11] &gt;&gt; He wants to cause us to question the
[8:13] love of our God.
[8:15] Remind yourself in those moments who
[8:19] your [screaming] God is.
[8:22] He is the same savior, healer,
[8:26] deliverer, giver of peace, giver of joy
[8:30] &gt;&gt; that he always was.
[8:33] Remember what he has done for you as an
[8:36] individual when you were walking through
[8:38] the fire.
[8:40] He is the same God that called you. He
[8:43] is the same God that delivered you. He
[8:46] is the same God that has healed your
[8:48] body so many times. He is the same God
[8:51] that opened your eyes to his word. He
[8:54] has not changed.
[8:57] [panting]
[8:58] [sighs and gasps]
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Remember who you are, sons and daughters
[9:01] of God. [panting]
[9:04] You're not cursed. You are highly
[9:07] favored. That is why the fire has been
[9:10] turned up in your life.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; [sighs and gasps]
[9:15] &gt;&gt; You are where you are right now because
[9:18] he has a purpose for your life. He is
[9:21] making something out of you.
[9:26] He is changing you. [sighs]
[9:29] [gasps]
[9:30] Amen.
[9:32] Amen.
[9:33] Why did God become a man?
[9:38] I'm going to answer. We're going to
[9:39] answer this just by asking a question.
[9:42] Why did he become a man?
[9:45] Why did God create a blood cell in in
[9:49] the womb of Mary
[9:52] to be protected in the womb of a woman
[9:55] who was in need of salvation?
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Born. He was born by hard labor just
[10:01] like every single one of us were
[10:04] to grow up and be taught by a woman
[10:09] to live a [screaming] life of hardship.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Almighty God
[10:15] in flesh produced a life of hardship.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; I hope somebody's hearing me tonight.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; He lived a life of poverty. He was not a
[10:28] wealthy man.
[10:30] [panting]
[10:31] &gt;&gt; He was homeless. He had no place to lay
[10:34] his head.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; The scripture says that he was
[10:38] undesirable. There was nothing that you
[10:40] would look at him and say, "I desire
[10:42] this man. I desire to be like this man."
[10:45] [snorts]
[10:46] Rumors of illegitimate birth hanging
[10:49] over his head. He was despised and
[10:51] rejected of men.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; A man of sorrows.
[10:57] What a what a description. A man of
[11:00] sorrows
[11:02] and acquainted with grief. Him and grief
[11:05] were well were well acquainted.
[11:07] [panting]
[11:08] He knew what it was like to be alone. He
[11:10] knew what it was like.
[11:14] [sighs]
[11:18] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus was being shaped into
[11:21] something.
[11:23] [sighs]
[11:24] He was being shaped into the our
[11:27] intercessor
[11:29] [snorts]
[11:30] &gt;&gt; in order to intercede for me. He had to
[11:33] feel what I feel.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; He had to fight what I fight.
[11:41] He felt the pull so strong that it hurt.
[11:46] Just like me and just like you.
[11:50] Come on.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 2 says that for in that
[11:54] he himself suffered being tempted. You
[11:57] ever suffer with something that hurts
[12:00] bad?
[12:03] He was so pulled at him. Certain things
[12:05] pulled at him so hard you think it
[12:07] didn't pull on him when Satan offered
[12:10] him an easier way.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Brother says, you see, he himself
[12:18] suffered. He learned obedience by the
[12:21] things that he suffered. He was actually
[12:23] made perfect
[12:25] by the things that he suffered. Hebrews
[12:27] chapter 5, though he were a son, yet he
[12:29] learned obedience by the things that he
[12:32] suffered. And being made perfect, he
[12:34] became the author of eternal salvation
[12:36] unto them that obey him. In plain
[12:39] language, the very character of Jesus
[12:42] was perfected by suffering. And
[12:44] according to Paul, he has left a measure
[12:47] of suffering that for his church that
[12:49] they too by their faith while suffering
[12:51] for him would come to a place of
[12:53] perfection. If God made flesh had to go
[12:57] through this, if he had to walk through
[13:00] the fire, how do we think that we can
[13:03] possibly get there another way? How do
[13:06] we think
[13:08] that we can reign by his side and to be
[13:10] able to be worthy to judge by his side?
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Take courage. Take encouragement,
[13:17] friends.
[13:20] [panting]
[13:21] He is working on you
[13:24] to prepare you to be his bride. [sighs]
[13:29] Think it not strange
[13:31] concerning the fiery trials that you go
[13:34] through.
[13:36] We must have character to be fit to
[13:39] judge.
[13:43] See, Jesus understood his purpose.
[13:47] He understood it.
[13:50] He found his purpose just like us.
[13:54] He found it in the word.
[13:57] Yeah.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 4 after he'd been Jesus had
[14:01] gone to the river and and the spirit had
[14:03] descended on him and he goes into the to
[14:05] the mountain for 40 days to be tempted.
[14:07] He he comes out and he goes into the
[14:09] temple and the the book was delivered to
[14:11] him.
[14:12] Jesus took the book and he and he opened
[14:14] to the place where it said the spirit of
[14:16] the Lord is upon me
[14:20] &gt;&gt; because he hath anointed me to preach
[14:22] the gospel to the poor. He had sent me
[14:24] to heal the brokenhearted, to preach
[14:27] deliverance to the captives, the
[14:29] recovering of sight to the blind, and to
[14:31] set at liberty them that are bruised, to
[14:33] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[14:35] He then closed the book, gave it back to
[14:37] the minister, and he said, "This day,
[14:40] this scripture is fulfilled in your
[14:42] ears." You see, understanding his
[14:45] purpose gave Jesus, it released the
[14:47] power to walk in it.
[14:53] You see within him was gold.
[14:56] [snorts]
[14:57] There were attributes that he purposed
[15:00] to reveal to his children
[15:02] such as savior, healer, deliverer, etc.
[15:05] [panting]
[15:06] Brother went so far to say God being a
[15:09] savior, it was necessary that he
[15:11] predestinate a man that would require
[15:13] salvation in order to give himself a
[15:15] reason and purpose of being.
[15:18] You see, God has to have a sense of
[15:20] purpose just like we do.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; And we give him that sense of purpose.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; He exists for this purpose. He lives for
[15:32] this purpose. He lives for the
[15:35] opportunity to change our lives. He
[15:38] lives for the opportunity to set us
[15:41] free.
[15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:45] [sighs and panting]
[15:48] He exists for his purpose.
[15:51] He is consumed by his purpose.
[15:56] And he went out fulfilling his purpose.
[15:59] Calling the elect of God from all walks
[16:02] of life from fishermen and tradesmen to
[16:04] prostitutes and and whatever more. He
[16:06] went out calling the elect of God. Amen.
[16:11] healing the sick
[16:14] and the afflicted.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he lives to heal his
[16:19] children. He exists to bring deliverance
[16:22] to us.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; I know that might be simple. I've been
[16:26] told that I'm simple. I'm too simple.
[16:28] But if I ever get so so big that this
[16:32] does not matter to me anymore, God help
[16:35] me.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Because he this was his purpose. This is
[16:40] why he came. This is why the gospel
[16:43] existed back then and that is why it
[16:47] exists today
[16:48] &gt;&gt; to change our lives.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; To bring deliverance to the captives.
[16:56] I think about the little woman found in
[16:58] adultery.
[16:59] Life so bound by sin. Yeah,
[17:04] &gt;&gt; I can relate so well cuz you feel so
[17:07] dirty and so hopeless and there's no way
[17:09] that you could possibly be welcome. And
[17:12] the way that he stepped in and changed
[17:14] that little woman's life and when he
[17:15] knelt down and wrote in the sand and
[17:17] then stands up and says,"Woman, where
[17:19] are your accusers?" And
[17:23] he exists. He lives to change our lives.
[17:27] That's what he works on continually.
[17:33] He is consumed by his love for his
[17:36] elect.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; He lives to bring liberty to the
[17:44] oppressed.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; I think about brother how brother Daryl
[17:48] even brought it up the last time he
[17:50] spoke about the little woman with the
[17:51] issue of blood. Now, she needed healing
[17:53] in her body, but that wasn't the worst
[17:55] part that that little lady had to go
[17:56] through. Could you imagine having to
[17:59] live in a society where every time you
[18:01] came up near people, you have to call
[18:03] out unclean,
[18:06] unclean.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; She was a cast out and a reject by
[18:12] society.
[18:13] Can you imagine how that must have felt
[18:15] in that woman's mind?
[18:18] But again, as I said, he exists for the
[18:22] opportunity and he waited until the
[18:24] perfect opportunity to step in that
[18:26] woman's life.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; He knew what his purpose was
[18:33] and it gave him power to fulfill his
[18:37] purpose. The scripture has said, we have
[18:41] been told that there will be a bride
[18:44] without spot or wrinkle. And now I think
[18:46] to myself, now how in the world can it
[18:48] be possible? Because I know me.
[18:52] [snorts]
[18:53] How could he ever see me
[18:56] in such a way? [sighs]
[19:00] You need to understand who you are.
[19:03] We are not just someone who is here to
[19:05] live a life and die and that's the end
[19:08] of us. We are here to fulfill the
[19:10] purpose of God. He is he is longing for
[19:14] a sweetheart.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[19:16] [panting]
[19:19] &gt;&gt; We are the sweetheart of God. He has
[19:22] said
[19:24] there would be a bride and nothing will
[19:26] stop him.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Nothing will stop him. Not your
[19:30] failures, not your weakness. You cannot
[19:34] felt God so bad.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; That he says, "I'm done with you."
[19:39] &gt;&gt; I think about the Apostle Peter was told
[19:43] he was going to deny the Lord.
[19:45] He said, "I'm not going to do it." He He
[19:47] argued with God and said, "No, I won't."
[19:51] &gt;&gt; And then he denies him three times and
[19:53] he the crows and he runs away in
[19:55] shame. He looked like he was done.
[20:01] But then when the Lord Jesus rose
[20:08] and those sisters see him, he said, and
[20:10] his message to him was, "Go tell my
[20:13] disciples."
[20:16] &gt;&gt; And Peter,
[20:18] &gt;&gt; he singled him out. He was letting him
[20:21] know, "You cannot fall so far from me
[20:24] that I will not step back in and redeem
[20:27] you.
[20:30] You cannot be so weak that he's afraid
[20:34] to work in your life.
[20:37] [panting]
[20:39] [snorts]
[20:41] Amen. We are being prepared to become
[20:45] him.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute.
[20:50] Jesus was being prepared
[20:54] all of his life to be led to the cross
[20:58] to be crucified
[21:01] to have his body torn apart. Brother
[21:04] Brandham said God took him to Calvary
[21:06] and tore him apart.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; He sent the body the body goes to the
[21:11] grave. The spirit goes in. He went into
[21:13] hell or he so went into hell. In the
[21:17] spirit he sent back upon the believer.
[21:23] He tore him apart
[21:27] because it was his purpose.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; We're not altogether that different.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; See, we the potter is working on each of
[21:36] our lives tonight.
[21:37] and he's working and he shapes and he
[21:40] shapes and he's molding the clay into
[21:42] this image. He's looking for himself.
[21:45] He's looking to see himself. And as he
[21:48] works on this clay,
[21:51] if he sees something that that just
[21:53] won't cut it, just takes his hands
[21:56] &gt;&gt; and just crushes that clay. And my
[21:58] goodness, it hurts when he crushes the
[22:01] clay
[22:02] and he presses it. and he presses it
[22:06] through these fiery hard trials of life
[22:11] and he sets it up again.
[22:15] It's not quite right. And he takes the
[22:17] clay and he breaks it apart again
[22:21] &gt;&gt; and he presses it and he presses it
[22:27] because he is looking for his image and
[22:30] he will break it apart and remold it as
[22:33] many times as it takes.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[22:37] &gt;&gt; He is not a quitter.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I just said? Our God
[22:44] is [screaming] not a quitter.
[22:46] He started this work and he will
[22:49] complete this work.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; You see, he understands how so many of
[22:56] you feel right now.
[22:59] So broken.
[23:01] You feel forsaken by God.
[23:06] Just like him hanging on the cross
[23:08] crying, "My God, [screaming]
[23:10] my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[23:12] afraid
[23:15] just like me and you.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; He understands where you are right now.
[23:23] [sighs and gasps]
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Take courage to know
[23:27] there ain't nothing wrong with you.
[23:30] It's because you're highly favored and
[23:32] you're being shaped in the in the
[23:34] potter's hands.
[23:37] Amen.
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Pressed into shape time after time after
[23:43] time. [panting and sighs]
[23:45] &gt;&gt; I just wish that I wasn't so stubborn
[23:47] that he had to break me apart so many
[23:50] times.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell on myself.
[23:57] From the time I was a young man,
[24:01] [snorts] I started realizing that I was
[24:03] I was I was a quiet, oddnatured kid. I
[24:05] started realizing though that I had the
[24:07] I had a physical ability. I could do
[24:08] anything that I wanted to do as far as
[24:11] athletics. I was strong. I was fast. I
[24:13] could jump. I could out jump the highest
[24:15] jumper. I was strong. I was as strong as
[24:17] the strongest guy. And over time through
[24:20] life, you you you get to the place where
[24:22] what are you relying on to take care of
[24:24] you? Now, when you're on the job, are
[24:26] you depending on the Lord to provide for
[24:29] you? Or was Pete depending on that
[24:32] strength? I could do the work of five
[24:34] men all day long and never and felt like
[24:36] I never even broke a sweat. I felt like
[24:37] I was just getting tuned up.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; And I relied on it.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; I became self-sufficient.
[24:46] A self-sufficient Christian is
[24:49] worthless.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; He cannot reflect himself through us.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; And he
[24:57] he looked down said, "I got to tear him
[25:00] down. I got to break this boy apart and
[25:04] mold something in him.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not pleased with what I see in him.
[25:10] [panting]
[25:11] &gt;&gt; And little by little,
[25:14] I just started falling apart physically.
[25:17] Shoulders, back, knees, just one thing
[25:19] after another. It was insane the way
[25:22] that it happened. one time after another
[25:24] after another after another
[25:28] [gasps]
[25:29] until I got to the place where I had to
[25:31] realize
[25:34] I need his help every day.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Just to get out of bed and put my socks
[25:39] and shoes on my feet.
[25:43] [gasps]
[25:44] [snorts]
[25:44] &gt;&gt; See, what it build in me is a reliance
[25:47] upon Jesus Christ. I need the Holy
[25:51] Ghost.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie talking about these
[25:53] ministers saying they don't need the
[25:55] Holy Ghost to preach no more. My God,
[25:57] what would I be if I didn't have the
[25:58] Holy Ghost? I have nothing to offer.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; You see, we have got to be shaped into
[26:07] the image that he saw in his mind.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[26:11] [sighs]
[26:12] [gasps]
[26:19] &gt;&gt; Why is he doing it? Why does he do this?
[26:24] Because he wants a family.
[26:28] Not just a family, but a family like
[26:31] him.
[26:33] [panting]
[26:36] [snorts]
[26:37] Verse 29 says that who for whom he did
[26:39] for no we are here he elected us not
[26:43] just to say I'm elect I'm chosen I'm
[26:47] bride
[26:50] but he he whom he did for know he did
[26:53] also predestinate to be conformed to the
[26:57] image of his son that is the reason that
[27:00] he elected his that is the reason why he
[27:03] is working on us
[27:06] not so that We can get puffed up and say
[27:08] we know more than anybody else does. We
[27:11] can explain it all.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; That ain't it, friend.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; A mental knowledge of this word is not
[27:21] enough.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; He wants people of his own genealogy,
[27:29] &gt;&gt; his own seed line with his own spirit
[27:34] living in them. He has our own character
[27:38] that reflects him.
[27:44] Brother Brandham says here in now is set
[27:47] forth the love of God. He desired in
[27:50] love a family of his own, a family of
[27:53] sons, sons like himself.
[27:56] Therefore before him lays all mankind as
[27:59] one lump of clay. Out of the same lump
[28:01] he will now make vessels
[28:03] of honor and under dishonor. The
[28:06] choosing will be his choosing. Then
[28:08] those chosen ones
[28:12] born of his spirit
[28:15] will be trained to conform
[28:19] to the image in their walk.
[28:22] He reproves with all longsuffering
[28:26] with gentleness and mercy. [snorts] He
[28:29] chasens
[28:31] with nail scarred hands.
[28:34] Sometimes this potter must take the
[28:36] vessel that he's working on
[28:41] and thoroughly break it down.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; In order that he may rebuild it exactly
[28:46] as he desires. But it is love.
[28:50] That is his love. Another way of love
[28:54] there is not. There cannot be.
[28:57] See, he desires
[28:59] someone like himself to spend eternity
[29:02] with.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; You ever just feel like I want somebody
[29:07] like me to hang out with, somebody like
[29:09] me to talk to, somebody that gets me?
[29:14] &gt;&gt; He is the same.
[29:18] [snorts]
[29:20] I think about my my son Micah. Me and
[29:23] Micah, he is he is me. He is my D my
[29:28] DNA. He has a nature so similar to me.
[29:32] He thinks like me. Me and Micah don't
[29:35] even have to say words.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; To know exactly what the other is is is
[29:40] talking, what the other wants to say.
[29:41] We'll walk through the house. I I'll
[29:43] make eye contact with him. I'm like,
[29:46] I know exactly what he said. He just
[29:48] spit out a paragraph, you know, and it's
[29:51] and it goes back and forth. Why? Because
[29:54] he's like me.
[29:57] He gets me. There's a communication
[29:59] between us because there because that
[30:01] likeness
[30:03] &gt;&gt; that is unlike a communication with
[30:05] somebody you just have nothing in common
[30:08] with.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; He is looking for his image, brother,
[30:14] sister. and he is going to break the
[30:16] clay and he's going to shape the clay
[30:18] and he's going to mold the clay
[30:24] until he sees his own image.
[30:28] So, you got to remember when we're going
[30:31] through all of this in life, because
[30:34] life's tough, you know, life ain't for
[30:36] sissies. It just ain't. you know, you
[30:39] know, whether it's health, you know,
[30:41] whether it's finances, whether it's
[30:42] family problems, um, whatever it might
[30:45] be,
[30:46] &gt;&gt; life's tough,
[30:49] &gt;&gt; and we're all being shaped,
[30:52] but the the key is being shaped by the
[30:54] master's hand. What potter has got you
[30:56] in his hand, shaping you and making you?
[31:00] Is it the word of the hour that is
[31:02] shaping you? Or is it just you on your
[31:04] own living your own life and life is
[31:06] just molding you into a hard hard
[31:09] person? Because that is what hard life
[31:11] will do. Without the Holy Ghost in your
[31:13] life, it will make you hard.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; Remember that his purpose is an eternal
[31:22] elective purpose.
[31:27] He works with eternal goals in his mind.
[31:31] I'm saying it over and over.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; His love is an elective love.
[31:38] Yeah,
[31:39] &gt;&gt; it is not based on merit
[31:42] &gt;&gt; or how good you are or how pretty you
[31:45] are or how handsome you are
[31:48] &gt;&gt; or how strong you are, what a good
[31:51] speaker you are, what a good businessman
[31:53] you are, how much you love the message.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; That ain't it.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; He did not choose you because you were
[32:01] good. No,
[32:04] &gt;&gt; he did not choose you because, oh well,
[32:06] he knew I'd be a good boy and I would
[32:08] serve him. No, sir. He chose us because
[32:12] he wanted to. He saw us in his mind
[32:17] &gt;&gt; in eternity.
[32:19] And it was love at first sight.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; He saw Jacob before the foundation of
[32:28] the world.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[32:31] [panting]
[32:32] &gt;&gt; As the scripture says, Jacob have I
[32:34] loved and Esau have I have I hated
[32:37] before either one of them boys was even
[32:39] born.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a scoundrel.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; He was a suppler, a deceiver, a cheater.
[32:53] And he knew that and he loved him
[32:56] anyway.
[32:58] See, he has the ability to look at the
[33:01] clay
[33:03] &gt;&gt; and say, "Oh, this that's just dirt
[33:06] right now, but I know what I can make
[33:08] out of this.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, that when I'm done, that mud, that
[33:15] clay will look just like me."
[33:19] [sighs]
[33:20] [panting]
[33:21] &gt;&gt; And when he was done with suppl, he was
[33:24] now a prince with God. Yeah.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; After the river, he walked a little bit
[33:30] different for the rest of his life.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Because of the the elective love of God
[33:39] did not choose him based upon his
[33:41] marriage.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; He loved him because he loved him. And
[33:45] he saw
[33:47] he also saw in his mind an image of her
[33:52] his elect lady
[33:55] when he has existed alone by himself as
[33:58] the self-existing one. He saw her. He
[34:02] literally saw her
[34:04] [panting]
[34:06] &gt;&gt; when there was nothing but him. There
[34:09] were no angels. There was no Lucifer.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[34:14] &gt;&gt; There was nothing but God.
[34:17] [panting]
[34:20] And he saw us. [snorts] He knew us then
[34:25] as attributes, as thoughts.
[34:30] He literally saw each of his elect.
[34:38] And he took a picture of that in his
[34:40] mind. And he ain't going to stop. until
[34:44] that picture is perfected in our life.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:50] [panting]
[34:51] He elected us to be his bride and he
[34:54] will prepare us to be his bride.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; I'm dumping grace on heavy tonight. We
[35:02] need it.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; You will not make it because you think
[35:07] you live so good or that you are so
[35:10] holy.
[35:13] We need the grace of God.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] [panting and gasps]
[35:18] [snorts]
[35:18] &gt;&gt; He has purposed in his heart. There
[35:21] ain't nothing going to stop him.
[35:23] Absolutely nothing's going to stop him
[35:27] [gasps]
[35:28] until he sees his bride without spot or
[35:31] wrinkle
[35:32] standing by his side.
[35:35] [panting]
[35:36] [sighs and gasps]
[35:38] Made just like himself in character,
[35:42] [panting]
[35:44] fit to judge
[35:47] and fit to reign.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; So he shapes us now in life. Yeah.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; With trial after trial and test after
[35:59] test, time after time, if he has to, he
[36:03] will break our hearts if that's what it
[36:05] takes. He will take that thing from you
[36:08] that you love so much.
[36:12] And you wonder why.
[36:15] Why would a loving God do something like
[36:17] that? I wanted so many times about my
[36:21] brother James
[36:23] just a few years ago. The Lord let me
[36:24] see. He let me see. He had to take my
[36:28] brother while he was right. 5 days
[36:31] before the boy died, six days before he
[36:34] died, he almost died of alcohol
[36:36] poisoning. The next day, he turned his
[36:39] life back to Jesus Christ.
[36:43] You see, he knows what he's doing.
[36:48] Stop wondering why and just trust him.
[36:52] He knows,
[36:53] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[36:54] &gt;&gt; how to shape your life. He knows what to
[36:57] remove and what to add.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:06] He literally saw her
[37:09] in his sight. He saw her as justified
[37:15] in his sight while he was in eternity.
[37:20] The scripture says that whom he called
[37:22] them, he also justified and whom he
[37:25] justified, he also glorified. Now, none
[37:29] of us were here on this earth at that
[37:31] time, but he saw that picture,
[37:35] &gt;&gt; and that is what he's working for.
[37:39] [panting and sighs]
[37:41] He's looking for a queen.
[37:44] [panting]
[37:46] Not pretend.
[37:48] He didn't pretend. This isn't a story.
[37:52] [snorts]
[37:52] &gt;&gt; He saw her,
[37:54] [sighs and panting]
[37:55] &gt;&gt; not in type. He saw his bride.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; He saw her as justified.
[38:05] He saw us as glorified, standing by his
[38:08] side
[38:10] and he will work out exactly what he saw
[38:14] in his mind,
[38:16] exactly as he saw us then. He will shape
[38:20] us the same.
[38:23] [sighs and gasps]
[38:25] [panting]
[38:26] It's no wonder Paul said, "Who can lay
[38:28] anything to the charge of God's elect?"
[38:31] It is God that justifith.
[38:34] Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ
[38:37] yay that died rather and is rais risen
[38:39] again. Who is anybody even at the right
[38:41] hand of God who and who maketh
[38:43] intercession for us?
[38:46] He is our judge jury.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; The attorney attorney
[38:53] when he saw us there was no prosecutor
[38:55] in existence. friend.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; You understand that the accuser of the
[39:01] brethren was not there to accuse us
[39:03] before him.
[39:07] In his mind, he tried his little bride.
[39:13] He saw Christ as our intercessor. He saw
[39:16] us washed in the blood.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; He saw us as redeemed,
[39:22] not just pardoned.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; See, pardon means I'm guilty, but I was
[39:30] forgiven.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; See, he took us a little further than
[39:34] that.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; See, it's not a reworking of our old
[39:38] man.
[39:40] He's [snorts] not trying to reform us
[39:43] like an AA meeting where you go and
[39:46] you're tall principles to apply to your
[39:48] life to keep you from falling back to
[39:50] the bottle.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[39:53] &gt;&gt; This is not a reformation gospel. It is
[39:56] a transformation gospel.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw me. He saw you as not
[40:04] guilty in his sight. [sighs]
[40:07] [panting]
[40:09] &gt;&gt; As it was as though brother Brandham
[40:11] said that we never even did it in the
[40:15] first place.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:18] In the rapture message, he said, "Now
[40:20] notice, not only is the bride washed,
[40:22] forgiven, but she's justified."
[40:27] See, did you ever try the word justified
[40:29] to see what it means? Now, for exist,
[40:32] for instance, if Brother Green heard
[40:34] that I'd been drinking, I'd been doing
[40:36] bad things, then he found out I didn't
[40:38] do it, then he comes to me. He says,
[40:41] "Brother Brandon, well, I forgive you."
[40:43] Well, Brother Brham says, "You forgive
[40:44] me.
[40:46] I never done it.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; What are you forgiving me about?
[40:55] &gt;&gt; You see, but if I'm guilty,
[40:58] then I can be forgiven,
[41:01] but I'm still not just.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Think about that. If all we are is
[41:07] forgiven, we are not just in his sight
[41:10] because we we were guilty of these of
[41:13] this of this sin.
[41:17] We were found guilty if that's the case.
[41:21] See, it is not a reworking of our old
[41:25] man. It is a new creation by the spirit.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; You see, a deposit was placed in each
[41:32] and every one of us that are rel.
[41:36] [panting]
[41:40] Now, that seed is perfect, but it's in a
[41:43] dormant state.
[41:47] through the work of the Holy Ghost, the
[41:49] old man, he dies.
[41:52] That old nature dies.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; And that seed of God that never one time
[42:01] sinned comes to life
[42:06] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. That is how
[42:08] [screaming]
[42:09] he sees us as justified in his sight.
[42:12] [panting]
[42:14] That is why nothing can stop him from
[42:16] bringing his word to pass in our life.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; We are not pretending. We are not
[42:22] guilty.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It ain't no wonder Paul,
[42:32] it's wearing me out. It ain't no wonder
[42:35] Paul said, "Who can separate me
[42:39] &gt;&gt; from the love of Christ?
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Shall tribulation,
[42:44] distress,
[42:45] persecution,
[42:47] famine, nakedness, peril, or sword?"
[42:52] I'm here to tell you tonight, brother,
[42:54] sister, if you don't already know it,
[42:56] there is no trial that can separate us
[42:59] from the elect love of God.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:03] There is no persecution that you could
[43:06] ever go through that could separate you
[43:09] from the love of God.
[43:12] I think about the Hebrew children and
[43:14] how that that there was a king [snorts]
[43:17] who purposed in his heart that he was
[43:19] going to destroy them.
[43:22] Brother Brham said God purposed in his
[43:24] heart that he was going to show that
[43:26] king who God was. Amen.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; And the king heated the fire seven times
[43:34] harder than it had ever been heated
[43:36] before. The hottest stri that they had
[43:39] ever seen.
[43:42] [panting]
[43:43] &gt;&gt; See, he did not take the fire away. He
[43:46] let him heat it up.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Turn up the fire.
[43:52] [panting]
[43:53] That's how much confidence he has in
[43:56] himself. That's how much confidence he
[43:59] has in his his election.
[44:03] He didn't take the fire away,
[44:06] but he became the fourth man in the
[44:08] fire.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; See, he purposed to show himself that he
[44:12] was a deliverer.
[44:15] [sighs and gasps]
[44:16] &gt;&gt; And no fire can ever defeat the purpose
[44:20] of almighty God.
[44:23] There is no demonic power that can hold
[44:26] me or hold you.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; There is no fear.
[44:33] [panting]
[44:36] There is no fear of losing those that
[44:39] you love
[44:41] so great
[44:43] that he will allow it to shake you
[44:46] [panting and gasps]
[44:46] from his purpose. For many years, I
[44:49] lived with that over my head, afraid to
[44:52] get close to anybody because everybody
[44:55] it seemed like that I got close to died.
[44:57] My brother James, my cousin Eric, cousin
[44:59] Billy, my buddy Jackie, just one after
[45:02] the other.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And I lived in fear.
[45:07] I didn't make friends. So many of you, I
[45:10] love you all to death, but I've always I
[45:11] would always just pull away and just
[45:13] stay there stay at distance because I
[45:15] was afraid that if I got close
[45:18] that some for some reason he would take
[45:20] he would take it from me.
[45:23] [gasps]
[45:24] That is not of God
[45:27] for his children to live in fear.
[45:31] [panting]
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Fear of missing the rapture. Fear of
[45:34] losing my family. fear of not being a
[45:38] being worthy.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; There is no depression that can hold the
[45:43] people of God.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; There is no spirit of oppression that
[45:48] can hold us down.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; He said the Lord
[45:55] will be a refuge for the oppressed. He
[45:58] has a place that we can run to and
[46:01] surrender
[46:03] &gt;&gt; and let him build us back up
[46:06] into confidence in him and to trust.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Not just trust in him, but [snorts]
[46:14] trust in his people.
[46:17] [panting]
[46:18] I appreciate I'm going to say because
[46:20] he's not here, but I appreciate brother
[46:22] Donnie um because he's helped me a lot.
[46:26] Um,
[46:28] I've had that issue where I just didn't
[46:29] trust people. I'm always just looking.
[46:31] Always was watching.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; You know, there's there's a there's a
[46:35] twist coming, you know, no matter what
[46:37] people are telling you, there's going to
[46:38] be a twist coming. They don't really
[46:40] always mean what they say.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; But I but and I pushed his buttons. I'm
[46:45] going to be honest with you, Sister
[46:46] Carol. I'm sorry, but I did. At times, I
[46:49] pushed his buttons just to see. and he's
[46:51] been so patient time after time to help
[46:55] me um to encourage me.
[46:59] Um
[47:01] and it's helped me to get to the place
[47:03] where now
[47:05] where you start you're trusting not just
[47:07] God but you're trusting his people
[47:08] because you see I see Jesus in David
[47:11] Swanson and I know I can trust him.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; We're all human.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; We all got faults and problems.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:21] But don't just look at that, brother
[47:23] sister. Can you see Jesus?
[47:27] &gt;&gt; It is not of God for his children to be
[47:29] oppressed.
[47:32] There is no darkness that that could
[47:34] ever hold us down from the purpose of
[47:36] God being fulfilled in our life.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I like the way David said it. He said,
[47:40] "Where can I go from your spirit?
[47:44] Where can I go to get away from his
[47:47] presence? If I ascend so high that I go
[47:51] up into heaven,
[47:53] he's there.
[47:56] And if I make my bed in hell, he's right
[48:00] there with me.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; If I take the wings of the morning
[48:05] and dwell in the uttermost parts of the
[48:07] sea, even there
[48:10] thy right hand shall lead me.
[48:13] and thy right hand shall hold me.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; There is nothing that can stop his
[48:19] purpose from being fulfilled in our
[48:21] life. Not even death itself can stop us.
[48:25] If he's by if it is by his
[48:28] some reason it is his purpose to take us
[48:31] then death is just going to escort us
[48:33] across the river.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; We win either way.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; I got one last question then I'm going
[48:40] to close. Mercy. I'm sorry.
[48:44] Why did he send William Brandham,
[48:48] &gt;&gt; brother William Brandham with a message
[48:49] in this last days? What was the reason
[48:52] behind it?
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; it was to turn our hearts, the the
[48:57] hearts of the elect back to the faith of
[49:00] the fathers.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; He sent him with a purpose to go and get
[49:04] a bride for me. And not just go get a
[49:06] bride, but to get her ready. You see, he
[49:10] said, brother Brandon went so far as far
[49:11] as to say, he said the heart purpose,
[49:13] the eternal purpose of God was to take a
[49:16] bride of his own choosing.
[49:19] That's why
[49:22] he sent brother William Brandham in the
[49:25] last days. Not just to be prepared to
[49:28] meet him,
[49:31] cleaned up, new clothes on, mature.
[49:36] Not just to meet him,
[49:39] but to reign with him,
[49:42] &gt;&gt; to judge with him,
[49:46] to prepare a bride with character so
[49:49] much like his own that when he looks at
[49:52] her,
[49:53] she's just like me.
[49:56] [snorts] She's just like me. Now I have
[49:59] someone that I can talk to.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That gets me.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Someone that thinks the way that I
[50:06] think.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Someone who feels like I feel.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Someone who loves like I love
[50:15] and they hate what I hate.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Musicians come. You see a man, a man and
[50:24] a wife and his wife. You can only have
[50:27] that real deep relationship
[50:31] with somebody that you just got that
[50:34] that connection with.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; I think about me and Bambi. I wanted a
[50:39] wife that that I could talk to more than
[50:42] anything in this world. That was my
[50:44] number one thing. I wanted somebody that
[50:46] I could talk to
[50:48] &gt;&gt; and and have a conversation with and
[50:50] someone with character that now I didn't
[50:52] have to worry about her judgment. You
[50:54] know, cuz if if your if you if
[50:55] everything matches, if say your your
[50:57] ethics are the same and and your your
[51:00] all your beliefs are the same, but the
[51:01] character ain't right.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; You know,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; she she's saying words she shouldn't say
[51:06] and she dresses like she shouldn't dress
[51:09] or um it's just it's hard. You couldn't
[51:13] have that fullness of relationship.
[51:16] But I chose a woman that I saw character
[51:20] in, that I saw Jesus Christ in. I chose
[51:24] a lady
[51:27] who shared my same views and beliefs. I
[51:31] um um the same principles in life that I
[51:35] live by.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; You see, he also desires a woman like
[51:38] that.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Same as him in genealogy.
[51:46] same as him in spirit and character.
[51:50] She forgives the way that he forgives.
[51:53] She's patient like he's patient.
[52:00] Someone that he trusts to judge things
[52:04] like he jud he he he the way that he
[52:06] judges.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; He knows she'll that her her decision
[52:11] will be just like his.
[52:15] See, he desires someone, if you would
[52:17] just stand with me, he desires someone
[52:20] like himself to spend eternity with.
[52:23] That's why
[52:25] we walk through the fire
[52:30] and [snorts] all these trials of life.
[52:33] He wants someone like himself to spend
[52:36] eternity with. Think about that. What?
[52:40] What? How would it be to spend eternity
[52:42] with somebody you ain't got nothing in
[52:44] common with? That sounds like hell. To
[52:48] be honest with you, it does. Which which
[52:51] tells you why he's working on us the way
[52:53] that he's working on us. You see, he is
[52:55] desiring.
[52:58] He is desiring a a a lady, an elect lady
[53:02] who is his equal in in in in in in
[53:07] judgment that will that will be by his
[53:09] side. Yes, I said equal.
[53:13] In Philippians chapter 5, it says, "Let
[53:16] this mind be in you which was also in
[53:20] Christ Jesus,
[53:22] who being in the form of God,
[53:25] thought in not robbery to be equal with
[53:28] God." Yeah.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; This elect lady that has been shaped,
[53:34] [sighs]
[53:36] born of his spirit,
[53:38] same character as him,
[53:42] molded by him, shaped by his own
[53:45] [screaming] hand into perfection.
[53:49] [sighs]
[53:50] She is him.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; [panting]
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Harry, would you sing something
[53:58] for me while I catch my breath?
[54:06] [applause]
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Don't get discouraged, little bride.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; He's just doing it
[54:17] because he loves you with all of his
[54:19] heart.
[54:21] Amen.
[54:23] Amen. So many times I've questioned
[54:27] certain circumstances,
[54:31] things I [singing] could not understand.
[54:39] Many times in trials, [music]
[54:42] weakness blur [singing] my vision
[54:46] and my frustration gets so out of
[54:50] [singing] hand.
[54:53] But it's then I [music] am reminded
[54:57] I've never been forsaken.
[55:00] Amen.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; I've never had stand one [music] test
[55:05] alone.
[55:08] As I [singing] look at all the
[55:10] victories,
[55:12] the spirit risees [singing]
[55:14] up [music] in me. And through the fire,
[55:18] my weakness is made strong.
[55:24] He [music] never promised [singing]
[55:27] that the cross would not be heavy.
[55:31] [music and singing] He would not be hard
[55:34] to climb.
[55:39] He never [music and singing]
[55:40] offered
[55:42] victories without fighting. But he said
[55:45] [singing] help would always come [music]
[55:48] in time.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Just remember when you're standing
[55:56] in the valley of [music and singing]
[55:58] decision
[56:00] and the adversary says give [singing]
[56:04] in. [music]
[56:05] Just hold on.
[56:10] [music] Our Lord will show up
[56:13] and he will take you through the fire
[56:17] again. [singing]
[56:18] [music]
[56:22] He never [singing]
[56:23] promised that the cross would not be
[56:27] [music] heavy,
[56:28] that the hill would not [singing] be
[56:31] hard to climb. [music]
[56:36] He never [singing] offered
[56:40] victories [music]
[56:40] without fighting. But he said help would
[56:44] always come in time.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Just [music] remember when you're
[56:52] standing
[56:53] in the valley of decision
[56:57] and [music] the adversary says give in.
[57:03] Just [music] hold on. [singing]
[57:07] Our Lord will show up
[57:11] and he will [music] take you through the
[57:14] fire again. [singing]
[57:19] I know [music and singing] within myself
[57:22] that I will surely perish. [singing]
[57:26] But if [music] I trust the hand of God,
[57:29] he'll shield the flames again.
[57:35] Again, [music and singing]
[57:39] he never promised [music] that the cross
[57:42] would not be heavy. [singing]
[57:45] Your heel would not be hard to climb.
[57:53] He [music] never offered
[57:56] victories without fighting. But he said
[57:59] help would always [music] come in time.
[58:06] Just [music] remember when [singing]
[58:07] you're standing
[58:09] in the valley of [music] decision
[58:13] and the adversary says keep in [music]
[58:19] just hold on. [singing]
[58:23] Our Lord [music] will show up
[58:26] and he will take you through
[58:30] again. [singing]
[58:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] I just Amen. Praise the
[58:41] Lord.
[58:43] Praise the Lord.
[58:45] Amen. Amen. He's worthy of it, friends.
[58:49] I just want to say this cuz I don't feel
[58:51] like I close it out quite just right.
[58:54] Um, he sends us through the fire, but I
[58:59] I also want to say this. We go through
[59:01] things in life, but if your load is
[59:03] getting too heavy that you can't take
[59:05] it, he is still a loadbearer.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still a loadbearer. He's able
[59:13] to give you some strength, to give you a
[59:15] leg up, to give you a boost. And and if
[59:17] the enemy has put something on you, he's
[59:20] able to take it off of you. Brother
[59:21] Sister, he has not changed. Just because
[59:25] we're walking through this, it does not
[59:28] change who he is. He is still a chain
[59:31] breaker. He is still right now a healer.
[59:35] He is still right now a deliverer.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And he's able to help you. Whatever
[59:40] you're going through, if it is too much
[59:43] for you to carry, give it to Jesus
[59:46] tonight.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Do not walk out of here too heavy under
[59:51] your load.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [applause]
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Enjoy. Brother Pete Lawson
[1:00:11] tonight.
[1:00:13] [applause]
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:17] Amen. Brother Pete, God bless you. I
[1:00:19] believe that was just in time
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; for all of us. He'll take us through the
[1:00:24] fire.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't promise you a bed of roses. He
[1:00:27] didn't promise none of us a flowery bed
[1:00:29] of roses, but he did say he'd be there
[1:00:31] for us.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that with all
[1:00:33] your heart?
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; The children of Israel,
[1:00:37] they wake went through a Red Sea. Can
[1:00:39] you imagine walking through that Red
[1:00:41] Sea? But they had a word from the Lord.
[1:00:43] That's right.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; I'll get you to the other side.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; The three Hebrew children in the fiery
[1:00:49] furnace. Can you imagine going into a
[1:00:50] fiery furnace, but somebody got in there
[1:00:53] with him and walked around? He'll walk
[1:00:55] around with you. Do you believe that
[1:00:57] tonight? Let's sing just a little bit
[1:00:58] more of that, Brother Harry, as we get
[1:01:00] ready to leave. It's been good to be in
[1:01:02] the house of God. I know that.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Let's come back Sunday morning looking
[1:01:05] for what the Lord will have for us. It's
[1:01:07] going to be something good. Do you
[1:01:09] believe that?
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Through the fire. Let's sing a little
[1:01:11] bit more of it.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; So many times I've questioned. Praise
[1:01:17] the Lord. certain [music] circumstances,
[1:01:19] [singing]
[1:01:21] pains I could not understand.
[1:01:29] [music] Many times in trials,
[1:01:32] the weakness bl
[1:01:37] [music]
[1:01:39] out of hand.
[1:01:42] [music]
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Well, listen, then I am reminded.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I've never been [music]
[1:01:48] forsaken.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Never been forsaken.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; I've never had to stand one test [music]
[1:01:54] alone.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Not a one of them.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; As I look at [singing] all the victories
[1:02:01] the [music] spirit rises up in me. And
[1:02:04] it's through the fire my weakness
[1:02:06] [music]
[1:02:07] is made. Oh, sing it out to him, church.
[1:02:12] He never promised that the [music] cross
[1:02:16] would not be heavy.
[1:02:18] The hill would not be hard to climb.
[1:02:25] [music]
[1:02:26] He never offered
[1:02:29] victories without body. He said, "Help
[1:02:33] would always come."
[1:02:39] Just remember when you're [music]
[1:02:42] standing in a valley [singing] of
[1:02:45] decision
[1:02:47] and the [music] adversary is giving.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Just hold [music] on.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Hold on. Our Lord will show up
[1:03:00] and [music] he will take you through the
[1:03:03] fire again. God bless [music] you. You
[1:03:06] need to leave. You're dismissed. I know
[1:03:10] within [music] myself that I will surely
[1:03:13] perish.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, we would.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; If I trust [music] the hand of God,
[1:03:18] he'll shield the flames [singing]
[1:03:20] again.
[1:03:23] [music] Again.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Again.
[1:03:28] He never [singing]
[1:03:29] promised that the cross would not be
[1:03:34] the hill would not be hard to [singing]
[1:03:38] climb.
[1:03:42] He never offered
[1:03:45] victories [music] without
