[48:20] we be if it wasn't for the Lord and our
[48:22] hearts and lives I said it to you many
[48:25] times I'll probably keep on saying it as
[48:27] long as you'll let me preach to you I
[48:29] don't see how people live without him I
[48:31] don't see how that I know they do I know
[48:33] they do and they think that they've got
[48:35] this great fine wonderful life but I'm
[48:38] so glad I can't even walk without him
[48:41] holding my hand I wouldn't want to live
[48:44] one day without him
[48:46] God bless you let's turn to the Book of
[48:47] Revelation tonight chapter 18 verse 17.
[48:52] and I was supposed to be in Kansas this
[48:55] week supposed to last Monday
[48:57] uh to go hunting but with all the work
[49:01] there is to be done over the church I
[49:03] thought it'd be more beneficial for me
[49:04] to stick around here and do what little
[49:07] bit I can do but brother Andrew Glover
[49:10] was scheduled to be here on Sunday so I
[49:13] thought we'd just let him come on back
[49:14] and be with us anyway so you'll get to
[49:16] hear a good picture on Sunday
[49:19] and a young one too at that
[49:22] God bless you let's read together
[49:23] Revelation 18 17.
[49:28] for in one hour
[49:29] so great riches has come to naught
[49:33] and every shipmaster
[49:35] and all the company and ships and
[49:38] sailors and as many as traded by sea
[49:43] stood afar off
[49:44] and cried when they saw the smoke
[49:48] of her burning
[49:50] saying what city
[49:52] is like unto this great City
[49:55] and they cast dust on their heads and
[49:58] cried weeping and wailing saying alas
[50:03] I sent this now what they say alas alas
[50:07] that great City we're in we were made
[50:11] rich
[50:12] and all that had ships in the sea by
[50:15] reason of her costliness now listen how
[50:19] much of this is tied to her I'm
[50:21] convinced we don't know how much she
[50:24] does
[50:25] for in one hour is she made desolate
[50:30] Rejoice over her wow
[50:34] so some people are crying some are
[50:37] lamenting some are wailing some are just
[50:40] saying alas alas what are we going to do
[50:43] oh what are we going to do but look in
[50:46] verse 20 Rejoice over her
[50:50] thou heaven
[50:52] and you Holy Apostles
[50:55] so we got people on the Earth that's act
[50:58] in one way
[50:59] and we've got people in heaven
[51:01] that's acting another way
[51:04] I guess the question is tonight
[51:06] which are we going to be
[51:08] now once again it proves to us that the
[51:12] people of the earth that are
[51:13] carnal-minded
[51:14] so miss how God thinks about certain
[51:18] things how could one thing that would
[51:21] make people wail and a man can cry and
[51:24] then other people are rejoicing
[51:27] and again it proves to us that when God
[51:30] wants it to be so
[51:32] that he enlightens people in heaven to
[51:36] things that are happening on the Earth
[51:38] I'm sure he doesn't to all sorts of
[51:41] things that we go through but I want you
[51:42] to notice this Rejoice over her thou
[51:44] heaven and you Holy Apostles and
[51:49] Prophets for God hath Avenged you
[51:54] on her
[51:56] so they are to Rejoice because God is
[52:01] getting back at him
[52:04] and God is getting evil with this city
[52:08] This Woman This power that Ruled the
[52:12] Earth may the Lord bless his words you
[52:13] may be seated
[52:16] now for the most part it's hard for us
[52:19] humans
[52:20] whenever we think about revenge or
[52:24] avenge being a vengeful spirit and we
[52:27] know that the word forbids us from being
[52:31] revengeful the word forbids us for
[52:35] wanting to have an attitude to where so
[52:38] and so do something to us we're going to
[52:40] get back at him and if it's the last
[52:42] thing I do I'll take it one thing I'll
[52:45] get back at him well you know the Lord
[52:47] does not want us to have that attitude
[52:49] but yet God can have that attitude and
[52:54] when he does it is so pure and so holy
[52:59] that God considers it to be righteous
[53:03] now for us when we look at it why
[53:07] because the difference is in his being
[53:10] God and us being merely humans that are
[53:13] still contaminated with the things about
[53:16] us that want to get even with people in
[53:18] the wrong attitude but yet notice what a
[53:22] strange thing that this is so this is of
[53:25] course during the time of the
[53:26] tribulation period very very close to
[53:28] the end of it and the heavens are so in
[53:32] tune with what's going on the earth that
[53:35] God actually lets a voice come out of
[53:38] heaven and Heaven is told to Rejoice
[53:42] because explosions Annihilation
[53:45] destruction this city has been destroyed
[53:49] in one hour by an atomic bomb people
[53:52] have lost their wealth they have lost
[53:55] nearly everything that they would own
[53:58] and Heaven is supposed to Rejoice over
[54:02] such a thing how can that be isn't that
[54:06] the wrong Spirit no actually it's not
[54:09] the wrong Spirit but now for most of us
[54:12] if someone would do something bad
[54:14] against us and we would hear that they
[54:17] had a car wreck or say I knew it I knew
[54:20] it they shouldn't have never thought
[54:22] that about me they shouldn't have never
[54:25] said that about me but isn't it amazing
[54:28] though if we have a car wreck the next
[54:30] day that Old Devil I'll tell you what he
[54:33] nearly killed me it died old Devil's
[54:36] after me well how do you know which one
[54:38] was the devil that caused them to have
[54:40] the one and the other God calls them
[54:44] so you see there's still something about
[54:46] our Humanity that is not yet attained to
[54:49] that purity of being able to Revenge the
[54:53] way God can now I'm sure there's nobody
[54:55] here like that tonight but there's some
[54:57] pretty low down people that stream these
[55:00] services so I'm sure that somebody
[55:02] needed to hear this tonight so you
[55:04] goodly Little Darlings you just sat here
[55:06] and and pray for me what I have to
[55:09] deliver this to them sorry outfits that
[55:11] stream in this service and maybe I'll be
[55:14] able to get to the Angelic choir and
[55:17] something that you Little Darlings can
[55:19] Rejoice with
[55:21] ah
[55:23] you know it's amazing because heaven I
[55:27] can't say that I understand how and when
[55:31] the transition is made but as we come to
[55:35] the close of the end time here before
[55:38] going into the Millennium the heavens
[55:42] are commanded by God to start rejoicing
[55:47] and it it synced up with things that are
[55:51] happening on the earth now I believe
[55:54] that heaven is is absolutely in tune to
[55:58] things that are going on on the earth as
[56:01] a matter of fact the prophet tells us
[56:03] that whenever
[56:04] we get ready to leave this world that
[56:07] God will send one of our loved ones down
[56:11] to the river and they will be waiting
[56:14] for us now how do they know that they're
[56:17] in the sixth Dimension God's in the
[56:19] seventh Dimension but they're still
[56:22] communication that goes between the six
[56:25] and the seventh Dimension and the person
[56:28] living here on the earth contacting the
[56:31] Earthly home and yet the father knows
[56:33] they're fixing to cross over so what
[56:35] does he do he sends a message to someone
[56:38] a loved one in the sixth Dimension and
[56:41] they come down from the sixth Dimension
[56:43] wherever they are to where they
[56:45] themselves crossed over at the River
[56:47] Jordan and there they are waiting for
[56:50] that son that daughter that brother that
[56:53] sister whoever it was by a command from
[56:56] God and they are there to welcome them
[56:59] on the other side now I Know that heaven
[57:02] communicates and those use the things
[57:05] that are on the earth the angel of
[57:08] Revelation 18 1 whenever he sound his
[57:11] message of come out of her my people
[57:13] then the voice from heaven in verse 4
[57:16] echoed and begin to say the same thing
[57:19] from heaven so we know that God is
[57:23] absolutely synchronized with what is
[57:25] happening on the Earth but I'm sure
[57:28] Heaven would not be Heaven if they were
[57:31] aware of all the anxiety and all the
[57:34] trouble how in the world could they
[57:35] enjoy being there in this type of body
[57:38] of theophany if they knew we were still
[57:40] here and we were sick and we were
[57:43] suffering and we were going through all
[57:45] kinds of different things so no doubt
[57:47] the Lord only allows certain things to
[57:51] be conveyed to them and you know brother
[57:53] Brandon would mention it many times I
[57:55] heard it not long ago and there was a
[57:57] man that come up in a prayer line and he
[58:00] had a he had a need in his body but yet
[58:02] the man was not saved and the prophet
[58:05] told him he said your mother has gone on
[58:07] before you and she prayed many prayers
[58:11] for you and tonight they're being
[58:14] answered now God brother M didn't even
[58:17] know the woman but God knew the prayers
[58:20] of this woman and her son had come up
[58:23] for a need and God was answering the
[58:27] Prayer of Salvation now we know that
[58:29] according to the Book of Revelation that
[58:31] the prayers of the Saints are stored up
[58:34] I'm so glad of that they are stored up
[58:36] now you may think God didn't hear you
[58:38] well if there may be a prayer of a
[58:40] mother that had prayed for a son or a
[58:43] daughter that prayer may be stored in a
[58:46] vases which say in heaven for 20 years
[58:49] 25 years 40 years 45 years who knows how
[58:53] long it'll be but God will hear and
[58:56] remember and honor that prayer now here
[58:59] stands this man on the earth and the
[59:02] prophet tells him of the prayer how did
[59:04] he know goes out how did he hear that
[59:06] well that prayer was kept in heaven and
[59:10] God communicated by Vision the prayer
[59:13] that had been stored up and revealing it
[59:15] to the prophet as he's standing on the
[59:17] earth in the realm of the fourth
[59:19] dimension as he's seeing this Vision so
[59:22] it will be something similar to that as
[59:24] we see the end time events now Heaven is
[59:27] so close to being birthed upon the earth
[59:30] now we know that when the bride takes it
[59:33] takes her flight and leaves out of here
[59:34] then there'll be no more blood on the
[59:37] mercy seat for the church ages they will
[59:39] be totally done we know that 144 000
[59:42] will be called by the overlapping mercy
[59:45] of God that's been given under the
[59:47] dispensation of Esther and the bride and
[59:49] ruse and the bride and God be dealing
[59:52] with sin and sealing twelve thousand out
[59:55] of each tribe but remember it will be
[59:57] such a short span of time as far as
[1:00:00] Heavenly time is concerned it'll only be
[1:00:03] three and a half years the that'll be
[1:00:04] less than that to God so it will be so
[1:00:07] fast that the events on the earth will
[1:00:10] be so in tune with what is happening in
[1:00:13] the heavens that several times during
[1:00:16] the events that happen the heavens are
[1:00:18] told to Rejoice now I'm sure that even
[1:00:21] those of us that are enlightened by the
[1:00:24] end time message still do not see
[1:00:26] properly how God views this system which
[1:00:30] he has spoken so against down through
[1:00:33] the church ages now remember it's not
[1:00:35] always necessary to the people that are
[1:00:38] called inside of there because the voice
[1:00:40] of God said come out of her my people so
[1:00:43] it shows everybody in there was not part
[1:00:46] of their system by Nature they were
[1:00:48] simply called as it would be an eagle in
[1:00:51] a cage but they heard the voice of God
[1:00:53] and they came out of them so keep in
[1:00:56] mind when you say well this person's a
[1:00:58] Baptist this is the Catholic this one
[1:00:59] this and the other well they may be that
[1:01:02] as of tonight but you have no clue what
[1:01:04] they'll be this time tomorrow so the
[1:01:07] spirit of God can be able to reach in
[1:01:08] there and get them just like he did many
[1:01:10] of us now once you notice three times
[1:01:14] Heaven is actually told to rejoice and
[1:01:17] the first time in the Book of Revelation
[1:01:19] is actually Revelation 12 12. and that
[1:01:22] is when Satan is cast down and the
[1:01:25] second time is in Revelation 18 20
[1:01:28] whenever Babylon which is what we just
[1:01:31] read is going to be destroyed and then
[1:01:34] the third time is when the marriage of
[1:01:37] the Lamb is declared which is revelation
[1:01:39] 19 7. and the men of the earth never
[1:01:43] have the same point of view as Heaven
[1:01:46] does you know how blessed you are
[1:01:47] tonight if you see things the way that
[1:01:51] God sees them you ought to be one happy
[1:01:53] individual because most of Humanity on
[1:01:57] the earth just the other day I read and
[1:01:59] I saw a picture of the eight billions
[1:02:01] baby that was born on the Earth imagine
[1:02:04] the Earth's population has reached 8
[1:02:07] billion and they had a picture of this
[1:02:09] little baby and it had on its little you
[1:02:11] know its little outfit and it had eight
[1:02:13] billions written on there eight billion
[1:02:16] people on the face of their wonder how
[1:02:18] many out of 8 billion no one little
[1:02:22] thing about the real truth of the end
[1:02:24] time message now a lot of them believe
[1:02:26] in a god a lot of them believe in many
[1:02:29] gods many of them are polytheistic some
[1:02:31] of them are monotheistic some of them
[1:02:33] trinitarians some of them all types of
[1:02:35] denomination but I wonder how many of
[1:02:38] them really really know the god of the
[1:02:41] Bible that is the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:02:43] said he's the same yesterday today and
[1:02:46] forever so here we set tonight not
[1:02:48] because they're any better not because
[1:02:50] we deserve it not because there's
[1:02:53] something great and wonderful about our
[1:02:55] family or our personality but it's
[1:02:58] simply one thing God chose you before
[1:03:00] the foundation of the world that he
[1:03:02] might be able to share his personal
[1:03:04] truth with you you're one blessed person
[1:03:07] tonight
[1:03:08] so whenever the people on the Earth for
[1:03:11] the most part they will always be out of
[1:03:15] synchronization with God just like it
[1:03:17] was in the days of Noah one man catches
[1:03:19] the message from God almost everybody
[1:03:22] else on the face of the Earth was
[1:03:25] absolutely totally wrong it's been that
[1:03:28] same scenario over and over again and
[1:03:32] yet here we said tonight by the grace of
[1:03:34] God and we are synchronized so in tune
[1:03:37] with Heaven that one day we will feel a
[1:03:41] sudden change that will surge through
[1:03:44] our bodies we won't get a text we won't
[1:03:46] get a what's that it won't be on
[1:03:48] Instagram it'll be suffice Instagram
[1:03:50] will never be able to catch it it'll
[1:03:53] never be on social media but you will be
[1:03:55] so in tune with God by your new birth
[1:03:58] that all of a sudden your sales will
[1:04:00] start obeying that Great Mighty voice of
[1:04:03] God and your tissues and your muscles
[1:04:06] and your bones and all of us sudden the
[1:04:09] blood will dissipate out of your body
[1:04:10] because flesh and blood does not inherit
[1:04:13] the kingdom of God and your gray hairs
[1:04:15] will go out if you ain't got no hair
[1:04:16] they'll come back and if you've got
[1:04:18] false teeth well guess what you're going
[1:04:20] to get brand new ones and you're going
[1:04:21] to change in a moment and a twinkling of
[1:04:24] an eye why because you were praying at
[1:04:26] that moment nope some of you may not be
[1:04:28] praying some of you may be asleep some
[1:04:30] of you may be at work you may be
[1:04:32] brushing your teeth eating your
[1:04:33] breakfast and all of a sudden because
[1:04:36] you are synchronized to Heaven's voice
[1:04:38] something will begin to happen in you
[1:04:41] and you're scared to death that you're
[1:04:43] going to miss it you ain't going to miss
[1:04:45] it as long as you're synchronized with
[1:04:48] Heaven how can you miss it you are the
[1:04:51] very reason that there is a rapture
[1:04:55] I have no fear of missing the Rapture I
[1:04:58] never get up one day of my life and say
[1:05:01] oh no did it happen did it happen why of
[1:05:03] course not I'm still here I'm still here
[1:05:06] Immortal and it ain't happened yet when
[1:05:08] it happens I'm going not possibly not
[1:05:10] perhaps I am guaranteed why brother
[1:05:13] Donnie I've got the token in my life he
[1:05:16] cannot leave me here and I'm
[1:05:19] synchronized with what he's saying I'm
[1:05:22] synchronized with what he's doing so
[1:05:24] when the Rapture transpires I'm going to
[1:05:27] be synchronized with that but the
[1:05:30] majority of the earth is always so out
[1:05:33] of context with what God does what God
[1:05:36] thinks and what God says that they never
[1:05:39] know his move until it's way way out and
[1:05:43] they miss it a million miles oh we're
[1:05:45] blessed in our church now watch Heaven
[1:05:47] itself is told to rejoice as these
[1:05:51] events happen and yet you know I hope
[1:05:53] you understand this judgment is actually
[1:05:55] a Vindication of the righteousness of
[1:05:58] God judgment is a Vindication of the
[1:06:02] righteousness of God so the voice said
[1:06:04] Rejoice over her o heaven now while the
[1:06:08] other people are crying lamenting
[1:06:10] they're sad they're tore all to pieces
[1:06:12] but yet Heaven is told to rejoice and
[1:06:15] now at the same time that this event has
[1:06:18] happened close to the end of the
[1:06:19] tribulation period the people on the
[1:06:22] Earth are lamenting and crying and going
[1:06:24] honestly hurt and yet the people of the
[1:06:27] heavens while they're going and enjoying
[1:06:29] the marriage supper of the Lamb they are
[1:06:31] interrupted momentarily and they are
[1:06:34] told to Rejoice well why are they
[1:06:35] rejoicing because the lamb is there nope
[1:06:37] because the bride is there nope because
[1:06:40] the city's been prepared no because
[1:06:42] Victory is coming to its ultimate goal
[1:06:46] now again I'm sure that we still don't
[1:06:49] see this in the way that God does
[1:06:51] because it was so great that the saints
[1:06:54] of God God that are now there in their
[1:06:57] glorified bodies and whatever we'll be
[1:06:59] doing for three and a half years the
[1:07:01] Lord God brought that to a halt for a
[1:07:05] moment and tells us to Rejoice because
[1:07:08] of something that happened on the earth
[1:07:10] and it wasn't a virgin birth it wasn't
[1:07:13] when Jesus got up at the resurrection it
[1:07:16] wasn't when the Holy Ghost come unto the
[1:07:17] day of Pentecost that this happened we
[1:07:19] don't have any record that this happened
[1:07:21] when Jesus got up from the dead we don't
[1:07:23] have any record that they were told to
[1:07:25] rejoice when the Holy Ghost come on Acts
[1:07:27] chapter one we don't have any record
[1:07:29] they've won the spirit of God begin to
[1:07:31] move and the Lord Jesus ascended up into
[1:07:33] heaven but in this strange when this
[1:07:36] great city is destroyed and annihilated
[1:07:39] the people in heaven are told to Rejoice
[1:07:42] you know what that tells me that tells
[1:07:45] me we need more understanding of how God
[1:07:48] is looking forward to this hour of
[1:07:51] destruction of his greatest enemy that
[1:07:54] that has been on the earth as far as a
[1:07:57] government or a system or a move now
[1:08:00] again I know we say well thank God we're
[1:08:02] not part of that system and we let it go
[1:08:04] with that but can you imagine that
[1:08:06] Heavens are told to Rejoice so this is
[1:08:10] said now from a voice which is coming
[1:08:13] from Heaven itself and it calls upon the
[1:08:16] elect of God which are there in heaven
[1:08:19] to Rejoice over what they've just been
[1:08:22] blown away they have just been
[1:08:25] annihilated by an atomic bomb and the
[1:08:28] people in heaven are told to Rejoice
[1:08:30] What A peculiar seeing what a strange
[1:08:33] thing you see part of our Victory is
[1:08:37] tied to him being crowned once he
[1:08:40] consummates all of this when it's going
[1:08:43] to be put under his feet don't you
[1:08:45] understand he cannot be brought into
[1:08:47] being the son of David I was awakened
[1:08:50] early yesterday morning and I turned
[1:08:52] over and looked at the clock and it was
[1:08:54] 503. I lay down I was thinking a little
[1:08:56] bit praying for different ones it was
[1:08:58] sick and as I lay there for a few
[1:09:00] moments the Lord deals with me but
[1:09:01] sometimes early like that and as I laid
[1:09:04] there I heard the voice of the Lord say
[1:09:06] this
[1:09:07] The Surety of the mercies of David the
[1:09:12] sure mercies of David the sure mercies
[1:09:17] of David I knew that that was a
[1:09:20] scripture but I could not remember
[1:09:22] exactly what it said but whenever I got
[1:09:25] up I got on my phone and I began to look
[1:09:28] at it and I found it in Isaiah and I
[1:09:31] also found it of course in the book of
[1:09:32] Acts in the New Testament and it was God
[1:09:35] a telling of the Covenant which he had
[1:09:38] made with David and I realized that it
[1:09:42] was the mercies of God of why actor
[1:09:45] David did all he did that we've been
[1:09:46] looking at that God did not blot him out
[1:09:49] and God so identified it that he called
[1:09:53] it the sure mercies of David but yet you
[1:09:58] realize that mercies are not extended to
[1:10:01] everybody on the earth in that sure way
[1:10:04] how is it that David did not lose his
[1:10:07] Covenant now he lost his Joy he lost
[1:10:09] much of the great things health of his
[1:10:11] body and things like that because of the
[1:10:13] sin that he was in but he never lost his
[1:10:16] Covenant because it was an Everlasting
[1:10:18] Covenant that God made with him even so
[1:10:21] identified it and called it the sure
[1:10:23] mercies of David and when Paul preached
[1:10:25] about in the book of Acts Paul even
[1:10:27] quoted that and identified it with the
[1:10:30] Lord Jesus in the resurrection and
[1:10:33] placed it as if Jesus was the greater
[1:10:36] son of David himself and applied that
[1:10:40] sure mercies of David to the
[1:10:42] resurrection of our Lord and yet the
[1:10:45] Lord Jesus cannot become heir to the
[1:10:48] world until all these enemies are placed
[1:10:51] under his feet remember what he said in
[1:10:52] the Psalms he said that he would give
[1:10:54] him the his enemy for his footstool and
[1:10:57] that he would Place him under his feet
[1:10:59] and he promised David of the fruit of
[1:11:02] thy body well I set upon thy Throne
[1:11:05] God's saying this of the fruit of of thy
[1:11:08] body while I set upon thy Throne what
[1:11:11] the annihilation of this church of this
[1:11:14] city of this power is one more thing of
[1:11:18] him coming closer to the Millennium
[1:11:20] Reign oh how he's been longing for it
[1:11:22] now can you imagine that he's now going
[1:11:25] to execute judgment upon them and it's
[1:11:29] righteous and he said you Holy Apostles
[1:11:31] and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on
[1:11:35] her he has judged her with the proper
[1:11:39] judgment now notice in Revelation 18 24
[1:11:42] and in her was found the blood of
[1:11:44] prophets and of saints and of all that
[1:11:48] were slain upon the earth now this is
[1:11:50] another reason for her destruction it's
[1:11:53] not just because of all the money and
[1:11:55] all the Commerce but in her was found
[1:11:58] the very blood of the Saints and how was
[1:12:01] that because she threw her system
[1:12:03] through her governmental power and
[1:12:06] control has a and issued the death of
[1:12:09] many a child of God and because of that
[1:12:12] I want you to notice what was in her cup
[1:12:14] when John saw her on the Scarlet colored
[1:12:16] beast and it was a cut but it had what
[1:12:19] in it not wine so much but the blood of
[1:12:22] the saints of God and God is holding her
[1:12:26] guilty now and now her time has come
[1:12:29] therefore because she had drunk of that
[1:12:32] blood it shows by what she is drinking
[1:12:35] what her Destiny is well if you and I
[1:12:38] are drinking of the cup of laodicea then
[1:12:41] I'm afraid our cuff is going to be
[1:12:43] filled with the Judgment of God as well
[1:12:45] but if we are drinking of the wine of
[1:12:48] the stimulation by revelation of the
[1:12:51] mercy of God guess what your judgment's
[1:12:53] going to be it's placed over on Christ
[1:12:55] and you will stand there as being
[1:12:58] absolutely forgiven in the eyes of God
[1:13:00] and because of what you're drinking from
[1:13:02] your cut show us where you are you've
[1:13:05] got the wine of Revelation in your cut
[1:13:07] you can't go through the tribulation
[1:13:08] where are you going in the Rapture
[1:13:10] because it's been revealed to you by the
[1:13:13] Holy Ghost and you are waiting on that
[1:13:16] Revelation and the church said
[1:13:18] amen so notice that God is now going to
[1:13:21] avenge upon them so the very beginning
[1:13:24] of Apostles say I hope you understand
[1:13:25] this that the prophet said the Catholic
[1:13:27] Church actually began on the day of
[1:13:30] Pentecost now he said they were the
[1:13:33] original Church oh not Peter James and
[1:13:35] John but those that come out of that and
[1:13:38] identified themselves as saying they
[1:13:40] were Apostolic yeah right they're about
[1:13:41] as Apostolic as I am a groundhog they're
[1:13:44] not original Apostolic at all is that
[1:13:46] right no they think they are and they
[1:13:48] think they got a right to change the
[1:13:50] Bible but they don't they don't believe
[1:13:52] what the apostles taught or wrote or
[1:13:54] preached they don't do it at all but yet
[1:13:56] they claim that and because they claim
[1:13:59] it God will judge them for the claim so
[1:14:02] God says and all that were slain upon
[1:14:05] the earth now they know as far as
[1:14:07] individuals they didn't kill everybody
[1:14:08] but they kill many many of them and at
[1:14:12] their declaration and their decree they
[1:14:15] had many of them killed down Through the
[1:14:17] Ages and we know through this Spanish
[1:14:18] Inquisition and the Jewish Inquisition
[1:14:20] many different ones by the Catholic
[1:14:22] church and they thought they'd got by
[1:14:24] with it but they haven't gone by with it
[1:14:26] at all now notice in Revelation 19 1 and
[1:14:30] after these things notice this after
[1:14:33] these things what things the thing that
[1:14:36] we just saw here in revelation 18. after
[1:14:40] these things I heard a great voice of
[1:14:44] much people notice what they were doing
[1:14:46] in heaven I heard a great noise of much
[1:14:51] people in heaven now notice what these
[1:14:53] people were doing after these things
[1:14:56] were done on the earth so here come an
[1:14:58] atomic bombing and all they did wrong
[1:15:00] and all these people were weeping and
[1:15:02] crying and going on the office ever was
[1:15:04] and after all of that happened on the
[1:15:07] earth then Sean said I looked up this
[1:15:10] way and after those things I Heard a
[1:15:13] Voice of much people praise God Saints
[1:15:16] you were right there with them I heard
[1:15:18] voice of much people and this and what
[1:15:21] they were saying they were saying
[1:15:23] Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor
[1:15:28] and power unto the Lord Our God so I to
[1:15:33] the angel had declared the fall of
[1:15:36] Babylon you imagine this must been
[1:15:37] pretty important to God because we're
[1:15:39] all just up our fellowship and enjoying
[1:15:41] the blessings of God sent around a
[1:15:43] marriage supper of the lamb and just
[1:15:45] talking about the goodness of God wow
[1:15:47] this is a glorious time for us but all
[1:15:49] of a sudden what we're doing whatever
[1:15:50] we're doing we hear this voice that said
[1:15:52] hey Saints Rejoice rejoice and we say
[1:15:56] okay wow yeah that's what we do we did
[1:15:58] that on Earth we're really good at
[1:15:59] Rejoice what are we rejoicing about an
[1:16:02] atomic bomb just fell on your enemy an
[1:16:05] atomic bomb just annihilated this Roman
[1:16:07] Empire an atomic bomb just destroyed it
[1:16:10] which means your husband is closer to
[1:16:13] his song this is her glory to God this
[1:16:16] is just one more saying that brings him
[1:16:19] closer to his strong why tell my brother
[1:16:21] died his Millennium Throne as the son of
[1:16:24] David
[1:16:26] amen notice so the angel has declared
[1:16:28] that Babylon has fallen and then our
[1:16:31] response is supposed to be what we're
[1:16:33] supposed to Rejoice well don't you see
[1:16:35] why then whenever we see a brother or
[1:16:37] sister delivered of a sickness or a
[1:16:40] disease or maybe an addiction or a habit
[1:16:42] or something like that what should we as
[1:16:44] the saints of God do we should rejoice
[1:16:46] in the Lord shall we not we see a
[1:16:49] brother or sister of ours that's been
[1:16:50] bearing a heavy load or a real difficult
[1:16:53] time in their life and we hear that
[1:16:55] God's done something for him well
[1:16:56] brother Donnie it wasn't me you should
[1:16:58] Rejoice with them because they are your
[1:17:01] brothers and sisters now Heaven is going
[1:17:03] to be so moved and Heaven itself is so
[1:17:07] moved by this destruction on the earth
[1:17:09] that this voice reverberates down
[1:17:12] through eternity you imagine down to the
[1:17:15] universe and back and here they are the
[1:17:17] millions of saints of God and they are
[1:17:19] rejoice and because of what they were
[1:17:21] saved rejoicing because they got the
[1:17:23] Holy Ghost rejoice and because they were
[1:17:25] in the rapture sure rejoicing because
[1:17:27] Rome's been annihilated
[1:17:30] well see y'all y'all ain't in tune
[1:17:34] oh okay
[1:17:36] Rome's going to be destroyed wow Brother
[1:17:39] Don that's really something
[1:17:41] that's really something it is really
[1:17:43] something
[1:17:44] it is so important to God now and this
[1:17:48] voice that screams out of heaven and
[1:17:52] it's the the way that the word that John
[1:17:54] used here to write is that the the terms
[1:17:57] in the Greek language so powerful and
[1:17:59] it's a voice that he's wanting them not
[1:18:02] just say Amen
[1:18:04] amen
[1:18:05] praise the Lord
[1:18:07] some of y'all get wilder than bucks
[1:18:09] sometimes in church you do this you're
[1:18:11] just beside yourself
[1:18:13] but John said I don't want you to do
[1:18:15] this I want you to scream Hallelujah
[1:18:20] Hallelujah
[1:18:22] Hallelujah you mean we're rejoicing
[1:18:24] because people are destroyed we are
[1:18:27] rejoicing because this Kingdom has been
[1:18:29] annihilated yes don't you understand how
[1:18:32] a heaven looks at such things
[1:18:36] come on I heard a great voice of much
[1:18:39] people in heaven so the idolatry city is
[1:18:43] destroyed the idolatrous government is
[1:18:45] absolutely annihilated and these people
[1:18:48] are in such Unison with the will of God
[1:18:50] and this Universal Joy is all forever
[1:18:53] there won't be a half a dozen send them
[1:18:55] here me and brother Joel saying well
[1:18:56] glory to God hallelujah and then this
[1:18:59] quiet Baptist section over here they
[1:19:00] said well
[1:19:03] packages
[1:19:05] amen amen that's right glory to God but
[1:19:09] here come this loud voice and they were
[1:19:12] worshiping and praising and you know
[1:19:15] what they're all doing it for said
[1:19:16] praise God it has been destroyed it has
[1:19:20] been annihilated all glory to God I
[1:19:22] don't know about you when I've been
[1:19:24] healed of the sickness in my body or
[1:19:26] somebody else that I love has been
[1:19:27] healed I can Rejoice oh I can praise God
[1:19:31] when I know somebody's been delivered or
[1:19:33] something they're going through you know
[1:19:35] when you imagine when we get there and
[1:19:38] this happens on on the earth and we are
[1:19:40] so in sync with God in heaven and what's
[1:19:43] going on that we will rejoice and say
[1:19:46] hallelujah don't drag out your
[1:19:47] handkerchief to cry you ain't going to
[1:19:49] be crying you're not going to be the
[1:19:51] Lord so sad it's so sad no it is not sad
[1:19:55] they had their opportunity and they
[1:19:57] turned it down remember God is not me
[1:20:00] and God is Not unjust and God would have
[1:20:03] never done this had they not spurned his
[1:20:05] Mercy and his grace
[1:20:08] amen now look at this the word
[1:20:10] hallelujah it means praise ye yah praise
[1:20:16] ye yah j-a-h now remember David was the
[1:20:21] first one in the Old Testament to
[1:20:23] mention this name yah and the first time
[1:20:26] it appears David mentions it when he's
[1:20:30] talking about the wicked being destroyed
[1:20:33] on the earth wow so David mentions this
[1:20:37] word praise ye yah in the Book of Psalms
[1:20:41] and he's mentioning it when the wicked
[1:20:43] are going to be annihilated now it's
[1:20:46] amazing because you come from Psalms and
[1:20:48] then you come through the Old Testament
[1:20:49] prophetic books they never mentioned it
[1:20:51] again Matthew Mark Luke and John don't
[1:20:54] mention it again Pauline Epistles do not
[1:20:56] mention it again what does it show up
[1:20:58] again in the Book of Revelation so this
[1:21:02] tells me that at the end time there's
[1:21:06] going to be a people that's going to
[1:21:08] recognize the kingdom is coming so close
[1:21:11] it's time to praise ye yah
[1:21:15] amen so what is it praise ye yah or the
[1:21:20] better name we know it is Jehovah now
[1:21:22] the Septuagint and also John takes those
[1:21:25] Greek words and puts it together like a
[1:21:28] contraction of the Greek letters and
[1:21:30] makes it an Alleluia instead of a
[1:21:33] Hallelujah it is an Allelujah so what is
[1:21:38] it we praise ye yah now the Psalms are
[1:21:41] divided into ten sorts of Psalms they
[1:21:44] say but they say that this word
[1:21:46] hallelujah is the most perfect one
[1:21:49] because it is praise and yah in one
[1:21:53] compact form so when you say hallelujah
[1:21:56] you are praising yah and David was a
[1:22:00] praising man now I know we've been
[1:22:02] laying pretty low in the last couple of
[1:22:04] weeks but don't leave David in the pit
[1:22:06] because I'm telling you David ain't in
[1:22:09] the pit but I want to paint him like he
[1:22:11] was and then I want to show you how God
[1:22:14] brought him back out again and all glory
[1:22:16] and God still extended to him the sure
[1:22:19] mercies of David isn't that an awesome
[1:22:22] statement you never find that being
[1:22:24] called the sheer mercies of Abraham or
[1:22:26] the sheer mercies of Isaac or the sheer
[1:22:28] mercies of Jacob but the sure mercies of
[1:22:31] David so God did not leave him in that
[1:22:35] spot but God raised him up and brought
[1:22:37] him out no wonder the man could say
[1:22:40] praise ye yah praise ye yah because
[1:22:44] David could see himself as a sinner he
[1:22:47] could see himself as one that fell away
[1:22:49] from the Providence of God and the will
[1:22:52] of God and what did God do he reached
[1:22:54] right down to that muck and he got a
[1:22:56] hold to David and he lifted him out oh
[1:22:58] brother I can imagine he was a shouting
[1:23:01] man I'm telling you what before that
[1:23:03] fall but after he got renewed I'd say
[1:23:05] they had a hard time keeping that guy in
[1:23:07] church when you he was probably so
[1:23:09] grateful that God forgive him he was so
[1:23:11] thankful well I'll tell you I feel kind
[1:23:13] of the same way tonight I'm so thankful
[1:23:15] know that God called me I'm so thankful
[1:23:17] that the Lord called you I'm so thankful
[1:23:20] that the Lord give us the message of the
[1:23:22] end time I say praise ye yah praise ye
[1:23:27] yah
[1:23:29] I always spend more time praising the
[1:23:31] Democrats and praising the Republicans
[1:23:33] praising our sickness well the doctor
[1:23:35] told me this and the doctor told me that
[1:23:37] my lumbay going my bursitis and my
[1:23:40] pneumonia and all this what about your
[1:23:43] God why don't you quit claiming that old
[1:23:45] bursitis why don't you cook claiming
[1:23:47] that old or whatever else you've got in
[1:23:48] your body and go to praise in your God
[1:23:51] and you might praise your way right out
[1:23:53] of that Valley praise your way right out
[1:23:55] of that trial that you're going through
[1:23:57] or you can sit around and feel sorry for
[1:23:59] yourself and never move
[1:24:03] um
[1:24:04] all glory
[1:24:06] well I'll tell you I'm longing for the
[1:24:09] time
[1:24:11] when we're going to hear
[1:24:13] those
[1:24:14] four
[1:24:16] alleluias
[1:24:18] I've heard a lot of hallelujahs in my
[1:24:21] life
[1:24:22] I've heard him since I was a little 12
[1:24:24] year old boy
[1:24:26] I didn't know what the word meant I just
[1:24:28] seen my uncle and them at the church why
[1:24:30] God saved glory to God my uncle was a
[1:24:33] shouter he
[1:24:35] take him feet like that and hold them
[1:24:37] hands up and go to speaking in tongues
[1:24:39] I'll tell you what whoa he'd say he'd
[1:24:42] shout hallelujah thank you Jesus thank
[1:24:45] you Jesus Oh yes sir he was I'm looking
[1:24:48] I'm planning on meeting him too hey yeah
[1:24:51] you you tell me no matter how low he was
[1:24:53] if I get the guitar and I'd hit the
[1:24:56] right key and I'd sing
[1:24:59] I would not be denied Uncle Harold go to
[1:25:04] stomping them feet I would not be denied
[1:25:08] you're going to throwing them hands up
[1:25:10] on the air and dancing around why
[1:25:11] because he loved the Lord there's
[1:25:13] something about that song that Minister
[1:25:15] turned that he wasn't going to be denied
[1:25:17] and I don't believe he was neither but
[1:25:19] you know what I've heard a lot of
[1:25:20] hallelujahs I've heard them in Africa
[1:25:22] I've heard him in India I've heard them
[1:25:24] in Europe not as many in Europe I have
[1:25:27] heard them in England I hope did hear a
[1:25:28] few actually in England I've heard of
[1:25:30] you in Norway I've heard a few there but
[1:25:32] I ain't never heard them like I'm fixing
[1:25:34] to hear them before long because I'm
[1:25:36] going to hear it from a bunch of
[1:25:38] redeemed people that are going to stand
[1:25:40] there Hallelujah and glorified bodies no
[1:25:43] more trouble no more heartache no more
[1:25:45] sorrow not one more day of a sickness
[1:25:47] not another migraine not another
[1:25:50] headache not another belly a not another
[1:25:52] test not another child not another
[1:25:55] holiday oh you talking about a group of
[1:25:58] people all being able to say hallelujah

[1:26:06] tell you one thing I'm not going to wait
[1:26:08] till then I'm going to praise him
[1:26:10] tonight I want to love him I'm going to
[1:26:12] give him my all what about you
[1:26:23] I feel like praising him a little
[1:26:25] let me tell you one thing several
[1:26:28] several weeks ago I went over to the
[1:26:29] church and I was going to lay some Stone
[1:26:31] I started about eight o'clock that
[1:26:33] morning and I lay till about 4 30 5
[1:26:35] o'clock that afternoon on the concrete
[1:26:38] floor I couldn't hardly walk whenever I
[1:26:39] got ready to go to my truck by the time
[1:26:41] I got ready to get in my bed at that
[1:26:43] night Carol had to help me into the bed
[1:26:45] my feet were killing me they were
[1:26:48] inflamed the plantar fasciitis I've been
[1:26:50] dealing with oh my goodness I thought
[1:26:53] Lord what in the world am I going to do
[1:26:54] but you know what in the last several
[1:26:56] weeks I've been over four and five days
[1:26:59] every week sometimes eight and ten hours
[1:27:02] I was there this morning at 6 30 and
[1:27:04] been laying Stone been staining been
[1:27:06] doing this and that and the other on the
[1:27:08] concrete I think it's time I give him a
[1:27:10] great big Hallelujah Oh Glory why smooth
[1:27:14] for me well is anybody else in here got
[1:27:17] something to praise him for is anybody
[1:27:19] else in here got something that God's
[1:27:21] moved for you so many times not because
[1:27:23] she was worthy not because you was good
[1:27:26] it's because he's good not because we're
[1:27:30] good but because he loves us and he
[1:27:33] loves to manifest himself
[1:27:42] although she'll bother me a little bit
[1:27:44] but a little bit's better than a whole
[1:27:45] lot
[1:27:47] I'm on my way out
[1:27:49] oh my goodness I'm probably the only
[1:27:51] preacher that you know of that's been
[1:27:53] packing six pairs of shoes in his pickup
[1:27:55] because I want I wear one pair for a
[1:27:58] couple of hours and then I trade out and
[1:27:59] wear another pair and then they'll trade
[1:28:01] out and want another pair to keep my
[1:28:02] feet from getting by but I feel pretty
[1:28:04] good right here tonight you know why
[1:28:06] because the Lord is healing me now he
[1:28:08] could have done a miracle if he'd wanted
[1:28:09] to but apparently said no Donnie I ain't
[1:28:12] going to give you a miracle this time
[1:28:13] but I'm going to give you a little dab
[1:28:15] of healing on Monday and another little
[1:28:16] dab on Tuesday and another little dab on
[1:28:19] Wednesday and I'm going to get a little
[1:28:21] bit more on week one and week two and
[1:28:23] week three praise the Lord I'm about on
[1:28:25] week four right now look out devil we
[1:28:28] five might be my complete Miracle but

[1:28:32] saints of God realize who we are well

[1:28:43] a sign of coming judgment to Demons
[1:28:47] ever test you go sir every trial ever
[1:28:50] disease that God puts under your feet
[1:28:52] it's a sign of oncoming judgment to
[1:28:56] Demons
[1:28:58] it will not go unpunished
[1:29:06] no wonder they said Hallelujah
[1:29:10] after these things I heard a great voice
[1:29:13] of much people in heaven saying
[1:29:15] hallelujah
[1:29:17] salvation and glory and honor and power
[1:29:21] unto the Lord our God
[1:29:24] verse 3. and again a bunch of Holy
[1:29:27] Rollers
[1:29:29] and again they said Hallelujah
[1:29:34] but notice the next words
[1:29:37] and her smoke
[1:29:41] rose up forever and ever wow
[1:29:44] so these people are praising God
[1:29:47] and smoke is rising up
[1:29:53] see we have a hard time with that nobody
[1:29:55] we have a hard time synchronizing that
[1:29:57] remember how can we Rejoice over such
[1:30:00] why do we have that that problem between
[1:30:02] us we don't see his enemy the way he
[1:30:05] does
[1:30:10] again they said Hallelujah and her smoke
[1:30:13] rose up forever and ever the Greek word
[1:30:15] there is anyone and anyon
[1:30:19] which means space of time and space of
[1:30:22] time
[1:30:23] not eternal
[1:30:25] or the devil will no doubt be the
[1:30:27] longest one that will burn
[1:30:29] and he may be down there for millions of
[1:30:31] years hope he gets added another couple
[1:30:34] million just for what he's put us
[1:30:35] through don't you just burn his old hide
[1:30:38] down there
[1:30:40] all his demons with him
[1:30:42] but it will eventually come to a time to
[1:30:46] when all of these people will cease to
[1:30:50] exist
[1:30:51] now people call us mean yeah mean and
[1:30:55] having no mercy because we preach
[1:30:57] election and predestination
[1:31:00] and they say they're full of Mercy
[1:31:02] and preaching eternal hell
[1:31:06] so a person lived 16 years of their life
[1:31:08] and they go out and get drunk on their
[1:31:10] 16th birthday or 17th birthday and they
[1:31:12] die and they're going to go to a lake of
[1:31:14] fire and Burn For Eternity for 17 years
[1:31:17] of sin and then you tell me when God
[1:31:19] Mercy I say you don't understand Mercy
[1:31:21] my God is a just God he is not going to
[1:31:25] judge a 17 year old boy an 18 year old
[1:31:27] girl for the same amount that he's going
[1:31:30] to judge the prince of the power of the
[1:31:32] air that old boy has gone a long time
[1:31:35] I'm telling you and I'm going to be
[1:31:37] rejoicing when he gets thrown in ain't
[1:31:39] you I'm going to Rejoice whenever they
[1:31:41] lock him up with a chain of circumstance
[1:31:43] that he ain't got nobody in the
[1:31:44] Millennium to be able to work through
[1:31:46] notice them when our hearts really get
[1:31:49] in tune with God it's not that we look
[1:31:51] at upon people and say well I'm glad
[1:31:53] they're going through this and I'm glad
[1:31:55] we're going to that but we look at it in
[1:31:57] a higher form in a God form that God is
[1:32:00] bringing the kingdoms of this world in
[1:32:03] subjection to his word I know some of
[1:32:06] you it kills you because you're your
[1:32:08] party whatever it is your party's not
[1:32:10] the controlling this and this and that
[1:32:12] you're wanting your party to make things
[1:32:14] better it's too far gone it's too far
[1:32:17] gone I don't care who we get in the
[1:32:19] White House the White House is doomed
[1:32:21] our nation is finished
[1:32:23] come on Saints it's the truth there's no
[1:32:25] hope for the nation itself but there is
[1:32:28] hope for individuals
[1:32:30] there's only one hope for this world and
[1:32:33] that's the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:35] now watch this in the 4 and 20 elders
[1:32:38] and the four beasts fell down and
[1:32:42] worshiped
[1:32:43] wow what a peculiar thing
[1:32:46] to worship God over
[1:32:48] people smoke
[1:32:51] is coming up and you're just having a
[1:32:53] spell
[1:32:54] I mean you're just glory to God
[1:32:56] hallelujah praise the Lord and they just
[1:32:59] fall down the elders just fall down they
[1:33:01] say this is awesome this is absolutely
[1:33:03] wonderful this is tremendous this is
[1:33:05] great this is a great sign of victory
[1:33:10] y'all sitting there look at him and
[1:33:11] trying to figure this out
[1:33:16] this has been
[1:33:21] and the throne
[1:33:23] is right before him
[1:33:25] cannot take it as long as they rule
[1:33:30] notice this in the 420 elders and the
[1:33:32] four beasts fell down and worshiped God
[1:33:34] said on the throne saying amen
[1:33:38] Hallelujah
[1:33:40] in verse 6. and I heard it's a word of
[1:33:43] voice
[1:33:45] of a great multitude
[1:33:47] and as the voice of many Waters
[1:33:52] any all ever stood at the Niagara Falls
[1:33:56] and y'all ever sit at great great
[1:33:57] waterfalls and you hear that sound of
[1:34:00] all those millions of gallons of water
[1:34:03] coming over there that
[1:34:07] that Roar and that splashing and all
[1:34:10] I've seen some of the large rivers of
[1:34:12] the world and been in Africa and places
[1:34:14] like that and to see some of those Falls
[1:34:16] it's just absolutely breathtaking and
[1:34:19] each one of those is a drop of water so
[1:34:22] it's a drop in another drop and another
[1:34:23] drop in another drop now you take one of
[1:34:25] those drops out of that that water
[1:34:27] that's going to come down on the Niagara
[1:34:29] and you take that one drop and isolate
[1:34:31] it and let it make it sound you probably
[1:34:33] wouldn't even hear it you just dropped
[1:34:35] that little one drop of water and you
[1:34:37] just try to listen listen when you're
[1:34:38] nothing but you take it and it's
[1:34:40] brothers and its uncles and his cousin
[1:34:42] and his grandma and his nephew and his
[1:34:43] great grandma and his great nephew and
[1:34:45] his third grandma and all that sort of
[1:34:46] thing and you put them all together then
[1:34:48] what do you get
[1:34:52] and you're back saying your little voice
[1:34:54] ain't much well it may not be much to
[1:34:56] you but to him it's a whole lot but you
[1:34:58] put yours with yours and yours and yours
[1:35:01] and yours and mine and then with yours
[1:35:03] and without one then what does it do and
[1:35:05] John heard all of these voices as they
[1:35:07] were thundering down there can you

[1:35:10] bodies that was Paul that was Luther

[1:35:14] of all the ages that was Abraham Isaac
[1:35:16] Jacob Joseph all the elect of God and
[1:35:19] they are told to Rejoice you think they

[1:35:26] spirit now let's everybody worship God

[1:36:01] fixing to go back down there and take

[1:38:41] forever
[1:38:43] forever it never stops
[1:38:46] [Applause]
[1:38:48] oh
[1:38:51] I just wish we could go tonight
[1:38:56] man after preaching this stuff tonight I
[1:38:58] don't want to go to work tomorrow
[1:39:00] sorry brother say nothing against you
[1:39:04] oh
[1:39:05] Hallelujah
[1:39:07] praise ye yah Hallelujah
[1:39:11] praise the Lord and they're just
[1:39:14] worshiping and praising
[1:39:17] and hell is breaking loose down on the
[1:39:19] Earth
[1:39:20] and they're not necessarily praising God
[1:39:23] that people are annihilated they're not
[1:39:25] praising God that these people are going
[1:39:27] through so much trouble they're praising
[1:39:30] God that the end is so close at hand and
[1:39:33] their husband is fixing to be
[1:39:36] the son of David
[1:39:40] going to be crying
[1:39:42] cracking
[1:39:44] Hallelujah
[1:39:46] the destruction of sin and the
[1:39:49] destruction of the man of sin
[1:39:52] you see it will reverberate can you
[1:39:55] imagine voices like that all the way
[1:39:58] down Rippling down through eternity to
[1:40:01] the universe where it ceases to exist if
[1:40:03] it does and turns and comes back that's
[1:40:06] what Reverb is reverberation so in every
[1:40:09] room you have an acoustic now this and
[1:40:11] you're pretty dead so whenever I cut my
[1:40:13] hands it's pretty much dead but you're
[1:40:15] going to a building you can pretty well
[1:40:16] tell how much Acoustics you got there
[1:40:17] but you clap your hands in one two three
[1:40:19] four five and that's how much
[1:40:21] soundproofing that you're going to have
[1:40:22] to do can you imagine in heaven when the
[1:40:24] Acoustics are absolutely perfect and all
[1:40:26] these millions times millions of voices
[1:40:28] begin to ring out and they begin to
[1:40:30] worship and praise and somebody brings
[1:40:33] out on a course and we'll begin to bless
[1:40:35] the name of the Lord and sing and all
[1:40:37] this is going on they say praise the
[1:40:38] Lord praise the Lord what's going on
[1:40:40] down in heaven nukes
[1:40:43] uh
[1:40:44] watching me y'all y'all are Rejoice him
[1:40:46] because some people got blowed up no
[1:40:49] no
[1:40:50] we're rejoicing because it's one step
[1:40:52] closer for us and our husband
[1:40:55] to get back our inheritance
[1:41:00] praise the Lord
[1:41:02] now remember they're not doing this out
[1:41:05] of a vindictive spirit
[1:41:07] they're not doing this because they're
[1:41:09] events they seek somebody down there
[1:41:11] that they didn't lock on Earth and they
[1:41:12] see somebody that done them wrong oh I
[1:41:14] knew they'd get it on there they'd get
[1:41:15] it no that's not their Spirit at all now
[1:41:18] they're totally changed into his image
[1:41:22] oh praise the Lord
[1:41:24] notice verse 2.
[1:41:26] for true
[1:41:27] and righteous
[1:41:30] ah now you see this is why we have a
[1:41:32] problem
[1:41:34] true
[1:41:35] and righteous
[1:41:37] are his judgments not his Mercy
[1:41:41] not his grace not his forgiveness
[1:41:46] but his judgments
[1:41:48] for he hath judged the great
[1:41:52] which did corrupt the Earth
[1:41:55] with her fornication
[1:41:57] I'd hath Avenge the blood of his
[1:42:01] servants
[1:42:02] at her hand
[1:42:04] and their rejoicing because of that
[1:42:10] I mean you understand we need help
[1:42:15] see the calamities that come upon these
[1:42:18] people are rightly deserved
[1:42:22] rightly deserved the Hittites the
[1:42:25] amorites the jebusites all the Canaanite
[1:42:28] people the seven tribes
[1:42:30] God did not go in there and drive out a
[1:42:33] good sincere God loving god-abiding
[1:42:36] people and give their land to the
[1:42:38] children of Israel they burned their
[1:42:40] children
[1:42:41] they offered their children to moloch to
[1:42:45] keemosh
[1:42:46] they've done horrible horrible things
[1:42:49] and God judged them for it and took
[1:42:52] their land and gave it to the children
[1:42:54] of Israel
[1:42:55] the children of Israel several
[1:42:58] Generations after that what did they
[1:43:00] start doing burning their children
[1:43:02] offering their children to Molech to
[1:43:04] keemosh and what did God do drive them
[1:43:07] out and send them to Babylon
[1:43:10] so it was just judgment so now God is
[1:43:14] annihilating this enemy oh my for he has
[1:43:19] judged the great horde Jezebel of course
[1:43:22] Babylon the romish Antichrist
[1:43:28] um
[1:43:29] notice this
[1:43:31] let me bring it on down now second
[1:43:33] Thessalonians chapter one
[1:43:35] verse 6.
[1:43:37] seeing it is a righteous thing with God
[1:43:43] to recompense
[1:43:46] tribulation
[1:43:48] to them
[1:43:50] that trouble you
[1:43:57] just a little bit of friendly advice
[1:44:00] if I was you I'd be good to everybody
[1:44:04] not just your friends not just your
[1:44:06] family those that you like
[1:44:09] now think what Paul said seeing it is a
[1:44:12] righteous thing with God
[1:44:16] to recompense tribulation
[1:44:20] to them that troubled you so persecution
[1:44:24] is an affliction
[1:44:27] those who persecute us those who laugh
[1:44:30] at your hair sisters your dress those
[1:44:33] that life at the doctrines that we hold
[1:44:36] on to and hold us dear those who make
[1:44:39] fun of us and run us down and so on and
[1:44:42] so on and so on it's not just what they
[1:44:45] say about us in social media and what
[1:44:47] they do but it brings a pressure in our
[1:44:51] spirit
[1:44:52] it brings a tribulation as it were to
[1:44:56] our mind what will they do what will
[1:44:59] they say how will they react now listen
[1:45:02] what Paul said you see Paul it broke in
[1:45:04] to this understanding about an aspect of
[1:45:07] the righteousness of God that as I can
[1:45:09] tell from looking some of you tonight
[1:45:10] you're still struggling with Paul only
[1:45:12] broke into it to recompense tribulation
[1:45:15] to them that was troubling the saints of
[1:45:18] God is that God will trouble the
[1:45:22] troublemakers
[1:45:25] God will trouble
[1:45:28] the troublemakers
[1:45:31] but he will relieve
[1:45:33] the troubled
[1:45:37] amen I don't want to be no Troublemaker
[1:45:40] to you well I mean except for the devil
[1:45:41] and for hell of course I do want to do
[1:45:43] that you see your trials are a sign of a
[1:45:48] coming judgment
[1:45:50] yeah someone is persecuting you now many
[1:45:54] times it's people under demonic
[1:45:56] influence say themselves are not
[1:45:57] necessarily Wicked or evil but they just
[1:45:59] get under the influence of an evil
[1:46:01] spirit and they go to troubling you and
[1:46:03] harassing you and saying things against
[1:46:05] you whatever more that it is and it's
[1:46:07] like something that hangs over you and
[1:46:09] you just can't get over it you know
[1:46:11] sometimes it can be somebody you work
[1:46:13] with sometimes it can be a family member
[1:46:15] it can be a friend it can be all kinds
[1:46:17] of people and yet they just it's like
[1:46:19] they get joy out of trouble you anybody
[1:46:22] ever deal with anybody like that well
[1:46:23] sure you have and yet it's something
[1:46:25] that you try your best to work around
[1:46:27] you nice to them and you try to do
[1:46:30] whatever you can do just to calm them
[1:46:32] and settle them and it seems like
[1:46:33] nothing that you ever do makes any
[1:46:35] difference remember most of the time
[1:46:37] that's an evil spirit that is using that
[1:46:40] individual don't don't hate them don't
[1:46:42] get angry and all upset at them just
[1:46:44] pray for them that God will have mercy
[1:46:46] on them help them to see that they're
[1:46:47] just an instrument is all they are but
[1:46:49] notice what Paul said the same that it
[1:46:51] is a righteous thing with God to
[1:46:53] recompense tribulation to them that
[1:46:56] trouble you so God will punish punish
[1:47:01] those who trouble his bride
[1:47:03] those who ridicule this message those
[1:47:06] who make fun of God's Prophet oh my
[1:47:09] goodness
[1:47:10] God will bring anguish and anxiety and
[1:47:15] trouble and if they do not repent they
[1:47:17] will stand before God at the white
[1:47:19] throne and give an account for every
[1:47:21] word they have said against this word
[1:47:25] it's righteous with God to trouble
[1:47:29] troublemakers
[1:47:37] sweet Jesus I thought I was in trouble a
[1:47:39] while ago I'm really in trouble now
[1:47:41] well that friend this ought to make
[1:47:43] every one of us not be a troublemaker in
[1:47:45] her home and our church in the move of
[1:47:47] God in our business on your job United
[1:47:50] some people I don't care what you do
[1:47:51] they are never happy it just seemed like
[1:47:54] they are born for adversity and I don't
[1:47:58] care what you do it's just they do
[1:48:00] they're never happy if you paint if you
[1:48:02] put Green carpet on the floor they'll
[1:48:04] say I didn't want green I wanted purple
[1:48:06] and if you put purple on the floor they
[1:48:09] say I didn't want that shade of purple I
[1:48:11] wanted the other shade of purple and if
[1:48:14] you paint the walls green they wanted
[1:48:15] Yeller and if you paint it yellow they
[1:48:18] say I don't like that Yeller I wanted
[1:48:19] that Yeller I don't want this and I
[1:48:22] don't like that and it seemed like
[1:48:23] they're not happy unless they're causing
[1:48:25] trouble but Jesus said blessed are the
[1:48:29] peacemakers for they shall be called the
[1:48:32] children of God
[1:48:35] oh my now Paul is speaking this from
[1:48:39] experience and where this is written
[1:48:41] from of course is the city of
[1:48:43] thessalonica
[1:48:45] and remember that Paul had been driven
[1:48:48] from thessalonica
[1:48:51] by persecution of a bunch of zealous
[1:48:55] Jews which hated him
[1:48:58] a mob attacked several of the Saints
[1:49:03] some of them were arrested the children
[1:49:05] of God
[1:49:07] Paul had to sneak out of the city by
[1:49:11] night
[1:49:13] so Paul is speaking this from experience
[1:49:16] I don't believe he was writing in this
[1:49:18] now I had a vindictiveness I can't wait
[1:49:20] till God Burns her height and hell I'll
[1:49:22] tell you one thing he is declaring a
[1:49:24] decree from God
[1:49:27] it is a righteous thing with God
[1:49:30] to recompense tribulation
[1:49:34] to them that trouble you
[1:49:38] right well you see the word there are
[1:49:40] trouble is this word philipsis
[1:49:44] the Greek word philipsis and it means
[1:49:48] great emotional stress
[1:49:51] caused by external
[1:49:54] or internal pressure
[1:49:57] great emotional and spiritual stress
[1:50:03] caused by internal or external stress
[1:50:09] or pressure
[1:50:11] let's stand
[1:50:14] for real
[1:50:21] oh
[1:50:28] the final destruction of the great enemy
[1:50:31] of the church
[1:50:33] was so momentous
[1:50:36] that God tells them to say hallelujah
[1:50:38] and they do the great voice out of
[1:50:40] heaven
[1:50:43] or smoke starts rising up
[1:50:46] and they are so happy of what they see
[1:50:49] happening
[1:50:51] that they say it again
[1:50:54] and then the voice of many Waters
[1:50:56] and then in verse 6 I heard of voices of
[1:50:59] a great multitude as the voice of many
[1:51:01] Waters the voice of Mighty thundering
[1:51:02] saying hallelujah
[1:51:05] for the Lord God omnipotent reignus
[1:51:09] they were rejoicing and rejoicing why
[1:51:13] they saw their King coming closer to his
[1:51:17] crowd
[1:51:19] and they rejoiced
[1:51:21] oh I'll tell you one thing friends I
[1:51:24] think we ought to Rejoice more and
[1:51:26] complain less
[1:51:30] I believe we'd be better off don't you
[1:51:33] let me read this to you this is the
[1:51:36] fourth time in which this is uttered in
[1:51:38] an expressive of the joy of the heavenly
[1:51:41] host in the view of the overthrow of the
[1:51:46] enemies of the church and the occasion
[1:51:49] was so momentous in heaven
[1:51:52] they just couldn't stop praising
[1:51:55] they just couldn't stop rejoicing
[1:51:57] hallelujah hallelujah and then they
[1:52:00] stopped and somebody else started again
[1:52:03] well Hallelujah
[1:52:04] and it was just catching it was just
[1:52:06] like it was catching
[1:52:08] and then they kind of calmed down a
[1:52:10] little bit and they heard another voice
[1:52:11] say I wish somebody would praise the
[1:52:13] Lord and somebody said hallelujah
[1:52:15] hallelujah
[1:52:17] mama
[1:52:19] I wish we'd become a little bit more
[1:52:22] like that
[1:52:24] you ever get around anybody that
[1:52:26] you ask them how they're doing and 30
[1:52:29] minutes later you wish you hadn't
[1:52:35] they've got their CT scan on their phone
[1:52:37] they've got their MRI they've got the
[1:52:39] brain scan their liver scan the pancreas
[1:52:41] scan the gallbladder scan they've got to
[1:52:43] ever scan them and they tell you and you
[1:52:44] say dear God I wish I hadn't even asked
[1:52:46] and you whenever have you ever felt
[1:52:48] worse after being around people like
[1:52:50] that you ever wow wow so why is that
[1:52:53] because it creates that kind of an
[1:52:55] atmosphere
[1:52:57] well I wonder if we'd be a little bit
[1:52:58] more contagious with praise and love and
[1:53:01] worship
[1:53:03] don't you figure that's kind of
[1:53:04] contagious too
[1:53:06] wonder what service to be here Sunday if
[1:53:08] we come in here and brother Aaron and
[1:53:10] some of you brothers and some of you
[1:53:12] sisters and you young sisters you would
[1:53:14] commend you and say praise God I'm so
[1:53:16] excited about the service I'm just so
[1:53:18] happy I'm just so excited oh man can you
[1:53:21] imagine now people that love football
[1:53:22] and all these things you know they're
[1:53:24] going to be buying tickets and they're
[1:53:26] going to be going out there to freeze to
[1:53:27] death and they got electric socks and
[1:53:29] they got electric shawls and electric
[1:53:31] ear warmers and electric hats and
[1:53:33] electric electric a lot and it never
[1:53:34] Struck it boom The Smithereens with it
[1:53:36] they're sitting out there and they're
[1:53:38] going to scream and raw raw raw they'll
[1:53:40] paint their face red and green and black
[1:53:42] because they want to look like their
[1:53:43] team and they'll jump up and down the
[1:53:45] snow will be a flying they'll drink hot
[1:53:47] chocolate they'll do everything they can
[1:53:49] why that's their God they love all of
[1:53:52] that and if they looked at us they'd
[1:53:54] think them people's crazy they jump up
[1:53:56] when the preachers preaching and they
[1:53:58] clap their hands and they say hallelujah
[1:54:00] what in the world is a matter of some
[1:54:02] people we're getting a little bit of
[1:54:03] touch from the other side
[1:54:05] amen and we've got something to praise
[1:54:07] him about we've got something to worship
[1:54:09] him about well I've seen if we would
[1:54:11] become a little bit more contagious to
[1:54:13] one another we might rub off on the
[1:54:14] brother that's having a really hard time
[1:54:16] or the sister that's going through a
[1:54:18] little bit of a trial and she come to
[1:54:20] the house of God and God knew that she
[1:54:21] needed a little bit more of a tug than
[1:54:24] maybe what you did you might be
[1:54:25] responsible for helping them through
[1:54:27] that wouldn't that be a wonderful thing
[1:54:28] wouldn't that be a wonderful thing you
[1:54:30] stand before the Lord that day and say
[1:54:32] you know what you didn't know it but
[1:54:34] that day there on Wednesday night there
[1:54:35] on the Holiday Inn and you come in there
[1:54:37] and you just made up your mind I'm going
[1:54:39] to praise him tonight there's three or
[1:54:40] four of my children standing by you and
[1:54:42] they were so weary and they watched you
[1:54:44] raising your hands and it uplifted them
[1:54:46] and you saying I ain't never done
[1:54:48] nothing for the kingdom of God when you
[1:54:50] serve God's bride you serve God
[1:54:53] say an encouraging word say a prayer be
[1:54:56] kind to someone you just help Jesus
[1:55:00] how many of you would like to be in here
[1:55:02] when the Lord Jesus was here and if
[1:55:04] Jesus was carrying that cross wouldn't
[1:55:06] you like to bend like the man that come
[1:55:09] up there and bore his cross wouldn't
[1:55:11] that been wouldn't that been an
[1:55:12] opportunity a privilege in the blood of
[1:55:15] Jesus
[1:55:16] on that cross God on your back and God
[1:55:19] on your face and maybe you're Jesus
[1:55:22] rubbed faces and the blood of Jesus you
[1:55:25] got down off of there and you looked and
[1:55:27] there was the blood of Jesus you said oh
[1:55:29] my Lord
[1:55:30] the blood of Jesus he said oh what an
[1:55:32] honor you'd never want to wash your face
[1:55:34] again you'd never want to wash your
[1:55:35] hands again or if I'd have been there by
[1:55:37] the time I'd love to give him a drink
[1:55:40] you can
[1:55:43] give somebody in his body one
[1:55:46] if you give one of my disciples a drink
[1:55:48] of water
[1:55:49] you ought to know why a solution
[1:55:52] hey we're not talking about just
[1:55:53] preachers don't look out preachers you
[1:55:55] can be kind to
[1:55:57] be kind to anybody in the body
[1:55:59] Paul said especially the household of
[1:56:02] faith
[1:56:03] I like to say kind words to people in
[1:56:05] the Drive-Thru especially when they get
[1:56:07] my order wrong
[1:56:10] which is just about every time
[1:56:13] so I just do what I tell y'all do just
[1:56:15] go and give me what you want to you will
[1:56:17] anyhow
[1:56:18] but you realize a kind word a kind word
[1:56:21] I come through one not long ago and I'd
[1:56:22] ordered whatever it was and I pulled up
[1:56:24] to the window the God said you order so
[1:56:26] and so and so I said no I sure didn't I
[1:56:28] ordered a pumpkin sandwich and I ordered
[1:56:31] I mean I went through a bunch of stuff
[1:56:33] and that guy busted out of life and I'll
[1:56:35] come through there in a couple days and
[1:56:37] he said you want that pumpkin sandwich
[1:56:38] again
[1:56:42] now you see it made him laugh it made
[1:56:44] some of you life and you've been sitting
[1:56:45] the Earth's hours on the water all night
[1:56:46] long
[1:56:47] you never know what a kind word can do
[1:56:50] to somebody

[1:57:33] being able to differentiate
[1:57:36] righteousness
[1:57:38] of being able to rejoice when enemy is
[1:57:42] destroyed
[1:57:43] I would have a hard time separating the
[1:57:46] human feeling toward that
[1:57:49] but I know when we are changed that we
[1:57:52] will be able to participate I believe
[1:57:55] with all of my heart there are people
[1:57:57] here in this place tonight

[2:10:14] when he looked there in heaven
[2:10:16] and John Saul elders and I was thinking
[2:10:19] of some of our elders that are here I
[2:10:22] thought about
