[Applause] [Music] We are often tossed and driven on the restless sea of time. Somber skies and howling tempest officer perfect day. When the mists are rolled away, we will understand it better by and by. Wo by and by when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home and we will tell the story oh how we've overcome for we'll understand it better by and by. There's a message in the evening that the world can't recognize, but it's calling out a people for a rapture in the sky. And we've heard the prophets cry, and we know the reason why. We will understand it better by and by. Wo! By and by, when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home, and we will tell the story, oh, how we've overcome. For we'll understand it better by and by. Now the bride is making ready in the garments he designed. Not with creeds or man's ideas. Just the word that's pure in line. Every promise she believes and she's longing now to leave. For the trumpet soon shall call us to go home. Go by and by when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home and we will tell the story. Oh, how we've overcome. For we'll understand it better by and by. Wo by and by when the morning comes and all the saints of God are gathered home and we will tell the story oh how we've overcome for we'll understand it better by and I [Music] [Applause] I want to say just a little bit about this song. This song that we're going to sing, you've sung it here many, many, many times. The chorus uh the song does have verses to it and the chorus of this song has probably been sung uh along with sister Gerald Deian songs, brother Lo songs just to name a few other people that have written songs around the world. There was an assembly in South Africa that kind of adopted this song and because they didn't have verses to it, they wrote verses. So, we're going to fulfill a promise that was made to some folks that visited here a long long time ago that uh we would sing this song and we'll include the verses so that they can learn it in in their own assembly. So, uh Sister Betty wrote this song how many years ago? &gt;&gt; 40. Should be 50. So, we want we want to sing this song. Can't you see why I'm happy? Are you happy tonight? Are you glad you're happy? Give the Lord a good hand clap of praise this this evening. Amen. I know that the end is nearing and time is growing so sure that God he promised a and promise his word to restore [Music] the reserve [Music] in progress. The bride is believing his word. Her heart has been turned to her father. The voice of God she has heard. Sing this chorus with us. Oh, can't you see why I'm so happy? I accepted the word of the Lord. I reveal a word that was so done by the prophet of God. This world is fighting his promise. The word they've already denied. But God has favored his choice. be elected. This message will find we're waiting for the rapture [Music] to be changed in we call it. will be called up to be our savior will be in this whole world goodbye. Sing with all your heart as you stand. Oh, can't you see why I'm so happy I accepted the word of the Lord that was by the prophet of Mel. Sing that verse again in the chorus. Sing it. Can't you see why I'm so happy? Hallelujah. I accepted the word of the Lord. Oh, the real word that was sp by the prophet of God. The reveal word that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi Lord. [Applause] [Applause] They done good to be old people, didn't they? Except for brother Eric. He's not that old yet. Praise the Lord. I don't know about you, I appreciate having folks that have given their life for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Stable, strong, they do something for me. &gt;&gt; You think, Brother Donnie, you're old yourself. Yeah, I know. But there's people around me that's even older. I mean, look at Brother D, Brother Harvey, and Sister Shirley was in Brother Bram's meetings. That does something for me. &gt;&gt; We've got all these people attacking the message and trying to make the prophet false and make him this and that and the other. Try to convince them. &gt;&gt; Try to convince them of what they saw. &gt;&gt; Get some eyewitnesses of it. You think you'd ever be able to convince Peter, but Jesus wasn't real? One of the brothers here had sent me a little clip the other day of the world's smartest man as far as smart with the highest IQ in the world and scientifically he was taking and proving why the Jesus was still alive. So he took a lot of different things and he was talking about the apostles and how that they gave their life for him and all the different things that that happened. And the end of the equation was that Jesus still had to be alive. After he got into it for just a few minutes, it done lost me, which is apparent mine's pretty low anyway. But I thought, I'm so glad I don't have to have Jesus scientifically proven. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's been proven to you how? By faith. you yourself, hopefully you can see yourself a little plainer uh tonight. Let's read together. Genesis chapter 24 verse 54. And they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tried all night. They rose up in the morning and he said, "Send me away unto my master." And her brother and her mother. Her brother and her mother. Maybe some of you've got a brother like this and a mother like this. her brother and her mother said, "Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at least at the least, at the least 10, and after that she shall go." So they're saying one thing, Elis are saying something else. And he said unto them, "Hinder me not. Seeing the Lord hath prospered my way, send me away that I may go to my master." Now, there's no way that they would have done this in verse 57 if they would have known the conclusion because the conclusion did not give them what they wanted. So, they did not believe Rebecca would ever do what she's fixing to do. And they said, "Fine, we'll call her. We'll call the damsel." And inquired her mouth. And they just knew. Brother JD beyond a shadow of a doubt. To them, there was no question about it. She said going to say, "Well, this is a cult. I ain't following that man." Can you imagine one 16-year-old girl and her nurse Deborah and a few more women whistle and the rest of them men on a journey between 450 and 500 miles which would take them a month night after night. You're encompassed by men you don't even know. They were convinced. They were totally convinced. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, "Wilt thou go with this man?" &gt;&gt; And you said, &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord." We could dismiss and say, "It's been good to be in church already." &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad there was something in you that responded the same way? &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Heather Potter's asking for prayer. Got laded and dizzy and they had to leave the service. Let's uh let's remember them in prayer. And I'm sure others have needs tonight in your body, in your home, whatever it is. Let's just take him before the Lord now. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful for your word and we thank you, Lord Jesus, for all the mighty things that you've done for us. We thank you for the absoluteness of your word and the absoluteness of your character. And it gives us such confidence for us to see how you have dealt with our predecessors and what you've done through them and their lives. And it gives us faith to know that you will do your will in our lives as well. Father, as we endeavor to look further into this beautiful story of the scripture tonight, I pray that you would help us, Lord. You saw the uplifted hands signifying needs, desires, request. Lord, this request of Sister Heather having to take her daughter home tonight. And we pray in the name of Jesus that you just moved for Lord this dizziness may it leave her father we pray. Father, we pray for our sister Clipper tonight, also our brother Steve Newsome, others, Lord, with different needs and things that they're going through in life. And we're just believing you, Father, that you're going to move. And we know the word tells us if God be for us, who can be against us. Speak to us tonight from your word. In the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. You know, I find delay can be such a dangerous thing. But what's amazing about delay is that Satan will try to impersonate us waiting on God for a season and for a time. and he will mimic that. But it's actually him delaying us from something the Lord wants us to do. Now, this girl, I I I hope that the Lord will will let me break it down, maybe take a couple of services and show you that every move she is making, every word he said, every response, all of it is being brought in to show who Rebecca really is. Now, I find it amazing because what they're asking here is something that is out of broken continuity of everything that she has done thus far. What I like to see about people is their repetitive character. Now, every one of us have hiccups in our life and we have breaks in the pattern of our soul. By that I mean that we will go through spots in our life and maybe we're kind of low and we're just going through a spot sometimes you don't even know what it is. Anybody ever been there besides me and you don't even know why you're feeling the way you're feeling and you're just feeling kind of low and sometimes kind of sad and sometimes kind of weary and you can't really put your finger on this or that or the other. You can't really put your hand on nothing that you've done in your life. And yet somehow it just seems kind of odd to you. And during those times, you know, we we may not have the amount of joy that we normally would. And we may not have that smile quite on our face like would normally be there. But I'm so grateful that the Lord doesn't hold those low times against us. Aren't you? I'm glad that he looks at us during those times and and realizes, but that's not really who you are. You will rebound out of that place and you will be exactly what you are continuously over and over again. I imagine it would surprise us if we could have been around the Lord Jesus and saw him as a man that we would have seen sadness in his life. We would have seen oppression and sorrow. As a matter of fact, the Bible says about him in the prophetic utterance of Isaiah that he was a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief. So grief was an acquaintance. It wasn't somebody or something that he saw once every 3 years or once every six months, but it was one that was around him just like constantly there, acquainted with grief, a man of sorrow. Now you're talking about the Lord Jesus. Well, why didn't Isaiah call him a man of joy? a a man of bubbling, a static just rapture all the time. You mean to tell me the Lord Jesus was called a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief? Yeah, he sure was. And no doubt it would have been quite surprising for the people that had in their mind what the Messiah would be. Now, David, you know, we know that David himself was a man of great ecstatic joy. He was a shouter. He was a jumper. He was a dancer, no doubt. He had all types of emotion. He was a songwriter. A lot of times songwriters can be that way. They can be up and down just like this. So there's no medium place for them. And David, whenever he was up, I mean, he was high. Whenever he was riding on top of the mountains, them mountains, it just seemed like he skipped on top of one of another. But when that man got low, he got low. David asks more wise than any other author in the scripture. Study it sometime. Why this? Why that? Why do the people imagine a ma vain thing? Why does the heathen roar? Why this? Why that? Why does the wicked prosper like a green bay tree? Why this? And why that? How long, Lord, will you delay in answering me? A man that we would picture, and I'm afraid we've done it wrongly. a man that we think was constantly shouting, constantly enjoying the blessing of God. I'd say we'd be surprised if we would ever see the real true David. &gt;&gt; I imagine that people that we have made up in our mind and we have got fictitious characters of the way we think they were, but in reality they probably wasn't like that at all. Now, whenever you look at what God was fixing to do for her, now watch how this up to this point, Rebecca has been hastening in every response that she has made. Watch. Hastening this, hastening that, running here, running there, doing this at a rapid rate. And now they are wanting something contrary to what she has been doing all along in the response to this messenger. Now you know it it it has to make me wonder did this messenger did this message change something about her and they thought the methodical behavior that they had seen over and over again about her. Did they think that would be the predominant force that would fall back and this is what she would react by? Now, I want you to notice how that this message and this messenger had done something to her. Watch in in Genesis 24: 18. And she said, "Drink, my Lord." And she &gt;&gt; hasted and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him drink. And when she had done given him drink, she said, "I will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking." and she hasted and emptied her picture into the trough and &gt;&gt; and ran to the well to draw water and drew for all his camels. Notice in verse 28, and the damsel &gt;&gt; ran and told them of her mother's house these things. So notice what the message and the messenger had done to this woman. So it had hastened this, it had hastened that. There must have been a supernatural acceleration that was somewhat above her natural behavior. And then her mother and her brother, who it appears were the spokesman, they felt like they knew her. Well, they probably thought they did. But you see, something had happened to her because an angel had visited her and not them. And it had brought somewhat of a change into her. No doubt they felt like she was more stable than this. And they had brought her up this particular way and no way she was ever going to make a hasty decision. Now, this is a pretty hasty decision. No time to contemplate, no time to pray about it, no time to weigh it out, no time to Google it, as we said before, check all of it out. No way to do any of that at all. And that there's no way that they would have thought she would have responded in this way. But this had already began to develop in her by the supernatural influence of what God had done. I hope somebody's hearing me tonight. Can't you see why that your family and my family and the family of others whenever we begin to hear this word for those of us who were not born in it and raised up in it. And when we begin to hear it that it affected us in such a way that it alarmed our family and alarmed our loved ones and our friends and to them it made us very susceptible to being deceived. So they were quite overwhelmed because they saw us reacting in a way that was somewhat unfamiliar with what they had known us as before. Well, just to be honest with you, if it do if it didn't do that, then really it shouldn't be a message that we should leave one another and follow this one for. If this one don't do more for you than your Baptist church, just stay in your Baptist church. If this message don't do something more for you than the Pentecostal message was in, just stay in Pentecost. You'll be better off cuz you'll probably go back to it anyhow. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But notice there was something about the message and the messenger. Now, what was what was the sum of the message so far that she had heard? Now, it was not doctrine. It was not theology. It was not about many of those things, but it was about people. Listen now. It was about people. So this this servant now he started with the master of the house himself which in the anotype of course was Almighty God. And then he went on down and brought it from the expression of Abraham and typed by Almighty God. And he brings it on down to the expression of his son which was Jesus or in her case Isaac and wives as he be to expound the message and it wasn't dos and don'ts. Now we have no record that he mentions anything about now you got to do this and you got to do that and you got to do this and you got to do that and you can't go here and you can't go there and you can't do this and you can't do that. But if he could get her so attracted to the person of the message itself and let her fall in love with the messenger, then whatever he wanted her to do, there'd be no problem with it from that point on. I'm afraid sometimes that we failed to actually lead people to a place to where they fall so in love with the Lord Jesus that whatever he asks them to do, they just do it. Brother John because they love him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now whenever the messenger then begins to move and in this sequence of events remember it's unfolding supernaturally and we know that the Bible I love the way the prophet says this that that the Bible actually condenses its truths. So there can be so much compacted in three or four verses that categorically in history there would be so much that if it were all written and laid out it would be phenomenal how much would be there. But we know truly that the Bible does condense its truth. So was this everything that was said or did Moses just capture the highlights of the conversation? But no doubt the stream of what was going to be projected to her and the conjecture of what he wanted her to get was not about himself. So he never bragged about himself. I want you to see how much the master trusted me because I am the oldest of the master's servants and the master gave me this and the master gave me that and the master trusted me with this and trusted me with that. I imagine that certainly she wanted to know. But to her, I I I just can't keep from believing that that him being there was all of that that he had spoke well enough of his own character that she didn't need to hear a sermon every night on the messenger himself. &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me. I I realize a lot of folks in the message, they'd rather hear the messenger preach than they would what the message is all about, the Lord Jesus. But I'm here to tell you tonight, this night's not going to be about your pastor. This night is not going to be just us focusing on God's prophet. It's not going to be focusing on Elijah or or Jeremiah. But I want to point you tonight to who this is really all about. It's about the Lord Jesus and you. Is that all right with you? &gt;&gt; So notice how the the methodical pattern of Rebecca is now running true to form. That doesn't say, of course, that she didn't have something about this before and it must have been something that was laying there. But you know from getting of the picture that we're able to even get about people like Noah, the prophet said that Noah was a man that had no certain desire, no certain ambition really to do anything. It wasn't like he wanted to be a great renowned worldshaking person and thinking I'm going to build a boat and I'm going to be the only man on the earth. I'm going to make history from this point on. I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that. He was just a farmer just raising his crops. Happy to be alive. Happy to be, you know, knowing what he did about God and the mercy of God. But God did something to Noah and raised something up out of Noah that was laying in him in seed form that had been hidden under the mass of a farmer's life. And God didn't even call him and said, "Now tell what I want you to do. I want you to raise these great big gigantic massive vegetables and I want you to climb up on top of a watermelon and you're going to sail the water on top of watermelon. Give a giraffe a cantaloupe and give everybody else a squash and green peppers and all that. God called the man totally out of his line of profession. And his vocation was not building. his vocation. We don't even know if the man could even hang a plum door or not until God called him and God changed him and absolutely went contrary to that which he felt comfortable in doing. That's a God called man. I said that's a God called man. You imagine he could have give all kinds of excuses. But yet think about it now that God can has the ability of bringing things out in people and it will totally shock and surprise those many times who knows it. Now those who have great capacities on their own and then the call of God what they think is the call of God and then they say here God I'll do it. I'll do it and then they want to present what they are so they've got a great mind and they can be able to take the scriptures and put it together. My really impressed people, nine times out of 10 that individual never has been called of God, never will be. But God will call somebody that looking at them and they'll say, "Nope, there ain't no man in the world. That fell never mount to hill of beans." That old boy, I'll tell you one thing, you know, he'll never amount to nothing. And God says, "That's my man." And the one that people say, "Now, Lord, pick this guy. Pick that guy. Pick that woman. Pick that woman there." that God will say, "Nope, I don't want nothing new as them because if I use them, all they're going to be is a stuffed shirt. That's all they're going to be, a stuffed shirt. I don't want to be a stuffed shirt, but I do want to have a stuffed heart. I want my heart to be stuffed full of the goodness and the mercy and the power of God." So, notice what they ask Rebecca now to do. So they're asking her to behave in a a way contrary to the way of what the message has done for her already. Now whether or not she acted like this before or not, we really don't know. But by them asking the question that they did, as I said, there's no way they would have believed her response would have been this way. They would have never asked her. They would have asked something in the way that they thought, well, she herself, we know her. if we look at her the right way, she's going to say no. Well, no doubt they both looked at her the right way and she didn't say no. So, whatever it was that they expected about her turned out totally different and the spirit of God had already moved upon her heart against all reasoning. Now, it would have seemed sensible. They're never going to see her again. Think of this now. They will never see her again. Her mother never saw her. Her brother never saw her. Her nieces, nephews, if they had any. Nobody of her family ever saw her again. So, she's met this man the day before and the next day she's heading out on a month-long journey to only God knows where if this man is even true and reputable or not. So, in one sense of the word, you could have see why they would have not been asking too much. But in another sense of the word, they were asking too much because what they asked for was simply contrary to what the messenger said. Now, had the messenger said, "Well, I'll tell you what. All right. Now, this has gone really good. So, what I'm going to do is we're just going to kind of hang around here for about a week, 10 days, something like that. We're going to let you go out and say goodbye to all the school kids that you knew. we're going to let you say goodbye to these and this and that and that and you can have, you know, two or three different gatherings together with your family. And we understand that. We we understand that. But somehow the messenger must have had an insight that delay would have actually affected the cause of God. Now had he said it's fine for us to delay and then they would have said delay that would have been no problem. Now her first trial comes whenever the messenger says one thing but her family says something different. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how many people around the message that's been around for 30 years still ain't learned what Rebecca learned after following the messenger only one day. But somehow another did she understand it? Now notice, I don't want us to make a superhuman woman out of Rebecca. There's no way that Rebecca had the faith of Abraham without her being tried in a similar way that Abraham was. So she could believe things that were not as though they were. So I believe myself that Rebecca was tried on this journey. I don't believe it was a pleasant journey. I don't believe that everything on the journey maybe went to her expectation. It would have been unlike the family she was going to marry into. For her to have had everything under her expectation on the journey would have been a great contrast to the way God dealt with Abraham and Isaac. So she is going to be a perfect match for the family of Abraham. Remember the requirement was to Eleazar, I want you to go find a bride for my son of my people. Now he's not just talking about his own flesh and blood. He is that. But he's wanting someone, a daughter that will be of his own kind, of his own nature. What? A daughter of faith. Not just a daughter of the same bloodline, but a daughter of faith. Now, whenever Eleazar has a month to make this journey, he's praying. He's thinking about it. God, give me the right questions. Give me the right things so I'm going to find the right bloodline. Yes, but Lord God, give me the right things to ask her so I can know she will be a perfect fit into the family of faith. Well, I don't mind telling you tonight there's all kinds of Christians around the world, but a lot of them do not fit in the real bride family of faith. They don't. They make good nominal Christians. They make good, you know, churchgoing people, and the Lord is the one to judge, all that sort of thing. But I'll tell you, it takes a really selected class, the better of their class like the Rebecca type that is able to answer in respond to the promised word. and they have something in them by the influence of the angels of God. I'm going to go ahead and tell you tonight, before you ever even knew about it, God made a deposit down inside of your soul. And there ain't enough devils out of hell to stop you from making that journey. I don't care what the devil does. I don't care what people do. You can be so hurt by preachers and hurt by people and everything else and it may tear your heart out of you. But I'll tell you what, it will never move that seed in your soul because it is an immovable part of the immovable almighty God. It ain't you. It ain't your determination. It ain't your desire. It's a deposit of himself that's given to his elect only. And the church said, Oh my. So, they're trying to do what? Delay. Oh, listen to me. Delay can be such a dangerous thing. When a person is being caught in the influence of an individual, whether it's a friend, whether it's a a a relative, whatever it is, and that influence is pulling them in a direction that they know is contrary to the word, and they keep putting it off and putting it off and putting it off to break away from that person. Look at the danger. Look at what they're flirting with. Now watch what the prophet said here in desperations. He said Rebecca the beautiful maid came and watered the camel and then said don't delay me in my way. She had to come to a time of decision whether she would go. She was a type of the bride. Notice Rebecca does not type the foolish virgin. &gt;&gt; Amen. So foolish virgin will never be able to relate to Rebecca type by type by type by type by type. They may pick certain things but only the bride can answer be the antitype of Rebecca. She was a type of the bride. Would she go and marry a man who she has never seen? Oh my. Now that's a great thing. Never even seen him. Yet she had only heard by his servant. Now look at the way God does this. That's the type of the bride. You've never seen Christ. Oh hallelujah. But you hear, notice now, but you hear by his servants what he is. So most of us have never seen the corporal body of the Lord Jesus. He personally never come put his arms around us and appeared to us in a vision and we saw him and we fell in love with him. But how did we start falling in love with him? By servants, people telling us. Some of you got started in a Baptist church, maybe some of you in a Methodist, some of you in a Pentecost, or some of you in a message. So, who knows where it was? But something moved upon your heart and you begin to hear about him and it started making a drawing power between you and him. And then the more you begin to hear about him, then you begin to fall more in love. Now, the more anointed the servant is and the greater gift in the servant's life, the more he can get out of the way, the more that he can project Jesus to you and it helps you fall in love with him more. And the church said, "That's the kind of preachers I like to listen to. I like to listen to them and they get so out of the way." You can still see the human element there, of course, but they get so much out of the way and they project the Lord Jesus as being so great that you just feel like you could reach out and touch him. A man's already done what he's supposed to do when he can do that. Now, notice what is it? You sell out everything. You leave your homes, everything else it takes to go find him. Now notice and she made the decision type of the bride letter left her denominational home. Oh my. Okay. So Laban and his mother and that system there that they were in were typified. The prophet of God types them like a denomination. Now, we remember years later whenever Jacob comes back and he's going to leave out and remember and one of his wives, Rachel goes and what does she do? She gets the gods out of her father's house, &gt;&gt; this same Laban right here. So, he was a heathen, &gt;&gt; an idoltor. &gt;&gt; He believed in the trinity at least. So Rachel steals her father's gods. So Rebecca was delivered out of this denominational home. Then some of you tell me that God's given you a husband or a wife that's a denominational. I want to know where what are you people drinking? &gt;&gt; What are you eating? You sure ain't hearing to what your pastor's preaching. [Music] So God loved Harry out of a denomination and lead some of you back and you young men going into these denominational churches to find yourself a wife or you sister to find yourself a denominational man. What in the world's matter with you? &gt;&gt; Are you out of your mind? &gt;&gt; Boy, it's getting hot in here ain't it? Man, a lot. Now notice that God called her out of that denominational system. What's amazing is now that denominational system was her family. &gt;&gt; Her family was the denominational system. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, preach it, Brother Donnie. I'm with you, Brother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now look how dangerous it could have been. I I know you don't you stand there thinking well what difference would it have made? But you see if she would have delayed I I know it's phenomenal really how that the exposure of truth can counteract once you've walked into light. People they they don't make any sense out of it. But actually after she had been exposed to this truth and then had she delayed and waited and answered the wrong thing. I hope you understand where I'm going to go with this now. Had she said, "I will stay." Do you understand what Eleazar would have done? Left &gt;&gt; and left her there. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, &gt;&gt; each answer, each response. Can you imagine? She could have done everything right up to the last answer. &gt;&gt; She could have quit cutting her hair as we say, and cleaned out her closet and done this and done that and done that. This This Oh, children, listen. This answer is the final decision. Rebecca, what are you going to say? Oh, if she would have said, "Oh, what? My mama wants me to stay here. I I'm stay. And if you ain't willing to stay, "Well, I guess I'm not willing to go with you." Then that would have let him know then you are not worthy of my master. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Happy Valley, Word of Life, Mendon Church, whatever your church is, if we are coming down and we serve him for 30 years and then he keeps asking questions and asking questions. Don't you see what he's doing? Do you still love me now? Are you still going to serve me? I took your husband. I took your wife. I took your son. I took your daughter. What are you going to do now, Lance? He's waiting for an answer. He's waits for an answer. Brother Jim, what will be our answer? Word of life. I will go. &gt;&gt; Amen. I will go. I'll have nothing to go back to. Can you imagine as he stands there nervously waiting and they ask the maid, "Will you go with this man?" No. How does in a derogatory tone this great messenger from God? Oh, no. Nothing complimentary like that. Will you go to your fame and fortune? Will you go to this great position of predestination? No. Notice what they done. They totally twisted it right back around now. Will you go with this man? &gt;&gt; Rebecca, answer carefully. Your whole destiny lays on this. I will go or I won't go. Only one word difference. Will or won't. &gt;&gt; Wow, that's close, ain't it? Now, delaying, as I said, isn't the same as waiting, but they can seem similar where people are directed by the Lord to wait and wait for an answer and wait patiently, sometimes for healing, sometimes for a move of God. Isaiah 40 and verse 31. But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. But to apply this verse of scripture had it been written to her answer would have been misapplying the word and taking the word out of context. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and caused her to miss the entire will of God by misquing scripture &gt;&gt; and misplacing it. &gt;&gt; It's astounding statement that the prophet tells us the word of the Lord is not always always the will of the Lord because you have to place the word of the Lord in its right place &gt;&gt; or it's not the will of God. &gt;&gt; So they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up as wings as eagles. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. But this was not the time to wait. Why, brother Donnie? Because the messenger never told her to wait. The messenger said, "It's urgent. The rapture's coming. &gt;&gt; The rapture's coming." &gt;&gt; Oh, you say rapture? Yeah. She was fixing to be caught up on the back of a great big power. &gt;&gt; An animal in the Bible represented power. And she's fixing to be caught up. She may never rode a camel in her life, but she's fixing to be raised up into a higher place than she'd ever been before. And she's going to ride up in this higher place. Oh, glory to God. Until she meets her bridegroom. Praise the Lord. So, it's not the time to wait. It's the time to pack up. I want you to notice here the prophet again whenever he's referring to Saul, he said, "But then when Saul wouldn't wait on the Lord no more, Samuel turned right away from him." Listen how serious this is. Remember the first time, not the second time, but the first time that Saul took upon himself to take over the service of the Lord, Samuel turned his back on him and walked away from him. And the first time that the church lets their leaders take over to lead the people, the Holy Spirit gets right away from them. the first time the church lets their leaders. Can't you see friends why God is so against a denominational move? I ain't talking about the people inside of there. I'm talking about the hierarchy and what they do. God don't want men directing his church. Well, I now we know the Bible said that, but I this is what the board thinks and this is what they told me up at headquarter. God don't want his church run by that. He wants his church run by men filled with the Holy Ghost that will never leave that word. &gt;&gt; That's right. They would die before they would compromise in the word. Don't you see that very simple thing is the very reason God left every denomination when they voted and decided we're going to have a board here. We're going to call the church this and that and that and you can't do this and you can go there. As soon as they done it, God left them right there. They may have shouted and jumped for years and years, but the presence of God as far as his omnipotence pulled away from them, Lord God have mercy. Don't you understand? has done the same thing around the message moves. The message moves when they want to hear what a man's got to say. Well, brother so and so says this this way. And brother so and so, don't you understand the spirit of God does the same thing? I pray I hope and pray he never leaves our church. I hope and pray he's always welcome here because we want him to lead us and guide us. Not me, not the rest of these preacher brothers. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh my. &gt;&gt; The very first time you go being led by man instead of God, the Holy Spirit will get away from you, too. Let the Holy Spirit lead. That's what we need as leadership. God gave us a leader and we don't hear it. Oh my. So what was Saul supposed to do? Wait on Samuel the prophet. And he waited and waited. And Samuel didn't come when he thought. What did he do? Run ahead of God instead of waiting on the Lord. But say, "Oh my goodness, Rebecca, maybe you should wait. Maybe you should wait." It wasn't time to wait. &gt;&gt; It was time to leave. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice again, he's trying to do God a service. I've been pretty rough this morning, but see, they that are are on the Lord wait on the Lord and they're waiting. And when they do, they see the promise of today being vindicated and it renews their faith. But see, this is what Satan tries to do. He's so tricky that he mimics God. And he will try to get us to delay. Oh my. and convincing us that we're waiting on the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm just waiting &gt;&gt; on what? How long some of y'all been waiting for the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; What are you waiting on? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Johnny, I'm waiting on God. And God's waiting on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All I'm waiting on to get closer to God. I I'll tell you one thing. Sunday morning, boy, I'm going to get in service. I'm going to come in. I made up my mind. I'm going to get in. I'm going to clap my hand. But why wait till Sunday morning? This might be your last service. &gt;&gt; You're waiting and waiting and waiting on what? What's Satan doing? You're well just waiting on God. No, you're not. And many of these things you're delaying. &gt;&gt; Some of you shed broke ties with some of the people that's waited you down for years and years and you're waiting till you feel led. Feel led. Nothing. Look at the attributes of what they're doing to you. And you're seeing what you're doing. You're not waiting on God. You're delaying. Moses delayed circumcising his son &gt;&gt; and God went looking for him to kill him. &gt;&gt; God found him at the end and God would have killed him &gt;&gt; because he committed adultery to somebody else's wife because he delayed circumcising his own son. So, it's a preacher preaching circumcision to everybody else and didn't circumcise his own son. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "My my want to amen this part." You see, I'm called to preach the whole message. &gt;&gt; I remember the flood coming on. They rushed her out to the government depot out there for the hospital. That part of the night, it raining, twisting, blowing, always mine, God. No matter what it is, &gt;&gt; God says for you to do. And I tell you today that God in heaven who looks down upon me standing in this platform will forgive me. I know that many thousands of souls I will have to answer for it that day for listening to somebody else instead of God. Now I know people have said it for years and years. Say what the prophet said. Say what the tape say. Uhhuh. That's what I just said. How come some of y'all ain't saying amen? &gt;&gt; Why do people always get quiet when you read this? This is why I can follow this man right here cuz he told us this about himself. &gt;&gt; He tells us in another life story was the worst mistake he ever made in his life cuz he listened to his mother-in-law instead of listening to God. &gt;&gt; So he delayed delayed that delay cost him his wife. It cost him his baby. I got to be honest with you. I don't understand how all this works. Okay? He says that that day, Brother Dal, he's going to stand before God and answer for thousands of souls. How would you like to have that on your slate? But this is what I love about a man of God like this that can tell us his deepest faults and still rise above them. Oh, brother Josiah and say, "I will not let that keep me down." &gt;&gt; How could you stand before people and preach to them and knowing that this you have to answer for? How would it not make you so low and so despondent that you think, "Why should I even try?" &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Because God had his number. &gt;&gt; And the same God's got yours. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he won't let go. Oh, you say, "I've got a hold of him." Baloney. You ain't got a hold of nothing. You've let go. I ain't no telling how many times. It wasn't that you had a hold to God. God got a hold to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus got a hold to my life and he won't let me go. There's probably been times we would have let go. and no doubt troubles and trials. We would have turned loose. But thank God when I would have turned loose, it wasn't me. My hand might have done this. But the great power is this. I had a hold of him. All right. But whenever I would have turned loose this way, he said, "I got you, Peter. I got you, Peter. You're going down, but I've got you. I've got you, Donnie. I've got you, J. D. I've got you, Carol. I've got you, Barbara. I've got you, children. I won't let you go. [Applause] Lord Jesus. I walked away and I went down and she looked at me. Hope did. And she said, "Bill, that's my mother, but I will go with you." And I said, God bless her heart. She said, "I will go with you." And I said, 'Honey, I I said, I I guess I'm carrying water on both shoulders and but I said, I I I don't want to hurt her feelings. &gt;&gt; And I said, what if something would happen to her and then you'd be worried all your life? You broke your mother's heart. And I said, "Maybe, maybe we'll just put it off a little while." So, Brother Brandham put off a little while going out on the field, preaching, reaching to the Pentecostals. put it off for a little while. Or you said, "But I'm bright. I'm I'm bright. I I'll be good. Even if I do mess up, God will fix it." &gt;&gt; So that's what you think about election. That we could inadvertently walk right over the top of God's word and God will let you get by with it. &gt;&gt; God's prophet walked right over the top of it, but he did not get by with it. He paid a tremendous price. As a matter of fact, in Christ mystery of God revealed, when he come back in there, he said, "Every time I come back in the valley, talking about Jeffersonville, he said, "It gets sparred. It's just dark and spooky." And he said, "He still makes it tough on me, hard on me when I come back in here cuz I didn't go out the first time. &gt;&gt; He's still paying." &gt;&gt; 30 something years later. Will you go, Rebecca? Or will you say, "Well, right now is actually not a good time for me. &gt;&gt; Really? I you know, I mean, I I I definitely going, okay, don't don't write me off, God. I mean, I'm definitely going, but I've just got some things I need to take care of. I'm just, you know, I I'm trying to I'm trying to win this man to the Lord and I'm trying to win this woman to the Lord. And I know I really shouldn't be as close friends as I am to some of these early kids that I am, but I'm trying to shine my light. &gt;&gt; And how is that working for you? &gt;&gt; So, while you're shining your light, who's compromised? Them or you? That's what I find whenever believers go to Dayton or or court and whatever you want to call it, unbelievers. Well, the first one who compromised with that believer in the word compromise by going with somebody that don't even believe the promised word of the hour. &gt;&gt; And who does the most compromising? They do. &gt;&gt; You know what the sad part about it is? Them denominational people and this that and the other, they don't really give up nothing of what they believe. They still believe the same thing did when you started fooling with them. But you're the one that give up this and that and the other. And the devil's laughing at you while you're doing it. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm right, brother Donnie. I'm bright. It'll be all right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Maybe we'll just put it off a little while." And friends, there's where I made the worst step I ever made in my life. Right there. We put it off. About a few weeks after that, things begin to happen. The flood come on later from that. The first thing you know, my wife got sick. Billy got sick during that wrong. Right after that, the little girl just 11 months difference between Billy and his little sister, which was Sharon Rose. Notice in Zurich, Switzerland, telling the same story. Now, from here, listen, I I listen to my mother-in-law instead of God. and forsaken the church and went on back with the Baptist people. &gt;&gt; So you see, it wasn't brother Brandham's mother-in-law that compromised. It was brother Brandham. So he did it to keep from hurting her feelings. &gt;&gt; Come on, gentlemen. Don't get quiet on me. &gt;&gt; It's okay if I read these quotes, right? I mean, if we're going to press play, let's press this one, too. &gt;&gt; These quotes are here for a reason. &gt;&gt; They're here to teach us you can't do wrong and get by with it. &gt;&gt; So, God was calling Brother Brandham to move into the to the light of that day, which was the Pentecostal move. But of course, his mother-in-law called him all kinds of names and this and that and the other trash and whatever more. You know, it brother Ram doesn't say that he actually called them that. But when he's going down the river and heading toward the dam and his boat won't start. He's cranking and cranking and cranking. God have mercy. Don't let me go over that. And he said the spirit of God said to him, "What about them people you call trash?" I've never actually found where he said that he called him, &gt;&gt; but his mother-in-law did and he compromised with her. &gt;&gt; So if people call your church a cult and you don't call it a church, but yeah, you compromise with them, I wonder if God identifies you in the same way going down the river. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Woo! Oh my. Oh. And forsaken the church and went right on back with the Baptist people right away. Plagues hit my home. &gt;&gt; My wife took sick. My father died on my arm. My brother was killed. And everything happened just in a few days. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Children, don't delay. God's dealing with your heart with a closer walk. Don't you delay. God dealing with you. Separate yourself from this man, this woman, these kids, this this this. They're negatively affecting you. Oh, I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm delaying. I'm delaying. You better be careful. God dealing with your heart and you know within yourself that these people aren't productive for your life before God. There's preachers I've had to pull away from through the years. I don't want to do it. But if I've got to do it, I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen? &gt;&gt; I had to pull away from my own family. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My mama, my daddy, most of my siblings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a very terrible feeling to have to be done that way. &gt;&gt; But I do it again. A I heard the cry &gt;&gt; and my response was what was important. I will go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My mama didn't go but I went anyhow. My daddy didn't go but I went anyhow. Amen. My cousins didn't go. My aunts, my uncles didn't go. They talked about me. They run me down and still do. that I made up my mind by the grace of God because I heard the message from a messenger and it did not make me fall in love with the messenger so much, but it presented Jesus Christ to me in a way that I'd never heard him before. I loved him, but I never loved him like I did after I heard the message about him. [Applause] Oh my. Notice this in this sermon. Look at the title here. 1959, a time of decision. Remember, she had to choose by faith. &gt;&gt; She had never seen the man. She had to choose by faith and the words of a servant. That's the same way you'll have to do cuz that's the only way there is to do it. God sends out his &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean it's not singular? &gt;&gt; And &gt;&gt; they preach the word &gt;&gt; and faith cometh by hearing. And what do you think about it? That's up to you to make your choice. I would advise you not to put it off. You say, "Well, I've always longed to receive the Holy Spirit. I better think it over. Don't think it over. This is the time. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It's the truth. I believe that God would heal me someday. As long as you keep that in your mind, &gt;&gt; you're a defeated person. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I believe that God would heal me someday. And we'd hear people say that. We say, "Man, what a statement of faith." That ain't what Elijah called it. He said, "That person's defeated." &gt;&gt; Think of it. Why? Because their faith is being delayed until someday. Oh, Brother Donnie, I prayed and I've come up time after time for the Holy Ghost, and it discourages me. Well, what am I supposed to do? You're supposed to believe God and take God at his word and remind him of his promises to you and your children and them that are far off. I don't have to wait till I get perfect, my Lord. Children, if you're going to wait till you get absolutely perfect, what in you need the Holy Ghost for? But you give God everything that you are, and he endus you with power from on high, and he will finish up what you can't do. &gt;&gt; Some of you let the devil destroy you because you are delaying your progress with God. I believe that God would heal me someday. As long as you keep that in your mind, you're a defeated person. God healed you 1900 years ago. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the day of your decision. When you hear the message that Christ was wounded for your transgressions, with his stripes, you're healed. This is the time now to believe it. You have to make other decisions before you get married. You have to decide on what girl you're going to make your wife. You women have to decide on what man's going to be your husband. You better not put it off too long. He might change his mind. &gt;&gt; Listen to this sad story. Like the woman was here some time ago and she had two men. They were both good men and she couldn't make up her mind which one she's going to marry and she lost them both. God wants &gt;&gt; or brother Donnie, when's the next youth service? Because I'm waiting for the next youth service to get on fire with God. &gt;&gt; If I was you, I wouldn't wait another night. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you one thing, honey. If you want to come in here seven nights a week, I'll make sure these church doors is open and you can hit this altar right here and let the revival start inside of you. Don't wait for some youth preacher from Ohio, one from Louisiana, one from Mississippi, or here, there, or there. Why not waiting for a preacher with a briefcase? Why don't we just say, "God, let it start tonight, right now." Why wait till Sunday? Lord God, let it start. This is my time. I will go. I want a move of God. I want healing. I want deliverance. I want the Holy Ghost. I want a stirring God. Why do I have to wait till Sunday? &gt;&gt; God wants immediate action. If you love him, throw everything else aside and take him. If you believe his word, cast everything else away and take his word. It's a time of decision. You have to make up your mind. &gt;&gt; I thought this quote was astounding. and souls in prison. If you've got any darkness on your life, won't you come right here around the altar now while we continue to sing right now? Is there a worry? Is there a spot? Don't put it off any longer. Now, he's now making an altar call for the lost, but for Christians that have a darkness in their life or even a spot. A spot. A spot. Don't put it off any longer. Notice again Genesis 24:56. And we'll close him momentarily. And he said unto them, "Hender me not, seeing that the Lord," I want you to notice the word Lord here. It's not capital L and small O and small R and small D. It's capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D, and it's not plural. Wonder how this old boy knew this since he himself was a gentile. Remember, he was from Damascus, Syria. Hallelujah. And he said unto them, "Hender me not, seeing the Lord has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master." And they said, "We will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth." No doubt they had all types of excuses and arguments of why she could not go and the longer she would have stayed around them as a human being. Don't make Rebecca now a superhum. You know what this shows me? It shows me even predestinated seed even elect of God can become influenced by your family or by your friends if you stay around them too long in a negative way. and they said, "Well, now pray about this and pray about this." You know, I heard somebody that got caught up in that random stuff and they run off and done this and that and the other and you know, you better be careful going over at that church. I've heard all kinds of things about them people. Well, you probably have, but that don't mean most of them is even the truth. But what do they do? They delay and they delay. Now, I'm warning you, honey, just be really careful. Just so little questions of doubt in their mind. You know, you got to be really careful and we have to really pray about this. just go on a 30-day fast and let's just wait about it. What did he say? We put it before the Lord and then we'll kind of see what's going. He said, "Don't you delay me. I need to get her and get out of here." And they can say, "Now, honey, that's the first sign of a cult. That's the first sign of a cult." Notice he's trying to separate you away from your family and they're they're already pulling you off now. We're noticing you. You're going over to their special Sunday evening things and you're getting away from us. Oh, darling, we're so worried about you. We're so concerned about you, honey. Do they drink red Kool-Aid? Well, no, but the preacher drinks red Gatorade and orange Gatorade and purple Gatorade. But I've noticed he's the only one drinking it. But it must be okay. Yeah, it is okay. Well, I'm I'm just concerned about you because they believe really strange things. We do. We believe there's only one God. And we believe we should be baptized in his name. We believe that one God came down upon the earth in the form of human flesh and gave his life to redeem us. We believe that one God ordained his people before the foundation of the world. We believe that one God has sent men on the earth called prophets. Come on, somebody. We don't believe hell is eternal, but we do believe that we are. Hallelujah. Oh, Brother Donnie. Oh my. That that's really messed up, Brother Donnie. Are are you saying that that you think you're the only one? No, I ain't saying I'm the only one, but I'm just part of the only one. Well, it sounds like you say only the message people is going up. Oh, that's exactly what I do believe. But I don't believe we're the only ones going to be on the finale of it all. But this is a wedding and this is a wedding procession and only those that are invited get to go. Oh, thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, darling, please consider we just met this man yesterday. Now, does not the Bible say there'll be false prophets in the last day? Well, let me just tell you something right now. If William Bradam was a false prophet and more supernatural followed his ministry than any other prophets in the Bible and the devil had a greater false prophet than God had a true prophet, maybe we should switch sides. I heard of brother Random's name for years in Pentecost. Didn't know that much about him. I was sitting in a radio room one day making intros and promos for radio broadcasts. My voice was the beginning voice. Hello, we greet you here. Welcome to so and so and so and so. And then I would make announcements and then I would play 10 to 11 minute portion of a sermon. So that was the intro. Then I'd do the sermon part. Then I would do the outro. So one day when I was sitting in this radio room, I seen some books up here above my head on a bookshelf. So while the sermon was being recorded to send out to these radio stations, I just happened to reach up and pull one of them books down. Ah, sermon by the name of William Mary and Brandham. Well, it just so happened that the man that I was working with and working for at the time, his theme song was he was more than a man as he walked along the shores of Galilee. He healed the sick and he raised the dead and set all the captives free. Oh, I heard him preach it many a time. He was just a man till he stepped when he stepped up on the bow of the ship. He was a man when they woke him up. He was a man laying on the back of the ship as he rubbed his eyes. But when he spoke the word, he was more than a man. I thought, "Where in the world did he get that out?" I found out. I went and heard another man preach on the kinsman redeemer Ruth and Boaz. I sat there and slobbered like a horse eating clover and a new pastor. I thought, "Where in the world did they get that at?" I hear a man down in Kentucky preach this and preach that. I think, man alive, I read the same Bible they read. I don't get that. Oh, but I found out one day, brother Aaron, where they was getting all them little nuggets, it was bride food. Hallelujah. It was bride food. And boy, when I come to the message, all them preachers set a big distance between me and them because they knew I was going to tell where they got their stuff. &gt;&gt; They knew I was going to tell it. I didn't have any more sense but to get up and not only just hide it but you know just preach it and borrow a prophet's word but I got up and started reading it from where they got it from &gt;&gt; but they all wanted his anointing. &gt;&gt; Oh they all wanted his gift. &gt;&gt; And it's something how different we are from that. We don't want his anointing. We don't want his gift. We want his God. &gt;&gt; Right? We want his God. That that's that's what I want. We want his God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't just a great depths of theology. But one thing that got me was the way he talked to the Lord Jesus in prayer and just the way he addressed him. I'd never heard anybody talk to him that way. And it just made me so hunger to know him in the same way that the messenger did, his master. Well, let me say this to you. I will never know him in the same way this prophet messenger knew him. But I sure know him a lot better than I did. &gt;&gt; And now I can relate to him in a way that I never did before. Why? The messenger and the message and my response. So the prophet and the spirit and the bride all saying the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Me and Brother Daryl was talking about before I come out, let me close. Brother Daryl said he noticed here the other night whenever I was preaching that Rebecca already had a voice. So Eleazar said his voice. Abraham gave his voice, Isaac gave his voice. And after she heard Eleazar's voice, her mother and brother had a voice. &gt;&gt; Now it's Rebecca's time to have a voice. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What' she say? I will go. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, bride. The spirit and the bride say come. Let him that is the thirst say come. And the final voice to the final age will be who in the bride. &gt;&gt; And what are you going to say bride? I will go. If my mother don't go, won't hinder me. If my mother don't go, come on, brothers. Oh, won't hinder me. If my mother don't go, won't hinder me. I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Well, I'm on my way to Isa. I'm on my way to Isaac 10. I'm on my way to Isaac, my Lord. I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. If my brother don't go, won't hinder me. If labor don't go, won't hinder me. If labor don't go, won't hinder me. Cuz I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Everybody now. Oh. Are you on your way to Canaan's land? Are you on your way to Canaan's land? Well, I'm on my way. Yes, I am the Canaan land. Thank ain't God. Well, I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Well, I won't turn back cuz I'm on my way. No, I won't turn back. Cuz I'm on my way. Well, I won't turn back cuz I'm on my way. Thank God I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my way. Notice now. Well, I won't delay cuz I'm on my way. [Music] No, I won't delay. Getting the Holy Ghost or getting the healing. I'm on my way, glory. Oh, well, I won't be late cuz I'm on my way. Get out of my way. Devil, sickness, trouble, heartache, anxiety. Well, I'm on my way. Praise God. Yes, I am. Everybody all together now. Well, I'm on my way. Can Come on, children. Let's put our hands together. Let's just worship the Lord. Oh, praise God. I don't feel like it, Brother Donnie. I don't feel like it either, but I'm going to do it anyhow. I don't feel one lick of the spirit of God. I feel no anointing. I feel no chills, but I'm going to worship him. Hallelujah. Well, praise God. I'm on my way. If my family don't go, it won't hinder me. If my family don't go, it won't hinder me. Thank God. If the family don't go hinder me. Praise God. Is on my way. I'm on my way. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We love you, Lord Jesus. Praise be to God. Oh friends, how many people will wind up lost that never intended on going to hell? They had such great intentions. They was going to be saved. Oh yeah, I'm going to do it. Absolutely. That's my plans. I'm going to do it. I'm I'm not going to be lost. I'm not going going to hell. I I plan on going. Yes, absolutely. And they just wait and wait for what they think is the opportune time. and Satan tricks them and takes their life out before they ever get a chance. Or they get more deluded and deluded in darkness as they go and they finally get to a place they just send away their day of grace. &gt;&gt; And then they don't even want to be saved no more. &gt;&gt; But the question is, will you go? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let let me just set you straight tonight in case you're wondering. I don't think we're the only ones going, but I do think we're a part of a group that's going to go first. &gt;&gt; There'll be all kinds that'll come later. &gt;&gt; But this group goes first. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the bridal party. &gt;&gt; The bridal party. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Can we just bow our heads together? Let's just pray if you would like to be remembered tonight. You don't want nothing to hinder you. Men, women, boys, girls, adults, children, you don't want nothing to hinder your life. And if you've been slothful and lazy, can you imagine if Rebecca would have just sat there with her legs crossed and she wouldn't have said, "I'll get this and I'll do that and I'll do that." That would have totally disqualified her from being Isaac's wife. Every move was judging her character. our moves in church, our moves out of church. God's judging us, our character. We want our best, don't we? Every time we come to the house of God, we ought to give our very best to the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Lord Jesus, as we have our heads bowed once again, Father, dear God, I pray that you'd begin with me and search my heart this very night, Lord. See if you see any delay in me in any way, Lord, that hinders my walk or hinders this church. I know there's such a delicate balance in waiting on you and delaying. And people who are procrastinators by nature, if they're not careful, they'll bring that same nature and they will try to serve God in that procrastinating nature. So they procrastinate and procrastinate and procrastinate. Then other people who are always speedy, hasty, rush, do this, do that. They'll try to bring their same nature and serve God with that. It ain't no wonder we get in such messes. &gt;&gt; When the truth of it is you want us to serve you according to your requirement, not according to our human nature. So in certain times you want us to wait and in certain times you don't want us to delay and it may never be the same thing and even the same day. So basically what you're asking for is a people who will follow you. So at certain times we will delay and at other times there's no time for delay. At certain times we will wait and wait and wait and we will renew our strength. At other times if we wait we will lose our strength, our joy. We will lose so much because we waited instead of moving. If Rebecca would have said one word different, I won't go. Her destiny would have been totally different. She would not have been the mother of millions. She would not have been one of the great women of the Bible. She would have faded back into Mesopotamian life, married some local farmer, whatever more, disappeared out of the pages of the Bible. But oh Lord, she said the right words just like Hetty Wright did that day. That ain't nothing but the truth. Help us Lord Jesus. Oh Jesus, we want to say the right words at the right time in the right season. Father, forgive us for our slothfulness and other times. Forgive us for our haste. We need you, Lord. We need you. Lord, I've been serving you all these years of my life, and I have to say, I need you more now than I've ever needed you cuz it seems like there's so much that the children of God are going through. Brother Daryl, talking out about it before we come out tonight, all the sickness and the trouble and the heartache and the anxiety and the stress and the worry and this and that and the other that the children of God are facing. Lord God, they need your help. Father, is one of those that you've called to help them along. I need your help like never before to know how to guide them. Lord, sometimes they look to me as their pastor for answers and I don't have the answers. I don't know what to say if you don't give me something to tell them. I look through the scripture. I look through the message and search and look for an answer. And sometimes I can't find it. And sometimes I have to tell them the same things over and over again. And you're trying me as you're trying them. But we want to be faithful on this desert journey, Lord. For I believe that's where we are right now on the back of this power that's taking us from one oasis to another, one mile after another. are facing unsettled questions, fears, all kinds of noises and sounds in the desert night. Things that we've never faced before. Lord, I imagine Rebecca faced all kinds of emotions and things that she had never experienced in her entire life. We don't want to rise her above her humanity in these next few services, Father. But help me, Lord God, to be able to bring her down as a real type of your bride in this journey. Hallelujah. In order to be of perfect fit in the family of Abraham, she had to be tried. She had to not understand everything and had to ponder and wonder about things. So do we. But Lord, we will say it initially, I will go. We don't have any record that he ever asked her again on the journey. You still want to go? You still want to go? You still want to go? No doubt she did need a little reassurance. She need a little bit of comfort of this and comfort of that. Reason I can say that is because we do. And she typed us. you did when you were on the earth after you had fasted and the devil come to you and tempted you and then he left you. The Bible says for a season and the angels of God came and ministered to you. It shows us that you had laid aside much of your great splendor and your resounding glory because when you were in heaven in the form of logos, you never needed angels to minister to you. But it shows what flesh does what it even did to the son of God. The son of God being the logos in heaven that created the worlds. Yet when the logos was put in a human body, it was so weakened down by humanity that the logos needed angels to minister. Lord God, would you come in this building tonight? Father, may the Holy Ghost pass up and down these rows tonight of these chairs. Father, minister to the young, minister to the single, to the married, to the sick, to the troubled, to the weary. Would you do it, Lord? Our human bodies, it weakens us, Father. It pulls us down. Oh, come by here, Lord God. Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you tonight, Father. How many could just raise your hands up to the Lord? Lord, I need a little charge tonight. I need a little boost as it was. Father, come by here. Lord, come by here. [Music] Come by here, Lord. Come by here. Let's just sing it together. Oh, come by here, Lord. Won't you come by here? Somebody needs you, Lord. Won't you come by? Whoever wants to just come up and stand around the altar, whatever your need is. Come on. Somebody needs you, Lord. Won't you come by here? [Music] Come by here, Lord. Come by here. Come by here. Here Lord come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Somebody needs you, Lord. Come by here. Somebody needs you, Lord. Won't you come by here? Somebody needs you, Lord. Come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Come by here, Lord. Come by here. Come by here, Lord. Won't you come by here? Come by here, Lord. Come by here. [Music] Oh Lord, [Music] won't you come by here? Oh, somebody's praying, Lord. [Music] Come by here. [Music] Somebody's praying, Lord. Won't you come by here? Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Oh, come by here, Lord. Come by here. Come by here, Lord. Won't you come by here? Oh, come by here, Lord. Come by here. [Music] Oh Lord, come by here. Oh, somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Somebody's praying. Lord, won't you come by here? [Applause] Somebody's praying. Lord, come by here. Oh Lord, come by here. Oh, I love you, Lord. For your mercy never fails me. All my days I've been held in your hands. From the moment that I wake up until I lay my hands, I will sing of the goodness of God. All my life you have been faithful. All my life you have been so so good. With every breath that I am able, [Music] I will sing of the goodness of God. I love your voice. You have led me through the fire in darkest night. You are close like no other. &gt;&gt; Like no other. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've known you as a father. &gt;&gt; I've known you as my father. &gt;&gt; I've known and I've also known you as a friend of my closest friend. And I have hallelujah in the good. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Some of you be willing to come up and stand around these up around the altars. Just pray for them. All my life you have been faithful. Oh yes you have. Hallelujah. All my life you have been so good. &gt;&gt; Lord God, you been so good. Every breath that I Oh, I will sing. &gt;&gt; I will sing our goodness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Just pray for one another. Pray for one another. Bear your one burden. So the scripture tells us, "Oh, thank you, Father. Minister, Lord Jesus, to your children, Lord. Oh Lord, that they be a deck on this desert journey and they're weary, Lord, that feel downrodden and downcast. Oh Lord, lift your children tonight, Father. Bring healing, bring encouragement, Lord, whatever they have need of, Lord, in their walk tonight in their journey on this camel train. Grant it, Father, we pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we believe you have everything we have need of. Praise God. We worship you tonight, Father. We bless your name, Lord Jesus. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All my life, &gt;&gt; all my life, you have been so so good. Every breath that I &gt;&gt; I make I will &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing of the goodness of my God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you Lord. Your goodness is running. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's running. &gt;&gt; It's running after us, Lord. Oh, let it chase us down. Jesus is running. You're healing. You encourage me, your deliverance, Lord, whatever we need. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And I will run in the house of the Lord forever. Everything everything. Your goodness is running after running after me. Praise God. Oh my hallelujah. We worship you tonight, Jesus. We bless your name, Father. Thank you. All my life, you have been &gt;&gt; You have been so good, Lord. &gt;&gt; So good. Every breath that I make, I will sing. I'm going to sing the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Praise your holy name, Lord Jesus. We worship you, Lord. Let's just lift our hands together, can we? Oh, thank you, Lord. Or children, aren't you glad you responded and said the right thing? I will go. I will go. Now, we might need to update it a little bit. I'm still going and I'm keeping on going and I'll never turn back. There'll be no turning back. Be no turning back. Be no turning back. Be no turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. No turning. No turning back. Come on, help me sing it out. No turning back. No turning. Keep turning back. No turning back. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me. No turning. No turning back. No turning back. Oh, no turning back. No turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. No turning. No turning back. No turning. [Music] He No turning. No turning back. No turning back. Now you white folks do a pretty good job singing that song. But let me just tell you something right now. And me and Carol stood in South Africa several years ago when I first heard that song. And black brothers and sisters there in South Africa, they can sing that song. Oh my. And this is one thing they do. Be no turning back. And they put their whole body into it. They do their hands like this. Be no turning back. Oh, I don't expect some of you white people to do it. You save all that for soccer. And you save all that for baseball and football and basketball. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all scream your lungs out at some kind of bunch of nonsense like that and come to church and stand there like a bump on a pickle. Shame on you. &gt;&gt; Jesus wants your emotions like he does your heart and your soul. He wants everything about you. &gt;&gt; Will you say, "I'll go. &gt;&gt; You let him have your emotions. &gt;&gt; What about your tears? &gt;&gt; What about your excitement?" the pro. You say, "Now wait a minute, brother Don. You're going Pentecostal." So, no, I'm going to mighty God unveiled before us in Philadelphia 1964. Same kind of people with the same experience, with the same emotion, acting the same way they did on the day of Pentecost. I'm also going to shreport 1965 at Invisible Union. There's only one way them acts 238 youngans act, screaming, hollering, shouting. &gt;&gt; Are we Acts 238 younganss? All right, let's sing it together now. One more time before we go, brother. Let's sing it one more time before we go, shall we? God bless you, Rebecca. Are you on your way? &gt;&gt; Are you happy you're gone or are you still looking back? Say, I wish I'd stayed at mama's house. Are you happy you're going? &gt;&gt; I will go and I ain't turning back. Be no turning. Pick it up a little bit. Oh, be no turning back. No turning back. No turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. No turning. Keep turning back. Ain't no turning back. Hallelujah. Ain't no turning back. No turning back. I have decided to follow the message. I have decided. It's Christ my Lord. I have decided to follow the message. I have decided. Reveals Christ my Lord. No turning. No turning back. I can't go back to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; You can't go back to Luther. You can't go back to Baptist. Christ is the word. Amen. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. We don't turn back. We don't turn back. Hallelujah. Turning back. Keep turning back. And this is what made it possible. Amazing. [Music] Grace, [Music] how sweet the sound that save a rich like me. I once was all [Music] but now I'm so found. So found, so found. Was blind, but now I see. Heavenly Father, we thank you for grace tonight. Rebecca, no doubt it was her first experience of grace on this measure. Something overwhelmed her. Something beyond her nature. Something beyond her learning. something beyond her heritage of her family, a supernatural presence from an angel of God that met her about 30 minutes before Eleaser got there and already prepared her heart. Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight. I believe that every bride member standing here present and the rest of those around the world have had a similar experience. It was more than just hearing some verses in the scriptures, more than hearing some miracles performed by a servant of God. It was a supernatural call. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We are told that Solomon was out venturing into his kingdom one day and he had been to different parts of his kingdom, but he had never been to this particular part and Shunum. And when he went there, he saw this lovely little lady. She wasn't as beautiful maybe as some of the other women that he had in his court because she said she was black and she was clumly. As a matter of fact, we know that she had been mistreated in her family and left to take care of the sheep. It was a great great prize of the women of that day to be fairs skinned and liked. In order to do that, they would have to stay out of the sun. But this little lady had lots of days in the sun. So it had darkened her skin. But she stole Solomon's heart and he fell in love at first sight. Praise God. Oh Jesus, we're so glad that we also have got a son of man tan. We don't believe in stripping our clothes off and laying naked out on a beach like a lizard on a sand pile. But we do believe in laying in the presence of the sun till all the greenness is baked out of us. Oh, the world may consider us black or faulty or whatever they wish to say, but you look at us and say, "I loved you before the foundation of the world. And I gave you a part of me which would help you through your entire life's journey." Your prophet said, "Many of you can fellowship with me on this thought." There was something even in you when you were a child that made you long for God. Even when others would do this or that or go this way or that way, there's something about it. And he said that laid in you then. We did not become children when we received the word. We did not become children when we received the spirit. We were children was the reason we could receive the spirit. We love you, father. Go with us now tonight, Lord. Protect us. Watch over us. Bring us back again Sunday if it be pleasing to you. Go with us now in Jesus name. Praise the Lord. How many can say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord? Praise the Lord. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. We shall wear a crown. Oh, we shall wear a crown, my brother. When the battle's over, we shall wear a crown. In that new Jerusalem, we'll wear a crown. We'll wear a crown. We're a bright and shining crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in that new Jerusalem [Music] in the name of the Lord Jesus. in that new Jerusale [Music] and shining crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in that new Jerusalem. We'll wear a crown. Wear a crown. Wear a bright and shining crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in that new Jerusalem. We'll wear a crown. Wear a crown. We're bright and shining ground. And when the battle's over, we shall wear crown in that new J. We wear crown. Wear a crown. Wear a bright and shiny crown. And when the battle's over, we shall wear a crown in that new Jerusale.
