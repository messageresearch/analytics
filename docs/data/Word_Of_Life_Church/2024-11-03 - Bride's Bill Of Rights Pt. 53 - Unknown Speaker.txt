amen amen how he's happy to be in the house of God today it's a great privilege for us in it let's turn to Daniel chter 7 verse 10 today Daniel 7: 10 I want to speak to you today by the help of the Lord on the right to the god of love the right to the god of love now listen to me carefully not the right to the love of God but the right to the god of love there's all kinds of things that God loves but they don't have the right to love him back he loved the blue the azer colors in the sky he loves the color of the ocean he loves the green God must really like green don't he you ever notice how much green there is in the in the earth God loves that but green can't love God back that's right the sky can love him back he loves a variety of colors and birds plumage white brown green the peacock is just so beautiful with its variety of colors yet the colors and their pigmentation cannot love him back so your blessed today cuz you get to love him back Daniel 7: 10 a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him so thousand thousands ministered unto him 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was said and the books were open 1 John 4 verse 7 beloved let us love love one another for love is of God and everyone that love us is born of god wow so you mean just because a person can love something means they're born of God you see John is using a differentiation in the word love people love pizza right yeah people love their car they love their house some people love the beach some people love mountains and we say I love the color of that suit I love the color of that dress do they yeah they do but just because you love like that don't mean that you love God right amen Now watch how John said it beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that love us love us what what not trees not grass not pizza not cars but everyone that loveth one another that's right is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is amen now notice John does not say that God loves and he does but he actually is love for God is love verse 16 and we have known and believ the love that God has to us God is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God now notice where your house is where your place of residence is he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him to me this profoundly placed put together scripture must be one of the greatest in the entire Canon of the Bible love is not simply a quality which God possesses but rather love is that which is his very nature so the love of God and the god of love the love of God and the god of love I hope today each of us in this building have a right to be able to love this God I may like to be remembered as we pray together today let's just hold our needs our request in our hearts Lord Jesus we're so grateful for this opportunity again that we could assemble today in this place that you've given us to be able to Worship You Lord we've not gathered that we could show off our clothes or gather together that we could talk about what's going on in the world though that certainly concerns us but Lord we believe church is a very special time Church to us is not just a social Gathering to where we can gather together and socialize and we do do that but yet it's more than that to us it's to hear from you and then in turn let you hear back from us it's to meet our brothers and sisters and greet them the people that we believe we will spend eternity with we've also come for correction today if we need to be corrected we've come for encouragement we've come for healing but we've come to worship we've come to praise oh Jesus take charge of the service father help me shut my mouth to anything that would displease you granted I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you you may be seated the right to the god of love I know we say love a lot people say it to us a lot people could we can meet for the first time um Carol and I saw somebody this week and uh woman didn't know us from Adam and Eve but she said love you guys love you guys Carol said well glad to know that she loves us I said how can she love us she don't even know us I mean first time she ever seen us in our life so it can become a term that we use you know I mean here in East Tennessee hey buddy hey buddy hey buddy you know all the cliches that we use around here come to find out they're not your buddy at all are they so it can be that way with with love and we should love we should not only love our own kind but we should love those that are beyond our kind that's what God did in order to save the world God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son you know the rest of the scripture that they might be saved if they wish to be but yet it doesn't mean that everybody that God loved will have the ability to be able to love him back so to receive the love of God is one thing versus the god of love the love of God as I mentioned it last week gives every Mortal on the Earth today fresh air you ever try to figure that out you know you make a little something sisters in your house and uh whatever it is that you're cooking and it leaves a remnant of that smell in your house or your car you carry something in your car and it leaves a little bit of Remnant think of all the debris that is rotting after this hurricane that we've been through the water how bad that it is and the trees tend of thousands of trees that are rotting and yet how come does not fill the air with stench why is it that the mud that was all stirred up by the flood waters doesn't totally overwhelm the scent that's on the earth and yet we walk out we don't even smell it if you didn't know any better you would never know that you're 11 or 12 miles just down the road from horrendous sites of trees that were uprooted others that were blown down and all types of things and burning burning and burning and burning trees to get rid of them and yet why doesn't the whole earth smell like that because God made a way for the ozone layer which is above the Earth to be able to purify so he caused the trees to be able to take in the carbon monoxide and the other things and put out what oxygen so God has this gigantic thing going on in the Earth every day that we live there people don't even think about it they just when it becomes weather with they can they can't wait to open a door crack a window to let in what what we call Fresh Air and yet there are millions of leaves that are fixing to fall off the trees thousands of them have already fallen right and yet they're fixing to start decomposing and they will turn back to matter and you reach down and pick it up and hold it in your hands and it has a smell you'll see black mold you'll see all different types of things but how come the Earth doesn't smell like that because God knew that it needed this ventilation so he created a way that the Earth day by day would be able in all this deaths and all this matter that is rotting God made a way for the earth to renew itself if you look at your own life as a child of God and not get down at all the matter in your lives and and all the rot in your lives and all the rotness around the world God's given you a holy ghost ozone layer that you can be renewed and refreshed in his presence every day you live on the earth but it's going to depend upon you will you allow the spirit of God to renew your joy and to renew the opportunities that you have or are you just going to constantly go around picking up the rotten leaves and the rotten woods and the rotten this and that and the other and there's mushrooms over there and there's all type of bacteria and things here and there you going to focus on that there's all kinds of it out there to focus on if you wish to or you can focus on God has been so good to me I don't deserve anything that he's done but he didn't do it because I deserved it he did it because he loved me now truly every one of us today whether or not you're even a Christian have experienced the love of God okay so it's a quarter till to 12 and we're sitting here we've been here now for a little bit and we've experienced oxygen we've exchanged lungs the air in our lungs multiple hundreds of times since you've been here already our blood has been able to take the food that we digested early the enzymes from our body rush into our our gases and acids and so on inside the stomach have already started doing that the love of God giving you another day to live the white blood cells the red blood cells already going about taking whatever it was you ate for breakfast all this is going on every day of your life you don't even thank God for it most of us don't even think nothing about it unless we start having problems then we begin to think about it right so we we absolutely experience the love of God every day you was able to get up out of bed this morning that was the mercy of God to you you're able to take a breath you're able to have a church where you can come and be able to worship God in spirit and in truth what is that the love of God but does that mean that every person that experiences that element or measure of love has the god of love now to experience the love of God and to have the god of love is two different things now the love of God was extended in John 3:16 as we quoted it already that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved now that's a great thing is it not and there will be millions of John 3:16 people as a matter of fact we just read about it here in the Book of Daniel and they will stand Before the Throne of God many of them will never be capable to enter in into the god of love yeah they will say I experienced the love of God I was a drunk I was a liar I was a wherer and God forgave me of my sins and and I found a church and I went there and then I I I heard other people talk about the Holy Ghost and I never had the Holy Ghost I never saw a need to give up habits in my life or that in my life but you can't tell me I did not experience the love of God and you know what they did God forgave them and many of them become church members and this church or that church whatever church that they chose to go to and they still experience the love of God and blessings and material things and other things that God did for them but does that mean because they experience the love of God they have the god of love here you see John was the disciple of love as we know but yet we also know from the preview that we see of John uh him and his brother how that they asked for a particular place in the Kingdom of Jesus now that was not the love of God that John was going to experience so what I find amazing is that the disciple of Love wasn't always the disciple of love he was a disciple of selfishness so it wasn't like that John was born this Golden Child and he always had this supreme Insight of the love of God and he was just this perfect figure now truly no doubt he was altogether different than Peter I imagine Peter start getting whooped from the time he is two w up you know Peter just got ragged on I mean he must have got his mouth mashed over and over again for those of you that don't know Kentucky language what that is you say something and your mama reaches back and smacks you right in the Smacker and it kind of helps you pay more attention what you're going to say next time so John was not you know like that in the way that Peter was but John himself still did not have the god of love now we know there was a special something about him and Jesus loved him but yet John could never have that God of love until he received his portion of the pillar of fire on the day of Pentecost and John even though he experienced an element of the love of God in saving him and he experienced an element of the love of God and being close to the Lord Jesus as a matter of fact the only disciple that we know according to the four gospels that was there at the sight of the Cross all the rest of them had fled away so it seems as if though John had an element of love that even Peter and James Mar you some of the rest of the brothers did not have but John did not have the god of love though he experienced the love of God now what what I'm looking at this morning is that once God uh expanded and and allowed this type of love to leave from his own being he knew that once he ever let this go out of himself that this love released would demand Fellowship ship now listen once love is released and you me whoever it is Mortals on the earth that begin to acknowledge a love then it will demand Fellowship it's just automatic with love so you take a young man a young woman and they come to that age and they start thinking about boyfriends and girlfriends and all of that and then they get up very old 2021 and they're they're just convinced totally that they're doomed to a life of celibacy their whole life you know cuz their life is just about over they ain't got a girlfriend or a boyfriend and if they reach 25 or 26 I mean they are in major major desperation right brothers so you see some of these young men laughing at me here this morning because something in them is expressing and they they never felt that way when they were little bitt but something in them is calling for an expression and that love demands Fellowship so then they start talking to girls and the girls start talking to boys and they go to camps and now y'all can act like that I'm the old fogy Pastor okay and that I don't know what I'm talking about but there's been many of our youths around the message that have met their mate at youth camps and then there's been many of our youth who met the devil at Youth Camp camps and they'd been better off if they' never met that boy or girl that they met because it want to cause them a lot of trouble but what is that they're in the quest and the search for a demand of Love cuz there's something in them and it's like it's it's reaching out for the love of someone that can love them back listen this and God's provided approach the Divine Fellowship the prophet said that there is a True Fellowship and God is love and love demands love Demands a fellowship now I'm sure all of us know of people you know they really don't like being around people they like horses better than they do humans they like dogs they like cats they like you know whatever more they like just being by theel they'd rather be by theel and they are their most favorite company they talk to theel they eat with theel they just rather be about you know there's something wrong with that person I mean I hate to be the one to tell you today but if they really love right love demands Fellowship love demands Fellowship now we all need that private time I'm not saying there's something weird with you about that but God made us to be social creatures watch again he says it a little bit different and what made God provide this way because God is love and love demands Fellowship love demands Fellowship so he repeats it that love demands Fellowship I I can only imagine in my mind today as you that we would be able to go back to the Garden of Eden and think of what a perfect love that Adam and Eve must have had in the Garden of Eden and that perfect love was between each other and it was between them and God it's something to be honest with you that most of us have never experienced if by the new birth we become born again and we become changed then we're entering into that perfect love but still we will find people that we will struggle with being able to really love them the way we do others any humans still here today that can nod your head or say Amen you see it was totally unlike that in the Garden of Eden there was nothing there that they had to struggle there's only two human beings on the Earth but there was no strain between Adam and Eve and God had to make them in this perfect lovable condition so there was nothing about Adam that Eve would have disliked there was nothing about Eve that Adam would have disliked and there was nothing about either or of them that God disliked so it was the pure perfect love of God issuing force from the stream of its origination now we know that according to the way that Moses wrote it there in the Book of Genesis he said that there were four rivers that came down through the paradise of God and he gives us the great name of them and he tells us of where they started and how they come through and the tigress and the eus and you remember reading that in the Bible and we know that a couple of those have been lost but yet there's some of those that are still flowing and yet the beginning or the origination of those rivers and it's amazing because when God had Moses to WR it that he would say about the gold and this and that and the other that was in the Garden of Eden and the gold was good there so he took something out of that paradise and be to describe what it was so we know then that Not only was uh Euphrates there and the tigress and the other rivers that were there but also there was another River and it was the river of perfect love its issue had started already before the foundation of the world because Angels come out of God the elect Angels come out of those attributes of God which can never fail now unlike us God has thoughts and attributes of things that he wants which will only be in time and there are other things that comes out of him that are of his own Essence which means that they are of Eternal quality but God knew that there would be day and there would be night and yet we know according to Revelation 21 and 22 whenever John saw the city he said there will be no night there there just inside the city so there are things then that we experience here on the earth that will not be in the eth day there are things that we experience now that those who have already passed Beyond on the curtain of time and gone in the sixth Dimension they will not experience nor will they experience it again but there are other things of God that are Eternal so it's as if God was selective in through which part these thoughts projected forth and came into existence and we know that from this Great River of Love God himself began to allow this to be expressed and the first thing that he made was angels and they wor worshiped him then he entered into this attribute called God because God is an object of worship before that he was just the Eternal he dwelt alone with his thoughts the lonely God but he knows if he ever expresses this love it will by itself demand Fellowship so if he's going to love he's going to Fellowship but Fellowship is always risky when you're fellowshipping with something which is less than yourself now God knew when he made the man if he would have left him in spirit form the man could not have fallen but in spirit form his wife's identity was in him but she did not have a separate identity they were together and God knew the very moment that he divides this man whenever he breathes into his nostrils this lump of clay and the prophet said he was his toes was like roots of a tree as they were down in the ground and there he stood so God made him and he made the organs and the tissue and the bones and the brain matter and all of that and yet the man was just standing there God raises him from the table by which he had made him on the dust of the earth then God stands him up and there he stands like a statue his toes are there in the earth he's not breathing he's not moving there's no animation about him his eyes are not batting his heart is not pumping but when God breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life animation struck this man so his heart starts pumping all of a sudden God transforms this pile of dust into blood blood cells oxygen saturation all the carbohydrates and you know all all the things in the body and all that God did an immediate transformation and this dust is standing there in this form and God breathes and Man became a living Soul so here he is straight from the river of God so God breathes into his nostrils the breath of life and it becomes a living soul then he looks at him Papa my father my papa my father now if he an expression of love love will demand Fellowship you imagine the first time that Adam and in the Garden of Eden reached out his hand to take a hold of God who was that there in the Garden of Eden ah you see it was the same one that would hang upon the cross thousands of years later and say forgive them Father for they know not what they do now he's the first one to experience life also the first Gman to experience love I'm yet to feel the way he did I'm yet to be able to look on all that creation that God made and look at it through eyes of perfection and find no fault cuz like you like me like all the rest of us we're all so deeply flawed are we not now God enters into this stage but God also knows that Adam himself maybe not right off But as time would go on that Adam would start developing these feelings too initially he was probably perfectly satisfied we don't even know how long it was might have been a year might have been 10,000 years we don't know but all of a sudden he began to develop feelings that he did not have at the original taking of the Breath of Life feelings that he did not have once God had experienced an allowed him to experience his love and now for the first time father Could Feel Love from a human being he must have been so anxious absolutely every day when he would come down on the Garden of Eden he could not wait till his son would just come up and just hug him and to be able to touch him and remember the invisible God took on a visible form and that was Christ pre Jesus preincarnate form oh God must have been under such anticipation because his love demanded Fellowship maybe it was the first afternoon after Adam felt it around noon or so maybe in the day and papa came and he got around him he said you okay son yeah I'm good I'm good I'm good is sure all right that's the way the Lord does US ain't it sometimes you sure you sure you're all right you sure you done okay Papa knew what it was oh he's come to that spot maybe it was not at the state to where God said it's not good for man to be alone maybe it just started out with a feeling of an emotion he never felt before he had everything he wanted but whenever he started fellowshipping with God it's like fellowship with God brought out the desire in him to want to fellowship with more of God that's so I'm telling you friends folks around this message that think they don't need nobody they need the Holy Ghost is what they need and if they ever get the Holy Ghost they realize they need to find a church somewhere that preaches the truth and they'll find out they need brothers and sisters come on now Heaven ain't going to be made with a bunch of cabins on the hill and you're 500,000 miles away from your closest neighbor I know some of you think that's the ideal place of Heaven There ain't no such a thing well praise the Lord so something in him and then we know of course what God did and then when God looks at them oh my it was it was just unexplainable whenever he looked and she looked at him and he looked at her but you see when a human learns how to love they are so dangerous and when they learn the rewards of love and that's when Satan tries to get them no you understand me today the more you embrace the light of God and the more you Embrace God's love it opens up an element of vulnerability about you that was not there when you were a sinner that's right amen because you have now delved into the realm of the Supernatural and then what you have to be careful for is that your love of the supernatural does not become overcome by the wrong Supernatural yes sir because once we get to the realm of Supernatural then remember Satan always has an element himself of Supernatural reserved for those who want Supernatural Well praise the Lord that's why the prophet said in Harvest time that the devil can hand out them Supernatural gifts by the handful now he don't offer that to people who don't love Supernatural cuz they don't believe in it but if you love Supernatural and we have to if we love God because he is Supernatural so it's like before that become awoken in us we were not aware that it was there and that love you know but once it becomes and you love Supernatural God and you love the supernatural element then Satan also knows okay they've been awakened to that and now that love for Supernatural will demand fellowship and then God listen God himself will even allow him to come and try you to see if you will judge your Supernatural love and your Supernatural desire you will judge it by the word so Satan hands you a gift and yet that gift is not exactly with a word you will reject that gift if you love of him right because you know God don't tell lies that's right well praise the Lord so I've turned now Adam and Eve fall in the Garden of Eden and then of course we know the the fall and how the story goes and how that they both were expressing after the fall they showed that they had now went down the tributary of time and they had made this extensive long journey listen just by one little simple Act of Disobedience they had now left the mouths of this Great River of perfect love and they found them themselves having journeyed by one little sin had now journeyed way on down the river and the tributary of love so now they don't love each other right and they don't love God right now they still love but they're love love is not from the source the way it was cuz they loved perfectly now they're loving in a flawed way so you can see Adam's selfishness the woman thou gavest and then the woman well the serpent did this and what are they doing blaming everybody and their brother boy as a pastor I hear that all the time well it's so and so's fault it's so and so I'll tell you one if they wouldn't Hypocrites at church I'd go to church that don't stop you from going to Walmart does it that going to stop you from going to longh Horn today for dinner you're going to get up and make a public announcement every gay leave this restaurant while I'm here every liar leave this restaurant of course you ain't going to do it you're going to go in there and sit down and sit there and smile like a Poss if they bring your steak out there your chicken whatever and you're going to sit there and you see somebody's green hair and purple streaks down the back of it you see two men holding hands you're going to say pitiful that's the way you ought to do the house of God you ought not to let this person or that person or that person stop you you ought to say I'm not going because of them I'm not going because of that person I'm going because I am a worshiper and my love and my heart demands Fellowship now during this whole time can you imagine what God Lost In the Garden of Eden the love of his life now for those of us in our assembly who've lost a husband or a wife and there's a great love that a parent has for a child there's no question about it there's a great love that you have for your nieces nephews and cousins and so on and so on but oh if a man has a woman that God GES him gave him rather and she has a man that God gave her and their Eternal mates together what a loss that is if God takes one before the other and you feel like your life will never ever be the same and in one way it won't why because as we said that was the love of my life so now God points to the gate and said you all get out leave today but when he looked at him it just so overwhelmed him and he come down in front of them and said to the woman not to the man I I I will bring enmity between thy seed and the seed of the serpent I will bring you back isn't that amazing that he said that to the woman not to the man Satan used the woman through what her Avenue of love so what she did was she allowed herself she come to that spot of loving and Satan perverted that love what was it lust praise the Lord but you see if God would have kept that within her harnessed it never allowed her to experience it she would have never known she would have never known anything about it but love demanded Fellowship don't you understand when you go to hanging around the wrong people oh listen school kids you're going to school you're going to college you got to be careful because Satan will try to pull you into the wrong Fellowship doing the wrong things why cuz there's something in humans is that right yes sir so God must start all over again so he lost the love of his life but actually when you know where something is it's not really lost out of existence it's just temporarily misplaced ain't that right now as far as God's way of keeping time remember all of this and the span of what man has been upon the Earth the fall the cross the resurrection and so on one day being in his time a thousand years it's not hardly been weak yet now we look at oh it's been so long but for him it's not really been that long so in the middle of the week he died and he raised again and we know that God started in his rebuilding of his Masterpiece with a man called Abram and he brings it on down he starts love loving again loving again but now I must love ones who are so flawed not like Adam who was perfect but now that the seed's been mixed to Genesis 6 his children some of them will be murderers Liars thieves idolators and adulterers everything imaginable now his children will be that how can God love such people watch this in the church in this condition I thought of how God of the dove is such a loving bird and the dove God wanting to make love with his human beings God wants to be loved God wants to love you God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but to have everlasting life blessed be the Lord then God wanting to make love he had to make something lovable he had to make something gentle like himself he had to make something that could be loved he had to make something of his own nature oh and yet after what happened in the Garden of Eden there was an element of time to where even after that that sons of God still catered toward father Satan had not yet achieved fully what he wanted Genesis 6 now M mixes the Bloodlines and therefore the the nature so then every human being will become contaminated exactly what Satan wanted in the beginning you realize why many people cannot live right for the Lord today it's all about their love life amen yes sir it's all about their love life the things they love why I can't do this I can't do that what simple it's what do you love the most is that right it's what you love the most so then notice the key here and this is he had to make something of his own nature you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature now Lord willing this week brother Malachi and sister Chloe are going to get married and you imagine if Sister Cy would have come to me a long time ago and car and talked to us and she'd found this young man and she really really liked him and got serious about him and that's perfectly natural and normal right oh what if she would have come to me and said I found this poodle brother Donnie its hair is so curly and I was wondering could we have the wedding at the church oh you say that's crazy it is can you imagine God marrying any of us without us truly being changed now this separates the bride from the church because you see the church wants to come to God and they want to sure give him their sins give him let him go do all the hard work but they'll still keep this and this and this and this and this and this but they want God to love them so much that he just simply overlooks everything about B God is not marrying the bride because of overlooking God is marrying her because she's been so changed he will marry a bride of his own nature friend you realize what a miracle we are here today every one of you that are truly born again every person sitting here or those that are listening to this service and if you are truly born again you are a phenomenal Miracle because you were born a liar you were born lost we were born wretched we were born Wicked we were born come to the world speaking lies how in the world could God ever love us God ministered to us the love of God until the seed could grab a hold of it it'll transform the seed then the seed can get not only the love of God but the god of love Hallelujah there's something in the bride today that I believe with all of my heart that is craving for more love more love from God and more love for ourselves anybody feel that way today you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature loving has to unite with love a husband and wife has to love one another if they ever make the grade family has to love one another if they ever make the great something to be loved you search everywhere find a girl to be your wife that you love She searches finding a husband that she can love and God searches trying to find a soul that he can love here am I Lord here am I Lord Love Me Love Me Lord hallelujah so by our first nature then we were not very lovable Ephesians 2:3 says that this way among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the the lust of our flesh fulfilling listen this the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature by Nature oh my the children of WRA oh my wow how in the world that I become a child of WRA I believe I was conceived naturally between my mother and father is a child of love how did I become a child of rest and it wasn't in their nature it was in my own notice the word rest it says anger Vengeance temper movement or agitation of the Soul those of you that's got enough temper to fight a buz saw you need a little control switch it's called the Holy Ghost amen you may fight it all your life but it'll bring it under control so notice Paul says then we were by Nature children of Wrath even as others so here are some that were by Nature children of WRA but not by seed no a so by Nature I was a child of Wrath by nature I was identified on the other side but not by representation by seed and where do we get that at from the devil oh brother Donnie I'll tell you one thing I run my genealogy I go back to the Duke of England and I go back to the Royal House of the Scottish show and so and so and so all them was of the devil too Royal Blood there is no such a thing that's right come on somebody well I'll tell you one thing I I'm part of this particular Clan out of iron and out of this and that and the other thieves Liars whoremongers robbers that's right the Royal Blood there is only one Royal Blood that's the Lord Jesus yes sir now watch Satan can copy any kind of a gift and any kind of a manifestation listen but he can't love God is love that's right Satan can't love so all of you if there's anyone here today that's not a Christian you're living for the devil you're serving a master that can never will ever love you that's right amen yeah Satan can't love so what did we experience prior to our new birth human love but remember it's so far from the original Fountain the river where it come from now it's beyond me how that a man would want to fall in love with a man and want to marry a man okay it's beyond me it's beyond me that a woman would want to marry a woman woman do they have an element of love for them yeah no doubt they do they bear reproach of doing it they face being ridiculed laughed at rejected by their own family a lot of them is that right so they have some sort of emotion but where is it it's way on down even farther from the original creation of those of you that have married according to God's program but is it love yeah just like a person could love an animal they could love a dog or a cat or whatever more do they love it they do is it the same type of Love they have for a human if it is they're weird that's right that's right where does it come from it's coming from the river but it's way way way way way down way down you're at the bottom it's nearly at the very end of the trickle of love and this I love that person oh I know I do that's my mate I want to be with him for the rest of my life and you're looking say are you kidding me are you you kidding me why because you don't live from there you're closer to the mouse where it comes out up here oh praise the Lord and with the bride of Jesus Christ don't you understand from his mouth Goes Forth a living sword but also from his mouth Comes The Living Waters of his word and there's something in us that's pulling us back we want to go beyond brother Jim what our fathers could love I don't know about you I want to go beyond what my mother and father and they I I want to see them that day but I want to go beyond the love they were able to have for God anybody else what about some of our fathers those that originally founded this church as Happy Valley we want to go more why because the light of God is shining brighter now than it done 40 years ago or 45 years ago and as we progress in the word of God in our walk we're getting closer and closer and closer to the Fountain closer to the origination then it should not make us have more hatred it should make us have more love not only for God but for our brothers and sisters and for our fellow [Applause] men listen this you see a man humble and loving good to his neighbors and a good citizen a good fellow and a good man a Christian man full of love and humility you watch that man see that's right he's good charitable longsuffering you can talk about him it's all right like he forgives you testing one two testing one two I must have had a malfunction there on the microphone uh Houston we've got a problem here Brothers uh did it break out on y'all it didn't break out okay I think I'll read it again just in case some of you had a hearing block I can't hear you I can't hear you can you hear me now can you hear me now can you hear me now you can talk about him it's all right right he forgives you don't make any difference to him there's the real man keep your eye on him that bears and he's an example but no matter how much he shouts in church how much he does this or that or the other still hasn't got that Paul said though I speak with tongues oh my of men and of angels and though I have all these other things have enough Faith to move mountains now boy wouldn't that be a man with all keep our eyes on a man that could speak in tongues like men and angels and a man that would stand right here and move Buffalo mountain and you walk out there and say Lord have mercy what happened to that mountain that man of great faith moved it right in the middle of Johnson City they're having to build a road around it right now cuz he decided he want that to set right on North throne and he done moves boy where's his church at man a lot that's that's my pastor right there oh my notice he said though You' understand all the mysteries of God all the mysteries of God and I've been through all the seminaries and know it all up and down one side and the other and have not charity it profiteth me nothing that's right amen who doesn't want to be loved we all want that yes that's right we all need it yes we do and then the way to get it come on W that is not the answer you always expecting oh you thought I was going to say the way to get it is point it out to people you all ain't loving me right you ain't out to you one thing come on brother no the way to get it is to love somebody else then you will be lovable praise God but remember in order for God to make us truly lovable there must be a nature change second Peter 1:4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature listen at the meaning of this word divine Theos godhead spoken of the only and true God that we might be able to partake of Theos the only way that I can love him back right is he must be in me loving out that's right if I get a religious spirit and I go to church I'll love him and I'll you know I'll do all of that and people do they love him yes you the prophet tells that you can love and even love God and still be lost because you're loving from the human realm of emotion that's not what it takes to give him the love that he wants back the only way to really be able to love him is when he comes inside of us and he changes us takes the world out of us and then we start l in God like God wants to be loved and like God wants to be served so God said don't do that don't do that oh why in the world oh my goodness that's all they preach dos and don'ts and dos and don'ts and to a person that don't have God in them it's too hard to bear it's too difficult they just can't do it but if God ever gets in your soul Theos the divine nature so God in Me has no problem raising my hands and worshiping and adoring and loving when I feel so low that I feel like God don't even know my name or address anybody ever been there sure you have but yet you love him so much it's in spite of you it's beyond you and you don't just love him that way right you love others now notice that you might be partakers of the divine nature so what's this again now Divine godhead spoken of of the only and true God whatever can in any respect be liken to God or resembles him in any way hebraic which is a word form of the Hebrew language God's Representatives or vice Regent magistrates and judges The Book of Daniel again divine nature fusus the force you've seen these license place tag and bumper cigar haven't you May the force be with you yeah well I'm not sure what force they're talking about but this is the force I'm talking about if the force is with you you'll love like God and you'll forgive like God oh my brother Donnie I'll tell you one thing it runs in my neighbor we hold grudges bad and we can never forgive boy if anybody ever does anything to us we can never forget them you need the force I said you need the force get rid of the Weber and get rid of the Reagan and get rid of the Philips and the Ys and come on somebody get rid of the Nome or whoever you are and love like God loves and forgive but I'll never be able to do it I understand there's things I've been through there ain't no way in the world I could ever forgive people for what they've done to me on my own but once I got the Holy Ghost I found the power of forgiveness was in my new nature the force was in me the force was with me it's not just a nice bumper sticker it's not just a nice license Port it is our Nature by the grace of God that's how we love I love deity from my deity I love God from my part of God the force laws order of nature as opposed to what is monstrous abnormal perverse the sum now watch the sum of innate properties and Powers by which one person differs from others that you might be partakers of the divine nature 1 John 4:16 and we have known and believe the love that God has to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwell Us in God you say I don't want love to be a summer Chalet in the mountains I don't want love to be a VRBO on the beach in late September I don't want love to be a visit to the Gatlinburg mountains when the snow is blowing I take a little break I want love to be my everyday place that I live I want you to notice friends there's very few differentiations in the scripture that will identify by a oneliner a real True Believer but this is one of them yeah so he that dwelleth in Love Not Human love now dwelleth in God and God in him so he's moved beond I got the love of God praise the Lord I got the love of God I got the love of God this man this woman has the god of love you have the source look at the word dwellers Mino abide remain continue not to depart to be held kept in reference to state or condition to remain as one not to become another or different you see this love keeps you when you're downen this love keeps you when people don't like you this love keeps you when church people hurt your feelings anybody ever been hurt by church people yeah if you've ever been around many you have this type of Love Will Keep you when everybody misunderstands you yeah oh my brother don't that's God that you're talking about God that can do that I am that's right am and I want every bride believer in this assembly to listen to this next quote as I'll close with it there's nothing else that you can do only believe and if you believe then them little immoral things will just drop off like that as you believe you become love so we are actually in the process of becoming what God wants us to be isn't it amazing so to become you know I love the scripture that that John said he came to his own and his own received him not but to as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God and that word is to come into view or it is a prophetic word that comes to pass so you were a prophetic word of a son or daughter of God and you're coming to pass you understand when the prophet goes beyond the curtain of time he loved people when he was here he loved people so much as far as human capability plus the Holy Ghost but once he moved Beyond the Veil and he moved into a realm that he had never been before then he began to describe what he felt and the people were there perfect Beyond perfect Sublime Beyond Sublime he said he knew no word in the English language that would describe it so he be to talk about what it was he was so inquisitive about what it was where I of all these Broms you these this is you're gathered to your people my people my my my people you all these brandom no these are your converts that you've led to Christ so here they come and women came first now it was thought that in the world that he was a woman hater but in the sixth Dimension you sisters got to hug him before us brothers did you proved he wasn't a woman hater he is a true woman lover but telling them the truth so he must put and differentiate between women hugging him in life so he said he never let a woman hug him come up close to him all that sort of thing CU it could cause a sens ation he said a man even hugging his own little daughter but him being male her being female it could cause a sensation isn't that strange how the human being that is that close to a perversion you understand so whenever our our our daughters grow up you fathers know as well as I do that you still hug your daughters you still put your arm around them but you hug them in a different way than when they were little girls is that true why C that Avenue that's there in this is so close to perversion that you hug your own little daughter in the wrong way and that quickly that easily the perversion can be be this is not yet been filled with the Holy Ghost praise the Lord so when they come up and they start hugging him he notices something different now the women in form and in shape and so on our precious brother our precious brother and then they begin to Enlighten him on where he is and what he's entered into this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost now you see a preacher can preach things sometimes that he himself has not yet entered into now I preach that same thing but I'm not interdom to what he ented to why my body's not yet been changed and he said lay thus saith the Lord lay aside everything until you get into that perfect love don't you understand our souls arrive in Eden first the whole thing is the restoration and bringing it back to the Garden of Eden our souls will get there before our bodies do by the New Birth the Breath of God the same God that breathes by his mouth the beginning of the rivers of life from the mouth of God that same God did that to you when you got the Holy Ghost on your soul and you became a living Soul then you start loving and loving man car was standing yesterday and we was washing dishes together well she was washing and I was drying and I told her I said you know and I'll close when we first give our hearts to God and we get saved and God lets Trials come against us and they're of a certain strength and of a certain measure yet as we grow in God if those trials didn't intensify and become harder and more difficult then the character in us would become stunted and would we would reach a certain level and that's as far as it would go so I told her I said you know it looks like to me that we must be getting closer and closer than ever before not just the signs of the times but the intensity with the Steve of the trials we're going through but if God allowed you and tried you with something that you overcome 50 years ago 40 years ago 10 years ago 12 years ago would that actually make more of Christ in your character but he must let them intensify don't be discouraged by the intensification of your storms and your trials but rather let the intensifying testify God can trust you with more now than ever before amen but also know that when he gets ready sis when he gets ready the wings of heaven will come by your way and bring the Deliverance that you need and then you can look look back and say well I could have never went through that 5 years ago I could have never went through this and that and the other don't you understand it means you're growing in God and your love Satan is always questioning you the question of your life about your Christianity is your love and his love and he'll tell you he don't love you he don't care for you he don't love you you don't love him you make don't you see his whole thing it's about your love life as you believe you become love and love is God and you begin to wind yourself into Christ and these other things you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves there's no desire to do it the worshipper having Purge no more conscience the desire of sin Hebrews 9 the worshipper once purged you see what I mean when the worshipper is purged when he's born again when he's old nature dies and a new nature sets in then he becomes a part of God a Son of God he gets new life and the Greek word Dar zoi which means the life of God and you become an offspring of God and God cannot hurt you without hurting himself you see what I mean let to stand together let me share this one with you that I read it to you last Sunday but it is just so powerful God is a lover God is love God so loved the world when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable here it is God wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering trying to get to some of your starchy Hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love it's all in love God so loved God is looking and trying and moving and begging and persuading to find a little heart that he can come into and coup and make love to him praise God can I read one more yes I have your permission you ain't goingon to get mad at me right Brothers Let's skip down to this next one I want you to notice the title of this sermon where I think Pentecost failed if it ever gets to a place that I couldn't put my arm around any brother that's working for the kingdom of God and recognize him as my brother I fear I'm backslid wow how sad it's becoming we're so divided and if we're not careful we'll disagree with this brother on that and that one on that and that one on that I'm cutting them off I ain't have nothing to do with them now that is that what brother Bram said well first cut them off from fellowship then we'll cut him off well he don't believe what the prophet said that's just the question about it he just don't believe what the prophet said he ain't no brother he ain't born of the [Music] word you see I asked y'all for your permission and you told me yeah it was a loaded gun right now you imagine brother Brenham saying that if he could not take a hold of a brother put his arm around him and recognize him as my brother I feel I'm backslid I'd be scared to stand on the platform and face evil spirits to know that I had Envy in my heart against any brother no matter who he is that's trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ or live a Christian Life if we disagree a million miles now think about how sensitive we are if we know somebody we're just two miles apart on theology we won't have nothing to do with them and if it was to go 10 miles I'm going to muster up all the grace I got I'm going to go 10 miles what about a million disagree a million miles upon theology if he loves the Lord Jesus he's my brother and it's my sister and we've draw those lines and if you can't love your brother who you've seen how can you love God you you've never seen old brother listen this church when love goes out God goes with it I want the correct theology don't you yeah I want the correct Doctrine but also want the right Spirit right and you can never get anywhere without Divine love and as You Love one another you love God and Word of Life Church said and Word of Life Church said help me Lord help me Lord God bless you let's bow our heads together thank you Lord Jesus thank thank you Lord for your word how many of you here today just by the raising of your hand no one looking around Lord I believe what I've heard is the truth but I need help with it father I need help what's becoming what your your word says I raise my hands Lord Jesus father we do love you today you know our hearts and I want Want to Love You Lord not as Donnie Reagan thinks you want to be loved when I married my wife over 51 years ago I wasn't a woman of course so I didn't think like a woman I didn't know how to love a woman so I made up in my mind as just a boy if I'm going to love her I'm going to have to understand her I'm going to have to listen when she doesn't know I'm listening I I want to have to listen to her wishes and her desires and what what she wants in life what she doesn't like in life I think you help me to do that Lord so I could be the right kind of a husband and as I look back I realize that's what you did to us so you had to become one of us to understand how could David forfeit a kingdom for adultery how could Moses be kept out of the land because of temper so you took on humanity and its Frailty and weakness to understand us the prophet gives us a little analogy of a of a story that a great king one day come to those in his court and said today you see me for your last time for quite a long time oh great king they said where will you go are you leaving us are you going somewhere else he said no no I I'll still be here but you just won't see me like this he said I want to understand my people better so I can serve them better so I want to chop wood with the wood Chopper want a plant with the planter and went through the list of things that he wanted to do so early the next morning they brought in these poppers G garments and the king the people watch as he lays aside his crown his Royal diadem and then watch him put on the clothes of a common man man and the prophet took that little analogy and said that was you you wanted to understand us so you become a man and you were tempted by women tempted by drinking tempted in all porns like we are even prayed in the garden father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me oh Jesus help us Lord I confess it before you and this people today it is not in my Humanity to love this way and I will say it about them it is not in their Humanity but that's the great thing you don't demand that we do it with our human love but with Theos and even when we receive Theos we must still die to our Humanity so the Theos can live out of us so Lord Lord God we're requesting now help us Lord no doubt many of these people have been born again they have the Holy Ghost Lord they may still battle with that old flesh but may Jesus live out of us as we get closer to the body change the prophet tells us in sort when he describes that translation he said I believe the people who go in the Rapture will be something like that before they go go Lord we got some moving up to do we got some dying to do help us Lord Jesus Oh Praise the Lord amen I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to is that your desire today there's just no more to give I want to love love to there's just no more love I could never ever out love [Music] maybe close our eyes raise our hands sing it together I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give

then we have the list but God looked at us and said I love you so much I want to make you lovable now that he's made us lovable the war begins on who gets our love read Ezekiel 16 see what God did to Israel you'll see a parallel of yourself you'll see a parallel to the church ages he found us we were unlovable we were wretched oh the temperament awful awful absolutely awful that we had and he made us lovable oh changed us and then the devil says oh she's very lovable now I would like to have her for my own but we say to Satan today no way devil he made us this way and he's going to get back the
