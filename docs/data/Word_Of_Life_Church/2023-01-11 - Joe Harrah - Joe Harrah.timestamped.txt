[44:10] in the atmosphere
[44:12] I don't think I've ever walked out here
[44:14] in this assembly and never
[44:16] walked up here when there wasn't a great
[44:18] atmosphere
[44:19] if you've ever had to stand here
[44:22] and understand I mean my knees are
[44:25] knocking now I mean it's
[44:27] it's not the the thing of standing up in
[44:30] front of people and talking I do that in
[44:32] the classroom
[44:34] but it's the burden of carrying the word
[44:37] you don't want to be a stumbling block
[44:39] and you don't want to get in the way of
[44:41] the Holy Spirit
[44:43] but my wife ever so often she'll send us
[44:46] the quote of the day
[44:48] while I sit back there this popped up on
[44:50] my phone
[44:51] Satan can settle the score
[44:55] when he finds out you've gone on without
[44:57] Jesus
[44:59] that's when Satan will get the church
[45:02] when you get so interested in something
[45:04] else
[45:06] besides prayer meetings
[45:08] when you get so interested that you're
[45:10] supposed to have a natural growth
[45:12] instead of a spiritual growth
[45:14] then remember Satan's on his Road he's
[45:16] caught up he's caught you without him
[45:20] brother Graham says oh God is my prayer
[45:22] wake up the church again is my prayer
[45:25] wake up the church again to
[45:26] old-fashioned all night prayer meeting
[45:29] wake the people to a spiritual
[45:32] atmosphere
[45:34] it takes that to bring the children into
[45:37] the kingdom
[45:38] it takes the atmosphere
[45:41] you can create you can sit in here and
[45:43] create your own atmosphere
[45:45] you could create one or you can allow
[45:46] him to create one
[45:49] if you created one that you don't want
[45:51] to lift your hands you don't want to
[45:53] clap you don't want to say man you don't
[45:55] want to praise the Lord You've created
[45:56] an atmosphere
[45:58] and it will affect those around you that
[45:59] want to
[46:01] so if we can put everything aside this
[46:04] is the only minute that matters in your
[46:06] life come on it's not what I have to say
[46:10] it's got nothing to do with what I got
[46:11] to say
[46:13] I I never have ever stood up here one
[46:15] single time and had an agenda of my own
[46:17] never
[46:18] if I ever do that I'm done
[46:20] I'm finished
[46:22] but if we can just look at it God this
[46:25] is your time my thoughts don't matter
[46:27] anything I can think anything I can do
[46:30] it doesn't matter it's what God can do
[46:33] through you and do through me tonight so
[46:34] if we can create an atmosphere that he
[46:36] feels welcome in
[46:38] that's my prayer to y'all
[46:40] um
[46:41] tonight is that you create an atmosphere
[46:44] that could pull I had a really short
[46:46] notice
[46:48] the shortest ever
[46:49] but
[46:51] after tonight me and brother Daryl is
[46:53] going to be best of friends whether he
[46:54] likes it or not so
[46:56] I might get some stuff
[46:59] so if you will turn in your Bibles
[47:01] tonight if you will
[47:03] be speaking a couple different places
[47:04] Genesis 45.
[47:07] verses 7 through 11.
[47:13] brother Donnie had texted me when I was
[47:15] leaving I'm sure they mentioned it but
[47:16] he asked me to y'all remember sister
[47:18] Erica well Donnie had to take her
[47:20] because brother Lance was in such a way
[47:22] that he couldn't go so we need to
[47:24] Remember by the Lance but sisterica is
[47:26] doing her treatment in the morning at
[47:27] Vanderbilt lift her up and it's just a
[47:29] Cheryl Ward I'm too I'm sure she could

[47:34] forget to mention them in your prayers
[47:36] and God sent me before you to preserve
[47:39] you of posterity in the earth to save
[47:41] your lives by great Deliverance
[47:43] and now it was not that you you that
[47:46] sent me hither but God
[47:48] Joseph's telling his brother and his God
[47:50] that sent me he hath made me a father to
[47:53] pharaoh and Lord to all his house and a
[47:55] ruler throughout all the land of Egypt

[49:20] people bless their needs everything they
[49:21] have neither we thank you for Jesus name
[49:23] amen you can be seated
[49:29] if you give me just a few minutes uh I'd
[49:31] like to talk on tonight living in Goshen
[49:36] we've heard brother Brandon refer to
[49:37] this a time or two but
[49:39] looking at Goshen we know that the
[49:41] background Story how Joseph
[49:44] is sold into slavery by his brothers and
[49:46] he's taken into to Egypt and becomes um
[49:50] topographer's servant there and then he
[49:52] gets thrown in prison and all these
[49:53] years that he's in in their and then
[49:56] famine comes to the land and we know the
[49:58] famine is two years in
[49:59] and the brothers are coming to Egypt to
[50:02] get to get food to take back
[50:05] and then we this is the point where in
[50:07] Genesis right after Joseph reveals
[50:09] himself and says I'm your brother
[50:11] go get my father and bring him here into
[50:13] Goshen
[50:15] and we'll look at it in a spiritual
[50:17] aspect too but
[50:19] Joseph gives his family an invitation to
[50:22] come to Goshen and we look at Goshen and
[50:24] we will look in here a little bit more
[50:26] you know and Egypt was the greatest land
[50:29] the greatest country in the land the
[50:31] richest they had everything
[50:33] but there's a little place that was set
[50:35] aside that was called Goshen because we
[50:36] we read in the scriptures how all the
[50:39] things that God the plagues that God was
[50:40] getting ready to put on Egypt
[50:43] because God was calling a people out
[50:46] but we look at Joseph's family we look
[50:48] at Jacob and and all his brothers they
[50:50] were poor they were at this point in
[50:53] poverty
[50:54] and Jacob was in poor health
[50:57] no doubt they were near starvation they
[51:00] had to travel such a far away to get
[51:02] food and then had to travel such a far
[51:04] away when they got back
[51:06] but I like what Joseph tells him he says
[51:08] come to Goshen and there I will nourish
[51:12] thee
[51:13] that's where I will nurse you come to
[51:16] the word
[51:18] and I will nourish you
[51:21] Come As You Are
[51:23] we look at people that says I can't I
[51:25] can't come to church I can't I don't
[51:27] believe you know I've done too many bad
[51:30] things Joseph told him to come as you
[51:32] are they were already in poverty he
[51:34] didn't say get your wealth up and then
[51:36] come
[51:37] come sick
[51:39] come with your burdens come with all
[51:42] that you have come to the word that's
[51:44] what he's telling them
[51:46] and so Joseph tells him says I will
[51:48] nourish thee
[51:50] Joseph had that power
[51:52] Pharaoh had given him power of all of
[51:55] Egypt
[51:57] nobody was eating without Joseph
[51:59] nobody was getting grained without
[52:01] Joseph saying they could have it
[52:05] you're not getting not one thing from
[52:07] this word but an intellectual
[52:08] understanding unless God gives it to you
[52:11] unless God reveals it to you all you
[52:15] will have is a intellectual intellectual
[52:17] understanding knowledge in your brain
[52:20] it will not move you anywhere
[52:24] you might you might make people think
[52:26] you're smart
[52:27] that you can quote the Bible that you
[52:29] can quote scriptures as you can quote
[52:31] brother Branham
[52:33] that's head knowledge but that's not the
[52:35] grain of Egypt
[52:38] it's just knowing that it's there
[52:41] you know it's there
[52:43] but you haven't ate any of it
[52:45] that's what Joseph was telling them they
[52:48] knew it was there because they was
[52:49] traveling to get it they would come to
[52:51] church once in a while
[52:53] they would come once in a while and
[52:55] Joseph would give them a little bit
[52:57] they would leave
[53:00] and they would get sickly they would
[53:01] still get poor
[53:03] Joseph said
[53:04] come to Goshen
[53:07] Exodus 81 I'm sorry there's not 81
[53:10] chapters Nexus they've been in Egypt a
[53:13] long time
[53:14] each Exodus 8 21-23 else shall thou will
[53:19] not let my people go behold I will send
[53:21] swarms of flies upon the Ebonite
[53:24] servants upon my people and into thy
[53:26] house the houses of Egypt shall be full
[53:29] of swarms of flies and also the ground
[53:31] where on they are now we're we're kind
[53:34] of jumping I give you a background we're
[53:35] jumping ahead of the people in Goshen at
[53:38] this point and they are in the word
[53:41] you're in the word
[53:44] God has kept plagues off you
[53:46] darkness is all around you Egypt is
[53:49] total darkness there's plagues all
[53:51] around you every day
[53:53] and there's light in Goshen
[53:57] the plagues were held off of Goshen
[54:00] for a little while
[54:02] don't think just because you're in this
[54:04] word and Goshen type in this word that
[54:06] you're not going to go through trials
[54:07] and tribulations
[54:09] you know and I I believe and I and I say
[54:12] it all the time and I hope it never
[54:14] becomes a cliche to me that there's
[54:16] light and ghosts when you look around
[54:17] and people say this is happening here
[54:19] this is happening here if possible war
[54:22] is going to happen in the politics is so
[54:24] corrupt and you look at that and I in my
[54:26] heart I said there's light in Goshen
[54:28] there's there's light and we'll look at
[54:30] how brother Brandon when he did the
[54:32] seven Church ages and he drew that
[54:33] sliver of life but don't don't let me
[54:35] get too far ahead he said and I will
[54:37] assist sever in that day the land of
[54:39] Goshen in which my people dwell that no
[54:41] swarm of flies shall be there to the end
[54:43] thou mayest know that I am the Lord in
[54:45] the midst of the earth and I will put a
[54:47] division between my people and thy
[54:50] people this is Moses telling Pharaoh
[54:52] God's going to put division between his
[54:54] people
[54:55] and your people
[54:57] he's put one up in this day
[54:59] God's put a division
[55:02] people know who you are
[55:05] God drew a line
[55:07] and said these are my people
[55:11] every you don't think every all the
[55:12] Egyptians knew who these people were
[55:14] they knew who they were
[55:16] they knew they were God's people you
[55:18] don't think they didn't know the the
[55:20] stories that they would tell that one
[55:22] day a deliverer is coming
[55:24] they're a rose of pharaoh that didn't
[55:25] know Joseph
[55:28] he didn't know Joseph but he knew there
[55:30] was something about these people
[55:32] that's why I keep in bondage Satan knows
[55:35] there's something about you
[55:37] why do you think he tries to keep you in
[55:39] bondage all the time
[55:40] what puts weight on you all the time
[55:42] burdens on you all the time because
[55:44] there's something about you God has
[55:46] divided you
[55:47] God has put you in a place
[55:49] that is the elite of the elite
[55:54] when the Rapture takes place
[55:56] you're not going to be the ones on the
[55:58] outside the city waiting for somebody
[56:00] inside the city to say you can have rain
[56:02] on your crops
[56:04] God says this is the best of the best
[56:06] and I saved him for last
[56:09] saved him for last
[56:16] but God was going to send them a prophet
[56:19] as we read in in Exodus unless lest you
[56:24] come to poverty
[56:27] why do you think you needed this word
[56:31] don't matter how much money you have
[56:33] what possessions you have what degrees
[56:36] you have
[56:37] without
[56:39] this grain of Egypt
[56:42] which at this time this is the only
[56:43] thing that would sustain them Joseph
[56:45] said you come and I will feed you
[56:49] I will pull you out of poverty
[56:52] without that you're the poorest man on
[56:54] the face of the Earth
[56:55] with it you're the richest
[56:58] it's just that simple
[57:00] but he said I will nourish you
[57:02] lest you fall into poverty the Lord said
[57:06] unto Moses stretch out thine hand
[57:07] towards heaven there might be Darkness
[57:09] across the land of Egypt even darkness
[57:12] that which may be felt
[57:14] Moses stretched forth his hands toward
[57:16] heaven and there was a thick darkness in
[57:17] all the land of Egypt three days
[57:19] they saw not one another neither Rose
[57:22] anyone from his place for three days but
[57:25] all of the children of Israel had light
[57:28] in their dwellings
[57:33] the plagues were kept off Goshen
[57:36] for a season
[57:39] you know what you you you we come up
[57:41] here we give a heart we see people give
[57:42] heart to the Lord they
[57:45] get up here on their knees Brothers come
[57:47] up and pray for them they want to get
[57:49] saved they want to get the Holy Ghost
[57:50] they get baptized
[57:52] they come out of the water we've all
[57:54] been there
[57:55] and it just seems like you're walking on
[57:57] clouds
[58:00] you can't believe that coming to God was
[58:04] going to be this great and this easy
[58:09] you've all been there if you've received
[58:11] the Holy Ghost if you've went through
[58:12] that you've been there
[58:15] because God's not going to give you meat
[58:17] the day you get the Holy Ghost
[58:22] yeah so for a season God's keeping his
[58:25] people
[58:26] he's keeping
[58:28] but what I want you to look at is
[58:30] a plague is coming to Goshen
[58:34] a plague's coming now we look at
[58:38] brother Branson question answers on
[58:39] Genesis
[58:41] now look back at the Old Testament when
[58:43] you see the plagues fall and they were
[58:44] in Egypt God was bringing his people out
[58:46] to the promised land
[58:48] Israel never received one plague
[58:51] just as the plagues before they went
[58:53] they went into Goshen is that right the
[58:56] Sun never dimmed out no mosquitoes come
[58:57] no frogs was there no lice was there no
[59:00] storms was there no lightning no killing
[59:03] on the cattle was there and everything
[59:04] they had was preserved in Goshen is that
[59:07] right it's a type of the church going
[59:09] just before the tribulation period
[59:14] when these things begin to come to pass
[59:16] lift up your head your Redemption draws
[59:20] an eye
[59:21] how many can say we see that in this day
[59:24] darkness is everywhere
[59:27] you go to work in Egypt
[59:30] you go to school in Egypt you shop in
[59:33] Egypt
[59:35] you have to live your life in Egypt
[59:38] but everywhere you walk you take that
[59:41] little sliver of light the brother
[59:43] Branham Drew in the layout of scene
[59:44] Church age you take that with you
[59:46] everywhere you go
[59:48] so you can say there's still light in
[59:51] Goshen
[59:53] so when the children of Israel came out
[59:55] of Egypt what happened to Goshen
[59:59] the land stayed there
[1:00:03] what made Goshen what it was went with
[1:00:07] them
[1:00:08] it went with them it didn't stay God
[1:00:11] didn't say see you I hope y'all make it
[1:00:12] to Canaan
[1:00:14] hope you make it to the Jordan River
[1:00:16] what made Goshen what it was
[1:00:19] this land of nourishment
[1:00:22] the pillar of the cloud the pillar fire
[1:00:24] that that rested over top of Goshen went
[1:00:27] with him when they left
[1:00:28] when you go to work every morning
[1:00:31] you go everywhere you go you wander
[1:00:33] through the dark darkest places in the
[1:00:36] land you have to work with some of the
[1:00:38] filthiest people sinful people in the
[1:00:40] land
[1:00:41] you're going to be the only part of
[1:00:43] Goshen they see
[1:00:46] a male probably never even hit the word
[1:00:48] Goshen
[1:00:51] what does the word Goshen mean
[1:00:55] s to draw near
[1:00:58] this was Joseph said I'll draw you near
[1:01:00] to me
[1:01:02] this is where I'm placing you
[1:01:04] when God pulled you into Goshen here it
[1:01:07] wasn't it wasn't that you wandered
[1:01:08] around till you found it
[1:01:10] they didn't find Goshen
[1:01:12] his family didn't find Goshen Joseph
[1:01:14] went to them and said I'm bringing you
[1:01:16] here you didn't wander in off the
[1:01:19] streets in here
[1:01:20] God had to come find you and say I want
[1:01:22] to bring you to this place that I've
[1:01:24] blessed and nourished it's the only
[1:01:27] place that you can you can eat and get
[1:01:29] nourished
[1:01:30] it's the only place where you could
[1:01:31] receive the word where you can receive
[1:01:33] blessings and you won't get it without
[1:01:35] me
[1:01:38] why did Pharaoh give it to him
[1:01:41] why did favor say yes you could have it
[1:01:45] it's yours
[1:01:47] because it was Joseph's brethren
[1:01:50] why did he give it to you
[1:01:53] why do you give it to me
[1:01:56] because you was Christ's brother
[1:01:59] he was your brother
[1:02:01] you were his sister
[1:02:03] anything he wanted for his family God
[1:02:06] said give it to him
[1:02:08] give it to him
[1:02:10] because you're his family
[1:02:12] had nothing to do with with just because
[1:02:15] they were somebody out in the world when
[1:02:18] he was Canaan Jacob was probably one of
[1:02:20] the richest men in Canaan
[1:02:24] probably the richest man to Pharaoh he
[1:02:26] was nobody
[1:02:27] if Joseph wasn't there Jacob was nothing
[1:02:31] nobody
[1:02:33] without Christ You're Nobody
[1:02:37] you think you're something because you
[1:02:38] might have a name in this message
[1:02:40] somewhere without him you were nothing
[1:02:42] you're a piece of dust
[1:02:44] but with him you are everything
[1:02:58] you ever wonder why we see the world
[1:02:59] fallen to pieces around us anymore
[1:03:03] it's fallen to pieces
[1:03:06] people are insane
[1:03:10] I would like to invite every single one
[1:03:13] in here
[1:03:14] if you get time
[1:03:16] go to your local police department go to
[1:03:18] your local sheriff's department and ride
[1:03:20] around with them for two weeks
[1:03:23] I gave him 23 years
[1:03:26] had all I could take
[1:03:31] and you hope along the way that you're a
[1:03:33] light to somebody that you can show
[1:03:35] Goshen to somebody
[1:03:39] if you want to see what this world is
[1:03:41] like
[1:03:43] spend two weeks riding around with your
[1:03:45] local law enforcement
[1:03:48] and then spend one week watching Fox
[1:03:50] News
[1:03:51] spend one week's walk to CNN News
[1:03:53] another week watching CBS because
[1:03:55] they're all different
[1:03:57] they've all got their own agenda their
[1:03:59] own thing that they push
[1:04:01] listen to your local politicians
[1:04:03] they're all corrupt
[1:04:06] they're corrupt listen
[1:04:08] I know
[1:04:10] I'm dealing with some local politicians
[1:04:12] some of the guys that work in in
[1:04:14] government in the city they could tell
[1:04:15] you
[1:04:19] it's going to hell
[1:04:22] it's going to hell
[1:04:25] and you're living the best time of your
[1:04:27] life
[1:04:29] the world's falling to pieces and this
[1:04:31] moment right here is the best time
[1:04:33] you've ever had in your life
[1:04:38] Jacob never knew he had it so good till
[1:04:40] he got the Goshen
[1:04:43] children of Israel never knew they had
[1:04:45] it so good until they got the Goshen
[1:04:47] then stuff happened there were Rosie
[1:04:50] Pharaoh that didn't know Joseph
[1:04:52] you know Joseph
[1:04:57] and then think trials test tribulations
[1:05:00] begin to come upon them
[1:05:04] I wonder how often
[1:05:07] right before they were able to leave
[1:05:10] how often they would go home and cry out
[1:05:15] to God bring us back the times when
[1:05:17] Joseph was here
[1:05:18] yeah
[1:05:19] bring back the Goshen of Joseph
[1:05:22] we get that stuck sometimes when David
[1:05:24] said restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:05:27] salvation we get stuck like that
[1:05:31] the children of Israel they remember the
[1:05:33] times of Joseph because people would
[1:05:35] tell them the stories
[1:05:37] how good it was when Joseph
[1:05:40] and no doubt these people right here
[1:05:42] been praying for 400 and something years
[1:05:44] for a deliverer and I wonder how many
[1:05:47] times their mind would go back and say I
[1:05:48] wonder what it was like
[1:05:51] wonder what it was like to be here when
[1:05:53] Joseph was here
[1:05:54] to eat of the grain of Egypt to not get
[1:05:56] our back beat
[1:05:59] we've been there
[1:06:01] we've all been there
[1:06:03] we get stuck in a rut it's Humanity God
[1:06:06] understands
[1:06:08] we get stuck in a rut sometimes
[1:06:11] we wonder
[1:06:13] where was the God that I had
[1:06:16] five years ago
[1:06:19] when I felt like I was on fire for God
[1:06:23] when he meant everything to me God
[1:06:25] didn't leave
[1:06:28] I didn't leave
[1:06:30] your life got in the way
[1:06:33] your life the things that you love got
[1:06:35] in the way your interests instead of
[1:06:37] trying to create atmosphere you can
[1:06:40] start your atmosphere out every single
[1:06:41] morning when you get up
[1:06:45] sometimes our self-interest get in the
[1:06:47] way
[1:06:48] and we get to thinking about those times
[1:06:49] that we take grain
[1:06:51] in Egypt
[1:06:53] we think where's brother Branham
[1:06:57] where's brother Branham
[1:06:59] where all the them brothers that brought
[1:07:02] the word back in the 80s and 90s
[1:07:05] those days were great
[1:07:07] he is still here
[1:07:11] he didn't leave
[1:07:13] the grain's still here
[1:07:16] sure you got tests and trials and
[1:07:18] tribulations in your life you got things
[1:07:20] in your life that drag you down
[1:07:23] but you're still in Goshen
[1:07:26] and he promised to deliver
[1:07:28] where was God going to bring him out of
[1:07:30] Goshen that's where he put him
[1:07:33] it's gonna bring them out
[1:07:36] do you realize
[1:07:37] Goshen was not a little
[1:07:40] town a little country outside of Egypt
[1:07:45] Goshen is right in the middle of Egypt
[1:07:50] it's in Egypt
[1:07:51] you don't travel from country to Country
[1:07:57] you're in Egypt in case nobody told you
[1:07:59] you're in Egypt Goshen
[1:08:01] you are walking living breathing
[1:08:05] the son light of Goshen that goes and
[1:08:08] sees people every day
[1:08:09] that when is with your life as we talk
[1:08:11] Sunday witnesses to people every day why
[1:08:13] there's a light that God left on in
[1:08:15] Goshen
[1:08:16] when brother Branham came in and put up
[1:08:19] the church the seven Church ages
[1:08:22] how many members why brother Brandon
[1:08:24] wrote that one brother Brandon drew that
[1:08:25] he said God put it in the heavens first
[1:08:26] right
[1:08:27] he put it in the heavens he said in the
[1:08:29] layout of saying church church age God
[1:08:31] put it in the heavens total darkness
[1:08:34] total darkness on that seventh phase
[1:08:37] God allowed brother Branham
[1:08:40] to draw that little sliver of light
[1:08:43] God allowed the prophet of this age to
[1:08:46] draw you
[1:08:48] in that little dark area
[1:08:51] that's what it was when he cleared off a
[1:08:54] little bitty space
[1:08:55] of Darkness
[1:08:57] that was you
[1:08:58] that was me
[1:09:02] that that's God
[1:09:07] that's God's grace
[1:09:09] if God left it total darkness there have
[1:09:12] been no hope
[1:09:13] there would have been no hope
[1:09:15] you still be total darkness I mean you
[1:09:17] wouldn't we wouldn't be able to see this
[1:09:18] word this message
[1:09:22] if you don't understand that go listen
[1:09:24] the man can turn on the light
[1:09:27] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:09:29] light seventh day messenger turn on the
[1:09:32] light and lay Odysseus
[1:09:33] it was total darkness
[1:09:39] I'm going too slow but I'm way behind
[1:09:43] recognizing your day and message
[1:09:46] and its message brother Brown said
[1:09:47] before the Seven Seals that hid all the
[1:09:49] Mysteries me not knowing what I was
[1:09:52] drawing on the board
[1:09:53] for the church church ages said God
[1:09:56] knows just by Vision I draw it not
[1:09:59] knowing that God a year and six months
[1:10:01] later was going to vindicate it in the
[1:10:03] skies
[1:10:04] by the moon and slip it across the
[1:10:06] national papers I didn't know that I
[1:10:09] didn't know there would be a mysterious
[1:10:10] blackout in the moon to represent this
[1:10:12] layout of seeing Church age
[1:10:15] now on the papers you only get the six
[1:10:18] ages it's because the layout of senior
[1:10:20] Church age was black completely out
[1:10:22] but if you would notice the spiritual
[1:10:24] application as God said it in the
[1:10:27] heavens
[1:10:28] when I said it here on Earth he said I
[1:10:32] said God allowed him
[1:10:34] they didn't make him God
[1:10:36] it didn't make him God
[1:10:38] but he said I set it up here on Earth
[1:10:40] God set it in the heavens
[1:10:45] I left a little bitty space as you see
[1:10:47] just a tiny little bit of light that was
[1:10:50] just before the very elected was to be
[1:10:53] called from the Earth
[1:10:55] we're in that little sliver of light
[1:10:57] right now
[1:10:58] right before the elect is to be called
[1:11:01] from the Earth
[1:11:03] that was his purpose of drawing and we
[1:11:06] are in there now
[1:11:09] if we weren't
[1:11:10] you there's no way that you would be
[1:11:12] here
[1:11:13] you wouldn't if there was no light we
[1:11:15] wouldn't be here
[1:11:17] I'm so glad God allowed that but when
[1:11:19] God put it in the heavens it was totally
[1:11:21] blacked out
[1:11:23] means maybe that the last one is called
[1:11:25] from that layout of seeing church that
[1:11:27] lays layout of singing age
[1:11:29] he says there could be a sermon on it
[1:11:32] he preached a few didn't he yeah
[1:11:37] yeah so we we look in
[1:11:39] that's the age we're in total darkness
[1:11:41] other than one little light
[1:11:48] so looking at Goshen
[1:11:50] God has allowed all these trials these
[1:11:52] tribulations these plagues
[1:11:54] to avoid Goshen
[1:11:57] dumping it and dumping it on Egypt
[1:12:00] everywhere but Goshen
[1:12:05] but tribulations come and negotia
[1:12:07] there's a plague
[1:12:09] coming to Goshen
[1:12:12] we've seen it in this age
[1:12:15] we've seen it in this age
[1:12:20] brother Brian said knoweth it not
[1:12:23] he said there will be hideous sights
[1:12:24] upon the Earth
[1:12:26] locusts with hair like women
[1:12:28] long hair to taunt them women that cut
[1:12:30] their hair
[1:12:32] teeth like Lion Stingers in their tail
[1:12:34] like scorpions they would torment men
[1:12:36] for months
[1:12:38] just wait till we get into opening them
[1:12:40] plagues and seals in them seven Thunders
[1:12:41] watch what takes place oh brother you
[1:12:43] better get to Goshen while there's time
[1:12:45] to get to Goshen don't pay any attention
[1:12:48] to outside
[1:12:51] you know
[1:12:54] we say don't pay attention to outside
[1:12:56] you know don't don't we can't help but
[1:12:58] see the things that's around us we hear
[1:13:00] the news we re if you read the paper the
[1:13:02] media you see it all and I don't think
[1:13:04] brother Brandon was just talking about
[1:13:06] that
[1:13:08] and I might be wrong this is just my
[1:13:10] opinion this is not a Doctrine I'm not
[1:13:13] saying
[1:13:16] don't pay attention to the things that
[1:13:19] Satan puts in your life
[1:13:21] as an individual
[1:13:23] that's the stuff that's outside the Holy
[1:13:25] Ghost
[1:13:27] don't pay attention to that
[1:13:28] the Holy Ghost has you sealed
[1:13:31] Satan's job we've said it a million
[1:13:33] times Satan's job is to put that on you
[1:13:36] his job is to go before God day and
[1:13:39] night and and accuse you
[1:13:41] right that's his job
[1:13:44] so he's going to do that brother Brown
[1:13:46] says don't pay attention to this on the
[1:13:48] outside
[1:13:49] focus on that Holy Ghost
[1:13:51] focus on Goshen
[1:13:58] I I apologize for reading too so many
[1:14:01] quotes here I didn't know I really
[1:14:03] didn't know I had this many it's what
[1:14:04] you get for Russia
[1:14:06] now to reject the truth when it's
[1:14:08] presented that's the Seal of the Christ
[1:14:10] when your ears are sealed you'll turn
[1:14:12] away from God
[1:14:13] very religious
[1:14:15] the scripture says heady high-minded
[1:14:17] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:14:20] God truce Breakers High false accusers
[1:14:23] incontinent despisers of those that are
[1:14:25] good
[1:14:26] having a form of godliness all forms
[1:14:28] very fundamental the forms of godliness
[1:14:30] and brother Branham said at one point
[1:14:32] spiritual uh when you get a religious
[1:14:35] spirit on you that's the worst spirit
[1:14:37] that you can get
[1:14:39] worse than any other kind of worse than
[1:14:40] a spirit of lust worse than any other
[1:14:42] kind of spirit you can get a spirit a
[1:14:45] religious spirit
[1:14:46] it makes you think you know this word
[1:14:48] frontwards and backwards you know who's
[1:14:50] wrong you know who's right
[1:14:52] you're always focusing on who's living
[1:14:53] their life wrong what their kids are
[1:14:55] doing their kids shouldn't be doing this
[1:14:57] I can show you in the word where brother
[1:14:59] Brandon said you shouldn't do this then
[1:15:01] you shouldn't do that
[1:15:04] you're focusing outside
[1:15:07] focus on the inside
[1:15:10] that's that's where your Redemption lies
[1:15:13] that's where you'll take a Rapture from
[1:15:16] that's the only thing you're taking with
[1:15:18] you so you why we don't need to pay
[1:15:19] attention to all this other other stuff
[1:15:22] here
[1:15:24] foreign
[1:15:25] all the forms very fundamental the forms
[1:15:27] of godliness but deny the power thereof
[1:15:29] from such turn away
[1:15:31] don't look at it ignore it
[1:15:35] for this is the sort that go from house
[1:15:37] to house lead silly women Laden with
[1:15:39] divers lusts never able to come to the
[1:15:42] knowledge of the truth
[1:15:45] that's right
[1:15:47] brother Bram said that's where my faith
[1:15:49] is anchored
[1:15:51] what the Bible said it's in God's word
[1:15:53] not in tradition of men but in God's
[1:15:55] word that's where I put my stand 23
[1:15:57] years ago
[1:16:02] so Joseph
[1:16:05] I want to jump ahead I'm I'm going to be
[1:16:08] too late here and y'all got to go to bed
[1:16:11] so
[1:16:13] we know death is coming
[1:16:16] death is coming to Goshen
[1:16:18] so this is a new something new for the
[1:16:21] children of Israel and God tells Moses
[1:16:22] you need to tell them
[1:16:24] after all these plagues
[1:16:26] the same death that's coming to Egypt is
[1:16:29] coming to Goshen
[1:16:31] what did you tell them do you need to
[1:16:33] apply the token he tells them what to do
[1:16:34] to apply the token we'll look at in a
[1:16:36] second
[1:16:37] but
[1:16:39] Goshen was not exempt from all the
[1:16:42] plagues
[1:16:46] death was coming
[1:16:48] death came
[1:16:49] to many in this message
[1:16:53] they died spiritually
[1:16:55] because they didn't do what God told him
[1:16:57] to do what did God tell him to do
[1:16:59] to apply the token
[1:17:01] they didn't apply the token
[1:17:04] they had an intellectual understanding
[1:17:06] of the word and then when it they seemed
[1:17:09] that they were thinking they were things
[1:17:10] in Egypt that they were missing out on
[1:17:13] they went back
[1:17:16] and they died
[1:17:19] spiritually dead
[1:17:24] and it was freely given
[1:17:30] you didn't have to work for the token
[1:17:33] you didn't have to work it up it's
[1:17:34] freely given
[1:17:36] God said it's yours
[1:17:40] brother said in the Israel slain lamb
[1:17:43] was the requirement of Jehovah
[1:17:46] the blood was a token that the job had
[1:17:48] been done
[1:17:50] that God required for Redemption from
[1:17:52] Egypt to get go to the promised land he
[1:17:54] required a slain animal and that animal
[1:17:55] must have the blood of the dead animal
[1:17:57] must be put upon the little on the door
[1:17:59] that stood for the token the thing that
[1:18:01] Jehovah had required had been fulfilled
[1:18:05] the lamb
[1:18:07] not the lamb was the token the lamb
[1:18:09] wasn't the token
[1:18:12] if that lamb had stayed alive
[1:18:17] and listen if the land was a token all
[1:18:19] you had to do was put it in your house
[1:18:21] and hold it in there
[1:18:23] that's all you had to do if the lamb was
[1:18:25] the token
[1:18:28] well it wasn't the lamb it was the life
[1:18:31] the blood the Life Source that God
[1:18:33] required
[1:18:36] that stood for the token the thing that
[1:18:39] Jehovah had required had been fulfilled
[1:18:41] the not the land was the token the blood
[1:18:44] was the token the life had gone out from
[1:18:46] the sacrifice and now the blood was the
[1:18:49] token his orders had been carried out
[1:18:51] the blood stood for the token the sign
[1:18:53] the disbeliever had done exactly what
[1:18:55] the requirement was that was the token
[1:18:57] all right seeing the believer worship
[1:18:59] was then identified with the sacrifice
[1:19:03] you realize this couldn't just be any
[1:19:04] animal
[1:19:06] God didn't tell them tell Moses to tell
[1:19:08] them
[1:19:09] I need some animal blood tell them to go
[1:19:12] find an animal to kill that animal and
[1:19:15] put the blood on the doorpost
[1:19:19] God had Specific Instructions
[1:19:21] it has to be a lamb
[1:19:24] it has to be a lamb God required a lamb
[1:19:28] and we know what the type is with that
[1:19:30] you know looking at that
[1:19:32] you know they had they had been doing
[1:19:34] sacrifices of their whole their life
[1:19:37] that was their life was sacrifice every
[1:19:39] day every year whatever they would have
[1:19:41] to do sacrifices this was something new
[1:19:44] this was something different
[1:19:47] this was doing a sacrifice before a
[1:19:50] burnt offering and now they're actually
[1:19:52] taking the blood
[1:19:54] and applying it to their house
[1:19:57] they were taking the blood and applying
[1:19:59] it to their house
[1:20:01] you know look you look at it
[1:20:03] I wonder if a father at some time you
[1:20:05] know he takes the slam and this lamb has
[1:20:07] become the family pet
[1:20:09] this is his son's favorite lamb
[1:20:14] there's not a blemish on it this lamb
[1:20:17] has a name they've given it a name
[1:20:19] he sleeps with them
[1:20:22] everywhere the Sun goes He follows him
[1:20:26] and he has the father has to tell them I
[1:20:29] have to kill this lamb
[1:20:35] you're gonna have to explain he's gonna
[1:20:36] have to explain to him why
[1:20:39] because if I don't kill this lamb
[1:20:41] you will die
[1:20:44] you will die
[1:20:46] that's why Christ had to die for you
[1:20:48] if Christ if God didn't take his first
[1:20:51] born lamb
[1:20:53] that was without blemish
[1:20:57] do you think Christ could have just
[1:20:58] stayed alive and said Okay I I forgive
[1:21:01] the whole world from today
[1:21:04] forever I forgive him
[1:21:08] no life was given
[1:21:11] God required blood
[1:21:14] he required blood that's what we was
[1:21:17] talking about the other day when when
[1:21:18] Satan takes that book
[1:21:20] of your sins before God because we're
[1:21:22] told he's an accuser of the Brethren day
[1:21:24] and night he comes up to God he's saying
[1:21:26] look what they did look what he did
[1:21:28] right here
[1:21:30] he's telling God you did this you fell
[1:21:32] short here you got something on the
[1:21:34] Internet that you weren't supposed to be
[1:21:35] looking at look what he done it
[1:21:37] he said something to somebody he
[1:21:39] shouldn't have said he offended another
[1:21:41] brother he offended another sister
[1:21:42] they're talking about the pastor they're
[1:21:44] doing this they're doing that
[1:21:47] you know when I was studying that I got
[1:21:49] to thinking you know how frustrating it
[1:21:51] is sometimes when you see something
[1:21:52] somebody else don't
[1:21:55] yeah you're saying look
[1:21:59] my father-in-law Jack he can see a deer
[1:22:01] 14 000 miles away
[1:22:04] he can he's got the best eyes I've ever
[1:22:06] seen he'll say if there's one up there
[1:22:08] and you're looking you can't see nothing
[1:22:11] and you're trying to tell people hey
[1:22:12] look at that look at that deer up here
[1:22:14] on that Hill are you look I can't see it
[1:22:15] and you get frustrated
[1:22:17] because they can't see it how frustrated
[1:22:19] does Satan get when God can't see what
[1:22:22] he's showing him
[1:22:24] look it's just playing God you see it
[1:22:26] they done it God says they never done it
[1:22:29] I don't see nothing
[1:22:36] I love it when Satan gets frustrated
[1:22:40] I love it God loves it when Satan's
[1:22:43] frustrated God just laughs at him
[1:22:45] you showed me the same thing yesterday
[1:22:49] you showed it to me last year
[1:22:53] it was going to come a time when he
[1:22:55] ain't gonna be able to show him anything
[1:22:57] because you won't be long Satan won't be
[1:22:59] able to see it
[1:23:01] but his job is for you to get focused on
[1:23:04] it
[1:23:05] how can you see something that God can't
[1:23:07] see
[1:23:09] he seen from one eternity to the next
[1:23:13] there's nothing he hasn't seen there is
[1:23:15] nothing God hasn't seen but he can't see
[1:23:18] your faults
[1:23:21] so why do we keep bringing them up
[1:23:25] why are you helping Satan with his job
[1:23:28] you're basically telling him hey satan
[1:23:31] go show this to God this is what I did
[1:23:34] that's what you're doing you're helping
[1:23:35] him when you bring it up you talk about
[1:23:37] it
[1:23:38] you're telling him go look what I did
[1:23:41] shame on us
[1:23:45] you're reading Satan's book about
[1:23:46] yourself
[1:23:48] you're reading it about yourself
[1:23:52] and when God flips through it
[1:23:54] it's all Blake why because a lamb died
[1:24:00] and when that lamb died he spilled his
[1:24:02] blood on every page
[1:24:05] how in the world are you reading it
[1:24:08] how can you read it
[1:24:12] how many times does God have to tell us
[1:24:14] every day
[1:24:16] I don't see anything you did
[1:24:19] why do you bring this up before me
[1:24:21] because I don't know nothing about it
[1:24:24] he sees the blood and here's this Death
[1:24:26] Angel getting ready to come to every
[1:24:29] single House of every single believer
[1:24:34] he's coming to your house
[1:24:38] the Death Angel is coming to your house
[1:24:39] and I don't mean natural death
[1:24:45] foreign
[1:24:46] you better have
[1:24:48] the Lamb's blood
[1:24:51] on your house
[1:24:54] amen you better have the blood
[1:24:57] you'll die spiritually
[1:25:00] you could come every single day to
[1:25:02] church if we had Church seven days a
[1:25:04] week
[1:25:06] 24 7. you can have that message in your
[1:25:09] little earpod with your iPod and you can
[1:25:11] listen to it all day
[1:25:13] and finally won't be long you can quote
[1:25:15] it without listening to it so you start
[1:25:16] reciting it to yourself
[1:25:20] without the blood
[1:25:22] you are going to die with a lot of head
[1:25:25] knowledge
[1:25:27] you are going to die you are starving
[1:25:29] yourself to death of an it with an empty
[1:25:31] silo
[1:25:33] you're starving yourself if you do not
[1:25:36] have the blood of the Lamb applied on
[1:25:39] your house you're starving
[1:25:42] it's that plain and simple
[1:25:44] how do you know you say oh brother Joe I
[1:25:46] don't know the blood supply what's your
[1:25:48] desires
[1:25:50] what's the greatest desire of your life
[1:25:51] ask yourself that what do I desire more
[1:25:53] than anything I know what mine is to
[1:25:56] please God more than anything but as
[1:25:58] soon as I wake up I want to please God
[1:25:59] when I go through my day I want to
[1:26:01] please God
[1:26:03] I don't know what else to tell you other
[1:26:04] than that
[1:26:06] I want to please God
[1:26:08] if you're pleasing God you're doing
[1:26:10] everything right
[1:26:16] if you're not pleasing God
[1:26:19] you might not have the token
[1:26:22] you might not have the token
[1:26:25] because with the token
[1:26:27] all God can see is everything's pleasing
[1:26:30] to him in your life
[1:26:32] because he has to look through the blood
[1:26:35] every time I I think every time I think
[1:26:38] of the blood but the Larry I think about
[1:26:39] when brother Brandon was at that Diner
[1:26:41] God took him behind the door
[1:26:44] he says that's the sins of the world
[1:26:45] that must have been a lot of stuff that
[1:26:47] was hitting Jesus in the face to brother
[1:26:49] Branham think that's the sins of the
[1:26:50] world
[1:26:53] what do you say that's just yours
[1:26:57] that's just yours
[1:26:59] if that was the prophet how much is mine
[1:27:01] hitting him in the face how much is
[1:27:03] yours hitting him in the face
[1:27:05] what's hitting him in the face what is
[1:27:07] hitting him in the face
[1:27:11] every day you get out of bed
[1:27:13] you were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:27:15] came to the world speaking lies this
[1:27:17] human flesh makes mistakes every single
[1:27:19] day
[1:27:19] there's nothing you can do about it but
[1:27:21] pray God forgive me God forgive me it's
[1:27:24] like I told Brother Jimmy Whitson long
[1:27:26] time ago I said brother Jimmy
[1:27:28] this human flesh
[1:27:31] one millisecond one little millisecond
[1:27:35] before you go in a Rapture you might
[1:27:37] make a mistake
[1:27:41] really
[1:27:43] disagree
[1:27:44] that's quiet
[1:27:46] you're not taking this flesh with you
[1:27:48] one millisecond before the Rapture takes
[1:27:50] place that's one millisecond you're
[1:27:51] still a human
[1:27:54] that's one millisecond you still need
[1:27:56] the blood
[1:27:57] that's one millisecond you better have
[1:27:59] the token because if you lose the token
[1:28:02] one millisecond before the Rapture you
[1:28:05] ain't going
[1:28:10] keep it checked up
[1:28:12] Lord keep that token checked up in my
[1:28:14] life
[1:28:21] only way anyone could tell that a house
[1:28:23] belonged to under the blood because the
[1:28:25] chemistry was on the doors
[1:28:29] who does that house belong to Child of
[1:28:31] God
[1:28:33] how the chemistry of the blood
[1:28:37] simple as that
[1:28:39] that's how we know what a house the
[1:28:41] house that God dwells in
[1:28:42] how did we know that God dwells in your
[1:28:44] house the chemistry of the blood in your
[1:28:46] life
[1:28:48] the token God will not dwell in a house
[1:28:51] without the token
[1:28:54] he won't he won't do it
[1:29:00] they pass through the death angel had to
[1:29:01] look and see the blood now again it was
[1:29:03] the type of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:05] the literal blood of Jesus could not
[1:29:07] come upon each one of us
[1:29:09] because he had only so much blood in his
[1:29:11] body
[1:29:14] and it dripped off out his body and to
[1:29:17] the ground two thousand years ago
[1:29:19] but it wasn't to be for a token Jesus
[1:29:22] literal blood was not the token
[1:29:27] what was it the token
[1:29:29] the life
[1:29:31] the life them little licks of fire that
[1:29:33] came up on them 120 in the upper room
[1:29:35] the life
[1:29:38] he's still sending that life down
[1:29:40] tonight
[1:29:41] he's still sending it it's the same life
[1:29:43] that fell upon them that 120th Upper
[1:29:46] Room he's still sinning it's the same
[1:29:48] one that you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:29:49] driving down the road by yourself one
[1:29:51] night you didn't know where it came from
[1:29:53] you've been praying for it for years
[1:29:56] you might have been sitting at home by
[1:29:58] yourself you might have been sitting in
[1:30:00] church you might have been at work
[1:30:03] but something came over you like nothing
[1:30:04] you ever felt before
[1:30:06] it was God depositing that life down
[1:30:09] inside of you you've been baptized
[1:30:11] you've been sitting under the word your
[1:30:13] whole life but something changed you
[1:30:15] there's something you probably can't
[1:30:17] tell me when you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:30:20] I can remember the day I did in Happy
[1:30:23] Valley Church
[1:30:25] that's why that place will always have a
[1:30:26] place in my heart
[1:30:29] I think I'm sitting behind by Louie
[1:30:31] and Daniel ball did something come over
[1:30:34] me
[1:30:35] I still ain't acting like that again
[1:30:37] shame on me
[1:30:40] but I can tell you when I can't tell you
[1:30:43] the message that was preached can't take
[1:30:45] the songs that was sung but I can tell
[1:30:47] you that feeling and when I get to think
[1:30:49] about it sometimes I feel it all over
[1:30:50] again brother Harry I can still feel it
[1:30:53] it's a life
[1:30:54] it was because the token was applied a
[1:30:58] lamb had to die
[1:31:00] something had to die that you could have
[1:31:02] life
[1:31:05] it dripped off out of his body into the
[1:31:07] ground two thousand years ago it wasn't
[1:31:09] to be the token the life was in the
[1:31:11] blood
[1:31:12] that's the token I'll prove it to you in
[1:31:14] a minute
[1:31:16] it is a token that's come upon each of
[1:31:18] us to show we've been identified our
[1:31:20] sacrifice have carried out Jehovah's
[1:31:22] requests
[1:31:26] there's some that
[1:31:28] claim
[1:31:30] this last stage that they had the token
[1:31:33] the thing that they claim to have the
[1:31:36] token they threw it right back in God's
[1:31:37] face
[1:31:40] they threw it back
[1:31:44] they denounced the message of his age
[1:31:47] some of them stayed in pulpits
[1:31:51] preaching garbage
[1:31:53] with no life
[1:31:55] it's a dead message
[1:31:58] if you ain't got the token
[1:32:00] it's a dead message
[1:32:04] they don't live it that way they they
[1:32:06] feel like it's okay to live however you
[1:32:07] want to that God don't don't don't look
[1:32:09] at what you what you wear what you look
[1:32:11] like
[1:32:12] I had a great friend of mine many years
[1:32:14] ago
[1:32:15] just to show what kind of understanding
[1:32:17] that some people have
[1:32:19] he said let me ask you a question I said
[1:32:20] what's that
[1:32:23] he said
[1:32:25] how could God
[1:32:28] know how long my hair is if he's way up
[1:32:31] there
[1:32:32] and I'm way down here
[1:32:36] I felt sad
[1:32:38] I felt sad
[1:32:40] that is sad
[1:32:42] the people that was raised in this
[1:32:44] message and he was
[1:32:46] his dad was a pastor
[1:32:50] still is wonderful Godly Man
[1:32:55] and that's what he said how can God
[1:32:57] see how long my hair is if he's way up
[1:32:59] there how can he see this part down
[1:33:03] if that's our general conception of what
[1:33:05] God is
[1:33:07] then to us he's nothing
[1:33:10] God is a person
[1:33:14] turning look beside you
[1:33:18] you'll see God
[1:33:21] can you look at your own life right now
[1:33:24] don't raise your hands or nothing but
[1:33:26] can you look at your own life
[1:33:28] and say how I am every day when I get up
[1:33:32] when I go to work when I go do whatever
[1:33:34] I got to do through the day
[1:33:36] am I assured that this is the token I am
[1:33:39] the brother but I'm saying we are the
[1:33:40] token on display
[1:33:43] are you the token on display can people
[1:33:46] look at you and say
[1:33:48] that's the token
[1:33:50] I want to be like them I want my life to
[1:33:54] be like their life
[1:33:59] like I say you know thoughts and
[1:34:00] failures
[1:34:01] that token on the door when they put the
[1:34:03] little over the blood on the lid on the
[1:34:05] doorpost it did not give them eternal
[1:34:08] life
[1:34:10] it saved them from the death angel
[1:34:13] what happened to them saying people 40
[1:34:14] in 40 years
[1:34:16] they died
[1:34:18] some of them God killed them why he put
[1:34:20] another image before him
[1:34:22] the same God that saved him from the
[1:34:24] death angel
[1:34:28] you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:34:31] on your flesh
[1:34:33] you can have it on your flesh
[1:34:38] but it won't always stay there if it
[1:34:40] ain't sealed right here
[1:34:41] it's got to be sealed
[1:34:43] if if they if they you know I've been
[1:34:46] reading one thing I love about God and
[1:34:48] the children of Israel
[1:34:49] I've been reading Jeremiah I've been
[1:34:51] reading the Bible through again and I
[1:34:52] just got through Jeremiah and Ezekiel
[1:34:55] you read when you read them on the in
[1:34:57] the prophets you're prophesying to
[1:34:59] Israel those books
[1:35:01] are God using Jeremiah and Ezekiel and
[1:35:03] Nehemiah and these different ones
[1:35:04] prophesying to Israel telling Israel
[1:35:07] he's going to destroy him you become an
[1:35:10] Abomination you become a stench in my
[1:35:13] nostrils
[1:35:15] I'm going to destroy you before your
[1:35:16] enemies
[1:35:17] and God's telling them this and you read
[1:35:20] three verses down and he says but you
[1:35:21] are my people
[1:35:24] and I will have you unto myself and I
[1:35:26] will have with you a covenant
[1:35:32] God didn't want to destroy me he loved
[1:35:33] him
[1:35:35] but God had to put things on him so many
[1:35:38] times
[1:35:39] look at the kings in the lineage of
[1:35:42] David through the lineage that brought
[1:35:44] Christ
[1:35:45] the kings that did Evil inside the Lord
[1:35:46] and God would send the prophet to him
[1:35:48] and they would straighten up for little
[1:35:49] ways why because God loved them
[1:35:53] God loved him
[1:35:56] that's why he lets you have the Holy
[1:35:58] Spirit permanently in here you don't
[1:36:01] have to sacrifice every day you don't
[1:36:04] have to go kill a lamb or a calf every
[1:36:06] day
[1:36:07] because he loved you so much
[1:36:10] he said I'm going to make this permanent
[1:36:13] the token was temporary in Goshen
[1:36:17] it was temporary
[1:36:20] they weren't taking it with them
[1:36:22] they weren't ripping them door posts off
[1:36:24] and that little they had the blood on it
[1:36:26] and carrying it with them out of Egypt
[1:36:28] they weren't doing it
[1:36:32] but God said you can
[1:36:35] you can it's a free gift
[1:36:38] you know it's it's if you're a child of
[1:36:41] God listen
[1:36:43] you don't have to work up the Holy Ghost
[1:36:46] God there's the young young man we did
[1:36:48] question answers several years ago I
[1:36:51] think we said brother Rob's house
[1:36:53] and brother brother Donny had some of
[1:36:55] his different ministers me and brother
[1:36:57] John by the way that's not thanked
[1:36:58] brother Terry and brother Lance do some
[1:37:00] some question and answers to split it up
[1:37:02] and I had the Holy Ghost I think brother
[1:37:04] Lance had the godhead or something and
[1:37:06] this one of the questions was
[1:37:10] you know basically how do I get the Holy
[1:37:12] Ghost there was a young man there and
[1:37:13] that was his question how do I get the
[1:37:15] Holy Ghost and I asked him I ain't gonna
[1:37:18] say who he was he probably knows who he
[1:37:19] is right now he's a big boy
[1:37:21] I said you like cookies
[1:37:24] he said yeah didn't you Zach
[1:37:29] I said you like cookies
[1:37:31] I said yeah what do you do if you want a
[1:37:32] cookie what do you do brother Zach if
[1:37:34] you want a cookie you go get it
[1:37:37] where do you put the cookies at they're
[1:37:38] in a pantry you go open the door and
[1:37:40] pantry and get a cookie
[1:37:43] the Holy Ghost is that simple God said
[1:37:46] it's there freely
[1:37:48] when you got gifts under your tree at
[1:37:50] Christmas if you have a tree
[1:37:52] we'll leave that right there
[1:37:55] you get you're at a birthday party and
[1:37:58] the whole table is covered with your
[1:37:59] gifts they're yours
[1:38:03] all you have to do is open them
[1:38:07] it's that simple guess what they have
[1:38:10] your name on it
[1:38:12] God put your name and the token together
[1:38:15] before the foundation of the world he
[1:38:17] puts your name on it
[1:38:19] he said here it is
[1:38:21] go get it
[1:38:23] and we walk around it for years
[1:38:26] we walk around it
[1:38:29] I'll never get that I'll never have it
[1:38:32] why did we say that why did we do that
[1:38:34] because we focus on this book that
[1:38:37] Satan's got everything written we focus
[1:38:39] on that and Satan keeps saying you can't
[1:38:41] have it you can't have it the token
[1:38:43] wasn't for you it wasn't for you
[1:38:45] and you're reading that
[1:38:47] and God says if you could just look at
[1:38:49] it through my eyes you will see nothing
[1:38:53] nothing but your name
[1:38:55] and the token have been married together
[1:38:58] that's all it is
[1:39:00] and we complicate it
[1:39:04] we complicated
[1:39:05] and it's not
[1:39:07] I urge you tonight if you don't have the
[1:39:09] Holy Ghost just reach over and get it
[1:39:12] just get it there's got to be a desire
[1:39:16] when I was you I was 19 20 years old
[1:39:19] I was with my uncle
[1:39:22] was in Illinois was pastoring in
[1:39:24] Illinois what time we drove I rode to
[1:39:26] Kentucky and back with him
[1:39:29] and I was struggling
[1:39:31] I said I'm Gloria
[1:39:33] and this was the simplest
[1:39:36] I'd ever heard it I said
[1:39:39] I don't want to know if I have the Holy
[1:39:40] Ghost
[1:39:44] he said what's your desires
[1:39:48] and at that time I had more desires than
[1:39:50] being right here
[1:39:52] I was all about myself
[1:39:55] I was but I read to you other well
[1:39:58] earlier brother Brian said when you have
[1:40:00] interest
[1:40:01] that are more of the Natural Body
[1:40:02] instead of the spiritual body
[1:40:05] and I had those
[1:40:07] but I had to get rid of them first
[1:40:10] they stood between me and my birthday
[1:40:11] gift
[1:40:14] they stood between me and my Christmas
[1:40:16] gift
[1:40:18] I had to find a way around them
[1:40:21] I had to realize
[1:40:23] all I got to do is open it
[1:40:26] they're sitting right there
[1:40:28] and I'm letting a lie of the devil keep
[1:40:31] me from walking over there and getting
[1:40:32] it
[1:40:35] when you think that you can't have the
[1:40:37] Holy Ghost because of the bad things in
[1:40:39] your life you are listening to a lie of
[1:40:42] the devil
[1:40:44] it's a lie
[1:40:46] you're making this job easy
[1:40:52] I'm going to go to it let's stand I
[1:40:55] didn't sorry about the time
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:11] if it was good enough just to be in
[1:41:13] Goshen they'd never had to leave
[1:41:16] if it was good enough
[1:41:18] God said there's darkness in Egypt
[1:41:20] there's light here
[1:41:23] it's good enough
[1:41:24] we don't have to leave
[1:41:27] so where you are in your life right now

[1:41:39] might take 40 years

[1:41:44] don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:41:45] don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:41:47] but God promised them a Promised Land if
[1:41:50] they are seed they will cross Jordan

[1:41:55] Jordan

[1:41:59] right down there in the water
[1:42:01] and stop the water and they crossed
[1:42:04] don't get caught up
[1:42:06] and being in Goshen
[1:42:08] don't be caught up and I'll go to Word
[1:42:10] of Life Church
[1:42:12] brother Donny's my pastor you can caught
[1:42:14] up in that all you want
[1:42:17] you know I was I was thinking sitting
[1:42:20] back there after I preached
[1:42:23] speaking of brother Donnie
[1:42:25] after I preached Sunday I
[1:42:27] I just felt like you know what if I had
[1:42:30] a defended anybody
[1:42:31] I'd apologize I don't apologize for what
[1:42:33] I said
[1:42:35] but if I offended anybody
[1:42:38] I I sincerely apologize
[1:42:41] because I never would never do that but
[1:42:42] I'll Never Compromise
[1:42:45] this message the the ministry the head
[1:42:48] Ministry that we're on over this church
[1:42:50] has taught me one thing
[1:42:52] one thing there is zero tolerance for
[1:42:54] compromise
[1:42:56] that's what this our pastor has stood
[1:42:58] for he will not compromise no matter
[1:42:59] what
[1:43:00] and if I'm if I'm to be a help under
[1:43:02] that Ministry I can't compromise
[1:43:05] I would never intend to hurt any
[1:43:07] feelings
[1:43:09] I told Brother Terry one time was your
[1:43:10] military if God told me
[1:43:12] this is from my heart if God told me
[1:43:14] that's your last sermon I don't need to
[1:43:15] use you anymore I'd be the happiest man
[1:43:17] in the world
[1:43:18] people that want to get up and do this I
[1:43:20] have no idea why
[1:43:22] no idea
[1:43:24] get sick at your stomach sitting back
[1:43:26] there
[1:43:27] you weaken the knees
[1:43:29] you want to leave
[1:43:31] I've come a time or two I think brother
[1:43:33] Dowell runs me back in the in the back
[1:43:35] door one day
[1:43:37] I wasn't really leaving but I stepped
[1:43:39] outside and he said hey get back in
[1:43:40] there
[1:43:45] but why would we compromise on something
[1:43:47] that God has given us
[1:43:49] when he's put the token into our life
[1:43:51] I said this is the way that you'll make
[1:43:54] the Promised Land
[1:43:56] I haven't even gotten everything I was
[1:43:59] going to get but I think I got enough
[1:44:03] you know I was thinking
[1:44:05] I've studied this and I wrote a little
[1:44:06] note here
[1:44:09] I wonder what people Passing Strangers
[1:44:12] that passage from Goshen because we know
[1:44:14] our favor on him was in the the city
[1:44:16] called Ramses
[1:44:17] Egypt's the country
[1:44:19] but they would go I wonder what people
[1:44:22] thought when they passed through Goshen
[1:44:24] especially in the in the hard times when
[1:44:27] they were under bondage
[1:44:28] when their beer were being beat
[1:44:31] and travelers coming by and they would
[1:44:34] pass through this town
[1:44:37] these people they see people that are
[1:44:39] scarred
[1:44:40] that were beaten that were weary
[1:44:43] pushed down
[1:44:46] but some reason they would they would
[1:44:47] hear him singing a song about a
[1:44:49] deliverer
[1:44:50] it seemed happy
[1:44:54] what's wrong with these people
[1:44:57] you sisters
[1:45:00] that don't cut your hair you wear you
[1:45:02] wear your long skirts you don't wear
[1:45:04] makeup and you do all this stuff and
[1:45:05] people look at you think you're under
[1:45:07] bondage
[1:45:08] they don't realize you're the happiest
[1:45:10] person on the face of the Earth
[1:45:12] you got a song in your heart
[1:45:15] you want to worship because God made you
[1:45:17] who he makes you
[1:45:19] that's what the token does
[1:45:21] the token makes you happy in the middle
[1:45:24] of a tribulation
[1:45:30] they could sing
[1:45:32] we're almost home
[1:45:34] running my last small home we're almost
[1:45:36] there they knew the liver was coming
[1:45:39] they knew he was coming
[1:45:41] and they didn't know they were going to
[1:45:43] be in the wilderness 40 years
[1:45:45] God had a purpose
[1:45:49] but Harry can we sing that I'm almost
[1:45:50] home or can you sing it
[1:45:58] let's just worship him a minute
[1:46:15] you disappointed

[1:59:46] and I was just reading just before the
[1:59:48] service where
[1:59:50] Jesus was sharing the parable about the
[1:59:52] I think it was a Pharisee in a public
[1:59:54] and and won the Pharisee had talked
[1:59:57] about how thankful he was that he didn't
[2:00:00] live like these terrible people
[2:00:02] and he was so thankful that he fasted
[2:00:04] and he did all these things and
[2:00:06] then the Publican had said I can't
[2:00:08] remember exactly how it was worded but
[2:00:10] the meaning was he couldn't even lift
[2:00:12] his head up towards heaven
[2:00:14] so ashamed of itself I said God forgive
[2:00:16] me a sinner
[2:00:18] you know that's the way we want to come
[2:00:19] to the Lord but that's no good a year
[2:00:21] down the road two years down the road
