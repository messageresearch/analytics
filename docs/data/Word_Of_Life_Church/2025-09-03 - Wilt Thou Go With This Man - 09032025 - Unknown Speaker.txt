[Music] As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night, I'm praying for assurance everything's going to be all right for I see another battle. It's out in front of me and I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat. And he said, "I walk on the water and I call the raging sea. I spelled to the wind. It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you when you call? I walk right beside you just so you would fall. And did not leave all of heaven just to die for your sins. I searched until I found you and I do it all again. Let's all stand. We'll sing the second verse. Now she's talking to her father in a house I was once a home. Said, "My bills are coming to Lord. Six days are not thy long." He hears a voice so still said, "I move like that before. I'll do this thing and I will give you so much more." And he said, "I walk on the water and I call the raging sea. I swore to the wind. Did I still I gave you peace? Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I hear you when you call? And I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of heaven just to die for your sins? I searched until I found you. and I do it all again. I like this last verse. He said, "Do you remember child where I brought you from? Just take a look behind you at how far you come." And every time you ask me, did I deliver you? Oh, why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? He said I walked on the water and I called the raging sea. I spoke to the wind. It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue? And I hear you when you call. I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of heaven just to die for your sin. I searched until I found you and I do it all again. Let's sing that last verse again. He said, "Do you remember child where I brought you from? Just take a look behind you at how far you come." And every time you ask me, then I deliver you. Oh, why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through? They said I walked on the water. I called the raging sea. I spoke to the wind. It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue? When I hear you when you call, I walk right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of heaven just to die for your sin? I searched until I found you. And I do it all again. said, "I walked on the water and I called the raging sea. I spoke to the wind." It hushed and I gave you peace. Then I run to rescue. And I hear you when you call. And I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. And didn't I leave all of heaven just to die for your sins? I searched until I found you. And I do it all again. Amen. Praise the Lord. Go ahead and give him a hand clap of praise. [Applause] Amen. You can be seated this evening. We'll read our prayer requests. Good to be in the house of the Lord on this Wednesday evening. &gt;&gt; Please remember Sister Shirley and Brother Greg Robbins in prayer.

This is from Brother Terry Stockton. I have to have another eye surgery on my left eye tomorrow at 2:45 requesting prayer that God will grant success this time. Thanks, brother Terry. This is from Sister Eva Hegy from Illinois's called with an unspoken prayer request concerning her and her family that God knows all about. Please also pray for Sister Eva that God will provide the strength, wisdom, and encouragement she needs daily. She thanks you for prayers. I think we could all say that we need strength, wisdom, and encouragement on a daily basis. And this is a reminder sign from 12:24. I think we all know who that would be. A signup sheet for all the fall festival fall festival is in the library. The list is from last year and I have left everyone's name and what they were doing on the list.

Dear Lord, what a wonderful opportunity, Father, to midweek when seems like we battle day by day by day, but this is a refuge for us, Lord. A place to come rest, a place to relieve the pressure.

The desire is in us, Father, but you'll just need to please help us, Lord. In Jesus name we ask it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Kim, if you'll come at this time, receive the tithes and offering. gonna sing an old song from the Happy Valley days that I tried to resurrect during the prayer line, but I probably should have practiced it before I tried to resurrect it. Um, hopefully everybody remembers it so I'm not the only one singing. I appreciate all the participation that I can get, especially on semi- old, semi- new songs. Let's sing this together. [Music] I may be troubled on every hand, but I'm not stressed out. perplexed about things in life, but I'm not in despair. I'm sometimes persecuted, but I'm never left alone. Cast down but not destroyed because I'm one of his own. I'm getting back up. There's a race I've got to run. I'm getting back up. There's a battle to be won. My feeble hands I'm going to raise with my mouth going to shout his praise. By the blood of Jesus Christ, I'm getting back up. With the whole armor of God, I'm able to stand. The word of God is a sword that I hold in my hand. The shield of faith in front of me. Helmet of salvation on cover up my lungs with truth in my gospel shoes I have put on. I'm getting back up.

Brother Ryan's going to sing for us, but we'll sing one more song before we turn it over to him. I'm glad that he was there all the time. No matter where I went, how wayward I went, how down in the valley I went, he was right there every time. Amen. Let's sing a song. Time after time I went searching for peace in some form.

[Music] appreciate that special tonight. Let's all just stand and we'll sing one more song before we ask brother D to come and bring the word of the Lord. That's a pretty fitting song, especially for a Wednesday night. You you go and you go and you go and you go. School word I you get get in the service and you're just thinking like a thousand miles a minute. It's like deep breath. Slow down one second. You might miss something. Amen.

[Music] My God, my king, we worship you, Lord God. We bless your name, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Let me tell you a little bit of how blessed you are today. I was sent a video today from a church in Africa. And in that church, they were saying the name of their pastor, Jehovah Savior. And then this name, this preacher, their pastor was their savior. They turned in testimonies of healings and miracles that had happened through the power of his name. a message preacher so-called. I've stood there and preached in that church. I got another video today from the same assembly and they were singing what great power that laid in the name of this pastor. So they took the song there is power in the name of Jesus. except they said the name of their pastor. And here we are tonight knowing that that is lies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's only one name that's worthy of praise. &gt;&gt; You ought to be so grateful &gt;&gt; that you're praising Jesus &gt;&gt; and not some idolatry &gt;&gt; and blasphemy. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's exactly what it is. You say around the message. Yeah. You say, "Well, my goodness, brother Donnie, why in the world would that be?" Cuz Satan wants to tarnish it. That's why. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you know the truth? &gt;&gt; And the truth has made us free &gt;&gt; from such stuff as that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Well, how are you tonight? Good. &gt;&gt; How many's fighting the devil? &gt;&gt; We're good. Praise God. If none of you had raised your hands, I was going to quit. &gt;&gt; Well, how many of you winning? &gt;&gt; Some of you still working on it. That's all right. Praise the Lord. You're going to do it by the grace of God. Let's turn tonight to Genesis chap 24 if you would. Verse 54. Again, our setting from the great passage that has been written so many thousands of years ago, laid there in the word, of course, thought probably by many just to be another speck of history and the life of the patriarch Abraham, but it was much much more than that. Genesis 24:54. And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and terried all night. And they rose up in the morning. And he said, "Send me away unto my master." Now, his message thus far has been about blessings and been about wealth and uh potentate, a man of great position and all of that. But now his message comes to this phase. Separating time. Separating time. Now watch what he's going to say. Send me away unto my master. And her brother and her mother said, "Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least 10, and after that she shall go." And he said unto them, "Hinder me not, seeing that the Lord has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master." And they said, "We will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth." And they called Rebecca and said unto her, and this is my thought for tonight, wilt thou go with this man? And word of life said, &gt;&gt; I will go. &gt;&gt; I will go. Now, believe it or not, God's prophet said, "God wants to hear you say that." God wants to hear you say that. Maybe it was something similar to that in the year 1904 when the Welsh revival broke out and some missionaries from the Baptist missionary service in here in America went to India and they began to spread the gospel what they knew of it. There was a man, his wife and two sons in a certain village village in India that received the gospel. They begin to testify to others and the king of that village had a problem because he was he was really tearing that place up. So he called him, his wife and his children and demanded that they renounce their faith in Jesus Christ. And the man said he would not do it. These are his words. I have decided to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; So the king commanded his men with their bows and arrows to kill his two sons before his eyes. So he said, "I give you a chance to recant." He refused. shot his wife. She fell on top of her boys as they were laying there twitching and jerking. So he said, "What do you say about it now?" He said, "Though none go with me, I will follow." So now he says, "All right, we're going to take your life." So what will you say now? No turning back. No turning back. That song that you all know that's been a hymn for many, many years. That was the birth of that song. So the man lays there dead, his wife dead, and his two sons dead. It tore that king all to pieces. He said, "How could anybody be willing to do such?" He fell under conviction, gave his heart to the Lord Jesus right there. &gt;&gt; The rest of the whole tribe got under conviction and every one of them got saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Now I ask you, was it worth four people giving their lives to save all the rest of them? Isn't it amazing? It was not their life being lived that impacted the salvation of others, but them actually giving their life. That song was sung in India. an American artist here in America in 1959 took it put put the orchestration to the music and all that. It has been of course recognized as one of the great famous hymns of the church and birthed out of such pain and death. So I ask you again, will you go? &gt;&gt; If your mama goes, you will. If your daddy goes, you well, if if your friends go, no turning back. &gt;&gt; Though none go whispering, I will follow. Let's pray together, shall we? Lord Jesus, we're so thankful, Father, that you can move on human beings hearts in such a way that makes them so odd and peculiar to the world, but yet the love that they experience is so phenomenal that it can change other people's lives. Father, that's what we want out of our own lives. Not just the way we dress and not just certain things that we do and don't do and places we can go and don't go and all of that, but may it be our love, truly our love that we have for you and not only for you, but for each other. But when you were here, you said, "By this shall all men know that you are my disciples because you have love one for the other." I can't wait to meet that man that day. I think myself, had that been me, instead of two boys, it been my two girls. while they laid their jerking and quivering and life going out of their bodies. I believe I'd had enough courage. And then if it was asked about Carol, I believe I'd still had enough courage to say, "Though none go with me, still I will follow." I pray, Father, you'd help each one of us here tonight to feel that way. Bless our gathering tonight, Lord Jesus. We ask in your precious name. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. That's one thing I really love about the Lord. He messes up your plans. I was going to tell you that story at the end, but somehow another, he wanted it told at the beginning. Let me read this to you from possessing the enemy's gates in 1959. And the prophet said, "Rebecca, which was to be the mother of this noted, promised, waited son, when she was called, she had never seen before." Notice now called to the final test of a strange man she had never seen before. Only she seen the working of the Holy Spirit. Now remember, she never actually saw any vindication from God that Eleazar was telling the truth. There was no signs, no wonders, no miracles, no healings, no lame legs, no blinded eyes, none of that. None of that happened whatsoever. What did she have? She had his word, but she also had a personal experience that the angel of God had given to her. Now, notice how the prophet says this. She had never seen before, only she had seen the working of the Holy Spirit. And when her parents could not fully decide whether she should go with this stranger or not to be the wife of a man that she had never seen, she was brought to the final test. And we'll get the damsel and let her speak. We'll hear from her mouth whether she will go yes or no. That's the way it's brought to all of the seed of God. It's got to be your mouth. &gt;&gt; God wants to hear from you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that awesome? It's got to be from your mouth. Now, you may wonder sometimes why whenever I'm preaching things or other ministers will do the same thing, I must say, what do you all think about it? You all understand this? You agree with that? Why am I doing that? because God wants to hear it from your mouth. And I figure one of the ways that he can do it is for me to put it to you in the form of a question. So I ask you the question and then God is waiting to hear your answer. Now notice it's got to be your mouth. God wants to hear from you. So when she was put to the test, she never hesitated a minute. She said, "I will go." I like that. Not, "Let me make up my mind. Let me study it over." She was fully persuaded. That's the people that God can use. Praise the Lord. When you're fully persuaded that God will keep his promise, she said, "I will go." Now remember, Rebecca was a type of the bride. So if she was then she in her journey and in her decision time and in the faith part of her journey she had to experience similar things to what you and I would be or she could not be the bride type. Now, if everything went easy for her and she never had to have a testing of her faith and maybe even a wondering on the journey after the great pulsation of faith had anointed her to speak this, it might have been so reverberating out of her soul and so powerful that it took her by surprise. We know it's done us that way at times. But we also know that God will allow us to be tested then of what our confession has been made out of our own mouths. Now, if Rebecca was a bride type, then I I I believe from looking at that that Rebecca must have had some disencouraging times going back on this 450 mile journey on the back of a camel. She is the type of the bride. So if she was, she must have had some wonderings and maybe some bewilderment and maybe even some questions after that she'd committed to following this man that she'd never seen before until yesterday. And he comes with this strange message of a king or not a king but of a great man by the name of Abraham that was a wealthy man and he supposedly had a son. She had no way to Google him. She had no way to be able to chat GPT and check him out, check his credentials. She had absolutely no way whatsoever. But yet, there was something about what the man had to say, the man's message. Now, if you haven't been listening to Time of Decision, uh the one in Chicago and also the one in Los Angeles, it do you good to listen to it cuz a prophet really goes into this and reiterates this and I I love it. But I went back through it again today and I heard him as he come to the end of the preaching part there and he said now those of you that are here and you got needs in your body. He said do you believe my message? Do you have you heard my message that I brought to you from God? I thought Lord have mercy. So here is the very answering to the type of Eleazar in the Old Testament an offering to the people in that day. Now remember 1959 so the seals are not open yet the revealing of the manifestation of the son of man has not even come into full view. It was already been foreshadowed. Great things were happening. But the word of God had already began to call and God was calling out. Now watch. He says what happens here. Now he said, "Let me make up my mind. Let me study over it." She was fully persuaded. That's the people that God can use. And no doubt her parents and her brother, which was the spokesman, could have said, "Come next to yourself, Rebecca. Don't you think that we might need to send a camel train back or to try to find out if this man is even to tell them the truth? We don't even know. They didn't have phones. They didn't have no no way at all to be able to check the story. Rebecca, think what you are. And remember, she was only 16 years old. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And going to marry a man that was actually 40. a man that was still mourning at the deaths of his mother. Now think, in one sense of the word, it would look like a man that in one way was kind of a mama's boy, 40 years old and still living in his mother's tent. Watch what your Bible says. Whenever Rebecca went back, he took her into his mother's tent. And from looking they'd say, "Oh my goodness, what kind of man is this anyway? And how do I know this man here is even telling me the truth?" So they could have said easily, "Rebecca, you may never see your family again." And I've told you before, she didn't. There's no record that she ever went back and saw her mother again or saw any of her family. Oh my. They could have said, "Oh, this is a very difficult journey and look, you're totally outnumbered. You're going and your and your maid Deborah, she's going with you, your nurse. And then there's a few foolish virgins." &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; That's going along with you. &gt;&gt; Maids. &gt;&gt; They were following the message, but they never got to marry Isaac. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they was going along in the camel train, but they wasn't on the camel the power that she was riding. Now, Rebecca, you're outnumbered. This doesn't even make sense. You've been a sensible girl. And then we come to the famous word that we looked at a couple of weeks ago. Rebecca, this could be a cult. &gt;&gt; Let me read to you the meaning of cult. You can read it with me. Cults are social groups which have unusual and often extreme religious, spiritual or philosophical beliefs and rituals. But you know what I find amazing about it is that there are cults that follow certain musicians and cults that follow certain singers. And I'm sure probably a lot of you all have heard of the famous singer in this day and age that we live in. Her name is Taylor Swift. Anybody heard of her name before? I'm sure you've heard her name. Well, she has a cult following. Now, do you know what those people call themselves who are a part of that following? &gt;&gt; Swifties. Yes. &gt;&gt; So they take her name upon themselves and they are not ashamed and you know they dress like her and they pay all kinds of money to go hear her sing and uh they do all that sort of thing and they are proud. They are so tickled to death that they are part of the Swifty cult. &gt;&gt; Come on. Well, I'm very happy myself that I'm part of the eagle one. &gt;&gt; And we also are very swift. As a matter of fact, we're fixing to be so swift, we're going to move from this dimension to the next one and faster than you can bat your eye. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Now, isn't it amazing now that people will not get up in churches and all that? Why? Because there's pastors that are part of the Swifty cult. There are Baptist people, church of God people. I do hope with all of my heart there ain't nobody here that belongs to the Swifty cult. I'm disappointed in you if you are. But yet there was people that belong to the cult of Elvis and the cult of ACC and the cult of this and that and the other. I don't know the modern ones, you know, just ones that I've heard as as a kid growing up and all that. And yet they are not ashamed. They're not backwards of it. And and people don't think it's a terrible thing that they collect every album. You know, there was a cult that followed the group Kiss. Many of you have seen that one. They look like absolute demons right out of the pits of hell. Why? Cuz that's where their influence come from. But yet, why is it that people want to identify a group that just believes something different than what they do or things that they really don't understand or that they've heard from gossip and yet they want to treat you like you've got the plague. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Now, I I took some of these things and identified them from the professionals who study cults. But there was one more little aspect that I wanted to touch on for just a little bit and it was this one. According to the Cult Education Institute, wow, what a name. Cult Education Institute, CI. There are specific warning signs to look out for when considering whether a group might be a cult. Cults are characterized, now listen carefully, by absolute authoritarianism without accountability. Now, let's just take now some of the teaching of what our prophet taught us and see if his teachings line up with this. Now, if they do, then I think we as a church should look at ourselves very carefully and say, "Are we a cult that's off the word?" &gt;&gt; Fair enough. &gt;&gt; Boy, some of y'all's tore up, ain't you? Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Now remember complete authoritarianism. So the leader of the cult would be the one in charge. Then the people won't have any say. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They won't control. They won't do anything. They will just do what they are told. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't scared to look, are you? &gt;&gt; Well, I ain't because I know what the answer is. Now watch this and you can read it with me. There is no one above the elder. I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, this is supposed to be the cult leader. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's saying to the church that he started, but brother Neville is now pastoring. And the supposed cult leader is saying that he don't have any control. &gt;&gt; Now listen, it goes on. That's up to you and brother Neville. If brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah witness doctrine, &gt;&gt; that's up to him and you. Oh no. It's a bad sign. It's a bad sign that brother Brandon wasn't the cult leader. &gt;&gt; Cuz these people are spending the years of their life now and then they'll fry in hell like a pancake after a while on lies. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. &gt;&gt; Now notice if he wanted to preach anything he wanted to. That's between you and him. Now wait a minute. This is one of the first principles of a call that absolutism that the leader will have and is not to be questioned. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some of you guys that stream our services, especially on Wednesday night, you like like to pick what I say. Here's another one. Now, either you line it up or these things will condemn you at the day of judgment, &gt;&gt; and I'll stand against you and watch the angels of God commit you into the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so if you got truth, prove it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And Word of Life said, &gt;&gt; if the congregation votes for him in there to preach that, &gt;&gt; that's all right. That's up to him. &gt;&gt; That's up to him. No, it absolute authoritarianism that the cult leader so-called was the one that had the final say of everything. The only thing I do is just owning the property. If something another comes by, like moving the pastor and they want to take a vote on it, you couldn't ask a deacon to do that. You come and ask me. And I'd come down and say, "Well, if you want to move the pastor, tell me why. Has he done anything? Yes, we caught him drunk or we caught him doing this or doing something wasn't right. Have you got three witnesses of it?" Now notice here is the supposed leader. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; But instead of him saying, "Oh, I'll tell you one thing. I'll be in charge. I'll whoop him. I'll do this, that, and other. I'll do No, he's putting it right back on the people that are making the accusation. Have you got three witnesses of it?" Yes, we have. Then witnesses must first be tried. An elder. Notice you don't receive an accusation against an elder less it's by two or three witnesses. Let them first be proved against an elder. Then you have to swear. This would eliminate a lot of gossip that people accept on preachers if some of you lay people would make them comply to this. You're going to receive an accusation against a minister. &gt;&gt; If you don't go by this way right here, you're just as wrong as the person packing and spreading the lie. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now, notice they have to swear to it that you saw it and prove it. Well, sister so and so told me that they said that they said that they saw it on Facebook. Well, my goodness, that's even more absolute than the Bible, ain't it? That's the way some people look at it. Facebook, Instagram replaces Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. &gt;&gt; Not to a believer, they don't. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And then if you did, then that sin is rebuked openly that it's wrong. Then say, congregation, what you mean? The pastor does something wrong and then they would call the prophet down and he was all right. You got to go up this way. You got witnesses. Y'all, all right, you three brothers stand. All right, now y'all stand. What did you see? I saw brother Donnie. He was out there. Lord have mercy. Amber beer running out of his mouth. And whenever he saw me, he swallowed that could of tobaca. He got choked and he spit it out on the bank. Brother, are you willing to swear to that? Raise your right hand. I swear before Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Boy, y'all getting tired on a tick tonight on me, ain't you? &gt;&gt; Now, come on, friends. Either we believe this or we don't. Do we believe it? &gt;&gt; God has given us the way. &gt;&gt; And notice where it's put back on you people. &gt;&gt; My my Then they say, "Congregation, do you want to change your pastor? If you mean the absolute authoritarianism of this so-called cult leader is not going to do it. &gt;&gt; No. You know why? He did not have the authority from God to do so. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because the sovereignty lays in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not even in the prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, come on somebody. &gt;&gt; Not even in the pastor. &gt;&gt; So now I've been with you all what is it now, Carol? Going on 38 years maybe. This is the 38th year. So, how many of you would want to go to work for a company? You would give 38 years of your life, your brothers that are businessmen. So, you'd start a business and you'd work and labor and sweat to build that business. And then in 38 years, the employees decide to get rid of you. &gt;&gt; Would any of y'all want that kind of business? How many of you would want to give 25 or 30 years to some corporation and then some of your fellow employees desire to to get rid of you so they just vote you out. Now think about what a position that I hold and other pastors around the message. I give 38 years of my life &gt;&gt; to being your pastor. And those that we buried and those that have went on to the Lord and all that so that I could lose my position in this church, all the labor, all the preaching, all the physical work that I've done, everything else right along with it simply by majority vote and I'm gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, how many of you would commit your life for 38 years? Anybody want to raise your hand? Well, at least you ain't liars. &gt;&gt; Now, think. So, you mean, Brother Donnie, you could you could actually be voted out tonight? &gt;&gt; I could be got rid of tonight. Praise the Lord. Ain't this good? &gt;&gt; I love getting that devil in a spot and just pushing him, slamming him right up against that piano, taking his big old head and sliding it right underneath there until his ghoul hangs out his tongue. &gt;&gt; That's what the word does to his eye. Oh my. If the congregation votes forgive him, let him go on. That's the way it has to stand. So, somebody refresh my memory. So, this is the way it worked with David Koresh, right? &gt;&gt; This is the way that it's worked with Charles Manson. This is the way that it's worked with all the famous cult leaders and groups that that the people themselves voted the leader out, right? Oh my, that isn't that fair enough way to run a church. That's what the Bible said. We have no bishops and overseers and boards and so forth. Moves this one and got a lot of authority. There's nobody got authority here but the Holy Ghost. He does the moving. Now listen to this. And we take him as the majority of the people the way the people go. I guarantee you there's some people around this message that don't do it this way. But we ain't them people. And there's people around the world that do it this way. Why? Cuz that lines up with the scripture. &gt;&gt; And somebody said, &gt;&gt; "All right, then where is the authoritarianism that a cult leader supposed to have?" &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now notice this how this works even in the majority. Then if one side wants to do this and the other side wants to do that and the side wins, the losing side, what do they do about it? I can tell you what most of them do about it. They're going to cause a split in the church. &gt;&gt; Did you ever wonder why we don't have any scriptures on how to split a church? &gt;&gt; Do you ever wonder why there ain't no quotes in the message that tells us how to split a church and set up another church? You ever wonder why there's no scripture and no quotes for it? Huh? So, what do they have then when they do that? And what are they building their church upon? &gt;&gt; Not the word of God. &gt;&gt; Well, glory. &gt;&gt; My my. Now, watch how this one side and other side thing works. And the other side wants to do that and this side wins. The losing side, what do they do about it? They join right in with the rest of them and say we were wrong. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, boy, that right there threw out some of you. Plum out the door, did it? For some of you to admit that you voted the wrong way or some turpentine on your Kool-Aid. My my goodness, I can't admit it. I will not do it. Hallelujah. Suit yourself. You're not following the teaching of this message. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Now, notice what he tells them to do. Join right in with the rest of them and say, "We were wrong. then we will go right on cuz the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; has made that choice. &gt;&gt; So, can we vote wrong? &gt;&gt; I can. &gt;&gt; But can after I've voted wrong, can I go with it? Well, let me share something with you that a lot of the message people can't do. Now, watch. The prophet goes on to say like Democrats and Republicans, as long as we stand as a democracy, as Americans, if the Democrats is in, the Republicans should push right on with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to send this to Trump tomorrow and then Chuck Schumer and all the rest of them on the other side. Been nice knowing you all cuz they'll hang me. If the Democrats is in, the Republicans should push right on with them. Republicans in, the Democrat push on. That's just exactly what makes us a nation. Can't you see why we're in such a mess? &gt;&gt; Whenever we break that, we break our democracy. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Boy, ain't that quote fitting for the day we're living in? That's right. Democrats say I ain't going to do nothing Republicans is in. Then we'll fall. &gt;&gt; I'm a Kuckian. Together we stand and divided we fall. So what does this do? This cultism of this aspect. It hinges on, listen to this church, the encouraging of maximum dependency upon the leader. Then they don't know what to do. They can't make those decisions on their own. They've got to have conser. And the leader wants it that way. He does not want them growing up. Listen to me. God wants you as your pastor. I want you to grow up. &gt;&gt; There will be questions that you'll have in your life that you'll have to come to me or other ministers. But I don't want you relying on me to be your yes and no and yes and no and yes and no about every decision of your life. God wants every one of you to be so full of the Holy Ghost that you can go to him in prayer and say, "Father, should I do that or should I do that?" And you have that walk with God. Amen. Don't let somebody else replace that for God. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. The socalled cult leader, Total Deliverance, 1954. They was talking about building a new tabernacle. Frankly, myself, when they spoke of a new tabernacle to me, I was against the thought. That's right. I said, "We don't need exactly a new tabernacle. I'll probably be leaving here pretty soon as the Lord showed me what what comes to pass. And what do we need a new tabernacle for?" And we haven't got the money. Then I come down there and I drug out the red Kool-Aid. And I said, "Everybody that voted against me is a prophet of God. Get in this line and drink this Kool-Aid. &gt;&gt; You lying hypocrites." &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about you. Put God's prophet &gt;&gt; in such a status. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now notice I come down and felt the feeling of the church that the church in the majority seemed to want it. Then what did I do? I sacrificed my own thoughts and throwed in with the church. A cult leader, a cult leader sacrificed his own thoughts which would have brought his own leadership into question. So you mean, brother Benam, you're secondguessing what you thought. Why did he do that? Because he recognized the body of God, God wanted to speak through his congregation. And unless God showed him a vision or a dream or gave him a direct word from the Lord, this is the way he chose to let the church run. This is the way it ought to be run this very day. &gt;&gt; Now then, what did I do? I sacrificed my own thoughts and throwed right in with the church. Sure, let's do it. Wow. &gt;&gt; So, instead of standing at the door, don't do it, Rob. Don't do it, Peter. Don't do it, Lance. Don't do it. Here, tell pass it around. Pass it around. Tell everybody I said no to tell them not do it. Instead, brother Brown said, let's do it. Let's rally. The majority of this church wants to praise God. Let's do it. &gt;&gt; That's a real Christian with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Thank you, Lord Jesus. That's the way it was in the Bible time, the way the church voted, the sovereignty, the groups of the people, they came together in unity, their strength. So therefore, I said certainly if that's the way the church wants, if that's what God is wanting, he's got more of authority to vote amongst a whole group of people than he has to me. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. My &gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you something, Rebecca. Can you follow a man like this? &gt;&gt; I can. &gt;&gt; I can't follow some of these dictators in the message. No. Any preacher that stand up in the pull pit and let people worship him. I ain't got the time of day for that bunch myself. I could not follow a man like that to the dollar store and back. Ain't no way I'd be scared death something happen to me on my way out. I don't want nothing to do with such a thing. I cannot follow a man that will not admit his humanity and admit his mistakes. Every one of us, every great preacher that's ever been has had his faults and his failures and his mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as a matter of fact, the people of God admire you more when they can see you admit them and make it right before God. And the people, they'll have more confidence in you than they did before. Everybody will unless they're making an idol out of you. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this now. It's what God is wanting. He's got more of authority to vote amongst the people or the whole group of people than he has to me because I have no vision. No vision to say that it shouldn't be. Praise God. So, we throw in with the church and move with the church and I'm behind it to do all that I can to help out the church. That should be the motive of every Christian and every person in the church is to unify ourselves and stick together. Whatever the church votes for, that's what we should stand for. Then say for instance, they want to change something in the church. Well, then the trustees want to, somebody else want to, the deacon, they want to change something, come before the church. And if our idea seems a bit a little different, listen now, than the church does, let's sacrifice. Let's sacrifice that idea. Now, why was he telling the people that? Cuz that's what he did. &gt;&gt; That's what he did. He sacrificed his idea. It's not a word from the Lord. It was not a vision, but it was his idea. He didn't want to do it. Oh my. Because that's the only way we can stand united. And if this church will go on the way you're going right now and be united together, listen to this, children. It's unlimited what he'll do. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; If we'll stick together. Is it any wonder then Satan wants to divide us? He wants to divide us as a family, a marriage, home, our church. He wants to divide us as a message movement. The message community is so split and divided. That's why Satan does it is to keep the supernatural power of God. Oh, we've seen God do great things to me. Oh, it's a miniature thing. What it could be if we could be united together. Oh my. How many want it with all your heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost? I ain't talking about making a great big denomination. I'm talking about unifying on the principles that God has given us in this last day. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us Jesus. My notice, that's how we want to be so complete with one another. Again, the Hebrew says, "By the way, while I'm speaking, somebody around this country somewhere is guilty of riding some cards to move Brother Neville out of this pull pit. You're going to have to settle that with me." Uhhuh. He says, "That's right." Yes, indeed. Said something about the deacon. The deacon board has not one thing to do with that, pastor. No, sir. The congregation in full has the authority. A deacon board is just a policeman here in this church to keep order and so forth. But when it comes to the rules, the whole church has to say so. This church is built upon the sovereignty of the local church. &gt;&gt; Now, of course, if you don't believe in going to church, I don't guess you have no sovereignty or authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; Therefore, I have nothing to say in moving this pastor. What? William Brandom, &gt;&gt; the founder supposedly of this cult had no authority. I pray God strikes some of you people that streams out here and conviction will hit your heart while you're right there in front of your computer. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord God, if there's one that's redeemable, Father, &gt;&gt; look at what you're saying versus the very facts of what this man taught. &gt;&gt; And the preachers in the message that don't do this, don't believe what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. My I have nothing to do in moving this pastor or putting one in. I own the property. It's given to the church. You all are the church. You are the people, the one who control. You're the church yourself. And the church, the holy church of God is the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit in that church. And the only thing I do is own the property. Give it over to this church. Give it over for a church. And it's taxfree. And the church elects their own pastors. I have nothing to do with it. And the only way this pastor could ever leave would be the pastor decide himself to go or the majority of the votes of the church would have the say change the pastor. That's the only way. And word of life said, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; The trustees have nothing to do with it. only repair the church. Oh my, they can't do it. The whole trustee board must meet and says we build this and we do that. Then they have to ask the treasur. They've got the money to do it. Therefore, no one person has nothing to do in this. It's the majority of the people. Yes, sir. If 20 votes for him and 21 votes against him, he goes or vice versa. That is the sovereignty of the local church. So I can see her by now they're half a day out and Eleazar just got there explaining to her why he was not a cult leader and she could say that's a relief. But can you imagine that little girl as she now transitions out from under the headship that she's known all of her life. And verse 58 says, "They called Rebecca and said unto her, thou goest with this man, and she said, I will go." This one simple act of faith changed her life. &gt;&gt; She was changed from being a servant to being a bride. &gt;&gt; She was changed to being a little girl that was unknown out in the backside of a wilderness somewhere. Oh, hallelujah. To being one of the great matriarchs of the faith of the tribes of Israel. changed from a position of loneliness, hallelujah, in the world and no doubt being a type of the bride. She always was a misfit just like most of us in this place tonight. Even when you were a little child, you was a misfit. Why? That seed of God down inside of you was crying to be born. It was crying for manifestation. And no doubt when she began to hear this Harry, it was something that rung down in her soul truer than anything she had ever heard in her entire life. &gt;&gt; She is now changing from poverty, from her poverty to Isaac's wealth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Now remember when she accepted the rings, when she accepted the tab, when she accepted that she had become officially engaged as we called it or betrothed is the Old Testament word for her for for this servant man to even be allowed to touch her hand, not like today like they do, but for him to be allowed, she allowed him to touch her hand to put the bracelets on. Amen. And the prophet says the earrings as faith cometh by hearing and by putting the bracelets on was the working of her hands. And for her to allow him to do that. She did not have to say I accept your master as my husband. It was the reaction of her hand. Can't you understand why God wants you to clap yours? Can't you understand why God wants you to raise yours in praise? There's something about the hands. Amen. There's something about the hands. We ought to use ours for the glory of God. We ought to use ours to be able to praise and bless and magnify the name of the Lord. Oh my what what motivated her? Well, this messenger even though maybe she didn't have any credentials but she saw proof. She saw proof of the wealth of the man he was talking about cuz she could tell by looking at that man that he himself, you know, he he certainly was no rich man himself. This decision she made would change her for the rest of her life. Not only her. How many people down through the ages for thousands of years have been blessed by hearing this sermon about Rebecca preached? It's affected me. Hasn't it affected you? This one decision. Think of it, friend. She's not a preacher. She's not a prophet. But this decision of faith has affected people since the very day that woman made her decision. And some of you think, "I could never do nothing for God." When you make your decision to serve him, and you're going to press beyond all your faults and your failure. You never know who's watching you. You never know who's looking at you and said, "I know they're going through a hard time. And if they can do it, I can do it, too." It was her decision that they rallied around down through the ages and even Paul Meyer the writer of Hebrews put her in the great heroins of faith that Rebecca identified why the decision she made. Will you go with this man I will go? 1 Peter chapter 1:7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen. Look at the parallel between you and Rebecca. You've not seen him. You was not there at Calvary. You were not there physically at the tomb when he raised from the dead. You have not seen him. Oh my homing have not seen yet love. It's no wonder that we seem so crazy and so unusual to the world that we give everything we are. Oh that poor man and his wife and them two boys that gave their life for the cause of Christ to something that was totally invisible. But yet the visibility become manifest after a while, didn't it? when they seen a life a man that would stand there and give his life and all that he had. Praise God for the very cause of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing. How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Oh, I've not held his hands. I've not reached down and touched his precious feet, but I believe anyhow. I'm waiting for the day. I'm waiting for the day when I'll be able to do that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But what did he say? Oh my. Whom they have not seen you love. And whom though now you see him not. Repeats it again yet believe and you sit around with a mlly grubs all sad and low down and you don't even clap your hands. You ain't got a smile on your face in 6 months and you're just poor little old me. Poor little old me. Wowy wy woo. That ain't what Peter said. But he said you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. [Applause] Oh my praise be to God. Oh, thank you Lord Jesus. How in the world I I whenever I I was studying on this, I found where one of the Bible commentators had made this statement about her. She was thought of before she knew it and was chosen when she did not know of the existence of her bridegroom. &gt;&gt; She was thought of before she knew it. And she, oh glory, she was thought of before she knew it and was chosen when she did not even know of the existence of her bridegroom. And I ask you tonight, Rebecca, when were you chosen? The night you come to the altar, the night your daddy talked to you about the Lord before the foundation of the world. And there ain't enough devils in hell to break that everlasting covenant with a bride. &gt;&gt; Rebecca was betrolled and accompanied the servant to the land &gt;&gt; of Canaan. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight with all your heart? Notice this. The prophet said, "Then there was another great decision that had to be made after she was given." And the parents said, "Well, just let her stay around about 10 days and let her hang around the revival to really feel whether she has decided to do it or not. I haven't got much confidence in a person to make a decision to wait even until tomorrow." Why the devil talk you out of it? But the message, the message &gt;&gt; had stirred Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Friends, don't you understand? This is why people can walk away from this great message. It never stirred them. It never stirred them like the angel. Oh, glory. Did Rebecca that day? Why? You've had your hard times. You've had your difficulties. You've had this that and the other. And because people cannot answer a few things about the message and about this story and that story. I told Carol the other day, I said, "I probably got more of them human elements than any of these defectors. I've had a file for years and years and years." And she said, "Yeah, and it ain't turns you away." And I said, "No, it won't because I'm not looking at that. I'm not looking. I I realize that we have been called by almighty God, not by a Kuckian." [Music] Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; She was satisfied. &gt;&gt; The message. &gt;&gt; Was from God. &gt;&gt; So let the parents said, "Oh, let her stick around a while. She'll get over it." &gt;&gt; We still ain't got over it, have we? It's just a little excitement. She was over to that revival, you know. But oh, the true servant said, "Don't worry us. Don't hinder me." A lot of the servants of God has been hindered by put off decisions. Don't hinder me saying that the Lord has sent me, seeing that he's been good to me. Don't hinder me. Then they said, "Let her make her own decision." That's where you stand tonight. Make your own decision. Then they called Rebecca and said, "Will you go with this man or do you want to stay around a little while to see if you really want to do it?" She said, "I will go." She was ready. Her decision was quickly made. Amen. Something had been leading her. &gt;&gt; Notice he didn't say someone. &gt;&gt; It was not the man, Elizer. It was not her mama. It was not her brother. It was the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice, she commits herself. She commits herself. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; By accepting this message, this message &gt;&gt; of this unusual person. and she will live the rest of her life in a different sphere because of the message she heard and received. &gt;&gt; Now this characterized by the way she done this characterized the faith of Abraham and she didn't even know him. So, she's believing in the same way her future father-in-law believed &gt;&gt; cuz he claimed those things which were not as though they were. &gt;&gt; And he didn't consider his own body now dead, neither deadness of Sarah's womb, but he looked at the promise of God. And this is what Eleazar is looking for in a bride to marry Isaac. A woman that will be compatible with the revelation of the message that the whole family was now needed to be have. Now it said we absolutely know that Esau didn't have it. Others down through the same lineage did not have it. But this is what he's looking for. Those who can receive the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you Lord. So when Abraham notice was instructed to circumcise the males of his household, he didn't wait 3 days and let me pray about it. Let me go on a fast now for about 7 days or 10 days. But the Bible says early the next morning again after Abraham was instructed to offer his son as a burnt offering early the next morning. Don't you see why Satan wants you to put off decisions? And the spirit of God will speak to you and deal with you. Quit this. Don't get around that person. Stay away from them. Leave them alone. Don't do this. Don't do that. And you keep hanging on and hanging on and hanging on and putting off a decision. Oh, hear me tonight, church. &gt;&gt; But you see, Abraham did not wait. Why? He knew his humanity. It would try to talk him out of Brother Nathan. Why? There's no way this can be sensible that God would want me to act like a heathen. The heathen Canaanites offer their children as a burnt offering. God cannot surely mean that. That ain't what God meant. Maybe it was spiritual. Somehow it was spiritual. I better take another day or two and think about it. But he acted immediately. Why? He was afraid. That human element overwhelming. Come on, don't sit there and look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about. How many of us have talked oursel out of the will of God because we delayed and we waited and we delayed? &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. So you imagine this is Rebecca's disposition toward the message. Delayed disobedience only weakens faith. So you keep putting it off. Well, I'm going to pray about it and I'm going to I'm going to do like Gideon. I'm going to put out a fleece and then I'm going to put out a pig and then I'm going to put out a cow. What are you going to do? Put out everything you got? &gt;&gt; Can you show me in the New Testament where they done that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And some of you make decisions about your life and your family based on such things. Well, in the morning, if it's still on my mind and I'm still breathing, I'll know it's from God. &gt;&gt; The devil will make sure you live at least till 10:00. &gt;&gt; He loves it when we get out of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, I've got a fleece before the Lord. I've got a fleece. The Bible does not say sons of God are led by fleeces. &gt;&gt; It says they are led by the spirit of God. Come on, somebody. Oh, somebody don't like this shirt here tonight. Who is it? I keep looking. I'll find you here in a minute. Why did God give you the Holy Ghost? Not so I'm going to put my coat out tonight. If it's dry all around it in the morning, I'll know it's the Lord. Well, the devil had a bunch of angels camping around all over it if he thought he could mess you up and 25 more people along with you. Come on, somebody. But we got the Holy Ghost. We don't need, my friends. We don't need to call this man or that man. You got a word from the Lord for me? Have you got this from it? What about a dream? What about this, that, and the other? As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; You see, when we delay our obedience, 10 days can turn into 10 weeks. &gt;&gt; 10 weeks turn into 10 months. 10 months turn into 10 years. And you've lost those 10 years of your life for what? Delayed obedience. &gt;&gt; Speak, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let me close with this here momentarily. And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. Now as she leaves, she is now the bride elect, but her actual union with Isaac will not occur for another month or so. So while she's going along on this journey, there's an invisible union that's being formed in her heart toward this man that the this servant is describing. Now, you know, he didn't take all of his time. As a matter of fact, brother Ben said whenever he got there that he didn't even have time to talk about himself. He didn't talk about his campaigns and how many people he had prayed for and how many people got healed and got that. and all the other. He said he was so busy talking about his master. Now, he knows that he has but a limited time by pulling this girl out of this scenario that she's in. 16 years old, still moldable, still changeable, and he's got a limited time. I don't imagine he waited till they got about 383 miles down the road. And then he said, "You know what? If only got a little bit further, I better go and tell her about the bridegroom." Imagine when he got out, she started getting calmed and relaxed and either she started out a question and answer session or he started just go ahead and preaching on God and simplicity of the breach God and simplicity breaking open the seals and helping Rebecca to see who this man was because he's got a journey not only to pick the right one and a great obligation to pick the right one but to help her fall in love with this bridegroom. Cuz remember, just heard the prophet say today, whenever he saw her and she saw him, it was love at first sight. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. It was love at first sight. So, it didn't have to iron them down. Okay. What size is your feet? Let me see. How long is your hair, your eyes? What color is your eyes? I don't like hazel eyes. No, no, no. You're I don't like hazel eyes. She didn't have to weigh him on a set of scales. How much do you weigh now? Let me see your father because you will become what your father is. So, I don't know. Has he got hair? Is he not got hair? You know, how big is he? How big around is he? Well, praise the Lord. But what I what this servant had done had brought such drama and such dramatics of reality to her every day. Imagine she'd lay down at night. Oh, I feel like I already know him. Wow. I'm going to marry a man I've never seen before. But somehow it's like &gt;&gt; we've always been together. Like &gt;&gt; it's almost like it's almost like I mean like you know like that we we stepped out of eternity together. &gt;&gt; I mean I I can't explain really what what's going on here within me. I know it's me. I'm changing somehow. And the words that he keeps saying, it's like an open book that just But the book is a person. The book is a person. And every page that he turns of this person's life, I'm falling more in love not with the messenger, &gt;&gt; but with his message of introduction to Isaac. The problem is friends, a lot of the message folks, they fell in love with brother Brandham more than they do the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; They want to talk about brother Brandham more than they do the Lord Jesus. Brother Brandham, this brother Brandham, Brother Brandon, Brother Brandham. I think we ought to give credit to the servant of God what he deserves. But he did not die for us. He did not raise from the dead for us. He's not coming back from for us. He was a sinner saved by the grace of God. He is our brother. &gt;&gt; Say it again. He is our brother. We're not here to worship William, Mary, and Brandham. As a matter of fact, he taught us against such heretic things in the first place. We are here to worship our Lord Jesus. But we do believe our Lord Jesus has sent us an Eleaser. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Now watch as she's fixing to leave in verse 60. And they blessed Rebecca. and said unto her, "Thou art our sister. Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate him." Now, I marvel at this because it wasn't over there in that land that the Lord God gave this message of his seed possessing the gate to Abraham, but it's when he come out. I marvel that they knew about it. Where did they hear this at? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, they are saying something upon her. their blessing upon her. It's not even for them. But God used them to pronounce this on Rebecca. sort of reminds me, Carol, dear, of that Sunday morning that you and I got married, but we believed in going to church. So, we got married Sunday morning. We went to church on Sunday night. My uncle, I never heard him preach on predestination or election or fornowledge, but at the end of the service, I got up to play my guitar and sang and all that. And my uncle called Carol up, laid hands on both of us and wanted to pray for us. Start speaking in tongues, prophesying. Yeah. The Lord God say, "I called you before the foundation of the world. I ordained you and predestinated you." I mean, I'd heard of them words in the Bible, but I didn't even know what them meant. I was so ignorant of the Bible. I'm not sure my uncle did. I don't remember hearing preach. Did you? But you know what they was doing? God was using him. He was a good man. We'll see him one of these days, Harry. Good man that loved God. Hallelujah. I called you before the foundation of the world. I predestinated you to be together. I mean, went through all these words and we're just standing there. Oh Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. You see, that's one church service I'm glad we didn't miss. Ain't you Carol? Now, we could have went out on our honeymoon. I don't think we could have had any better honeymoon than what we had right there. That night we heard from eternity. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Notice be thou the mother of thousands of millions. And she was the and the Israelites both sprang from her. Let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them. Exercise dominion and authority over their enemies. I do wish Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria, Iran, all the rest of them that hate Israel. I wish they'd read this in the Bible. God has destroyed nations for that little tiny place. &gt;&gt; The land of Israel about the size of the state of New Jersey. Just recently, Syria was going to be the great mighty power that was going to do this and that and the other. Look at it today on its knees. &gt;&gt; Look at Iran. It ain't been but just a few mo months ago that our nation itself was so concerned about what Iran was going to do. And this very day, Iran is almost on its knees. Even their president saying they have no more water to drink. You can't fight a war without water now, can you? So what did God say? I'll curse them that curse you. I'll bless them that bless you. Now you see, you want to marry a woman, brothers, brother, &gt;&gt; that God can say the same thing about your wife that he says about you sisters. You want to marry a man that God can say the same thing to your husband that he can say to you. God could not have said this to a daughter of &gt;&gt; Canaan. &gt;&gt; God could not have said this prophecy to a Canaanite. &gt;&gt; Why don't y'all come over and join us? Why don't y'all Boy, y'all got some good music. Y'all got some good preachers. Sign your church in with us. We don't want to be identified with them Canaanite &gt;&gt; Woo! Lord have mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you just remember, you heard it from an idiot. Okay. Somebody that did not even graduate from high school, all of those who stand against this bride, you will be condemned. &gt;&gt; You will be judged. &gt;&gt; That's not my words. That's the words of Almighty God. All the price he's paid for his beloved. All that he's done for his beloved and for those who ridicule her life at her, make fun at her. Oh, I tell you one thing. I don't want to be one of them. Do you? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let me close. You see, a preacher's got a lot of doors open when he's preaching. So you when you say, "Brother Don, you saying you've been closing?" Well, I'm closing one door after another after another after another. I've had a lot of doors open. our text. So I'm closed. And Rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and what followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca and went his way. So what was his way? &gt;&gt; God's way. &gt;&gt; And I'm closing the last door. I hear God's prophet say something like this. And you can only serve God on earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. is God's servants that sent on earth &gt;&gt; interpret God's word &gt;&gt; to you. &gt;&gt; Wilt thou follow this man? Now remember it's twofold. It's Christ Jesus first of all and then Christ Jesus sent us a messenger. I can say yes to both. I have decided &gt;&gt; I'll follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; No turning back. &gt;&gt; No turning back. I gave him my teens, my 20s, my 30s, my 40s, my 50s. I'm in the last year of my 60s. Brother John, don't you regret going out and sewing wild oats? No, I don't regret sewing wild oats. I'm glad I sowed good ones. The only regrets I have is the mistakes I've made. I have no regrets of giving my life to Jesus. As brother Rem said, I only wish I had more than one to give him. How many feels the same way tonight? &gt;&gt; Has it been easy? No, that ain't been easy, but I wouldn't want it to be easy. I want to fall in the way of the Lord's despised few. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to sing the song that I gave you the story of. And I want you to think now, if you'd have been there in the crowd that day, would you have questioned Jesus that Jesus allowed them two innocent boys to be killed, that innocent mother to be killed, and then that innocent man, you stand there said, "How could that be the glory of God? How in the world could God ever get something out of that?" You see, that's the way it can be in our lives, too. We look and think, "I just don't understand. I don't understand it." No. and you probably never will, but I've served him long enough to know when I don't understand him, I trust him anyway, &gt;&gt; cuz he's God. And I know I ain't &gt;&gt; And you know what? I know you all ain't either. &gt;&gt; So, we might as well just accept it. He's the mighty God and we're little nothings &gt;&gt; without him. So if he wants to take this from me to make me this. If he wants to take that from me to make me this. I wonder when all them tribes people then you wonder how many of them went out and witnessed to others and they went out and witnessed to others and they went out and witnessed to others. I wonder how many will be standing there the day that day when them four people walk up there and Jesus gives them a martyr's crown and then they'll look back behind them and they'll be all them people that believed. Not because they're long dress and the long hair, but because they suffered and they died. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I can't wait to meet that family. &gt;&gt; I have decided to follow Jesus. Pick up the Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided. Aren't you glad you did it, brother Ben? So many years ago, my brother, no turning back. Thank God. No turning back. Are you sure? If none go with me, still I will fall. Oh, if none go with me, still I will follow. If none knows me, still I will follow. No turning back. What about young people? Have we decided? Can we sing it together? I have decided. I have decided to follow Jesus. Oh, I have decided I'm going to follow Jesus. I have decided. Thank you, Lord God. Thank you for helping me make that decision so many years ago. Lord, help me, Lord, that your spirit moved on me when I Lord, I didn't throw my teenage years away or my 20s or my 30s or whatever. Lord, thank you, Lord, for helping me, dear God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, maybe some here tonight they've still not made that commitment. May the spirit of God move on their hearts out here Lord that they can make a complete surrender in the presence of God. Oh hallelujah. What about it brother? If your children are taken there in India that day are you going to follow him? I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. Oh my, don't not go with me. So your wife and your two sons are laying dead in front of you and the spirit of God speak these words out of you. Don't none go with me. Still I will follow. Oh no. And now you're asked, I give you one more chance to turn your back on Jesus. Will you turn away? No turning back. No, I won't turn back. I have decided. I have decided I'm going to follow Jesus. Aren't you glad you have decided to follow Jesus? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we worship you tonight, Father. Follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. Hallelujah. Sing the camel train for us. Praise the Lord. Before Harry sings, I didn't hear all the requests that Brother Louie had had made known, but or or Justin rather, but I I know I'm I'm aware of several folks in the church that are sick and really dealing with some really difficult situations right now. And I'd like for us as believers if we could just join together before we sing this song. If you'd like to take someone by the hand or lay your hand over on the shoulder or whatever, move out if you don't feel comfortable by the person you're standing beside so we can right now as the saints of God. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. And it's not just men either that God's here. God hears the daughters. If any two on earth agree touching anything, it shall be done. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask what you will. Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he will give thee the desires of thine heart. Hitherto you've asked nothing in my name, but ask that your joys may be full. Knock and it shall be open unto you. Seek, you shall find. Let's knock together. Let's seek together. Heavenly Father, just today, Father God, we've heard of different ones in the church that are sick. Brother Keith's Lynch, at least they were able to hopefully finally diagnose, Lord, what he's going through and facing his gallbladder to be removed tomorrow, Father. And Sister Becky Lynch, Brother Melvin had text me this evening, Lord, and he had to take her father in for medical attention as well. And then, dear God, you hear this precious little this little child. Lord God, we're asking for her. Dear Jesus, you see this situation and Lord, you know the rarity of this thing that she's been diagnosed with. But Father, it does not change your power. Lord, others in the church that are sick and afflicted, some weary from fighting battles, and some, Lord, they feel like their strength is gone, and they may feel distraught and heavy tonight. But Lord God, as your children, we agree together. Father, I really wonder what our church what our church would be able to see by your great hands if we could have the unity that the prophet described to us right here tonight. If we would be able to just lay aside our differences and our petty arguments of this and that and the other and just say we're brothers. We disagree, but but we're brothers. We're sisters and we disagree, but we're sisters and we we want the same thing. I believe Lord there will be a church. There is a church already in the making, already on the earth right now. Oh hallelujah. That Satan will not be able to stop. Oh father, I pray that you would help us to be a part of that group of believers. Lord, we agree together, Father, for those that are hurting, those that are needy, those that are sick. Father, those dealing with oppression and sadness and all the things that Satan brings against your children, move for them tonight. Lord, we believe together in the name of Jesus Christ. And the saints of God said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing it for us. Let's sing it together. Oh, praise the Lord. Right before we get ready to dismiss, how many can say, "It's been good to be at the house of the Lord tonight." Amen. It was a day in early springtime by an ancient wayside well. Eler paused to rest his camel train. He had found a bride for Isaac the evening shadows fall for his weary journey had not been in vain. So he took the fair dressed in jewels rich and rare quickly to her waiting bridegroom far away. Oh where Rebecca loved her Isaac and he loved Rebecca fair. Oh it must have been a happy wedding day. Everybody now. Oh, get ready. The shadows fall. Don't you hear the alies call for there's already been a wedding. Greater joy will soon begin in the evening when the tra comes in. I want to sing it again now. Oh, get ready. Demon shadows fall. Aren't you glad you've heard it? Aren't you glad you've heard the ele? Thank God there's already been a wedding. Greater joys will soon begin in the evening when the camel train comes in. [Music] Now our blessed holy father sent a prophet from above. He came down to earth to find an elected bride. Praise God for our Isaac over yonder has prepared his tents of love and he wants his fair Rebecca by his side. Everybody now praise God. Oh get ready shadows fall. God bless you saints. I love you the Lord. already been a wedding. Greater joy will soon begin in the evening when the camel train comes in. Oh, get ready. The evening shadows fall. Don't you hear the alies call? There's already been the wedding. Greater joy will soon begin in the evening when the camel train comes. Amen. Let's just sing this little song as we go. with the only song I could really think of that fit fit that I could remember. Be no turning back. Amen. Let's just sing this as we get ready to go. Be no turning back. Will there be no turning back? Be no turning back. Be no turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus.
