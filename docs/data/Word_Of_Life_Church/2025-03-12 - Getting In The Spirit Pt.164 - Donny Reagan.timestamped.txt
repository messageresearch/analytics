[11:30] you believe that with all your heart?
[11:32] Let's stand to our feet tonight as we
[11:33] get ready to pray tonight. Let's just
[11:35] sing that course again if you will. Just

[11:46] we? Amen. Somebody say, "Praise the
[11:49] Lord." Give him one more good hand clap

[12:13] Oh, I've been
[12:16] watching and I've been
[12:20] [Music]
[12:21] waiting. Just any day
[12:26] now. His
[12:28] face I'll
[12:31] see. Amen. We love this guy right here,

[12:38] we? Let's pray. Let's pray.
[12:41] Dear Lord, thanksgiving always, always
[12:44] we are so taught to come to you with
[12:45] thanksgiving in our hearts. No matter
[12:47] what the situation may be, how serious
[12:49] it might be or how how how small it
[12:51] might be always to come before you with
[12:53] thanksgiving and our hearts prepared
[12:55] Lord for to hear your word. I thank God
[12:57] for the ministry. I thank God for the
[12:59] the stand making in the day. And I thank
[13:02] you Lord for the relationship that
[13:03] you've caused and and have us to know
[13:05] you in a clear and deeper way. I pray
[13:08] you bring more of yourself to us. I pray
[13:10] you bring more of yourself into these
[13:11] prayer requests and I thank you to
[13:12] manifest yourself where you would have
[13:15] yourself to be Lord in our lives at the
[13:17] right time and season. And I pray bring
[13:19] forth light and truth in Jesus Christ's
[13:21] name I pray. Amen.
[13:24] Thank you, brother. God bless you. Amen.
[13:26] Ushers, if you want to come at this
[13:28] time, we receive the evening offering.
[13:30] You give us unto the Lord. Once again,
[13:32] if if you're visiting with us here
[13:34] tonight, God bless you. So glad to have
[13:36] you. Let's sing a song tonight. When the
[13:38] reason that I'm standing stands in front
[13:40] of me, I want to I want to be able to
[13:43] stand there and
[13:45] receive a good report. Don't you? Amen.
[13:48] Let's sing about it if you
[13:50] will. I have stood for the
[13:54] gospel when it seemed I stood
[13:58] alone through the heartache and
[14:01] frustration. Kept my focus on the
[14:04] throne. Amen. So many times I have
[14:09] recalled the Savior's word so true.
[14:12] Thank you, Lord. If you won't be ashamed
[14:16] of me, I won't be with you. So I proudly
[14:22] stand till I see
[14:27] the face of the one who gave. Praise the
[14:31] Lord. Everything for me.
[14:35] Oh, and the reason that I'm
[14:39] standing stands in front of
[14:43] me. Every battle that we fought will
[14:47] fade from
[14:51] memory. I'll bow before his mighty
[14:54] throne glory and fall down on my knees.
[15:00] along with the reason that I
[15:04] [Applause]
[15:06] standed stands in front of
[15:14] me. The road is not
[15:17] beneath. At times I've lost my way. Oh
[15:21] yes we have. So often I've stumbled. Yes
[15:25] we have. Searching for the light again.
[15:28] Oh yes. Circumstances all around me. I
[15:33] thought I'd surely fall. Oh yes. When
[15:36] the whispering of doubt and fear told me
[15:40] you will lose it all mighty care. Oh, he

[16:10] made from
[16:13] memory. I'll bow before his mighty
[16:17] throne and fall down on my knees.
[16:22] All with a reason that I'm

[16:40] race and every child of God that will

[18:23] love of Jesus? Anybody here know about
[18:25] the love of Jesus? Singers, if you'll
[18:27] come on the platform, you're singing
[18:29] tonight. Have a couple of sisters going
[18:31] to be giving us a song if they'll come
[18:32] on to the platform. Anybody here know
[18:34] about the love of Jesus? Anybody here
[18:37] know about the power of Jesus? Anybody

[18:42] him one more good hand clap of praise

[18:59] do.
[19:00] Oh, anybody know about the love of
[19:06] Jesus? Yes, I
[19:09] do. Yes, I do.
[19:16] When I was
[19:18] searching, he sought me
[19:22] out. He gave me answers. Took away my
[19:28] doubt. Your arms. When I was
[19:32] struggling to find my way,
[19:37] I heard the sweet. Yes, we did.
[19:40] Sing to me from Yes, we did. Song of
[19:45] love and
[19:50] Oh, anybody know about the grace of
[19:54] Jesus? Jesus. Lord, I do. Yes, I do.
[20:00] Yes, I
[20:02] do.
[20:04] Anybody know about the grace of Jesus?
[20:11] Lord, I
[20:13] do. Yes, I do.
[20:19] He came and broke the chains of sin and
[20:23] death and hell. Yes, he did. Said that I
[20:27] could use his name to defend myself. His
[20:33] power is my constant source of help.
[20:41] Oh, now youbody know about the power of
[20:47] Jesus.
[20:49] Lord, we all do. Yes, I do. Yes, we do.
[20:54] Yes, I do.
[20:57] Anybody know about the power of Jesus?
[21:03] Lord, I
[21:05] do. Yes, I do.
[21:11] Thank you, Lord, that we do. Amen. God
[21:14] bless you. Give him a good hand clap
[21:16] tonight if you love him with all your
[21:18] heart. Praise the Lord. Give our singers
[21:21] a good hand tonight as you're seated.
[21:23] God bless you.
[21:35] [Music]
[21:43] The fact is you're
[21:46] caught in a
[21:51] battle and you feel that
[21:54] You're
[21:55] losing the
[21:59] war. And the fact is it's
[22:04] raon for so
[22:08] long that your steps have grown
[22:12] weary and soul.
[22:17] But that's just the
[22:20] facts of the
[22:24] matter. Cuz the truth has not left you
[22:33] behind. When the facts have you bound up
[22:38] in
[22:42] sorrow, the truth sets you free. One
[22:47] more
[22:50] time. And the truth
[22:52] is you're not
[22:58] forsaken. And the truth is you won't be
[23:07] denied. The facts may be stacked
[23:11] up against you right now.
[23:18] But the truth
[23:20] is God's on your
[23:26] side. Now in fact there have been
[23:30] times you have
[23:34] questioned should you throw up your
[23:39] hands just give
[23:43] in? And in fact, you said there's just
[23:48] no
[23:51] reason to keep
[23:53] fighting when you'll never
[23:58] win.
[24:00] Oh, but that's not the
[24:04] end of the
[24:08] story. Cuz the truth says you
[24:12] shall
[24:17] overcome. When the fact says you're
[24:21] almost
[24:25] defeated, the truth is you already won.
[24:35] And the truth
[24:36] is you're not
[24:41] [Applause]
[24:42] forsaken. And the truth is you won't be
[24:51] denied. The facts may be stacked
[24:55] up against you right
[24:59] now. And the truth
[25:02] is God's on your
[25:08] side. And the truth
[25:10] is you're
[25:12] not
[25:16] forsaken. And the truth is you won't be
[25:22] denied.
[25:26] The facts may be stacked
[25:29] up against you right
[25:35] now, but the truth
[25:38] is God's on your side.
[25:44] [Music]
[25:48] [Applause]
[26:02] [Music]
[26:20] the Blood of
[26:22] Jesus speaks for
[26:25] me. Be still my
[26:27] soul. Redeeming
[26:31] love out of the dust of
[26:36] Calary is rising to the throne above.
[26:43] There is no
[26:45] vengeance. Sin is
[26:47] cry while it is
[26:50] finished fills the
[26:52] sky. Forgiveness is the final plea. The
[26:59] blood of Jesus speaks for me.
[27:08] My heart can
[27:10] barely take it in. He pardons all my
[27:16] guilty
[27:18] stains. Surrender all my shame to him.
[27:24] He breaks the curse of every chain. My
[27:29] sin is great but greater still. The
[27:34] boundless grace his heart
[27:38] reveals a mercy
[27:41] deeper than the sea. The blood of Jesus
[27:46] speaks for me.
[27:50] [Music]
[27:58] When my
[28:00] accuser makes the claim that I should
[28:05] die for my
[28:07] offense, I point him to that rugged
[28:12] frame where I found life at Christ
[28:17] expense. See from his hands, his feet
[28:23] aside, the fountain
[28:26] flowing deep and wide. Oh, hear it.
[28:31] Shout the
[28:33] victory. The blood of Jesus speaks for
[28:40] me. Worthy is the lamb. Lamb for sinners
[28:45] slain. Jesus, Lord of all. Glory to his
[28:50] name. Heaven crying out. Let the earth
[28:55] proclaim power in the blood. Glory to
[29:00] his name. Heaven crying out. Let the
[29:04] earth proclaim power in the blood. Glory
[29:10] to his name.
[29:15] Oh, let my soul arise and
[29:19] sing. My
[29:22] confidence is not in
[29:25] vain. The one who fights for me is king.
[29:32] His oath, his
[29:34] covenant and
[29:36] remain. No condemnation.
[29:40] Now I dread. Eternal hope is mine
[29:46] instead. His word will stand. I stand
[29:51] redeemed. The blood of Jesus speaks for
[29:57] me. Amazing
[30:00] love. How can it
[30:04] be? The blood of Jesus
[30:11] speaks for
[30:13] [Music]
[30:22] me. Enjoy those songs tonight. Praise
[30:25] the Lord. Let's stand if you will just
[30:27] as pastor gets ready to come bring us
[30:30] the word of the Lord tonight. We
[30:31] certainly want to pray for our pastor.
[30:33] God will just use him and give him
[30:34] strength in his body. Certainly
[30:36] appreciate him, Sister Carol, being able
[30:38] to be back in the house of God with us
[30:39] tonight. Amen. Our God reigns.
[30:42] How many of you say amen to that? Our
[30:44] God reigns. Our God
[30:48] [Music]
[30:50] reigns. Yes. Our God
[30:56] reigns. Oh, our God reigns.
[31:04] Oh, our God
[31:09] reigns. Yes, our God
[31:14] reigns. He reigns. Yes, our God reigns.
[31:21] Our God. Oh, our God
[31:27] reign.
[31:30] Our God
[31:34] reigns. Oh our God reigns. Sing it to
[31:41] him. Yes. Our God
[31:47] reigns. Oh our God
[31:52] reign.
[31:55] Our God
[32:00] [Music]
[32:10] praise and soon we will too. Keep it
[32:17] going. Soon we will too.
[32:23] Oh yes, soon we will
[32:29] do. Oh, our God
[32:33] praise. Everybody
[32:36] know our
[32:40] God. Our
[32:42] God, our
[32:46] God. Our
[32:49] God, our God.
[32:51] [Music]
[32:53] Yes,
[32:56] he praise. Yes,
[33:03] he praise the
[33:06] Lord.
[33:09] Hallelujah. Well, I believe we're
[33:10] already reigning right now.
[33:13] That's right. Kings and priests, we have
[33:16] a dominion. Thank the Lord. How is
[33:20] everybody?
[33:22] fighting the devil. Yeah.
[33:25] Are you winning?
[33:28] Well, think ain't there as many if you
[33:29] winning as fighting. What in the world's
[33:31] going on here?
[33:33] The thing of it is you have to keep your
[33:35] head above the water and keep fighting
[33:38] him. and knowing that every day that you
[33:41] live in this life and overcome, you're
[33:44] one day closer to the rapture,
[33:46] one day closer to that resurrection and
[33:49] what we're all longing for. I want to
[33:52] apologize to you that I wasn't able to
[33:53] be here Sunday. I got up and I wasn't
[33:58] feeling good, but I was going to come
[34:00] anyhow and sent my scriptures and quotes
[34:04] and stuff and my throat. It's probably a
[34:07] good thing I didn't come because I
[34:09] sounded like Jeremiah the bullfrog. I
[34:11] couldn't hardly talk. The longer I was
[34:13] up, the worse I felt. And Carol said,
[34:14] "You've got to call somebody. You need
[34:16] to call somebody." I said, "It's too
[34:18] late. It's too late." So, she finally
[34:20] called Sister Jennifer Hara and told her
[34:24] the situation. Said, "Don't want to know
[34:26] where Brother Joe take the service." She
[34:27] said, "He'll be glad to take
[34:31] it." I'm not sure if they've even spoke
[34:34] yet over that.
[34:38] Amen. But I so appreciate brother Joe
[34:41] taking the service and I already done an
[34:43] awesome job. So appreciate it. So I
[34:46] spent several days in bed.
[34:51] Sick as a horse.
[34:55] So I feel like just wearing that devil's
[34:57] hideout tonight.
[35:06] Amen. It's like, you know, whenever God
[35:10] blesses us really good and does some
[35:12] wonderful things for us, it's almost
[35:14] like it gives the devil just a little
[35:16] bit of a chance there to kind of mess
[35:19] your hair
[35:20] up. Now, I'm one of them type of guys. I
[35:23] don't like my hair messed up. Now, I
[35:26] know some of you folks used to think I
[35:28] wore a rug. This is all mine. Yeah.
[35:31] Okay. I love my little granddaughters,
[35:34] all six of them. But that's one thing
[35:36] Poppy didn't like. Them take them
[35:39] fingers and put it in my
[35:42] hair. I go over and see a doctor over at
[35:46] Tri City's cancer place over there. I
[35:48] had one removed off my nose several
[35:50] years ago and he doesn't have any hair.
[35:54] So he'd love, you know, he would love to
[35:57] get his fingers and every time he'd come
[35:58] at me, he'd start smiling. He said, "I
[36:00] love to do this to your hair."
[36:04] So that's where the devil likes to do us
[36:06] sometimes. And what's amazing is the
[36:08] Lord will let him do it every now and
[36:10] then just to see what we'll do. Amen. So
[36:13] you know what we do, don't you?
[36:16] That's right. Just punch him back.
[36:20] So he punched me Sunday. Guess what?
[36:23] It's our turn tonight. Amen.
[36:27] Amen.
[36:32] So, praise the Lord. We're
[36:33] so so happy to to be together here
[36:37] tonight. And um we're going to we're
[36:40] going to read some scriptures here. But
[36:44] before we
[36:46] do, I've got um quite a a pile of prayer
[36:50] calls and we're going to pray over them
[36:53] before we before we read the word. I'm
[36:56] sure that probably uh most of you have
[36:58] heard about um brother Michael Carter
[37:03] um had a really last few days really
[37:07] rough time and as far as the doctor's
[37:11] report it's not a very good one. So they
[37:14] give him from a few hours maybe to a few
[37:16] days as far as to live. He's got a brain
[37:20] bleed. Um just a lot going on in his
[37:23] life. So I talked to him today from the
[37:26] hospital on the phone and he wanted
[37:28] me to bring the request before you all
[37:32] as his church family that you'd be
[37:35] mindful of him and that you'd pray. And
[37:38] I told him absolutely we will. Will we
[37:42] not? Yes we will. And he wanted a prayer
[37:45] call. Also, brother Jeremy Asher has a
[37:49] family member with
[37:51] cancer and another family member with
[37:56] cancer. Sister Baker wanted a prayer
[37:59] cloth and also brother Baker wanted a
[38:02] prayer
[38:03] cloth. How many of you have needs and
[38:06] requests on your heart tonight?
[38:09] Oh, I'm so glad that we have a loving
[38:13] father to go to with all these needs in
[38:16] our lives. Brother Daryl and I was
[38:18] talking about it back in the office
[38:20] before I came out that there's so much
[38:22] sickness and so much things going on
[38:24] anymore. Me and Carol talk about it all
[38:26] the time that basically you just change
[38:29] the name of a diagnosis and the name of
[38:33] the individual because you get this and
[38:35] prayed through and then this comes up
[38:37] and that one and that one and it seems
[38:39] like that it's ongoing. But I was by
[38:42] myself today praying, talking to the
[38:44] Lord and the scriptures came back to me
[38:48] before the Exodus and how that the Bible
[38:52] says that God heard the cries of his
[38:56] people. I personally don't think that
[38:58] all these things happen to us by
[39:00] accident. Do you? No. I wonder if the
[39:04] Lord don't allow things sometimes to be
[39:06] turned up on us to get us more desperate
[39:09] than what we are. Yes.
[39:12] Amen. Let's pray together. Hold your
[39:15] request, your need there in your heart
[39:17] before the
[39:18] Lord. Heavenly Father, it's such an
[39:20] honor for us to be gathered together
[39:23] again here tonight.
[39:26] Lord, we so missed being here on Sunday
[39:29] and being in your presence and being
[39:32] with the saints of God. I believe Lord
[39:35] that some of these people standing right
[39:38] here in this place tonight, we will
[39:41] spend eternity together. We love one
[39:45] another. We feel for each other when
[39:47] we're going through hard
[39:50] times. Lord, if it was left up to me, uh
[39:54] I would probably take most of their
[39:56] troubles away and most of their sickness
[39:59] away.
[40:00] And that's because I don't understand
[40:02] like you understand. I look at it many
[40:05] times from human compassion and human
[40:09] sympathy. I see the tears as they
[40:11] trickle down their eyes and I see the
[40:13] heaviness in their hearts. And it it
[40:17] weighs on me. I'm their shepherd. How
[40:19] can it not? And I can't look like you
[40:22] can look. I can't see what you can see.
[40:25] So I pray Lord when we get to that spot
[40:28] that you'd help us to have a little bit
[40:31] more in insight to know that you're
[40:35] still in
[40:37] control. Father, we just pray all these
[40:40] prayer calls tonight, Lord
[40:42] Jesus. Dear God, people that had
[40:45] confidence and our prayers with the
[40:48] saints of God here, Lord, we pray that
[40:51] you'd move for each one of them. We pray
[40:54] for brother Michael Carter today. So I
[40:57] talked to him on the phone and he said,
[41:00] "Brother
[41:01] Donnie, if the people of the
[41:04] church will get what you're
[41:07] preaching," he said, "It'll get us ready
[41:10] to go meet the
[41:12] Lord." I said, "I sure hope so, brother
[41:14] Michael. That's my desire." He said,
[41:17] "That's what I want more than anything
[41:19] else in this world."
[41:21] Father, you see where he's at. Dear God,
[41:24] be mindful of our brother tonight. We
[41:26] pray in the name of Jesus. Brother and
[41:29] Sister Baker, Lord, help them. You see
[41:32] what they're going through. Father,
[41:34] bring healing to their bodies. Lord,
[41:37] Brother Jeremy's got two requests. Your
[41:39] father and you know these these family
[41:42] members that's dealing with cancer. I
[41:45] understand brother Jeremy and two of his
[41:47] daughters are are sick and not feeling
[41:50] well. May the presence of God move for
[41:52] him. I know there's others here that's
[41:55] fighting flu and COVID and different
[41:57] things. God, would you move forward? I
[42:00] thank you tonight, Lord, that I'm able
[42:02] to stand here tomorrow or yesterday
[42:05] rather. I started feeling somewhat
[42:07] better, but Carol said, "You're
[42:09] absolutely a miracle compared to what
[42:11] you were, and I'm grateful, Lord. I
[42:14] thank you for helping me." You see, I
[42:17] was talking got a little bit of a cough.
[42:18] And I pray that you'd help me tonight,
[42:20] Lord, that it wouldn't hinder me in the
[42:23] service. Lord, we've come here hungry,
[42:26] Jesus. We're needy. We need strength for
[42:29] our journey. And Lord God, we believe
[42:32] this is a place where we can get it.
[42:34] Help us tonight. We ask in the name of
[42:37] the Lord Jesus. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[42:43] Let's turn to uh Genesis if you would
[42:47] with me. Genesis chapter 1 verse
[42:53] 11. I love this. Excuse
[42:59] me. I love this. in in
[43:02] Genesis, of course, Brother Brandham
[43:04] called it the seed chapter of the
[43:08] Bible, and the great head planter
[43:12] certainly knew the kind of seeds to
[43:15] plant. And God said, "Let the earth
[43:20] bring forth
[43:21] grass, the herb yielding seed, and the
[43:26] fruit tree yielding fruit after his
[43:29] kind.
[43:31] whose seed is in
[43:35] itself upon the earth. And it was
[43:39] so. And the earth brought forth
[43:43] grass, an herb yielding
[43:47] seed after his
[43:49] kind, and the tree yielding
[43:53] fruit whose seed was in
[43:57] itself after his kind. And God saw that
[44:02] it was good. And the evening and the
[44:06] morning were the third day. May the Lord
[44:09] bless his words. You may be
[44:14] seated. Now let us read in the Song of
[44:17] Solomon chapter 4 verse 16.
[44:25] Awake, O north
[44:27] wind, and
[44:29] come thou
[44:32] south. Blow upon my
[44:35] garden that the spices thereof may flow
[44:40] out. Let my beloved come into his
[44:44] garden and eat his pleasant fruits.
[44:50] But how is it possible that the
[44:54] beloved would ever be able to get
[44:56] anything out
[44:58] of ground that was almost
[45:03] uninhabitable? How could the beloved
[45:05] ever sew his righteous
[45:09] seed
[45:10] into hearts that were filled with
[45:15] whoredom?
[45:17] How could the holy righteous
[45:20] God ever sow his sacred holy
[45:25] seed in contaminated
[45:28] ground which without question had been
[45:32] so
[45:33] defiled and so rotten and so
[45:37] corrupt. But yet we see from this in in
[45:41] the Song of Solomon that something had
[45:44] happened to this young woman, the
[45:47] Schulamite as we know her. And God in
[45:52] the type is showing that down through
[45:55] church ages he would have a people. He
[45:59] longed for them in the Old Testament,
[46:02] but the law could never produce it. In
[46:05] Jeremiah, he says, "Where is the writing
[46:09] of your mother's
[46:11] divorcement?" He put them away. Hosea,
[46:15] he told him to marry a
[46:18] prostitute. I mean, it was a terrible
[46:20] thing. Terrible thing for a man to have
[46:23] to do. And yet, he was acting out God's
[46:26] own drama of his own life.
[46:30] So he goes and and takes a
[46:33] woman and she becomes
[46:36] his. He straightens her out for a bit.
[46:40] She seems to be doing well for a while.
[46:43] Then what does she do? Goes right back
[46:45] to that same
[46:48] lifestyle. He heard that they was having
[46:51] slaves for sale. and he goes to the
[46:55] market and he finds her and she's up on
[46:59] the market for
[47:02] sale and he bet off until he paid the
[47:06] highest
[47:08] price. No doubt in her mind wondering
[47:11] what will he
[47:12] do? He had the right to kill
[47:15] her. She was his property.
[47:19] He could sell her into
[47:21] slavery, take her to the
[47:23] Neabotans, take her to wherever he
[47:26] wanted, but instead he redeemed
[47:30] her. Now, God had the prophet to do this
[47:33] to show as with
[47:36] Israel. We go to Ezekiel
[47:39] 16 and he says that about Israel. You
[47:43] was in your blood when I found you and
[47:46] you were like a baby when I brought you
[47:48] out of the land of
[47:49] Egypt. You were still in the afterbirth
[47:52] in our
[47:54] language. And no one had salted you,
[47:58] which is that time what they would do to
[47:59] a newborn. They'd wash it and then
[48:01] they'd sprinkle salt on it and then wash
[48:04] it off again.
[48:06] And he said, 'I I I I passed by you and
[48:08] I found you in your blood. So the
[48:11] afterbirths are still all over Israel.
[48:15] And he said, 'I took you into my
[48:18] house. I gave you honey. I gave you
[48:21] milk. I fed you. I put shoes on your
[48:26] feet. And he talks about all the things
[48:28] that he done. I gave you my oil and my
[48:30] wine. And he tells them all the
[48:33] blessings that he gave to them. And then
[48:35] what did you do when you grew up in what
[48:39] the Bible calls at the time of
[48:43] love? At the time of love, you opened
[48:47] yourself up to every
[48:50] man. So instead of the men hiring a
[48:55] prostitute, Israel hired men. And God
[48:59] said, "This is the way you treat me.
[49:01] This is the way you treat me as your
[49:04] husband. I clothed you with
[49:08] embroidery. I gave you shoes which was
[49:11] sign of wealthy people. And remember
[49:13] they were poppers when they come out of
[49:15] the land of
[49:16] Egypt. And yet God went through this
[49:19] over and over, generation after
[49:22] generation dealing with the people of
[49:25] Israel. but knowing there would come a
[49:28] time when he would be able to reclaim
[49:32] the ground of
[49:35] humanity and so change their
[49:38] nature that he could plant his seed in
[49:42] the New Testament in a way that the Old
[49:45] Testament could never be done. Now, if
[49:48] you're sitting here tonight and you're
[49:50] really born again by the spirit of God,
[49:53] you've got the seal of the living God on
[49:55] your soul and you read about Jeremiah
[49:58] and Ezekiel and Naam and Habacook and
[50:00] Zephaniah and Zachchariah and all the
[50:02] prophets of the Old Testament thing how
[50:04] great they were and they were. And you
[50:06] read about John the Baptist and he was a
[50:08] great man. Yet Jesus said, "The least in
[50:12] the kingdom of God is greater than
[50:15] John." Why? The blood had not been shed.
[50:17] John had not been born again even though
[50:20] he had the Holy Ghost from his mother's
[50:22] womb, but not like you've got it. So,
[50:25] you're sitting here tonight, young
[50:26] people, old people, middle-aged people,
[50:29] and you are actually living out what the
[50:33] Father has desired for thousands of
[50:37] years, that his seed would finally be
[50:40] able to be sown into gardens on the
[50:44] earth that still have the potential to
[50:49] become weedy, to become an onslaught of
[50:54] hell. hail storms of life can hit them.
[50:57] It's not like that. He takes the ground
[50:59] itself and glorifies the ground. But he
[51:03] leaves the ground human. He leaves the
[51:06] ground
[51:07] temperamental. He leaves the ground
[51:10] influenced by sadness and and sickness
[51:13] and unhappiness and depression sometimes
[51:17] and all kinds of things that the ground
[51:20] still deals with. Anybody still deal
[51:22] with that sort of thing in life? But the
[51:25] miracle, the miracle is that he sews his
[51:29] seed down in the bequeafd part of the
[51:33] human nature and makes that his own and
[51:37] puts his sign of ownership, which is his
[51:41] seal of the Holy Ghost, on that soul.
[51:45] And after that soul has been redeemed,
[51:47] both he and the devil in the
[51:50] battleground of our mind war every day
[51:55] and they fire their ammunition back and
[51:57] forth, back and forth. What is it?
[52:00] Thoughts. Any of y'all had them today?
[52:04] Thoughts of good and thoughts that ain't
[52:06] so good. Thoughts from the Lord and
[52:09] thoughts that you know where they're
[52:10] from? They're from the devil. Why? Where
[52:12] in the world could you mean children of
[52:14] God go through that? Absolutely. If
[52:16] anybody's going to deal with it,
[52:18] children of God are. You imagine that it
[52:21] must have been quite a victory for this
[52:24] young woman to be able to come to this
[52:26] place to where she could finally change
[52:29] ownership that it was no longer her
[52:32] garden. It was no longer her plants, but
[52:36] it was actually his garden and his
[52:39] plants. The ownership had now been
[52:43] transferred to where she was able to
[52:46] recognize all I am is a parcel of
[52:50] ground. I'm a recipient of God's divine
[52:54] nature and mercy. Now I mentioned to you
[52:57] the other night and I'll say it to you
[52:59] again in in chapter 5 verse one. I am
[53:03] come into my garden, my sister, my
[53:09] spouse. Now think of what a double
[53:12] relationship that is here expressed from
[53:16] the very heart of the bridegroom to the
[53:19] bride. I have come into. Now I want you
[53:22] to notice different from the Old
[53:24] Testament. I've not come around the
[53:28] spirit of God came around the children
[53:31] of Israel. But in here in the New
[53:34] Testament, he comes into his garden to
[53:38] take up his permanent abode. I came into
[53:42] my garden, my sister, my spouse. Now my
[53:46] sister is of the same divine nature.
[53:51] Spouse is by choice. Sister is by same
[53:56] parentthood.
[53:58] You see, this could not be said of the
[54:01] Old Testament church, and I know you
[54:03] remember reading it in the Gospels that
[54:05] Jesus called in in St. John 14, he he
[54:08] called his disciples friends, and he led
[54:11] up even with chapter 11 and 12 and 13 as
[54:14] he's walking with them in chapter 14
[54:17] through 17 going in the garden of
[54:19] Gethsemane. And he unveils things that
[54:22] he had kept secret for all these
[54:24] thousands of years. And he said, "I'll
[54:27] call you friends. You're not just
[54:29] servants because a servant does not know
[54:32] what he m his master does, but I'm
[54:34] calling you friends. I'm giving you an
[54:37] intimate place with me." But after the
[54:40] resurrection, he says, "Go tell my
[54:42] brothers that I have risen from the
[54:45] dead." So what now has happened?
[54:49] Something has brought about a change
[54:51] that it moves from friends. I want to be
[54:54] more than just an acquaintance of Jesus.
[54:57] I don't know about you, I want to be
[54:59] more. Being a friend is awesome. Amen.
[55:02] But how many friends have you invited to
[55:04] your house? How many of your friends
[55:07] invite you to their house? Now, some
[55:10] close friends you will, but do you
[55:12] invite all of your friends? Do you
[55:15] invite every person that you know? No,
[55:17] we don't. I want to be more than a
[55:20] casual acquaintance of the Lord Jesus. I
[55:24] want to be kin to him. Now, I mentioned
[55:26] the other night and I saw some of the
[55:28] sisters here kind of snickered a little
[55:30] bit whenever I said it, but I'm going to
[55:31] say it again. No daughter of God should
[55:36] ever marry a man that is not her
[55:40] brother.
[55:42] No son of God should ever marry a woman
[55:46] that is not his sister.
[55:50] Amen.
[55:53] The Bible tells us not to be unequally
[55:56] yolked. The prophet tells us under no
[55:58] circumstance should a believer ever
[56:01] marry an unbeliever. Ahab did this
[56:05] wicked thing in the eyes of the Lord. So
[56:09] you see sisters, this is why it's worth
[56:11] the wait until you find a son of God,
[56:15] which is actually your brother first.
[56:19] You don't have to go out there and find
[56:21] you a Baptist boy or a Pentecostal boy
[56:23] and say the same thing about the young
[56:25] man. You don't need to go out there and
[56:27] find you some denominational prostitute.
[56:29] I'm going to try to lead her to the
[56:31] Lord. Well, good luck. You're going to
[56:32] do it without a promise from God. As a
[56:34] matter of fact, you have everything in
[56:36] the word against you ever happening. Oh,
[56:38] I've seen it happen, too. And people
[56:40] will take that and use that for their
[56:42] example instead of using the word as
[56:44] your example. The word should always be
[56:47] what you do your your guiding of your
[56:49] life by.
[56:51] But they get desperate and they run
[56:52] ahead of God and they well I I I'm
[56:54] desperate. I I've got to find somebody.
[56:57] You'd be better off if you wait till
[56:58] you're 45 years old and get your real
[57:01] brother and let that brother become the
[57:04] real spouse of your life than you would
[57:07] be settled for somebody that's not kin
[57:10] to your father. Because if they ain't,
[57:13] I'll tell you what they do. They'll make
[57:14] it hell on earth for you. And the word
[57:17] of life church said,
[57:20] now whenever we look today at where we
[57:22] are, this is one great difference of
[57:24] course between the bride and the church.
[57:26] And the church claims that they are the
[57:29] wife of God. But we know by the children
[57:34] that they're giving birth to that they
[57:37] cannot be having relation with God the
[57:41] word because the offspring she's giving
[57:45] birth to hate the word and they love
[57:48] denomination. As I mentioned to the
[57:50] youth the other night in the youth
[57:51] service, and I checked it that Thursday
[57:54] before we had the youth service, that
[57:55] there are now over
[57:59] 45,000 denominations around the world.
[58:03] There were 900 and something when
[58:05] brother Brandham was here. So look how
[58:08] it has exploded with denominational
[58:12] camps. Well, praise the Lord. So, and
[58:16] then people think we don't need a
[58:17] prophet. Well, if we ever needed one, we
[58:19] needed one in this age. Now, think then,
[58:23] so the ground is polluted everywhere you
[58:26] go. And all them denominations are of
[58:28] course every one of them believing they
[58:30] have the right. If they don't, why would
[58:32] they start a new one? If they all
[58:33] believe the same thing, they're all
[58:34] going then just, you know, believe
[58:36] whatever you want to believe. But they
[58:38] have divided and split and separated.
[58:40] And to be honest, we can't say too much
[58:41] about them because the message is
[58:43] becoming just about as bad. We're split
[58:46] and divided. is going to come to a spot.
[58:48] Boy, I'll tell you one thing. I don't
[58:49] know if we're going to have much
[58:50] fellowship with anybody left. I hope we
[58:52] never get to that place. I'll tell you
[58:54] that right now. When we get to a place
[58:56] that we think we're the only ones,
[58:57] right? We ever one need to come up at
[58:59] this altar and ask God to get that thing
[59:01] off of us. Well, praise the Lord. Now,
[59:05] see that the only way that we could ever
[59:08] all of us be of the same nature because
[59:11] humanly we'll never agree on everything.
[59:14] We'll never agree on every ideology that
[59:17] we will have and there will be opinions
[59:20] that we will have. Well, I don't see it
[59:21] that way and I don't see it that way.
[59:23] And if we're waiting for everybody to
[59:25] come to that spot, we'll never have
[59:27] nobody. We'll never have no fellowship
[59:30] with any other church. We'll never have
[59:32] any visiting preachers to preach here
[59:33] and they won't have me to preach for
[59:35] them. Remember, it works both ways. But
[59:38] realize that if we are born of the
[59:40] spirit of God and we love this Lord
[59:44] Jesus with all of our heart and we
[59:46] accept the message of the hour and we
[59:48] look at what God is doing, then our
[59:51] family, my goodness, we we've lost
[59:53] enough the way it is by passing over and
[59:56] by those that have left out from among
[59:58] us. I think we need to realize how
[1:00:00] precious we ought to be to one another.
[1:00:03] Come on, somebody. Now, watch. He says,
[1:00:06] "I am come into my garden, my sister, my
[1:00:11] spouse. I have gathered my with my
[1:00:14] spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my
[1:00:18] honey. I have drunk my wine with my
[1:00:21] milk. Eat, oh friends, drink, yay, drink
[1:00:26] abundantly, oh beloved." Now actually
[1:00:29] this setting right here of chapter 5 is
[1:00:32] after he has went into his garden. Now
[1:00:37] what has taken place is that the friend
[1:00:40] of the bridegroom which made all the
[1:00:43] arrangements which in the New Testament
[1:00:45] was John the Baptist. Now remember the
[1:00:48] first man in the New Testament to
[1:00:50] mention the word
[1:00:53] bride. Anybody know what it was?
[1:00:56] Not
[1:00:57] Galia, not Simon
[1:01:00] Peter. It was not
[1:01:02] Capifas. It was not even
[1:01:04] Jesus. It was a man anointed with a
[1:01:07] spirit of Elijah, John the Baptist. So a
[1:01:12] man with the spirit of Elijah on him
[1:01:15] started talking about the bride. Amen.
[1:01:18] Before the groom ever hit the earth.
[1:01:21] Now John said, "Did not I tell you?" Now
[1:01:24] he was sent remember to forerun and the
[1:01:27] bridegroom the spirit of God coming down
[1:01:29] but remember the bridegroom was not just
[1:01:31] the body the humanity of Jesus you're
[1:01:35] not just married to humanity you're
[1:01:38] married to deity which is God you're
[1:01:42] married to God and God's a picky husband
[1:01:46] I'm telling you so whenever Jesus was
[1:01:49] here on the earth in Luke 252 too. The
[1:01:54] Bible says this about Jesus. So Jesus
[1:01:58] grew in wisdom and in stature before God
[1:02:03] and man. Now I realize we have a lot of
[1:02:05] know-it-alls in the earth today. But if
[1:02:08] Jesus didn't know it all, I dare say
[1:02:10] ain't none of the rest of us do. So if
[1:02:13] Jesus grew in wisdom and knowledge
[1:02:15] before God and man, I figure you and I
[1:02:17] can at least learn a little bit. Can
[1:02:20] anybody say amen to that tonight? So
[1:02:22] notice then that you are not just
[1:02:24] married to the humanity of the Lord
[1:02:27] Jesus. Remember the prophet tells us and
[1:02:29] it it absolutely chokes message people
[1:02:31] to death that even the body of Jesus
[1:02:34] could not rejoice before God because he
[1:02:38] said no flesh can glorify before God's
[1:02:42] presence. And remember it was not just
[1:02:44] that he become a curse on the tree. He
[1:02:48] become the serpent on the pole.
[1:02:52] That's why you cannot go that low. No
[1:02:55] one could stoop as low as he did because
[1:02:58] he came from such a high place and to
[1:03:01] condescend to such a place. No one could
[1:03:04] do that. None of us could do that but
[1:03:06] him. And we're not just married to his
[1:03:09] humanity, but we are married to deity.
[1:03:13] We must be of the same divine nature to
[1:03:17] be married to God. Is that right? So
[1:03:20] John the Baptist then he form him. He
[1:03:23] was Isaiah 40:3. He was also Malachi
[1:03:26] 3:1. He was also Malachi 4 verse half of
[1:03:30] verse 5. So he come to the earth and he
[1:03:34] forerun about six months of the Lord
[1:03:37] Jesus and he was there as a predicate to
[1:03:40] be able to announce that something is
[1:03:42] coming something is coming something is
[1:03:44] coming get ready get ready very odd very
[1:03:47] peculiar message and he's trying to warn
[1:03:50] the people and getting ready he's
[1:03:51] preparing the way before the Lord
[1:03:53] remember they didn't have interstate
[1:03:55] highways so whenever a king or a noble
[1:03:57] would come through and he would want to
[1:03:59] come through in his chariot or his buyer
[1:04:01] the iR which they would carry them on.
[1:04:03] They would have to send men before them
[1:04:06] and cut out the pass so they'd have
[1:04:08] hatchets and axes and this and that and
[1:04:10] the other and widen it up enough to make
[1:04:13] it through there. John the Baptist
[1:04:14] identified himself as that man. So John
[1:04:18] was sent to be able to get the bride the
[1:04:20] notification of the messenger of Malachi
[1:04:23] 3 to get the bride to that spot.
[1:04:26] Remember in the Old Testament when the
[1:04:27] vow was made, so the friend of the
[1:04:30] bridegroom, he could be either the
[1:04:32] father, he could be a lawyer, he could
[1:04:34] be a friend, he could be an uncle, but
[1:04:36] the bridegroom never went directly to
[1:04:39] the bride and made the wedding plans or
[1:04:43] even the engagement. And this is, you
[1:04:45] know, what really gets me about a lot of
[1:04:46] the message kids that they go to that
[1:04:48] rebellious stage in their life and they
[1:04:50] meet a boy, boy meets girl, and they
[1:04:52] said, "Mom and daddy don't like it. I
[1:04:54] don't care if they do or not. We'll get
[1:04:55] engaged that way. They'll they'll have
[1:04:57] to let us do it. Where in the world did
[1:04:58] you hear that trash at? Come on. I said,
[1:05:01] "Where'd you hear that trash?" Brother
[1:05:04] Bram never taught us no such nonsense.
[1:05:06] He taught us to go back to the Old
[1:05:08] Testament and look to them laws.
[1:05:11] Well, come on, somebody. Do you realize
[1:05:14] when
[1:05:15] I left the tents of Abraham and the
[1:05:18] Bible goes on in time and says that his
[1:05:21] mother found him his wife,
[1:05:25] He couldn't even go pick his own wife.
[1:05:28] It was not. Oh my. It was not It was not
[1:05:34] done that way. It's Satan that's trying
[1:05:36] to mess up many of the lives of our
[1:05:38] young people. Well, I promised I got to
[1:05:40] do it now. Oh, no. That's not the way it
[1:05:43] was made. Joseph, fear not to take unto
[1:05:46] thee Mary thy wife, for that which is
[1:05:48] conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:51] How was she his wife? because they
[1:05:54] sneaked around behind the building and
[1:05:56] kissed a little bit and said, "Will you
[1:05:57] marry me?" "Yeah, I'll marry you."
[1:05:58] "Okay, now let's go tell mom and daddy."
[1:06:00] Now, they got to let us do it. Nobody
[1:06:02] can stop us. That ain't the way it
[1:06:04] worked. And when the prophet said that
[1:06:06] the vows is what marries you, he had in
[1:06:09] mind the legal vows that come from the
[1:06:11] Old Testament through the New Oanian
[1:06:14] matchup.
[1:06:16] Well, praise the Lord. And if you listen
[1:06:18] to Marriage of the Lamb in 1962 in
[1:06:20] Phoenix, you'll hear him going through
[1:06:21] some of those things. And that's exactly
[1:06:23] what the church has done. You see, the
[1:06:25] church wants to link up with Jesus.
[1:06:27] Well, I'm I'm engaged to Jesus. I've got
[1:06:29] eternal security. Jesus can't put me
[1:06:31] away. I accepted him as my savior. I
[1:06:33] went down to the altar. Yes, sir. He
[1:06:35] kissed me. Kiss the son lest he be
[1:06:36] angry. He kissed me by his grace. He can
[1:06:38] never put me away in divorcement. I I
[1:06:41] belong to him. I got eternal security. I
[1:06:43] can drink. I can run around. I can lie.
[1:06:44] I can cheat and steal. I can do all the
[1:06:46] stuff I want to do. That's not the
[1:06:47] wedding vow. Oh, come on, somebody. But
[1:06:51] what does he do to you? He puts forth
[1:06:54] the requirements and you look at it and
[1:06:56] he looks at it. Now think when John the
[1:06:59] Baptist come to the earth and he forun
[1:07:02] this coming word. So then he announces
[1:07:05] now the there was some people there
[1:07:06] following John and and everybody started
[1:07:09] going to Jesus after John had done all
[1:07:12] this labor and stuff and some of John's
[1:07:14] disciples we'll call them message people
[1:07:16] and and some of the message people come
[1:07:18] to John and said master everybody's
[1:07:22] going to Jesus. I mean some of these
[1:07:24] message people had a real issue with it.
[1:07:30] Praise the Lord. Amen. Well, I tell you
[1:07:33] one thing. I I've got an issue with you
[1:07:35] tonight. If you don't want to get to
[1:07:37] Jesus. Oh, thank God for the messenger.
[1:07:40] Thank God for preachers. But preachers,
[1:07:42] if they're preaching us the truth,
[1:07:44] they're pointing us to Jesus. Not to
[1:07:47] have a relationship with them and not to
[1:07:49] know them and bring forth their
[1:07:51] children, but to bring forth Christ
[1:07:53] seed. I don't want you to bring forth a
[1:07:56] bunch of Reaganites in this church. I
[1:07:58] don't want you to bring forth a bunch of
[1:07:59] wardites or a bunch of brown ice or or a
[1:08:02] bunch of the rest of these preacherites.
[1:08:04] What we want to give birth here is
[1:08:06] little seed jeans of God. Amen. Come on,
[1:08:10] somebody. We preached that we brought
[1:08:12] forth enough colemanites. We brought
[1:08:14] forth enough Spencerites and Puitites
[1:08:17] and Reaganites and Wardites. We've got
[1:08:19] enough to We gotites and mites
[1:08:21] everywhere. It ain't no wonder that we
[1:08:23] ain't got enough power to blow the fuzz
[1:08:25] off of a peach. And we ain't got enough
[1:08:27] power to be able to cast out devils and
[1:08:29] heal the sick because we're still
[1:08:31] denominational. And if we don't get that
[1:08:33] old thing out of us, we're going to wind
[1:08:35] up being in the sight of God.
[1:08:38] God's going to marry a people that's
[1:08:39] going to have a virgin womb. And they
[1:08:42] will receive no man's seed. I don't care
[1:08:45] how long he's been preaching, how long
[1:08:47] he could stand up and call everybody out
[1:08:49] by name. Cast out devils till the cows
[1:08:52] come home. If he's packing hybrid seed,
[1:08:54] close your womb to
[1:09:01] him.
[1:09:03] Hallelujah. Woo!
[1:09:07] My
[1:09:08] John heard this, no doubt, brother
[1:09:11] Daryl, he must have felt an element of
[1:09:14] disappointment. He said, "Did not I tell
[1:09:17] you? Did not I tell you?" He said,
[1:09:19] "Look, listen, listen, friends." He
[1:09:21] said, "The friend of the bridegroom
[1:09:25] rejoices when he hears the bridegroom's
[1:09:28] voice." In other words, don't you
[1:09:30] understand? My mission has been
[1:09:33] complete. I have introduced the bride to
[1:09:37] the groom, and now I have been able to
[1:09:40] establish a relationship between the
[1:09:43] bride and the groom where they can speak
[1:09:46] back and forth to one another. Amen.
[1:09:50] They can speak back and forth to one
[1:09:52] another. And by me hearing the
[1:09:54] bridegroom's voice and I'm standing here
[1:09:56] with the bride and the bridegroom is
[1:09:59] speaking directly to the bride, my joy
[1:10:02] is complete. I rejoice because the
[1:10:06] bridegroom is speaking to the bride.
[1:10:10] Now you remember the parable in Matthew
[1:10:12] chapter 25 verse1. The kingdom of heaven
[1:10:14] shall be likened unto 10 virgins. Five
[1:10:16] were wise and five were foolish. Now,
[1:10:18] while the bridegroom tear, they all
[1:10:20] slumber and slept. About midnight, there
[1:10:22] went out a great cry. Go forth to meet
[1:10:24] the bridegroom. All those virgins arose
[1:10:26] and trimmed their lamps. Then, oh my,
[1:10:28] the foolish realized, "Our lamps have
[1:10:31] gone out." Oh, we ain't got no oil. Our
[1:10:33] lamps have gone out. Then said they unto
[1:10:35] the wise, "Give us of your oil, for our
[1:10:38] lamps have gone out." And the wise said
[1:10:39] unto the foolish, not so, lest there not
[1:10:42] be enough for ourselves and you also.
[1:10:44] But go to them that sell and buy for
[1:10:47] yourselves. And while they were gone,
[1:10:50] then a cry went forth. The bridegroom
[1:10:52] cometh, and they went out to meet them.
[1:10:54] And then the foolish virgins missed that
[1:10:57] coming. Now actually Jesus is giving the
[1:11:00] setting of where a wedding would have
[1:11:02] taken place. Very unusual uh compared to
[1:11:05] our western custom. So what would happen
[1:11:07] was that the bridegroom wouldn't
[1:11:09] actually tell the bride what day she's
[1:11:11] going to get married on. Now you sisters
[1:11:13] get nervous preparing a wedding. Now can
[1:11:15] you imagine how that would have been
[1:11:16] sis? And your wedding day, brother
[1:11:18] Malachi just holds off and he holds off
[1:11:20] and he holds off and he don't even tell
[1:11:22] you until the day
[1:11:24] off. Now what he does though before the
[1:11:28] day he will send the bride the wedding
[1:11:31] garment. The bride never went down to
[1:11:33] the bride store and picked it out for
[1:11:35] sale. But the bridegroom actually picked
[1:11:38] out the wedding garment. So, you know,
[1:11:40] this one thing that shows me that the
[1:11:43] churches are not going to get married to
[1:11:45] the Lord Jesus because her dress is too
[1:11:47] tight
[1:11:49] or it's too short or it's too low here
[1:11:52] and ain't got no back in it. I mean, my
[1:11:54] Lord, you go to some of these message
[1:11:55] wins and them women stand up there and
[1:11:57] you think, "Dear God, am I at a strip
[1:11:59] tea show or what in the world is this?"
[1:12:02] Well, I can tell you the Lord Jesus
[1:12:04] didn't send you that dress, sis. So, the
[1:12:07] bridegroom would go get the bride's
[1:12:09] dress. And guess who delivered it to the
[1:12:12] bride? Now, you take it however you want
[1:12:14] to because some folks don't feel like
[1:12:17] the message is that important. And we
[1:12:19] really don't need the friend of the
[1:12:20] bridegroom. If we don't hear the friend
[1:12:23] of the bridegroom's voice and know the
[1:12:26] preparation, you're going to stand naked
[1:12:29] before the bridegroom because the
[1:12:32] bridegroom, oh hallelujah, the friend of
[1:12:35] the bridegroom is the one who has the
[1:12:38] cross. No wonder God's prophet said,
[1:12:40] "Brother Steve, oh God, may I be able to
[1:12:43] take the cross of your word and dress
[1:12:46] your bride." He said, "God, if I can get
[1:12:49] her to stand still long enough,
[1:12:55] oh
[1:12:58] my." So, one day the bridegroom gets up
[1:13:01] and he tells beckons to say,
[1:13:04] "Hey, today's the
[1:13:07] day." Today? Yeah. Today's the
[1:13:11] day. Okay. So, so does she know it? No,
[1:13:14] she don't know it yet.
[1:13:17] I've already gave her the garment. I've
[1:13:19] gave her my word. Now, the five wise
[1:13:22] virgins, they didn't know either. The
[1:13:25] foolish virgin, they didn't know either.
[1:13:28] All they knew was it was the season.
[1:13:32] So, it was the last days
[1:13:36] and they knew that it was getting close,
[1:13:39] but they just didn't know. Will it be
[1:13:41] Monday? Could it be Tuesday? Well, it
[1:13:43] could be. Could it be Wednesday?
[1:13:44] Probably not. He wouldn't want you to
[1:13:45] miss church. So, more than likely it
[1:13:47] probably wouldn't be Wednesday. Of
[1:13:49] course, on second thought, church night
[1:13:50] might be a good night to get married or
[1:13:53] it could be Thursday. And then, of
[1:13:55] course, you could wait till Sunday
[1:13:56] because Sunday is another big church
[1:13:57] day. So, you really didn't know,
[1:14:00] sisters. So, you just wait, wait. Well,
[1:14:02] what would they do, brother Donnie? They
[1:14:04] would go right ahead. If there's
[1:14:06] planting gardens, they do it. You know,
[1:14:07] there's working around the house. Let's
[1:14:09] keep it busy. There's occupying. And
[1:14:10] they was waiting for who?
[1:14:15] who the friend of the
[1:14:19] bridegroom to come and tell them. So now
[1:14:22] let's say the bridegroom told the friend
[1:14:24] of the bridegroom on Monday morning at
[1:14:27] 9:00, today's the
[1:14:29] day. Oh, you imagine what he was, oh, oh
[1:14:33] my, praise God. So you know what he
[1:14:37] would do? He would go to the bride's
[1:14:40] father's house, which is where she still
[1:14:43] was at.
[1:14:45] And he would go there, knock on the
[1:14:47] door, and I mean, she knew by that look
[1:14:50] on his face, the shout had come. Amen.
[1:14:55] She knew today was the day of
[1:14:59] expectation. And he tells her, "Get
[1:15:02] ready. Get ready. Today's the day." Oh,
[1:15:05] today's the day, y'all. Oh my lord. Oh
[1:15:07] my lord. Now, sisters, can you imagine
[1:15:10] one day notice?
[1:15:16] But it shows you how little in reality
[1:15:20] she had to do.
[1:15:23] It shows you how little he had to do
[1:15:27] almost all of it. He made the
[1:15:30] preparation. He got the wine. He got the
[1:15:33] food. He got the stimulation of
[1:15:35] revelation. He got the seals. He got the
[1:15:38] church agent. He got fellowship by
[1:15:40] redemption. He got the token. Oh,
[1:15:43] hallelujah to God. He got the kinsman
[1:15:45] redeemer. He was the one that did all of
[1:15:48] the work. And she just had to occupy and
[1:15:51] be faithful and put her dress on at the
[1:15:54] right day. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:15:59] Put her dress on at the right day. And
[1:16:01] you imagine whenever it goes out said,
[1:16:03] "What time? What time will it be?" He
[1:16:04] said, "He didn't give me the hour."
[1:16:09] the hour of the
[1:16:11] day. I I I I don't I don't know. Now,
[1:16:15] Brother Brandham, well, will will the
[1:16:17] Lord come before you get done with these
[1:16:18] seals this week, brother, sister? I I
[1:16:22] don't
[1:16:23] know. Could be five years from now.
[1:16:25] Could be a thousand years from now. I
[1:16:27] don't know. But let's be ready,
[1:16:31] brother. Is it too late to have jail
[1:16:33] services? Brother Brenam, is it too late
[1:16:35] to get married now? Brother Sister, what
[1:16:37] what have I said that would make you
[1:16:38] think that? No, no. Just keep planting
[1:16:40] your ters.
[1:16:42] Oh, glory to God. Amen. So here he would
[1:16:47] come back and he would tell the
[1:16:49] bridegroom, you deliver the message.
[1:16:51] Yes.
[1:16:52] Yes. So it was the shout, the voice, and
[1:16:56] the trumpet. So now, what part did you
[1:16:59] deliver? I delivered the shout,
[1:17:01] sir. The message. I told her, but you
[1:17:05] didn't tell her the time. No, sir. I did
[1:17:07] not tell the time. So, did you see
[1:17:10] virgins along the way? Yes, I I saw I
[1:17:12] saw I saw the virgins there and they had
[1:17:15] their oil everything ready. Yep. Yep.
[1:17:17] Okay, sir. Now, you now you just tell me
[1:17:19] when you're ready. You You tell me. I
[1:17:22] I'll let you
[1:17:24] know. Okay. It's 9:00. He made it back
[1:17:27] by 11:15. We'll say, "Man, there he is.
[1:17:29] He Oh, he is so antsy. He's just Man,
[1:17:32] this guy is torn." You see, you don't
[1:17:34] understand why this guy is so torn
[1:17:37] up. If this
[1:17:39] woman is not a virgin
[1:17:43] when the bridegroom takes
[1:17:46] her, the friend is responsible. Oh,
[1:17:57] no wonder Paul said, "I have espoused
[1:18:01] you to Christ as a chase virgin, but I
[1:18:11] fear. Lest as the serpent begal Eve
[1:18:15] through his subtility, your mind should
[1:18:17] all be also be corrupted from the
[1:18:19] simplicity which is in Christ. You mean
[1:18:22] they were
[1:18:25] espoused? Aspousal ain't
[1:18:28] enough. He said, "I have espoused you,
[1:18:31] but that I may present
[1:18:36] you." Hallelujah.
[1:18:40] I don't want to shake you too bad, but I
[1:18:42] don't want to just be bride.
[1:18:47] I want to be wife.
[1:18:50] Revelation 19. Come and rejoice and let
[1:18:53] us be glad and make Mary for the
[1:18:55] marriage of the lamb has come and his
[1:18:58] wife
[1:19:01] has made herself not wife or bride but
[1:19:04] just made herself ready. Amen. So all
[1:19:08] the banquet sisters, it was took care
[1:19:10] of. All the flowers took care of. All
[1:19:13] the guests took care of. All you had to
[1:19:17] do was put on your message clothes. Just
[1:19:21] put on the cross of the word and just
[1:19:24] sat around like a little dy all day
[1:19:26] long. Well, glory to God. I feel like
[1:19:29] shouting a little bit, man. Alive. I'm
[1:19:31] fixing to move into my new home.
[1:19:34] Oh yeah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I've
[1:19:38] been faithful to the Lord every day of
[1:19:42] my life. Now I'm going. Yes. I'm going
[1:19:45] to be his wife. Oh, ain't it a good time
[1:19:48] serving Jesus? Yes, it's a good time
[1:19:51] serving the Lord. They said, "What in
[1:19:52] the world's the matter with her? Her
[1:19:54] bridegroom's on his way. Her
[1:19:56] bridegroom's on his way. And she don't
[1:19:58] know when and she don't know how. But
[1:20:00] all she knows she's getting out of here
[1:20:02] now because the grace of God has given
[1:20:05] her the garment. Oh, but maybe I will,
[1:20:07] maybe I won't. If you've got the
[1:20:09] garment, you will.
[1:20:11] Oh, whether you've shouted or not or
[1:20:13] jumped or not, or run or not, if you've
[1:20:16] got the wedding garment and the
[1:20:18] bridegroom has sent it by the hand of
[1:20:20] the messenger, there's no leaving you
[1:20:24] out.
[1:20:33] Of course, we know from Genesis
[1:20:37] 1, the
[1:20:39] evening and the
[1:20:41] morning were the first day. The evening
[1:20:46] and the morning were the second day. You
[1:20:48] see, the Hebrews don't begin their days
[1:20:50] like we do.
[1:20:53] The new day starts with the
[1:20:57] sunset, not at the rising with the sun.
[1:20:59] The way we start ours, but the evening
[1:21:02] and the morning are the first day. So
[1:21:05] let's say he done had it calculated how
[1:21:08] much time that the procession
[1:21:15] from from the dimension that he
[1:21:18] lived. And it might take just a a little
[1:21:21] bit of
[1:21:22] time to gather up
[1:21:25] millions of the elected.
[1:21:29] Oh
[1:21:32] Lord, and to release their
[1:21:35] theophes out from under the throne of
[1:21:39] God and let them take up
[1:21:43] bodies on the
[1:21:52] earth. Hallelujah.
[1:22:01] So maybe the day goes
[1:22:04] on, the sixth
[1:22:07] hour, the ninth
[1:22:10] hour, and then he tells the
[1:22:14] messenger, "It's
[1:22:17] time." So everybody gets together on
[1:22:20] this side. This is the
[1:22:23] bridegroom's side of the family.
[1:22:30] And here they
[1:22:32] start. So they get all their instruments
[1:22:35] when the church of Christ amongst them.
[1:22:37] I mean they all believed in music. So
[1:22:40] they got their instruments and their
[1:22:41] tambourines and man here they went. They
[1:22:44] started coming down through there and
[1:22:46] the bridegroom had on his bridegroom
[1:22:48] garments and he man you talking about
[1:22:51] something. He wasn't dressed like no
[1:22:53] high priest because he wasn't offering
[1:22:56] no blood. He wasn't coming down there
[1:22:58] KFS all. He was coming forth as a bright
[1:23:03] shouting
[1:23:05] word. And here he would
[1:23:08] come right by his
[1:23:11] side. Not
[1:23:13] Gabriel, not
[1:23:15] Michael, but who? The friend of the
[1:23:20] bridegroom. the seventh star.
[1:23:25] And he
[1:23:28] said, "And here they come with some
[1:23:33] [Music]
[1:23:41] music." Boy, here there was a dancing.
[1:23:44] Praise God. Hallelujah. Where y'all
[1:23:46] going? You going to a funeral? We're
[1:23:48] going to a wedding, man. It ain't burial
[1:23:50] time. It ain't dying time. It is
[1:23:53] marrying time. They'd go down through
[1:23:55] there with the music and they was a
[1:23:57] jumping and they was a hollering and a
[1:23:58] shouting around and here come the
[1:24:00] bridegroom and his offer garbage, but he
[1:24:05] wasn't packing the bride's dress. He had
[1:24:08] already seeded ahead of time. Oh yeah.
[1:24:12] By a seventh angel messenger.
[1:24:21] So here they come from one side of town
[1:24:25] maybe to the other
[1:24:26] side and but now she's getting
[1:24:31] antsy. I just hear her saying the
[1:24:34] evening light has come. It is a time
[1:24:37] that God and Christ are one. It's the
[1:24:40] evening time. Oh, praise the Lord. It's
[1:24:42] got to be soon now cuz it's the evening
[1:24:44] time. I see the sun is getting ready to
[1:24:47] set down there before long. But the
[1:24:49] setting of the sun only means it is the
[1:24:51] rising of the sun in just a little
[1:24:53] while. So I know it's got to be soon. I
[1:24:55] don't know exactly when it is. And all
[1:24:58] of a sudden they're
[1:25:07] here. Glory to God.
[1:25:11] I imagine some of you dry hide word of
[1:25:13] lifers would had a little bit of
[1:25:14] excitement about it. Well, glory to God.
[1:25:18] I'm getting married today.
[1:25:22] Hallelujah. Oh, this is what she's
[1:25:24] waited
[1:25:25] for. Here comes the bridegroom and
[1:25:28] standing right by
[1:25:31] him is his friend.
[1:25:44] But right before they get to her
[1:25:47] house, here's the
[1:25:51] virgins. Now, you see, the
[1:25:53] virgins were not the
[1:25:57] bride. Jesus nowhere in Matthew
[1:26:00] 25 says that the bride was in the
[1:26:03] virgins. They were guests.
[1:26:05] He used a
[1:26:07] typical Middle Eastern wedding ceremony.
[1:26:10] They were on their way to get the bride.
[1:26:12] He didn't stop at the virgin said,
[1:26:14] "Well, you're the bride and I'll take
[1:26:16] you." No, they were going to come along
[1:26:18] with them with the lights in their
[1:26:20] hands. Why?
[1:26:23] Nighttime. Night time. You don't need
[1:26:25] them at 9:00 in the morning. So, what do
[1:26:27] you do? Waited till the end time.
[1:26:31] waited till the last days
[1:26:34] at the setting of the sun because it's
[1:26:36] going to get darker and darker.
[1:26:38] And here they all they had their lamp
[1:26:40] and they had Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.
[1:26:43] I ain't got no oil. Oh goodness. Oh
[1:26:44] goodness. I I I I thought I had enough.
[1:26:47] Oh no. Oh no. Don't you understand what
[1:26:50] happened? The wick
[1:26:53] itself will burn for a while without
[1:26:57] oil.
[1:27:00] So their wit must have been on fire
[1:27:02] because they looked and said, "Glory to
[1:27:04] God, I got it. Hallelujah. I got it.
[1:27:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. I I I've got
[1:27:11] it." But the wick wasn't dipped down to
[1:27:14] the inside of the container in the sole
[1:27:17] of the
[1:27:19] container. So then they looked, "Oh my
[1:27:22] Lord. Oh no. Oh no. No. No. No. No.
[1:27:25] Don't tell me. Don't tell me."
[1:27:27] So they hear
[1:27:29] [Music]
[1:27:33] it. I said, "Glory to God. Glory to God.
[1:27:37] It's the coming of the Lord. It's the
[1:27:41] rapture." And
[1:27:43] again, no, no, no, no,
[1:27:46] no, no, no, no, no. Please don't go out.
[1:27:48] No,
[1:27:54] please. Mama, give me give me
[1:27:57] some
[1:27:59] deacons. Give me some more. Put it down.
[1:28:01] Let me ask somebody,
[1:28:04] please. Brother Donnie, I
[1:28:16] can't. So, do they stop the
[1:28:20] festivities? Do they put it on hold?
[1:28:26] No, neither will the Lord God of
[1:28:29] heaven stop the
[1:28:34] festivities of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:28:36] and the earthly bride because millions
[1:28:40] of church
[1:28:41] members have no
[1:28:44] oil in their vessels.
[1:28:52] So here they come. The music's getting
[1:28:55] louder, louder. Look at the decadence
[1:28:58] upon the bridegroom's voice, his face,
[1:29:01] his appearance as he's
[1:29:04] now. Oh, he's getting a little bit happy
[1:29:07] himself. Oh, you say, "Brother Dolly,
[1:29:09] sure you don't sing." The Lord sings.
[1:29:11] Ain't you ever read that scripture in
[1:29:14] Zephaniah where God said, "I will sing
[1:29:19] over
[1:29:20] you." That's what the bridegroom would
[1:29:23] do when he would go to get close to the
[1:29:26] house. Well, darling, he'd go to singing
[1:29:30] a love song. You imagine that music,
[1:29:32] right? Oh, hallelujah. I know you think
[1:29:35] I'm crazy, but let me alone. Hallelujah.
[1:29:38] Whenever he'd come close, he'd go to
[1:29:40] say, "Come away, my love. Come away, my
[1:29:44] fair one. Come away."
[1:29:51] And the music starts
[1:29:55] dropping. Them shouters is trying to
[1:29:58] hold theirs. Glory to God. Them dancers,
[1:30:00] man, they're wound up counting an eight
[1:30:02] day clock. They're
[1:30:05] just, you know, the Jews danced a lot.
[1:30:07] Anyway, the Lord told them, "Dance." All
[1:30:10] their festivities, that's what they
[1:30:11] done. They just dance. He said, "Let
[1:30:12] your servants dance. Let your slaves
[1:30:14] dance. Just dance. Get out there and
[1:30:16] dance."
[1:30:17] And weddings is one of them. I mean,
[1:30:19] they had them seven days long.
[1:30:27] Here he
[1:30:28] comes. She's right behind the door.
[1:30:38] But she can't open
[1:30:40] yet. His presence has got to be so
[1:30:43] close. There's just a certain
[1:30:49] time. Then she can reach and take the
[1:30:53] handle and open the door.
[1:31:02] He steps up to the
[1:31:07] door. Now
[1:31:09] listen, the friend of the bridegroom
[1:31:12] comes
[1:31:13] around, takes the
[1:31:17] bride, and says, "My
[1:31:19] Lord, your
[1:31:23] queen." I wish I was out there in the
[1:31:25] middle of that field by myself. I'd be
[1:31:27] running, screaming like a wild Indian
[1:31:29] right now.
[1:31:38] So the friend presented the
[1:31:44] bride to the
[1:31:46] groom. My
[1:31:48] lord, your
[1:31:51] queen. Now remember a year prior to
[1:31:56] this, when a boy was born, they planted
[1:31:58] a certain tree. When a girl was born,
[1:32:00] they planted another kind of
[1:32:02] tree. Whenever they got married, they
[1:32:05] cut down both of those trees and took
[1:32:08] made two tent poles to make a square
[1:32:10] tent called a
[1:32:13] hoopa. So they would spread that
[1:32:21] hoopa. You know where it was?
[1:32:25] He'd been building her a
[1:32:31] house. He'd been building her a
[1:32:34] house. So they cut down his tree and her
[1:32:37] tree. He died on one. She died on
[1:32:41] another. He had his cross. You got
[1:32:46] yours. And they stretched them poles out
[1:32:49] under the hoop.
[1:32:54] Now
[1:33:00] he the the friend of the bridegroom
[1:33:03] presents
[1:33:06] her and he steps in the threshold of the
[1:33:10] door, takes her by the
[1:33:13] hands. Come with me. and backs out the
[1:33:17] doorway and pulls her out of
[1:33:21] time into
[1:33:24] eternity and breaks the threshold of
[1:33:27] atoms and lights and
[1:33:36] molecules takes her by the
[1:33:39] hand. They spin around.
[1:33:42] Harry,
[1:33:44] Larry, all the rest of the musicians
[1:33:46] start cranking that music
[1:33:51] up. Sister Janet grabs her tambourine.
[1:33:55] Somebody else grabs her timber. Somebody
[1:33:56] else grabs her banjo. Well, maybe not a
[1:33:58] banjo,
[1:33:59] but they grab their hand claps and they
[1:34:02] go to Glory to God. Hallelujah. Here we
[1:34:05] go. We're going right back
[1:34:07] down. Oh, thank God, friends. Do you
[1:34:10] realize where we are?
[1:34:13] to hear me.
[1:34:17] This is the
[1:34:23] hour. They scream, they holler, they
[1:34:31] shout till they get back to the new
[1:34:36] place. The bride and the groom go under
[1:34:38] the
[1:34:40] hoopa. Now they say a few words to each
[1:34:43] other. They take a cup of
[1:34:46] wine. He drinks it first. She drinks it.
[1:34:51] Hands it backs to him. He takes the cup,
[1:34:53] sets it on the ground, crashes it. Your
[1:34:57] mortality, my
[1:34:59] sweetheart, is finished forever.
[1:35:12] Then he takes
[1:35:20] her into the bridal
[1:35:24] chamber. Not the bridegroom chamber, but
[1:35:28] he takes her into the bridal chamber
[1:35:30] which he himself has prepared for her.
[1:35:34] And there she
[1:35:36] becomes his
[1:35:45] wife. When he breaks the virgin
[1:35:49] veil according to the book of
[1:35:52] Deuteronomy, they would take
[1:35:54] cloths put under the virgin
[1:35:57] girl and the veil would be broken.
[1:36:01] The
[1:36:02] tokens of her
[1:36:04] virginity were kept as a
[1:36:08] witness against the false accuser.
[1:36:16] Glory to
[1:36:19] God. Acts
[1:36:23] 5:1 is describing what I just described
[1:36:26] to you.
[1:36:28] I am coming to my
[1:36:30] garden. My sister, my spouse. I've
[1:36:33] gathered my spice. I've eaten my
[1:36:37] honeycomb. I've took my faith, my
[1:36:39] virtue, my knowledge, my temperance, my
[1:36:42] brotherly kindness, my godliness. I I've
[1:36:44] took the trials of Pergamos. I've took
[1:36:47] the faith of Ephesus. I've took the
[1:36:49] brotherly kindness of E, you know, all
[1:36:51] all down through the ages. I've let all
[1:36:53] of this come. I've consummated it.
[1:36:58] and I've gathered my bride finally. You
[1:37:01] understand the rapture will be the first
[1:37:03] time ever that all the bride will be
[1:37:07] gathered in one place.
[1:37:13] We've been separated for 2,000 years. We
[1:37:16] didn't know each other. It'll be the
[1:37:18] first time that we'll be gathered
[1:37:21] again since we all come from the mind of
[1:37:24] God.
[1:37:26] where we were in eternity.
[1:37:35] So now he comes out of the bridal
[1:37:39] chamber and listen to these words. I
[1:37:43] drunk my wine with my milk. Oh friends,
[1:37:48] drink. Yay. Drink abundantly.
[1:37:53] Oh
[1:37:55] beloved, you know
[1:37:57] why? Cuz he found that his friend had
[1:38:02] truly produced
[1:38:05] a virgin bride for
[1:38:08] him. Can't you see why Brother Rand got
[1:38:11] so torn
[1:38:15] up when he saw that
[1:38:18] church? When he saw the original church.
[1:38:21] Oh my, there they were. their long hair
[1:38:23] and all that. And then he sees the the
[1:38:25] last group
[1:38:28] naked
[1:38:31] strips of of pale gray paper
[1:38:34] dancing to rock and roll.
[1:38:39] And he said, I thought, "Oh,
[1:38:41] God, is that all I have been able to
[1:38:45] produce for you? God have mercy on these
[1:38:49] poor people that think they can make it
[1:38:52] without an angel messenger.
[1:38:58] It's no wonder they're naked, right?
[1:39:06] You know what God will do? God will
[1:39:07] throw them in a
[1:39:09] bed in the tribulation period.
[1:39:12] That's what he said in the book of
[1:39:14] Revelation. I'll throw you in a bed of
[1:39:16] worldliness. You're naked and ungodly.
[1:39:20] Why? They laughed at his messenger of
[1:39:22] Malachi for a we don't need no prophet.
[1:39:25] Well, maybe you don't, but we do.
[1:39:28] And I ain't saying that we did. We still
[1:39:30] do. We still need this message, brother
[1:39:33] Lady, to keep us right.
[1:39:38] Praise be to God.
[1:39:40] So the bridegroom comes out and he said,
[1:39:42] "Rejoice, friends.
[1:39:46] Rejoice." The message was a success.
[1:39:51] I started it out with my first angel
[1:39:53] down at the bottom of the pyramid. Come
[1:39:55] on up with seven other church angels.
[1:39:56] And then I sent Elijah in the last day
[1:39:59] to bring the restoration back to the
[1:40:01] first.
[1:40:03] Rejoice. Drink. Let the heavens rejoice
[1:40:06] and be glad. I found my wife to be a
[1:40:11] virgin.
[1:40:13] Oh, that's not what Adam found.
[1:40:18] That's not what God
[1:40:21] found in the Old Testament.
[1:40:25] But that's what he will find in this
[1:40:28] last
[1:40:30] day. It'll be the greatest paradox of
[1:40:33] all the ages. That out of the most
[1:40:36] wicked, look at friend. Look at our
[1:40:37] nation. It's like so many of our
[1:40:40] politicians and our public and the
[1:40:42] people, they're obsessed with sex stuff.
[1:40:46] They're obsessed with transgender. What
[1:40:49] in the world? I'm sure you're hearing
[1:40:50] about all these millions and millions
[1:40:52] and millions of dollars that they're
[1:40:55] uncovering. You imagine a million dollar
[1:40:59] study to study on transgender mice.
[1:41:05] So many millions of dollars in Central
[1:41:08] America spent for transgender operation.
[1:41:11] What in the world is wrong with them?
[1:41:14] They're out of their mind. I said
[1:41:17] they're out of their mind.
[1:41:21] But while they're out of theirs, we got
[1:41:23] ours back.
[1:41:27] Cuz you see, we too were one time naked.
[1:41:30] Yeah, we were miserable, wretched,
[1:41:33] blind, and didn't know where we were
[1:41:36] going.
[1:41:38] But tonight, we stand clothed
[1:41:42] in the
[1:41:43] cloth of the
[1:41:46] word. I love emotions. I love
[1:41:48] sensations. I love all all those things.
[1:41:50] But God never sent his prophet to dress
[1:41:52] us with emotions. And emotions comes
[1:41:55] with it. It's part of it. But if I have
[1:41:57] to trade out part of the word for an
[1:41:58] emotion, I'll I'll let go of the
[1:42:00] emotion.
[1:42:03] Because emotion is not identified. Come
[1:42:05] on, somebody. Oh, yeah. It comes with
[1:42:08] it, but it's not the word. Because
[1:42:09] emotions can be right and they can be
[1:42:11] wrong.
[1:42:13] What about it? Word of
[1:42:16] life. Every day you live, it's getting
[1:42:19] closer and closer and
[1:42:23] closer. Let me close. I read this to you
[1:42:26] last last time. Isaiah
[1:42:30] 62:4, "Thou shalt no better be termed
[1:42:34] forsaken, neither shall thy land anymore
[1:42:37] be termed
[1:42:38] desolate, but thou shalt be called
[1:42:42] Hepsible, which means my delight is in
[1:42:47] her. and thy land bulah which means to
[1:42:52] marry, rule over, possess, own, be lord,
[1:42:57] husband in parenthesis over to be
[1:43:01] married. But you see, the church wants
[1:43:04] to be married to God or oh yeah, they
[1:43:06] want the benefits of marriage, but they
[1:43:08] want what's called in this day an open
[1:43:10] marriage. You've heard of it, an open
[1:43:13] marriage. This man marries this woman
[1:43:15] but he can sleep with whoever he wants
[1:43:17] to and she can too. Open marriage. God
[1:43:20] don't believe in such filths in the home
[1:43:22] or in heaven.
[1:43:25] Amen. That's what the church wants.
[1:43:28] Come on. Only you can tell by their
[1:43:30] young ones. They're not they've not been
[1:43:32] with the make Christ Jesus cuz they're
[1:43:35] not bringing forth them Acts 238
[1:43:37] screaming shouting youngans.
[1:43:39] Well, hallelujah. cuz that's the only
[1:43:41] kind the word can bring forth.
[1:43:46] Isaiah
[1:43:47] 58:11, "And the Lord shall guide thee
[1:43:50] continually, and satisfy thy soul in
[1:43:54] drought, and make fat thy
[1:43:57] bones, and thou shalt be like a watered
[1:44:00] garden." Jeremiah 31:12, therefore shall
[1:44:04] they come and sing in the height of
[1:44:07] Zion. Amen. and shall flow together to
[1:44:11] the goodness of the Lord, for wheat, and
[1:44:13] for wine, and for oil, and for the young
[1:44:14] of the flock, and of the herd. And their
[1:44:17] soul shall be as a watered garden, and
[1:44:21] they shall not
[1:44:22] sorrow anymore at
[1:44:28] all. Don't you see what it's going?
[1:44:31] We're going back
[1:44:33] again at the dawn of that seventh
[1:44:37] morning. When the seventh morning will
[1:44:41] break, the earth will take on its Eden
[1:44:45] conditions again. The sea will be closed
[1:44:48] out at
[1:44:49] nighttime and the bride will enter in in
[1:44:52] the time of darkness. But to us, it's
[1:44:55] not darkness. It's shalom. Good morning.
[1:44:59] Is that right?
[1:45:01] Ezekiel 36:34, "And the desolate land
[1:45:03] shall be till, whereas it lay desolate
[1:45:06] in the sight of all that pass by." That
[1:45:08] was me. That was you. And they shall
[1:45:11] say, "This land was
[1:45:14] desolate. It's
[1:45:16] become like the Garden of
[1:45:19] Eden, and the waste and the desolated
[1:45:22] and ruined cities are become fenced and
[1:45:26] are inhabited."
[1:45:28] Can you imagine what a state this world
[1:45:30] is going to be in when Russia will
[1:45:33] annihilate the United States and all of
[1:45:36] it will end in debris, bodies be burned
[1:45:40] and charred and then atomic explosion.
[1:45:43] Remember, it will be atomic fire that
[1:45:46] ushers in the millennium. Yeah, I've
[1:45:49] thought about Noah and his family so
[1:45:51] many times through the
[1:45:53] years. What a feeling it must have been
[1:45:57] for eight
[1:45:59] people to step out of that boat. Not
[1:46:03] another human being on the
[1:46:06] earth. No neighbors, no friends,
[1:46:12] nobody. He couldn't bring Eden then. But
[1:46:16] when you and I step out in the
[1:46:17] millennium, glory be to
[1:46:20] God, the earth, not in its eighth day
[1:46:23] beauty now, but in that millennium, the
[1:46:27] lion and the lamb will lay down
[1:46:29] together. Praise be to God. Do you
[1:46:33] realize we're coming to the close of
[1:46:35] wintertime and it been beautiful around
[1:46:37] here today? Tomorrow is supposed to be
[1:46:39] like the same day. But you know how
[1:46:41] March is? She's a contankerous old
[1:46:43] thing. She don't like to let go. We may
[1:46:46] have some more snow flying or cold
[1:46:47] weather. Who knows what it's going to
[1:46:49] be? But this is the way I look at it.
[1:46:51] This could be the last winter I'll ever
[1:46:54] see for the rest of my life. God's
[1:46:57] prophet said that winter time is God's
[1:47:00] curse on the earth. And when he brings
[1:47:04] him and his wife back
[1:47:06] together to live, hallelujah, on their
[1:47:10] honeymoon,
[1:47:12] oh, glory to God.
[1:47:18] The temple of Ezekiel 44 through 48 will
[1:47:21] be
[1:47:23] built. He'll stand upon the Mount of
[1:47:26] Olives and it'll cleave in half and the
[1:47:28] water will come out from it and it'll
[1:47:31] start running.
[1:47:33] which is near the garden of
[1:47:35] Gethsemane, and it'll run right down
[1:47:38] southward toward the Dead Sea, and the
[1:47:41] waters out from under his feet will
[1:47:45] cause the Dead Sea to come to
[1:47:49] life. Now, I'm telling you something,
[1:47:50] that Dead Sea is something to look at. I
[1:47:53] mean, there's salt everywhere. We went
[1:47:54] down there years and years ago. You
[1:47:56] don't have to even swim. All you got to
[1:47:58] do is just go out there and lay on that
[1:47:59] water. It's so heavy and got so many
[1:48:01] minerals in it. You could be, you don't
[1:48:02] have to even learn one thing about
[1:48:04] swimming. It'll suspend you there in the
[1:48:06] water. And I just sat out there and
[1:48:07] looked at and I was there. I said, "See,
[1:48:09] I'm telling you, you're fixing to get a
[1:48:11] change. I just want to warn you as a son
[1:48:14] of God. Happy day. Happy day." You know
[1:48:17] why I could say that? Cuz I one time was
[1:48:19] like that old Dead Sea out in the
[1:48:21] mountain. I said, "Come on, somebody.
[1:48:24] You were like that old desolate land,
[1:48:26] that old dry desolate land. I like the
[1:48:29] dead sea, but the water came out from
[1:48:31] the Son of God and shined upon our lives
[1:48:34] and watered us.
[1:48:37] And we are now his garden.
[1:48:43] Eat of your pleasant fruits, my Lord.
[1:48:49] Take of your wine, your
[1:48:51] pomegranates, your
[1:48:56] mandrekes. Let me close.
[1:48:59] St. John 18:1. And this is what makes it
[1:49:02] all
[1:49:03] possible. When Jesus had spoken these
[1:49:06] words, he went forth with his disciples
[1:49:08] over the brook Cedron.
[1:49:12] Where
[1:49:13] was a
[1:49:15] garden into which he
[1:49:18] entered and his
[1:49:21] disciples, the one we know about
[1:49:24] Gethsemane,
[1:49:27] Gimmoni, the place of the olive
[1:49:30] press. Still trees in that garden now
[1:49:34] that they say possibly could date back
[1:49:36] to the Lord
[1:49:38] Jesus. that
[1:49:40] old. It was lost in a
[1:49:43] garden and
[1:49:45] regained in a
[1:49:47] garden. Understand St. John
[1:49:51] 19 41.
[1:49:55] Now in the
[1:49:59] place where he was
[1:50:02] crucified, there was a
[1:50:06] garden. And in the garden a new
[1:50:11] separate wherein was never
[1:50:14] man yet laid.
[1:50:19] So, our Lord
[1:50:20] Jesus
[1:50:22] raised from the
[1:50:24] dead in a garden
[1:50:28] tomb. To me, it's so
[1:50:30] fitting that he would raise that seed
[1:50:34] which he placed in me of
[1:50:37] predestination also from a
[1:50:41] garden
[1:50:43] tomb. You see, I am a garden. You are a
[1:50:48] garden. I look like the dead sea,
[1:50:51] lifeless. A land was
[1:50:54] barren. No
[1:50:56] fruits. But he raised
[1:50:59] himself. Hallelujah. Destroy this
[1:51:02] temple. And in three days, I'll raise it
[1:51:05] again. And he raised me from a garden
[1:51:09] tomb. And then turned right around and
[1:51:11] said, "Now what I want to do is I want
[1:51:13] you and I to become one." And from that
[1:51:17] tomb will come forth my new life or my
[1:51:22] new
[1:51:27] message. So when they carried theelves
[1:51:30] up into the upper room and there was 120
[1:51:34] garden
[1:51:35] tombs dead,
[1:51:37] lifeless and there came a sound as of a
[1:51:40] rushing mighty wind and it filled all
[1:51:42] the house where they were
[1:51:43] sitting. and 120 resurrections took
[1:51:47] place and God started the Garden of
[1:51:50] Eden. One more
[1:51:55] time. Now, the second Adam had an Eve
[1:52:00] that could not
[1:52:03] perish. He is the second Adam. We are
[1:52:07] the second Eve. And let us put hail on
[1:52:11] notice tonight.
[1:52:14] She will not fail.
[1:52:17] She cannot fail.
[1:52:21] It's astounding. The prophet tells us
[1:52:23] 1965, he said, "The whole reason this
[1:52:26] whole evil age, the whole reason of this
[1:52:28] evil age is to prove to
[1:52:32] Satan she's not the type of woman that
[1:52:37] Eve was."
[1:52:41] Wow.
[1:52:43] Boy, he had a lot of confidence in me.
[1:52:45] He ain't got none in you. He ain't got
[1:52:48] none in me. He has confidence in his
[1:52:51] word. And if me and his word are one,
[1:52:54] then yes, he has confidence in that. He
[1:52:56] ain't got no confidence in our flesh.
[1:53:00] Think of
[1:53:01] it. Don't you love him?
[1:53:21] Thank you,
[1:53:22] Lord. Let's pray
[1:53:32] together. Oh, sweet Jesus.
[1:53:38] Come tonight,
[1:53:39] Lord.
[1:53:45] Come. Take the garden of our hearts into
[1:53:48] your lives,
[1:53:52] Lord. Lord, may may Song of Solomon
[1:53:56] chapter 5 verse
[1:53:58] one be fulfilled in every heart of every
[1:54:01] believer right here
[1:54:03] tonight. Lord God, that their heart can
[1:54:06] be a a garden sealed
[1:54:10] enclosed. Lord, I know the world looks
[1:54:12] at it and says, "Oh, them poor women,
[1:54:14] they they can't do this. And them poor
[1:54:16] young people, we feel so sorrowful and
[1:54:18] they can't do this. They can't do that.
[1:54:19] They can't go here. They can't go there.
[1:54:21] They're behind prison
[1:54:23] walls. It ain't prison walls to us. It's
[1:54:27] a garden wall.
[1:54:29] It keeps the jackals out and the foxes
[1:54:33] and all the rest of the varmints out
[1:54:35] there in the world to protect his little
[1:54:38] special tropical
[1:54:41] plants. Oh,
[1:54:44] hallelujah. We worship you tonight, Lord
[1:54:48] God. I want to thank you for giving me
[1:54:50] enough voice to speak this tonight.
[1:54:53] Father,
[1:54:57] I feel like we moved into a little
[1:54:58] heavenly realm for a bit,
[1:55:02] thank you for opening up our future for
[1:55:06] us, letting us see just a little bit
[1:55:09] what lays ahead for
[1:55:11] us. Oh Jesus, we love you, Lord.
[1:55:17] We're longing for that day when the
[1:55:21] shout, the
[1:55:22] voice, and the trumpet. A shout, a
[1:55:27] message to get the bride
[1:55:29] together. Then the voice, the voice of
[1:55:33] the
[1:55:34] archangel, and then the trump of God
[1:55:36] will
[1:55:38] sound will all be gathered together. And
[1:55:41] he says in going beyond the camp, think
[1:55:43] of
[1:55:44] it missing
[1:55:47] people. They can't find you no more, but
[1:55:51] you're getting
[1:55:52] together with the rest of the group.
[1:55:57] And come up missing together on the
[1:56:00] earth. Amen.
[1:56:02] Brother Daryl may be out in a meeting
[1:56:04] somewhere.
[1:56:05] He might have drove most of the night,
[1:56:07] maybe on Sunday night coming back
[1:56:10] home. Don't want to wake Cheryl and
[1:56:12] Jessica up, so he just lay on the couch
[1:56:14] a little
[1:56:15] bit. Gets up about 7 or so in the
[1:56:17] morning, goes into the bathroom,
[1:56:20] standing there combing his hair,
[1:56:21] brushing his
[1:56:22] teeth, in the bathroom, walks his mama
[1:56:25] and his daddy, his sister, loved ones go
[1:56:28] to
[1:56:29] appearing. while it's happening out
[1:56:32] there at
[1:56:33] Gray. Glory to God. Down Elizabeth and
[1:56:35] I'll be running up and down the road
[1:56:37] shouting and screaming cuz Lance has
[1:56:40] already tore the house down there over
[1:56:41] the hill. Them four Parker girls
[1:56:44] shouting their hair. Glory to God. I'll
[1:56:47] see that little young
[1:56:51] mine. I'll see Brother Calvin Ward. I'll
[1:56:54] see Brother Daniel
[1:56:57] Nunley, Brother David.
[1:57:00] on and on and on,
[1:57:03] Lord. Get together with the rest of the
[1:57:07] group.
[1:57:12] Hallelujah. We'll gather together under
[1:57:14] the church age messenger and he will
[1:57:18] present
[1:57:19] us. Hallelujah. Not some eighth day
[1:57:22] messenger. Not some preacher that thinks
[1:57:24] he knows it all. Try to sidestep the
[1:57:27] prophet.
[1:57:29] ain't going to be me, some other man
[1:57:30] that's going to present the bride. It's
[1:57:33] going to be that friend of the
[1:57:34] bridegroom,
[1:57:38] but we want to stand there,
[1:57:40] Lord. Our little church along with these
[1:57:42] other churches, little battalions of the
[1:57:44] army of
[1:57:45] God. We walk up there behind that
[1:57:48] messenger. We won't be ashamed of what
[1:57:50] he said. We won't nitpick it. Well, I
[1:57:52] don't like this and that was only a
[1:57:53] brand tabernacle and we don't need this
[1:57:55] in this day. No, that ain't the way
[1:57:57] we're going with it. What if that's a
[1:57:59] sleeve? What if that's a button? What if
[1:58:01] that's a hem? What if that's a cuff or a
[1:58:03] collar that goes on the dress? And I
[1:58:05] don't like that collar. I don't like
[1:58:06] that cuff. If he put a cuff on it, I
[1:58:09] want a cuff. If he put a collar on it, I
[1:58:11] want a collar. Lord God, we don't want
[1:58:14] some manufactured something another of
[1:58:16] our own ideas.
[1:58:18] Oh Jesus, we worship you tonight. Lord,
[1:58:24] we praise you tonight. Father,
[1:58:27] can we just take a few
[1:58:29] minutes? Oh, don't you love him,
[1:58:32] children? Don't you just just love him
[1:58:34] so much? You You want to be part of that
[1:58:36] day? Yes.
[1:58:40] Remember, Adam's bride couldn't
[1:58:43] wait. Jehovah's bride couldn't wait. Do
[1:58:46] you understand that same temptation is
[1:58:48] going to face the bride in this last day
[1:58:50] not to wait for the real thing? Satan
[1:58:55] has played so many tricks on us in the
[1:58:57] ranks of this message to try to forrun
[1:59:00] that latter. This is it. This is it.
[1:59:02] This is a bride
[1:59:03] revival. Every one of us fallen
[1:59:06] short and produced a bunch of bastard
[1:59:09] born
[1:59:10] children. But God's going to have a
[1:59:12] bride that's going to wait.
[1:59:15] Hallelujah.
[1:59:18] Hallelujah. We worship you,
[1:59:21] Jesus. Blow across our garden tonight.
[1:59:26] Father, oh Lord God, I pray in the name
[1:59:29] of Jesus.
[1:59:32] take our our herbs, our spices, our
[1:59:37] fruits, the pleasantries of our life
[1:59:41] which have been created by
[1:59:43] you. Anything good that I could ever do,
[1:59:47] it would have to come from you cuz
[1:59:48] there's no good in me. There's no good
[1:59:50] in any of us. If we ever accomplish one
[1:59:54] thing for the glory of God, it'll be
[1:59:56] your work. All I got to do is get ready.
[1:59:59] just got to get get dressed and and get
[2:00:01] ready and just be there waiting. You've
[2:00:03] done got the banquet
[2:00:05] prepared. Praise
[2:00:07] God. Thank you, Lord Jesus. As I set it
[2:00:11] up in Arkansas, maybe that table 1500
[2:00:14] miles long and the very last two seats
[2:00:17] on the left or right hand side, I don't
[2:00:19] even care what side, but the very last
[2:00:22] two seats at the
[2:00:24] table. What's that? Me and
[2:00:27] Carol. and Carol will be next to last
[2:00:29] and I'll be
[2:00:30] last. And I'm not sure how long it'll
[2:00:34] take, but you start to break that head
[2:00:36] by all them important
[2:00:38] people. You go to wiping their tears
[2:00:40] from their
[2:00:41] eyes. But I'll get my
[2:00:45] turn. Oh Lord
[2:00:47] God, I can't wait for that
[2:00:50] time when I raise my head and I look up
[2:00:54] at you. My little queen sitting by my
[2:00:56] side, tears trickling out of my
[2:00:59] eyes. And you look down at
[2:01:01] me. Don't cry no
[2:01:04] more. It's all over
[2:01:07] now. Enter into the joys of the
[2:01:10] Lord. I prepared them for you too before
[2:01:14] the world began. Remember the night when
[2:01:18] you got married that day and I spoke to
[2:01:21] you and said, "I ordained you to be
[2:01:25] together before the foundation of the
[2:01:28] world."
[2:01:31] Hallelujah. We worship you,
[2:01:34] Jesus. We worship you, Jesus.
[2:01:39] Hey, whatever's on your
[2:01:46] heart, when it's my
[2:01:50] time, I'm going to take my
[2:01:54] time to
[2:01:56] behold his face.
[2:02:01] our God. When it's my
[2:02:05] time, I'm going to take my time. Thank
[2:02:09] you, Jesus. To talk of his amazing
[2:02:14] amazing grace.
[2:02:16] I'm going to thank him. Can we just love
[2:02:19] him a little now before we go? That he
[2:02:23] brought and I believe in thee alone.
[2:02:31] When it's my
[2:02:34] turn, going to take my
[2:02:37] time at his soul.
[2:02:42] Yes,
[2:02:43] Lord. Oh, it's mine. Oh, yes. Think of
[2:02:48] the children. Each one of you is going
[2:02:50] to get your time. Won't it be something
[2:02:52] to behold? To behold his
[2:02:56] face. Hallelujah, Lord.
[2:03:02] I'm going to take my
[2:03:05] time to talk of his
[2:03:09] amazing grace.
[2:03:12] I'm going to thank him
[2:03:15] for that heavy
[2:03:21] loyalty
[2:03:22] me
[2:03:25] alone. When it's my
[2:03:29] time, I'm going to take my
[2:03:37] time. Lord
[2:03:40] Jesus worship him
[2:03:43] upon millions. Think about it. Millions
[2:03:47] upon millions since you see him standing
[2:03:50] in line.
[2:03:53] [Music]
[2:03:54] Just waiting for waiting for one moment,
[2:03:58] a moment more of the
[2:04:04] precious time.
[2:04:07] When I finally reach all glory, his
[2:04:12] presence, I'll take a thousand years,
[2:04:18] maybe
[2:04:20] two, just to thank him, just to thank
[2:04:23] him for his wonderful
[2:04:27] love and the grace that he brought
[2:04:33] over. Oh, it is my time. Thank you,
[2:04:37] Jesus. I'm going to take my time. Oh,
[2:04:40] let's loving saints. Let's just worship
[2:04:42] him together. I'm going to let you go
[2:04:44] shortly. Let's just love him while we
[2:04:46] have this opportunity.
[2:04:49] This might be somebody's last time to
[2:04:51] ever praise him. My
[2:04:53] time to talk to his amazing.
[2:05:01] Thank him
[2:05:03] for the love that
[2:05:06] he and I leave me
[2:05:13] alone. When it's my time, I'm going to
[2:05:18] take my
[2:05:20] time at his
[2:05:25] throne.
[2:05:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:31] Jesus, come away, my
[2:05:34] love. Come away, my fair one. Lo, the
[2:05:38] winter is

[2:05:50] liies and the turtle, which is actually

[2:06:22] Lord God, as long as I'm in my right
[2:06:25] mind, as long as I can preach, as long
[2:06:27] as I can study, help me that I'll always
[2:06:30] be
[2:06:32] true. Try to bring that word, Lord, in
[2:06:36] its pure form.
[2:06:39] I'm not called like the prophet was to
[2:06:41] do his position. But if I can just urge
[2:06:43] her along to keep the same clothes on,
[2:06:48] keep them
[2:06:49] clean, keep them
[2:06:53] spotless. Praise the Lord. I I'm not
[2:06:56] your friend the way he was, but I'll
[2:06:58] stand there and be identified that
[2:07:02] day. Thank you,
[2:07:05] Jesus. Singing for us. Harry, come

[2:07:23] for a celebration. There
[2:07:27] the bride is almost
[2:07:30] ready and spotless wide
[2:07:34] array. A husk falls over
[2:07:38] heaven as the groom begins to say,
[2:07:44] "Oh, come

[2:10:52] masterpiece tonight? Amen.
[2:10:55] [Applause]
[2:10:58] [Music]
[2:11:01] [Applause]
[2:11:04] We were there. It was so real. It was so
[2:11:08] real. You know, last April when I was in
[2:11:11] Arkansas for a total eclipse of the
[2:11:18] sun. And when I watched the moon and the
[2:11:22] sun unite as one, it just dawned on me
[2:11:25] that takes place when there's darkness
[2:11:28] on the earth.
[2:11:30] And in the darkness of
[2:11:33] Leodysa, we become one with with
[2:11:36] him. It's on us, friends. It's on
[2:11:41] us. We're not arriving. We've
[2:11:46] arrived. I'm so grateful that the Lord
[2:11:50] has made these things known to us.
[2:11:53] I was just an empty
[2:11:55] tomb, an empty
[2:11:58] face. But he found me. He found you.
[2:12:03] Aren't you grateful for that? Amen.
[2:12:06] Oh my. Didn't you enjoy the word
[2:12:09] tonight?
[2:12:11] Let's just bow our heads.
[2:12:16] [Laughter]
[2:12:18] Lord
[2:12:20] Jesus, I am so thankful in my heart,
[2:12:23] Lord, that you have made these these
[2:12:26] things known to us.
[2:12:29] Lord, the
[2:12:31] secrets, the once great mystery, secrets
[2:12:33] that was in your mind has now been
[2:12:36] placed in the hearts of the
[2:12:38] believers. We're unveiling that mystery,
[2:12:42] manifesting that thought. Lord, we are
[2:12:44] so grateful. And I pray, dear God, that
[2:12:46] we take these things with us tonight.
[2:12:48] Lord, may we lay aside every weight,
[2:12:51] Lord, every feather, everything, dear
[2:12:53] God, that would hinder us from obtaining
[2:12:55] that which we've heard tonight. Lord, I
[2:12:58] pray that you'd bless my precious
[2:13:00] brother Donnie, Lord, that you'd just re
[2:13:02] renew his strength, dear God. Take the
[2:13:05] weakness, the cough away from him. We
[2:13:07] pray, Lord, bring him back like Aurora
[2:13:09] lion on Sunday, Lord, to bring the word
[2:13:11] again. We pray go with your children,
[2:13:14] Father. watch over them as they make
[2:13:15] their way home tonight. And Father, we
[2:13:18] lay up on our beds. May we may we
[2:13:21] regurgitate these things we've heard
[2:13:22] tonight, Lord. And may it feed our
[2:13:24] souls. We pray. And Father, you see the
[2:13:27] needs of your people. And I ask you,
[2:13:30] Lord, may your spirit just move upon
[2:13:32] each heart, each family, Lord, that's
[2:13:33] struggling with with diseases, Lord, and
[2:13:36] viruses and whatever it would be, oh
[2:13:39] God. But you said in your word, I will
[2:13:42] restore, sayeth the Lord.
[2:13:44] I am the Lord thy God that health thee.
[2:13:47] Lord, I believe it with all of our
[2:13:48] hearts. We commit these things into your
[2:13:51] hands for your glory. Thank you, Father,
[2:13:54] for the
[2:13:55] privilege of coming to your house and
[2:13:58] sitting at your
[2:13:59] table and
[2:14:02] feasting upon thy
[2:14:04] word. Thank you, Lord Jesus, tonight. Go
[2:14:07] with your people. We pray now in Jesus
[2:14:09] name.
[2:14:11] Amen. Amen.
[2:14:14] Sing us something back.
[2:14:16] Come
[2:14:19] away. God bless you saints who dismiss
[2:14:21] the fear of the Lord. I'm sure love and
[2:14:23] appreciate you. Come
