[14:51] able to be here in the house of the Lord
[14:54] um let me read one question and then um
[14:58] um read a scripture and then we'll we'll
[15:01] pray I know that God can hear our
[15:05] thoughts and I've been wondering if he
[15:08] hears all our
[15:10] thoughts if we are held
[15:13] accountable for any bad
[15:17] thoughts well let me say I hope
[15:22] not amen anybody else hope
[15:26] not 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse
[15:29] 5 casting down
[15:32] imaginations and every High thing that
[15:35] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[15:38] God and bringing into captivity every
[15:42] thought to The Obedience of Christ let's
[15:46] just pray together if you would
[15:48] now father we thank you for this time
[15:52] that we can be together and Lord we're
[15:54] grateful that young people have a desire
[15:57] to serve you
[15:59] to give you their youth father how
[16:03] grateful we are that they want to know
[16:06] they want to understand your way and
[16:09] they want to be better Christians or
[16:11] consecrated to you their lives filled
[16:14] with your presence so Lord I can tell
[16:17] from these questions that I got they
[16:20] have things misund understandings
[16:24] misgivings just things that Satan tries
[16:26] to put them through and they want to
[16:28] know what's right I pray tonight that
[16:31] you would help me Lord to be able to get
[16:33] out of the way and answer these as best
[16:36] as I can speak to us would you father in
[16:40] the name of the Lord Jesus we ask amen
[16:44] God bless you you can be
[16:48] seated this of course is not just a
[16:50] question for the
[16:52] Youth we know that God certainly knows
[16:54] all of our thoughts and he can hear our
[16:57] thoughts whoever it was that asked this
[16:59] question then we would think well if God
[17:01] does know all of our thoughts then
[17:04] there's many thoughts that goes through
[17:05] our mind that certainly are not pleasing
[17:08] to him and not his thoughts then are we
[17:12] held accountable for those thoughts
[17:16] anybody here today be honest and say
[17:18] there's been thoughts that's went
[17:19] through your mind today that you didn't
[17:21] like and you wouldn't you hope that God
[17:23] don't hold you responsible now you
[17:25] wonder how that can be how can a person
[17:28] who loves the Lord Jesus and is serving
[17:31] him with all of their hearts how can
[17:33] thoughts go through our minds that are
[17:36] not pleasing to the Lord and we know
[17:38] once we become converted and become
[17:40] children of God then our nature changes
[17:43] and the inside of us becomes the throne
[17:46] room of the presence of God but our
[17:49] human element is still not saved still
[17:52] doesn't have the Holy Ghost my brain
[17:54] don't have the Holy Ghost Welly I wish
[17:56] it did don't you don't you wish your
[17:57] brain had the the Holy Ghost and your
[17:59] flesh had the Holy Ghost and everything
[18:01] about you but it doesn't but what has
[18:03] the Holy Ghost is your soul from within
[18:05] you that's the control tower that's your
[18:08] throne room so in other words what God
[18:10] did was God ousted that evil nature that
[18:13] you had and the King that lived in your
[18:15] soul was the devil and God liberated you
[18:19] from that but you're still in this
[18:21] cuckle bur outside so thoughts that go
[18:25] through our mind can be either good or
[18:27] evil and we know that the Battleground
[18:30] is not the soul once you're converted
[18:33] your Battleground is no longer in your
[18:36] soul God and Satan do not inhabit your
[18:39] soul at the same time but God and Satan
[18:43] will both fight right here a
[18:45] Battleground for those of you that's
[18:47] different visited different
[18:48] Battlegrounds whether it's a civil war
[18:50] or Revolutionary War or whatever it
[18:52] would have been and they might still
[18:54] have remnants of cannons and and holes
[18:56] in the ground and all types types of
[18:58] things that they found and that was
[19:01] traces of both armies being there and
[19:04] it's the same way with our mind both God
[19:07] and the devil has access to this up here
[19:10] so what do both of them do God will fire
[19:12] his word God will anoint his men and
[19:15] they will preach and bring scriptures
[19:17] and quotes and and so on and they are
[19:19] firing at the enemy but if it's a real
[19:22] Battleground then the enemy also has the
[19:25] right to fire so what will he fire he
[19:28] will he will fire fear doubt unbelief
[19:31] anxiety whatever he can do to try to
[19:34] come against us and remember brother B
[19:36] told us that Satan's only weapon is to
[19:39] get you to deny yours or doubt yours
[19:43] that's his only weapon but if he can
[19:45] convince us he's got all this great
[19:47] power boy he could just do anything he
[19:50] wants to do don't you believe that for
[19:52] nothing he cannot he cannot even make us
[19:56] do wrong we have to be willing to to do
[19:58] that but in our minds because our minds
[20:02] are successible just like your dreams
[20:04] anybody ever had dreams and it was
[20:06] horrible dreams you know whether they
[20:07] was uh unclean dreams or just scary
[20:10] types of Dreams our subconscious Satan
[20:13] also has access still to that because
[20:15] it's not yet been fully redeemed and in
[20:18] every aspect that he can so when brother
[20:21] BR preaches to us a greatest battle ever
[20:22] fought he laid out 10 gates for us to be
[20:25] able to see see taste feel here
[20:28] imagination conscience memory reason and
[20:31] affection so that's 10 Gates that Satan
[20:34] has access to try to get to every one of
[20:37] us in the soul there's only one there's
[20:40] only one gate and that's your choice so
[20:43] he will try from the 10 out here from
[20:46] getting our attention if it would be
[20:48] through sight or through hearing and
[20:50] then maybe imagination or conscience or
[20:53] the memory of something that you did or
[20:55] the memory of a pleasure of a sin that
[20:58] you once did and he would try to gain
[21:00] access to that all 10 of those are
[21:03] aiming toward the one gate which is in
[21:06] the soul which is your choice then you
[21:08] choose do I want to go that way or do I
[21:11] want to go that way I will oby what the
[21:15] king says on the throne of my heart
[21:17] Carolyn I spoke to a a sister after
[21:19] service last night and I told her I said
[21:21] I've got the question tomorrow night
[21:23] along these same lines that she actually
[21:25] had a council session for and I told her
[21:27] that the ible says let not therefore sin
[21:30] reain in your mortal body and the word
[21:33] Reign is a Greek word which is basilios
[21:36] and it actually means to be king in your
[21:39] body but when Peter wrote that he
[21:42] separated your flesh from your soul and
[21:45] he's talking to two people I if you've
[21:47] ever noticed it or not but he said let
[21:49] not sin therefore rain in your mortal
[21:53] body so he's separating The Immortal
[21:56] from the Mortal and telling you and I
[21:58] that we have the ability by the new
[22:00] births to tell the devil you're not
[22:03] rainning in my body you're not reigning
[22:05] you may bother me and you may tempt me
[22:08] and we know that he will but he does not
[22:10] have the ability to be king unless we
[22:14] crown him King now it can be so when it
[22:17] comes to sickness or disease or
[22:19] Temptation or just even uh feeling like
[22:22] you're not a part of of the church
[22:25] feeling your young people and say you
[22:27] don't feel like you're part of certain
[22:29] clicks and whatever that would be in the
[22:31] young people like there are't old people
[22:33] and you think well I really don't belong
[22:35] and nobody likes me and nobody really
[22:37] speaks to me and you know all that sort
[22:39] of thing we all feel that way and and we
[22:42] can go through those things and in our
[22:44] mind those thoughts come there well
[22:46] you're not really needed you're not
[22:48] accepted you don't make enough money or
[22:50] whatever more and and Satan knows
[22:52] exactly how to attack us in our mind and
[22:55] I want you to notice this that brother
[22:57] Bram said don't never let your testimony
[22:59] be negative let it be positive all the
[23:02] time I'm saved I have God in my heart I
[23:06] believe him with all of my heart do you
[23:09] believe in Divine Healing with all my
[23:12] heart let your testimony always and your
[23:14] thoughts everything never permit a
[23:17] negative thought to come in your mind if
[23:20] you can help it but now let's not stop
[23:22] there let's continue on to read when it
[23:25] starts that don't entertain it well you
[23:28] say I can't keep thoughts from coming
[23:31] well be like the farmer that said he
[23:34] couldn't stop the third the birds from
[23:36] flying over his place but he sure could
[23:38] stop him from roosting so every one of
[23:42] us Satan has access into our mind and he
[23:45] will put all types of thoughts there
[23:47] thoughts that's against God any y'all
[23:49] ever even had thoughts come in your mind
[23:51] I'm not sure there is a God I don't know
[23:53] if there is a God any of y'all ever went
[23:55] through that I have and I'm a preacher
[23:58] so I guarantee you that Satan does that
[24:01] but I know exactly where that's coming
[24:03] from God's not going to hold me
[24:04] responsible for that thought because he
[24:07] knows my heart he knows that's not who I
[24:10] am so if you're like me and I'm sure you
[24:12] are if you're born again then when a
[24:14] thought goes through your mind that so
[24:16] troubles you and bothers you and the
[24:18] Lord knows in your heart you was not the
[24:21] one who's even the author of that
[24:23] thought you've heard me say it before
[24:24] that Satan is the type of being that
[24:26] he'll talk you into Rob in the bank and
[24:28] call the cops on you well you so got the
[24:30] gun in your hand well that's the way he
[24:32] does with thoughts he will put thoughts
[24:34] in our mind turn right back around and
[24:37] say now ain't you ashamed of yourself
[24:39] you claim you're a Christian how could
[24:42] you be a Christian and let that thought
[24:44] be in your mind you know what he's
[24:46] trying to do he's trying to condemn you
[24:49] for something that he did himself so you
[24:52] need to just put him right in his place
[24:54] and say Satan you're a liar that's not
[24:56] what I want that's not who I am that
[24:59] come from you I will not be held
[25:01] accountable for that leave me get out of
[25:04] my mind and leave me alone you know when
[25:07] the when the devil came to the Lord
[25:08] Jesus and the scripture says that that
[25:12] Satan left him for a season you imagine
[25:15] the Son of God and the angels then came
[25:18] and ministered to him so the devil quit
[25:21] tormenting the Lord Jesus for amount of
[25:24] time who knows how long it was but it
[25:26] wasn't that even Jesus Jesus being the
[25:28] Son of God that he was free from Satan's
[25:31] thoughts and his battles and his trials
[25:34] but he knew how to meet the devil so a
[25:37] lot of the things when Satan come
[25:39] against him if you're the Son of God do
[25:40] this do that Jesus never even address
[25:44] that question and where we waste our
[25:46] time is trying to argue with the devil
[25:49] and try to convince him we're saved and
[25:51] when we can spend all day doing that and
[25:53] he'll come back tomorrow with the same
[25:55] old nonsense as that while you're not
[25:57] saved quit wasting your time trying to
[25:59] convince the devil you're saved just
[26:01] know you are and know that he's a
[26:02] defeated
[26:04] foe notice he said you can be like the
[26:07] farmer you can't stop the birds from
[26:08] flying over but he sure could stop them
[26:11] from roosting so that's a good thing you
[26:13] can't help the thoughts when they come
[26:16] but don't entertain them now that's the
[26:19] part that you and I will make mistakes
[26:22] on that we will entertain thoughts God
[26:25] so developed us when he created man and
[26:27] the Garden of Eden that he has a first
[26:29] conscience a subconscious a psyche he
[26:32] has things about him that are committed
[26:35] to the subconscious your blood pressure
[26:37] your heart rate U walking down steps we
[26:40] walk down them steps and we get used to
[26:42] it over and over again we don't have to
[26:44] even look at the steps we don't even
[26:45] count the steps no doubt you've done it
[26:48] before to where you go to looking at
[26:49] them and you'll stumble a little bit why
[26:52] you took it from the subconscious and
[26:54] started applying it to your first
[26:56] conscience and it enter reacted and it
[26:58] crossed the wavelength or the signal
[27:00] going to the muscles and your legs and
[27:02] you almost fell flat of your face why
[27:05] you was pulling it from the wrong Source
[27:07] but how many times have you went up and
[27:09] down them same steps and you don't even
[27:11] think about it aren't you glad you're
[27:12] breathing is committed to your
[27:15] subconscious You' never sleep if it
[27:17] wasn't if your heart rate was not
[27:19] committed to that when you enter into
[27:21] the deep cycles of sleep and your heart
[27:23] rate lowers your blood pressure lowers
[27:25] all that where's all that coming from
[27:27] you and I are out as cold as we can be
[27:29] sleeping like a log as we would say but
[27:32] God committed so much of that to the
[27:34] subconscious what it's the same way with
[27:36] our faith when we try so hard to have
[27:39] faith we're pulling it from our
[27:42] subconscious that's where brother B
[27:43] talks about Jesus he said that Jesus
[27:45] never stepped to the bow of the ship and
[27:47] said now let me see if I've got enough
[27:49] Faith to speak to the storm it was in
[27:52] his subconscious he didn't try to make
[27:54] it happen he knew who he was and he beli
[27:57] believed who he was and whenever we
[27:59] actually weaken ourselves whenever we
[28:02] try to pull our faith walk from the
[28:04] subconscious part and they say I'm going
[28:06] to do this I I've got this God I'm going
[28:08] to do this that other no we'll mess up
[28:10] sure as we do it but whenever it comes
[28:13] to this part notice he said God can only
[28:15] bless you as you confess that he's done
[28:19] it for you I said that we have to keep
[28:21] saying this he's our high priest of our
[28:24] confession Hebrews 3 he said he's the
[28:26] high priest of our conf and he can only
[28:28] do for us as we accept it believe it and
[28:33] confess it now look at those words
[28:36] accept a believe B confess C that's all
[28:42] the ABCs you'll need to know to be able
[28:45] to overcome the devil then when that
[28:48] enemy comes against you you stand right
[28:50] there on the promise of the word Now
[28:52] watch how you bring it over into Divine
[28:54] Healing don't think sitting there in the
[28:56] wheelchair shair that you're hopeless
[28:59] and helpless you're not don't let that
[29:03] negative thought ever pass through now I
[29:07] wonder how we would have thought about
[29:09] that if we were sitting in a wheelchair
[29:10] now he didn't say what was wrong with
[29:12] the individual if it was paralysis if
[29:14] they were crippled if they were weak he
[29:16] didn't really say but if it was someone
[29:19] that had a polio or paralysis in their
[29:21] body and they knew they knew what the
[29:24] doctor said there's absolutely no hope
[29:26] for you how how are you going to keep a
[29:28] negative thought out of your mind when
[29:31] maybe your legs are totally numb your
[29:34] feet are numb you have absolutely no
[29:36] feeling at all and yet he told this
[29:39] person man or woman whoever it was don't
[29:42] let that negative Sal ever pass through
[29:44] don't let it anchor you can't help it
[29:48] from going through your mind but don't
[29:53] let it
[29:54] stop now Satan knows his right
[29:57] he knows exactly what he can do he knows
[30:00] what he has power as being a fallen
[30:03] angel he has an element of authority and
[30:06] he El has an element of jurisdiction
[30:09] every demon in hell was once an angel of
[30:13] God and when they fell they kept the
[30:17] power that they were given by God in the
[30:20] category they were made in and they know
[30:23] exactly what they can do they also know
[30:25] their limitations but they know if they
[30:28] can talk us out of who we are what
[30:31] little bit of power they have left will
[30:34] overcome us if they can get us to doubt
[30:37] our weapon so this is why it constantly
[30:40] will come in the battle of the mind I've
[30:43] stood in different cities of the world
[30:46] Carol a few years ago was over in
[30:48] Switzerland and we was able to go to a
[30:50] uh some castles that were there in
[30:52] France and the southern part of France
[30:54] and and um really beautiful place I love
[30:58] those ancient buildings like that and
[31:00] you see that they might have walls that
[31:02] would be 2 feet thick some of them would
[31:05] be 3T some of just unbelievable but
[31:08] every one of those castles had a
[31:10] vulnerability and in the towers that
[31:12] they would have on the outside wall and
[31:15] they would have a slit maybe laid in the
[31:17] masoner and it would be 6 to8 feet tall
[31:20] and about that wide would be as big as
[31:22] it was well actually there was a
[31:23] restaurant there and we had lunch one
[31:25] day and it was it was an ancient castle
[31:28] and yet this is where the men would
[31:30] stand and they would shoot their ARS out
[31:33] that narrow place but every one of them
[31:35] had a vulnerable position and that
[31:38] vulnerability was the gate so why try to
[31:41] go through a wall that is two foot thick
[31:44] whenever you have a wooden gate so they
[31:47] would study and many of them they would
[31:49] build them up on a high heill and they
[31:51] would build a rampart up and that'd make
[31:53] it real narrow when they'd come through
[31:54] the gate so you wouldn't be able to get
[31:56] a chair charot and horses or um
[31:59] something wide because the gate was the
[32:02] most vulnerable part that's where we are
[32:04] the most vulnerable and our walk with
[32:06] God see taste feel smell hear love
[32:10] imagination conscience memory reason and
[32:12] affection our a vulnerability now then
[32:15] if they would break through the gate
[32:18] then they would have things inside the
[32:20] gates uh we were there in Jerusalem a
[32:22] few years ago and you look up like this
[32:25] and what you see is a Place cut out in
[32:28] this Stone it's made to where they can
[32:31] pour hot boiling
[32:34] oil and water down on the people who did
[32:39] make it through the gates so they tried
[32:41] to make the gate as strong as possible
[32:44] but they knew if they did this and this
[32:46] and this the enemy would study it and
[32:49] the enemy would do this and this and
[32:51] this and this and then override what
[32:55] they did so they would have one
[32:57] precaution and then another precaution
[32:59] so if they made it through the gate
[33:01] itself then they would have another part
[33:04] there and they'd pour boiling water and
[33:06] they'd pour oil on top of them they
[33:08] would have rocks they did everything
[33:10] that they could because their
[33:12] vulnerability laid in the gates and this
[33:15] is where arrows are I I love this
[33:17] question because somebody asked brother
[33:19] brenaman this in
[33:20] 1964 brother Ram please explain how a
[33:23] person knows if he's thinking his own
[33:27] thoughts or if the devil is placing
[33:30] thoughts in his mind to make him think
[33:35] wrong now actually this person answered
[33:38] their own question
[33:41] especially if you know you do not want
[33:44] to think them they answered their own
[33:47] question but I'm glad the prophet didn't
[33:50] just say that and stop but he wanted to
[33:52] take this question now it's a very good
[33:55] question worded very very good well then
[33:59] you know he said if it's contrary to the
[34:00] word it's the devil's thinking if it's
[34:03] with the word it's God's thinking if
[34:06] it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil
[34:09] now I want you to notice though how he's
[34:10] answering this he's answering this not
[34:14] only on the question but he's answering
[34:17] this on the last statement that the
[34:20] individual said the individual said
[34:22] especially when you know it's not what
[34:25] you want so he didn't answer answer this
[34:27] question just across the board with
[34:29] every evil thought and all that he
[34:31] answers the question from a sincere
[34:34] heart of a person that wants to be right
[34:36] and the first thing he says if it's
[34:38] contrary to the word it's the devil's
[34:39] thinking if it's with the word it's
[34:41] God's thinking if it's a wrong thoughts
[34:43] it's the devil if it's good thoughts of
[34:45] the word of God it's God's thinking if
[34:47] the case may be that the devil is
[34:50] placing thoughts in your mind about a
[34:53] certain thing how may it be overcome or
[34:57] got rid of take the vice versa from it
[35:02] if the devil makes you think that that
[35:06] you are if you know you're a Christian
[35:08] now there again notice where he's coming
[35:10] back coming back to what they said if
[35:14] you know that you are a Christian and he
[35:16] tries to make you think you're not a
[35:18] Christian just take the Versa and say I
[35:22] am a Christian I want you to look at how
[35:24] hard this is I mean it's going to take a
[35:26] pocket scientist isn't it to be able to
[35:30] to do this a't it going to take a a
[35:33] college graduate and four or five
[35:35] different degrees in Theology and aren't
[35:37] we going to have to labor and and just
[35:39] be so smart and so super
[35:42] intelligent no we're not it's going to
[35:45] be so simple that the weakest person in
[35:49] this building tonight and the weakest
[35:51] person that'll be streaming this and
[35:53] there would be in Africa and New Zealand
[35:55] and Australia and all over the world but
[35:57] they'll be hearing these so the weakest
[36:00] person whoever you are can take this
[36:03] right here and defeat the devil and his
[36:06] own grounds so if you know your heart is
[36:10] toward God and you love him with all of
[36:12] your heart let that be the pivotal point
[36:15] that when Satan comes against you that
[36:18] you know that's not who I am that's not
[36:21] what I want I love him I love him I
[36:25] don't want this in my mind I don't want
[36:28] this in my heart then you know you can
[36:31] take the vice versa now if you're evil
[36:33] you're rotten you're not born again and
[36:35] you're a sinner well you're a dirty
[36:37] rotten low down Pig and you're eating
[36:40] slop then you like that sort of
[36:42] thing I don't think there's anybody like
[36:45] that here tonight you wouldn't be here
[36:47] if you were so why are you here for you
[36:50] here to to be damned to Hell anybody
[36:53] come here tonight to be damned anybody
[36:56] come to be turned over to a reprobate
[36:58] mind anybody here that's that come with
[37:01] your mind made up I come intentionally
[37:03] to blashe the Holy Ghost so I'll be lost
[37:07] forever and ever and ever of course not
[37:10] why are we here for because we love the
[37:12] Lord
[37:14] Jesus and we hope that somebody will ask
[37:16] a question that maybe will help us well
[37:19] I'm not sure who asked this but I thank
[37:21] him for asking because it helped me in
[37:23] answering it so we can be benefited
[37:26] can't we so look how simple now that it
[37:29] is it's not that you have to be a
[37:31] preacher and a great but brother Donnie
[37:32] I can't remember the quotes like you can
[37:34] I can't remember like brother darl I I
[37:36] just can't do it you don't have to
[37:39] notice how he simplifies that we can act
[37:43] absolutely as I told the individual last
[37:45] night according to the word of God if
[37:48] you will resist the devil he will flee
[37:53] from you he will actually run from you
[37:56] you like a
[37:58] chicken a
[38:01] coward because he is terrified of a son
[38:05] or daughter of God that knows their
[38:08] position you don't have to be a preacher
[38:10] you don't have to be a prophet but
[38:12] whenever you know you love the Lord
[38:14] Jesus with all of your heart and it
[38:17] kills you if you have a bad dream or a
[38:20] bad thought or if you mess up y'all
[38:22] still mess up of course you do it kills
[38:25] you when you do it and he hates it when
[38:28] you recognize who you are and you just
[38:31] stand right there where you are notice
[38:33] he said as long as your experience
[38:35] matches in God's word say I'm a
[38:37] Christian anything else the same way
[38:40] when you answer this please pray for me
[38:44] to overcome this as I am not by myself
[38:48] well I can sure say Amen to that can't
[38:51] you now watch what he says God grant
[38:55] your overcoming ever who you are may
[38:58] your thoughts just go right on the back
[39:01] on the other side and say I am a
[39:04] Christian I am a believer Satan you have
[39:08] no holdt on
[39:09] me now he didn't have to say this next
[39:12] paragraph that I'm going to read but I'm
[39:15] so glad he did frankly I'm standing
[39:19] right here now saying the same thing
[39:23] keep from
[39:24] fainting right here
[39:27] at the pulpit that's right four or five
[39:30] times I've almost pitched over the
[39:33] pulpit that's the truth God knows that's
[39:37] right so here brother brandham is
[39:40] actually not only answering their
[39:42] question he's living their question so
[39:46] here he is preaching and I know it may
[39:47] seem so odd to you a preacher gets up
[39:50] and preaches under the anointing of the
[39:51] Holy Ghost and if he preaches fast the
[39:53] way I do and brother Daryl does and the
[39:55] other brothers that preach fast and
[39:57] you're talking 90 M an hour and at the
[39:59] same time you're doing that the devil is
[40:02] talking to you and if I'm up preaching
[40:05] and say I'm just a preaching preaching
[40:07] preaching and somebody gets up and they
[40:09] have to go out to go to the bathroom or
[40:11] they have to get up and go take their
[40:13] baby out or whatever and Satan will say
[40:16] you made them mad look at them they're
[40:18] leaving uhoh her husband got up too boy
[40:21] you've made them really mad yeah now
[40:24] you've done it now can you imagine you
[40:27] preaching 90 M an hour and stuff like
[40:30] that going through your mind at the same
[40:33] time you say Brother Don you got a split
[40:35] personality no I got a gift in my life
[40:38] that gets anointed but that's separate
[40:41] from me so here I am standing fighting
[40:44] battles while I'm preaching all hell
[40:47] breaking loose in your mind it's a
[40:49] wonder you even know what what your name
[40:51] is m has been able to do this so here
[40:53] brother brandham is fighting that very
[40:55] thing so he's not telling them something
[40:58] that was just good for them he was
[41:00] telling them what he was doing at the
[41:03] same time don't you appreciate a man of
[41:06] God like
[41:08] that question for brother
[41:12] Donnie if you haven't gone through a
[41:15] great
[41:18] trial does that mean you don't have the
[41:22] Holy
[41:24] Ghost no let me let me say this to you
[41:28] tonight our trials as well as our
[41:33] victories and our walk with
[41:36] God are predestinated to
[41:41] us sometimes whenever I will counsel
[41:43] with people and they will share with me
[41:48] and if Carol is in there with us with me
[41:51] um the thing that they are going through
[41:53] and the burden that they're bearing and
[41:55] um
[41:56] how how difficult it is or this question
[41:59] that they have in their mind and I'm
[42:02] sitting there and listening and praying
[42:04] that God will help me and give me the
[42:07] answer for them if if
[42:09] possible and whenever they will tell me
[42:12] what they're going
[42:14] through and compared to what maybe I've
[42:17] been through that day and what I went
[42:20] through in service that night and uh I
[42:22] was shot by this preacher and blasted by
[42:26] this one and I got this email and this
[42:28] text and this WhatsApp and U this
[42:32] preacher sent me a bunch of quotes uh
[42:34] trying to tear me down right before I
[42:36] walked out which is what happened the
[42:38] last question answers we had right
[42:41] before I walked
[42:43] out and then that person tells me their
[42:46] their problem and I think man
[42:50] alive if that was my problem glory to
[42:54] God oh Jesus I just be floating around
[42:57] on clouds
[42:59] and but you see I don't say that to
[43:02] belittle that person's problem to them
[43:06] that is no doubt a great
[43:09] problem now you can see where a person
[43:12] maybe would hear someone that's been
[43:15] through a terrible thing and they would
[43:18] look at themsel and say I've never
[43:20] really been through anything like that
[43:23] so does that mean I'm not born again no
[43:26] young man young woman whoever it was
[43:28] that asked this it does
[43:31] not I personally believe and I can prove
[43:33] it by the scripture and by the
[43:36] message that some people are ordained of
[43:40] God to go through more than others are
[43:44] some are ordained of God to suffer
[43:48] tremendous things in their life others
[43:52] will look at them and even say it
[43:56] publicly verbally how can they deal with
[43:59] that how can they go through that and
[44:03] and still maintain their
[44:05] sanity read with me in 2 Corinthians 11:
[44:10] 23 Paul in the Corinthian Church now he
[44:14] had to take more of a self-defense mode
[44:17] than he did in some of the other
[44:18] churches also in the Church of galatia
[44:20] because he was being attacked by the
[44:23] false teachers and the false prophets
[44:24] Paul was the one who founded these
[44:26] churches and the false teachers was
[44:28] coming in and trying to lead the people
[44:30] away from Paul actually blasting Paul
[44:33] and saying Paul was a false prophet and
[44:35] the sad part about it was some of the
[44:37] galatian Believers and some of the
[44:39] Corinthian Believers actually left Paul
[44:42] and started following these false
[44:43] preachers which is heartbreaking to me I
[44:46] mean you just think how in the world
[44:47] could they have been that ignorant so
[44:50] Paul has to go into this mode no doubt
[44:53] as a man of God it was very unpleasant
[44:55] for him it was very unpleasant indeed so
[44:58] want you notice he said are they
[45:00] Ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I
[45:04] am more in labor more abundant in
[45:08] Stripes above measure in prisons more
[45:13] frequent and deaths of of the Jews five
[45:17] times received our 40 Stripes save one
[45:20] 39 Stripes Thrice was I beaten with rods
[45:26] once I was stoned Thrice I suffered
[45:30] shipwreck a night and a day have I been
[45:34] in the
[45:35] Deep
[45:37] wow now if you've ever studied the life
[45:40] of Peter or not Bartholomew Matthew Mark
[45:44] Luke andronicus Antiochus many of the
[45:47] early uh Church age fathers and the
[45:50] writers many of them want their great
[45:52] hardships but I have to get to this day
[45:56] find anyone who went through what Paul
[46:00] said that he did we all believe John was
[46:03] a great man right John was bold and
[46:06] allil 24 hours on the aisle of patmas
[46:08] but John was the only one of the
[46:10] Apostles that was allowed to live out
[46:13] his life and not suffer martyrdom isn't
[46:16] that strange that John went through a
[46:18] lot for the Lord Jesus but yet John did
[46:21] not have to go through what Paul did now
[46:23] just reading this little bit here
[46:26] of the Jews five times received our
[46:28] Stripes 40 Stripes save one Thrice
[46:31] beaten with rods because he stole money
[46:34] because he stole somebody's wife because
[46:36] he was a
[46:37] preacher so if we would take Paul and
[46:41] compare Peter to him which one suffered
[46:44] the most Paul did if we would take John
[46:49] where did John mention
[46:51] one1 of what Paul went through he never
[46:54] done it what about and and what about
[46:57] Mark what about Luke so whenever you
[47:01] look at it you realize that God will use
[47:03] some
[47:04] people to be able to display different
[47:09] attributes of
[47:11] himself now say this way that there'll
[47:13] be some men that God will use them and
[47:16] they'll have great uh faith I believe
[47:19] brother Daryl is one of them and God
[47:21] uses brother Daryl and use him all
[47:23] around the world to pray for people and
[47:26] Great Signs and miracles and wonders
[47:30] happen in in his ministry all over the
[47:32] world there's not a man that I know of
[47:34] alive today that I have any more
[47:36] confidence in their prayer than I do
[47:38] brother Daryl
[47:41] Ward yeah he's alive I'm going to give
[47:43] him some roses now why should I just do
[47:44] it whenever he's passed I just want to
[47:46] be honest that's the way I feel about it
[47:48] and and I feel that way not to flatter
[47:49] him but because it's a truth and there's
[47:52] other men no doubt that wish they had
[47:55] had that that brother Daryl has but I
[47:58] wonder if they would wish for what
[48:00] brother Daryl has been through that has
[48:03] helped cultivate and grow that that he
[48:07] has so with every gift that comes from
[48:10] God there is an element of Glory there
[48:12] is also an element of pain an element of
[48:16] reproach an element of shame I think one
[48:19] of the worst mistakes that we can make
[48:21] as Christians is all of us try to be be
[48:24] be and believe that we all have to be
[48:27] exactly the same that we're all just
[48:31] clones so God makes this one perfect
[48:34] Christian then every one of us do
[48:36] exactly the same thing as that one does
[48:39] you will not find that in the teachings
[48:40] of the Bible or the teachings of the
[48:43] message now let me go down through a
[48:45] little bit more of what Paul went
[48:46] through in verse 26 in journeyings often
[48:50] in Perils of waters in Perils of robbers
[48:55] in perils by my own countrymen in perils
[48:59] by the Heathen in perils in the city in
[49:04] perils in the wilderness my Lord this
[49:07] man ain't leaving nothing undone is he
[49:10] everywhere he
[49:12] went in the city in the country in the
[49:15] streets and the back alleys on the ships
[49:19] good thing there wasn't no airplanes cuz
[49:21] if Paul had have been in it it' have
[49:22] crashed he'd have lived of course but
[49:25] he'd come out three broken arms and a
[49:26] net a tooth and look look at what
[49:30] happened to the
[49:32] man now all you know there's no way that
[49:35] that you and I believe that the devil
[49:37] could have done all of this to this man
[49:40] just on his own if Satan had the power
[49:43] to kill all of us we would have been
[49:45] here tonight including me but he can
[49:48] only do as God will allow him to
[49:51] do so now watch this in perils by the
[49:54] heathen perils in the city perils in the
[49:56] wilderness perils in the sea and perils
[49:59] among false Brethren and
[50:02] weariness and
[50:04] painfulness in watchings which meant he
[50:07] sat up all night watching couldn't sleep
[50:11] in watchings often in
[50:15] hunger I thought David said I've never
[50:18] seen the righteous forsaken or his seed
[50:21] begging
[50:24] bread you imagine the devil didn't work
[50:27] on this man and say hey you're supposed
[50:29] to be a prophet Now where's that Lord
[50:32] Jesus that appeared to you that great
[50:34] Pillar of Fire oh yeah you're still
[50:36] bearing the resemblance of that you know
[50:40] the prophet tells us that Paul what he
[50:42] went through that that thorn that kept
[50:45] coming back and leave and come back it
[50:47] was his eyes CU on the pillar fire
[50:49] appeared to him it damaged his
[50:52] eyes and his eyes he'd get all swollen
[50:56] up and pus would run out of his eyes and
[50:59] he had to write with big letters so he
[51:02] had to make big old letters in order to
[51:05] be able to write you mean God would hurt
[51:09] a
[51:11] man why would God do that this man was
[51:15] going to have more than all the rest of
[51:17] the men of the New Testament but he's
[51:20] still going to be left in
[51:22] this so God had to whoop him
[51:27] why because this had become
[51:29] exalted don't never desire great things
[51:32] from God don't never desire to be a
[51:35] great person a great preacher a great
[51:37] you have no idea what you're asking for
[51:40] just be what God's made you and God will
[51:43] predestinate your trials and your
[51:45] victories and your glory and they'll all
[51:48] correspond exactly together now can you
[51:51] imagine when we stand before the Lord
[51:54] now whenever brother ROM went beyond the
[51:55] curtain of time brother brandham never
[51:57] mentioned seeing Paul Peter Luther
[52:01] Wesley any of those the only ones that
[52:04] he saw were the ones that he knew which
[52:06] was in his church age so apparently in
[52:10] that Dimension which is the sixth
[52:12] Dimension it's divided categorically and
[52:16] he did not see Paul or any of Paul's
[52:18] people but whenever we all stand before
[52:20] the Lord we will stand with our church
[52:23] aged messenger and he will will present
[52:25] us there he will stand then the other
[52:28] preachers will stand there with him and
[52:30] he will present us to the Lord Jesus as
[52:33] the Bride of the Le of sin age Paul will
[52:37] stand with his and then the Lord Jesus
[52:40] we will come before him and we will
[52:42] never appear before the white
[52:45] Throne never the white throne but it
[52:48] will be the Throne of rewards so we will
[52:52] stand before the Lord and our record
[52:55] book book will be pulled out not the
[52:57] record of your mistakes not the record
[53:00] of your faults not the record of your
[53:03] shortcomings but the record of your
[53:07] works and what you went through for his
[53:11] sake oh can you imagine when Paul stands
[53:14] up there and this that I read you
[53:17] tonight will be quoted out to him again
[53:22] Paul I see you in perils
[53:27] often perils in the city perils in the
[53:31] country Perils of the Heathen perrows
[53:35] here in stripes in
[53:38] hunger and because of that my
[53:42] son I say a huge portion of Heaven
[53:47] awaits thee enter into the joys of your
[53:52] lord for you have been Faithful over a
[53:55] few things and I will make you ruler
[53:59] over
[54:01] many now will the Lord Jesus say the
[54:03] same thing about me
[54:06] no cuz I've not been in the Perils that
[54:09] Paul did would he say that about you
[54:11] more than likely not brother Joe no you
[54:14] sisters more than likely not I couldn't
[54:18] take all of that could you all could you
[54:20] take that I mean you think how could you
[54:23] take all of that and it not just work
[54:25] against you so bad and there's not a man
[54:28] in the New Testament that wrote about
[54:29] the mystery of God and the Plan of
[54:32] Redemption like Paul did and the
[54:34] blessings of god of what we were in
[54:36] Christ and whenever he talks about being
[54:38] free and he writes in the book of
[54:40] Philippians and it writes those
[54:42] tremendous things about being free in
[54:45] Christ Jesus and what God had done that
[54:48] man was setting in Rome in the maritine
[54:53] prison I I've stood there and looked
[54:57] down that hole where he was in in that
[55:01] prison rats running over his body them
[55:04] dropping his food down a hole and his
[55:08] water the
[55:09] stench must have been
[55:11] horrific How could a Christian do
[55:15] that and be able to put up with that and
[55:18] think yes Jesus you love me so much
[55:21] thank you for your grace you got to be
[55:23] kidding me
[55:26] you see this is why that God wants us
[55:28] every one of us to fit exactly in our
[55:31] calling because whenever our calling
[55:34] we're in obedience to that there'll be
[55:37] certain things you will Fe be able to go
[55:41] through and defeat as long as you're in
[55:44] your right place but if you get out of
[55:46] your calling into another position it's
[55:49] like demons know they're allocated to
[55:51] attack certain positions and do this and
[55:54] this Satan loves nothing better than to
[55:56] get a man or woman boy or girl out of
[55:59] their position over into a wrong
[56:01] position and they come into a rank of
[56:04] demons they are not qualified to
[56:08] handle do you understand one of the
[56:11] greatest positions in America that is
[56:14] vacated more frequent than any other
[56:17] it's not a president it's not a senator
[56:20] it's not a congress it's not police it's
[56:23] pastors the ter turnover for pastors is
[56:27] the highest in the job market why
[56:31] because men think well Mama want me to
[56:34] preach mama I I I went to Seminary I
[56:37] talked to a guy today businessman seven
[56:39] years in the semetary I I mean Seminary
[56:43] I I couldn't keep from feeling sorry for
[56:44] the guy I thought you know you wonder is
[56:46] the guy even called from from God to be
[56:49] able to do it and that's why many men
[56:51] they get in oh I I know I know I'm
[56:53] supposed to I just know I'm supposed to
[56:55] to and they get in there and it nearly
[56:56] drives them
[56:58] insane but if we get where we're
[57:00] supposed to be and then the Trials come
[57:03] our way God will never let the trials
[57:07] overwhelm us if we're Where We
[57:10] Belong so does a person then that has
[57:13] never had a great trial does that mean
[57:15] that're they're not a child of God
[57:17] absolutely not and it could be it just
[57:20] ain't happened
[57:22] yet it may happen but I want you to
[57:25] notice we'll go on here that brother Ron
[57:27] says look at Peter when he was walking
[57:30] by he was a moral born of sinful flesh
[57:32] just like I or you that's right but the
[57:35] people had need of a
[57:40] Healer so they sent God sent Peter to do
[57:45] that specific work what a profound
[57:48] statement the people needed a Healer and
[57:52] God sent Peter to do that work but I
[57:54] want you you notice now the difference
[57:56] between him and John I read this to you
[57:58] just a few weeks ago John was love Peter
[58:03] didn't have the love in his heart that
[58:08] John
[58:09] had but now you see where we fail as I
[58:12] said
[58:13] earlier is that we will pick somebody
[58:17] and we think I want to be like them and
[58:20] now that that's who I want to be like I
[58:22] I want to be like them I hear them pray
[58:25] and boy I I I want to be that
[58:28] way I was always kind of jealous of
[58:31] brother Daryl this is his night he's
[58:33] getting the
[58:34] Roses to hear him pray I mean he just
[58:38] you know just go on and on and on and
[58:41] pray and he's not acting he's not just
[58:44] trying to make up words and and having
[58:47] the men's prayer meetings and some of
[58:49] the brothers might pray for 15 20
[58:52] minutes and they prayed for everybody
[58:54] they knew they pray for their dog their
[58:56] cat their cow their horse their mule
[58:58] they prayed for everything they knew to
[59:00] pray for and they just run out brother
[59:02] Daryl just kept right on going right on
[59:04] going well but look at the difference he
[59:07] gets texts all the time from people all
[59:10] over the world they'll text him 2 in the
[59:11] morning 3: in the morning 4: in the
[59:13] morning I've been with him I know
[59:16] wanting him to pray for this wanting him
[59:17] to pray for that so he has a prayer list
[59:20] that never ends and look how God has
[59:23] matched his ability to pray was the
[59:26] contact of the people that contact him
[59:28] to pray no doubt some of you have done
[59:30] exactly the same thing so whenever God
[59:32] caus us to do a certain thing then it's
[59:35] all fit together I wonder if Peter ever
[59:37] felt a little bit inferior to John
[59:41] because Peter was a fire brand he was a
[59:43] fiery guy great preacher but yet if you
[59:46] know notice reading in the book of Acts
[59:48] and the rest of the Epistles it's not
[59:50] noted that John did near the Miracles
[59:53] that Peter did even when they were at
[59:55] the gate beautiful and Peter and John
[59:58] were together yet the Bible says that
[1:00:01] Peter looked on the man and said Silver
[1:00:04] and Gold Have I None but such as I have
[1:00:08] well what about
[1:00:10] John how come John didn't Peter didn't
[1:00:13] say all right now I'll say the first
[1:00:14] part Silver and Gold Have I None and you
[1:00:17] say the other part
[1:00:18] John but notice what God done there were
[1:00:21] both of them great men of God but yet
[1:00:24] God CH Peter and if you'll read it
[1:00:26] you'll find out he' done more miracles
[1:00:28] than any of the rest of them did but yet
[1:00:32] Peter was not a man of Love the Way John
[1:00:36] was praise the
[1:00:38] Lord Peter didn't love have the love in
[1:00:42] his heart that that John had John was
[1:00:46] God's
[1:00:47] agency of
[1:00:49] love but I wonder which one today we
[1:00:52] would think would be the greatest person
[1:00:56] the man that would do the
[1:00:58] Miracles or one that would have love
[1:01:01] or one that God would allow to suffer in
[1:01:06] such a way that it would seem almost
[1:01:11] unbearable what if God chooses certain
[1:01:14] people to suffer and suffer physically
[1:01:19] psychologically maybe emotionally and
[1:01:22] God will bring an attribute of his own
[1:01:25] nature out of that person's life and
[1:01:29] they may wonder God why am I going
[1:01:31] through this I I don't
[1:01:34] understand let me just as your pastor
[1:01:37] open my heart to you tonight
[1:01:40] okay I believe myself the Lord
[1:01:44] God called my daughter
[1:01:49] Erica to
[1:01:51] suffer in an element that other people
[1:01:54] people had they went through what she
[1:01:57] went through they would have broke under
[1:02:00] it me and her mama
[1:02:04] saw we saw a lot of what she went
[1:02:06] through and no doubt she hid a lot from
[1:02:10] us but never one
[1:02:14] time did I hear her
[1:02:17] complain never one time did I hear her
[1:02:20] say God why how come don't you love me
[1:02:25] why would you do
[1:02:27] that
[1:02:30] why but that little girl's Life Touch
[1:02:33] preachers preachers around the
[1:02:36] world how could she have done that if
[1:02:40] God had not given her that special
[1:02:43] Grace but now for other people to try to
[1:02:46] do that they would fail miserably you
[1:02:49] understand what I'm saying so each of us
[1:02:52] our our walk with God our position how
[1:02:55] far we'll be elevated in God there's
[1:02:59] there's great preachers my goodness that
[1:03:01] preach circles around me and preachers
[1:03:03] that'll have experiences with God that I
[1:03:05] I'll never be allowed to have I know
[1:03:07] that I I've accepted that a long time
[1:03:09] ago but I know one
[1:03:12] thing I want my own and I want what God
[1:03:17] has for me I'll never be what some of
[1:03:20] the great men in the message are but
[1:03:22] really if God don't want me to be that
[1:03:24] way I don't want to either I want to be
[1:03:27] what God wants me to be anybody else
[1:03:29] feel that way tonight and I refuse to be
[1:03:31] jealous of anyone who would have more or
[1:03:35] bigger you know that's the way we think
[1:03:37] more and bigger and bigger Miracles and
[1:03:40] more miracles and more people and more
[1:03:42] and more and bigger and bigger I I I
[1:03:45] just never have thought that way and I
[1:03:46] don't think that way now what I want
[1:03:49] whatever it is that has my name on it
[1:03:51] that's what I want what God thought
[1:03:54] about me and what what attributes does
[1:03:57] he want me to
[1:03:58] express I honestly believe that there
[1:04:01] are preachers that are called like Paul
[1:04:05] to publicly bear the reproach for Christ
[1:04:09] and his word they will be more publicly
[1:04:12] ridiculed than others they will be even
[1:04:15] picked on by others it don't mean
[1:04:18] they're greater than others it just
[1:04:21] means that God wants to use them to
[1:04:24] Express an attribute of his being that
[1:04:27] say the miracle working Gody will never
[1:04:30] touch or say the person that God is
[1:04:33] using to express his faithfulness and
[1:04:35] his patience when it comes to en
[1:04:38] enduring sickness and things like that
[1:04:40] and there's so many attributes that he
[1:04:42] has so you young people will bring glory
[1:04:46] to God in a way I couldn't even dream of
[1:04:50] you go through things in your school and
[1:04:53] in your college and on your job you go
[1:04:56] through things I never face that I'll
[1:04:59] never have to deal with most of my
[1:05:01] dealings is with Christians I'll bump
[1:05:04] into Center people at Lowe's or Home
[1:05:06] Depot or something like that but I don't
[1:05:09] really deal with that many people the
[1:05:11] way you have to so God cannot really
[1:05:14] choose me to express that attribute the
[1:05:19] way he would some of you and yet you
[1:05:21] think I don't never do nothing for the
[1:05:23] Lord every day you live and work and
[1:05:26] walk as a Christian you've expressed an
[1:05:29] attribute of God's mercy and you're
[1:05:31] doing it in a way that I can't even
[1:05:34] touch and when you stand before the Lord
[1:05:37] that is written in the book of
[1:05:40] remembrance watch how brother bam deals
[1:05:42] with this he said look when he taken
[1:05:44] Peter James and John hope faith and
[1:05:48] charity don't you see those gifted
[1:05:51] people there the three hope faith faith
[1:05:54] and charity Hope was in James now James
[1:05:58] is a great man but you don't find the
[1:06:00] supernatural in James Ministry the way
[1:06:02] it was in Peter and James was not noted
[1:06:06] as one of a man of love not saying it
[1:06:09] didn't have love I don't think that I'm
[1:06:10] thinking tonight that well it'll only be
[1:06:13] certain people that'll have love no
[1:06:15] every member of the body of Christ will
[1:06:18] have love but there will be some that
[1:06:21] will
[1:06:22] excel in love
[1:06:25] you understand that and there'll be some
[1:06:26] that'll have signs and wonders and
[1:06:28] miracles and there'll be others that
[1:06:30] will excel in that and God chose them
[1:06:33] for that but that's only the glory side
[1:06:36] they will also have to pay a greater
[1:06:38] price than those who have less it just
[1:06:42] comes with the territory want you notice
[1:06:44] how he Compares this and things that
[1:06:46] ought to be I don't believe that when we
[1:06:48] get to heaven that we'll all be just
[1:06:50] everybody look exactly alike I don't
[1:06:52] believe that we'll all be blonde or
[1:06:54] brunettes or little or big or all Giants
[1:06:57] I believe that God is a god of variety
[1:06:59] the world proves that he's got big
[1:07:01] mountains little mountains he's got
[1:07:03] Plains he's got deserts he's got
[1:07:05] different things because he made it the
[1:07:06] way he wanted it he made the season
[1:07:09] summer winter spring autumn it shows
[1:07:11] he's a god of variety he made you in a
[1:07:14] variety now listen what's in the family
[1:07:16] of God some men are
[1:07:21] blusterous some are real
[1:07:25] dogmatic others are
[1:07:29] fine others are
[1:07:32] kind you just find all different kinds
[1:07:35] of people and in
[1:07:39] his
[1:07:43] kingdom praise God there's hope for us
[1:07:46] as sure as there's a
[1:07:48] world aren't you glad there's hope for
[1:07:51] the blusterous now there might be some
[1:07:53] blusterous people sitting here tonight
[1:07:55] and they really struggle being around
[1:07:58] the fine people some people are just so
[1:08:01] fine and so kind and so
[1:08:05] delicate and you blusterous people feel
[1:08:08] like I don't know what around them don't
[1:08:10] you and you think there ain't no hope
[1:08:11] for me oh yes there is There's Hope for
[1:08:14] all of
[1:08:15] us and the the people that are natured
[1:08:18] in that way all that those attributes
[1:08:21] they're
[1:08:22] expressing but there will also be
[1:08:24] attributes expressed in the blusterous
[1:08:28] person that those that are more Gentile
[1:08:31] will never be able to express God will
[1:08:35] be able to get a hold of that
[1:08:37] temperament and do something with that
[1:08:39] temperament and prove it's him that does
[1:08:42] it and it will actually bring glory to
[1:08:45] the kingdom of God you said boy that old
[1:08:47] boy my goodness that man had a temper Oh
[1:08:51] my he was wound up tired on an eight day
[1:08:54] clock on boy he would just buzz up in
[1:08:55] your face isn't it amazing what the
[1:08:58] Lord's done for him isn't it awesome
[1:09:01] what God's done for that sister remember
[1:09:03] she was this and this and this and look
[1:09:05] what God has done so God chose that
[1:09:09] person to be able to bring this
[1:09:11] attribute of himself into them and they
[1:09:14] hate it oh God I wish I wasn't that way
[1:09:17] I wish I was like so and so they're so
[1:09:19] nice but what if all of us was
[1:09:22] nice
[1:09:24] I imagine there's some here tonight that
[1:09:27] are I hope I me I'm thinking that surely
[1:09:30] there are somebody that
[1:09:31] are but what if all of us were just so
[1:09:34] gentle and just so kind none of us had
[1:09:36] any issues whatsoever boy wouldn't we
[1:09:39] look down our nose on them people that
[1:09:40] come to church here on Sunday morning
[1:09:42] that's got all the problems we'd say you
[1:09:44] all ought to come and fellowship with us
[1:09:47] and hang around us all of us goody goody
[1:09:50] two
[1:09:51] shoes but the truth of it it is all of
[1:09:55] us have issues don't
[1:09:57] we all of us got issues all of us got
[1:10:00] problems and all of us need God to help
[1:10:03] us don't we including the man preaching
[1:10:05] to you tonight and yet God will
[1:10:09] diversify Now watch how he Compares them
[1:10:12] look at St Peter and judge him by
[1:10:17] Andrew Andrew is that prayer Warrior
[1:10:21] just stayed on his knees all the
[1:10:25] time and the Apostle Peter was one of
[1:10:27] those fire brands that preached and so
[1:10:29] forth let me know how Peter was but I'm
[1:10:31] so glad Peter's mistakes was written in
[1:10:33] the Bible ain't you you know the only
[1:10:35] time A lot of times that people Peter
[1:10:37] opened his mouth was to change feet that
[1:10:40] was the only time he opened his mouth he
[1:10:42] put his foot in his mouth one time after
[1:10:44] another L his temper arrogant aren't you
[1:10:48] glad those things are written about such
[1:10:50] a man look at what God done with him but
[1:10:53] God shows a man with that makeup and be
[1:10:56] able to make such a man out of him but
[1:10:59] you never find Peter saying he went
[1:11:01] through what Paul went
[1:11:03] through but I wonder how the people in
[1:11:06] that day must have looked at Paul and
[1:11:08] said how come that dear brother go
[1:11:11] through so much stuff they'd have to say
[1:11:13] like brother Tracy it's just God
[1:11:17] honey that's all you can say it's just
[1:11:22] God but but how many other people that
[1:11:25] we would look at them and say look at
[1:11:27] that poor brother that poor
[1:11:30] sister they've been so sick and they've
[1:11:32] been through this and that and the other
[1:11:34] and they they just they encourage you
[1:11:36] and they just seem like they just always
[1:11:38] have a great attitude how in the world
[1:11:40] can they do that same God different
[1:11:44] attribute and using them now I don't
[1:11:46] mind telling you we may look down on
[1:11:48] people that are prayed for whether it's
[1:11:50] a physical thing or an emotional thing
[1:11:53] and it seem seem like that they just
[1:11:54] never get delivered and yet God will
[1:11:57] allow that thing to linger and linger
[1:12:00] brother R talks about a sister out in
[1:12:02] Arizona and whenever he went to preach
[1:12:04] he was there a couple different times
[1:12:06] and she was in a wheelchair now he said
[1:12:08] this sister he said look at her she's
[1:12:10] just like a rose among you she said he
[1:12:12] said and said she just smiled and she's
[1:12:14] got this great temperament about her so
[1:12:17] what he was doing was looking there and
[1:12:18] there was people during those meetings
[1:12:20] that was absolutely healed but yet there
[1:12:22] was something about this sister that was
[1:12:25] emanating Victory even though as far as
[1:12:28] I know she never did get
[1:12:31] healed but yet still had Faith to
[1:12:34] believe that God could do it but if God
[1:12:36] had a reason that he's using her to be
[1:12:39] able to bring it out you know Paul wrote
[1:12:40] about those in the Old Testament the
[1:12:41] book of Hebrews and he said they never
[1:12:44] obtained the
[1:12:46] promise they never got it but they
[1:12:50] believed God to the very last breath
[1:12:53] left their bodies so God told Abraham
[1:12:56] I'm going to give you this whole land
[1:12:57] every bit of it yours and your seed and
[1:13:00] yet when his wife died he didn't even
[1:13:03] have a spot big enough in the ground to
[1:13:06] bury
[1:13:08] her but according to God he owned it
[1:13:13] all and he had to go buy a burial place
[1:13:18] isn't it amazing they believed and they
[1:13:20] trusted and people say oh my goodness
[1:13:22] they didn't have faith they did have
[1:13:24] faith they did have faith and they
[1:13:27] believed and it's the same way with our
[1:13:30] battles can to have a few more minutes
[1:13:32] before we
[1:13:33] close notice brother BR in the
[1:13:35] Masterpiece now the patriarch Foundation
[1:13:38] First Abraham then Isaac Jacob Joseph
[1:13:40] the Four Corners Abraham was the
[1:13:42] foundation of Faith let's say it had
[1:13:45] four foundations the foundation of Faith
[1:13:48] the foundation of love was Isaac the
[1:13:52] foundation of Grace
[1:13:54] was Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone
[1:13:56] knows that but in Joseph was
[1:14:00] Perfection I I'm sure that you've
[1:14:02] noticed it before Abraham the great
[1:14:04] patriarchal father God did great things
[1:14:06] through the man his son Isaac not so
[1:14:12] much anybody tell me any great Miracles
[1:14:14] Isaac ever
[1:14:17] did tell me what great things that Isaac
[1:14:20] ever
[1:14:21] accomplished he was the son of a great
[1:14:23] man and the father of a great
[1:14:27] man but he wasn't so much a great man he
[1:14:31] was just a mediocre man in between two
[1:14:34] great
[1:14:36] people but how's Jacob going to get here
[1:14:40] without an Isaac now I wonder how many
[1:14:42] Isaacs that there's going to be in
[1:14:44] heaven but we focus on the Abrahams and
[1:14:47] the
[1:14:48] Jacobs so here was Abraham the great
[1:14:50] patriarchal foundation and then you've
[1:14:52] got an Isaac and what do we know about
[1:14:55] Isaac well he was a type of Christ and
[1:14:58] that Rebecca was was his bride and he
[1:15:01] was a type of Christ we know he lied we
[1:15:03] know that he denied his wife what other
[1:15:06] great things did the man do what battles
[1:15:09] did he
[1:15:11] win you ever take any of his servants
[1:15:13] like Abraham did 318 Warriors and go up
[1:15:16] against the the kings of of the veil of
[1:15:18] Sodom and gomorra against the Slime pits
[1:15:20] no what what great things did he do well
[1:15:24] he dug a well or
[1:15:27] two he followed the message believe what
[1:15:30] God
[1:15:31] Said the son of a great man and the
[1:15:34] father of a great
[1:15:35] man raised and influenced greatly by his
[1:15:39] mother a man then that was given the
[1:15:42] trait by the prophet as a man of love
[1:15:46] but as far as great faith did he have
[1:15:48] the great faith Abraham had no he didn't
[1:15:51] but was he necessary absolutely
[1:15:56] essential in the foundations of the
[1:15:59] Masterpiece now this is a sermon brother
[1:16:01] Bram is preaching so God laid the
[1:16:03] patriarchal Foundation of Abraham Faith
[1:16:07] second patriarchal Foundation Isaac in
[1:16:10] love the third patriarchal Foundation
[1:16:13] Jacob God's grace to Jacob but Joseph
[1:16:18] was
[1:16:19] Perfection totally different than
[1:16:21] Abraham totally different than
[1:16:24] Isaac totally different than his father
[1:16:28] all of them were needed you know how
[1:16:30] many of you all are needed every one of
[1:16:34] you men women boys girls black white red
[1:16:38] yellow Rich poor in the middle somewhere
[1:16:41] every one of you are needed and
[1:16:44] important to God and important to our
[1:16:47] church and to our church family now you
[1:16:51] may be a foundation of faith God may use
[1:16:53] you as a foundation of love God may use
[1:16:55] you as a foundation of Grace but
[1:16:57] wherever God uses you just keep in mind
[1:17:01] with that will come an element of Glory
[1:17:03] with that will come trials Isaac never
[1:17:06] had the trials that his father nor his
[1:17:10] son
[1:17:12] had isn't it amazing the
[1:17:15] brothers Joseph's brothers they were
[1:17:18] chosen of God put all 11 of them
[1:17:21] together they never had the trials that
[1:17:25] Joseph had but what if they went and
[1:17:27] tried to make them themselves well you
[1:17:29] know what I love God too I I want to be
[1:17:31] chosen by God and they were but they
[1:17:33] were chosen for different positions so
[1:17:37] whoever asked this question because
[1:17:39] you've never had a great trial does it
[1:17:41] mean you haven't had the Holy Ghost no
[1:17:44] it does not mean that at all and some
[1:17:46] people will go through life and they may
[1:17:49] never have a great tremendous thing and
[1:17:53] they'll look at others and think my they
[1:17:55] went through this I feel so sorry for
[1:17:57] them and they went through that and I I
[1:17:59] I'm I must not be worth very much I must
[1:18:02] not be no maybe that's exactly where God
[1:18:05] placed you you're in between two slabs
[1:18:07] of foundations of great trials and
[1:18:11] test the church went through those
[1:18:13] stages in the book of
[1:18:15] Acts they would be persecuted from the
[1:18:18] outside and then the Bible said the
[1:18:21] churches had rest
[1:18:23] when an emperor change would come from
[1:18:25] the Roman Empire there was always a
[1:18:28] political change and a political head of
[1:18:30] course but after Christianity became
[1:18:32] what they considered a threat to Rome it
[1:18:35] would it would depend upon the emperor
[1:18:37] now dioclesian was one of the worst that
[1:18:39] ever was Nero some of them but then
[1:18:41] there was others and they were kind of
[1:18:44] partial to Christianity I'm talking
[1:18:46] about prec Constantine era they were a
[1:18:48] little bit partial to Christianity and
[1:18:51] God would actually use that political
[1:18:53] head and it would bring a little bit of
[1:18:55] rest into the churches so if you follow
[1:18:58] that that same symbol in the church ases
[1:19:01] you'll see some of the church ases went
[1:19:03] down into such heavy heavy dark
[1:19:06] persecution and then others it's like
[1:19:08] they come out on the other side and they
[1:19:10] had hundreds of years and it just seemed
[1:19:13] like they floated right along it was not
[1:19:15] a great difficult thing to serve God it
[1:19:18] wasn't like your your life was on the
[1:19:20] line and then that generation go out and
[1:19:23] another generation look at us in the
[1:19:25] last days the most difficult age that's
[1:19:28] ever been on the Earth but some of our
[1:19:30] grandmothers and grandfathers they also
[1:19:33] had their
[1:19:34] trials but each one of us if we'll find
[1:19:37] our spot we will be tempered according
[1:19:41] to the amount of test that we can endure
[1:19:44] aren't you grateful for that 2
[1:19:47] Corinthians chap 1:5 for as the
[1:19:49] sufferings of
[1:19:51] Christ abound in us so our consolation
[1:19:55] also aboundeth by Christ I find this so
[1:20:00] amazing that Paul actually
[1:20:03] identifies some of what Christians go
[1:20:06] through are actually the sufferings of
[1:20:10] Jesus
[1:20:12] himself not for
[1:20:14] him but they're actually his
[1:20:17] sufferings whether we be afflicted it's
[1:20:20] for your consolation now watch here is
[1:20:23] showing them that part of what he's
[1:20:25] going through is for them and salvation
[1:20:28] which is effectual in the enduring of
[1:20:30] the same sufferings which we also suffer
[1:20:33] whether we be comforted it is for your
[1:20:36] consolation and salvation second
[1:20:38] Corinthians 1:7 Our Hope of you is
[1:20:41] steadfast knowing that as ye are
[1:20:44] partakers of the
[1:20:47] sufferings so shall you also be of the
[1:20:50] consolation for we not but not brethren
[1:20:53] have you ignorant of our trouble which
[1:20:54] came to us in Asia that we were pressed
[1:20:58] out of
[1:21:00] measure above strengths in so much that
[1:21:04] we even
[1:21:06] despaired of
[1:21:08] Life Paul reached the spot that he
[1:21:12] thought I'll not make it I will not come
[1:21:16] through this one it's so bad I'll never
[1:21:20] make it maybe some of you have been in
[1:21:22] there maybe some of you will never have
[1:21:25] to go through that but it don't mean
[1:21:28] that you're not a Christian it does not
[1:21:29] mean that you don't love God with all of
[1:21:32] your heart but God will allow each of us
[1:21:36] to be tested to the spot that he can
[1:21:39] bring us
[1:21:40] to I think whenever I stand and preach
[1:21:44] and Lord willing in July I'll be 68
[1:21:47] years old I've been preaching since I
[1:21:49] was 18 so that's as you guessed it 50
[1:21:52] years
[1:21:53] 20 minutes of inspirational preaching is
[1:21:55] like eight hours of work so if I preach
[1:21:58] about an hour then I've I've worked
[1:22:01] equivalent to 24 hours so I've done that
[1:22:04] for
[1:22:06] decades and yet it takes a lot out of
[1:22:10] me but I think of my dear friend brother
[1:22:14] Ron
[1:22:17] Spencer taking about 30 pills a
[1:22:21] day and he text brother Tim and I
[1:22:24] yesterday and he went to have scans and
[1:22:25] doctor's appointments
[1:22:27] and vomiting
[1:22:30] sick text me month and a half two months
[1:22:33] ago going to church Sunday morning to
[1:22:36] preach vomited eight times before he got
[1:22:40] there to get up and preach and give
[1:22:43] everything that he
[1:22:45] had brother Daryl called me five 6
[1:22:48] months ago in a motel laying flat on his
[1:22:52] back in the floor in a motel with his
[1:22:55] feet and legs up on the bed was the only
[1:22:58] place that he could find any relief
[1:23:00] because his back was killing
[1:23:03] him and I
[1:23:06] think I don't guess I really went
[1:23:08] through
[1:23:10] much but yet I know I've went through
[1:23:13] things that neither Brother Daryl old
[1:23:16] brother Ron has went through and both of
[1:23:19] them have told me brother Donnie I don't
[1:23:22] see how you do it I don't see how you do
[1:23:24] it I don't see how you put up with it it
[1:23:26] drive me
[1:23:27] crazy so each one of us are called in
[1:23:31] different ways and what would it all be
[1:23:33] when it's all said and done and we will
[1:23:35] all stand before him at that day and
[1:23:38] there will be people that have said
[1:23:39] about you and you and you and you I
[1:23:42] don't see how you did it I understand
[1:23:45] when you got saved your whole family
[1:23:47] forsook you I understand that when you
[1:23:49] come to the message of the hour your
[1:23:51] family just I could never do that I
[1:23:53] don't know how you did that how did you
[1:23:55] do that you see that will be the
[1:23:57] commonality among all of us that
[1:24:00] question will be asked in German and
[1:24:05] Africans it will be asked in French in
[1:24:11] Spanish in English it will be asked in
[1:24:15] many languages around the world how did
[1:24:17] you do
[1:24:18] it and the answer will be the same for
[1:24:22] all of
[1:24:24] us he helped
[1:24:26] me he helped
[1:24:30] me praise God one day when we stand
[1:24:34] before the Lord and we look at
[1:24:36] Paul and when we get to fellowship with
[1:24:39] him say brother Paul how did you do that
[1:24:43] I read that so many times about you and
[1:24:45] every time I did it it just pricked my
[1:24:48] heart and tore me all to pieces for you
[1:24:49] brother how did you deal with that
[1:24:53] God help
[1:24:55] me whenever we asked brother Brandon
[1:24:57] brother BR how did you go through all
[1:24:59] that you did the world hated you they
[1:25:02] despised you how did you do it the
[1:25:06] answer will be the same he helped me
[1:25:09] you'll be asked the same thing how did
[1:25:11] you live in that last day oh I heard it
[1:25:14] was horrible I heard it was the worst
[1:25:17] age for any human being to ever live how
[1:25:19] did you ever do it let me tell tell you
[1:25:23] what you all are going to
[1:25:25] say his
[1:25:28] grace his grace helped
[1:25:30] us that's how we
[1:25:34] overcome this is one thing I love about
[1:25:36] him he calls us for a certain work he
[1:25:40] empowers us enables us helps us to do
[1:25:43] it then we stand before him and rewards
[1:25:48] us for what he helped us
[1:25:51] do and sometimes people say well it
[1:25:53] ain't fair I agree it ain't Fair it
[1:25:56] ain't fair for him he helps me do what I
[1:26:00] do and then I'm going to stand before
[1:26:02] him that
[1:26:03] day and he's going to reward me are you
[1:26:06] kidding
[1:26:08] me what do I
[1:26:11] deserve what do you
[1:26:14] deserve if I got what I deserved it
[1:26:17] would not be Heaven it would not be his
[1:26:21] Mercy
[1:26:25] Hallelujah let's bow our heads together
[1:26:27] we'll stop here for
[1:26:35] tonight thank you for these questions
[1:26:39] Lord I've been so blessed as I've
[1:26:41] studied Him
[1:26:45] Father I thank you for the use of our
[1:26:47] church I love each one of
[1:26:50] them I thank you for the desire desire
[1:26:52] to live for you and to serve
[1:26:55] you I pray you'd keep them
[1:26:57] Jesus help
[1:26:59] them give them strength
[1:27:02] father May each one of them find that
[1:27:05] spot in their life of what you've called
[1:27:08] them to
[1:27:10] be then Lord when the trials and the
[1:27:12] tests come they will have what it will
[1:27:16] take to match the
[1:27:18] trial and we know that it would be
[1:27:21] Unbecoming to your nature to call us for
[1:27:24] a work and then that work destroy us it
[1:27:28] makes no
[1:27:29] sense it's not the work that destroys us
[1:27:32] either we take too much on ourself or we
[1:27:35] get out of our calling and we get in
[1:27:37] over our heads and we can't get
[1:27:40] out so Lord I pray that you'd help each
[1:27:43] of us I Know Myself father when I've got
[1:27:46] so weary and I felt like I
[1:27:49] couldn't couldn't put one foot in front
[1:27:51] of the other
[1:27:53] and I went to look around and just kind
[1:27:55] of survey
[1:27:57] everything I begin to realize it was not
[1:28:01] you it was
[1:28:03] me I got I got too busy I I took more on
[1:28:08] me than what I should
[1:28:10] have it was never you I pray you'd help
[1:28:14] each of us
[1:28:16] father we know when your Prophet first
[1:28:18] started out and he tells us about being
[1:28:21] out there Arkansas in the prayer line 8
[1:28:25] days and eight nights he ate his meals
[1:28:27] on the platform they had a caught on the
[1:28:30] platform and he would take a break and
[1:28:34] sleep a little bit on the platform and
[1:28:37] then get up and pray for people and when
[1:28:40] he got done there was more people to be
[1:28:42] prayed for than what he had prayed for
[1:28:44] in all them
[1:28:45] days and yet after those meetings he
[1:28:49] runs off off the road into a field
[1:28:53] has a nervous breakdown nearly loses his
[1:28:56] mind and he said does God do that to a
[1:29:00] man and then he answers his question no
[1:29:04] man does that to
[1:29:07] himself so he had a great desire to help
[1:29:11] so many
[1:29:12] people help us father as we try to do
[1:29:15] what you've called us to do to be
[1:29:18] balanced and all you've not given to any
[1:29:22] any of us to save the
[1:29:24] world we know father you're the
[1:29:27] Savior so help us to work within our
[1:29:30] limits and to realize that even you told
[1:29:33] your disciples they must come apart and
[1:29:37] rest a while and as a preacher told me
[1:29:40] years ago either you come apart and rest
[1:29:43] a while or you come
[1:29:46] apart so help each of us fathers mothers
[1:29:50] Housewives young married couple singles
[1:29:52] whatever we are Lord that we can find
[1:29:55] what you've called us to be and be
[1:29:58] faithful therein
[1:30:00] Lord May each of us Lord Jesus do as the
[1:30:04] scripture tells us casting your cares
[1:30:07] upon Him for he cares for
[1:30:12] you Lord would you minister to every
[1:30:14] heart here tonight and those that have
[1:30:15] streamed the surface heal the sick
[1:30:18] encourage those that might be
[1:30:20] discouraged we love love you father
[1:30:23] thank you for our little gathering time
[1:30:25] tonight blessed I pray in Jesus name
[1:30:31] Amen brother Jill brother Rob whichever
[1:30:35] of
[1:30:50] you just to share
[1:30:55] one just share one thought that I was
[1:30:58] thinking of
[1:31:00] um I want you to recognize I want you to
[1:31:04] recognize what's happening for us when I
[1:31:07] was your age and I know old people
[1:31:09] always say when I was your age right
[1:31:12] there was no opportunity for me to ask a
[1:31:15] question to anyone about
[1:31:18] anything there even if I had asked
[1:31:21] questions to someone to ask what about
[1:31:24] this what about God's nature what about
[1:31:26] that there was not inspiration for
[1:31:29] anyone to give me an answer so recognize
[1:31:32] what God does for us and how he loves us
[1:31:35] and a capacity to ask a question and
[1:31:38] have someone with brother Donnie for 50
[1:31:40] years that been studying and learning of
[1:31:42] God and Anointed God to be able to gift
[1:31:44] as a gift to me as a gift to you or to
[1:31:48] the body to expound on things to give us
[1:31:51] answers to to life when I started
[1:31:53] reading the message what was so profound
[1:31:56] to me at my age in my 30s with the is
[1:31:59] that there were answers to
[1:32:01] life a man had wondered about certain
[1:32:05] things of why am I here what am I here
[1:32:07] for what am I to do what's it all about
[1:32:10] there must be more there were answers in
[1:32:14] the capacity of things that I was
[1:32:15] reading that were coming to and popping
[1:32:17] to me to recognize this is what it's
[1:32:19] about and this is what the world so
[1:32:21] starves for so what so I don't want you
[1:32:23] to miss or Miss at your age for the the
