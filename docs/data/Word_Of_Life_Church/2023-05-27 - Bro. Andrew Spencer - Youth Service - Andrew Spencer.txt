here tonight that the word of the Lord would speak to us amen it's good to be here in the house of the Lord with you today we certainly counted a privilege to be standing before the Bride of Jesus Christ as as young people we encountered a privilege to be able to speak to God's young people and God bless you Sister Mariah so good to see you and and you know you're very special people you know when brother Brandon was up there on that mountain and getting ready to hear what the to go back east and reveal the seals that the angel said something specifically about the young people he said especially about those young people and you're a special class of people and we counted it such an honor to be standing with you today in this hour and just want to say God bless you we bring greetings from our home Church Full Gospel Lighthouse and our our pastor brother Ron Spencer and and he just wants to send his greetings to you and just say God bless you we certainly appreciate brother Joe inviting us and having us come here we've you guys have been a part of our family forever we just counted an honor that brother Donnie would open up the services here for this this weekend so how many has a need that you'd like to make known unto the Lord here tonight and man God sees each and every one of your hands so let's just talk to the master tonight and invite him to come and take the service Heavenly Father we come before you tonight Lord it means so much to us Lord to recognize that Lord that your presence is he your father and that you're doing a special very special things right here in this moment Lord and we just ask Lord that you would come and Lord take control of this service Lord every person and every ability that is went in to make this service possible we want you to come father and put your blessings upon this weekend father I believe God that you have something very particular in story here tonight Lord and we just asked Lord that you would come down in a very Supernatural way and begin to express yourself through your word Lord I don't know all of these young people I've stood before them many times Lord Jesus in different places father and I've watched you work in their lives but Lord they've come back again one more time Lord to ask you that you administer to them in a supernatural way Lord let us just step aside and may the Holy Spirit get in the word tonight may we just get into a channel where you can pour out your spirit like never before in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look in a couple portions of scripture in the Old Testament here in the book Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13 just one scripture there also Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23. Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13. and by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you something that the Lord woke me up about about a month ago and specifically asked me to say these things here or or just begin to deal with me and I personally never it's not how I would typically open up a youth service it's not how I would typically become acquainted with a congregation to speak some things like this but he he laid some things on my heart about a month ago to speak tonight on The Cry for Help The Cry for Help Genesis chapter 22 and verse 13 and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a Thicket by his Thorns by by his horns and Abraham went and took the realm and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23. amen Exodus chapter 2 and verse 23 and it came to pass that in the process of time that the king of Egypt died and the children of Israel's Side by reason of the bondage and they cried and their Cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage and God heard their groaning and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham and it's a very powerful thing when God goes to remembering his promises when God goes to remembering his promises something is laying there in store for his children and God remembered his Covenant with Abraham with Isaac and with Jacob and God looked upon the children of Israel and God had respect unto them verse chapter 3 and verse 1. now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law the priest of Midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to up and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why this bush is not burned and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and Moses and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hi hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou stand is is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the afflictions of my people can we say that together I've seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by reason of the taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and enlarge in a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place under the place of the Canaanites the Hittites the amorites the rizats and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord as we said we'd like to speak to you just for a few minutes tonight on the cry for help and we realize tonight that we are serving a God who is a very caring God a God that knows all things he understands all things and we recognize that that by the teachings of the Bible that our God is an omniscient God and him being omniscient we recognize that he is omnipresent he knows all things he understands all things he sees all things there is nothing that is happening that our Lord Jesus Christ doesn't already know or have in his control and this conference that we've just read about here in Exodus chapter 2 came from a time when when God was speaking to Abraham and he told him that I am going to watch over your seed and your seed is going to sojourn in a Strange Land they're going to be there for 400 years and he recognizes that that that there in this moment that before Moses ever got on the scene that God had already made a way of Escape out for the children of God before they ever got in the midst of trouble and I think it's a wonderful thing tonight that before we ever got ourselves in the mess that we got ourself in that God has already pre-planned a way to get us out of the chaos of life that we sometimes get ourself into and it's a wonderful thing to know that the god that you're serving is already working everything for the good to them that love God and we recognize that that when Moses was in this spot that he was in that he was serving a God that would never leave him and never forsake Him and I say this tonight that tonight we're not serving a different God that Moses was serving but we're serving the same exact God tonight that can do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think and tonight we recognize that his eyes run to and fro and I know as young people that there are certain things in your life that you face in and there's certain calamities of life and things or anxieties of life that you're going through but there is nothing that our Lord Jesus Christ can't help you out with tonight can you say Amen tonight that God is able to get me out of the chaos that I am in and we recognize that very very familiar to the word of the three Hebrew children that God didn't send somebody else down there to get them out when they were in need of help that God himself came down there and he showed up now the Bible said in Psalms 18 and 6 that in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even unto his ears so David found him that in his midst of his distress and in the midst of his danger he called upon God and he found out that God was ready to help him in Psalms 34 and 15 it says the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are up open under their cry Psalms 139 and 4 it says that therefore there is not a word in my tongue but Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together thou Hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me such knowledge is too wonderful me for me it is high and I cannot attain it wither shall I go from thy Spirit or wither shall I flee from thy presence if I ascended to the heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there so what was David finding out he was finding out that he was serving the god that is known as Jehovah's Hammer that the Lord is there if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there so there is showing to you as young people there is nowhere that you can run to that our God isn't already there and to think that tonight before you got in the Trap of sin and before you got in your sickness and before you got in your pain God heard you and he saw you where you are Psalms 107 and 6 says then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses so you see there is a spot in life and I understand that you can go over in Exodus 14 when God is having a conversation with Moses and he says why cry speak but there are times in your life that you just have to have a cry session there's some times in your life that you are in the midst of distress and you need to be able to roll upon the Billows roll upon the bosom of Abraham's father upon almighty God and lay your head over on El Shady eye and nurse from El shadiah brother Bosworth told us he told us that the baby that cries aloud us is the one that gets the most attention and brother Branham says so I think it pays us to cry a little bit once in a while you recognize that immediately in the Bible that the Bible tells us about a woman that was a persistent Widow that was constantly knocking upon the unjust judge's door laying there and telling him to avenge me of my adversary but tonight you are not a widow you have a you have a faithful husband that is willing to help you out of any chaos of life that you are in but we recognize going back to our text tonight that God had a Time that he was going to fulfill his word he promised to Abraham and his seed that his seed was going to sojourn in a Strange Land I don't know if that's all right to put it there but I'm gonna put it there but he promised that Abraham that his seed was going to sojourn in a Strange Land for a long time for 400 years but he was going to bring them out of it when the time of the promise Drew not and it's a wonderful thing to know that God has a perfect time that he's going to do things and I want you to know that you're in the time of that now so God raised up a Boy by the name of Moses and Moses was born for a specific purpose you know Moses had never heard of the voice of God he'd just been told about it by his mama and the daddy and the teachers of that day that such and such was coming that God was going to send a deliverer and he said it his mama would tell him says son I believe that you are the one and Moses didn't necessarily know it for sure but he was laying upon the experience of a his mother or his father and I believe that's the problem with so many children today or young people is that they're relying upon their mother or their father's experiences and they've never had an experience with a pillar of fire for themselves but they want you to know young people that that same Pillar of Fire that Moses met is in the building tonight so that you can have a conference with him say that you met him for yourself it's not just for brother Joe it's not just for brother Rob it's not just for brother Joel it's for everyone here tonight so Moses knew that God he knew God by intellects he understood him by intellects but there was something that was placed on the inside of Moses that seed that was born in him he was laying there in his heart and even though he tried with an intellectual experience with the word to bring them out to deliver them because he knowed that he was born for that promise or for that purpose and I want you to know that all the schools of our Theology and all the intellects can never be able to improve or never produce that power to get you out of the mess that you're in but the god that met Moses in a burning bush has the ability to get you out you see Israel needed Deliverance but Moses couldn't do it on his own on his own you need help but you can't do it on your own you know you've tried but you can't do it on your own but there is a faithful father Hallelujah they couldn't be delivered upon their own intellectual conceptions they needed a deliverer and they needed somebody that had met a mighty Angel that's why we needed more than just a school theology to get us out of the chaos that we were in that's why we needed a prophet messenger that had personally met the mighty Angel for himself you see Moses had that great call upon his life and he was basing it upon all that he knew until one day he found out that it was for him you see what it was all of the intellects was laying there but then the anointing came upon his intellects and it anointed what he had on the inside of him so you see your intellects are all right as long as the anointing comes upon it but your intellects as long as it ain't got no anointing on it it ain't worth nothing more than a piece of paper Hallelujah but you recognize that tonight that William Branham told us that the pillar of fire has what you lack so that pillar Fire come whirling Out of Heaven Come whirling out of heaven and came down upon that bush Dropped Out of Heaven came down upon that bush what was it it was God he was attracting the attention of his Prophet to show him that it was time for their attention to be drawn to Israel that their eyes needed not to be upon Egypt but their eyes needed to be upon God and his promise to be honest young people we sometimes we get into a spot when we focus ourselves so much upon the problems that we're facing and the current world crisis or the demographic that we're in and the thermometer of the world that we're in but God is doing these things he's sowing the supernatural he's showing us a supernatural to get our attention upon him you see if the pillar of fire would show up in this building tonight and I believe that it's here it is only doing that to get your attention you see brother Madam said that he was simply trying to attract the attention of Moses he said and you know he said how today the church is in bondage of sickness and he said the church is crying and been crying for years for deliverance you see and the devil will try to tell you that there is no help for you and there is no relief for you that there's no way out of your problem but I want to assure to you young people tonight that the devil would like to implant in your mind that that you are his and there's no way out of the problem and that he's got a claim on you but I want to tell you that is a lie straight from the pits of hell because the Bible tells us that you are of God little children and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now if there's a spirit that is a spirit of fear that is afflicting your life God didn't put that on you if it's a spirit of chaos or a spirit of unsetterness or a spirit of bitterness God didn't put that upon you you know the Bible tells us in second Timothy 1 and 7 that God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind so God wants you here tonight in a sound mind upon his word the Bible says in Psalms 82 and 6 that you are gods and all of you are the children of the most high God look at your neighbor say I'm a child of the most high God but Satan would like to whisper in your ear over and over again that you're his and there's no way out of the crisis that you're in but I want to tell you by the word of God that there is a way when there seems to be no way you know what it's like to be in a spot when you need help when you need help and you can't get yourself out of it you need somebody bigger than yourself to get you out of it you know that the devil would lie to you over and over and over again and I find that a lot of times young people have a better opportunity to quote Satan's lie what he said about them than what they're quoting about God's word now we know that that there's over 8 800 promises in the Bible and I want you to know that over 8 800 times God never lied but nine times in the Bible the devil made promises and I want you to know that the devil never kept any of his promises the devil if he's whispering in your ear it's alive if he's telling you you're not good enough it's a lie if he tells you that healing isn't coming for you it's a lie if he's telling you that you can't get out of your trouble it's a lie if he tells you you're not good enough it's a lie if he tells you you're not qualified it's a lie if he tells you you're not election it's a lie I'll tell you what kind of person I am I'm a positive and a negative kind of person so if the devil is telling me that I'm not good enough that means I am good enough if he tells me there is no help for me that means there is help for me if he tells me I can't get out of my crisis that means I'm already out young people I don't care where you are I don't care what family you came out of I don't care what problem you're going through there is nothing too big there is nothing too big for my God I've watched for the past three years my father facing brain cancer and lung cancer and I have witnessed the power of the Holy Spirit that my God is greater than cancer my God's bigger than brain bleach not God's bigger than sugar diabetes you see remember the story when brother Brandon would talk about that man that came to Lincoln that he came up there that his friend had been put in prison for something that he didn't mean to do and he got himself in jail and he got himself before the firing squad but there was a faithful friend that went to the president or the land and he and it was talking to him he said look Mr President you had the power to release him or you have the power to kill him and he'd give him the pardon but the man went back to the prison cell he went back there gave him the piece of slip that Abraham Lincoln signed but what did the man do in the prison cell he refused the pardon there's a way out of your chaos there's a way out of your situation there's a way out of your depression there's a way out of it but you've got to accept what God has put before you you see a pardon is only a part and if you accept it as a pardon you see he had the power to release him and there is one in the building right now that has the power to release you from Every Chain of every complex of every sickness when you cry yourself to sleep he hurt you when you're asking for a breakthrough he heard you when you are asking for the Holy Ghost he heard you when you thought you weren't good enough he heard you don't you listen to the devil's life because brother Bynum told us in a church age book he said to listen or believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan don't listen to his lie it don't matter whether you hear me now or whether you hear this 10 years from now don't listen to The Devil's lie you were never his child hell was not made for you hell was built for him and his angels but you're not a child of Satan you're the child of the most high God you see you see I understand what the battles that you go through as young people I'm not too I'm 35 years old my wife told me when I turned 30 that I had to finally grow up I turned her down I understand what it's like facing the pressures of the age that you're in and I'm about 17 years past graduation and we recognize that every generation gets ten thousand or ten times worse so I can't even imagine what you're facing in the world that you're in but I want to Turn Your Eyes Upon the word of God you've not been given a vision to look at upon the world and see things as though they are not you've been given an Eagle Eye Vision to be able to look at the word of God and see the word of God as your preeminence in this life you see you see brother Brandon preached a very powerful message on the message look and if you go in there brother random starts talking about those binoculars how that you've got to learn to focus those binoculars he said at one time he said somebody was telling me to look out there at those lines or those antelopes and he said I was looking out there and he said I seen three he said but I knew it was one he said but what I had to do he said I had to focus it down I had to get my vision correct with what was out there and a lot of times Satan will try to blur up your vision to get you construed misconstrued on what you are to be seen you're not supposed to be seeing three Gods you're supposed to be seeing one God you're not supposed to be looking at something as seeing that you can't get out of it I want to say this to you there is nothing too big for my God Erica Parker's situation is not big enough to roll God's eyes and say well I just ain't got enough power to do it he's got enough power to do it and I happen to believe that he's more than able to do it because I've got my eyes turned the other day uh the other day I was getting out of the shower and I put my glasses on and I thought dear Lord I'm going blind I couldn't see anything everything was blurry I thought I can't read nothing something's going on but the big dummy right here forgot to have my contacts in so everything was double blurred I couldn't see things I wasn't focusing right and if you've got a filter over top of the word of God you won't be able to see the word of God correctly you see Moses had got to a spot that he had to turn his Focus away from what Pharaoh was telling him Pharaoh had the ability they looked out the same window Pharaoh only seen slaves and mud daubers but Moses looked out there and he'd seen Children of the promise what did he do he focused himself away from the lust of the world and the pride of the life and the beauty and the power of Egypt and he had those potentials laying on the inside of him Pharaoh didn't have those potentials there but Moses had the potentials to be able to focus it down to see what God was saying you ever looked at a problem and you looked at it in your eyes and then you turned it and looked it from God's point of view if you look at it from your house you're always going to say well I'm not I'm not able to get it I I'm not going to be able to have my breakthrough like this person had their breakthrough but if you look at it in the word of God you'll be able to see that it's for every one of you that whosoever the world the Lord will call it's for you so Moses simply he turned and he refused to see he refused to focus on the things of the world what was Moses doing he was taking his faith in the word of God and that's what faith is it's designed to see what God wills and God wants you see that's what your faith will do here tonight it's designed to see what God wants for you and the faith that is in you will focus you right to the word of God I can't imagine 400 years walking past Joseph's bones being beat being whipped but I got a promise land right here that were coming out of here I can't imagine a young people saying it's not for me when we've got the word laying right here I can't imagine what it was like to be beat day in and day out making bricks for somebody else but God had a promise you're coming out of here it might look like you are never going to get out of the spot that you are in but remember when the prophet was up there on Hurricane Mountain and he thought he was good enough to get himself out of their mess that he got himself in he thought I've got it in my nature I can get out of here but it finally got to a spot when he was on that Indian death walk that he realized that he didn't have the ability to get back down the mountain to where his what he truly loved his wife and his son down there he didn't have the human abilities to get himself down off of that mountain and go back there but he heard these words of Psalms 46 that God is our refuge a very present help in a time of trouble and you remember the story when William branham's up there and he sees there's a hand that touches him lays his hand on his shoulder and tells him look back there and he sees the point that he needs to be walking but what was he doing he had his hands up looking for a Lifeline looking for that line that he'd put up those years before let me tell you young people keep your hand up lift up those hands at once hung low lift up those hands keep your hands up brother random said one time I thought I grabbed it thought I grabbed it and I I began to shout about it he said but I found out it was just a twig or a branch but he kept his hands up and finally when his hand Struck it it was a sure fact that he was going to the spot that he loved and if you can find your name in the word of God you're going you're not saying on that mountain you've circled the mountain long enough you've been in depression long enough you've been in anxiety long enough you've listened to the world long enough get your hands up get your hands up God's heard your cry he's heard you cry when Zacharias was a priest and he walked into the house of God time after time he walked in there and he was offering incense when him and his wife had prayed year after year about having a baby but finally one day he walked into the house of God when he was offering incense unto the Lord and Gabriel said these words I have heard your prayer I have heard your prayer and William Branham told us he said if you want an angel appear to you get your life right get your heart right he said and God will hear your prayer and the angels will come if you've got the right atmosphere I'm on my own in this journey no you're not look at these brothers they would not have had this meeting if it was just for themselves they had it for you you are not alone you're not in the midst of a trial all alone there is one that sticketh closer than a brother brother Bynum said just walk unconscious of fear he said walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious under the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right hand or the left he said just keep moving on something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah his sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep on Walking with God he said Enoch one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home he walked with God so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore Walk Of God doctor says you're going to die walk with God doctor says you can't walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised you I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you and to the end of the world he took an oath by the Covenant that he give you that he would confirm and just walk with God you're going to have your ups and downs don't you worry you go to the third you're going to go through Briar patches and over shop rocks over Bluffs down over the hillsides up to the mountains over Waters but walk with God what am I supposed to do brother Andrew walk with God just walk with God when Abraham was up on Mount Moriah and he was up there with his Isaac what was he doing he was walking with God surely if he can trust him in his 100 Year age to make him new again surely he can give him Isaac back again and when Isaac and Abraham was found faithful God provided for them a sacrifice to get themselves out but Abraham didn't have some intellectual Faith he had a genuine faith he'd already seen what God could do laughs I've already seen God feel young people of the Holy Ghost so I know he's going to do it again this weekend I've already seen our God deliver young girls out of all kinds of chaos of spirits so I know he'll do it again this weekend already know that God heals the sick so I know he'll do it again this weekend I know God listens to his promises and he remembers them and he cast out the devil so I know he'll do it again this weekend you don't have an intellectual Faith or you would be in the building you know what intellectual faith is and I'll tell you what it is it's a discount of Faith it's a faith that only gets you so far and you don't want discounted Faith you want the real genuine faith you feel the atmosphere in the room don't you you recognize it it's been set by your worship and by you Amen in the word of God but there's coming a time on Monday morning when you don't feel this atmosphere and you're going to have to walk with God you better hope that you have a genuine Faith because an intellectual faith will let you down intellectual faith is like buying something down to the Dollar Tree you know good and well it's going to let you down at some time is that right you buy yourself you buy yourself a car at the Dollar Tree it's going to leave you on the road sitting somewhere but if you're fired be careful here but if you find yourself a real genuine Ford at the Ford dealership he won't leave you Hank and I know they say that it's found on the roadside sitting dead but if you buy it down at the Dollar Tree it's going to leave you sitting somewhere hey if the prophet had it for it I guess it's all right for me to have afford sorry for you Chevrolet fans I guess you got your own heartbeat help me Jesus Genie a genuine Faith Ain't Gonna Let You Down but an intellectual faith will let you down you'll see if Abraham was dealing with intellectual faith he would have got up there brother Randall said he would have got up there and that intellectual Faith would have went to work and Satan would have said now what's Sarah going to say about this if you commit Isaac to that Altar and you slay him what's Sarah going to say about this but he didn't listen to his intellectual Faith he listened to what God Said and when he listened to what God Said God provided his way out let me tell you young people God has already provided on the cross 2 000 years ago a way for you to go free a way to get out of depression a way to get out of suicide a way to get out of your chaos you remember when William Branham you remember when William Branham is in his early Ministry and he has a vision he has a vision of a sheep caught in a Thicket and he and he kept hearing this this sheep hollering hollering and crying for help and brother Brandon said I was going through those Briar patches trying to find my way find my way to and he said I heard that sheep behind you buying for it and he said I finally found it and he said when I got there it was crying Middletown Middletown brother Burnham didn't know anything about Milltown or of where it was or anything about it so he presented it to his church and he went up there went up to Milltown and you know that brother Branham was holding a Revival up there just trying to find where where the will of the Lord was and he began to hold a Revival and those things and he he's up there and he's just he's preaching away and while he's preaching there they begin to tell him that there's a little girl by the name of Georgie Carter that had been laying in the bed for nine years nine years and so many days dealing with tuberculosis all over throughout her body and there but the random goes up and he begins to pray for her begins to go up there and see her and she said I heard your story or I heard the story about the nailed little girl I heard that story you see faith comes by hearing and she said what brother back let have a vision for me do the same thing that you did for her he said I can't do that he said the Lord just did that for her he said that little nail girl was eat up with arthritis couldn't hardly move got up out of the wheelchair and went back completely normal Georgie Carter was laying in this condition and you know the story you've heard it over and over again but she was laying there because of a condition where her uncle took and abused the situation and because of that situation of him mishandling a situation he went in there I noticed immediately what happened because of that condition or that emotional uh thing that happened immediately tuberculosis is attached to her spirit and destroys her body Georgie Carter is ringing her wrist out upon those bed posts ringing out in pain she's ringing out in pain going through the motions trying to get help but she finds faith in a man of God and said I if he could do it for her the Lord Our God can do it for me the Bantam said he just prayed for and let it go and as it was he said I didn't see no vision that said but they had been taught by the current denomination that they were under that God didn't do those things no more I'm afraid that too many times that people have the belief that God doesn't do those things no more I'm not just talking about natural things of your body but I believe there's a lot of people that God don't give out the Holy Ghost no more there's a lot of people that believe that that she that we shouldn't we shouldn't preach emotion that we shouldn't preach all of these things and they say well that's not for our church or it's or we're past those days just preach us the word I believe that if it's in the word of God no matter if it's from Genesis or Revelation then we ought to preach it if healing is in the body then we ought to preach it if there's gifts in the body then we ought to preach it if there's a power of the Holy Ghost you ought to preach it had a God one time tell me he said well all you are is a holy ghost preacher so what else you want me to do what else you want me to do that's what I'm here to do this weekend it's preach the Holy Ghost I can't get you out of your trouble I can't help you 10 days from now but the Holy Ghost can and something may have happened to you not as bad as Georgia Carter but all of a sudden a complex can attach itself to your spirit and because of it it eats at your body it eats at your mind but God has heard your cry for help Georgie he's heard you he's heard your little lamb he's heard you crying he's heard you weeping he's heard you asking Georgie he's heard you crying he's heard you in your trial you ain't got some discounted faith what happened he worked his way through those Briars until he found the lamb what happened when William Brandon was up there praying and seeking the Lord them Briars were hitting him in his face trying to get him distracted from prayer but all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord come whirling over top of those mountains said go by the way of the corridors what was about to happen it was something in the natural that was getting ready to happen but I believe that it's for the spiritual tonight you may have been laying in your condition for nine years nine years you may have been laying there how long how much longer are you going to lay there how much longer are you going to cry yourself to sleep how much longer are you going to ask for your breakthrough but we're here to break some barriers down this weekend we are here to tear down every stronghold that the enemy has tried to attach to you you know what you know that if that plane if he can ever get to a spot that he can pass on past that sound barrier that it begins to move into another realm that it's never built before that it's never been before and you might struggle after struggle after struggle but keep struggling I've been through it over and over again go again press on keep struggling keep struggling because when you press through that barrier you're going to fly like you never flew before it's an unlimited speed when you can break through there and when you can break through your sin barrier young people when you can break through well necessarily what is sin it's unbelief in God's word I'm not saying you've got certain things in your life but sin any type of unbelief is sin against God's word if something comes in and you say well I don't know that's immediately where you sinned right there why well why didn't he do it for this that's where you sin right there it wasn't when you started drinking alcohol you sinned when you disbelieved God's word but if you can break past that sin break past that doubt break past those things you're going to break forth in an unlimited Revival Hallelujah if you can ever get past that sin barrier if you can ever get past it can I prophesy God's going to use these young people he's going to use a mouth of these young people to break cancer he's going to use the mouth of these young people to break doubt and break sin and break change and break circumstance he's going to use the mouth of these young people like the Bible said in Deuteronomy 30 and 14 the word of God is now thee even in thy mouth that thou mayst do it somebody is going to do what Revelations 10 8 says go and take the book and eat the book there's going to be a young boy or a young girl that rise up and said I'm sick and tired of the devil winning if you give up now you're gonna always give up if you always you're never going to win a surrender you keep surrendering to the devil you're never going to win the battle but if you said I'm here to win I'm here to press on I'm here to press the battle I'm here for the Holy Ghost I'm here for healing I'm here for my church I'm here for my breakthrough well the random was one time dealing with a lady that had colon trouble and she said he said he said now you're sitting there wondering when is it your time he said your time is right now I want to say to you young people your time is right now the time is at hand the time to break through is right now the time to overcome is right now don't you go down in defeat don't you walk away from this meeting going down in defeat you are here to win because the Bible said as a man thinketh in his heart so is he I was born a winner because I was born by the Breath of God I was born and Overcomer because God made me what I am I was born to be a devil Destroyer because God made me that way I was born to be a shouter because God made me that way I was born to be a dancer because God made me that way don't you back off when the devil tells you that you shouldn't do things that way God made you that way if God wanted you that way then you ought to be that way it's for you this is your time brother Brandon told us in the message power of God a very powerful message man y'all good group to preach to another man preached a very powerful message in 1955 he preaches he preaches on the power of the devil the power of God and then the power of decision very powerful powerful messages go listen to him and brother Bynum says there in the power of God he said Satan's power is limited so he's like a dog on a chain he can only go so far he can only go so far he can only hear that he can only hinder your walk so far he can only torment your mind so far his power is limited but brother random said directly after that he said but face power brings to pass God's revealed Revelation so faith says I'm more than able to do it I am persuaded that I'm a mighty conqueror [Music] my goodness y'all y'all y'all y'all good people to preach to y'all enjoy the word of God don't you why are you enjoying it because it's your opportunity it's your chance let me tell you William Brandon Brad William Branham had his opportunity he ran his race but it's your turn brother Madam said that each generation has their opportunity at the fresh word of God it's our opportunity brother Branham said brother Burnham said in bless him prophet he said I look out there and I see all of my missed opportunities and you think my I missed my opportunity last Wednesday or last weekend let me tell you if William Bynum missed opportunities you're going to miss opportunities but the thing is is to learn from your mistakes think about this opportunity that you've been given right now you don't see it but there's another world in this room you don't see it but there's power that is moving through this room there's Deliverance moving through this woman there's a breakthrough in this room there's healing in this room there's relief in this room it's time you start letting off the pressure and you find yourself running to a rock that is higher than yourself you remember when William Branham and I'm closing but you remember when William Branham he he one time he goes to it goes to a spot in a psychiatric ward and he and he's he's working the room and he's and there's all those cases that are laying there and he he just simply saying to the brother that's with him he said where do we start at where do we start at all of these cases where do we start he said there was people sitting there in straight jackets and people that were beating their heads and all of these things he said where do we start at and there was a there was a little girl that was sitting there and said why don't you start with me and he said surely you're not a patient she said oh yes I am and she began to tell brother Brandon her story about where things went in her life and how she how she once was a good girl and how she how she once was raised right in all of these things but she got out with the wrong boy one time and it took her down a dark Road you got to watch your friends young people because if your friends aren't leading you to the lord they're not your friends if your friends aren't bringing you closer to an atmosphere like you feel tonight then you need to ditch your friends God will give you new ones you know that was one thing that I I wondered about when I when I gave my heart to the Lord how in the world am I going to get rid of them old friends let me tell you I didn't have no problem getting rid of them they got rid of me they didn't want to hear about the message they didn't want to hear about the gospel they wanted their own things I didn't have to worry about getting rid of them they got rid of me foreign she was raised in her right home did right things but she got around the wrong crowd one time you know brother Brandon said that's what happened to Legion he got out and he started playing cards with the wrong people had a nice family had had about three or four different children back home and the devil took him and put him in a cave chained him up there put him under chains of circumstance and every time he'd start to come back to his right mind he'd start beating himself again it's so easy to get under the enticements of the devil he's only wanting you to smoke one cigarette or take one drink or listen to the wrong piece of rock and roll one time and he's got you and then all of a sudden he's going to call and make you feel like you're not good enough as soon as you do it he's going to make you feel like you're not worthy enough for this gospel and this girl starts telling brother Branham her story of Where She Went she went from this house she she went to this Association she went to this church she went from she went from the Protestant church to the Catholic Church she went from here and went to there and I start to come to myself and finally I I ended up here I ended up in this condition I was a good girl let me tell you young people I grew up in one of the greatest homes that you ever could have been reared in but I still needed to meet the God of this Bible listen to The Prophet every day brother McGrady I listened to it I heard it every day it wasn't because my daddy didn't do the right things in front of me I was born a sinner and I was shaped in iniquity I came to this world speaking lies and I needed my own experience but something on the inside of me was crying for help and one day I found him walking on the streets I dropped and surrendered my life to the Lord and I never went back to that world no more it don't have to be in church but it's a fine place to get it it don't have to be necessarily around Believers but it's a fine place to get it I got it on the streets in Canada so if you can get it in the streets you can surely get in a church building you can surely find the god of Abraham right here tonight but God of Moses is in this room why don't you say start with me Lord start with me Lord and she began to pray she said why don't you pray while I go around to these other ones and you think well the Lord seems like he's dealing here and he starts working the room somewhere else and this girl is over there and she comes on brother Bynum comes back to her said he said now look she said I believe I'm going to go out there and I'm sure going to try he said no you've done that before a lot of times people get the idea of just going to the altar and that's good enough but you've been here before but it's time to go past that I'm a Believer in altar cause I'm a Believer in it but the experience of this altar has got to get you out of the chaos that you're in it's more than a preacher's hands it's more than a preacher's words but there is a power I believe that tonight that we're setting before the greatest power that there is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she'd been here before she'd been at this spot before she prayed through before and she tried before but it failed her but finally when she got down brother Brandon began to talk to her he began to talk to her I said don't you don't you ever want to be married she said what could I offer what could I offer to a husband he said you can offer your soul to Jesus Christ he said I love this he said he can take you back to your innocency he can take you back before you did the wrong he said he has the ability to take you back to your urgency he said the blood is sufficient this girl had tried everything else she looked at everything else she tried Religion she tried church but it didn't help her but what she needed was an experience and finally she got down there when Brethren prayed with her finally there came a breakthrough finally there came what she was asking for I want you to know that what you've been crying for is in the room what you've been asking for is in this room your breakthrough is in this room don't you limit God tonight but let's let the chains off take the limits off Focus your eyes to the word of God say God I'm here for you I know you're here for me I know you want my life I know you want my spirit I know you want my soul God start with me start with me won't you let God take you back to the place before you ever did wrong he said well I'm going to need I'm going to need some scripture for that I want to tell you that God knows how about how to roll back the time in your life when Hezekiah was in his condition and he began to cry out and begin to turn his face towards the wall and begin to plea before God and the prophet told him to prepare to die the prophet had to come back because of his prayer and Hezekiah asked for a son and God rolled back the Sundial upon his he turned back the time it's a sign to you young people before you ever got into trouble before you got into sickness Our God has the ability to restore and roll back the time you said well you don't know my story I don't need to know your story I know his story and his blood is sufficient his holy ghost has the ability to roll back scars and complexes and sickness and change the blood is more than April let the musicians come why don't you have your fresh chance at the word of God once you have your opportunity right now where you are why don't you say God I'm not leaving here the same way I came in here Lazarus was in a worse condition than any of you they're right here in bad condition I'll be honest I didn't walk in here tonight the first thing I seen was a bunch of corpses I didn't come to preach to the Living Dead tonight I didn't see no corpse here Lazarus was in a bad spot but his sister said these powerful words even now Lord even now you know what lazarus's name means without help without help from Jesus he wouldn't get it out of that tomb without help he wasn't coming out from where he was he was enjoying life where he was but because the helper was in the room you might be without help but our lord is

time I was I was at a meeting quite like this I was in a meeting quite like this and there was a young sister to come up to me she began to pour out her heart where some things were in her current life that she was in the spirit of the Lord Dropped In My Heart to say these words you've not lost your salvation sis you've just lost the joy of it and when I when I spoke those words sometimes you say things you don't even realize what you're saying when I spoke those words it had the ability to set her free she took off running and laughing in the spirit because she recognized she hadn't lost her salvation she just lost the joy of it and a lot of times this world has a way of crippling our faith to steal our joy you ain't lost your salvation you just lost the joy of it if I was you I'd say God I'm coming back to get my joy back I'm coming to get everything that the devil stole from me back from it this weekend this opportunity I come to get back with the Lord was rightfully given to me
