[12:06] mentally,
[12:07] Lord, Lord Jesus, there's no way that we
[12:10] could ever thank you enough or praise
[12:12] you enough, Father. And not only that,
[12:14] Lord Jesus, but that helps us to have
[12:17] faith for these needs today, Father.
[12:20] You're the same yesterday, today, and
[12:22] forever, Lord. and what you did for us
[12:24] back then. Lord, we're here to receive
[12:27] again, Father. We come with
[12:29] expectations, knowing, Father, that you
[12:32] love us so much that all you want us to
[12:34] do is ask, Lord. So, Lord Jesus, in
[12:38] behalf of these requests that were
[12:40] written, Lord, and and those, Lord
[12:42] Jesus, on the people's hearts, Father,
[12:44] we bring them before your throne boldly,
[12:46] Lord. We're not shy, Lord, when it comes

[12:55] that you would just move according to
[12:56] your will and your purpose, Lord, in

[14:14] Let's sing this little course or this
[14:15] song to him. When the reason that I'm
[14:17] standing stands in front of me. Amen.
[14:19] Let's sing that as the brothers would
[14:21] come receive the morning tithe and
[14:22] offering at this
[14:25] time. When the reason that I'm
[14:29] standing stands in front of me.
[14:34] When every battle that I fall will fade
[14:38] from
[14:41] me, I'll bow before his mighty throne
[14:46] and fall down on my
[14:50] knees. When the reason that I'm
[14:54] [Applause]
[14:56] standing stands in front of
[15:04] me. Oh, I have stood for the gospel when
[15:09] it seemed I stood
[15:12] alone through the heartache and
[15:15] frustration and kept my focus on the
[15:19] throne. So many times I have recalled
[15:23] the Savior's word so
[15:26] true. If you won't be ashamed of me, I
[15:32] won't be of you. And so I'll
[15:36] proudly stand until I
[15:40] see. Oh, the face of the one who gave
[15:46] everything for
[15:49] me. When the reason that I'm
[15:54] standing stands in front of me.
[15:58] Every battle that I fall, fade from
[16:05] memory. Oh, I'll bow before his mighty
[16:09] throne and fall down on my knees.
[16:16] When the reason that I'm
[16:21] standing stands in front of
[16:28] me. Oh, the road has not been
[16:33] easy. And at times I've lost my way. So
[16:38] often I've stumbled, searching for the
[16:42] light of day.
[16:45] circumstances all around me. I thought
[16:49] I'd surely
[16:50] fall in the whispering of doubt and
[16:54] fear. Told me you would lose it all, but
[16:59] he kept me with his amazing
[17:05] grace. And someday soon, I'll have the
[17:09] chance to thank him face to face.
[17:15] When the reason that I'm
[17:17] [Applause]
[17:18] standing stands in front of
[17:21] me and every battle that I fall, fade
[17:27] from
[17:30] me. I'll bow before his mighty throne.
[17:35] Fall down on my knees.
[17:40] When the reason that I'm
[17:45] standing stands in front of
[17:49] me. Oh yes, we will join the millions.
[17:54] Every kindred tongue and
[17:57] raise and every child of God that day
[18:02] will look upon his
[18:06] face with the heroes and the martyrs who
[18:10] died on the pagan soul.
[18:15] [Music]
[18:16] We'll all stand
[18:18] together and
[18:21] declare Jesus is
[18:28] Lord. Oh, and the reason that I'm
[18:33] standing stands in front of
[18:36] me. And every battle that I fall fade
[18:41] from memory.
[18:45] Oh, and I'll bow before his mighty
[18:48] throne and fall down on my
[18:53] knees. Oh, and the reason that I'm
[18:59] standing, stands in front of
[19:07] me. Amen. What a day that's going to be.
[19:10] Amen. Let's sing this little course.
[19:13] When we all get to heaven, KFC, let's
[19:15] sing that as brother Jeremy comes
[19:17] preparing to sing for us. Uh then Sister
[19:19] Rosie Lindsay has a song for us. Amen.

[19:44] grace in the manions bright and blessed.
[19:51] He'll prepare for us a
[19:54] place. Oh, when we
[19:57] all get to
[20:00] heaven. What a day of rejoicing that
[20:05] we when we
[20:08] all see
[20:11] Jesus, we'll sing and shout the
[20:17] victory. Oh, while we walk the pilgrim
[20:23] pathway, clouds will over spread the
[20:28] skies. Oh, but when traveling days are
[20:34] over, not a shadow, not a
[20:38] s. Oh, when we
[20:42] all get to
[20:44] heaven. What a day of rejoicing that

[21:01] victory. Oh, when we
[21:04] all get to
[21:07] heaven. What a day of rejoicing that
[21:11] will

[21:18] Jesus, we'll sing and shout the
[21:25] victory. Amen. You can be seated this
[21:27] morning. Give our singers a nice
[21:34] hand. If I could say a few things before
[21:37] I sing. Um Wendy's aunt
[21:41] uh has a handicapped child that's in his
[21:45] 30s and he just got diagnosed with
[21:46] terminal cancer a few months ago. And
[21:49] then this week her husband got diagnosed
[21:52] with cancer. And our hearts are heavy
[21:55] today. And I know there's a bunch of
[21:56] people in here that's praying people and
[21:59] I have confidence in you and I would ask
[22:01] you that you would hold that family up
[22:03] in prayer because they are devastated.
[22:05] You can imagine having your child there.
[22:07] it's handicapped in the home and finding
[22:09] out your husband has spots on the brain
[22:12] and and big tumor on his spine. What
[22:15] that could do to your I just don't even
[22:18] know what how I could even handle it to
[22:19] be honest with you, but they need
[22:20] prayer. If you would pray for
[22:22] them. A few years ago, I had COVID and
[22:25] it done something to my heart and uh we
[22:28] was over at the old church and I come up
[22:30] for prayer and they told me I was going
[22:32] to have to have a pacemaker put in
[22:34] because it uh I'd fail and it blacked
[22:36] out when I had it and they told me I'd
[22:38] had a COVID heart heart attack when I
[22:40] was in ambulance. But I want to tell you
[22:44] about a man I went back to the doctor uh
[22:47] I think it was in February and they had
[22:49] to put me through stress test and done
[22:52] eco cardio. He just my doctor called me
[22:54] a few weeks ago and said everything's
[22:56] normal.
[22:59] That's my
[23:01] Jesus. I didn't want no pacemaker.
[23:05] [Music]
[23:27] I can't take a heart that's broken and
[23:32] make it
[23:35] over
[23:37] again. Oh, but I I know a

[28:46] night. Weary from the same old fight.
[28:52] [Music]
[28:55] Shattered pieces all
[29:00] [Music]
[29:02] around. Oh God, please hear me
[29:06] [Music]
[29:10] now. How much longer till the victory
[29:15] comes? And he whispers.
[29:20] He
[29:22] whispers, "I am the
[29:25] healer when you need a
[29:29] touch. I am the
[29:33] mener when life comes
[29:38] undone." That's a
[29:41] promise. So don't give up.
[29:45] The deeper the
[29:48] pain, the stronger the
[29:52] love. Child, I
[29:56] know. Yes, I
[29:59] know how much broken is enough.
[30:06] [Music]
[30:11] So I'm holding to this thread of
[30:17] hope and I'll be still and
[30:25] know that God knows me inside
[30:33] out. So why should I doubt now?
[30:38] [Music]
[30:41] I'm going to trust the one who knows my
[30:46] heart. And he tells
[30:49] me, oh, he tells
[30:53] me, I am the
[30:56] healer when you need a touch.
[31:01] I am the
[31:03] mener when life comes
[31:08] undone. That's a
[31:11] promise. So don't give
[31:15] up. The deeper the
[31:18] pain, the stronger the
[31:22] love. Tell I know.
[31:27] Yes, I know how much broken is
[31:37] [Music]
[31:40] enough. He is tolerance the
[31:45] listening
[31:47] listening. I am listening. Though he's
[31:52] speaking,
[32:00] speaking. I am the
[32:03] healer when you need a
[32:07] touch. I am the
[32:11] mener when life comes
[32:16] undone. That's a promise.
[32:20] So don't give
[32:22] up. The deeper the
[32:25] pain, the stronger the
[32:29] love. Child, I
[32:33] know. Yes, I
[32:37] know. Child, I
[32:40] know. Yes, I
[32:47] know. How much broken
[32:51] is enough?
[32:59] [Music]
[33:01] [Applause]
[33:12] Um, maybe sometimes songs don't relate
[33:15] to you too much or different songs, but
[33:17] everybody can sing this little chorus
[33:18] this morning, even the little children.
[33:20] Yes, Jesus loves me. Let's sing this
[33:23] this
[33:26] morning. Oh
[33:29] yes,
[33:30] Jesus loves me.
[33:35] Yes,
[33:37] Jesus loves
[33:41] me.
[33:43] Yes,
[33:45] Jesus loves
[33:47] me. The
[33:50] Bible tells me so. You can sing it
[33:54] louder than that. Oh
[33:57] yes,
[33:59] Jesus loves me.
[34:02] [Music]
[34:05] Yes,
[34:06] Jesus loves
[34:10] me.
[34:12] Yes,
[34:14] Jesus loves
[34:16] me. The
[34:19] Bible tells me so. Sing it one more time
[34:23] this morning. Oh
[34:26] yes,
[34:28] Jesus loves me.
[34:32] [Music]
[34:34] Yes,
[34:35] Jesus loves
[34:39] me.
[34:41] Yes,
[34:43] Jesus loves
[34:45] me. The
[34:48] Bible tells me
[34:52] so. You appreciate our youth choir this
[34:55] morning. Give them a hand.
[35:17] [Music]
[35:25] There are two roads.
[35:29] You may
[35:30] [Music]
[35:32] take one by
[35:36] side and one by
[35:40] faith. Take the word of
[35:44] God. What do you
[35:46] [Music]
[35:48] see? What you
[35:52] believe is what will be.
[35:57] your
[35:59] wings to the wind of
[36:04] pain. You can
[36:07] fly in a higher
[36:12] place. Do not
[36:15] struggle is by
[36:18] [Music]
[36:19] grace. Send your
[36:23] wings to the winds of faith.
[36:28] What's your
[36:31] need? What's your
[36:35] cry? What's your
[36:38] mountain that's much too
[36:41] [Music]
[36:43] high? Speak the word of
[36:46] God and by and
[36:50] by it will
[36:52] [Music]
[36:54] move. For you will
[36:58] fly your
[37:01] wings to the wind
[37:06] of
[37:09] you in a higher way.
[37:17] [Music]
[37:22] Send your
[37:24] wings to the winds of fame.
[37:27] [Music]
[37:29] Watch the
[37:32] eagle in the
[37:35] sky. He does not
[37:39] struggle. He does not
[37:43] strive for the
[37:46] power that makes him right.
[37:52] is
[37:55] already in the
[37:58] sky. Set your
[38:01] wings to the
[38:06] wind. You can
[38:09] fly in a higher place.
[38:14] You're
[38:17] not my
[38:21] [Music]
[38:37] You can
[38:39] fly in a higher place.
[38:44] [Music]
[38:55] to the winds of
[38:57] [Applause]
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] pain.
[39:00] Do not
[39:04] struggle is by
[39:08] grace send your
[39:12] wings to the winds of faith.
[39:19] [Music]
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:43] I'm sure it's hard for our minds to
[39:45] comprehend what it will be that day when
[39:48] all the saints of
[39:50] God down to the ages will gather
[39:53] together and
[39:56] stand. Millions and millions of
[40:00] people that have been redeemed by the
[40:03] grace of the Lord
[40:05] Jesus. No more pain, no more
[40:08] sickness, no more anxiety.
[40:11] There probably isn't hardly any people
[40:14] that have come today out of all the
[40:16] hundreds of people that are here and the
[40:18] thousands that'll be streaming around
[40:20] the world that don't have a burden on
[40:22] your heart, a worry, a trouble. You're
[40:26] anxious about something and concerned
[40:30] about something. You got a text, phone
[40:32] call, an email before church and you was
[40:35] in such a wonderful frame of mind and
[40:38] you read that text and it just did
[40:40] something to you on the
[40:42] inside. Maybe you got to church and you
[40:44] saw somebody that was troubled or sick.
[40:48] Carol and I pulled up around the parking
[40:51] lot there and to drop her off and I saw
[40:54] one of the sisters come into the church
[40:57] there and I saw her kind of crippling a
[41:00] little bit and trying to walk. It just
[41:03] made me feel so so troubled for her and
[41:07] sad. Why? Because we love one another.
[41:10] Amen. Aren't you glad there's a world
[41:13] where there is no more crippling, no
[41:15] more pain, no more trouble, no more
[41:19] anxiety? I don't know how you look at
[41:21] it, but to me, whatever I have to go
[41:23] through and whatever my life has to be
[41:26] tested by to get me ready for that
[41:29] world, I say, "Bring it on, Lord." And
[41:33] he'll bring it on in the right
[41:34] proportion. Amen. We greet you today in
[41:37] the name of the Lord Jesus. And it's an
[41:39] honor for us to be together in it once
[41:41] again in the house of
[41:42] God. Let's read second Peter if you
[41:45] would again
[41:48] today. The stature of a perfect man or
[41:52] woman is contained in these verses of
[41:57] scripture. It's so simple yet so
[42:01] profound.
[42:02] There's very few things in life that you
[42:05] and I deal with that are
[42:09] perfect. Your car, your truck, your
[42:12] house, your family, your church, your
[42:16] pastor, the deacon board, your job. On
[42:20] and on and on and on we could go. And
[42:24] how many things really do you and I deal
[42:27] with that are perfect? We're living in
[42:30] an imperfect world. It's flawed.
[42:33] But what I'm about to read to you today
[42:34] and share with you is scriptures that
[42:37] will bring us to an image of a perfect
[42:41] man and a perfect woman, which is a
[42:45] miracle within
[42:46] itself. Grace and peace be multiplied
[42:49] unto you through the knowledge of God
[42:52] and of Jesus our Lord, according as his
[42:56] divine power. And notice where it comes
[42:59] from. Not from us learning, not
[43:01] memorization of scriptures and quotes,
[43:04] but according as his divine power, hath
[43:07] given unto us all things that
[43:09] pertain unto life and
[43:13] godliness, through the knowledge of him
[43:16] that hath called us to glory and virtue,
[43:21] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[43:23] great and precious promises, that by
[43:27] these that by these these promises you
[43:30] might be partakers of the divine nature.
[43:34] Having escaped the corruption that is in
[43:37] the world through lust. And beside this,
[43:41] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[43:44] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[43:48] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[43:52] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[43:55] to godliness brotherly
[43:59] kindness, and to brotherly kindness, the
[44:03] capstone, the headstone of the entire
[44:06] building, the capping off of the church
[44:09] ages. is
[44:11] charity which is God's own love. I may
[44:15] like to be remembered today as we pray.
[44:18] Have a prayer call here today for Sister
[44:20] Linda Jablonsky and the need she has.
[44:23] Let's just take this before the
[44:25] Lord. Heavenly Father, we are so happy
[44:29] to be together today once again in your
[44:32] house. This is your house, Lord. It's
[44:36] dedicated to you for as long as we will
[44:38] need it. One day we know that Johnson
[44:42] City will become part of the rubble,
[44:45] part of the heap of ashes and
[44:48] destruction that will strike this
[44:51] nation. But Father, we're so glad that
[44:54] you have made a way of escape. You told
[44:57] us in your word in the book of Luke,
[44:59] pray ye therefore always that you may be
[45:01] accounted worthy to escape all these
[45:03] things that shall come to pass and stand
[45:06] before the son of man. So we pray today,
[45:10] Lord, may there not be a one of us that
[45:13] will be here when the sixth seal opens
[45:17] up overnight. It will be such a
[45:21] cataclysmic change upon the earth.
[45:24] It will be more than man can comprehend
[45:26] in their
[45:27] mind. Satan is in the background even
[45:30] this very morning while we are gathered
[45:33] together. Satan is getting his mechanics
[45:36] together. For he knows that when he's
[45:38] kicked out of heaven, he'll have it a
[45:40] very, very short
[45:41] time. So Lord, we pray may each of us
[45:45] make preparation.
[45:47] May there be none of our youth, none of
[45:50] our elders, none of us, Lord Jesus,
[45:53] that'll miss that precious, precious
[45:55] rapture. May we all be ready. You see
[45:59] this need today, Father, Sister Linda
[46:01] has, and we're asking you, Father God,
[46:03] for those that raise their hands, it
[46:06] signified something. Jesus, help them.
[46:09] Help me that I can be sensitive today to
[46:12] far the leading of the spirit of God. If
[46:14] there's a need that lays outside the
[46:16] confines of what I've studied, make me
[46:18] sensitive that I could go for a child of
[46:21] yours, a son or daughter, maybe no more
[46:24] than three or four words, something that
[46:26] would help them. That's what I'm here
[46:28] for today, Jesus, please help me. I
[46:31] pray, Father, we commit the service to
[46:34] you now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[46:38] you, saints. You may be seated.
[46:49] I'm not sure
[46:51] we still yet
[46:55] comprehend how God
[46:58] so
[46:59] resents
[47:01] pride and
[47:06] arrogance and being stuffed up in our
[47:10] self
[47:11] and feeling that there's something about
[47:15] us humanly that is superior to other
[47:18] people. Whether it be our rank in
[47:22] society, how much money we make, what
[47:25] kind of clothes we
[47:27] wear, we have brand labels and our
[47:30] shirts and our suits and on your
[47:33] sister's
[47:34] purses or if you have to go to Goodwill
[47:37] and pick them up secondhand.
[47:40] You see, pride was the very cause of
[47:44] Satan's fall in the
[47:46] beginning. It so transformed him from
[47:49] being an angel of light, day star, son
[47:55] of the morning. Lucifer was his
[47:57] name. And it's something that God never
[48:01] intended for the human race to ever deal
[48:04] with, but we all do one way or another.
[48:08] And there's probably people sitting here
[48:10] today that think that you don't have any
[48:12] pride whatsoever that you don't even
[48:14] deal with it. But you know, pride
[48:17] sometimes in the more deceitful ways are
[48:21] what brings so close to spiritual
[48:25] avenues and spiritual things about God.
[48:28] And people think they'd cast all that
[48:31] aside. You say, "What in the world has
[48:33] that got to do with the virtues?" pretty
[48:36] much
[48:37] everything. You see, there's something
[48:39] about us that once we're able to see
[48:42] what God has done and how God's
[48:44] illuminated us and helped us, then we
[48:48] have that constant challenge and balance
[48:51] in our life and what God has done and
[48:53] the favor that he's given us and helping
[48:56] us to stay little and small for the rest
[49:00] of our life in the gifts that he's
[49:03] trusted us with.
[49:05] And we've been looking about knowledge
[49:08] and how that God wants his children to
[49:11] be a partaker of divine knowledge,
[49:14] heaven-born knowledge, Holy Ghost
[49:16] knowledge. He called it several
[49:17] different things. And as we're at a
[49:20] season for several of our youth
[49:23] graduating from high school, and some of
[49:25] them going on to college, some being uh
[49:28] graduating from college. And if they
[49:31] ever needed an element of God's divine
[49:34] knowledge, they need it now for their
[49:38] lives. So which way do they go? What
[49:41] what do I choose? What's my vocation in
[49:44] life? Should I be a farmer? Should I be
[49:47] a painter? Should I be a plumber? Should
[49:50] I be this or that or the other? You
[49:53] sisters, you go to looking and thinking,
[49:55] "Well, what should I be? Should I go
[49:57] into business into secretary? Should I
[50:01] become this or that?" Then, of course,
[50:03] if you're not married, and you're
[50:05] thinking, "But Lord, I I need a
[50:07] boyfriend. I I need a girlfriend. And
[50:09] and I don't see anybody here in the
[50:11] church that I like, and there ain't
[50:13] nobody here good enough for me." And
[50:15] well, you really got a problem of pride,
[50:17] ain't you? So, you can see with all of
[50:20] these questions that the youth can have
[50:23] as well as us adults, we certainly need
[50:26] the knowledge of God about our lives.
[50:29] And then you get diagnosed as some type
[50:30] of horrible disease. And and then you're
[50:33] trying to find the knowledge of God for
[50:35] how do you approach it? Do you go by
[50:38] faith alone and say, you know what, I
[50:40] I'm not taking no treatment. I'm not I'm
[50:42] not taking no pain med. I'm not doing
[50:45] any of that sort of thing. I'm I'm
[50:47] looking by by faith alone. Well, that
[50:50] within itself is good except the prophet
[50:53] also told us that God gave us doctors
[50:55] and science and things like that to help
[50:58] us as well. How far do you go with it?
[51:01] Well, you don't always just need more
[51:03] faith because you believe God can do it,
[51:06] but sometimes it's more about the
[51:08] knowledge of God for your everyday life.
[51:11] just in being able to face life and to
[51:13] knowing which things to choose. Then
[51:16] when we come to our spiritual growth and
[51:19] the allotment that God's given to every
[51:21] one of us, wherever that is, we rank in
[51:23] different ranks of course and been able
[51:25] to find that place with God to where we
[51:28] never become arrogant and go to looking
[51:31] at ourselves and thinking how blessed we
[51:35] are. Now God wants us to acknowledge it,
[51:38] but God never wants us to tie the
[51:40] blessing of God to something that we are
[51:43] ourselves and that somehow it's
[51:46] meritorial that it's by our merits.
[51:48] Well, I prayed and I read my Bible a lot
[51:51] and I I've done this and I've done that
[51:53] and that's why God's giving me this. No,
[51:56] it's undeserving of all of us as far as
[51:58] it's the grace of God. Amen. So when
[52:01] Paul had this great visitation from the
[52:03] Lord and as far as writing it down in
[52:06] the scripture, this man went 14 years
[52:10] after that this experience had happened,
[52:12] which is quite phenomenal cuz God has a
[52:15] hard time trying to f find any man, any
[52:18] woman, much less a preacher that'll have
[52:20] an experience with him till he goes
[52:22] around telling everybody and their
[52:24] brother because he wants them to to know
[52:28] how much closer to God than they are and
[52:31] how much greater his experiences are
[52:33] with God and how much God talks to him
[52:37] so that he can make people around him
[52:39] feel less godly and less spiritual
[52:42] because God don't talk to them near as
[52:44] much as he does him. Now you see you may
[52:47] not define that as pride but God does.
[52:50] So no matter what God does for us and
[52:53] what gives us he gives us it's not
[52:55] because that any of us deserve it as far
[52:58] as deserving but Paul must have felt the
[53:01] release and the spirit of God and if you
[53:04] notice he doesn't place this in first
[53:07] Corinthians and second Corinthians was
[53:10] written about five years after first
[53:13] Corinthians was written. Why why God led
[53:15] Paul to put this in second Corinthians?
[53:18] We may never know because they certainly
[53:20] was not one of the more spiritual
[53:22] churches in the New Testament. They had
[53:24] fornication problems. They had adultery
[53:26] problems. They had gift problems. They
[53:29] had all kinds of major problems. If it
[53:32] had been me looking at it, I thought,
[53:33] you know what? I'd have shared this with
[53:35] the Ephesian church cuz they was one
[53:37] that was more mature or the Galatian
[53:39] church for several years, the church of
[53:41] Thessalonica. But for whatever reason,
[53:43] the Lord must have placed it on his
[53:45] heart to share it with the church at
[53:48] Corinth. And then he waits till the
[53:50] second book of Corinthians before he
[53:52] writes it. And then he no doubt he
[53:54] prayed over it. Lord, how should I say
[53:56] this? I don't want to say it in a way
[53:59] that would make them feel like I'm
[54:01] gloring in myself. Now you can read uh
[54:05] uh begin probably chapter 12 verse one
[54:08] just to read the entire unfolding of
[54:10] this and how he deals with it. And he
[54:13] sets this forth. He said less that I
[54:15] should glory in myself. Now by now Paul
[54:19] had already realized that a man that is
[54:22] given something from God, he's going to
[54:24] have quite a challenge the rest of his
[54:27] life from what God gives him. in the way
[54:30] that he relates to that to other people.
[54:33] Is he going to be able to take what God
[54:35] does for him and condescend and bring it
[54:39] to the people and share it with the
[54:41] people in such a way that it won't lift
[54:44] him up and it won't embarrass them or
[54:48] humiliate them. And it won't give him
[54:50] the big head and pride and so on, but
[54:53] he'll be able to bring it to them for
[54:56] the that they can understand it was
[54:58] actually for your benefit that God
[55:01] actually showed me anything. So Paul is
[55:04] now I I believe myself in looking at
[55:06] this timeline because God has a very
[55:09] important thing when it comes to time.
[55:11] Not necessarily just for him as much as
[55:14] it is for us. So he must have felt a
[55:17] relief about this and being able to to
[55:20] write this. So read with me if you would
[55:22] in 2 Corinthians 12:7. And last I should
[55:25] be exalted above measure through the
[55:29] abundance of the revelations. There was
[55:32] given to me a thorn in the flesh, the
[55:35] messenger of Satan to buffet me lest I
[55:38] should be exalted above measure. Now,
[55:42] this man, I'm sure y'all would agree
[55:44] with me that this man had the Holy
[55:47] Ghost. We agree with that. He was not
[55:50] only just a preacher, but a church age
[55:53] messenger. A man that God had bestowed
[55:56] such revelations that no other man in
[55:59] the New Testament or on down for almost
[56:02] 2,000 years would ever understand what
[56:05] the Med understood. But yet at the same
[56:08] time, he was still so much human and
[56:12] could get pride and arrogance because of
[56:15] the revelation that God had to let a
[56:18] devil, a demon out of hell, a demon out
[56:24] of hell that would come and torment this
[56:29] man of God. Now, it wasn't there daily.
[56:32] It wasn't there hourly or weekly. We
[56:35] don't know exactly how frequently that
[56:37] it would be, but it would come from time
[56:39] to time. And the prophet said it would
[56:42] buffet him and then it would leave him
[56:44] alone. Then it would buffet him and it
[56:46] would leave him alone. So it would hit
[56:48] him and then God would make it back off.
[56:51] No doubt God knew exactly when he would
[56:54] need it. And you think with a man like
[56:57] this that had this caliber of ministry,
[56:59] why in the world would he need that?
[57:01] Well, you just answered your own
[57:03] question because of the caliber of
[57:05] ministry that he had. Now, people think,
[57:09] well, you know, when God gives you so
[57:11] much, that automatically brings great
[57:14] humility. No, it does not. You see,
[57:17] humility is something that is divine.
[57:20] But it is also, it is also something the
[57:24] individual, the recipient of the grace
[57:26] of God has to humble themsel. God will
[57:30] never humble you or me or other people
[57:34] around the word of God to the extent
[57:36] that they need it done. God will humble
[57:40] us to a degree and then we are
[57:43] partnershiping with God when it comes to
[57:46] the work of humility. God alone will
[57:50] never do it. But he tells us humble
[57:53] yourself. Remember when the Lord was
[57:55] going to open the seven seals and the
[57:58] Lord dealt with the prophet and told
[58:00] him, "Humble yourself, sanctify
[58:03] yourself." So, there's something about
[58:06] humility that actually opens the door
[58:10] for more greatness of God. And the
[58:13] greater that we become in God, not in
[58:16] our own eyes, but in God, it should
[58:19] absolutely bring more humility to the
[58:23] recipients of that greatness. But what's
[58:26] so sad is for many people, the greater
[58:29] they become, the less humility they
[58:32] have.
[58:34] Now, God knew what Paul was going to
[58:37] experience from this time on. Now, first
[58:40] Corinthians, according to the
[58:42] historians, the way that they place uh
[58:45] the the timeline that the New Testament
[58:47] was written, 1 Corinthians was one of
[58:50] the first books of the New Testament.
[58:52] So, it was written around 60 AD actually
[58:56] before Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[58:59] Now, you imagine the early church
[59:01] preached for almost 30 years without a
[59:04] New Testament. They didn't even have
[59:06] one. So don't think that they stood up
[59:08] and started preaching from Matthew,
[59:10] Mark, Luke, and John and Acts and all
[59:12] that. They didn't even have it. So Paul
[59:14] now one of the first ones to begin to
[59:16] write it. And the spirit of God told
[59:19] him, "Now I have much people in this
[59:21] city called Corinth." No doubt he needed
[59:24] that encouragement because they needed a
[59:26] lot of work. So God had to give Paul
[59:29] what he needed to help him. And then as
[59:32] God began to unveil the mystery of
[59:35] Christ that had been hid since the
[59:37] foundation of the world. Now think Paul
[59:39] is seeing things that the angels of God
[59:43] did not even know. So Paul is writing
[59:46] things in Ephesians, Philippians,
[59:49] Fleimon, Galatians, 1 and 2 Timothy, 1
[59:53] and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 uh
[59:55] Corinthians, and things that he was
[59:57] saying that the angels of God had never
[1:00:01] even heard of, much less having this
[1:00:05] heavenly experience in the presence of
[1:00:08] God. And yet God knew to counterbalance
[1:00:11] the abundance of the revelation that
[1:00:14] Paul was getting, he would need to be
[1:00:17] buffeted and whipped and hit
[1:00:22] and knocked down and
[1:00:25] humiliated over and over again. You mean
[1:00:29] the Holy Ghost don't do that? the Holy
[1:00:33] Ghost that gives us revelations and
[1:00:36] great understandings of the things of
[1:00:38] God. Somehow it don't just bring all the
[1:00:41] humility that we need with it.
[1:00:44] It does not. You see, this has been one
[1:00:48] of man's greatest battles is when God
[1:00:51] would use him being able to humble
[1:00:54] himself after being a recipient of the
[1:00:57] grace of God. That might seem peculiar
[1:01:00] and strange to you, but myself, I desire
[1:01:04] only the allocation or the allotment of
[1:01:08] whatever God has for me. I I don't want
[1:01:10] to stand in anybody else's position. I
[1:01:13] don't want what's your part or yours or
[1:01:15] yours. I want only what God wants for
[1:01:18] me. I'll never be great. Done. Accepted
[1:01:20] all that years and years ago. I'll never
[1:01:22] amount to much. That's perfectly fine
[1:01:24] with me because if I'm not ordained to
[1:01:27] walk where other great men walk, I'm
[1:01:30] endangering my own life and my own walk
[1:01:33] with God by trying to move into a
[1:01:36] caliber that I'm not called to be. And
[1:01:39] let me say to you, each one of you, it's
[1:01:42] exactly the same way for yourself. Now
[1:01:46] then Paul in verse 8, he says that for
[1:01:49] this thing I besought the Lord thrice
[1:01:51] that I that it might depart from me. So
[1:01:53] this would be the natural thing to do.
[1:01:56] You're a preacher of deliverance and you
[1:01:57] see God cast out devils and heal the
[1:02:00] sick and you're spiritual enough to know
[1:02:02] that this thing is bothering you. It's a
[1:02:04] demon out of hell and you know that. So
[1:02:07] humanly it wouldn't make sense really
[1:02:09] for you to look at and think, well
[1:02:10] there's no way this is the will of God
[1:02:12] for this to be here and aggravate me. It
[1:02:14] just don't make no sense. I'm a preacher
[1:02:17] of deliverance. I cast out devils. I lay
[1:02:19] hands on the sick and and it leaves
[1:02:21] them. So, I'm going to ask God for the
[1:02:23] same thing for me. That's what we
[1:02:25] probably all would do. So, Paul did as a
[1:02:29] normal delivering preacher would do. And
[1:02:32] he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient
[1:02:35] for thee, for my strength is made
[1:02:38] perfect in weakness. Most gladly,
[1:02:42] therefore, will I rather glory in my
[1:02:44] infirmities, that the power of Christ
[1:02:48] may rest upon me. But now, listen to
[1:02:51] this. How sly that Satan is. Watch this.
[1:02:56] And how can I overcome? You see,
[1:02:59] sometimes Satan can take you when you
[1:03:03] think that you're doing the will of God
[1:03:08] and can make you a
[1:03:11] proposition and you'll fall for it.
[1:03:16] So when you think you're in the will of
[1:03:18] God, doing what God wants you to do, and
[1:03:22] you're walking in harmony, so you
[1:03:25] believe, with God's will for your life,
[1:03:28] and Satan will sneak in and make you a
[1:03:33] proposition, and you'll fall for
[1:03:36] it. So, do we need more face when that
[1:03:40] happens? Do we need more virtue?
[1:03:42] Probably not. Do we need more
[1:03:45] temperance, more brotherly kindness?
[1:03:48] Probably not. Probably what we need is
[1:03:51] knowledge,
[1:03:54] divine
[1:03:56] knowledge. Now, so Satan then can set a
[1:03:59] trap for sons, daughters of God,
[1:04:02] preachers, ministry, and leoty alike.
[1:04:04] And while they're in the will of God and
[1:04:06] doing the will of God, and they're so
[1:04:08] convinced that they're attaining one
[1:04:11] victory after another after another, and
[1:04:13] then Satan will make them a proposition.
[1:04:17] And they will look at it. Yes. And they
[1:04:20] will think it's God.
[1:04:25] Help us, Jesus.
[1:04:27] How many has he ever done that to? Well,
[1:04:29] I guarantee if he ain't, he will. Now,
[1:04:32] watch how the prophet deals. To me, this
[1:04:34] is so profound. He said, "Now, let's
[1:04:36] just take very next paragraph, let's
[1:04:39] just take like our
[1:04:42] sisters. They're
[1:04:45] pretty. And he can get you to a
[1:04:49] place that you let your hair grow out
[1:04:53] and you didn't realize it looks so nice
[1:04:58] on you." Wow.
[1:05:01] And the first thing you know, you kind
[1:05:03] of get to feeling a little stuck up, a
[1:05:07] little
[1:05:09] above something else. I I find that
[1:05:11] amazing because hair and looks and
[1:05:15] appearance, of course, it's it's a big
[1:05:17] thing for our sisters and it should be.
[1:05:19] There's nothing wrong with him being
[1:05:22] pretty. The prophet uses the word
[1:05:24] pretty, but just don't use the world to
[1:05:27] make yourself pretty.
[1:05:29] But then the thing which would have
[1:05:32] started out for many of our sisters
[1:05:34] being a reproach to their family and
[1:05:37] their friends that they would start
[1:05:39] letting their hair grow out and become
[1:05:42] long and their friends would say now
[1:05:44] your hair will definitely be more
[1:05:46] healthy if you'll trim them ends off of
[1:05:49] it and if you'll catch you some bangs
[1:05:52] because with the profile of your face it
[1:05:55] would look much better if you had bangs
[1:05:57] and you know this and that and the other
[1:05:59] around the front and then maybe you
[1:06:01] really battle that and then you get
[1:06:03] beyond that and say, "Oh, I don't I
[1:06:04] ain't worried about that no more. I I
[1:06:06] I'm beyond that right now. I want to do
[1:06:08] what the Lord wants me to do. If there's
[1:06:10] any question in my mind, I ain't
[1:06:12] trimming it. I ain't doing this. No,
[1:06:14] there ain't no way I'm doing it." Then
[1:06:16] what does Satan do? He changes his
[1:06:20] tactics by the way he comes before you.
[1:06:23] And then you'll stand in the mirror and
[1:06:25] look at yourself and look at your hair,
[1:06:27] how beautiful it is. And even people out
[1:06:29] here in the world, they may laugh at us
[1:06:32] and make fun of us, but there's
[1:06:34] something about a man, and I I've been
[1:06:36] around with my own wife and my daughters
[1:06:38] and my granddaughters and all their long
[1:06:39] hair, and you look at men as they will
[1:06:42] look at them, and they may not say one
[1:06:44] thing, but they look at that hair.
[1:06:47] There's just something about that hair.
[1:06:49] Is that right? You know, a woman that
[1:06:51] goes into a barber shop and she winds up
[1:06:54] getting her hair cut as about as short
[1:06:56] as mine is. There ain't nothing feminist
[1:06:58] about that. If they are, then I'm
[1:07:00] feminist cuz look at my hair. Look at
[1:07:03] your brother's hair. So, there's nothing
[1:07:05] feminist about a woman's hair. Cut her
[1:07:07] off, buddy. Give me a haircut. There
[1:07:10] ain't nothing womanly about that. I can
[1:07:13] tell you right now. But even worldly men
[1:07:16] will look at a woman's hair and there's
[1:07:19] something about it that strikes it. I
[1:07:22] just came, you know, Carol and I um went
[1:07:24] over to Switzerland to the meeting. So
[1:07:26] we we flew into several different
[1:07:28] countries going over and coming back.
[1:07:30] Wouldn't you know it, true to form,
[1:07:33] every restroom that I went to, whether
[1:07:35] it was in Geneva or Paris or the
[1:07:38] different airports that we was at
[1:07:40] looking for the bathroom, you know, they
[1:07:42] might have French on the door, they
[1:07:44] might have some other language on the
[1:07:46] door, but there's an international
[1:07:48] symbol on every one of those. And what
[1:07:51] is that symbol? It is a woman with a
[1:07:55] dress on for the women and it is a man
[1:07:58] with pants on for the men. So you see
[1:08:02] every nation on the earth will be judged
[1:08:06] because they know their self which door
[1:08:09] they're supposed to go into. Nature
[1:08:12] itself tells them. They don't even need
[1:08:14] a Bible. And the church said, "But is it
[1:08:18] amazing then that Satan would try to
[1:08:21] bother the sisters initially and then as
[1:08:24] they let their hair grow out and people
[1:08:27] would begin to compliment them. Oh, your
[1:08:29] hair is so beautiful. Your hair is so
[1:08:31] beautiful." And our sisters hear it.
[1:08:33] Carol, I know Carol's heard it. Alicia's
[1:08:35] heard it. My daughter Erica heard it. My
[1:08:38] granddaughters hear it. Sisters from the
[1:08:40] church. Your hair is so beautiful. Such
[1:08:43] beautiful young ladies. And you go to
[1:08:45] restaurants and they look at it and and
[1:08:47] they and they see it and then Satan will
[1:08:50] do what? He'll change his tactic. It's
[1:08:53] no longer that you wow, you know, it's
[1:08:56] it's a reproach and I'm I'm so laughed
[1:08:58] at because of my long hair. Now watch
[1:09:01] what he says. For instance, our sisters
[1:09:04] that they're pretty and you can get to a
[1:09:06] place, you let your hair grow out and
[1:09:08] you didn't realize it. It looks so nice
[1:09:11] on you. And the first thing you know,
[1:09:13] you kind of get a little feeling, a
[1:09:15] little stuck up, a little something
[1:09:18] else. Some of you men, you know what I
[1:09:20] mean? You can take the same thing and
[1:09:23] proposition it with you. That's right.
[1:09:26] You've got to overcome that. So, isn't
[1:09:28] it amazing? You overcome the bobbed hair
[1:09:32] uh facet of your life and you overcome
[1:09:35] that initial stage of your life. And
[1:09:37] then as you go on to become a more
[1:09:39] mature daughter of God, then Satan will
[1:09:42] totally transition and try to make you a
[1:09:45] proposition with what? Pride. Oh, pride.
[1:09:50] That you become
[1:09:52] proud. And yet at the same time, the
[1:09:56] only reason that you're even wearing
[1:09:58] that hair, if you're a daughter of God,
[1:10:00] is because God helped you to realize
[1:10:02] that's what he wants you to do. Ain't
[1:10:04] that right, sisters? That's what he
[1:10:06] wanted you to do. So, he's the one who
[1:10:09] gave you his word. He's the one who gave
[1:10:12] you your desire to do it. And then Satan
[1:10:16] wants to raise up an element of pride in
[1:10:18] your heart for what God gave you the
[1:10:20] ability to do. So every preacher that
[1:10:23] stands and preaches, every God called
[1:10:25] man, if he's really called of God, God
[1:10:27] gave him the gift in himself to be able
[1:10:30] to study and put things together and be
[1:10:33] able to become anointed and stand and
[1:10:35] preach. And if he's not careful, then
[1:10:37] people will turn in a prayer request.
[1:10:39] Brother so and so prayed for me. I got
[1:10:41] healed in this man's meeting and this
[1:10:43] man done this and this man and that man
[1:10:45] and that man and that man. And if he's
[1:10:47] not careful, he'll go to listening to
[1:10:50] all of that and thinking within himself,
[1:10:52] "Oh my Oh, my God is using me in such a
[1:10:57] way. Oh boy, our church is busting at
[1:11:00] the scene." I'll tell you what, I'm I'm
[1:11:02] just I'm this, I'm that. And where did
[1:11:04] you get all that?
[1:11:07] From your daddy, I suppose your great
[1:11:09] uncle, your grandfather, your
[1:11:11] grandmother was a great woman preacher,
[1:11:12] and you become a great man preacher.
[1:11:16] What do any of us have to stick our
[1:11:19] chest out about? That's right. Amen. But
[1:11:23] yet spiritual pride
[1:11:27] can lead to
[1:11:28] damnation of the soul. Lord, amen. This
[1:11:32] experience would have ruined Paul's
[1:11:35] earthly ministry had God not given
[1:11:39] thorns with the revelation.
[1:11:42] Anybody ever got thorns with yours? Oh
[1:11:44] my. Yes, sir. Now, watch. He says, this
[1:11:47] is amazing to me in the way that he just
[1:11:50] focuses it this way. Remember, you're
[1:11:52] living for God. You have one objective.
[1:11:56] One objective. Our life would be so much
[1:11:59] simpler if we just kept one. But we've
[1:12:01] got
[1:12:04] 1,389,432 and then one more after
[1:12:07] church, probably. But if we would
[1:12:09] simplify our life down to one objective,
[1:12:12] how much more peace we'd have? how much
[1:12:14] more joy we'd have. And that's Jesus
[1:12:18] Christ. Outside of that, there's nothing
[1:12:20] else counts. And word of life said,
[1:12:24] nothing else counts. That's him. Then
[1:12:28] secondly, for your
[1:12:30] family. Amen. Then thirdly for yourself,
[1:12:35] but first for God, next for your family,
[1:12:39] and next for you. You're number three.
[1:12:44] That's the end of the road. Put yourself
[1:12:49] last. And this is why he did. Amen.
[1:12:54] Amen.
[1:12:56] How many needs help? Uhhuh. Well, God
[1:12:58] bless the rest of you that's already
[1:13:00] there. Pray for the rest of us. We're on
[1:13:02] our way and we are going to get there by
[1:13:05] the grace of God. So God first, your
[1:13:09] family second, and you last. Now, if we
[1:13:12] would keep that divine order in our
[1:13:14] lives, I guarantee you would minimize a
[1:13:17] lot of the things that would go through.
[1:13:19] But what I find amazing now is that God
[1:13:22] had to deal with a man full of the Holy
[1:13:25] Ghost to keep him down from becoming
[1:13:29] arrogant and proud and bragging and
[1:13:33] boastful about what? Revelations of
[1:13:38] God. Revelations of God. Mysteries of
[1:13:42] God. A an experience with God that
[1:13:46] nobody else in the New Testament ever
[1:13:48] had. As a matter of fact, not another
[1:13:50] human being that ever walked on the face
[1:13:52] of the earth ever had this kind of
[1:13:54] experience. This is the only man. But
[1:13:57] the problem with that is this goes to
[1:14:01] thinking about it. Yes, sir.
[1:14:05] So there's nobody like me.
[1:14:10] Wow. How great I
[1:14:13] am. How
[1:14:16] great I am.
[1:14:20] Sometimes you might as well sing it that
[1:14:22] way cuz that's the way you view
[1:14:23] yourself.
[1:14:24] You think church ought to go around you.
[1:14:26] You think the singing ought to be the
[1:14:28] way you want it. This ought to be the
[1:14:30] way you want it. When you become the
[1:14:32] almighty, we will. But until you do, we
[1:14:35] ain't going to. And I don't figure
[1:14:37] there's much of chance of that happening
[1:14:39] in the near future within the next
[1:14:41] 10,000 years.
[1:14:43] You're going to be like all the rest of
[1:14:45] us. That's right. But then when you look
[1:14:49] at an Old Testament figure that the
[1:14:51] prophet used over and over again in the
[1:14:54] influence sermons, and that was King
[1:14:57] Uzziah. A good man, a man that loved
[1:15:00] God, a man that had a great beginning, a
[1:15:03] man that had a real divine allotment of
[1:15:06] God, a portion that hardly anybody else
[1:15:08] ever received from the Lord. And yet
[1:15:11] this man come to a spot because of where
[1:15:14] he was. Gifts of God. Gifts of God.
[1:15:21] Notice the prophet said, "This king got
[1:15:23] along fine until he found
[1:15:27] out until he found out that all the
[1:15:31] nations was fearing him." I wonder how
[1:15:36] in the world he found that out. People
[1:15:39] in his kingdom telling him. Now, you
[1:15:43] see, most preachers never start out that
[1:15:45] way on their own, but it will be from
[1:15:48] people, especially if it's a pastor. If
[1:15:51] it's people sitting in his congregation
[1:15:53] and every time they get around him, they
[1:15:54] go to butter him up. They go to tell
[1:15:57] him, "Boy, there ain't nobody preaching
[1:15:59] what you're preaching. You're the only
[1:16:01] one." On they go. And then he'll go to
[1:16:05] sinking about it. Oh, he'll go to
[1:16:06] sinking. My you reckon that's true? I
[1:16:09] wonder how many views we had last
[1:16:11] Sunday. I wonder how many YouTube views
[1:16:14] that we've got. And then he'll check his
[1:16:16] views and then go over and check brother
[1:16:18] so and so's views. Oh my. We we three
[1:16:21] times bigger than them.
[1:16:27] Help us Jesus.
[1:16:29] Amen. We need divine knowledge. You see,
[1:16:34] knowledge of God will help you as soon
[1:16:38] as that goes to coming across in your
[1:16:40] mind. That ain't nothing but the devil.
[1:16:47] Praise the Lord. But I reckon I'm going
[1:16:48] to have to preach and say amen too.
[1:16:52] Now notice the prophet said that the
[1:16:54] king got along fine until he found out
[1:16:56] all the nations was fearing him. He
[1:16:58] become
[1:17:00] largely
[1:17:02] populated. His
[1:17:05] kingdom got built up. So a church or a
[1:17:08] ministry if it's a preacher and he got
[1:17:11] lifted up in his heart
[1:17:15] with
[1:17:17] pride. Now remember this is what caused
[1:17:20] Satan's
[1:17:21] fall. Satan didn't smoke a cigarette in
[1:17:25] heaven and God kicked him out.
[1:17:28] He didn't commit adultery in heaven. He
[1:17:31] didn't drink in heaven. But he got to
[1:17:34] looking at himself and realizing there's
[1:17:37] not another angel in heaven as great as
[1:17:42] I
[1:17:44] am. Sin
[1:17:47] began in the heart of
[1:17:50] Lucifer when he said, "I will be like
[1:17:55] the most high.
[1:17:59] I will be like God.
[1:18:04] There's the origination of sin.
[1:18:08] Pride, arrogance
[1:18:11] in the
[1:18:12] heart of a heavenly being.
[1:18:18] Now friends, I don't mind telling you
[1:18:20] when you and I look at what we are and
[1:18:23] the look at what he was, none of us have
[1:18:25] ever been what Lucifer was. That's
[1:18:27] right. And the church said, "But what
[1:18:31] got him?"
[1:18:33] Pride. You see, I'm I'm just a big man
[1:18:37] now. That's the way out. The prophet
[1:18:40] said, "The way up is down." How do you
[1:18:44] know which way is up or down? Cuz if the
[1:18:47] world stand in space, how do you know
[1:18:49] which is up or down? So always he that
[1:18:51] humbles himself, God will exalt. He that
[1:18:55] exalts himself, God will bring to a
[1:18:57] base. He'll bring him down. Always keep
[1:19:01] humble. This is the key right here for
[1:19:03] every person that claims to be a
[1:19:06] Christian and be
[1:19:09] little in your own
[1:19:13] sight. So if millions of people would be
[1:19:16] around you bragging on you and lifting
[1:19:19] you up and telling you all kinds of
[1:19:21] things, it wouldn't affect you one bit.
[1:19:24] Amen. Unless you begin to think the same
[1:19:28] thing.
[1:19:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. No matter what
[1:19:34] God does for you, just see how much more
[1:19:38] humbler you can be all the time. More
[1:19:41] God blesses you, you just keep getting
[1:19:44] more humble all the time. And he can
[1:19:48] continue to bless.
[1:19:52] Wow. That don't make any sense. so
[1:19:54] humanly does it that the more God does
[1:19:57] and we shouldn't. Shouldn't we tell
[1:19:58] everybody? Shouldn't we brag about it?
[1:20:00] Shouldn't we exalt oursel and start
[1:20:02] looking down on other people? And what
[1:20:05] we're doing is just winding oursel away
[1:20:07] from the blessing of God when we go that
[1:20:09] way. So it's the more God blesses us and
[1:20:11] the more humble we gets. And the more he
[1:20:13] blesses us, the more humble we get. And
[1:20:15] the more he blesses us, the more humble
[1:20:16] we get. then that is the equation for
[1:20:19] God to continue blessing you for the
[1:20:22] rest of your entire
[1:20:26] life. It will never stop.
[1:20:31] Amen.
[1:20:33] Notice he said, "But when you get to a
[1:20:35] place you think I've got
[1:20:38] it, you haven't got it. You're on your
[1:20:43] road out.
[1:20:47] Dear
[1:20:49] God, you
[1:20:51] lose your
[1:20:54] influence. You lose the
[1:20:59] strength of your
[1:21:06] testimony. Now, to preachers get in this
[1:21:09] shape, do they stop preaching
[1:21:10] immediately? Of course not. They keep
[1:21:12] right on preaching, keep right on doing
[1:21:15] whatever they're doing, but their
[1:21:18] strength of their testimony among the
[1:21:20] people of God is getting less and less
[1:21:24] and less because the people notice a
[1:21:26] change. They notice
[1:21:28] something. It seems to be more about him
[1:21:31] and his this and his that and his
[1:21:34] something
[1:21:35] else. Church today is not about me. No,
[1:21:38] church today is not about our deacon
[1:21:40] board and our nice building that the
[1:21:42] Lord's given us. It's about our God and
[1:21:46] his mercy. Amen. I don't know about you,
[1:21:48] I come to church today with needs. And
[1:21:50] this building can't meet a one of them.
[1:21:53] I come to church today with things on my
[1:21:55] heart and things I need from God.
[1:21:57] They're in a person sitting here today
[1:21:59] that can meet those needs for me.
[1:22:01] Anybody the same way? There's only one
[1:22:03] being in this place that can help me
[1:22:05] today. That's the Lord God. So why
[1:22:08] should I focus on you? Why should I
[1:22:10] focus on me? Why should I focus on our
[1:22:13] building and this and that and the
[1:22:15] other? Let's focus on the only source
[1:22:18] that we can be helped by today and the
[1:22:20] rest of our lives.
[1:22:23] I want you to notice how that the
[1:22:25] prophet takes this. It's really sad
[1:22:27] because a lot of the preachers in that
[1:22:29] day and even worse to say a lot of
[1:22:31] preachers in this day did not listen
[1:22:34] carefully to the sermons called
[1:22:36] influence or they would have stayed away
[1:22:38] from their own downfall. So many today,
[1:22:41] now watch, he doesn't just limit it to a
[1:22:43] preacher. You take a family of people
[1:22:47] and they'll start going to church and
[1:22:50] God will heal the little family.
[1:22:54] He'll bless them. Notice this. And give
[1:22:58] them the Holy Spirit in their lives. And
[1:23:00] the little children will pray around the
[1:23:03] table. And they'll pray before they go
[1:23:05] to bed. Mother and father will join
[1:23:08] hands and pray. And as long as they
[1:23:11] continue like
[1:23:13] that, they'll stay a family.
[1:23:17] But you let them. The first thing you
[1:23:19] know, they didn't have nothing. an old
[1:23:21] junk car and maybe riding around in it
[1:23:23] or maybe
[1:23:25] walking. Finally, they get a good car
[1:23:29] and a better home and the first thing
[1:23:32] you know they want to get what the world
[1:23:34] calls a better
[1:23:36] class to associate with. They move into
[1:23:41] a different
[1:23:42] neighborhood and in there they find out
[1:23:45] they become
[1:23:47] influenced by the wrong influence.
[1:23:50] You must always stay where the kingdom
[1:23:53] of God is and where the glory of God is
[1:23:57] pouring out. Stay where you can be
[1:24:00] spiritually fed day and night. And the
[1:24:05] church said,
[1:24:07] "Then the first thing you know,
[1:24:09] separations come in the home and
[1:24:13] worldliness and they got lifted up."
[1:24:17] Oh, how many families have I seen in the
[1:24:19] message of the hour in their own
[1:24:22] church and watch God heal them, save
[1:24:27] them, stir their hearts toward him. They
[1:24:30] get a little money and they do this and
[1:24:32] do that and the other. Then they start,
[1:24:34] you know, getting more of the world and
[1:24:36] more of this. How many have said in our
[1:24:39] church that are gone today don't even
[1:24:42] serve God no more. And yet God turned
[1:24:45] their life around and deliver them and
[1:24:47] heal them and bring them to a place, oh,
[1:24:50] I'll tell you one thing. I'd rather be
[1:24:52] as poor as Job's turkey and have to
[1:24:54] stand on the side of the road as a pan
[1:24:56] handler than I would to be so stinking
[1:24:58] rotten, filthy, rich and get so cold and
[1:25:02] lay it of sin. Come on, somebody preach
[1:25:04] with me this morning. I pray God helps
[1:25:07] every one of us that we stay where God
[1:25:10] can use us. Amen. Humble, small. Thank
[1:25:15] you, Lord. Amen.
[1:25:18] Oh
[1:25:20] my. Again, he's talking about the
[1:25:24] king. Stay where you can be spiritually
[1:25:26] fed. And he said they get lifted up.
[1:25:29] Uzziah did that. He got lifted up much
[1:25:32] pride in what? The work of God.
[1:25:37] Amen. That's right.
[1:25:40] Now pride. He got lifted up and he
[1:25:44] thought, "What a great fellow
[1:25:49] I am."
[1:25:52] There's only one I am you need to be
[1:25:54] talking about that way.
[1:25:56] And it ain't you. It ain't me. And it
[1:26:00] ain't nobody else but him. What a great
[1:26:03] fellow I am so much. He got lifted up
[1:26:07] till he tried to take the
[1:26:10] place of a minister.
[1:26:15] He goes into the temple which took
[1:26:18] picked up the sensor of fire went into
[1:26:20] the altar of incense. Now that was only
[1:26:23] consecrated
[1:26:24] men to do
[1:26:26] that. Now as I've told you before, so
[1:26:29] say I
[1:26:31] again. Businessmen are not preachers.
[1:26:34] Amen. It's very very sad that a lot of
[1:26:38] the message churches still don't follow
[1:26:40] this pattern of God's prophet. And you
[1:26:43] remember it'll be this same message
[1:26:45] that'll condemn you at the day of
[1:26:46] judgment. You businessmen around the
[1:26:49] message that are trying to run the
[1:26:50] churches trying to set the preachers
[1:26:53] down and press play. Oh yeah. So
[1:26:57] businessmen can run the church. It come
[1:26:59] from hell. It will go back to hell. It
[1:27:03] is
[1:27:05] antirist. It's against God's
[1:27:08] word. Oh my goodness. Wow. Notice he
[1:27:12] said, "Now, you're the prophet, of
[1:27:14] course, was a a a spokesman for the full
[1:27:17] gospel businessman." And he kept warning
[1:27:19] them over and over again because the
[1:27:22] businessmen were money makers and this
[1:27:24] and that and another. They wanted to do
[1:27:25] something for God. And God used that.
[1:27:27] They become actually a place where
[1:27:29] brother Brandham could bring some of his
[1:27:30] great sermons cuz a lot of churches
[1:27:32] wouldn't have nothing to do with it. And
[1:27:34] brother Carl Williams was in charge of
[1:27:36] it. And as long as brother Carl was
[1:27:38] alive, Brother Brandham had a place to
[1:27:40] preach. So he'd be able to go and preach
[1:27:42] things the churches wouldn't let him
[1:27:44] preach and God used him. But he had to
[1:27:46] start warning them early on because the
[1:27:49] businessmen wanted to get up and take
[1:27:51] charge of the service and run the
[1:27:53] service. And they begin to do this and
[1:27:55] do that and the other. Oh my. As I've
[1:27:58] said before, so I say again, businessmen
[1:28:00] are not preachers. We preachers have
[1:28:03] enough time to try to keep this thing
[1:28:05] straight. Let alone
[1:28:08] businessmen. You all are businessmen,
[1:28:11] not ministers. And don't take the place
[1:28:14] of one because you're not called for
[1:28:17] such. Now, this is what I love about the
[1:28:20] prophet's preaching. He has an ideal
[1:28:23] time right now to say if you want to be
[1:28:26] in the perfect will of God, you should
[1:28:29] press play anyhow. Not only should the
[1:28:32] businessmen not preach, but preachers
[1:28:34] should not preach. He has a perfect
[1:28:37] opportunity, brother John, to say, "Now
[1:28:39] look, this is the plan of God right here
[1:28:41] in the future. God don't want no
[1:28:43] preaching pastors, no preaching
[1:28:45] evangelists. So the perfect will of God
[1:28:47] is press play." But you know what? He
[1:28:50] didn't say that. You know why? He was a
[1:28:53] word prophet. And he come to restore our
[1:28:56] hearts back to the original apostolic
[1:29:00] doctrine. I don't know if you understand
[1:29:02] it yet or not, but a lot of the message
[1:29:03] people have never been and never will be
[1:29:07] restored back to the apostolic faith
[1:29:09] because they believe Brother Brandham
[1:29:11] come to introduce something totally
[1:29:15] completely new. Well, if he did, he was
[1:29:18] a false prophet. Come on, children. If
[1:29:22] he come to introduce something new that
[1:29:24] was different than Paul, he could not
[1:29:27] fulfill Joel 2. He could not fulfill
[1:29:30] Malachi 4. He could not fulfill Matthew
[1:29:34] 17. Come on, somebody preach with me
[1:29:36] today. But Elijah was to come to restore
[1:29:40] or turn our hearts back to the faith of
[1:29:43] the fathers, not bring something new.
[1:29:49] Oh hallelujah.
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:29:53] Oh
[1:29:54] my. This king though being a godly man
[1:29:58] as he was
[1:30:00] godly. He felt
[1:30:04] self
[1:30:05] sufficient. He felt like he could hoist
[1:30:08] himself up in
[1:30:10] pride. What he could just take over and
[1:30:13] do whatever he wanted to do. Nobody
[1:30:17] else. He had to ask. Oh my. Uhoh. My
[1:30:24] But remember, we're always under God.
[1:30:27] God is our God. And we find out he got
[1:30:29] lifted up. And he got so lifted up till
[1:30:32] he thought that because he'd been
[1:30:34] blessed of
[1:30:36] God, he could take a minister's
[1:30:41] place. Let me tell you, there's another
[1:30:44] danger, my friends.
[1:30:46] that's going on around the
[1:30:49] world. Pastors, evangelists,
[1:30:53] teachers are stepping into the prophets
[1:30:56] place.
[1:30:59] So pastors are becoming interpreters of
[1:31:02] the word. Evangelists becoming
[1:31:05] interpreters of the
[1:31:08] word, stepping out of their position and
[1:31:12] trying to stand in the pulpit. Well, we
[1:31:14] know brother Brown taught it this way,
[1:31:15] but this ain't the way we believe it at
[1:31:17] our church. You understand what you just
[1:31:18] heard? Then men who are doing that are
[1:31:22] standing in the office of a divine
[1:31:24] interpreter of the written word. They're
[1:31:27] just as much out of the will of God as
[1:31:29] King Uzziah was. And if they don't stop
[1:31:32] it, death will follow.
[1:31:35] I'm not called to interpret the word.
[1:31:38] The rest of the ministry in our church
[1:31:41] is not called to interpret the word. I'm
[1:31:43] called to preach what has already been
[1:31:47] interpreted.
[1:31:48] Come on, somebody. What is a prophet? A
[1:31:51] divine interpreter of the written word.
[1:31:57] Not a pastor. Amen.
[1:32:04] So what? Use took a sensor and went
[1:32:07] in. And what's lots of preachers in the
[1:32:10] message doing? taking the
[1:32:12] Bible. Taking their Bible. Well, I know
[1:32:16] Brother Rim said this year, you know, I
[1:32:18] know all that, but now this is the way
[1:32:20] we're doing our church. You can do your
[1:32:22] church any way you want to. You can turn
[1:32:23] it into a hog pin if that's what you
[1:32:25] want to do. But if you want God there,
[1:32:28] you got to stay straight on the word.
[1:32:30] Listen, God don't initially leave when
[1:32:33] people start off the word. God don't
[1:32:36] initially leave. He'll stay there and
[1:32:38] deal with you, deal with you, deal with
[1:32:40] you. It's in the matter of time that it
[1:32:43] grieves the spirit of God. We don't want
[1:32:45] the spirit of God grief from our church,
[1:32:47] do we? We want a church that believes
[1:32:49] the word, that preaches the word, and
[1:32:52] obeys the word, and talks the word, and
[1:32:55] lives the word, and is becoming the
[1:32:59] word. Notice this in the Perameian
[1:33:02] church age. I find this statement
[1:33:03] astounding. Too often when men are
[1:33:08] signally signally used of the Lord, they
[1:33:14] become lifted
[1:33:16] up with
[1:33:18] pride. Signally used divine knowledge
[1:33:23] would warn them as soon as they feel
[1:33:26] that
[1:33:27] whisper in their heart.
[1:33:31] But of course, we're more concerned
[1:33:33] about gifts. We're more concerned about
[1:33:36] faith.
[1:33:39] It's apparent most of us need a whole
[1:33:41] lot more divine knowledge. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:45] Can I go on a little more? Yeah. Now,
[1:33:48] this is amazing because God does
[1:33:51] something that the human being just just
[1:33:53] can't comprehend. We try to make our our
[1:33:58] weaknesses.
[1:33:59] We make excuses for
[1:34:01] them and we will put them well this is
[1:34:04] the very reason why God can't do that.
[1:34:07] So God, help me to get that out of the
[1:34:10] way. And God, I'll present to you about
[1:34:12] myself what is good, what is usable. I I
[1:34:16] I'll give to you. I'll give to you the
[1:34:19] thing that you can use at Lord. Do you
[1:34:21] understand? You understand what I'm
[1:34:22] saying, Lord? I mean that I've got
[1:34:24] things about me that's, you know, it's
[1:34:25] just weaknesses and it's failures and so
[1:34:27] on, but I've got things about me that
[1:34:29] are phenomenal. I mean, I've got things
[1:34:31] about me that are so
[1:34:33] great. Would you like to hear them,
[1:34:35] Lord? Oh,
[1:34:38] amen. That's the truth.
[1:34:41] Long story short, God says, "I don't
[1:34:44] want your strengths." Actually, what I
[1:34:46] want to do the job with is your
[1:34:49] weaknesses,
[1:34:55] which makes no sense to us. Watch this.
[1:34:57] If you haven't listened to this in a
[1:34:58] while, do you good to listen to it?
[1:35:00] Perfect strength to perfect weakness. We
[1:35:01] try to make weaknesses, our weaknesses,
[1:35:04] excuses. We want to tell how big we are
[1:35:07] and how great we are. And I think that's
[1:35:08] one of the things God gave me the text
[1:35:10] for was to get that out of our mind.
[1:35:13] Now, this is 1961. Here we are 2025.
[1:35:17] Apparently, at least somebody other than
[1:35:19] me need to hear today. Of course, the
[1:35:20] Lord could have told me this down the
[1:35:21] basement whenever I studying and saved
[1:35:24] all y'all this whooping.
[1:35:26] So, one of the brothers asked me
[1:35:27] yesterday about the service today. Said,
[1:35:29] "You're going to use a whip tomorrow or
[1:35:31] a belt?" I said, "Both.
[1:35:36] with me, Lord. With me, Lord. Beat all
[1:35:38] my foolishness out. Beat all the
[1:35:40] nonsense out of me. Beat all the all the
[1:35:42] old junk out of me till you can use
[1:35:44] something for the glory of God.
[1:35:47] There's there's little things that we
[1:35:49] do, and there's what we come to church
[1:35:51] for. Now
[1:35:53] listen, it's to find out where our
[1:35:56] faults is. Amen. That's right. Now, how
[1:35:59] many of your brothers told your wife
[1:36:00] today, "Honey, we're going to church
[1:36:02] today and I'm going to find out what my
[1:36:04] fault is." And she probably said, "Glory
[1:36:05] to
[1:36:06] God. Glory to God."
[1:36:10] Is this why we come to church?
[1:36:17] Mama, that's why we come to church for
[1:36:19] to find where our faults is and things
[1:36:22] that we might better ourselves by. If we
[1:36:26] come to church for any other objective
[1:36:28] than this, I'm afraid we don't get too
[1:36:31] much out of coming to church.
[1:36:34] Wow. We must come to find our
[1:36:39] weaknesses, find our bad places. See,
[1:36:43] see how little we are.
[1:36:48] So I wonder how many folks in Johnson
[1:36:50] City, Kingsport, Bristol, the
[1:36:51] surrounding areas come to church today
[1:36:54] to find out how little they were. And
[1:36:56] how many of the preachers when they got
[1:36:58] done preaching? So a lot of them
[1:36:59] probably already done by now. Uh they
[1:37:01] and then they got done they said,
[1:37:04] "Man, I was about this big when he
[1:37:06] started. I was about that big when he
[1:37:08] got halfway through and I got plumbed
[1:37:09] down here. I don't know. I don't know if
[1:37:12] I can do anything or not." Say, "Glory
[1:37:13] to God. Wasn't that awesome, man? I
[1:37:16] found out I am so good. I am so great.
[1:37:19] My potential is unlimited. I can be
[1:37:21] anything I want to be. Whatever I want
[1:37:23] to be. I'm an American. I'm an a
[1:37:25] Christian. I can take the word. I've got
[1:37:27] the power. I can say what I want to say
[1:37:29] according to the Bible. Say what you
[1:37:31] will and it'll be granted to you.
[1:37:35] That is what the Bible says.
[1:37:38] But you've got to have a nature and a
[1:37:40] character
[1:37:42] before God can drop that scripture in
[1:37:44] your heart. Yeah. Anybody ever said
[1:37:46] things that never happened a bit more
[1:37:47] than a man in a moon? Come on now. The
[1:37:49] word ain't a liar. Our character must
[1:37:52] match the power that we're trying to tap
[1:37:55] into.
[1:37:58] See how little we are and we put our
[1:38:02] trust in somebody that's strong. There's
[1:38:06] so many of us that likes to
[1:38:09] testify, likes to
[1:38:11] think though we're
[1:38:13] insufficient. And therefore we make that
[1:38:15] an excuse. I have no education. I have
[1:38:19] no ability. I'm not I'm unable to do
[1:38:21] this. If you keep that up and do it in
[1:38:25] that way, keep going like that, you
[1:38:28] can't mount to anything. There you go.
[1:38:33] But the very thing we make excuses by
[1:38:36] our
[1:38:37] weaknesses, God uses that very thing to
[1:38:41] tackle the job
[1:38:43] with, which is the things we all
[1:38:46] despise about
[1:38:49] ourselves. That's the very reason he
[1:38:52] chooses
[1:38:53] us because we're in that
[1:38:58] condition. Well, glory to God.
[1:39:01] Now that sounds strange,
[1:39:06] you'll cue
[1:39:10] but a few minutes we'll get to the
[1:39:11] reason of it. of God being willing. We
[1:39:13] find out just as we've been reading that
[1:39:15] weaknesses and
[1:39:17] rejections that those people who are the
[1:39:20] weakest rejected by the outside world is
[1:39:24] God's heroes.
[1:39:27] That conqueror up in the front line,
[1:39:31] that conqueror in the front
[1:39:34] line takes those who feel
[1:39:37] themselves unworthy.
[1:39:41] Praise the Lord. There's hope for me.
[1:39:45] Notice that it takes the
[1:39:48] weakest and the
[1:39:50] rejected. Practically every hero God
[1:39:54] ever had on the front line was that type
[1:39:59] of a person.
[1:40:02] Amen.
[1:40:04] A person that was rejected. A person
[1:40:07] that thought he was insufficient. a
[1:40:09] person that had no
[1:40:12] ability at all. Amen.
[1:40:18] Then that person's just in good shape.
[1:40:21] Praise God. They're in good shape. They
[1:40:26] just come to God said, "God, I ain't got
[1:40:27] nothing. I ain't smart. Didn't graduate
[1:40:29] high school." I told some of the kids
[1:40:31] yesterday that had the graduation party
[1:40:32] or I said, "Some of y'all done what I
[1:40:34] never did do. I didn't graduate from
[1:40:36] high school.
[1:40:39] I'd probably been better preacher five,
[1:40:40] right? Y'all think I need to go back to
[1:40:41] school. I'm too old now. There ain't no
[1:40:43] way. So people that didn't amount to
[1:40:46] nothing, people look at them and say,
[1:40:47] "Oh my goodness, who in the world would
[1:40:50] ever think a shepherd boy out there
[1:40:52] shouting at a hollering and a carrying
[1:40:54] on playing his little harp out there
[1:40:57] would ever become a giant slayer?" Who
[1:41:00] ever sought a man by the name of Noah?
[1:41:02] And the prophet of God said, Noah was a
[1:41:05] man that had no certain ambitions. Had
[1:41:09] nothing that he was looking forward to
[1:41:11] in life. Had nothing he was planning
[1:41:13] for. But God said, "If I can line you up
[1:41:16] with my ambitions, you'll save the
[1:41:18] world." Oh my. But we saying, "Boy, it's
[1:41:21] got to be some polished so and so out of
[1:41:23] this, that another look. How does he
[1:41:24] part his hair? He may not have a hair on
[1:41:26] his head, but if God wants to use him,
[1:41:29] God will transform him and make him an
[1:41:32] instrument to pull sinners to the power
[1:41:34] of Jesus Christ. It may be a woman that
[1:41:37] people say, "Oh, she's got a terrible
[1:41:39] past. Yeah, one of my sisters had a
[1:41:41] terrible past." You know her as the
[1:41:43] woman at the well. She had a lot of
[1:41:46] problems when it come to being husband,
[1:41:48] but the Lord Jesus planted a seed down
[1:41:51] inside of that woman. She had no honor.
[1:41:53] She had no reputation. She had no
[1:41:56] influence among the world. Her testimony
[1:41:59] has been preached over and over again
[1:42:02] around the world. Thousands and millions
[1:42:05] of people have been affected by a
[1:42:08] nobody.
[1:42:09] [Applause]
[1:42:17] But if we're not
[1:42:19] careful, we will come to God as
[1:42:22] nobody's. And then something happens to
[1:42:26] us. Then we begin to think we're
[1:42:31] somebody's. Then our opinion, our
[1:42:33] arrogance, our
[1:42:35] pride takes away the very thing that
[1:42:38] brought us to God in the first place.
[1:42:44] Oh
[1:42:46] my, help us
[1:42:49] Jesus. Then that person's in good shape.
[1:42:53] So God can start
[1:42:55] accusing. When they feel like they they
[1:42:59] can't, they haven't got
[1:43:02] nothing. That's when God can take a hold
[1:43:04] of them and do something with them. But
[1:43:07] when we are thinking we're able to do
[1:43:10] it,
[1:43:14] then God can't use us because we're
[1:43:17] wanting to do
[1:43:19] it ourselves.
[1:43:27] Ourselves. And there's one thing we've
[1:43:30] got to
[1:43:31] master. If we expect to fulfill God's
[1:43:35] desire in our lives, this ought to be on
[1:43:38] your refrigerator, on your steering
[1:43:40] wheel, on your gear shift, on your
[1:43:42] speedometer, on your iPhone, your droid.
[1:43:46] It ought to be imprinted in your
[1:43:48] soul. We have to master the thought of
[1:43:53] human
[1:43:56] ability. If we ever get to a spot where
[1:43:59] we think we can do it with our own
[1:44:02] intelligence and our own abilities,
[1:44:05] we've got to master that in such a way
[1:44:08] that we can get rid of the thing and lay
[1:44:11] it
[1:44:13] aside so
[1:44:15] God can use us. There's so many of us,
[1:44:20] oh my God, help us that likes to think
[1:44:23] that we're insufficient. Therefore, we
[1:44:25] make that an excuse. I have no
[1:44:26] education. Oh, yeah. I have no ability.
[1:44:28] I can't do this. I can't do that. Oh, if
[1:44:30] I could do this. And God said, "You're
[1:44:32] my
[1:44:33] hero." You didn't know that you're my
[1:44:37] hero. But God ain't got nothing. He
[1:44:38] said, "That's why you're my hero."
[1:44:40] Because you realize you don't have
[1:44:42] nothing. But the truth of it is, you may
[1:44:44] have all kinds of
[1:44:47] abilities. You may have all kinds of
[1:44:49] things you could do to help God
[1:44:52] out. Paul did. Paul had all kinds of
[1:44:56] things he could attribute it to the work
[1:44:58] of God, but he said they're
[1:45:01] worthless.
[1:45:03] Worthless that the power of
[1:45:06] Christ may rest upon
[1:45:09] me. Well, I don't know if I could ever
[1:45:12] get over this. I'm one day I'm I'm going
[1:45:14] to give my whole whole life to God if I
[1:45:16] can ever get under control and and if I
[1:45:18] could if I could learn more about the
[1:45:20] Bible and if I could learn more about
[1:45:21] the message and uh and if if I could be
[1:45:23] a better person and if I could maybe one
[1:45:25] day I I'll get good enough where I could
[1:45:26] sing in the choir and and I want to give
[1:45:29] God
[1:45:30] everything. Why don't you just come to
[1:45:32] him as you are today? Oh yeah. Amen.
[1:45:36] With your whole heart. Maybe you can't
[1:45:38] carry a tune in a lard bucket. Anybody
[1:45:41] know what a lard bucket is?
[1:45:44] Some of you. Well, it's a bucket you
[1:45:46] carry lord in. Anybody know what lard
[1:45:48] is?
[1:45:51] The Bible says, "Make a joyful noise to
[1:45:53] the Lord." You may be on key, off key,
[1:45:55] out of key. Man, I don't even know what
[1:45:56] key you even sang there. I'd rather give
[1:45:58] my best to the Lord than say, "Well, I'm
[1:46:00] going to wait till I get to heaven. Not
[1:46:01] me. I'm going to sing off key, out of
[1:46:03] key, in key, wrong key. I'm going to
[1:46:05] worship him. I'm going to praise him."
[1:46:07] Come on, somebody. I want to give him my
[1:46:10] all. I'm not waiting till I get perfect
[1:46:13] to preach. I'm not waiting until I
[1:46:16] become perfect. My goodness, I've given
[1:46:18] my whole life for it. What good would it
[1:46:20] do me to say,
[1:46:21] "Well, I think I'm going to resign for a
[1:46:24] while and I'm going to learn how to
[1:46:26] become the perfect preacher and then
[1:46:27] I'll come back and then I'd be about the
[1:46:30] age of Methusa and all y'all done been
[1:46:32] gone and dead. You have roam around the
[1:46:34] wheelchair and I'd be mentally gone. So,
[1:46:36] I figure I better just go ahead and
[1:46:37] preach and give God all that I have and
[1:46:40] get out of the way and be able to speak
[1:46:43] to you. What about you? You want me to
[1:46:45] do that? I want you to do the same. Give
[1:46:48] him your all. Give him your heart. He
[1:46:50] don't just want your wallet.
[1:46:52] He wants you.
[1:46:59] Let me
[1:47:02] close. God passes the nobles.
[1:47:06] and gets the
[1:47:07] weakness. God passes those that think
[1:47:10] there's something to take somebody that
[1:47:13] don't know
[1:47:15] nothing to order to work his purpose in
[1:47:18] their life. God said to Paul, "My
[1:47:23] strength is
[1:47:25] perfect in your
[1:47:27] weakness." Listen to this. My strength
[1:47:31] becomes more
[1:47:33] perfect as you
[1:47:36] become more weaker.
[1:47:44] More you yield to me, the better
[1:47:48] I can use you.
[1:47:53] Hallelujah.
[1:47:55] And the more you acknowledge it, now you
[1:47:57] see there's an element of us that we can
[1:47:59] say, "I'm no good. I ain't no count. I I
[1:48:01] know I can't do nothing for God." But
[1:48:04] many times that's this saying that. But
[1:48:07] when from your heart you get to that
[1:48:09] spot, I've seen it in preaching. I've
[1:48:12] also seen it in prayer lines. And virtue
[1:48:15] will start leaving me and other
[1:48:17] brothers. You watch them too when
[1:48:19] they're doing it. And the spirit of God,
[1:48:21] it's amazing. is they're getting weaker,
[1:48:23] the spirit of God will come in and
[1:48:25] there'll be more healings at the end of
[1:48:28] that than there was where you was
[1:48:30] praying in your own strength. You're
[1:48:32] praying and boy, I mean, you're I mean,
[1:48:34] you're giving and you're doing
[1:48:35] everything that you can. You want God's
[1:48:37] people to be helped so bad and you feel
[1:48:39] it little at a time. It's depleting.
[1:48:41] It's going out of you. Eyes are start
[1:48:42] crossing. I've always had this that God
[1:48:44] gave me when I was a Pentecostal
[1:48:46] preacher. When I'm getting out so far
[1:48:47] into the anointing, I start seeing blue
[1:48:49] streaks across my eyes, fire flashes
[1:48:51] like this right up to here. I know it's
[1:48:53] time. I better get out or they're going
[1:48:55] to pack me
[1:48:56] out. But what's amazing is as you go to
[1:48:59] getting weaker, things will rise higher.
[1:49:02] You're getting out of the way cuz it
[1:49:03] ain't the force. It ain't the force of
[1:49:05] your voice. It's not the power of your
[1:49:08] voice or the strength of your body. But
[1:49:11] God is just using you and flowing
[1:49:13] through you. Oh no. And when you say,
[1:49:16] "Oh no, oh no." I'm getting weaker. I'm
[1:49:17] getting weaker. I'm getting weaker. And
[1:49:19] God said, "All right, now I'll start
[1:49:21] doing the work." Hallelujah. If we can
[1:49:24] realize we cannot produce this message
[1:49:26] ourselves. We cannot ever produce a
[1:49:29] rapture, the weaker we get. Hallelujah.
[1:49:32] I ain't talking about sin. I'm talking
[1:49:35] about weakness in our own ability.
[1:49:44] Let's stand
[1:49:46] together. Let me read you this paragraph
[1:49:48] here of
[1:49:52] 118. I'm sharing with you
[1:49:54] today
[1:49:56] heavenly knowledge.
[1:50:00] Here's something to console
[1:50:02] us. Here's something that
[1:50:06] encourages. Out of weakness and
[1:50:09] humility, God chooses the people to
[1:50:13] build his kingdom out
[1:50:15] of. If we ever get to heaven and if we
[1:50:19] ever stand in the presence of God with
[1:50:23] his
[1:50:24] church, we'll stand in a bunch of people
[1:50:28] that's been
[1:50:29] weak and rejected
[1:50:33] and cast out by the world and know it
[1:50:36] nothings,
[1:50:38] which is the opposite of course of a
[1:50:40] knowit all.
[1:50:44] Isn't it strange that God likened us to
[1:50:47] sheep? And a sheep is the most helpless
[1:50:49] thing there is. There's nothing so
[1:50:52] insufficient as defense than the sheep.
[1:50:56] A rabbit can run. A
[1:50:58] squirrel can get in a tree. A dog can
[1:51:02] bite. A lion can tear. A horse can kick.
[1:51:07] A bird can fly. But a sheep stands
[1:51:13] helpless. That's the way God wants us.
[1:51:18] Realize that we are totally
[1:51:21] insufficient. Then God takes that
[1:51:25] person. Listen, these words, friends,
[1:51:27] they're
[1:51:28] profound. And begins to mold
[1:51:32] himself. Now, not just dos and don'ts.
[1:51:35] Don't take the virtues as dos and
[1:51:36] don'ts. God begins to mold himself. With
[1:51:40] what? Faith, virtue, knowledge,
[1:51:42] temperance, patience. God molds himself
[1:51:47] into that person and makes his hands do
[1:51:50] what God would have his hands to do.
[1:51:53] Makes his lips speak what God's
[1:51:56] lips would
[1:51:59] speak because they're not
[1:52:01] his, they're God's.
[1:52:04] Amen.
[1:52:06] He begins to build a character. He
[1:52:09] begins to take this
[1:52:10] weakness and to make his own
[1:52:16] self. Anybody want that in your life
[1:52:20] more than anything else in this
[1:52:25] world? This is bride right here.
[1:52:30] Rapturing material.
[1:52:34] Look at all the brides revival so-called
[1:52:36] that we've had through the years of the
[1:52:39] message. All the doctrines, all the
[1:52:41] great things that's happened, supposedly
[1:52:44] great, and they all pointed to one
[1:52:47] man. Then this one man, everybody
[1:52:50] rallied around
[1:52:51] him. And then guys that were his
[1:52:54] favorites, he would send them out to
[1:52:56] here and there and there. Sometimes
[1:52:58] there'd be two or three of
[1:53:01] them. Where are they all
[1:53:04] today? Where's all them great brides
[1:53:07] revivals? And what's it
[1:53:10] producing? Unless you come to our
[1:53:12] church, unless you believe what we
[1:53:14] believe. I'll tell you one thing now.
[1:53:15] This is the bride right here. And we got
[1:53:17] our buddy. And if you're going to be in
[1:53:19] the bride, you got to come and say what
[1:53:20] we say. And we're going to tell you what
[1:53:22] to say cuz we know what's right. And and
[1:53:25] you don't. You're ignorant. You're just
[1:53:26] ignorant. And you you got to listen to
[1:53:28] us.
[1:53:31] I don't want that stuff myself.
[1:53:35] I want to know what he's got to say.
[1:53:37] Yeah.
[1:53:39] This is what I hear him
[1:53:41] say,
[1:53:43] Donnie. Let me mold myself in you.
[1:53:47] I'm good at excuses. Oh boy. I've got
[1:53:50] them
[1:53:52] down. I've always had them since a boy.
[1:53:55] Yeah. When you start preaching when
[1:53:57] you're a boy, I guess you're going to,
[1:53:58] you know. Oh, yeah. I'm better around
[1:54:00] him now than I was when you first called
[1:54:02] me. I gave him all the reasons why I
[1:54:03] couldn't preach. But now I've been
[1:54:06] around a lot longer. I've got a whole
[1:54:07] lot better reasons now why I can't
[1:54:09] preach. Cuz I'm too
[1:54:13] old. Nobody said amen to
[1:54:17] that. What's
[1:54:20] yours? What's yours? Kisses. We've all
[1:54:23] got them. You might as well admit it.
[1:54:24] Yeah. Well, if it wasn't for brother
[1:54:26] Harvey, I'd be closer to God. Well, what
[1:54:28] should we do? Vote Brother Harvey out
[1:54:29] and tell him to stay home. What if it
[1:54:32] wasn't for my wife? What if it was if it
[1:54:33] wasn't for It's the music. It's the It's
[1:54:35] the music.
[1:54:38] Let's just be honest. It's us.
[1:54:44] You're looking at the reason
[1:54:46] today why your pastor is no closer to
[1:54:49] God than he is.
[1:54:55] Keep on here.
[1:54:57] Right here's the reason. Yes. Anybody
[1:55:01] else honest enough to say,
[1:55:05] "Why do you hunger, children? Why do you
[1:55:08] thirst? It's the father trying to make
[1:55:11] it known to
[1:55:12] you. But you let so many things of life,
[1:55:16] business and working and going here and
[1:55:19] doing this and doing that, just get in
[1:55:23] the way.
[1:55:26] bow rich if you
[1:55:35] would. Heavenly Father,
[1:55:38] we bow our heads to the dust of the
[1:55:41] earth from once our bodies were
[1:55:44] taken. If time goes on long enough,
[1:55:47] we'll all go back to
[1:55:49] that. Lord Jesus, we believe that there
[1:55:52] will be a people on the earth that will
[1:55:55] defy
[1:55:57] death and they will be
[1:56:00] changed. I trust today that I believe
[1:56:03] with all my heart that I'm one of those
[1:56:05] that will be a part of this bride.
[1:56:08] Whether I go by the way of the grave or
[1:56:10] I'm alive, it doesn't matter. Whatever
[1:56:11] your will is for my life, it's what I
[1:56:13] want.
[1:56:14] But I believe I'm preaching to people
[1:56:17] that are that same type of people that
[1:56:20] we read about here in your
[1:56:22] word. We have our faults and our
[1:56:25] failures and somehow we're we're really
[1:56:29] good at just putting it off. That
[1:56:32] commitment of our whole heart and
[1:56:36] soul waiting for
[1:56:39] this. Most of us started when we were
[1:56:42] kids. Well, when I get to the eighth
[1:56:45] grade, I I'll do it. Then we start at
[1:56:48] high school. Well, it's too hard right
[1:56:50] now until I get out of high
[1:56:52] school. Then when they get out of high
[1:56:54] school, then they've got a career
[1:56:55] looking in front of them and they go to
[1:56:57] ETSU or they go here, there, there. So,
[1:56:59] well, once I get out of college, I'll
[1:57:00] give God everything. I just can't do it
[1:57:01] now. I've got so many so many studies
[1:57:03] and I've got so much to do.
[1:57:06] and they get their degree and they get a
[1:57:09] good job and then they just simply
[1:57:12] change the excuse. Well, now I've I've
[1:57:14] got to make a living. I'm a man and I I
[1:57:16] want to I want to have a place. I want
[1:57:18] to get married. I want to have a family,
[1:57:19] but I've got to work hard. I've got to
[1:57:20] get my position. I've got to get
[1:57:22] everything
[1:57:23] ready. Help us,
[1:57:25] Lord. Why would we delay one more day
[1:57:30] after hearing this
[1:57:32] today? Help us, Jesus.
[1:57:36] Lord, help
[1:57:38] me. I've got a list of excuses a mile
[1:57:41] long.
[1:57:42] Lord, I as young as I used to be. I
[1:57:45] don't like to travel like I used to.
[1:57:48] I've got a lot of scars. I've been lied
[1:57:50] on, cheated, treated like a dog, and
[1:57:52] this that and the
[1:57:54] other. And none of them hold
[1:57:57] water. And all you say is, "Give me all
[1:57:59] you have, Donnie." That's what you're
[1:58:02] sent to these young people today.
[1:58:05] You understand their schedule. You
[1:58:08] understand going to school. You
[1:58:10] understand all of
[1:58:11] that. But help them to realize you will
[1:58:15] take even the time of them driving from
[1:58:19] home to school of a morning. Instead of
[1:58:22] listening to a talk show, instead of
[1:58:25] listening to some kind of something or
[1:58:27] another on the radio which benefits them
[1:58:28] nothing, you will take that time, that
[1:58:32] 12, 15 minutes, 20, whatever it is, soon
[1:58:35] as they pull out of their driveway and
[1:58:38] they go to talking to you, Jesus, I love
[1:58:40] you today. I need your help, Lord. I've
[1:58:43] got these tests and things, but Lord,
[1:58:46] really, I just want to say it ain't math
[1:58:49] is not my issue. Algebra isn't my issue.
[1:58:52] I need to learn how to surrender.
[1:58:55] Father, oh, if they only knew what that
[1:58:58] meant to
[1:58:59] you. You loved Israel so much that you
[1:59:03] had Moses to build a tent, a
[1:59:06] tabernacle, so you could come down among
[1:59:09] them and just listen at them
[1:59:12] talk. You wanted to hear the farmer talk
[1:59:15] about his crops. You wanted to hear the
[1:59:18] mother talk about her children and the
[1:59:21] sicknesses and things as Den was in the
[1:59:23] home and how to make better
[1:59:25] bread. You heard the priests talking
[1:59:28] about the sacrifice and the men going
[1:59:31] down to the farmers
[1:59:33] market. You loved
[1:59:36] it cuz you love being with human
[1:59:40] beings, especially those who love you
[1:59:44] back. Help us,
[1:59:48] Jesus. We confess to you today. We have
[1:59:50] a whole train load of weaknesses.
[1:59:55] All kinds of reasons why you shouldn't
[1:59:56] even love us. Why you shouldn't even use
[1:59:59] us. All kinds of reasons why we could
[2:00:01] never be able to do
[2:00:03] it. But Lord, we want to lay all that
[2:00:06] before your throne
[2:00:07] today and say, "Take us, Lord
[2:00:11] Jesus. Use us, Father."
[2:00:14] instead of bringing you Lord why I can't
[2:00:16] do it. I just want to say to you today,
[2:00:19] Father, if there's anything I can do to
[2:00:22] help your people, help me. There's
[2:00:25] anything these youth can do, these
[2:00:28] adults, our church, help us, Lord. Help
[2:00:33] us to
[2:00:34] surrender everything we are to you.
[2:00:38] Father, would you take your hand and lay
[2:00:40] over on the person standing by
[2:00:43] you? I want you to think some of our
[2:00:45] youths are standing here today and
[2:00:47] they're facing very difficult things in
[2:00:48] their
[2:00:49] life. Some of they got family members
[2:00:52] that's battling for their
[2:00:54] life. Maybe others are they got
[2:00:58] brothers, sisters, siblings, whatever
[2:00:59] that's they're troubled for them because
[2:01:02] they can see the direction they're
[2:01:03] going. They're not closer to God. are
[2:01:05] getting farther away. Friends, maybe
[2:01:07] young people that used to sit here with
[2:01:09] us and you've got them on your heart
[2:01:11] today because they've become cold and
[2:01:15] indifferent. Let's just offer a word of
[2:01:17] prayer for each other, shall
[2:01:20] we? Brother John, would you come up my
[2:01:22] brother
[2:01:23] and pray for the
[2:01:30] people? Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] While you're praying for them, I want
[2:01:35] you to put your hand on me. Pray for me
[2:01:37] as well.
[2:01:40] Oh Lord
[2:01:41] Jesus. Yes, dear God. Father, how timely
[2:01:45] your word is, Father. Help us, Lord,
[2:01:47] today. Oh Lord Jesus, how we're
[2:01:49] thankful, Lord Jesus, that you speak to
[2:01:51] our hearts, Lord. Father, oh Father God,
[2:01:54] you see what my brothers, my sisters,
[2:01:57] Lord Jesus, are going through, Lord, the
[2:02:00] purpose. Father God, we know that your
[2:02:02] word never misses, Lord. Oh, Father God,
[2:02:05] I pray for my brothers and sisters,
[2:02:07] Lord, that they would be able to see,
[2:02:09] Lord Jesus, that you're the only hope.
[2:02:12] You're the only good thing that we have,
[2:02:14] Lord. And we lean on you, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:17] Make us small in our own eyes, Lord. Oh,
[2:02:21] Father God, help us to see, Lord Jesus,
[2:02:23] that you're the only good thing in our
[2:02:25] lives, Lord, that that can can make
[2:02:28] stuff happen. Father, I pray Lord Jesus
[2:02:31] for my brethren. Help him, Lord Jesus,
[2:02:33] never to get Lord to a place where you
[2:02:36] can't use him, where he thinks he's
[2:02:38] something, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father God,
[2:02:41] you're our all in all, our everything,
[2:02:43] Lord Jesus. And we know, Lord Jesus,
[2:02:47] that the only way we can ever become
[2:02:49] something, Lord, is become so small,
[2:02:51] Lord Jesus. Oh, but Father God, we all
[2:02:55] have this flesh. We all have this thing
[2:02:57] about us, Lord. Oh, Father God, we pray
[2:03:00] that we put it aside, Lord, and look
[2:03:02] unto you, Lord Jesus, the author and the
[2:03:05] finish of our faith, Lord. Not only the
[2:03:07] author and the finisher of our faith,
[2:03:08] Lord, but of our knowledge, Lord, and
[2:03:10] our our loving kindness. All these
[2:03:12] things, Lord, that we know that they're
[2:03:14] gifts that come from you, Father. And
[2:03:16] Lord Jesus, we can't become anything,
[2:03:19] Father, without without looking to you,
[2:03:21] without knowing, Lord Jesus, that that
[2:03:24] it's going to take you. Father, I pray
[2:03:26] you'd be with us and help us, Lord, use
[2:03:29] us according to your will, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:32] Oh, Father, help us to become small,
[2:03:34] Lord, that you might be elevated,
[2:03:36] Father, in our lives. We ask, Lord
[2:03:38] Jesus, you'd be with us. Help us, Lord.
[2:03:41] We give you all the praise and the honor
[2:03:43] and the glory, Lord. Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:45] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:03:47] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. It's
[2:03:51] me. It's me, oh
[2:03:54] Lord, standing in the need of
[2:03:59] prayer. It's
[2:04:01] me. It's me, oh

[2:06:25] love with Jesus.
[2:06:31] Falling in love with
[2:06:37] Jesus was the best thing I've ever ever
[2:06:46] done. In his
[2:06:49] arms I feel
[2:06:54] protected in his
[2:06:57] arms. Never disconnected.
[2:07:02] know in his
[2:07:05] arms I feel
[2:07:08] protected. There's no place I'd rather
[2:07:13] rather
[2:07:18] be falling in love with Jesus.

[2:07:28] love with
[2:07:33] Jesus. Falling in

[2:07:53] feel protected.
[2:07:58] In his
[2:07:59] arms, never
[2:08:02] disconnected.
[2:08:05] No. In his
[2:08:07] arms I feel
[2:08:11] protected. There's no place I'd rather
[2:08:15] rather be.
[2:08:21] Falling in love with
[2:08:28] Jesus. Falling in love with
