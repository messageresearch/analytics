[39:46] greatness but he hides it by the
[39:50] Simplicity that expresses it
[39:53] in so Moses when he writes this in the
[39:57] beginning God created the
[40:00] Heaven and the
[40:02] Earth and you would
[40:05] think that there would
[40:07] be something about both of them that
[40:11] would be the same
[40:13] size what would be the
[40:16] comparison between the Heaven and the
[40:20] Earth let's show them
[40:23] brothers let's look at something here
[40:25] that it's called the p
[40:27] Blue
[40:29] Dot taken February the 14th
[40:34] 1990 from voer
[40:37] one space probe as it goes out to
[40:41] Adventure out and see what could be
[40:44] found is an approximate distance of
[40:49] 3.7 billion
[40:54] miles and most all of us some of kids
[40:57] were of course but most all of
[40:59] us are right there on that
[41:05] dot so God created the
[41:08] Heaven and the
[41:13] dot you know in our minds we think why
[41:16] would you even put a dot in the same
[41:22] verse as an expanse of a universe which
[41:25] they don't even measure by m anymore but
[41:28] what they call
[41:30] Parasect so it's so far beyond miles
[41:33] they had to come up with new words to be
[41:36] able to know how to measure it so God
[41:38] made the
[41:40] heavens and the blue
[41:43] dot and the blue
[41:47] dot the Earth was without form and
[41:51] void and
[41:53] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[41:58] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[42:01] face of the
[42:03] waters and God said let there be
[42:07] light and there was
[42:09] light and God saw the light that it was
[42:13] good and God divided the light from the
[42:16] darkness and God called the
[42:19] light not stars or moons but day God
[42:25] called the light day
[42:27] and the
[42:28] Darkness he called
[42:32] night now what I find amazing is this is
[42:34] in the beginning but when we come back
[42:37] into the Eighth Day and the city you're
[42:40] going to move
[42:42] into there was no night
[42:47] there so you see when God in the
[42:50] beginning started bringing this into
[42:52] view there was something then that
[42:55] wasn't in eternity
[42:58] there was no
[42:59] night so when we come back into that
[43:02] Eighth Day and John looked and he saw it
[43:04] and he said there was no night
[43:08] there so
[43:10] night is only for
[43:13] time amen just like sometimes our
[43:15] spiritual nights aren't you glad there's
[43:18] a morning coming when there is no more
[43:21] night and the evening and the morning
[43:25] were the first day Genesis CH 2 verse
[43:32] 4 these are the
[43:36] generations of the
[43:38] heavens and of the
[43:42] earth Generations look at what that word
[43:45] means
[43:48] descendants
[43:50] proceedings
[43:53] genealogies a genealogical list of ones
[43:58] descendants begetting account of Heaven
[44:02] in a metaphorical sense so these are the
[44:06] generations of the heavens and the
[44:09] Earths so it would be like my
[44:13] grandfather begot Don Reagan Don Reagan
[44:17] begot Donnie Reagan Donnie Reagan begot
[44:21] Alicia and Erica same with your parents
[44:25] and your genealogy but where in the
[44:28] world would the heavens have
[44:31] genealogies or
[44:33] Generations or the earth the earth also
[44:37] has Generations so what is it it's a
[44:40] successive order so one leads into the
[44:43] other and the other and the other now
[44:47] remember what God is
[44:48] doing these are the generations of the
[44:51] heavens and of the Earth again he puts
[44:53] the
[44:55] heavens and the blue
[44:57] dot in the same line so you see those of
[45:00] you that struggle and think are not very
[45:03] important and you're not very well known
[45:07] or maybe you think that God somehow
[45:10] bypassed you and he was giving out great
[45:13] gifts and great
[45:14] things but look at what such a tiny tiny
[45:19] spot and God Likens it and brings it up
[45:22] on an
[45:23] equivalency of heavens
[45:27] so the next time you feel sorry for
[45:29] yourself smack yourself in the face and
[45:30] say shut
[45:33] up you are important to
[45:37] God are there any of us that feel like
[45:39] we could be just a DOT I mean look the
[45:42] farther out you go whenever you look at
[45:44] what we saw here it would be like an ink
[45:48] pen and you would take and make a DOT on
[45:52] a piece of paper in comparison to the
[45:56] plan
[45:57] that are out there if you've looked at
[45:59] any the charts and you know they'll take
[46:01] the Earth and then they'll compare the
[46:02] Earth to Saturn and Uranus and all them
[46:05] different ones and the farther out they
[46:06] go into the universe the smaller and the
[46:09] smaller that the Earth becomes until
[46:11] eventually the Earth actually
[46:14] disappears in relevance compared to
[46:18] what's
[46:19] there and yet it is the future home of
[46:24] the Heavenly
[46:25] bridegroom and the the Earthly
[46:31] bride Moses says these are the
[46:33] generations of the heavens of the earth
[46:35] when they were
[46:36] created in the day the Lord God made the
[46:41] Earth notice how he switches it
[46:44] around made the
[46:48] earth and the
[46:51] heavens
[46:54] huh well praise the Lord
[46:58] and may like to be remembered today as
[47:00] we
[47:01] pray want to give you just a little bit
[47:03] of update on brother Larry Elliott
[47:05] surgery went good the doctors said it
[47:07] was a success and we're certainly
[47:09] grateful for that our brother's still in
[47:11] recovery I talk to him and text him
[47:14] again this morning text him and and
[47:17] we're so grateful that the Lord's been
[47:19] with him certainly just need to remember
[47:21] his strength that the Lord will just you
[47:23] know bring him back where he needs to be
[47:26] also have a prayer CL today for sister
[47:28] Ruth Ward she has some needs in her body
[47:30] anybody else have a request on your
[47:32] heart
[47:36] today heavenly father as
[47:39] we look into your
[47:42] word it helps us to realize in one sense
[47:46] of the word it's a
[47:49] paradox your greatness makes us feel so
[47:53] small but yet the mercy and the grace
[47:56] that you you've given to us helps us to
[47:59] see how much you love us and care for
[48:03] us I pray father that you would take
[48:07] your word today and anoint the people to
[48:10] be able to receive from it Lord help me
[48:12] to be able to get out of the
[48:14] way dear God I ask that you'd be mindful
[48:18] of all the needs of your children father
[48:21] this prayer call for our sister Ruth
[48:23] Ward you see her needs Lord and I pray
[48:26] that you just be mindful of her Lord
[48:29] we're so thankful that you've been with
[48:31] brother Larry and he was able to come
[48:33] through this surgery and several things
[48:35] that they found there in Vanderbilt that
[48:38] our doctors here hadn't even seen or
[48:40] overlooked whichever it was we're
[48:42] grateful that he was able to go there
[48:44] and they were able to help him now we're
[48:46] just asking that You' give him strength
[48:48] in his recovery Lord we have other folks
[48:51] here in the in our church family that
[48:53] have needs of Miracles or they don't
[48:56] just need a touch they need but the
[48:58] miraculous power of God but we believe
[49:01] our God is a miracle working God Amen I
[49:05] pray that you'd minister to every heart
[49:07] here today Father in the name of the
[49:10] Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said
[49:14] amen amen God bless you you may be
[49:20] seated so do you believe with me today
[49:23] that our
[49:24] God is a god of
[49:27] order and
[49:29] structure that the whole universe that
[49:33] we look out into what a little bit that
[49:36] we can see with our naked eye that it
[49:39] just didn't happen to
[49:41] be I don't have a problem with the Big
[49:43] Bang Theory my opinion would just be a
[49:47] little bit different of what caused it
[49:48] to
[49:50] bang I believe it was his spoken
[49:54] word but it didn't just happen on its
[49:58] own and it's not kept by its own power
[50:03] but it's kept by his great word and it's
[50:08] in divine order and of all the planets
[50:12] and the stars and things that are in the
[50:14] heavens there was only
[50:17] one that actually
[50:20] fell and that was because the god of
[50:24] that planet fell first so all the
[50:30] septian that are out there they never
[50:33] fail when man
[50:34] fell because God gave the Earth to human
[50:40] beings and that was his domain his
[50:44] kingdom now what he done was he wrote
[50:47] his first Bible the prophet tells us
[50:50] there was three Bibles the first one was
[50:52] written in the
[50:54] stars and in the heavens
[50:57] so if we could read them we would find
[51:00] out a lot of his great purpose and what
[51:03] he wants to do and what he would demand
[51:08] of them in the heavens that he would
[51:11] demand of us on the earth because that's
[51:14] his first Bible so he wrote redemption
[51:17] in the Stars reconciliation in the Stars
[51:22] he wrote about a dragon that would take
[51:25] his tail and sweep up and pull a third
[51:29] part of the stars out of the heavens
[51:32] that was symbol of course we see that he
[51:36] wrote all types of signs and wonders
[51:39] which man has looked at and been puzzled
[51:42] at for thousands and thousands of years
[51:46] but he also wrote in there about
[51:49] praise and
[51:51] worship and adoration what if God wrote
[51:55] that in the star s and that was his
[51:58] first Bible then I wonder about us being
[52:02] on on this little blue dot how God wants
[52:07] us to live how God wants us to do how
[52:12] God wants us to worship so let's read a
[52:15] few of these places today if you would
[52:17] let's start in Deuteronomy chap 10 verse
[52:20] 14 behold the Heaven and the heaven of
[52:27] Heavens is the Lord's thy God now listen
[52:33] the Heaven and the heaven of the
[52:38] heavens is the Lord's thy God the
[52:43] Earth also so now watch again Moses
[52:47] writing
[52:49] Deuteronomy and the way that God gave it
[52:51] to him was that the
[52:55] heavens count
[52:57] part was actually this blue
[53:01] dot so the
[53:04] heavens and the
[53:06] Earth so it's like this that the heavens
[53:10] was the
[53:12] husband and the Earth was his
[53:16] wife how could you ever compare the
[53:21] two how could you in your right mind now
[53:24] scientists no doubt would like at some
[53:26] of the things we're going to say today
[53:28] and ridicule it but I'm not bringing it
[53:30] to you from an Avenue of science but
[53:33] from the Avenue of God's
[53:35] word behold the Heaven and the heaven of
[53:38] Heavens is the Lord's thy God the Earth
[53:43] also with all that therein is Psalms 115
[53:49] verse 16 the heaven even the heavens are
[53:56] the Lord Lords but the Earth has he
[54:00] given to the children of men but if
[54:04] you'd like to study it sometime from the
[54:06] old and the New Testament and you'll
[54:08] watch that God would bring them and Link
[54:12] them together the heaven sometimes he'd
[54:15] say it's singular sometimes he would
[54:17] make it plural the Heaven and the Earth
[54:20] or the heavens and the Earth or the
[54:24] heaven of the heavens
[54:27] and the Earth so he's constantly
[54:30] referring to all this greatness way out
[54:34] here which is man still is just now
[54:36] finding out about and then he links it
[54:40] to this little tiny blue
[54:43] dot as if though there is some sort of
[54:48] equivalence between the
[54:51] two I wonder if we've missed something
[54:55] through all these years
[54:57] that we have sought for greatness we've
[55:02] sought to be big and
[55:05] wonderful we measure that by how great
[55:09] we are of man's
[55:11] measure and S of the way God would
[55:14] measure you believe with me that God
[55:16] inspired Moses to write these things so
[55:19] I don't think that Moses was riding it
[55:21] out of ignorance do you and that Moses
[55:24] didn't understand the relevance between
[55:26] the size of the universe and the size of
[55:29] the Earth but I believe that he wrote it
[55:31] by the spirit of God so there was this
[55:34] great mystery that was written in the
[55:37] stars when the logos started expanding
[55:42] the creation of god notice Psalms
[55:46] 147:4 he tell
[55:52] us the number of the Stars
[55:57] he calleth them
[56:00] all by their
[56:02] names now if there is one
[56:06] septian or even two or three or four how
[56:09] many ever there are
[56:12] septian and your father made every one
[56:15] of them and gave every one of them their
[56:19] own
[56:21] name and he knows their names
[56:27] now can you imagine then here they are
[56:30] out in the
[56:31] universe their Glory all that God gave
[56:35] them and he calls them by their name so
[56:38] he didn't just give them that name but
[56:40] he calls them so every now and then
[56:44] father must say something to
[56:49] Mars
[56:52] Jupiter all
[56:54] these thousands times thousands times
[56:58] thousands trillions of galaxies and he
[57:02] refers to them by name hey
[57:08] Orion hey
[57:15] Pluto and then somehow the devil wants
[57:18] to convince us he's forgotten about us
[57:22] in our struggles
[57:27] and of none of the rest of these planets
[57:30] in the entirety of the
[57:32] scripture does God ever bring them on an
[57:37] equivalent
[57:38] basis of the heavens or simply a star in
[57:43] the
[57:43] heavens but he never Likens Jupiter and
[57:47] the
[57:48] heavens on this same plane or any the
[57:53] rest of them only this little tiny blue
[57:59] dot so remember now he wrote The Mystery
[58:03] of election in the stars and
[58:07] predestination now we might look at
[58:09] Earth and say you know there's been so
[58:12] much on the
[58:14] earth and as I've been looking in the
[58:17] last week or so at some of the the
[58:21] videos that are on YouTube and other
[58:23] places where you can find them of the
[58:26] blood and the devastation that's been
[58:28] over in Western North Carolina and our
[58:31] our part of Tennessee as well and see
[58:35] what has happened and I saw a weather
[58:38] man the other day as it come up on the
[58:41] Weather Channel on my
[58:42] phone and this man was saying that in
[58:45] parts of Western North Carolina that
[58:49] 90% of the trees were destroyed and
[58:54] annihilated
[58:56] and I heard him and he said that that by
[59:00] the loss of this amount of trees it
[59:04] would actually affect the weather in the
[59:07] coming years in Western North
[59:10] Carolina and then he explains how that
[59:13] would work because the roots of the
[59:16] trees pull the moisture out of the earth
[59:20] it comes up to the trunk and the
[59:22] branches of the tree then the moisture
[59:25] goes out of the leaves it's released in
[59:28] the air and it will help create rain it
[59:34] would also affect thunderstorms in the
[59:37] mountains in Western North
[59:40] Carolina Carol and I wrote up the road
[59:42] yesterday up to Irwin and up 26 where
[59:45] they've got if you've been there a lane
[59:48] open to where you can go through and
[59:50] looking at all of the mass destruction
[59:54] and the devastation I told her as we
[59:56] were driving I said you look and and see
[59:58] what it is the Earth is bearing her
[1:00:03] scars she's ready for a body
[1:00:08] change now a lot of this that happened
[1:00:11] and that weatherman was saying that some
[1:00:13] of the trees that were destroyed were 50
[1:00:16] 60 70 80 90 120 years
[1:00:20] old and it would be Generations before
[1:00:23] they would ever be replaced thought
[1:00:26] buddy let me tell you one thing the
[1:00:28] millennium's coming before that'll ever
[1:00:30] happen but the Earth will carry these
[1:00:34] scars of what this hurricane Helen did
[1:00:38] to it you understand me so the Earth
[1:00:42] itself is mirroring what the bride is
[1:00:46] also doing in that we though we are
[1:00:50] Redeemed by the grace of God and our
[1:00:53] souls have crossed over the line and
[1:00:55] will never be lost again but yet in our
[1:00:59] Spirits in our minds in our our
[1:01:03] mortality our makeup we carry the scars
[1:01:08] of our
[1:01:09] humanity and as we drove up the road
[1:01:12] looking at it and we came to there a few
[1:01:14] weeks ago from the youth camp and I was
[1:01:17] I absolutely marveled as I saw the
[1:01:20] thousands of trees that were along
[1:01:22] beside the road that were visible that
[1:01:24] you could see and yet within two and a
[1:01:27] half three weeks from the last time Caro
[1:01:29] and I came through there thousands and
[1:01:32] thousands of those trees had been burned
[1:01:36] and they were they were gone they were
[1:01:38] just absolutely gone so what is man
[1:01:42] doing Lake Lure over in North Carolina
[1:01:45] those of you that are familiar with that
[1:01:47] Lake quite a beautiful spot and whenever
[1:01:51] the hurricane got done they said that
[1:01:54] there was 50 ft deep of debris of logs
[1:02:02] bushes trees boats all kinds of things
[1:02:07] 50 feet deep in that Lake but within a
[1:02:12] short period of time they've already
[1:02:15] went through and and taken all of that
[1:02:18] out and they listed the tons of debris
[1:02:22] that they had taken out to help the lake
[1:02:25] pure
[1:02:26] terfy and as I looked at that I thought
[1:02:29] you know man has this within him the
[1:02:33] ability when chaos will strike to try to
[1:02:38] bring it back to its Eden Beauty and I I
[1:02:40] saw a a part person as they was talking
[1:02:43] about it and and there was videoing them
[1:02:46] and they stepped out into a precipice
[1:02:48] and it was a woman and she said I used
[1:02:50] to walk right here and she said this is
[1:02:53] one of the most beautiful places and the
[1:02:56] woman started broke down and started
[1:02:58] crying and she said to look at it now
[1:03:01] she said there's a
[1:03:03] 30t deep crevice that's here and the
[1:03:08] river washed it out and took 30 feet of
[1:03:12] soil
[1:03:13] out in my mind as this has happened in
[1:03:17] our our part of the country here I I've
[1:03:20] thought and wondered what it must have
[1:03:22] been like in the Andel luian destruction
[1:03:26] when Noah and his family stepped out of
[1:03:29] the
[1:03:30] Ark and we know the Earth still Bears
[1:03:34] the
[1:03:35] scars of that original
[1:03:38] flood and several miles deep in the
[1:03:41] eastern part of Canada they have drilled
[1:03:45] down by core drills and have found
[1:03:49] little sea
[1:03:51] creatures that have been buried in miles
[1:03:55] of of all this and she Bears within her
[1:03:59] core the
[1:04:01] scars of man's
[1:04:04] sin but why wouldn't God just take the
[1:04:07] Earth and say you know what it would be
[1:04:11] easier for me just to make a new
[1:04:16] one she's got so much that man has done
[1:04:21] God says in the Book of Revelation he
[1:04:23] will destroy them that destroys the
[1:04:29] Earth would not it be easier if God just
[1:04:33] spoke and another Earth come into view
[1:04:38] that did not bear the scars in her core
[1:04:42] and all that she's bore through the
[1:04:45] images and looking at the Andel luian
[1:04:47] destruction and the great earthquake
[1:04:49] that happened 2,000 years ago when he
[1:04:52] died and the earthquakes that's going to
[1:04:55] happen under the six seal why would God
[1:04:58] just not start all over
[1:05:01] again because in the earth rise and fall
[1:05:06] in her bearing the Judgment of man's sin
[1:05:11] is wrote The Mystery of
[1:05:15] reconciliation and
[1:05:17] Redemption you see the Earth is the only
[1:05:20] planet that God calls by
[1:05:24] name so so he spoke her name and her
[1:05:29] name is in the Book of Life the
[1:05:33] Bible so God cannot erase her name
[1:05:37] Hallelujah he cannot erase her name and
[1:05:41] come up with a new thought that he will
[1:05:44] live on that planet with his bride but
[1:05:48] instead he will redeem
[1:05:52] her oh can you imagine children when
[1:05:56] whenever the sick seal finally Fades
[1:06:00] out the battle of Armageddon will
[1:06:05] rage the Lord Jesus and his bride will
[1:06:10] come back upon the Earth and when the
[1:06:12] enemy has been
[1:06:15] annihilated and he lifts his
[1:06:19] bride
[1:06:20] Hallelujah and the spirit of God will
[1:06:23] allow man to to break into that Realm by
[1:06:28] atomic
[1:06:29] fire and seven of course is a number of
[1:06:34] completion at the End of the Age then
[1:06:38] God will allow us to go back remember
[1:06:41] God was called out of his
[1:06:45] Millennium in the Garden of
[1:06:48] Eden and we know that God made the man
[1:06:51] and placed him there and then God
[1:06:54] entered into his rest or his
[1:06:58] Millennium but man's fall called our
[1:07:02] father out of his
[1:07:05] Millennium and God had to stop the
[1:07:09] Millennium and put it on
[1:07:12] hold but we cannot jump from day six
[1:07:17] which is where we're living at in the
[1:07:19] increment of time we cannot jump from
[1:07:22] day six to day eight
[1:07:26] but we must live through the seventh day
[1:07:31] so the seventh day will be
[1:07:35] restarted but it will not just be father
[1:07:39] and Adam and Eve alone on the Earth but
[1:07:43] there will be millions of people who
[1:07:46] will be on the earth and we will be here
[1:07:49] by the grace of God in glorified
[1:07:52] bodies then when God brings man back to
[1:07:57] his spot man's domain will match
[1:08:03] himself now watch whenever man fell
[1:08:06] Earth took on the image of man so God in
[1:08:11] order to redeem the Earth God had to
[1:08:16] take the image of Earth upon himself he
[1:08:21] did not just become man for your sake
[1:08:24] alone but he took on the image of Earth
[1:08:29] that Earth could be redeemed the devil
[1:08:34] might say the same thing about you and I
[1:08:36] oh why don't God just get rid of us and
[1:08:39] get somebody else he cannot do it aren't
[1:08:42] you glad today oh how many times have we
[1:08:45] felt like that we have failed so much
[1:08:48] and so bitterly and brought so much
[1:08:51] reproach on God and just think God why
[1:08:52] don't you just cast me away and just
[1:08:55] raise somebody else up that can save you
[1:08:58] but he can no more destroy you than he
[1:09:00] can destroy
[1:09:03] himself the Earth Bears within her
[1:09:07] metalogical story and her metallurgical
[1:09:10] story in her environmental Story the
[1:09:15] fall and the rise of man as we dig down
[1:09:19] and I saw just the other day where just
[1:09:22] a few years ago that they had broke into
[1:09:25] under the surface of the Earth of what
[1:09:29] we know as the Dome of the Rock and the
[1:09:31] City of David on the outside lay on the
[1:09:33] outside of where the Dome of the Rock is
[1:09:36] that they now have finally opened it up
[1:09:39] to just an element of the public but
[1:09:42] they have went down many many feet
[1:09:45] beneath the Dome of the Rock they got
[1:09:48] great big steel beams and all kinds of
[1:09:50] things under it and I I saw a video of
[1:09:53] it the other day and this camera team
[1:09:55] was allowed to go down under it and they
[1:09:58] have actually found the original
[1:10:01] pavement that was there and the they
[1:10:04] said it was the very street that the
[1:10:07] Lord Jesus walked upon himself and yet
[1:10:11] it laid beneath all of that rubble and
[1:10:15] big stones that was part of the original
[1:10:18] foundation of the city of Jerusalem I'm
[1:10:21] talking about many many tons in one
[1:10:24] stone just absolutely unimaginable to
[1:10:27] the human mind but yet where did all
[1:10:29] that history lay so they found the
[1:10:32] signant Ring Of The Scribe of Jeremiah
[1:10:37] whose name was Baro Baro look in your
[1:10:41] book of Jeremiah when you get home and
[1:10:43] they found one of his signant rings so
[1:10:46] there it was they found a wedding ring
[1:10:48] they found all types of things of course
[1:10:51] the Arabs and the Palestinians don't
[1:10:54] like them finding them sort of things
[1:10:57] because it proves Israel has an identity
[1:11:00] there beneath all of that dirt and
[1:11:04] that's what the devil don't want you and
[1:11:06] I to see he don't want us digging past
[1:11:09] the dirt to find out the identity that
[1:11:12] lays down inside of our soul we have a
[1:11:15] wedding band that was slipped on our
[1:11:18] ring on our finger before the foundation
[1:11:21] of the world it don't bear the name of
[1:11:25] Rook or Donnie or Jim but it Bears the
[1:11:28] name of the seed of God Amen oh think
[1:11:33] that God through all the years knew what
[1:11:36] the Earth would be and even in its
[1:11:39] creation it is created with this element
[1:11:43] that God knew one day when man would
[1:11:46] come upon the Earth that he would
[1:11:48] actually forfeit his right to this Earth
[1:11:51] and the Earth which stood upright in a
[1:11:53] perfect uh axis no tilt of it one way or
[1:11:56] the other God knew that when man come on
[1:11:59] the earth that the Earth would fall so
[1:12:02] God made the Earth with the capability
[1:12:05] of being changed from this over this way
[1:12:08] to 23 degree angle til and still be able
[1:12:12] to operate and it's the same with you
[1:12:14] and I don't you understand what we're
[1:12:16] longing for we're longing for this but
[1:12:20] even though we've been saved Sanctified
[1:12:23] filled with the Holy Ghost we're still
[1:12:26] here oh yeah we're wobbling and we don't
[1:12:29] understand why this goes on and that
[1:12:31] goes on and there's something down
[1:12:33] inside of us that is groaning oh if we
[1:12:36] could hear the Earth today here in East
[1:12:39] Tennessee it hasn't been that many
[1:12:41] months ago the beautiful trees were
[1:12:43] putting forth their leaves and look at
[1:12:45] them now the very image of death all
[1:12:48] around them and they are groaning and
[1:12:51] they are crying the Earth was not made
[1:12:54] to bear this but yet God knew that she
[1:12:58] would listen at this in Nehemiah 9:6
[1:13:03] thou even thou Lord art the Lord alone
[1:13:07] thou Hast made Heaven the heaven of
[1:13:10] Heavens with all their host the Earth
[1:13:14] and all things that are therein the Seas
[1:13:17] and all that is therein and thou
[1:13:19] preservest them all and the host of
[1:13:24] Heaven worship us
[1:13:28] thee now you and I cannot understand
[1:13:32] star
[1:13:35] language I don't understand tree
[1:13:39] language I don't understand dog language
[1:13:43] horse language cow
[1:13:47] language but God
[1:13:51] does you understand trees
[1:13:55] worship
[1:13:58] god well if a tree does shame on you
[1:14:02] claim to be Christians and you
[1:14:06] don't actually the Earth
[1:14:10] rejoices and so does the heavens look
[1:14:14] with me in 1 Chronicles chap
[1:14:16] 16:31 let the heavens be glad and let
[1:14:21] the Earth rejoice
[1:14:25] oh my aren't you glad the Earth is not
[1:14:28] waiting until the Eighth Day to Rejoice
[1:14:30] but the Earth can Rejoice under her
[1:14:34] struggles and all the difficulty that
[1:14:36] she's going through remember this is the
[1:14:39] Bible that's written in the
[1:14:42] skies watch again in Psalms
[1:14:45] 895 and the heavens shall praise thy
[1:14:49] wonders oh Lord Thy Faithfulness also in
[1:14:54] the congre ation of the Saints Psalms
[1:14:58] 9611 let the heavens rejoice and let the
[1:15:03] Earth be glad Let the Sea
[1:15:09] Roar and the fullness thereof so when
[1:15:12] you stand by the Sea and it's making its
[1:15:17] noise actually it's worshiping
[1:15:23] God praise the lord it's roaring out
[1:15:28] praise be to God and you know it must
[1:15:31] make the devil so mad because he can't
[1:15:33] make the sea stop praising it must upset
[1:15:37] him because the sea not one day has ever
[1:15:41] worship the devil the sea not one day
[1:15:44] nor the leaves on the trees nor the
[1:15:46] stars in the heavens have ever worship
[1:15:49] the devil they have never give him one
[1:15:52] moment of Praise oh how it ought to
[1:15:54] shame us as people of God that we want
[1:15:57] to act like the devil is so big and so
[1:15:59] mighty but a little old Leaf could tell
[1:16:02] you shame on you for praising the devil
[1:16:05] shame on you for making the devil sound
[1:16:07] like he's omnipotent and that little old
[1:16:10] Leaf comes out in the spring and he
[1:16:12] hangs on there and he's only got a short
[1:16:15] time to live but he will praise God in
[1:16:17] the sunshine he'll praise God in the
[1:16:20] rain he'll praise God in the storms and
[1:16:23] even when he's falling off off in the
[1:16:27] fall and he went from a green to a
[1:16:30] beautiful bright orange and as he falls
[1:16:33] off the tree praise be to God there will
[1:16:38] come another spring and I will be sucked
[1:16:42] up again by the roots of the tree and I
[1:16:45] will come back next year or year after
[1:16:48] next there is a resurrection for me I
[1:16:52] will live again I will PA children if
[1:16:56] they do that what about us as the people
[1:16:59] of
[1:17:01] God oh thank you Lord Jesus let the
[1:17:06] heavens rejoice and the Earth be glad
[1:17:09] Let the Sea Roar and the fullness of I I
[1:17:13] love this one that David said in Psalms
[1:17:15] 148:3 praise ye him
[1:17:19] son and
[1:17:22] moon Praise Him all ye
[1:17:26] stars of
[1:17:29] light Praise Him ye heavens of heavens
[1:17:34] and ye
[1:17:36] Waters that be above the
[1:17:40] heavens you mean water Praises
[1:17:46] God he hasth also establish them forever
[1:17:50] and ever he hath made a decree which
[1:17:55] shall not
[1:17:57] pass Isaiah
[1:17:59] 44:23
[1:18:01] sing oh ye
[1:18:04] Heavens praise
[1:18:07] God you mean the
[1:18:10] heavens
[1:18:12] sing they don't sing country music
[1:18:14] though they don't sing rock and roll
[1:18:17] they don't sing rap they don't sing
[1:18:19] Blues what are they singing to almighty
[1:18:23] God as I said I don't understand our
[1:18:25] language I don't understand how the
[1:18:27] heavens sing but according to the word
[1:18:29] of God they sing can you imagine what a
[1:18:31] praise now remember it's written in the
[1:18:33] stars God's Bible is written in the
[1:18:36] stars so if they Praise Him in the
[1:18:38] heavens and have for the ceaseless ages
[1:18:41] what about those of us on the earth that
[1:18:44] are redeemed and the star ain't never fa
[1:18:47] the star ain't never fa the power of God
[1:18:50] the star has never been healed the star
[1:18:53] has never been down on the knees praying
[1:18:56] and the Holy Ghost come in the room
[1:18:57] where it was and the spirit of God just
[1:19:00] energized that Soul all it's ever done
[1:19:03] is worshiped and glistened and shine and
[1:19:06] Just Praise almighty God from the day it
[1:19:08] was created until the very end of time
[1:19:12] and it keeps on praising
[1:19:14] today oh my sing oh ye heavens for the
[1:19:19] Lord has done it
[1:19:23] shout oh oh my goodness
[1:19:26] shout ye lower parts of the
[1:19:32] earth shout ye lower parts of the earth
[1:19:38] amen shout ye lower parts of the
[1:19:45] earth watch how they bounced back and
[1:19:48] forth between heavens and earth and the
[1:19:51] Earth was tied to the heavens and the
[1:19:54] heavens was tied to the Earth the
[1:19:56] heavens worship the inhabitants on the
[1:19:58] earth that are redeemed they ought to
[1:20:01] worship oh my I I feel like if there's
[1:20:03] one thing that so many Christians fall
[1:20:06] short of the glory of God in their daily
[1:20:08] walk with God it's that we don't praise
[1:20:11] Him near enough you should pray oh even
[1:20:14] when I'm not in church especially when
[1:20:17] you're not in church why because I've
[1:20:20] learned this if you will praise him
[1:20:22] every day of your life when you go to
[1:20:25] church I mean you really want to praise
[1:20:27] him then but you watch people that
[1:20:30] hardly ever praise God in church I
[1:20:32] almost guarantee you 95 of a hundred of
[1:20:35] them don't hardly ever praise God during
[1:20:38] the weekday and you are robbing God and
[1:20:41] robbing yourself of a blessing well you
[1:20:44] say what should I praise him for breast
[1:20:47] Life water Family Church Ministry food
[1:20:52] come on somebody friend family we have
[1:20:56] got so much to praise him

[1:21:03] for oh my shout ye lower parts of the
[1:21:09] earth break
[1:21:11] Force into
[1:21:13] singing ye
[1:21:17] mountains all
[1:21:20] forest and every tree
[1:21:25] yeah so you imagine a little Ash A
[1:21:29] Little Elm a little
[1:21:31] sycore and there they stand beside a
[1:21:34] Mighty Oak 110 years old and that Mighty
[1:21:38] O has been through all kinds of Storms

[1:21:41] trials and the Little Oak stand there by
[1:21:44] me what should I do Grandpa what should
[1:21:47] I do praise him praise him in the
[1:21:50] morning praise him in the noon time
[1:21:53] praise him when the Sun going down oh
[1:21:56] but here comes the storm here comes the
[1:21:58] storm what can I do hold on son hold on
[1:22:02] that's what's kept me through the storms
[1:22:04] of life that God pled by Roots down in
[1:22:07] this soil of the earth I am here to
[1:22:09] serve God's purpose and a hurricane
[1:22:12] can't knock me down a tornado can't
[1:22:14] knock me down unless it's my time to go
[1:22:16] come on somebody and if I do I will
[1:22:20] leave my legacy behind if time were to
[1:22:23] go on every one of these trees that have
[1:22:26] been destroyed there will be another and
[1:22:28] another and another that will come up so
[1:22:31] I say to you the Lord God took Paul but
[1:22:35] because of the way he lived and the
[1:22:37] gospel he preached there was another
[1:22:39] little Oak and another little Oak and
[1:22:41] another little Timothy and another
[1:22:43] little Titus so God done Through the
[1:22:45] Ages God took our Prophet but oh how he
[1:22:48] would no doubt be so happy to walk into
[1:22:52] a church like this today when the
[1:22:54] message of the hour is being preached
[1:22:57] and he'd find one preacher and another
[1:22:59] preacher and another preacher and he'd
[1:23:01] say my work was not in vain oh no it is
[1:23:05] not in
[1:23:14] vain break Force into singing You
[1:23:17] mountains oh
[1:23:20] forest and every tree they in
[1:23:24] now this is why the trees are supposed
[1:23:26] to
[1:23:27] sing for the Lord has redeemed
[1:23:34] Jacob the Lord has redeemed Jacob and
[1:23:37] the trees are happy about it that's
[1:23:40] right praise be to God well if we could
[1:23:43] update that from the Old Testament you
[1:23:45] thought I'd say these trees in this day
[1:23:46] are about to have a spell because they
[1:23:49] know that that there's something about
[1:23:51] they can see the sequence of times and
[1:23:53] what all is going on and they must know
[1:23:55] the resurrection's getting close at hand
[1:23:57] and there'll come a day that I will
[1:23:59] never die again I'll stand there as a
[1:24:02] Mighty O and for eternity you imagine
[1:24:04] the big oak trees and them streams and
[1:24:07] them beautiful Parks there'll never be a
[1:24:08] frost that'll ever cover the face of the
[1:24:11] Earth I'm about to preach right now wish
[1:24:12] should get with me I'll tell you one
[1:24:14] thing friend there'll never be a
[1:24:16] cemetery there'll never be a funeral
[1:24:18] there'll never be a funeral home on that
[1:24:20] 's day there'll never be none of that s
[1:24:23] that a PA will ever be digging dig down
[1:24:26] there and a body be put on the earth you
[1:24:28] talking about shouting and worshiping
[1:24:31] and praising God if the trees Praise Him
[1:24:34] Now what will they do in the eighth
[1:24:39] [Applause]
[1:24:46] day I just got to be honest with you
[1:24:49] kind of makes me
[1:24:52] wonder if our ears be more open than
[1:24:55] what they are
[1:24:59] now and we'll go out and walk in the
[1:25:03] forest amongst the trees and the
[1:25:07] animals but our ears will be tuned to
[1:25:10] tree language
[1:25:13] then and we'll watch some leaves just
[1:25:16] that gentle Brie you know not not storms
[1:25:19] but as they're just there and they're
[1:25:21] bowing and worshiping and praising God
[1:25:24] and you walk down by the tree of life
[1:25:26] and you reach over and you pluck off the
[1:25:29] prophet said you pluck off on them
[1:25:30] leaves because your use is constantly
[1:25:35] being
[1:25:36] renewed as you eat from the fruit of the
[1:25:39] trees this is something that the devil
[1:25:41] don't understand and many Christians
[1:25:43] don't understand our youth in our soul
[1:25:46] is constantly being renewed when we feed
[1:25:49] on the word of God for the hour when we
[1:25:52] come to the house of God and we can be
[1:25:54] so low and so weary and we just say oh I
[1:25:57] don't know if I can make it another day
[1:25:58] but we come to where the Fountain of
[1:26:00] Life is already here hallelujah and
[1:26:03] we're able to pull from that water and
[1:26:05] reach over and grab a hold to the leaf
[1:26:08] off of the tree of life amen and our
[1:26:10] souls leave and say all right devil
[1:26:12] where are you where are you devil I'm
[1:26:15] ready for another day I'm ready for
[1:26:17] another battle why because we have
[1:26:20] already tapped into the Water of Life
[1:26:23] our fa is being renewed our courage is
[1:26:26] being
[1:26:28] [Applause]
[1:26:36] renewed break Force into
[1:26:39] singing You mountains oh forest and
[1:26:43] every tree therein for the Lord ha
[1:26:46] redeemed
[1:26:48] Jacob and glorified
[1:26:50] himself in Israel
[1:26:54] Psalm Isaiah rather
[1:26:56] 49:13 sing oh
[1:27:00] heavens and be
[1:27:03] joyful oh
[1:27:05] Earth and Break Forth into
[1:27:08] singing oh
[1:27:12] Mountains for the Lord has
[1:27:15] comforted his people so he's making the
[1:27:18] heavens and the Earth
[1:27:20] testify and
[1:27:22] worship because of the good goodness not
[1:27:24] so much just to them but the goodness to
[1:27:28] his people yes sir don't you see the
[1:27:32] heavens is tied to the Earth the
[1:27:35] glorification of the heavens is being
[1:27:39] expressed by the
[1:27:41] Earth and when we look at Redemption how
[1:27:45] can it be that the prophet tells us in
[1:27:47] the church age Mo that in
[1:27:49] her is summed up the perfect wisdom of
[1:27:53] God
[1:27:56] in the pride of
[1:27:57] Christ has summed up the perfect wisdom
[1:28:00] of God in so much that he is not
[1:28:03] complete without
[1:28:05] you and you're not even a blue
[1:28:08] dot you're even tinier than that on that
[1:28:11] little tiny blue dot so you imagine if
[1:28:13] the Earth is that little tiny blue dot
[1:28:16] imagine how big you are
[1:28:24] and yet he come down to this blue
[1:28:26] dot
[1:28:29] Hallelujah so we can see it in the
[1:28:32] heavens then that God has order you
[1:28:34] believe
[1:28:36] that can I have a few more minutes so
[1:28:39] dides God have order on the
[1:28:43] earth did he have order in the Old
[1:28:45] Testament Exodus
[1:28:48] 27:21 in the Tabernacle of the
[1:28:51] congregation within the veil which is
[1:28:53] before the testimony
[1:28:54] Aaron and his sons shall order it from
[1:28:59] evening to morning before the Lord it
[1:29:01] shall be EST statued forever under their
[1:29:03] Generations on behalf of the children of
[1:29:05] Israel now we'll read several of these
[1:29:06] so it's to do it's the sacrifice it's to
[1:29:09] do it's a tabernacle it's to do with the
[1:29:11] manora it's also to do with the bread
[1:29:14] Exodus 39:37 the pure Candlestick with
[1:29:18] the lamps thereof even with the lamps to
[1:29:21] be set
[1:29:27] and all the vessels
[1:29:30] thereof and the L oil for light Exodus
[1:29:34] 40 and4 and thou shalt bring in the
[1:29:37] table and
[1:29:39] set in
[1:29:41] order the things that are to be set in
[1:29:46] order God knew how hard Ed we were
[1:29:48] didn't he so he repeated himself God
[1:29:51] don't set her like we do God knew how we
[1:29:53] were upon it and thou shalt bring in the
[1:29:56] Candlestick so it wasn't like that that
[1:29:58] God said y'all just build God a house it
[1:30:00] don't matter what color he use what kind
[1:30:01] of wood you use even our wives is more
[1:30:03] piggy than that so you got to have a
[1:30:05] certain kind of wood you got to have a
[1:30:07] certain color you got to do this and
[1:30:08] that and the other and God said this is
[1:30:10] the way I want it done and this is the
[1:30:12] only way I will accept
[1:30:16] it notice verse 23 and set the bread in
[1:30:22] order upon and I remember the bread was
[1:30:25] the 12 loaves of shoe bread which the
[1:30:27] word shoe bread is the bread of his face
[1:30:31] so it was set before his face the bread
[1:30:35] so it's set in order now what difference
[1:30:38] does it make well there's one bla named
[1:30:40] for the first tribe room on down on down
[1:30:42] on down well can't you mix them up not
[1:30:44] according to God you couldn't they've
[1:30:46] got to be in their proper place
[1:30:48] Leviticus 1:7 and the sons of Aaron the
[1:30:51] priest shall put fire upon the altar and
[1:30:54] lay the
[1:30:58] word why be siy
[1:31:02] God because our God is a god of order
[1:31:06] and
[1:31:07] structure now you can see why Le of the
[1:31:10] sins do not fit in the elect column in
[1:31:15] the last
[1:31:16] days cuz people want to be Christians
[1:31:18] don't even go to church want to be
[1:31:20] Christian they don't honor Sunday or
[1:31:22] there you know the resurrection a bit
[1:31:23] more than nothing oh I'm a Christian
[1:31:25] where you go to church I don't even go
[1:31:26] to church I don't believe I need to
[1:31:28] because I'm in
[1:31:30] Christ I'm in Christ so therefore I
[1:31:32] don't even need to go to church you see
[1:31:33] what they're doing they're totally
[1:31:35] discrediting the god of order and the
[1:31:37] god of structure because they have no
[1:31:39] structure to their life no structure to
[1:31:41] worship they just give God what they
[1:31:44] want God to have forget God's divine
[1:31:46] order forget but you see the bride this
[1:31:49] is one thing again that makes her
[1:31:51] different from the church is because the
[1:31:53] bride wants divine order for her life
[1:31:56] divine order does not mean that we're
[1:31:58] cold dead and formal but with a living
[1:32:01] God in our midst we're not going to be
[1:32:03] formal come on somebody but there is a
[1:32:07] divine
[1:32:08] order notice again in verse 8 and the
[1:32:10] priest Aaron's son shall lay the parts
[1:32:13] now this is a sacrifice The Head and the
[1:32:17] fat in order upon the wood that is on
[1:32:21] the fire which is upon the altar so this
[1:32:26] is on that and that is on that and that
[1:32:29] is on that well what if they change the
[1:32:32] order let's put the ram down first let's
[1:32:34] put the fat down first and then we'll
[1:32:36] just throw a little bit of you know rice
[1:32:38] on the top of that we'll put a little
[1:32:39] bit of carrots over on the side a little
[1:32:40] bit of maters and ters on the other side
[1:32:43] they'll pack you out of dead
[1:32:45] man Leviticus 612 and the fire upon the
[1:32:50] altar shall be burning in it and it
[1:32:52] shall not be put out and the priest
[1:32:54] shall burn wood on every morning and lay
[1:32:57] the burnt offering in order upon
[1:33:01] it and you can see why with these things
[1:33:04] being done over and over and over and
[1:33:08] over again that human beings can become
[1:33:11] so
[1:33:13] methodical that it's just I'm getting up
[1:33:15] I'm going to church Sunday it's Sunday
[1:33:17] morning we're going to church and we're
[1:33:19] going to sit in our favorite spot if
[1:33:21] somebody else ain't got if they've got
[1:33:23] our spot I'm want to be mad a hornet
[1:33:24] I'll tell you one thing I ain't going to
[1:33:26] get nothing out of the service you ought
[1:33:28] to be so happy to come to the house of
[1:33:30] God if you had to set in a plastic
[1:33:32] child's chair you ought to be happy to
[1:33:34] be able to come to
[1:33:36] church you see this is one of the
[1:33:39] challenges for us that when we find the
[1:33:42] order of God that it does not become
[1:33:44] cold and monotonous and formal come on
[1:33:48] somebody all people say well that's just
[1:33:50] church entity going to church or maybe
[1:33:52] it's Church entity for you but when God
[1:33:55] saved me many years ago he saved me to
[1:33:58] go to church I love going to church now
[1:34:00] more than I've ever love going to church
[1:34:03] and I've been going to church basically
[1:34:05] all of my life since 12 years old and I
[1:34:08] love going to church because I never
[1:34:10] know what God's going to do I never know
[1:34:13] what God's going to say and yes there's
[1:34:15] some methodology to it but I've learn
[1:34:18] that if I will do everything on my part
[1:34:21] he will surpass everything I
[1:34:26] respect praise the
[1:34:29] Lord Leviticus 243 without the veil of
[1:34:32] the testimony and the Tabernacle of the
[1:34:34] congregation shall Aaron order it from
[1:34:37] the evening until the morning before the
[1:34:39] Lord
[1:34:41] continually it shall be a statue forever
[1:34:43] in your Generations Leviticus 24:4 he
[1:34:46] shall order the lamps upon the pure
[1:34:48] Candlestick before the Lord continually
[1:34:53] Elijah's First Kings 18:33 and he put
[1:34:57] the wood in order and cut the bulock in
[1:35:01] pieces and laid him on the
[1:35:06] wood and said Phil four
[1:35:10] barrows remember four is the number of
[1:35:13] Earthly
[1:35:14] Deliverance was water and poured on the
[1:35:16] burnt sacrifice and on the
[1:35:20] wood after Uzziah had touched the ark 1
[1:35:24] coronal 15:12 and said unto them ye are
[1:35:27] the chief of the fathers of the Levites
[1:35:29] sanctify yourselves both ye and your
[1:35:32] brethren that you may bring up the Ark
[1:35:34] of the Lord God of Israel unto the place
[1:35:36] that I have prepared for it for because
[1:35:39] you did it not at the first the Lord Our
[1:35:42] God made a
[1:35:44] breach upon us for that we sought him
[1:35:48] not after the due order
[1:35:55] now you understand David was one to
[1:35:56] bring the ark up to his
[1:35:59] house but David left out one simple
[1:36:02] thing he left out the
[1:36:05] ministry so they put the word on a new
[1:36:08] cart and said we don't really even need
[1:36:11] preachers anymore come so we're taking
[1:36:14] the word and we're putting it on a new
[1:36:16] cart and remember those who touched that
[1:36:20] died they died that's right because let
[1:36:23] it out now after the breach has been
[1:36:26] made upon them oh people say well well
[1:36:28] bless God we we we want to move a God in
[1:36:30] our church we don't want no order we
[1:36:31] don't want no church order what are you
[1:36:33] saying what are you saying that God
[1:36:35] would send a Vindicated Prophet to tell
[1:36:37] us how to worship how to pray how to
[1:36:40] operate our gifts and we don't want that
[1:36:42] in our church so what else don't we want
[1:36:43] in our church I want everything that God
[1:36:46] has order included but order as I said
[1:36:50] does not mean formality order is there
[1:36:53] to give us a guideline to watch what are
[1:36:55] we watching for the invasion of evil
[1:36:58] spirits the invasion of evil spirits in
[1:37:01] our life and in our worship come on
[1:37:03] somebody but we want the spirit of God
[1:37:06] we want gifts of God we want the Holy
[1:37:09] Ghost we want worshiping and all that
[1:37:12] sort of thing do we
[1:37:14] not oh my M psalm
[1:37:19] 110:4 for the Lord has sworn and will
[1:37:22] not repent Thou Art the priest Forever
[1:37:25] After the
[1:37:26] order of
[1:37:29] mezc 1 Corinthians 11:34 If any man
[1:37:33] hunger let him eat at home that when you
[1:37:36] come not together under condemnation and
[1:37:39] the rest will I
[1:37:42] set in in order when I come first
[1:37:47] Corinthians
[1:37:48] 14:40 let all things be done decent
[1:37:56] and look at the meaning of the word an
[1:37:59] arranging Arrangement a fixed succession
[1:38:02] observing a fixed time doe or right
[1:38:05] order orderly condition the post rank or
[1:38:09] position which one holds in Civic or
[1:38:12] other Affairs and since her position
[1:38:14] generally depends on one's talents
[1:38:17] experience resources character fashion
[1:38:21] quality and style
[1:38:24] so Paul said let all things be done in
[1:38:27] decency and in order for those who are
[1:38:30] equipped by God not those who want to be
[1:38:33] something but that will be the divine
[1:38:36] order of God you mean to tell me in the
[1:38:38] New Testament they had order yep they
[1:38:40] sure did boy the Corinthian Church sure
[1:38:42] needed it too 1 Corinthians 16:1 now
[1:38:45] concerning the collection for the Saints
[1:38:48] as I have given
[1:38:52] order I wonder if for some of the people
[1:38:54] on that day said well that was just for
[1:38:56] Paul's
[1:39:00] Church actually if you look at Paul's
[1:39:05] writings every one of those books that
[1:39:07] he
[1:39:09] wrote was to his
[1:39:13] churches you ever wonder why Paul didn't
[1:39:15] write a letter to the church at
[1:39:19] Jerusalem that was the mother Church
[1:39:23] what why he didn't write a letter to the
[1:39:24] church in
[1:39:26] Babylon that's the church that Peter
[1:39:29] founded you see they believed in order
[1:39:31] and they believed that they were not
[1:39:34] called he said I chose to go preach
[1:39:37] Christ but I wouldn't go preach and
[1:39:38] where others and mentioned him lest I
[1:39:41] would build on another man's
[1:39:43] Foundation they believe God had
[1:39:46] designated by divine order a specific
[1:39:48] spot here Paul is a messenger of the age
[1:39:51] and never felt led of God to rise a
[1:39:53] letter to the church at
[1:39:57] Jerusalem boy I got you thinking now
[1:39:59] ain't it well good maybe get your head
[1:40:01] out of Facebook and go to reading your
[1:40:02] Bible all right Twitter and Tik Tock and
[1:40:06] flipflop and all the rest these stupid
[1:40:08] stuff we've got our minds so caught up
[1:40:10] into social media let's get our mind
[1:40:12] back on the word let's get our mind back
[1:40:14] on the prophet's message this is what's
[1:40:16] going to get us out of
[1:40:18] here oh
[1:40:20] my Hallelujah
[1:40:23] Colossians 2:5 we close your momentarily
[1:40:26] for though I be absent in flesh yet am I
[1:40:29] with you in spirit
[1:40:32] joying and
[1:40:34] beholding your
[1:40:37] order and the steadfastness of your
[1:40:40] facei in Christ titus: 15 for this cause
[1:40:46] left are they now Paul writing to Titus
[1:40:48] so he goes up through the the aisle of
[1:40:50] cre 110 miles long something like that
[1:40:53] so there's several several cities all
[1:40:55] along the aisle of Creek and everywhere
[1:40:58] Paul goes there was a Revival had a
[1:41:00] conversion now Paul had to leave then
[1:41:01] and go somewhere else so Paul leaves
[1:41:04] Titus there and Titus is going to set
[1:41:07] the churches
[1:41:09] up set them
[1:41:11] up and you know what he's going to set
[1:41:13] them up with
[1:41:15] Elders
[1:41:17] preachers so they wasn't writing Paul's
[1:41:20] books and just having somebody to stand
[1:41:23] up read
[1:41:24] it but they ordained
[1:41:27] Elders praise the Lord for this cause
[1:41:30] left I Thee incre that thou should us
[1:41:34] set in order the things that are wanting
[1:41:38] notice what was wanting now people had
[1:41:40] got saved some of them got the Holy
[1:41:42] Ghost they got delivered of their
[1:41:43] idolatry and all of that and they said
[1:41:45] well praise the Lord I mean we're we're
[1:41:47] Believers now they were Believers but
[1:41:49] they were not in order there was no
[1:41:51] pastors no deacons there was no
[1:41:55] structure of the Church of the Living
[1:41:58] God God did not want to just save people
[1:42:01] and scatter them out he wanted them to
[1:42:04] be born by the spirit of God into the
[1:42:06] mystical Body of Christ but they also
[1:42:09] wanted them to gather together in
[1:42:12] Fellowship in the church
[1:42:15] local uhoh now I'm going to lose some of
[1:42:18] the message folks ain't I well this is
[1:42:20] why a lot of will never have the hearts
[1:42:22] turned back to the original Apostolic
[1:42:24] face because in reality they don't
[1:42:27] believe in Apostolic face they believe
[1:42:29] this message is something totally new
[1:42:32] it's totally new therefore they don't
[1:42:34] even need the Bible they don't need Paul
[1:42:36] as a reference Peter as a reference but
[1:42:38] your Prophet went beyond the curtain of
[1:42:40] time and you know who he referred to you
[1:42:42] know who he judged his own message by
[1:42:44] Paul himself what Paul preached I preach
[1:42:46] the same thing and those of us that are
[1:42:49] there by representation we answered back
[1:42:52] and said are resting on that Paul will
[1:42:55] be judged and he said if Paul's group
[1:42:57] goes in mine will go in well a lot of
[1:42:59] these message folks will not go in
[1:43:02] because they do not see Apostolic order
[1:43:05] as a requirement in the last day the
[1:43:08] alpha bride started out with divine
[1:43:11] order by a prophet of God the Omega
[1:43:14] bride will be capped off by the very
[1:43:17] same word of God that's been turned back
[1:43:20] to the original Apostolic Faith a
[1:43:23] Apostolic order come on somebody and
[1:43:26] they're not rebelling against the
[1:43:27] prophet they're not rebelling against
[1:43:29] God call men because they can recognize
[1:43:33] that was God's order given to us by the
[1:43:36] founder of the church which is Jesus
[1:43:39] Christ himself let's stand our feet
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:57] praise the
[1:43:59] Lord now I'm going to give you my
[1:44:06] title praise the
[1:44:11] Lord as a right of the people of
[1:44:17] God this will be one of our final
[1:44:21] rights that'll be granted
[1:44:24] the right to
[1:44:25] be in divine
[1:44:30] order you see this Earth this age is so
[1:44:33] urgent and it's so
[1:44:35] required that the Lord Jesus was put out
[1:44:37] of his church in Revelation 3 and the ly
[1:44:40] in church
[1:44:41] age and he cannot cause a resurrection
[1:44:44] and a
[1:44:45] Rapture if he does not have his body
[1:44:49] under his headship and his control so
[1:44:52] there must be an order that's flowing
[1:44:54] from the head down to the body then the
[1:44:59] head projects to them the resurrection
[1:45:03] call and the prophet tells us that Jesus
[1:45:06] gets his
[1:45:08] place in the last
[1:45:11] days so he's got to have a people on the
[1:45:13] Earth a body and they are submitted to
[1:45:18] his
[1:45:20] Dynamics we as a bride we are his
[1:45:23] mechanics on the earth his voice his
[1:45:26] eyes his hands I've been sharing a quote
[1:45:30] this morning that a minister friend of
[1:45:32] mine from Canada had shared earlier
[1:45:35] today brother random was talking about
[1:45:38] the Lord Jesus doing his work and his
[1:45:40] people oh just a powerful powerful
[1:45:44] statement and he said the Lord actually
[1:45:47] his resurrection appeared to the ones on
[1:45:50] the road to EMAs but he appeared in
[1:45:53] veiled form and he said the Lord might
[1:45:56] appear to you in your
[1:45:59] pastor or in somebody you go to church
[1:46:02] with that's trying to encourage you and
[1:46:05] he said it might be Jesus
[1:46:08] himself using that brother's
[1:46:10] sister oh praise God and then you wonder
[1:46:14] what you can
[1:46:16] do there a a person standing before me
[1:46:18] right now we was communicating this week
[1:46:21] and a brother told me that he he he
[1:46:23] feels in his heart to kind of reach out
[1:46:26] to different people in the church and
[1:46:28] maybe those that don't have a lot of
[1:46:30] friends or feel like they don't have a
[1:46:32] lot of friends and they're kind of left
[1:46:34] out of this circle or that Circle and he
[1:46:37] it's just something that he felt to do
[1:46:40] and I text him back and told him I said
[1:46:42] brother that's a great
[1:46:45] ministry the brother's response was you
[1:46:48] mean that's a Ministry
[1:46:53] you see the word Deacon comes from the
[1:46:56] Greek word
[1:46:58] deonia and the meaning of it is ones who
[1:47:01] are called to
[1:47:05] minister some of you think because you
[1:47:07] don't preach or you don't have a gift
[1:47:08] you can't
[1:47:10] Minister but you can minister to those
[1:47:13] sometimes that are hurting those that
[1:47:15] are
[1:47:15] lonely it do you good every now and then
[1:47:18] to break out of your favorite four and
[1:47:20] no
[1:47:21] more and maybe notice people that
[1:47:24] aren't you know maybe kind of standing
[1:47:26] by their s but it don't seem like they
[1:47:28] have very many
[1:47:30] friends and try to let them know that
[1:47:32] you love them and you're praying for
[1:47:34] them and say something nice Jesus might
[1:47:37] use you to help someone that's going
[1:47:40] through one of the lowest spots in their
[1:47:43] life will y'all ever become best buds
[1:47:46] maybe
[1:47:47] not but it might be your five minutes
[1:47:49] that you took away from your little
[1:47:51] circle of friends
[1:47:53] just to show somebody a little bit of
[1:47:56] kindness and make life a little bit
[1:47:59] easier for
[1:48:00] them wouldn't it be something if you
[1:48:03] stand before the Lord that day and that
[1:48:05] man or woman walks up beside
[1:48:07] you and you're turn around looking at
[1:48:09] them and think
[1:48:10] wow and the Lord Jesus turns and says to
[1:48:13] you you remember that day after
[1:48:17] service you went over them because you
[1:48:19] saw them standing out in the vestibule
[1:48:21] of church and nobody was speaking to
[1:48:24] them nobody was having nothing to do
[1:48:26] with them and you really didn't know him
[1:48:28] that well you didn't really feel that
[1:48:30] comfortable talking to them but you went
[1:48:32] over and just said hey how you doing
[1:48:35] praying for you hope everything's going
[1:48:37] well they had made up in their mind that
[1:48:40] day they would never coming back to Word
[1:48:42] of Life again because it seemed like the
[1:48:45] people were snobby to
[1:48:51] them help us
[1:48:53] Jesus I said help us
[1:48:59] Jesus the right to be in divine order
[1:49:05] you believe what you want to believe
[1:49:06] friends I do not believe the Lord is
[1:49:09] having us to talk about perfect love and
[1:49:12] these things that we're talking about I
[1:49:14] don't believe it's for no
[1:49:18] cause I believe it'll be one of the last
[1:49:20] things that she'll get
[1:49:23] before she
[1:49:24] leaves I ain't talking about getting it
[1:49:27] here but she'll finally get it she'll
[1:49:32] understand what she's supposed to do
[1:49:35] once she gets it in
[1:49:39] here she's to give it back oh my and
[1:49:43] Minister oh but it's so easy for us to
[1:49:46] draw a little circle and we're nice to
[1:49:49] those in our little circle and our
[1:49:51] favorites and our pck
[1:49:53] you know the reason a lot of churches
[1:49:54] are like that cuz preachers are like
[1:49:57] that preachers draw the little circle of
[1:50:00] them two or three brothers that see eye
[1:50:01] to eye on their doctor their Doctrine
[1:50:04] and that's their best buddies and then
[1:50:07] somebody they know crosses their
[1:50:08] ideology boy they won't have nothing to
[1:50:10] do with them and they'll post quotes on
[1:50:12] there you can't believe sometimes that
[1:50:14] preachers behave they'll post quotes on
[1:50:16] different this and that and the other
[1:50:18] trying to get it that guy and trying to
[1:50:19] get at that guy it ain't no wonder went
[1:50:21] no further up the road
[1:50:23] because a lot of the preachers ain't no
[1:50:25] further up the
[1:50:28] Road God help
[1:50:31] us God help
[1:50:35] us let bow our
[1:50:38] heads so you little
[1:50:45] T90 Speck of
[1:50:47] dust on this blue dot
[1:50:53] almighty God called you for a
[1:50:56] purpose wrote your name on his Heavenly
[1:51:01] book before the foundation of the
[1:51:04] world condescended from the heaven of
[1:51:07] the
[1:51:09] heavens down to this little blue
[1:51:13] dot to save you and
[1:51:17] I not just to save us but to fill us
[1:51:19] with his presence and to make us the
[1:51:23] extensions of his
[1:51:25] love so the prophet said he has no eyes
[1:51:28] on the Earth but ours No Hands on the
[1:51:29] Earth but
[1:51:31] ours anybody here today want to be the
[1:51:34] hands of
[1:51:35] Jesus a voice of
[1:51:39] Jesus you see this message tends to do
[1:51:42] something to us it every message of
[1:51:45] separation is always done the same thing
[1:51:48] we know we must separate from the world
[1:51:50] and we must separate from unbelief
[1:51:53] but if we're not careful we we want to
[1:51:55] separate from basically everybody and
[1:51:58] then if anybody disagrees with the way
[1:52:00] we believe about the gifts or anybody
[1:52:01] disagrees The Way We believe about
[1:52:03] predestination or election oh they don't
[1:52:05] believe what the prophet of God said
[1:52:06] I'll tell you one thing glory to God
[1:52:08] I'll believe what that Prophet said I'm
[1:52:10] standing right there for not careful we
[1:52:11] just keep separating separating
[1:52:14] separating and before long they ain't
[1:52:16] nobody left but
[1:52:19] us and let me tell you right now if the
[1:52:22] Rapture comes and Word of Life Church is
[1:52:26] the only one going in it I have to say I
[1:52:29] don't understand what about people of
[1:52:32] God around this world that love the Lord
[1:52:34] Jesus just as much as we do men of God
[1:52:37] that have done more for the kingdom of
[1:52:39] God than I could ever even think about
[1:52:43] doing but you see separation separation
[1:52:46] separation before long God stops
[1:52:48] separating and then we kick in and stop
[1:52:51] separating
[1:52:53] God separates us from unbelief not from
[1:52:56] brothers that disagree with us a little
[1:52:58] bit you see the prophet brought the
[1:53:01] message in this spirit that her brothers
[1:53:03] would draw him out he' draw a bigger
[1:53:05] Circle yeah I don't understand where we
[1:53:08] got the ideology that instead of us
[1:53:10] drawing bigger circles we draw smaller
[1:53:13] ones and we draw them and redraw them
[1:53:16] and draw them and redraw them and we've
[1:53:17] got them draw now to where a great
[1:53:20] separation is in our message ranks yes
[1:53:23] sir and it's so sad sir as gono and the
[1:53:27] captured Indians the Apaches from
[1:53:31] Arizona and some of the Apaches from the
[1:53:34] White
[1:53:36] Mountains they forfeited their rights to
[1:53:39] be Apaches and Real
[1:53:41] Americans and they sold their abilities
[1:53:44] to the American
[1:53:46] Army cuz a white man could never track
[1:53:49] the
[1:53:50] Indians so they got a Apaches to track
[1:53:53] the
[1:53:55] Apaches and then whenever it was all
[1:53:57] said and done they give them a rank you
[1:54:00] know give them guns and so on when they
[1:54:03] finally surrendered for the last time
[1:54:05] they took their rifles they stripped
[1:54:08] them of their Rank and they put them on
[1:54:10] the same trains that gono was on and
[1:54:15] sent them to
[1:54:17] Florida and some of the other Apaches
[1:54:19] that held out to the end they were were
[1:54:22] so angry at those men who had sold their
[1:54:25] birth rights they got mad and they
[1:54:27] started having words one with another on
[1:54:31] the train down to
[1:54:33] Florida but jono being a true
[1:54:36] leader said L's enough
[1:54:39] fight there's so few of us
[1:54:42] left we need one another now more than
[1:54:45] ever
[1:54:47] before we're being attacked on every
[1:54:49] side
[1:54:50] friends 7 three different media
[1:54:55] Outlets have published from new
[1:54:57] newspaper articles in the last few weeks
[1:55:00] lies
[1:55:01] hypocrisy all types of different things
[1:55:04] about the
[1:55:07] message we need one another more than
[1:55:09] ever before and the devil is fighting us
[1:55:11] trying to separate us more than he ever
[1:55:15] has may God help us how many can say
[1:55:18] today Lord I need help with that in my
[1:55:21] life Lord Jesus help
[1:55:25] me let's just bow our heads
[1:55:30] together father we've seen you in your
[1:55:33] Mighty power move Among Us in such
[1:55:36] wonderful
[1:55:38] ways we've seen you deliver drug
[1:55:41] addicts we've seen you deliver folks
[1:55:44] from smoking that were so Bound by it
[1:55:47] they couldn't live one day without them
[1:55:50] we've seen you heal cancer we've seen
[1:55:51] you do
[1:55:52] great miracles signs and
[1:55:55] wonders we've seen you bring back
[1:55:58] backsliders lord I don't even know how
[1:56:01] many people we've baptized since we've
[1:56:03] been here at our new
[1:56:06] place and we're so thankful for all of
[1:56:09] that you've allowed us Lord after this
[1:56:13] terrible hurricane come through to be
[1:56:15] able to minister to thousands of people
[1:56:19] and within a couple of our Drive I'm our
[1:56:22] place
[1:56:24] here you've allowed us to be able to
[1:56:27] help that some have told us they would
[1:56:29] have died waiting on the government to
[1:56:31] get to
[1:56:34] them Lord you've helped us to do that we
[1:56:38] thank you for
[1:56:39] it but now we're asking you Lord for
[1:56:42] some more
[1:56:43] help we need that great thing that can
[1:56:47] only come from
[1:56:49] you perfect love
[1:56:53] love that can forgive our
[1:56:57] enemies and we know that your Prophet
[1:56:59] has told us when he preach perfect faith
[1:57:01] that faith is
[1:57:04] based upon
[1:57:06] forgiveness you said it yourself that if
[1:57:10] we do not forgive men of their
[1:57:13] trespasses neither will your heavenly
[1:57:15] father forgive
[1:57:17] yours I doubt sincerely I'm the only one
[1:57:20] in this building today
[1:57:22] but I need your forgiveness every day of
[1:57:25] my
[1:57:26] life not just for the things I fall
[1:57:29] short of that I know about but for those
[1:57:32] things that I'm ignorant of ignorance is
[1:57:36] Lord help us Jesus but we admit when
[1:57:39] people hurt us in a certain
[1:57:42] way it can be so hard for us as humans
[1:57:46] to forgive
[1:57:48] them any people that's standing here
[1:57:51] today are under the
[1:57:53] sound of my voice that'll hear
[1:57:55] this maybe they've been hurt by a friend
[1:57:58] a loved one a
[1:58:01] preacher and Lord they've tried their
[1:58:03] best to get rid of it and they just
[1:58:05] can't do it and by saying that Lord I
[1:58:08] don't mean that even if we forgive that
[1:58:11] individual we'll be best of friends and
[1:58:12] buddies we may never be that because
[1:58:15] they that little something may always be
[1:58:17] there in the human part but I'm talking
[1:58:20] about from our soul that we will have
[1:58:23] nothing against
[1:58:24] them Lord Jesus your Prophet tells us
[1:58:28] thus saith the
[1:58:30] Lord lay aside
[1:58:33] everything until you get perfect love
[1:58:37] amen I don't know how much pler it could
[1:58:42] be so why is it that we seek healings
[1:58:46] above perfect love Miracles above
[1:58:50] perfect love gifts
[1:58:53] signs
[1:58:56] wonders help us
[1:58:59] lord it's written in the
[1:59:03] stars
[1:59:05] Hallelujah of a child that was
[1:59:09] born in Revelation
[1:59:12] 12 and he come out of that
[1:59:16] woman which had a
[1:59:19] crown of 12 Stars
[1:59:22] and when that child was
[1:59:25] born the dragon came and tried to
[1:59:28] destroy
[1:59:30] him and we know that child was
[1:59:32] you that Dragon was the devil then it
[1:59:35] goes on in Revelation 12 and says that
[1:59:37] the dragon took his
[1:59:40] tail the prophet tells us that was not
[1:59:42] literally of course a t a i l but it was
[1:59:45] a t a l e a tale a story that he he
[1:59:53] told once we are seated in Christ Jesus
[1:59:56] he can never get our souls again but he
[1:59:59] tries to affect our bodies Our
[2:00:03] Spirits our memory our minds with what t
[2:00:09] a l
[2:00:11] s and he tries to wrap his tails around
[2:00:16] stars and the prophet identified those
[2:00:19] stars as being Sons
[2:00:22] of
[2:00:25] Abraham so he tries to wrap his
[2:00:28] tails around our position so he can't
[2:00:31] get our soul so he focuses on the body
[2:00:34] he afflicts us he focuses on the spirit
[2:00:37] get us down focuses on our memory bring
[2:00:40] back
[2:00:41] failures and with his tail t a l e he
[2:00:45] will try to pull us as children of God
[2:00:49] away from our Divine Purpose
[2:00:53] but we refuse to listen to his lies amen
[2:00:59] make us one Lord
[2:01:02] Jesus
[2:01:05] hallelujah
[2:01:08] hallelujah just lay your hand over on
[2:01:10] the brother sister sent him there near
[2:01:13] you and offer a word of prayer for them
[2:01:14] would
[2:01:16] you Hallelujah Lord
[2:01:20] Jesus I want to be more like you
[2:01:24] Lord that's the way it's got to
[2:01:28] be for perfect love is not an
[2:01:31] option an absolute
[2:01:34] requirement and I have to be
[2:01:37] honest as these people I think will be I
[2:01:40] cannot produce
[2:01:42] that we cannot as a church produce
[2:01:49] that and you did it that way you would
[2:01:52] exhaust all of our abilities so we would
[2:01:55] have to have
[2:01:56] you I believe I have a portion of
[2:01:59] perfect love every person here today
[2:02:02] with the Holy Ghost
[2:02:04] does but what we want to do is learn how
[2:02:07] to use it
[2:02:10] more and take the t a l e of the devil
[2:02:13] from around our mind from around our
[2:02:16] spirit and cast it
[2:02:18] away so we can forgive and
[2:02:22] love and be
[2:02:24] merciful for you said blessed are the
[2:02:29] merciful for they shall be called the
[2:02:33] children of
[2:02:35] God father as we have our hands over one
[2:02:39] upon the other in the name of
[2:02:42] Jesus would you minister to your
[2:02:44] children today
[2:02:46] Lord Lord what we've been hearing on
[2:02:49] Wednesday night about the gifts it's
[2:02:50] made Lord me and I've heard others talk
[2:02:52] about it too such a hunger for the real
[2:02:55] and the
[2:02:56] genuine but Lord looking at it again
[2:02:58] father I found what the prophet said
[2:03:00] don't seek gifts seek The Giver amen so
[2:03:04] we're not seeking gifts so much we're
[2:03:07] seeking the giver but we want every gift
[2:03:09] The Giver has and every gift that he
[2:03:11] wants to give us oh Jesus would you
[2:03:14] minister to us today Father May the love
[2:03:17] of God so fall at our hearts it's no
[2:03:20] wonder that the quotee opened up with
[2:03:22] their Wednesday I where the Prophet said
[2:03:24] I'd rather have a church that didn't
[2:03:25] know one thing about spiritual gifts but
[2:03:28] they were so in love with you and so in
[2:03:31] love with one another but he doesn't
[2:03:33] stop there but he goes on to say if we
[2:03:35] had perfect love we would have perfect
[2:03:39] gifts oh
[2:03:41] Jesus make me more like you
[2:03:47] father oh I pray father in the name of
[2:03:50] Jesus
[2:03:52] granted I pray Lord God can we just
[2:03:55] raise our hands now you're not a
[2:04:00] tree you're not a
[2:04:02] leaf but a son or daughter of
[2:04:07] God but the heavens are speaking of what
[2:04:11] you and I should do if the trees
[2:04:14] standing out here in the Appalachian
[2:04:17] Mountains and many of them are already
[2:04:19] bare if they'd be like us thatd stop
[2:04:22] praising during The Bleak winter
[2:04:25] months but somehow they must praise
[2:04:27] without their
[2:04:28] leaves maybe Satan's took your health
[2:04:31] he's took this that the other from you
[2:04:33] you still got some bark don't you you
[2:04:35] still got some branches don't you you
[2:04:38] still got Roots you're still settled in
[2:04:40] the foundation of the word of
[2:04:42] God oh you may look pitiful right now
[2:04:46] you may look pitiful because of what
[2:04:48] you're going through but I still believe
[2:04:50] that from your bark
[2:04:52] from your life and your soul from the
[2:04:54] roots that you're rooted in God's
[2:04:56] predestinated unmar and favor you can
[2:04:59] still be able to praise him and love him
[2:05:02] and worship
[2:05:04] him any trees here with me today like to
