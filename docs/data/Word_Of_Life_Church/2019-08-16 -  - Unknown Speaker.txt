TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I was 17 year old in boot camp at Fort Sill Oklahoma and I remember that night they got us off the blessing way March they put us in line and took us into this building we had to start taking off her clothes and putting them in boxes to ship home and started giving us all the same uniform and then they marched us over they marched us over to the barber and they set this boy down you know he's one of these pretty boys and the farmer said how do you want your hair son he said just take a living off the side and kind of blocking across the back he said no problem yeah he filled him like an onion true story didn't bother me I didn't have much to lose but here we were all recruits but they turned us into soldiers by being taught to endure hardness the hardness that we endured in basic made of soldiers the officers instilled into us the Army's concept of discipline and obedience we endured hours of drilling endless parades nowrap marches constant pressure tasteless food guard duty without sleep bullying my sergeants lectures exposure to inclement weather the whole procedure was designed to toughen us up to make us ready for battle the Roman soldiers of Paul's day were the toughest the most discipline and the most efficient soldiers in the world and Paul in his mind it was reminded of that when he told Timothy he was a soldier of Jesus Christ he had been chosen picked up by God and he needed to learn to endured the hardness that a good soldier does he does not quit because he faces difficulty tasks or dangerous situations he knows that his life is expendable many a man has gave his life for his brother but jesus said no man has laid his life down for you oh yeah many of good men died on the battlefield saving his fellow soldiers knowing you must be prepared to lay your life down when it's required brother and said a little man and wife these two sing a song it thrilled me go something like this forgive me Lord and try me one more time I'll be yours if you'll be mine if I follow if I fell let me rise and try again forgive me Lord and try me one more time and the Prophet said I like that for eating good soldiers after get wounded or they're apt to get hurt buddy still a soldier it's got a purpose of something to fight for he'll rise and try again any soldier of the Cross will do the same thing and I say to you this morning maybe you've been shell-shocked maybe something in your life a shell sucked you and you've got amnesia that you don't know where you came from now you don't know where you're going but listen to the words of brothers also listen to Mary say being unto me look back into the word and see that God chose you for this army god bless you in his army remember who you are you may be a wounded soldier but you're still God's property rise up rise up let's fight again knock the dust off let's go keep on the firing line don't act like a civilian you're a soldier
