the breeze turns into again help me sing it brother harry i know the master of the wind i know he has come so make the sun again [Music] through the sky above [Music] [Music] let me bring me is that your testimony this morning he can come [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] he can come [Music] [Applause] [Music] can be seated this morning um actually let's sing that didn't i walk on the water sorry i changed that on you i may have said this before but i love i was talking to my kids about it the other day i love songs with wind in it you know the type with wind you know because there's there's all kinds of things in life that i personally i'm scared of everything you know any creature animals whatever i'm just a big chicken but there's things you can prepare for in life and there's there's men that you know that just can defend themselves from just about any any situation but when the wind comes and when the whole horizon changes and there's a force of nature like a hurricane tornado something when you think about that kind of wind you better know the master of the wind you better have faith in a higher power your wind and my wind is total different situations but we all have winds in our life and right now it's just hard not to think about the folks in our church that are facing winds that there's there's no way through the storm that they're in without the master of the wind let's sing this didn't i walk on the water i calmed their agency i spoke to your wind whatever your wind is this morning [Music] as i kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night i'm praying for assurance everything's gonna be all right lord i see [Music] out in another of me and i'm afraid i won't be able to go [Music] down [Music] and i gave you peace just so you wouldn't to die for your sins i searched until i found you and i [Music] said my bills are coming six days [Music] i'll is this little thing and i'll give you so much [Music] [Music] just just to die for your sins take a look behind you see how far you've come every time did i deliver you so why would you be thinking that [Music] see [Applause] [Music] i walked right beside you [Music] just to die for your sins i searched until i found you and i do it all praise the you have a lord for us brother harry's going to sing a song for us this morning i didn't know joel was going to be singing songs about storms and wind but uh brother louie asked me to sing something this morning i just had this on my heart i don't know where you are in your storm that brother donnie often says sometimes he calms the storm and sometimes he calms the child but there will be an end to the storm and while i'm in the storm i want to praise him [Music] i was sure by now that you would have reached down and wiped our tears away [Music] stepped in and saved the day but once again [Music] [Applause] and it's still raining and as the thunder roars i barely hear you whisper through the [Music] as your rain falls i raise my hands and praise a god who gives and takes away [Music] you are who you are [Music] [Music] you never left my side and though my heart is torn i will praise you in this story [Music] i remember when i stumbled you raised me up again my strength was almost gone how can i carry [Music] whisper through the [Music] and rain the gods and takes away [Music] you are who you are no matter where i am every tear i've cried you hold in your hair [Music] is of heaven and earth where does my health come from my help comes from the lord maker from heaven [Music] comes from the lord the maker of heaven and earth [Music] you never left my side though my heart is torn i will praise you in this storm though my heart is torn [Music] i will praise you in this storm [Music] praise the lord sure appreciate that song this morning you know we'll stand this morning but donald gets ready to come you know everything that's going on right now we know when in job's time the lord and the devil had a conversation about that whole situation and who knows this may be one of those times where satan said just let me keep them from assembling let me attack this one let me attack that one and see how many still will praise be in the storm i'm glad that's what we're here doing this morning aren't you glad to be associated with a group of people there's a storm right now but we'll continue to worship him i just asked brother harry you'll sing that course again as brother donnie comes let's just sing that with him this morning [Music] you are who you are no matter where i am every tear i've cried you hold in your hair you never left my side though my heart is told [Music] i will praise you in this story let's take my single course again [Music] you oh no matter where i am every tear i've cried you hold in your hand you never left my side and though my heart was torn i would praise you in this storm [Music] where does my health come from my help comes from the lord the maker of heaven and earth i lift my eyes unto the hills where does my health come from my help comes from the lord the maker of heaven and earth and i'll praise you in this storm no matter where i am and every tear [Music] though my heart is [Music] let's pray together heavenly father we so love you today we know this is one thing that separates your true word-born children from just people who go to church they are so tried and so tested they have to be to match you yet lord others should look at this one or that one say well this is a christian church and this is a christian and that's a christian and they never have anything to happen to them to me lord that would be one of the worst things anyone could ever say about our church that we're never tested we're never tried if our ministers here at the church are scar-free and we are never thrown into the angry flames and torrents of the winds and the waves i would not take that that's a compliment the lord jesus we know that your people are a tribe people for you are still proving your greatness as they go through trials and they know it's not themself they testify we could not stand this if it was not for the grace of god amen amen we count it's such an honor to be together again today lord our hearts have longed to be together thank you lord we pray that you just meet with us in a special way oh it's we could dismiss right now and go home and say it's been so good to be here take your word and speak to us today father would you in the name of the lord jesus we ask it amen amen greet you today in the name of the lord i just wish i could hug all of you together just give you a big old hug i've been doing that air hug stuff with my grandkids and stuff and it don't work there's no feeling to it are there there's just we're so happy to be to be able to be gathered together again today thank you for praying for carol and myself and we're doing better and certainly just appreciate your prayers and continue to pray for the rest of those in the church that are sick and and have so many needs and we believe that our needs are opportunities by which the grace of god can be able to manifest himself that's right and that's the way we look at it that's the way we we believe it we certainly appreciate you being here today trust the service will be a blessing one wednesday night such a wonderful service brother daryl just did an outstanding job so appreciated the word and the anointing excuse me appreciate the different ones that have come and made the stream unavailable and we wasn't able to assemble together we appreciate them for doing that and yes i am delaying um i'll wait for the butterflies to settle a little bit it's been three weeks since i preached 21 days today so i know i know you think you get nervous after all these years you need to get rid of me when i don't because if i ever get to a place that i think i don't need him it's time for you to get another preacher amen god bless you love you so much hebrews chapter 9 verse 15. by taking the type of body that he took by going through what he went through it should have told us the rest of the journey would not be easy by suffering all that he suffered and being in the act of condescension through kenosis and then once he raised from the dead by taking that same body and glorifying that same body the picture should have been more clear but as we go along it does become more clear hebrews 9 15 and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance for where a testament is there must also a necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is a force after men of are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth may the lord bless his word you may be seated it is our soul that has moved into the land of the abstract but our bodies still remain in a place of great humiliation as i stand before you today i stand in a state of humility humiliation i stand in a state that shows my full sonship has not been completely restored yet since the last time i preached to you i've lost about 15 pounds i'm weaker i have to kind of steady myself i'll have to pace myself this morning when i preach why because i'm still immortal no doubt in the last two weeks two months three months many of you have went through things that you never thought you'd ever face before as our as a church we have not just as our church only but churches around the world there's actually saints of god in the message that have been not allowed to go back to their country i know one particular brother that is in a certain part of africa he has been there in this part of africa now for about four months staying in a motel every night because his country shut down their borders that would not let even residents come back in friends of mine in south africa that are in other parts of the world unable to come back friends of mine from zimbabwe that are in south africa that have not been able to come back to their home separated from wives children family because of this so you see this is not something that's just happy valley alone but the entire world has been affected by this who would have ever thought that something as simple as a member of the cold family coveted 19 is a member of the cold family now he's a rougher member of course than the cold itself but he is still of that family who would have ever thought it would have been able to brought such spiritual paralysis as well as natural paralysis to the world and this is pre-tribulation this is not no friends you have not missed the rapture the rapture still hasn't taken place in case you're wondering but if this is pre-tribulation can you imagine what it's going to be when the tribulation breaks through whenever the bride is actually taken from the world you think it's bad now you know why it's not worse because we're still here but whenever the bride is taken it is going to be one awful place to be living but while we are yet here we know that god has given us a work to do and that work will be completed you believe that now brother daryl said it so beautifully that this has taken us by surprise and i think brother west went along that same line but the lord has not been surprised at all you know the year 2020 has been quite a year has it not here we are coming to the end of the of august and my the things that have already happened have just been unbelievable if 21 is going to be any worse i think i'll hold on to 20 and say no i don't want any more uh but the thing is we don't have a clue really how far that god will let it go but i i think i can probably speak for pretty much everybody that comes to our church that probably we've been praying more we've had more sincerity i know so because i've talked to different folks and you know this has done something for us that uh having a big crowd didn't do this has done something for us that having blessings of god didn't do he knows how to turn the pressure upon us don't it now i'm not saying that any of you were backslid i certainly was not backslid but there's something about trouble that finely tunes a child of god's walk let me read to you this morning and you could read with me as well and romans chapter 8 verse 22 for we know that the whole creation grown us and travail us in pain together until now so if it was for man's sake that the earth fell we should not be surprised that the earth waits in great anticipation for the recovery of man's walk you can't hear it nor can i but the birds they not only praise but they cry the animals not only worship but they cry they agonize if you've ever heard the recorded sounds that nasa has made of the universe and the further they go out those sounds change no doubt they are worshiping god because the psalmist david said they were but part of what nasa has recorded has been the groans and the cries of the heavens oh they're still beautiful magnificent in their splendor and glory but whether or not you realize it the heavens are as an old man or an old woman the brilliance is not the same the light of the sun now is seven times weaker than it will be in the millennium the earth as i read this morning where the farmer's almanac is saying that we're in for quite a treat this winter time if we didn't need anything else and i couldn't keep from thinking you know the earth was not made to shiver i've stood in canada whenever it was -40 and they would pull the vehicle me preaching being sweating and hot they would pull the vehicle with three and three feet to the door so i could walk out of that blazing hot building into -40 temperatures and somehow the earth has adapted to it but it's not what she was made for she was not made for the coldest place on the planet to have ice fields that are 20 miles thick for the winds to blow 140 miles an hour with temperatures minus 100. i know she wasn't made for that because they've dug down beneath her our ice fields and pulled out palm branches they pulled out animals was palm branches still in their digestive tract she was made in her beauty and her splendor and then i think the word that paul used for we know the whole creation grown us so he doesn't just limit it to humans but the whole creation grown us and the greek word there is groans together all is united in a condition of sorrow and it express or denotes mutual universal grief it is one wide loud lamentation of pain sorrow sickness and death and which a dying world unites in one thing deliverance notice he goes on to say i'm travailus and pain together until now and paul chose a term here that was used for childbirth and we know the prophet when he preached the birth pains message that he he went through the different stages of what the earth had went through world war one world war ii the korean conflict of course in vietnam after he was gone all the different stages of the world itself and the people of the earth and it denotes an extreme cry of the depths of sorrow and anguish and all creation feels it to be honest with you i'm glad i can't hear the trees moan i deal with enough humans and i hear them moan and cry i'm glad i can't hear the trees cry i'm glad i cannot hear the animals cry and amen i'm not sure i could take it i've seen enough die in my lifetime i've seen enough broken-hearted children because their mom or their daddy was taken broken-hearted parents when a child left the earth before its time as we would say and you look around and you see it and you hear it and i know for those of us who have received the first fruits or the down payment of the spirit we feel it to a degree that the unsaved cannot even comprehend oh how i love my dose of the holy ghost how i love my portion of the keeping spirit of god but it's because of it it's what makes me so sad if i was out there in the world today and you were and you were trying to recover from a hangover last night and you were trying to get all this stuff settled in your mind you know of trying to find peace actually they don't feel what i feel today they don't feel what every other child of god feels because their souls has never received the deposit of a better world and when they get down they take an upper when they get too high they take a downer when they can't sleep they gotta peel for that and when they can't do something else they got something they smoked for that but i don't do that when i get down i pray when i get weary i read my bible when i get overwhelmed i begin to meditate about the new earth and the world that is to come hallelujah i don't depend on substances from without my body which helped me to cope with life every day i do not depend on a beverage on a pill on a shot that will help me get through my difficult times i get through them by the deposit that i've received from that other world but with that deposit also comes the taste the taste it's as if though you are allowed by the grace of god to take what's in your very soul and taste of another world that is so free from trouble and heartache and sickness and anxiety and you taste it for a moment and you think oh what a place what a place to be and then it's as if though the taste is gone and you want to taste it again you want to experience it again because it makes you so hungry for more and more and then it leaves you and then you're faced with cold stark reality of a sick hurting dying world aren't you glad today our hope is not in this world dealing with a world of mystery and anxiety every age since the fall of man has experienced it and paul uses those two words that are all creation groaners and travailus and pained together until now till the time when the prophet here writes in this first gentile church age so it had been the characteristic of every age since the very fall notice in verse 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit you see friend this is what makes us grown to such a degree would not the majority of humanity want a better world even though we would so differ in every political field and with every politician no doubt we would have such a difference whether it be socialism whether it would be communism whether it be democracy democracy itself is a million miles from perfection we know that but i'm glad we live here but yet no matter what the politicians would promise look at the kingdoms that have lived on the world and on the surface of the earth i've been privileged to be able to travel into different parts of the world and i love archaeology i love stones and i love looking at things and our trip to israel and i took so many pictures of of archaeology archaeological pieces of things and and my mind is i'd stand there and look and think that that is 2 000 years old or that is 2500 years old and when we were there in some of the places that we were able to go to and them still digging in the city of david and many other places and while we were there they just found the capstone of a corinthian type column buried many many feet down in the dirt and they had just just found it the day before we got there it had been laying there for 2 000 buried beneath that what did it tell it told to me it told a story of an era of time and i looked at that and i was just mesmerized about it thinking of the people that made it and the ones who erected that and the people that walked by it for maybe hundreds of years and you you see of what the stories that this earth holds and yet where are those great people today the romans which conquered the world during the byzantine period during the periods of great history you think of montezuma you think of the all the different ones that have lived and what do we have left of their societies pyramids made of stone or a rock this and a rock that the babylonians which rule the world and where are they today they cease to exist the pharaohs which ruled egypt where are they today and think of it this earth has seen them come and go and there's a saul standing over jerusalem looking there from where the lord jesus would have looked down upon the valley and his words reverberated in my soul oh jerusalem jerusalem how oft i would have gathered you together 20 centuries later and how many people have come and conquered and even at this very day excavating on the city of david and i saw this week a piece of a beam that they had just dug up four months ago that has been buried beneath the dirt there since the babylonians came and destroyed jerusalem 586 bc and dilate that charred piece of a wooden beam oh my how many stories have been lived through this earth and where are all of those mortals at now where is king nebuchadnezzar where is darius the great where is cyrus where are they brother daryl where are they where are their great kingdoms laying in dust and let's go ahead and add ours before it comes to pass for it will come to pass that the last vision that the prophet saw this great kingdom of america one of the greatest nations on the earth right i'm glad to be an american it breaks my heart to see america go the way she's gone but it is her own choice and her own fault and it won't be too many risings and settings of the sun that she will lay a smoldering ashes because a prophet of god saw it in a vision but i'm so glad my hope is not just in america i'm so glad my hope today oh brother donnie if if if joe biden can be the president he'll turn it around and some of the rest you say oh no no no no what we need is trump again no we don't need neither one of them guys we need the lord jesus to come back either one of them is going to lead us into a mess that's exactly right oh but friends by tasting of such a deposit in my soul and when i come down from living walking dwelling in that heavenly realm and then i have to feast my eyes back upon this that's around us the reason i grown is i have experienced my foretaste do you understand when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost and it releases your soul from mortality that is your portion of eternal life forever those of you who have eternal life this morning you'll never get any more than what you have right now your baptism of the holy ghost is that deposit praise god but the foretaste of that glory that is to come you see it's a paradox because it reflects most positive and negative effects in the same creature by whom it strikes its value i'm glad i'm not called to be a prophet i'm glad i'm not called to walk where they walked oh we look at them and ended there may be a position that they had i cannot imagine being called into the third heavens one day and hearing and seeing things that it's not even lawful for you to repeat and then you have to leave that and come back down to this i cannot imagine sitting in the bed with your hands behind your head and you're the song beyond the curtain of time and a voice from another world says would you like to see it oh i believe it would help me so much and the next thing you know you're standing above your body while your body's laying in the bed and you actually look at yourself and you think i must have died with a heart attack you're 20 feet from your body and all of a sudden you hear voices could it be that close can it be that that dimension is 20 feet from where i am so no farther than that can i run to it can i leap from this world into that one no if i could but desire today i would disappear before you and i wouldn't be the only one some of you would be going with me i'm glad i don't have the ability to travel to such a place that will but you see i've been one of the privileged some of you here sitting here today under my voice the sound of my voice we've been some of the privileged to get a deposit from that world can you imagine as the prophet as he looks around and the bluegrass being quite tall and the breeze blowing across the bluegrass unlike as the reference that brother joel made earlier the way we refer to wind and much of wind is associated in our minds of storms and fear but you see the wind never hardly raises just above a gentle breeze in that land and it hits the top of the bluegrass as they take their fingers and they rake it through that beautiful beautiful grass and he sees a throng of millions of people they don't recognize nobody and they don't even know where he is and the voice says you've been gathered with your people now remember he had not been birthed into the theophany which is the word form body so he didn't know all things he's had a temporary translation hallelujah oh it must have been beyond sublime but can you imagine when you're told you must go back i'm so glad he was willing the seals hadn't been broken who is melchizedek and been preached lots of great sermons where was yet to be revealed but can you imagine the imprint that it left on the prophet's soul when he had to leave that world of immortality and he looked back on the bed and that was his body and he knew he was going back brother darrell because he saw himself moving do i have to go back i'm glad i'm not a prophet i'm glad i've not had experiences like that i don't think i could take it oh but my adoption which has brought me in the sequence of eternity has placed me on this on my cycle to when my mortality soon will end you see the christian is like the spies whose soul has won over into the land of gigantic grapes and eternal life and goodness and joy and happiness this is one reason i love church so much oh men carol listen to a tape at home whenever we weren't able to have service or stream one of the ministers that we have confidence in and we we did all that too and we would play several tapes during the day because it didn't feel like doing anything else you know so you just listened to tape several several hours i did several studies and i did one study of 2030 quotes so i've spent a little bit of time with the word but yeah there's nothing like us being together because now if i look at 2 000 quotes or a thousand or 500 or 1500 or whatever it is i'm still only sitting there fellowshipping with my little lick of fire but here we are this morning we're privileged for a whole lot more of those same licks of fire to come together this is why we cry this is why we feel such sadness in our hearts when we cannot come together because it's just a little bit more of heaven together when we come together oh thank god for the brothers and the sisters that was able to come and sing and play the music for us it was a little bit more of heaven but it's a little bit more even here he had today notice this the adoption which will be climaxed in our mortality will be when the lord jesus returns i love the way that paul looks at this it will be the complete recovery of the body from death and corruption every time we see god heal somebody it's another down payment of a body change you see we have been in this body all of our life and in one sense the word it's the only thing since consciousness that we really understand but it's still the one sign of imperfect sonship we all know reality well enough to know that if the lord tarries within a few years we won't be able to do what we can do now i'm 64 years old i'm older than brother branham was when he passed away if the lord tarries a few more years at best is all i have left to be able to preach a few more years these some of these deacon brothers will realize you know what i i can't serve the people with my age i can't do it i feel that i need to step down maybe brother jim within a few years of condiments hey brother dania i just feel like i can't do this anymore i don't want to hear that from you brother louie will eventually say you know what brother donai i'm so forgetful or not if the lord tarries it i can't hardly grasp it but hey we'll say brother donny i'm missing so many notes i can't hear anymore my leg's got arthritis in it i can't play the foot pedal i'm going to get somebody else to play the organ what this is the vicious cycle i hate it but we could be the generation that breaks that cycle hallelujah hallelujah notice says brother blame it says while we're groaning veils in this tabernacle of humiliation we have the earnest of our perfect complete redemption back like it was in the beginning when god created adam in the garden of eden we have a foretaste of glory divine by the baptism of the holy ghost the refreshment coming from the presence of god to water the church i love this quote to water the church to make it grow in grace don't you see why they need to come together it's a refreshing presence of god it waters us it gives us all my a fresh drink from the heavenly spring to make us grow and when we're sick we have redemption the blessing the attributes of the death of christ divine healing as a foresign to us that someday this mortal will take on immortality yes sir amen oh my marvelous i say double marvelous triple marvelous quadruple marvelous god if he would make a statement like that in 1951 many of us are not even born how much more real what it is to be to our hearts today don't you understand every time you pray god please please remove this headache god remove this pain and the spirit of god comes to your body and moves that do you understand what happened you just received another drink of your resurrection praise be to god hallelujah amen amen you believe in saints three weeks ago i think it was three weeks ago to this day brother daryl had been battling the fever with a cove had come and go and come and go and you remember that service that i called his name in prayer and we agreed together on the promise of god and asked that thing to leave him it left him that very day what was that that happened in brother daryl's home what was that that moved on him the lord jesus gave brother daryl a foretaste of the resurrection his wife so sick laying on the floor for over an hour he said couldn't even get up i called her name in prayer amen whenever i got home he texted me and said brother daryl brother donnie she's sitting up at the table eating some soup what was it god gave sister cheryl another taste of the resurrection hallelujah those that we have prayed for for whatever more than it is and we have seen our lord come on the scene what was it it was our foretaste of the resurrection [Applause] well let's face facts this body is an embarrassment to me this morning i feel ashamed brother darrell i feel the anointing on me the wisdom of god anointing my mind i don't have to explain it to you but i'm limited by my strength this body humiliates me it embarrasses me this morning because i can't give my all i'm held back because of a lack of strength and there's one thing that i did get as i've got older when i didn't have when i was younger a little bit more wisdom so it helps i think of this little old frail tabernacle of our humiliation what is it just a few vitamins and calories throw together just a little place for the soul to anchor it that's all but one of these glorious days it'll be changed again he says someday we're going out of this tent this dwelling place the tabernacle of our humiliation and we're going to be changed step over on another land where it's purity and when our feet listen to this friends when our feet first touches that blessed land when the old ship of zion blows for landing and we rush out it's going to be all over there isn't that wonderful but isn't that tormenting it's wonderful to think about how much longer will it be a month two years 10 20. [Music] but don't you see why you feel the way you do your deposit your foretaste reminds you it's there it's there thank god i'm so glad i can say today it's not only there but it is here hallelujah hallelujah sickness and cripples and affliction and everything will be gone old age death sorrow and all these natural things that was caused by the curse will be gone forevermore all this revelation chapter five if you haven't listened to it in a while it's wonderful it parallels the breach and he preaches a few years after it but he says all creation is groaning said paul everything is groaning look at the trees how they struggle look at the flowers how they struggle for life just for the frost to tear them down we can see it already the leaves that are starting to turn some of them have just fell on the ground have they not now tell me that makes you happy right it makes you feel so happy whenever you look up really but wait a minute fall's coming the most beautiful colors that the leaves will ever show oh but it's not that that troubles you is it it's the nearly six months that we will look at those trees and their bark in the dismal gray and we can't wait for the first buds of spring can somebody please tell me where summer went i wish i could grab ahold of covet and smack his jaws from one side to the other kovad stole our spring it stole our late spring it stole our early summer it stole our mid-summer and here we are before you know it we're gonna be right in the middle of fall where is that coveted anyway oh man i'll tell you there's one person i wish had coveted he's the only one that can't get it and that's the devil what in the world happened to our summer what happened to our spring what happened to our plans what happened to our meetings i just got a text yesterday you got it brother tim they've decided not to have their meetings brother ron didn't have his brother joe green first time in 40-something years he said god oh what's happened what's happened everything has been turned upside down what is it friend believe it or not what we have experienced and are experiencing is another burst pain the church has gone through things that we never thought oh my we never thought we couldn't have church because of a virus a virus oh my look at the flowers how they struggle for life i passed i don't know how many coming to church this morning i saw black-eyed susans i saw daisies chrysanthemums i saw so many beautiful pinks and yellows and i thought it won't be no time their beauty will be all spent and gone and they'll be shivering in the cold and for some of them the first frost in late october will bring on their tabernacle of humiliation look at the trees uh they struggle to hold their branches out to sing glories unto god do you hear that i don't hear it either but that's what they're doing isn't it amazing that they put their branches out like this and they're praising god you imagine when the gentle breeze comes through by the dao and them leaves and then when no leaves are a sign of fellowship and the spirit of god of unity comes through them leaves and them leaves begin to blow all my in the spring states in the summer stage and the late summer and then the fall and then those who are deciduous which means they they shed their leaves and they stand there the whole time through winter but i'm so glad they don't fold their branches down by their side and somebody's zip them up but they stand there bear worshipping god right in the middle of wintertime oh they don't take much of a child of god to worship him in summer when your tree is full of branches and the gentle breeze come but oh brother sister to be able to stand there with no leaves we know what it's been like in quarantine do we not we know what it's been like to be quarantined hey i love my wife ain't nobody in this world i love know better but i i longed to see somebody else and she felt the same way about me go ahead you can say it about your little darling too because we were made to be together praise god i think brother brad yance had told me the other day hey praise god the next time we can see each other we can shake hands we both had covered so you're saying you belong just to shake somebody's hand you long oh brother sister what will it be when we'll be able to see jesus and see the resurrected dead and be with him forever listen to this brother brad said every sing all nature all animals all birds how he flies from the enemy quickly and gets away everything groaning and we ourselves have paul we've grown too with them you don't hear it all cattle all chickens all birds in their own time i don't know when they do it dude in the evening i don't know when they'd do it but they groaned we're waiting for the fullness of adoption and this will take place when at the first resurrection that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and will have a body like his own glorious body or we shall see him as he is and we like him when he appears we appear in his likeness and we shall have a body like his a glorious glorified body and all the trials and the struggles of life will this this is what'll happen to him now we'll fade off into a little mist and blow away praise god to never be no more so the things that we look at now and think it's so hard it's so difficult but all of our life's trials and tests will just be come together like a mist of vapor and the wind will get it and it'll blow away let me read this from the breach and we'll close something's lost it's groaning it's trying to get back to be back to its original condition would you imagine someone falling from the earth down into a deep pit somewhere and was struggling climbing pulling they must by some means get out of the spit and they're not in their original state and frantically they're screaming they're clawing the walls making a noise and doing some way and they're groaning because they want to get back to their original state that's when a person is struck with the disease aches and pain one time they wasn't that way but they're groaning why they're not right there's something wrong and they're groaning and they're trying to get back to where they was when they had health my brother gene lehman laying this morning on a ventilator i've been in the hospital for i don't even know how many days now he's not right he wasn't made to breathe by that when i called him the other day face time and offered prayer for him so weak he could hardly talk i looked in his face and i waved at him and he waved back at me it wasn't right those of you that are sick and suffering today it isn't right but if god can anoint our faith hallelujah if god can anoint our face we can look at covet we can look at cancer we can look at a tumor or whatever more and say i want my state back i want my health back so i can serve god with all of my soul let's stand together while we finish this quote trying to get back to where they was when they had health when nature and people as the bible said are groaning it shows there's something they're not and there ought to be condition they've fallen from somewhere we don't need anybody to interpret that for us but of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of adam and eve who fell from eternal life to death in the garden of eden and brought all nature under them to death let me close it's hard for our minds to imagine this but he said a tree never died before adam i wonder how many thousands or maybe even millions of years the earth existed in the preadomite condition not one tree struggled for life not one plant not one flower death was non-existent non-existent okay devil suit yourself a tree never died before adam an animal wouldn't die before adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's god because he's eternal so there's only one way to get us back to that spot god had to become time god had to become a mortal and empty himself out in order to come and take us home don't you love him today can we just bow our heads together hallelujah we'd just like to be remembered today maybe you're not sick i trust and pray that those of you have been spared the covetous trust god will keep you from it those of you that are still dealing with symptoms may god give you a temporary resurrection remove that mucus out of your body may god remove that lingering cough those of you that still can't taste smell whatever more in the name of jesus may you be fully restored to your pre-covet condition glory to god those of you with cancer in your bodies those of you with the diagnosis that the doctor gave you that was not good in the name of jesus may you be restored hallelujah to that pre-diagnosis condition to the land of health heavenly father thank you for your word today forgive me lord for not being able to deliver as i normally would have but i thank you for helping me i didn't feel like i even had a little boy's lunch today really maybe just a crumb out of that basket that he packed it in but i pray lord god that you'd take it and make it a blessing to your children's hearts father we pray for those that are so needy lord not only just in our church but around the world oh father god may you bring healing lord

church services back lord with our people in attendance oh god oh jesus granted to us father you see my heart lord as i walked out on the platform this morning to sat down to play the guitar it was everything i could do to hold myself together looking out on the congregation i just wanted to run out among them and grab them by the hands but since they know i've been sick i'm scared it might scare some of them to death the lord it ain't right we want to be right jesus restore our fellowship restore health lord god we pray for brother gene lehman his condition today father in the name of jesus lamb of god we speak our brother's name lord we've seen you move for him several times during this thing lord we believe dear god that our lives are brought on this earth to serve your purpose
