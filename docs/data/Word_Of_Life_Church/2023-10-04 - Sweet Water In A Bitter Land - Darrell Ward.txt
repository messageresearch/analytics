m m in her liver that was 2 in by 3 in by 3 in and it turned out to be a saroma which is a type of cancer and so it was in the right lower lobe and they was planning on doing a right lower lobe resection uh yesterday so they did several different tests in the lungs and the the bone and the and the uh colon and the esophagus and all those things were clear which was very good and so uh they wanted to go ahead and do a pet scan before they did the surgery on Tuesday so Monday they did a a pet scan and when they did the pet scans showed several more satellite lesions that the MRI didn't show that was in the liver and because of that uh they said she wasn't a candidate at this time if I understand it right for that for that surgery and so it actually showed up some around the lymph nodes also and so they had if I understand this right I I hope I'm telling it right but they had diagnosed her as a stage four met medesthetic saroma and so they're going to want to send her a few days on down to vanderbild and let them look at her down there for a second opinion and make sure what they're looking at and they're waiting for some final reports from the mayil clinic exactly what kind of cancer it is but so we just desire your prayers and I talked to her yesterday she said yeah I'll tell the church what's going on so they'll know how to pray so I know she appreciate your prayers and you know what's cancer to God Amen we serve a God that raises the dead amen amen so I just wanted to share that with you so if you'll stand with me tonight and you have your Bibles we want to turn to Exodus chapter 15 starting at verse 11 and then we want to drop from 11 down to verse 18 may the Lord richly bless you we count it an honor to be here with you and always good to be home to be with the Home Folks and so we just trust something to be said tonight to help you and encourage you and you say well brother Daryl there's a lot of sickness and there's a lot of needs and but there's not a need we heard tonight that's that's that's greater than our God Amen so we don't look we don't look to the storm we look to the son amen and we believe him tonight so may the Lord richly bless you Exodus chapter 15 starting at verse 11 the Bible says this who is like unto thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious and Hool Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders doing wonders Verse 18 the Lord shall reign forever and ever for the horse of pharaoh R in with his chariots and with the horsemen into the sea and the Lord brought again the Waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea and Mariam and the prophetes the sisters of Aaron took a Timber in her hand and all the women went after her with the Timbers and with dance and Mary answered them sing ye to the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the Wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and they found no water and when they came to morah they could not drink of the Waters of morah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Morra and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet amen there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to his Commandments and keep all his statues not just the ones you want but all his statues I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord that Health yes sir thee am for I am the Lord that Health thee I've got high blood pressure brother Daryl but I'm the Lord that Health thee I've got arthritis I've got glycom I've got sugar diabetes I've got cancer but I am the Lord that Health thee amen amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads I want to speak to you tonight on a few minutes on Sweet Water in a bitter land sweet water in a bitter land Heavenly Father we bow before you this evening and Lord your word just speaks to our hearts and we are so grateful father that it's not just a book of History even though it is a book of history but Lord this word that we read tonight is more than a history book it's a love letter to your children and Lord we receive the things that thou have spoken to us from your word you are our healer our deliverer our strength and our joy and father God I know Lord there's needs tonight not only in this congregation but around this nation and across the world of your people suffering but father God we believe what Thy word says I am the Lord that Health thee so father we only look to that Pro promise for every man's word is a lie and thy word is true bless your children tonight Lord Heal the sick that are among us God those on the prayer list tonight father those that are God that have these written requests oh Father may we hear the reports this week that you moved upon every need God and answered their prayer because that's the kind of God that you are you step Lord down into where we're at and bring us to where you're at thank you for all you've done for us in Jesus Jesus name we pray amen and the saint says amen amen God bless you you may be seated tonight you know our scripture tonight opens with a declaration to how great our God is and I'd like to say tonight that he is our God is a great God there is no God like our God people will worship ball players they'll scream at country singers and set dead in the church but I want you to know tonight that our God is worthy of Our Praise he's worthy of an amen there is no God like our God our God he is God Amen oh Hallelujah there's many gods in the world today but there is no God like our God Isaiah says it this way remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God God and there is none like me there is none like me yet there's many gods in the world today but there is none like our God you know David Siler said one time that had always stuck with me I believe he was over in India and he saw a man take some wood or brass and he fashioned himself out of God and Brother David said I watched that man sit down and we set that God Down and Worship the God that he made with his own hands but Brother David said as I was watching him I begin to think I'm so glad that I don't worship a God that I made with my hands but I worship the god that made me with his hands Hallelujah he is the true and the Living God Amen I'm so glad that's the god that we serve tonight not a dead God not a god of stone not a God that we pray to and cry to and tell our troubles true but he has no ability to answer back but we serve the god tonight who is our healer he is our deliverer amen he's a sustainer of our souls not a god of someone's imagination but we serve the god tonight who's able to answer back we serve a living God tonight he is Almighty he is all powerful he is full of Mercy his love is Everlasting amen there is no God like our God tonight we can cry out to him and he hears our cry he sees our tears Our God has the ability to not only hear us but to answer back praise the Lord praise the Lord he has the ability to answer yes sir amen Jeremiah 33:3 says it this way call unto me and I will answer thee not could be not maybe not hope so not if I hold my hands right not if I say come on somebody not if I say fancy words but God said if you call unto me I will answer thee and show thee Great and Mighty things which thou knowest not amen Jonah in the belly of a whale if there was ever a man who had symptoms there's never been anybody that's had more circumstances against him than this man Jonah is anybody here that not ever been swallowed by a great fish and yet he was swallowed by a great fish and what did he say in the midst of that fish F's belly he said I Cried unto the Lord I wasn't in church at an altar I was in a fish's belly but I cried out unto God Amen I cried by the reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell I cried and thou heardest my voice amen David says in Psalms in my distress I called upon the Lord I Cried unto my God and he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even into his ears who is like unto thee Oh God among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful In Praise doing wonders a wonderwork God not a God that can only do something when the prophet was here not a God that can only do something in the days of Pentecost with the rest restoration of the gifts but a god who's alive tonight who is the same yesterday today and forever well I don't have a gooseb brother Daryl we don't have a rushing wind we don't need a rushing wind tonight we've got the promise of God Amen Hallelujah emotions a lie to you Sensations AE to you Goosebumps will lie to you but the word of God will never lie to you oh Hallelujah yes amen amen fearful in Praises doing wonders doing wonders and wonders is what he did when he brought his children out of bondage with a mighty hand he drowned Pharaoh's Army in the sea the greatest army at that time with the greatest Soldiers the greatest weapons the best horses the best chariots and what happened to them but God by his mighty hand drowned them in the red see he proved that every god of the Egyptians was a dead God and that he was the true deliverer of his people and when Mariam saw her enemy was dead she just folded her arms and nodded her head and well that's that's pretty good that's no no no the Bible says she got into the spirit she grabbed up a tambourine and went up and down the bank dancing the prophet said that's kind of shocking isn't it dancing and beating tamarine and the daughters of Israel followed her beating Tamarin and dancing in the spirit if that ain't an oldfashioned Revival I don't know nothing about it Victory what was it it was victory in the camp amen there laid those dead ones laid up on the bank washed up on the bank the ones that had bothered them the ones that had ravished them the ones that had treated them like dogs laying there on the bank drowned by the hand of God brother it was time to dance I tell you brother D when I get to heaven I'm really going to dance I'm really going to shout I'm really going to have a good time that's wonderful I can't wait to see that well that's true I can't wait to be there that day the prophet said this is the quietest place you'll ever live I can't wait to get there that day and see the excitement and the joy but I say to you if you can see the promises of God if you can see that those promises are few are for you if you can see that he's your healer and he's your your deliverer if you can see he's done spoke us in a Rapture if you can see we have a pillar of fire if you can see we have a prophet messenger if you can see that we're in an exodus I say we can shout now we can dance now our enemy is defeated I said our enemy is defeated well you say he don't act like it neither does the snake when you cut its head off huh little boy come out of the house sucking on a lollipop and he walked out in the yard his daddy found a a rattlesnake in the garage cut his head off threw it out there in the yard the boy come out of the house and walking you know just you go dead there's a snake out here in the yard said' don't worry son I've killed it dad this must be another snake this one's moving oh no son it's the same snake his head's over there his body's over there it's the same one son he's dead I cut his head off he said well D he don't know it and sometimes oh Hallelujah sometimes you need to remind the devil you're defeated you need to remind the devil he broke your back in Calvary you're nothing but a bluff you have no hold on me you have you don't even have the keys to your [Applause] house now we're dealing the prophet said with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated Oh my he said I wish I was twice my size now maybe I feel twice as good we are disputing with a conquered enemy well brother Dar the devil said this and the devil said that and the devil told me this this week and the do you know what you're doing you're conversing with a conquered [Music] enemy oh God Amen you say but brother darl I'm the least one in the church I'm just the souls of his feet yeah I'm so glad you said that because I found a quote and the prophet said you know when I first started preaching they said if you want to be successful brother Joe say what the prophet said and I find the more I say what he said The more trouble I get into mostly from preachers but here's what he said is it all right to I quote what he says you say brother Brandon I'm the lead least one that's the souls of his feet but remember he's Triumph with you Triumph with you over every bit of it even if you're the souls of his feet every sickness every devil every Power even death itself is under your feet it's under you glory I don't feel like I 52 this morning this is the truth this is the truth if I can just get the church to see that brother will be a Triumph Church Believers in him all evil all evil all evil is under your feet oh look at your feet tonight you know what's under them every devil come on somebody every sickness oh hallelujah it's under my feet Hallelujah on the banks of the Red Sea they were having a Hallelujah big time you can't tell me that you can see an ocean par in front of you and walk over on dry land and see the Army that's chasing you drown behind you and not get excited amen they were having a Hallelujah they was oh my I tell you I remember the do you remember the day the Lord found you you remember that day when the Lord came to you and revealed to you that you Bel do you remember how happy you you were what happened we need to remember sometimes it's good to slow down and remember where we come from when they saw that their enemy Was Defeated they had a Hallelujah Big Time shouting and dancing and worshiping God even Moses sang in the spirit a great victory you remember when the oh no I know you don't remember I don't even remember I wasn't born but you look at history that when they surrendered when the the Germany then they turned their attention George Japan and when Japan surrendered and the war was over there was Victory oh my you can go back and look in New York City the tick or tape parade and all the things that they were doing when it was declared we got the Victory and that's the way they were when they real realize the one that beat them the one that Afflicted them would do it no more forever thank [Music] you oh Satan you're under my feet you're under my feet amen he ain't treading on you the devil ain't treading on you you're treading on him amen here they go through the Wilderness they're on their Journey where they headed to the promised land marching following the message of the Prophet following the pillar of fire on their way to the promised land being led by a God who can not fail the God that was leading them just parted the Red Sea and destroyed Egypt and the three days journey being led by God who cannot fail and after three days journey they find their first test they find theirself in a desert place with no water three days they marched all the families all their cattle all the mules all their animals every their children their wives everything they had a single day in the wilderness without water would have been tolerable two days would be difficult but three days would almost be impossible especially for the children the little ones the animals and after three days brother Jo of no water Brother David no water walking through the Wilderness I'll never forget when I was in the Army we was going on maneuvers I supposed to filled up my canteen but I didn't get a chance to do it was when I was in basic training I in Fort S Oklahoma it was in August hot I got out there without water I've never been so thirsty in all my life somebody i' never seen in my life I asked them to give me water from their canteen and they wouldn't do it three days that was just a few hours but I was so thirsty my lips my my tongue was so thick when I got water I drank like I've never drank before but here's three days in the wilderness in a desert place and after three days of no water all of a sudden someone yells out water there's a fountain of water and when that declaration went through the camp immediately everybody's Hearts was lifted up everybody was singing we're one of them we're one of them I'm so glad glad that I can say I'm one of them and they begin to run towards the water and maybe the kids were breaking rank headed towards the water and the Animals begin to smell it and they broke Rank and begin heading towards the water and the one that gets there first he runs up he gets down he takes the water get back get back get the kids back it's bitter it's bitter we can't drink it think about it think about it three days with no water they would have drank anything just a few hours with no water I was willing to to drink from a canteen of someone I never saw in My Life Dire situations will make you do things you never thought you would do in this situation they would have drank anything but God made this water so bitter that they could not drink it and let me say sometimes God will make a trial so hard he'll make the water so bitter that you can't accept nothing nothing less than a miracle that he will make the trial so hard so difficult the water so bitter that there would be nowhere else to look yes sir but him I'm talking about a desolate land I'm talking about desert places think about it the disappoint of finding water only to realize it's bitter that would only make the situation worse it would almost been better to find no water at all then to find water to have your hopes lifted up and then have them ripped out from under you when you realize you cannot drink drink the water to be so thirsty I'm about to kill myself to be so dry the dust from the desert the sweat the weariness to find water and it's so bitter you can't drink to hear your children say mama please pleas please mama let us have some of that water no honey mama can't let you drink it babe it's not good for you mama please no listen to me don't drink that water what would he do that yeah why would God lead us to water and it be bitter we're his people we follow his message we listen to Moses why the bitter water they cried out m a bitter land a bitter land they called the place Mora a bitter land but think think about this just three days before they were singing shouting dancing singing how great their God was just three days just Sunday just Sunday shouting and sing and rejoicing and by Wednesday sir murmuring right complaining scared upset how soon they forgot days the Red Sea Revival ain't it something how we let our emotions right control our reactions you know some people you can tell when they're up and you can tell when they down right by how they act in church sir yes sir maybe you should have preached tonight buddy think about it how soon they forgot the Red Sea B how quickly their counts changed when they arrived at Mora the bitter [Applause] Le how soon they changed and it's in those moments it's in those moments of time when the doctor says I'm sorry there's nothing we can do yeah when you lose your job when the bitterness comes in your marriage disappointments and situations turns against you it's those moments in time that Satan likes to take advantage and start spewing out his lies can you imagine the LI that tempted to overtake them yeah and sat and begin to speak to them this God of yours delivered you out of Egypt where you had food you had water to drink and he brought you out of that and brought you three days in the desert to die and to tempt you with water that you can't even drink some God your servant some cruel God yeah amen and it's in that moment when Satan begins to spew out his lies that's so easily play on our feelings and our emotions it's that moment that every fear surfaces amen and it was at that moment that all they saw all they saw was death it was a bitter situation indeed think about that you see the devil he only wants you to see the x-rays and the MRIs the drug addictions he only wants you to see the marital situation the fear the pain the No Way Out situation he wants you to see the storm but not the sun he wants you to see the bars of a prison door but he don't want you to see that it's open I said he doesn't want you to see that the prison door is open that's what he wants you to see he wants you to see the problem but not the solution yeah the storm but not the Sun the S so n how do you know that brother darl because I've been there amen so this brought them to this situation Brother D but think about this have have you ever thought about this if he can take one water problem and fix it one yes can he take another water problem and fix it you see the Red Sea oh God the Red Sea and the bitter water was both water problems that's good brother right right yes sir righty but if he took care of the water problem at the Red Sea canot take care of the water problem in the land of bitterness what are you saying I'm saying this if he can heal cancer of skin cannot heal cancer of the bone cancer of the liver cancer of the breast cancer of the brain if he can bring one prodical son home cannot he bring All prodical Sons home if he can restore one marriage cannot he restore all marriages on yes sir yes sir if he delivered you once if he delivered you once anybody here ever been delivered if he done it once cannot he do it again I say tonight yes he can but all they saw was death right right bitter undrinkable water in a desert place and it caused them to murmur against Moses just three days before shouting the Victory and now they're up in the same one oh God think about it the same ones that was running the aisle was now in moses' face saying what are we going to drink run what are we doing here you see God was leading him to the promised land that he said was already theirs well if God was bringing him to a Promised Land why didn't he bypass this land of bitterness but he didn't bypass it he led them right straight to it yeah amen the problem was the Israelites didn't see a way they didn't see a way around this problem but God did the test was for the Israelites was a question of faith in what they couldn't see you see if you understand everything that's going on that ain't Faith that's knowledge but we don't serve God by knowledge we serve him by faith we look to the Unseen and many times he asks us to walk a path that he doesn't reveal to us but you've got to remember he is still in control he has never lost control never never ever has he ever lost control they didn't see that the test for the Israelites was a question of faith in what they couldn't see but but you see without the bitter water there would been no opportunity for God to perform a miracle that day amen amen he is the God of Wonders but if there was no bit water that would have been no wonder right oh God are you seeing the picture without the bit of water been been no opportunity for God to before per a miracle the most difficult situations in our life are opportunities for God to do miraculous things and to turn our bitter situations sweet the desert places in our life the bitter lands in our life it's just an opportunity for God to show you just how great he is you see when Jessica was blind and God opened her eyes I told her God would provide a lamb for her eyes and he did he opened her eyes and someone bought Jessica a lamb because they heard what the Lord did for her and they wanted her to have a little lamb well the lamb was free but the electric fence to put him in was about 200 bucks so I put it up and I turned it on and I was sitting there after I put oh my God I was Sting right I put put that fence up and turned it on drinking water sweating a little bit and I thought I wonder if it's on so I took the water poured it on the fence I'm here to tell you don't do that do not if you don't hear anything I get if you don't get anything out of this message you get that do not pour water on an electric fence when you're sitting on the ground so I told Jessica I said now K she's just a little old thing four year old five something like that I said' now K listen to Daddy if you want to touch that fence you tell Daddy I'll turn it off and you can go through the fence and pet the lamp I said but if you touch it while that red light is on it'll shock you honey I said it'll burn you do you understand yes daddy yes Daddy I understand intellectual conception right God's A Healer intellectual conception so as I working on a tractor that I had at that time and all at once I heard Kai Go sir was on the front porch I said honey better go see about her she's got into that fence so I thought you know maybe she needs some daddy's loving so I I left the tractor you know crawled through the bar went down there where she's at little old thing big old blue eyes had her hand like this she's holding it like that tears coming down her face and she said she looked up at me she said don't touch that wire Daddy it's hot you said she before it was me telling her but after she experienced it after she experienced the shock it was her it was her telling me and God can tell you I'm a great God I'm a big God I'm your healer and you must say yes Lord yes Lord I believe that it's elal conception but get sick and watch God heal you oh Hallelujah then you can tell the world I was blind but now I see I couldn't walk but now I can the cancer disappeared out of my body hallelujah it's not him telling us then it's us telling the world amen amen the murmurings the murmurings against Moses made Moses cry out to God yes sir yeah if you want to have your morab bitterness healed then you have to take your case in prayer to God you see God begins by making us begin I know you didn't get that cuz you got awful quiet but he's an answering God he's a prayer answering God but somebody has to pray first he didn't say I'll answer you then you call but he said you call I'll answer amen amen amen so if you want to be healed of your Affliction if you want to get out of that desert place that land of bitterness there's no better way than I know than to call on your God didn't Brother David just sing it tonight we cry unto our God lord you have not because you ask not and when you you do ask you really don't believe it's going to happen it'll never happen like that if you mix your faith with doubt it'll never happen it's a hybrid Faith you've got to believe God regardless of what anything says it don't matter what the doctor says it don't matter what anybody says God said he heals me that's right amen amen God begins by making you begin the people be they complained to Moses Moses took the complaint to his master and all of our trials and all of our desert places and all of our bitter Waters the shest way to a victory is through prayer you see the greatest weapon that you hold in your hand tonight is the weapon of prayer the prophet of God said that prayer was more powerful than an atomic bomb man nor demons can stand in the presence of prayer matter of fact the prophet of God said when the weakest Christian gets on their needs to pray all hell trembles that means the privates the corporals the lieutenants the captains all come on somebody all demons tremble oh hell trembles and the most wonderful thing about it is as soon as you have a prayer God has the remedy thank you Lord hallelujah notice in 15:25 Exodus 15:25 Moses he said and Moses Cried unto the Lord yes sir and the Lord showed him a tree which when he cast into the water the waters were made sweet wow there he made them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them as soon as Moses Cried unto God God showed him a tree wow but you know the most wonderful thing when I was studying this at 1:30 this morning and I was looking at this and he just come to me the most wonderful thing about this is the answer answer to the bitterness think about this the answer to the bitter water was always there it was always there brother D it didn't have to show up they didn't have to bring it in on an Amazon truck it was always there God the tree had been growing there for years years before before they ever knew they needed the tree God do have the tree provided oh God that don't make the pope shout the answer to their fear the answer to your sickness the answer to your problems was here it was here before you ever had a problem that's true amen hallelujah is that not true how many thousands of years ago was this written I am the Lord that Health thee by his stripes you were healed bastans here not long ago I was in a restaurant and the waitress come by and say would there be anything else I said no ma'am just just a check and she said 'well somebody saw you in here said they paid for your meal and I said ' really she said yes and I said well let me at least leave a leave leave a tip she said no they took care of the tip too so if there's not anything else you can go that's about the way I look just but you see I could have done one or two things I could have said ma'am I don't see nobody in this restaurant that I know are you sure you've got the right T are you sure it's talking about me you see that's one of the biggest problems because there's not a person in this building that will will say that God's Not A Healer everybody in this building will admit God Is A Healer is that not true but where the problem is is when it comes down but will he heal me it always always comes down to you yeah God's A Healer but the doctor said it's the worst so I could said ma'am are are you are you sure you're talking about me I'm a nobody I don't even know anybody in this town are you sure it's me I could have looked around I could have said no no no no no no let me try to do something see that's always the problem we try to do something let let me try to do something let let me pay for it you know just just in case no I said now wait a minute you want me to get up and walk out that door so it Go ding ding ding and you can say he stole a steak no if you're done get up and leave right because your meal has already been paid for and the prophet said that day at Calvary that Not only was salvation p paid for but so was your healing your healing has already been paid for you don't have to argue about it debate it try to figure out what's he talking about me he's talking about you and all you've got to do you don't have to pump it up work it up somebody don't have to deserve something over you listen to me even if they do deserve something over you that doesn't heal you you're healed by faith believing in what he's already done for you preach brother down I [Applause] will amen you see tonight oh I got to hurry there's two reports before you I told my sister this yesterday I said there's two reports before you a doctor's report and Isaiah's report right yes Lord Isaiah 53 sir by stripes we are healed I said those two reports are before you I said now but what you got to understand is that the doctor's report sometimes it's exactly right ain't that right brother Keith you've been in medicine I've been there when it's the correct diagnosis right sometimes they are absolutely right but sometimes they are absolutely wrong is that right brother Keith yeah that's why it's called practicing medicine just in case you wondered why they call it that yeah yes sir so I told her I said you know sometimes they're right but sometimes they're wrong so you don't really know you can't anchor there because it could be it could not be it might be it might not be but Isaiah's report is yay and yay God is Not WR sometime and right sometime he is right all the time 100 times out of a 100 God will keep his word so if you're going to hang on a report tonight I would hang on to Isaiah's report for by his stripes I am [Applause] healed I hear all that brother darl but but but but this problem but this problem brother Daryl this this listen to me you may not see the sweet in the bitter yet but hold on hold on and have faith have faith God works all things for the good all things for the good to bring the sweet according to Romans 8:28 the next time you come to your morah instead of panicking instead of wanting to give up instead of starting to miss church right yeah instead of panicking have faith that the god you serve is a God who will turn the bitter water to Sweet for the glory of his name in a desert place in a desert Place God shows his greatest power his greatest Miracles comes in a desert place thank you Lord you see God chose them God chose them to bring them to a place where they had to rely on and trust him completely yes sir you see we're living in the age when he's the head of the body and the body must totally depend on the head oh that's right yes your feet don't tell you to get up in the morning your head does amen amen so he brings us to these places that we trust him completely instead of looking to the water for Life think about this he didn't want them to look to the water for life cuz if they had come up and drank the water and it was sweet they would have just went on he didn't want them to do that he wanted them to look to him oh God hallelujah thank thank you Lord do you trust the god tonight who delivered you do you trust that God to carry you through you see the Israelites they didn't see water that they could drink they didn't see the water that they could drink but God did God saw the sweet in the bitter you know why cuz he provided it it was already provided the answer was already there he just said trust me right trust me in a desert Place God shows his greatest power amen can can I just look at another one right fast sir in Luke 9:12 it's the it's the 5,000 that was fed not counting the women and the children and the Bible says when the day began to wear away they came the 12 and said unto Jesus send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and the country and roundabout and lodge and get viddles for we are here in a desert place and that desert Means A wilderness desolate solitary lonely desolate uninhabited we are in a desert place these people are hungry they're tired they're weary send them away that they can go into the villages and the towns and find some food and Jesus said to his disciples who were in a desert place you feed them they had been in this place all day and had come towards the evening time it was far spent they were tired they were weary sounds a lot like Lea they were tired they were weary yeah but in this desert place in this condition they were fixing to see just how great their God was for in a desert place came A great miracle they were tired they were weary they were hungry and he fed them the children of Israel was tired they were weary they were thirsty and he gave them sweet water yes he did you may be in your desert place you may have arrived in the land of bitter water but maybe you're there maybe you're there for your greatest Miracle brother Keith maybe you're there buddy for your greatest Miracle Hallelujah in the desert place in your land of Mora why don't you do like Moses and cry unto the Lord and let God show you the tree that's always been there you see this tree I'm talking about is not a tree out here in the backyard it's not a high Bush but the tree I'm talking about tonight is calvary's tree the answer to every problem we have is in that tree the loneliness the Heartbreak the weariness the depression the nervousness the glycom the arthritis the diabetes the cancer right the mental problems the bipolarism thyroid condition ition I got a letter with sure got a text this week from a sister that was in the meetings in Arizona back in February down to Tucson said tell brother Daryl the Lord's completely healed me I'm completely healed I got a handkerchief in the mail the other day from Canada said brother Daryl here's your handkerchief back I'm completely healed have no idea who was even from just somebody I gave a handkerchief to but that's our God friends that's the god that we serve tonight and he wants to heal you he he wants to heal you a thousand times more than you want to be healed and sometimes we come into these places it's not because God hates us it's so that God can show us just how great he is just how great he is amen great amen calvary's tree every problem the answer lays in that tree amen T so sweet T so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him at his word he makes bitter Waters in the land of bitterness he brings forth Sweet Water for there at calish tree he paid the price to have the ability to turn all your bitter Waters to sweet thank you Lord Sweet Water water in a bitter land David said in Psalms 1387 though I walk in the midst of trouble thou Wilt revive me yes though I walk in the midst of trouble thy will revive me Thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me in the midst of my troubles when I walk in the midst of my troubles he will revive me that word revive it means to have life to remain alive to sustain life to live Prosper to live forever to be quickened to be alive to be restored of Health to have life to continue in life to remain alive to sustain life to live on to live prosperously Amen to be quickened from sick from discouragement from faintness from Death to restore life in the time of my trouble he will restore me Lord notice David didn't say if I walk in the midst of trouble but he said though I walk because I promise you friends as long as we're here we will have bitter lands amen amen but ever bitter land is only an opportunity for him to take the bitter water and turn it sweet to show you just how great he is you see David understands that they will be trouble he acknowledges that there will be troubles but he said in the midst of those troubles he will will not could be not maybe but he will revive me in the time of my troubles in the land of bitter Waters he will make my water sweet you see when my mama had cancer many years ago she said something that always stayed with me she said darl she said darl I may have cancer but cancer does not have me there you go I may have troubles I may have trials I may have disappointments I may have times of weariness but they do not have me I'm in the hand of my Creator yay the I walk through the valley of shadow of death thou art with me I rod and my staff they comfort me th anointest my head with W yes sir the prophet said I think a lot of times today the reason we get in tight places is God wants to reveal and to show us his love I think sometimes the reason we get into tight places is God wants to reveal and to to show us his love and to prove to us that he's the same God yesterday today and forever and his power is still the same certainly he said he wants to show his power God likes to manifest his power the prophet said maybe that's why you got sick maybe
