[Applause] [Music] just in et now the Lord is coming he'll be returning for you and me well I've been watching just any day now or his face I'll see I might stop and take the time to look around me I see the signs of his appearing everywhere but things he said they come to pass they're now before us and I feel a strange excitement in the head and just need a now [Music] [Applause] [Music] and just any day now on your space I'll see oh there's this longing in my heart for disappearing I'll gladly leave behind missile trials here below well this journey has been long Lord I'm so weary but sometimes I feel I'm closer closer home raise your hands a place to City day now [Music] just a need on his face I'll see just any day now and just still need a down hold his face I'll see you [Music] d it seemed like a good idea yesterday to tell brother Louie I had a song when I'm in my truck driving down the road and singing it it seemed like it was alright but this song basically says I've come too far to turn back and there's nothing that the devil can put on the other scale in my life too that outweighs my lord and my love for my lord he never said there never be heartaches no he never as I recall and he never said the path was an arrow but as I see the little sparrow when it falls he never said there wouldn't B times you spin with your back to the [Laughter] oh but to me anytime I've walked with my Jesus and I'll never look back to it all too many try I'm sorry a mountain and too many times I've faced this cruel Oh [Applause] we never ride first ed his love cause my fountain in Satan can hold enough to turn back Oh some may not hear it and other furs may fear it oh and many made out there it's real but I'm just a sample on earthly example of an empty vessel [Applause] spear my life was so broken till these words were spoken let body since he put it all together there's no kind of weather that can ever caused me to stray from his way [Music] time I've climbed up life's mountain two men times a face the cruel world say I first did his love war my fountain and Satan can't hold enough to turn back Oh [Music] he is loved my fountain knackered and old Satan can't hold enough to turn back Oh thank you [Music] many feels that way tonight with all your heart where would you go we're on a world would you go a man Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23 a man we know where we're going we're going up a man let's look again tonight at the parallel of the church the marriage between a man and woman what God puts them together how God reflects it from the Old Testament through the new into the New Jerusalem Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything they go along with and everything that they don't go along with then I must have been the Queen James Version so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church man that loves his wife right it helps take up the difficulty of verse 20 for a man that doesn't love his wife right and yet demands subjection and for a lot Oh be daeun ceccolini ver never be able to operate and function properly because the head itself is not functioning right but if the man doesn't do his part and doesn't eliminate the woman from doing hers if the woman doesn't do her part doesn't eliminate the man from doing his so you get on a merry-go-round well she don't well he don't she don't he don't none of that won't hold water and you stand before the Lord no he don't since she don't swim they ever get you through the gates it's gonna take our wheels not he don'ts and she don'ts husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it let's bow our heads together and we'd like to be remembered tonight before the Lord in prayer amen Lord Jesus thank you for your precious word father we're so grateful that we can be gathered together again tonight Lord to be able to hear your thoughts to hear your words a pray father that you would help us that we would be able to open up our very hearts to your spirit tonight we desire to hear from your heart Lord Jesus we count on an honor that we would breathe so privileged to be able to hear from the heart of God to hear your law is a wonderful thing to hear your Commandments it's a wonderful say yet father we know one day the law the commandments they were ceased to exist but the heart of God we'll be through eternity so we desire to serve you from your heart so if you project to us from your heart to ours even as a woman finds herself in subjection to her husband so we as the bride that projection makes all the commandments the do's and the don'ts makes them so much easier for those who try to live this word just by simply complying under the stage of sanctification and I can't go here and I can't do that can't say this I can't were that have to give up this have to stop that they'll never never understand the joy of living for you but if they can ever get it from your heart to theirs it becomes a pleasure speak to us tonight and that pleasure form father in Jesus name and the Saint said I bless you may be seated 1st Corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 but I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ now here we come to real godly headship a woman will never be able to find her place under any man unless that man is under Christ now I'm not talking about man throwing quotes around and the man throwing scriptures but I'm talking about the man himself being under the headship of the Lord Jesus any true daughter of God that she may be strong nature she may battle and wrassle was being submissive but if she's truly born again from her soul she longs for a man that she can be able to respect and be able to be under his headship if she's a real believer but she will never be able to do that IFS a man himself is not where he needs to be now he can demand and she can march in tune and signal and salute and left right left right left right if that's what he wants his home to be but this is not what Paul is even writing about now notice how he introduces divine headship I would have you know that the head of every man notice again now we bring back to the original creation of the family in the Garden of Eden God is by divine protocol giving his order of creation and that way he makes the man first and he does not make him a little boy he does not make him a seven-year-old child a ten-year-old child sixteen year old child but he makes him a man a man right now notice his sisters for those who fall in love with their little boy more than they do their husband there's something wrong with your love or something wrong with your husband or something only both but God made him to be a man this is God's order then he lives for however long in the Garden of Eden then God does not bring a son out of the man or a daughter out of the man but he brings a woman out of the man not a wife first a woman a man a woman then a husband and a wife now you sisters that are looking for a husband let me give you just a little bit of advice you watch that man that you're interested in see the makeup of his daddy of his mama his grandmother and his grandfather his uncle that you can't stand and realize and when he hits about 30 to 35 or 40 he may wind up being like that uncle that you don't like now and also keep in mind that his habits before what he's professed to have as the new birth may show up again later if he don't really have it because whatever he is will repeat its cycle without the new birth annihilates that old nature he may keep it a press for a long time so makes your sisters when you're looking at it don't just look always a Christian he's in church all that's well and good but that's a lot different from being filled with the Holy Ghost that's right and you look at what he done in sin and keep a good idea in mind that if that boy ain't born again if he's just professing that he is he'll wind up being that and worse a few years down the road except being you're his wife well praise the Lord amen now notice this is why that God sets the order of the home in this way so Paul said I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God now you see a real man a real son of God has no problem was Christ being his head because Christ himself now what is Christ Christo's the Anointed One it is that what's condon sin out of the eternal now this is not to people we're talking about it is not a tri unity and I got hit but God even shows divine headship and The Anointed One now remember Jesus when he was born the angel told Mary you will call his name Jesus he did not tell her you would call him the Lord Jesus Christ that would have been an error thou shalt call his name Jesus the name of the human body was Jesus well somebody's looking at me bug I all the Jesus only is always stiffen up on you when you go this way now he was called Jesus at his verse but he received the fullness of the baptism of the Holy Ghost at the river then he was Christ then when he died raised up from the dead then he moves into the supreme office of this same Jesus asked God made both Lord and Christ then of course he's identified as Lord Jesus Christ so the Christ is under divine headship of the eternal now the eternal never began so you see a real true man has no problem with real headship himself but a man who never really comes under headship it's gonna be an awful husband to any wife well praise the Lord my early Oh everybody ready good for the man notice now the man is under this headship of Christ as Christ which has a beginning is under the headship of that which never started and we know that God is now looking at it and running the parallel between the man and the woman as it is was Christ and the church so the man is the head of the woman we looked at this word but let's look at it again the word head since the loss of the head destroys life this word is extremely used in the phrases relating to capital and extreme punishment metaphorically it's anything supreme chief prominent of persons a master or a lord of a husband in relation to his wife of christ the lord of the husband and the church of things the corner stone now then the man is the head of the llama and the church said both men and women said the man is the head of the woman but now related in the right way as God is the head of Christ and Christ is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman now this is real headship whenever I hear men talking about headship and the only thing they talk about is how obedient their life should be to them they're missing very important more elements and you know right there they don't have a clue about what we're talking about they don't have it in divine order all they think it is is them snapping their fingers no I've been there like a little puppy dog yes master yes master what did you want myself you don't need a wife you need a dog pound yeah now Paul goes on to say now in verse 8 the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man I remember him saying this we're going back to the original creation actually before the man ever fell and I remember God made the man and he did not have to grow as far as from a young boy our teenager a preteen a teenager in his twenties but he was a man when God made him and then God of course makes the woman ish and his shy out of the man so God never made him a husband first because there was nothing there to make him a husband he must have a counterpart which would be the wife so God made him a man in making this the man live and in right display of the proximity of the attributes of God in the Garden of Eden for who knows how long it would have been unbecoming for God to have made him in the office of a husband and had nothing there to be able to meet that need or be the counterpart of that attribute so God made him in his first position and that was a man so the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and then of course about all the animals and so on saw then we see the man's position changes as the Lord God brings something out of the man to bring him into his own position so it was the creation of the woman that actually exalted the man and lifted the man out of his first dispensation and that was the state of being a man alone but it was the creation of the woman coming out of his own body which now exalts him into a higher position I ought to be rejoicing with me because the same thing happened to the Lord Jesus now when the Lord Jesus of course being the logos being the Christ he was that one who went out of the eternal of course many many eons of years ago but yet he could not be able to walk into that position of being husband or bridegroom until there was a bride actually given it was all an attribute States of course first but once the bride was going to be burst than that but then himself exalts him to the position where he can now be fulfilled of what his heart and longed to be for many many millennia and we are now helping fulfill that desire of the Almighty God aren't you glad for that so in that Paul reverse back to this in verse 8 and says the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man and we know even whenever a woman today will give birth to a baby boy that God is not doing in the same general way as it was in the very beginning because now it is a mixture of the DNA the genes are chromosomes all that together and the woman is not the man of the boy is not the see of the woman but the boy is actually the product of the woman holding him and carrying it in a room of course and the navel cord attached to that but the woman cannot do that without the man so Paul is relating out to the original creation that God never actually took Adam out of Eve but it was the other way around now showing this with headship but remember the headship does not just stop in a home it's the same way with the church so Jesus Christ was not made for you but you were made for him now the church has got it all turned around and they make Jesus name his blood everything that he is it's a third disposal they can use it abuse it make fun of it ridicule it do whatever they want to because the way they got it that's typically at us in the way they've got it he was made for them so if they wanna blaspheme his name they can do it and he's obligated to forgive them though he's not in the building of the house of the human temple in the beginning God places it in the cycle of the Divine Protocol and that was the man first then of course with that comes a great responsibility then the man being first he's given the responsibility to be like Christ and yet brothers you may sit here and wonder tonight my goodness what a thing that God puts upon us he does but yet in reality it is well worth the responsibility one of these days you brothers and men just like you around the world that is lives since this gospel has been introduced 2,000 years ago one day you will take your wives and you will take your children which will be grown of course by the hem will all be the same age you will take them by the hand as it were and you will enter into that blessed land and to Eternity and you will walk in there with an awesome responsibility being fulfilled in your hearts and your lives before God and God will look at you men that have faithful and God will reward you accordingly now you may never preach you may never be a missionary you may never do anything like that but yet in one sense of the word you are the pastor of your home you are the one in your home that is supposed to be the head of that home or the house band that holds that home together so what kind of church have you men got there if you're passing your church what kind of church do you have now but whenever we arrive that day and you men will stand there before God and give an account and then your wife can be able to turn and look at you and say God I'll thank you for giving me such a man I thank you for giving me such a man Lord you knew i was the weaker vessel you knew I needed a man of integrity to help me along the way you knew I needed a man that would help me in the land of seeing aids that you chose me to live that would be able to guide me in a man that I could be able to look up to and a man that I could signal or you'll give me a man God that I well I want to stand your guard and thank you for giving me such a husband I believe there's a man sitting here like that tonight I believe it all my heart that's exactly right now with the responsibility will also come the delivery because as Christ will present to himself a bride without spot or wrinkle so were the godly sons of God that marry their mate in time and listen carefully those sons of God that find their mate in time and they married that mate and through that Union together of the election of God their hearts are joined together because their souls are joined together before the foundation of the world they will achieve that type of oneness in this life before they ever walked through the gates of paradise because they have already been deposited in the same timeframe the same church age and they wound up meeting one another maybe one lived in Indiana lived in who knows where that God allowed for their paths across and they came together and there was a tide from the soul and they begin to join and God began to move on their home and begin to give them that something and the man was exactly what the woman needed and the woman was exactly what the man needed they will begin to reflect heaven while they are still here in this mortal body in these five senses the very headship of Christ over the church will be seen in them as the headship of God is seen over Christ men can't you see why well I keep preaching at you and telling you what a great thing that it is for you to send well what a miserable thing that would be that day if you jump and shout and scream and holler and you stand up before God and your wife has to send and say God my man was the weakest thing that ever was he was as weak as a dishrag he was as weak as all get-out a topsy turvy today he's going to make up his mind he's going to serve him next week he don't know what he's gonna do god I'll tell you one thing he added to my burdens what a horrible thing for a wife to say about her husband well praise the Lord oh my now notice what sis then comes this responsibility but Paul makes it clear which many folks miss when they read this both women and men as well in that Paul is identifying a partnership which comes in in view with the headship so there is a partnership that comes in view it's not like a general with our boot camp that he's getting everybody the orders go here and go there my orders are not to be questioned and don't you question me on one thing that's not the way God does us and we know that's certainly not the kind of relationship he wants among his sons and daughters it'll never produce the product of God so many miss the partnership aspect now look at this but my head here tonight contains my brain it contains the base of course of the stem it contains the different peripherals of my brain that control my sight they control so many other but what if I took a knife tonight or one of you did it for me and you totally removed my head from off my shoulders and then you set it down on top of this pulpit here now all of the counter parts by which my head are supposed to move on now detached and there's no way if my head would be able to live of course it could not but if it could live very long at all and I would still be having thoughts finger move foot move or move twist do this that the other there's nothing to be able for it to respond to what is missing the union of partnership or the union of connection by which by blood flow and nerves and systems and all of that that will never comes in your mind within just a half a second or three-quarters of a second then your hand begins to move your arm moves your foot moves whatever it is because the head is setting down on the body so what if the head and the rest of the body is fighting all the time so why you're sending Church you just set there and smack yourself and then all of a sudden you reach over just kicked the far a t-cell and then you just reach over and just grab a hold your big cheek and just paints and paints and pings well I'm gonna tolerate that for a little bit and then I'm on how I'm afraid I'm gonna have to have the Deacons come and dismiss you because you're gonna draw more attention that the word is and I can handle that that be something wrong with you you agree with me well how is it then that folks think that the man being the head that he can be so detached by love by commitment by intimate affection for his life and it's all orders orders orders orders orders it'll never be right there's no partnership that's dwelling among the members what is it dictatorship and that's not what God wants in the church or in the family now god of course designed the woman as far as her body shivers in God's thinking we know that that God was going to do it and he was going to take her we know from the rib out from under the heart designated by that the joint partner bye what's the man what identify himself now the man of course he's a bachelor before he gets married he has his own life his own thing the way does this out the other many men never grow out of that they still have bachelor ways they don't feel like they're responsible to their wife they can do anything in the world I think they want to do everybody in the family answers to them and they answer to nobody wake up mr. Hitler and you claim you got the Holy Ghost you may have a Holy Goose but you ain't got no Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is subject to the Word of God you ain't got the sense God gave a goose if that's what you think a headship is you are under headship yourself that is the headship of Christ the word a man now as the hair being attached to the body and all these circuitry of course made by God in order to make it work so is it inside the home whenever the man being the head the man himself and the very life flow coming from the brain yet the brain along I cannot be able to make the body live take your kidneys out see how long you live without them take your liver out certain things of course in your body you can live without many parts of your body which are not your brain how do most people know you by your hand or by your head most of you wouldn't even know my hand because you don't get to shake it that often most of you wouldn't even know the hand of your brother because you don't sit that much most of us don't start folks hands but yet what do they know one another the most by their head their face that's the way we know them on occasion maybe their profile or the back of their head but for the most part it is their head but that's not who all they are they are also kidneys they are pancreas they are liver by our gallbladder I've never seen your gallbladder not sure I would care to him but yet that's who you are as well but what is it that I know you barber the Dell it is your face and it's the same way in the body of Christ same way in the home now then that the man gets his physician then it helps a woman to be able to get into hers notice again in verse not neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man now the man was not created to be subservient to the warmer that the woman snaps her fingers and the man goes here and goes I said sat down and shut up yes ma'am oh brother Donnie I'm not him Pat and hope assume you men got hen house ways so what's the difference well praise the Lord well hallelujah hey man how does a woman have a say in a home sure she does Paul said she runs the house a ma'am so she have a say she does but yet when it comes to the final decisions made in a home it should be the man and the woman trying to prayerfully be able to consider what's the best for the home what's the best for us as far as what church we're going to you know whatever more in our life let us pray honey let's do this and that in the other that we can be able to find the will of God for our lives God never made the man to be subservient to the woman neither did God to make the woman to be a doormat under the man's feet praise the Lord the man is to defend the woman as a matter of fact if it would come right down to it and they're one of their lives is going to be taken a true man of their lives is why we'll give his life for his wife all brother Donnie I do it I do it well show me everyday and then we'll take care of that at the end of the way okay show me how much you love her just by the way you live to order now yet this was not in the original creation of course in the way that it's going to merge together but yet I to the fall then of God of course introduces the double covenant and introduces polygamy and animal creation how that is brought in and we know because of ant-man's fallen nature that man needed a savior I tried the save here what did God use God in the bread projecting the prophecies of the Savior to come to the earth God never used a man in bringing the Savior to the earth now God did not raise up another Adam and then out of Adam's side bring Jesus to Christ out of head inside but God brought the Christ out of not Eve or Mary's side but out of her womb yet it was not her life it was not in any of her DNA nothing of her whatsoever she was simply just a womb that God borrowed to be able to carry this child is this right not of a blood absolute in our creation of God and out of there God is now going to bring the second Adam yet it will not be hers in the sense that she genetically or by DNA can claim him at all but God gave her a seed well if you say men that God give her one why do you keep phrasing argument with me when I say God give you one that's right now the woman was made for the man and when the man you or that lace and a little godly woman now the man may not be one notice I said this if any man obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives what power that lays in a Holy Ghost filled woman well praise God was her a woman here that even said a mintue there my goodness we want to place it all in the man and all on the preacher friends that's not all the Bible says now here is a godly woman this fill of the Holy Ghost that the Spirit of God anointed Peter to write about her you do believe this that this godly woman now she came to reach of course and he doesn't go that way but appreciating but he said that the man would actually be one without the word so the woman is succour to god I'll tell you one thing my man oh my god you better straighten up to high round turning over to the devil corner god it's her conversation not or preaching I know most of you sisters won't act like you don't preach at home I don't believe that for most of you you most of you're a woman preachers some of yous read it's a pickle bit now notice this likewise you wives be in subjection different word who Pluto so put under be subject to submit oneself unto to arrange under to subordinate to yield to ones admonition or advice my lord even the man they say them in their now come on brothers even the word we use this got your title in it a man we don't say a woman that meaning of this word is is compound and look at the latter part of this a Greek military term meaning to arrange troops troop divisions in a military fashion under the command of a leader in non militaries it was a voluntary attitude they say the problem of the law the message men is that they use them all at the military side they didn't use the non-military use yes sir well sir well praise the Lord but it is God's order for wives to be in subjection to their husbands praise go you know it doesn't mean now that the woman is evil and wicked and bad I mean some are but I'm talking about Saints you know sisters because that she's in that position but we see everything in the order of God that is made in such a way there is only one Sun in our solar system yet there are trillions of stars and millions possibly or trillions of moons we only have one but yet we only have one son now if they both were of the same luminosity then we could look at the moon at night which will be as bright as the Sun and would be 24 hours of sunlight but God made one great light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night and she rules by borrowed light from her head so what is the head of the moon the Sun because without the Sun the moon has no life right so whenever we look at the moon whether she's in the quarter cycle hype cycle three-quarters or full it is all borrowed light from the Sun in the way that God put them in order so we see the order of God in the universe so God only made one Sun and he gave us we know that Mars and Jupiter and other other planets have their own moons some of them have multiple moons but we only have one but under the order of God for our planet God gave us the Sun as it did others in this galactic place where we are but yet he only gave us this moon by this great reflection which would come upon her she's humble she bears only reflection of the light she has no light within herself if the Sun does not shine upon her she remains in darkness perfect epitome of a Christian take Christ out of our lives we are nothing take Christ out of our lives take the glory out of our lives who are miserable that's right so this is God's protocol so how does the moon shine she shines by borrowed reflected light from the Sun under whose command the command of God and what do you see you see the structure of the whole so then God making the Sun and then out of the Sun coming all these clinkers that come out so what come out of the Sun he gave birth to his own wife which was the moon so then the Sun shines upon the moon and the moon in turn reflects it back to her the earth the dust people on the earth so God wrote the order of divine protocol of the family of God in the heavens before he ever had a man on the earth praise the Lord does that mean that the moon is not important you know the moon is important whenever the moon turns her back look at what the tide does look at all the different things that the moon has an effect and the way that we plan things even you know yourself that one bit women are going to have babies you watch the cycle of the moon how many babies will be born in the full moon you watch how many folks who wind up going to the middle place whenever the full moon comes a friend that's not a bunch of wives fables this is scientifically proven because the moon has an effect upon the earth where she ever takes the sons place of course not and she doesn't want to she bears this image of the Sun in her humble way man has walked on the moon man has stepped on the moon but man has never stepped on the Sun and never will because the Sun would consume him man talks about the church man read it kills the church and God will allow it for so long you know the atmosphere being so thin upon the moon that a footprint or track print being placed upon there by Rover vehicle well I shall lay that for hundreds of years and never be disturbed because the atmosphere on the moon is so still hardly nothing moves it's the original footprints of the original astronauts are still there laying like they were in the early 60s when they were made all the Land Rovers and things that they write across if they're still there the tracks are still there because her atmosphere is still thin so shallow that mysterious thin and shallow we need a mighty God we need a big God no matter how late we all would still moon and we still need the power of God on our lives so the moon then reflects the woman in the home and the Sun reflects the man the moon reflects the church the Sun reflects Christ there's nothing out icater with that is there that's the way God made it does that mean the wife is not important she's very important you take a Gandhian woman out of a home and a man try to run the home by himself God never intended it to be that way God never intended him to be a single mother trying to race kids God never intended her to be a single father trying to raise kids for the Lord God took them together from the man and the woman in the Garden of Eden what's work should come forth in children comes after that divine union of God now that does not mean that the woman is some poor in a wretched creature that many folks want to project us as the message and let me just be a force against that line devil that's trying to go around this message anyway oh these people that have left it and try to project that we make the women of the message dogs that is an absolute lie and you go to hell for life the women of this message they have been given a godly and wonderful position they are not dogs they are not to be trampled on they are to be treated like Queens well praise the Lord now in saying that a husband's love being so great for his wife does not eliminate the woman's desire and godly call to be in subjection to that husband because his love no matter how great it will be it never overrides that well my husband loves me so much I just do whatever I want to do no that's what the layer to see in church thinks about Christ they think Christ loves them so much that they can do whatever they want dress how I want live how they want say whatever they want drink whatever they want do anything they want to do cuz Christ loves them so much so you sisters don't want to think that while my husband loves me so much I'm just free to do whatever I want to do no you're still under the subjection word and that home of what God gave you praise the Lord now notice again in 1st Peter chapter 3 verse 2 while they behold your chase conversation I remember a lost husband or maybe a husband out of fellowship with God but this woman has such power in her but the Holy Ghost that the husband may not hear the word he may not want to actually go to a church and sit down and hear some preacher preach but if there's anything reachable in that man's being do where God can grab a hold of him then it may be through this channel of a godly why does that sound like a powerless individual to you does that sound like an individual to you that ain't got no position in God and those serve while they behold your chaise conversation coupled with fear whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel now notice this this is an important thing of course in that day as it is today and that is the adorning now you will notice of course that Peter directs the adorning toward women and not men now today of course he could do it toward men since we've got men's salons where men are going and getting their fingernails done and their toenails you pervert you don't know which side of the house you belong on men having makeup for men lipstick Rouge oh let me get off that's why I get sick whose adorning now notice this how that Peter do you believe that the early apostolic church believed in holiness what kind of holiness did they believe in God's holiness I'm not interested in man-made holiness no I'm not I'm interested in what God terms as wholeness I notice who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning that we're talking about a godly woman a woman who has power in her life by which she would be able to influence an unconverted man what about a man that is saved and maybe just refilled with the Holy Ghost if a woman a godly woman could have such an impact upon a man that's not even saved what about a woman having an impact upon a husband this may be not worrying needs to be with God but she'll never be it by trying to take his place now you see it seems odd but in the submission of a beloved on its heart I struggle in my husband he does this it does that he does something else sister God God understands how you relate to a man that's not living the right kind of sisters husbands are not serving the Lord they're not Christians and maybe some is not really where they need to be but remember you are the position they hold even if you cannot honor the man that's in the position because of the life that he's living like our president oh god what have we gotten the White House oh my goodness you never know what in the world that man is going to say ever one way gets worse than the last one and you think it can't get no worse but that's what we are friend but to me the leaders in the White House reflect the nation itself why do we have that type of leaders in Congress and mayors and all that because the people themselves are of the same caliber of people that's right no I'm glad you didn't lost evidence the truths anyone now whenever then God empowers not only a man's lie but a woman's lying he gives her the ability by the Spirit of God to find her position and work as well as she can under the condition that are existing in the home even ever had to deal with this of course and other godly sisters don't because her husbands are serving the Lord consecrated to God but they're on the element of women who do I don't in our church but basically everywhere around the world so aren't you glad God gave you a word sisters aren't you glad that God gave you a word something that would help you to know what do I do and then Peter goes not just to the position of the woman and being subjection but he actually comes to the outside and then bounces back to the inside and he identifies her position spiritually by the way she dresses oh my goodness now I realize in the age we're living in focusing the way you dress while you wear your hair is and all that sort of thing it don't have nothing to do with you well they need to read their Bible Dante whose adorning let it not be that of the outward adorning of plaiting the hair wearing a goal or putting on of apparel now the Apostle now refers to this desire which exists in a woman's heart now is that is that wrong no no it's not wrong whenever it is disciplined in the way of the word now it is wrong whenever a woman will desire to dress like the world and look likely to see it you sell woman that smells like a polecat never combs her hair and she thinks she's humble she hopefully she stinks that ain't humility it's ignorance well praise the Lord but Paul our dinner Peter rather identifies this as an adorning an ornament an ornament so it is something that is added to what is already there identified as an ornament or unadorned it it is something to commend them something that will speak of their character so then you take the worldly things of Laodicea and put them on a daughter of God's face or a daughter of God's body the clothes that they would want put them out on the street it is not a commendation to that daughter of God but it is absolutely contrary to their very testimony that she says that she is a daughter of God because it is an ornament all right which is perfectly fitting for a bunch of blond Laodiceans but it's just not fitting to a daughter of God well praise the Lord come on our brothers y'all been waiting for this at least squeak or peep or something so I know you're with me now this desire is lay deep and the nature of most women it's actually in the human nature therefore when it is properly regulated by the Spirit of God it is not necessarily wrong within itself but each one must find that place to where that God helps send that they're not adorning to learn that they look like that you look at a church member and you look at the world and you can't see no difference because they're adornment it's exactly the same and may I say it's the same way for you Mia I've seen a boy yesterday with a pair of breeches on that was so tight the only way I can figure that he got into it his mama must have melted him on top of the stove and apart and poured him down inside them britches at the end part I could figure out how he's gonna get out of him I didn't understand it at all I mean they're so tight down on his leg it look like I've hit a mood he's busted them britches I saw you big praise the Lord God meant for men to dress like men I got men talk like men and smell like a man praise the Lord but yet God does not condemn a true ornament now notice in the way that Peter ties all of this together now people have taken this for years and years and say well you know the Bible says that the Bible speaks against priding of the hair no the Bible does not speak against plaiting the hair well I figured they'd go over about that girl if the Bible speaks against planting of hair the Bible speaks against putting on clothes so we're all sent into not we should strip off planting of the hair wearing of gold or putting on of apparel so if you take Peter now let's take him in the way that you're thinking that he's saying it then it's wrong for us to work clothes we'll go from the skirt church to the streaking church now God actually now listen to me carefully God loves righteous adornment the universe is full of it now think why didn't God if God does not like variety and if God does not like sparkle and Sheen and tinted colors why does not every vegetable exactly the same color why would not they be a dull drab green why are some yellow some orange some of the ones I've seen in the different parts of the world you'd never believe them the exotic fruits and vegetables that hang on a tree and our Father gave them that pigmentation and the outside may be red and the inside be black the outside may be red or the inside be orange and yet you look at the way that God made them what does that do does it change the flavor it does not the pigmentation of the meat on the inside or the pigmentation of the skin on the outside would not vary the tastes on the inside if it went from one end of the spectrum the light spectrum to the other what is it for ornamentation and God loves to ornament and adorn his creation so God is not God is not against ornamentation what God is against is against ornamentation used to use to try to implement what's here on the inside now da are there some things that are wrong with himself absolutely you can't run Mary Kay through sanctification and get her clean no way you can't take lipstick and try to save it and baptize it and give it the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost won't go in lipstick it just won't do it there are some things you just can't save you gotta throw them away but there are some things that aren't necessarily wrong of themselves but it's what the doer will use them for and how it will become wrong because of how much they use it so it's not that it's wrong it's sell in small quantities but it's when they load up like they've been through a dime store with a magnet oh now look at God in the universe of how that he did you know Miguel was driving the other day and I tell you one thing right now I love this time of year with all the flowers and trees don't you everything's so beautiful and we were starving at Virginia and I going up and I took I said look at all these greens going up through the Roanoke Valley and then come up to the Shenandoah Valley you don't come on up through Washington DC and Baltimore going into New Jersey and on and on and on up to New York and it's saying all the different hues of green and you look and there's an oak and it's green but yeah you look at a walnut standing by but Shinra comes out later than the old it'll be another green and there's a pine and there's a Norwegian spruce and there's this and then you look at the grass and you look at all the things that's around and why didn't God make it all say black and white God just make every bit of it black and why why do you do that because that's not the way God does so God wanted to give each its own ornamentation by which it would be on me now you take human beings and look at their now God could have made every one of this if it's so designed with it all look the same no matter who her parents were so it all looked the same so you'd be number eight billion three hundred and forty five thousand but you look like to all previous eight beyond they live before you but yet God didn't make us that way so each of us have our own skin pigmentation and then you take a person whose skin Pig Taoiseach is the color of mine me and Carol hold Hansel art and I'll hold her hand and she'll hold mine and will have her hands one on top of the other and you know we look at one another and I tell her I said you know in reality we're the colored people us white folks oh yeah here I go because we are so many colors and you get one that's a little bit darker and one that's a little bit lighter pink and one that's a little bit more why and you look at us how varied that we are not look at people's eyes and God could have made the eye so they would have been very plain and bland they would have had no sparkle no shimmer no shine to them but God instead of doing that God gave color to the eye so when you would look at somebody in the face that they would either have hazel or brown or blue you know I mean some of the folks I've seen around the worlds and you just get mesmerized by their eyes do you think wow what need eyes they just have the neatest eyes and then God didn't just add the color but God added a sparkle into every human beings are this born proper so God placed it where that it would be there it would be constantly being lost and it would add a little sparkle or a little twinkle now does the twinkle help you see better does it help you rebate er it is ornamentation what does the color do ornamentation what does that what does the different color of your lips being a different color from your your nose or your forehead now why did God do that ornamentation of your face so why did God make us and whenever something would be said or something like that that we would brush oh I did God make it to where it was this part of your head they were blessed and sit at the back nobody would have seen it so God allowed the capillaries to gather in a more condensed form right here in the front part of your face so that whenever but do that and then that rosy colored part inside of our cheeks what's it for so make you smarter doesn't makes you a more intelligent person because you've got more natural roses in your cheeks and someone else ornamentation so God places it inside of his creation God did the animal kingdom the Botany kingdom the flowers the trees God made every one of them in the same order so the heaven ornamentation so does God get mad at human beings when they try to embellish who and what they are well that depends on what they're embellishing with praise the Lord if I didn't know better I think some of y'all got a makeup problem you're getting cried on man now I would expect this if I was preaching down the road or over there over here but now the human complexion is an ornamentation of the creator himself we know that and God actually crowns that by the nature it is an ornament of nature that God gives to every one of us so it is not to make them more beneficial it's not to make them more useful but it is actually an ornamentation that is added to the looks you could see without the color of your eyes you can talk if your lips this is pale his brother Charlie's pants there you could still talk perfectly fine of course unless your hemoglobin so low that you can't even you know early breathe but as far as what's most of that added to us for because God wanted us each of us type and ornamentation and yet Peter is not speaking about that but he's speaking about and mainly with women that would fight the Battle of them trying to take on a worldly additive that would be added to what they are now what is the sparkle in your eye it is a super added ornamentation by the hand of God that makes a brighter luster in your appearance what is the shaded on your lips or the the pigmentation of your skin what is that does it make it any better it is a super added ornamentation given by the hand of God does it make you function better absolutely not take it out you'd function just as well without it but it is an ornament ation by God to the animals to these to the Stars who all this everywhere you look around and you will see that so God Himself it's not against that one it is used the right way but Satan found out that the desire special in the women is there for them to add ornamentation so he'll try to get them to add something that's a little bit questionable or something that they know is just find out wrong but they think it adds to who they are and it makes them more attractive or makes them more appealing well I guess that depends on who you're trying to appeal to well hallelujah now the appearance of course is a very important thing we knows that it is to God whenever we get to heaven it ain't going to look like the Bronx it ain't gonna look like you know some place in Philadelphia where you wouldn't want even want to take an armored car it ain't gonna look like that I mean it's gonna have quite an appearance you believe that streets of gold gates of pearl walls of Jasper I mean so what you want that's a pretty impressive palace but yet what Peter is now emphasizing and Paul did exactly the same thing that the ornamentation should be accompanied what's on the outside should testify from the inward virtue and character that's on the inside what's his got to do the subjection well a woman might be subject to her husband that you know the husband's headship as we call it and she never buffs against him and does this and not in the other but yet her ornamentation is pried her ornamentation is excessive jewelry her ornamentation is constantly drunk on clothes oh my goodness and she iced out the latest fashion and the this and that and the other and if a sister in church walks into the same dress she got on from TJ Maxx she'll never wear it again now that's the vanity of a woman a man looks and says good not you got all my shirt what where are you doing wiring Marshall a woman blushes a woman oh my god had been heard and walked I think I'll go home I won't be able to get a fan out of a service don't sit and look at me like I don't know how women think sisters I'm married to one I've got two daughters and a whole bunch of grand young uns it's all women now Peter says let it not be in the outward adorning let this not be the main or principle saying that your heart is set on not notice Peter does not say that the woman should never comb her hair that she should never clean herself up even make herself presentable for her husband praise God I used to know a woman down in Kentucky I won't call her a name list some of her family was to hear me but it didn't make no difference what time of the day or what day of the week you went to her house he's always going to find her and the same attire and it was actually gonna be the same one her housecoat and her house shoes I believe that thing was so nasty she could stand it up in the corner and it's standing salute praise the Lord now you imagine what this does for a woman raising girls or boys the home you're raised in has a great deal to do with the kind of man you choose or kind of woman you choose now for many they think it's humble if a woman don't call my hair and don't use deodorant and don't spiff up a little bit it ain't a spiffing that gets you in trouble it's what you sniff with neglecting personal appearance is not humility it's misunderstanding God now you don't have to go you know and buy the very best of this and that and the other but you can't wash what you were now I'm gonna tell you some whiz raise poor my daddy never had a great paying job so is raised poor I wore blue jeans to school with holes in them but at the time I was wearing them they wasn't in style you got me now they take them out on a dirt Benten somebody stands out there and this is their occupation they stand out over the shotgun and blow holes in them blue jeans and sell them for 125 dollars a pair and I felt embarrassed but the same every day I went to school were and man I do wear tennis shoes that was not in rke they were dollar store specials now today they're cool to wear them but I was lying them when they wasn't cool so everybody that looked at me laughed at me I very few friends in school because we're so poor so the rich boys would always come around me and ridicule me and make fun of me my clothes wasn't fancy but my mama kept them clean praise the Lord our bathtub was not six-foot long covered in fiberglass it was galvanized and a circular form and y'all know what I'm talking about few of the older folks do that was our bathtub we didn't have running water we had a sister I was the oldest so I got mine first so I got the clean water and that got home from Harry on down God have mercy no telling what they got but my momma never let us being poor convince her we had to smell like a bunch of polecats going to school pray so long well hallelujah did the odorant department in Walgreen will be sold out by midnight you see friends for those who feel like for a man to comb his hair oh brother Donnie's got so much brat just have everyday brush my teeth multiple times take a shower use deodorant oh I'm gonna smell like a racehorse and I get done preaching but now I'm gonna smell nice when I come out praise the Lord oh is it God made the children of Israel wash themselves and washed their clothes before they even come to the mountain where he was that's our God well praise the Lord now is that wrong nope that ain't wrong within itself now you know God God has an order zone now what's the way Peter lays this out we'll find a place to enclosure shortly whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of the planting the hair and wearing of gold or of put him on apparel so if you're gonna preach against planting on her hair you gotta preach against wearing clothes notice this John Gill said of planning the hair folding it up in curls now for those of you who feel like holiness is just a modern-day invention of william branham john gill lived in the 1600s folding it up putting it in curls tying it up in knots putting it into the form of horns and towers horns would be very fitting probably for some oh hey man putting into the form of horns and towers made by their crisping pins with their coals and round tires like the moon as with the custom of those times and still is now there were women among the Jews whose occupation was to plant women's hair in great extensive ways actually the woman Mary Magdalene this was her occupation not just where she lived Magdalene is a hair platter no wonder she had Seven Devils now think of it she would have been a modern fashion woman in a salon or a spa or whatever in that day beautifying women now not an adornment by which a woman would make her hair pretty but constantly trying to outdo their neighbor let's stand let me read you this the women in Eastern country says dr. Shah travels page 294 effect to have their hair hang down to the ground which they collect in one lock up on the Honda part of the head binding and fighting it about with ribbons above this or on top of their heads persons of better fashion wear a flexible plates of gold or silver variously cut through and engraved in imitation of lace now you imagine they would have these gold and silver strips that would be cut through to look like lace and that take their hair which would lay down on the ground and they'd we've all this stuff through their hair and wear it up like a pentecostal do now was the long hair wrong no but the way they were doing it was an adornment which was wrong and you know what happened in the first church age them some of them grill old fashioned Pentecostal first church women started doing some of the same things so the rich message folks started taking gold and platinum into theirs and silver and Peter and Paul both had to strike again sadness and no sisters don't do that the people look at you and you look just like the world sure fix your hair pulled it up comb and let it grow out we're at wrong but don't do what they're doing don't look like them because they they're competing one against another one against another and this ins hairdo cost so much and this one's called summer I've got five thousand dollars worth of gold in my head you better be careful walking and Lizabeth and Walmart with that you'll come out without a head what was it competition oh my goodness the illusion here see the excessive care which will then prevail and especially to their setting the heart on such ornaments rather than on the adorning which is internal thin plates of gold were often mixed with the hair to make it appear more ornamental by the reflection of light now can you imagine what these women must have look like in that day here they got all this gold and silver and all this metal in their hair out on the Mediterranean Sun there were no clouds and stuff like we note here good night it must have been something like a runway in Atlanta you come this woman and here was another man that was another and that was another you get him hardly look at him what was it all for pride ornamentation and some of the sisters start doing the same thing well praise God more little foxes I guess small golden buckles were also used in different parts and among the Roman ladies pearls and precious stones of different colors there is a remarkable passage in park conjugal ah precept Plutarch was a first century scholar and philosopher and ornament as kratie said which was also a poet is that which adorns the proper ornament of a woman as that which becomes her best there is neither gold nor pearls nor scarlet but those things which are an evident proof of gravity regularity and modesty it got so vain by the gym that the poet started reading now this guy wasn't a preacher he wasn't Paul or Peter but from the social circles of poetry they started rebuking it themselves praise the Lord don't you love him you appreciate the tres it's about hits together Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your mercy we thank you Lord Jesus that you would share such things with us I realize the majority of Laodiceans would laugh and ridicule and make fun of this from probably than from the very five minutes from after reading my scripture from our opening comments to the very end they would think what an ignoramus it's that man a complete idiot an imbecile yes mother standards I would be but we believe Lord God that this Bible still carries through to the rapture we don't think it's outdated we don't think it needs to be updated we think it needs to be made flesh and our hearts for both men and women boys and girls I pray you'd help each of us father maybe we have some here tonight Lord that's single we know we do some that's divorced something that the companion is going on before them but each of us father can take that which we've heard tonight let it be applied to our life in the area Lord that we need it father God we desire to meet you that day and you'll be able to look at us and there'll be nothing on our record that'll
