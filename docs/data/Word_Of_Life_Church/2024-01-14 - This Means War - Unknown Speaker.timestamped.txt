[31:48] seated thank you buddy appreciate it
[31:51] well praise the Lord praise the
[31:54] Lord now we understand by our scripture
[31:57] readings in verse 17 and verse 18 that
[32:01] Abraham is the father of the faithful
[32:04] and we are hirs to the promise through
[32:08] Christ now Abraham was just an ordinary
[32:11] Man actually one time Abraham was an
[32:14] idol worshipper right sir but what does
[32:17] that tell us about God it tells us that
[32:20] we serve a God who has
[32:22] transforming power now transforming
[32:25] means it is the ability to bring about a
[32:28] dramatic change and we serve a god this
[32:31] morning with transforming power he can
[32:35] transform a drunk and make a preacher
[32:36] out of him he can transform a street
[32:38] Harlot and make her a lady he can
[32:40] transform bitter water and make it sweet
[32:42] amen he could transform a sinner to a
[32:44] saint he can transform the world when it
[32:47] was dark and void and without form and
[32:49] make a garden of Eden out of it how by
[32:51] the transforming power of the almighty
[32:54] God the prophet said that's the
[32:56] transforming power of God that he can
[32:58] take something that's nothing and make
[33:01] something wonderful out of it God's
[33:03] transforming power they ain't got no
[33:06] mouth they ain't got no vocal cords and
[33:09] yet he said if these hold their peace
[33:11] these rocks will cry out how can the
[33:14] rocks cry out but you've got to remember
[33:17] that God is the creator of the
[33:20] rocks and when you have the power to
[33:22] create you can make your creation do
[33:25] what you want it to do amen
[33:27] oh Hallelujah and God by his
[33:29] transforming power is going to take
[33:31] these old frail bellies of ours one day
[33:34] and transform into young men and women
[33:36] again and you young people sitting here
[33:38] you will not be cheated but God by his
[33:41] transforming power is going to transfer
[33:43] you from youth to Eternal
[33:45] youth Oh Glory to God that's the power
[33:49] of my God this
[33:50] morning amen and we understand by the
[33:53] Bible that Abraham wasn't looking for
[33:56] God yes sir but God came looking for
[34:00] Abraham and as Abraham seed we can sit
[34:03] here this morning and say the same thing
[34:06] when Adam the first son was lost who
[34:09] come looking for
[34:11] Adam who come looking for him God did
[34:15] then who comes looking for every lost
[34:18] son God does you see I never sought God
[34:21] but it was always God seeking me it was
[34:24] always God seeking you because God by
[34:27] his for knowledge knew that Abraham
[34:29] would believe him when he spoke so God
[34:31] sought out Abraham because he knew he
[34:33] would believe him and God salts you
[34:37] out God had a purpose the prophet said
[34:40] that he hid it from The Eyes Of The
[34:42] Prudent and the wise and revealed it to
[34:44] predestinated babes who are
[34:47] predestinated to receive
[34:50] it do you hear that this morning why am
[34:53] you setting in this building today why
[34:55] are you believing this message today why
[34:57] did Brother Joel sing what he sung today
[34:59] because God predestinated you to receive
[35:02] this
[35:03] message and as they come looking for
[35:06] Rahab God come looking for you
[35:08] amen God said because you have obeyed my
[35:12] voice amen let that be said of us let us
[35:16] be like Abraham that we never doubt God
[35:19] when he
[35:21] speaks amen he said because you've
[35:23] obeyed my voice I by myself have sworn
[35:27] because there's none greater to swear
[35:30] by amen when God made promise to Abraham
[35:33] because he could swear by none greater
[35:35] he swore by himself saying thy seed
[35:38] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[35:40] not maybe not hope so not could be but
[35:42] shall and shall in the Bible is used it
[35:45] indicates a commandment or an
[35:48] obligation this shall it's an obligation
[35:51] it's a commandment you know like let
[35:53] there be light it's a
[35:55] commandment
[35:57] Hallelujah repent be baptized in the
[35:59] name of Jesus Christ and you shall it's
[36:01] a commandment you shall receive the gift
[36:04] of the Holy Ghost oh glory be to God
[36:08] when you obey God's word you get God's
[36:12] results amen amen I like this the
[36:15] prophet said Abraham was aired to All by
[36:18] the promise so he could lay claim to
[36:21] everything that was in the land and the
[36:24] land itself Abraham been given the
[36:27] promise now we understand Abraham was
[36:29] the poorest man in all the country
[36:31] because he lived out in the desert and
[36:32] he lived in peace with God and lot was
[36:35] rich and lived in the city and become
[36:36] the governor of the city he sat in the
[36:38] gate he was a judge and judged the city
[36:40] he had all the riches and all things but
[36:44] Abraham was in the desert and perhaps
[36:45] the poorest man in the land yet he
[36:49] claimed to possess it
[36:53] all oh my you may not be be rich in the
[36:57] world's Goods but we possess all things
[37:00] the church itself possesses all
[37:05] things amen say that with me the church
[37:09] possesses all
[37:12] things the church possesses all things
[37:16] hallelujah oh God let that sink into our
[37:19] souls this morning that's more than just
[37:21] a quote that's a reality of what God has
[37:24] promised us the church my church my body
[37:27] is a possessor of all
[37:29] things oh my oh my the prophet said what
[37:33] can I do what can I say I say this my
[37:35] friend to every one of you every one of

[38:06] it maybe if you believe it you might
[38:09] start feeling it all
[38:12] right
[38:14] hallelujah amen every person in here was
[38:17] healed when Jesus died at Calvary then I
[38:19] say it's time we
[38:22] profess what we
[38:24] possess we're all the time talking down
[38:27] and blue and negative and this and that
[38:29] oh my but if we could change our
[38:30] language the Bible said out of your own
[38:33] mouth you'll be justified and out of
[38:34] your own mouth you'll be condemned
[38:36] you'll find out one day your greatest
[38:38] enemy is
[38:40] yourself oh but let this New Year let it
[38:43] be a new language Let It Be a new talk
[38:45] let it be a new profession I am an
[38:48] overcomer I am victorious I am a Son of
[38:51] God I am the Bride of Jesus Christ I am
[38:54] going in a Rapture how my daddy said
[38:59] so

[39:38] cross and gave his life that you might
[39:42] have the legal rights to every
[39:45] Redemptive blessing he died for it's
[39:48] yours you're just afraid to possess it
[39:51] profess what we
[39:55] possess amen
[39:57] hallelujah it's time that we realize who
[40:00] we are and what's been given to
[40:04] us amen I wonder sometimes if we're not
[40:08] poor because we choose to
[40:10] be yes come on well
[40:13] Glory one day the Gentile Kings declared
[40:16] war and they went and took lock
[40:19] Abraham's nephew took him and Lot's wife
[40:21] and children took him down into the
[40:22] country and the Bible says in Genesis 14
[40:24] that when Abraham heard that his brother
[40:26] was taken captive and the prophet said
[40:28] brother I like that his brother said
[40:31] look at what lot had done to him but yet
[40:34] there was some kind of a tie that binds
[40:36] and no matter what he had done to him he
[40:37] was still a brother oh God let us grow
[40:41] up that no matter what someone does to
[40:44] us if they draw us out no matter what he
[40:46] had done to him he was still his brother
[40:48] and when he got into trouble Abraham
[40:50] reacted Abraham went to get
[40:52] him there was something that tied them
[40:55] together look we not agree on everything
[40:57] if we talk long enough I'm sure we won't
[40:59] but that don't mean we're not
[41:01] brothers let's just love one another God
[41:04] will work it
[41:06] out amen it's like gono when he was on
[41:09] the train and one of the one of the the
[41:12] the scouts who had went out and track
[41:13] Jon on them down and brought them in and
[41:16] they placed them all under arrest that's
[41:18] the way the government does you they
[41:20] placed all of them under arrest even the
[41:22] ones that we found jono put them all on
[41:25] the same train s them down down here to
[41:27] Florida and on the train one of his
[41:30] Warriors it's in jono's autobiography
[41:32] You' never choose to read it and one of
[41:34] them spoke up to one of jono's warrior
[41:36] one of dro Warriors spoke up to one of
[41:37] these guys who tracked them down he said
[41:40] I hate you as long as there's breath in
[41:43] my body I'll hate you so why didn't you
[41:45] leave us alone we were serving the
[41:47] Creator God gave us this land we was
[41:49] living the way he made us why did you
[41:52] track us down I'll hate you as long as
[41:55] there's bre I hate you and they said j a
[41:58] few of us left to hate one
[42:00] another we are the minority in this
[42:03] world come on somebody the world hates
[42:06] us but let us unite oursel together in
[42:09] the bonds of
[42:11] love we are brothers in the cross
[42:14] Hallelujah when AB heard his brother was
[42:16] in trouble taking captive they weren
[42:18] Warriors they didn't know Kung Fu they
[42:21] didn't no Battle Tactics
[42:24] 318 farmers went down after these
[42:29] Kings who had lot in his family
[42:33] 318 Farmers against these Kings and
[42:36] their
[42:41] armies why would a bunch of farmers
[42:44] being led by Abraham go up against a
[42:47] bunch of Kings with all their
[42:51] armies what made Abraham so sure that he
[42:55] could win this this
[42:58] battle I'm not talking about he took he
[43:01] didn't take special forces he didn't
[43:03] take Navy Seals he got a man out of the
[43:08] Wheatfield but why was he so sure that
[43:10] he could
[43:12] win God because Abraham had a
[43:16] revelation that God had given him the
[43:18] land and all that was in it and he acted
[43:20] on his belief that what God he acted on
[43:23] the world he was a possessor of the Gate
[43:25] of his enemies because God said so he
[43:28] wasn't relying upon the 318 Farmers he
[43:31] wasn't relying upon the pitchforks he
[43:33] was trusting in The God Who made the
[43:35] promise and let me say this morning I'm
[43:37] not relying upon my ability I'm not
[43:39] relying upon my education but I'm
[43:41] relying upon the God who made the
[43:43] promise
[43:45] amen
[43:47] hallelujah I'm not trusting in my
[43:49] ability I'm trusting in my God who
[43:52] cannot fail and Abraham went after his
[43:54] nephew and he went after what belonged
[43:57] to him because he was a possessor of all
[44:02] that was in the
[44:04] land what a
[44:06] revelation remember him said Abraham had
[44:08] a right to the promise and the promise
[44:11] was his and you have a right to the
[44:14] promise and the promise is
[44:17] yours yet he had to fight to possess it
[44:21] there's where the rub comes in it's easy
[44:24] to say I believe it but it's something
[44:26] else to put legs on your
[44:30] belief amen cuz remember the devil
[44:33] believes and trembles he ain't going
[44:35] nowhere come on
[44:38] somebody he had to fight to possess it
[44:42] the prophet said there you are the
[44:44] believer
[44:45] today uh that be us the believer today
[44:49] yet we're air to all
[44:51] things we're air to every spiritual
[44:55] every physical blessing every blessing
[44:59] the bible promises yet you have to fight
[45:02] for every inch of
[45:05] it amen that's the way God he's got it
[45:09] set up it's always been that way you
[45:11] have to fight to possess what you know
[45:14] is your own you have to fight to possess
[45:17] it and that's what you've got to do now
[45:20] and I say God give us strength to fight
[45:23] to possess what we already own
[45:26] am let the fight start let the fight
[45:29] start by professing what the word says
[45:32] is ours am every fight has to start
[45:35] somewhere then let it start with this by
[45:38] standing up and professing what the word
[45:40] says I
[45:43] am amen
[45:46] hallelujah amen Abraham returned from
[45:48] the slaughter of the Kings and the king
[45:51] of Sodom told him to take the
[45:54] SPs and Abraham said yet I'll not take a
[45:56] thread to a Sho latch the prophet said
[45:59] he didn't fight the war to make a lot of
[46:02] money and real true battles are not made
[46:05] with selfish motives Wars are not
[46:08] thought for money Wars are thought for
[46:10] motives and for principles men fight War
[46:13] for principles and when Abraham went out
[46:15] to get lost he didn't go out there
[46:17] because he knew he could whip the Kings
[46:19] and take their possessions that's not
[46:21] why he went out there because he knew he
[46:23] could whoop them and take what was
[46:24] theirs but he went out there for this
[46:26] principle to save his Fallen
[46:30] brother he went out there with the
[46:32] motive I've got to save my
[46:36] brother Hallelujah and any Minister that
[46:39] sent out the inspiration of the king of
[46:42] heaven will not go for
[46:44] money neither will he go to make big
[46:46] churches neither will he go to inspire
[46:48] denominations he'll go for one principle
[46:51] and that is to bring back his Fallen
[46:54] brother and I come to this service this
[46:56] morning with this principle to war with
[46:58] the devil not to get a name not for
[47:00] popularity but to get my Fallen brother
[47:04] the one Satan that has tied down and say
[47:06] Satan loose him and let him
[47:09] go that young person that the Devils
[47:12] tormented their mind to loose them from
[47:14] that battle to go get our young to get
[47:16] our old to get our fathers to get our
[47:20] mothers Hallelujah to fight for what's
[47:23] ours to stand for what's right let the
[47:26] world laugh at us you think I'm really
[47:28] concerned to what they think about me
[47:29] when their hair's 15 different colors
[47:31] and they can't even go out in the
[47:33] thunderstorm because of the metal
[47:34] they've got in their
[47:36] head come on
[47:38] somebody wor what the world thinks about
[47:41] us I Ain care what they think about me
[47:43] what does God say about
[47:47] us
[47:53] hallelujah this thought I was getting
[47:54] old I feel real good good right
[47:57] there Solomon said there's a Time For
[47:59] Peace and there's a time for war there's
[48:03] nothing wrong with fighting amen if
[48:06] you're fighting for the right principle
[48:09] yes sir I preached one time on jono the
[48:11] heart of a warrior and somebody come to
[48:13] me and said I didn't think Christians
[48:14] were supposed to
[48:20] fight I said well maybe you're not
[48:23] but I'm going to fight for what's mine
[48:28] amen there's nothing wrong with fighting
[48:30] if you're fighting for the right
[48:32] principle BR Bri said I was reading at
[48:34] Tombstone the other day in the museum
[48:36] and I saw a picture of
[48:39] gono said many of you might think that
[48:41] jono was a
[48:43] renegade but to me he was a genuine
[48:47] American he was only fighting for that
[48:50] which was right that God had given him a
[48:53] land and a nation and a place to live he
[48:56] wasn't fighting for a name he wasn't
[48:58] fighting for popularity he was fighting
[49:00] for what God gave
[49:02] him he said when those white soldiers
[49:04] come in there and by force taking over
[49:06] the land killing them out like a bunch
[49:08] of flies so there was the original
[49:10] picture of donos medical headquarters or
[49:12] his Hospital said it was two or three
[49:14] blankets over a piece of
[49:16] mosquite and them wounded real genuine
[49:19] American Indians fighting for their
[49:22] god-given rights and there jono with the
[49:25] baby of his own on his hip standing
[49:27] there looking upon his own Warriors
[49:28] bleeding and dying with no penicillin or
[49:31] nothing no way to help them genuine
[49:34] god-given American that's right then you
[49:37] call him a renegade he said I call him a
[49:39] gentleman fighting for something that
[49:42] God gave him a land and a nation and a
[49:45] place to live and let me say this
[49:47] morning we're not warn for selfish
[49:49] motives but Satan has took some of our
[49:51] possession and it's time for the Seed of
[49:53] Abraham to rise up and get back what
[49:57] belongs to us declare war on hell and
[50:00] its demons well the devil's been after

[50:21] fight will

[50:26] Indian lost this land because they were
[50:30] divided among
[50:33] themselves Satan's tactic is always to
[50:37] divide and conquer that's what he's

[59:18] of the lon's mouth it couldn't even eat
[59:20] him Samson one time was
[59:23] caught and a bunch of people had him fed
[59:27] in and what did he do he went out there
[59:29] and picked the gates of the city
[59:32] up I think they weighed a ton and a half
[59:35] a
[59:36] piece my God that would have tore the
[59:39] senine plum loose from the muscle
[59:41] there's no way natural muscle could have
[59:43] ever picked that much
[59:45] up he would have ripped his muscle I've
[59:47] seen people do it in surgery come in
[59:49] picking up a tu before they tear their
[59:50] tend and they have to have surgery to
[59:52] repair it and here's a man picked up
[59:54] each gate three tons of 12 on the hill
[59:56] and shut them down said you boys want
[59:59] your Gates come up here and get them
[1:00:02] well that's what you need the devil you
[1:00:03] need to rip up his gate say boy you want

[1:00:16] do that the prophet said he was a
[1:00:18] the prophet said he was a mama's boy one
[1:00:21] place he called him a
[1:00:22] shrimp how could he do knew it because
[1:00:26] he had a
[1:00:27] covenant he had a covenant with his God
[1:00:31] amen amen as I've said before God don't
[1:00:34] need something big he just needs
[1:00:36] something
[1:00:38] yielded well when I get big I'll do
[1:00:40] something for God you can do it now if
[1:00:42] you'll just yield to
[1:00:43] him amen certainly all these died fine
[1:00:48] Warriors of the faith they all
[1:00:50] died every one of
[1:00:52] them the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:00:56] possessing the Gate of the enemy God
[1:00:58] keeping his promise but I'm thinking of
[1:01:00] another
[1:01:02] seed one Jesus Christ The Royal Seed of
[1:01:07] Abraham and what did this seed do he
[1:01:09] took all the gates of the enemy he took
[1:01:12] the gates of sickness it could not exist
[1:01:15] in his presence neither could anything
[1:01:17] else exist in his presence a funeral
[1:01:19] possession could not stand in his
[1:01:21] presence what did he do Joshua died
[1:01:23] Moses died all the rest of them died but
[1:01:25] not this Royal seed death could not
[1:01:28] stand where life
[1:01:30] was the woman the widow woman whose son
[1:01:33] was dead he stopped the funeral
[1:01:34] possession raised the boy from dead he
[1:01:36] gave gyrus his daughter back to him
[1:01:38] Lazareth was dead four days his nose
[1:01:40] done caved in but he said Lazarus come
[1:01:44] forth what did he do he broke the seals
[1:01:47] of everything his precious Soul
[1:01:49] descended into hell where I ought to
[1:01:51] have went but on that third day Samson
[1:01:53] take the gat in the city on his back had
[1:01:55] nothing to do with this he took the
[1:01:57] Gates of Hell the gates of the grave and
[1:01:59] everything else he didn't pack it up on
[1:02:00] a mountain but he destroyed
[1:02:02] it Hallelujah he possessed the Gate of
[1:02:06] the
[1:02:07] enemy the atmospheres that were filled
[1:02:10] with Devil's powers above the Angels or
[1:02:12] nothing else could come down there could
[1:02:13] be no intercession because the blood of
[1:02:15] goats could not take away sin but his
[1:02:17] own blood took away the sin and he
[1:02:19] ascended on high LED captive captive and
[1:02:22] gave gifts unto men now everyone of
[1:02:25] Abraham's seed everyone of Abraham's
[1:02:30] seed everyone of Abraham's seed that's
[1:02:33] willing to pay the price to come down to
[1:02:36] repent of their sins be baptized in the
[1:02:38] name of Jesus Christ receive the Holy
[1:02:41] Ghost and stand the test Seed of Abraham
[1:02:46] and when he come he possessed every gate
[1:02:49] the Gate of sickness the Gate of death
[1:02:51] the Gate of Hell the Gate of Temptation
[1:02:52] the Gate of the Grave he possessed every
[1:02:55] gate and freely gives it to us and makes
[1:03:00] us more than conquerors through him that
[1:03:04] loved us and gave himself for
[1:03:09] us he ha made us more than
[1:03:15] conquerors This Means War This Means War
