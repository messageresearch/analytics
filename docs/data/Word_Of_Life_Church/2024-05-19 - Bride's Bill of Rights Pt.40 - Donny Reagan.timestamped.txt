[32:31] course everyone is welcome and looking
[32:33] forward to a great time in the Lord June
[32:37] the 1st Saturday night 6:
[32:40] p.m. Romans chapter 7 verse
[32:46] one know you not brethren for I speak to
[32:49] them that know the
[32:51] law how that the law hath dominion over
[32:54] a
[32:55] man as long as he liveth I watch you
[32:58] changes from verse one to verse Two for
[33:01] the woman which hath an
[33:04] husband is bound by the law to her
[33:08] husband now we're not talking about the
[33:10] Mosaic law but the law of her
[33:13] husband the woman which has an husband
[33:17] is bound by the law to her husband so
[33:20] long as he
[33:24] liveth but if the husband be
[33:26] dead she is loosed from the law of her
[33:32] husband so then if while her husband
[33:34] liveth she be married to another man she
[33:37] shall be called an
[33:41] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[33:43] she's free from that
[33:46] law so that she is no adulteress though
[33:49] she be
[33:50] married to another
[33:53] man wherefore my brethren ye also are be
[33:57] come dead to the
[34:00] law by the body of Christ that you
[34:03] should be
[34:04] married to
[34:07] another even to
[34:10] him who is raised from the dead so by
[34:14] the body of
[34:16] Christ we are married to another even to
[34:19] him who is raised from the dead that we
[34:22] should bring forth
[34:23] fruit unto
[34:26] God how many you'd like to be we
[34:27] remember today as we as we pray got some
[34:31] prayer claws here today and also a tie
[34:35] that a brother wants me to pray over and
[34:37] um if you have a need you just hold it
[34:39] there in your heart as we approach the
[34:42] lord lord
[34:44] Jesus our beloved
[34:50] husband how we love you
[34:53] today we are so thankful that you took
[34:56] drunks
[34:58] Liars
[35:01] whoremongers some were religious some
[35:04] were filled with all kinds of unbelief
[35:06] and
[35:09] sin and because of what you did for us
[35:13] we were loosed from the law of our first
[35:17] husband and because of you we have been
[35:21] remarried we are grateful
[35:24] today Lord Jesus we're asking you that
[35:26] you'd be
[35:28] mindful of us as we look into your word
[35:31] help me today father that I can get out
[35:33] of the
[35:34] way take my human instrumentality father
[35:37] and move it aside and use that portion
[35:40] of yourself which is a gift in a man's
[35:43] life anoint that Lord you saw the needs
[35:46] of the people signified by the uplifting
[35:49] of a hand these prayer re calls Lord
[35:51] Jesus that I have here these requests
[35:53] pray that you'd be mindful of them Lord
[35:56] help me father that I I can be able to
[35:58] submit myself to you shut my mouth to
[36:01] anything that would be displeasing to
[36:03] you may we hear from heaven today as
[36:06] we've gathered together here in the
[36:08] house of God in the name of Jesus Christ
[36:11] we pray amen God bless you you may be
[36:24] seated truly what a wonderful thing that
[36:27] Mary
[36:29] is if it's carried out according to
[36:32] God's provision and his
[36:34] word the oldest institution in the
[36:38] world God himself was the first one to
[36:41] perform it of course in the Garden of
[36:44] Eden a me for it to be sacred and to
[36:47] Believers it still is Satan has
[36:50] certainly
[36:51] made a sham out of a lot of it and all
[36:55] that people are doing with marriage
[36:57] today but it doesn't take away the
[37:00] sacredness from us as children of
[37:03] God whenever brother brandham was here
[37:07] and he was supposed to been on a hunting
[37:10] trip in
[37:11] 1965
[37:13] November brother Jack Moore called him
[37:17] and wanted him to come and hold some
[37:20] series of meetings for him in spport
[37:24] Louisiana so when brother brandham
[37:27] preaches is the first night of that
[37:30] service he that series of services he
[37:34] preaches this sermon called The
[37:36] Invisible Union of the bride of
[37:39] Christ and he reads the scripture that
[37:42] we just read here in
[37:43] Romans 7 verse 1 now he says that this
[37:48] scripture is very seldom preached on he
[37:51] said because it uh pertained to marriage
[37:55] and divorce
[37:57] and that a lot of people basically just
[38:01] stayed away from it because marriage and
[38:03] divorce is such a controversial subject
[38:06] but unlike myself and unlike other
[38:10] ministers in the five-fold ministry a
[38:13] prophet has an Insight that someone like
[38:16] me just does not have I'm not called to
[38:19] have it nor is any other aspect of the
[38:21] ministry because a prophet is a
[38:24] sear so when he reads this and he made
[38:28] this statement in paragraph 35 Paul here
[38:32] is giving an illustration in our
[38:34] scripture about the law and Grace an
[38:38] illustrating it like marriage and
[38:41] divorce this passage is very
[38:44] seldom preached on because it's more or
[38:47] less pertains to like marriage and
[38:51] divorce but this is what stuck out to me
[38:53] whenever I heard this but it also
[38:56] pertains to a
[38:58] greater
[39:00] portion of marriage and divorce so it
[39:03] doesn't just pertain then to a man and a
[39:05] woman but it also pertains to a greater
[39:08] portion of marriage and divorce how that
[39:12] he's trying to set in order that we as a
[39:16] church now I believe also it's to my
[39:20] belief that it unfolds one of the great
[39:24] mysteries of Prophecy so there's a
[39:27] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[39:29] in Romans 7 and then also in Romans 7
[39:33] there is a great mystery of
[39:38] Prophecy again a prophet having the
[39:41] ability to look into the word u unlike
[39:44] myself and other ministers that love God
[39:46] with all of our hearts but we're just
[39:48] not given that ability to do it so
[39:50] Prophet would be able to look at it and
[39:52] see things in there and rightly divide
[39:56] that word and to be able to place it in
[39:59] such a way that be more enlightening for
[40:02] us to see so he saw in this now I find
[40:06] this amazing because as many times as
[40:08] brother brandham dealt with marriage and
[40:09] divorce down through the years this
[40:11] sermon right here things that he says
[40:14] inside of this sermon was never said
[40:17] before or after this sermon and yet he
[40:21] was supposed to have been on a hunting
[40:25] trip boy am I so glad he didn't
[40:28] go now it shows you how God orchestrates
[40:31] things now he said he was standing with
[40:34] a pair of white trousers on in Indian
[40:37] moccasins whenever brother Jack Moore
[40:40] calls him and he schedules this meeting
[40:43] and it must have been so
[40:46] profound in Heaven's Divine
[40:50] orchestration that these things be said
[40:53] because if you haven't listened to it in
[40:55] a while do you good to listen to it but
[40:56] there's so many things that are made
[41:00] clear that the message thus far up to
[41:03] this time now remember this is 11
[41:06] 2565 and he's going to be gone a little
[41:08] over a month from that time so it would
[41:10] have never been said but God divinely
[41:14] orchestrated this because it had to be
[41:16] uttered as a prophetic utterance so what
[41:20] I want to do by the help of the Lord
[41:21] today let us start out by looking at our
[41:25] first Union so if it pertains seem to a
[41:28] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[41:30] now I'm not here today to preach about
[41:32] your marriages and you you should have
[41:34] done this and shouldn't have done that
[41:35] but what I am here today to preach about
[41:38] is the marriage that each one of us had
[41:42] which was wrong that is the marriage to
[41:46] our natural
[41:48] nature and your first husband that had
[41:51] the rule over you was your nature amen
[41:56] so you were were joined into that nature
[42:00] by an act between a man and a woman your
[42:03] mother and father and that set you in
[42:06] line then for this shotgun wedding if
[42:10] you wish to call it that so then we were
[42:13] forced into this Union which was a
[42:17] perverted union now watch he said our
[42:20] natural life here that we have is just a
[42:22] perversion it really should have been
[42:25] the right life to begin with but it's
[42:26] per
[42:27] converted how by the natural birth the
[42:31] first life or your first Union you were
[42:36] joined at Birth by Nature a natural act
[42:42] you were joined to it by Nature at your
[42:45] birth by a natural act a natural human
[42:49] being associated man and woman together
[42:51] Associated together in sexual Affair
[42:54] which brought your first life here
[42:57] that's associated with sin and
[43:01] death how can you miss seeing the
[43:04] serpent
[43:06] see now watch it goes on to say in
[43:08] paragraph 212 now it was nature
[43:11] associated with death your first husband
[43:16] that had the rule over you was your
[43:21] Nature by natural birth so then when we
[43:25] were born we did not express it probably
[43:29] most of us what was going to be there
[43:31] for maybe many years some of you might
[43:34] have start expressing a little bit of it
[43:35] when you were smaller if you had a
[43:37] strong dominating nature about you but
[43:40] maybe for a lot of us it might have been
[43:43] several years before we started
[43:45] displaying that deceitful conniving type
[43:49] of nature or lying or temper or whatever
[43:53] it was but it began to come out the
[43:57] older that we got and our mother and
[44:00] father might watch us and look at us and
[44:03] think where did they get that at they
[44:05] didn't get that from me they didn't get
[44:07] that from you where did they get that at
[44:09] now they're trying to understand it and
[44:12] you yourself of course didn't know
[44:14] because it was natural for you to act
[44:17] that way so if you were shy timid and
[44:21] quiet you don't have to put that on
[44:23] that's your natural nature so if you
[44:26] were buoyant you were loud you were the
[44:29] life of the party so to speak that was
[44:32] natural to you as well so if you was
[44:34] high-tempered high strung whatever it
[44:35] was and that was the husband that you
[44:39] were actually married to so your husband
[44:43] was your first nature and it ruled you
[44:47] as the man is the head of the home as
[44:51] Christ is the head of the body right
[44:55] that's the way God has the order of
[44:57] protocol and headship so then the
[44:59] natural nature that every one of us were
[45:01] born with that was our first husband
[45:04] which had the rule over us so it wasn't
[45:07] that he sat down and talked with us and
[45:09] said now look I'm stubborn I'm
[45:11] hard-headed I'm dominating I'm this this
[45:13] and this and I want your hands I want
[45:15] your eyes I want your nose I want your
[45:17] mouth I want your temperament so that I
[45:19] can be able to display myself and then
[45:21] you said no no no I don't like that I
[45:23] don't want to be that way no you did
[45:25] actually because that was your husband
[45:29] so you were married to that Husband by
[45:33] conception of your mother conceiving
[45:36] from your father then you receive this
[45:38] natural makeup now can't you see why the
[45:42] new births must replace that it must
[45:46] change it this is why it's not enough to
[45:49] just become a church member now that's
[45:52] sad to say but that's where much of
[45:55] Christianity is left today
[45:57] that they actually do get saved but they
[46:01] never go any farther now you can be
[46:05] saved and your first husband still
[46:09] dominating your
[46:12] life let me say it again you can be
[46:14] saved and your first husband dominating
[46:18] your life because you're saved
[46:21] individual but you're not remarried yet
[46:24] now what you said your Nature by natural
[46:26] birth natural you love the world because
[46:30] you are the world and you're part of the
[46:32] world that's right and he said your
[46:35] desires was by nature to love the world
[46:38] which you're a part of you're a part of
[46:41] nature so that's not odd that's not
[46:43] unusual for the people that are without
[46:46] the Holy Ghost to love the world it's
[46:48] not it's not you know something really
[46:50] strange and odd because that was the
[46:53] nature we all receive we were born of
[46:56] that
[46:57] is it unusual for a bear to act like a
[47:00] bear wouldn't it be really odd if you
[47:03] pull up in the parking lot today and and
[47:05] sitting over beside you in a car was
[47:07] sitting a black bear sitting behind the
[47:09] steering wheel and that black bear drove
[47:11] the car to church and the black bear
[47:13] gets out and it's got on a three-piece
[47:14] suit like mine and got on black shoes
[47:16] like mine with a tie on and you're
[47:18] saying my lord I can't believe this that
[47:21] that bear drove that car to church that
[47:23] bear is dressed up my that that bear
[47:26] surely that bears not going to church
[47:28] wouldn't that really be odd wouldn't
[47:29] that really be strange why it's against
[47:32] its nature but what would it be you saw
[47:36] that bear killing you know a baby calf
[47:38] eating on that calf that's not really
[47:40] odd that's what they do so that bear
[47:42] would smell you and be gone and you
[47:45] you'd see by Nature it's only acting out
[47:48] what it is so when we see Sinners really
[47:51] we should not in that sense really
[47:53] condemn them for what they are doing
[47:55] like nature they're Hogs they live like
[47:58] Hogs they wallow in the marrow like
[48:02] Hogs is that right because it's their
[48:05] nature but what we ought to be ashamed
[48:07] of is people who claim to be Christians
[48:10] and claim to be born again and they're
[48:13] wallowing out there like a
[48:15] pig and acting like a pig and eating
[48:18] what pigs eat and then they claim to
[48:20] have the Holy Ghost no there's something
[48:21] wrong somewhere it's like a bear sitting
[48:23] and driving a car and putting a suit on
[48:25] that's not the way that it works so
[48:28] whenever we're born into this and then
[48:30] we are married to that it's not that God
[48:34] actually condemns The Sinner because the
[48:36] sinner smokes and The Sinner drinks and
[48:39] The Sinner lies and The Sinner cheats
[48:41] God don't condemn the Sinners because
[48:43] they do that he does he condemns them
[48:45] because they refuse to be changed and
[48:49] make them where they don't have to do
[48:50] that anymore right so it's not even the
[48:54] sinner that sins now listen Sinners
[48:59] don't sin Christians do right Sinners
[49:05] are Sinners by Nature so when God looks
[49:08] at them it's not like oh I condemn you
[49:10] because you smoke I condemn you because
[49:12] you drink I condemn you because you look
[49:15] at pornography no no God condemns them
[49:18] because they're a sinner but if
[49:21] Christians socalled do those very things
[49:24] same things then God condemns us and
[49:26] that's why he has Ministry that will
[49:28] come and preach the gospel and say it's
[49:31] wrong for you to do that it's wrong for
[49:33] you to do that and you see with Sinners
[49:36] they're condemned because categorically
[49:38] they're place in that state of being a
[49:41] sinner but God will have men of God to
[49:44] preach individually to Christians and
[49:47] name their individual
[49:50] sins you understand now once you by
[49:54] desire was by nature to love the world
[49:56] with you're a part of you are a part of
[49:58] nature you believe that the people say
[50:01] amen there and that's your natural thing
[50:03] that's the reason you have to be born
[50:06] again you have to separate now notice
[50:09] what has to happen to you you have to
[50:12] die to that first husband now remember
[50:15] that first husband is not the devil per
[50:21] se it's not Satan or demons per se
[50:27] it is the act between a that took place
[50:33] in the beginning before Adam ever got to
[50:35] his wife in between Satan and
[50:39] Eve and then this has every human being
[50:44] with this type of Fallen nature now
[50:47] remember Satan don't have to do it again
[50:49] and again and again and again all he had
[50:52] to do was do it one time then when the
[50:56] seed Li Minds become mixed in Genesis
[50:58] chapter 6 then every person born is
[51:02] going to have this type of
[51:05] nature now watch he says then we're
[51:08] married to this first nature you have to
[51:10] die to that first husband you can't live
[51:13] with it you can't say well I'll divorce
[51:17] him you can't
[51:19] divorce the first nature I'll divorce
[51:22] him and hang him up till the occasion no
[51:25] sir no writing of divorcement he dies
[51:29] the nature of the world has to die every
[51:32] Speck of him has to die and you have to
[51:35] be
[51:37] reunited again with another
[51:41] nature now notice then so your first
[51:44] husband was your first nature so in
[51:47] order to truly be born again your first
[51:50] nature SL husband has to die but you
[51:54] can't remain without a nature natur so
[51:57] you've got to have a new nature and that
[52:01] new nature will actually be your new
[52:05] husband so that new nature is not what I
[52:08] quit drinking and I quit smoking and I
[52:10] quit no no no no you're do you're doing
[52:13] wrong you're looking at it wrong you're
[52:16] looking well i' done this and I'd done
[52:18] that your new nature is not what you do
[52:22] it's him it's him then he comes in you
[52:26] with his own life he is actually reborn
[52:31] in you every time a person gets the Holy
[52:34] Ghost the Lord Jesus is born in another
[52:38] life praise God every spec of him has to
[52:43] die and you have to be reunited again
[52:47] now remember you are a trinity a tri you
[52:50] being in that you have a soul you have a
[52:53] spirit and you have a body so God cannot
[52:56] kill this sinful nature and leave you
[53:00] without a husband it's mandatory you've
[53:03] got to be married again because without
[53:05] a husband slash nature you would not be
[53:09] the full manifestation of a human being
[53:12] but he will not divorce that one and say
[53:15] well I'll tell you what we'll give him a
[53:17] writing of divorcement and we'll just
[53:19] move him out of the house and then the
[53:21] Lord Jesus say I I I'll move in I'll
[53:24] just move in the house and and mean you
[53:26] have a a wedding ceremony and and this
[53:29] old nature he'll be he'll be down the
[53:31] street you know he'll be down the street
[53:33] you you'll pass by and see him every now
[53:35] and then and he'll pass by and see you
[53:37] every now and then well we know how
[53:39] through social media that many people
[53:42] have met Old Flames and old boyfriends
[53:45] and old girlfriends and they connect on
[53:48] Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and
[53:50] flipflop a lot of other stuff like that
[53:53] well come on don't sit there and look at
[53:54] me like you don't know what I'm talking
[53:56] about and they go to getting reunited
[53:59] with that old flame they call it God
[54:01] don't want you and I reunited with that
[54:04] old flame so God's going to take care of
[54:07] that God said that old boy has got to be
[54:13] dead and there's only one way he can die
[54:16] you have to submit your nature and say
[54:20] God kill
[54:22] him kill him every Speck of him I don't
[54:26] want moving down the street and I'll
[54:29] pass by and going to work I'll pass by
[54:31] and going to church I'll pass by and
[54:34] going to Walmart and no the first thing
[54:36] you know it be S out there waving at you
[54:38] go as you go by and then you'll get your
[54:40] email address as we say then he'll get
[54:43] your text and then he'll get this and
[54:45] that and the other and that old nature
[54:47] would go to contacting you and then
[54:49] before you know it all the churches
[54:51] backslid again because their Old Flame
[54:54] has finally got their attention one more
[54:57] time but God says I am going to make
[55:00] this so secure that once they come into
[55:05] my way of a new birst they will never
[55:10] again Fall
[55:13] Away now listen to me you can be
[55:18] saved and later lose your salvation
[55:26] the disciples were
[55:29] saved before
[55:32] Pentecost and every one of them denied
[55:34] the Lord
[55:36] Jesus Judas was
[55:39] saved but went to
[55:42] hell so you can lose
[55:46] salvation but you can't lose the Holy
[55:51] Ghost praise be to
[55:54] God now what you had to be reunited
[55:58] again with another nature which is the
[56:03] husband your name of your first
[56:08] nature was born now listen what the name
[56:11] of your husband
[56:12] was your name of your first nature was
[56:16] born and put in a Book of Life all your
[56:21] Deeds were wrote in it too everything
[56:24] you done under that nature so whenever
[56:28] you were born then Mom and Daddy gave
[56:31] that nature a name so in my case July
[56:36] the 9th 1956 8 or 9:00 something like
[56:40] that in the morning whenever I was born
[56:43] my nature was given the name Donald Lee
[56:47] Reagan
[56:50] Jr that was my nature's
[56:54] name then God recorded that name in a
[56:59] book called The Book of
[57:01] Life then when I got old enough and I
[57:04] started doing wrong it started being
[57:07] recorded under what that
[57:11] name now I was joined to that I wasn't
[57:16] too awful Wicked but I was
[57:20] lost I've done a few mean things in my
[57:24] life but
[57:26] that nature dominated me and even some
[57:30] of the things I do I would think how
[57:34] come me to do that I don't understand
[57:36] why I did and y'all ever do that you
[57:37] ever wonder why in the world did I do
[57:39] that I mean you know some things that
[57:41] people do even their conscience if they
[57:43] have one would tell them that it's not
[57:45] right for them to do but why do we do it
[57:47] it's our husband he rules over us with
[57:52] such a
[57:53] domain that we just submit to him
[57:57] praise be to God now notice and so your
[58:01] name of your first nature was born and
[58:03] put in the book of life and all your
[58:05] Deeds was wrote in that too everything
[58:08] you done under that nature was put in a
[58:12] book called The Book of Life now but
[58:16] when you were separated from that Union
[58:19] notice how he's typing it now with
[58:21] marriage with your husband and your
[58:23] nature when you were separated from that
[58:25] Union by spiritual deaths your natural
[58:29] desire to cut your hair your natural
[58:32] desire to wear shorts paint your face
[58:35] your natural desire to be intellectual
[58:38] smart men to know something better than
[58:40] the other that's what Eve wanted that's
[58:42] the very thing she wanted so it was it
[58:45] was natural for us to do whatever our
[58:49] husband said I want to drink and that's
[58:53] what some of you all did because your
[58:55] natural nature thirsted for alcohol a
[58:59] stimulus of something that would help
[59:03] you maybe you've got a a nature that
[59:05] kind of leans toward depression and you
[59:07] don't have a lot of interior happiness
[59:09] or exterior happiness and you find a
[59:12] stimulant maybe when you're young and
[59:15] you begin to become addicted to that and
[59:17] it releases of course the endorphins in
[59:19] your brain and gives you that Feelgood
[59:22] feeling and once you ever do then it's
[59:26] so much easier to go back to a needle or
[59:28] a pill or a bottle to be able to help
[59:31] you feel good again so what was that
[59:35] that was that husband that you were
[59:38] married to and even though you might
[59:40] hear teaching now don't do that that's
[59:42] wrong that's wrong yes yes I know that's
[59:45] wrong I've got to quit doing this and
[59:47] you want to with all of your heart and
[59:49] you make up your mind you might even go
[59:51] to church and you might get saved but
[59:53] you can be saved sitting in a church Pew
[59:56] you could be baptized in water and start
[59:59] doing all types of good religious deeds
[1:00:02] and that old husband of yours still
[1:00:04] alive and well inside of your soul and
[1:00:08] he'll leave you alone for a while but
[1:00:10] it's only for a while because he's got
[1:00:12] to be in control he's got to be in
[1:00:16] charge now God's way then is to bring us
[1:00:21] if it was the natural birth that married
[1:00:24] us to the Natural Union and there was a
[1:00:27] name a book a nature a name a book a
[1:00:32] nature and that name and that book and
[1:00:35] that nature was our former
[1:00:38] identification then God also must give a
[1:00:41] new name a new book and a new
[1:00:45] nature now notice so there has to be a
[1:00:48] new name and there has to be a new book
[1:00:52] now this is where your name once you're
[1:00:55] truly born again there is a
[1:00:59] transfer a
[1:01:01] transfer now it's not actually that your
[1:01:03] name is you know literally written over
[1:01:05] here and then God blots it out and he
[1:01:07] transfers it over here but it's in a
[1:01:08] symbolism of you to be able to see but
[1:01:11] the prophet says you say my old name is
[1:01:15] actually my name has been transferred
[1:01:18] what he said it's no longer identified
[1:01:20] in the old book but you're identified
[1:01:23] living under a new nature in the new
[1:01:26] book which what is this book called the
[1:01:29] Lamb's Book of Life and then he goes on
[1:01:32] to call this Lamb's Book of Life your
[1:01:35] marriage
[1:01:37] certificate now I perform many weddings
[1:01:39] as you folks know and once I do that
[1:01:42] then the license given to me in two
[1:01:44] types of papers they are given to me and
[1:01:47] it is my responsibility to take them to
[1:01:51] the courthouse I performed a wedding
[1:01:52] last night and Lord willing tomorrow I
[1:01:55] will will take that marriage certificate
[1:01:57] to the courthouse I had to fill it out I
[1:02:00] had to date it I had to verify was it
[1:02:03] religious or civil what the time was so
[1:02:06] on and so on brother JD was a witness of
[1:02:08] it and then it is my
[1:02:11] responsibility within three days to
[1:02:14] return this to the courthouse whenever I
[1:02:17] go to the courthouse I will go in and I
[1:02:20] will hand it to them did you perform
[1:02:22] this yes I did your name Donnie Reagan
[1:02:25] yes okay do you want to take their copy
[1:02:28] yes I do sometimes I'll take their copy
[1:02:30] and give it to them it cannot be carried
[1:02:33] in by the witness it cannot be carried
[1:02:36] in by some of you that were there it is
[1:02:39] my
[1:02:41] responsibility I'm actually hell liable
[1:02:44] if I do not return it you see there's
[1:02:47] something about the man performing the
[1:02:50] ceremony that has a
[1:02:52] responsibility well the Lord God was not
[1:02:55] going to give give this up to anybody
[1:02:57] else he's going to have to have men that
[1:03:00] are responsible that will be able to
[1:03:03] stand on the earth and join him and his
[1:03:07] bride together so it ain't everybody
[1:03:10] that goes to Seminary and ain't ever
[1:03:12] preacher that goes to Bible school it's
[1:03:15] God called God ordained Holy Ghost
[1:03:18] filled men that God will use to bring
[1:03:22] him and his bride together under the
[1:03:25] administration
[1:03:26] of the son of
[1:03:28] man now listen to this so your name then
[1:03:32] is in under that category when you're
[1:03:35] first born notice the prophet goes on to
[1:03:37] saying now when you were separated from
[1:03:39] that Union by spiritual debt your
[1:03:41] natural desire will die so what happens
[1:03:44] to that look with me if you would in 1
[1:03:47] Peter chap 1:3 blessed be the God and
[1:03:50] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:03:53] according to His abundant Mercy has
[1:03:55] begot gotten us again now remember the
[1:03:57] Lord Jesus was the first one in John
[1:03:59] 3:16 that begin to say these words you
[1:04:02] know that God so Lov the world that he
[1:04:04] gave his only begotten son now at the
[1:04:08] time that the Lord Jesus says this he is
[1:04:11] the only begotten Son of
[1:04:14] God but he's not
[1:04:16] today because there's other Sons and
[1:04:19] Daughters of God that are begotten by
[1:04:23] the Holy Ghost amen well that's what
[1:04:25] your Bible ible says to the Abundant
[1:04:27] Mercy hath begotten us again unto a
[1:04:30] lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ from the dead now watch how Peter
[1:04:36] takes what what Paul said in Romans 7 so
[1:04:40] we then have begotten and given a lively
[1:04:43] hope how by joining the church shaking
[1:04:45] the preacher's hand though but by the
[1:04:48] resurrection of our Lord Jesus in verse
[1:04:51] four to an inheritance Incorruptible and
[1:04:55] unde defiled and that fadeth not away
[1:04:58] reserved in heaven for you now Peter
[1:05:01] goes a little bit further in verse 23
[1:05:04] being born again notice
[1:05:08] born again not of corruptible seed but
[1:05:14] of
[1:05:15] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:05:18] liveth and abideth forever now notice
[1:05:22] what God does by truth God communicates
[1:05:27] a living principle to the soul that
[1:05:31] receives his seed word which is the
[1:05:35] Sperma that's the Greek word he Sperma
[1:05:39] now I'm not talking about now people
[1:05:42] getting just
[1:05:46] saved here's the issue
[1:05:49] friends a lot of folks get
[1:05:52] saved and they think they're born again
[1:05:57] they think they got everything they need
[1:06:00] when they got
[1:06:02] saved but remember as I told you before
[1:06:05] the disciples were
[1:06:07] saved but they were not
[1:06:12] converted read with me in Matthew
[1:06:15] 18:2 Jesus called a little child unto
[1:06:18] him and set him in the midst of them and
[1:06:20] said verily I say unto you except ye be
[1:06:24] converted so the Lord Jesus is talking
[1:06:27] to the 12
[1:06:29] preachers now they were arguing about
[1:06:32] who's going to be the greatest and the
[1:06:33] kingdom and that's what a lot of the
[1:06:35] preacher problem is around the message a
[1:06:37] lot of the preachers ain't got the Holy
[1:06:38] Ghost yet they ever get it ain't no time
[1:06:40] what in the world they'll do but and oh
[1:06:41] my we're waiting on them to get it
[1:06:43] because they're still arguing who's got
[1:06:45] the biggest Ministry and who's got the
[1:06:47] biggest church and who's got more
[1:06:49] Revelation about this so Jesus Took a
[1:06:51] child and he said look boys unless you
[1:06:54] guys become converted it what an
[1:06:56] embarrassing thing to say to your 12 men
[1:06:59] that you personally called yourself and
[1:07:02] you wind up telling them 12 men that you
[1:07:05] have called you boys ain't converted
[1:07:07] yet now they had accepted Jesus as their
[1:07:11] savior they had been baptized in Water
[1:07:15] by Jesus himself amen but they had not
[1:07:18] been baptized in the spirit by Jesus
[1:07:22] himself now watch what he goes on to
[1:07:24] tell him in verse three and he said
[1:07:25] surely I say unto you except ye be
[1:07:30] converted and become as little children
[1:07:33] so they were disciples but they were not
[1:07:36] converted they were disciples and
[1:07:38] preachers casting out Devils Healing The
[1:07:41] Sick raising the Dead doing the same
[1:07:44] signs the Lord Jesus did but they had
[1:07:46] not yet been quickened to a new husband
[1:07:49] to have this humble nature that children
[1:07:53] have so they were doing signs wers
[1:07:55] Miracles and it made them proud and
[1:08:01] arrogant why first husman was alive and
[1:08:05] well notice whosoever therefore shall
[1:08:08] humble himself as this little child the
[1:08:12] same is the greatest in the Kingdom of
[1:08:16] Heaven so his disciples had not yet
[1:08:20] entered into the kingdom of heaven
[1:08:26] but they were
[1:08:28] saved working signs wonders
[1:08:32] Miracles when they returned back after
[1:08:35] Jesus sent them out 2 by two in Matthew
[1:08:39] 10 Jesus said I saw Satan as Lightning
[1:08:44] cast down out of Heaven they were
[1:08:46] rejoicing God we saw the lame W walk we
[1:08:49] saw this we saw that he said don't
[1:08:52] Rejoice because that happens to you but
[1:08:55] but rather Rejoice that your names are
[1:09:01] written now watch the Lord Jesus Luke
[1:09:04] 22:32 speaks person now to Peter I have
[1:09:08] prayed for thee that thy face fail not
[1:09:12] when thou
[1:09:14] art read
[1:09:19] ited so you mean Peter is not yet
[1:09:23] converted either
[1:09:26] yet he had the keys to the kingdom
[1:09:28] Healing The Sick casting out Devils so
[1:09:31] on and so on and Peter turned out to be
[1:09:34] a cussing
[1:09:36] preacher well praise the
[1:09:39] Lord but Peter was
[1:09:43] saved but he didn't have the Holy
[1:09:46] Ghost so Peter was still
[1:09:49] married to his first husband which had
[1:09:52] the rule over
[1:09:53] him well y'all are Qui
[1:09:56] today notice in Mark
[1:09:59] 16:16 he that belith and is
[1:10:03] baptized shall be
[1:10:07] saved but notice Jesus does not say now
[1:10:11] that when you're saved saved and getting
[1:10:13] the Holy Ghost is the same thing that's
[1:10:16] the church that read that into the Bible
[1:10:19] not the original Apostles it is not
[1:10:22] Apostolic doctrine that when you get
[1:10:24] saved you get the Holy Ghost at the same
[1:10:27] time well come on somebody say Amen if
[1:10:30] you can't say Amen say ouch or ow me or
[1:10:32] something so I know you're here with me
[1:10:35] now remember these are the words of the
[1:10:36] Lord Jesus not me not some other
[1:10:38] preacher he that believeth and is
[1:10:40] baptized shall be saved look at what the
[1:10:43] word saved means Soo the Greek word Soo
[1:10:47] so it's the exact same word that is
[1:10:50] whenever Jesus would tell many of them
[1:10:52] that uh you are healed by your faith so
[1:10:54] it means Soo means that you are saved
[1:10:57] spiritually or saved physically from
[1:11:00] your sickness so people can be
[1:11:03] saved from
[1:11:05] cancer and come back again and die with
[1:11:08] it later people people could be saved
[1:11:12] look at what the word saved means to
[1:11:14] rescue from danger or destruction to
[1:11:18] save or
[1:11:20] rescue and this is where friends many
[1:11:23] people think because
[1:11:25] they get
[1:11:27] saved they have eternal life don't you
[1:11:30] see what preachers have done they have
[1:11:32] taken scriptures which apply only to
[1:11:35] those who are truly born again and they
[1:11:39] apply them straight across the board to
[1:11:41] anybody then that is saved has eternal
[1:11:44] life and eternal security that is
[1:11:47] damnable Doctrine
[1:11:55] praise the lord it's warm in here this
[1:11:58] morning it is just
[1:12:01] me watch Acts chapter 2 verse 21 and it
[1:12:04] shall come to pass that whosoever shall
[1:12:07] call upon the name of the Lord shall
[1:12:11] be
[1:12:14] rescued from
[1:12:17] danger but just because you're
[1:12:20] rescued does not mean you're rescued to
[1:12:23] a place of Eternity
[1:12:25] as a matter of fact you can turn right
[1:12:27] back around and go to the very same spot
[1:12:29] that you were in and lose your rescue or
[1:12:33] your
[1:12:34] salvation acts
[1:12:36] 16:30 and brought them out and said sir
[1:12:39] now remember this is the Philippian
[1:12:41] Jailer so whenever Paul and Silas are
[1:12:44] beaten of course and then taken to Jail
[1:12:46] the Lord shook the jail house down then
[1:12:47] the Jailer comes and asks them what must
[1:12:51] I do to be saved and they said Believe
[1:12:54] on the Lord Jesus
[1:12:57] Christ and thou shalt be filled with the
[1:12:59] Holy Ghost read your Bible the way it
[1:13:02] says it Thou shalt be saved and thy
[1:13:08] house not filled with the Holy Ghost now
[1:13:11] remember Judas es scariot was
[1:13:16] saved he was a preacher had great
[1:13:19] anointing is that right lived a Godly
[1:13:22] life Judas was the treasure
[1:13:26] of Jesus ministry so anybody that give
[1:13:29] tithes and offerings to the Lord Jesus
[1:13:32] Judas packed it around in his pocket so
[1:13:34] he must have been a trustworthy sort of
[1:13:36] a character so he was saved but later
[1:13:41] lost his
[1:13:43] salvation second Peter 2 ver 20 for if
[1:13:48] after they have escaped or been
[1:13:53] saved the pollut s of the world through
[1:13:56] the knowledge of the Lord and Savior
[1:13:58] Jesus Christ they are
[1:14:01] again in Tangled therein and
[1:14:05] overcome the latter end is worse with
[1:14:09] them than the
[1:14:12] beginning so people then can be
[1:14:14] delivered from sin and delivered from so
[1:14:18] many things and turn right back around
[1:14:21] and go right back into it is that what
[1:14:23] the Bible says and the latter end of
[1:14:26] those people was actually worse than
[1:14:30] what it was before how was that even
[1:14:34] possible that a person could be
[1:14:36] delivered and turn and go back and
[1:14:39] become
[1:14:40] worse their husband never
[1:14:44] died you see if that nature ever dies
[1:14:49] once there is no
[1:14:51] Resurrection for that nature this is why
[1:14:54] God so designed the new birth it is
[1:14:57] absolute eternal
[1:15:00] security there's nothing else for you to
[1:15:03] go back to there is no old husband you
[1:15:08] did not divorce him but if people come
[1:15:12] out of darkness and out of sin and
[1:15:14] whatever more and then they turn and go
[1:15:16] right back to you know as well as I do
[1:15:18] we've seen many of them and they become
[1:15:21] worse than they were before they ever
[1:15:24] even come to the Lord is that right why
[1:15:27] because that husband of theirs he comes
[1:15:30] out with a
[1:15:33] rage you will not do me that way again
[1:15:36] don't you ever think about doing me that
[1:15:39] way oh my here he come I'm telling you
[1:15:42] what woman you're going to do what I
[1:15:44] tell you to do I am your rid do you
[1:15:48] understand you drunk beer before next
[1:15:50] time you're drinking vodka you you smoke
[1:15:53] marijuana the next time you're smok and
[1:15:55] cry and they get worse and worse and how
[1:15:57] many have we
[1:16:00] seen because that husband
[1:16:03] raises with such a Vengeance
[1:16:09] amen notice Peter in verse 21 says I
[1:16:12] want you to listen friends what this man
[1:16:14] is
[1:16:14] saying it had been better for them not
[1:16:19] to have known the way of
[1:16:21] righteousness then after they have known
[1:16:24] it to turn turn from the holy
[1:16:28] commandment delivered unto
[1:16:32] them I don't mind telling you this
[1:16:34] morning some of the folks that's been
[1:16:35] around our ranks that' been better off
[1:16:37] to stay in their denominational chicken
[1:16:40] house then to have come under the truth
[1:16:43] and set under the ministry of the word
[1:16:44] of this hour and then turn and go back
[1:16:47] to that listen what the Bible says about
[1:16:50] it it has happened unto them according
[1:16:53] to the true proverb the
[1:16:57] dog the
[1:16:59] dog not a
[1:17:01] sheep but the dog has turned to his own
[1:17:05] vomit
[1:17:07] again so you mean they were saved they
[1:17:10] were delivered they were helped they
[1:17:12] were ministered to and the whole time
[1:17:17] they were still a
[1:17:19] dog oh Lord God help
[1:17:23] us and the
[1:17:25] style that was
[1:17:27] washed to her
[1:17:30] wallowing in the
[1:17:33] m so when she was sitting in the Pew she
[1:17:36] was still a s when she got saved brother
[1:17:39] John she was still how brother Donnie
[1:17:42] how is that possible that old husband
[1:17:45] was still
[1:17:47] alive Jew says it this way in verse 5 I
[1:17:50] will therefore put you in remembrance
[1:17:52] though you once knew this how the Lord
[1:17:54] Lord having
[1:17:57] saved the people out of the land of
[1:18:00] Egypt afterward destroyed
[1:18:05] them that believed not so you mean God
[1:18:09] saved them and give them a Salvation in
[1:18:13] the Old Testament and later destroyed
[1:18:15] some of the same ones he he sa because
[1:18:19] they refused to go on
[1:18:26] a so-called message preacher made this
[1:18:28] statement sometime back there are going
[1:18:30] to be people inside the Catholic Church
[1:18:32] who've given their heart to God who love
[1:18:35] the Lord who read the scripture who
[1:18:38] follow Jesus Christ who will be saved
[1:18:41] who will be in the bride who will go in
[1:18:45] the
[1:18:48] Rapture how is that possible when you're
[1:18:50] praying to Joseph and praying to Mary
[1:18:52] and praying to St Cecilia
[1:18:55] if that is true why do we even need the
[1:18:57] Holy Ghost why do we even need a
[1:19:02] message come on don't get quiet on me
[1:19:06] now his statement goes on to say because
[1:19:09] they may be in the Catholic church but
[1:19:11] the Catholic Church isn't in
[1:19:14] them who ever heard of such
[1:19:17] nonsense now does that line up with the
[1:19:20] scripture and the message you ought to
[1:19:21] have enough sense to know this is what
[1:19:24] the spirit of God said in the Book of
[1:19:25] Revelation 18:4 I heard another voice
[1:19:28] from Heaven saying come out of her my
[1:19:31] people that you be not partakers of her
[1:19:35] sins that you receive not of her
[1:19:42] plagues come out of her my
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:50] people and this same message invisible
[1:19:53] union now he said
[1:19:55] so do every one of us know the whole
[1:19:57] rank of denomination Pentecostal and all
[1:19:59] are
[1:20:00] dead that is to the born again
[1:20:05] Christian of the
[1:20:08] message you see many people even around
[1:20:11] our ranks do not even understand the
[1:20:16] terminology of a word
[1:20:18] Birth by Malachi 4
[1:20:26] turn with me to Acts chapter 19 verse1
[1:20:29] let's look at some real Christians real
[1:20:33] disciples and it came to pass that while
[1:20:35] Apollos was at Corinth Paul having
[1:20:37] passed to the upper Coast came to
[1:20:40] Ephesus and finding certain disciples
[1:20:44] now notice what Luke calls these group
[1:20:46] of people
[1:20:48] disciples and he said unto them have you
[1:20:51] received the Holy Ghost since
[1:20:55] you
[1:20:58] believed oh my goodness you mean the
[1:21:00] Holy Ghost is different from
[1:21:02] believing now I want you to notice here
[1:21:04] have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:21:08] since you
[1:21:10] believed I want you to look at this word
[1:21:12] believed you're talking about
[1:21:14] powerful it's from a Greek root word
[1:21:17] which is used in many different forms in
[1:21:18] the New Testament of pistus p i s t i s
[1:21:21] this is pisu pistu
[1:21:25] and it means to commit one's trust
[1:21:29] to to think to be true so notice what
[1:21:32] Paul's asking them have you all received
[1:21:35] the Holy Ghost since you committed your
[1:21:38] trust to Jesus
[1:21:41] Christ you gave him your heart as would
[1:21:44] say you're trusting him for
[1:21:48] salvation you
[1:21:50] are a disciple
[1:21:55] look at the meaning of the words that
[1:21:56] goes on you is in the New Testament of
[1:21:58] the conviction and Trust to which a man
[1:22:01] is impelled by a certain inner and
[1:22:05] higher prerogative of the law of the
[1:22:08] soul to trust in Jesus as able to Aid
[1:22:14] either in obtaining or in doing
[1:22:18] something
[1:22:19] Saving Face
[1:22:26] wow I just described to you the
[1:22:31] majority of modern
[1:22:38] Christendom you mean to tell me that
[1:22:40] Paul would ask them have you all got the
[1:22:43] Holy Ghost after they've done reach this
[1:22:47] well isn't the cross
[1:22:52] enough well apparently Paul
[1:22:55] did not feel like them accepting his
[1:22:57] death on the cross and them accepting
[1:23:00] him as their savior was
[1:23:05] enough that's Apostolic Doctrine that's
[1:23:09] the doctrine of the Bible your Bible
[1:23:19] amen now Paul been some of the modern
[1:23:21] preachers and said I understand you
[1:23:23] folks are believers yes we've accepted
[1:23:24] Jesus Christ we've committed our soul to
[1:23:27] him we love him with all of our hearts
[1:23:29] we are completely trusting him and him
[1:23:31] alone we're not looking to anything we
[1:23:33] do we're not no works this this is Paul
[1:23:35] said glory to God Brothers hallelujah
[1:23:38] amen boy you all have got her but Paul
[1:23:42] was saying uh y'all just got
[1:23:46] started y'all just got started have
[1:23:49] y'all got the holy
[1:23:50] ghost wonder where we need the Holy
[1:23:52] Ghost for we've done committed to Christ
[1:23:54] but you know what they were
[1:23:56] christless
[1:24:00] Christians now listen at these people
[1:24:03] and they said unto him we've not so much
[1:24:07] as heard whether there be any Holy
[1:24:14] Ghost
[1:24:17] wow and he said unto them unto what then
[1:24:20] were you baptized and they said un
[1:24:21] John's baptism there several
[1:24:23] dispensations behind
[1:24:27] then Paul said John verily baptized with
[1:24:29] a baptism of repentance saying unto the
[1:24:30] people that they should believe on him
[1:24:32] which should come after him that is on
[1:24:34] Christ Jesus and when they heard this
[1:24:37] they were baptized in the bleep bleep
[1:24:40] bleep bleep bleep
[1:24:46] bleep which is the only way that you'll
[1:24:48] find in the scripture that was ever
[1:24:49] recorded ain't one person in the Bible
[1:24:52] that was ever baptized in titles you
[1:24:54] show me and I'll eat the whole book you
[1:24:57] show me in history for the first 300
[1:24:59] years I can take it from one to another
[1:25:02] to another of historian but what did the
[1:25:05] devil want to do he wanted to blot out
[1:25:07] the name of the bridegroom so that when
[1:25:10] you come to Christianity you'd be
[1:25:13] married up to titles instead of the name
[1:25:17] oh Hallelujah which one of you women
[1:25:20] here today when you would get married
[1:25:22] would want to be married to your husband
[1:25:24] hband and just call him son or brother
[1:25:27] or uncle or nephew and he may be all of
[1:25:30] them but what did you take on is I
[1:25:32] performed the wedding yesterday and I
[1:25:35] introduced that couple as who not Mr and
[1:25:38] Miss John Doe Mr and Miss son of the
[1:25:41] father of the grandfather of the great
[1:25:43] grandfather but I introduce that couple
[1:25:46] in the name of the bridegroom remember
[1:25:50] there must be a new name and a new book
[1:25:53] and a new nature Hallelujah in order to
[1:25:57] go in the
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:07] Rapture and when they heard this they
[1:26:10] were baptized in the
[1:26:13] name of the Lord
[1:26:20] Jesus now for those false preachers that
[1:26:23] have taught
[1:26:25] that the Holy Ghost is only for the 12
[1:26:28] apostles this is several years after
[1:26:30] Acts 2 and these people here wasn't even
[1:26:33] preachers now I want you to listen what
[1:26:35] happened to them after they finally got
[1:26:37] baptized right well glory to God when
[1:26:42] Paul laid his hands upon them and the
[1:26:46] Holy Ghost came on them and they spake
[1:26:50] with tongues and prophesy amen
[1:26:54] well praise the Lord that sounds like an
[1:26:57] oh ho Holy Ghost oldfashioned Sanctified
[1:27:00] by my Dynamic power of God Revival
[1:27:04] movement they were already saved they
[1:27:06] were already trusting the Lord Jesus
[1:27:09] they had already earned the title of
[1:27:12] disciples but they did not have Christ
[1:27:15] Jesus living in their soul they were not
[1:27:18] married yet and reunited to another
[1:27:21] nature so they went down and baptism him
[1:27:24] in his name what's going on the marriage
[1:27:27] ceremony do you take this woman to be
[1:27:30] your lawful wedded wife do you promise
[1:27:32] to love to cherish to care for her as
[1:27:35] long as you both shall live I do do you

[1:27:53] invested in me I pronounce you are man
[1:27:57] and wife in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:28:01] Christ you may kiss your

[1:28:41] saved you see that's the way salvation

[1:29:43] God ha raised him from the
[1:29:45] dead Thou shalt be
[1:29:49] saved with a heart man believeth into
[1:29:52] righteousness
[1:29:54] with a mouse confession is
[1:29:56] made unto
[1:29:58] salvation how easy it is to quote this
[1:30:02] and leave out Acts
[1:30:04] 19 you see well a lot of preachers and a
[1:30:06] lot of churches are leading the
[1:30:08] modern-day
[1:30:09] Christians do you understand where
[1:30:11] they're going to take them the
[1:30:14] tribulation
[1:30:20] period God help me God help us preachers
[1:30:23] here at this church
[1:30:29] so people today can be
[1:30:31] saved and lose their
[1:30:34] salvation John 3:17 for God sent not his
[1:30:37] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:30:39] but that the world through
[1:30:42] him ah Here We Go Again might might
[1:30:48] might but let's read Ephesians
[1:30:51] 1:12 that we should be to the pra of his
[1:30:55] glory who first
[1:30:58] trusted in
[1:31:01] Christ Paul's talking about himself now
[1:31:03] watch he it brings on down to this is
[1:31:04] the church that he's birthed through the
[1:31:05] word and whom ye also
[1:31:10] trusted after that you heard the word of
[1:31:15] Truth The Gospel of your salvation and
[1:31:18] the church said amen but let's not stop
[1:31:21] there so notice what it happened they
[1:31:24] had trusted after they heard and the
[1:31:28] gospel of your salvation in whom also
[1:31:32] after that ye
[1:31:35] believed so they trusted they heard and
[1:31:38] they
[1:31:40] believed and they still wouldn't
[1:31:45] sealed
[1:31:48] well and after that Ye beli Ye were
[1:31:56] Oh you mean they wouldn't see when they
[1:32:00] believed they except that Christ as
[1:32:02] their personal savior they trust in him
[1:32:04] yes that's what he said but he didn't
[1:32:06] stop he went
[1:32:08] on they actually were not sealed when
[1:32:11] they trusted they were not sealed when
[1:32:14] they
[1:32:15] believed they were sealed when they
[1:32:17] received the Holy
[1:32:19] Ghost according to the
[1:32:21] Bible how many believes the Bible
[1:32:26] and whom you also trusted after that you
[1:32:29] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[1:32:30] your salvation and whom also after that
[1:32:35] you
[1:32:35] believed you were
[1:32:38] sealed all right let's see what the
[1:32:41] meaning of this word is Mark with a seal
[1:32:46] for
[1:32:46] security from
[1:32:51] Satan Oh Glory to God
[1:32:55] amen Mark with a seal for security from
[1:33:00] Satan not when you believe you are
[1:33:03] sealed not when you heard you are sealed
[1:33:06] not when you join the church you are
[1:33:09] sealed but once you receive the true
[1:33:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost you are sealed
[1:33:15] with a mark from God for a sign of
[1:33:18] security from the devil and the Devil
[1:33:21] comes back and say whoa I can only get
[1:33:24] so close to her I can only get so close
[1:33:27] to him how do you know he's done married
[1:33:30] again she got married Oh Glory they have
[1:33:34] the Seal of
[1:33:36] authenticity upon their
[1:33:38] [Applause]
[1:33:45] soul now friends how many preachers in
[1:33:47] our modern pull pits preach this from
[1:33:50] their Bible not ours
[1:33:54] how many of them is going to stand
[1:33:55] before God and be held accountable
[1:33:58] because they never preached
[1:34:01] this come on
[1:34:05] Saints watch what the meaning of the
[1:34:07] word goes on to say Mark with the seal
[1:34:09] for security from Satan hence to
[1:34:12] confirm
[1:34:14] authenticate
[1:34:15] Place Beyond
[1:34:19] doubt to prove one's testimony
[1:34:24] to a person that he is what he professes
[1:34:29] to
[1:34:31] be to prove one's testimony to a person
[1:34:36] that he is what he professes to be thank
[1:34:40] God for the Holy Ghost thank God for
[1:34:44] believing thank God for the cross thank
[1:34:47] God for the blood but it is not the
[1:34:49] cross that seals you it is not salvation
[1:34:53] that seals you it is a new nature don't
[1:34:56] you understand what the Holy Ghost say
[1:34:58] it's the Lord Jesus in the form of the
[1:35:01] Holy Spirit coming inside of you
[1:35:05] reincarnating himself in your
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:21] body verse 14 which is the of our
[1:35:24] inheritance unto the Redemption of the
[1:35:26] purchased possession unto the praise of
[1:35:28] his glory 1 Timothy 2:3 for this is good
[1:35:31] and acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:35:33] savior who will have all men to be
[1:35:39] saved God don't want nobody to be
[1:35:41] lost but notice it didn't say have all
[1:35:45] men to receive the Holy
[1:35:48] Ghost Titus 35 not by works of
[1:35:51] righteousness which we have done but ACC
[1:35:53] according to his
[1:35:55] Mercy he saved us aren't you glad he
[1:35:58] saved you by the washing of regeneration
[1:36:00] and renewing of the Holy Ghost 2 Peter
[1:36:02] 3:9 the Lord is not slight concerning
[1:36:05] his promise as some men count slightness
[1:36:08] but his longsuffering to us word not
[1:36:10] willing that any should perish but that
[1:36:15] all should come to
[1:36:17] repentance God don't want nobody to be
[1:36:20] lost even though they're not
[1:36:22] elect right
[1:36:24] God loved Cain and went after
[1:36:30] him Revelation 21:22 and I saw no Temple
[1:36:34] therein for the Lord God Almighty and

[1:39:23] don't be an idiot it was not you that
[1:39:25] chose to be born naturally it was not
[1:39:28] you well I glory to God I done this and
[1:39:30] that and the other the Bible says of his
[1:39:33] own will begat he us with the word of
[1:39:37] Truth why because we were his children
[1:39:40] before the foundation of the world and
[1:39:43] he said I will I will that my children
[1:39:47] be saved I will and then he comes and
[1:39:50] says because I have so much Mercy in so
[1:39:53] much love I'm going to open it up for
[1:40:00] everybody so whosoever will let him
[1:40:05] come and take of the Water of Life
[1:40:13] freely can I have a few more minutes
[1:40:16] before we
[1:40:18] close John
[1:40:21] 1:1 he came into his own and his own
[1:40:24] received him
[1:40:25] not but to as many
[1:40:29] as received
[1:40:31] him them gave he exusia
[1:40:36] power to
[1:40:39] become the sons of
[1:40:42] God
[1:40:44] become be
[1:40:46] made come to
[1:40:49] pass be fulfilled
[1:40:53] don't you
[1:40:55] understand you are a
[1:41:03] prophecy your new birth brought you to
[1:41:10] pass you came oh
[1:41:13] children to
[1:41:15] become you came to
[1:41:18] pass when you were born of the spirit of
[1:41:21] God because you're a word a thought that
[1:41:23] come from God's
[1:41:25] presence and you staggered right in the
[1:41:28] darkness and the things of the world and
[1:41:29] didn't know what no world to look for
[1:41:31] but just like a promise say of Isaiah
[1:41:33] 7:14 you believe that's a promise of God
[1:41:35] a virgin shall conceive and bring forth
[1:41:37] a son we we know the scripture very
[1:41:39] familiar with it and it laid there for
[1:41:41] hundreds and hundreds of years but one
[1:41:43] day that word come to pass all your name
[1:41:47] was wrote there not the name of your
[1:41:49] first husband he knew what that name
[1:41:51] would be but he also o wrote your name
[1:41:54] in the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:41:56] foundation of the world your first book
[1:41:58] The Book of Life was not wrote before
[1:42:00] the foundation of the world it's only
[1:42:02] temporary and it only needs a slot of
[1:42:05] time do you understand every one of you
[1:42:07] today that are truly Born Again of the
[1:42:09] spirit of God you have no more Book of
[1:42:12] Life you do not have a book of life you
[1:42:17] are living under the new husband the new
[1:42:20] nature the Lamb's Book
[1:42:27] [Applause]
[1:42:31] but as many as received and to them gave
[1:42:32] you power to become the sons of God even
[1:42:35] to them that believe on his name which
[1:42:37] were born not of blood nor of the will
[1:42:41] of the flesh nor of the will of
[1:42:45] man but of
[1:42:56] Galatians 4:19 and I'll
[1:42:58] close my little
[1:43:01] children of whom I travail in
[1:43:06] birth until
[1:43:10] Christ be formed in
[1:43:17] you just as the formless
[1:43:21] embryo by degrees
[1:43:25] starts
[1:43:27] changing and taking on a
[1:43:32] form when it's first in the conception
[1:43:34] the few moments formless for days
[1:43:39] however long before it starts looking
[1:43:41] like a human being Paul catches this and
[1:43:45] he says my little children of whom I
[1:43:47] travail in burst look at the
[1:43:50] responsibility on a servant of God
[1:43:54] until I travail and burst until
[1:43:58] Christ be formed in you now he's calling
[1:44:01] them already his children so they
[1:44:03] Children of the
[1:44:05] gospel and he's warning them he's
[1:44:09] wanting them to
[1:44:11] mature but remember legalism had
[1:44:13] attacked the
[1:44:15] church it had delayed the stage of their
[1:44:18] growth and every time you and I get a
[1:44:21] setback you may Wonder sometime why is
[1:44:23] brother Donnie going back and preaching
[1:44:24] this and this and why why is brother
[1:44:26] Daryl preaching on that if you only had
[1:44:28] a little bit of spiritual Insight you'd
[1:44:30] know that the spirit of God is looking
[1:44:32] at the embryonic stage of some of those
[1:44:34] that's under the ministry and seeing
[1:44:37] that they went back under this sort of
[1:44:38] legalism or they've leaned too much
[1:44:40] toward Grace and they're leaning here
[1:44:42] and Paul said I travail again oh
[1:44:45] children how many times have you sent me
[1:44:48] in travail
[1:44:50] again I'm not here to preach for a
[1:44:53] living I'm not here to preach for a
[1:44:55] reputation I'm sent here to try to
[1:44:57] preach you into a body change I'm sent
[1:45:01] here to try to preach if you go by the
[1:45:02] way of the Grave that you will leave
[1:45:04] this Mortal body and in less than a
[1:45:07] second you'll step into the sixth
[1:45:08] dimension in another body I'm not here
[1:45:11] to preach for my health I'm not here to
[1:45:13] preach to pry to please you I want to
[1:45:15] preach unto Christ is formed
[1:45:19] [Applause]
[1:45:24] so the Christian by
[1:45:26] degrees takes on the likeness of Christ
[1:45:30] Jesus this is why Satan sends things
[1:45:32] your way and my way to try to stop the
[1:45:36] image from becoming more clear as our
[1:45:40] mother packed
[1:45:42] us many of you in this modern day of
[1:45:44] course when they've got it to where they
[1:45:45] can do the scans and so on on the mother
[1:45:48] I saw one just the other day of somebody
[1:45:49] here in the church at Carol had showed
[1:45:50] it to me little T9 and her mama packing
[1:45:54] it around and his little bitty thumb
[1:45:56] stuck in its
[1:45:57] mouth oh Hallelujah it had moved from
[1:46:01] that embryonic stage where there was no
[1:46:03] image don't you understand even when we
[1:46:05] receive the Holy Ghost and the presence
[1:46:07] of God comes upon us where there in that
[1:46:09] embryonic stage but who was it Christ
[1:46:11] Jesus you understand whenever a real
[1:46:14] child of God receives the Holy Ghost
[1:46:16] even though they may be so weak and so
[1:46:18] immature they've already got the
[1:46:20] potential of the Christ man they've
[1:46:23] already got the potential of the Christ
[1:46:25] man being formed inside of them this is
[1:46:28] wild fridge we pick up we go on we lay
[1:46:31] aside our mistakes we lay aside our
[1:46:37] shortcomings Lord men of God don't give
[1:46:39] up on
[1:46:41] me men of God don't give up on me keep
[1:46:46] travailing keep
[1:46:49] laboring I'm coming I'm on my way
[1:46:53] I may be behind some of you here today
[1:46:56] you may be ahead of me don't give up on
[1:46:58] me don't give up on me keep
[1:47:04] travailing until the image becomes more
[1:47:07] defined and more
[1:47:09] defined till at last the Christian
[1:47:12] reaches the
[1:47:13] stature of a perfect
[1:47:16] man Paul long for these Believers to be
[1:47:20] transformed in the into the Greek word
[1:47:22] that he called
[1:47:25] Moro in Philippians 2:6 it's
[1:47:28] morphe but here it's a different form of
[1:47:32] that he wanted them to be formed that
[1:47:36] Christ would be formed in
[1:47:39] them oh
[1:47:41] Hallelujah let's Stand
[1:47:44] Together can I share another quote with
[1:47:46] you here before we
[1:47:48] close the resurrection in 1953 I believe
[1:47:51] this great commotion
[1:47:53] that's going across the world now that's
[1:47:55] called heresy says the people has lost
[1:47:58] their mind this bunch of
[1:47:59] people that sold out to the world burned
[1:48:02] every bridge behind them serving God
[1:48:03] believing in signs and wonders and
[1:48:05] miracles and the big formal church is
[1:48:07] saying they're crazy I believe it's
[1:48:10] Jesus Christ reincarnated in the human
[1:48:12] church here on Earth doing
[1:48:15] signs and
[1:48:19] wonders every new birth
[1:48:24] not just accepting
[1:48:25] salvation but every new
[1:48:28] birth is a death to that old husband and
[1:48:32] Christ starts being formed in the soul
[1:48:36] of that
[1:48:38] individual their name is
[1:48:41] transferred they're no longer identified
[1:48:44] in living under the old
[1:48:47] book I hope you understand tonight my
[1:48:49] old book as a sinner
[1:48:53] is no longer in
[1:48:58] existence when I make mistakes and fall
[1:49:00] short of the glory of God that is not
[1:49:03] going under my old nature of Donald Lee
[1:49:07] Reagan
[1:49:09] Jr that book no longer
[1:49:14] exist he knows I'm a
[1:49:16] son and when I make a mistake there
[1:49:19] ain't no need writing it down cuz I'm
[1:49:21] going to fix it
[1:49:23] amen why you need to keep a record when
[1:49:26] it comes to a son or daughter of
[1:49:32] God you know what I'm saying don't every
[1:49:35] one of you feel that way as Sons and
[1:49:37] Daughters of God when you the Lord Smite
[1:49:39] your heart to convict you you're going
[1:49:40] to fix it it's
[1:49:42] inevitable you are going to fix it there
[1:49:45] ain't no need rid it
[1:49:49] down again he says if Jesus is risen
[1:49:52] from the dead living among us tonight
[1:49:54] then he's reincarnating himself again in
[1:49:59] his church then he will produce the same
[1:50:03] thing that he did back there so the fact
[1:50:06] is God the new birth will be the Lord
[1:50:09] Jesus reincarnated again in Africa in
[1:50:14] China Japan

[1:53:04] God let's B it
[1:53:14] together thank you Lord
[1:53:18] God all friend
[1:53:22] the prophet says it wasn't so from the
[1:53:24] beginning every man that's has got to be
[1:53:26] born again and the sinful nature killed
[1:53:28] in him and a new man born in
[1:53:31] him which is Christ
[1:53:34] Jesus the son of
[1:53:39] God about your old man patched up
[1:53:41] somehow the new man is not you
[1:53:46] fixed it's not you and I
[1:53:49] repaired it's the son of God
[1:53:55] Lord
[1:53:58] Jesus we humbly bow our heads in your
[1:54:00] presence
[1:54:04] today we are so blessed to hear such
[1:54:09] things much less to have it in our
[1:54:13] possession help us
[1:54:16] father we don't want to just be church
[1:54:18] members Lord and we believe that we
[1:54:20] ought to have a church that we attend
[1:54:21] yes we believe
[1:54:23] that Lord we don't want to just do good
[1:54:26] deeds we believe we should do that
[1:54:29] too Lord
[1:54:31] Jesus we want that old man
[1:54:36] dead
[1:54:39] Hallelujah not hung up for the
[1:54:42] occasion we've seen it down Through the
[1:54:44] Ages that's what's happened to so many
[1:54:46] people they hung that old man up for the
[1:54:49] occasion and they run across something
[1:54:51] they couldn't believe something they
[1:54:53] couldn't understand and they go right
[1:54:56] back to that same old
[1:54:59] husband and they lose their salvation
[1:55:03] the prophet tells the Salvation is like
[1:55:04] healing it will hold as long as your
[1:55:07] faith
[1:55:08] holds but he sure don't teach us that
[1:55:11] when it comes to the Seal of
[1:55:13] God the Seal of God keeps us even when
[1:55:16] we may feel our flesh wavering and
[1:55:20] teetering Hallelujah
[1:55:23] the Seal of god holds us we don't hold
[1:55:26] it
[1:55:28] amen oh
[1:55:30] Jesus come by this way today Lord would
[1:55:34] you would you pass by this way like you
[1:55:38] did in the upper coast of Ephesus that
[1:55:43] day Lord Jesus maybe there's some good
[1:55:46] disciples here in the building today
[1:55:47] maybe some stream in the service and
[1:55:49] they love you they're Christians they
[1:55:52] love
[1:55:53] you maybe they've never
[1:55:55] yet received that new husband that new
[1:55:59] nature they struggle with this and that
[1:56:02] and the other and they try and they fall
[1:56:03] short and they get up and they struggle
[1:56:05] and they go back and forth back and
[1:56:07] forth May today be the day Lord
[1:56:11] God that the Holy Ghost will sweep in
[1:56:13] this
[1:56:15] building we know when it happened there
[1:56:17] in the upper coast of
[1:56:19] Ephesus there wasn't hundreds of people
[1:56:21] sitting there like there are here today
[1:56:24] but there was
[1:56:26] 12 12
[1:56:28] people and the apostolic way of
[1:56:31] receiving the Holy Ghost was for Paul to
[1:56:33] lay hands on
[1:56:34] them and they got their new marriage
[1:56:38] certificate oh Jesus would you pass this
[1:56:42] way maybe began on this Pulpit if you
[1:56:44] would Lord if there's any brother
[1:56:48] here maybe start here with us and then
[1:56:51] move toward the back
[1:56:54] Lord don't leave the sisters out in the
[1:56:55] nurseries or any brothers that would
[1:56:57] have their children back there
[1:56:59] father don't leave anybody out Lord God
[1:57:02] that would be streaming in France or
[1:57:05] Switzerland or Norway their service is
[1:57:08] already gone and they clicked in to be
[1:57:10] in church with us
[1:57:12] today may Jesus pass through the upper
[1:57:16] coast of
[1:57:18] Norway may Jesus pass to the southern
[1:57:22] coast of
[1:57:24] France may Jesus hallelujah
[1:57:30] hallelujah may you call Lord for that
[1:57:33] last
[1:57:34] name Lord oh Jesus so every one of us
[1:57:38] can be
[1:57:39] filled so filled that every fiber of our
[1:57:42] being can be filled with the presence of

[1:58:09] uncertain with no one looking around you
[1:58:12] just say Brother D I'm just not sure I I
[1:58:14] want to be
[1:58:15] sure but I'm just not sure sometimes I
[1:58:19] think that that old man is dead and then
[1:58:21] other times I think I don't
[1:58:23] know just raise your hand to the Lord
[1:58:25] not so much to
[1:58:26] me just Lord be mindful of me

[1:58:34] the
[1:58:35] Assurance your faith your human faith
[1:58:38] will
[1:58:39] waver failures will test it falling
[1:58:42] short of the glory of God will make you
[1:58:44] question but that seal of the Living
[1:58:48] God it gives you that trust
[1:58:53] and that confidence and that
[1:58:56] assurance that if there ain't but one
[1:58:58] leaving out a Word of Life
[1:59:00] Church you'd look me in the face and say
[1:59:02] brother Donnie you better move somewhere
