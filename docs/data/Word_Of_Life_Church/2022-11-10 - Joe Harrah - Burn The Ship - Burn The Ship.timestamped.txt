[30:07] things at your lower level
[30:09] firstly level
[30:11] and so many times I think we get stuck
[30:13] in that to where we we just we get in a
[30:15] rut
[30:16] and we see things how we perceive
[30:18] instead of seeing them by faith
[30:21] so behold I will do a new thing and now
[30:23] it shall spring forth and shall ye not
[30:25] know it I will even make a way in the
[30:27] wilderness and rivers in the desert
[30:31] let's bow our heads
[30:33] Heavenly Father
[30:35] Lord we've come together another time
[30:37] lord
[30:39] to celebrate you to give you praise
[30:41] to have every mind every heart every
[30:44] soul in here tonight focused on you
[30:46] nothing but you Lord
[30:49] if it was focused on me they're going to
[30:51] hear mistakes they're going to hear me
[30:52] stammer around try to find words try to
[30:55] find things to say
[30:57] Lord if they focus on you
[30:59] I pray they won't hear me Lord
[31:01] get me out of the way father that you
[31:03] can use the gift that you've given
[31:05] as you see fit
[31:07] Lord you've given them a gift of hearing
[31:10] you've given them a gift of receiving
[31:12] Lord and if they would get out of the
[31:14] way and let you use their ears use their
[31:17] hearts
[31:19] and you would have your way Lord from
[31:21] the front to the back
[31:23] everyone will leave blessed
[31:25] Lord your prophets told us you'll either
[31:27] come in
[31:29] but you'll either leave better or worse
[31:31] though or not I trust and believe
[31:33] tonight will all leave better because
[31:35] we've heard your word and we apply it to
[31:37] our lives
[31:38] we thank you for it Lord I pray for
[31:40] brother Daryl you know he's having a
[31:41] time with his back

[31:46] feeling sick Lord I pray you touched
[31:48] them
[31:49] Lord Brother Roberts need their lord his
[31:51] little assembly Lord I pray that you've
[31:52] blessed bless him richly lift him up
[31:55] Lord we want to give you praise for
[31:57] brother Phil and sister Ruth's little
[31:59] baby there Lord for for touching it Lord
[32:01] all the praise goes to you we're so
[32:04] thankful bless the further service in
[32:06] Jesus name amen he's gonna be seated
[32:12] I've titled this tonight
[32:15] might sound weird but I'll tell you how
[32:18] I come to this title my title has burned
[32:20] the ship
[32:23] now I didn't get it from hearing a song
[32:27] I've been thinking a lot lately about
[32:29] people that have left
[32:31] people that have just picked it up and
[32:33] left and walked off
[32:37] so I was thinking about the other day
[32:38] and this thought this kept coming to my
[32:40] mind burned the ship
[32:44] I thought what
[32:46] how does that apply
[32:48] and it just stayed in my mind I'd go to
[32:50] work and it taught this came come into
[32:52] my mind burned the ship
[32:54] so I looked in the scriptures I Googled
[32:56] the scriptures say anything about
[32:58] burning ships nothing
[33:01] so I I went to the table
[33:07] in 1960 brother Branham said hearing
[33:09] receiving and acting
[33:11] therefore their church needs a good
[33:13] cleansing what we need today is some
[33:16] old-fashioned Revival some sweeping
[33:18] revivals some power of the Lord work we
[33:20] need men and women who's willing willing
[33:23] to sell out everything in this world
[33:27] to burn every bridge behind them we need
[33:30] to take the world today we ministers
[33:32] like the old Norwegians used to take a
[33:35] country
[33:37] they went in by ship
[33:39] they hit the shore
[33:42] set the ship of Fire
[33:45] and burned it behind them
[33:48] there was no way of Escape
[33:53] that's the way we ought to do
[33:56] burn every bridge every Escape sell out
[34:00] everything
[34:01] for the kingdom of God
[34:04] and keep moving on there's no place of
[34:06] stopping there's no place of
[34:07] compromising
[34:10] in Luke chapter 9 57-62 Jesus said in
[34:14] the Bible scripture says and it came to
[34:16] pass they went this way in a certain man
[34:18] said unto him Lord I will follow thee
[34:19] wherever thou goest
[34:22] Jesus said unto him foxes have holes and
[34:24] birds have of the air have Nest but the
[34:27] son of man have no nowhere to lay his
[34:29] head and he said unto another this is
[34:31] Jesus saying to another follow me
[34:35] but he said Lord suffer me first to go
[34:37] bury
[34:38] my father
[34:40] and Jesus said unto him let the dead
[34:42] bury the dead but go thou and preach the
[34:44] kingdom of God and another also said
[34:46] Lord I will follow thee
[34:48] but let me first go bid them farewell
[34:50] which are at my house
[34:53] Jesus said unto him no man
[34:56] having put his hand to the plow and
[34:58] looking back as fit for the kingdom of
[35:00] God
[35:02] no man looking back
[35:04] you know we see this throughout the
[35:06] scriptures
[35:08] and Isaiah says remember you're not the
[35:10] former things neither consider the
[35:12] things of old
[35:14] that's what happened to the children of
[35:15] Israel
[35:17] they begin to remember how good it was
[35:19] back there
[35:20] they lost sight of what God was taking
[35:22] them to
[35:23] they lost sight of the promised land
[35:25] they lost sight of the word this was
[35:26] God's word I'll take you into a promised
[35:28] land that flows with milk and honey
[35:29] everywhere you put your feet is your
[35:32] possessions
[35:34] they lost sight of that they did not
[35:35] hang on to the faith that God gave them
[35:37] for that and so they begin to consider
[35:39] the former things
[35:41] to look back to the things of old oh
[35:43] they said we want to we'd love to have
[35:44] the the leaks and the garlics we had in
[35:46] Egypt
[35:47] and here we see the same thing around
[35:49] this message
[35:51] is people
[35:53] going back to where they came from
[35:58] and I wrote down here this message is
[36:00] surrounded by ships that have not been
[36:02] burned
[36:04] ships that haven't been burned
[36:08] because they never dedicated themselves
[36:09] to when they first got here
[36:13] they parked it there when brother
[36:15] Branham healing campaign was going
[36:17] around the world they pulled their ships
[36:19] up to his healing campaign and did not
[36:21] burn them
[36:23] all they wanted to see was the swerks
[36:25] the signs the Wonders that's all they
[36:27] wanted to see
[36:29] and when God presented him with the new
[36:31] land
[36:34] the healings
[36:35] the raising the dead that wasn't the new
[36:37] land God wanted him to go to
[36:40] well he offered him the word this is
[36:42] eternal life
[36:44] what did they do
[36:46] many went back to their ships
[36:48] they pulled up their sails
[36:51] and they sailed away
[36:53] it's still happening today
[36:56] people that parked their ships on this
[36:58] message 40 years ago
[37:01] are leaving
[37:04] pastors
[37:06] that claim to be the voice of God
[37:10] have went back to their ships
[37:13] and they've sailed away
[37:18] I've got a subtitle
[37:19] to this is where has the Zeal gone
[37:24] where's it went
[37:27] we're so used to our traditions
[37:30] we traditionalize Church
[37:33] we've made it a ritual
[37:34] that we come to on Sunday on Wednesday
[37:37] it's part of our schedule we'll write it
[37:40] in our calendar have to go to church you
[37:42] have to
[37:43] [Music]
[37:44] you have to
[37:46] I have to go listen to God is exactly
[37:49] what you're saying
[37:51] you get to
[37:54] you get to go hear the voice of one that
[37:56] loves you more than anything
[38:00] [Applause]
[38:05] we got people that jump their ship they
[38:07] don't agree with the pastor
[38:13] don't raise your hand but how many could
[38:15] say in their heart speak to yourself I
[38:17] have the same Zeal or more that I had
[38:19] when I got here
[38:21] five years ago ten years ago 20 years
[38:24] ago 30 years ago
[38:27] if it's the same you haven't went
[38:29] anywhere
[38:31] you say I have the same Zeal I had 30
[38:34] years ago
[38:35] get away from your ship
[38:38] you haven't burnt your ship yet but
[38:40] you're looking at it
[38:42] you're eyeballing it
[38:45] burn it
[38:47] burn it you've got no nowhere better to
[38:49] go
[38:50] you say this is tough this is hard
[38:55] where did we get this term burn the
[38:57] ships anybody know
[39:00] some of you history Buffs know Cortez
[39:01] right is one of them Cortez was one of
[39:04] them when he came to to Mexico
[39:06] this was a new lamp
[39:10] he wanted to conquer this land
[39:14] nothing was going to stand between him
[39:16] and his mission so what did he tell us
[39:18] his men burn the ships we're not going
[39:20] back
[39:21] nothing's going to stop us
[39:24] history say that when Caesar tried to
[39:26] take go up around into Ireland Scotland
[39:29] and then in places
[39:30] that when you come around the north
[39:32] scene he looked at the Cliffs of Dover
[39:33] or whatever Cliffs they were and all the
[39:35] the the Celts that were lining The
[39:38] Cliffs looking at him was way more than
[39:40] the many had
[39:43] that he could have turned his ships
[39:45] around
[39:46] grab the tiller and turn him around and
[39:48] hit it back the other way
[39:50] but he told the man we're going up we're
[39:51] gonna
[39:52] anchor these ships and we're going to
[39:54] burn them
[39:56] Alexander when he takes Persia he tells
[39:58] his men burn the ships
[40:02] that is a commission that you've had in
[40:04] this day burn your ship
[40:06] you've raised your hand and said this is
[40:09] where I want to be this is where God
[40:11] brought me this is where my ship has
[40:13] landed your ship has been through so
[40:14] many things
[40:15] some of you have been through the shifts
[40:17] of denomination and and the waves and
[40:19] the way you've you've come through so
[40:21] many different Waters
[40:23] you've come through through ministers
[40:25] that want to make a name for themselves
[40:27] they want want their own following
[40:29] you've been through all that
[40:32] and then one night when you're you're
[40:34] shipped it's just drifting along and you
[40:36] think there's no help there's nowhere
[40:37] else to go you heard a steal small voice
[40:40] and you looked and far off the distance
[40:41] you see no lighthouse
[40:44] and you set yourself for that
[40:47] you turned your your the tiller and the
[40:49] rudder to set your your ship straight
[40:51] for that and you headed for that
[40:55] it wasn't easy getting here for some of
[40:57] you
[40:58] you know like I told uh where I preached
[41:01] Senate brother Homer's here a month or
[41:03] so ago
[41:05] you know I could look at people that
[41:07] have been through so much they've come
[41:09] through denominate I was born in it
[41:13] you say what kind of testimony do you
[41:15] have
[41:19] I don't have the testimony that
[41:20] somebody's been through so many things
[41:23] almost died of drug overdoses and almost
[41:26] getting killed here and and things
[41:28] happening here can be caught up in a
[41:30] cult here I don't have that testimony
[41:33] but I have a testimony of Grace that God
[41:36] kept me from that
[41:38] God seemed fit to drop me into place me
[41:41] in a family that was already brought
[41:42] into this message I don't know I don't
[41:44] have a less of a testimony than you
[41:46] you don't have a lesser greater
[41:48] testimony than me
[41:50] every one of it's a testimony of God's
[41:52] grace
[41:59] but it seems like there's no Zeal
[42:01] anymore
[42:02] people want to be petted and rocked
[42:04] father minister
[42:06] their Pastor come in and feed me prop my
[42:09] feet up
[42:10] rock me to sleep hey I can put it I can
[42:13] put you to sleep
[42:14] I've put a bunch of them y'all I can see
[42:17] more faces up here than you can
[42:19] I know when you're sleeping hey I slept
[42:21] on brother Daryl woke me up in Alabama
[42:22] one time
[42:23] he's in youth service
[42:26] well he's up all night wasn't we Joel
[42:31] we were up all night and I was tired
[42:34] I wasn't saying brother Daryl was boring
[42:36] me I was just tired
[42:38] I closed my eyes the next thing I heard
[42:40] was ain't that right brother Joe
[42:44] hey
[42:45] I didn't go back to sleep
[42:48] I don't know what he said but I agreed
[42:49] with him
[42:51] so we look at that and we've become
[42:54] we've traditionalized it's a ritual now
[42:57] we've got it in our mind how service is
[42:59] supposed to go
[43:01] we know how you know and I want I
[43:03] thought somebody why don't why don't you
[43:05] write down what how you think service
[43:07] should go and give it to Brother Louie
[43:08] give it to brother Joel and him tell him
[43:10] hey do service this way
[43:12] this is where it's supposed to go
[43:14] these are the people that I want singing
[43:16] This is how long I want the minister
[43:18] preaching
[43:19] people know how long ministers are
[43:21] supposed to preach
[43:23] people that ain't preachers know how
[43:25] long a preacher's supposed to preach
[43:31] here's the way I look at it
[43:33] and I'm probably different than
[43:34] everybody else because they always stole
[43:36] the quote the brother Brandon said 30 45
[43:37] minutes and y'all know me
[43:40] I think I in North Carolina I think I
[43:42] preached an hour and seven minutes I
[43:44] think that's a record
[43:45] that's a record and I apologized
[43:50] but you look at it
[43:51] as
[43:53] brother they throw that clothes brother
[43:54] Brandon said a Minister's supposed to
[43:56] preach 30 to 45 minutes
[43:59] you're saying this is Manna From Heaven
[44:01] Are you full
[44:03] have you had enough
[44:06] have you ate too much
[44:09] rituals traditions
[44:13] you get mad if somebody beside you is
[44:15] shouting too loud praising God too loud
[44:19] I've got some news for you there's no
[44:21] Xanax in heaven
[44:23] because if that bothers you you're going
[44:25] to have a Time
[44:32] but where is our desire gone your heart
[44:35] was setting running this race at all
[44:37] cost
[44:38] you pulled your ship ashore God LED you
[44:40] here you gave testimonies of how God
[44:42] pulled you out of whatever you was in
[44:44] pulled you here and you're praising God
[44:46] for it and as time goes on
[44:48] if you don't ever talk about it no more
[44:50] you move from the front row to the back
[44:52] row
[44:55] where's this deal
[45:00] I'm not saying whether you burnt your
[45:01] ship or not but I'm just asking you have
[45:03] you
[45:05] have you burned it
[45:07] or have you left it there
[45:11] if you're a predestinated son and
[45:13] daughter of God
[45:14] there's burnt holes laying all around
[45:16] this message
[45:17] you've burned it you left it on the
[45:19] shore you've anchored it you said I'll
[45:20] never go back I don't care what tests
[45:22] come my way I don't care what Trials
[45:24] come my way I don't care what Satan puts
[45:26] against me where are you going to go to
[45:29] where are you gonna go
[45:31] you got something better than this
[45:34] it's it's hard it's narrow right the
[45:36] Bible says narrow is the way
[45:38] Merrell
[45:42] don't even consider what you left behind
[45:45] don't even consider the mistakes that
[45:47] you've made
[45:49] all that stuff you carried on your ship
[45:51] you should have burned it with it
[45:54] don't grab all that luggage off before
[45:55] you set fire to your ship and carry it
[45:58] with your Shore
[45:59] all your faults your mistakes things
[46:01] that you regret
[46:03] burn your regrets burn your mistakes
[46:05] don't don't bring them ashore with you
[46:07] there's no room in God's word for your
[46:10] mistakes
[46:11] there's no room for your regrets there's
[46:13] no room for all your faults and your
[46:15] failures
[46:16] God don't see them
[46:18] so quit trying to shove them through the
[46:20] blood
[46:21] that's what we do we try to shove them
[46:23] through the blood
[46:24] look what I did God said I forgive you
[46:26] but look what I did I forgave you but
[46:28] God remember when I did this back here
[46:30] and we force it and we force it and we
[46:32] try to force it through the blood of
[46:33] Jesus Christ and we make calference not
[46:35] a fact
[46:37] we're looking at yourself and look at
[46:40] God's grace
[46:43] [Applause]
[46:52] when Jesus went to the 70.
[46:56] when you see the son of man ascending
[46:58] into heaven from whence he came
[47:00] what did they say
[47:02] this guy is saying he came from heaven
[47:05] he came from heaven
[47:07] and the Bible says that they turned away
[47:09] and walked with him no more
[47:12] he he called him did he not come follow
[47:14] me come follow me
[47:16] that's what we're reading in Luke he was
[47:18] saying hey follow me hey I need to go do
[47:20] this first hey you come follow me I
[47:22] need to do this first so they maybe they
[47:24] went and done it I don't know
[47:26] maybe they went and done it but then
[47:28] they eventually followed him
[47:29] and you gotta the same thing that
[47:31] happened in in the prophet's message
[47:33] they followed him
[47:35] they followed him these 70 followed him
[47:37] when he was racing to death
[47:39] they followed him when he was turning
[47:41] the water into wine
[47:42] we got to follow this guy
[47:45] watch what he does we want to be part of
[47:47] that
[47:48] all these ministers wanted to surround
[47:49] themselves to brother Brandon we want to
[47:51] be part of that
[47:52] and then Jesus says
[47:55] when you see him ascending to Heaven
[47:56] from whence I came
[47:58] what's he talking about who does he
[48:00] think he is
[48:02] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[48:04] blood
[48:06] well in the world is he talking about
[48:08] we're leaving on this guy's crazy I'm
[48:10] getting out of here
[48:12] and the brother Brandon brought serpent
[48:14] seat
[48:15] right
[48:16] the godhead
[48:18] predestination
[48:20] they jumped on their ships
[48:22] we didn't want that
[48:24] they left
[48:26] he brought the new land that God had
[48:28] given the milk and honey God says okay
[48:30] now you give him the milk and honey
[48:33] it don't look like it does it
[48:35] When the Children is or was going into
[48:37] into the land of Canaan God said this is
[48:39] the land that flows with milk and honey
[48:40] and it's all yours and everywhere they
[48:42] looked as Giants where's the milk and
[48:44] honey
[48:46] it's faith
[48:47] it's Faith that's how your walk is when
[48:50] you go to work
[48:51] when you go to work and you see the word
[48:53] things that work don't quit trying to
[48:54] fit in
[48:55] quit trying to fit in
[48:58] you parked your little ship on the edge
[49:00] of this message and you want to try to
[49:01] just toe the line let's walk along the
[49:04] shoreline
[49:05] so you'll feel like I want to be
[49:06] accepted that's the problem with people
[49:08] today they want to be accepted I want
[49:11] God to accept me that's all that matters
[49:13] and you've got people that want to be
[49:15] accepted they want to toe the line
[49:18] we want to see how close they can to
[49:20] theirs
[49:21] oh yeah they'll wither they'll wear
[49:23] their skirts and and what have you to
[49:24] work but they might put a little color
[49:26] on their fingers
[49:28] on their mouth
[49:30] right
[49:31] wear the little clip-on earrings
[49:34] right how close you getting to the edge
[49:39] you cannot fight on the shoreline
[49:42] the enemies in the land
[49:44] you're not fighting you're trying to fit
[49:46] in
[49:47] so while you're standing there get you a
[49:49] torch torch your ship
[49:52] in all its baggage and go fight
[49:55] that's all that's all he's called us to
[49:57] do so brother Brandon says in 64 when
[49:59] their eyes was open they knew him he
[50:00] turned around he had 70 with him he said
[50:03] to that 70s what will you say when you
[50:06] see the son of man ascending from heaven
[50:07] from which he came he asked him a
[50:08] question
[50:09] what will you say
[50:11] they looked at one another and said well
[50:13] the son of man is sending up from where
[50:15] he came from they asked this question
[50:18] we know his mother we know his brothers
[50:20] his sisters we see the the manger he was
[50:23] Lady when he was born we've seen the
[50:25] Cradle he was rocked in
[50:28] he come from Nazareth
[50:30] this is a hard saying and they didn't
[50:31] walk with him no more
[50:33] and all the time these disciples stood
[50:35] right there they didn't know it
[50:37] but they believed it they didn't explain
[50:38] it they couldn't explain it he never
[50:40] explained it
[50:42] he didn't explain now listen guys this
[50:44] is what I meant
[50:45] you got to read between the lines
[50:49] how long how many times we heard that
[50:50] you got to read between the lines that's
[50:51] how people get their own interpretation
[50:53] of the word oh I read between the lines
[50:58] this is where Peter made his memorial
[51:00] words Lord
[51:01] are we persuaded that you have the word
[51:03] we are persuaded that you have the word
[51:05] of eternal life alone
[51:07] where would we go
[51:09] Peter said God lord we've burned our
[51:11] ship
[51:12] we burn it
[51:14] we got nowhere to go we can't go back if
[51:16] we did want to go back how would we get
[51:18] there we've burnt our only
[51:19] transportation
[51:21] you think Satan's not going to tempt you
[51:23] to go back
[51:25] why can you not go back
[51:27] how can you not go back you have no
[51:29] means of transportation
[51:31] you've burned it
[51:33] he can tempts you with it all you want
[51:36] but you've got no way back
[51:39] we're not without temptation
[51:41] Sons and Daughters God is the ones he is
[51:43] going to attempt vim's the ones he is
[51:45] going to try to say hey look remember
[51:47] remember how you had it back here
[51:49] remember when you went to this church
[51:51] over here how easy it was
[51:53] preacher didn't preach on you that much
[51:56] preacher preached on how God loved you
[51:57] all the time and never told you right or
[52:00] wrong
[52:01] look how easy you had it
[52:03] why don't you go back to that you can
[52:06] look him straight now and say I ain't
[52:07] got no way back
[52:09] I've got no way back
[52:16] Peter says I've destroyed my means
[52:20] of church hopping
[52:25] people got him a little dingy
[52:28] they found him a dinghy somewhere
[52:30] when they rode from one Church to
[52:31] another
[52:32] One Pastor to another
[52:35] pastor says something they don't like
[52:37] they jump in that dinghy and here they
[52:39] go
[52:42] they don't know who the pastor is
[52:45] they don't they they got they have not
[52:47] established any foundation
[52:49] they don't know how to live by faith
[52:52] they don't live by faith
[52:54] if you live by faith you can say I don't
[52:56] understand it but I'm going forward
[52:59] I don't know what tomorrow holds but I'm
[53:01] going forward I don't know about all
[53:03] these Warriors standing on these Cliffs
[53:04] but I'm burning my ship and I'm going
[53:06] ashore
[53:07] foreign
[53:11] Bible says the holy spirit will lead you
[53:13] into all truth
[53:14] didn't say you would look on it with
[53:16] your eyes and read it and you don't have
[53:17] an understanding
[53:18] holy spirit will lead you into all truth
[53:21] that's why we've had so many people left
[53:23] because they're reading the word oh he
[53:24] contradicted himself right here hey
[53:26] Connor ditches this never happened if
[53:28] you read right here he said all these 16
[53:30] men died and you you can search and
[53:33] they're reading with their own
[53:34] understanding
[53:36] they're looking at things that do not
[53:38] lie upon their Eternal destination
[53:41] whether 16 men
[53:43] were buried in a bridge or not or fell
[53:47] off
[53:48] it's got nothing to do with where I'm
[53:49] going
[53:50] not a thing
[53:52] not a thing
[53:54] [Applause]
[53:58] but people do what they can to avoid
[54:00] persecution
[54:02] trials
[54:03] look at Jonah
[54:06] Jonah Jonah needed a come to meeting
[54:09] with Jesus right
[54:12] Jonah got on a ship
[54:14] he got on the ship
[54:16] it wasn't the ship God made for him
[54:19] so what happened what what the problem
[54:21] with Jonah was he had to have a burial
[54:23] and Resurrection
[54:25] Jonah came up a new man
[54:27] he had to be buried for three days
[54:30] he had to be resurrected on the shore
[54:33] God said this is where I told you to go
[54:36] what happened to Jonah's means of
[54:37] transportation
[54:40] it went back to the Bottom of the Sea
[54:43] he had no way back
[54:47] he had to have a burial
[54:49] at a resurrection
[54:52] that's what we got to have
[54:54] you have to have that new life
[54:56] something gave Jonah a life that he
[54:59] never had
[55:01] he didn't have he didn't have he didn't
[55:03] have that burden for lost souls like we
[55:05] think he's a prophet
[55:06] there's a whole book about him
[55:09] but he didn't have a burden for lost
[55:10] souls
[55:12] he did not have a burden to go save
[55:14] people and that's what he was called to
[55:16] do
[55:18] okay
[55:22] I'm gonna hurry through here because
[55:26] the older I get the bigger these fonts
[55:28] get and more pages I get
[55:30] so it won't be long I'll have one word
[55:32] per page
[55:36] but Brandon said straight is the gate
[55:39] lot didn't think he was going to
[55:41] backslide
[55:42] he went looking towards Sodom where
[55:45] things were easy
[55:47] there's many times we look towards the
[55:48] easy way
[55:50] we all do it I don't care if you have
[55:52] the Holy Ghost or not we like the easy
[55:54] way that does not de-christianize you
[55:56] that does not say you're not saved
[55:59] but long as we're stuck with this
[56:01] Humanity we want it easy I do yeah yeah
[56:04] I do I want it easy
[56:07] but if it ain't Lord give me strength
[56:11] sometimes that's what gets me on my
[56:12] knees quicker than anything when it's
[56:14] going hard
[56:18] there's many times we look towards the
[56:20] easy way I'll join this certain certain
[56:22] Church you see nobody will say anything
[56:23] against it because it's the biggest
[56:24] church in the city
[56:26] the easy way many times we do that when
[56:29] we're wrong
[56:31] remember if you follow Christ you'll be
[56:33] hated by people for all that live Godly
[56:35] in Christ Jesus will suffer persecutions
[56:38] that's what we don't want
[56:41] the only thing about pain that I don't
[56:43] like is that it hurts
[56:45] other than that I've got no problem with
[56:47] it
[56:48] I've got zero problems with it
[56:50] I just don't like it when it hurts
[56:53] that's our problem
[56:55] we got no problem with pain God bring
[56:57] the pain just don't make it hurt
[57:00] we want it easy
[57:03] brother Brown said so many times we want
[57:04] a bed of ease we want to go through life
[57:05] on a bed of ease a bed of roses and
[57:08] sometimes if
[57:09] if that's the way you feel go listen to
[57:11] it it goes to Earth or Nest again
[57:14] it talks about that mother Eagle taking
[57:15] that rabbit fur out
[57:18] it's gonna expose those Thorns to that
[57:20] youngin
[57:21] make him get out
[57:23] make him sore on the on the Wind
[57:26] you'll come by the blood that's the only
[57:28] Avenue that's the only Avenue we're in
[57:31] and you cannot bring no one with you
[57:32] you'll come alone and stand on your own
[57:34] confession and your own faith you'll not
[57:36] ride in on the pastor on your mother's
[57:39] faith you'll come as an individual when
[57:41] you come to God and many times we make
[57:43] those foolish choices
[57:47] I've made a lot of them
[57:49] I made a lot of them I've regretted
[57:51] I made a lot of them that come back
[57:53] later
[57:55] and bit me
[57:58] and I think why in the world that
[57:59] happened and then God quickened to this
[58:01] is why it happened but you did this
[58:05] hey you know we can play this Grace game
[58:08] all we want
[58:10] you can play Grace all you want
[58:12] when you look at the way God deals in
[58:14] Grace
[58:15] he said he who he loveth he chastened he
[58:18] chastens
[58:20] that that you parents
[58:23] you love your kids right I love them so
[58:25] much I'm not going to spank them
[58:27] I love them so much I'm not going to
[58:28] correct them
[58:29] are they ever going to learn anything
[58:32] you're going to make spoiled brats out
[58:33] of them
[58:34] and that's what we become sometimes
[58:36] because we don't take his correction
[58:37] wood becomes full of brats and the more
[58:40] spoiled become the more easy we want it
[58:43] and then guess what we get tossed off
[58:45] the ship yeah
[58:49] I've been tossed off a time or two
[58:50] Philippians 3 13.
[58:53] brother I count not myself to to have
[58:55] apprehended but this one thing I do
[58:57] forgetting those things which are behind
[58:59] Paul says I'm forgetting that
[59:01] Reaching Forward to the things that were
[59:03] before I pressed toward the mark for the
[59:05] prize of the High Calling of God in
[59:07] Christ Jesus look at everything that
[59:10] Paul wanted to forget
[59:12] do you have anything in your life on
[59:15] that level
[59:18] if God forgave Paul for murdering
[59:22] Christians
[59:24] and made him Apostle made him a prophet
[59:29] of that age the first
[59:31] Church age messenger
[59:35] where do your sins lay
[59:38] have you done any worse than that
[59:41] God can't you think God still sees yours
[59:46] maybe that's why we no longer have the
[59:48] Zeal but because we still have these
[59:50] things on our mind
[59:52] because we're still thinking of our past
[59:54] we're still thinking of regrets in our
[59:56] life I wish I'd have done this I wish
[59:57] I'd have done that we have these things
[59:59] in our life
[1:00:01] we no longer have the Zeal because we're
[1:00:03] consumed
[1:00:04] by everything Satan gets you focusing on
[1:00:06] if you're focused on that that's Satan
[1:00:09] I think the last the last time I
[1:00:11] preached here at the church I was
[1:00:13] talking about that God said there's uh
[1:00:15] brother Branson there's two forces that
[1:00:16] work it's either God or Satan it's not
[1:00:18] it's not you God and Satan
[1:00:20] if God does not torment
[1:00:23] God does not torment
[1:00:25] so if you've got things that just keep
[1:00:27] tormenting your mind
[1:00:29] that are bothering you mistakes you've
[1:00:31] made and you can't get rid of them
[1:00:32] that's not God
[1:00:35] that's not God
[1:00:37] because God will not torment you
[1:00:40] now God will put something on your
[1:00:42] conscience that will bother you till you
[1:00:43] make it right
[1:00:45] but he won't torment you
[1:00:46] he'll tell you through the word
[1:00:50] that's what the word's for right what is
[1:00:52] this the House of Correction
[1:00:54] so if we if we can get these things
[1:00:55] that's burning us down get them off
[1:00:58] if we can come in here and lay them off
[1:01:01] and keep them off
[1:01:03] and then we go out in our work day
[1:01:07] hopefully somehow some way
[1:01:11] God can rekindle that Zeal in our life
[1:01:15] do you still have the same Joy when you
[1:01:17] come to church
[1:01:19] when you come sit around the word is
[1:01:21] when you get ready in Sunday morning and
[1:01:23] you get up
[1:01:25] the alarm goes off
[1:01:28] you're drinking your coffee and your
[1:01:30] mind are you thinking I can't wait
[1:01:34] I can't wait
[1:01:37] I can't wait to get there
[1:01:39] I can't wait to see so and so
[1:01:43] but now we sneeze wrong we finned one
[1:01:46] another
[1:01:47] the one that you call Brother the one
[1:01:49] that you call sister and it don't take
[1:01:51] nothing to offend you
[1:01:55] where's your Zeal for love for one
[1:01:57] another
[1:02:00] we we drive off in the car saying yeah
[1:02:02] so and so wouldn't even talk to me today
[1:02:04] blah blah blah run each other down
[1:02:08] and you claim you're going to spend
[1:02:10] eternity with them
[1:02:12] and they with you
[1:02:15] if you have the real Zeal of God for
[1:02:18] this word in your heart
[1:02:21] if it's true and it's from God
[1:02:24] nothing nothing that Satan puts in your
[1:02:26] life will hinder it nothing
[1:02:29] so I urge you tonight
[1:02:32] that something somehow the Zeal that you
[1:02:35] once had
[1:02:37] maybe this ain't for anybody here
[1:02:39] maybe your Zeal has grown maybe it's for
[1:02:42] somebody streaming
[1:02:43] it's for me
[1:02:45] it's for me
[1:02:47] I'm to blame
[1:02:49] I fell short
[1:02:52] there's times I don't want to come
[1:02:55] there's times that I look at my failures
[1:02:57] there's times I look at my mistakes and
[1:02:59] think why didn't I burn this on the ship
[1:03:01] I know I've burnt my ship
[1:03:04] I know I've burned it
[1:03:06] but guess what I did I pulled some
[1:03:07] baggage off
[1:03:08] thought I might need it
[1:03:12] talk you've all done it
[1:03:15] we've all done it you've pulled the
[1:03:16] baggage off the ship with you
[1:03:20] you know you'll never leave this new
[1:03:22] land
[1:03:23] that is the word right
[1:03:25] You'll Never Leave It
[1:03:28] you've purposed in your heart I'm going
[1:03:29] to fight the fight
[1:03:33] but somehow
[1:03:34] some way a little bit of package got off
[1:03:36] the ship with you
[1:03:38] we forgot to burn it
[1:03:40] burn it now
[1:03:42] you still had the fire burn it now
[1:03:45] don't take it home with you
[1:03:48] say you'll just you walk out here with
[1:03:50] it Satan will use it against you
[1:03:53] you don't have to carry it with you
[1:03:58] there's many soldiers that went on
[1:04:00] before
[1:04:02] Isaac Watts wrote a song called am I a
[1:04:04] soldier of the Cross many years ago
[1:04:06] brother Brandon has mentioned it one of
[1:04:08] the verses says my side be carried to
[1:04:09] the skies
[1:04:11] on a flowery bed of ease
[1:04:13] While others fought to win the prize
[1:04:16] and sailed through bloody seeds
[1:04:19] I don't want nobody to do my fighting
[1:04:21] for me
[1:04:23] hey there's there's times we got to pray
[1:04:25] for one another
[1:04:27] yeah it's like I told Brother Homer's
[1:04:28] Church we're a bunch of white blood
[1:04:29] cells
[1:04:31] my wife's whole family they're all
[1:04:32] nurses except for Phil he wouldn't know
[1:04:34] what to do
[1:04:35] if anything happened anyways
[1:04:38] but white blood cells
[1:04:40] they're the Warriors in your body right
[1:04:43] we're white blood cells the Bride is a
[1:04:46] body
[1:04:47] sometimes I need you to fight for me
[1:04:50] sometimes I need you to help me burn the
[1:04:53] things in my life that I took off the
[1:04:54] ship
[1:04:56] you know we we see people that grieve
[1:04:58] going through battles they've lost a
[1:05:00] loved one they've got things happening
[1:05:03] in their life they don't know what to do
[1:05:05] we don't we don't let them bear that
[1:05:07] alone why do you we think we turn in
[1:05:09] prayer requests up here
[1:05:13] why we're presenting the need before the
[1:05:15] army of God
[1:05:16] and saying I need you to help me fight
[1:05:21] in the testimonies that come come back
[1:05:23] up here praise reports what armies do
[1:05:26] after victory
[1:05:27] they praise they worship they Shout
[1:05:31] because Satan's been defeated
[1:05:36] so we're I don't want nobody fighting
[1:05:38] for me when I can fight
[1:05:42] I want you to fight with me
[1:05:44] I want to fight with you
[1:05:46] but you can't fight my battle
[1:05:48] I can't fight yours
[1:05:50] but we can fight them all together
[1:05:53] we can burn the ships together
[1:05:58] as we look at the times that we we go
[1:06:01] through and
[1:06:03] we'll get on different ships in our life
[1:06:07] sister Erica is on a ship of cancer
[1:06:08] right now
[1:06:12] she can't sell that ship on her own
[1:06:15] we can help her burn it yeah
[1:06:18] we help her burn it
[1:06:19] there's a harbor of healing
[1:06:22] there's many times during Rough Waters
[1:06:25] these captains will pull their sails
[1:06:27] down they would tie their Rudder off
[1:06:29] they would point it in a certain
[1:06:30] direction and they would tie that tiller
[1:06:32] off
[1:06:36] you point your ship
[1:06:37] to your Harbor of Deliverance whatever
[1:06:39] it is in your need in your life
[1:06:42] young people whatever you're dealing
[1:06:43] with
[1:06:44] you point it to the harbor of
[1:06:45] Deliverance in your life and you tie the
[1:06:47] rudder off
[1:06:48] Don't Pull It One Direction in the other
[1:06:50] direction you point it towards your
[1:06:52] healing you point it towards your
[1:06:54] deliverance amen if you've got to row
[1:06:56] that ship then you row it
[1:06:59] don't say well there's no wind I'm going
[1:07:01] to sit here and wait till wind comes
[1:07:02] around get to rowing
[1:07:04] give me an ore I'm going to move this
[1:07:07] ship I'm not going to sit I'm going to
[1:07:08] get as close to the harbor as I can and
[1:07:10] if I can jump off and burn it I will
[1:07:13] you look at all the weapons that Satan's
[1:07:15] put against us
[1:07:17] your little ship is being tossed from
[1:07:19] wave after wave
[1:07:22] what does the scripture says say about
[1:07:24] the weapons that's been formed against
[1:07:25] us
[1:07:27] they've been formed against you
[1:07:30] but they will not prosper
[1:07:32] [Applause]
[1:07:33] it don't matter they can form all the
[1:07:35] weapons that he wants he can form them
[1:07:37] all he wants
[1:07:39] he can form a million weapons against
[1:07:41] his bride not one single will prosper
[1:07:43] because that's what God Said
[1:07:45] they won't Prosper so we get to to
[1:07:48] watching Satan forming these weapons and
[1:07:49] we get we get terrified and we get
[1:07:52] afraid and we lose faith and we start to
[1:07:55] doubt because we're watching the weapon
[1:07:56] be informed
[1:07:58] we're not even seeing it being used
[1:08:00] we're seeing it being formed
[1:08:03] it'll never Prosper why because God said
[1:08:06] so
[1:08:08] it's faith
[1:08:09] that ain't nothing to read between the
[1:08:11] lines with that
[1:08:12] it's by faith
[1:08:15] it'll never prosper
[1:08:23] no as I was studying this the other day
[1:08:25] I got to looking
[1:08:28] read through the fox's book of Martyrs
[1:08:30] how many has ever read Fox's book of
[1:08:32] Martyrs
[1:08:35] you thought you had fights
[1:08:38] you thought you had it rough
[1:08:43] I've read it before and I know how many
[1:08:45] times I had to close it
[1:08:47] and feel ashamed
[1:08:49] just feel the shame feel dirty
[1:08:51] that I complained about this and I
[1:08:53] complaining about that
[1:08:56] you're watching brothers and sisters
[1:08:59] during the Insurrection and stuff they
[1:09:01] would they would come to him are you a
[1:09:02] Christian yes I am
[1:09:05] that would give them chances to recant
[1:09:07] now some of them we know as we agree
[1:09:09] they took them to the stake and they
[1:09:11] burned him alive
[1:09:12] many of them they tortured before they
[1:09:14] ever did that
[1:09:16] they took them to the state they burned
[1:09:18] a lot they put them on a torture rack
[1:09:23] I was reading this one
[1:09:26] I thought a young about our young people
[1:09:27] when I read this
[1:09:31] there was a man named nickus
[1:09:35] they put him on a torture rack he
[1:09:37] because he professed he was a Christian
[1:09:46] and as they begin to torture him he
[1:09:48] recanted
[1:09:51] he said okay I recant
[1:09:54] I've denounced my Christianity
[1:09:58] and true to the word they took him off
[1:09:59] the rack and as soon as they took him
[1:10:01] off he died
[1:10:04] he died
[1:10:06] there was a 16 year old girl named
[1:10:07] Denisa
[1:10:09] somebody's ever read the story of Denisa
[1:10:13] she's standing in the audience watching
[1:10:17] she said you miserable rich
[1:10:20] traded one moment of ease
[1:10:23] for eternity of Torment
[1:10:27] and they heard her
[1:10:31] they said are you a Christian
[1:10:34] you know what she said
[1:10:35] yes I am
[1:10:39] we've got young people right here
[1:10:42] that I I'll just take my life for
[1:10:45] would do the very same thing
[1:10:48] she knew what was coming
[1:10:50] she said I've burnt my ship you can do
[1:10:52] whatever you want to me
[1:10:56] two other Riders have recounted this
[1:10:58] story of Denisa one was written in 1727.
[1:11:06] the people doing the torture they gave
[1:11:07] her to two young men
[1:11:09] said take her
[1:11:12] do whatever you want with her
[1:11:15] ravish her do everything you can
[1:11:19] so these two men they took Denise at 16
[1:11:21] years old
[1:11:23] into a house
[1:11:25] for hours
[1:11:27] they tried to have their way with her
[1:11:28] could never succeed she fought him for
[1:11:31] hours
[1:11:33] they said when Denisa finally passed out
[1:11:36] could no longer go on
[1:11:38] they tried
[1:11:40] in a man clothed in white walked into
[1:11:42] the room
[1:11:45] those two men gave their life to Christ
[1:11:48] they were stoned to death
[1:11:53] and it's hard for us to get up and go to
[1:11:55] church
[1:11:58] if you were there
[1:12:01] could you match your Zeal with theirs
[1:12:06] if that was you
[1:12:07] could you say I could do that
[1:12:12] you have no idea because you've never
[1:12:13] been put in that situation
[1:12:16] but understand this
[1:12:18] the same God then is the same God today
[1:12:22] he hasn't changed
[1:12:24] but their Zeal was so great this is a 16
[1:12:27] year old girl which she seen that
[1:12:30] he had gave in to torture
[1:12:33] and she was overcome
[1:12:35] you wanted just a minute
[1:12:38] of ease from your torture and you traded
[1:12:40] it for hell
[1:12:44] read if you go read the thoughts of The
[1:12:47] Book Of Martyrs
[1:12:51] there's many men that recanted that
[1:12:54] minutes later hours later days later
[1:12:57] unrecated
[1:12:58] shows God's grace
[1:13:00] they come back and said I didn't mean
[1:13:02] what I said
[1:13:04] do what do what to you to me what you
[1:13:06] want
[1:13:08] I just forgot to burn my ship I had to
[1:13:10] go back and burn it
[1:13:12] I left it in the shore
[1:13:16] where's your sitting at
[1:13:18] can you look at your ship right now can
[1:13:21] you see a pile of Ashes
[1:13:23] or do you see these big old luxurious
[1:13:25] Clipper ship
[1:13:27] that you're going to sell back to where
[1:13:28] you come from
[1:13:33] what's your desire
[1:13:35] where's your zeal
[1:13:38] where's your hunger
[1:13:42] does it move you when you see so saved
[1:13:45] does it hurt you when you see him leave
[1:13:50] that's the True Heart of God
[1:13:53] 's heart is not stale
[1:13:56] you think God the Bible says that God
[1:13:59] would that all men be saved
[1:14:01] and when people come to this message and
[1:14:03] leave you think God thinks so well they
[1:14:04] weren't predestinated anyway
[1:14:08] go read the Rich Young Ruler one more
[1:14:10] time
[1:14:11] Jesus for knowledgeable for the
[1:14:13] foundation of the world knew that
[1:14:15] Richard was going to turn him down knew
[1:14:17] it the Bible says then he looked at him
[1:14:19] and he loved him and said come follow me
[1:14:22] he offered him anyway
[1:14:25] he liked his ship too much
[1:14:28] he likes selling too much
[1:14:31] there was no way he was going to burn it
[1:14:34] he said sell all you have
[1:14:36] come follow me
[1:14:39] as I was studying this and I don't like
[1:14:41] putting people on the spot I gotta hurry
[1:14:45] but if you ever get a chance
[1:14:48] if you could buy this young man a cup of
[1:14:50] coffee
[1:14:51] I urge every one of you go talk about
[1:14:53] the table Shockley
[1:14:57] or where his ship's been
[1:15:02] but the Taylor finally found a Shore to
[1:15:04] burn his shiple
[1:15:06] all right brother Taylor
[1:15:11] you finally find the shore
[1:15:16] because we get pulled through so many
[1:15:18] things
[1:15:19] the devil tells us this is right
[1:15:21] that's right different things in her
[1:15:23] life this is right
[1:15:26] and it never matches up down here
[1:15:29] it never matches up with that soul
[1:15:32] you've landed on many many Shores you've
[1:15:35] probably landed on many islands you've
[1:15:36] been in different places in your life
[1:15:38] and something down here just didn't
[1:15:39] settle right there was no peace
[1:15:42] there was no light there was no still
[1:15:43] Small Voice that said this is it
[1:15:48] but God rich in Mercy
[1:15:52] no matter what your past mistakes were
[1:15:55] how you failed
[1:15:57] how you've done this you've done that
[1:16:00] he loved you anyway
[1:16:03] all right
[1:16:05] you know when I I look at those
[1:16:11] great generals back then
[1:16:15] that knew what it was to conquer a land
[1:16:19] they knew what it was
[1:16:21] to set their foot on a new land and say
[1:16:23] this is where I'm staying
[1:16:26] I'm going to conquer this
[1:16:28] it ain't going to be easy
[1:16:31] you think what do you think God
[1:16:33] what if if God had told the children
[1:16:35] miserable before they ever left Egypt
[1:16:37] it's going to be hard you're going to be
[1:16:39] fighting giants
[1:16:40] you're going to be fighting this you're
[1:16:41] going to be doing this you're going to
[1:16:42] be wandering around for 40 years I
[1:16:44] wonder how many would actually went
[1:16:47] how many would said
[1:16:49] no I'm good
[1:16:50] I like making bricks with my feet
[1:16:52] I'll just stay right here
[1:16:56] these feet were made for bricks not
[1:16:58] walking
[1:17:00] right
[1:17:03] if God told you God tell you how hard it
[1:17:05] was going to be before you got here
[1:17:07] no
[1:17:08] somebody gave you a book gave you a
[1:17:10] track witness to you at work
[1:17:13] and there's something that spoke down
[1:17:15] here it wasn't because it appealed to
[1:17:17] your mind it wasn't because it appealed
[1:17:19] to your eyesight
[1:17:21] it was something that spoke down here a
[1:17:23] predestinated seed that was put there
[1:17:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:27] and there came a Time the predestinated
[1:17:29] time that God said I'm going to water
[1:17:31] that
[1:17:33] there's got to be growth if there's no
[1:17:35] seed there
[1:17:36] there's a seat of eternal life in there
[1:17:38] which brother Branham said that was God
[1:17:39] himself
[1:17:41] how many times we read read it you
[1:17:43] become the Perfection of God
[1:17:46] right
[1:17:48] it ain't just flesh it's the life
[1:17:53] amen
[1:17:55] so I urge you tonight I'm gonna close
[1:17:56] let's stand
[1:17:59] I went 50 minutes
[1:18:02] y'all don't tell brother Donnie I went
[1:18:04] so long
[1:18:07] but tonight whatever you're going
[1:18:09] through
[1:18:10] wherever your ship is
[1:18:13] you might be on a ship of depression

[1:18:19] because your son your daughter is lost
[1:18:23] they need healing they need saving
[1:18:27] you might have financial problems you
[1:18:29] might have sickness in your body the
[1:18:30] doctors don't even know what it is
[1:18:33] everybody's ship is different
[1:18:35] and we're using these proverbial ships
[1:18:39] that they got to burn too
[1:18:42] we're going to burn the ships
[1:18:44] young people you're going through things
[1:18:46] in your life
[1:18:47] you're going through things in your life
[1:18:49] that
[1:18:50] some of us older people never went
[1:18:52] through we don't know what it's like
[1:18:54] you fight different battles
[1:18:56] but God says
[1:18:58] bring that ship into Harbor and burn it
[1:19:01] bring it to the harbor of promise this
[1:19:03] is what I said
[1:19:06] we're setting sins in your life I don't
[1:19:08] know what you deal with you might deal
[1:19:09] with peer pressure you might deal with
[1:19:10] the lust but pornography I don't know
[1:19:11] what you deal with God does
[1:19:15] I urge you leave that ship here tonight
[1:19:17] don't carry it out them doors don't sell
[1:19:20] out them doors with the same ship you
[1:19:21] came in
[1:19:24] that's about our heads
[1:19:31] Heavenly Father
[1:19:34] Lord as I look at my own life
[1:19:37] so many times Lord I've sailed ships
[1:19:39] longer than I I knew I should have
[1:19:42] Lord through your grace through your
[1:19:43] mercy
[1:19:45] I've been able to Anchor many a ship
[1:19:47] Lord set fire to it
[1:19:49] but that's your grace
[1:19:51] it's nothing that I did there was no
[1:19:53] direction of myself
[1:19:55] that was your grace leading me that was
[1:19:57] your grace leading your people
[1:20:01] Lord May the fire of your Holy Spirit
[1:20:04] tonight father

[1:20:14] that the fire of the Holy Spirit would
[1:20:16] light that thing on fire
[1:20:19] and when we take the new land may we
[1:20:21] take the promise you said we could have
[1:20:23] it
[1:20:24] everywhere our footsteps would land you
[1:20:27] didn't say every bit of water that we
[1:20:29] sailed upon was ours you said wherever
[1:20:30] our feet stepped we would claim as our
[1:20:33] possession Lord we can't do that while
[1:20:35] we're floating around in the ship
[1:20:37] help us father
[1:20:39] to burn anything Lord that Satan would
[1:20:41] try to hold against us anything father
[1:20:43] that he would he would form a weapon of
[1:20:45] user's word says it won't prosper
