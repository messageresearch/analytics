[8:44] the name in his name tonight I am so
[8:46] delighted as a young believer of this
[8:48] message that God has opened my eyes in
[8:51] this day to see the light I am certainly
[8:53] not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[8:55] Christ for indeed it is the power of God
[8:57] un salvation to me for I get to believe

[9:06] through the servants which we are
[9:07] grateful for we are grateful for aren't

[9:17] so much pleasure and joy to to be chosen
[9:19] by God and separated from the things of
[9:22] this world I want to encourage my
[9:23] brothers and sisters as Paul said so
[9:26] much as we see the day drawing now let
[9:28] us continue in God word by his grace for
[9:30] I am fully persuaded there's nothing in

[9:40] ministers brother Donnie brother Daryl

[41:23] or every
[41:25] month not even every hour we need him
[41:29] every moment of our
[41:31] life and I'm so grateful that he
[41:33] promised he would be with us and help us
[41:36] and we can testify that he's done that
[41:39] for you amen we greet you today in the
[41:42] name of the Lord Jesus such an honor for
[41:44] us to be together again in the presence
[41:46] of the Lord trust you've come to receive
[41:49] something from the Lord and he believes
[41:51] he's mindful of all of our needs and all
[41:54] of our desires and um we certainly can
[41:58] bring them to him we believe that turn
[42:00] with me if you would to the Book of Luke
[42:02] chap 21 this morning verse
[42:06] 9 um I'd like to give you a little bit
[42:09] of an update on Erica today I'm sure
[42:11] that some of you probably already heard
[42:13] we had the ambulance come to get her
[42:16] yesterday and take her to the hospital
[42:19] and she has pneumonia and both
[42:22] lungs um pancreatitis
[42:28] colitis High ammonia and other things
[42:33] that are that she's dealing
[42:35] with and brother Donnie what did you say
[42:37] about about all that none of this moves
[42:42] me until he says otherwise we're
[42:46] believing for her
[42:48] Miracle
[42:51] amen
[42:55] amen
[43:00] we want to pray want to remember that of
[43:01] course but I'm sure that many of you are
[43:03] aware that Israel has been under
[43:07] bombardment the last couple of days and
[43:10] the last number I had over 400 Israelis
[43:13] have been killed and of course hundreds
[43:15] of Palestinians as well and um estimated
[43:20] over 2500 missiles have been fired on
[43:24] Israel Hamas says ,000 so who knows what
[43:28] it really is but when I look at Israel I
[43:32] can see Israel as as really a type of
[43:35] the Bride because where Israel sits
[43:38] they're totally surrounded by by enemies
[43:41] not just people that dislike them but
[43:43] people that want to destroy them and
[43:46] that's why really there will never be a
[43:48] solution to the Israeli
[43:52] Palestinian um situation because the
[43:55] Palestinians pretty much want them dead
[43:58] annihilated gone finished how can you
[44:00] ever negotiate with people like that and
[44:03] it's the same with the Devil the devil
[44:05] don't want you to back off he wants you
[44:08] gone he wants to kill you and if he
[44:11] can't kill you he wants to make you so
[44:12] crippled up and compromised that your
[44:15] faith can't do anything against
[44:17] him as a matter of
[44:20] fact as I was sitting studying for
[44:23] today he come in the room where I was at
[44:28] and said these words to
[44:30] me if you will
[44:34] compromise I will
[44:37] leave your
[44:41] daughter I said I make no
[44:45] deals with the
[44:54] Devil
[44:58] and he feels that way today we make no
[45:02] deals with the
[45:05] devil so we certainly want to remember
[45:08] Israel and that whole area we know that
[45:11] it's nothing but a time bomb and we know
[45:13] that all the world has to eventually
[45:15] turned against him um we just pray that
[45:19] God will have his way and get his people
[45:22] there we know all Jews are not elect
[45:25] there an element of Jews that are as
[45:27] anti-god as any communist you ever met
[45:30] in your life that's right because some
[45:32] of them say there could be no God to
[45:34] allow their people to go through a
[45:36] holocaust they don't believe in God many
[45:39] Jews do not believe in
[45:42] God but there might be a few of them
[45:44] that's elect and they just ain't come to
[45:46] it yet so we just pray that God's will
[45:49] will be done I mean he has a request on
[45:51] your heart today and your need oh you
[45:53] say but mine seems so small compared to
[45:55] the one ones that you just mentioned but
[45:57] no matter how big it is or how little it
[46:00] is can you imagine God moving on a dumb
[46:05] possum and send that
[46:08] psum to Elijah's house and that dumb
[46:12] posum waited for Elijah to finally catch
[46:15] up that she needed
[46:17] prayer a little fish about that long
[46:20] thrown down in the lake at Dale Holland
[46:22] not too far from where Harry and I were
[46:24] raised and God raised that little tiny
[46:28] fish you know why the prophet said he
[46:31] did that to show that he's concerned
[46:34] about the small
[46:36] things so no matter how we categorize
[46:38] our needs today let's take them to the
[46:41] Lord thank you
[46:43] Lord Heavenly Father we count it such a
[46:46] privilege to be called your
[46:49] children were it not for your Grace
[46:51] today we could be out here on Sunday
[46:55] morning
[46:57] trying to recuperate from a hangover
[46:59] from last
[47:01] night trying to reminisce what we did
[47:03] through the night we were so high that
[47:05] we didn't know where we
[47:08] were
[47:10] lost trying to get enough money together
[47:13] for another hit to make us through the
[47:15] another
[47:17] day but here we stand in the presence of
[47:20] almighty
[47:21] God saved going to heaven loving you
[47:26] more than anything in this
[47:29] world we are so blessed
[47:32] father and we want you to know that we
[47:35] love you with all of our
[47:38] hearts first of all we want to ask you
[47:40] to forgive us of our failures and our
[47:43] shortcomings forgive us for our
[47:45] trespasses against you and and against
[47:48] anyone else we bring our needs before
[47:51] you and we lay them on the altar of
[47:54] God we want to C cast all of our cares
[47:57] upon you today for the Bible tells us
[48:00] you care for
[48:01] us you saw the hands of these people
[48:04] that were uplifted hundreds of them
[48:07] signifying little needs big needs
[48:09] mediumsized needs but whatever they are
[48:12] we bring them before you
[48:14] today I pray father you would go there
[48:16] to that room where Erica is Sycamore
[48:20] schs you see the doctors are trying to
[48:23] give her this med and that Med and this
[48:25] this test and that test and we're
[48:27] thankful for what they can do but father
[48:30] we're ultimately looking to you I rebuke
[48:34] this pneumonia in both of her lungs in
[48:36] the name of Jesus may it clear up father
[48:41] you see this pancreatitis Lord she was
[48:43] dealing with it even though we was gone
[48:45] and tried to get away for a few days and
[48:48] Lord she wasn't good one day we were
[48:51] there and had miserable nights but she
[48:54] didn't want to cut it short
[48:57] and come home because of the rest of us
[49:01] there so she stayed and stayed as long
[49:03] as she could
[49:05] stay but we thank you that we made it
[49:07] home and she didn't have to be put in
[49:10] the hospital there we're
[49:12] grateful we can look all around if we'll
[49:14] open our eyes and see your blessings no
[49:17] matter what we're going through so we
[49:20] made it back home and we're grateful for
[49:22] that and we're just believing that these
[49:23] things are going to be changed I've
[49:25] already sent out a text this morning to
[49:27] many of my preacher friends around the
[49:29] world her name has already been called
[49:31] before your throne the devil's going to
[49:34] regret
[49:35] this he's going to regret every time he
[49:38] stood against the people of God for it
[49:41] only gives you an opportunity to
[49:42] manifest
[49:44] yourself Lord we pray for Israel
[49:47] today dear God it's a difficult
[49:50] situation we know cuz we have many
[49:51] people there that don't even believe in
[49:53] you yet we have some small message
[49:56] groups there and from the words that
[49:59] I've heard so far they're all doing okay
[50:02] and we pray that you'd watch over them
[50:05] Lord God may you deal with your
[50:07] elect I pray in the name of Jesus every
[50:11] child of God here today that ain't
[50:13] homesick may they become that way so we
[50:17] can get so sick of this world that we
[50:20] cry and pray the way John did come Lord
[50:24] Jesus come Lord
[50:27] Jesus but until that hour
[50:30] comes Lord I am your
[50:32] servant I am reporting for
[50:36] Duty these are your servants we have
[50:40] come here today reporting for Duty and
[50:45] we say to
[50:47] hell you will regret
[50:52] this as the army of God as the people
[50:55] people of God we stand on the side of
[50:58] our
[51:00] King speak to us today father from your
[51:03] word we
[51:04] ask in the name of the Lord Jesus the
[51:08] Saints
[51:10] said God bless you amen Luke 21 verse
[51:16] 9 but when you shall hear of
[51:20] wars and commotions
[51:23] wars and commotions
[51:26] be
[51:27] not
[51:30] terrified wow so when you hear of wars
[51:34] and commotions be not
[51:37] terrified for these things say it with
[51:40] me
[51:42] must
[51:44] must not possibly perhaps must first
[51:50] come to pass but the end is not by and
[51:54] by and we know verse n has been ongoing
[51:56] for many many many years hundreds of
[51:58] years then said he unto them
[52:02] Nation shall rise against nation and
[52:06] Kingdom against Kingdom and great
[52:11] earthquakes I know that it's you know
[52:13] been pretty small but just just two days
[52:16] ago before yesterday another earthquake
[52:19] hit part of the Middle East there killed
[52:21] around 2,000 people earthquakes shall be
[52:24] in diverse places
[52:26] and famines and
[52:29] pestilences and fearful
[52:32] sights and Great Signs shall there be
[52:37] from Heaven Romans chapter 8 verse1
[52:43] 15 for ye have not received the spirit
[52:46] of bondage
[52:48] again to
[52:50] fear but ye have received the spirit of
[52:57] what
[52:59] adoption whereby we
[53:02] cry ABA father may the Lord bless his
[53:06] words you may be
[53:15] seated there's a lot to be afraid of if
[53:17] we look
[53:19] around I read just yesterday
[53:22] where disease X
[53:26] will be many hundreds of times more
[53:31] deadly than Co ever
[53:33] was pestilence is breaking out around
[53:38] the world chalera many different things
[53:41] that we thought were defeated by science
[53:45] and education and Men of great minds are
[53:49] reappearing
[53:51] again fearful sights in the heavens
[53:56] how is it that Israel one of the most
[53:59] advanced nations in the world in their
[54:03] shinb bet in their ability to gather
[54:07] intelligence
[54:09] informations and their main Ally the
[54:12] United States of America were so taken
[54:17] to where that a group of Islamic
[54:21] militants by the name of Hamas would be
[54:24] able to slip in on the southern
[54:27] border and Israel didn't know it America
[54:31] didn't know it none of the rest of the
[54:33] world knew it how was that even possible
[54:37] one day after the yam Kapur war in
[54:42] 1973 which was Israel's darkest time
[54:46] since they had been a nation and yet
[54:49] Israel of course they said the fall then
[54:52] was because they had such pride in thems
[54:55] eles that they believed they had the
[54:58] ability to watch everything around them
[55:01] I wonder if it hasn't repeat it again
[55:04] Israel leads the nation in many medical
[55:09] Technologies and many AI
[55:12] Technologies and many things that other
[55:16] nations of the world are way behind them
[55:19] I wonder sometimes if pride and
[55:21] arrogance does not get not only the
[55:24] nation
[55:25] but individuals to where we think we've
[55:28] got this we've got this we're good our
[55:31] borders are strong you know Israel has
[55:34] one of the greatest anti-missile defense
[55:38] systems in the world Germany just bought
[55:42] some of their systems Israel helped
[55:45] develop the stealth F35 Fighter the
[55:49] F22 Fighter the most advanced fighters
[55:53] in the known world how is is it then
[55:56] that these militants could come through
[55:58] on
[56:00] motorcycles they could cut the wire
[56:03] fence and had paratroopers on
[56:07] paragliders no more than a
[56:11] balloon and yet attacked from the
[56:15] sky hundreds and hundreds of them over
[56:19] 600 the count that I got this morning
[56:21] been killed 2,000 injured
[56:26] hundreds that are
[56:29] prisoners how could this
[56:32] happen because Israel like every other
[56:34] Nation when they leave God the Bible
[56:38] says they will be turned into
[56:41] hell you know and the same thing applies
[56:44] to churches does it not as it applies to
[56:48] individuals so as I was looking early
[56:51] this morning before daylight as they
[56:54] were interviewing different people there
[56:56] and they said what's the feel in Israel
[56:58] and I kept hearing this same word over
[57:01] and over again
[57:03] fear fear we thought we were safe we
[57:09] thought this would never happen to us
[57:12] again how is this possible of course the
[57:16] Americans are wanting to know how could
[57:18] this ever be I saw some of our
[57:20] congressmen some of our Senators and
[57:23] they W to have a hearing you now
[57:25] politicians think hearings hearings this
[57:28] hearings that we've got to get to the
[57:30] bottom of this we've got to get to the
[57:33] bottom I saw some of you same
[57:35] politicians one day will be asking the
[57:38] same question how could we have ever
[57:41] ever let this happen to us that Russia
[57:45] annihilated us how will it ever be the
[57:49] same principle in view they didn't think
[57:52] they needed
[57:53] God they said it in the days of the
[57:56] Prophet we don't need oh Jehovah as long
[58:00] as we've got the Army the Navy the Air
[58:03] Force and the Marines we need Jehovah I
[58:07] don't care how good our army is I don't
[58:10] care how big our church is how wealthy
[58:12] we are how much we think we know we need
[58:16] him every hour of our
[58:20] life it is a great fearful time is it
[58:22] not I guarantee you this morning people
[58:25] all over Israel are terrified earlier in
[58:28] the day this morning Hezbollah on the
[58:31] Northern end of Israel which is already
[58:33] been setting up their headquarters
[58:35] already Gathering their militia already
[58:37] Gathering great intelligence sources
[58:40] they fired over some missiles so now
[58:42] they're pondering will Israel deal with
[58:44] a battle in the South and already won
[58:47] brewing in the north well you see that's
[58:50] why I think that they're a reflection of
[58:52] the Bride because no matter which way
[58:54] way the bride turns whether it's north
[58:56] south east or west it seem like we are
[58:59] bombarded with sickness and disease and
[59:02] trouble and turmoil on our job in our
[59:06] home and the church is not free from it
[59:08] but I would just like to say we are
[59:11] unlike Israel in that we depend upon our
[59:14] Great Mighty Men with great intelligence
[59:17] we don't depend upon the Marines and the
[59:20] Air Corp we don't depend upon scientists
[59:24] but we depend upon the baptism of the
[59:27] Holy Ghost and we believe God has got
[59:30] men in the earth that are LED of the
[59:33] Holy Ghost and they will preach the word
[59:36] and they will blow the trumpet before
[59:39] the devil ever makes a move they will
[59:41] sound the alarm get ready get ready
[59:45] because the enemy is coming but we will
[59:48] not be overtaken we will not be
[59:51] blindsided by hell because we have men
[59:55] of God that have an unction of the Holy
[59:58] Ghost they don't depend upon wi tapping
[1:00:02] they don't depend upon listening to the
[1:00:05] internet but they listen to the father
[1:00:08] as he says warn the congregation warn
[1:00:11] the congregation evil is near warn them
[1:00:16] that darkness is near tell them to get
[1:00:19] filled ever fiber with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:23] because he is time is upon
[1:00:26] [Applause]
[1:00:28] [Music]
[1:00:33] us and from
[1:00:36] that I would like to speak to you again
[1:00:38] this morning on a life
[1:00:41] above
[1:00:43] ungodly
[1:00:45] fear no
[1:00:47] friends we do not have to live every
[1:00:50] moment of our life under the devil's
[1:00:53] fear
[1:00:56] look with me in second Timothy if you
[1:00:58] would again this morning where Paul
[1:01:00] writing about this and he said 1 2
[1:01:03] Timothy 1:7 God has not given us the
[1:01:07] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:01:13] and of a sound mind I me know there's a
[1:01:16] Godly fear a righteous fear we all know
[1:01:19] that we all know we need it when a
[1:01:21] nation loses their fear of God well look
[1:01:24] at what they turn into when a people
[1:01:26] lose their fear of God you watch our
[1:01:28] young people when they lose that
[1:01:31] reverential fear of their parents you
[1:01:34] watch how they erode in their
[1:01:37] individuality they will begin to have
[1:01:40] this Rebellion inside of them and it
[1:01:43] won't just stop with Mom and Daddy it
[1:01:45] will it will go to every aspect of
[1:01:48] authority you lose respect for your
[1:01:51] father and your mother it won't be long
[1:01:53] you lose respect respect for the deacons
[1:01:55] of the church and they tell you don't do
[1:01:58] this or oh I don't have to listen to
[1:01:59] nobody or you say but I've still got
[1:02:02] respect for you brother Donnie but you
[1:02:04] won't have it long because Satan wants
[1:02:06] to take down every element of that
[1:02:09] respect come on somebody let's have
[1:02:11] church today because Satan wants to tear
[1:02:14] every bit of it down and before long you
[1:02:17] have no respect for anyone or no respect
[1:02:21] in the aspect as far as those that are
[1:02:24] above you which is exactly where our
[1:02:26] world is where our nation is
[1:02:29] international law doesn't mean anything
[1:02:32] American law doesn't mean anything it
[1:02:34] don't mean anything to them that's in
[1:02:36] the White House the only reason they've
[1:02:38] got laws to put you in jail when you
[1:02:41] break the law but they can break the law
[1:02:43] they can lie they can cheat they can
[1:02:46] steal come on somebody they can do
[1:02:48] whatever they want to do you think the
[1:02:50] Congress lives by the law well a lot of
[1:02:53] them ain't nothing but a bunch of
[1:02:54] Hypocrites the Senators ain't nothing
[1:02:57] come on Amen the our Governors our
[1:03:00] Mayors there ain't nothing but a bunch
[1:03:02] of Hypocrites there's only one thing
[1:03:04] that's going to bring peace to the Earth
[1:03:06] it ain't the Republicans winning in 2024
[1:03:10] it ain't the Democrats winning in 2024
[1:03:13] there's only one thing that's going to
[1:03:15] bring peace back to the Earth and that's
[1:03:17] when King Jesus comes back to the Earth
[1:03:20] again well if the Russians take over
[1:03:23] we'll have peace no we won't if the
[1:03:25] Norwegians take over we'll have peace no
[1:03:28] we won't we'll only have peace when
[1:03:31] Jesus comes back and Hallelujah he
[1:03:33] eradicates sin and he binds the devil
[1:03:37] and throws him down there in that pit
[1:03:39] for a thousand years and then the Earth
[1:03:42] will enter into the Blessed Millennium
[1:03:45] and we will have peace there will be no
[1:03:49] peace until the Prince of Peace comes
[1:03:52] back but while we are waiting in from
[1:03:55] that we can have peace in here we can
[1:03:59] have peace in the middle of hell we can
[1:04:02] have peace in the middle of storms in
[1:04:04] the middle of Trials we can look hell in
[1:04:07] the face and say you won't take my joy
[1:04:11] you won't take my peace because Jesus
[1:04:14] the prince of peace has already set up
[1:04:17] his kingdom and my
[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:23] soul thank you I want you to notice that
[1:04:27] Paul and Dena was this he said God has
[1:04:30] not given us the spirit of
[1:04:33] fear but you ever notice this he doesn't
[1:04:35] say God hadn't given us the emotion of
[1:04:40] fear
[1:04:41] fear is an
[1:04:43] emotion just like joy happiness all
[1:04:47] other kinds of
[1:04:49] emotions but sometimes people tend to
[1:04:52] think because they EXP experience the
[1:04:55] emotion of fear that they're not
[1:04:58] trusting God that's not true at all that
[1:05:01] means simply you're a human being how
[1:05:04] many still gets afraid of things
[1:05:06] somebody come up behind you and poke in
[1:05:08] the side you
[1:05:10] say you jump out of your
[1:05:13] skin somebody stop in front of you and
[1:05:16] you say oh God oh God oh God help me
[1:05:18] what is that happiness somebody turns
[1:05:21] off in front of you somebody nearly runs
[1:05:23] you off the road or whatever you know
[1:05:25] how road rage is in the days we're
[1:05:26] living in so which emotion does that
[1:05:29] trigger Happiness joy satisfaction peace
[1:05:33] fear cuz you never know what people's
[1:05:34] going to do they'll run you off the road
[1:05:37] they'll do you know you know that is for
[1:05:38] a parking spot in Walmart and people get
[1:05:41] out and walk two miles of an evening to
[1:05:43] get exercise and they want the closest
[1:05:45] parking spot to Walmart to the front
[1:05:47] door and if you pull in their place oh
[1:05:49] my
[1:05:51] goodness so what emotion does that Stir
[1:05:54] It stirs the emotion of fear that is not
[1:05:57] sinful that is human but Paul said God
[1:06:01] has not given us the spirit of fear so
[1:06:05] you see a spirit has to have a host
[1:06:09] right a spirit has to have a host to be
[1:06:14] able to attach itself to I know it's
[1:06:17] hard for us to to to relate to this
[1:06:19] really but whenever Jesus got ready to
[1:06:21] cast them Devils out of the man at Gat
[1:06:25] and them demons could not stand to go
[1:06:28] out into the
[1:06:31] abyss so they asked if they could be
[1:06:34] cast
[1:06:35] into a herd of
[1:06:38] pigs I say why in the world would a
[1:06:41] spirit want to live in a bunch of
[1:06:44] hogs because they need a
[1:06:48] host even if it's an animal they would
[1:06:52] rather live in animals than to be
[1:06:56] disembodied and live in the realm of the
[1:07:00] Abyss on so they ask can we go there and
[1:07:05] Jesus says
[1:07:07] go well them Hogs had a whole lot more
[1:07:10] sense than people's got because once
[1:07:12] them Devils went in there they thought I
[1:07:14] can't live this life I can't live this
[1:07:17] life I'm killing myself so here goes the
[1:07:21] whole herd of hogs and the went into the
[1:07:25] place there of water and choked himself
[1:07:28] now the devil's the devil's kind of ass
[1:07:30] that's kind of stupid in one sense of
[1:07:32] the word was it because the Devils
[1:07:33] didn't realize this is going to be a
[1:07:35] short-lived experience for me I'm still
[1:07:38] going to the to the be because them Hogs
[1:07:41] could not stand demonic oppression and
[1:07:46] possession so something moved upon these
[1:07:49] pigs now we call pigs dumb and I agree I
[1:07:52] I I've had a lot of pigs and they can be
[1:07:54] pretty dumb but they had enough sense to
[1:07:56] know they didn't want to live a demon
[1:07:58] possessed life so they run in one Accord
[1:08:01] so the main boore s whichever it was
[1:08:04] took off and she said I can't stand it I
[1:08:06] can't stand it I can't
[1:08:08] stand and all the
[1:08:18] rest and they go and drown
[1:08:22] themselves you see not only does Nations
[1:08:26] have spirits but churches
[1:08:31] do a friend of mine several years ago
[1:08:34] was at a
[1:08:36] certain message meeting I'll say it that
[1:08:42] way and it was a move in the message
[1:08:45] that had been around for a long time but
[1:08:48] they had a certain agenda that they were
[1:08:51] trying to
[1:08:52] promote and this friend of mine goes to
[1:08:55] this meeting hundreds and hundreds of
[1:08:58] people there from all over
[1:09:02] everywhere and he was curious brother
[1:09:04] Joel just to know you know what's it all
[1:09:07] about I I don't want to miss anything am
[1:09:10] am I missing something that God's
[1:09:13] doing and he sat a good ways back in the
[1:09:16] auditorium where the meeting was and the
[1:09:19] people are going and M they're shouting
[1:09:22] and running
[1:09:24] the music and the singing and what felt
[1:09:27] like the spirit of
[1:09:29] God what seemed like the spirit of
[1:09:34] God and then all of the sudden as he
[1:09:37] looked upon on the
[1:09:38] platform he saw a spirit raise
[1:09:42] up but it was a
[1:09:46] woman and this was a very beautiful
[1:09:49] woman dressed in a real seductive
[1:09:55] Tempest type of
[1:09:58] closing so the preachers are on the
[1:10:00] platform the musicians the singers and
[1:10:02] hundreds and hundreds of people are
[1:10:04] screaming and hollering and oh
[1:10:06] my and he watches as this Spirit comes
[1:10:10] up above the
[1:10:12] congregation and she starts walking out
[1:10:15] over the top of the people and motioning
[1:10:18] for him like
[1:10:22] this
[1:10:27] you realize
[1:10:29] that
[1:10:31] demons love certain church
[1:10:36] services that's why you need to be
[1:10:39] careful well you get on to that and and
[1:10:42] they'll go to talking to you now you see
[1:10:46] that man went there to find out is this
[1:10:50] right is it wrong what's what's going on
[1:10:52] with it and go God allowed him to break
[1:10:55] into another realm now there was all
[1:10:57] these hundreds of people there that no
[1:10:59] doubt left that and thought Oh Glory to
[1:11:01] God this is oh my this is
[1:11:04] something but that man left with a total
[1:11:08] different
[1:11:10] view what was it
[1:11:13] demons mhm
[1:11:16] demons I know every time I go to talking
[1:11:19] this way some of yall get
[1:11:22] scared now you know what that is you're
[1:11:24] feeling it's not just the emotion of
[1:11:26] fear it's the spirit of fear because
[1:11:29] you're scared to death one of these
[1:11:31] things is going to get on you well I'll
[1:11:33] tell you the only way that'll happen is
[1:11:35] if you allow
[1:11:38] it don't sit there and be terrified oh
[1:11:41] God oh God I don't I don't want that to
[1:11:42] happen to me well if you don't want it
[1:11:44] to you ain't got nothing to worry about
[1:11:47] but Brother Don every time I hear a
[1:11:49] preacher talk about that it just makes
[1:11:51] me so nervous and so upset you sat right
[1:11:53] there and cl the blood of Jesus and say
[1:11:55] Satan you are a liar my body is the
[1:11:59] Temple of the Holy Ghost not demons but
[1:12:03] you see there's a difference then in the
[1:12:06] emotion of fear and a spirit of fear now
[1:12:10] when this man saw this he told me this
[1:12:11] himself whenever he saw this it left him
[1:12:16] and he left that place of course
[1:12:18] immediately and he walked out of there
[1:12:20] so you can imagine every time this
[1:12:22] certain mve
[1:12:24] is mentioned to this man he does not
[1:12:27] think of all the screaming shouting
[1:12:29] hollering healings or whatever more but
[1:12:33] he thinks about the seductive temptress
[1:12:37] spirit that was in this certain thing
[1:12:40] around the message don't you understand
[1:12:42] all these moves around the message that
[1:12:44] are absolutely contrary to the teaching
[1:12:47] of the word of God don't you understand
[1:12:49] what that is it's
[1:12:51] demons and people will get under it and
[1:12:54] they feel so pulled and they feel so
[1:12:57] pull say well maybe it's the Lord maybe
[1:13:00] it's the Lord or maybe it's a
[1:13:04] demon well how can I tell judge it by
[1:13:08] the word the Holy Ghost will never lead
[1:13:13] his word that's right is that right now
[1:13:17] do those things do they do they make me
[1:13:20] worrisome of course they do I don't like
[1:13:23] been around demons I've had to deal with
[1:13:25] some the majority of my life I don't
[1:13:28] like having to cast out Devils I don't
[1:13:30] like seeing them I don't like feeling
[1:13:33] them I don't like knowing and I know
[1:13:35] they're right here and now but that's
[1:13:37] all right I also know who else is here
[1:13:40] so that's why I ain't
[1:13:43] afraid come on there Saints but you see
[1:13:47] a spirit is in need of a host now that
[1:13:51] host is you you I people out here in the
[1:13:55] world and we are the ones that will give
[1:13:58] them a habitable portion in humanity so
[1:14:02] they will come try to get in our bodies
[1:14:05] try to affect us and our spirits and our
[1:14:07] walk with God or by the grace of God we
[1:14:10] can realize you know what I've developed
[1:14:12] a critical spirit I've got a spirit of
[1:14:14] fear on me and I'm sick of it I want to
[1:14:17] be set free come on somebody or you can
[1:14:20] be a host for that spirit and then
[1:14:24] instead of it just being the emotion of
[1:14:26] fear you actually have given that Spirit
[1:14:29] a body and emotions and all the anxiety
[1:14:33] and all the trouble and all that that it
[1:14:35] goes through and it never will just stay
[1:14:37] on you alone it wants to get on you then
[1:14:40] get on your husband or get on your
[1:14:42] children or get on your wife whichever
[1:14:44] it is and then you get around other
[1:14:46] people and they sense it and then they
[1:14:48] pick it up and it gets on them and then
[1:14:50] it gets around their family and they get
[1:14:52] around their friends that's exactly what
[1:14:55] fear wants to do I don't know about you
[1:14:59] I'm sick of
[1:15:00] it I said I'm sick of it I am sick of
[1:15:05] God's people being bound under a spirit
[1:15:09] of
[1:15:11] fear I believe we can live above
[1:15:15] it you see when you allow fear to
[1:15:19] control your thoughts to control your
[1:15:22] emotions ions to control even the way
[1:15:26] you worship and the way you pray oh I'm
[1:15:29] afraid oh if I was to really ever turn
[1:15:31] loose and really worship God what will
[1:15:33] people say what will the say what are
[1:15:36] you more concerned about what they say
[1:15:39] or what he says well come on now
[1:15:42] somebody and when we allow a spirit of
[1:15:45] fear to monopolize Our Lives it will
[1:15:49] control the way you work it will control
[1:15:51] the way you worship it will control you
[1:15:54] or you won't trust nobody oh I'm afraid
[1:15:57] oh I've been hurt before I've been so
[1:15:59] hurt before you can't trust nobody oh my
[1:16:01] you can't trust people you just have to
[1:16:03] stay away from them that's exactly what
[1:16:05] he wants you to do he wants you to
[1:16:07] isolate yourself and cut yourself off
[1:16:10] from everybody else come on somebody but
[1:16:13] you need to realize that ain't nothing
[1:16:15] but a ly devil sure people will hurt you
[1:16:19] sure people will let you down but there
[1:16:21] are people in this Earth and in this
[1:16:24] church that will stand beside you with
[1:16:27] their very last breaths but it depends
[1:16:30] upon which one you're going to believe
[1:16:33] are you going to believe the spirit of
[1:16:35] fear or are you going to believe God's
[1:16:38] word that God is amen producing a people
[1:16:43] that believes what he
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:51] said so the spirit of
[1:16:54] fear begins to manipulate your
[1:16:57] thoughts your
[1:17:08] speech let me show you an acronym
[1:17:13] today anybody know what an acronym is
[1:17:16] okay
[1:17:18] good so let's look at a
[1:17:21] acronym of fear rather show it to
[1:17:29] them f a r false
[1:17:36] evidence
[1:17:38] appearing
[1:17:40] real ladies and gentlemen an
[1:17:44] acronym false evidence I wonder how many
[1:17:48] people are in prison today
[1:17:51] naturally because someone planted
[1:17:55] evidence in their car or their home or
[1:18:00] their business office or whatever more
[1:18:02] someone was able to sneak in and plant
[1:18:06] false
[1:18:07] evidence and then it was presented to
[1:18:09] the judge and the jury whenever they had
[1:18:12] their trial and say your honor this was
[1:18:14] found in the trunk of his car now jury
[1:18:17] this was found in his bedroom this was
[1:18:20] found here and there and there and the
[1:18:21] people say well it was there the man's
[1:18:24] guilty they're Shores the world the jury
[1:18:26] all gets together yep we found this man
[1:18:28] guilty we hear about it monthly
[1:18:31] sometimes every week you'll hear of
[1:18:33] somebody that spent 20 years in prison I
[1:18:36] saw the picture of a man just this past
[1:18:38] week 40 something years of his life was
[1:18:42] spent in prison and then by DNA testing
[1:18:46] they proved this man was innocent as I
[1:18:49] looked at that man Brother David I
[1:18:50] thought how much that man has has lost
[1:18:54] in those 42 years being put up in prison
[1:18:57] sitting there Harry every day knowing he
[1:19:00] was innocent knowing he was innocent but
[1:19:04] by our laws and by the way that we do it
[1:19:07] they judge this man guilty and confined
[1:19:10] him to a prison years away from his
[1:19:13] family years away from society years
[1:19:16] away from everything as I looked at that
[1:19:19] and then I looked at this as I studied
[1:19:21] when I was gone this past week and I
[1:19:23] realize that's not just so for people
[1:19:25] going to the penitentiary but Satan will
[1:19:28] try to do the same thing in our everyday
[1:19:30] lives he will try to plant false
[1:19:33] evidence in your mind false evidence in
[1:19:37] your home and get you even question the
[1:19:39] Loyalty of your husband or your wife
[1:19:42] come on somebody he will try to give you
[1:19:45] symptoms and the prophet said symptoms
[1:19:48] is the worst enemy of Divine Healing
[1:19:51] because somebody will get prayed for and
[1:19:53] their hand is worse tomorrow than it was
[1:19:56] today and they will say well I guess I
[1:19:59] didn't get healed do you understand what
[1:20:01] that was false evidence appearing real
[1:20:05] come on Hallelujah well I got prayed for
[1:20:08] it for this certain besetting sin don't
[1:20:10] you know it hit me worse on Tuesday I
[1:20:13] must not been delivered false evidence
[1:20:16] appearing real can pain be real oh yes
[1:20:21] can headaches be real yes
[1:20:23] and Satan will plant false evidence in
[1:20:27] your body trying to get you to believe
[1:20:30] that you did not receive what God did
[1:20:34] for you you can go to a youth camp and
[1:20:37] be delivered of an evil spirit and Satan
[1:20:41] will come right back and plant false
[1:20:44] evidence and you'll say well I guess I
[1:20:47] didn't get nothing no you're letting the
[1:20:49] devil use his acronym of fear against
[1:20:53] you false evidence while I lost my
[1:20:56] temper false evidence I done this false
[1:21:00] evidence I done that but you need to
[1:21:03] recognize the
[1:21:07] devil Hallelujah and say to him false
[1:21:12] evidence appearing
[1:21:21] real
[1:21:25] and go to the
[1:21:26] judge and say
[1:21:28] father I
[1:21:30] failed I'm
[1:21:33] sorry forgive me the devil planted this
[1:21:37] evidence on
[1:21:41] me but I
[1:21:44] Repent I'm sorry
[1:21:47] Lord listen this in the water of
[1:21:50] Separation The Prophet said I used to
[1:21:53] often time wonder what's the matter with
[1:21:57] the Christian Church they're so scared
[1:22:01] of
[1:22:02] things why you've got
[1:22:06] nothing to be scared
[1:22:09] about but how Satan has taken his
[1:22:12] acronym of fear and almost let make it
[1:22:15] appear like we have nothing to be happy
[1:22:21] about he holds that acronym before you I
[1:22:24] know it's the first time maybe some of
[1:22:25] you all have ever seen this but believe
[1:22:27] it or not you've been living a lot of

[1:29:36] bed but they showed
[1:29:41] up

[1:29:45] showing up and don't just bring your
[1:29:48] body but bring your mind bring your

[1:29:56] bring your worshiping God bring that
[1:29:58] voice to say hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[1:30:02] not leaving my worship voice at home I'm
[1:30:05] bringing it to church with
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:17] me look at what God Said to
[1:30:20] Joshua Joshua 1:9 have not I commanded
[1:30:25] thee be strong and be of good courage Be
[1:30:29] not
[1:30:30] Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[1:30:34] Lord thy God is with thee whether soever
[1:30:39] thou
[1:30:44] goest
[1:30:45] or we can be like brother
[1:30:50] job
[1:30:53] now let me be the first to put a
[1:30:56] disclaimer on this statement I'm fixing
[1:30:58] to
[1:30:59] make I don't know how the sovereignty of
[1:31:02] God works okay I don't know how test
[1:31:06] sent from God versus things we
[1:31:09] say and our part plays into the bigger
[1:31:12] picture I don't understand all
[1:31:16] that but job says in chapter 3: 25 for
[1:31:19] the
[1:31:20] thing which I greatly
[1:31:24] feared has come upon
[1:31:29] me and that which I was afraid
[1:31:33] of is come unto
[1:31:37] me now the prophet picks this up in a
[1:31:40] sermon of all titles to mention this
[1:31:44] perfect
[1:31:46] face and he said in the Book of Job it
[1:31:49] says job feared and what he feared
[1:31:52] actually
[1:31:53] happened what brought
[1:31:56] it
[1:31:58] his
[1:32:05] fear
[1:32:07] his
[1:32:09] fear I wonder if a lot of what we go
[1:32:13] through is brought Upon Us
[1:32:17] ourselves because we're so afraid it's
[1:32:21] going to happen happen you know what
[1:32:22] you're doing you're actually believing
[1:32:26] that it
[1:32:29] will this is the flip side of faith in
[1:32:32] God's
[1:32:33] promise that we so expect why my
[1:32:36] grandmother died with cancer and my
[1:32:37] mother and my aunt and my so and so and
[1:32:40] my son's oh no oh no it must be in my
[1:32:42] jeans it must be in My
[1:32:45] DNA my daddy had all type of sexual
[1:32:48] problems or it just runs in my family
[1:32:50] but I'd tell that devil The Bu stops
[1:32:52] here it might have been in my grandpa it
[1:32:55] might have been in my great great great
[1:32:56] great great great great grandpa but it
[1:32:58] ain't going no farther it ain't getting
[1:33:00] a hold to me because I'm a Son of God
[1:33:02] they didn't maybe set in the church that
[1:33:04] I set in that preaches deliverance and
[1:33:06] practices casting out Devils amen they
[1:33:09] might not have known what I want but it
[1:33:11] ain't controlling me lust is not
[1:33:15] dominating my life
[1:33:18] hallelujah it's not controlling me
[1:33:22] [Applause]
[1:33:25] or you can be fearful and anxious and
[1:33:27] beside
[1:33:29] yourself and then your
[1:33:31] fear will bring it upon
[1:33:34] you
[1:33:36] wow notice this how the prophet said his
[1:33:40] fear brought
[1:33:43] it to
[1:33:45] him job's fear brother da
[1:33:50] delivered
[1:33:55] wow he was scared it was going to happen
[1:33:59] and it did
[1:34:00] happen now if he would have know it
[1:34:03] wouldn't
[1:34:05] happen it wouldn't
[1:34:10] happen help us
[1:34:13] Lord if you're afraid when you come by
[1:34:16] the prayer line maybe I just haven't got
[1:34:18] faith sufficient it'll never happen
[1:34:22] don't
[1:34:23] worry but if you know it's going to
[1:34:26] happen Hallelujah it'll happen see it's
[1:34:29] a substance of something job had a fear
[1:34:34] that these things would come upon
[1:34:37] him and they
[1:34:40] did if you have a fear your
[1:34:43] disease won't leave
[1:34:46] you it
[1:34:50] won't if you have a faith that it
[1:34:54] will well you know the
[1:34:56] results you ask any medical doctor the
[1:34:59] first thing that that he will try to do
[1:35:01] is get you to have confidence in his
[1:35:03] medicine that he's going to give you if
[1:35:05] you haven't got no confidence in it you
[1:35:07] better leave it alone sure see what is
[1:35:11] it then it's
[1:35:14] faith that does the
[1:35:16] healing so if you go to the doctor and
[1:35:18] they say drink three cups of watermelon
[1:35:21] juice
[1:35:21] mixed with one head of broccoli and two
[1:35:24] head of cauliflower and three fat grapes
[1:35:27] and 14 raisins don't add 15 but add 14
[1:35:31] don't sit your look at me like that some
[1:35:33] of you all probably tried that
[1:35:38] recipe you know is when we get sick
[1:35:40] we'll do just about anything well rub
[1:35:42] your head and cross your eyes and you
[1:35:44] know twitch at the same time glory to
[1:35:45] God brother only I've tried that well
[1:35:47] did it help you I did what was it your
[1:35:50] faith well I believe if I take this
[1:35:52] it'll help my antihistamine it'll shut
[1:35:54] down the XYZ and the lobia the
[1:35:57] phosphates and the this and that and the
[1:35:58] other and you say man alive that
[1:36:00] medicine is so good it wasn't probably
[1:36:02] even the medicine after all it was your
[1:36:05] face that it would help you don't you
[1:36:07] understand God loves Humanity he don't
[1:36:10] want them to be
[1:36:18] sick oh my goodness Isaiah 354 can we go
[1:36:23] a little while longer y'all ain't no
[1:36:25] hurry are you Isaiah 35:4 say to them
[1:36:29] that are of a fearful
[1:36:32] heart be
[1:36:34] strong fear not behold your God will
[1:36:39] come with
[1:36:41] vengeance even god with a
[1:36:43] recompense he will come and save
[1:36:49] you thank you Lord Isaiah 41:10 fear
[1:36:53] thou not for I am with thee be not
[1:36:56] dismayed for I am thy God I will
[1:36:59] strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay
[1:37:01] I will uphold thee with the right hand
[1:37:04] of my righteousness verse 13 for I the
[1:37:07] Lord thy God will hold thy right hand
[1:37:09] saying unto thee fear not I will help
[1:37:14] thee it's amazing how many times Old and
[1:37:18] New Testament these words are coupled
[1:37:21] either fear not or don't fear or don't
[1:37:24] be afraid why we inherited that after
[1:37:26] the fall when Adam running head the
[1:37:29] first time behind the bush and he got
[1:37:33] afraid he planted something in his
[1:37:36] seed and the generations of billions of
[1:37:39] people that would live for thousands of
[1:37:41] years after him man never felt
[1:37:45] fear until that
[1:37:49] time I want you to listen to this quote
[1:37:52] so a brother Minister brother shared
[1:37:54] this with me a few weeks ago I've been
[1:37:55] sending it around the world because it's
[1:37:57] such a blessing to me and I think of
[1:38:00] Moses how that Moses standing up there
[1:38:01] on the mount by the side of this Burning
[1:38:05] Bush had lost all
[1:38:08] hopes of
[1:38:12] Freedom now here's Moses the mighty man
[1:38:14] of God God's
[1:38:17] deliverer but Moses himself had lost all
[1:38:23] hopes of
[1:38:27] Freedom didn't seem like that the
[1:38:29] freedom that the people he so gallantly
[1:38:32] stood for at one time was ever going to
[1:38:36] happen but in the light of God standing
[1:38:39] by that burning bush
[1:38:42] everything in
[1:38:44] him
[1:38:46] changed don't you understand from that's
[1:38:48] what I'm trying to help you see today if
[1:38:50] this can change in you you'll walk out
[1:38:54] them same doors different
[1:38:59] people everything in him changed I think
[1:39:02] it's the same today that many of us lose
[1:39:08] the
[1:39:08] sight of
[1:39:12] Freedom so what about that besetting s
[1:39:15] brothers what about those of you that
[1:39:16] deal with pornography what about those
[1:39:18] of you that deal with temper anger
[1:39:20] whatever it is to deal with and that
[1:39:22] thing seem like it will not let go
[1:39:25] you've been in prayer line after prayer
[1:39:27] line you've been prayed for by every man
[1:39:29] of God you got confidence in and you go
[1:39:31] good for a while and fall right back in
[1:39:33] the same thing
[1:39:36] again and it can seem as if though you
[1:39:40] lose the very sight of
[1:39:46] freedom and you find yourself back down
[1:39:50] at the pyramid pids of
[1:39:53] Egypt you find yourself at suckles
[1:39:57] working on the Statue of
[1:40:00] ramesis you find yourself over at the
[1:40:03] Nile pedaling with your feet irrigating
[1:40:06] Egyptian
[1:40:08] crops and
[1:40:10] freedom seems like it's a million miles
[1:40:13] from
[1:40:16] you but if the pillar of fire can come
[1:40:19] by this way today yes
[1:40:22] sir hallelujah
[1:40:25] hallelujah if the pillar of fire can
[1:40:27] come by our way and you can get near
[1:40:30] that fire it can get near to you and
[1:40:33] change something within
[1:40:35] you then you can look at Freedom is no
[1:40:38] longer an attainable something that's
[1:40:40] for everybody else but not for you but
[1:40:43] you will regain sight of your
[1:40:49] freedom
[1:40:51] I think here here's a little boy sitting
[1:40:54] before
[1:40:55] me probably an infantile
[1:40:59] paralysis little arms all twisted up I
[1:41:03] look at a lady with a white
[1:41:05] king probably a blind woman lovely young
[1:41:08] lady laying on the little cart maybe
[1:41:11] many out there with cancer heart trouble
[1:41:14] and
[1:41:15] diseases that's going to kill
[1:41:19] you but you lose lose all thought of
[1:41:24] Freedom as soon as the doctor says it's
[1:41:37] incurable isn't it amazing of all the
[1:41:41] diseases that was existing in the
[1:41:46] 40s and when the angel of God appeared
[1:41:48] to the
[1:41:49] prophet he mentioned one by
[1:41:55] name
[1:41:59] cancer why somebody have pneumonia oh
[1:42:02] yeah oh yeah I ain't had that you'll get
[1:42:04] over you'll be
[1:42:05] fine somebody has this oh yeah but what
[1:42:08] is it about cancer you realize many
[1:42:11] people won't even say that word they
[1:42:13] call it the c
[1:42:14] word well I am not scared myself to say
[1:42:18] that word cuz it ain't nothing but the
[1:42:20] another word for a devil out of
[1:42:23] hell and I don't mind telling you I hate
[1:42:26] that cancer devil I said I hate that
[1:42:29] cancer devil come on children oh brother
[1:42:32] Donnie i' be afraid to say anything I'm
[1:42:34] afraid not to because I believe we are
[1:42:37] called as the army of God to stand
[1:42:40] against Satan and every demon Out of
[1:42:43] Hell in the day that we live
[1:42:49] in
[1:42:51] I've told you before and I'll tell you
[1:42:52] again as a reminder there is not one
[1:42:55] person in medical
[1:42:57] history that has ever been cured and
[1:43:00] healed of neuroendocrine
[1:43:04] tumor what Erica's
[1:43:09] fighting but the way I look at it there
[1:43:12] won't be one devil that'll ever walk
[1:43:14] Before the Throne of God and said you
[1:43:17] got that one and you got that one and
[1:43:19] you got that one and you got that one
[1:43:21] but there was never never any of your
[1:43:23] children that ever conquered me that
[1:43:26] ain't my
[1:43:27] father well the way I look at it why not
[1:43:30] for her to be the first one well you say
[1:43:32] ain't nobody ever been where I'm at well
[1:43:34] why don't you be the first
[1:43:37] one Hallelujah why not let you there had
[1:43:41] never been a virgin that ever conceived
[1:43:44] but Mary said be it unto me be it un me
[1:43:48] according to Thy word Lord let it be me
[1:43:53] let it happen to me Lord
[1:44:00] God
[1:44:02] hallelujah
[1:44:05] [Applause]
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:19] hallelujah
[1:44:21] but you lose all thought of Freedom as
[1:44:24] soon as the doctor
[1:44:25] says it's in
[1:44:30] curable Prophet goes on in this same
[1:44:32] sermon to say why brother if we'd ever
[1:44:35] come in the presence of God like Moses
[1:44:37] did it was a revolutionary to
[1:44:40] him it was a revolutionary to him why it
[1:44:44] would
[1:44:45] revolutionize in the light of that angel
[1:44:48] of God standing there on the Mountain
[1:44:51] that day everything that he once had or
[1:44:55] thought never would happen come to be a
[1:45:07] reality
[1:45:09] hallelujah sister Judy Archer they've
[1:45:11] diagnosed her with a very rare form of
[1:45:15] cancer only a few thousand people a year
[1:45:18] ever diagnosed with it much
[1:45:21] nope good prognosis nope not from the
[1:45:27] doctors but whose report will we
[1:45:33] believe
[1:45:35] hallelujah oh that's nice whenever they
[1:45:37] say yeah we've got this pill and we've
[1:45:39] got this and that and we're having 87%
[1:45:41] success rate but you and I know enough
[1:45:43] about that medication to know if one of
[1:45:45] themselves hides it'll come back again
[1:45:47] in four years or five years or whatever
[1:45:50] but if the Lord God can send the laser
[1:45:52] light of the revealed word and it goes
[1:45:55] down inside that's the way I pray not
[1:45:57] only for Erica but for sister Judy and
[1:46:00] whoever else is dealing with that I know
[1:46:02] of Lord made the pillar of fire go
[1:46:04] inside their body and annihilate every
[1:46:07] one of those cancer cells May everything
[1:46:11] be restored like it
[1:46:13] [Applause]
[1:46:19] was
[1:46:22] or I can come out this
[1:46:25] morning and say

[1:46:51] you I feel sorry for it's that's the
[1:46:54] kind of Pastor you
[1:46:56] got but I want to be the kind of man in
[1:46:58] the middle of the battle I
[1:47:02] can put down the standard of the Lord
[1:47:05] and said here is where we stand on God's
[1:47:10] promise of his word hallelujah I will
[1:47:13] not bring upon you the plagues that was
[1:47:16] on the Egyptian but I am the Lord thy
[1:47:19] God that he seee of all thy diseases

[1:49:09] hallelujah let me tell you this and
[1:49:11] share this with you before I
[1:49:14] close I told Lance this the other day I
[1:49:16] said
[1:49:17] Lance if the Lord God would speak to me
[1:49:20] and say I give you Authority
[1:49:24] today to speak to that
[1:49:27] devil and make him
[1:49:30] leave
[1:49:32] but it would bring me more honor and
[1:49:36] glory for it to go on another six
[1:49:43] months I hope you folks know whatever
[1:49:46] would
[1:49:49] do
[1:49:52] I would do what our lord Jesus
[1:49:56] done when he said don't you know I could
[1:49:58] pray to my father right now and he would
[1:50:01] send 12 Legions of
[1:50:03] angels to deliver
[1:50:06] me when he goes into the garden down and
[1:50:09] praying weeping
[1:50:12] crying
[1:50:14] father if it be th will let this cup
[1:50:17] pass from
[1:50:18] me never
[1:50:20] thess not my
[1:50:23] will but th be done can you imagine if
[1:50:25] God gave you the authority to change the
[1:50:28] situation today and it was so
[1:50:32] horrendous but he let you know it'll
[1:50:34] bring him more
[1:50:36] Glory there's another doctor that needs
[1:50:38] to testify it's hopeless there's another
[1:50:41] scan that needs to be made I can't wait
[1:50:43] till we can put all these scans up
[1:50:48] here hallelujah
[1:50:57] what about it
[1:50:59] Church you see we're talking about the
[1:51:01] third pole and preaching about the third
[1:51:02] pole preaching about great things is
[1:51:04] going to happen and great things is
[1:51:05] going to happen well if you'll follow
[1:51:07] what the prophet said and God called man
[1:51:08] 1958 you'll find that the prophet said
[1:51:11] God was training and teaching and
[1:51:12] schooling men to get ready for the
[1:51:14] Revival that's going to hit the
[1:51:17] church but he's got to have man that he
[1:51:19] can take to the back out of the desert
[1:51:21] and crush
[1:51:22] them crush them sir till they become
[1:51:27] instruments so in his hands that they
[1:51:29] will not
[1:51:31] speak until they know it's his
[1:51:34] will you see Moses had Authority and he
[1:51:37] could strike that rock the second
[1:51:40] time and totally broke every type of the
[1:51:45] scripture is that
[1:51:48] right testified against the work of the
[1:51:53] cross in order to magnify himself Christ
[1:51:57] only has to be Shar once but Moses got
[1:52:00] in his anger and his temper In the Flesh
[1:52:03] and smoked the rock twice God said speak
[1:52:05] to it don't Smite Christ
[1:52:08] again but brother R using that typ and
[1:52:10] said he spoke of every denomination that
[1:52:12] would ever
[1:52:14] come God wants people who have
[1:52:18] character to match
[1:52:23] power anybody here want to be that type
[1:52:26] of
[1:52:28] person let Stand
[1:52:36] Together the prophet in Israel and the
[1:52:38] church he said this has been the
[1:52:39] greatest thing that I found among
[1:52:40] Christian people throughout the entire
[1:52:44] world has been a fear they're always
[1:52:48] afraid and when a little sickness
[1:52:51] strikes they're afraid and many I wonder
[1:52:54] sometimes and now I'm along with you now
[1:52:57] I'm along with you but now what I'm
[1:53:00] trying to do tonight and then this week
[1:53:02] to come is to try to drive that fear
[1:53:07] Away by God's
[1:53:11] word again he says un Parable sin having
[1:53:14] therefore Brethren boldness to enter
[1:53:15] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[1:53:17] think of it no fear that's the greatest
[1:53:21] plague that there is in the Christian
[1:53:24] church
[1:53:25] today wow you mean greater than
[1:53:28] cancer greater than migraine headaches
[1:53:31] and greater than all these other things
[1:53:34] the greatest plague on the Christian
[1:53:37] church today
[1:53:41] fear and the reason they're
[1:53:43] afraid is because they're not taught
[1:53:48] right and settled
[1:53:51] right on the
[1:53:56] gospel may God help
[1:53:59] us how many wants to live a life
[1:54:02] above ungodly fear
[1:54:05] [Music]
[1:54:09] amen hallelujah thank you Lord let's
[1:54:13] sing that song that you
[1:54:16] sary let just B hits if you would today
[1:54:19] we're going to
[1:54:23] pray how many would be honest before the
[1:54:26] Lord today and say Lord I believe these
[1:54:27] things I've heard but I need help with
[1:54:29] them Jesus I need
[1:54:32] help my hands is up too friends oh sure
[1:54:36] the devil you better believe the devil
[1:54:38] tries to bring all kinds of fears my
[1:54:41] way I'm just like you don't look at me
[1:54:44] as some type of Superman I'm not no
[1:54:47] Superman just another or ordinary human
[1:54:50] being trying to make Heaven my
[1:54:56] home heavenly father as we have our
[1:54:59] heads bowed to the dust of the
[1:55:02] earth we call upon your name today Lord
[1:55:08] Jesus from preaching on fear Sunday
[1:55:12] before
[1:55:13] last it was evident to see by the phone
[1:55:17] calls texts emails WhatsApp all the
[1:55:20] different lines of communication that I
[1:55:23] received from different parts of the
[1:55:25] world it was something that was so
[1:55:28] needful Lord we'll be honest
[1:55:31] today and say we need help
[1:55:34] Father we're
[1:55:38] humans you let us still have the emotion
[1:55:40] of fear that's not a
[1:55:43] sin but far be it from us to live under
[1:55:46] the spirit of
[1:55:48] fear many of them I saw it on their face
[1:55:50] and I was describing that demon and that
[1:55:56] meeting and they didn't want nothing to
[1:55:58] do with that I could see it all over
[1:56:00] their face they wanted nothing to do
[1:56:01] with
[1:56:02] that but what about the spirit of
[1:56:05] fear they look at it the same
[1:56:08] way that was a doctrine that was a
[1:56:11] move some of them years ago here were
[1:56:14] identified around that
[1:56:17] move but it's pretty much a dead anymore
[1:56:20] so there's not much we have to fear
[1:56:22] about it but fear is Alive and
[1:56:26] Well we do not want to be a
[1:56:30] host we know there's many hosts even in
[1:56:34] nature ticks all kinds of little fish
[1:56:39] Barnacles all types of things in the
[1:56:43] ocean we can see the mightiest whale in
[1:56:47] the oceans and look at them and
[1:56:50] they have been attacked by all types of
[1:56:53] little things and their body becomes a
[1:56:57] host to these
[1:57:00] creatures Lord may we pass through your
[1:57:03] great scan
[1:57:05] today Jesus may you begin with
[1:57:09] me may I pass through your great scan of
[1:57:13] the
[1:57:15] word if you find that I'm a host to
[1:57:17] anything father
[1:57:20] that's displeasing to
[1:57:22] you help me Lord
[1:57:25] God I don't want to host evil I don't
[1:57:28] want to be a host of
[1:57:30] wrong I don't want to be a host of Pride
[1:57:33] or
[1:57:35] arrogance neither do I want to be a host
[1:57:38] to the spirit of
[1:57:41] fear because if Satan can get preachers
[1:57:44] to be a host then everywhere they go and
[1:57:47] preach they have the ability of sharing
[1:57:50] that same
[1:57:53] spirit so they drop a little thing here
[1:57:55] and a little thing there it didn't seem
[1:57:58] like much but it was the spirit of fear
[1:58:01] on that
[1:58:02] preacher and he Dro it in this
[1:58:04] congregation then he went to Indiana and
[1:58:06] preached and then he went to Georgia and
[1:58:07] preached and then he went to Florida and
[1:58:09] preached and then the pastor of that
[1:58:11] assembly finds himself dealing with
[1:58:13] these things you wonder what in the
[1:58:15] world it was because he had a host
[1:58:18] preacher in the pulpit that was a host
[1:58:21] of
[1:58:23] Fear oh Lord God I want my body my soul
[1:58:26] my gift my mind my strength to be a host
[1:58:31] to the Holy
[1:58:35] Ghost hallelujah how many of you Saints
[1:58:38] say the same thing can you just raise
[1:58:41] your hands up as a sign of surrender
[1:58:44] we're going to host
[1:58:45] something let us host the Holy Ghost
[1:58:51] oh Jesus instead of being a host of Fear
[1:58:55] may I be a host of
[1:58:58] Deliverance instead of being a host of
[1:59:02] anxiety may I be a host of
[1:59:05] peace and deliverance Lord
[1:59:08] God instead of being a host of a
[1:59:11] gossiping
[1:59:12] Spirit may I be a host of the spirit of
[1:59:16] truth hallelujah hallelujah
[1:59:20] oh Jesus we worship you today
[1:59:24] Father Hallelujah in the name of
[1:59:27] Jesus Lord I I know it hit that a bit
[1:59:32] ago father I felt it surg
[1:59:37] there from the quote of losing the side
[1:59:40] of
[1:59:42] freedom I saw the looks on some of their
[1:59:46] faces for some of his anxiety for some
[1:59:49] it was the solid truth that hit them
[1:59:51] Square in the
[1:59:52] face they realized they had been
[1:59:55] arrested by the presence of
[1:59:59] God and even though they were praying
[2:00:01] for Freedom they had lost all sight of
[2:00:06] it it only took a few hours for every
[2:00:09] Israelite to finally leave Egypt that
[2:00:13] day two million Jews would have been
[2:00:15] able to walk out pretty good speed no
[2:00:18] doubt in a matter of hours every
[2:00:22] Israelite was gone out of
[2:00:23] Egypt but it's evident it took years to
[2:00:28] get Egypt out of the
[2:00:32] Israelites oh Father Deliver
[2:00:36] Us from the spirit of
[2:00:41] fear
[2:00:43] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:00:48] hallelujah
[2:00:49] I'm sorry
[2:00:54] Father I'm sure those that was here
[2:00:57] Wednesday night week
[2:00:59] ago they saw me laying on this
[2:01:03] Altar and they wondered what was wrong
[2:01:05] with
[2:01:09] me as I went back into the office
[2:01:12] Lord and your presence was still
[2:01:17] there and I had to ask you to forgive me
[2:01:20] for
[2:01:22] something it wasn't drinking smoking
[2:01:25] lying running around with somebody
[2:01:26] else's
[2:01:32] wife but it was the
[2:01:35] fear of me totally giving everything
[2:01:38] that I
[2:01:39] am into your
[2:01:42] presence
[2:01:45] afraid
[2:01:47] afraid I dare
[2:01:50] say I'm not the only one
[2:01:53] Lord help us to lay aside our pride her
[2:01:59] arrogance I've seen so many preachers
[2:02:02] mess up
[2:02:03] Lord I don't want to be another one I've
[2:02:06] seen so many preachers bring reproach
[2:02:09] upon the cause because they did this or
[2:02:11] that or the
[2:02:14] other and it's hindered
[2:02:17] me but Lord God I made up my mind laying
[2:02:21] on that floor the other night by your
[2:02:24] help I will
[2:02:27] never do it
[2:02:30] again I am
[2:02:34] yours to use for whatever you
[2:02:38] desire speak through me live through
[2:02:42] me
[2:02:45] Hallelujah I don't know how much more
[2:02:47] time I've got left but I want every
[2:02:50] moment I have to belong to you I want
[2:02:54] every hour every day every week every
[2:02:57] month every year that I have left to be
[2:03:00] yielded as an
[2:03:02] instrument of the Holy
[2:03:06] Ghost help me
[2:03:09] Jesus help me Jesus to surrender my
[2:03:13] mouth my mind my
[2:03:17] being
[2:03:19] anybody here with me today and say well
[2:03:21] brother Don to be honest I I have to say
[2:03:24] I'm I've been the same
[2:03:26] way but I want to give him
[2:03:28] everything anybody here with me just
[2:03:31] raise your hand to
[2:03:34] God
[2:03:37] hallelujah oh
[2:03:39] Jesus what could be done here at this
[2:03:43] place if we can all be this
[2:03:47] Lord there's been times you've spoke to
[2:03:50] me to tell people things
[2:03:52] that I've not done it that's what I'm
[2:03:56] referring to you know what I mean but
[2:03:58] just so they'll understand
[2:04:00] better there's been times I haven't
[2:04:04] obeyed
[2:04:06] you and I'm
[2:04:08] sorry not so much in my preaching
[2:04:10] because I preach when it got me throwed
[2:04:14] out but it's just that further one more
[2:04:18] step
[2:04:19] that I need to
[2:04:21] take
[2:04:24] Hallelujah I believe Lord God what your
[2:04:27] Prophet has said to us in the last
[2:04:30] days that you're calling sons of God

[2:15:43] in the Krueger National Park in South
[2:15:47] Africa

[2:16:54] fear and
[2:16:56] Trauma that's normal to fear with that

[2:19:15] Jesus possible
[2:19:18] [Music]
[2:19:24] Lord let me just share a little
[2:19:26] something with you before I let you go I
[2:19:29] got a text this week from one of our
[2:19:30] brothers here at the church and I won't
[2:19:31] call his name because I don't want
[2:19:33] embarrass
[2:19:34] him but he said Brother Don he said I'd
[2:19:39] kind of like to be like them men that
[2:19:41] day that brought that man to
[2:19:45] Jesus and he said then man brought the
[2:19:48] man to Jesus they couldn't get in so
[2:19:52] they begin to tear the roof off of the
[2:19:54] house and let the man
[2:19:58] down and he said that's what I I want to
[2:20:01] do for sister
[2:20:04] Erica so it been a while since I read
[2:20:06] that scripture so I pulled it up and
[2:20:08] looked at
[2:20:09] it and the Bible says when Jesus saw
[2:20:13] their
[2:20:14] face he turned to the sick of the Pauli
[2:20:17] and said
[2:20:19] Son thy
[2:20:21] sins be forgiven
[2:20:26] thee didn't mention nothing about that
[2:20:28] man's
[2:20:29] Faith but their
[2:20:31] faith can you imagine the Lord Jesus saw
[2:20:34] the faith of these men and tore the roof
[2:20:36] off of Peter's house his history says
[2:20:40] tore the roof off of Peter's house and
[2:20:43] Jesus looked at their face and said I'm
[2:20:46] going to forgive your
[2:20:48] sins because they
[2:20:52] believed praise be to God don't never
[2:20:56] underestimate the power of prayer and
[2:21:00] the power of your faith in God's word to
[2:21:03] even move for other
[2:21:05] people I heard brother Ron Spencer say
[2:21:08] it last night I listened to a little bit
[2:21:09] of the service down at brother Tims as I
[2:21:11] was studying and he mentioned along this
[2:21:14] line and he said don't ever
[2:21:15] underestimate the power of prayer maybe
[2:21:17] some of you heard it and he said Moses
[2:21:20] stood there at the Red Sea and prayed
[2:21:22] and was faithful to God and God turned
[2:21:25] the Egyptians into fish
[2:21:30] food leave it to brother Ron to come up
[2:21:32] with such a
[2:21:34] statement the power of prayer for one
[2:21:38] man don't you love him today
[2:21:41] Saints praise the Lord how many can say
[2:21:44] we've got victory in the camp
[2:21:47] [Applause]
