[21:00] hallelujah
[21:03] i know it's so hard on you children i
[21:05] have to get out and go a little bit and
[21:07] when i wear one i tell carol i'm out in
[21:09] the world people make it she said you
[21:11] ought to wear one as you can imagine me
[21:13] wearing one preaching
[21:17] i'm so sorry we've had to
[21:20] genesis 15 13.
[21:24] i mean he wants to get in the spirit
[21:25] tonight
[21:29] and he said unto abram
[21:32] know of assurity that thy seed shall be
[21:34] a stranger in a land that is not theirs
[21:38] and shall serve them
[21:41] and they shall afflict them
[21:43] 400
[21:44] years
[21:46] and also that nation whom
[21:48] they shall serve
[21:50] will i judge
[21:52] and afterward shall they
[21:54] come out
[21:56] with great substance now this is god's
[21:59] word
[22:00] and he's going to take somebody to prove
[22:03] it by
[22:05] verse 15 and thou shalt go
[22:08] to thy fathers
[22:10] in peace thou shalt be buried
[22:14] in a good old age
[22:16] but in the fourth generation
[22:20] they shall come hither again
[22:23] for the iniquity
[22:25] of the amorites
[22:27] is not yet full
[22:29] and he believes god has a time and a
[22:31] season for his word
[22:33] to be fulfilled
[22:35] now it's not only just a time for the
[22:38] righteous
[22:39] and the good but as we can see from this
[22:41] scripture that there's also a time that
[22:44] the evil must be filled let me read you
[22:48] this in question and answers in 1954
[22:51] we've got to get in the spirit of the
[22:54] last days
[22:55] when the last days are here
[22:58] you go to a dance hall
[23:00] and you've got to get in the spirit
[23:03] of dancing
[23:04] or
[23:05] they won't dance
[23:07] now i've never been to a dance hall so i
[23:09] don't know anything about them
[23:11] but i do remember talking to a man that
[23:13] used to come to church here years ago
[23:15] and
[23:17] i'd talk to him and talk to him and talk
[23:18] to him about the lord and try to make it
[23:20] so simple and i'd spend two and a half
[23:22] hours with him on the phone and after
[23:24] i'd get done with him he still
[23:27] wasn't sure if the lord loved him and
[23:28] all this rigamaroad anyway finally he
[23:31] finally come out and just told me that
[23:33] he really really had a problem i said
[23:36] well what what is it he said i love to
[23:39] get on that dance floor and start
[23:42] dancing
[23:44] now in my mind i thought
[23:46] i can't hardly believe this because i
[23:48] knew that guy very well and i thought i
[23:50] cannot imagine you
[23:52] on the dance floor
[23:54] but apparently there was something about
[23:57] dancing
[23:58] that had such a grip on him
[24:00] that he couldn't let go of dancing to
[24:04] let go of the lord and i simply told him
[24:05] look man all you need to do
[24:08] is change partners
[24:13] we're not against dancing we're just
[24:15] against dancing with the devil's tombs
[24:18] right
[24:20] but it shows that there's a spirit that
[24:23] goes with dancing with drinking with
[24:25] many of these things
[24:27] he said you go to church
[24:29] and you've got to get in the spirit of
[24:30] worship before you can worship
[24:34] the world's got to get in the spirit of
[24:35] the last days
[24:37] before the last days
[24:39] can come
[24:41] and we're in the spirit
[24:43] of the last days now this is 1954
[24:47] what about now 2021 almost 2022
[24:52] and god's promise that these things
[24:54] would be here and that's what we've got
[24:56] where in the last days and men and women
[25:00] are setting asleep
[25:02] and don't realize it
[25:05] oh my don't let it be me lord
[25:08] let's pray together
[25:11] lord jesus we love you so much tonight
[25:13] we're so glad to be back together again
[25:16] father
[25:17] we just love church
[25:20] i'm not talking about the formality of
[25:23] just gathering together as some type of
[25:26] social something church is not a social
[25:29] event to us
[25:31] it's a place where we worship and we
[25:34] sing
[25:35] and we pray
[25:36] and we hear testimonies of what you've
[25:38] done
[25:39] and we make our requests known and we
[25:42] sense that great mighty god that we're
[25:45] going to see
[25:47] is with us
[25:48] we so long lord jesus
[25:51] to be together in your presence
[25:53] we thank you for this opportunity again

[25:59] speak to us father would you make your
[26:01] word real the needs of your people were
[26:03] asking you lord that you just be mindful
[26:06] father god
[26:08] lord i've got a brother on my heart
[26:10] tonight and
[26:12] i don't want to say

[27:38] quotes
[27:39] that the prophet was talking about the
[27:42] spirit of this and the spirit of that
[27:44] the spirit of god the spirit of the lord
[27:46] the spirit of blindness the spirit of
[27:48] darkness the spirit of the last days
[27:51] spirit of the last times on and on and
[27:54] on and on
[27:56] over 3 500 times
[27:59] in the message that it was mentioned and
[28:01] i found
[28:02] so many that were quite overwhelming of
[28:06] what actually has a spirit that goes
[28:10] along with it so there was a spirit of
[28:12] fear
[28:13] a spirit of joy a spirit of love
[28:17] a spirit of happiness so many different
[28:20] things that was connected with a spirit
[28:24] and then i found where he had made
[28:27] reference to the book of ephesians where
[28:29] that paul had said by the holy spirit of
[28:33] promise
[28:34] and then i begin to realize that god
[28:37] not only has a spirit that motivates his
[28:41] people but the devil also being a spirit
[28:44] being and satan has
[28:47] all types of spirits which are demons
[28:50] that motivate his people and we know
[28:53] that the spirit of blindness that would
[28:56] grab a hold of a optical nerve and the
[29:00] prophet rebuked that several times and
[29:02] he would speak to that demon and he said
[29:05] thou demon that has a hold of that
[29:09] optical nerve
[29:11] and then he would command it to let go
[29:13] then he would speak also to another
[29:16] demon apparently a different one in the
[29:19] form of cataracts
[29:22] and then he would call that demon so as
[29:25] i begin to look at that i realize how
[29:28] diversified that the kingdom of darkness
[29:31] really is and how that satan chooses so
[29:34] many different aspects to be able to
[29:37] manifest himself because he is a spirit
[29:40] being so we can see why that the world
[29:43] actually cannot enter into the fullness
[29:46] of the last days until the lid has been
[29:51] tore off of hell and it would allow
[29:54] demon spirits to be able to pour out in
[29:58] every direction so we know when all hell
[30:01] breaks loose all of heaven comes down
[30:04] so it's a parallel i believe where we
[30:07] are don't you
[30:08] so god you know god knew that this would
[30:12] happen so it didn't take him by surprise
[30:15] at all and god knew that the people in
[30:18] the days prior to the anti-living
[30:21] destruction that before that time could
[30:24] come god could not make it come upon the
[30:27] earth because god is not the officer of
[30:29] sin sickness disease trouble heartache
[30:33] but it's as if so that god allows satan
[30:36] a release in time by which he's able to
[30:40] anoint his people and anoint the people
[30:44] of the world in a way that they hadn't
[30:46] been anointed quite before
[30:49] and something comes upon the earth as if
[30:53] hell begins to vomit out or something
[30:57] comes out from the gates of hell now
[31:01] keep this in mind the gates of hell that
[31:04] something begins to release from the
[31:07] gates of hell remember it was an angel
[31:11] there that had them bound in revelation
[31:14] as we see it and whenever there was a
[31:17] great chain that was released and a key
[31:20] that unlocked and when it did smoke a
[31:22] rose out of the bottomless pit and
[31:26] apollyon and abaddon being his name the
[31:30] greek and it released one
[31:32] out of this prison which was held
[31:35] captive there so we can see by these
[31:37] intervals that god does not let satan
[31:40] move as he wishes he cannot be able to
[31:44] go upon the earth even as he so desires
[31:48] remember in the book of job and god
[31:49] asked him where have you been he said
[31:51] walking up and down the earth seeking
[31:53] whom i may devour being able to do what
[31:55] he can so even then we see that he must
[31:58] seek he must actually seek out what he
[32:02] can do he must find avenues resource
[32:07] channels by which he can flow through it
[32:09] so he doesn't just have free course at
[32:12] any time now this convinces me that a
[32:15] lot of times the things that you and i
[32:17] allow to go on our lives it's not that
[32:20] satan had the power to do it he was
[32:24] watching us and waiting for a moment of
[32:27] weakness
[32:29] that he could not do it at will he could
[32:32] not do it just because he hates you and
[32:35] he certainly does but don't you know
[32:37] that if he had the power to do against
[32:40] us at leisure all of us would done be
[32:43] dead don't you believe all the real
[32:45] saints of god would then be wiped off
[32:48] the earth so sometimes god allows him to
[32:51] come against us and i'm convinced more
[32:54] than we realize that sometimes we allow
[32:57] him to come against us and it's not so
[33:01] much that it's necessarily the will of
[33:03] god but in the moment of weakness when
[33:05] we've not prayed when we've not really
[33:07] been where we ought to be with the lord
[33:09] and satan will watch us in that time of
[33:13] weakness you know as it happened to all
[33:14] of us but it ought to make us as the
[33:17] children of god want to be more alert
[33:19] more aware and more conscience of our
[33:23] stand in the truth that satan cannot
[33:26] come and push us over just any time he
[33:29] wishes to but there is an allocation of
[33:33] demonic warfare that has been released
[33:36] in every age and we know that actually
[33:39] the world wars followed the
[33:41] administration of the release of god we
[33:44] can look down through the church ages as
[33:46] god sent a message and it was the blast
[33:49] of a gospel trumpet and when you look
[33:51] whenever that trumpet reverberated
[33:54] across the earth and you'll watch the
[33:56] wars the napoleonic wars and you'll
[33:58] watch the wars in europe following actor
[34:01] luther's reformation and you watch and
[34:03] the reformation under wesley and you
[34:06] watch wars as they begin to break out
[34:09] and it's actually because the gospel
[34:12] trumpet has sounded and it has declared
[34:14] a war then you watch the natural wars
[34:18] and the plagues that will follow
[34:20] whenever that happens you ever study on
[34:22] the plagues and how they parallel to the
[34:24] release of the messages of god down
[34:27] through the church ages you think it
[34:28] just happened to be that the bubonic
[34:31] plague and many of these things just
[34:32] happened at leisure but notice how that
[34:35] after the message of god strikes the
[34:37] earth and the light of god comes on the
[34:40] earth and the people reject it then
[34:42] watch what happens all types of calamity
[34:46] and diseases and all sorts of things
[34:49] will happen to the inhabitants of the
[34:51] earth wake up america
[34:54] wake up message people
[34:56] don't you understand one of the things
[34:57] we're going to right now is part of the
[35:00] finale of the rejection of the world
[35:03] against the message of the end time
[35:07] now let me tell you right now you think
[35:09] covet is bad covet is nothing compared
[35:12] to what's fixing to come
[35:14] we are still under the dispensation of
[35:17] the grace of god if satan is allowed to
[35:21] do all that has been done just under
[35:24] covet itself under the rainbow of the
[35:27] blood of the lord jesus covering the
[35:29] earth then i want you to contemplate for
[35:32] a few minutes what it's going to be like
[35:34] when the lord lifts the bride off the
[35:37] earth and the blood is removed from the
[35:40] mercy seat there will not be one more
[35:43] gentile that will be saved and the bible
[35:46] says whoa whoa whoa and to the
[35:49] inhabiters of the earth for the devil
[35:51] has come down unto them and he knows
[35:55] that he has but a short time to work
[35:58] i'll tell you one thing i don't want to
[36:00] be here and i'll tell you one thing you
[36:03] don't want to be here either
[36:05] if it's bad right now and we've seen all
[36:08] this went on in the last year and a half
[36:10] for soul what will it be once the lord
[36:13] jesus takes away his sweetheart out of
[36:16] this earth and the devil is allowed the
[36:19] full strength of his dominion to
[36:22] manifest all he's wanted to do for
[36:24] thousands of years hi to so rock of ages
[36:29] but you know we don't want to just focus
[36:31] on the negative side and we know the
[36:33] negativity must also be preached in
[36:36] order to magnify the greatness of the
[36:38] positive side of what god is doing but
[36:41] what we want to look at tonight is that
[36:44] we must get in the spirit of the word
[36:46] the the
[36:47] allotment or the increment of the word
[36:50] that god has allocated for us and if
[36:53] satan cannot stop you as a believer from
[36:56] embracing the message of the hour and
[36:59] you believe it with all your heart your
[37:00] soul your mind your strength if he
[37:02] cannot make you deny this word and say
[37:05] well i'm not following no more then he
[37:08] will try other tactics to get you to
[37:11] change your focus of what's really so
[37:13] important in this life he'll cause so
[37:16] many troubles in our homes troubles on
[37:19] the job troubles and our church troubles
[37:22] around us everywhere so that we by our
[37:25] troubles devalue not intentionally but
[37:28] we devalue what we are setting under and
[37:32] that is the impact of the reveal word of
[37:35] the hour
[37:36] are we having trouble search sure we are
[37:39] are we having problems are we having
[37:41] issues sure we are but our god is
[37:44] greater than our issues
[37:47] our god is greater than everything that
[37:50] we are going through
[37:52] and the church said
[37:54] why because he told us greater is he
[37:57] that is in you than he that is in the
[38:00] world now sometimes god will say his
[38:03] word and he will let it lay there for
[38:05] years in this case it's going to be the
[38:07] fourth generation 430 years after god
[38:11] tells him this and abraham you're not
[38:13] going to see it but it will be your seed
[38:15] and god even tells them bad things are
[38:17] going to happen to your children bad
[38:19] things are going to happen to your seed
[38:22] and i'm going to go ahead and warn you
[38:23] he said this nation that does this to
[38:25] them i will punish them now god's got to
[38:28] have somebody to fulfill this word
[38:32] god is not speaking of cherubims he's
[38:35] not speaking of an angelic host but god
[38:38] is speaking of human beings human beings
[38:40] that are worthy of his word no let me
[38:43] tell you tonight all the heroes of god
[38:46] that have lived down through time there
[38:48] has not been a one of them that has been
[38:51] worthy of the grace or the blessing or
[38:54] the things of god so some of you fight
[38:57] this that you're unworthy and you're
[38:58] unworthy will join the rest of us
[39:01] unworthy mortals because there ain't
[39:04] none of us worthy of the grace of god
[39:06] the goodness of god the power of god
[39:09] that's why it's grace because god gives
[39:13] it to us it is unmerited favor
[39:18] now watch god unveils his revelation to
[39:21] abram and now he changes his name in
[39:24] chapter 22 of course into abraham
[39:27] genesis 22 15 and the angel of the lord
[39:30] called unto abraham out of heaven the
[39:33] second time and said by myself have i
[39:36] sworn saith the lord notice now this was
[39:38] the angel of the capital l capital o
[39:41] capital r capital d the angel of the
[39:44] lord which was christ theophany
[39:47] pre-existence form of the lord jesus
[39:50] before a human appearance and the angel
[39:52] of the lord coloned abraham out of
[39:54] heaven saying the second time and said
[39:56] by myself i have sworn so this angel is
[40:00] the very person of god or it is the
[40:03] personage of god taking on a form that
[40:06] can deal with human beings saith the
[40:08] lord for because thou hast done this
[40:11] thing that is not withheld thyme sun thy
[40:13] an only son that in blessing i will
[40:16] bless thee and in multiplying i will
[40:19] multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven
[40:21] and as the sand which is upon the
[40:23] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[40:28] gate of his enemies now again this is a
[40:32] promise and god is going to use mortals
[40:36] not angels but human beings to fulfill
[40:40] his word
[40:41] now i hope you understand tonight this
[40:44] promise of genesis 22 17
[40:48] is still just as present and ongoing as
[40:53] it was when the theophanic appearance of
[40:56] christ appeared to abraham thousands of
[41:00] years ago
[41:02] now the promised nature was made in the
[41:04] first happened sense of it into the
[41:06] natural seed of abraham but now we have
[41:09] excelled and went beyond the natural
[41:11] genealogy of abraham and we are the
[41:15] spiritual seed of abraham from dust to
[41:18] stars
[41:19] amen so our destiny is coming back from
[41:21] stars to dust because we come from there
[41:23] we'll come back here and take up perfect
[41:25] bodies and thy seed shall possess the
[41:28] gate of his enemies now watch there's a
[41:31] great parallel that lays in this
[41:34] terminology that the angel of the lord
[41:36] or christ michael had now spoke and he
[41:39] said thy seed shall possess the gate of
[41:42] his enemies once you notice that it's
[41:44] all gathered up it doesn't say they
[41:47] not they but they shall possess the gate
[41:50] of his enemies so it's gathered in the
[41:53] personal pronoun now i realize we're
[41:55] living in a woke generation and we're
[41:58] living in a generation when people don't
[42:00] like his and her and one of our states
[42:02] yesterday just passed the law to where
[42:05] that you know you don't have to be
[42:06] either a male or a female as far as
[42:09] gender but you can put it on all your
[42:11] official documents and congress of
[42:13] course wanted to get rid of he and her
[42:15] and congressman and congresswoman and
[42:17] make them just a neutral saying well i
[42:20] may be a little bit old-fashioned but i
[42:21] still believe god knows the difference
[42:24] between men and women
[42:25] now i realize a lot of the blind way of
[42:28] the sins are so blind that they can look
[42:30] at what looks like a woman but they
[42:32] don't want to call it a woman and they
[42:34] look at what looks like a man but they
[42:36] don't want to call it a hymn because
[42:38] they don't want to offend nobody well i
[42:40] i don't want to offend somebody but it's
[42:43] the right body and if i've got to offend
[42:45] you to keep from offending him well you
[42:48] know the rest of the story but we know
[42:50] how the world is they don't want to
[42:52] offend anybody out there yeah i'll see
[42:55] who you don't want to offend you don't
[42:57] want to film these bunch of men that
[42:58] goes around kissing men and women that
[43:01] kisses women and they got their hair
[43:03] green and purple and polka dots drops
[43:06] and they look like something to come out
[43:08] of the insane institution but you don't
[43:10] care to offend us only once it's got a
[43:13] right mind you don't care to life about
[43:16] us and make fun of us come on now if you
[43:18] don't want to offend somebody take this
[43:21] practice and don't offend the salt of
[43:23] the earth because when the salt's taken
[43:25] this thing's going to turn into a big
[43:27] mess
[43:28] [Applause]
[43:33] you see this is the secret to this verse
[43:36] he who possessed the gates is he who
[43:40] possessed the city
[43:42] he who possessed the gates possessed the
[43:46] cities he who possessed the cities
[43:49] possess the country so your god is
[43:53] giving them a promise that shows them
[43:56] whatever gates that will come against
[43:59] you in your conquest to take this land
[44:03] i will give you those gates now in the
[44:07] old testament many of those gates of
[44:09] course were natural gates and it was a
[44:11] parable of what would be a type of us
[44:14] and what our spiritual gates are and
[44:16] many of us have gates tonight many of
[44:18] you've got gates in your life that's
[44:20] trying to hinder you from a full
[44:22] procession of what god wants you to have
[44:25] but this is your promise you might as
[44:28] well go and put your name in there and
[44:30] the angel of the lord said to dave
[44:32] swanson or the angel of the lord said to
[44:35] jackie tipton or to carol or wade or
[44:38] anne or whoever more and you've got to
[44:41] take this promise as personal as it is
[44:44] to yourself you've got a sickness in
[44:46] front of you and is trying to wall off
[44:49] the blessing of god you need to walk
[44:51] right up to that gate as a son of god or
[44:54] a daughter of god and say gate out of my
[44:57] way
[44:58] hallelujah notice this brother ben says
[45:01] notice god said your seed the seed of
[45:03] abraham would possess the gates of his
[45:06] enemy he would take the gates and
[45:08] possess the gates he promised it now his
[45:11] natural seed did all of that all of
[45:14] abraham's natural seed was the prophets
[45:16] that came after him so there was moses
[45:19] abraham's seat and when he did he came
[45:22] to the gate in a line of duty he come to
[45:26] the gate of the red sea now watch how he
[45:29] takes this so moses comes to the gate of
[45:33] a red sea now he's at the gulf of aqaba
[45:36] and whenever you look at this new place
[45:38] that they just scientifically found just
[45:40] a few years ago it looks like only one
[45:43] particular place by which they could
[45:45] come down the way of horror and be able
[45:46] to cross down the described way i'm not
[45:49] sure if you know it or not but there's
[45:50] actually a message preacher that helped
[45:52] the land of israel several years ago
[45:55] find the proper place where jesus was
[45:58] baptized in the river jordan this man
[46:00] has been there for many many years he's
[46:02] the brother actually we went was on our
[46:04] lady's show a couple years ago to israel
[46:06] and he kept telling the god that he
[46:08] would have been there been many many
[46:09] trips he kept telling them y'all got the
[46:11] wrong place you've got the wrong place
[46:14] jesus was baptized where moses and them
[46:17] came across and he went back to the
[46:19] scripture and kept showing them it's the
[46:21] wrong place but the last time we was
[46:23] there we got to stand at the right place
[46:26] and you can imagine israel flew this
[46:28] brother from where he lives over to
[46:31] their big place and made a great big
[46:33] recognition of it i thought praise be to
[46:35] god why because a message brother that
[46:38] was taught in the scripture
[46:41] and was able to help these people of
[46:44] antiquity and as we stood there and
[46:47] there stood right across where moses and
[46:49] them saw the land the promised land of
[46:52] what god said they just recently built a
[46:55] place there and all the people's coming
[46:57] down and been baptized and now they've
[46:59] changed it to where this is a place
[47:00] jesus is baptized why because jesus in
[47:04] the old testament form of yeshua or
[47:06] joshua is the very same place he crossed
[47:10] though they come up to this place and
[47:12] what is it there is a gate so they come
[47:14] to the gulf of aqaba and whatever they
[47:16] do so they send the sonar down through
[47:18] the gulf of aqaba and they find there's
[47:21] only one strait by which they can come
[47:23] across and what did god do god allowed
[47:26] the enemy to come right in they come
[47:28] down to this narrow gulf of aqaba and
[47:30] when they get in there the mountains is
[47:32] all around them they are totally
[47:34] surrounded and they get in and they
[47:37] can't get out that sounds like the way
[47:39] my father likes to do things sometimes
[47:42] and if you ever see the way it's laid
[47:45] out these gigantic mountains up on both
[47:47] sides you've got the red sea in front of
[47:49] you and you turn this way to go out and
[47:52] you can't get out because here comes the
[47:54] army of pharaoh and god allowed you to
[47:57] get him then how many has ever been
[47:59] hemmed up like that before
[48:01] why are you saying why would god do that
[48:03] to express his glory oh to show he's
[48:07] greater than the rocks he's bigger than
[48:10] the red sea he's bigger than your
[48:12] affliction he's bigger than your disease
[48:15] [Applause]
[48:16] mama so here come moses in the line of
[48:20] duty and what did he run into the gate
[48:22] of the red sea after teaching the
[48:25] children of israel the promised land
[48:27] that god had promised he was god's
[48:29] prophet he had been manifested before
[48:32] the people as god's prophet well how
[48:34] many can say that we've had one coming
[48:36] our day that was a manifested and even a
[48:38] greater way thank god he goes on to say
[48:41] in the same paragraph down below a bit
[48:43] right in the line of duty he come up
[48:45] against something that he know not what
[48:48] to do that was the red sea well what
[48:50] happened the seed of abraham was
[48:53] promised to possess the enemy's gates so
[48:56] when the red sea became a gate that he
[48:59] couldn't come through god moved upon the
[49:02] scene and took the gate and went away
[49:05] with it
[49:07] and moses walked across the sea on dry
[49:10] land his seed possessed the gate
[49:15] praise god his seed possess the gate
[49:20] how many is the seed of abraham
[49:22] i mean it's got a need in your life
[49:26] you need to change the name of that need
[49:29] to a gate
[49:30] a gate of disease a gate of poverty a
[49:34] gate of fear a gate of anxiety
[49:38] and let's serve notice on that gate
[49:40] tonight
[49:41] look out gate here i come
[49:46] hallelujah
[49:49] but remember we must get in the spirit
[49:51] of the lord to be able to make this
[49:53] happen
[49:54] let me go to one of brother daryl's
[49:57] favorite characters to preach about
[49:59] in the old testament and he could take
[50:01] my notes right now and i'm sure do a
[50:03] much better job on this guy
[50:05] his name is shamgar
[50:08] judges chapter 5 3 verse 30 so moab was
[50:12] subdued that day under the hand of
[50:13] israel and the land had rest for
[50:17] four score years and after him was
[50:20] shamgar the son of anus which slew of
[50:23] the philistines 600 men
[50:25] with an ox goat and he also delivered
[50:30] israel
[50:31] now samgar is a different sort of a hero
[50:35] you know a lot of folks get in their
[50:37] mind that all of god's heroes are those
[50:40] of great genealogy and those that come
[50:43] from a great oh my great great matriarch
[50:46] of a mother and a great patriarch of a
[50:49] father and they got saved when they were
[50:51] four or five years old filled with the
[50:53] holy ghost and there were about eight or
[50:54] nine they walked the straightening
[50:57] narrow way they went to the monastery in
[50:59] tucson and then they moved to the
[51:01] monastery in jeffersonville and then
[51:04] they moved to a monastery here and there
[51:06] and there they never had no
[51:10] well that's the way some of y'all talk
[51:11] to me when you talk about how low down
[51:13] and rotten you all are you act like
[51:15] everybody that ever amounted to anything
[51:17] never said anything wrong and never done
[51:19] nothing wrong i'm not sure what comic
[51:21] book you're reading but if i was you i'd
[51:22] get rid of it
[51:24] god's heroes have been some of the
[51:28] weakest
[51:29] most flawed most disrespected
[51:32] most looked down upon human beings that
[51:35] ever walked on the earth
[51:40] you know samson was a great mighty man
[51:44] his birth was announced by an angel of
[51:46] god
[51:47] he was a
[51:49] special man
[51:51] but god don't have all of his whole
[51:53] heroes to be sampsons
[51:55] here's another hero of the bible by the
[51:58] name of shamgar now let's look at
[52:00] shamgar a little bit shamgar is a
[52:03] foreign name or
[52:05] hirian h-u-r-r-i-a-n
[52:09] hurian
[52:11] samgar is not a jewish name at all
[52:15] shamgar is a foreign hearing name an
[52:18] anus is the name of the
[52:21] canaanite goddess
[52:23] of sex and war
[52:26] ah
[52:28] so you've got a heria name
[52:30] and your daddy is named after a goddess
[52:33] of sex and war
[52:37] well that wouldn't be much to be proud
[52:38] of would
[52:40] now how many of y'all won't say tell
[52:41] that's what your daddy's name was
[52:43] or your mama saying well some of that
[52:45] might not have been your daddy's name
[52:46] but it was your daddy's nature or your
[52:48] mama's nature well go ahead come on down
[52:50] now and some of you wound up at that
[52:52] same rotten sorry thing
[52:54] and then you look at yourself and say
[52:56] well i battled this thing all my life
[52:57] whatever it is i ain't no good i'll
[52:59] never amount to nothing can you imagine
[53:01] shamgar had to live above a syrian name
[53:08] the herians were a people that lived
[53:10] before abraham the hirian texts the
[53:13] cuneiform one of the ancient things of
[53:14] archaeology if you know anything about
[53:16] it it's one of the ancient deeds by
[53:18] which they referenced and they're able
[53:20] to determine how much that abraham was
[53:22] able to pay for his land so the hirian
[53:25] text it's a great great artifact and
[53:27] this this man why in the world would any
[53:31] jewish mother and father name their son
[53:35] after a syrian name
[53:37] it'd be like calling your son ricky
[53:41] knowing what the prophet said about it
[53:43] well come on now elvis rat cat dog mouse
[53:47] you know something like that
[53:49] now notice this warrior
[53:51] so his name is a hyrian name
[53:55] his daddy's name is named after the
[53:58] goddess of war and sex goddess she was
[54:02] actually the sister of baal
[54:10] and this is your daddy's name
[54:14] well how come you folks are not moving
[54:16] some of y'all ain't even batting an eye
[54:19] well go ahead friends just go ahead and
[54:20] be identified with it that's where some
[54:22] of us were
[54:23] our daddy was low down and rotten and
[54:25] our mother and our grandma and this and
[54:27] that and the other yes sort of like
[54:30] shamgar let's not just go to shamgar
[54:33] with the ox goat but let's go with
[54:36] shamgar pre-ox goat
[54:41] what did shamgar have to deal with
[54:43] within himself
[54:45] feeling like god would ever use him
[54:50] a hearing name
[54:53] and his daddy calls such a thing
[54:58] oh my
[55:00] notice this
[55:02] judges chapter 3 verse 31.
[55:06] and after him was shamgar
[55:09] the son of amnest which slew of the
[55:11] philistines 600 men
[55:13] with
[55:14] an oscar
[55:16] now we know it was the manner of the
[55:19] philistines that they would allow the
[55:21] jews
[55:22] to go in and plant the crops
[55:26] and then when it come harvest time
[55:29] for them to be able to take their corn
[55:31] and their wheat or whatever more here
[55:33] and you know what them sorry things
[55:35] would do
[55:36] they would invade the land and why were
[55:39] they even there in the first place
[55:40] because the children of israel the
[55:42] forefathers of this man and many others
[55:45] did not drive them totally out and god
[55:48] said because you don't do that i'm going
[55:50] to leave them here and they're going to
[55:51] be a thorn in your side
[55:54] so they were every year though they
[55:56] wouldn't go in there in the springtime
[55:58] and dig it all up whenever it's playing
[56:00] well i know why in the world do that but
[56:02] let them jews get out there and work all
[56:04] that corn and work all that barley and
[56:06] all that wheat and then whenever it come
[56:08] time to harvest it and get ready to take
[56:10] it to the market here they had come well
[56:12] year after year this had happened old
[56:15] sham guard now maybe shamgar said you
[56:17] know what i'm not a worthy guy i'm not a
[56:20] good guy look at my name look at what
[56:23] i've been look at my daddy everybody in
[56:26] the israel knows who i am oh my they
[56:29] know what kind of background that i've
[56:31] got oh sure i can see god using moses i
[56:34] can see god using this man or this woman
[56:36] but why would god ever use a man with a
[56:40] hearing name why would god ever use a
[56:44] man whose father was named after a sex
[56:47] goddess
[56:53] but god said
[56:59] i choose
[57:01] you
[57:03] to fulfill
[57:05] a couple of verses
[57:06] in the book of judges
[57:09] now he never reigned 40 years he never
[57:12] reigned 20 years he was not a judge for
[57:14] 15 or 20 years according to history
[57:16] about one year but he made the pages of
[57:19] the book
[57:21] and he had to make them pages of the
[57:23] book over his own frailty over his own
[57:26] background god i wish somebody would
[57:28] preach with me tonight over his own
[57:31] background over his own name can you
[57:33] imagine dealing with all the humiliation
[57:36] and the shame and so on that he went
[57:38] through but somehow something raised up
[57:41] in this man
[57:44] so year by year they would come in oh my
[57:48] and there was a band of thieves and
[57:50] robbers
[57:52] oh
[57:54] you know what they've got different
[57:55] names today but it's the same devils
[57:58] that anointed them for listings
[58:01] it's fear of covet
[58:03] anxiety of covet
[58:05] nervousness about this oppression about
[58:08] that sadness about that i think some of
[58:11] you daughters of god tonight need to get
[58:14] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[58:16] and say you rotten stinking devil you've
[58:20] stole my health you've stole my son
[58:22] you're trying to take my daughter but as
[58:25] a daughter of god i let you know gates
[58:29] of hell i'm claiming my children for the
[58:32] economy of god i will take my ox goat i
[58:35] will take my hammer and my nail i will
[58:38] abuse whatever god's put in my hand give
[58:42] him back satan
[58:50] oh my
[58:52] these guys got so bad
[58:55] that according to the book of judges
[58:57] chapter 5 verse 6
[58:59] and the days of shanghai the son of anus
[59:02] in the days of jail the highways were
[59:05] unoccupied
[59:07] and the travelers
[59:09] walked through
[59:11] byways
[59:13] now it was so bad so like new york
[59:16] denver portland
[59:22] it got so bad that people were afraid to
[59:26] even use the four lane as we'll say they
[59:28] were afraid to use the main highway so
[59:31] they started cutting little paths from
[59:33] farm to farm and they were so terrified
[59:36] because of all these thieves that were
[59:39] on the main highway well let me tell you
[59:41] something there's another great main
[59:43] highway that has invaded many of the
[59:46] lives of the people of the world it's
[59:48] called the highway of social media
[59:56] well glory to god it's invade many of
[59:59] our lives many of our homes and many of
[1:00:02] us would be better off if we spend more
[1:00:04] time on our knees before the presence of
[1:00:07] god instead of our phone or our laptop
[1:00:10] at our fingertips calling on the name of
[1:00:13] our children before the presence of god
[1:00:16] and meeting these philistines
[1:00:19] uncircumcised devils of lust and
[1:00:21] idolatry and
[1:00:23] music and movies and all kinds of stuff
[1:00:26] that's trying to steal our homes oh my
[1:00:29] and we let them philistines know i am a
[1:00:33] possessor of the gates
[1:00:43] oh my brother donnie i just get so
[1:00:45] caught up with it
[1:00:46] if you can't handle a smartphone
[1:00:49] get a dumb one
[1:00:52] they still make the flip ones
[1:00:56] if you ain't got enough in here to keep
[1:00:58] you from getting on the stuff that you
[1:00:59] ought not to be here get you a phone i'd
[1:01:01] rather carry one around that big i mean
[1:01:03] like this you're on it that big my
[1:01:05] goodness i'd rather have that than be
[1:01:07] tempted every day of my life if i ain't
[1:01:09] got enough holy ghost to control it
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:18] can you just imagine
[1:01:22] he walked into his house that day and
[1:01:23] said wife
[1:01:26] i believe god's going to help us
[1:01:29] look at it won't you come here look
[1:01:32] grabbed the baton by the hand the arm
[1:01:36] prophet said her clothes was all ragged
[1:01:38] and tattered
[1:01:39] little children look support and pick it
[1:01:42] they'd about starve to death
[1:01:45] because all the philistines would leave
[1:01:46] them was just enough seed corn
[1:01:49] and enough seed taters
[1:01:51] so they'd plant their crop next year
[1:01:54] so they had to ration everything they
[1:01:56] ate for the rest of the winter
[1:01:58] so in case some of you are thinking god
[1:02:01] is running out of joy let me tell you
[1:02:03] he's got abundance supply if you're
[1:02:06] afraid that we're going to shout all the
[1:02:08] joy out don't worry we could shout now
[1:02:10] for another 100 billion years and never
[1:02:13] shout it all out well brother donna i'm
[1:02:15] i'm afraid i'll have to ration his
[1:02:17] goodness and his mercy he's got more
[1:02:19] than you and i can ever imagine oh my
[1:02:22] why we ought to come into those back
[1:02:23] doors back on with such joy in our heart
[1:02:26] that we're so glad to be in the house of
[1:02:28] god and we're coming to sing and we're
[1:02:30] coming to worship and we're coming to
[1:02:32] pray and we're coming to say amen to the
[1:02:34] word and we're just coming to let hell
[1:02:36] know whose side we're all
[1:02:39] oh glory to god sometimes i just like to
[1:02:42] show up and say hey devil have you take
[1:02:45] note i'm here
[1:02:47] i'm here devil i want you to know whose
[1:02:50] side i'm all
[1:02:52] [Applause]
[1:02:59] oh
[1:03:01] mom
[1:03:03] i want you to notice this
[1:03:06] so the bible says
[1:03:08] i tremble shamgar the son of a naz would
[1:03:11] slow the philistines 600 men with an ox
[1:03:15] goat
[1:03:16] an ox goat is an instrument of wood
[1:03:19] about eight feet long
[1:03:22] armed with an iron iron spike or brass
[1:03:26] at one point on one end which was to
[1:03:29] spur
[1:03:31] the ox
[1:03:32] and also
[1:03:34] to scrape
[1:03:35] the plow
[1:03:38] what a weapon
[1:03:43] our government spends millions of
[1:03:45] dollars
[1:03:46] on trying to outsmart the russians
[1:03:49] and the chinese
[1:03:51] and god
[1:03:52] uses
[1:03:54] an ox code
[1:03:55] [Applause]
[1:04:04] glory to god
[1:04:06] god can take one little simple believer
[1:04:10] that's facing things and the doctors are
[1:04:12] baffled their side their tests come back
[1:04:14] we don't understand we don't know this
[1:04:15] we can't understand we can't put it all
[1:04:17] together and god can take one little
[1:04:19] simple person and yeah they're using
[1:04:20] less than ox go but they're using their
[1:04:23] face and they aim it right toward the
[1:04:25] gate of that enemy and they walk in the
[1:04:27] doctor's office and the doctor said i
[1:04:29] don't know what it was but it's gone
[1:04:30] whatever it was it's disappeared and the
[1:04:33] doctor is scratching the head and trying
[1:04:34] to figure out well we don't exactly know
[1:04:36] what it is and yet we want to put our
[1:04:38] trust in all the great things i met i'm
[1:04:40] grateful for everything that science can
[1:04:42] do but my answer is not science
[1:04:45] my answer is god
[1:04:47] if god uses science i say praise the
[1:04:49] lord but you know as well as i do
[1:04:51] there's many times science don't know
[1:04:53] what to do to help us
[1:05:00] praise god
[1:05:03] well
[1:05:04] i mean this guy's a farmer
[1:05:07] so he don't walk out there and pull out
[1:05:09] of his pack ah
[1:05:11] here's a super scanner i'll lean this
[1:05:14] laser right toward their heads and it'll
[1:05:16] do this and it'll somehow separate the
[1:05:18] doom if watch it from the you know the
[1:05:20] watching but call it on that side and
[1:05:21] it'll divide the perennial side from the
[1:05:23] right side and it'll do so and so but he
[1:05:25] just looked at it and said hallelujah
[1:05:28] i believe this will do it
[1:05:33] it moves oxen surely it can move humans
[1:05:37] it can clean a pile well i'll tell one
[1:05:39] thing i thought god cleaned my plow many
[1:05:40] times you
[1:05:41] [Applause]
[1:05:45] you see the philistines
[1:05:48] had taken every sword you understand
[1:05:51] that in the and the camp of israel there
[1:05:53] was not one sword left
[1:05:58] there was no helmets
[1:06:00] no shields no bucklers there was not one
[1:06:04] weapon
[1:06:06] so the devil thought
[1:06:12] listen to me friends i want you to
[1:06:13] remember this quote
[1:06:15] greatest battle ever thought you see his
[1:06:17] attack watch listen
[1:06:19] close as closing
[1:06:21] his attack is what disbelieve god's word
[1:06:25] that's his attack though can't you see
[1:06:26] the greatest battle that's ever fall
[1:06:28] there's only two forces satan and god
[1:06:32] and watch satan's weapon against you
[1:06:36] try to get you
[1:06:39] to disbelieve
[1:06:42] your weapons
[1:06:47] and you know several years ago the
[1:06:48] russians
[1:06:50] had one of their mig
[1:06:52] fighters
[1:06:54] and it was reported that that thing
[1:06:56] could fly like
[1:06:57] 2.8 mark
[1:07:00] and then someone else said no no no no
[1:07:02] it's way faster than that it's 3.2
[1:07:06] and when the americans began to hear
[1:07:08] about it
[1:07:10] it terrified them
[1:07:12] because at that time they didn't have
[1:07:14] anything that would anywhere come close
[1:07:16] to this
[1:07:18] so they started ramping up and building
[1:07:21] faster and faster pratt and whitney and
[1:07:24] all the different ones started building
[1:07:25] their engines so much more thrust so
[1:07:27] they could be able to do this that
[1:07:29] another but you know what one day
[1:07:32] a russian pilot
[1:07:34] flew one of those migs
[1:07:36] into a u.s base
[1:07:39] and turned it over to the americans
[1:07:42] and whatever they did oh they were so
[1:07:45] tickled that they got it but you know
[1:07:46] what they found out
[1:07:49] they found out that thing was near as
[1:07:51] bad as what they were told you know what
[1:07:54] it was propaganda
[1:07:56] they already found out their gym
[1:08:00] they already found out their jets were
[1:08:03] already faster they were better they
[1:08:06] could fly higher but it was propaganda
[1:08:10] that was telling them we got something
[1:08:12] you don't god that's exactly what he
[1:08:14] does to you and now
[1:08:16] he wants to tell him the word ain't good
[1:08:18] enough oh you don't need to go to church
[1:08:21] all the message ain't good enough no
[1:08:22] more yes it is
[1:08:25] oh you need something better you need
[1:08:27] something good oh no we don't god gave
[1:08:30] us the best he had and that was his word
[1:08:34] it's faster it fly higher it'll raise
[1:08:37] you up on glory to god no matter what
[1:08:40] the devil says
[1:08:42] [Applause]
[1:08:52] but he'll want to tell you
[1:08:54] mine's worse than yours
[1:08:56] i'm back to the barn
[1:09:02] he said
[1:09:05] remember the man with the dream
[1:09:07] the devil said boo
[1:09:09] and the man
[1:09:11] well then something like raised up and
[1:09:12] he said blew back
[1:09:15] and whenever he started blowing the
[1:09:16] devil every time he blew the devil the
[1:09:18] devil would get with her and littler why
[1:09:20] he was bluffing him
[1:09:23] so his weapon is to try to make you
[1:09:26] doubt your weapon
[1:09:29] so at least i can spend all these years
[1:09:31] of these great polished things oh my
[1:09:33] he's got years and years and years he's
[1:09:35] using the same thing he used on eve in
[1:09:37] the garden of eden
[1:09:39] make you doubt your weapon
[1:09:46] praise god
[1:09:48] but sometimes all it takes

[1:10:53] hypersonic airplanes
[1:10:56] that wanted to come up with helicopters
[1:10:58] that can fly thousands of miles
[1:10:59] hypersonic speed what that means it's
[1:11:02] faster than the speed of sound already
[1:11:04] they're traveling at 4.5 mark that
[1:11:06] that's four times the speed of sound
[1:11:09] moving that fast thousand four thousand
[1:11:12] five thousand miles an hour
[1:11:14] do you understand some of our most
[1:11:16] secretive airplanes can be across the
[1:11:18] atlantic coast in less than an hour's
[1:11:20] time
[1:11:22] and can send missiles from hundreds and
[1:11:24] hundreds of miles away
[1:11:26] and they're building them now where the
[1:11:27] bombers will not even have a man in them
[1:11:32] they'll be controlled from a remote
[1:11:34] control
[1:11:36] lord god of man is able to build a
[1:11:38] bomber that he can send up you remember
[1:11:40] the ssr-71 the blackbird able to fly 72
[1:11:44] 000 feet fly so high that they couldn't
[1:11:46] even see it didn't even know it was
[1:11:48] there they're trying to send them
[1:11:49] whatever more accurate they couldn't
[1:11:51] even know it was there and now they're
[1:11:52] making the brethren to it and it's going
[1:11:54] to be where they can fly with the pilot
[1:11:56] or without and will be controlled oh
[1:11:58] glory to god if man can able to make a
[1:12:01] machine like that why cannot we
[1:12:04] surrender to the holy ghost and instead
[1:12:06] of us flying our life instead of us
[1:12:09] doing the bombing let the master in the
[1:12:11] control room
[1:12:12] oh glory to god let him remotely control
[1:12:16] our lives
[1:12:18] go back straight forward dip die
[1:12:22] [Applause]
[1:12:23] hallelujah
[1:12:29] listen the prophet said if he can get
[1:12:31] you to disbelief
[1:12:33] your weapon is equivalent
[1:12:36] if he gets you to believe that your
[1:12:38] weapon
[1:12:40] is not strong
[1:12:42] enough
[1:12:49] he's disarmed you
[1:12:53] well i'm not sure i've tried the word

[1:14:31] it's a miracle within itself
[1:14:33] in reality if you kill 600 of them in a
[1:14:38] lifetime once we're talking about
[1:14:40] trained men they were hardened they were

[1:20:31] he reached up and got that us goad he
[1:20:34] didn't have time to train to be some
[1:20:36] kind of fighter
[1:20:38] the emergency
[1:20:39] was at hand
[1:20:41] oh glory to god
[1:20:43] he had to do it then god gave the
[1:20:45] promises and god gave the promise to
[1:20:46] abraham he said he would possess
[1:20:49] the gates
[1:20:51] of his enemies
[1:20:53] shamgar
[1:20:54] believe that
[1:20:56] i challenge anyone in this building
[1:20:58] tonight or anyone that'll hear this
[1:21:00] that's got enough faith
[1:21:02] take the name sham guard of that quote
[1:21:05] and put yours in it
[1:21:08] i challenge you
[1:21:09] amen as a servant of god
[1:21:17] look at the odds against him or her
[1:21:19] whichever one it is
[1:21:21] god only needs one man
[1:21:24] just let him get one man in his hand the
[1:21:27] world will think he's crazy but he'll
[1:21:29] drive home the gospel
[1:21:31] when he's done thoroughly convinced that
[1:21:33] jesus christ remains the same yesterday
[1:21:35] today and forever
[1:21:37] what if sam gardner said now wait a
[1:21:39] minute
[1:21:40] i've got to wait them coming i better go
[1:21:42] away to some school a little while and
[1:21:44] learn how to make a denominational creed
[1:21:46] duel
[1:21:48] dude listen know if he'd have done that
[1:21:50] that's all he'd ever known but he'd
[1:21:52] never done the job of this dueling he
[1:21:54] took god at his promise
[1:21:57] that he would possess the gate
[1:21:59] of his enemy
[1:22:01] can i use one more
[1:22:03] one that's much more famous
[1:22:06] man by the name of samson
[1:22:08] judges 16 2 and it was told the gaze out
[1:22:11] saying samson has come hither
[1:22:13] and they can pass them in and laid
[1:22:15] weight for him all night in the gate of
[1:22:17] the city
[1:22:18] and we're quite all than not saying in
[1:22:20] the morning when it is day
[1:22:22] we shall kill him
[1:22:24] samson lay till midnight
[1:22:26] and arose at midnight and took the doors
[1:22:34] the doors of the gate of the city
[1:22:37] and the two posts
[1:22:43] now i'll tell one thing it'd take a good
[1:22:45] strong man
[1:22:47] to take both of these doors and there's
[1:22:48] probably brothers in here that could do
[1:22:49] it
[1:22:51] but let me give you
[1:22:53] a little clearer picture
[1:22:56] theologians historians and
[1:22:58] archaeologists
[1:23:00] who have found and dug into the city of
[1:23:04] gotham and found where these ancient
[1:23:07] gates at one time stood
[1:23:11] say that them gates are you ready
[1:23:14] weighed between eight
[1:23:16] and ten
[1:23:17] tons
[1:23:23] ten feet wide
[1:23:25] two feet thick
[1:23:32] hello
[1:23:37] between 16
[1:23:40] and 20 000 pounds
[1:23:43] not a crane
[1:23:45] a shrimp
[1:23:49] remember the prophet said he didn't have
[1:23:51] shoulders the size of a barn door he was
[1:23:53] a little short curly headed mama's boy
[1:24:00] well glory to god
[1:24:03] hallelujah it wasn't that he had great
[1:24:05] big old muscles like hercules and
[1:24:07] charles atlas and all of that my that
[1:24:10] wasn't a miracle it was when the spirit
[1:24:12] of god moved on this little curly headed
[1:24:14] shrimp
[1:24:17] lord of god
[1:24:19] [Applause]
[1:24:20] so he picks up the gates
[1:24:23] and the bars
[1:24:26] notice what the bible says and he
[1:24:28] carried them up to the top of a hill
[1:24:32] that is before
[1:24:34] hebron
[1:24:35] 20 miles away
[1:24:39] at an elevation of over 3 000 feet
[1:24:42] higher than where he was so he's going
[1:24:44] uphill
[1:24:48] hallelujah
[1:24:49] hallelujah
[1:24:51] hallelujah
[1:24:55] eight to ten times glory to god sixteen
[1:24:59] to twenty thousand pounds
[1:25:02] uphill
[1:25:07] amen
[1:25:11] i always knew this was a miracle
[1:25:13] but they didn't realize how great it was
[1:25:15] till the other day and i got to study in
[1:25:17] it
[1:25:18] i nearly burnt the carpet up downstairs
[1:25:20] in my steady
[1:25:22] oh lord god you're the same god you're
[1:25:26] the same god in our time of need
[1:25:28] oh i went upstairs and told carol about
[1:25:30] it saw when the brothers at the church
[1:25:32] shared it with him this week about
[1:25:33] lowe's i've been about ready to blow up
[1:25:35] to tell somebody i'm glad y'all here
[1:25:38] tonight so i can tell
[1:25:43] 20 miles
[1:25:46] 16 000
[1:25:48] pounds
[1:25:54] oh i know i know i know i'm trying to
[1:25:56] look in somebody else's face you think
[1:25:57] that ain't nothing compared to what i'm
[1:25:58] packing
[1:26:05] let me tell you something
[1:26:06] that was a symbol
[1:26:12] you see samson
[1:26:17] not in his weakness with the women
[1:26:20] but there was a symbol embedded in this
[1:26:23] you see the gates of causal
[1:26:25] have been referred to
[1:26:27] as the kids
[1:26:29] of hell
[1:26:37] the lord god wanted to tie back to
[1:26:40] happily tell you
[1:26:42] so the enemy compassed him round about
[1:26:45] and soldiers
[1:26:47] around his tomb
[1:26:51] hallelujah
[1:26:53] and about midnight he got up
[1:26:56] and cheated
[1:27:02] deaths hallelujah
[1:27:05] oh hallelujah
[1:27:09] glory to god
[1:27:11] so before three days had passed i can
[1:27:14] see our lord jesus come back into that
[1:27:17] body inside of that tomb inside of the
[1:27:21] gaze of walls if you will all shut up
[1:27:24] hallelujah to god but what did he do he
[1:27:27] broke the gates he broke the bars oh all
[1:27:31] of these men had great victories that
[1:27:33] every one of them would have come to die
[1:27:35] samson died with his enemy and shamgar
[1:27:37] no doubt died and all the rest of them
[1:27:39] died but our lord jesus went into death
[1:27:42] hallelujah he went into death and he
[1:27:45] grabbed the hope of the gates of death
[1:27:47] and said my children don't fear it no
[1:27:50] more
[1:27:51] don't fear it hallelujah oh some of you
[1:27:53] will go that way but don't worry look
[1:27:56] here i've got the gates
[1:27:59] hallelujah when it comes up your sleeve
[1:28:02] don't fear i took the case
[1:28:17] the prophet said in a prophet he was but
[1:28:19] he was more than a prophet
[1:28:21] he was a prophet plus
[1:28:23] there had been many prophets and all the
[1:28:24] prophets died at the gate of death
[1:28:27] but this man took the keys of death held
[1:28:29] in grave
[1:28:30] like sam's undead
[1:28:32] the gates of gaza
[1:28:35] took it out took the sting
[1:28:37] and death itself
[1:28:39] and swallowed up in victory and rose up
[1:28:42] on the third day triumph makes his
[1:28:44] believers more
[1:28:46] than conquerors
[1:28:47] it's already conquered there's nothing
[1:28:49] left to do
[1:28:51] but walk right straight in with the
[1:28:53] victor song
[1:28:55] in our hearts
[1:28:56] he is the great triumph one he's the
[1:28:59] great one that was more than a prophet
[1:29:06] let me close with this one
[1:29:08] when you get this spirit in you
[1:29:11] the burdens of this life
[1:29:14] becomes light
[1:29:16] you don't notice them anymore
[1:29:18] your yoke
[1:29:20] is lined with feathers
[1:29:24] they become so easy and the people pile
[1:29:26] things on you you know what
[1:29:29] you're like
[1:29:31] in the gates of gaza
[1:29:33] who picked up the big brass gate and
[1:29:36] packed it up on the hill now listen it's
[1:29:38] your type
[1:29:39] and when you get to a place that the
[1:29:41] holy spirit has you
[1:29:43] not you the holy spirit but the holy
[1:29:45] spirit has you you say i got the holy
[1:29:47] ghost
[1:29:48] i don't think that should be said
[1:29:52] you must say
[1:29:54] the holy ghost
[1:29:56] got me
[1:30:04] and then when the holy ghost gets you
[1:30:07] the burdens the yoke is easy then you
[1:30:10] pick up the big gates of gaza
[1:30:14] and pack them straight
[1:30:17] to california
[1:30:19] god sure and i feel like running from
[1:30:21] the front to the back of this church
[1:30:23] glory to god you pick up your parents
[1:30:27] and what you do with them you don't take
[1:30:29] them home you don't take them to your
[1:30:30] bed and lay there and ponder and worry

[1:32:23] i laid the load of it at calvary
[1:32:27] and i walk back down off it here can you
[1:32:29] imagine samson when he finally got them
[1:32:31] big gates up and just
[1:32:36] the rabbis say those gates were 60
[1:32:40] cubits wide 90
[1:32:42] feet
[1:32:44] 90 feet wide
[1:32:50] can you imagine seeing a little shrimp
[1:32:52] with like a double wide trailer on his
[1:32:54] back well i'm woking up the king's
[1:32:57] highway
[1:32:58] oh
[1:32:59] walking up the cube
[1:33:01] and here he goes he's just going up the
[1:33:03] hill the whole time he ain't stopping to
[1:33:05] take a breath he's dancing he's
[1:33:06] rejoicing under the anointing of the
[1:33:08] holy ghost imagine when he got up and

[1:33:37] you can only see what god wants to do
[1:33:40] with an ox code
[1:33:42] what god can do with shrimps
[1:33:45] but some of you want to be lobsters
[1:33:47] let's be shrimps
[1:33:51] let god energize you then when that
[1:33:53] devil gets near god will let your
[1:33:55] lobster claw go out
[1:34:02] [Applause]
[1:34:19] don't you see why satan wants to trouble
[1:34:21] us so much
[1:34:22] sickness heartache trouble
[1:34:24] he said get our minds off of this
[1:34:27] he don't want us to know who we are
[1:34:29] get us under the fear and the trauma hey
[1:34:31] this is what the rest of the world is
[1:34:33] under
[1:34:34] they're scared to death my their
[1:34:36] political team don't win they go all to
[1:34:37] pieces

[1:34:47] rnc and the dnc and all the rest them

[1:34:52] faith is not there my faith is up here
[1:34:58] hallelujah
[1:35:00] hallelujah
[1:35:02] let's pray together
[1:35:08] praise god
[1:35:11] brother donnie i'm nobody i'm nothing
[1:35:17] my family background's bad
[1:35:20] you don't know i
[1:35:22] i mess up so many times
[1:35:25] and i've done this and that and the
[1:35:26] other wow sounds like you got the
[1:35:29] credentials of a hero to me
[1:35:34] the prophet said if you ever make it to
[1:35:35] heaven
[1:35:36] you will stand beside people that were
[1:35:38] so weak
[1:35:41] you see we have this image in our mind
[1:35:44] of what they were
[1:35:46] a lot of these images in our mind
[1:35:48] are hollywood images
[1:35:50] they're not images of truth
[1:35:53] moses was not a great eloquent man he
[1:35:55] was a man that couldn't help pain and
[1:35:57] made his other incongruent words out
[1:35:59] right
[1:36:01] elijah a man of a high temper
[1:36:04] look at a man like samson
[1:36:06] the issues and problems
[1:36:08] that man had
[1:36:11] and the miracles that god used
[1:36:13] him for
[1:36:14] have never been replicated to this day
[1:36:19] but he knew
[1:36:20] he was chosen of god
[1:36:24] well if he could do that without even
[1:36:25] living a godly life
[1:36:27] but based upon knowing he was chosen
[1:36:29] what about us the saints of god
[1:36:34] john said if you know that your heart
[1:36:36] don't condemn you then we know we have
[1:36:38] what we ask him
[1:36:40] for there's no condemnation in our
[1:36:42] hearts
[1:36:43] so we believe him
[1:36:45] we trust him
[1:36:46] and we have confidence when we pray
[1:36:52] i may like to be remembered tonight
[1:36:55] maybe some of you aren't sick you don't
[1:36:56] really have any
[1:36:58] pressing needs or issues
[1:37:00] but you just like to be the type of
[1:37:02] person you've heard preached in it
[1:37:05] not a great person in your eyes
[1:37:07] but if god can do something for you
[1:37:10] you see the way to be great is to see
[1:37:12] yourself as nothing and always remain
[1:37:14] little in your own eyes as long as we're
[1:37:17] big in our own eyes we'll never amount
[1:37:19] to nothing
[1:37:20] that's right the prophet said god has a
[1:37:22] hard time trying to find a man that he
[1:37:24] can use because he said for many men
[1:37:26] once it goes to using them they want to
[1:37:28] be an angel or a god before the people
[1:37:32] but he said if he can find somebody he
[1:37:34] can use
[1:37:35] and the more he uses him the littler he
[1:37:37] gets
[1:37:39] i'll never forget years and years ago
[1:37:42] when we was over in this building now
[1:37:43] before some of you all even came here
[1:37:45] which is now the fellowship hall people
[1:37:48] were standing at the end of the service
[1:37:50] like this
[1:37:51] brother johnson was standing there the
[1:37:53] johnson family was coming down from
[1:37:55] virginia i'm sure that they had moved
[1:37:56] down here at that time
[1:37:58] but brother lester johnson the father
[1:38:01] many of you never got to meet him great
[1:38:02] brother
[1:38:03] and when i started quoting that quote
[1:38:06] brother johnson just stood there by the
[1:38:08] west
[1:38:09] and i said quoted what brother braham
[1:38:11] said the more god uses him the littler
[1:38:13] he gets and brother johnson went like
[1:38:15] this and the more he uses him the
[1:38:17] littler he gets
[1:38:19] and just kept on going down
[1:38:21] until his knees hit the floor
[1:38:25] or if we can get little in our own house
[1:38:29] just take our little walks goat or our
[1:38:31] left hand or
[1:38:33] our hammer and nail or our piece of
[1:38:36] millstone whatever it is
[1:38:38] then let the lord
[1:38:39] energize us
[1:38:42] and then we'll look back like samson and
[1:38:43] say wow
[1:38:45] wow what a place we've been in today
[1:38:48] what a service we've had
[1:38:49] awesome
[1:38:51] if we can be nothing
[1:38:53] and stay nothing
[1:38:55] let's pray together
[1:39:03] heavenly father
[1:39:06] who were we tonight
[1:39:09] that we would be invited by the great
[1:39:12] mighty king
[1:39:15] to be part of your army
[1:39:18] in the last day
[1:39:21] i look around our ranks
[1:39:23] here tonight
[1:39:24] and our ranks around the world
[1:39:27] we're not great we're not mighty
[1:39:30] many of us aren't very smart
[1:39:33] probably wouldn't be one doctor's degree
[1:39:35] among us
[1:39:37] certainly in our theology
[1:39:41] many of us are poor
[1:39:44] we'd be embarrassed to be invited to the
[1:39:47] white house to
[1:39:48] speak
[1:39:50] we wouldn't know how to talk
[1:39:52] we'd be embarrassed to
[1:39:55] eat with the mayor maybe or the governor
[1:39:57] of the state
[1:39:58] because our manners would be support
[1:40:01] and yet we're invited to eat
[1:40:04] with the king of kings
[1:40:06] and the lord of lords
[1:40:10] praise god
[1:40:12] lord maybe all we have tonight in our
[1:40:14] hands is an ox goat
[1:40:18] now that must have been a miraculous
[1:40:19] thing we know it was because shamgar had
[1:40:21] used this thing
[1:40:23] for years to plow and
[1:40:25] who would have ever thought you'd have
[1:40:26] ever taken that as an implement of war
[1:40:30] a sword a spear
[1:40:32] armor or something like that but an ox
[1:40:34] goad which is a farmer's implement a
[1:40:36] tool
[1:40:38] well lord if you could use a farmer's
[1:40:40] tool
[1:40:40] what about a wife's tool
[1:40:43] a frying pan
[1:40:44] that if she stands there and fixes her
[1:40:47] husband and her children
[1:40:49] breakfast and supper
[1:40:51] and it's made with not only ingredients
[1:40:53] of salt and pepper and eggs and this and
[1:40:55] that and the other but with the
[1:40:57] ingredients of love and prayer
[1:40:59] god you see my husband be with him today
[1:41:02] god you see my children
[1:41:04] father you see our family we have needs
[1:41:07] well it may look just like a frying pan
[1:41:11] but it's not just the frying pan it's
[1:41:12] who's got a hold of it
[1:41:15] and they're talking to the
[1:41:16] master maybe a brother's a carton he's
[1:41:19] only got a hammer maybe he's got a nail
[1:41:21] gun a level
[1:41:23] this or that or the other
[1:41:25] but it's not just the level
[1:41:28] but it's who holding the level
[1:41:30] a god call man a son of god
[1:41:34] oh jesus
[1:41:36] take the implements that you placed in
[1:41:38] our hands
[1:41:39] use them to your glory
[1:41:42] granted i pray father
[1:41:46] not that we would be anything
[1:41:48] but that you would be everything
[1:41:50] when it's all said and done
[1:41:54] and we're allowed to commend it your
[1:41:55] great kingdom we will bow our heads
[1:41:59] as we hear you say
[1:42:00] well done
[1:42:02] our good and faithful servant
[1:42:05] lord jesus may every gate
[1:42:08] that's come against my people
[1:42:11] father is their shepherd i say mine
[1:42:14] simply on the fact of you placing me
[1:42:16] here to try to help them they're not
[1:42:18] mine as far as purchase or bolt
[1:42:21] but they're mine just in the sense of me
[1:42:23] trying to help them in this journey
[1:42:26] i love him god
[1:42:28] i love him
[1:42:30] with all my heart
[1:42:32] it breaks my heart to see him suffer
[1:42:36] breaks my heart to see him defeated
[1:42:39] breaks my heart to see them fall
[1:42:43] lord jesus may i always have your heart
[1:42:47] to go after them
[1:42:50] oh god
[1:42:52] may we pick up these
[1:42:54] heavy gates
[1:42:56] that seem so difficult for us to not
[1:43:00] may we lay them
[1:43:02] at calvary
[1:43:04] father sometimes i don't know how much
[1:43:05] farther i can go
[1:43:07] i'm sure they feel that way but lord
[1:43:11] help me
[1:43:13] help me
[1:43:15] help me to take these gates
[1:43:18] and i'll be faithful all the way
[1:43:20] all the way to calvary
[1:43:24] praise god
[1:43:27] granted lord jesus how many is that your
[1:43:29] desire tonight just raise your hand to
