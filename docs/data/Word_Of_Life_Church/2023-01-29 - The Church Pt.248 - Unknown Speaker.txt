do it might want to send a card of thanks to management Holiday Inn they've been very good to us here and they burned a set before and they froze us to death and most time in the same service but for the most part they've treated us they've treated this really really good and we'll we'll not mention the Heat or the air conditioning issue but if you feel that it send just a little note or a call to the place here and just tell them how much we appreciate them letting us come here this is nice to get to be together this is very nice you know our church sold a lot sooner than we I guess

mother and dad they're here from Canada right over here raise your hand give those folks a nice hand this morning brother Joel God bless you as you're saying buddy and God bless you Amen to those seen and unseen and many times I'm going to share this just a little bit many times as as one who sings I think I sing the same so old songs over and over and I know more songs but sometimes just something to settle in and the purpose of this song Today is specific the prophet when he spoke the words Behold The Virgin shall conceive it came out of inspiration from God and we know that those words circled the Earth for hundreds of years until it found a little heart to settle in and the words to this song was birthed out of inspiration from the same God who spoke to Isaiah a song something keeps holding me and I want to sing it today for a specific reason being that the words to this song being that they are inspired I want the words to this song to Circle in this building this place because who knows who they will settle in and change their very heart change a very life so you all pray with me sing with me create that atmosphere that will be something that will change a life maybe next week maybe today maybe a month from now whenever a year from now whenever but the trials of this world we're getting closer [Music] more than I could be and I was on the verge of Simply giving over just giving up [Music] the strength Within Myself just wasn't there [Music] something keeps holding me [Music] helping me Faithfully to overcome my drive foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] Satan lay before me is Temptation why don't you just go back out into the world it was his desire to seal away my faith my joy and my hope but I have found in time the Revelation [Music] it was just what I need to keep me in this race [Music] [Applause] keeps holding me every day I see helping me Faithfully to overcome it causes me to live right because constantly leaving me feel sorry let's see because I know that Jesus is [Music] something keeps father I thank you for holding me [Music] when I can when can't hold myself you are right there holding me helping me giving me courage riding me along to overcome each and every try [Music] I'm guiding me keeping me holding me securing me every day yeah I see you are my reality and I thank you for for holding me one more time [Music] I know it's you Lord that's holding me [Music] every day I see [Music] Hallelujah to overcome my try [Music] [Applause] to be constantly leave me victory you're my reality thank you for holding me [Music] amen [Music] foreign [Music] days surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us run this race [Music] but as those have gone before us let us behind us the Heritage a faithfulness passed on through Godly lives [Music] [Applause] may all who come behind us Find Us Faithful May the power of our devotion like their way [Music] May the footprints that we lead lead them to be and the lives we live Inspire them to obey oh man all the kindness does find us face after all our hopes and dreams have come and gone and our children sift through all we've left behind May the clothes that they discover and the memories they uncover become the life that leads them faithful [Music] [Applause] [Music] Ness their way May the footprints that we lead them to believe and the lives we live Inspire them to obey oh may all who come behind behind us behind us faithful May the footprints that we leave lead them to believe and the lives we live in is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] but he's in a hurry today are you gonna have to stand there I'm sorry I would like to say if if this is our last service that uh Holiday Inn I really appreciate everybody oh the the young men the brothers that have helped the music music moving stuff in and out and [Applause] Lewis complaining because it's taken me so long I tried to get him to do something else but he he wouldn't or the tool knows love you folks this is a song brother Larry sent me here a while back and it just just the last few days I couldn't get it off my mind I believe we're seeing the end of all things don't you we're sending in Russia we're sinning and all the churches we're sinning in America but there's something that special to me as I'm seeing it in the bride you know there's going to be some people here that are reflecting him before he comes and I see that all around people look at people's faults I see Jesus when I look around and I'm glad if it's bandaging the broken washing filthy feet Here I Am Lord send me if it's loving one another even when we don't agree Here I Am Lord send me if I'm poor or if I'm wealthy I will serve you just the same here I am Lord send me on the mountain or the valley oh I will choose to pray Here I Am Lord send me if I'm known by how I love let my life reflect how much I love I love you I love I love you and before you even ask oh my answer will be yes cause I love you

[Applause] praise the Lord trust that's all of our desires today what greater honor could there be to be called by God to be a part of his body to represent him in the Earth well anybody here going to be crying after today probably not I think the Lord had been able to have this place I'm glad we're moving on aren't you second Corinthians chapter 10. for I certainly appreciate all the musicians and all the brothers that have helped them have to move all this stuff back and forth and back and forth yeah so many of the services they'll be moving at all again again today we certainly appreciate all the effort that they've put forth second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 4. for the weapons of our Warfare not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations which is part of our spirit of course and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought wow I wonder how many of us could say we did that you see my hand ain't no bigger bringing into captivity Every Soul I realize there's an element of people around the message that say and preach preachers that we are beyond the Bible actually and that Paul and Peter and all of those brothers were just immature infants and that we're so far beyond them do I look at it if I can just get to where they were I'll be doing pretty good yeah so for those of you that are beyond the Bible pray for us it's still working on it would you notice what Paul said bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ Philippians 4 verse 8. Philippians chapter 4 verse 8. finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things well it wouldn't be a be a happier people if we did that I mean lots of you remembers we pray today heavenly father is we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth from once our bodies were taken and we know unless we're changed they'll go back that way but father we know the important thing is that we take what life that you've given us and we invested into the kingdom of God we allow you to use this for your Divine Purpose or that small medium or large that doesn't really matter to us what we want is for you to be pleased with us Lord God as we approach your word today I pray that you'd help me help me that I can step aside Lord and may you be able to speak through this human vessel something that would benefit your people not only those in the visible audience but those invisible as well we want to say thank you Father that we've been able to have this place where we can meet for the last few months we're grateful for it Lord God we're believing you that when we move into the new place that it's going to be just phenomenal it'll be above what we could even ask or think what you're going to do Among Us not so much because of the new building but we know every time you moved the people of Israel from one place to another it was climbing higher and higher that's what we want we're not so much interested in a nice new building a nice this nice that what we want is your presence whether it's in a Shack by the side of the road or a nice building that's what we desire speak to us today Father by Your Word we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated certainly not to agree to each other here today visitors that are with us and the Lord be with you and bless you imagine there was one thing that Rahab tomorrow ruse Bathsheba all of them had at least one thing in common they all had to look past them the negativity of their lives all four of them like most of us have had enough negative things in our life and it certainly affects us we know that we are a supernatural being but I think most of us also realize that we are a natural one as well and my natural one is the one that gets me in most of my trouble it's not my soul it loves God just harmonizes with his word since I've been born again but it's our flesh and yet we know that not only our flesh part but our spirit part as well as a matter of fact it can be one of our greatest enemies the body itself actually is neutral you take the spirit of God and put it inside of a human body it can affect that neutrality of the body to where the body becomes obedient to what the word says Spirit of the world which we're born with it affects the neutrality of the body makes the body lie makes the body drink makes the body get addicted to drugs habits things like that because the body itself is very neutral it must have an influence it must have a power that affects it and the spirit is not so much neutral but it is a nature of something that is innocent that nature is what affects what we become our human spirit is very complicated it's a very complex thing none of us have ever actually thought or felt or experienced what Adam did in the beginning because Adam had nothing negative to affect him so there was no trauma there was no fear there was no anxiety of course to life to the fall he felt everything in Perfection love genuine truths no betrayal nothing ever bad in any way so we've never felt that really most of us whether you're 15 or 45 or 65 or 85 most of us have had fear trauma anxiety disappointment betrayal by Friends by Family by all different types of things and I know we we sing that that doesn't affect us as Christians and we thought well we're so far beyond that but you really know you see what you are in that human element it's where the great battle actually comes from and the imagination the affection the memory the conscience the things that's inside the human spirit is much of what dictates a lot of the battles that we Face a lot of the scars that are brought Upon Us self-inflicted many of them are brought on by others of course but let me just before I go into this from a psychological aspect if that's all right let me bring it to you from the realm of your human Spirit now in that it has five inlets or five channels imagination conscience memory reason and affection and that's the way that we're able to contact our ocean home so you can imagine then what this body would be if we didn't have any memory if we had no imagination if man and had no imagination we wouldn't have this type of building today there would be no such a thing as a wireless microphone but somebody imagined there would be a way that a speaker would be able to stand up and speak to an audience and he wouldn't have to have a cable drug around behind him all the time and somebody began to think well what about Wi-Fi what about cell phones now that's still up for debate whether we're better with them or without them I guess right but it was the imagination of someone Alexander Graham Bell that began to think about there must be a way that we could contact one another Thomas Edison of course went through many many failures before he was able to go through many of the successful inventions that the man did where did that come from not from his soul that did not come from his memory that did not come from a affection where'd it come from imagination an imagination is a great thing as long as it's used in the right way but imagination can be so destructive to each of us my imagination now I don't mind telling you I've got quite a quite an imagination so my imagination can be very destructive and can be used against me a lot of times now maybe some of you say well that don't bother me well just listen to me before you make that assumption because as we can imagine positive things we can also Imagine negative things and there is a power that is released from us because we are a supernatural being so as our imagination can be able to take things and Tinker together and make this and put that together uh you know that's a powerful thing but as our imagination can also begin to take things that are not factual or realistic our imagination can turn it into something that is so real to us but is actually alive watch this the prophet says it this way you just imagine that somebody hates you once now this is all you have to imagine it once somebody hates you once now he said they don't hate you but you imagine that they do and you just keep thinking now remember you don't think with your soul you don't think these types of thoughts from your soul negative sinking from a born-again person cannot exist they think positive on the word so you're thinking with your spirit now remember he says but you imagine they do and you just keep thinking they don't like me they don't like me is there anybody here that's ever been that way one two three oh okay all right okay so you begin to think now now where does it start in the channel of imagination now you just imagine that you bumped into brother Rob out there in the four year before service and and brother Rob was thinking about speaking to someone else and he's a man on a mission and he's got to go talk to somebody and you bound hey Adrian brother Robin he just you know went right on it wasn't trying to be mean to you or nothing like that that's not brother Rob's away but yet in your mind you think he doesn't like me now say you're going to try them out to service and he's again a man on a mission and here he's going wide open to do this or that or the other and you're just thinking that's twice in the same service he does not like me brother Rob let's just settle this is there anyone near the building you don't like see there you go so the situation is resolved right but the problem of it is most of us don't get to hear that from the person that we think has a problem with us so we begin to take this into this Avenue of our imagination and then we begin to think about it think about it and we imagine they don't like us now notice what that changes into now the prophet said the first thing you'll be doing is shining that person so now it moves Beyond just imagination something is actually struck in your brain now whether or not you understand this from your brain in the vortex of your brain also from the part called the amygdala that in this almond-shaped mass of gray matter whenever you have positive or negative thoughts it Associates in your brain and releases hormones in your body every thought positive or negative releases this chemistry that takes place in your body which will go to reacting upon your emotions then you think about it you think about it whether positive or negative and you think about it brother Rob don't like me now he's done told you that he does okay but you think he don't he don't and all of a sudden you begin to feel something in your body reacting what is it it's your emotions and it's being released from this part of your brain and it's causing a feeling to come through you say I know it I know it don't cause I feel it now are you yes are you actually feeling something you are but it's based on a lie come on I've been there and done that now what's the first saying that you'll begin shunning that person when they haven't done nothing to you after a while it will become such a reality to you to you actually believe that person doesn't like it now what's taking place from this Avenue of your spirit of imagination you're beginning to create a situation what is nothing but a lie but it is not a lie to you because you've got more than one witness you've got it in your imagination you've got it in your thinking your brain has now released a hormone that is associated with this negative thought and then when you think about brother Rob or whoever else that it would be this feeling comes over you and you begin to call their name and you say now he he don't like me he don't like me and yet my daughter goes to the youth service and how am I going to treat him the next time that I see him or I'm going to go ahead and tell you how you're going to treat him you're going to treat him with an attitude and you're going to treat him as if though he's done something wrong when in reality he hasn't done one thing at all but it's all in your imagination well praise the Lord this will be the start of a new series wouldn't it my my now once it becomes such a reality the prophet said to you that you actually believe the person doesn't like it now there's no facts there's no proof but you have this in your imagination and then you have these thoughts and you feel it it's just real so the next time you say well maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong and maybe if there's perhaps that I misunderstood but Rob maybe that brother it wasn't that Islamic but he's just as brother the only saves a man on a mission he's a guy you know he's got all these things that he's doing but I'm going to try it again I'm going to try again well the next time you see brother rob you know somebody just text him on the phone brother Rob we haven't used service when's the next one I'm so sick because Wayne had no use cells I'm all upset and brother Robin says oh I'm so sorry oh it's my fault we should had another youth service I'm so sorry and just so happens he walks right by you and then all of a sudden your brain associated with this thought releases this hormone again and you feel this anybody ever felt a flushing or a sensation in your body when a certain thing is mentioned or a certain person is mentioned wow my goodness so you all aren't as spiritual as you thought you were are you you see you're not only Supernatural but you're very very natural now watch he said you might ball them out wow you might bawl them out or say something to them now he said it for instance it's your wife or your husband nobody that's married please move don't bat an eye don't smile don't friends just look our mediocre you know she's watching you Brothers I'm telling you she's or some neighbor or something like that and the person is absolutely innocent of any ill saying but it's because that you just imagine that it's so till it become a reality to you you mean we have the ability as human beings to create and form something from nothing and it is so real to us our senses tell us it's real the hormones in our brain tell us it's real at our imagination it tells us it's real and that person could say brother they notice you you know kind of a boy and brother if I did anything to you no no that's a big one right there now you think so we can all be that easily deceived by ourselves he said that wasn't the devil Paul devil bless his soul I mean hell he gets blamed for so much stuff he ain't guilty of at least take the blame for what you do he's going to burn long enough of what he's done the least be man or woman enough to just admit what you've done yourself a lot of the things that we deal with in life are self-inflicted though we blame everybody else for us now once he said it's because you just imagine it so till it become a reality to you now watch how that the psyche of the human being is made up so not just now of even Christians the prophet of the Messiah says this here the other night I saw on a telecast of a man with psychic mental Faith he sat a glass of water and stood back and kept concentrating on that glass of water till it bursted so you're a man that's not a Christian he's not a Believer but he sets a glass of water in a spot and he sits there and concentrates concentrates concentrates until he bursts the glass with his psychic power and he said the glass cracked and the water run out just pure mental concentration that's his fibers that's his makeup now he's got a power given to him by mental thinking that can break a glass of water him being a sinner so that shows that there's something that way in a man I said that's a fallen man how much more if man could only get back to God and let God take that turn that loose in the kingdom of God praise the Lord so can you imagine then if a person that's not a Believer would be able to concentrate now this is plastic so I don't figure we can break it but if we would be able to sit there and concentrate and concentrate on that if it were glass enough to be able to project our psychic mental powers to that to word that somehow by frequency vibration however it works it would actually burst that vessel and cause the liquid to spill out I wonder if we could ever Focus that by the spirit of God if we wouldn't be able to take an attitude or an Avenue of people that don't like us don't care for us or whatever instead of breaking a glass wonder if we could break bondage wonder if we couldn't break a hard feeling or something between you and a brother you and a family member or whatever more that by the spirit of God not psychic Faith but the spirit of God taking you as a son or daughter of God and you creating an atmosphere around that individual to let them know you do love them and you careful now I wonder if it wouldn't be a greater body of the Lord Jesus Christ now watch this so here we look at Elijah and we know that that brother random of course was a human being like all the rest of us and I I love this statement here because it shows us The Human Side imperfect Faith he said I get spells too you know I get moody anybody ever get into spells what we call spells anybody ever get moody all the rescue Angels were happy to have you all visiting with us today so I get I said I get to a spot what gets me is where I get into those spells that I get overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world now remember this is 1963. the prophet has been preaching for many many years he's known by people around the world hundreds of thousands of people have been affected by his ministry wonder why that did not drive this away from him wonder why Satan was able to tell him this and it actually bothered him enough that he would believe it wow so you mean having friends and having acquaintances and even a lot of friends there might be thousands of people that are your friends on Facebook that don't mean they're your real friends you may have folks that you go to church with that you consider your friends but it doesn't mean they're really really truly your friend you understand what I'm saying but apparently there was enough truth to this that it really bothered him you know Satan wouldn't waste his time telling you something that wouldn't have some sort of effect on you how many knows that's right now he said so Satan would tell him nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend now notice he didn't say a million or a hundred thousand or ten thousand but Satan told him you really haven't got a one you really haven't got one friend how in the world is that possible that that could actually be a believable temptation to the prophet of God well most of the people that come to him wanted something they wanted prayer they wanted answers to this that the other they wanted something how many came to him that didn't want anything that just really wanted to be a friend and a buddy and a pal you understand that so many of them they constantly wanted something so this was of a believable Temptation now once he said and remember I'm not immune to that Temptation I got to overcome that okay so if that was something he had to overcome I wonder about some of us here today nobody in the church loves you nobody likes you you know this one don't like you this one don't like you now for some that I that don't even bother me I don't even care well there's something wrong with you if you don't want to be loved then there's something missing in your life now let me go in this way in the Avenue of of Science and other clinical studies and I know some of it's going to freak out for a few minutes but just give me a few minutes before you shut me down clinical studies show that when we fill our minds with negative thoughts it may become easier to give in to feelings of helplessness and despair have you ever notice that when you get down and you get weary and the longer you think that way the lower you become and the more down you become well here's the reason why now remember what medical science has done has been able to break into the anatomy of the body and understand what makes us the way we are they always don't have the answer we know that but it's amazing how parallel they run and you just be patient with me and I'll bring you some quotes here that's exactly what they say these feelings can lead to unhealthy behavior that reinforce negative thinking patterns so it's like the more we think negative and the more we think nobody loves me nobody likes me then it leads to actually more negative thinking so you think well nobody loves now I'm not a part I'm not important you know if I don't come to church ain't no big deal nobody loves me and the more you think about it the more it's easier for you to think about it so the more you think about it the more you think about it and the more you think about it the more you think about it and the more you think about it the more real it becomes to you and your brain is releasing these hormones inside of your body then when you think about church you get this feeling that runs over you mom negative thinking can have a significant impact on our hormones and the body a report from the University of Minnesota examines how negative thoughts and feelings can activate the body's stress response so when we're thinking negative then here it's releasing the cortisol inside of our body and it triggers fight or flight so it triggers this inside of us stress triggers the release of cortisol and other hormones that can cause physical and emotional distress this Cascade of hormones increases inflammation in the body oh my goodness leading to a higher risk of developing illnesses such as heart disease all my and diabetes and yet we watch our cholesterol and we watch the amount of eggs we eat we don't like to worry about that today as high as they are doing we watch this and we watch that but I wonder do you understand much of our trouble no doubt is coming from who us our worries our anxieties all of these things we go through and we are releasing them from the factory inside of our own bodies the factory inside of our own bodies are releasing these negative things and that it causes us to get sick and other avenues of our life and who does the devil want to blame for it God of course what is God's fault God didn't keep it God never told you to worry God never told you to be anxious oh Hallelujah God don't tell you to give up God don't tell you to feel helpless negative thinking can also affect our relationships with others in a variety of ways for example negative thought patterns can lead to avoidance behaviors now listen to this avoidance behavior such as closing yourself off from others or refusing to engage in meaningful conversation as a result negative thinking often leads to increased feelings of isolation and loneliness so the negative thinking itself tends to make us to where we just close ourself off from everybody else and then that leads to more loneliness which means you're going to close yourself off to everybody else which leads to more well nobody understands me and nobody wants me which is going to lead to more what don't you understand we are our greatest enemy it's us friends it's our Humanity that's our United States were held in this prison house and all these things going on inside of us and if we're not careful but good to a place we think God don't even care well if we get there we're really in bad shape aren't we some behaviors to luck out for that indicate negative thinking everybody listen include jumping to conclusions blame shifting making assumptions expecting the worst making comparisons why are y'all looking like a hound dog in the hen house floor this morning over generalizing so these are attributes of a person filling negative thoughts I read it again just in case you missed it jumping to conclusions blame shifting making assumptions expecting the worst I always had six legs I'd raise them all these behaviors can lead to resentment or mistrust making it difficult for people to build a strong connection with you negative thinking can be a powerful force in our Lives having a negative impact on our Mental Health and well-being if left unchecked negative thoughts can take a toll on your physical health and your relationships and daily function all right you say brother down there that ain't nothing but psychology really okay well let's consult Elijah you see we have lots of Hope and not much Faith but we want to change from hope today to positive faith and there's only one way we can get positive faith that's by thinking of positive things one way that we can give positive faith and that is by amen thinking of positive things and the church said oh everybody I thought Faith come to hearing and hearing by the word it does but you're sharing it alone won't do you no good you've got to take it into your mind as shame said and be not a forgetful hearer so you walk out of here today and you think about that was some great quotes that was some great scripture oh man that was a really good sermon I enjoyed it but you're going to say God by your grace I want to apply to my life and I ain't waiting till tomorrow I'm going to start today I want to get this negative stuff out of me I'm going to get away from this negativity I'm negative about church I'm a negative about the brothers and sisters I'm negative about God I am sick of being negative I want to be a positive asset to the kingdom of God notice this when you get to thinking about Divine Healing you go to thinking about Christ keep him on your mind and of course the scripture that we read if there be any praise think on this in your virtue think on this if any thought that comes by that says maybe it couldn't be so get it out of your mind right quick think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through don't let it stop anyhow if it starts keep your thoughts positive now watch he jumps down and there's a person sitting there in a wheelchair the very next paragraph he says now don't think sitting there in that wheelchair that you're hopeless and helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass you can you imagine a person sitting there in a wheelchair they're looking at the paralysis or whatever it is maybe they've been there for years and years and yet you got this servant of God tell telling you don't never let what are they going to do act like they're not in the wheelchair they're going to act like they can walk of course what they're going to do is look to the promise of God I may be in here today but tomorrow may be my day of Deliverance I don't know how I don't know when but I believe his word what will that do it changes them oh my again he says the Bible says if there be any praise any virtue think on these things wondering if I'll be called in the prayer line or not don't think that kind of negative thought don't let it pass through your mind make every word positive God forgive us make every word positive and every thought positive now this is from the spiritual side and this is next statement is from the scientific side our amazing brain can make decisions and respond quickly to threats for our safety and survival now think when God made man there was no cause there were no need of the brain being able to make a a decision a quick response and three quarters of a second but aren't you glad God paced it so that knowing there would be automobiles so automatically somebody stops in front of you bam before you even think about it you've got your foot on the brake now what if God would have made that response two and a half minutes long and somebody stops in front of you and you are Mr sloths you won't last that long I'll be preaching your funeral next week but what's amazing to me when you look at this that when man fell I woke up early this morning thinking about this I thought my what must have happened to the human body when Adam fell in the Garden of Eden it's something about our makeup not only in our soul but listen to this about the brain when we stress or worry or have negative thinking we trick our brains into believing there is an immediate threat so when we go to thinking negative and down and all that we are tricking our brain into thinking there's a negative threat Lord have mercy it's one of some of our brains him work we think so much negative stuff as a result our fight or flight response kicks in our brains now this is what I found so amazing our brains are pre-wired to respond to negative thoughts and feelings more quickly than positive this is what hit me Harry this morning I was thinking that change somehow in the Garden of Eden you see the chains had come over Adam it must have been in his hormones and must have been in his brain it must have been in the response of the human spirit all of this chains brother John inside the anatomy of the man began to change because Adam would have never even thought a negative thought prior to his fall in the Garden of Eden everything would have been positive everything would have been wonderful and when the chains come over the man watch him when the voice of God when the voice of God comes in the Garden of Eden that he hears it then what happens this negative thought Adam is afraid he never felt fear before so what kicks in fight or flight so he runs he hide why because his brain for the first time is releasing the hormone of cortisol and Adam never felt it before it must have been a rush of emotions in his body and he runs and hides behind the tree he's never felt it before his heart pumping and racing his blood pressure fluctuating the flushing in his face all this going on inside of his body I switch what we felt all of our entire life but I'm telling you one thing we're going back to another body when there won't be no more hormones released like this in her body there won't be no fighting or fight it'll be eternal life eternal Joy Eternal peace can't you see why we need such a change in our bodies our brains are pre-wired to respond to negative thoughts and feelings more quickly than positive when we think positively our brain assumes that everything is under control and no action is needed so when you're just sitting there thinking you know whatever the positive thoughts in your mind God loves me everything's going to be all right I mean it's looking bad but everything is going to be all right your brain is just in modern terminology chilling out why because there's nothing from your thought pattern that's releasing to this almond-shaped part of your gray matter that's saying danger danger danger danger positive thoughts are calming it down you know Erica's many of you know have been going through this cancer situation I don't know how many of the doctors and things that that we've been to and they've emphasized it over and over again positive thoughts positive thinking thinking the right way thinking and looking at how many knows that they do that many of them are broken to bang and the doctor's offices and different ones that we've been into and on this wall there'll be a positive thought there'll be a scripture there there'll be something there what's it for to lift up your attitude to be able to keep you higher in that sphere why because they know it they know it by the autonomy and looking at how we are made up that it releases something in our body and if people go in in a negative way brother Daryl told me something several years ago that a man whenever he was still in surgery a man come in at a very minor surgery he was going to face at the VA and the man come in and said I'm not going to live my brother said no buddy you're going to be fine we do this all the time you're going to be perfect if I know I'm not no I'm not I'm gonna die this is going to kill me said no no you're not going to die they got into the surgery something went terribly wrong the man died on the operating table brother said he thought about it so many times they put the man out under the anesthesia it is his mindset it's where he's at oh my what about us as the people of God oh it's getting dark out there brother Donnie Leia to see us at the end time yes it is oh I'm afraid I'm going to be overcome I'd get them thoughts out of my mind this morning oh no I'm going to get over take him to drinking with this no sir you stand by the grace of God and say greater is he that is in me that he that is in the world I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy Soul Prosper I'm more than a conqueror Delight thyself also in the Lord he will give Thee the desires of thine heart if any two on Earth agree is touching anything it shall be done whatever you ask in my name I will do it oh my recent studies show that the psychological stress is causing an overuse of the powerful safety system in our bodies weakening our immune system you can take Vitamin C till you turn into one of them jelly vitamin C's some of you've got the office regimen that ever was covet anxiety has drove some of us batty we're taking vitamin D by the box of Carlos we're taking vitamins see it we're rubbing all on our feet and rubbing all on our hands and rubbing this and that and well go ahead and look at me funny if you want to scared to death the covet scared to death of the fluid I'll tell you one thing I believe if we take God's word and put it in our heart and on our mouths it does no telling what it will do just in our natural body oh my because negative thoughts and the fear and the trauma of this and that what does it do it lowers your immune system I've got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost and in your immune system the Holy Ghost is not controlling your immune system you need your mouth too and your brain too and your thoughts to control it [Applause] listen this thinking negatively about your problems not only doesn't help solve anything it makes it harder actually makes it harder for you to think of the helpful solution well John when I started looking at this I rolled up my sleeves and I said devil where are you I'm ready to box you right in the mouth look at what you've done to us you put us under this negative thinking knowing that our brain gets so overloaded with all this stuff that we can't even think properly in the right Avenue and who's doing it oh yeah I will blame the devil it's us now let me read to you this little thing in your brain each one of you have it today you've never seen it nor thy amygdala if you have a tendency to overreact to stress it could be to changes in your brain brought on by negative thinking now can you imagine you notice what I'm trying to do today I'm trying to change your brain as well as your soul I don't want you just to get born again and filled with the Holy Ghost I want your amygdala to be changed might be a good sermon to preach in a convention sometime hahaha notice what happens if you have a tendency to overreact to stress it could be due to changes in your brain brought on by negative thinking so how you react to stress can be dictated by negative thinking negative experiences are stored in the brain by the amygdala ah stored there the amygdala is also responsible for the brain's fight or fight response the prefrontal cortex y'all didn't know you have on them either did you the prefrontal cortex regulates our response to stressors so this little almond-shaped gray matter in your brain it controls this response fight or fight also has to do with memory so you see a certain person relive a certain thing and all of a sudden it brings it back I told you before I preaching several years ago in Arkansas and there's a brother there a friend of mine I've known him for years and years and I was preaching on the Avenue of scars and things like that and I noticed the brother as I was speaking and he was so intent and I noticed him as he started sweating like in the service that'd been unusual for me because I was doing the preaching but he just sitting there and I just noticed his demeanor everything about him was so different and they brought out a red Gatorade for me in case I needed it when I preached and I noticed as I unscrewed that and I drank part of it and it just this look came on his face so at the end of the service he come up for prayer he called me as I was driving down the road Karen I left the service last night that that not heading home and he said brother Donnie I'm sure you noticed I was acting different I said I did Brother they said well let me tell you I was a builder a contractor several years ago and he said they would let us dig a pit and we would burn the refuse two befores and this and that and the other and said one morning as we were putting this my helpers and myself all this garbage in this pit I stepped to the edge of this pit the farm was already going and the side gave way and I fell into the fire and he said I started hollering and screaming for the guys to come and help me and they come and they they got me out of there but by the time they got him out his body was burned and he had some places on him and burned him really bad they'd stop that morning coming to work and they got a cooler and they bought several different types of you guessed it Gatorade so they bring to him a great big large Gatorade and he starts drinking it and the ambulance comes and gets him he had some pretty severe burns on his body and he said as you were preaching that I begin to relive it and his body was reacting to that memory so he was sweating nor doubt the hormones being released in his body anybody had ever had something similar to happen somebody's name is mentioned or a preacher mentions a certain circumstances or situation and you get all nervous and you feel like everybody's looking at you what is that that's coming from within you the hormones in your body are associated with that and that relives it again then when you go to thinking that way it puts the body in this this fight or flight I mean I've watched people before and I've honestly thought some of them I've seen them do it when you go to preaching on a certain thing they'll get up and run out they can't take it they cannot take it because in their mind they are reliving that and the thing they do is flight and they get up and they leave they cannot stand what it does that is so sad to me why don't we pray for people for these things why don't is it the physical part in the body why is it headaches back aches toe aches this and that and the other I wonder how many are hurting my friends that have all these things inside of their spirit and they live a life in bondage day in and day out and what are their bars what are their bars what is their prison thoughts memories affections that's been sown in the wrong way notice this oh my someone who's faced with a stressful situation like being in a traffic jam normally assesses the level of the threat in their safety to their safety and concludes that the threat is pretty much just an annoyance now that blue-haired woman driving down the road on Milligan Highway and she's going 21 miles an hour how do you know because you cocked her it's a 40 mile an hour speed zoning you're in a hurry you've got to go here and there there she is and you're saying oh my goodness oh my goodness in reality that is an annoyance more than it is a danger to your life unless you Pastor on the double yellow line but what do we do depending on how our makeup is and whether we lean towards a positive or the negative some folks stress out we're living in one of the most stressful times it's ever been you don't ask me go to Walmart this evening and you fixing to pull into that parking spot right there and that person who saw that a half a mile away they wanted that parking spot and they'll talk to you worse than if you as a dog well they not you'd get pulled out in front of them you get out of their way they're honking their horn they pull up us out of you and look at you like they say what did I do what did I do people are living under such stress is it any Wonder friends that people pull out their gun and kill somebody over somebody pulling out from why because this is where Satan wants us to live he wants us to live so stressed out that we can't even enjoy life we can't enjoy God we cannot enjoy being with our family and our loved one because everybody is just so stressed foreign nerve pills from one another you can tell when people are getting old I've noticed in the last few years myself and it makes me realize how I'm getting older because you hear the people you're sitting around talking about and they're describing their medications and they're talking about their Medicare card and they're telling you realize yeah I've definitely changed dispensations ever you still wasn't my line of talk and you realize oh I've been so stressing which one do you take and I it amazes me how well first our people are on medications it amazing me oh yeah I take so many milligrams of that too and I think that have you heard of this one that now I'll tell you what I heard I heard it is so good if you take a little bit around and swish it around with a little bit of banana oil and you mix it with a little bit of this and that and the other you know and it's amazing how medical that we are what is it friends we're searching for peace we're searching for a little bit of relief from distress and this pressure that we live under I'll tell you where it's going to come from to a real Believer from within yourself Oh Glory to God if we can get our minds and our soul in harmony with God's word you can tone your own world around from within you [Applause] as far as your brain is concerned every thought every thought releases brain chemicals being focused on negative thoughts effectively saps the brain of positive forcefulness slows it down and goes to dimming the brain's ability to function even creating creating depression now remember Satan is not a creator but if he can get you and I sad enough low enough than we ourselves will create our own depression well you figure I just figured I need to take myself at the time just knock myself out this morning wow you mean I am truly my greatest enemy on the flip side thinking positive happy hopeful optimistic joyful thoughts decreases cortisol and produces serotonin ah do you understand this is what cocaine does do you understand many of the addictive drugs that people get so addicted to that it goes to that part of your brain which is the feel-good part and it releases these Mega doses of dopamine and serotonin and this is why people get so addicted to it because cocaine and many of these other things it releases it in such high doses that once they feel that high then they've got to get back again and again and again but the thing of it is once they take it they have to have more and more and more the next time unless of course you realize the true Factory can be within yourself you can be your own Factory as a child of God of producing these good things within yourself you can also be one casting out Devils of them evil thoughts praise the Lord can you imagine that God made the brain and apparently it fell in the father whenever Adam's Body if it did produce cortisol it had been hell captive until the fall and once man fell then the ability to release this cortisol in his body was then he began to experience it it must have been frightening it must have been frightening for Adam the first time that he felt this Mega release of cortisol in his body and his serotonin the dopamine was so minimized and it became fearful and afraid of what is what is this feeling I've never felt this way before what is it this is why Christians get in such anxiety and get so stressful little Saturn look at me don't you understand that Christians can be depressed Christians can get to a place where they have to go to a mental institution that don't mean they're not saved people that don't mean they're not children of God they've got overwhelmed by the factory in their own bodies oh so on the flip side thinking positive happy hopeful optimistic joyful thoughts decrease his cortisol produce serotonin which creates a sense of well-being this helps your brain to function at Peak capacity why wouldn't that be awesome I'm not sure how far I could pass your mind has ever been but it's been nice at least once before I die to reach the peak listen to this happy thoughts and positive thinking in general support brain growth as well as the generation and reinforcement of new synopsis whatever that is especially in the prefrontal core fix PVC they call it which serves as the integration Center of all your brain mind functions so you just sitting around thinking oh Jesus I love you Jesus You're My Healer oh God how good you are you've been go you've been so good to me Lord You've healed me you've saved me you've Sanctified me Lord I don't know what's fixing to come ahead but I know one thing you're the one who holds the future and all of a sudden your cortisol is getting all bucket down man this is going down and your serotonin said and what does it do it releases this in your brain and it rewards your body this is what this is It's a reward of your body for thinking in a positive way so when you think in a positive way then these hormones are released from the PFC out of your brain and it's rewarding your body for thinking that way and it's actually produces a feeling inside of you you ever think just something happy and you feel a change like and then you get a phone call or a text oh my God and you go to feeling this you know what it is it's the thought you associate every lease item the chemical Factory of your brain oh children can't you see can't you see what God wants us to be living in the middle of hell he don't want us to be bound by hell living in the middle of depression living in the middle of sadness God don't want us to be controlled by sadness he wants us to be a little Creator within ourself let me close although you'll always have another sort of simple statement right here somebody needs to make a t-shirt or something with this although you'll always have stress and obstacles in your life they don't have to Define your mindset as you replace pessimistic thinking with optimism your life can be more abundant you will have the occasional storms but your positive outlook this part I'm talking about right here becomes your umbrella you're positive outlook becomes your umbrella so the umbrella as you know does not drive away the storm your umbrella does not make the clouds by the Jack disappear but you have your own little personal protection now it may not be but this bigger you might have one of them great old Biggins if the Deacon Brothers has got Brother JD brought me in on one a while ago it was a pretty good size of the thing so me and him both was able to get under it if we get enough positivity about the Holy Ghost Inside of us we might have enough room for a brother or a sister or maybe a daughter of God that's going through such sadness in their life they might need a little bit of protection under your umbrella oh my hallelujah what can God do for us if we can get our thinking right listen praise the Lord praise the Lord oh don't you love him let me read this to you now it's a strange saying the prophet said people will say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're talking his language right then you mustn't ever don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time amen amen I'm saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart do you believe in Divine Healing because all my heart he says let your testimony always in your thoughts never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it and when it starts out don't entertain it well you say I can't keep them thoughts from coming well be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place and this is your place God wants this to be your happy place this is your place right here now once the farmer said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he sure could stop him from roosting you can't help thoughts when they come but don't entertain them pass them on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior all things are mined by God's grace I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confess he has done it for you my Lord he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us here's our ABC's again as we accept it a and only Omar as we believe it be and confess it see a b c except believe confess now remember the prophet finished that story about that farmer and saying that the farmer said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over but if they roosted there's no negative thoughts that might turn on top of that speaker so he said you got a double barrel shotgun Old and New Testament hang tight with me this one sent back on top by camera let me take care of him nobody loves you you ain't got a friend in the world you sisters ought to be shotgun packing toten's women your brothers ought to be shotgun packing Toten Brothers I'll tell you one thing we started packing more like that aiming them at the Devil instead of Amen to one another would be a whole lot better off we're really good at shooting one another and the church said help us Lord can you say that help me Lord that's about his if you would Hemi doesn't want this just to be words today but you want it to be something that God helps you with me too me too Lord Heavenly Father we ask you today Lord Jesus that you would help us Lord as I begin to study this I realize that we're born with this negativity about us many of us were fed this by our parents Maybe by children we know how sometimes cruel children can be that we go went to school with that criticizes us and ridicule us no doubt some of these people here today can remember things they went through at school and maybe at home things that set a negative thing about them Lord I remember myself we was always poor daddy worked at a minimum wage and me being the oldest of seven kids so we never had nice things I remember standing on the playground Wayne County Elementary School wishing I had a friend I'd stand out there by myself recess after recess nobody wouldn't speak to me had on ragged clothes if we got new shoes or anything like that whenever we did get them they all come from the dollar store and everybody knew they did so they'd laugh at us make fun of us and Lord we know those things can affect us even when we get older Lord God we pray today that you would help us not to just focus maybe on our upbringing and our clothes didn't come from the mall and we didn't have the very best of purses and we didn't have the very best of tennis shoes and that sort of thing people thought just life huh that don't make no difference but if they really be truthful they'd say a lot of their problems tie back to such things when they were young some are rejected by their parents some father walked off and left a mother walked off and left him it instilled the fear in them they hold that trauma afraid they'll be left their whole life Lord God please help us Jesus help us Lord we know Lord that these things are formed in our brain called dendrites it's like the branches on a tree bad memories and good memories both make these dendrites and whenever something will run across our mind to recall the bad memory of an individual or something that happened that hormone released in our body and it causes the same feeling that thing may have happened 30 years ago that's why the discernment the prophet would call people out and tell them things that happened to him 30 years before that because that dendrite was stored in the brain but the way to get rid of those is to make more good ones so maybe there's some here today struggling in their marriage and they're having a hard time forgiving one another for this and that help them Lord to try to move beyond the past and the failures and start making new memories maybe they've been burnt by church maybe they've been burnt by preachers and they let them bad memories keep them out Lord God may we start today making new ones help us Jesus help us take control of this Factory in our body called our brain that daily releases all these multiplication of hormones in our body we quote the scriptures and quote the scriptures and we love you with all of our heart and we want to be faithful and true and we're trying to approach it from the soul and we think it's Soul trouble that's why many of them struggle with having the Holy Ghost because they think it's Soul trouble when a lot of it ain't Soul trouble it's brain trouble it's Spirit trouble it's dendrite trouble it's memory trouble imagination trouble oh Jesus speak to us today I pray father we love you today Father anybody here just by raising your hands signifying to the Lord Lord I need your help today I need your help Jesus we love you father come by this way Lord may not our imagination control us our affection our memory but may the spirit of God so control us from our soul that it brings our bodies subject to the word it brings our spirit and all these memories and things that we had in our life that have haunted us Lord God may we be able to have new thoughts and new memories may we think on whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are of a good report think on these things for we know the word said for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he help us I pray Lord God peace of God cover me cover me her sister Holly is facing a surgery concerning her neck many of you probably know about it a very serious thing naturally the human part she's dreading it and fearful of it but Henry believes today the Lord can bring peace to our sister if this is God's way we know the prophet said God heals my surgery God heals my love God heals my music God heals many different Avenues if this is the Lord's God's way then we'll just accept it that way this is John our faith together with her Satan you're a liar I condemn you in the name of Jesus go back to hell where you come from this is a daughter of God it's not enough that you attack her but now she's looking at a way which she can be remedied by this and now what do you do you low down devil now you try to encapsulate her heart and fear but in the name of Jesus I resent this fear Hallelujah for the word says Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me Lord God in the name of Jesus I rebuke this fear away from my sister right now father you see Lord the doctors have done everything they know to do up to this stage and this is what they feel like is the next stage to bring our sister relief of this situation father I pray in Jesus Christ's name May the spirit of God be with her Lord give her that peace Lord the anxiety for waiting for a couple of more weeks for it to happen oh God In The Name of Jesus may she be able to walk away from here today with a peace in her heart knowing that in that surgery room that day the angels of God will be there the spirit of God will guide that surgeon's hand be with her father made accomplish Lord what they wanted to I pray oh Hallelujah in the name of Jesus thank you thank you Father thank you Lord thank you brother Larry got a situation with his heart and the Lord knows all about it very serious situations versus what the doctor says but the more serious the greater the victory the greater the miracle in our God we love brother Larry don't want to

really been tough on her she's had a lot of pain associated with it how many believes Our God can go right there where she's at this morning since she's been a little old thing she's loved to go to church this thing has kept out of service after service and I believe God's going to turn it around disagree together Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus you see this needing Erica's body today Lord I know how she loves church we took her in the office the other day at the new place and showed her the couch sitting there and told her she'd be able to come in there and lay down if she wasn't strong enough to be able to set out in the audience in a monitor there we should be able to watch the service if that happens we're just believing that's going to be temporary until she's going to be able to walk out on that platform amen and sit out there with the saints of God and worship and praise dear God you see this need in our body you see what the doctors call it neuroendocrine tumor you see their diagnosis you say that you see what they say there's no cure this that the other but that's their report and no doubt the best they know and we're thankful for everything that they have done to be able to help her but we're looking today to another report and that's the one we choose to believe we want to overwhelm our brain with those positive thoughts Lord God would you touch your father you see the pain she's been having Lord in the name of Jesus when you come to this earth you were associated with pain you felt pain all types of pain would you go to are now Lord God and touch her in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you Saints love you in the Lord Lord willing I'm not sure brother we've probably already announced it Be Heaven first we have Heaven more like an open house well I guess in a house against open Church ain't it open church on Wednesday night just so everybody can kind of come in and look at it and you know look around try to find your seat I don't know how many people's already been there picking out their seats so hopefully we will have 10 people wanting the same seat the only problem I foresee with doing it is one couple come in the brother want to sit on this side and his wife wanted to sit over there so hopefully they'll get that worked out but we thought it'd be easier for you to come in just look around for those of you that haven't been there and then we'll have the first service next Sunday and we're just looking forward for what the Lord is going to do for us there so if you can come there Wednesday night you're more than welcome to come and just have some time of Fellowship as we look around then we're going to have some singing and just remember the all the equipment there is new the audio the video the cameras the internet so please be patient with our brothers we've got some very impatient streamers and whenever something goes happen within two or three minutes they're ringing these brother's phone so please just be patient with us while we make this transition we'll hopefully make it better so we don't want people to lose their religion because they couldn't stream a service so be patient with this as we go through this learning process that means in love with the Lord today Mr Sparrow heads together shall we for the Johnson becoming dismiss this buddy in word of prayer literally get ready
