You know, our our prayer line last Saturday night, uh I believe the Lord has done and will do great things because of that. Brother Daryl preached such a a tremendous message. You agree with that? He did. He really did. And all the ministers and the meeting itself was just a tremendous success. Brother Greg Parker sends this in as a testimony. I want to thank the Lord for the healing touch he gave me going through the prayer line. I had multiple tests in June of 24 that revealed cancer. In January, I had more tests that confirmed I had eight tumors. On Monday, I had one more indepth scan that only showed one small spot. The doctor said he could not understand why it changed. Well, we do, don't we? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. He has backed off on me having radiation and surgery. I go back in three months. I'm believing that that small spot will be gone. Somebody say, "May it be so." May it be so. Give the Lord a good handicap of praise this morning. Let's sing some more of that, buddy. Yes, he's Oh, sing it to him, church.

Look at your neighbor and tell him you're glad to see him in the house of God this morning. Praise the Lord. What a privilege it is. We have visitors among us today. We want to welcome you. Glad to have you with us. all those that would be streaming the service locally and around the world. We want to say God bless those folks as they enter into this service with us today. Could we give all those folks a good hand this morning if you will? Praise the Lord. We're going to look at our prayer request. Brother Randy Walton uh turns this in for Tony Walton. COPD, having breathing problems, uh has cancer. Pray for his soul most of all. So, we want to remember that prayer request today. Brother Josh Jenkins sends this in uh asking for prayer for my brother-in-law Samuel Burns, who got into a motorcycle accident two days ago. Badly, broke his ankle and foot. Already had one surgery, has another tomorrow, needing the Lord's help with healing and financial grace through all this whole endeavor. So, we just want to commit that need unto the Lord this morning. Brother George Hamlin sends us in to please pray for a c-orker Christy Thomas. She is recovering from surgery and having a heart cath today. So, we want to remember that as we pray. Sister Ruth Louise Jax wants to thank everyone for their prayers and is asking that we continue to pray for her daughters. We'll commit that to the Lord. Sister Laura Wo says to please remember Nancy, a dear friend of ours in the hospital, really weak and trying to recover from different health issues and surgeries. Thank you and may God bless. So we pray for that need today. Peggy Ward is requesting prayer for her sister Nora Tibs. She had a stroke yesterday is currently in the hospital. Please pray that she will have a speedy and complete recovery without any complications. So we want to commit that unto the Lord. Danielle Nunley Draper sends this in. My coworker and friend uh Chassidy Sawyer needs her prayer. She's been experiencing double vision and headaches for a while. finally went to the hospital. She has an aneurysm wrapped around her cortoid uh corateed artery. They transferred her to the UT hospital last night. No doctors here would take her case. So, we certainly want to remember that need today as we pray. Once again, thank the Lord for brother Greg Parker's testimony. All the unspoken prayer request. I know there's tremendous needs among us today. We just want to commit all these things unto the Lord. We know he's more than able to meet all of our needs. We believe that, don't we? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that in this age of your stage in your journey, in this age of time, that you have got a tremendous hope in the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You think about where you would be this morning without him. &gt;&gt; Man, I don't even want to think about it. Do you? Thank God for grace. &gt;&gt; Thank God for revelation. Thank God for the message. Thank God for the messenger. Thank God I'm not ashamed to be identified with any of it. How about you?

We have to fight through these things. They're not going to be easy for us sometimes. But God, there are so many requests and we thank you that we have a place to bring them. There's a there's a bomb in Gilead. If we can just believe and have no sin in our life, Lord, that you promised it. It's like it's like the children of Israel, Lord. They went through without a without a death until sin come in the camp. We don't want sin in our camp, Lord. Not in ourselves we're talking about. And if we can just be that way, God, we know you you'll hear our prayer. We know you'll walk with us. You'll help us. You'll save our children. You'll do whatever whatever that you promise, Lord, in the message. God, be with our pastor, the speaker this day. Anointing our knowing our ears we might hear and understand.

Ushers, if you'd like to come at this time, we'll receive the morning tithe and offering. Let's sing of this old song. We've sung it a lot around here, but it's more true today than it was yesterday.

[Music] &gt;&gt; There's a kind of thing that just breaks. &gt;&gt; Oh, breaks him down to his knees. I've been broken more than a time or two. &gt;&gt; Then Lord, you picked me up. &gt;&gt; And you showed me what it means to be a man. That's why I sing that. &gt;&gt; All I hope is in Jesus.

Hallelujah. Oh, give him a good hand clap of praise this morning. Thank you. Glory. Hallelujah. Give our singers a nice hand as you're seated today as they get ready to sing. Y'all help us sing this. Brother Greg, he's faithful. God bless you, buddy. [Music] As I look back on this road I have traveled, I see so many times how he's carried me through. And if there's one thing I've learned in my life, my redeemer is faithful and true. My redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Every morning his mercies are new. My redeemer is faithful and true. [Music] My heart rejices when I read his promise. There is a place that I've prepared just for you. [Music] And I know I'll see my Lord face to face. My redeemer is faithful and true. My redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Every morning his mercies are new. My redeemer is faithful and true. [Music] [Music] [Music] Do you believe this? And in every situation, Lord, you have proved your love for me. When I lack the understanding, how you give your grace to me, my redeemer is faithful and true. Everything he has said he will do. Every morning his mercies are new. My redeemer is faithful and true. My redeemer is faithful and true. [Music] [Music] He walked into the room. No one noticed he was there. Just a simple man they knew from Galilee. [Music] Son of a carpenter who lived right down the road. They all thought they knew what he would be. [Music] He would work with wood and build a home, maybe raise a family. [Music] But surely there'd be no great destiny. [Music] But no one knew the secrets hidden in his mother's heart. Their parents gave no hint to what they see. When he spoke, all of heaven just stood still. And the earth began to tremble beneath his father's will. When he spoke, the hearts of men began to change. And heaven fell like rain when he spoke. [Music] He never wore a priestly robe or walked with royalty. His friends were common men like you and me. [Music] He spoke of a father with a kingom and a throne. [Music] One he said no earthly eyes could see. They were all amazed this carpenter could perform such mighty deeds. and still walk in such great humility. But no one knew the secret from his father up above. They could only understand his kind of love. When he spoke, all of heaven just stood still. And the earth began to tremble beneath his father's will. And when he spoke, the hearts of men began to change. And heaven felt like rain when he spoke. And heaven fell like rain when he spoke. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Psalms three, brother. How many knows he's still speaking? &gt;&gt; He still sends his word. I'm glad. And I'm glad we have ears to hear what the spirit's saying. And thou, oh Lord, art shield for me. You're the glory and the lifter of my head. Oh, thou, oh Lord, art the shield for me. You're the glory and the lifter of my head. [Music] Many there be increased. that trouble me. Many are the demon spirits that rise against me. [Music] Many there be would say of my soul, there is no help for you and God. I cried unto the Lord with my voice. He heard me out of his holy hill. [Music] I laid me down and I slept. When I awakened, it was a precious, precious Holy Ghost sustain me. Let's sing it. Oh, thou Lord are a shield for me. You're the glory and the lifter of my head. [Music] Oh, thou, oh Lord, are a shield for me. You're the glory and the lifter of my head. [Music] I will not be afraid of 10 thousands of demons. Every evil spirit may rise up against me. I will not be afraid of 10 thousand of demons that encamp themselves against me round about for I know thou Lord are a shield for me. You're the glory and the lifter of my head. Oh, thou, oh Lord, you're a shield for me. You're the glory and the lifter of my head. Oh, Lord, you're a shield for me. You're the glory. You are the lifter of my head. For thou Lord are a shield for me. You're the glory. You're the lifter of my head. You're the glory and the lifter of my hand. [Music] What thou, oh Lord, are a shield for me. Let's sing it now. Glory and the lifter of my head [Music] still and the lifter of my [Music] Thank Thank you, Lord Jesus. Heavenly Father, how grateful we are. Those words were pinned so many thousands of years ago of a man who had been in one straight after another. We know him as the psalmist David. He had been through hardships of enemies that were Philistines, Amorites, Hittites. He'd faced the challenges of his king, not an Amorite or a Hittite, but a Jew. His brothers had turned against him. his friends, the bulls of Bashan all around him, everywhere seemed to be enemies. But he was able to lift up his eyes towards you. We look around today, Father, and we realize that we're in a similar scenario. Defectors that have pulled away from this word and they hate us. They make videos against us. They spread lies on us. Even those of our own ranks who say they believe this word, yet they adulterate the word of God. We need you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sickness, disease, political power, it's everywhere. Unrest, Father, we know there's only one hope, and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; We pray that you'd be mindful of us today, Lord. No doubt the needs of your children today, not only in this visible assembly, but those around the world would be countless for us as mortals. But Father, we pray that you'd be mindful. Take this service and speak to us that which would be another building block, as it were, for our lives. For we know all creation is waiting on the finale, the grand finale of the church ages consummating and the image of Jesus Christ returning to the earth again. And it won't be in one man, won't be in one church, but it'll be around the world. Father, we pray may we by your grace be part of that great unfolding. You see our needs, our desires, our requests. Speak to us today, Father, by your word. Lord, you see this request I have my hand on. I ask you, dear God, that you'd move for our brethren. Many different ones, Lord, that's contacted in the last week or so from around the world with needs and requests and desires. I pray you'd be mindful, Lord, of your children today in the name of Jesus. Praise the Lord. How many's happy to be in the house of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it an honor for us? Privilege for us. &gt;&gt; And a great desire, too. It's not just a responsibility to come to the house of God. I love coming to the house of God, be with his children, to be in his presence. And I know you can't see them today, but angelic beings are all through this place. When brother Brandon was here, he would tell us that they would stand at the end of each row trying to anoint people's faith. &gt;&gt; And he would say, "There's also demons there." And he said, "There's a great battle going on." And he said, "The outcome of the battle will depend upon not the angels of God or the demons, but actually on you, &gt;&gt; which way your faith would go." So, we can believe that it'll just be a, you know, so regular old type of service and we just kind of endure the preaching and we'll um just be there for a little while and we'll go home or it can be one of such eternal consequence that our lives will be changed forever. &gt;&gt; It's kind of service I want myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Let's read together today if you would our scripture that we've been looking at for quite some time. Second Peter chapter 1 verse two. One that has become so so precious and beloved to the hearts of the saints of God. I believe especially in this age knowing what God is desiring to build. Uh I want you to think of it that there could have never been another age even in the Ephesian age to where they would have desired the consummation of these scriptures to be fulfilled in their life in such a way. Peter and them couldn't have the fullness of what the cap was going to be in Leadyia because the time frame had not arrived yet. Neither could them pergamos thyus Philadelphia. But here we are. We are privileged by the grace of God. Not only facing all the demons, of course, it's accumulation of all those evil spirits, but also the mercy of God and the building of this great stature. Let's read it together. Second Peter 1:2. Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, according as his divine power. Thank you. hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature. Nature, singular, only one divine nature. &gt;&gt; Only one divine nature. &gt;&gt; That ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. And beside this, giving all diligence. Well, let me ask you as you're hearing this preached, are you giving all diligence &gt;&gt; or part or half? Or are you giving all diligence to be able to hear this and to be able to become it? Giving all diligence add to your faith virtue. And to virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance, and to temperance, patience, and to patience, godliness, which of course means to be like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And to godliness, brotherly kindness. And to brotherly kindness, charity. Amen. May the Lord bless his word. You may be seated. Let us look at one of these awesome virtues today. Patience. More than likely, everybody here has all they need of patience. Except probably for me. Oh, Carol, I see Carol's hand. Sister Barbara with Key. I'm overwhelmed. Well, my goodness. And here I thought I was just studying this for me. I guess not, brother Ben. Patience. Patience. It's an awesome thing. Very needful thing. And in the worst of all ages, God is demanding an element of patience out of his people which can only be accomplished by the work of God in their lives. Now maybe some of you have an element of human patience and you would have more patience with people and with the world and things around you than some others. Others of us, you know, we may struggle with it. But no matter how great your human patience is, it still isn't enough to meet this requirement right here because this is godly patience. So my mama could not have attributed to me nor my daddy this type of patience. Now humanly I'm a pretty patient man. But that ain't enough. Now maybe some of you are more patient than I am. And you'd say, "Well, compared to brother Donnie, I'm very patient, but you're not comparing yourself to me &gt;&gt; and I'm not comparing myself to you." But to get the true measure of where we are and where we need to come up to, we need to measure oursel today by the stature of a perfect man, which as you know is not me and it's not you. &gt;&gt; Neither is it brother Brandham or Paul or Peter. But there was one man that was perfect and of course we all know who that was, right? So when Paul and Peter and James and Jesus and they begin to write about in the New Testament, James termed it, have you not heard of the patience of Job? Now, had James not wrote about that in that way, I wonder if we would have really brought into view Job's patience or would we have considered it Job's faith? Now, we give Job great credit because he was a man of great faith. But James did not focus on Job's faith, but he focused on Job's patience. faith can bring to pass great supernatural events in our life and we ain't got a nickels worth of patience. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the thing that's profound to me that a lot of people can come and be prayed for and they may have a miraculous type of faith. Uh there's people come through the prayer line that wasn't really even consecrated to God cuz I I know some of them and yet God moved for them in a supernatural way. I was reading of a testimony yesterday. Phenomenal what the Lord did. The person is really not even a a consecrated person in their life before God. Yet I've prayed for them different times. They don't really come to our church, but I prayed for them in different times and seeing God move for them because they have such faith that if men of God will pray for them that God will do something. And once again, the Lord did a great phenomenal thing right here last week for this particular individual. But yet, when it comes to faithfully being able to serve the Lord, it's like people cannot grasp a hold to that. I remember a man that I I've been around for years of my life. And every time that man would get sick, he would ask for a prayer cloth, one of my ties, one of my handkerchiefs, he would send me different garments for me to wear. So I would stick a tie in my pocket or, you know, whatever it was. And as soon as that man would get that prayer cross, no matter what was wrong with him and he was in the hospital multiple times, by the next day or at least the second day, he'd be checking out and going home well. &gt;&gt; But yet, the man could never come to a spot to where he was able to accept the Lord Jesus as his free partner of his sins and have a godly walk before God. So you think what did that kind of face what did it do for him? Well, it helped him along life's journey and it brought healing to him and help and maybe many of you know of people the same way. And there's people that we pray for and I always pray for them. You'll turn in prayer requests for your children. Remember my son, he's got this. Remember my daughter, she's got this. And I get every one of them. They're laid back on my desk. I take them home with me. I read them. I pray over them. And I know the child. I I know the daughter, the granddaughter, the son, whatever it is, the husband or the wife. And they're not really even professed believers yet. I pray for them with all of my heart because I know the Lord Jesus loves humanity. And what I pray for them in the sense is that God will not only bring healing to them, but may that be the avenue that they will see the grace of God brought them healing. And the same grace of God wants to bring complete deliverance to their soul and set them free from sin, which is really the greater salvation. But yet, if they can only experience healing in the body, I'm still going to pray for them. You say, "Why would you do that?" because that's the way my master did. &gt;&gt; You see, he didn't just bring healing to the saved people and to the people who had the Holy Ghost in the New Testament cuz there was only two people before it fell on the day of Pentecost that had had it and that was Jesus and John. Nobody else had the Holy Ghost yet. He prayed for them and he even used his power to heal them. Even though they never asked him for salvation, many of them didn't. But we we believe by the grace of God then that God wants our faith to be released in healing in miracles. Yes. And we're believing God for great supernatural. We have saints among us that need a move of God in their body. We do. But yet I also look at it in this aspect that God sometimes has to give people some people miracles because he knows their faith is not consistent and have a long endurance quality that will be able to wait maybe for years of their healing and they would give up absolutely give up if God does not do something for them quickly. But yet we look at that as being a greater measure of faith and many times we're looking at it wrong. &gt;&gt; We think that people with miraculous faith that they can touch God just like that and oh my, it is so phenomenal and it is wonderful. But yet what I admire is the faith of those people who believe God and they ask God and daily they're fighting. daily they're watering the promise of God and at the end result sometimes God will even say no to their request yet they still believe him with all of their heart. &gt;&gt; Now the difference between those two type of people is this. One of them has faith with no patience. The other one has faith, but they also have the accompanied virtue of patience, which helps them to wait and faithfully endure. And they do not they do not give up on their faith even though they may not understand it, but they believe God with all their heart. So by that person God is displaying two great virtues at the same time both faith and patience. Now to the other we look at them which is mostly the ones that preachers like to give testimony about. You don't hear many preachers giving testimony about a person that had great patience and trusted God. But preachers want to use people that they laid their hands on and and and God did this and God did that and God did that for them. That's the one. You know what I'm talking about? Isn't that mostly the testimonies that we hear? How many testimonies do we hear though of people that are turned in that I was prayed for five years and I trusted God for five years and to this day God has never moved one speck of that thing out of my body. But I want to thank God today that I still believe him and I'm still trusting for his will to be done. Now, why don't we hear testimonies like that? Because somehow we don't think they are glorious. And I'll tell you what that is. It's still emerging of the carryover of Pentecost that's still in our message. Now, I know I've heard preachers around the message say, "Well, Pentecostals never give testimony." I find that to be amazing since the man who made that statement wasn't even in Pentecost and I was. I heard all the testimonies in Pentecost and I saw the magazines and I saw all the things they testified about and a lot of it was used to glorify preachers anyway. It wasn't really glorifying God. But I find it amazing then that people who can still keep right on believing, keep right on trusting and instead of getting better, sometimes they actually get worse. But it does not take away from their faith. Now in that type of an individual, God is actually bringing forth this other building block which is not apparent in just the person who has faith alone. Now let's look again at 2 Peter chapter 1 6. And to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience. Now look at the meaning of this word. I know I use meanings a lot. And it's because I guess I'm a dummy and I just like to understand what the word means instead of just saying it for 135 years of my life and not understanding what it means. To me, it just gives me more understanding. Look at what the word patience means. enduring, patient continuence, patient waiting, steadfastness in the New Testament, the characteristic of a man who is not swerved from his deliberate purpose and his loyalty to faith and piety by even the greatest trials and suffering, patient and steadfast. Now I want you to notice what this virtue of patience will do. It couples itself with the other virtues that God is building. It's evident, friends, that many of our our believers around the message have fallen short of this great virtue of God because they get so discouraged when they're going through trials. Now, for some, their patience may be tried in a physical realm. But I wonder as I was thinking about this morning before I came to church if maybe some of our young people in our church and some of the ones around the message that their patience may not be tried so much in a physical healing. But could their patience be tried in waiting for the right mate that they pray for this boy, Prince Charming, to come in their life? And this and their brothers will wait for this beautiful daughter of God to come in that'll just sweep them off of their feet and whatever they think that she's supposed to do. And they may have to pray and wait and pray. And during that time that they are waiting, Satan will send them one after another after another, maybe a denominational boy or girl that they meet at their work, their employment, and they'll say, "Oh, that's such a nice person, and they are a Christian, but how are they baptized to believe the word of God in its fullness?" Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; And will you wait patiently, my sister? Will you wait patiently, my brother, for God to put in your life that one that he's ordained for you to have? Or will you compromise and settle for something less than what the Lord wants you to have and then pay the rest of your life for marrying somebody that may never believe the same word that you believe? Now, if you don't believe me, you might ask around for some of the people in our church because I have to deal with it all the time of people who have not married a believer and they are still dealing with it to this day because of a choice they made years ago. And their companion don't come to church. Their companion haunts them and taunts them and argues and everything in the world. Why? because they did not wait patiently for the Lord to put the right one in their life. And listen, I I don't say this joyfully today. I say it was pain in my heart because I've had to deal with people for decades around the world that jumped ahead of the will of God and got the wrong one instead of waiting patiently. So my sisters, my brothers, it is well worth your weight to wait upon God and let God give to you the one that he wants you to have. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Well, you see that this patience that we're referring to today is not my patience modified or your patience just kind of worked on a little bit." But what we want to look at is that this is actually the patience of Jesus Christ himself. This is his own divine nature that is divided up in this sevenfold manifestation that he will choose to build a bride of out of seven church ages. And in this last stage, of course, we get all seven. But it also means that we also have the sevenfold manifestation of the demonic power that's being released all around us. And the church should be able to say &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it it's it's unlike anything that's ever been on the earth before. So keep in mind we're talking about the faith of Jesus, the virtue of Jesus, the knowledge of Jesus. So the patience of Jesus Christ. So it's beyond mine. It's beyond yours. There's no way for us to even be able to compare to what he has. Now in this it is a person that God will move them up this building block. They will have faith which is the beginning foundation. Fourthly is this great virtue which will again separate the bride from the church. So the church can pray and they can wait for a little season and then they become warned and through the trials and the tests and they just simply give up. But to a real member of the body of Christ, they are building a stature. And they know they're not where they were. And they know they're not where they used to where they want to be, but they know they're somewhere in this sevenstep pyramid longing for the time when God will complete in them what they're asking for. I hope that's where we are this morning. Now, I want you to notice this in the statue of a perfect man that the prophet said, "Then add to that forthly we add patience to your faith." Now, if you've got faith, it workketh patience. The Bible said, see, so this is patience. Now, that's the next thing that's going to build this statue. You know, God's got real material in his building. See how short we are, brethren? see why where we're at. Yes, sir. We have glory, you have shouts and things because we've got faith. &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, we're coming right back around again to where the church was in 1962. &gt;&gt; Now, see, in 1962, this is where they were. They had glory because they had shouts and healing and miracles and signs. And yet the prophet did not say God was satisfied with where they were. &gt;&gt; Well, if God wasn't satisfied in 62, how can he be satisfied in 2025? &gt;&gt; If we stop there, thank God for the glory. Thank God for the shouts. Thank God for the healing. But the stature of a perfect man is built out of more than faith. &gt;&gt; Brother Bon said he saw prostitutes come through the prayer line and get healed. &gt;&gt; Prostitutes. He would call one after another out by discernment and say, "You've got great faith to be a sinner." &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Brother Donnie, how could that be? Look at every one of them in the New Testament. In the days of the Lord Jesus, when he talked about them having great faith, there wasn't a one of them that was even born again. The new birth had not come yet. So, a person could have great faith and still not be born again. Now, watch. He says, you see, we have glory. We have shouts and things because we got faith. But when we come down to this here, God can't build us into that stature. Faith alone will never do it. Virtue will never do it. See, he can't make us up to that kind of a place. We've got all these other things and we fall and slide off with it. He can't build his church. Oh my. Patience with what? What kind of patience? The first thing is have patience with God. &gt;&gt; Patience with God. How many believes God? &gt;&gt; How many has patience with God? &gt;&gt; Ah, not near as many hands. Why am I not surprised? So, we believe that faith alone will do it. No, you see, we're a different category than the church. We are in the making of bride material, which is the finished body of Jesus Christ himself. Anyone who knows the scripture, the prophet said, knows the body of Jesus is not yet complete. So he's working on it now on the earth for people that will believe by faith like he did and they will have virtue like he had and knowledge like he had and patience like he had. You see, Jesus himself as high priest needed patience &gt;&gt; not only with Peter, James, and John, but with Donnie, Jackie, &gt;&gt; Keith, Freddy, Rob. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody got enough boldness to raise your hand and say, "And with me." &gt;&gt; And with me. He needs patience with all of us. So whenever we then by virtue of his nature start receiving these attributes, he's rebuilding himself in multiplied human forms on the earth. So it's more than casting out devils, healing the sick. You see, if these things are in you, they make you that you are perfect and will never fail. Faith alone won't do that. Matthew 24, Jesus tells us there will be those that will stand before him that day and say, "I cast out devils in your name." There will be people that sit there and said, "I raised the dead. I healed the sick. I've done this, that, and the other." How could they do it with faith? And come to find out there's running around with somebody else's wife or didn't preach the real full truth. Amen. Why? Because you can have part of it. I don't want just part. I want everything that God wants me to have. I want my image to reflect not only you. Now look friend, we don't want to be like Lot. Compare Lot to Sodom. He was a righteous man. Compare Lot to Abraham, it's like comparing a penny to a silver dollar. So if we are the Abraham group, we cannot take our penny attributes, our penny virtue, our penny temperance, our penny patience and compare it to Abraham and say we are the seed of Abraham. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; First thing is to have patience with God. If you've got real genuine faith, you'll have genuine patience because faith workketh patience. When God says anything, you believe it. That's all. You got patience. Say, "Well, I asked him last night to heal me, and I'm just as sick this morning." Oh my, what patience God told Abraham and 25 years later there wasn't even one sign. But you see, we attribute all of that to Abraham's faith. &gt;&gt; But that is wrong. &gt;&gt; It was not just Abraham's faith. &gt;&gt; It was Abraham's patience. His faith believed, but his patience kept him persistent in his believing. Can't you see what God wants us to be? So he adds and adds and adds and adds. And when those virtues are being burst inside of us, we will have absolutely everything in the completion. Remember, God is completed in number seven. So when God builds in us every one of these virtues himself, we will have absolutely everything we need for the changing of our bodies. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Notice James as I mentioned about Job. James 5:1. Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. So, Job had faith, and his faith put him to that spot where he could believe God. But it wasn't just Job's face that kept him through all the hardships and the trials that he went through. It was his face coupled with his patience. &gt;&gt; He did not understand. He could not comprehend. It made no sense. But yet his faith believed God. But his faith could only take him so far. Unless it was coupled with patience. Then go. Oh, you imagine Job with that great thing. What a what an outstanding thing. It must have been to James that James would write it this way that ye have heard of the patience of Job. Yeah. What's amazing is whenever you look at it, James was the first one to relate to it quite this way. So it was the patience of Job reflected through the 42 chapters, whatever it was, but not by name. It was more so by action than it was by name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice, oh my. The prophet said, "Look at Job." And he was fighting so hard. His wife, even his wife, his companion, even her breast has become strange. Amen. You talking about hard. I cannot imagine going through just what little bit that I went through as a Christian, as a minister, without my wife standing there with me, to help me, to pray for me, to encourage me, on and on and on. And can you brothers that have a godly wife like that, can you imagine having one like Job had? And whenever you're going through your greatest trial that she comes to you and says, "Curse God and die." &gt;&gt; You're believing in vain, Job. Well, look, you've lived for God. You've served God. And look what God has done for her. The very woman that bore your children. Now no doubt she had developed some resentment because remember their children all of that was taken away. Job was a man of great notoriety in his day, of great fame, fortune, wealth. And no doubt this had affected not only Job, but it had affected her. And Job had entered into the state of what doctors, many of them today, diagnose as elephantitis, where that Job has swollen up. And they say that because a person's legs and their torso, their body and hands and arms and so on, they swell and swell and swell until they burst and will start running open and oozing out the pus and their skin becomes real wrinkled and looks similar to an elephant's skin and they they develop this terrible stench coming out of their body. You imagine every time she went to take him a little something to eat or to try to even check on him to see how he was, she'd have to hold her nose and say, "Job, I can't believe you. You've sinned. There's something wrong. His friends come." And whenever the Bible says they came, that they sat there and looked at him for several days and never uttered one word. They saw him a far off sitting out on the yard or maybe the porch and they didn't even recognize who the man was. And then when they did come up and start talking to him, they had not one word of encouragement. Not one thing, oh dear brother, we're so sorry that you're going through this. Not one person was sent there to encourage. We jump to the end of the book of Job. And when God turned the trial around and gave Job back children and gave him back his inheritance, then the Bible tells us that his family came back around. &gt;&gt; And each one of them brought him a piece of money. &gt;&gt; Yes, they did. &gt;&gt; I've had a few family members like that. Anybody else? Why didn't they bring it, brother Dave? When he needed it. &gt;&gt; But instead of them bringing the money when he needed it and had nothing, God allowed even his family to turn against him. &gt;&gt; And his wife turned against him. Not one human being on the earth. He said, "I I beckon my servants and they would not come. I asked for my companions. They would not come and God wouldn't come. Job cried and he prayed. He believed God. But it wasn't just his faith that got him through. &gt;&gt; It was his patience. &gt;&gt; So Job was trusting God even though he did not understand. I wonder if anybody's ever been there. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, sure you have. his wife come and said, "Oh, Job, you look miserable. Why don't you just curse God? Die the death." He said, "Woman, thou speakest like a foolish woman." Uhhuh. Oh my. What a hero. What a hero. I wonder sometimes. Heroes of faith. Will they all be miracle workers? Will they all be those that have great attributes and great testimonies? I prayed for this person and they got well. I prayed for this one. If you'll read Hebrews 11, you'll find out most of them heroes of faith, they struggled. They tried. They went through hard times in their life. They are not made attributes of the heroes of faith by the multitude of the prayers that God answered, but rather the ones that he didn't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But they believed him anyhow. &gt;&gt; I hope somebody's listening to me this morning. &gt;&gt; Notice, oh my, even Jesus referred to him. Have you not heard of the patience of Job? Job went down in the harness. Abraham went down in the harness. Yes, sir. Isaac went down in the harness. Joseph went down in the harness. But we don't want the harness, do we? We all want to be Kentucky thoroughbredads &gt;&gt; where we come up on the pness of course and we come up on derby day and we want the roses laid around us and we want accolades and craz praise of men. We don't want no harness. &gt;&gt; We want roses. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to &gt;&gt; speak Lord. I'll hear you. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now, this man being a prophet, he had access to God's grace. But Job didn't have a Bible to read. The Bible wasn't wrote then, but he had access to God by revelation. Now, remember, he could not go into St. John 15:7 and place his finger on the scripture. If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask what you will. He could not go to Psalm 37. Delight thyself also in the Lord, and he will give thee the desires of thine heart. 1 Peter 2:24, by his stripes we are healed. Isaiah 7, that he bore the chastisement of our peace. He had no Bible to be able to go to. His only communication to God was divine revelation. And God had shut it down. had no tapes to listen to. No pastor that would be listening to a tape. And when he heard this quote, this one, this one, this one, he would copy paste, copy paste, copy paste, and send it to fellow ministers or sheep in his church that were going through trials. He had no email where anybody could say, "Brother Joe, I've been hearing about what you're going through. God bless you, brother. He had no WhatsApp like I did this morning. From a brother in India where him and his entire church was praying for us because they love us because we've affected their lives. I wonder what Job would have give for that one WhatsApp. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even God shut down the flow of revelation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You have heard of the patience of Job. &gt;&gt; You have heard of the patience of Job. Now he says that was before the Bible was written. Now we find out, take some of his life when God blessed him, made him a great man. Why even everybody respected him even to his wisdom become so great his inspiration. Oh my. You talking about glory. My people would come up and he was up in some years of course. And he said whenever he'd go into the marketplace the people would just come in and said listen listen at him. Wow what words. And God would allow him to speak things and other great wise men would sat there said profound. Who ever heard of such things. It was so incredible. And they just listen and write it down and taking notes what Job was saying. They said, "Oh my, what a man. Boy, when I grow up, I hope I get to be a man like that." And then all of a sudden, one day, Job's kids died. A tragedy hit his home. Tragedy hit his family, lost his loved ones, lost his wealth, lost everything he had, and also lost respect, honor, and trust. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, what would you do if God had a job in this message that he wanted to try even in onetenth of the measure that he tried Job? &gt;&gt; Would you say he's a secret sinner? There's something going on in his life. Uh oh, we see it now. We've known it all along. Them backwards discerners, you know. Oh, I've always known there was something funny about him. You'll go to hell for lying. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Nobody, not even God. God did not come down by an angelic visitation and surround him when he was praying and taking a croc. Anybody know what it was? A piece of of broken pottery. And Job would take that piece of a croc and set down on the outside cuz he'd stink up the house so bad. and he'd take that piece of croc and scrape his boils and the pus and the dead skin because with elephant Titus the skin dies. Oh, it must have been sickening to smell him to be around him. And yet God from heaven's point of view said he's the greatest man on the earth. &gt;&gt; Not one thing has changed. As a matter of fact, I'm giving him more favor now than he's ever had. Well, let me just be quite frank and honest with you. I don't like that kind of favor. &gt;&gt; Only difference between me and you is I'm being honest and you're sitting there being pious and and not saying amen cuz you're lying between your teeth. &gt;&gt; They know one of you wants to be able to do this same thing that Job did. And boy, then likely we'll never have to. But all of us are going to be tried. Our patience will be tried. And sometimes God tries it so he can show us where we are. Look, son, you need to be here, but you're only here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; And then Satan began to accuse that man. That's the way he does every inspired servant of God. Satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right. Now we find out his life and his trials and his great faith. Even Jesus referred to the patience of Job. Faith waits. What a statement. Faith waits with patience. &gt;&gt; Now this is not the miraculous outburst of faith that produces miracles. This is the slow grinding daytoday faith that can become monotonous to children of God. Oh my special meetings that have prayer line coming through. Boy, faith climbing high and riding through the raptures. Boy, people say, "Oh, glory to God. I wish I could live in a special meeting like that." They wouldn't be special to you very long. After a few weeks, they become as monotonous as the regular church services are. That's why we call them special cuz they are special. But it's not that type of faith that will give you that victory of overcoming every day of your life. It's not that faith of going to a young uh a youth camp young people and say, "Boy, if I could only live there." God don't want you to live there. God wants you to live down here where every day you've got to put one foot in front of the other and you don't feel the great anointing and yet you say, "Although he slay me, I'll trust him." &gt;&gt; My, this ought to be something that you write down and keep near you. Faith waits for patience for the promised word to be fulfilled. Again, he says, "And I've heard, but now I see." Now, we notice here that Job, I just went through his trials. All of his afflictions had a lovely family. They were taken from him. Now, some of you have lost maybe one family member that was very close. Can you imagine all your sons and daughters being taken at one time? One morning you're this wealthy individual, the richest man in all the land of us, and the next morning you're flat broke. Not only that, but your body becomes afflicted. you're a man of great honor and prestige and then people hold their nose around you. Well, they may not hold their nose around us in the natural sense, but because we follow this message, they hold their nose spiritually. Oh, a cult. You all stink. &gt;&gt; You all are low down and rotten. Y'all are following a man. Everybody is following a man. It just depends on which one you're following. &gt;&gt; Come on. Everybody's following somebody. So, we today are bearing the stench. The stench and the smell of what the world wants to say. A cult. Crazy. They're a bunch of nuts. &gt;&gt; Well, we'll find out shortly. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I said, "We going to find out shortly." &gt;&gt; Brother Tim Plu sent me a video this morning. It was his daughter and her husband trying out a Tesla car. They typed in on the computer the address. His daughter is sitting on the driver's side. No hands on the wheel. The car comes up to a stop sign or a light and then it eased itself up a little bit more cuz it couldn't see the ride away and then it took off by itself. And you can hear her in the video saying, "Oh, it's getting close. That makes me nervous." Who would have ever thought we did? &gt;&gt; Why? Because God showed a vindicated prophet decades and decades ago, a family going down the road sitting in a car that was driving itself. &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. You are living in an hour when God's word has come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This day, this vision is being fulfilled right before your eyes. I've mentioned to you before, Brother Rob Weber had one of them cars and somebody stood out there with him. He got his little whatever it was out remote or gadget or whatever and beckoned that car to drive out of the parking lot and come and pick him up. this day, this vision is fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, when I see that pope rise up out of the United States, no matter how impossible, the historians of the Catholic Church said it will never happen this day. This word has come to pass. Oh, glory to God. So also will this word come to pass. You will be standing and all of a sudden a sweep will come over you and you will see your loved ones and you know it won't be long. You're going to be changed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How are we waiting for it? Faith coupled with patience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Notice again it says we notice here that Job after he went through the trials, all of his afflictions, lovely family taken from him, had good health taken from him. Everything that he'd owned in his life was taken. And he sat on a hash heap with a piece of croc scraping his boils. Even to his own wife spoke against him and said, "Why not curse God and die?" He said, "Thou speakest like a foolish virgin." &gt;&gt; He said, "The Lord gave and the Lord taken away." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; For those of you that are still dealing with loss, praise will help you reach the finale. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the world may know, let them hear my voice. The Lord gave my wife and I our youngest daughter. The Lord gave her and the Lord took her away. And what is our response, Carol? Blessed be the name of the Lord. You want to know how I've made it through this trial? I praise my way through this trial. I've not had self-pity. I've not felt sorry for myself. Lord, how come this how come that that won't get you anywhere? But there is great power in being able to praise your way when you can't pay your bills. Praise your way through sickness. Praise your way through trial. Praise your way through mind battles. And say, "The Lord is here. You see, Job was unaware of this statement right here. Satan had come up before God cuz he could come up before him and accuse the Christians or the believers. So he accused Job of many things and said that Job the reason he served God was cuz everything was coming good for him. But he said if you'll just let me have him in my hands, I'll make him curse you to your face. I want you to notice the confidence that God had in a believer. Ain't it something that we have confidence in God? But God wants to have confidence in us. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of Christian I want to be, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many wants to be that kind of a child of God that God can say, "I've got confidence in my daughter. I've got confidence in my son, Satan. I will take this from him and that from him, and I tell you before it happens, they will not turn away. They will love me. They will serve me. How can God say that? Because you are a spoken word from God. And God is simply referring back to his spoken word about your being. And he knows the poor old dumb devil ain't got enough sense to know. He's dealing with the preeminent one. He's dealing with the one that has omniscence and omnipresent. And he can look back to you, hallelujah, before the foundation of the world and say, "I don't care what you do. He is my son. She is my daughter. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can take away from them that'll make them turn away. I give them my word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the confidence that God has in a believer. In other words, God said to Satan like this, "You can't do it. You can't do it. He's a justified man. He's a good man. Now, that's something to me. Oh, I hear all kinds of people say, "Oh, this is a good person. That's a good person. That's a good person. That's a good person." It's easy for you to say. You might not even know him. But when God says he's a good man, that's a good man. &gt;&gt; I said, "That's a good man." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In other words, God said to Satan, you can't do it. He's a just man, justified. He's a good man. There's none like him in the whole earth. Oh, what a man that God himself would say to his enemy. Now, if Job fails, the whole reputation of God is ruined for the rest of time. Have you ever recommended somebody for a job or for this or that or the other and you wished you hadn't have? Some of you have, but you're just quiet. You're afraid to even bat an eye, ain't you? I can't help it if it was if it was your uncle Jim or Aunt Vinnie or whoever it was. It's truth. And you get to where a spot, you know, people to me, brother Donnie, you know this preacher, you heard this guy, you heard this guy. What about this guy? We're saying about moving, relocating over to this church. What do you know about him, Brother Don? What about I say, um um uh the last time I heard he was okay. That was two days ago. You get to where you don't know where to recommend anybody or not. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God didn't say to the devil, &gt;&gt; "That's right. Can I get back with you on that? It bursted out of his being. Oh, hallelujah. I help. Why you've been fellowshipping with him? &gt;&gt; Praise God. God, give us more Jobes. &gt;&gt; We're going to have a job prayer line after this this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Even Carol want him getting that one. See, she's shaking her head. No. Oh my, my servant is so perfect. There's not another man on the earth like him. Oh, if we could only be that kind of a man &gt;&gt; that God could bestow that confidence upon us that know that we'll not twist from his word or his being anyway. say exactly and he can put his trust in us. &gt;&gt; Wow. Help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus. when a man or a person has once really come in contact with God and that genuine faith that God is been revealed that God is there's nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his God. That's right. &gt;&gt; I believe it was Paul that said, "There's no strife, no hunger, no perils, neither living creatures or death or anything that can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. You are securely anchored in him because you were ordained to that life." Job with his perfect revelation of God and who God was and how God loved him. He waited &gt;&gt; no matter what the circumstances was. He waited for his faith to be confirmed. &gt;&gt; Faith the long one do it. How did he wait, brother Jim? Patience. His patience coupled with his faith. And his faith, I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. and his patience said, "Keep believing. Keep believing." That's talking back and forth. That's communicating back and forth to each other. Faithful said, "God's real. God's true." And and his confidence and his patience in God. That's right. God's true. How long are you going to wait? I'm going to wait until it comes to pass. And if I'll tell you one thing, if he don't heal me, if I die, though the skin worms eat my body, yet in my flesh, I will see God. [Applause] Yes, sir. Let's look at the New Testament. Luke 8:14. That which fell among the thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection. Remember this is a parable of the seed. So a sower went forth to sew. Those that receive, oh my, glory to God, I believe it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. But they have no root, no depth within themsel. &gt;&gt; The seed word has no depth to anchor. There ain't enough dirt in there. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. But that on the ah so here now God in the Old Testament said Job is a good man. God in the New Testament is saying that's good ground. I'll take his word for it. &gt;&gt; Now this helps me identify who is and who ain't good ground. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if you ain't good ground, guess what you are? You're just ground. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. That's what the majority of humanity is right now. They're just ground. They're just dirt, dust. &gt;&gt; But that on the good ground are they? Which with an honest and &gt;&gt; good &gt;&gt; good heart. How was that even possible for a human being to have a good heart? &gt;&gt; Our heart is wicked. Our heart when we're born lost is wretched and evil. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How come we have a good heart? &gt;&gt; We have to have a transplant. &gt;&gt; Our heart must be changed. &gt;&gt; Notice those with a good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with &gt;&gt; you. Even fruitbearing is tied with the virtue &gt;&gt; of patience. &gt;&gt; Not just faith, not just temperance or godliness, fruitbearing is tied with patience. So with great constancy suffering much through the trials and the difficulties of life, they keep pressing and pressing and pressing through the heat, through the dry spells, through the cool nights, whatever it is, they keep pushing and pushing with patience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the more they suffer, the more fruitful they are. That's the kind of child of God I want to be. I do not want it said about me, my trials wiped me out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to this. Luke 21:19. We'll close here just in a few minutes. In your patience possess ye. So, you reckon patience is important? &gt;&gt; Well, I wonder what happens if we don't have patience. &gt;&gt; Then who's possessing our soul &gt;&gt; in your patience? And remember, this patience isn't just with God. Matter of fact, the prophet goes into it. We'll get into it maybe next time. But you don't just have patience with God, but you have patience with one another. Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to tell you which Sunday I'm going to preach that in. So, all of you won't go to Dollywood that Sunday. &gt;&gt; How many needs help with patience with people? &gt;&gt; Well, God bless y'all for your honesty. Amen. In your patience possess ye your soul. But by patient bearing all afflictions, reproaches, the things that we go through because not for our faults, but because of being persecuted for the word's sake. We let nothing disturb us or distress us or deteriorate our patience in God's promise. &gt;&gt; Now you understand what trials can do. They can deteriorate your patience and then make you where you're less patient than you were before the trial ever came. &gt;&gt; Now, this is really hard on us in this microwave age. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; We got instant taters, instant coffee, instant this, instant that. We go through the drive-thru. Well, let's not go through that way this morning cuz I don't want to get in the wrong spirit. We go through the drive-thru and get instant food. It may not be exactly what you wanted. And I you've heard me say it before. Sometimes I just pull up and say, "Give me what you want to, cuz you're going to anyhow. &gt;&gt; I didn't order coffee and they give me coffee. I ain't never drunk coffee. I didn't order this and they give me that." So, you just go through it. So, you know, began this time of instant this and instant that. And God says, "Slow down, children. Any y'all ever feel like a child of God and your walk with God is like this? &gt;&gt; And you think everybody around you is running 90 miles an hour. They're only acting like that. If we're all children of God, it's a slow walk. &gt;&gt; Yes, it is. Oh my &gt;&gt; our patience, our virtue, our trust. &gt;&gt; But in our patience, not our faith, we possess our souls. &gt;&gt; You can have a heart full of faith and be lost. You will not possess your soul by miraculous faith. You'll possess your soul by patience. &gt;&gt; God may say yes. God may say wait a while. &gt;&gt; What's even more painful is God may say no. &gt;&gt; But you do as Job. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can I have just a couple more minutes? &gt;&gt; Romans 5:3. Not only so, but we glory in tribulations. Now, from this verse on, we can, every one of us after each phrase say, "God help me." &gt;&gt; We glory in tribulation. God help me. Knowing that tribulation workketh patience. God help me. &gt;&gt; Endurance. This is what it means. Endurance under trials without sustaining loss or deterioration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Endurance under trials without sustaining loss or deterioration. You see, it's not just coming out on the other side of that trial, but it's during the trial you had no loss &gt;&gt; or no deterioration of your attitude. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, I've deteriorated some in some of the stuff I've been through. &gt;&gt; Have you lost some of the stuff when you've went through it, but don't worry, he ain't going to give up on you. Oh, no. He's going to keep molding us. He's going to keep until he's able to birth this virtue in us. And then we will go through things and come out on the other side with no loss. &gt;&gt; With no loss. So, look at Job. He come out on the other side. Where was the loss? &gt;&gt; Children back, wealth back, friends back, family back. It wasn't a loss. He actually had more than what he had for the trial ever come. So he come through on the other side of that. It didn't say that he didn't lose through it. But the end result, look at preJ before the trial and look at post job after the trial and see what God you imagine. Every time the devil come up before the throne of God, Papa say, "Uh, I've been meaning to ask it." What do you think about Job now? I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about Oh, yes, we are going to talk about it. Cuz this is my throne room and this is my throne. And I want to tell you to your face, you're a baldfaced liar. &gt;&gt; Cuz you said Joe would turn against me. And I told you that he would. Well, I've got to go. No, you ain't. Stay right here. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let's close here. Verse four. Let's go back and read verse three. So it all ties together. Not only so, but we glory in tribulation. Also, knowing that tribulation workketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope. But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it? Romans chapter 8 25. Romans 15:4. Whatsoever things were a four time written were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. And the church said, &gt;&gt; let's stand. Praise be to God. Colossians 1:10, that we might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work. Amen. And increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened was almight according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with. Listen how God accompanies things in his children's menu. This is not normal. This is not human, Harry. It don't make any sense that God would accompany some of this stuff. Long suffering with joyfulness. &gt;&gt; This is bride food. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I said this is bride food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Longsuffering. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 1:33. Remembering without ceasing your work of faith and your labor of love and patience of hope and our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our father. Hebrews 6:11. And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end. Verse 12. that you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and &gt;&gt; inherit &gt;&gt; the promises. &gt;&gt; These qualities are absolutely essential to produce the divine steadfastness and the promise of God. So faith hears it said, "Yep, that's right. I believe God's word is true." Amen. Then faith from a heart that's full of faith but will have no patience in time. It become oh I I I I don't know when it's going to happen. I I I don't know. I heard brother Greg's testimony there this morning. Isn't that awesome? &gt;&gt; But you know what? Faith alone didn't do that. &gt;&gt; But patience &gt;&gt; patience can look at a scan and the doctor say it's here there and there. Faith will say, "I call that a lie." And patience couple will that faith will say, "However long it takes. However long it takes, it don't really matter. My God is a mighty God and the devil can't take me till God's done with me." &gt;&gt; Can't you see why we need such patience? It's the same thing dealing with one another. We can look at one say, "Oh yeah, I believe brother so and so is a good man." But I'll tell you one thing, I get so fed up with him. I get absolutely what? But he's a good man. I'll tell you one thing, brother Harry's a good brother. Bless his heart. And I love to hear him saying, "But boy, here's human makeup. I'm telling you one thing. Couple your faith and your confidence in him with patience." Lord, bring Brother Harry along. Lord, bring him along. Bless his heart. I mean, you know, bring Brother Larry along. Lord, Brother Skip, bring him along. Oh, you can tell the man loves the Lord. He got up there and prayed a while ago. You could tell he loves God, but Lord, he's just got so many flaws like you. patience. &gt;&gt; Well, if the Lord lets me live, I'll be preaching on this again &gt;&gt; sometime. Could be next Sunday. Could be. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Many of the heroes that we've called them giants of faith, &gt;&gt; but we've left out a very important quality. They weren't just giants of faith. They were giants of patience. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says it himself about his ministry about patience with people. And he said, "Having patience with the people." He said, "I've been preaching here for 30 something years and still having to have patience with women that cut their hair, women that do this and men that do that." &gt;&gt; So, a pastor's got to be a patient man. &gt;&gt; It's good if he's got faith to raise the dead because without patience, he'll definitely need it cuz he'll wind up killing a few. And if he don't do it physically, he'll do it with his tongue behind your back. &gt;&gt; Sweet Jesus, I'm giving away trade secrets. &gt;&gt; I don't care who you are. We all need more patience. &gt;&gt; The man who brought you this today &gt;&gt; needs more patience. &gt;&gt; But I don't like how I get it. So tribulation workketh patience, patience, experience, experience hope, hope maketh not ashamed. For the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. &gt;&gt; But in reality, when I get along with Jesus, even though I don't pray for tribulation, I do wind up telling him whatever it takes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You do that, brother Fred. &gt;&gt; Whatever it takes, Lord. That ultimately is my desire. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together if you would. Hallelujah. Lord, we've been waiting and waiting. Dear God, I've heard it since I was a little boy. And many of these people here were raised in church and they heard it since they were children. Jesus is coming. He's coming back. How many people were alive and the prophet told those visions? They saw that family going down the road in that car. They probably thought, "Now, he he he's missed it big time on that." I even had a message preacher tell me a few years ago, Brother Donnie, it may not actually be that way. I said, "But brother, that's what the prophet saw." "Well, we may not live that long. It may not." I said, "He said it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; It will come to pass if it's God's word." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yet, Lord, if we could be just as confident in your prophecies about us, many of these people here today would die for this message if it ever come right down to it, cuz they believe it's the truth. But Lord God, I don't want to just die for this message. I want to give my life and die daily for the promises with my name on them. Whenever we saw that pope out of the United States according to prophecy was placed in there, I didn't say, "Glory to God, I believe the message." Now, whenever we've seen these autonomous automobiles and all, we didn't say, "Well, praise God. I believe the message." We already believe the message. I don't believe one bit more today after seeing some of the events that have been brought to pass than what I believe before they ever come to pass because I'm a believer &gt;&gt; and that's what we do. We wait patiently. Lord, if we could wait for a car and we could wait for a pope and we could wait for words like that to come to pass. What about these words in our lives, these virtues? Aren't they just as important? There's one word, Lord, well said this way. There's several words I have no desire to see come to pass. I have no desire to see that seventh vision of our nation being annihilated. No desire. I have no desire to see the west coast, one tenth of the earth, fixing to fall in a chunk of it, 3 to 400 miles wide, 1,500 miles long and fall 40 miles down and go plum down to the salt sea and the tidal waves. the ocean will weep its way into the desert in Tampa when he stands there in 1964 and he says one day this place will fall into the ocean. Hallelujah. Oh, I love the sermon the choosing of the bride. But it's not so much those prophecies about Los Angeles that I hear, but it's the bride call that I hear out of that sermon. &gt;&gt; Yes. If we have confidence, Los Angeles will fall in the sea. And we see it more and more all the time. Seismologists, people who study it, these different faults they found in the last 30 to 40 years that they didn't even recognize was there. And I shared an article just some weeks ago with some of the different ministers in the message where scientists themselves are now saying a great chunk of the earth will fall off in the west coast. If time would go on long enough, they would start quoting the message, too. They're quoting it in their predictions. They call it predictions. We call it prophecies. But I also hear another word from the Lord saying, "There's been brides, brides, churches, churches, brides, brides, churches, churches. But there must come one who has both mechanics and dynamics. Hallelujah, Jesus. Oh, we worship you today, Father. We with patience wait for that word, our word. How lonely he must have felt. How apart and separated he must have felt. And how many days and nights the tears trickled out of his eyes and the bitterness of his difficulty as Joseph down in the land of Egypt. And the psalmist David caught that word and said, "Until his word came, the word of the Lord tried him." So the word of the Lord was trying him until his word came. Hallelujah. Cuz there was a specific word. He had that dream. Oh, glory to God. So is it today, Lord, the word of the Lord is trying your people until our word comes. We love you, Jesus. We pray today, Father, for Sister Rousan Carter and for the family of our brother Mack, for his church family. Lord, little did we know this week you had called another one home. By now he's already met friends and loved ones and moved beyond the curtain of time. By now, no doubt he's already met this man that people are making one YouTube video after another and calling him a liar and a deceiver and a false prophet. But brother Matt did not meet a false prophet, but he met an angel sent from God with a message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't see how it could be much longer, Jesus. And after all, maybe you're waiting on us to be developed and built into the image. Oh, granite Father, we worship you today, Lord. and we'd like to be remembered today before the Lord. Would you just raise your hands in the presence of God? How many needs more faith, more virtue, more knowledge, more patience, more temperance, more godliness, all these great things of the Lord Jesus? Grant it to us, Lord. Maybe there's some here today, Father, and they've had great trials in their life, and maybe they've never yet come to the spot with enough victory over it that they could say, "Thank you, Lord." It's very hard and I know it seems odd and peculiar and people may think it's very very strange but there is such victory and been able to accept the fact that you are a perfect God and you make no mistakes. We worship you Jesus. I know we say it all the time. Lord we'll understand it better by and by. I I know that was written with an earth earthly view, but sometimes I wonder if we'll need any explanation then cuz we'll be in a word form body and in that word form body we know all things anyhow. So on this side we're trying to figure it out and scratch our heads and try to understand it because we're looking at it through the veil of darkness. Lord Jesus, may we be faithful. May my patience endure. If I have to go by the way of the grave and they roll me up here in a box and the preachers preach over me, that'll not hinder me, Lord. But if I'm alive and remain, then Lord Jesus, as an old man, oh yeah, now I'm an old man, 69, having a birthday this last week, that meant I got one birthday closer to being 18 again. So, the way I'm looking at it, I'm looking at it back from the beginning. Not just that I'm getting older, but hopefully I'm getting wiser, getting closer. That's what we want today, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord. Oh, can we raise our hands, saints, in the presence of the Lord? Maybe you're standing here today and you face a terrible thing in your life, and you've never yet been able to acknowledge his omnipotence in that situation. Lord, I prayed for this and that and the outcome was totally different. But today, I want to thank you that you are perfect. Your ways are perfect. I want to thank you for seeing me through that great heartbreak, Lord, that great trying time of my life. I still don't understand it any better, Lord, but I have come to this understand it. You are God and God alone. And we could search the mountains. We could search the valleys. We could search the churches. We could search all over. And we wouldn't find nobody. Nobody that would even rank close to who you are. When we're down in the valley and it's so dark and so deep and we wonder if we'll ever come out. When we go to the highest loftiest mountain of our experience, no matter where we search, we'll never find anybody that can outdo you, that can out love you, that can out save you, that can outheal you, that can outd deliver you. Oh, glory to God. We worship you here today, Jesus. We magnify your name, Lord God. Can we just worship him a little bit? Sing something for us here. Praise the Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord Jesus. We worship you, oh God. I'm going to keep pressing on. Oh, pressing on. [Music] I'm going to keep pressing on Lord to this higher calling. Hallelujah. Of my Lord. All is singing now.

Father, let this thing pass from him. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, I'm not sure when you were here as a human if you ever dealt with one of these or not, but you suffered stripes for everything we'd ever face. &gt;&gt; Dear God, we agree together with our brother. &gt;&gt; Having suffered with these things, Lord, myself and others here in the church that have, we know the discomfort, the pain, and all that can be involved with it. In the name of Jesus, may this pass from our brother's body. May it leave him. Lord God, in Jesus name, we believe your word is true. Father, I've stood in the pulpit in the pain and the duress of kidney stones and after church passing before. May it be so with our brother today. I pray. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Word of the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the Lord. Let's sing this before we leave this morning.
