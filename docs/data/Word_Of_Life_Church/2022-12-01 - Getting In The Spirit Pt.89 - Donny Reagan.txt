counted such an honor and a privilege that we could be gathered together in this place once again Lord in your presence for us to be gathered together with each other it's it's an honor and we so enjoy that but if it wasn't any more than that it wouldn't change us forever but when we're gathered in your presence if we will come of the right attitude every time we come we'll get something that'll make us a better person make us Lord Jesus where we can be more like you understand your ways your word your call on our lives fathers we've gathered here tonight we pray that you would just help us anoint us I pray with your spirit open our understanding Lord God to more of you that we that we might stumble in our Humanity help us to look Beyond tradition help us to look beyond what we think about this or that may we look into your word that it may change us more into that image of what you want us to be help us to not father we pray that you've been mindful Lord there's many that are battling different things flu and some with the covet again and various things that are going around but we're just asking you Lord that should be mindful of all of those touch the sick Lord those that have had surgery those that are facing various things in their lives be mindful of them tonight we pray father amen well how are y'all wonderful well praise the Lord and he was less than wonderful some of you well your last and wonderful all right well it's an honor for us to be gathered together you know even whenever we're going through things and facing so much difficulty in things in life where would we be if it wasn't for the Lord and our hearts and lives I said it to you many times I'll probably keep on saying it as long as you'll let me preach to you I don't see how people live without him I don't see how that I know they do I know they do and they think that they've got this great fine wonderful life but I'm so glad I can't even walk without him holding my hand I wouldn't want to live one day without him God bless you let's turn to the Book of Revelation tonight chapter 18 verse 17. and I was supposed to be in Kansas this week supposed to last Monday uh to go hunting but with all the work there is to be done over the church I thought it'd be more beneficial for me to stick around here and do what little bit I can do but brother Andrew Glover was scheduled to be here on Sunday so I thought we'd just let him come on back and be with us anyway so you'll get to hear a good picture on Sunday and a young one too at that God bless you let's read together Revelation 18 17. for in one hour so great riches has come to naught and every shipmaster and all the company and ships and sailors and as many as traded by sea stood afar off and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great City and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas I sent this now what they say alas alas that great City we're in we were made rich and all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness now listen how much of this is tied to her I'm convinced we don't know how much she does for in one hour is she made desolate Rejoice over her wow so some people are crying some are lamenting some are wailing some are just saying alas alas what are we going to do oh what are we going to do but look in verse 20 Rejoice over her thou heaven and you Holy Apostles so we got people on the Earth that's act in one way and we've got people in heaven that's acting another way I guess the question is tonight which are we going to be now once again it proves to us that the people of the earth that are carnal-minded so miss how God thinks about certain things how could one thing that would make people wail and a man can cry and then other people are rejoicing and again it proves to us that when God wants it to be so that he enlightens people in heaven to things that are happening on the Earth I'm sure he doesn't to all sorts of things that we go through but I want you to notice this Rejoice over her thou heaven and you Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on her so they are to Rejoice because God is getting back at him and God is getting evil with this city This Woman This power that Ruled the Earth may the Lord bless his words you may be seated now for the most part it's hard for us humans whenever we think about revenge or avenge being a vengeful spirit and we know that the word forbids us from being revengeful the word forbids us for wanting to have an attitude to where so and so do something to us we're going to get back at him and if it's the last thing I do I'll take it one thing I'll get back at him well you know the Lord does not want us to have that attitude but yet God can have that attitude and when he does it is so pure and so holy that God considers it to be righteous now for us when we look at it why because the difference is in his being God and us being merely humans that are still contaminated with the things about us that want to get even with people in the wrong attitude but yet notice what a strange thing that this is so this is of course during the time of the tribulation period very very close to the end of it and the heavens are so in tune with what's going on the earth that God actually lets a voice come out of heaven and Heaven is told to Rejoice because explosions Annihilation destruction this city has been destroyed in one hour by an atomic bomb people have lost their wealth they have lost nearly everything that they would own and Heaven is supposed to Rejoice over such a thing how can that be isn't that the wrong Spirit no actually it's not the wrong Spirit but now for most of us if someone would do something bad against us and we would hear that they had a car wreck or say I knew it I knew it they shouldn't have never thought that about me they shouldn't have never said that about me but isn't it amazing though if we have a car wreck the next day that Old Devil I'll tell you what he nearly killed me it died old Devil's after me well how do you know which one was the devil that caused them to have the one and the other God calls them so you see there's still something about our Humanity that is not yet attained to that purity of being able to Revenge the way God can now I'm sure there's nobody here like that tonight but there's some pretty low down people that stream these services so I'm sure that somebody needed to hear this tonight so you goodly Little Darlings you just sat here and and pray for me what I have to deliver this to them sorry outfits that stream in this service and maybe I'll be able to get to the Angelic choir and something that you Little Darlings can Rejoice with ah you know it's amazing because heaven I can't say that I understand how and when the transition is made but as we come to the close of the end time here before going into the Millennium the heavens are commanded by God to start rejoicing and it it synced up with things that are happening on the earth now I believe that heaven is is absolutely in tune to things that are going on on the earth as a matter of fact the prophet tells us that whenever we get ready to leave this world that God will send one of our loved ones down to the river and they will be waiting for us now how do they know that they're in the sixth Dimension God's in the seventh Dimension but they're still communication that goes between the six and the seventh Dimension and the person living here on the earth contacting the Earthly home and yet the father knows they're fixing to cross over so what does he do he sends a message to someone a loved one in the sixth Dimension and they come down from the sixth Dimension wherever they are to where they themselves crossed over at the River Jordan and there they are waiting for that son that daughter that brother that sister whoever it was by a command from God and they are there to welcome them on the other side now I Know that heaven communicates and those use the things that are on the earth the angel of Revelation 18 1 whenever he sound his message of come out of her my people then the voice from heaven in verse 4 echoed and begin to say the same thing from heaven so we know that God is absolutely synchronized with what is happening on the Earth but I'm sure Heaven would not be Heaven if they were aware of all the anxiety and all the trouble how in the world could they enjoy being there in this type of body of theophany if they knew we were still here and we were sick and we were suffering and we were going through all kinds of different things so no doubt the Lord only allows certain things to be conveyed to them and you know brother Brandon would mention it many times I heard it not long ago and there was a man that come up in a prayer line and he had a he had a need in his body but yet the man was not saved and the prophet told him he said your mother has gone on before you and she prayed many prayers for you and tonight they're being answered now God brother M didn't even know the woman but God knew the prayers of this woman and her son had come up for a need and God was answering the Prayer of Salvation now we know that according to the Book of Revelation that the prayers of the Saints are stored up I'm so glad of that they are stored up now you may think God didn't hear you well if there may be a prayer of a mother that had prayed for a son or a daughter that prayer may be stored in a vases which say in heaven for 20 years 25 years 40 years 45 years who knows how long it'll be but God will hear and remember and honor that prayer now here stands this man on the earth and the prophet tells him of the prayer how did he know goes out how did he hear that well that prayer was kept in heaven and God communicated by Vision the prayer that had been stored up and revealing it to the prophet as he's standing on the earth in the realm of the fourth dimension as he's seeing this Vision so it will be something similar to that as we see the end time events now Heaven is so close to being birthed upon the earth now we know that when the bride takes it takes her flight and leaves out of here then there'll be no more blood on the mercy seat for the church ages they will be totally done we know that 144 000 will be called by the overlapping mercy of God that's been given under the dispensation of Esther and the bride and ruse and the bride and God be dealing with sin and sealing twelve thousand out of each tribe but remember it will be such a short span of time as far as Heavenly time is concerned it'll only be three and a half years the that'll be less than that to God so it will be so fast that the events on the earth will be so in tune with what is happening in the heavens that several times during the events that happen the heavens are told to Rejoice now I'm sure that even those of us that are enlightened by the end time message still do not see properly how God views this system which he has spoken so against down through the church ages now remember it's not always necessary to the people that are called inside of there because the voice of God said come out of her my people so it shows everybody in there was not part of their system by Nature they were simply called as it would be an eagle in a cage but they heard the voice of God and they came out of them so keep in mind when you say well this person's a Baptist this is the Catholic this one this and the other well they may be that as of tonight but you have no clue what they'll be this time tomorrow so the spirit of God can be able to reach in there and get them just like he did many of us now once you notice three times Heaven is actually told to rejoice and the first time in the Book of Revelation is actually Revelation 12 12. and that is when Satan is cast down and the second time is in Revelation 18 20 whenever Babylon which is what we just read is going to be destroyed and then the third time is when the marriage of the Lamb is declared which is revelation 19 7. and the men of the earth never have the same point of view as Heaven does you know how blessed you are tonight if you see things the way that God sees them you ought to be one happy individual because most of Humanity on the earth just the other day I read and I saw a picture of the eight billions baby that was born on the Earth imagine the Earth's population has reached 8 billion and they had a picture of this little baby and it had on its little you know its little outfit and it had eight billions written on there eight billion people on the face of their wonder how many out of 8 billion no one little thing about the real truth of the end time message now a lot of them believe in a god a lot of them believe in many gods many of them are polytheistic some of them are monotheistic some of them trinitarians some of them all types of denomination but I wonder how many of them really really know the god of the Bible that is the resurrected Lord Jesus said he's the same yesterday today and forever so here we set tonight not because they're any better not because we deserve it not because there's something great and wonderful about our family or our personality but it's simply one thing God chose you before the foundation of the world that he might be able to share his personal truth with you you're one blessed person tonight so whenever the people on the Earth for the most part they will always be out of synchronization with God just like it was in the days of Noah one man catches the message from God almost everybody else on the face of the Earth was absolutely totally wrong it's been that same scenario over and over again and yet here we said tonight by the grace of God and we are synchronized so in tune with Heaven that one day we will feel a sudden change that will surge through our bodies we won't get a text we won't get a what's that it won't be on Instagram it'll be suffice Instagram will never be able to catch it it'll never be on social media but you will be so in tune with God by your new birth that all of a sudden your sales will start obeying that Great Mighty voice of God and your tissues and your muscles and your bones and all of us sudden the blood will dissipate out of your body because flesh and blood does not inherit the kingdom of God and your gray hairs will go out if you ain't got no hair they'll come back and if you've got false teeth well guess what you're going to get brand new ones and you're going to change in a moment and a twinkling of an eye why because you were praying at that moment nope some of you may not be praying some of you may be asleep some of you may be at work you may be brushing your teeth eating your breakfast and all of a sudden because you are synchronized to Heaven's voice something will begin to happen in you and you're scared to death that you're going to miss it you ain't going to miss it as long as you're synchronized with Heaven how can you miss it you are the very reason that there is a rapture I have no fear of missing the Rapture I never get up one day of my life and say oh no did it happen did it happen why of course not I'm still here I'm still here Immortal and it ain't happened yet when it happens I'm going not possibly not perhaps I am guaranteed why brother Donnie I've got the token in my life he cannot leave me here and I'm synchronized with what he's saying I'm synchronized with what he's doing so when the Rapture transpires I'm going to be synchronized with that but the majority of the earth is always so out of context with what God does what God thinks and what God says that they never know his move until it's way way out and they miss it a million miles oh we're blessed in our church now watch Heaven itself is told to rejoice as these events happen and yet you know I hope you understand this judgment is actually a Vindication of the righteousness of God judgment is a Vindication of the righteousness of God so the voice said Rejoice over her o heaven now while the other people are crying lamenting they're sad they're tore all to pieces but yet Heaven is told to rejoice and now at the same time that this event has happened close to the end of the tribulation period the people on the Earth are lamenting and crying and going honestly hurt and yet the people of the heavens while they're going and enjoying the marriage supper of the Lamb they are interrupted momentarily and they are told to Rejoice well why are they rejoicing because the lamb is there nope because the bride is there nope because the city's been prepared no because Victory is coming to its ultimate goal now again I'm sure that we still don't see this in the way that God does because it was so great that the saints of God God that are now there in their glorified bodies and whatever we'll be doing for three and a half years the Lord God brought that to a halt for a moment and tells us to Rejoice because of something that happened on the earth and it wasn't a virgin birth it wasn't when Jesus got up at the resurrection it wasn't when the Holy Ghost come unto the day of Pentecost that this happened we don't have any record that this happened when Jesus got up from the dead we don't have any record that they were told to rejoice when the Holy Ghost come on Acts chapter one we don't have any record they've won the spirit of God begin to move and the Lord Jesus ascended up into heaven but in this strange when this great city is destroyed and annihilated the people in heaven are told to Rejoice you know what that tells me that tells me we need more understanding of how God is looking forward to this hour of destruction of his greatest enemy that that has been on the earth as far as a government or a system or a move now again I know we say well thank God we're not part of that system and we let it go with that but can you imagine that Heavens are told to Rejoice so this is said now from a voice which is coming from Heaven itself and it calls upon the elect of God which are there in heaven to Rejoice over what they've just been blown away they have just been annihilated by an atomic bomb and the people in heaven are told to Rejoice What A peculiar seeing what a strange thing you see part of our Victory is tied to him being crowned once he consummates all of this when it's going to be put under his feet don't you understand he cannot be brought into being the son of David I was awakened early yesterday morning and I turned over and looked at the clock and it was 503. I lay down I was thinking a little bit praying for different ones it was sick and as I lay there for a few moments the Lord deals with me but sometimes early like that and as I laid there I heard the voice of the Lord say this The Surety of the mercies of David the sure mercies of David the sure mercies of David I knew that that was a scripture but I could not remember exactly what it said but whenever I got up I got on my phone and I began to look at it and I found it in Isaiah and I also found it of course in the book of Acts in the New Testament and it was God a telling of the Covenant which he had made with David and I realized that it was the mercies of God of why actor David did all he did that we've been looking at that God did not blot him out and God so identified it that he called it the sure mercies of David but yet you realize that mercies are not extended to everybody on the earth in that sure way how is it that David did not lose his Covenant now he lost his Joy he lost much of the great things health of his body and things like that because of the sin that he was in but he never lost his Covenant because it was an Everlasting Covenant that God made with him even so identified it and called it the sure mercies of David and when Paul preached about in the book of Acts Paul even quoted that and identified it with the Lord Jesus in the resurrection and placed it as if Jesus was the greater son of David himself and applied that sure mercies of David to the resurrection of our Lord and yet the Lord Jesus cannot become heir to the world until all these enemies are placed under his feet remember what he said in the Psalms he said that he would give him the his enemy for his footstool and that he would Place him under his feet and he promised David of the fruit of thy body well I set upon thy Throne God's saying this of the fruit of of thy body while I set upon thy Throne what the annihilation of this church of this city of this power is one more thing of him coming closer to the Millennium Reign oh how he's been longing for it now can you imagine that he's now going to execute judgment upon them and it's righteous and he said you Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on her he has judged her with the proper judgment now notice in Revelation 18 24 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth now this is another reason for her destruction it's not just because of all the money and all the Commerce but in her was found the very blood of the Saints and how was that because she threw her system through her governmental power and control has a and issued the death of many a child of God and because of that I want you to notice what was in her cup when John saw her on the Scarlet colored beast and it was a cut but it had what in it not wine so much but the blood of the saints of God and God is holding her guilty now and now her time has come therefore because she had drunk of that blood it shows by what she is drinking what her Destiny is well if you and I are drinking of the cup of laodicea then I'm afraid our cuff is going to be filled with the Judgment of God as well but if we are drinking of the wine of the stimulation by revelation of the mercy of God guess what your judgment's going to be it's placed over on Christ and you will stand there as being absolutely forgiven in the eyes of God and because of what you're drinking from your cut show us where you are you've got the wine of Revelation in your cut you can't go through the tribulation where are you going in the Rapture because it's been revealed to you by the Holy Ghost and you are waiting on that Revelation and the church said amen so notice that God is now going to avenge upon them so the very beginning of Apostles say I hope you understand this that the prophet said the Catholic Church actually began on the day of Pentecost now he said they were the original Church oh not Peter James and John but those that come out of that and identified themselves as saying they were Apostolic yeah right they're about as Apostolic as I am a groundhog they're not original Apostolic at all is that right no they think they are and they think they got a right to change the Bible but they don't they don't believe what the apostles taught or wrote or preached they don't do it at all but yet they claim that and because they claim it God will judge them for the claim so God says and all that were slain upon the earth now they know as far as individuals they didn't kill everybody but they kill many many of them and at their declaration and their decree they had many of them killed down Through the Ages and we know through this Spanish Inquisition and the Jewish Inquisition many different ones by the Catholic church and they thought they'd got by with it but they haven't gone by with it at all now notice in Revelation 19 1 and after these things notice this after these things what things the thing that we just saw here in revelation 18. after these things I heard a great voice of much people notice what they were doing in heaven I heard a great noise of much people in heaven now notice what these people were doing after these things were done on the earth so here come an atomic bombing and all they did wrong and all these people were weeping and crying and going on the office ever was and after all of that happened on the earth then Sean said I looked up this way and after those things I Heard a Voice of much people praise God Saints you were right there with them I heard voice of much people and this and what they were saying they were saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord Our God so I to the angel had declared the fall of Babylon you imagine this must been pretty important to God because we're all just up our fellowship and enjoying the blessings of God sent around a marriage supper of the lamb and just talking about the goodness of God wow this is a glorious time for us but all of a sudden what we're doing whatever we're doing we hear this voice that said hey Saints Rejoice rejoice and we say okay wow yeah that's what we do we did that on Earth we're really good at Rejoice what are we rejoicing about an atomic bomb just fell on your enemy an atomic bomb just annihilated this Roman Empire an atomic bomb just destroyed it which means your husband is closer to his song this is her glory to God this is just one more saying that brings him closer to his strong why tell my brother died his Millennium Throne as the son of David amen notice so the angel has declared that Babylon has fallen and then our response is supposed to be what we're supposed to Rejoice well don't you see why then whenever we see a brother or sister delivered of a sickness or a disease or maybe an addiction or a habit or something like that what should we as the saints of God do we should rejoice in the Lord shall we not we see a brother or sister of ours that's been bearing a heavy load or a real difficult time in their life and we hear that God's done something for him well brother Donnie it wasn't me you should Rejoice with them because they are your brothers and sisters now Heaven is going to be so moved and Heaven itself is so moved by this destruction on the earth that this voice reverberates down through eternity you imagine down to the universe and back and here they are the millions of saints of God and they are rejoice and because of what they were saved rejoicing because they got the Holy Ghost rejoice and because they were in the rapture sure rejoicing because Rome's been annihilated well see y'all y'all ain't in tune oh okay Rome's going to be destroyed wow Brother Don that's really something that's really something it is really something it is so important to God now and this voice that screams out of heaven and it's the the way that the word that John used here to write is that the the terms in the Greek language so powerful and it's a voice that he's wanting them not just say Amen amen praise the Lord some of y'all get wilder than bucks sometimes in church you do this you're just beside yourself but John said I don't want you to do this I want you to scream Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah you mean we're rejoicing because people are destroyed we are rejoicing because this Kingdom has been annihilated yes don't you understand how a heaven looks at such things come on I heard a great voice of much people in heaven so the idolatry city is destroyed the idolatrous government is absolutely annihilated and these people are in such Unison with the will of God and this Universal Joy is all forever there won't be a half a dozen send them here me and brother Joel saying well glory to God hallelujah and then this quiet Baptist section over here they said well packages amen amen that's right glory to God but here come this loud voice and they were worshiping and praising and you know what they're all doing it for said praise God it has been destroyed it has been annihilated all glory to God I don't know about you when I've been healed of the sickness in my body or somebody else that I love has been healed I can Rejoice oh I can praise God when I know somebody's been delivered or something they're going through you know when you imagine when we get there and this happens on on the earth and we are so in sync with God in heaven and what's going on that we will rejoice and say hallelujah don't drag out your handkerchief to cry you ain't going to be crying you're not going to be the Lord so sad it's so sad no it is not sad they had their opportunity and they turned it down remember God is not me and God is Not unjust and God would have never done this had they not spurned his Mercy and his grace amen now look at this the word hallelujah it means praise ye yah praise ye yah j-a-h now remember David was the first one in the Old Testament to mention this name yah and the first time it appears David mentions it when he's talking about the wicked being destroyed on the earth wow so David mentions this word praise ye yah in the Book of Psalms and he's mentioning it when the wicked are going to be annihilated now it's amazing because you come from Psalms and then you come through the Old Testament prophetic books they never mentioned it again Matthew Mark Luke and John don't mention it again Pauline Epistles do not mention it again what does it show up again in the Book of Revelation so this tells me that at the end time there's going to be a people that's going to recognize the kingdom is coming so close it's time to praise ye yah amen so what is it praise ye yah or the better name we know it is Jehovah now the Septuagint and also John takes those Greek words and puts it together like a contraction of the Greek letters and makes it an Alleluia instead of a Hallelujah it is an Allelujah so what is it we praise ye yah now the Psalms are divided into ten sorts of Psalms they say but they say that this word hallelujah is the most perfect one because it is praise and yah in one compact form so when you say hallelujah you are praising yah and David was a praising man now I know we've been laying pretty low in the last couple of weeks but don't leave David in the pit because I'm telling you David ain't in the pit but I want to paint him like he was and then I want to show you how God brought him back out again and all glory and God still extended to him the sure mercies of David isn't that an awesome statement you never find that being called the sheer mercies of Abraham or the sheer mercies of Isaac or the sheer mercies of Jacob but the sure mercies of David so God did not leave him in that spot but God raised him up and brought him out no wonder the man could say praise ye yah praise ye yah because David could see himself as a sinner he could see himself as one that fell away from the Providence of God and the will of God and what did God do he reached right down to that muck and he got a hold to David and he lifted him out oh brother I can imagine he was a shouting man I'm telling you what before that fall but after he got renewed I'd say they had a hard time keeping that guy in church when you he was probably so grateful that God forgive him he was so thankful well I'll tell you I feel kind of the same way tonight I'm so thankful know that God called me I'm so thankful that the Lord called you I'm so thankful that the Lord give us the message of the end time I say praise ye yah praise ye yah I always spend more time praising the Democrats and praising the Republicans praising our sickness well the doctor told me this and the doctor told me that my lumbay going my bursitis and my pneumonia and all this what about your God why don't you quit claiming that old bursitis why don't you cook claiming that old or whatever else you've got in your body and go to praise in your God and you might praise your way right out of that Valley praise your way right out of that trial that you're going through or you can sit around and feel sorry for yourself and never move um all glory well I'll tell you I'm longing for the time when we're going to hear those four alleluias I've heard a lot of hallelujahs in my life I've heard him since I was a little 12 year old boy I didn't know what the word meant I just seen my uncle and them at the church why God saved glory to God my uncle was a shouter he take him feet like that and hold them hands up and go to speaking in tongues I'll tell you what whoa he'd say he'd shout hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Oh yes sir he was I'm looking I'm planning on meeting him too hey yeah you you tell me no matter how low he was if I get the guitar and I'd hit the right key and I'd sing I would not be denied Uncle Harold go to stomping them feet I would not be denied you're going to throwing them hands up on the air and dancing around why because he loved the Lord there's something about that song that Minister turned that he wasn't going to be denied and I don't believe he was neither but you know what I've heard a lot of hallelujahs I've heard them in Africa I've heard him in India I've heard them in Europe not as many in Europe I have heard them in England I hope did hear a few actually in England I've heard of you in Norway I've heard a few there but I ain't never heard them like I'm fixing to hear them before long because I'm going to hear it from a bunch of redeemed people that are going to stand there Hallelujah and glorified bodies no more trouble no more heartache no more sorrow not one more day of a sickness not another migraine not another headache not another belly a not another test not another child not another holiday oh you talking about a group of people all being able to say hallelujah praise you how God is mighty well I'll tell you one thing I'm not going to wait till then I'm going to praise him tonight I want to love him I'm going to give him my all what about you I feel like praising him a little let me tell you one thing several several weeks ago I went over to the church and I was going to lay some Stone I started about eight o'clock that morning and I lay till about 4 30 5 o'clock that afternoon on the concrete floor I couldn't hardly walk whenever I got ready to go to my truck by the time I got ready to get in my bed at that night Carol had to help me into the bed my feet were killing me they were inflamed the plantar fasciitis I've been dealing with oh my goodness I thought Lord what in the world am I going to do but you know what in the last several weeks I've been over four and five days every week sometimes eight and ten hours I was there this morning at 6 30 and been laying Stone been staining been doing this and that and the other on the concrete I think it's time I give him a great big Hallelujah Oh Glory why smooth for me well is anybody else in here got something to praise him for is anybody else in here got something that God's moved for you so many times not because she was worthy not because you was good it's because he's good not because we're good but because he loves us and he loves to manifest himself although she'll bother me a little bit but a little bit's better than a whole lot I'm on my way out oh my goodness I'm probably the only preacher that you know of that's been packing six pairs of shoes in his pickup because I want I wear one pair for a couple of hours and then I trade out and wear another pair and then they'll trade out and want another pair to keep my feet from getting by but I feel pretty good right here tonight you know why because the Lord is healing me now he could have done a miracle if he'd wanted to but apparently said no Donnie I ain't going to give you a miracle this time but I'm going to give you a little dab of healing on Monday and another little dab on Tuesday and another little dab on Wednesday and I'm going to get a little bit more on week one and week two and week three praise the Lord I'm about on week four right now look out devil we five might be my complete Miracle but I'll tell you a friend when we is the saints of God realize who we are well we're going the little things of Life shouldn't even slow us down you understand the trials you go through is a sign of coming judgment to Demons ever test you go sir every trial ever disease that God puts under your feet it's a sign of oncoming judgment to Demons it will not go unpunished no wonder they said Hallelujah after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God verse 3. and again a bunch of Holy Rollers and again they said Hallelujah but notice the next words and her smoke rose up forever and ever wow so these people are praising God and smoke is rising up see we have a hard time with that nobody we have a hard time synchronizing that remember how can we Rejoice over such why do we have that that problem between us we don't see his enemy the way he does again they said Hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever the Greek word there is anyone and anyon which means space of time and space of time not eternal or the devil will no doubt be the longest one that will burn and he may be down there for millions of years hope he gets added another couple million just for what he's put us through don't you just burn his old hide down there all his demons with him but it will eventually come to a time to when all of these people will cease to exist now people call us mean yeah mean and having no mercy because we preach election and predestination and they say they're full of Mercy and preaching eternal hell so a person lived 16 years of their life and they go out and get drunk on their 16th birthday or 17th birthday and they die and they're going to go to a lake of fire and Burn For Eternity for 17 years of sin and then you tell me when God Mercy I say you don't understand Mercy my God is a just God he is not going to judge a 17 year old boy an 18 year old girl for the same amount that he's going to judge the prince of the power of the air that old boy has gone a long time I'm telling you and I'm going to be rejoicing when he gets thrown in ain't you I'm going to Rejoice whenever they lock him up with a chain of circumstance that he ain't got nobody in the Millennium to be able to work through notice them when our hearts really get in tune with God it's not that we look at upon people and say well I'm glad they're going through this and I'm glad we're going to that but we look at it in a higher form in a God form that God is bringing the kingdoms of this world in subjection to his word I know some of you it kills you because you're your party whatever it is your party's not the controlling this and this and that you're wanting your party to make things better it's too far gone it's too far gone I don't care who we get in the White House the White House is doomed our nation is finished come on Saints it's the truth there's no hope for the nation itself but there is hope for individuals there's only one hope for this world and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus now watch this in the 4 and 20 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped wow what a peculiar thing to worship God over people smoke is coming up and you're just having a spell I mean you're just glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord and they just fall down the elders just fall down they say this is awesome this is absolutely wonderful this is tremendous this is great this is a great sign of victory y'all sitting there look at him and trying to figure this out this has been and the throne is right before him cannot take it as long as they rule notice this in the 420 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God said on the throne saying amen Hallelujah in verse 6. and I heard it's a word of voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters any all ever stood at the Niagara Falls and y'all ever sit at great great waterfalls and you hear that sound of all those millions of gallons of water coming over there that that Roar and that splashing and all I've seen some of the large rivers of the world and been in Africa and places like that and to see some of those Falls it's just absolutely breathtaking and each one of those is a drop of water so it's a drop in another drop and another drop in another drop now you take one of those drops out of that that water that's going to come down on the Niagara and you take that one drop and isolate it and let it make it sound you probably wouldn't even hear it you just dropped that little one drop of water and you just try to listen listen when you're nothing but you take it and it's brothers and its uncles and his cousin and his grandma and his nephew and his great grandma and his great nephew and his third grandma and all that sort of thing and you put them all together then what do you get and you're back saying your little voice ain't much well it may not be much to you but to him it's a whole lot but you put yours with yours and yours and yours and yours and mine and then with yours and without one then what does it do and John heard all of these voices as they were thundering down there can you imagine all the saints now in glorified bodies that was Paul that was Luther that was Western that was all the saints of all the ages that was Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all the elect of God and they are told to Rejoice you think they had to be pumped up you think they had to have a service leader in heaven all right everybody let's get into the spirit now let's everybody worship God clap your hands and two of you clap your hands and the rest of you said to her all right let's try it again now we're here tonight to not be Spectators but participator and boy whenever that voice said time to worship they said yes Lord hallelujah all right it's time to worship and it sound like foreign Hallelujah to our God Hallelujah to our god that same enemy that had us bound when we were down on the earth and he set us free now he's broke that hold on the earth we're fixing to go back down there and take the Earth over why what not you rejoice knowing that the Millennium is right before you oh brother sister the whole creation is groaning for that Oh Glory out of herd as it were the voice of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters and it's the voice of Mighty thunderings ah mighty thunderings but listen what they was thundering Hallelujah Hallelujah that wasn't thundering a theory or a Doctrine or a church catechism but praise ye yah praise ye yeah you think Heaven is just going to be all of us sitting around debating on the serpent scene you think we're just going to go down this Avenue and you know there'll be two brothers over and they're talking about Serpentine you go down the other Avenue and there'll be two more brothers so they got a different opinion on Serpentine and then you go on the other side of Praise Avenue where it meets The Glory Avenue and there's going to be three more brothers Sam Anderson I'll tell you one thing I don't believe the way he just you you believe it I did no I don't either I know I could say that there ain't going to be none of that there there won't be no arguing boy that'll be Heaven itself won't it that won't be no difference of opinion nobody will ever shun you and you won't you never show nobody nobody will ever speak one word about anybody there because there ain't no bad bodies there there ain't no bad words there there ain't no bad talking there's never be one person ever standing on the streets of gold and gossip about another nobody will ever put their hand over their mouth and Whisper to somebody else and somebody walked down through there and get accomplice because they just knew you was talking about them and actually was talking about the price of Ajax between between the Food City and English and that's it you know how we are with our complexes we see nobody looking to say he was looking right at me oh my goodness when I walk about you watch them put your hand over that you know that's the way come on don't sit there and look at me that's the way we are but we need a new birth not only in our soul but in our bodies our bodies need to be changed oh praise God there'll be no racial problems there there'll be no political parties there there'll be no differences take part the world this will be nobody will ever get hurt nobody will ever get upset nobody will ever get mad boy if I ain't enough to shout about nobody will ever get all bent out of shape and nobody will ever ever be broke down nobody will ever be sad it'll all be praised and worship and love and adoration and Perfection and Eternity and Eternity and more eternity and whenever you think you've come to the end of it you'll find out you've just started and you say how long does it go forever forever it never stops [Applause] oh I just wish we could go tonight man after preaching this stuff tonight I don't want to go to work tomorrow sorry brother say nothing against you oh Hallelujah praise ye yah Hallelujah praise the Lord and they're just worshiping and praising and hell is breaking loose down on the Earth and they're not necessarily praising God that people are annihilated they're not praising God that these people are going through so much trouble they're praising God that the end is so close at hand and their husband is fixing to be the son of David going to be crying cracking Hallelujah the destruction of sin and the destruction of the man of sin you see it will reverberate can you imagine voices like that all the way down Rippling down through eternity to the universe where it ceases to exist if it does and turns and comes back that's what Reverb is reverberation so in every room you have an acoustic now this and you're pretty dead so whenever I cut my hands it's pretty much dead but you're going to a building you can pretty well tell how much Acoustics you got there but you clap your hands in one two three four five and that's how much soundproofing that you're going to have to do can you imagine in heaven when the Acoustics are absolutely perfect and all these millions times millions of voices begin to ring out and they begin to worship and praise and somebody brings out on a course and we'll begin to bless the name of the Lord and sing and all this is going on they say praise the Lord praise the Lord what's going on down in heaven nukes uh watching me y'all y'all are Rejoice him because some people got blowed up no no we're rejoicing because it's one step closer for us and our husband to get back our inheritance praise the Lord now remember they're not doing this out of a vindictive spirit they're not doing this because they're events they seek somebody down there that they didn't lock on Earth and they see somebody that done them wrong oh I knew they'd get it on there they'd get it no that's not their Spirit at all now they're totally changed into his image oh praise the Lord notice verse 2. for true and righteous ah now you see this is why we have a problem true and righteous are his judgments not his Mercy not his grace not his forgiveness but his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication I'd hath Avenge the blood of his servants at her hand and their rejoicing because of that I mean you understand we need help see the calamities that come upon these people are rightly deserved rightly deserved the Hittites the amorites the jebusites all the Canaanite people the seven tribes God did not go in there and drive out a good sincere God loving god-abiding people and give their land to the children of Israel they burned their children they offered their children to moloch to keemosh they've done horrible horrible things and God judged them for it and took their land and gave it to the children of Israel the children of Israel several Generations after that what did they start doing burning their children offering their children to Molech to keemosh and what did God do drive them out and send them to Babylon so it was just judgment so now God is annihilating this enemy oh my for he has judged the great horde Jezebel of course Babylon the romish Antichrist um notice this let me bring it on down now second Thessalonians chapter one verse 6. seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you just a little bit of friendly advice if I was you I'd be good to everybody not just your friends not just your family those that you like now think what Paul said seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that troubled you so persecution is an affliction those who persecute us those who laugh at your hair sisters your dress those that life at the doctrines that we hold on to and hold us dear those who make fun of us and run us down and so on and so on and so on it's not just what they say about us in social media and what they do but it brings a pressure in our spirit it brings a tribulation as it were to our mind what will they do what will they say how will they react now listen what Paul said you see Paul it broke in to this understanding about an aspect of the righteousness of God that as I can tell from looking some of you tonight you're still struggling with Paul only broke into it to recompense tribulation to them that was troubling the saints of God is that God will trouble the troublemakers God will trouble the troublemakers but he will relieve the troubled amen I don't want to be no Troublemaker to you well I mean except for the devil and for hell of course I do want to do that you see your trials are a sign of a coming judgment yeah someone is persecuting you now many times it's people under demonic influence say themselves are not necessarily Wicked or evil but they just get under the influence of an evil spirit and they go to troubling you and harassing you and saying things against you whatever more that it is and it's like something that hangs over you and you just can't get over it you know sometimes it can be somebody you work with sometimes it can be a family member it can be a friend it can be all kinds of people and yet they just it's like they get joy out of trouble you anybody ever deal with anybody like that well sure you have and yet it's something that you try your best to work around you nice to them and you try to do whatever you can do just to calm them and settle them and it seems like nothing that you ever do makes any difference remember most of the time that's an evil spirit that is using that individual don't don't hate them don't get angry and all upset at them just pray for them that God will have mercy on them help them to see that they're just an instrument is all they are but notice what Paul said the same that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you so God will punish punish those who trouble his bride those who ridicule this message those who make fun of God's Prophet oh my goodness God will bring anguish and anxiety and trouble and if they do not repent they will stand before God at the white throne and give an account for every word they have said against this word it's righteous with God to trouble troublemakers sweet Jesus I thought I was in trouble a while ago I'm really in trouble now well that friend this ought to make every one of us not be a troublemaker in her home and our church in the move of God in our business on your job United some people I don't care what you do they are never happy it just seemed like they are born for adversity and I don't care what you do it's just they do they're never happy if you paint if you put Green carpet on the floor they'll say I didn't want green I wanted purple and if you put purple on the floor they say I didn't want that shade of purple I wanted the other shade of purple and if you paint the walls green they wanted Yeller and if you paint it yellow they say I don't like that Yeller I wanted that Yeller I don't want this and I don't like that and it seemed like they're not happy unless they're causing trouble but Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God oh my now Paul is speaking this from experience and where this is written from of course is the city of thessalonica and remember that Paul had been driven from thessalonica by persecution of a bunch of zealous Jews which hated him a mob attacked several of the Saints some of them were arrested the children of God Paul had to sneak out of the city by night so Paul is speaking this from experience I don't believe he was writing in this now I had a vindictiveness I can't wait till God Burns her height and hell I'll tell you one thing he is declaring a decree from God it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you right well you see the word there are trouble is this word philipsis the Greek word philipsis and it means great emotional stress caused by external or internal pressure great emotional and spiritual stress caused by internal or external stress or pressure let's stand for real oh the final destruction of the great enemy of the church was so momentous that God tells them to say hallelujah and they do the great voice out of heaven or smoke starts rising up and they are so happy of what they see happening that they say it again and then the voice of many Waters and then in verse 6 I heard of voices of a great multitude as the voice of many Waters the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reignus they were rejoicing and rejoicing why they saw their King coming closer to his crowd and they rejoiced oh I'll tell you one thing friends I think we ought to Rejoice more and complain less I believe we'd be better off don't you let me read this to you this is the fourth time in which this is uttered in an expressive of the joy of the heavenly host in the view of the overthrow of the enemies of the church and the occasion was so momentous in heaven they just couldn't stop praising they just couldn't stop rejoicing hallelujah hallelujah and then they stopped and somebody else started again well Hallelujah and it was just catching it was just like it was catching and then they kind of calmed down a little bit and they heard another voice say I wish somebody would praise the Lord and somebody said hallelujah hallelujah mama I wish we'd become a little bit more like that you ever get around anybody that you ask them how they're doing and 30 minutes later you wish you hadn't they've got their CT scan on their phone they've got their MRI they've got the brain scan their liver scan the pancreas scan the gallbladder scan they've got to ever scan them and they tell you and you say dear God I wish I hadn't even asked and you whenever have you ever felt worse after being around people like that you ever wow wow so why is that because it creates that kind of an atmosphere well I wonder if we'd be a little bit more contagious with praise and love and worship don't you figure that's kind of contagious too wonder what service to be here Sunday if we come in here and brother Aaron and some of you brothers and some of you sisters and you young sisters you would commend you and say praise God I'm so excited about the service I'm just so happy I'm just so excited oh man can you imagine now people that love football and all these things you know they're going to be buying tickets and they're going to be going out there to freeze to death and they got electric socks and they got electric shawls and electric ear warmers and electric hats and electric electric a lot and it never Struck it boom The Smithereens with it they're sitting out there and they're going to scream and raw raw raw they'll paint their face red and green and black because they want to look like their team and they'll jump up and down the snow will be a flying they'll drink hot chocolate they'll do everything they can why that's their God they love all of that and if they looked at us they'd think them people's crazy they jump up when the preachers preaching and they clap their hands and they say hallelujah what in the world is a matter of some people we're getting a little bit of touch from the other side amen and we've got something to praise him about we've got something to worship him about well I've seen if we would become a little bit more contagious to one another we might rub off on the brother that's having a really hard time or the sister that's going through a little bit of a trial and she come to the house of God and God knew that she needed a little bit more of a tug than maybe what you did you might be responsible for helping them through that wouldn't that be a wonderful thing wouldn't that be a wonderful thing you stand before the Lord that day and say you know what you didn't know it but that day there on Wednesday night there on the Holiday Inn and you come in there and you just made up your mind I'm going to praise him tonight there's three or four of my children standing by you and they were so weary and they watched you raising your hands and it uplifted them and you saying I ain't never done nothing for the kingdom of God when you serve God's bride you serve God say an encouraging word say a prayer be kind to someone you just help Jesus how many of you would like to be in here when the Lord Jesus was here and if Jesus was carrying that cross wouldn't you like to bend like the man that come up there and bore his cross wouldn't that been wouldn't that been an opportunity a privilege in the blood of Jesus on that cross God on your back and God on your face and maybe you're Jesus rubbed faces and the blood of Jesus you got down off of there and you looked and there was the blood of Jesus you said oh my Lord the blood of Jesus he said oh what an honor you'd never want to wash your face again you'd never want to wash your hands again or if I'd have been there by the time I'd love to give him a drink you can give somebody in his body one if you give one of my disciples a drink of water you ought to know why a solution hey we're not talking about just preachers don't look out preachers you can be kind to be kind to anybody in the body Paul said especially the household of faith I like to say kind words to people in the Drive-Thru especially when they get my order wrong which is just about every time so I just do what I tell y'all do just go and give me what you want to you will anyhow but you realize a kind word a kind word I come through one not long ago and I'd ordered whatever it was and I pulled up to the window the God said you order so and so and so I said no I sure didn't I ordered a pumpkin sandwich and I ordered I mean I went through a bunch of stuff and that guy busted out of life and I'll come through there in a couple days and he said you want that pumpkin sandwich again now you see it made him laugh it made some of you life and you've been sitting the Earth's hours on the water all night long you never know what a kind word can do to somebody have we got enough goodness to spread it out have we got enough joy to kind of just spread it out if you ain't got enough tonight this is a good place to get filled with it don't you love him with all your heart the spirits together Heavenly Father we love you so much we thank you for your word Lord I'll be the first to admit Lord God I need your help too looking at these things in my Humanity Lord I I would have a hard time being able to differentiate righteousness of being able to rejoice when enemy is destroyed I would have a hard time separating the human feeling toward that but I know when we are changed that we will be able to participate I believe with all of my heart there are people here in this place tonight and many many hundreds of thousands of more that will hear this service that will be some of the voices that will ring out in Revelation 19. some of these people here tonight will be some of the very ones that will say hallelujah on that day thank you Lord Jesus well father we don't want to wait till then to say praise yah
