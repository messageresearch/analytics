Through your precious [music and singing] blood I found and my sins are washed. [music and singing] They're all washed away. All my [music] sins are [singing] washed away. [music] No one knew how alone I was feeling. [singing] [music] And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Though [music and singing] I laughed and said my life was fine without you. I was covering [music and singing] up the secret tears I cried. [music] Then one [singing] day someone told me of your mercy and the love you [music and singing] showed on a hill called Calvary. [music and singing] There you die to purchase [music] my redemption. When you [singing] broke sin's power [music] and set my spirit free, I'm [music and singing] amazed that you love me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed how you came through [music] your [singing] preious blood. I found you [music] and my [singing] sins are washed. [music] They're all [singing] washed away. [music] All my sins are washed [music] away. [singing] It's true. There have been days when I [music] failed you. Lord, you know the many [music] times [singing] I've gone astray. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But I've heard your love is stronger than [singing] my weakness [music] and your [singing] ear is old every time I pray. [singing] [music] No one else has ever cared for me like [music] you, Lord. [singing] Other friends could never be as close [music] to me. I'm not [singing] afraid to face the problems of tomorrow. [music] [singing] Knowing you are everything [music and singing] I'll ever be. I'm amazed [singing] that [music] you love me. That you love me. I'm amazed [singing] how you [music] came. Through your preious [music] blood I [singing] found [music] and my sins are [singing] washed. They're [music] all washed away. All my [singing] sins are [music] washed away. [music] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. [applause] Ain't it good to be in the house of the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's raining on the outside, but we're expecting good things in here. Uh, I want to welcome I forgot to do that the other day. I want to welcome everybody to service and welcome our streamers. Um, want to just make sure everybody's welcome and do that part. I forgot and I don't want to do that no more. Um, some I got told a lot. You don't realize how much people pay attention to what you don't do. But you can be seated. I'm going to go over the prayer requests real quick. First got an announcement. This is a reminder that daylight savings time ends Sunday, November the 2nd.

Please remember brother Frank and sister Jackie Williams in prayer. Brother Frank is dealing with pain in from his back procedure and sister Jackie is dealing with elevated blood pressure. They wanted to say they love and miss everyone so much. And I I can say I know all too well that I hear from my grandparents how much they they just miss. And streaming's great, but it's just not they especially when you just long to have fellowship with people. Please remember sister Linda Larson prayer. She is dealing with sinus infection. Unable to be in the house of the Lord. A brother from Africa, brother Tippo James is requesting prayer for him. his family and all the saints in Africa.

Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, just want to thank you for allowing us to come together, Lord, and just to worship and praise you, Father, for all you've done for us, Lord. Lord, you see these requests, each one are dear to the ones that wrote them. Pray, Father, that you just intervene for each situation and just meet each need, Father, in your perfect will. Lord, you see the minister that's preaching tonight. I pray, Father, that you'll just help him to lay everything aside and just anoint him, Father. May you just help us to pull in the gift that you put in his life, Lord. Lord, just commit everything to your hands, Father. Lord, may everything we say and do be pleasing to you. We just love you and thank you in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brothers, come lift the tithes and offering. &gt;&gt; Singless indeed. Never been indeed.

So, wants to thank the church for praying. &gt;&gt; There's a light [music] in the window, a table spread in [music] splendor. [singing] Someone standing by [music and singing] the open door. [music] I can see the family [singing] again. [music] Lord, I must be near forever. Cuz I've never been this home sick before. [music] See the bright light shine. It's just about [music] hold time.

[singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; If the singers are get ready to come make their way and brother David [music] so many [singing] times I've questioned certain certain circumstances [music] for things I could not [singing] understand. Many [music] times [singing] in trials, weakness blurs my vision and my frustration [music and singing] gets so out of hand. [music] And [singing] I am reminded I've never been [music] forsaken. I've never had to stand one test alone. [music and singing] And as I look at all [singing] the victories, the spirit rises [music] up in me as through the fire. My weakness [singing] is made strong. Sing it [music] to it. He never [singing] promised that the [music] cross would not be heavy and the hill would not be [music] hard to [singing] climb. [music] He never [singing] offered victories without fighting. [singing] He said h [music] would always come time. [singing] Just remember [music] when you stand in the valley [music and singing] of decision and the adversary s [music and singing] just hold on. [singing] Our [music] Lord will show and he will [music] take you through fire again. [singing] [music] I know [singing] within myself that I [music] will surely if I trust the hand of [music and singing] God, he'll shield the flames again. again. [music] He never [singing] promised [music] that the cross would not be heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never [music and singing] offered victory without fighting. He said he would always come in [music and singing] time. Just remember [music] when [singing] standing in the valley of [music] decision and the adversary [singing] says [music] giving. Just hold on. [music] Our Lord will show and he [music and singing] will take you through the fire again. [music] Oh, just hold [singing] on. Our [music] Lord will show up and [singing] he will take you to the fire again. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's give our singers a good hand. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; If you you know the chorus, it's this is a simple song, Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus. You can sing it with me. Uh I don't know if they have the the verses, but I'm [music] going to sing the verses, but if you'd like to sing the chorus with me, no matter what you're going through, [music] if you can just turn your eyes to him, he's the answer. Oh soul, are you weery and trbled? No light [singing] in the [music] darkness. You see, there's a light [singing] for [music] a look at the Savior [singing] and life more [singing and music] abundant and free. [music] Turn your eyes upon Jesus. [music and singing] Look [singing] for in his wonderful face. And the things of [singing] earth will grow [music] strangely [singing] dim in the light of his glory and grace. [singing] through death into [singing] life everlasting. [music] He passed and we follow [singing] him there over a sin. No more hath dominion [singing] for more [singing] than conquerors we are. [singing] [music] So turn [singing] your eyes [music] upon Jesus. [singing] Look [music] for in his wonderful [singing] face, and the [singing] things of earth will [singing and music] grow strangely dim in the [singing] light of his glory [music] and grace. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Let's [music] sing the chorus again. Turn [singing] your eyes [music] upon Jesus. Look for [singing] in his wonderful face. [singing] [music] And the things of [singing] earth will grow [music] strangely dim in the light [singing] of [music] his glory and grace. [singing and music] [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; In Christ alone [singing] my hope is [music] found. He is my light, my strength, my [singing] song. [music] This cornerstone, this solid [singing] ground, firm through the [music] fiercest drought and storm. What heights [music and singing] of love, what depths of peace, when [music] fears are still [singing] and striving cease. My comforter, my [music] all [singing] in all. Here in the love of [music] Christ [singing] I stand. [music] In Christ [singing] alone, took on flesh, [music] fullness [singing] of God in helpless [music] faith. [singing] This gift of love and righteousness [singing] scorned [music] by the ones he came to [singing] sing. Till on [music] that cross as [singing] Jesus died. [music] The wrath of God was satisfied. [singing] For every [music] sin on him [singing] was laid. Here in the death of [music] Christ I [singing] live. [music] There in [singing] the ground his body laid. Light of the world by [music and singing] darkness slain. and bursting [singing and music] forth in glorious day. Up from the grave he [singing] rose again. And [music] as he stands in victory. [singing] Sin's curse has lost its grip on [music and singing] me. For I am his and [singing] he mine, brought with [music] a precious blood [singing] of Christ. No guilt in [music and singing] life, no fear in death. This is [music and singing] the power of Christ in me. From my first [music] try to the final pray, Jesus commands my [music] destiny. No power of hell. No [music and singing] scheme of man can ever pluck me from his [music and singing] hand till he rejects or calls [singing] me home. Here in the power of [music and singing] Christ I'll stand [music] till he returns or [singing] calls me home. Here in the power [music] of Christ I'll stand. [singing] [applause] stand as we get ready to go forth. Can you do that? I want Brother Harry to sing. When I think about how awesome our Lord and Savior is and all he does for us, it just I love to hear Brother Harry sing this song. Don't don't hate me. [panting] and sing it for us. &gt;&gt; Such an awesome God, brother, if you can pull. &gt;&gt; He's such an awesome God. &gt;&gt; You glad to be here [music] tonight? [snorts] &gt;&gt; I don't know a better place other than to be &gt;&gt; sitting around the [music] throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Seated [singing] in mesty. Just enter into worship. Reigning [singing] in holyness. The table [music and singing] is set for me. [singing] [music] You are the living bread. Such [music] an awesome [singing] God. So mighty. [music] Oh [singing] holy so wonderful. Such [music] an awesome [singing] God. So selfless. [music] So [singing] generous, so faithful [singing] you are. [music] You call [singing] the sun to rise. You &gt;&gt; [singing and music] &gt;&gt; lay down to rest. You hold [music and singing] this heart of mine. [music] You [singing] hold my every breath. Such [music] an awesome God. [singing] So mighty, [music] so [singing] holy, [music] so wonderful. Such [music] an awesome God. [singing] So selfless, [music] so generous, so faithful. [music] [singing] You are and [music and singing] nothing comes close to the Lord Almighty. [music and singing] Nothing is as sweet as his love [singing] and mercy. [music] Nothing comes close to the Lord [singing] mighty. [music] Nothing is as sweet as [singing] his love and mercy. [music] Such an awesome [singing] God, so [music] mighty, so [singing] holy, so wonderful. [music] You're an awome God. So selfless, [music] so generous, [singing] [music] so faithful. You are such an awesome God so [singing] mighty, [music] so holy, so wonderful, [singing] [music] such an awesome God. So selfless, [music and singing] so generous, [music] so [singing] faithful. You are such [music] an awesome [singing] God. He's awesome as your working. &gt;&gt; No. I got all kinds. &gt;&gt; It's a good times going. There we go. Had a hornet. I got a box full of stuff. All right. My boys looked at me that the Granger box come on the porch. It's like, "Oh, good. I need that." And they said, "Dad, using a a prop again?" I just got to do what God tells me to do. So, &gt;&gt; I'm simple. If y'all aren't expecting to put on your wet suits and go deep, you might as well take them flippers off. We're staying right here on the surface. Amen. God bless you. It's good to be here. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I ain't got nothing new. Half of you about ready to hit the door. I ain't got nothing new. &gt;&gt; But I think I have something that the Lord wants to be said. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that you need whether you know it or not. Something that I need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we certainly love you, Lord. We thank you so much for all you do for us, Lord. We thank you for your presence. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for all the mighty things that you do, Lord. We're so thankful to you, Lord Jesus. And we've come to this place tonight, Father, to not hear from me or just see one another, even though that that's nice to see one another, Lord. We we believe in fellowship, Lord. But Lord Jesus, we're looking to get a little closer to you. We're looking to fellowship with you, Father. And Lord Jesus, that that can't happen unless I get out of the way. Unless the people get out of the way, Lord Jesus, and you just take over, Father, we just love you and we thank you so much. Just have your way. Be with us now. We ask it your name. Amen. Is this too It's rebounding real bad. I don't know how to Is that better? Okay, let's turn to Acts chapter 2, please. I know. So, I will tell you that the devil did not want this coming out. It's been on my heart for months. So, he's been fighting hard, but here I am. &gt;&gt; Here they are. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, this could be like a 50-part series, but we're going to keep it short. Acts chapter 2, verse 37. Now, when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, men and brother, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them,"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call." May the Lord add his blessings to his word. You may be seated. I'm going to try Harry, you know how to do this. Usually I'm not a mic snob, but this is driving me crazy. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we are I'd like to speak, Lord willing, tonight on God's gift. God's gift. And I'm not talking about preachers. Oh. Oh. Not talking about a prophet. I'm talking about God's gift. When we think, what's God's gift? We always go immediately to that spot, right? &gt;&gt; We always go to Well, God's gift is is Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Well, yeah, it is. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Brother Jackie knows where I'm going. It wasn't the Brother Brandon was not God's gift. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we're going to get to the props. Now, I have here a box. I have another box and another box and another box. And then this box was to hold all the boxes. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So each one of these boxes has the potential to hold something. &gt;&gt; When we think of a gift, we might think of it. It comes in a box. Well, some nowadays it's a bag. When I was a kid, it was a box. &gt;&gt; Know the silly bags with the fru paper in it. &gt;&gt; It was a box. Now, these aren't taped up and and all fancy and but but but they could be. And you can see that this one, it says Steris. That's where I work. And I have a lot of boxes because I got a lot of parts. And so what I've done is is I've I've put certain things in in in boxes. And and I want you to think as yourself is just a box. &gt;&gt; We all have the potential to carry something &gt;&gt; within us. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We all have that ability. That's what God made us for. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; We got the soul. That's our That's our box. We got a box. So when we come to the world, we scream, we shout, we whine, we cry, we do what boxes do. &gt;&gt; And then we have a choice. We come up in age and we have a choice. What are we going to be filled with? &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; right. All right. &gt;&gt; What what is it that we are going to put inside of us? &gt;&gt; So being a holiness people, we want to put pure things, the word, &gt;&gt; good things, &gt;&gt; God things, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're we're born to serve God, &gt;&gt; the Native Americans never heard of Jesus Christ, but they worshiped. We were born to worship. &gt;&gt; We had a desire for that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So these agnostics that think that we just are, they're going against human nature. &gt;&gt; It's just crazy. &gt;&gt; They're they're fighting the very thing that they are, they're they're just boxes. And so what they filled their box up with is unbelief. &gt;&gt; They filled their box up with doubt. &gt;&gt; They think we're crazy. &gt;&gt; But there's still a a box, a package, and they're looking to fill it up. And and everybody in the world is filled up with something. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's good something. It's a bad something. It's a crazy something. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not talking about physical cuz if you're thinking you filled up with Twinkies, that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about spiritual things, &gt;&gt; natural things. That that that's not natural. We're talking about spiritual things. So, in this box right here, it's not the prettiest box. This is an actual part that I use at Steris. It's a It's a steam filter. Would this steam filter be any good to you? Do you have the uh the um um canister that this goes in? Do you use steam on a regular basis? No. No. Does anybody here use steam? Uh, brother Joel does. Oh, so all of a sudden this little thing has gone up in value to one person in particular. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, God could put what you have inside of you for one person. &gt;&gt; What? Now, I've got this. &gt;&gt; We'll go into that a little bit more. Now, in this box, I've got this. Now, I imagine this cuts out about 50% of this population here. Right [sighs] &gt;&gt; now, Brother Josiah might deny it, but when you're not looking, he'd get down and play with this, &gt;&gt; right? Now, Sister Janet probably like, "I'll trip over that. Let's kick it to the side." &gt;&gt; Now, I I went several places to find this particular thing, but we'll get to that here in a minute, too. But the box held that, &gt;&gt; now that appeals to more people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's it's I know this is simple, but just stay with me. Now, this box is empty. It's about to have a bug in it. There's nothing in it. There's no value. You've all done that the the the package prank, right? You get something real small and you put it inside a box. inside a box. Inside a box, inside a box and then the person that's big, oh, I want the big one. And then they start unwrapping it and there's nothing really that great in it. Nothing there. Some people, they have no God. They just float. &gt;&gt; They just float. They're just there, empty. No purpose. I feel sorry for people like this. &gt;&gt; This comes from a lot of of different combinations. Maybe it was the way they were raised. &gt;&gt; Maybe they were told they were nothing. &gt;&gt; That they would never be anything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They never been exposed to the gospel. They just have nothing. They're just nothing. &gt;&gt; Do you feel sorry for people like that? doesn't mean that there's not potential &gt;&gt; in this box. &gt;&gt; They just haven't been filled with much of anything yet. Now, this box is more trucks. I'm I'm sorry, ladies. I'm not really familiar with dolls. It might be unusual these days, but I know trucks, cars. Now, these are different than that one over there. Now, that one I I got at Walmart. That one I got at the Dollar Tree or Dollar General or something. But I want to go back to this right here. this filter. Now, if you were guessing, if I had a little a little boy up here maybe and I asked him to pick out something, he's going to go for these one of these cars. He's looking at this going, "Do you know how much this little thing right here is?" $1,821. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's valuable. &gt;&gt; You could buy a whole lot of little cars like that &gt;&gt; for this right here. &gt;&gt; But this means nothing &gt;&gt; to a little boy. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; This is valuable. Now, Brother Joel when he's looking at his budget says, "Slide that my way, brother John. Put put them steam filters on my Now, believe it or not, the little boy might not want this. Might not care anything about this, but this right here has a potential to save your lives. every one of you. It's a steam filter 0.1 microns. It goes on a steam sterilizer. The steam sterilizer is used to sterilize instruments used in the O. Oh, so if you got dirty steam and they get junk on those instruments and the doctor is using that instrument, you got the potential for infection. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now, you might not be able to put this into practice and use it, but I'm sure you would appreciate it if you were on the table. Right? &gt;&gt; I know it's simple, but it if you if you stop and think what I'm talking to you about spiritual things, this will help you. So, this thing is $1,821. And I've got a I just sold apparatus totaling almost $45,000 worth of stuff without the filters. 45. But the O that I s sold them to, they were excited about getting them. You know why? Cuz they had dirty steam. And this dirty steam was staining their instruments. And what happens when you get a stained instrument? They have to reprocess it. or if they miss it, it goes inside you or me. &gt;&gt; There's potential. Now, this was in Winston Salem. Don't worry about it. But they're willing to pay that high price. And brother Joel will tell you that hospitals are not ready to come off money real easy. He is a definite witness to that. They don't like coming off that money. So while that that in particular might not appeal to most people, &gt;&gt; it's still very valuable. &gt;&gt; Very valuable. It saves lives potentially. right &gt;&gt; now. We've got this these little cars here. I'm getting to something. Hold on. I brought a pocketk knife cuz I know how these packages are. Now in the box, no little kid is ever going to say, "Oh, wow. That's neat." and leave it in the box. Never going to put it into into practice. Are you kidding me? They got to take it out. It's got to be used. Now, those little cars are great just like that. But in order to operate them, I've got to use them, &gt;&gt; right? You can't put gas in this and use it. And that's the way a lot of Christians are. &gt;&gt; They've got a gift, but they want to use it themselves. &gt;&gt; They want to do it all themselves. Now you know why I went to two different stores. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; again. This one is no good in a box. This is where that lapel mic would be a whole lot better here. Now this one. It goes by itself. Huh. I don't have to manly do it. I just have to pull it back a little bit. and let it go. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we just got to pull back a little bit and let go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let God &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let him He's the power. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's in charge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one taking control. But we got We got too many people that that just want to play with this They have the potential for this. Let go and let God. Let God do it. &gt;&gt; I know it's simple. But if we stop, step back and look at it, that's what God wants to do with us. &gt;&gt; He wants he's we got all the potential in the world. He wear all the package. And there's different places and stages and and and thing that people are at. Some are empty. Some got a lot in them. We got denominational people. &gt;&gt; We've got message people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we're so focused on the ministry and on brother Brandon, but we're not seeing that we are that package &gt;&gt; and we have the potential for God to use me. Now, so we get to this place. It says, Brother Brandham says, "God bless you, my Christian friend, when you sit down, you Christians around them, shake their hands and give them your your right hand of fellowship. Say, God bless you." Now, this is this is as far as denominations go. Turn around, shake your hands. You're Christians now? You're saved. That's salvation. And then he asked, he said, "All of you happy they come to Christ? If you are, say amen." How many promise will promise these Christians that tonight before they go to bed, these will just now accepted Christ? So he he's saying you'll pray for them. He said, "Now remember, you're just accepted Christ. See, now God will give you the Holy Ghost in confirmation of your faith. &gt;&gt; So a lot of the Christian churches believe that you get the Holy Ghost right when you accept Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's all the further they get. They set on the salvation and they don't ever move forward in in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They sit right there and say, "Okay, I'm a Christian now. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; So when they accept that, they're like this. &gt;&gt; That's their salvation. &gt;&gt; They're in charge. They're in control. They're the ones running their lives. They're the ones telling where to go and how to go and what to do. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; We got a lot of preachers like that. &gt;&gt; Got a lot of lot of uh singers like that. Come on now. &gt;&gt; They want to do it. They're going to be a blessing and they and they've got talent. &gt;&gt; We've seen preachers that have a lot of talent. &gt;&gt; They can really preach, &gt;&gt; but they're the ones steering. &gt;&gt; They're the ones doing it. Anybody can put it together. Anybody can study it. We've got an info base, right? &gt;&gt; That's not hard to do. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can get a thought and bless God. You can really preach &gt;&gt; Hitler was a preacher, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Now, before you start texting me nasty stuff, I ain't calling anybody a Hitler. I'm just saying. [snorts] But that's where that's where people are at. They they they accept Jesus Christ and their salvation is there and they and their their little package and they and they're letting that whatever that Jesus Christ they accepted that they they let they let it down in their heart and they say, "Okay, I'm good enough." &gt;&gt; There is an overabundance of that mentality in this message. I've accepted the message. I'm good enough. &gt;&gt; I listen to tapes. I pay my tithe. I go to church or I don't go to church or whatever it might be. There's an overabundance of of getting settled right there. &gt;&gt; And that's good. We want people to be saved. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with people getting saved, &gt;&gt; but we know better. &gt;&gt; We know better than just to set on it. We've been taught. &gt;&gt; You might as well be an empty box. In fact, you're better off being an empty box &gt;&gt; than to know the truth and not move forward. &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, just because he's called you and you've accepted him and you say, "Okay, I want to move forward &gt;&gt; now. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; That's the thing about a gift. A pardon is only a pardon when received as a pardon. &gt;&gt; Now, like I said, brother Josiah would go for the cars before he'd go for the filter. Maybe not anymore. You might think eBay. And that's fine. If he can use the cars more than he can use the filter, I'd rather see him play with the cars than just throw that in the back. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's a stainless steel filter. You might get a dollar at at the scrapyard, &gt;&gt; maybe. &gt;&gt; Do you see how devalued it can become? So that gift in in in the ministry, in in in singing, in any of those things, if we're not careful, we can devalue them and put them aside. &gt;&gt; We can say, "Well, that's that's nice." And a lot of times we do that to ourselves, our own gifts. We devalue our gift because we're not in front of people. Trust me, I I would rather be right back there than up here. &gt;&gt; But this is what I've been given. &gt;&gt; And some of you have been given a gift and you've devalued it and said, "Well, the people don't appreciate it. &gt;&gt; Or the people are getting tired of it &gt;&gt; or the people don't want to hear me sing because they've heard me so much. Uh &gt;&gt; oh. &gt;&gt; The Lord's been convicting me about something. I'm just going to open up this. Here I am. Brother John. I have been approached and this is the way that I guess this is this is lingo preacher lingo which I'm too dumb to recognize it I guess but by pastors or people with churches brother why don't you come down and visit us okay I don't see myself in Georgia anytime soon. I ain't lost nothing there, right? [snorts] I'm sure it's nice there or, you know, wherever it might be. Well, I learned that's the way that they communicate. Say, "Hey, come down and preach for me sometime." So, that was what I heard years ago. Well, I've heard it more recently. Won't you come down and visit us sometime? And I just look at him and say, "Brother, I ain't looking for a place to preach. I'm not going to call you up and say, "Hey, I'm in the neighborhood." You got to you got something for me to do. Now, if that's what God's called you to do and how you called to do it, that's that's one thing. It's it's different from a missionary. It's different. It's it's it's according to your call. It's according to your thing. That's okay. I'm not speaking against it, but that that's not that's not me. But saying it the way I said it, not very nice. Cuz again, brother John here, is brother John out there, and brother John here? I'm just plain plain talk is never misunderstood. But there's approach to it. There's a better way. Now, I have a gift and some people can can appreciate it. It's not for everybody. I might be like that filter. I might catch one. That's fine. &gt;&gt; I ain't looking to be something. I'm not looking to do something. &gt;&gt; But if he wants to use me, &gt;&gt; then okay. &gt;&gt; And a lot of times that's what this the singers are doing. That's what that's what people that that are in the church that are that they've got a gift and God's called them to do something. They want them to do something, but they're too humble for their own good or too um don't want to put themselves out there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just being honest. But God has put that gift in your life for a reason. Whatever it may be, not everybody's a preacher. Not everybody gets up here and sings. Thank you, Lord. That's okay. Don't be a singer if you're not a singer. do it in the shower. That's fine. &gt;&gt; There's I I you know, and and people laugh and they think it's funny, but but seriously, God God wants you to be in your place doing what you're called to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so if that gift is in you to do that, he wants it to operate. &gt;&gt; There's a reason. Now, I told you I'm not looking for anywhere to preach, but if you invite me, I'll go. I got no pre problem with that. I just need to approach it a little different, I think, the way I the way I say it. &gt;&gt; But I if people are asking you to sing, it's because you bless them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if you bless them, you might be like this filter. They might be the only one in the whole church that gets blessed by it. &gt;&gt; But if one soul is worth 10,000 worlds, &gt;&gt; that's simple. I know. I know. He says, "Now remember you just accepted Christ." See, now God will give you the Holy Ghost in in confirmation of your faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, so he kind of squashes that whole idea that you say you're saved, you get the Holy Ghost. He says he'll give you the Holy Ghost in confirmation of your faith. &gt;&gt; But it's still a gift, &gt;&gt; right? We read it's a gift, &gt;&gt; we don't have to work for it. And every one of us has that gift inside of us. That's the gift. The Holy Ghost is the gift. Brother Brandham was the man, the box that the gift worked through. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus Christ, Brother Brandham said, he was nothing to behold. He wasn't a good-looking feller, &gt;&gt; but he was a box. that God could get inside and use. &gt;&gt; It was a shell. Give you the Holy Ghost and confirmation of your faith. See, now you get some full gospel church and be baptized right away. [sighs] Oh &gt;&gt; yeah. So he's giving you a prescription, something that you have to do. &gt;&gt; It's not sit on the pew in a message church and you're great. &gt;&gt; You have to get the the gift of the Holy Ghost. He's given you a gift. When you sit in here, you're well aware of what the gift is. But if you sit on your pew and you don't move towards that gift and you don't do the things you've got to do to get that gift, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Then shame on you. get baptized right away. And God's under obligation. Obligation. &gt;&gt; He's under obligation. That means he has to. Another thing that I I I find a I kind of maybe need to ease up on is somebody asked me to do, you know, or I'll say, hey, if you need anything, let me know. And then I find out, well, I didn't want to ask you. &gt;&gt; Did you think I was lying to you? Is that my reputation? &gt;&gt; I've I've straight told somebody, "Well, you think I'm lying?" &gt;&gt; Again, I need to be a little softer, maybe. &gt;&gt; But I don't I don't lie. If I tell you, if you need something, if it's in my power, I I'll do it for you. &gt;&gt; And when I say that, when I put myself out there, if they need something and I can do it, then I'm under obligation to do it. &gt;&gt; Don't say it if you don't mean it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be Christlike, right? &gt;&gt; And he's under obligation to give us the Holy Ghost if we follow the prescription. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Repent, be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift. &gt;&gt; And once that empty box gets full of the gift, then it's time to see where that gift fits in the body. Maybe it's behind an organ blessing the people &gt;&gt; or maybe it's in a pew praying &gt;&gt; but it's the gift all the same. &gt;&gt; It's not so far-fetched as it's still the gift. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's valuable to one person or another. God doesn't just give out gifts just to give out gifts. It's for a purpose in the church. &gt;&gt; He's under obligation to give you the Holy Ghost. Why? Because he wants that gift operating in the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it might be behind a pulpit or behind an organ or in a pew, but it's still the gift. &gt;&gt; And you got to have the gift in order for God to be able to use it. &gt;&gt; That's what we're looking for is is yes, we're a box. &gt;&gt; Gifts and callings are without repentance, &gt;&gt; right? So what that means is everybody has something that they're good at. Everybody. &gt;&gt; Now it takes some people a long time to find out what they're good at. &gt;&gt; That's okay. &gt;&gt; But if you get the Holy Ghost, then he can operate through that gift. The gift operates the gift. &gt;&gt; God's under obligation to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost the moment the moment you're baptized. Brother John, I've been baptized 14 times. And I don't think I have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now God's going to be blunt. &gt;&gt; Do you think I'm a liar? &gt;&gt; Oh, if you don't have it, he's under obligation. Is that right? He's under obligation to give it to you. &gt;&gt; And if you don't feel like you got it, then you didn't follow the prescription right. You haven't repented for everything. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; It's not a complicated situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's under obligation to give you the gift of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And we spend so much time the go the devil's got us in our mind &gt;&gt; in our mind over and over again. Oh, you made that mistake. You ain't got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He never said the box would be perfect. He said he would fill the box &gt;&gt; with the gift to use the gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. And &gt;&gt; that gift is what operates through you to bless his church, to bless his people. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is for. &gt;&gt; We're, and I've spoke on this before, God is an object of worship. He wants us to worship, &gt;&gt; right? If he's an object of worship and he wants us to worship, who's getting the blessing? Well, brother Josiah could say, "I was blessed." Ah, [snorts] but it was his gift that was blessed. That Holy Ghost inside of him was blessed &gt;&gt; through the gift. Do you understand what I'm saying? It goes right back around. It's full circle. God is an object of worship. He gives us a gift to bless the church. &gt;&gt; Who's the church? The boxes. &gt;&gt; What do the boxes have in them? The Holy Ghost. So that's how Brother Harry's gift can bless my gift. &gt;&gt; And he's doing it the right way because I get blessed because the gift inside of me is him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; What? Say, "Brother John, you're really confusing me here." You got the Holy Ghost, right? If you got the Holy Ghost and I've got the Holy Ghost, God's an object of worship, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost is God, &gt;&gt; right? [snorts] So God will use God to bless God. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Ain't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; So when we pull back our gift, then God can't use our gift to bless God &gt;&gt; also you. We get the benefits of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets on our flesh. &gt;&gt; That's okay. That's okay. It's okay to have the Holy Ghost on our flesh. That's what makes us jump and shout and turn about and all that stuff. That's wonderful. It's it's it's awesome to feel that. &gt;&gt; But the prophet also say, don't don't jump higher than you live. But if you got the gift and it's getting blessed, you're going to jump just the right amount. &gt;&gt; To give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost the moment you're baptized, if you come with a true heart believing, Peter said, just repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Is that right? God promised it now. He'd make everything right. &gt;&gt; God's not a liar. &gt;&gt; So many people I know have been seeking after the Holy Ghost. Seeking after the Holy Ghost. Seeking after the Holy Ghost. And you know what keeps the Holy Ghost away? &gt;&gt; Doubt &gt;&gt; and fear. That's true. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost cannot dwell amongst those things. &gt;&gt; So if the devil can get you to doubt, you repent. You've been baptized with in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You've been you repented of all your sins for the remission of your for the remission of your sins. And then the devil swoops in and says, "Oh boy, did you really repent? Cuz man, that box really looks messed up. you really made some stupid mistakes. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're right. And then the Holy Ghost flutters off. &gt;&gt; It's not that he didn't fulfill his promise, but it can't dwell in doubt and fear. &gt;&gt; This is this is message. I'm not preaching anything way outside. This is but but we've got our minds so so twisted around with with traditions and and and things that we've got and we we settle down and we think we ah I got to work it up. I got to work it out. But am I am I right in saying that that the Holy Ghost can't dwell with doubt and fear? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So it's not that you didn't get the Holy Ghost. It's that you the devil got in your head and he's pushed off. now. Boy, I meant to mark time. I always forget that. I think a lot of preachers do that. forget to look up at the clock because I get but I won't hold you too much longer. Like I said, I got at least 100 parts of this. Brother Bram says and that was that that last quote was God's provided way. This is this is question and answers in I think 50 54. Does this church teach you that you have to speak in tongues to receive the Holy Ghost? Now, we've been taught well enough to know that in the message we don't believe that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm afraid that there's some other things &gt;&gt; that aren't clear in this message. Not because it's not taught or not because it's not in the message, but it's a lot of carryover from other things, traditions, doubts, fear. The devil tells us all kinds of crazy stuff. So, I could change that that question into does this church believe that you got to be perfect to have the Holy Ghost? Does this church believe that you got to be stoic in the pews or run and shout or be a part of this church or this group? &gt;&gt; We're we're well we're well verssed here. This is we're not lacking teaching in this way at this church. Thank God. But we'll run across people in this message that have confusion surrounding this. &gt;&gt; I don't have the Holy Ghost because just fill in the blank. &gt;&gt; No sir, we don't. Speaking in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost. It's a gift of the Holy Ghost. So we look to the nine spiritual gifts of the Holy Ghost. That's the gift of the Holy Ghost and that's the way it it can operate. Now we're also taught that it just just because it's a gift of the Holy Ghost if it's not a sign. It's like healing or anything else. It's it's an operation of the gift. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? It's an operation of the gift inside of you. &gt;&gt; Now, just like singers, some people can write beautiful songs, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't carry a tune in a lard bucket. &gt;&gt; That means that their gift is writing songs. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes that gift marries up with somebody who can sing. But the same thing happens it it applies in in in in your life with each individual gift. Now my gift might be behind the pull pit and I might also have speaking in tonesues but it doesn't mean that with speaking in tonesues I get interpretation of tongues. doesn't mean all that. &gt;&gt; And that's where having the Holy Ghost and not being this you operating that gift. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; He wants it automatic. He wants you to pull back just a little bit &gt;&gt; and let him move you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever capacity it is, &gt;&gt; we've all heard brother Donnie say he's got a missionary's heart, &gt;&gt; but not the stomach, right? [laughter] He has a hard time eating over there. That's okay. That's okay. You might have a certain thing that the the Holy Ghost can operate through. I know this is not we're we're going slow, but you all are paying attention. It's good. God is going to use you how he wants to use you. Don't get get discouraged because your Holy Ghost is not operating like mine. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you don't have the Holy Ghost. And so that's one of the tricks of the devil is he he wants us to look at at somebody else, [snorts] &gt;&gt; but that somebody else is maybe looking at you, &gt;&gt; the deacons have a special gift. &gt;&gt; It's a special gift. They can deal with problems &gt;&gt; and know some pretty nasty stuff that goes on in the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And treat you or treat that person &gt;&gt; like nothing ever happened. &gt;&gt; That's a gift. Now, just because brother Keith doesn't have that gift doesn't make him any less of a Christian or make his Holy Ghost any less of him. &gt;&gt; You'd think, well, the the Holy Ghost, yeah, that'll cover all that. No, we still got our humanity. &gt;&gt; That's part of it. says, "Now you can speak with tongues and still not have the Holy Ghost." Now, just remember that I've seen witches and wizards come up speaking in tongues. They ain't got no Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you know. I've seen them come up shouting and jumping. And they ain't got a Holy Ghost. I've seen a corn dance here not long ago out up in a little piece of Douglas, Arizona up there and seen a corn dance when they have have it up there and the wizard come out and they carried on terrible and everything and carried and throw dirt over o over him there and that didn't mean he was saved. The man was a witch doctor. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's stop at the witch doctor. That's easy to see. I ain't got that twins. We know that the message twins right here in this church &gt;&gt; come to church to pay their ti and do the right things. Ain't going to got a bit more of the gift than anything. &gt;&gt; A scary place to be. &gt;&gt; But that's the thing about our gift. as we can treat them the same. We can love them the same. &gt;&gt; But our gift will also say you better be careful. &gt;&gt; That's tight. I know that's that's uncomfortable. That makes us uncomfortable because we don't want to think that about anybody. &gt;&gt; We don't. Which is good. We don't want to think that that way about anybody. &gt;&gt; But that's part of your gift. We've had people not behind this pullpit as far as I know, but at at Happy Valley, we had had ministers up there could preach like a house on fire, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Run out on their wives. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Out selling whiskey now. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's truth. &gt;&gt; Brother Dickinson used to say, "The truth will stand when the world's on fire." It's the truth. &gt;&gt; Does that mean that Brother Donny's gift didn't catch it? Maybe that wasn't what Maybe God wanted to use that right there. &gt;&gt; Don't listen. Brother Donniey's gift at at all as a pastor. &gt;&gt; He's very protective of of his sheep and always has been. &gt;&gt; I'll skip down. If a genuine Holy Ghost person is born of the Holy Spirit of God, he'll live a godly life. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Some of them was just living horrible lives, you know. And you just you know that their fruits prove that they wasn't. Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them. And the fruit of the spirit is not speaking in tongues or fill in the blank. That's the gift of the spirit. Huh? [sighs] You can fake it for a long time but it's going to come out. You can be filled with a lot of stuff other than God, but it's going to come out. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit, not one of those ministers has impacted my walk in a negative way. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; I hate that they're gone. I hate that they backslid. But I'm not putting away every other minister. Why? Because I'm not looking at the gift &gt;&gt; or or the the the man. I'm looking at the gift behind the man. &gt;&gt; Now we we sing uh greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that means that what's inside of us, if we trust it, if we pull back a little bit and just let him have us, he'll lead us and guide us into all truths. That's scripture. &gt;&gt; All truths. &gt;&gt; He'll let us know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The problem is is people get so attached to to the box, a certain box, that when it it gets exposed or or tore open, they just want to throw up their hands and say, "Well, I guess I guess that's it. I I guess God don't use ministers anymore. I want to turn to Numbers chapter 21. I got a little bit more little bit more time. Verse four. [snorts] And they journeyed from Mount by the way of the Red Sea to come past the land of Edom. And the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. And the people spake against God and against Moses. Ah. Uh-oh. That was God's. Now, he didn't have the Holy Ghost, but but he was the box that God was using. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is for no bread, neither is there any water. Our soul loaith, and our soul loaith this bread. So here they are. God's delivered them. They've accepted salvation. And the Lord said sent sent fiery serpents among the people and they did they bit the people and much people of Israel died. So here they are complaining, whining because God's gift pulled them out of Egypt and said, "I'm going to have to sort some of y'all out. &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to get rid of some of this this baggage." &gt;&gt; God don't like complainers. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's there's there's a way that I look at things and and maybe I'm crazy, &gt;&gt; but I do my best. And I'm not saying I'm by no means am perfect. Obviously, I have to look at it for a reason. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What good is complaining doing? I know as somebody who works with customers that the first time they complain, I'm like, "Okay, let me look into that." the second time they complain. Okay. But if they are consistent complainers, I had a lady tell me, "None of this equipment works." And I'm like, "Well, how are you doing surgeries?" So when she calls, I'm like, "Here we go." After a while, you're complaining does no good. Now, there's a difference between complaining and requesting. &gt;&gt; Complaints get blown way out of proportion. 99% of the time, they just get blown way out of comp proportion. Is way more than what it is. But requesting, they say, "I need this. Can you help me?" Oh, why certainly? Let me bend over backwards for you. Because complaining just annoys. And I got a little God in me. And if it annoys me, probably annoys him, too. &gt;&gt; Complaining does no good, right? So I put that in the negative category. &gt;&gt; Worrying. When has worrying any ever accomplished anything? &gt;&gt; I take it back. Brother Bram says it accomplishes cancer. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; sorry. &gt;&gt; Forgot about that one. &gt;&gt; It does you no good to worry. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God wants us to pull back and let go. &gt;&gt; Worrying doesn't accomplish anything. &gt;&gt; So that goes in the negative category. &gt;&gt; Do you understand where this is going? Fighting, arguing, yelling. Oh, those are that's that's me. [sighs] That's another sermon. But it goes in the negative category. It doesn't accomplish much. &gt;&gt; When was the last time you argued with somebody and changed their mind? &gt;&gt; Oh, you changed it from upset to angry. &gt;&gt; That's all you accomplish. Right. &gt;&gt; And arguing is a sign of pride. &gt;&gt; That goes in the negative category, too. &gt;&gt; Again, we got to get away from that that part. I ain't got time. And the Lord sent fiery servants among the people, and they bit the people, and much people of Israel died. So here, this is what they've accomplished. They've irritated God &gt;&gt; and he sent serpents among them. &gt;&gt; What was God's solution? Moses, form a hunting party. I want you to get a bunch of spears and we're going to go out and we're just going to kill these serpents. Nope. That's not what he chose to use. &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole, and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, when he lookth upon it, shall live. H &gt;&gt; would you say that that fiery serpent on a pole was a gift? I would say it was a gift. An inadimate object. What happened to that serpent years ago &gt;&gt; or years later? They had to destroy it because they made it an idol. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; But in its season, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It was God's way of delivering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was a gift of God, an inanimate object that at one time was very relevant and very useful. And God said, "This is how I'm going to deliver you from these fiery serpents. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, oh Lord, you're going to get me in trouble. Sure as the world. Brother Brandham was not an inadimate object. I'm not saying that at all. But I want you to understand that he was used and his ministry was used. You guys are tight right now. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; But look at what has happened &gt;&gt; with brother Brandham with the wrong people. &gt;&gt; Why is that? &gt;&gt; Why is that? God's gift to the people. William Brham was used and it it to to those of us that have it in the right place is still used. &gt;&gt; His ministry. We're not counting on brother Brandham to show up &gt;&gt; for that gift. &gt;&gt; There are people that do. &gt;&gt; Now, how crazy is that? &gt;&gt; You might as well pull out the brass serpent. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? So that gift, what God has called and used and and it's it can be so twisted and warped and the devil wants to take something pure and holy and good. That gift that God put on the earth, he wants to to take it and twist it out of context and put you in sin. Right. &gt;&gt; The brass serpent had to be destroyed because they took something that God used, &gt;&gt; a gift of God to heal the people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And they started worshiping it. &gt;&gt; Does it lessen the gift? No. It was of God. Now understand that you can do that to any gift of God. The devil would love That's right. &gt;&gt; to take a true gift of God cuz what does that do? What does it do when he takes something a gift that God has given us and he could twist it around and make it an idol or twist it around and make it something that it's not supposed to be? If the devil can do that, then what does it do when people look in on it? They call us crazy. Do we see where we're at in this in in in amongst the message? Not in the message. The not in the message. &gt;&gt; But many of our are the people that we fellowship for years. That's right. They've taken that gift of brother Brandham who we love and respect and we keep him in his place. Now &gt;&gt; you can do that to brother Donnie Reagan. &gt;&gt; I talked to Okay. The green one. Okay. So, the devil wants to do that with with each one of us as well. The gift inside of us. Now, this is where it's going to I'm going to stop because we got school, but this is where I could go way off. Not off the word, but on another whole sermon is what I'm saying, part two. Daddies, to be a gift, you you've been called to be a dad. If you're a dad, you've been called to be a mom. If you're a mom, you've been called to be a son. If you're a son, if you got the Holy Ghost, that gift inside of you is going to manifest those things. &gt;&gt; But that office can be contorted and twisted. &gt;&gt; Whatever office that you're in, And it can become a stumbling block. How many children do we know that are messed up because of their daddy &gt;&gt; or their mommy? That's a godly office. That's the right thing. &gt;&gt; They're in that place. Maybe that's what God that's the gift they that that God put inside that box. You are to be a mommy. A godly mommy. Okay, I got to stop. I'm just going to stop. Brothers and sisters, let's make sure brothers come because let's make sure that were this kind of gift. I've said it before, my biggest regrets are when I try and fix things. When I try and do it, &gt;&gt; when I run out ahead of God. Oh my. &gt;&gt; We're coming to the place, brothers and sisters, where God wants us to pull ourselves back and just let it go. &gt;&gt; How do you think the rapture is going to happen? &gt;&gt; You going to work it up? You going to make the h the rapture happen? &gt;&gt; Well, I wish you would hurry up. What's going to make that rapture happen? The Holy Ghost inside of each one of us. &gt;&gt; That gift that God put inside this box is going to make it. That's what's going to change our bodies. &gt;&gt; That's what's going to make it happen. I got a quote here, brother Brandon, and I know you've heard it, but he says, "When you get off the word and you break his law and you break his word, you got to shift for yourself." &gt;&gt; You got to shift. You got to do it yourself. The Holy Ghost goes off. How many of you don't raise your hand? Please don't raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Think you're better at God than being God than God is? Brother, no. Brother Harry, I mean, the gift you got is is awesome. &gt;&gt; You mean you don't think you could take God's place? No, sir. Maybe you could make the rapture happen. &gt;&gt; I wish I could. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. He wishes he could. I wish I could. We just make it happen, right? &gt;&gt; You know how we make it happen? Pull back and let go. &gt;&gt; Trust him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Trust him. I don't care what you're going through. I don't care how hard life gets. I don't care how what your nature is. If if you're a worrier, the gift inside of you, the gift inside of me is longing to go home. How are we going to go home? pulling back and letting go. &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought right up here. &gt;&gt; Doubt, fear, right up here. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost can't operate in those conditions. &gt;&gt; He won't operate in those conditions. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we we truly truly love you, Lord. And we thank you, Father, for your word and this truth that you've given us. We thank you, Lord Jesus, for Lord, sometimes it doesn't come out like we think. Lord, I I probably preached this sermon 500 times, but Lord, truly I I feel like I let go. And I'm praying that you would just help put this together. Father, it wasn't a very fiery sermon or something with a lot of preaching preaching, Lord. But I just trust you and I believe you, Lord. Pray that you would have your way, Lord Jesus. Maybe this will be something that they they can ruminate on the next couple days, Lord, and it'll hit them. [snorts] Father, I truly my desire Lord Jesus is that I would be able to let go and let God. I pray that you would help each and every one here. May these things become manifest in our lives. Lord, we love you and we thank you. Father, I pray you just be with each one. Jesus name. We saying I surrender all. How many wants to surrender? Say that Lord, this gift that you put inside of me, this Holy Ghost gift that you placed inside of me, I'm pulling my flesh back and I'm letting you drive this thing. You're going to drive me right into the rapture. &gt;&gt; I'm letting go and letting God Oh, all to Jesus I surrender all to thee. I freely give.
