[41:39] just asking you that you'd be mindful of
[41:41] each of them Lord we know the darkness
[41:44] is pressing against us so much in the
[41:47] age that we're living it's hard to
[41:49] imagine father that we are still here
[41:52] and we're at the end of 23 and going
[41:55] into 24 for in a few days most of us
[41:58] never thought we would ever be here this
[42:01] long but we're praying however long we

[42:16] we're saying Satan you better look out
[42:18] cuz here we come but father we need your
[42:21] anointing your strength your presence to
[42:23] help us so we pray that you'd be mindful
[42:25] of it tonight brother James going to
[42:27] come and speak to us we pray Lord that
[42:29] you just anoint him help him to be able
[42:32] to move out of the way father may we

[42:55] brother
[43:00] praise the Lord happy to be in the house
[43:02] of the
[43:03] Lord it's certainly an honor and
[43:05] privilege to be here and to be gathered
[43:07] in the house and we thank for the Donnie
[43:10] for this opportunity uh certainly it
[43:12] came at a surprise like you said but
[43:16] that's what we're here for to help with
[43:19] brother Donnie you know you see the
[43:21] things that he's going through and we
[43:23] see what the family has been through and
[43:25] we just to whatever way we can and we
[43:27] certainly ask that the Lord be mindful
[43:30] of us tonight that he would Minister the
[43:31] word that the word would go forth and it
[43:33] would have an effect in our lives if you
[43:35] have your
[43:37] Bibles we certainly want to bring
[43:39] greetings from brother Ron Peterson in
[43:41] the church there in Phoenix and as
[43:43] brother Donnie said my wife Allison is
[43:46] around here somewhere with my two boys
[43:48] Dean and Nolan somewhere in the marriage
[43:51] contract in the fine lines that had I
[43:53] move rout West and I bring her home for
[43:56] the holidays but you know this is
[43:58] certainly a a special place and it's a
[44:01] home away from home we have a lot of
[44:02] family friends here and we just trust
[44:05] that we can say something that would be
[44:07] a blessing to
[44:08] you if you have your Bibles we can turn
[44:10] to 2
[44:11] Corinthians chapter
[44:17] 4 second Corinthians chapter
[44:21] 4 verse
[44:25] 8 it says we are troubled on every side
[44:28] yet not distressed we are perplexed but
[44:31] not in
[44:32] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[44:36] down but not
[44:37] destroyed always always bearing about
[44:40] the body of the ding of the Lord Jesus
[44:42] that the life of Jesus might be made
[44:44] manifest in our bodies let's skip down
[44:46] to verse 16 for this cause we thank not
[44:50] but though our outward man perish yet
[44:52] the inward man is renewed day by day
[44:56] how many's thankful that you can be
[44:57] renewed day by day his mercy and his
[45:00] grace are renewed every
[45:03] day in verse 18 while we look not at the
[45:06] things which are seen But at the things
[45:09] which are not seen for the things which
[45:11] are seen are temporal but the things
[45:14] which are not seen are Eternal if you
[45:16] can turn over to Ephesians
[45:19] 5 Ephesians 5 and verse1
[45:24] 15
[45:30] Ephesians 5:15 it says seeing then that
[45:32] you walk circumspectly meaning live
[45:34] carefully morally cautiously not as
[45:37] fools but as wise Redeeming the time
[45:40] because the days are evil wherefore you
[45:42] walk not unwise but understanding the
[45:45] what the will of the Lord
[45:47] is if we could just bow our heads for a
[45:52] moment Heavenly Father we've come to the
[45:55] portion of of the preaching of the word
[45:57] Lord Lord songs have been sung and
[46:01] atmosphere has been set but Lord we're
[46:03] asking for your divine presence to come
[46:05] and to minister to your hearts of the
[46:07] people father May the word go forth and
[46:09] have an effect may it just not be words
[46:11] that they hear from me and they walk out
[46:13] and say it was good to be in church and
[46:15] it sounded good and but Lord may it be a
[46:18] a word that would fall into the ground
[46:20] of our hearts that it would go down into
[46:22] the very Souls that father we can say
[46:24] from this day forward something was
[46:26] spoken that it changed my life that
[46:28] something there was said that father we
[46:31] can walk away a different people because
[46:33] when we come in contact with you that's
[46:35] when you Lord you change our lives you
[46:38] you make us different and we're just
[46:40] asking once again for your presence to
[46:42] come and father take this vessel and
[46:44] move it aside Lord you take everything
[46:47] under your control For Your Glory we're
[46:49] just asking that you would have your way
[46:50] in this service Lord we commit it in thy
[46:53] hands in Jesus precious name amen and
[46:56] amen you can be
[46:59] seated as I said we certainly want to
[47:01] thank brother Donnie for the
[47:10] opportunity now the Bible says let us
[47:12] redeem the time and that's why we've
[47:14] gathered on a Wednesday night you know
[47:17] to the majority of
[47:18] people Christmas is over they've come to
[47:22] church and the next time they'll Grace
[47:24] the doors is on Easter right to them
[47:26] it's just a religion to them they know
[47:29] Christ is an event in history you see
[47:32] and so but we have a great opportunity
[47:34] that we can gather in the house of God
[47:36] on a Wednesday night we can come and we
[47:38] can give him praise we can give him
[47:40] admiration we can thank him for his
[47:42] goodness his Mercy we can give him
[47:44] praise and tell him how much we love him
[47:46] what he's done for us what he means to
[47:48] us what a great opportunity it is that's
[47:51] why the Bible says let us redeem the
[47:54] time what an evil time that we're living
[47:56] in people don't know who they are what
[47:59] gender they
[48:00] are it's an identity Christ is out in
[48:03] the world but I'm so thankful that we
[48:05] have an opportunity to come into the
[48:07] house of God and to hear the word to
[48:09] hear the word go forth and it can have
[48:11] an effect in our lives and I begin to
[48:14] think that that great Eternal God who
[48:17] had no beginning had no
[48:19] end an all knowing god omnipresent
[48:22] omnipotent and he became he came down
[48:24] and created this form of time and within
[48:28] time this space of time he would begin
[48:30] to deal with his people but yet in time
[48:34] he created
[48:35] moments now moments is what makes God
[48:38] personal to you moments are times that
[48:41] God comes down and he reveals himself to
[48:43] you moments are times that he comes and
[48:46] He makes himself known when you're sick
[48:49] and Afflicted he comes down as a Healer
[48:51] right when you don't know who you are he
[48:53] might come down and he might deliver you
[48:55] right when you need a savior he'll come
[48:57] down and he'll deliver you but yet in
[49:00] those moments it what makes God personal
[49:02] to you and to lay a
[49:05] foundation here in brother brandham says
[49:07] and S we'd see Jesus he says now we get
[49:09] ourselves worked up in this human
[49:11] element of time and a time element He
[49:14] says the only thing that we know is
[49:16] inches feet yards miles measures days
[49:19] weeks hours and months but God is
[49:21] eternal we have a limited power and
[49:25] limited intelligence you see on the day
[49:27] of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came
[49:29] down it was the earnest of their
[49:31] inheritance it's the earnest so we have
[49:34] a limited power and a limited in in
[49:37] intelligence but yet God that he isn't
[49:40] just going to leave us with that limited
[49:42] power thank you Lord it's just the
[49:45] earnest but he says but God is infinite
[49:47] and all knowing he knows all things he
[49:50] knew all things before the world began
[49:53] he knew this meeting would be here
[49:54] tonight he knew knew all things would be
[49:56] before the world began and he could tell
[49:59] what the the end of time from the
[50:01] beginning that makes him God nothing
[50:03] else no one else no other being no other
[50:06] person could ever do that but God alone
[50:10] so let me ask you what concerns you
[50:12] tonight what problems do we have what
[50:15] sickness do we have that God can't
[50:17] answer amen what situation in our lives
[50:20] that God isn't there to see us
[50:22] through he's an everpresent help in the
[50:25] time of
[50:27] needen but yet as us as human beings we
[50:31] begin to look at the temporal
[50:33] things these things brother random would
[50:36] talk about our five
[50:38] senses we begin to let allow our senses
[50:41] to control the things around us the
[50:44] circumstances around us but can I say
[50:46] the circumstance that you're going
[50:48] through through is not you are not
[50:49] defined by that
[50:51] circumstance you are not defined by that
[50:54] situation that that problem that you
[50:56] have that trial that you have you are
[50:58] not defined by that
[51:01] circumstance amen thank you Lord and so
[51:05] tonight if I can just uh take a thought
[51:08] it would be the difference of a moment
[51:11] the difference of a moment and for a a
[51:13] subject we'd like to TI title it from
[51:16] that
[51:17] time and so brother brandham says here
[51:20] that we have these this human element
[51:23] and a time element
[51:26] now we have this human human element
[51:28] that we're all made up of nobody's
[51:30] exempt do we have any Angels amongst
[51:32] us No Angels so we can all set our Halos
[51:36] under our chairs for this service and we
[51:39] can talk because we all are made up of
[51:41] this flesh we came into this world born
[51:44] in flesh born in sin and iniquity came
[51:47] in this world speaking lies and as long
[51:50] as we're in this flesh we'll have a
[51:51] sticky nature and this sticky nature
[51:54] will be with us until the the changing
[51:56] of our bodies so what we have to do is
[51:59] we have to bring this flesh man this
[52:01] human element into subjection to the
[52:04] word of
[52:05] God we have to bring it into subjection
[52:08] to the word of God our thoughts have to
[52:11] come into subjection to the word of God
[52:14] everything we do has to come into
[52:16] subjection to the word of God as we read
[52:19] that our inward man is renewed day in
[52:23] and day out every day
[52:25] we must renew that Inward
[52:28] manen and the other element that we are
[52:30] trapped in is this time element we're
[52:33] creatures of time each one of us we can
[52:35] show our true colors when we come to
[52:38] church some of us are early some of us
[52:40] are on time and some of us are late it
[52:43] never fails We're All Creatures of time
[52:46] our schedules are made up of time we
[52:49] look in the past and our human element
[52:52] would tell us that the past is the
[52:53] history we can read our Bible Bibles and
[52:55] see what God has done in the past we can
[52:58] read of stories how God moved for others
[53:00] down through time and we can read in our
[53:03] Bibles in Revelations and you can see
[53:05] what God is going to do you can see the
[53:07] prophecies that are being fulfilled in
[53:09] our day or have been
[53:11] fulfill amen you see these things are
[53:14] elements of
[53:15] time in the future element we can read
[53:18] and Revelations of what God is going to
[53:21] do but yeah brother Brandon would tell
[53:23] us that we have to be careful to not
[53:25] remember be get caught up in the things
[53:28] of our
[53:29] pasttime and look into what God is doing
[53:32] and missing the very thing that God is
[53:33] doing in our
[53:35] midst because that's the moment that God
[53:38] is trying to make his time personal to
[53:42] you you see because that moment and what
[53:45] you do in that moment as the individual
[53:48] could alter your
[53:50] course the opportunities that God
[53:52] presents to you in that moment can alter
[53:55] the course of your
[53:56] walk is many times in our
[54:00] lives we go about life and we get caught
[54:03] up in a
[54:05] routine doing the same things over and
[54:07] over and you know sometimes God comes by
[54:11] and he ministers to our hearts and he
[54:13] and he wraps his arms of compassion
[54:15] around us sometimes we we get low and we
[54:17] get tired and sometimes he feels like
[54:19] he's right next door and he's right with
[54:21] you and he wraps his arms and you're so
[54:23] tenderhearted and you're so loving and
[54:25] compassionate you have love for your
[54:27] brother and then there sometimes he
[54:29] pulls himself
[54:31] back he pulls himself
[54:34] back and he wants to see where you're at
[54:37] sometimes it feels like you're walking
[54:39] all alone yeah as a story would tell us
[54:41] the one set of footprints on the
[54:44] sand but yet it's God carrying
[54:48] us he doesn't love us any different
[54:52] amen and so this time element
[54:56] there's a saying that time will
[54:59] tell time is the greatest revealer of
[55:03] things you give something time time will
[55:06] tell I've had a lot of friends grew up
[55:09] in the message my entire life and I had
[55:12] a lot of friends you know they they get
[55:13] on fire for God and they get filled they
[55:15] say they get filled and have an
[55:17] experience with
[55:18] God but yet time will tell your life
[55:22] will manifest of the experience that you
[55:25] say you got if you say you got the holy
[55:27] ghost that time will tell if that Holy
[55:30] Ghost is there or not time will tell you
[55:33] see because whenever the Holy Ghost
[55:35] comes inside you it's a new birth it's a
[55:36] changing of your body it's the changing
[55:39] the way you think the way you talk the
[55:41] way you act you see when Jacob wrestled
[55:45] with the angel he walked different how
[55:47] did people know that he had an encounter
[55:49] with God because he walked different
[55:51] from that time
[55:53] on and so we realize that when you come
[55:56] and encounter with God and you wrestle
[55:59] with an angel you'll walk different
[56:01] you'll talk different and time is a
[56:03] great revealer of that yes sir you see
[56:06] nowadays everybody's a
[56:08] Christian everybody some form every
[56:11] especially out here in the
[56:13] South some form of
[56:17] Christianity but yet you see what
[56:19] they've done is they have some form of
[56:21] it and they've joined some religion why
[56:23] because they take and they hybrid the
[56:25] word of God they take the word of God
[56:27] and they take things that they don't
[56:28] agree with or things that they don't see
[56:30] just right or they don't suit it doesn't
[56:32] suit their lifestyle or things they want
[56:34] to live and how they want to live and
[56:36] they they live that way and they call
[56:38] themselves Christians sir because they
[56:40] want the name of
[56:42] Christ you see many times we you know
[56:46] you look out in the world and some
[56:48] tragedy
[56:49] happens something happens maybe it's a
[56:53] mass
[56:53] shooting the family gets in an accident
[56:56] whatever it may be what is the first
[56:58] thing they say what is the first thing
[56:59] they post pray let's pray let's pray
[57:03] they've never said a prayer in their
[57:04] life but let's pray why because they
[57:07] want the name and then they want Christ
[57:09] whenever he's convenient they want
[57:11] Christ in their life when when some
[57:13] things are going wrong when their
[57:14] children are going in the world in the
[57:16] direction that they shouldn't
[57:19] be you see they want Christ when he's
[57:22] convenient but yet they don't want the
[57:24] life of Christ am they don't want the
[57:27] very
[57:29] life and I say tonight give me the very
[57:31] Life of Christ that whenever I walk and
[57:34] I talk and I do the different things
[57:36] that there's something different that
[57:37] you're just not another Christian
[57:39] walking down the road but there's a
[57:41] different life because it's the life
[57:43] behind the name that makes the demons
[57:46] tremble it's the life behind the name
[57:48] that makes the
[57:53] difference everyone one of us as a
[57:55] Believer must have a life to back up
[57:58] that
[58:00] name we're all built around a
[58:03] schedule Monday through Friday we go to
[58:06] work we go to school Wednesdays we come
[58:08] to church Sundays we go to church and it
[58:11] becomes a routine and it becomes
[58:13] sometimes it seasons in our lives that
[58:15] we do the same things day in and day out
[58:17] day in and day out it just becomes the
[58:20] season of life that you're in sometimes
[58:22] it's a sickness in our body and it may
[58:24] raise up and you begin to say it's a
[58:26] season in our life and you know what I'm
[58:28] just going to accept
[58:29] that I'm just going to deal with the
[58:31] problem that I
[58:33] have and we just do it day in and day
[58:36] out but yet that's not who we
[58:40] are amen that's not who we are to just
[58:44] settle and just become conditioned to
[58:47] the ways of life that's right you know
[58:49] back home I was talking with an elder in
[58:51] our church and we begin to talk and he
[58:53] says you know I feel that sometimes we
[58:55] have it too
[58:56] easy are we really looking for the
[58:59] Rapture are we really seeking the mind
[59:01] of God and every day getting up and look
[59:04] getting up with a different expectation
[59:06] different anticipation of what God is
[59:08] going to do maybe there's some sick
[59:10] Afflicted in our midst maybe there's
[59:12] some with a question maybe there's some
[59:15] that haven't aren't living the way they
[59:17] should with Christ do we wake up with a
[59:19] different expectation of what God maybe
[59:22] today is my day amen Maybe today God
[59:25] will meet my need maybe today is
[59:28] something
[59:29] different but yet we wake up as
[59:33] humans and we wake up in this time
[59:35] element we get caught up in
[59:39] routine you know and I was
[59:42] asked do we just accept the season of
[59:45] life that we're
[59:47] in you
[59:49] know some of the younger families can
[59:52] sympathize with me some of the older
[59:55] ones won't because they'll say you'll
[59:57] get through
[59:58] it but you know when you have young kids
[1:00:01] and they're sick they're sick in their
[1:00:03] body and you're up all
[1:00:05] night and you're having to give them
[1:00:07] showers at 2:00 a.m. and and it just
[1:00:09] seems like they're long days and long
[1:00:11] nights and everything and then the
[1:00:13] sickness just keep rising up and you
[1:00:15] don't know what to do and it just
[1:00:16] becomes hard and all these yeah we'll
[1:00:19] get through it but sometimes do we
[1:00:21] forget to pray and seek God and say God
[1:00:24] help us and you pray and you pray and
[1:00:26] you pray and it's not answered so you
[1:00:28] know what I'm just going to give up I'm
[1:00:29] just going to accept the season of life
[1:00:31] that I'm
[1:00:32] in I'm just going to accept this
[1:00:34] sickness I'm going to accept this
[1:00:36] illness because I've prayed and I prayed
[1:00:38] and I prayed we're getting
[1:00:46] somewhere you see but let me ask
[1:00:50] you we're creatures of
[1:00:53] habit we do what feels good what
[1:00:58] works we do what feels good and what
[1:01:03] works but yet I believe that coming to
[1:01:06] the house of God and God began to deal
[1:01:08] with me with this personal to me is that
[1:01:11] sometimes we come to
[1:01:13] church and how many believes that God
[1:01:15] will speak to our
[1:01:17] hearts it's an expectation that we have
[1:01:20] right but yet sometimes we come and we
[1:01:24] just get in the car and we go and we we
[1:01:25] just show up to church and we know God
[1:01:27] is going to speak to our
[1:01:29] hearts but yet we call that
[1:01:33] expectation we call that expectation
[1:01:35] there was no prayer there was no
[1:01:37] anticipation there was no seeking the
[1:01:39] mind of God right for God to come on the
[1:01:41] scene to move in our children's lives to
[1:01:43] move in in any situation that we have
[1:01:47] brother Brandon would speak on
[1:01:48] expectations because whatever you expect
[1:01:50] when you come to the house of God is
[1:01:52] what you're going to get
[1:01:55] so I wonder those that have an illness a
[1:01:58] sickness did you come with a greater
[1:02:01] expectation do you wake up in the
[1:02:02] morning and say God I'm expecting today
[1:02:05] is my day and if it's not today then
[1:02:07] it's going to be tomorrow and if it's
[1:02:09] not tomorrow maybe it's the next day but
[1:02:11] you keep praying and believing because
[1:02:12] that's what believers do is they
[1:02:14] believe and they keep praying and they
[1:02:16] keep asking and they keep seeking the
[1:02:19] mind of God for the will of their
[1:02:23] life
[1:02:28] maybe today is your
[1:02:30] moment how do you know that the next
[1:02:32] prayer that you pray won't be the one
[1:02:34] that breaks
[1:02:37] through how do you know that next prayer
[1:02:39] won't be answered of
[1:02:45] God you begin to think of moments you
[1:02:49] see God doesn't need if we're sick in
[1:02:52] our body or we have an illness back pain
[1:02:54] whatever whatever it may be a heart
[1:02:55] condition God doesn't need hours of
[1:02:57] surgery he doesn't need to come in and
[1:03:00] perform hours of surgery sometimes he
[1:03:01] just needs a moment amen he just needs a
[1:03:04] moment of your time you know sometimes
[1:03:06] for a a backlin Christian one that's a
[1:03:09] wayward son a prodal he doesn't need an
[1:03:12] entire sermon preached at him sometimes
[1:03:14] it's a
[1:03:16] moment sometimes it's just a moment of
[1:03:18] his time that God would pass by his
[1:03:22] way I can see one back there that we
[1:03:25] prayed for and he's family and we prayed
[1:03:28] for it just takes a moment that God
[1:03:31] could walk by and meet you at a Waffle
[1:03:33] House no sermon preach no hands laid on
[1:03:36] just a moment that could change and
[1:03:39] alter his
[1:03:40] life and I can
[1:03:43] say that as Reed he has a special place
[1:03:48] because my wife we would sit there and
[1:03:49] we would pray and we would pray and you
[1:03:52] know he was in our wedding but yet yet
[1:03:54] at the time he wasn't living right he
[1:03:56] wasn't serving God he was doing things
[1:03:58] he
[1:03:58] shouldn't but yet in that time we didn't
[1:04:02] choose him to be in our wedding because
[1:04:05] of the condition he was
[1:04:07] in we didn't choose him because of that
[1:04:09] condition but we chose him because he
[1:04:12] meant something to us and that's what
[1:04:14] God does with some of us he don't choose
[1:04:16] you when you're down in the wall he
[1:04:18] doesn't choose you when you're down in
[1:04:19] the dirt but he chooses you not because
[1:04:22] of what you're in but because what he's
[1:04:25] going to make you because it's by
[1:04:27] predestination it's by election by what
[1:04:30] he's calling you to and he's called us
[1:04:33] to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:04:36] God brother brandom says he's called us
[1:04:38] to be Sons and Daughters of God and if
[1:04:40] we try to be anything else we've missed
[1:04:42] the mark so let's just be Sons and
[1:04:45] Daughters of god let's be
[1:04:47] ourselves let's serve
[1:04:50] God God just needs a moment to change
[1:04:53] your circumstance an let's turn to St
[1:04:55] John
[1:05:02] 5 St John 5 in verse two and it says now
[1:05:06] there isn't Jerusalem by the Sheep
[1:05:09] Market a
[1:05:10] pool which is called in the Hebrew
[1:05:12] tongue Bethesda having five
[1:05:17] porches the Hebrew word Bethesda here
[1:05:20] means a House of Mercy or a House of
[1:05:22] Grace now I want us to understand you're
[1:05:24] all well taught that God uses names and
[1:05:27] he uses places to give us examples and
[1:05:30] show show us different things so I want
[1:05:31] us to remember that this is a House of
[1:05:33] Mercy a House of
[1:05:35] Grace in these lay a great multitude of
[1:05:39] infant it folk of blind halt withered
[1:05:41] waiting for the moving of the water for
[1:05:44] an angel went down at a certain season
[1:05:46] into the pool and W and troubled the
[1:05:48] water and whoever then first after the
[1:05:52] troubling of the water stepped in it was
[1:05:54] made whole of whatsoever disease he had
[1:05:57] and a certain man was there which have
[1:06:00] an infirmity 38 years and when Jesus saw
[1:06:03] him lie he knew that he had been now a
[1:06:06] long time in that case and he saith unto
[1:06:09] him wil thou be made whole and the
[1:06:11] impotent man answered him and said sir I
[1:06:13] have no man when the water is troubled
[1:06:15] to put me in the pool but while I am
[1:06:18] coming another Ste down before me and
[1:06:21] Jes Jesus saith unto him rise take up
[1:06:24] thy bed and walk and immediately the man
[1:06:27] was made whole and took up his bed and
[1:06:29] walked and the same day was the Sabbath
[1:06:33] day you see the difference of a moment
[1:06:35] it's not how we see it and not how we
[1:06:38] understand it it's not according to the
[1:06:40] law it's not according to the custom you
[1:06:42] see the custom of that day was the
[1:06:44] stirring of the water the custom of the
[1:06:46] day
[1:06:48] Jesus went unrecognized because they he
[1:06:51] didn't come as they thought they thought
[1:06:53] he would come a different way and yet he
[1:06:55] came and the baby laying in a
[1:06:58] Manger many times people miss him
[1:07:00] because they did Jesus doesn't come how
[1:07:02] they think he should come all right they
[1:07:05] don't recognize that he's in the midst
[1:07:07] how many times do this
[1:07:10] man laying there 38 years how many times
[1:07:14] did this man make an effort to get into
[1:07:16] the pool how many times this man try to
[1:07:19] make it into that water and see somebody
[1:07:21] else get their healing see somebody else
[1:07:25] get what they had need of for 38 years
[1:07:27] this man tried and tried and kept trying
[1:07:31] and pretty soon I would assume and this
[1:07:33] is how I feel that this man kept trying
[1:07:35] and trying and trying until pretty soon
[1:07:38] what's the
[1:07:40] use I've tried over and over somebody
[1:07:43] always beats me to
[1:07:47] it somebody always beats me to it I
[1:07:51] wonder how many
[1:07:52] times how many times do we come into
[1:07:55] this house of God a House of Mercy a
[1:07:57] House of Grace full of people with
[1:08:00] sickness illnesses amen people who are
[1:08:03] in troubled that's what this house of
[1:08:04] God is it's a hospital to those that are
[1:08:07] in
[1:08:08] need it's a it's a hospital to those
[1:08:12] that are sick and Afflicted those that
[1:08:14] are lost and can't find their way that's
[1:08:16] what the house of God
[1:08:18] is it's for those to
[1:08:22] come the sanctuary is for the hurting a
[1:08:28] place of sa safety for the
[1:08:30] lost because let me say this when the
[1:08:32] stirring of the water happens it's a
[1:08:35] time to get in when the stirring of the
[1:08:38] water happens you don't wait on somebody
[1:08:40] else you don't wait for somebody else
[1:08:42] you don't wait on your dad or your mom
[1:08:44] you don't wait on your neighbor because
[1:08:46] sometimes God isn't dealing with your
[1:08:47] neighbor he's dealing with you sometimes
[1:08:50] God is moving on your heart and he's
[1:08:52] convicting and he's pulling and he's
[1:08:53] saying saying you got to move you got to
[1:08:55] get your faith in
[1:08:57] action you got to make a move toward God
[1:08:59] because God said if you make a move
[1:09:01] toward me I'll make a step toward you
[1:09:03] it's putting your faith into action
[1:09:06] don't be relying upon somebody
[1:09:09] else because maybe that moment is for
[1:09:12] you and you'll miss it because you're
[1:09:14] relying on somebody
[1:09:19] else we come to church and when the
[1:09:22] stirring of the water happens
[1:09:24] that's when the healing
[1:09:26] happens that's when God
[1:09:29] moves it was God's Divine way and we
[1:09:32] don't come to be a
[1:09:35] spectator we don't come to be a
[1:09:37] spectator because Spectators don't have
[1:09:39] anything to do with the game Spectators
[1:09:42] just observe they just see what's going
[1:09:44] on they see others doing it and jumping
[1:09:47] and shouting and getting into the
[1:09:48] service but that's all they do that's
[1:09:51] what Spectators do at the game they pay
[1:09:53] thousands of dollars to go to a ball
[1:09:55] game they paint their faces they pay all
[1:09:57] this money and hope their team
[1:10:00] wins and hope that they don't get
[1:10:02] disappointed in the outcome of the game
[1:10:05] but I can tell you tonight that you
[1:10:06] won't be disappointed when you come to
[1:10:07] the house of God because when you come
[1:10:10] he's never lost the battle he's never
[1:10:12] lost the one he said everyone is in the
[1:10:15] palm of my hand I've never lost to
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:22] one we're not called to be Spectators
[1:10:25] we're not called to be ones to take up a
[1:10:30] Pew I'm called to fill up a Pew why
[1:10:35] because we got to get in the game and I
[1:10:37] I begin to read and about the Rich Young
[1:10:40] Ruler he's mentioned three times in the
[1:10:43] Bible in Matthew in Luke and then in
[1:10:48] Mark and two of them he says he says
[1:10:51] what must I do that I might inherit the
[1:10:54] kingdom of God he says do these things
[1:10:57] and he says I have kept these I have
[1:10:58] done these from my youth I have kept
[1:11:01] them I know what the law is I know the
[1:11:03] Commandments I know how to live right
[1:11:06] yes but yet one it says these have I
[1:11:09] observed from my
[1:11:11] youth these have I observed and it kind
[1:11:14] of struck me because I wonder how many
[1:11:16] times that we have young people and I
[1:11:17] did it for years because I was raised in
[1:11:19] the message and you come and You observe
[1:11:21] what's going on you know the
[1:11:23] Commandments you know how to live you
[1:11:25] know the different things to do the
[1:11:27] different things to say the right kind
[1:11:29] of Life to Live to put up on put a front
[1:11:34] on we know these different things but
[1:11:36] yet he observed these things from his
[1:11:38] youth but he never had an
[1:11:41] experience he never met
[1:11:44] God and so I begin to see that this Rich
[1:11:48] Young
[1:11:49] Ruler he had an opportunity he had a
[1:11:52] moment but yet he
[1:11:54] failed he chose
[1:11:57] differently he chose differently and
[1:12:00] from that time it altered the course of
[1:12:03] his
[1:12:04] life it altered the course of his
[1:12:08] life now and here he's making
[1:12:13] excuses just as this man was lying there
[1:12:16] he says do you want to be made whole and
[1:12:18] he says I have nobody to put me in he
[1:12:22] began to make excuses
[1:12:25] es yet we don't have an excuse young
[1:12:28] people from the youngest to the oldest
[1:12:31] you see God deals with the Gentiles
[1:12:34] differently God deals with the Gentiles
[1:12:36] as individuals he deals with you as
[1:12:39] individuals he doesn't deal with you as
[1:12:41] a group of body amen he deals with us
[1:12:44] and sometimes within our hearts he might
[1:12:45] send a conviction he might send
[1:12:47] something in our life to call you a
[1:12:49] little bit higher say throw away those
[1:12:51] things that you're doing don't do those
[1:12:53] things and yet he's calling us a little
[1:12:54] bit higher but yet he's dealing with you
[1:12:56] as an
[1:12:59] individual we know that the pool was
[1:13:01] God's way of Divine Healing for the
[1:13:03] people in that
[1:13:06] day it was the way of healing you see
[1:13:09] first and second pool were attraction
[1:13:11] pools they're attraction pools they
[1:13:13] begin
[1:13:14] to gather the people you see a great
[1:13:17] multitude had gathered
[1:13:19] here their attraction pools just like
[1:13:21] brother brandom's day when he had the
[1:13:23] healing campaigns down in Duran South
[1:13:25] Africa 25,000 people were healed at one
[1:13:29] time that was just the bait on the hook
[1:13:31] it was just the
[1:13:32] attraction but you see when you get into
[1:13:34] the third pool when you get to the
[1:13:36] revealing of the word let's go back to
[1:13:39] our story when you get to the revealing
[1:13:40] of the word Christ himself was the
[1:13:43] revealed word for that hour and he began
[1:13:45] to walk right amongst them and they
[1:13:47] missed
[1:13:48] him he was walking amongst them and they
[1:13:51] were waiting for the stirring of the
[1:13:52] water they were waiting for the
[1:13:54] troubling of the water and yet the
[1:13:55] Healer was walking right amongst
[1:13:58] them we must
[1:14:01] recognize the revealed word for our
[1:14:10] hour you see sometimes God he sends
[1:14:13] angels to do things for him yes in this
[1:14:17] story he would send an angel down to
[1:14:19] stir the
[1:14:20] water he would send an angel down at his
[1:14:23] certain season I don't know if it was
[1:14:24] every month every day every whenever it
[1:14:27] was but yet he would send an angel to do
[1:14:29] it and somebody would get healed but
[1:14:31] this day was different sometimes God
[1:14:34] sends angels and sometimes he goes down
[1:14:37] himself sometimes he wants to handle it
[1:14:39] himself sometimes he says Gabriel I I
[1:14:42] got this one today this man is going to
[1:14:45] meet the Healer he's not just going to
[1:14:48] get his healing but he's going to meet
[1:14:49] the Healer himself and that's what God
[1:14:52] does in our lives sometimes he comes
[1:14:54] down and he says you know what I'll
[1:14:55] handle this one just like the three
[1:14:57] Hebrew children he says you know what
[1:14:59] I'll do this myself I'm going to go down
[1:15:01] myself I'm going to be that Fourth Man
[1:15:03] In The Fire And he's still the same
[1:15:05] today he doesn't change his ways he
[1:15:08] doesn't change the way he operates you
[1:15:11] just must catch the revealing you must
[1:15:13] catch the transition that God is doing
[1:15:19] amen and Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:15:22] today and forever he says now we realize
[1:15:24] that they've had Divine healings even
[1:15:26] before he come on Earth how many knows
[1:15:29] that the pool of Bethesda was a healing
[1:15:31] sign and down Through the Ages they've
[1:15:33] had all kinds of
[1:15:35] healing but there was supposed to be a
[1:15:37] sign following the Messiah he had a
[1:15:39] messiah sign and if he was Messiah which
[1:15:42] is the anointed one the Christ then
[1:15:44] there was a sign of the Messiah followed
[1:15:47] that Messiah he says there's a sign that
[1:15:50] follows the believer you believe that
[1:15:52] God is a god of of signs wonders and
[1:15:54] miracles and if he was the first if he
[1:15:57] did that the first time he's going to do
[1:15:58] that the second time and if he did that
[1:16:00] the second time he's going to do that
[1:16:01] the third time why because God don't
[1:16:03] change the way he
[1:16:05] operates if he healed one way he's going
[1:16:08] to do it again if he delivered one way
[1:16:10] he's going to do it again why because
[1:16:12] he's God and that's how we operate but
[1:16:15] sometimes within our minds we get caught
[1:16:16] up in this human element in this time
[1:16:19] element that we begin to realize and we
[1:16:21] begin to question why God would take one
[1:16:23] and he would raise up another he would
[1:16:25] deliver one and keep one down he would
[1:16:27] do a miracle on one and then he would do
[1:16:29] a healing on another yet the same
[1:16:32] situation but yet that's our human
[1:16:35] element that's our own carnal reasoning
[1:16:38] because he's God and he does what he
[1:16:41] wants he moves how he wants he says
[1:16:44] therefore what God Said is perfect if he
[1:16:47] ever called was called on the scene for
[1:16:49] a sinner the attitude he took toward
[1:16:51] that sinner he would have to do the same
[1:16:53] to the next any impotent sinner from
[1:16:57] thereafter if he ever was called on the
[1:16:59] scene to heal the sick the the attitude
[1:17:02] he took toward that sick person he would
[1:17:04] have to do the
[1:17:06] same because he acts the same way or if
[1:17:10] he acted the first time then he would
[1:17:12] have acted wrong which is not right
[1:17:15] therefore that's why
[1:17:18] God he says he acted the same or he did
[1:17:22] it when he acted the first time there's
[1:17:25] God you see God doesn't change his way
[1:17:27] that's the standard he has
[1:17:32] amen but yet we get caught up in this
[1:17:34] human
[1:17:35] element we know in our story brother
[1:17:37] Brandon would talk about this in hearing
[1:17:39] him he would say that
[1:17:42] this this man would be sick and
[1:17:45] afflicted for 38
[1:17:47] years 38 years he had this and God would
[1:17:51] walk through the multitude to one heal
[1:17:54] the man and walk out and you say well I
[1:17:57] thought God was all omniscient I thought
[1:17:59] he was all caring he cares for us he has
[1:18:02] compassion for each one of us yet that
[1:18:05] compassion is to do the will of the
[1:18:07] father because later in that passage he
[1:18:09] says I can do nothing unless the father
[1:18:11] first show
[1:18:12] me it's no different with the prophet of
[1:18:14] this hour yes that's why he would stand
[1:18:17] there in a prayer line he said I'm
[1:18:19] waiting for him because I can do nothing
[1:18:21] unless he shows me first
[1:18:27] amen he says compassion is to do the
[1:18:30] will of God that's what real Christian
[1:18:32] Compassion is to do the will of God and
[1:18:34] we mix it up today and we try to put a
[1:18:36] human element to it and we get this
[1:18:38] human element mixed up with a Christian
[1:18:40] and godly element and then we make a
[1:18:42] mess out of it because we only know by
[1:18:45] inches feet and so forth by pounds and
[1:18:48] ounces and so forth that's what we know
[1:18:50] we're a time people people it's in all
[1:18:53] eternity with him and we try to bring
[1:18:57] God's Great infinite mind down to our
[1:18:59] little finite
[1:19:01] Minds you know what would solve that is
[1:19:06] prayer is
[1:19:08] prayer because brother brandom says it's
[1:19:11] not what brings God down to man but
[1:19:13] prayer is what brings go man up to God
[1:19:16] and when you begin to get up onto God
[1:19:18] and you get into that Eternal element
[1:19:21] that's why you can pray and you can seek
[1:19:22] the mind of God you can be going through
[1:19:24] the worst days of your life or sickness
[1:19:26] or trials and you begin to whenever you
[1:19:28] pray you begin to go up into the element
[1:19:30] where God
[1:19:32] dwells where he's all intient he's all
[1:19:34] caring and he knows the end from the
[1:19:37] beginning and he takes you up into that
[1:19:39] element and it takes away this human
[1:19:41] carnal reasoning and
[1:19:44] understanding amen prayer is the most
[1:19:47] powerful weapon we have as a
[1:19:51] believer
[1:19:54] he says and we get it all mixed up so
[1:19:56] the best thing to do is read his word
[1:19:58] and remember that his word will not
[1:20:00] contct itself you see when you begin to
[1:20:03] read his word his word is our
[1:20:05] blueprint it's our very TI poost
[1:20:08] everything that we have need of is in
[1:20:09] his word any answers any questions
[1:20:12] anything that we have need of is in his
[1:20:14] word that's our absolute that's what we
[1:20:16] go back
[1:20:17] to
[1:20:19] amen and we just must
[1:20:21] believe
[1:20:23] you see in our story we we see this man
[1:20:25] that was sick and God came and he came
[1:20:27] down now compassion is to do the will of
[1:20:30] the father and God would walk amongst it
[1:20:33] and he would speak the word to this
[1:20:35] man he would say take up thy bed and
[1:20:37] walk and he was made whole he didn't
[1:20:40] pray for him he didn't lay hands on him
[1:20:42] he spoke the word but yet our Bible says
[1:20:44] in Mark 16 that you lay hands on the
[1:20:46] sick and they shall recover you see it's
[1:20:48] doing the will of the
[1:20:50] father whatever he says do do
[1:20:55] right and we see here that natural
[1:20:58] healing is secondary we thank God for
[1:21:02] healing our bodies for touching us but
[1:21:05] healing of the soul is so much greater
[1:21:07] what is greater the the healing or the
[1:21:10] opening of you know blinded eyes or
[1:21:13] giving you Revelation and understanding
[1:21:16] which one is
[1:21:17] greater because sometimes we come in
[1:21:20] contact and we meet the Healer but yet
[1:21:23] we stop
[1:21:24] there we stop there we thank God for
[1:21:27] healing us but yet he tells us in this
[1:21:30] story that he meets the man in the
[1:21:32] temple and he says you have made been
[1:21:35] been made
[1:21:36] whole he says but go and sin no
[1:21:40] more and lest a greater thing come upon
[1:21:44] you lest a greater thing come upon
[1:21:47] you and I begin to think
[1:21:51] about what what this sin is because we
[1:21:56] receive our healing but then we
[1:21:59] stop and we don't go on and kick out the
[1:22:02] sin in our lives sin is unbelief
[1:22:05] everything else is just attributes of
[1:22:06] what sin produces but sin is unbelief
[1:22:09] and we we get our healing but we don't
[1:22:11] kick out that unbelief in our
[1:22:14] life and I wonder how many times that I
[1:22:17] did it as a young person you can go from
[1:22:19] Camp to Camp you can go from me meting
[1:22:22] to meeting you can go from prayer line
[1:22:25] to prayer line or you can come and have
[1:22:26] be prayed for for the same thing that
[1:22:28] you were prayed for last week right
[1:22:31] prayed for the week before last year why
[1:22:33] because you got your healing but you
[1:22:35] never kicked the sin out of your life we
[1:22:37] have things in our lives that we have to
[1:22:39] kick out we have to clean out we have to
[1:22:41] wash out you see the moving of the water
[1:22:44] brother brandom says that the moving of
[1:22:45] the water is also Revival in your
[1:22:48] life you say I'm not sick I'm not I
[1:22:50] don't have to wait for the moving of the
[1:22:52] water listen brother brandom
[1:22:54] says about the moving of the water he
[1:22:57] says it kicks the trash out of our life
[1:22:59] it's Revival he says a Revival don't
[1:23:03] don't mean you add anything to the
[1:23:05] church a Revival means you re revive
[1:23:08] what's already it it's
[1:23:10] got he says that's a
[1:23:12] Revival you see I he says I was standing
[1:23:15] there he's talking about up at Lake
[1:23:16] Michigan he said I was standing up there
[1:23:18] watching the waves come in and out and
[1:23:19] say oh the sea was jumping the water was
[1:23:22] jumping and the boats were rocking and I
[1:23:24] thought what's going on I thought why
[1:23:26] the lake is having a Revival that's it
[1:23:28] he says it's jumping and shaking why
[1:23:31] there's a rushing Mighty Wind coming
[1:23:33] down I thought well you know what it is
[1:23:35] he says there isn't one more drop of it
[1:23:38] than it had before when it was perfectly
[1:23:40] still he says no more water in it it's
[1:23:43] just all stirred up well now what's the
[1:23:46] stirring about you know what that
[1:23:49] stirring of the water does it washes
[1:23:51] everything out up into to the bank he
[1:23:54] says that's what we need a washing of
[1:23:55] unbelief out onto the bank let the word
[1:23:58] of God have preeminence that's what we
[1:23:59] need a Revival to wash out unbelief all
[1:24:02] the bugs superstitions and things come
[1:24:04] and see that God is still God and that's
[1:24:06] what we have revivals for you see when
[1:24:09] the stirring of the water happens what
[1:24:11] does water represent it's a body of
[1:24:13] people you see when the stirring of the
[1:24:15] water happens that's what revive Revival
[1:24:18] is and that's what it's for is to wash
[1:24:19] out all unbelief all the iniquity all
[1:24:21] the things in our lives things that we
[1:24:23] know that we shouldn't be doing and
[1:24:25] we're doing as Christians we should be
[1:24:27] living a higher
[1:24:29] life kicking out all the unbelief in our
[1:24:34] lives it's washing out all the unbelief
[1:24:36] and the things in our
[1:24:39] lives the go and sin no more I I was
[1:24:42] looking and go and sin no more is used
[1:24:44] two times in our Bible the first time
[1:24:47] was here in the in the the pool of
[1:24:50] Bethesda but the second one was whenever
[1:24:53] the woman was brought before Jesus right
[1:24:56] was brought before Jesus it was a woman
[1:24:58] caught in the very act it wasn't
[1:25:02] accusations or or or gossip amongst the
[1:25:04] church it it wasn't just something out
[1:25:06] there but she was caught in the very act
[1:25:09] and she was brought before judgment she
[1:25:11] was brought to be judged but yet this
[1:25:16] judgment when judgment was there when
[1:25:19] judgment was imminent that's when Grace
[1:25:21] stepped in
[1:25:23] that's when God said which of you has
[1:25:26] sin in your life you cast the first
[1:25:29] stone you cast the first stone and what
[1:25:31] did they do they walked away one by one
[1:25:34] from the oldest to the youngest what was
[1:25:36] it because they walked away
[1:25:39] ashamed they walked away with their
[1:25:41] heads down and there only there remained
[1:25:43] two in the
[1:25:46] midst there only remained two in the
[1:25:48] midst and it was the forgiver and the
[1:25:51] forgiven
[1:25:53] the forgiver and the forgiven listen if
[1:25:55] they would have recognized who was in
[1:25:57] their midst if they would have
[1:25:59] recognized the man that was there if
[1:26:01] they they too could have walked away not
[1:26:04] just ashamed but their heads up
[1:26:08] forgiven because the forgiver was
[1:26:10] amongst
[1:26:12] them the forgiver was
[1:26:15] there and yet they walked away
[1:26:21] ashamed
[1:26:25] you see Jesus said neither do I accuse
[1:26:28] you go and sin no more so he gave them
[1:26:30] both something to do he gave them both
[1:26:33] something to do to go and take that
[1:26:37] unbelief and sin out of their
[1:26:39] life you see because sometimes it's
[1:26:43] good sometimes we come in contact with
[1:26:45] the Healer but we must go on that's
[1:26:48] right we must go on right good because
[1:26:51] the that's just not the healing that
[1:26:53] we're looking for we're looking for
[1:26:54] healing of the
[1:26:57] Soul because from that time it starts
[1:27:00] something new because when you meet God
[1:27:03] from that time something is different
[1:27:06] right amen from that time your life is
[1:27:09] different it's not just as Christians
[1:27:11] that we can say from that time but it's
[1:27:13] us as human beings from that time is a
[1:27:17] time in place in your life that you make
[1:27:19] a
[1:27:20] decision a Time in a place that God
[1:27:23] comes on the scene or maybe it's a time
[1:27:25] that you know something goes bad in your
[1:27:27] life you can ask the drug addict out
[1:27:29] there you can ask the alcoholic you can
[1:27:31] ask ones out
[1:27:33] there what happened and they can point
[1:27:36] back to a
[1:27:37] moment that they can say from that time
[1:27:40] on this went happen from that time on I
[1:27:44] went down this path I remember the day
[1:27:46] that I chose this past I remember the
[1:27:48] day that I drank my first beer I
[1:27:50] remember the day that I did this
[1:27:52] this and from that time their life has
[1:27:55] changed
[1:27:56] forever but yet we it's not all things
[1:28:00] that we see in our natural element but
[1:28:03] yes sometimes from our from that time on
[1:28:05] we know when God comes in our life amen
[1:28:08] we can say from that time on God met me
[1:28:10] at the altar from that time on God met
[1:28:13] me there on that day and I was filled
[1:28:15] with the Holy Ghost and I was made a new
[1:28:17] man from that time on I was different
[1:28:19] you can put a stake in the ground and
[1:28:21] say from that time on I'm
[1:28:23] different and you can always take Satan
[1:28:26] back to that
[1:28:27] time and say this is the day that it
[1:28:31] changed my life yes
[1:28:33] sir we can read in our Bibles of this
[1:28:36] the woman at the
[1:28:38] well the woman at the well she had an
[1:28:41] appointment with God and from that time
[1:28:44] on he said I perceive that you have five
[1:28:49] husbands and the one you're with now is
[1:28:51] not your husband usband she says there's
[1:28:53] a messiah that's going to come and he's
[1:28:54] going to tell us these things and he
[1:28:56] says I am he what was it the revealed
[1:28:59] word of her hour coming to her what was
[1:29:01] it the very word coming the word being
[1:29:05] made flesh to her as the individual
[1:29:08] within that
[1:29:11] moment thank you Lord from time that
[1:29:15] time on we can look back in our
[1:29:18] lives and we
[1:29:20] see examp
[1:29:22] temples we can look at the two walking
[1:29:25] on the road to
[1:29:27] Emmas that they were walking and talking
[1:29:30] but yet from that time on God came on
[1:29:31] the scene he began to talk and expound
[1:29:34] unto them he began to give them
[1:29:35] Revelation and understanding of who he
[1:29:37] was and what they were looking for and
[1:29:39] from that time they walked differently
[1:29:41] we all have these moments in our lives
[1:29:44] but yet it's the difference of a
[1:29:48] moment you see the difference of a
[1:29:51] moment
[1:29:55] and a story that it never gets old is a
[1:29:58] thief on the
[1:30:01] cross the difference of a moment you see
[1:30:03] a man that lived his life contrary to
[1:30:06] everything that heaven is all
[1:30:09] about this man lived in sin he had
[1:30:15] unbelief he never did anything good and
[1:30:19] I'm sure as he hung there on the cross
[1:30:21] with only moments to
[1:30:23] live he only had a
[1:30:27] moment but yet this thief on the cross I
[1:30:29] wonder as he hung
[1:30:32] there he begin to wonder and he begin to
[1:30:34] question should I ask
[1:30:36] him should I ask
[1:30:40] him and I'm sure within his mind he
[1:30:42] begin to play now you're not worthy
[1:30:44] enough you haven't done anything good
[1:30:47] you don't deserve this what have you
[1:30:50] done to go where this man is going why
[1:30:52] would this man care about
[1:30:54] you and I'm sure doubt begin to set in
[1:30:57] his mind and I'm sure Jesus is sitting
[1:30:59] there and he's saying ask me anyway ask
[1:31:02] me
[1:31:03] anyway why because there was a deep on
[1:31:07] the inside of that man he never lived a
[1:31:09] good life never did anything for God yet
[1:31:13] within that
[1:31:15] moment Jesus is saying ask me anyway son
[1:31:19] ask me anyway I'll give what you have
[1:31:22] desire he says father will you remember
[1:31:25] me never repented never asked for
[1:31:27] forgiveness never did anything he just
[1:31:29] said remember
[1:31:30] me and he says you will be with me in
[1:31:34] Paradise you see one
[1:31:36] moment there was two thieves One Moment
[1:31:40] One chose Life One chose
[1:31:44] death the difference of a moment is what
[1:31:46] you do with that moment all
[1:31:49] right the difference of that moment will
[1:31:53] alter the course of your
[1:31:56] life
[1:31:59] amen and I'm sure as this thief as he
[1:32:03] crossed
[1:32:04] over and he began to go up to different
[1:32:06] ones and he began to shake the hands and
[1:32:08] I know you've heard the story and he
[1:32:10] begin to shake the hands of the
[1:32:12] different ones and they begin to say God
[1:32:13] bless you where are you from what church
[1:32:15] did you go to he says I've never went to
[1:32:18] church all
[1:32:20] right well well well did you get the
[1:32:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost no I i' never
[1:32:26] baptized well did you speak in tongues
[1:32:28] did you do something for God did you
[1:32:30] give him a glass of water what did you
[1:32:31] do that you earned your way to
[1:32:35] heaven and he says I did
[1:32:38] nothing well how did you get here how
[1:32:41] did you get here he said because the man
[1:32:43] in the middle said I could come you see
[1:32:46] it was just an invitation from the
[1:32:48] Middle the man in the middle gave him an
[1:32:50] invitation he had every
[1:32:54] right the man in the middle said I could
[1:33:00] come how many of us have received that
[1:33:04] invitation you see I don't have to wait
[1:33:06] until my deathbed until I'm laying there
[1:33:08] with no hope no thing right now I want
[1:33:11] to give my life for Jesus Christ I want
[1:33:13] to say God I want to serve you I want to
[1:33:15] live for you I want to do everything I
[1:33:18] can to make a
[1:33:20] difference
[1:33:22] the man in the middle said I could
[1:33:28] come how big is God's
[1:33:30] grace how big is God's mercy how big is
[1:33:34] God's love sometimes we take away from
[1:33:37] different people because we we see that
[1:33:40] they don't earn it or they don't deserve
[1:33:42] it but yet that's our human element
[1:33:45] speaking that's our human and time
[1:33:48] element that we begin to see and we look
[1:33:49] at these five senses around us and we
[1:33:51] begin to judge one
[1:33:54] another but yet the grace of God Is So
[1:33:56] Much Greater is so much more powerful
[1:33:59] than anything that we ever have than we
[1:34:02] can ever
[1:34:09] think you see this human element of
[1:34:13] God's grace and his mercy so much
[1:34:15] greater and I'm so thankful that I know
[1:34:18] and I have a personal relationship with
[1:34:20] the man in the middle amen yes sir that
[1:34:23] man has given an
[1:34:26] invitation that
[1:34:28] man is one that you can talk with and
[1:34:31] have fellowship with he Longs and
[1:34:33] desires to have fellowship with each one
[1:34:35] of
[1:34:38] us it's a daily Walk With Jesus Christ
[1:34:42] it's a daily love affair he longs to
[1:34:45] have fellowship with
[1:34:49] you the difference of a moment is what
[1:34:51] you do with that
[1:34:54] opportunity you see moments come and go
[1:34:58] and then it's just a
[1:35:00] memory it just becomes a part of our uh
[1:35:04] the history of our human and time
[1:35:05] element but I say let us redeem the time
[1:35:09] let us seize the moment that you were in
[1:35:11] because when God comes by when God is
[1:35:14] moving that is the time to redeem it
[1:35:16] amen because you don't know when the
[1:35:18] next time he's going to come by your way
[1:35:20] you don't know the next time you might
[1:35:22] have fellowship and he might come down
[1:35:24] and show himself to you yet he's still
[1:35:27] there but we must recognize when God is
[1:35:31] in our midst amen Jesus unrecognized is
[1:35:35] a wonderful service that brother Brandon
[1:35:37] preaches it breaks my heart every
[1:35:40] time because he says many times we miss
[1:35:43] our
[1:35:44] blessing because we don't recognize when
[1:35:47] he's walking amongst us maybe God is in
[1:35:50] your brother or sister
[1:35:52] sister maybe God is one in one another
[1:35:54] maybe he's there to reach out a hand
[1:35:56] he's there in in somebody maybe it's
[1:35:59] somebody in the church and God wants you
[1:36:00] to reach out and show compassion and
[1:36:02] love
[1:36:05] for that's what Christianity is all
[1:36:08] about is serving one
[1:36:12] another you see the moments with Christ
[1:36:14] are Eternal and they have eternal
[1:36:18] value as we read in our opening
[1:36:20] scripture that for our light
[1:36:22] affections but is which is just for a
[1:36:25] moment worketh for us a far more
[1:36:28] exceeding and eternal weight of
[1:36:31] Glory while we look not at the things
[1:36:33] which are seen but the things which are
[1:36:35] not seen for the things which are seen
[1:36:38] are temporal but the things which aren't
[1:36:41] seen are
[1:36:43] Eternal you see we have to stop looking
[1:36:46] at our these temporal things around
[1:36:50] us
[1:36:51] these temporal things around
[1:36:54] us can then begin to control the way we
[1:36:57] think the way we act the way we talk
[1:37:00] they're temporal things they're temporal
[1:37:02] situations but we must look to our
[1:37:05] Eternal God who knows all things amen
[1:37:09] and you know he has your best interest
[1:37:11] in mind that's right he has your best
[1:37:13] interest in mind that's right he wants
[1:37:15] the very best for you yeah sometimes it
[1:37:18] might not feel like it sickness might
[1:37:20] not feel like it's the best but
[1:37:21] sometimes that's what you need because
[1:37:23] why sometimes our trials is what brings
[1:37:25] God on the
[1:37:27] scene trials is what makes you closer to
[1:37:30] God why because you begin to pray more
[1:37:32] you begin to seek God
[1:37:35] more he gives us what we have need of
[1:37:38] not what we
[1:37:39] want
[1:37:43] amen the difference of a moment let's
[1:37:47] stand you see the difference of a moment
[1:37:55] one of these days in a moment and
[1:37:57] twinking of an
[1:37:58] eye amen we will be
[1:38:02] changed it's just going to take a
[1:38:06] moment let me ask you tonight what will
[1:38:08] you do with your
[1:38:10] moment what will you do with that moment
[1:38:13] will you seize that
[1:38:15] opportunity will you take advantage of
[1:38:17] that opportunity that God has given each
[1:38:20] one of us
[1:38:22] ah they come at different seasons they
[1:38:23] come at different points in our
[1:38:27] lives but yet I want to say I want to
[1:38:29] seize every moment that God has given us
[1:38:32] let us redeem the
[1:38:34] time for it is
[1:38:36] evil we are living in an evil time

[1:39:09] Lord maybe some things have come across

[1:39:16] can do better that we can serve you more
[1:39:19] that within moments that you come by our
[1:39:21] way that father we can recognize when
[1:39:24] you're in our
[1:39:26] midst we can recognize the moving of the
[1:39:29] holy spirit because when the water is
[1:39:33] stirring when the water is moving is a
[1:39:35] time to get in it's a time to put our
[1:39:37] faith into
[1:39:39] action it's time to make a step toward

[1:40:00] sufficient father you help us you lead
[1:40:04] us you guide
[1:40:05] us we know that Christian people we will
[1:40:08] have our faults and our

[1:40:21] God that they can talk to they they can
[1:40:23] walk with they can ask they can seek and
[1:40:26] so father we're so thankful that we have
