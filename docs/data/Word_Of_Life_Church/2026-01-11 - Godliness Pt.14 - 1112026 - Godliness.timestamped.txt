[30:00] the rock where he leads me. when I'm so
[30:04] overwhelmed.
[30:07] He's a place where he hides me
[30:11] under his wings.
[30:14] He's not just a song.
[30:17] Oh, he's the reason I sing.
[30:25] Sing it with me this morning.
[30:28] I have been blessed.
[30:32] God so good to me.
[30:36] Preious are his thoughts of you and me.
[30:42] No way I could count them. There's not
[30:47] enough time.
[31:04] I have been blessed.
[31:08] Sing it one more time this morning. Oh,
[31:11] I have been blessed.
[31:14] God so good to me.
[31:18] Preious are his thoughts of you and me.
[31:25] No way I could count them. There's not
[31:30] enough time.
[31:32] So, I'll just thank him for being so
[31:37] kind.
[31:39] God has been good.
[31:43] He's so good.
[31:46] I have been blessed.
[31:52] Oh, I have been blessed.
[31:57] God so good to me.
[32:00] Preious are his thoughts of you and me.
[32:07] No way I could count them. There's not
[32:12] enough time.
[32:14] So, I'll just thank him for being so
[32:19] kind.
[32:21] God has been good.
[32:24] He's so
[32:27] good.
[32:28] I have been blessed.
[32:33] Oh my God has been good.
[32:39] He's so good.
[32:43] I have been blessed.
[33:36] Glad you've been blessed.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; You know, blessed is not always on a
[33:42] mountaintop.
[33:45] I was reading this morning before church
[33:48] Jeremiah 33:1. And the Lord said, "More
[33:51] the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah
[33:53] the second time while he was shut up in
[33:55] the court of the prison."
[33:58] And the second verse says, "Thus sayith
[34:00] the Lord, the maker thereof, and the
[34:01] Lord that formed it to establish it, the
[34:03] Lord is his name. Call unto me, and I
[34:06] will answer thee, and show thee great
[34:08] and mighty things which thou knowest
[34:10] not."
[34:12] It probably didn't look like great and
[34:13] mighty things which thou knowest not
[34:15] sitting in a prison,
[34:17] but God is still God.
[34:23] I didn't really get to practice to be
[34:25] honest with you. Mother Louis asked me
[34:28] to have a song ready and I forgot we
[34:29] were supposed to keep a three-year-old
[34:31] for three days
[34:34] and three nights.
[34:40] So, I didn't get to practice to be
[34:41] honest. Hopefully,
[34:43] I'm glad I'm glad the Lord loves me.
[34:46] Aren't you glad you love him back?
[34:57] Who am I
[34:59] that the Lord of all the earth
[35:04] would care to know my name?
[35:08] would care to feel my heart.
[35:14] Who am I
[35:16] that the bright and morning star
[35:21] will choose to light the way
[35:25] for my ever wondering heart.
[35:32] Not because of who I am,
[35:36] but because of what you've done.
[35:40] Not because of what I've done,
[35:44] but because of who you are.
[35:50] I am a flower quickly fading.
[35:55] Here today, gone tomorrow.
[36:00] A wave tossed in the ocean.
[36:04] A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me
[36:09] when I'm calling.
[36:12] Lord, you catch me when I'm falling
[36:16] and told me who I am.
[36:22] I am yours.
[36:33] Who am I
[36:35] that the eyes that see my sin
[36:39] would look on me with love
[36:44] and watch me rise again?
[36:48] Thank you, Lord. Who am I?
[36:52] That the voice that calmed the sea
[36:56] would call out through the rain
[37:01] and calm the storm in me.
[37:07] Not because of who I am,
[37:11] but because of what you've done.
[37:15] Not because of what I've done,
[37:20] but because of who you are.
[37:25] I am a flower quickly fading.
[37:30] Here today, gone tomorrow.
[37:35] A wave tossed in the ocean.
[37:39] The vapor and the wind. Still you hear
[37:44] me when I'm calling.
[37:48] Lord, you catch me when I falling.
[37:53] Told me who I am.
[37:58] I am yours.
[38:02] I am yours.
[38:07] I am yours.
[38:11] I am yours.
[38:29] Maybe you should keep that
[38:30] three-year-old more often.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[38:38] Isn't it so wonderful to be a Christian?
[38:43] &gt;&gt; To be saved, to know the Lord Jesus,
[38:47] and to know that as wonderful as it is
[38:50] now to be a Christian serving him,
[38:54] our minds cannot comprehend what he has
[38:56] laid up for those that love him.
[39:00] It's a it's a great privilege for us to
[39:02] be the people of God.
[39:05] Um, brother Tim Bdette wanted me to be
[39:07] sure and thank everyone for praying for
[39:10] his wife and uh, they did a stent and it
[39:14] was in the main artery vein, whatever
[39:18] it's called, the wood maker is what they
[39:20] call it. It was blocked 100%.
[39:24] And it was the mercy of the Lord
[39:27] definitely that her sister was there in
[39:28] the hospital. Brother Daryl had shared
[39:31] it with him and he said if she hadn't
[39:33] been at the hospital the story would
[39:35] have been totally different today. But
[39:37] God in his grace, he knows what he's
[39:39] doing, don't it?
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; So, brother Tim, we're just so thankful
[39:43] for the prayers everybody. We believe
[39:45] prayer works, don't it?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; It sure does. And we're so grateful for
[39:49] that. So, he just wanted me to to thank
[39:52] you from them. Let's read together if
[39:55] you would today in the ma book of
[39:57] Matthew chapter 10 verse 13.
[40:02] Just wonderful to feel his presence this
[40:04] way this morning.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:09] Matthew chapter 10 verse 13.
[40:12] And if the house be worthy, let your
[40:15] peace
[40:16] come upon it. Now remember the setting
[40:18] is Jesus is sending the disciples out
[40:21] two by two to preach. So this is their
[40:24] first missionary trip and he's giving
[40:27] them instructions on what to do, what to
[40:30] expect, how to react.
[40:33] If the house be worthy, let your peace
[40:37] come upon it.
[40:40] But if it be not worthy, let your peace
[40:44] return to you.
[40:46] Can you believe that preachers
[40:49] even without the Holy Ghost
[40:52] have such a position
[40:55] with God?
[40:57] Anybody believe that?
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; Now, these are the words of Jesus. Now,
[41:01] I'm not a theologian.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; So, if the house be worthy, so when
[41:04] you're going out preaching and you go
[41:06] in, you enter into these places, and if
[41:08] the house be worthy, let your peace
[41:13] come upon it. So a preacher, a man of
[41:16] God, a minister would be able to leave
[41:19] peace
[41:21] on a household.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; But if it be not worthy, let your peace
[41:28] return to you.
[41:30] And whosoever shall not receive you, nor
[41:33] hear your words,
[41:36] when you depart out of that house or
[41:38] city, shake off the dust
[41:42] of your feet. For verily I say unto you,
[41:45] it shall be more tolerable for the land
[41:48] of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of
[41:51] judgment than for that city.
[41:56] Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the
[42:01] midst of wolves.
[42:04] Be you therefore wise as serpents
[42:08] and harmless
[42:10] &gt;&gt; as staffs.
[42:12] and we'd like to be remembered today as
[42:14] we pray.
[42:16] Heavenly Father,
[42:20] they must have been astounded
[42:23] when they heard you say these words.
[42:26] No doubt they believed you could do
[42:28] that.
[42:30] but for them to accept the fact
[42:33] that they could do this.
[42:37] I pray Lord that we today would be
[42:40] benefited by our gathering together here
[42:43] Lord. That we would be able to see more
[42:45] of our position
[42:48] in this age and this time of great
[42:50] darkness that's upon the face of the
[42:52] earth.
[42:54] But yet, Lord God, if you're the same
[42:56] one that's sending forth ministers, and
[42:58] we believe that you are, then we believe
[43:01] your grace and your mercy goes with
[43:03] them. And not only preachers, but with
[43:05] every child of God. You saw the hands up
[43:09] lifted today. You know the desire, the
[43:11] request.
[43:13] Father, this prayer calls that I have on
[43:15] my hand I'll preach with today. Lord,
[43:18] you see this need of this sister, dear
[43:21] God, this individual with this cancer
[43:23] and what's going on for them, Lord. And
[43:25] may the spirit of God go with this even
[43:28] over to North Carolina. Dear God, would
[43:31] you move? We pray. Father, I pray for
[43:36] Brother Nikki there in South Africa.
[43:40] Lord, you see this wildfire that moved
[43:43] through their home, their farm, all that
[43:45] that went on this this past few days. I
[43:49] pray, Lord Jesus, that you would help
[43:51] them. It was a tremendous loss for them.
[43:54] Dear God, would you move for them? Many
[43:56] that are sick, afflicted among us, but
[43:59] we believe, Father, your power is
[44:01] greater than the power of the enemy.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; Speak to us today, we ask in the name of
[44:06] the Lord Jesus. And the saints said,
[44:09] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[44:15] So to be godly,
[44:19] of course we know means
[44:21] to be like God.
[44:24] Who would have ever thought God in flesh
[44:27] would have told his disciples something
[44:31] like this? Verse 16. And we'll read it
[44:33] again. Behold, I send you forth as sheep
[44:37] in the midst of wolves.
[44:39] Be ye therefore wise
[44:42] as serpents.
[44:46] Wise as serpents.
[44:49] So from the very beginning in the book
[44:50] of Genesis chapter 3, we see that the
[44:53] serpent was the most subtle of all the
[44:57] beasts of the field which the Lord God
[44:59] had made.
[45:01] We see that he answers back even plumb
[45:03] to the end of the New Testament in the
[45:05] book of Revelation
[45:07] that old serpent, the dragon, the devil.
[45:10] Why in the world would the Lord want us
[45:14] to have anything that would even closely
[45:18] resemble the serpent? But yet, we can
[45:21] see that trail as it goes down through
[45:24] the Bible. Why would God ever give to
[45:28] Moses
[45:30] a commandment, a word, to make a brass
[45:34] serpent and put it on a pole?
[45:38] And everyone that would look at that
[45:40] serpent would be healed and they'd live.
[45:43] the very thing that had a representation
[45:46] of evil from many many years prior to
[45:50] that in the book of Genesis. And yet God
[45:52] would have him to make something in that
[45:54] form. So when the mighty man Moses goes
[45:58] in before Pharaoh and God tells him cast
[46:01] down your rod and it won't become a
[46:03] cross,
[46:05] &gt;&gt; it won't become a piece of bread,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; but it will become what?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Serpent.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Serpent. So here comes Janice and
[46:13] Jambers and they throw their rods down
[46:15] and their rod becomes a serpent too. And
[46:19] what does Moses rod do? Serpent. It goes
[46:22] over and swallows both of them up.
[46:26] Brother Rem said, "Did you ever wonder
[46:27] where that those that serpent was? It
[46:30] was in Moses rod. He was carrying it
[46:32] around and he done miracles with it. And
[46:36] yet this symbolism of that serpent, he
[46:40] would go around and whenever he would
[46:42] have this their rods, serpents was on
[46:46] the inside of that one. And then the
[46:49] Lord Jesus of all the great things that
[46:51] he could have said, a similitude that he
[46:53] could have used would have been said,
[46:55] "Be wise like Solomon. Be wise like this
[46:59] man or that man." And yet he said, "Be
[47:02] as wise as serpents and as harmless as
[47:06] doves." And yet our Lord Jesus is
[47:09] teaching us that it must be a mixture of
[47:13] wisdom and innocency which will dwell
[47:17] together. Is wisdom altogether bad? No,
[47:20] not all together. And he doesn't want us
[47:23] to go through more things than what's
[47:26] absolutely necessary. And you probably
[47:29] like myself and probably lots of others,
[47:32] there's things that we have done even in
[47:35] trying to share the word that we've
[47:37] probably made it harder on ourselves and
[47:40] certain stands that we've took through
[47:43] the years. I want you to notice in 1
[47:45] Timothy chapter uh 2:2, for kings and
[47:49] for all that are in authority, that we
[47:51] may lead a quiet and peaceable life in
[47:56] all godliness and honesty. Oh, praise
[48:00] the Lord. That's an awesome verse of
[48:02] scripture. Let's read it again. for
[48:03] kings and for all that are in authority
[48:06] that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
[48:10] life in all godliness and honesty. And
[48:14] yet we know that the Lord wants us to be
[48:17] willing to lay our lives down as sheep.
[48:20] He wants us to be willing to give our
[48:23] lives even as doves as doves were
[48:26] accepted in the Old Testament as a sin
[48:29] offering. But he also wants us to have a
[48:32] mixture of wisdom that would be if you
[48:37] didn't look at it exactly right, it
[48:39] could seem that it was coming from the
[48:41] opposite side. But this is why that it
[48:44] needs to be mixed together with the
[48:47] nature of the dove. Now I want you to
[48:48] notice Jesus doesn't say for us to have
[48:52] the hiss of the serpent although some of
[48:55] us do. He doesn't want us to be as the
[48:59] Old Testament tells us that the viper or
[49:01] the adder will stop her ear. So the
[49:05] serpent was likened to someone who would
[49:08] stop their ear from hearing truth or
[49:12] correction. Jesus doesn't tell us to be
[49:15] like that. He doesn't tell us to be like
[49:19] the adder or the the nishhatan that
[49:22] would have the poison as it was in
[49:25] several places in the Old Testament. So
[49:28] he doesn't tell us to even be like that.
[49:30] And there's several attributes of the
[49:32] serpent that he could have used, but he
[49:35] picked the one that was a perfect match
[49:39] to that which the dove would need.
[49:42] Because a dove is a beautiful, beautiful
[49:44] bird, a beautiful creature of God, but
[49:47] she can be very dumb at times.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; She can be. She can be very dumb at
[49:54] times. She can actually get herself into
[49:57] danger and harm. I've seen them in with
[50:00] crocodiles and in Africa. And you'll
[50:03] watch them as they come down to the
[50:05] river. Now, the gems buck will come
[50:07] down. and even the elephant, which is
[50:09] much greater than the crocodile, and the
[50:11] little dick dick and all the different
[50:13] smaller animals that will be there. And
[50:15] they're so nervous and they're so
[50:17] jittery and they're just standing there
[50:19] and they're getting a drink and they'll
[50:20] raise their head and they'll get another
[50:22] drink and they'll raise their head and
[50:23] the doves will gather right there right
[50:26] where the crocodiles are and they'll
[50:27] just meander around and they'll coo to
[50:30] one another and they're just kind of
[50:32] playing around the water and here will
[50:34] come a crocodile right out of that water
[50:36] and grab a whole mouthful of them
[50:38] because they can tend to be so naive.
[50:43] Doves by their own nature can tend to be
[50:47] so naive and they are harmless. They
[50:50] they truly are harmless. But Jesus knew
[50:53] that sending forth his people into this
[50:57] world, not only then, but how much more
[50:59] now that they would also need an
[51:02] accompaniment that the dove nature alone
[51:05] would not be able to produce. And they
[51:08] would need something that would help
[51:10] them in dealing with this evil world. So
[51:14] they would be able to be spared
[51:16] unnecessary things which their own
[51:19] nature would lead them into because
[51:23] they're so kindhearted.
[51:26] So he said, "What I want you to do now,
[51:28] I want you to have this nature of the
[51:31] dove because that's who you are. You're
[51:34] my dove. You're my love. You're my
[51:36] undefiled, but I also want you to have
[51:40] something else that will help you in the
[51:42] wickedness and the darkness of this
[51:45] world. Now, let's read if you would in
[51:48] Matthew 22:1 17. Watch the Lord Jesus as
[51:53] he was confronted by a bunch of
[51:56] hypocritical
[51:58] religious people. Matthew 22:17,
[52:02] "Tell us therefore, what thinkkest thou?
[52:07] Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar
[52:12] or not?" Now, remember, there are Roman
[52:14] guards watching them. Now, these men
[52:19] think they're laying a trap for the Lord
[52:22] Jesus. So, anybody that does that today
[52:25] when they're trying to lay a trap for a
[52:27] prophet or a preacher or a Christian,
[52:31] you realize what side they're on?
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, tell us therefore, what
[52:37] thinkkest thou? Is it lawful to give
[52:40] tribute unto Caesar or not? But Jesus
[52:45] perceived their wickedness
[52:49] and said, "Why tempt you me, you
[52:53] hypocrites?"
[52:54] Whoa.
[52:56] But this is the lamb of God.
[52:59] This is the dove of God. But the dove of
[53:04] God now has a wisdom which is looking to
[53:08] the people who is asking these
[53:11] questions.
[53:12] And yet the Bible tells us in the book
[53:14] of Hebrews, we'll get to it a bit, that
[53:16] the Lord Jesus was harmless.
[53:20] Harmless means he never harmed them at
[53:22] all in body, in character, in
[53:25] reputation, or in property. So the Lord
[53:29] Jesus called people devils. He called
[53:32] them wicked. He called them evil. He
[53:35] called them hypocrites.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; And yet he was totally harmless. Yeah.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Now you see the difference is when God
[53:43] declares that by the word, it's not us
[53:46] doing that. It's us simply repeating
[53:49] what God said. But the tricky part is
[53:52] for us in the flesh not to take such
[53:56] scriptures and such quotes and try to
[53:59] get back at people ourself in our own
[54:02] spirit. You see, that's when it becomes
[54:06] sinful and wrong. Now watch what the
[54:09] Lord Jesus responds. But Jesus perceived
[54:12] their wickedness and said, "Why tempt
[54:14] you me, you hypocrites?" Wow.
[54:18] Why tempt you me, you hypocrites? Show
[54:21] me the tribute money. And they brought
[54:24] unto him a penny. And he saith unto
[54:27] them, Whose is the image and
[54:31] superscription?
[54:33] And they say unto him, Caesars's. Then
[54:36] saith he unto them, render therefore
[54:39] unto Caesar the things which are Caesar,
[54:42] and unto God the things that are God's.
[54:47] Now notice their response. And when they
[54:50] heard these words, they marveled
[54:55] and left him and went their way. Now, it
[55:00] wasn't the dove that actually brought
[55:03] this great intimate wisdom, but it was
[55:06] that part which he was giving us an
[55:09] example of what we would learn and need
[55:12] to know how to do when we are dealing
[55:15] also with hypocrites.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. When we are dealing
[55:20] with modern-day Pharisees and sad, you
[55:24] see, and they truly are sad, you see,
[55:27] but we need more than just the dove
[55:31] nature. Now, listen to me carefully this
[55:33] morning. Watch Paul in Acts 9 22. Paul
[55:39] increased the moral strength and
[55:41] confounded the Jews which dwelt at
[55:44] Damascus, proving that he is the very
[55:48] Christ. talking about the Lord Jesus.
[55:50] And after that, many days were
[55:52] fulfilled. The Jews took counsel to kill
[55:56] him. Okay? Now, we're not talking about
[55:59] infidels. We're not talking about
[56:01] heathens, but we're talking about
[56:04] supposedly the most religious people
[56:07] that were alive in that day. We're
[56:10] talking about people that said they were
[56:12] following Moses, the Jews. And yet they
[56:15] were seeking counsel to kill this man.
[56:20] My my isn't it amazing how religious
[56:22] people can get murderous spirits on
[56:24] them.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Now whether they want to kill you
[56:27] physically or they just want to kill
[56:29] your reputation or your character or
[56:31] your name, it's still the same spirit of
[56:34] murder.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; And the church said
[56:37] &gt;&gt; and after that many days are fulfilled.
[56:40] The Jews took counsel to kill him. But
[56:43] they're laying away. Now watch what
[56:45] they're doing. They're hiding and
[56:47] they're laying awake for this man. The
[56:50] most religious people in the land are
[56:54] laying in weight to commit murder
[56:57] against a man for what? Stealing. A man
[57:00] who took their wives. A man who molested
[57:03] their children. A man who proved that
[57:05] Jesus was the Christ from the Bible. You
[57:09] see, that's one of the things that makes
[57:11] the devil in his utmost anger is when
[57:14] the Christ, the anointed word for the
[57:17] age you're living is proven by the
[57:20] Bible. It still makes people want to
[57:22] kill you to this very day.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Now, notice the laying of weight was
[57:27] known of Saul and they watch the gates
[57:31] day and night to kill him. I mean, these
[57:34] people are determined. They've got
[57:36] somebody. They're having shifts and
[57:38] they're changing out shifts and they are
[57:41] ready and they're going to kill this
[57:42] preacher as soon as he walks through the
[57:44] door. Now notice, and the disciples took
[57:48] him by night and led him down by the
[57:52] wall
[57:54] in a basket.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, isn't he running?
[58:01] Is he portraying the attitude of a
[58:03] coward?
[58:05] Doesn't he believe God can protect him?
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Now, what if Paul would done maybe like
[58:11] some of us? Glory to God. I AIN'T
[58:13] AFRAID. I'LL WALK RIGHT OUT THERE.
[58:15] HALLELUJAH. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. You
[58:17] see, that's where sometimes we need this
[58:19] wisdom that Jesus was talking about.
[58:22] Now, the Lord is going to let him go
[58:24] through a lot of things in the remaining
[58:26] portion of his life, but this just
[58:29] happened to be not one of them. Isn't it
[58:32] amazing how that if we're not careful,
[58:35] we will accept certain things of the
[58:37] devil and we will misidentify it as a
[58:41] trial from God and the devil is laughing
[58:44] at us.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Now watch. After Paul and Silas were
[58:51] beaten and thrown in jail, we're all
[58:53] familiar with this of course in Acts
[58:55] 16:35. And when it was day, the
[58:58] magistrate sent the sergeants saying,
[59:01] "Let those men go." Now, you remember
[59:03] the story, the spirit of God come in
[59:05] there and shook the day, the jail. And
[59:07] boy, I mean, they had a time. And then
[59:10] the magistrates, they sent word the next
[59:12] morning to the sergeants, which is
[59:14] watching them. And the keeper of the
[59:16] prison told this, saying to Paul, "The
[59:18] magistrates said to you to let you go.
[59:21] Now therefore, depart and go in peace."
[59:25] And Paul said unto them, "They have
[59:27] beaten us openly unconddemned,
[59:31] being Romans."
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I find this amazing because he never
[59:38] said this to the Christian church when
[59:41] he was preaching to them.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; But Paul has tapped into this wisdom.
[59:48] Now, now watch him. Being Romans, and
[59:53] have cast us into prison, and now do
[59:57] they thrust us out privy?
[1:00:00] Nay, verily, but let them come
[1:00:05] themselves
[1:00:07] and fetch us out. So apparently the
[1:00:11] spirit of God wanted the magistrates
[1:00:14] humbled
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; humbled before these servants of God. I
[1:00:21] don't mind telling you. I love that when
[1:00:23] the Lord does that.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; AND THEY ALSO had broke lo Roman law
[1:00:30] which was called portion law.
[1:00:34] Portion law. IT WAS AGAINST ROMAN LAW
[1:00:38] FOR ANY Roman citizen to be beaten. It
[1:00:43] was against portion law for any Roman
[1:00:46] citizen to be chained in hands or
[1:00:50] feeders around his feet. AND YET GOD IS
[1:00:54] NOW GOING TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND
[1:00:56] WHAT IS it that taps in? Do you really
[1:00:58] think the dove wanted to be identified
[1:01:01] as a Roman dove?
[1:01:04] You think it wanted to be identified
[1:01:06] THAT IT WAS A DOVE OF GOD LEADING PAUL,
[1:01:08] but all of a sudden something must have
[1:01:10] quickened him. Tap into your Roman
[1:01:13] citizenship, Paul. NOW, NOTICE, SO THE
[1:01:16] MAJESTY of the Roman Empire is now going
[1:01:20] to be humiliated by these people, which
[1:01:22] supposedly are magistrates under the
[1:01:25] Roman headship. And Paul said, "We are
[1:01:28] not leaving. Tell them big boys, them
[1:01:31] ones that done all the blabbering, the
[1:01:33] ones that give all the orders, tell them
[1:01:35] to come and walk in here and escort us
[1:01:40] out
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; lest I pick up my cell phone and call
[1:01:47] Caesar himself.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; You see, GOD DON'T WANT HIS CHILDREN
[1:01:55] STUPID.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:01:59] A lot of us are stupid. I wish we
[1:02:01] wasn't, but we are.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE THINK THEY WANT TO BECOME A
[1:02:07] MARTYR. I personally don't want to
[1:02:09] become a martyr. I may be one one day,
[1:02:11] but I want to live as long as the Lord
[1:02:13] will let me live. I want to be here and
[1:02:15] preach and do everything I can. But some
[1:02:17] folks have that mentality. It's like
[1:02:19] THEY WANT PERSECUTION. THEY do things to
[1:02:22] bring it on them. You're missing this
[1:02:24] element, friends. you know, missing this
[1:02:27] element and desire. I've seen preachers
[1:02:29] do exactly the same thing and go on the
[1:02:31] mission field and wherever was the most
[1:02:33] dangerous part was the part they felt
[1:02:36] they wanted to go into and wind up
[1:02:38] getting in trouble. I've seen it with
[1:02:41] brothers going overseas AND BECOME SO
[1:02:44] DEFIANT ABOUT THE laws of their land and
[1:02:48] looking for trouble and I've also seen
[1:02:50] them get in trouble because of it. Now,
[1:02:54] you know that Paul, I don't believe that
[1:02:56] he's doing this just out of pride and
[1:02:57] arrogance, but remember there's a young
[1:03:00] infant church here in Philippi. And Paul
[1:03:04] has been identified now with that
[1:03:07] church. So, this might be able to buy
[1:03:10] them a little bit of protection in the
[1:03:13] future once they realize the bishop of
[1:03:16] this church here is a Roman guy. Now, he
[1:03:19] wasn't Roman Catholic. He was Roman. So
[1:03:22] they said, "You know what? Oh man, we
[1:03:23] better leave that church alone. That
[1:03:25] Paul guy may come back down here and
[1:03:27] we'll really be IN TROUBLE." NOW, YOU
[1:03:29] KNOW, GOD CAN use the law of the land
[1:03:32] sometimes to our advantage and for our
[1:03:35] protection. And the church says,
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; watch in verse 38, "And the sergeants
[1:03:41] told these words unto the magistrates,
[1:03:44] and they feared." Isn't it amazing? They
[1:03:47] didn't fear when they found out they're
[1:03:49] Christians. They didn't fear when they
[1:03:51] found out there preachers. They didn't
[1:03:53] fear when they told them those Holy
[1:03:55] Ghost men of God didn't do one thing to
[1:03:57] them. They probably laughed at them. But
[1:03:59] when they found out they were Roman
[1:04:01] citizens, it put the shake in their
[1:04:03] boots.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Notice and they feared when they heard
[1:04:10] that they were Romans.
[1:04:13] AND THEY CAME AND BESOUGHT them and
[1:04:16] brought them out and desired them to
[1:04:19] depart. We're so sorry. Please don't
[1:04:22] tell don't tell nobody we so sorry.
[1:04:25] Okay.
[1:04:28] Imagine Paul might have milked it a
[1:04:30] little bit.
[1:04:32] They went OUT OF THE PRISON and entered
[1:04:34] into the house of Lydia. And when they
[1:04:37] had seen the brethren, they comforted
[1:04:39] them and departed. NOW WATCH AGAIN PAUL
[1:04:43] using this Roman citizenship
[1:04:46] and being able to do this why unfair
[1:04:50] unfair just absolutely contrary to the
[1:04:53] Lord said this is not right somebody
[1:04:55] must have received a revelation from God
[1:04:57] this is not me Paul I manifested myself
[1:05:00] but I WANT YOU TO THROW IT RIGHT BACK IN
[1:05:02] THEIR L I WANT YOU TO cause them to
[1:05:04] sweat
[1:05:06] notice in Acts 22:25
[1:05:08] and as they bound him Paul again with
[1:05:11] tongs Paul said unto the centurion that
[1:05:13] stood by,
[1:05:16] "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man
[1:05:21] that is a Roman
[1:05:24] and unconddemned?"
[1:05:26] Now watch him this time. He asked it in
[1:05:30] the form of a question. NOW IT'S NOT
[1:05:32] THAT HE DON'T KNOW. He knows the law AND
[1:05:35] IT'S NOT THAT HE'S finding out
[1:05:37] information, but he chooses to unveil
[1:05:40] himself his rights. So he puts it to
[1:05:43] this guy in the form of a question. And
[1:05:46] when the centurion heard that, he went
[1:05:49] and told the chief captain, saying,
[1:05:51] "Take heed WHAT THOU DOEST, FOR THIS MAN
[1:05:56] IS a Roman."
[1:06:01] Then the chief captain came and said,
[1:06:04] "Tell me, are you a Holy Ghost fil
[1:06:07] preacher? Are you a CHRISTIAN THAT'S
[1:06:09] BEEN BAPTIZED in the name OF THE LORD
[1:06:11] JESUS? I'M SCARED TO DEATH OF YOU IF
[1:06:14] YOU'VE GOT THE HOLY GHOST."
[1:06:19] What are they doing? Using what God
[1:06:21] gives them to be able to calm the enemy
[1:06:25] down. Praise the Lord. Ain't it amazing?
[1:06:28] Most of us that never considered this
[1:06:30] spiritual would. I'm gonna tell you one
[1:06:32] thing, friend. If it ever comes to a
[1:06:35] spot that our nation wants to shut our
[1:06:37] doors and wants to make it illegal to do
[1:06:40] preaching and baptism and all that sort
[1:06:43] of thing, you better believe if I have
[1:06:45] to, I'll get a lawyer.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; I'll get somebody that can go with me
[1:06:51] and stand right there and say,
[1:06:52] "According to the Constitution, it's his
[1:06:55] right to preach this. If I want to
[1:06:57] preach Humpty Dumpty as God, if I want
[1:06:59] to preach Donald Duck as God, I should
[1:07:02] have a right as an American citizen.
[1:07:04] Come on, somebody. And yet people say,
[1:07:06] "Oh, no, no, no. That that ain't nothing
[1:07:08] spiritual." I I disagree with you. As
[1:07:11] long as our rights, and we're standing
[1:07:13] right on the promise of the word of God,
[1:07:16] we ought to stand up and claim what's
[1:07:18] ours. You're letting the devil pull the
[1:07:20] wool over you. You're letting the devil
[1:07:22] convince you that some of the things you
[1:07:24] go through is God whipping you and God
[1:07:27] trying you when it ain't nothing but the
[1:07:28] devil robbing you of healing, ROBBING
[1:07:31] YOU OF JOY, ROBBING YOU and your family
[1:07:34] and your children. Well, I I know my
[1:07:37] children's just got to go astray. And
[1:07:39] who told you THAT LIE? THEY DO NOT HAVE
[1:07:42] TO GO ASTRAY. WELL, BROTHER DONNIE, WHAT
[1:07:44] IF THEY DO? WELL, IF THEY DO, YOU hold
[1:07:46] on to them with PRAYER AND BELIEVE GOD'S
[1:07:48] GOING TO GET MAD. WELL, MAYBE THEY'VE
[1:07:50] GOT TO SEW WILD OATS. And where does the
[1:07:52] scripture say that? I'd rather for them
[1:07:54] to be right here full of the Holy GHOST
[1:07:56] AND SIT OUT THERE sewing a bunch of wild
[1:07:59] oats and have to reap the rest of their
[1:08:01] life. Come on, CHILDREN. OUR CHILDREN
[1:08:03] ARE OUR INHERITANCE. Peace is our
[1:08:06] inheritance. JOY IS OUR INHERITANCE. WHY
[1:08:09] GIVE IT UP? YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH
[1:08:10] TRIALS the way it is.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:08:16] THE CHIEF CAPTAIN CAME AND SAID UNTO
[1:08:18] HIM, "TELL ME, ART THOU A ROMAN?" HE
[1:08:21] SAID, "YAY."
[1:08:24] The chief captain answered with a great
[1:08:26] sum,
[1:08:28] obtained out this freedom. Now, they
[1:08:30] would sell Roman citizenship because it
[1:08:34] had certain rights, friends, benefits.
[1:08:37] So, they sold it for tremendous amounts
[1:08:40] OF MONEY. AND THIS GUY BOUGHT his
[1:08:44] citizenship.
[1:08:45] And the chief captain answered with a
[1:08:47] great sum obtained out of HIS FREEDOM.
[1:08:49] AND PAUL SAID, "BUT I WAS FREEBORN." In
[1:08:52] other words, his grandfather, his
[1:08:54] father, his greatgrandfather, someone in
[1:08:57] his lineage paid this price because they
[1:09:00] were Jews. SO THEY BOUGHT THIS ROMAN
[1:09:04] CITIZENSHIP. And once they bought it,
[1:09:06] then every son or daughter that was born
[1:09:09] thereafter was freeborn. Oh, I like that
[1:09:12] cuz that's the way I was. I was lost.
[1:09:15] Hallelujah. And my LORD JESUS BOUGHT MY
[1:09:18] CITIZENSHIP. So everyone born after the
[1:09:22] new birth, you're freeborn.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEREFORE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY
[1:09:27] YOUR citizenship in the kingdom of God
[1:09:30] today. You're a freeborn son or daughter
[1:09:33] of God.
[1:09:35] Notice then straightway they departed
[1:09:37] from him which should have examined him
[1:09:40] and the chief captain also
[1:09:45] a
[1:09:47] was afraid. So it was probably the dove,
[1:09:49] right? The dove was coupooing and when
[1:09:51] the devil
[1:09:54] and that captain just that shivers up my
[1:09:57] back I can't stand that. Oh that scares
[1:10:00] me to death. No, Roman citizenship.
[1:10:08] This is mindboggling. I know. Go ahead
[1:10:10] and agree to it. Notice this. And
[1:10:12] straightway they departed from him which
[1:10:14] should have examined him. Now, WHENEVER
[1:10:16] THEY FIND THIS OUT, THEY SAID, "OH,
[1:10:17] you're good. You're good. We we don't
[1:10:20] have no questions."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; So, it was the Holy Ghost, his office as
[1:10:25] a prophet that released him. Roman
[1:10:27] citizenship.
[1:10:30] Praise the Lord. AND THE CHIEF CAPTAIN
[1:10:33] also was afraid after he knew that he
[1:10:36] was a Roman and because he had bound
[1:10:39] him.
[1:10:42] Another instance, chapter 23:6.
[1:10:45] AND WHEN PAUL PERCEIVED THAT ONE PART
[1:10:47] WERE Sadducees
[1:10:50] and the other Pharisees,
[1:10:52] HE CRIED OUT IN THE COUNCIL, "MEN AND
[1:10:56] BRETHREN,
[1:10:58] I am a
[1:11:03] Pharisee." Now, I wonder what the
[1:11:05] churches would have thought if he would
[1:11:07] have got in the pullpit and said those
[1:11:10] exact same words.
[1:11:14] Now, HE DIDN'T SAY I WAS before my NEW
[1:11:18] BIRTH, BUT HE SAID I am.
[1:11:23] Praise the Lord. Where is this wisdom
[1:11:26] coming from? WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM TO
[1:11:28] GIVE HIM TO know to SAY THE RIGHT WORD?
[1:11:30] HE wouldn't said this to the saints of
[1:11:32] God. Now, children of God, I'm a
[1:11:34] Pharisee. That said, you still are. You
[1:11:37] You're going to preach to us. We're a
[1:11:39] message church. I mean, we don't want no
[1:11:42] Pharisees IN HERE. BUT PAUL SAID THEN
[1:11:44] SAID, "I AM A PHARISEE,
[1:11:48] the son of a Pharisee." Hallelujah.
[1:11:53] Of the hope and resurrection of the
[1:11:57] dead,
[1:11:59] I am called in question.
[1:12:02] And when he had so said, there arose a
[1:12:06] dissension between the Pharisees and the
[1:12:10] Sadducees
[1:12:12] and the multitude was divided. Now, wait
[1:12:14] a minute. I DIDN'T THINK GOD was the
[1:12:16] author of confusion.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Friends, we would be better off to spend
[1:12:23] a whole lot more time reading our Bible.
[1:12:26] Forget Instagram. Forget Facebook.
[1:12:29] forget a lot of this stuff that we
[1:12:31] consume oursel with. It's all in the
[1:12:33] Bible.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; NOW, YOU IMAGINE THIS MAN LOOKS OUT
[1:12:37] THERE AND THE WISDOM THAT JESUS SPOKE
[1:12:40] about and he looks and sees, ah, there's
[1:12:43] some two soul people. There's some seven
[1:12:46] thunder people. There's this, there's
[1:12:48] that. There's that. AND HE SAID, "GLORY
[1:12:51] TO GOD, I'M A PHARISEE."
[1:12:55] ONE OF THEM Pharisees that praise the
[1:12:57] Lord. PRAISE THE LORD. IT'S BECAUSE of
[1:13:01] the resurrection.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; He just didn't tell him the resurrection
[1:13:06] of who?
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Now, why was he here? Cuz he's preaching
[1:13:10] Jesus had raised from the dead. But he
[1:13:12] left that part out.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Well, if this don't do nothing else,
[1:13:21] it's going to get y'all to at least
[1:13:22] reading these scriptures again, WON'T
[1:13:24] IT? I AM A PHARISEE AND MY DADDY WAS A
[1:13:29] PHARISEE AND THE REASON I'M CALLED AND
[1:13:31] QUESTIONED TODAY IS BECAUSE OF THE
[1:13:33] RESURRECTION of the dead. Now the
[1:13:34] Pharisees believed in a resurrection.
[1:13:36] The Sadducees didn't believe in a
[1:13:38] physical resurrection nor in angels nor
[1:13:41] spirits or anything like that. So the
[1:13:43] Pharisees said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1:13:45] whoa, WHOA, WHOA. THIS IS OUR BROTHER.
[1:13:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:50] LET'S RALLY AROUND HIM."
[1:13:52] SO THEN THE Pharisees go to debating
[1:13:54] with the Sadducees. So they drag out
[1:13:56] their favorite quotes. I'll tell you one
[1:13:58] thing the prophet of God said right
[1:14:00] here. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD, YEAH, BUT
[1:14:02] YOU CAN'T TAKE IT THAT WAY. AND THERE
[1:14:04] THEY GO, ONE ANOTHER. AND Paul just
[1:14:06] stand smiling. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT,
[1:14:08] WHAT WAS IT? THE DOVE WISDOM.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Of a serpent.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; That's hard for me to say that too,
[1:14:18] friends. I know.
[1:14:20] And when HE HAD SO SAID, there arose of
[1:14:23] dissension between the Pharisees and the
[1:14:25] Sadducees, and the multitude was
[1:14:29] divided.
[1:14:31] SO HE GOT ALL THE Pharisees
[1:14:34] on his side.
[1:14:37] Wow.
[1:14:40] Most generally, I wouldn't think that
[1:14:41] would be a very good idea,
[1:14:44] but in this situation, it actually
[1:14:46] panned out pretty good.
[1:14:49] Now notice AS I WAS STUDYING on this
[1:14:52] scripture and I looked through all the
[1:14:55] of course all the scriptures about
[1:14:57] wisdom and every word serpent serpents
[1:15:00] and and all of that. Also looking up
[1:15:03] about harmless and blameless and you
[1:15:08] know gless and and all that that the
[1:15:10] people of God was going to be. And I
[1:15:13] found these next statements that I'm
[1:15:15] going to share with you in a Bible
[1:15:16] encyclopedia which I thought was
[1:15:18] absolutely awesome. WE MUST HAVE
[1:15:21] INNOCENCE WITH our wisdom or our wisdom
[1:15:25] is but craftiness.
[1:15:28] We must have wisdom with our innocence
[1:15:31] or our innocence is but weakness.
[1:15:35] We must have the innocence of the dove
[1:15:38] that WE WILL NOT HARM OTHERS. We must
[1:15:41] have the wisdom of the serpent
[1:15:44] that we may not harm ourselves. WE MUST
[1:15:47] HAVE THE INNOCENCE OF THE DOVE that we
[1:15:50] won't betray the truth and the wisdom of
[1:15:53] the serpent that we won't betray
[1:15:56] ourselves. INNOCENCE WITHOUT WISDOM is
[1:16:00] too weak to be safe. Wisdom without
[1:16:04] innocence is too subtle to be good.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Woo! Help me Jesus. Anybody say it? Help
[1:16:13] me Lord.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Help me Lord. Now I WANT YOU TO NOTICE
[1:16:17] ANOTHER ASPECT about about the serpent
[1:16:20] that one of the things that the serpent
[1:16:23] has a chief a chief principle and a care
[1:16:28] and his own good and his own benefit is
[1:16:32] that a serpent will watch his head. Now
[1:16:37] listen, a serpent will watch his head.
[1:16:41] Now, for those of you that have ever
[1:16:43] seen, you know, in in in life or seen it
[1:16:45] on video to WHERE THAT A A dog will
[1:16:48] attack a snake or a you know, different
[1:16:50] different animals that will and whenever
[1:16:52] they go to get really close and as long
[1:16:54] as that that snake will feel that he's
[1:16:56] in good um offensive position, then he
[1:16:59] WILL STAND RIGHT UP AND DO WHATEVER he's
[1:17:01] supposed to do. But if he ever goes to
[1:17:03] feeling that he's overwhelmed, then one
[1:17:06] of the things that he will do first is
[1:17:09] that that serpent will hide his head. So
[1:17:13] then if the animal of the bongoose or
[1:17:16] whatever it is will come toward him, he
[1:17:18] will take the rest of his body and he
[1:17:21] will try to enshroud or cover his head.
[1:17:25] Now, he might he can live if you
[1:17:26] actually cut part of his tail off, but
[1:17:28] you go to remove that head from the
[1:17:31] body, he's a dead snake. In his head is
[1:17:35] his sinking. In his head is his eyes. In
[1:17:39] his head, of course, is his mouth. SO,
[1:17:41] IT'S SUCH a vital thing. In his head, so
[1:17:46] he will protect his head. And I I look
[1:17:49] at that and I THINK, YOU KNOW, I WONDER
[1:17:51] ABOUT us as well in the sense that if
[1:17:54] we're not pretty open and pretty loose
[1:17:57] when it comes to us protecting our head.
[1:18:00] By that I mean what you think about,
[1:18:03] what you read, WHAT YOU CONTEMPLATE ON.
[1:18:07] NOTICE THIS IN ISAIAH 26:3.
[1:18:10] THOU WILL KEEP him in perfect peace
[1:18:13] whose mind is stayed on thee. THOU WILL
[1:18:18] KEEP him in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:18:22] stayed. Now, not an occasional visit on
[1:18:25] the Lord. Not, you know, on Sundays and
[1:18:28] on Wednesdays and then maybe once again
[1:18:30] every now and then, you know, every
[1:18:31] other day of the week, BUT THOU WILL
[1:18:33] KEEP HIM in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:18:37] stayed on thee. And we know that the
[1:18:40] battleground is not the eyes. The
[1:18:42] battleground is not the ears, but the
[1:18:44] battleground is the mind. Notice in 1
[1:18:47] Corinthians chapter 13:4, charity
[1:18:50] suffereth long and is kind. Charity
[1:18:53] envious not. Charity vaunteth not
[1:18:56] itself. Is not puffed up. Oh my. Dust
[1:19:00] behave itself. Thus not behave itself
[1:19:03] unseemly.
[1:19:05] Sekest not her own. is not easily
[1:19:07] provoked, thinkketh no evil. So charity,
[1:19:12] a heart filled with charity will bring
[1:19:15] into obedience every thought that is
[1:19:19] contrary to the spirit of God, so that
[1:19:22] it will not think evil, casting down
[1:19:24] imaginations, and every high thing that
[1:19:27] is itself against the knowledge of God,
[1:19:30] and bringing into captivity
[1:19:34] every thought to the obedience of
[1:19:37] Christ. NOW PEOPLE SAY, "WELL, I I I
[1:19:39] keep I HAVE NO CONTROL in my mind." I
[1:19:42] agree with that to to a CERTAIN DEGREE.
[1:19:45] YOU CANNOT KEEP THE birds from flying
[1:19:49] over, but you can stop them from
[1:19:51] building a nest. SO WHEN SATAN WILL PUT
[1:19:55] THOUGHTS IN YOUR mind that are contrary
[1:19:58] to the word of God and what God tells
[1:20:00] you about yourself, it's up to you as a
[1:20:04] child of God to bring into captivity
[1:20:08] that thought AND DO NOT LET THAT THOUGHT
[1:20:11] propagate itself in the womb of your
[1:20:15] mind because thoughts are seeds. Now
[1:20:18] then then Satan will put a thought in
[1:20:20] your mind, God don't love you. You know,
[1:20:22] he won't move for you, he won't heal
[1:20:24] you, whatever it is that you're dealing
[1:20:25] with. And then that seed has the ability
[1:20:29] to propagate itself in the womb of your
[1:20:32] mind. Remember when the prophet preached
[1:20:34] the spoken word's original seed and on
[1:20:36] part one, he said, "Now this afternoon,
[1:20:37] we'll get to the two wombs." And he did.
[1:20:40] So there's a womb in your mind and then
[1:20:42] of course there's one in your in the
[1:20:43] body. BUT YOU KNOW, SATAN KNOWS EXACTLY
[1:20:46] HOW TO bring his thoughts into the mind.
[1:20:50] Well, it's been a long time since you
[1:20:51] felt God and you don't know. You don't
[1:20:53] know where you stand on this and you're
[1:20:55] confused on that. Nobody loves you. God
[1:20:57] don't love you. The church don't love
[1:20:59] you. The pastor sure don't love you. And
[1:21:00] all these are seeds that Satan's
[1:21:03] planting inside of our mind. But are we
[1:21:06] going to protect our head? Or are we
[1:21:09] going to let our head, our mind become
[1:21:12] an open womb by which Satan will sew all
[1:21:15] of these thoughts of discord and doubt
[1:21:19] and all these things in there to try to
[1:21:21] propagate his own move, which is of
[1:21:24] course what he wants to do. BUT PAUL
[1:21:26] SAID, "BRINGING into captivity every
[1:21:30] thought to the obedience of Christ."
[1:21:33] Philippians 2:5, "Let this mind be in
[1:21:37] you which was also in Christ Jesus." Is
[1:21:40] it attainable?
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't attainable, the Bible
[1:21:44] wouldn't have said for us to do it.
[1:21:45] Philippians 4:8. Finally, brethren,
[1:21:49] whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
[1:21:52] things are honest, whatsoever things are
[1:21:55] just, whatsoever things are pure,
[1:21:58] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
[1:22:01] things ARE OF A GOOD REPORT, if there be
[1:22:04] any virtue, oh my, and there be any
[1:22:09] praise, think on these things. And the
[1:22:13] church said,
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; How many has a hard time doing that
[1:22:17] though?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Why? Satan wants to have us so busy. AND
[1:22:22] WE'VE GOT SO MANY PROBLEMS in life and
[1:22:24] issues in life. And most of us have
[1:22:26] probably got more things than we've ever
[1:22:28] had in our life. And all the things that
[1:22:31] we have require work and maintenance and
[1:22:33] thought and this and that and the other.
[1:22:35] AND IT'S NOT THAT our minds are occupied
[1:22:37] by sinful things many times, BUT IT'S
[1:22:39] JUST THINGS. SO WE CROWD OUT THE ability
[1:22:42] to think on whatsoever things are
[1:22:44] lovely. WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE GOOD,
[1:22:46] WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE JUST, WHATSOEVER
[1:22:48] THINGS are of a good report, and what
[1:22:50] the praise of God, the goodness of God,
[1:22:52] the move OF GOD, WHAT GOD'S DOING. JUST
[1:22:54] THINK ABOUT THAT INSTEAD OF THINKING,
[1:22:56] "OH, THIS ONE'S SICK. THAT ONE'S SICK.
[1:22:58] THAT ONE'S SICK. THAT ONE'S SICK." GOD
[1:23:00] WANTS US TO REMEMBER THAT. But he also
[1:23:03] wants us to remember the ones that he's
[1:23:05] healed in our assembly. He don't WANT US
[1:23:08] JUST TO THINK ABOUT those that are sick
[1:23:10] now. HE WANTS US TO POINT BACK AND look
[1:23:12] at those that's been healed of cancer,
[1:23:14] those that have been healed with all
[1:23:16] kinds of sickness and disease. And the
[1:23:18] church said, "SAME IN YOUR LIFE." SATAN
[1:23:21] WANTS YOU TO FOCUS ON THE TROUBLE YOU'RE
[1:23:24] DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW. HE DOES NOT WANT
[1:23:26] YOU TO REMEMBER ALL THE TIMES THAT GOD
[1:23:29] delivered you already. Oh, I wish
[1:23:31] somebody would preach with ME THIS
[1:23:32] MORNING. HE DON'T WANT YOU GOING BACK
[1:23:34] AND THINKING, "BOY, THE LORD DONE THIS
[1:23:36] and the Lord done that and the Lord done
[1:23:37] that." BECAUSE THAT EXCITES faith and
[1:23:41] brings faith to that next phase. So, he
[1:23:43] wants to just have you all bogged down
[1:23:45] by your failures. Well, you messed up
[1:23:48] again. You honestly THINK GOD'S GOING TO
[1:23:50] forgive you. You messed up. THIS IS NOT
[1:23:52] RIGHT. THAT ain't right. What? Sure.
[1:23:54] There's things that rattles us that's
[1:23:56] NOT RIGHT. BUT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED to
[1:23:58] dwell on them DAY AND NIGHT. COME ON,
[1:24:00] SOMEBODY. LOOK, FRIEND, I'm in enough
[1:24:02] contact with people around the world.
[1:24:04] Just our own church is enough to drive a
[1:24:06] man nuts, much less all the people
[1:24:08] around the world that I'm in contact
[1:24:10] with with prayer requests and all these
[1:24:12] things. IF THE LORD DIDN'T HELP ME, I
[1:24:14] WOULD BE AS NUTTY AS a Looney Tune. I
[1:24:16] WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT MY NAME IS. AND
[1:24:18] I HAVE TO FIND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN
[1:24:20] SICKNESS AND TROUBLE AND HEARTACHE and
[1:24:23] disappointment. And at THE SAME TIME,
[1:24:25] NOT LET THAT DEVIL ROB MY JOY WITH THE
[1:24:28] needs of the people that I love. so much
[1:24:31] and THE PEOPLE OF GOD THAT I WANT TO SEE
[1:24:34] COME TO THAT PLACE IN HIM AND EACH OF US
[1:24:36] HAVE TO FIND THAT PLACE OURSELF IN
[1:24:39] CHRIST JESUS THAT the Lord helps us. ARE
[1:24:42] WE CONCERNED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER? WE ARE.
[1:24:45] ARE WE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SIGNS OF THE
[1:24:47] TIMES? WE ARE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE SO
[1:24:50] OVERWHELMED I GO AROUND WITH A BIG LONG
[1:24:52] FACE. I DON'T WANT TO BE SO OVERWHELMED
[1:24:54] BY ALL THE TROUBLE AND THE SADNESS AND
[1:24:56] THE SICKNESS AND THE TROUBLE THAT I
[1:24:58] FORGET THAT THE JOY OF THE LORD IS MY
[1:25:01] STRENGTH. HALLELUJAH. LET THE PEOPLE OH,
[1:25:04] HALLELUJAH. WHOSE GOD IS THE LORD. WE
[1:25:07] NEED TO PRAISE HIM AND REJOICE AND WHAT
[1:25:10] he's doing.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; OH, THANK GOD. NOTICE THIS. IN the
[1:25:15] greatest battle ever fought, THE PROPHET
[1:25:17] SAID THAT'S THE MAIN THING. SO, there's
[1:25:20] your battleground. Your battleground is
[1:25:22] back HERE IN THE BEGINNING, BACK in the
[1:25:24] soul or back in the mind that opens. The
[1:25:27] mind is the gate to the soul. And then
[1:25:29] he says the spirit rather your mind
[1:25:32] opens up and accepts the spirit or
[1:25:36] rejects the spirit. You can have little
[1:25:40] conscience, little feelings, little
[1:25:42] sensations and all these things that has
[1:25:44] nothing to do with it. That just little
[1:25:46] sensation. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO REALITY,
[1:25:50] YOUR MIND OPENS IT UP. Your mind either
[1:25:54] accepts it or rejects it. That's it,
[1:25:57] friends. God, let none of them miss it.
[1:25:59] Oh my, I say the same thing, Lord. Don't
[1:26:02] let them miss it. IT'S YOUR MIND THAT
[1:26:04] OPENS up the door or closes the door. WE
[1:26:09] NEED TO PROTECT OUR HEAD.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And listens to your conscience.
[1:26:16] listens to your memory, LISTENS TO YOUR
[1:26:19] AFFECTION. BUT WHEN YOUR MIND closes
[1:26:22] itself, listen to this church, to these
[1:26:24] things. And let GOD AND THE SPIRIT OF
[1:26:28] THE WORD COME IN, listen what it does.
[1:26:30] It blows the rest of the stuff out. That
[1:26:34] sounds like dynamite TO ME. IT BLOWS THE
[1:26:38] REST OF THE STUFF OUT. SO IT DON'T JUST
[1:26:40] KINDLY AND COURTEOUSLY open the door and
[1:26:42] say, "Would you care to leave, Mr.
[1:26:44] Doubt? Would you care to leave, Mr.
[1:26:46] Fear? BUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD TAKES A HOLD
[1:26:49] OF THAT WORD AND IN YOUR mind you think
[1:26:52] about it. You praise it. The next thing
[1:26:53] you know, you're going to feel a little
[1:26:55] bit better THAN YOU DID BEFORE. WHY?
[1:26:57] BECAUSE THE WOMB of your mind has
[1:27:00] brought THE SEED OF GOD'S PROMISED WORD
[1:27:02] IN THERE. AND IT COMES WITH AN
[1:27:04] attachment to our emotions. Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Now, I know some of you the only emotion
[1:27:10] you have is when your son or daughter or
[1:27:13] grandson or granddaughter is playing
[1:27:16] soccer or ball
[1:27:19] because you have no emotions, right? But
[1:27:23] your granddaughter and she just does
[1:27:25] whatever it is she's doing and
[1:27:26] everybody's around you and you're just
[1:27:28] saying, "I don't have any emotions.
[1:27:32] I'm a very laidback, quiet person."
[1:27:36] Come on.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; You lying between your teeth. What you
[1:27:39] doing?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; If we COULD REJOICE AND JUMP AND HOLLER
[1:27:46] BECAUSE one of our kids or whoever more
[1:27:48] hits a baseball or or a softball or, YOU
[1:27:51] KNOW, BASKETBALL, WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE
[1:27:53] DOING. And what are you doing that for?
[1:27:55] Cuz you want to show them your support.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; What about when a man of God is
[1:28:00] preaching the word?
[1:28:03] Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT THE LORD JESUS? WHEN HE COMES
[1:28:08] AMONG US, DO WE WANT TO SHOW HIM OUR
[1:28:10] SUPPORT
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; or do we want to give him our snores?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Now, Lord, you know I'm not an emotional
[1:28:18] person. He said, "Really?" Well, I heard
[1:28:20] a lot different when you and your
[1:28:21] husband was riding to church today. Oh,
[1:28:24] sorry about that.
[1:28:29] These battles has raged since THE DAY OF
[1:28:31] THE GARDEN OF EDEN. THE BATTLE IN THE
[1:28:35] HUMAN MIND. LISTEN.
[1:28:37] PROTECT
[1:28:39] YOUR HEAD.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; THESE BATTLES HAVE raged
[1:28:46] and they're still raging. And Satan has
[1:28:49] got more things to enter into our head
[1:28:51] than he's ever had.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Many of you have got that stuck in your
[1:28:55] pocket. your phone
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; or it's in your purse. I'll tell you
[1:29:00] friend, it's awful. Christians are
[1:29:02] becoming so addicted to their phones,
[1:29:03] it's terrible.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; You can't even sit down and eat a meal
[1:29:06] together without a phone going off.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Donnie.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen, Brother Donnie.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT, SATAN?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; IT COMES FROM THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF
[1:29:19] GOOD AND EVIL. IT'S TO SO ABSORB OUR
[1:29:22] THOUGHTS, OUR TIME, our mind. AND WHAT
[1:29:25] HAS IT DONE? HAS IT HELPED US? SURE,
[1:29:27] THERE'S BEEN BENEFIT TO IT. BUT I WONDER
[1:29:30] HOW MUCH SADNESS, HOW MUCH DEPRESSION.
[1:29:32] AND I READ A A STUDY NOT LONG AGO WHERE
[1:29:35] YOUNG GIRLS, even some of the countries
[1:29:37] in Europe, is going to make it illegal
[1:29:41] FOR TEENAGERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO some of
[1:29:44] the internet BECAUSE THEY FOUND,
[1:29:46] ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNG GIRLS, THAT THEY
[1:29:48] WILL LOOK AT images of females on the
[1:29:51] INTERNET AND THEY LOOK at their own self
[1:29:53] and they look at their body and they
[1:29:55] don't even compare to a lot of them
[1:29:57] images and you don't even know if
[1:29:58] they're real or not real anymore. AND
[1:30:00] THEN THEY WHAT IS IT CAUSING THEM? IMAGE
[1:30:03] PROBLEMS. And they LOOK AT THEIREL AND
[1:30:06] THEY FEEL UGLY OR THEY FEEL overweight
[1:30:08] and they feel this and that and THE
[1:30:10] OTHER. LET ME tell you something,
[1:30:12] CHILDREN. WE SHOULD NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT
[1:30:14] TRYING TO IDOLIZE THEM JEZEBELS. WE
[1:30:17] SHOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT TRYING TO LOOK
[1:30:19] LIKE THEM. WELL, THE SAME WITH YOU MEN.
[1:30:21] AND YOU WANT TO OH MY WORSHIP YOUR BODY
[1:30:24] AND HAVE ABS AND HAVE THIS AND THAT AND
[1:30:26] THE OTHER. I'D RATHER HAVE A POT BELLY
[1:30:28] AND BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST THAN
[1:30:30] TO LOOK LIKE SOME KIND OF Hercules and
[1:30:33] go to hell.
[1:30:37] PRAISE THE LORD. SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE
[1:30:39] TIME IN THE HOLY GHOST GYM INSTEAD OF
[1:30:42] PUMPING IRON. WHY DON'T YOU PUMP THE
[1:30:44] WORD? WHY DON'T YOU PUMP A MESSAGE? HOW
[1:30:46] LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE SOME OF YOU SAT
[1:30:49] DOWN WITH YOUR FAMILY AND LISTENED TO A
[1:30:51] TAPE OF THE PROPHET OF GOD? COME ON,
[1:30:53] BROTHER DONNIE. OH, WE'RE CONCERNED
[1:30:55] ABOUT THIS AND CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. AND
[1:30:58] WE'RE NOT COVERING OUR HEAD WHEN A DUMB
[1:31:01] SNAKE HAS ENOUGH SENSE TO KNOW WHEN THE
[1:31:04] BATTLE IS RAGING, COVER YOUR HEAD. COVER
[1:31:07] YOUR HEAD. BECAUSE IF THAT ENEMY GRABS A
[1:31:10] HEAD, HE GRABS YOUR TONGUE, HE GRABS
[1:31:13] YOUR CONFESSION, HE GRABS YOUR EYES, HE
[1:31:16] GRABS YOUR INTELLECT, HE GRABS THE WAY
[1:31:19] YOU PROCESS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.
[1:31:30] Satan started it. And what did he do
[1:31:32] when he met Eve? He didn't deny God's
[1:31:36] word.
[1:31:38] He didn't deny God's word, but he
[1:31:41] whitewashed it.
[1:31:44] STOPS UP SOME LITTLE CHANNEL SOMEWHERE.
[1:31:47] BUT surely God,
[1:31:49] surely God, he knowed the word was
[1:31:53] right. Isn't that amazing? That's what
[1:31:55] kind of hypocrite we've got that's
[1:31:56] tempting us.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He himself knows the word is right and
[1:32:01] believes it's true, but he wants to tell
[1:32:03] you it ain't.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU'RE BEING TEMPTED
[1:32:06] BY the biggest hypocrite that ever
[1:32:08] lived. You're being tempted BY THE
[1:32:10] BIGGEST LIAR. YOU CANNOT BELIEVE WALL.
[1:32:12] YOU CANNOT BELIEVE THE DEVIL. YOU CANNOT
[1:32:15] HANG YOUR SOUL ON THE THINGS HE SAID ON
[1:32:17] YOU. HE BELIEVES THE WORD IS RIGHT AND
[1:32:19] KNOWS IT IS. AND YET HE'LL TELL YOU it's
[1:32:21] wrong.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he's done to all these folks
[1:32:26] has left the message.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; He himself knows this message is right.
[1:32:31] He and his cohorts in hell met this
[1:32:34] prophet of God enough times to know they
[1:32:36] know better. They ain't a false prophet.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; They know a whole lot better than some
[1:32:40] of the preachers and some of the people
[1:32:41] that's left this message. Come on now,
[1:32:43] children. Oh yeah, he knows who he is.
[1:32:45] HE KNOWS THAT WAS A MAN OF GOD. YOU
[1:32:47] REMEMBER THEM demons whenever them sons
[1:32:49] ofKkea come out and they saw Paul
[1:32:51] casting out devils in the name of Jesus
[1:32:53] and they come up to a man that was
[1:32:55] demonp possessed and they said WE WE
[1:32:57] ASSURE YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS THAT
[1:32:59] PAUL preached them devils in that man
[1:33:02] looked out and said Jesus I KNOW
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; AND PAUL I KNOW
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; but who are you?
[1:33:15] AND THEM DEMONS COME OUT OF THAT MAN AND
[1:33:17] TORE THE HIDE OFF THEM GUYS. TORE THE
[1:33:20] CLOTHES OFF OF THEM. I FIGURED they
[1:33:22] deserve it.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; WHY? AIN'T IT AMAZING? DEMONS OUT OF
[1:33:27] HELL RECOGNIZED WHO A SERVANT OF GOD
[1:33:30] WAS. REMEMBER WHEN PAUL WENT INTO THE
[1:33:32] CERTAIN CITY IN THERE AND THERE WAS A
[1:33:33] WOMAN that was demonp possessed.
[1:33:35] Remember that's sus. AND SHE HAD A REAL
[1:33:37] GIFT, some type of real gift. And she
[1:33:39] WAS TELLING THEM DIFFERENT TYPES OF
[1:33:40] THINGS. AND PAUL FINALLY GOT TIRED OF
[1:33:42] THAT THING FOLLOWING around and he
[1:33:44] rebuked HER AND SHE YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S
[1:33:45] TELLING HIM? THESE MEN ARE TELLING THE
[1:33:48] TRUTH.
[1:33:49] THESE MEN ARE PREACHING THE WAY OF GOD.
[1:33:52] YOU IMAGINE A DEMON OUT OF HELL INSIDE
[1:33:55] OF THAT WOMAN'S BODY. Oh hallelujah. MY
[1:33:58] THINK OF THE CHILDREN. BUT YET THEY'LL
[1:34:00] COME AND TELL YOU, "OH, THAT AIN'T
[1:34:01] RIGHT. THAT AIN'T RIGHT." WONDER HOW
[1:34:03] MANY OF THEM SAME DEMONS TOLD THEM
[1:34:05] PEOPLE, "WELL, THAT MAN'S A FALSE
[1:34:06] PROPHET. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THAT'S
[1:34:08] SUCH A HERESY. WHOEVER in the world ever
[1:34:09] heard such stuff. But when the devil
[1:34:11] testified himself, he said, "I'm telling
[1:34:12] you one thing." He's a voice is right on
[1:34:14] track now. They're telling you the
[1:34:16] truth. PAUL SAID, "SHUT UP, DEVIL. I
[1:34:17] DON'T NEED YOU TESTIFYING IN my
[1:34:19] meetings. Come out of her."
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:34:24] LOOK WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. GET YOUR HEAD.
[1:34:28] If he gets your head, he gets your eyes.
[1:34:31] He gets your mouth, your confession. He
[1:34:34] gets your ears. than as the serpent as
[1:34:37] it was prophesied in the Old Testament
[1:34:39] that she will stop her ears. I don't
[1:34:42] want TO HEAR IT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
[1:34:43] IT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. People don't want to hear
[1:34:48] the truth, but they want to hear lies
[1:34:50] against the truth.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. HE KNOW THE word was right, but
[1:35:00] he noted he just couldn't come right out
[1:35:03] and blast it blarry like that. So he
[1:35:07] sugarcoated it.
[1:35:11] Wow.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Sugarcoat it. You know, a lot of
[1:35:14] preachers in this day are professional
[1:35:17] sugar coders.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:35:24] YOU JUST LET GOD'S WORD penetrate
[1:35:28] first. TAKE THE MIND. THERE'S THE BATTLE
[1:35:30] GROUND. NOT SAY, "WELL, IF I COULD FEEL
[1:35:32] IT, I I FEEL THE GLORY OF GOD
[1:35:33] FOLLOWING." THAT HAS NOTHING to do WITH
[1:35:35] IT. NOT A THING. OPEN UP THAT MIND.
[1:35:38] THAT'S THE BATTLEGROUND. THERE'S WHERE
[1:35:40] THE BATTLE SETS in a ray. Think of it,
[1:35:42] friends, right here this morning. It's
[1:35:44] happening.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; The battle IS IN A RAY.
[1:35:50] THE BATTLEGROUND, YOUR MIND.
[1:35:52] Some of you HAVING A HARD TIME
[1:35:54] CONCENTRATING. YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK.
[1:35:55] YOU'RE TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
[1:35:56] TRYING TO PROCESS THE WORD. LORD, HELP
[1:35:58] ME. PLEASE HELP ME, LORD. THIS THOUGHT
[1:36:00] COMING IN, THAT CAUGHT coming in. What's
[1:36:02] brother so and so saying? Sister so and
[1:36:03] so in his church. Oh. Oh, Lord. Sister
[1:36:05] so and so. I bet she's sick today. Oh
[1:36:07] goodness. Over brother so and so. Is
[1:36:09] brother Donnie okay? Is he acting all
[1:36:10] right? He's acting kind of wild today.
[1:36:12] That's normal.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; OH. OH MY GOODNESS. IS BROTHER IS
[1:36:18] BROTHER JOHN OKAY? I'VE NOTICED he's a
[1:36:19] little bit, you know, maybe brother John
[1:36:21] he he's prayed a little funny. Is
[1:36:22] everything ALL RIGHT? IT'S AMAZING WHAT
[1:36:24] SATAN WILL DO TO TRY TO PULL YOUR HEAD
[1:36:27] OUT TO WHERE HE CAN START SEWING SEEDS
[1:36:31] in your mind. OPEN UP THAT MIND. THAT'S
[1:36:34] THE BATTLEGROUND. THAT'S WHERE THE
[1:36:35] BATTLE sets in array right there in the
[1:36:37] front line,
[1:36:39] your mind.
[1:36:41] OPEN IT UP AND SAY, "EVERY DOUBT
[1:36:44] I doubt my doubts."
[1:36:48] PRAISE BE TO GOD. I DOUBT MY DOUBTS.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; I'M DOUBTING MY DOUBTS NOW. I'M
[1:36:56] BELIEVING GOD'S WORD. NOW, NOTICE WHAT
[1:36:58] HE'S DOING. He's putting the words in
[1:37:02] our mouths
[1:37:04] to say,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; "Yes, sir."
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; When the battle rages,
[1:37:09] he's giving us the words TO SAY. I DOUBT
[1:37:13] MY DOUBTS. I'M DOUBTING MY DOUBTS NOW.
[1:37:17] I'M BELIEVING IN GOD'S WORD. HERE I
[1:37:19] COME, SATAN. Something's going to take
[1:37:22] place. Sure it will. YES, SIR. YOU SEE,
[1:37:26] ERROR IS LIKE GANG GREEN.
[1:37:30] Remember Herminous AND FELIUS IN THE NEW
[1:37:32] TESTAMENT? PAUL WROTE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE
[1:37:34] THEY PREACHING the resurrection WAS
[1:37:36] PASSED AND HE SAID, "THEIR word doth eat
[1:37:39] as a canker,"
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; which is gang green.
[1:37:47] what we would call cancer
[1:37:50] today.
[1:37:52] SO FALSE DOCTRINE BECOMES LIKE A
[1:37:54] gangarine in your body. For any of you
[1:37:56] that know anybody that's ever had it
[1:37:57] before, you know, whenever it sits in
[1:37:59] the human body, if they don't get behind
[1:38:01] it far enough, they'll amputate,
[1:38:04] amputate, amputate, amputate, amputate,
[1:38:06] amputate because it keeps eating, it
[1:38:09] keeps spreading.
[1:38:12] Oh Lord,
[1:38:14] HERESIES DESTROY THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH
[1:38:17] and the true reality of God. Now, let's
[1:38:20] change it a little bit. Jesus said that
[1:38:23] we're to be as wise as serpents, but as
[1:38:26] harmless
[1:38:28] as doves. Harmless as doves. How many
[1:38:31] wants to be a dove?
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; How many believes you are?
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; You just need more of the nature of it
[1:38:36] in you.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Raise your hand. Wave your hand. Amen.
[1:38:40] Lord, you see my hands. So watch now. We
[1:38:43] we we see hopefully you see today that
[1:38:46] after that we need the wisdom of the
[1:38:49] serpent to be able to help us to know
[1:38:51] what to do.
[1:38:53] AND THEN WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN US
[1:38:56] IMPARTING THE DIVINE NATURE of the dove,
[1:38:59] IT WILL KEEP THAT WISDOM to where it
[1:39:01] will not be what guides us and leads us
[1:39:04] all through life. And yet the dove WILL
[1:39:07] NEED THAT TO ACCOMPANY IT TO make it to
[1:39:10] where THAT WE'RE NOT SO SMART AND WE'VE
[1:39:13] GOT SUCH SUBTLENESS WITH our wisdom. I'm
[1:39:16] going to tell you there's folks around
[1:39:17] this message and they are tricksters.
[1:39:20] THEY KNOW HOW TO say certain things.
[1:39:22] Preachers are that way. You get around
[1:39:25] them and boy, whatever you want to hear
[1:39:27] is what they'll tell you. What you want
[1:39:28] to hear, they'll tell you. What you want
[1:39:30] to hear, they'll tell you, they'll tell
[1:39:31] you. And then one of these days it'll
[1:39:33] backfire because all y'all get together
[1:39:35] and have a meeting and say, "You know
[1:39:36] what, brother so and so." No, no way. He
[1:39:38] told me this. He told me that. That's
[1:39:40] the way it is. Believe me, I've been in
[1:39:42] on some of those meetings before. NOW
[1:39:44] WATCH. AND AND THE ASPECT OF THE DOVES.
[1:39:47] WELL, HOW DOES God want us to be like
[1:39:50] doves? Well, there's many ways, of
[1:39:52] course, BUT HE WANTS US TO BE LIKE A
[1:39:54] DOVE in meekness and also in innocence
[1:39:58] and then also in purity. Meekness,
[1:40:02] innocence, and purity. Now, friend, I've
[1:40:06] come to the realization that I believe
[1:40:07] with all of my heart, one of the reason
[1:40:09] that some of the folks have pulled away
[1:40:10] from the message is because they can't
[1:40:11] live it. There ain't no way in the world
[1:40:13] from here on and until next Sunday and
[1:40:16] whenever it is I get done with this that
[1:40:17] we're going to be able to live this
[1:40:19] without the nature of God himself. So
[1:40:21] it's easier to go TO SOME WATERED DOWN
[1:40:23] compromising church where you do
[1:40:25] whatever you want to do and live however
[1:40:27] you want to live and instead of facing
[1:40:28] the fact you know what I cannot live
[1:40:30] what this word demands. I can't either
[1:40:33] but with him and me we're more than
[1:40:35] conquerors over it.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; NOW THE dove is an emblem of meekness.
[1:40:40] Watch this. But the dove, you know, it
[1:40:44] it also needs that strength and that
[1:40:46] wisdom. Watch this in question answers.
[1:40:48] Of course, the devils went out of them.
[1:40:51] Talking about this man that had all this
[1:40:54] demons in him and the maniac of Gadra
[1:40:56] AND CAUSED TO KILL THE hogs and it just
[1:41:00] run them into a fit.
[1:41:05] I'll tell you one thing. It's going to
[1:41:06] be hard for you to keep your meekness if
[1:41:09] you've got a temper enough to where you
[1:41:10] can fight a buzz saw.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You see, temper
[1:41:21] is the first stage of insanity.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; I'll preach with or without you, but the
[1:41:28] amens are appreciated.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:32] IT JUST RUN THEM INTO A FIT. YOU
[1:41:34] UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN Jesus
[1:41:36] commanded them demons to leave this man?
[1:41:38] They caused these pigs to go into a
[1:41:42] temper fit.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Throw them in a fit of rage
[1:41:49] and anger. THEY JUST HAD A FIT JUST LIKE
[1:41:52] ANYONE.
[1:41:54] DID YOU EVER SEE A person have a temper
[1:41:56] fit? Well, that's just what it is. It's
[1:41:59] just them devils.
[1:42:08] I ain't saying nothing. I'm just
[1:42:09] looking.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I know this ain't D, friends. And I
[1:42:19] realize a lot of folks, they don't want
[1:42:21] to hear this kind of preaching,
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; but if you want to be saved and you want
[1:42:25] to be in the rapture, I think you do.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:30] IT'S JUST THEM DEVILS. THAT'S WHAT
[1:42:32] happened to them. You ever see one
[1:42:34] having a temper fit? You say, "OH, I
[1:42:37] KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO Gather right now."
[1:42:38] That's just EXACTLY A FEW MORE come in
[1:42:40] there running COMPLETELY INSANE. CUZ A
[1:42:43] MEDICAL DOCTOR WILL TELL YOU THAT TEMPER
[1:42:46] is the first stage of insanity.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; That's what Mayo says. First stage
[1:42:56] of insanity.
[1:43:03] Read it everybody. You folks are
[1:43:05] streaming this service, don't you cut me
[1:43:07] off now.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine them OR THE PERSON
[1:43:14] WITH A temper and then they rely upon
[1:43:17] the wisdom of the serpent
[1:43:20] instead of the humility
[1:43:23] of the dove?
[1:43:28] Notice in Ephesians 4:31.
[1:43:30] You see, this is something that the dove
[1:43:32] naturally cannot have,
[1:43:35] which is the gall of bitterness or
[1:43:38] revenge.
[1:43:41] Let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:43:45] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:43:49] from you with ALL MALICE. LET ALL
[1:43:53] BITTERNESS, look at the word bitterness.
[1:43:56] Oh my, what a powerful word, bitter
[1:43:59] gall, A BITTER RULE, AND SO producing a
[1:44:03] bitter fruit. It's also used
[1:44:08] of the poison
[1:44:10] of the serpents.
[1:44:14] Wow.
[1:44:17] So bitterness,
[1:44:19] anger, clamor, wrath.
[1:44:24] Mama
[1:44:26] had all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:44:28] and clamor and evil speaking. Huh?
[1:44:33] Speaking. Let's look at this little
[1:44:35] jewel.
[1:44:37] Speaking.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; The Greek word is blasphemia.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Everybody know what that means? I
[1:44:43] suppose like blaspheming the Holy Ghost,
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; evil speaking,
[1:44:52] blasphemy,
[1:44:54] slander,
[1:44:56] detraction, speech, injurous
[1:45:00] to another's good name.
[1:45:04] Do you understand how easy it is to
[1:45:06] blasphe the Holy Ghost,
[1:45:09] calling the works of God an unclean
[1:45:11] spirit? So when a a person has been
[1:45:13] saved, I'm talking about really saved,
[1:45:15] filled with the HOLY GHOST, CHANGED,
[1:45:16] MANIFESTED attribute of God and you try
[1:45:19] to run them down and say they're an evil
[1:45:22] devil or they're this and the other. Do
[1:45:23] you understand what you're doing? You're
[1:45:24] calling the works of God an unclean
[1:45:27] spirit.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; We're not just talking about healing and
[1:45:30] jumping and running and shouting.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Paul chose this word correctly.
[1:45:36] So evil speaking of one another, EVIL
[1:45:39] SPEAKING OF GOD'S PROPHET,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; GOD'S MEN,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; GOD'S DAUGHTERS, God's sons,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; blasphemia,
[1:45:52] bitterness. Then he ties it together
[1:45:55] with evil speaking.
[1:45:58] So look at this now.
[1:46:01] slander, detraction, speech, injurous to
[1:46:06] another's good name. But Paul said, "Let
[1:46:10] it be put away from you with all
[1:46:14] malice." Verse 32, "And be ye mean
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; and angry
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; and hissing
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; AND CALLING UP TO BITE SOMEBODY.
[1:46:32] Be ye kind one to another,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; tenderhearted,
[1:46:39] forgiving one another,
[1:46:42] even as God
[1:46:44] for Christ's sake
[1:46:47] hath forgiven you.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; We do believe this, right?
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; We do believe this is God's word. Can't
[1:46:58] you see, friends, the majority of
[1:47:01] Christendom
[1:47:04] will never get to this?
[1:47:07] They can't
[1:47:10] cuz they're not filled with the Holy
[1:47:11] Ghost. So, somebody does something
[1:47:14] against them, they will get them back.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; And if they go to church with them, they
[1:47:21] won't speak to them. They won't shake
[1:47:22] their hand. and they'll do everything
[1:47:25] they can to injure their name
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; and their character.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; As we go on in time, I realize why
[1:47:35] there'll be so few
[1:47:37] that'll actually make the rapture
[1:47:40] even in our own ranks
[1:47:43] because people do not consider this of
[1:47:47] very much value.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Well, THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT
[1:47:51] ABOUT ME. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. I
[1:47:54] WATCH OUT, HOGS.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; And be ye kind one to another,
[1:48:02] tenderhearted,
[1:48:04] forgiving one another, even as God
[1:48:07] for Christ's sake. I AIN'T FORGIVE THEM.
[1:48:10] THEY NEVER ASKED ME. PAUL NEVER TOLD YOU
[1:48:12] TO FORGIVE them when they asked you.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; He gave you the basis by which we
[1:48:17] forgive people as God has forgiven you
[1:48:20] for Christ's sake. Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus forgave those Romans who never
[1:48:25] even asked him for forgiveness.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Think on these things.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Notice in Hebrews 12:15,
[1:48:38] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:48:41] the grace of God. Now, can you imagine
[1:48:43] that people can actually fail? They can
[1:48:46] fall from the grace OF GOD. THEY THEY'VE
[1:48:48] BEEN SAVED FROM A world of sin. They may
[1:48:51] have been sanctified. They may have come
[1:48:52] into a, you know, a church and they pay
[1:48:54] their tithes and do all kinds OF THINGS
[1:48:55] AND YET fail from the grace of God, lest
[1:48:59] any root
[1:49:01] of bitterness
[1:49:03] springing up
[1:49:06] trouble you and thereby many be defiled,
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; not with adultery, not with fornication,
[1:49:13] not with drinking, not with marijuana,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; but with bitterness. Wow.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Bitterness.
[1:49:24] The prophet preached the lamb and the
[1:49:26] dove several times. And
[1:49:29] brother Joseph Moose, Matson, Joseph
[1:49:33] Matson. Bose actually printed the one
[1:49:36] that Brother Random preached. I think it
[1:49:38] maybe might have been the one in
[1:49:39] Shreport. I might be mistaken on that.
[1:49:41] But brother Randerman referring back to
[1:49:44] that book and he was talking about what
[1:49:45] a blessing it had been to so many
[1:49:47] people. AND HE SAID HE FELT like it was
[1:49:49] the greatest sermon up to that time that
[1:49:52] God ever gave him. Maybe y'all listen to
[1:49:56] it sometime. I want you to listen to
[1:49:59] this one. In Los Angeles, the dove
[1:50:02] doesn't have a gall. So, he cannot
[1:50:05] digest the things that a scavenger bird
[1:50:07] would eat. He can only eat the clean and
[1:50:10] pure things. He types the Christian that
[1:50:14] packs the dove in his heart.
[1:50:17] He just can't stand the foul things of
[1:50:21] the world. See, HE HASN'T ANY G, NO
[1:50:24] bitterness about him. He's humble, a
[1:50:27] humility. What's any sweeter than the
[1:50:32] coup
[1:50:33] of a dove?
[1:50:36] I've noticed the dove. This one is in
[1:50:38] Brooklyn. He takes some of the same
[1:50:40] similar thoughts. I've noticed in the
[1:50:42] dove, the dove is one bird who has no
[1:50:44] gall, no bitterness.
[1:50:47] And there's no bitterness about God.
[1:50:50] It's a gentle, meek, kind little fella.
[1:50:55] And it cannot any eat anything
[1:50:58] that's contaminated.
[1:51:00] And the wings of a dove, I found out
[1:51:02] that the dove don't have any gall, no
[1:51:05] gall in a dove because he has no need of
[1:51:07] it.
[1:51:08] See, that's the way it is with a
[1:51:10] Christian. He doesn't need bitterness.
[1:51:14] See,
[1:51:16] friends, I wish I could get this over to
[1:51:17] you today. For those of you that are
[1:51:18] struggling with bitterness against
[1:51:20] somebody you go to church with, against
[1:51:22] a preacher, against a mom, a daddy,
[1:51:24] whatever it is, you don't need that in
[1:51:26] your life.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; And nine times out of 10, it destroys
[1:51:32] the person who has the bitterness, not
[1:51:34] the person they have the bitterness
[1:51:36] against.
[1:51:39] So if you're setting your day and you've
[1:51:40] got bitterness in your heart, it will
[1:51:42] not destroy that person you've got the
[1:51:43] bitterness against
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; cuz sometimes they don't even know it.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; But it will destroy you.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; You see other birds, they have that
[1:51:56] gall. They need it.
[1:52:00] The prophet said the biggest hypocrite
[1:52:02] that there was is a crow
[1:52:05] cuz he can eat seed right beside the
[1:52:07] dove in church and he can go outside the
[1:52:10] church and feed on filth and carry in
[1:52:13] over rotten carcasses.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; That's a church member a lot of times.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. BUT HE SAID HE DON'T NEED
[1:52:21] ANY BITTERNESS cuz he only eats the food
[1:52:24] of God. It doesn't take bitterness to to
[1:52:27] dissolve that.
[1:52:30] But it takes love
[1:52:32] to dissolve
[1:52:34] the food.
[1:52:36] SO YOU SEE THE SCAVENGER HAS TO HAPPEN.
[1:52:45] They need all that to help them digest
[1:52:46] what they're eating because they're
[1:52:47] eating.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; But the dove loves pure air.
[1:52:57] Did you know that the dove doesn't like
[1:52:59] contaminated air?
[1:53:01] Polluted air. Pollution in some of the
[1:53:04] third world countries with large
[1:53:06] populations of doves as it begins to
[1:53:09] increase, it will drive them from the
[1:53:11] city
[1:53:13] because they can't stand to breathe it.
[1:53:16] They can't stand to live in that. Oh,
[1:53:18] hallelujah.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; And a dove. YOU'LL NEVER FIND THE DOVE
[1:53:23] laying on a no dead possum as Carol and
[1:53:25] I had to straddle one coming to church
[1:53:26] that had been rolling run over probably
[1:53:28] sometime in the night. Blood scattered
[1:53:30] everywhere. Yeah, I want to make you
[1:53:31] sick. I want to make you sick of what
[1:53:33] you're feeding on if it's contrary to
[1:53:35] the word of God.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I GUARANTEE YOU HEAD BACK THAT way in a
[1:53:38] bit. There'll be crows down there
[1:53:40] PICKING ITS EYES OUT. The first thing
[1:53:42] they'll be picking on this and picking
[1:53:44] on that. You ain't going to find no dove
[1:53:46] down there unless he got drunk somewhere
[1:53:47] last night, fell out of the tree, and
[1:53:49] hit himself ON THE HEAD. AIN'T NO DOVE
[1:53:51] GONNA DO IT BECAUSE AS SOON AS HE'D eat
[1:53:54] it, IT WOULD MAKE HIM SICK,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; HE CAN'T DIGEST IT.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you can't digest the
[1:54:01] filth of the world?
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; You see what it takes to digest this
[1:54:07] message? True baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:10] on the soul. And you're in love with
[1:54:12] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:54:15] and forever.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Let me read you this in Romans
[1:54:21] and we'll close. The dove nature will
[1:54:25] not revenge itself.
[1:54:27] ROMANS 12:19. DEARLY BELOVED, avenge not
[1:54:31] yourselves, BUT RATHER GIVE place unto
[1:54:36] wrath. This is an amazing word, place.
[1:54:41] Go ahead and make room for it.
[1:54:45] Go ahead and let him do it.
[1:54:49] Let them run you down. Let them talk
[1:54:50] about you,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; but don't avenge yourselves.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; In me, I've got to stand THERE FOR MY
[1:54:58] RIGHTS. That's because you're not a
[1:55:00] sheep yet, honey.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; You need to let the Lord Jesus shave
[1:55:05] that off of you.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves,
[1:55:13] but rather give place unto the wrath.
[1:55:15] For it is written, "Vengeance
[1:55:18] is mine. I will repay, sayaith the
[1:55:21] Lord." Who do you figure could get back
[1:55:22] at people better? You or God?
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; But turn it over to God then.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, FEED
[1:55:35] HIM RIGHT POISON. IF HE THIRST, GIVE HIM
[1:55:38] BATTERY ACID.
[1:55:46] NOW, don't tell me some of y'all ain't
[1:55:47] bought rat poison before to give to your
[1:55:49] enemies.
[1:55:53] In a metaphor, our rat poison comes from
[1:55:57] right here.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; And our battery acid
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; you going to keep on. You're going to
[1:56:06] get me fired. I'm just I'm just saying.
[1:56:12] Wow.
[1:56:14] Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed
[1:56:18] him.
[1:56:20] If he thirst,
[1:56:22] give him drink.
[1:56:24] For in so doing, thou shalt heap coals
[1:56:29] of fire on his head. Who would have ever
[1:56:33] thought a Big Mac and a Diet Coke would
[1:56:35] have done that?
[1:56:39] Can't you see what the Lord WANTS TO DO
[1:56:41] FOR US?
[1:56:43] But when we take it in our own hands,
[1:56:47] then where does the coals of fire come?
[1:56:49] On our own hide.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Again, friends, I realize this is not
[1:56:55] important. It's just the Bible, right? I
[1:56:58] mean, that that's just why the majority
[1:56:59] of Christendom, they will miss it on
[1:57:02] such stuff as this. We're pointing to
[1:57:03] hair. We're pointing to britches. We're
[1:57:05] pointing to makeup. Let's just LAY THAT
[1:57:07] ASIDE. HOW MANY OF US DO THIS?
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU SISTERS AIN'T WORN MAKEUP IN
[1:57:12] YEARS AND YEARS YET. DO YOU DO THIS?
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, if thine enemy hunger, feed
[1:57:25] him. If he thirst, give him drink. For
[1:57:28] in so doing, thou shalt heap coals of
[1:57:30] fire on his head. Be not overcome
[1:57:34] of evil, but overcome evil.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; So that's the way that we overcome it
[1:57:46] when we're dealing with people who are
[1:57:48] doing us evil. We overcome it with good.
[1:57:52] 1 Thessalonians 5:15, "See that none
[1:57:54] render evil for evil unto
[1:57:58] any man, but ever follow that which IS
[1:58:02] GOOD, BOAST AMONG yourselves
[1:58:06] unto
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Wow."
[1:58:16] So, if the Lord Jesus requires these
[1:58:18] words to be fulfilled in our lives
[1:58:20] before the rapture,
[1:58:22] how many of us would have went this
[1:58:25] morning at 8:00
[1:58:27] if it would have come?
[1:58:32] 1 Peter 3:8.
[1:58:35] Finally, be all of one mind, having
[1:58:37] compassion one of another.
[1:58:40] Love his brethren. Be pitiful,
[1:58:44] which means showing pity. Be courteous.
[1:58:49] Do you understand? Christianity involves
[1:58:52] being courteous,
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; kind, loving, gentle.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Not rendering evil for evil or railing
[1:59:02] for railing.
[1:59:06] Railing is to speak reproachfully
[1:59:10] and reviling.
[1:59:12] But contrarywise,
[1:59:14] blessing, which is where we get the word
[1:59:17] eulogy from, BOUNTY, PRAISE, AND
[1:59:20] BENEFIT.
[1:59:22] SO SOMEBODY TALKS ABOUT YOU AND YOU
[1:59:24] PRAISE THEM.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; WELL, what do you think? Should we just
[1:59:31] shut down this church and turn it into a
[1:59:33] tire selling place? Or maybe we'll make
[1:59:35] it an oil change place.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; If we're not going to keep this word
[1:59:42] and if we don't think these words have
[1:59:44] value,
[1:59:46] where are we? Who are we?
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know who you are, but I know who
[1:59:51] I am.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; I'm a son of God.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; And I want this in my life more than I
[1:59:56] want anything in the word this world. I
[1:59:58] have it in my life, brother Larry, but I
[1:59:59] want to see it more. Come on, SOMEBODY.
[2:00:02] Y'ALL GOT IT IN YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU WANT
[2:00:04] TO SEE IT MORE. YOU WANT TO SEE JESUS
[2:00:06] MANIFESTED? OH, I KNOW WE EMPHASIZE
[2:00:08] SIGNS AND WONDERS AND WALKING ON WATER.
[2:00:11] MY LET'S JUST GET THIS IN OUR LIFE. THEN
[2:00:13] WE'LL WALK ON WATER AFTER A WHILE.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:00:23] Let me hurry.
[2:00:26] Not rendering evil for evil, railing for
[2:00:28] really contrary wise blessing,
[2:00:31] knowing that you are there unto called
[2:00:35] that ye should inherit a blessing. For
[2:00:39] he that will love life and see good
[2:00:41] days, let him refrain his tongue from
[2:00:45] evil, and his lips that they speak no
[2:00:51] guile. Why a dove nature doesn't have
[2:00:56] any?
[2:00:58] She has no god.
[2:01:01] But still,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; we'll pick it up again. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; And you know what's awesome thing it is
[2:01:15] about being the pastor? I know that most
[2:01:18] of you want it. Amen.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; And if I'd asked you here today, do you
[2:01:23] want me to skip the rest of this part?
[2:01:25] Most of you'd say,
[2:01:28] "No, preaching
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; cuz you want to be right with God,
[2:01:37] sir."
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; You believe what you wish to.
[2:01:42] I don't think he would send this to us
[2:01:45] if there were not hungry hearts here,
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; who was going to receive it. and become
[2:01:50] it.
[2:01:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:56] Let's bow our heads together.
[2:02:00] Praise the Lord.
[2:02:03] Lord Jesus, how I thank you for these
[2:02:05] words today.
[2:02:09] I know, Lord, they're not words that our
[2:02:11] flesh really enjoys hearing.
[2:02:14] Yet in our souls, we rejoice for the
[2:02:16] truth.
[2:02:20] I know, father that Satan has moved in
[2:02:22] the amongst the ranks of the message
[2:02:24] people and down through the years
[2:02:28] men have come in and got big followings
[2:02:30] on this ideology and that one and
[2:02:33] another one and all of it based on a
[2:02:35] personality of some man somewhere.
[2:02:39] And they have their certain cliches and
[2:02:41] their words. And when they all get
[2:02:42] together, they say those certain words
[2:02:45] and the crowd roars.
[2:02:49] And yet, how many of them was sitting
[2:02:50] there with the envy of their hearts?
[2:02:55] I'm reminded of a certain move that was
[2:02:58] one of the biggest moves around the
[2:03:00] message not too many years ago.
[2:03:04] And yet the leader of that move
[2:03:07] told them in Africa
[2:03:10] for them to go to the churches that
[2:03:11] didn't believe their doctrines,
[2:03:14] climb up in the rafters of the church
[2:03:18] and record their sermons
[2:03:21] and clip their tapes
[2:03:24] and make them say things they didn't
[2:03:26] say.
[2:03:28] like they did me several years ago in
[2:03:30] Ohio when I went there and they got the
[2:03:32] service that I preached and
[2:03:34] then they took it home and they modified
[2:03:37] it and changed it. Took words out, put
[2:03:40] words in that I didn't say.
[2:03:42] Brother George Smith called me on the
[2:03:44] phone. Hey, brother Donnie, you was up
[2:03:45] at brother so and so. Yeah. Yeah, I sure
[2:03:47] was. Did you say this and this and this?
[2:03:50] I said, 'N no, sir. I sure didn't.
[2:03:53] Somebody sent me a tape. I said, I don't
[2:03:55] care what they sent. I didn't say that.
[2:03:59] Come to find out, their great leader of
[2:04:03] this great move
[2:04:05] told their people to come to my
[2:04:06] meetings, find fault, listen for
[2:04:10] everything they could.
[2:04:13] How terrible.
[2:04:15] I wish these poor people before they
[2:04:17] crossed the line if they haven't
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; that have pulled away from this message
[2:04:21] who are listening to God's prophet not
[2:04:24] for any benefit
[2:04:26] but to find where he told the story this
[2:04:28] way here and then he would tell it a
[2:04:30] little bit different over there. Yeah.
[2:04:32] Sort of like they do when they tell
[2:04:33] their stories.
[2:04:35] Sort of like Matthew told one story and
[2:04:37] then whenever Mark wrote about it, it
[2:04:39] was a little bit different.
[2:04:43] not knowing one day that they will walk
[2:04:45] before you, Lord, at your throne and
[2:04:48] give an account.
[2:04:51] May we never, dear God, may we never
[2:04:54] think that we can go to heaven with that
[2:04:57] type of attitude.
[2:05:01] Search me, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:04] Begin with me. See if you find anything
[2:05:06] in me today, Lord, that displeases you.
[2:05:12] Search my mind, my soul,
[2:05:15] search my sermon notes,
[2:05:18] search me, Jesus.
[2:05:20] If there's anything in me that
[2:05:22] displeases you. Oh, I want wisdom. Yes,
[2:05:26] Lord. We've learned how important it is,
[2:05:28] but Father, I also want the nature, the
[2:05:32] love, the character.
[2:05:35] I wasn't able to get to it this morning,
[2:05:36] but in the Song of Solomon, when you
[2:05:39] relate to your wife, not one time do you
[2:05:42] call her an eagle,
[2:05:44] but you call her a dove over and over
[2:05:49] and over again. It's apparent we got a
[2:05:52] lot of eagles around the message,
[2:05:54] rippers of the beak.
[2:05:58] But how many doves do we have?
[2:06:03] Hallelujah.
[2:06:05] Lord, we want the dove to lead the lamb.
[2:06:10] We believe that's the call of this hour,
[2:06:12] Father, is that we become more and more
[2:06:16] and more like you.
[2:06:19] As I received a text from one of the
[2:06:21] brothers last week, and he said he began
[2:06:24] to wonder about himself because he was
[2:06:26] so changing and just kind of letting
[2:06:28] people get by with this and that and the
[2:06:30] other.
[2:06:31] And he said he didn't even have the
[2:06:33] words to express
[2:06:35] what the service had meant to him.
[2:06:38] Change us, Lord.
[2:06:41] Make us like you.
[2:06:44] Let the dove
[2:06:46] lead our lamb hearts.
[2:06:49] Anoint us, oh father. Oh yes. Give us
[2:06:52] courage. Give us strength. We'll
[2:06:54] withstand the devil. And whom we're
[2:06:55] called before the the the court or
[2:06:58] whatever more. May that wisdom be there
[2:07:00] to confound them, but not out of anger
[2:07:04] and not out of bitterness,
[2:07:07] but out of love.
[2:07:09] For the Bible tells us in the book of
[2:07:11] Hebrews that you were harmless, yet one
[2:07:14] day when you stood there and you spoke
[2:07:16] so hard that your disciples come back to
[2:07:18] you and say, "Lord, did you not know
[2:07:19] that the Pharisees were offended at you
[2:07:21] because you said this and that?"
[2:07:24] And you said every plant my heavenly
[2:07:26] father has not planted will be uprooted.
[2:07:30] And yet the Bible says you were
[2:07:31] blameless, harmless.
[2:07:35] So it shows us that we will still say
[2:07:37] harsh things sometimes, true things,
[2:07:40] especially ministers of the gospel, but
[2:07:43] we're not doing it out of human anger
[2:07:46] or to get back at people. But the spirit
[2:07:50] of God crying out for their souls.
[2:07:53] Help us, Jesus.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Lord.
[2:08:01] How many wants to be a lamb of God that
[2:08:04] the spirit of God can lead you?
[2:08:07] I was looking at it yesterday and the
[2:08:08] communication back and forth between the
[2:08:10] bride and the bridegroom there in the
[2:08:13] Song of Solomon. He tells her she has
[2:08:16] dove's eyes.
[2:08:18] So the Syrian dove, it wouldn't be even
[2:08:20] like our dove or like the the dove in in
[2:08:22] Israel. The Syrians, the Syrian dove's
[2:08:25] eyes is really big, really large, and
[2:08:28] the way it's set on the side of the
[2:08:30] head. And they say just looking at those
[2:08:33] eyes, they can be very captivating.
[2:08:36] And he said about her, you have dove's
[2:08:39] eyes. on over and a few chapters later,
[2:08:43] she finally grows in understanding and
[2:08:46] revelation herself and she turns and
[2:08:47] says to him, "You have dove eyes."
[2:08:52] So her eyes are matching his. She's
[2:08:54] seeing what he's seeing. She's relating
[2:08:57] the way he relates. God help us to have
[2:09:00] dove's eyes.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; And he calls her my dove, my love, my
[2:09:07] undefiled.
[2:09:09] And he says it over and over again. Not
[2:09:11] my eagle,
[2:09:13] not my scavenger, not my crow,
[2:09:17] but my dove.
[2:09:19] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:09:22] How many like to be remembered today as
[2:09:24] we pray? How many wants to be a dove of
[2:09:27] God, a lamb of God, but yet you want
[2:09:31] wisdom? As Jesus said, be as wise as a
[2:09:33] serpent.
[2:09:35] We need that as well.
[2:09:38] Heavenly Father, we bow our heads to the
[2:09:41] dust of the earth.
[2:09:44] And if you tar long enough, all of us
[2:09:46] will go that way, back to the dust
[2:09:49] again.
[2:09:50] But Lord, while we're here in this slot
[2:09:53] of time,
[2:09:55] and we've dropped down in this little
[2:09:57] hickey, as it was, is what your prophet
[2:09:59] called it, a little loop of time.
[2:10:05] So time is still in this circle of
[2:10:08] eternity too, but it's like a little
[2:10:10] loop that drops down at the bottom.
[2:10:15] And that little loop began there when
[2:10:17] time began.
[2:10:20] Hallelujah.
[2:10:22] But we believe we're getting closer and
[2:10:23] closer to where prophecy will pull that
[2:10:26] little loop back up into the great
[2:10:29] circle of eternity.
[2:10:31] While we're in this loop,
[2:10:34] this is a hickey of time.
[2:10:37] We're getting our character.
[2:10:39] We're not here to make ourselves rich,
[2:10:42] famous.
[2:10:44] We're here, Lord, to take with us the
[2:10:46] only thing we can, our character,
[2:10:48] molded, shaped to be like you,
[2:10:53] Lord Jesus. Thank you for these words
[2:10:55] today. I know they've cut us and they've
[2:10:57] hurt us. But one day when we stand
[2:11:00] before you that day, I want to look
[2:11:02] behind me and see these saints of God
[2:11:04] standing there.
[2:11:06] When I have to present them before you,
[2:11:08] Lord, I don't want a one of them to walk
[2:11:11] up and point their finger in my face and
[2:11:13] say, "You hypocrite.
[2:11:15] You never told the truth.
[2:11:18] You picked easy words for us."
[2:11:21] But Lord God, I want them to come
[2:11:23] running up.
[2:11:25] We'll gather there with the rest of this
[2:11:27] this age and the prophet of God will
[2:11:30] present us to you as tokens of the
[2:11:33] message of the hour. Then each little
[2:11:36] each little church, each little group
[2:11:38] will be gathered there with their
[2:11:40] pastor.
[2:11:41] There the pastor will walk up and he'll
[2:11:45] answer for that flock. The evangelists
[2:11:47] will come of their influence. The great
[2:11:50] rewards will be handed out.
[2:11:54] Oh Jesus, I don't figure I'll get much
[2:11:56] of a reward. I ain't never been a reward
[2:11:58] person much anyhow.
[2:12:01] But Lord, if I can just hear these
[2:12:03] words,
[2:12:05] well done, a good and faithful servant,
[2:12:09] that's all I want.
[2:12:12] I don't even want no mansion.
[2:12:15] I don't want no great posterity in the
[2:12:17] kingdom of God. I just want to be there.
[2:12:21] Praise the Lord. and look behind me and
[2:12:24] see their young faces.
[2:12:27] Not an old one among us, not a baby
[2:12:29] among us, but all of us the same age. My
[2:12:32] brothers and the strength and the
[2:12:35] vitality of eternal youth. My sisters
[2:12:39] with one gray hair, without one wrinkle
[2:12:41] in their face, and never will be one and
[2:12:45] will enter into the paradise of God.
[2:12:48] It'll be worth all the hard sermons that
[2:12:50] we've heard. Lord, it'll be worth the
[2:12:52] struggles of the nature that we were
[2:12:55] born with. Father, I believe this is
[2:12:58] attainable or you'd never send it to us.
[2:13:01] We worship you today, Father, and I'm
[2:13:02] going to go ahead and praise you for it
[2:13:04] right now. Every elect seed that heard
[2:13:08] this today, and maybe some that not even
[2:13:09] in yet, they may go back and archive it
[2:13:11] later. Maybe they're drunk as a dog this
[2:13:13] morning. Don't even know who they are.
[2:13:16] But if they're yours, you'll find them
[2:13:17] and bring them in.
[2:13:19] Lord God, we'll give you praise at that
[2:13:22] day for that word because we were washed
[2:13:25] and loosed from our bitterness, loosed
[2:13:28] from our stubbornness, loose from our
[2:13:31] hissing and our poison in our mouths.
[2:13:35] Hallelujah.
[2:13:37] We traded out the hissing for couping.
[2:13:41] Praise God. We got rid of poison and we
[2:13:45] traded it out with scriptures that in
[2:13:47] our mouth were the words of life.
[2:13:52] We worship you today, Lord Jesus.
[2:13:55] Thank you, Father.
[2:13:57] Thank you, Father.
[2:14:00] Sing something for us, Harry. Children,
[2:14:03] don't leave this place today
[2:14:04] discouraged. Don't leave disheartened,
[2:14:08] but be encouraged.
[2:14:10] Maybe what you heard is 10,000 miles
[2:14:14] from where you currently are,
[2:14:17] but know that the Lord God sent it to
[2:14:19] you because he loves you.
[2:14:22] And somebody here is going to attain to
[2:14:24] it.
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; You want it to be you. You
[2:14:30] sir.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; If I have a choice,
[2:14:34] I choose this.
[2:14:38] If I can choose bitterness or
[2:14:40] forgiveness,
[2:14:42] I choose forgiveness.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; If I can choose rat poison or a big map,
[2:14:48] I'll choose a big map. I ain't talking
[2:14:51] about for me. I'm talking about my
[2:14:52] enemy.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Is that what you choose? Amen.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; And let's walk out of here today when we
[2:15:03] depart this place
[2:15:05] with a determination greater than we've
[2:15:07] ever had in in our lives. I want to
[2:15:11] become
[2:15:12] what I'm hearing preached.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; I want to become
[2:15:20] what I'm hearing preached.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace, I will.
[2:15:27] It's my desire.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; It's my desire.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Sing something for us. Let's just
[2:15:33] worship together now.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Change my heart, oh God.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:15:41] Let's just love him together now just a
[2:15:43] little bit before you go eat dinner.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.

[2:16:31] but make me like you, Lord.
