[9:58] hello hello everyone
[10:01] my name is brother Rob Weber it's good
[10:03] to have you all I enjoyed today with you
[10:05] uh and as I was thinking about what to
[10:08] say to open tonight's service I after
[10:09] enjoying playing all those games and
[10:11] things that most of you well some of you
[10:13] didn't like some of you did uh it's just
[10:16] something to me to see a bunch of young
[10:17] people and Holiness and youth of my
[10:19] vision and what heaven will be when I
[10:21] started dealing with the youth I thought
[10:22] my goodness this is a glimpse of what
[10:24] heaven will be young faces in holiness
[10:28] and not that we are perfect in this
[10:29] world but just something that just
[10:30] struck me so strong and
[10:32] um I get to be here I get to be here
[10:34] with you guys and it's something so
[10:36] precious to me and you know it realized
[10:38] we had 150 children last night tonight
[10:39] we might have some more still people
[10:42] coming in
[10:44] do you know we really don't have any
[10:45] issues
[10:47] I mean we have our little fusses and
[10:48] things we might have a little thing in a
[10:50] basketball court or not but but it was
[10:52] just a time to relax and have fun with
[10:54] the body
[10:55] how rare that is becoming in the world
[10:58] it's something it's a sanctuary it's a
[11:00] safety God brings us together in Oneness
[11:02] and not that everything's perfect here
[11:04] and never will be but an opportunity for
[11:06] 150 kids teenagers to get together with
[11:09] complexes and and all kinds of things
[11:11] that they're worried about or looking
[11:13] for a girl looking for a boy trying to
[11:14] act perfect
[11:15] and yet we all have love for each other
[11:18] and and and happiness
[11:20] I thank you for that
[11:22] I thank God for putting me in an
[11:24] atmosphere that I could I can witness
[11:25] that here on Earth
[11:27] and I just I it's so wonderful don't
[11:30] take it for granted as you look out in
[11:32] the world you look out whether it be
[11:33] school or whether it be sports or
[11:35] whether it be what other things that we
[11:36] do and we're called to other things as
[11:38] well but to recognize the time that
[11:40] you've been given that is peace
[11:43] and now we look forward to another
[11:44] service we had a wonderful service last
[11:45] night I thought as far as wasn't that
[11:47] fantastic
[11:49] interruptions right and I thought I
[11:53] thought that was I picked blue or pink I
[11:55] thought that was a gender reveal I
[11:56] thought that's why I said boys boys rule
[11:58] you know I pick blue and everything but
[12:00] I was totally wrong on that so didn't
[12:01] follow that
[12:03] we're going to open the Service tonight
[12:04] and we look forward to something else
[12:06] that God has for us and so thankful to
[12:07] see all of you oh my goodness in
[12:09] supporting these meetings I'm glad that
[12:10] we have a church that we're able to do
[12:12] this now it's something that I didn't
[12:13] think was possible and now to see it
[12:15] happen in fruition it's really just a
[12:17] blessing from the Lord so uh pull on the
[12:19] gift of God get what you have need of
[12:21] tonight okay and uh let's see we have
[12:24] brother Michael leading Us in song today
[12:26] he'll be up here in a second and um
[12:29] just give you one one scripture that
[12:31] struck my heart as I was praying before
[12:33] the service
[12:34] it's John 17 15. I pray not that thou
[12:37] should take them out of the world
[12:39] the more I see of the world the more I
[12:41] want to come out
[12:43] that I want less and less to do with it
[12:44] Jesus on prayer I pray not that thou
[12:47] should take them out of the world but
[12:49] that thou shall just keep them from the
[12:50] evil
[12:52] that's my prayer keep us from evil keep
[12:55] us together let perfect Oneness abound
[12:57] okay
[12:59] God bless you all have a wonderful time
[13:01] in God today
[13:04] [Applause]
[13:14] [Music]
[13:17] God bless you all we're just going to
[13:19] start with singing The Heart of Worship
[13:21] so I believe that's where we're at right
[13:23] now in the Heart of Worship and if you
[13:25] just have an expectation to be in that
[13:27] place and stay in worship just watch
[13:29] what God will do for the service and for
[13:31] you
[13:33] in the music fades
[13:36] [Music]
[13:37] away

[13:41] and I simply come
[13:45] [Music]
[13:49] longing just you
[13:51] to bring
[13:54] something that's a word
[13:57] that won't bless your heart
[14:05] I'll bring you more than a song
[14:10] for a song in itself is not what you
[14:16] have required
[14:22] you search much deeper within
[14:27] to the way things appear you're looking
[14:32] into my heart
[14:35] [Music]
[14:38] I'm coming back to the heart
[14:44] worship
[14:46] and it's all about you
[14:50] it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord
[14:57] for the thing I made it and it's all
[15:03] about you
[15:06] it's all about you Jesus
[15:12] king of in this world
[15:16] and no one could express
[15:20] how much you deserve
[15:26] [Music]
[15:29] until I'm
[15:30] weakened poor God
[15:34] all I have is yours every single
[15:40] breath
[15:42] this should be us right now I'll bring
[15:46] you more than a song for a song in
[15:52] itself is not what you have required
[15:58] [Music]
[16:01] you search much deeper within to the way
[16:07] things appear you're looking into my
[16:13] heart
[16:15] [Music]
[16:18] I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship
[16:25] and it's all about you
[16:29] it's all about you Jesus I'm sorry Lord
[16:36] for the peace
[16:41] and it's all about you
[16:46] it's all about you
[16:50] and I'm sorry the Lord for the thing as

[17:30] that that you
[17:32] not necessarily I think are perfect but
[17:33] I haven't really done much wrong
[17:35] but it's those people God trusts and

[42:21] they didn't because I didn't bring none
[42:23] with me
[42:24] but uh no we appreciate I thought that
[42:28] was a good illustration he used there
[42:30] last night and and uh it just goes to
[42:33] show you the power of suggestion you
[42:36] know and just uh you know that's exactly
[42:38] the tactics of the enemy and so we just
[42:41] want to remember that tonight amen how
[42:43] many would have a knee tonight you just
[42:44] want to make it known by uplifted hand
[42:47] we just want to go to the Lord tonight
[42:48] and as we pray let's just lift those
[42:51] things up before the Lord Lord Jesus we
[42:53] just thank you Lord for another
[42:54] opportunity that you've given us to come
[42:57] and just gather together tonight and and
[43:00] Lord we look out and we see this group
[43:02] of young people and and Lord as we've
[43:06] said already we're so proud lord to see
[43:09] God that Lord you know as your Prophet
[43:12] said every generation gets a chance at
[43:15] the word and Lord when I look out and I
[43:18] see this generation of young people and
[43:21] and Lord I see what they're doing with
[43:23] their chance
[43:24] Lord I'm certainly proud to be
[43:27] identified with that and Lord we're so
[43:30] thankful God that you've given given us
[43:32] this time and Lord to come together and
[43:35] Lord and have fellowship with one
[43:37] another and and Lord they've enjoyed
[43:39] theirselves and their there's other
[43:41] activities and things that they'll
[43:43] continue to do but but God these this
[43:46] this is a special moment now Lord where
[43:49] we come Lord into the sanctuary and Lord
[43:52] we're looking into your word and and
[43:54] Lord we just asked God that you would
[43:56] just come and and Lord that you would be
[43:59] Lord not an onlooker tonight or just an
[44:03] unseen guest Lord or a recording Angel
[44:05] but but God we're inviting you to take
[44:08] preeminence in this service and we want
[44:11] you to have an active part Lord and Lord
[44:14] we want you to speak to us Lord and Lord
[44:16] I pray that you would anoint lips of
[44:18] clay and anoint our hearts Lord to Lord

[44:26] alone it would take you to actually
[44:28] change your life Lord we could we can

[44:34] we're so limited and what we could do as
[44:36] men but Lord we know Lord what your
[44:39] power can do and Lord therefore we're
[44:41] asking you to come we're inviting you to
[44:43] come and Lord we're not only inviting
[44:46] you to come but Lord we're giving you
[44:47] the preeminence and so God Just Have
[44:50] Your Way in this service speak to us God
[44:52] as we commit ourselves into your hands
[44:54] now we give this service to You For Your
[44:57] Glory
[44:58] in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you
[45:02] take your Bibles we'll turn to the Book
[45:03] of Matthew
[45:05] and I'd like to read one verse there and
[45:08] then I'd also read uh it's Matthew
[45:10] chapter 4. and verse number 17.
[45:16] just one verse of scripture there and
[45:18] then also from The Book of John John
[45:20] chapter 6.
[45:23] and I'll read verse 66.
[45:28] Matthew chapter 4.
[45:31] and the 17th verse
[45:36] and the Bible says from that time
[45:39] Jesus began to preach and to say repent
[45:43] for the Kingdom of Heaven is a hand
[45:48] in the Book of John in the sixth chapter
[45:52] in the 66th verse
[46:01] and from that time
[46:03] many of his disciples went back
[46:06] and walk with him
[46:09] or I'm sorry walk no more with him
[46:13] amen this of course is just after Jesus
[46:16] had begun to say unto them except a man
[46:20] um you know Eat My Flesh and drink my
[46:23] bloody have no life and
[46:25] and then you know the multitudes begin
[46:28] to walk away
[46:29] and I think that is striking there it
[46:32] says from that time see many of his
[46:36] disciples went back and walked no more
[46:39] with him amen may God add His blessings
[46:41] as you're seated tonight
[46:43] I'd like to just take a few minutes and
[46:47] I'm going to speak to you um
[46:50] uh just got some things that's on her
[46:53] heart and I want to speak to you if I
[46:57] had a title would be from that time and
[46:59] of course we know brother Branham spoke
[47:01] many times he would take the the title
[47:05] uh and take the text there and and
[47:08] preach he you know sometimes he would
[47:10] title and from that time or from that
[47:13] time and and so
[47:15] um you know I believe that some of these
[47:17] simple things that that the prophet
[47:19] would say you know brother brother Daryl
[47:21] uh some of the sermons that brother
[47:24] Brown would preach over and over and
[47:26] over you know to to some it may seem
[47:28] like it's simple but I believe that if a
[47:30] prophet of God that was sent to an age
[47:34] thought enough about it to to preach it
[47:36] not just to preach it but to preach it
[47:39] over again I believe that there's got to
[47:41] be something in it that God's trying to
[47:43] to uh to speak to us and and so I'd like
[47:46] to just look at some of these things
[47:48] tonight and and so I'm going to read a
[47:50] few quotes out of the sermon and from
[47:52] that time and some several different
[47:54] places but brother Brown would say
[47:58] um there in 1959 in Jeffersonville he
[48:01] said you know as as human beings we all
[48:04] think of things from a certain time such
[48:07] and such a thing is taking place and
[48:09] from that time see and now many times
[48:11] you meet an old man or an old woman and
[48:14] they like to refer back to a time that's
[48:17] something had taken place and they can
[48:19] can distinctively Market out and say it
[48:22] was at that time see and now I suppose
[48:26] that there's practically all of us here
[48:28] tonight could call to a memory or to a
[48:31] remembrance of certain things that's
[48:33] taken place at certain times and from
[48:35] from that time something changed see
[48:38] such a such a thing and it happened at
[48:40] that time and from that time on it was
[48:42] different and it's a good thing that we
[48:45] can can and some of those memories of
[48:47] things that we think of as worthy things
[48:49] that changed and then there's some
[48:51] things that's not so worthy of thinking
[48:53] of but see he's trying to show us that
[48:55] there was a time that it that it changed
[48:58] there was a time there was something
[49:00] even uh you know maybe there was a a
[49:02] certain situation or a certain thing
[49:05] that happened and it's something that
[49:07] you can always go back to and remember
[49:09] and you know it's like a um you know a
[49:13] place that uh uh you know you can always
[49:16] Market that that was the time that that
[49:18] things begin that's where it started
[49:20] I'll just put it like that that's where
[49:22] it started at and so brother Brown would
[49:25] say he said there's a time where you
[49:26] start see yes there was a time when all
[49:30] this stuff started there was a time when
[49:31] death started that's uh when Eve was
[49:34] strolling one day down through the
[49:36] Garden of Eden and met Satan and what
[49:38] did Brother Brown say he said so he's
[49:40] showing you that that you know it
[49:43] started there in the Garden of Eden but
[49:45] Brethren said when did it start it
[49:47] started when Eve stopped amen he let me
[49:51] just read it the way he said he said
[49:53] many are like Eve Eve just stopped long
[49:56] enough to be deceived if she hadn't have
[49:59] stopped there had never been no
[50:00] deceiving see but Eve stopped and when
[50:03] she stopped that's where she got her
[50:05] just deceiving instead of pressing on
[50:07] Amen they're in the greatest battle ever
[50:09] fought he said if Satan can get through
[50:12] there he's talking about through the the
[50:13] channels of of your five senses in the
[50:17] five senses of your spirit even which we
[50:20] know is a reason and conscience and
[50:22] memory imaginations and so forth amen
[50:25] and brother and brother Adam said if
[50:26] Satan can get through there by these and
[50:29] and and and and through the conscience
[50:31] and all these other things and he gets
[50:33] right down there in the mind now and if
[50:35] he can just get you uh uh then then and
[50:39] then you have to let him in brother
[50:40] Brown said you have to let him in you
[50:42] see amen he's coming with a thought amen
[50:45] but you have to let him in amen and then
[50:48] he says and then when he gets in now
[50:50] he's got control and then what does he
[50:52] do he begins to use the conscience he
[50:54] begins to use this he begins to use the
[50:57] outlet see what is it of taste feel
[50:59] smell hear imaginations conscience
[51:01] memory reasons affections he begins to
[51:04] use all those different little channels
[51:06] and as long as he could get uh get in
[51:09] above this one here then he's coming to
[51:12] your mind and first you have to accept
[51:14] it amen amen when it when Satan walked
[51:18] up to Eve and said you know the fruit is
[51:20] Pleasant she stopped for a moment see
[51:23] and that's where she made her mistake
[51:25] amen when she stopped for a moment don't
[51:27] you stop for nothing you got a message
[51:30] Jesus Lives God Is A Healer that's the
[51:33] mess don't you stop for nothing don't
[51:35] stop for no reason or nothing else amen
[51:38] but see she stopped for a moment and
[51:40] that's when Satan walked right into that
[51:42] mind and said well it sounds reasonable
[51:45] even now oh don't do that amen you just
[51:48] take what God Said Amen if I could
[51:51] encourage you with anything tonight amen
[51:53] you just take what God Said Amen don't
[51:55] you stop for nothing don't you amen even
[51:58] listen amen don't you even uh entertain
[52:01] amen the devil's thoughts
[52:04] can you say amen amen don't amen make
[52:08] this mistake to stop because amen watch
[52:11] what brother Brown's saying amen it
[52:13] started when she stopped amen that's
[52:16] where it started amen you know I was
[52:18] thinking about this and amen I'm just
[52:19] going to mention I'll come back around
[52:21] to it but brother Branham went in to
[52:23] pray amen you know they were having a
[52:25] meeting and there was a there was a lot
[52:27] of bad cases there and some of them was
[52:29] uh you know uh uh uh you know insane and
[52:32] so forth he said someone was even in
[52:34] straight jackets they couldn't even
[52:35] bring them in the public so they had a
[52:38] place set aside and brother Ben and went
[52:39] in there to pray and when he ran in
[52:41] there there was a a young lady in there
[52:43] and she began to talk to brother about
[52:45] he didn't even recognize that she had a
[52:47] problem but she began to talk to brother
[52:49] Branham and she began to tell him a
[52:51] little bit about her situation and and
[52:53] when she did she said you know I was
[52:55] raised in a good home and I I was raised
[52:58] by good parents and you know and I was
[53:00] taught right from wrong she said but one
[53:03] day I went out with a boy you know and
[53:05] and against her parents wishes she she
[53:07] began to go out with this boy and and
[53:09] she begins to tell him how it all
[53:11] started and she said you know she took a
[53:14] drink and and it just started right
[53:16] there just amen look friends amen it all
[53:19] started with one bad decision
[53:22] amen just one little drink and amen and
[53:25] it didn't end there but amen it just
[53:28] continued right on until that girl was
[53:30] in such a shape and she was in an insane
[53:33] institution amen listen even I'll tell
[53:36] you there ain't no end to the depths of
[53:37] Satan amen and the devil will take you
[53:40] amen father than you you ever want to go
[53:43] amen but it all starts somewhere it just
[53:46] starts with with one drink or or one
[53:49] look or amen just one touch or one bad
[53:52] decision amen you see one time that you
[53:55] ignore amen your parents and and you
[53:58] ignore amen good instructions and that's
[54:00] where it starts right there and then
[54:02] from that time see something began to
[54:04] change that brother man talked about a
[54:06] man that lied all the time and he said
[54:08] he said I thought he was joking he said
[54:10] he told such crazy stories that he meant
[54:13] it was just unbelievable he said I
[54:15] thought the guy was joking he said but
[54:17] he I sat down and began to talk to him I
[54:19] said why do you do that he said well he
[54:21] said it all start started with he said I
[54:24] remember exactly where it started the
[54:25] first lie I ever told he said I I was
[54:28] out there smoking some cigarettes and he
[54:31] said I ate a bunch of coffee trying to
[54:33] cover up my breath so my mama wouldn't
[54:35] find out he said but I got home my mama
[54:37] you know she she said Son what have you
[54:39] been doing amen there's something about
[54:41] mamas they just know don't they amen you
[54:44] young people know what I'm talking about
[54:45] you think you got it all figured out and
[54:47] hid and amen you covered it up real good
[54:49] but that Mom will find you out buddy
[54:51] amen and she she knew he'd been doing
[54:55] something and she said come here let me
[54:57] smell your breath and smelled that
[54:58] coffee on his breath and and she said
[55:00] what have you been doing what you're
[55:02] trying to cover up you've been out there
[55:03] smoking cigarettes he said oh no mama
[55:05] amen but he told Brother Benham he said
[55:08] amen some me and me was telling me that
[55:11] I ought to tell her the truth he said
[55:13] there there's something down inside of
[55:15] me was telling me I ought to be honest
[55:17] with her about it amen but he ignored
[55:20] that voice and he told her a lie he said
[55:23] Mama I promise I ain't been smoking
[55:24] cigarettes he said and from that day to
[55:27] this I can't stop lying and brother
[55:28] Brown said he told so many lies till he
[55:31] believed him himself amen think about it
[55:33] friends that's exactly you just think
[55:34] one little innocent thing like that if
[55:37] we could say it that way amen that's
[55:39] where it started but that ain't where it
[55:40] ends see
[55:42] amen just one little lie amen just one
[55:44] little look amen think about this
[55:46] brother I'm talking about the the maniac
[55:48] there of godira amen he said no doubt it
[55:51] was a sociable God-fearing citizen once
[55:54] lived and he got with the wrong crowd
[55:55] and maybe just he just got married had
[55:58] two or three little kids even but he got
[56:00] mixed up with the wrong group and that's
[56:02] where many a young man and a young woman
[56:04] loses out I'm getting mixed up with the
[56:07] wrong group with wrong Associates see
[56:10] amen and so one night they're taking him
[56:12] out and gave him a drink said oh let's
[56:14] just play a little game or do this or
[56:16] gamble a little bit it won't hurt
[56:17] nothing and then the first devil entered
[56:19] him right there amen and he went home
[56:21] and he had to tell his wife a lie and
[56:24] the second devil entered him right there
[56:26] until he was possessed with a legion of
[56:28] devils could you imagine amen you see
[56:31] what the prophet is saying amen amen
[56:33] when he went down there to that place he
[56:34] knew he had no business being that's
[56:36] where the first devil come in and then
[56:38] when he went home instead of Amen being
[56:40] honest and repenting amen amen he told a
[56:43] lie about where he had been and that's
[56:45] where the second devil come amen listen
[56:47] friends I'm telling you it's a reality
[56:49] this ain't just a story amen this ain't
[56:51] just something amen that the prophet
[56:53] dreamed up this is a reality that's how
[56:55] amen you get in the shape you're in amen
[56:57] listen free as you taught me any drug
[56:59] addict any alcoholic amen any sinner out
[57:02] there in the world you want to talk to
[57:03] amen they'll tell you amen amen amen
[57:06] they don't even know how they got in the
[57:08] shape they got in even if they didn't
[57:09] wake up one day amen just a full-blown
[57:12] drunk they didn't wake up one day amen
[57:14] just completely overtaken and Addicted
[57:17] by drugs and all them kind of things
[57:19] amen it all started somewhere amen maybe
[57:21] just with a little lie amen maybe just
[57:24] it started amen by going to a certain
[57:26] website that you know you ain't got no
[57:28] business being on that amen but amen you
[57:31] take one look and the next thing you
[57:32] know amen instead of you coming and
[57:35] repenting and raking that thing right
[57:36] amen you gotta lie about that amen and
[57:39] then another Devil comes in amen then
[57:42] after a while amen you went so far and
[57:45] you're so bound amen by demons amen that
[57:48] you could be in the very condition amen
[57:50] that Legion found himself in
[57:53] and oh one night they take listen amen
[57:57] the prophet of God said amen that the
[58:00] devil amen kept on uh uh uh driving this
[58:04] man amen he drove him right on out into
[58:07] the tombs amen did you ever notice the
[58:10] devil likes the dwell in the tombs the
[58:13] devil stays around all dead places amen
[58:16] and I don't include that don't exclude
[58:18] rather churches either amen when they
[58:20] get cold it becomes a devil's hangout I
[58:23] say oh God Amen don't ever let our
[58:25] churches get cold amen listen Riz don't
[58:28] you never let your experience get cold
[58:30] amen don't you never Amen Let You amen
[58:33] your experience with God get cold amen
[58:36] because that's where the devil likes to
[58:37] hang around amen but watch what the
[58:39] prophet of God said and we see this poor
[58:42] old fella Legion out there maybe once in
[58:44] a while like what brother Brown said
[58:45] once in a while he would come to himself
[58:47] and he would just look and say what am I
[58:49] doing here amen look amen look there's
[58:52] chains all around him and thank things
[58:53] like that his body all cut up and the
[58:56] devil would throw him back into his
[58:57] spell and here he'd go and then maybe
[58:59] he'd come back around again and think I
[59:01] got a wife and children somewhere and
[59:03] the first thing you know the devil would
[59:04] pull him right back down into another
[59:06] spell and here he'd go amen but think
[59:09] about it all started amen with one
[59:11] little lie amen it all started amen just
[59:13] with one bad decision amen think about
[59:16] that's just how it starts amen and the
[59:18] devil will come to you amen like the
[59:20] prophet of God said amen Eve made her
[59:23] mistake when she stopped and listened to
[59:26] the devil's life
[59:27] amen listen Friends James the fourth
[59:30] chapter says resist the devil
[59:33] amen listen amen the Bible tells us what
[59:36] did James say he says submit yourself
[59:38] therefore to God and resist the devil
[59:41] and he will flee from you
[59:43] amen and brother Brandon would pick it
[59:45] up in perfect faith and he said we're
[59:47] taught to resist the devil and he'll
[59:48] flee from us now to resist him is simply
[59:51] to turn him down
[59:53] amen just resist him that's right just
[59:55] walk away from it amen let me tell you I
[59:58] think there's too many of us it's given
[1:00:01] the devil too much attention
[1:00:04] amen and we're listening to him for too
[1:00:06] long
[1:00:07] amen you're giving him too much of your
[1:00:10] time friend amen you ought to resist
[1:00:12] that devil amen you ought to amen stand
[1:00:15] up against that devil amen just turn him
[1:00:18] down flat even just walk away
[1:00:21] hallelujah amen I tell you what friends
[1:00:23] anything that's trying to lead you away
[1:00:25] from God or his word amen you ought to
[1:00:28] walk away from that thing you ought to
[1:00:30] resist it even cast it down don't listen
[1:00:33] to it
[1:00:37] the greatest spout I ever fought brother
[1:00:39] Brown says see his tactic see what he's
[1:00:42] trying to do the first human being he's
[1:00:44] trying to anoint that precious woman
[1:00:46] there God's daughter with unbelief in
[1:00:48] God's word that's exactly what he's
[1:00:50] trying to get her to do
[1:00:52] that's what he's trying to do to you
[1:00:54] honey brother Brown's speaking to
[1:00:56] somebody in the audience there a little
[1:00:57] girl that was sick his sister that was
[1:00:59] sick he said that's what he's trying to

[1:01:03] to do get her to doubt God's word

[1:19:04] hallelujah amen you say brother what do
[1:19:06] you mean I believe he's here because he
[1:19:09] promised to be here
[1:19:11] oh friends if I if he would show himself

[1:19:17] and thank God for that remember I'm not
[1:19:19] preaching against that how many loves to
[1:19:21] feel God
[1:19:22] I mean he's ever felt God
[1:19:24] amen amen you have you felt God how many
[1:19:27] loves to feel God Amen and we believe
[1:19:29] amen that God will come sometimes and we
[1:19:32] thank God for them blessings and he
[1:19:33] comes down and that's a great blessing
[1:19:35] to be able to feel the presence of the
[1:19:36] Lord amen but I'm telling you this
[1:19:38] whether I see him or whether I feel him
[1:19:41] it don't make no difference to me
[1:19:43] tonight amen my Bible says we're two or
[1:19:45] three are gathered together in my name
[1:19:48] there will I be in the midst amen so if
[1:19:51] I don't see nothing and I don't feel
[1:19:54] nothing I can still declare unto you
[1:19:56] tonight that he is here hallelujah the
[1:20:00] one that can help you is in the building
[1:20:03] tonight
[1:20:08] and as soon as they told blind bar
[1:20:10] tomorrow Mayors Jesus is near he cried
[1:20:13] out that son of David have mercy on me
[1:20:17] listen friends the prophet shows it very
[1:20:19] clearly it was all kinds of things going
[1:20:21] on there was all kind of noise amen
[1:20:23] Jesus didn't hear him with his natural
[1:20:25] ears amen but blind Bartimaeus was not
[1:20:28] crying out amen just with a loud voice
[1:20:30] although I believe he was amen but I
[1:20:32] believe that he was crying out in the
[1:20:35] spirit
[1:20:38] and the Bible says that Jesus
[1:20:42] Stood Still
[1:20:46] The Cry of that blind man
[1:20:49] stop Jesus in his tracks
[1:20:52] and Jesus Stood Still
[1:20:55] and Jesus
[1:20:57] told him
[1:20:58] what did he do he bit him come
[1:21:01] and the Bible said he left to his feet
[1:21:03] cast off His Garment
[1:21:07] oh friends amen he made his way to Jesus
[1:21:10] and let me just say this to you tonight
[1:21:12] amen because blind Bartimaeus is known
[1:21:15] in the scripture as blind Bartimaeus
[1:21:17] amen but that was only a name that was
[1:21:21] attached to him because of a condition
[1:21:24] that is not who he was amen I can show
[1:21:27] you examples all through the scripture
[1:21:29] amen Rahab the Harlot amen Tom doubting
[1:21:33] Thomas amen Legion was known as Legion
[1:21:37] amen that was not his name amen that was
[1:21:40] a name attached to him because of a
[1:21:41] condition amen but when they met Jesus
[1:21:45] hallelujah amen when blind Bartimaeus
[1:21:47] met Jesus the Blind part had to fall off
[1:21:51] because brother amen once he come in
[1:21:53] contact with Jesus he was no longer
[1:21:55] blind Bartimaeus he was simply part of
[1:21:58] mass Hallelujah and they may have passed
[1:22:01] all kind of names on you and rightfully
[1:22:03] so but that ain't who you are tonight
[1:22:05] that's only representing a condition
[1:22:07] that you may be in but I want to tell
[1:22:10] you something not if you can ever meet
[1:22:12] Jesus amen that part that attached part
[1:22:15] even that identification of your
[1:22:18] condition will have to fall off
[1:22:22] Hallelujah even doubting Thomas once he
[1:22:26] reached out and touched them nail
[1:22:27] scarred ass he was no longer doubting
[1:22:30] Thomas he was now a believing son of the
[1:22:34] most high god brother he reached out and
[1:22:36] touched his hand and he said Jesus my
[1:22:40] Lord and my God
[1:22:45] when rehab come in contact with the god
[1:22:48] of Israel she wasn't no Harley no more
[1:22:53] oh no she was elevated to the very
[1:22:56] lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:22:57] come on Church
[1:22:59] don't you let the devil identify Who You
[1:23:02] Are
[1:23:04] don't you let this world attach no name
[1:23:06] on you
[1:23:09] come on Friends
[1:23:11] that ain't Who You Are
[1:23:13] I know the devil come along trying to
[1:23:15] tell you I know he's trying to attach
[1:23:17] all every every kind of uh uh name Amen
[1:23:21] to your life because of a condition
[1:23:23] perhaps or or or some kind of situation
[1:23:27] or circumstance amen but I tell you what
[1:23:30] amen if you ever meet Jesus one time
[1:23:32] amen there are some other things that
[1:23:34] will be attached to your name hallelujah
[1:23:36] amen you won't be a blind Bartimaeus
[1:23:39] amen but amen that you're being
[1:23:41] Overcomer
[1:23:44] hallelujah amen there'll be some other
[1:23:46] things attached to your name like an
[1:23:48] overcomer like a Believer like
[1:23:51] invincible
[1:23:53] Hallelujah you believe that tonight

[1:34:06] they they didn't want them no Revival in
[1:34:08] their country

[1:35:26] and remain the same
[1:35:31] you know brother brother Brown teaches
[1:35:34] us something very powerful
[1:35:36] he says
[1:35:37] every time you come together even like
[1:35:39] this
[1:35:40] you're changed
[1:35:42] you cannot leave the same way you came
[1:35:46] you got you're either going to leave
[1:35:47] better or you're going to leave worse
[1:35:49] how many days that's true
[1:35:52] amen how many would like to just make a
[1:35:54] make up your mind tonight and go ahead
[1:35:56] and make a decision right now I'm going
[1:35:58] to leave here better
[1:36:02] I'm going to leave here better I'm going
[1:36:03] to leave amen with more of God
[1:36:06] I'm going to leave with a closer walk
[1:36:09] I'm going to leave here amen with a
[1:36:11] renewing and a refreshing and a re and a
[1:36:15] more consecrated dedicated life in in
[1:36:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:36:21] because you can't leave the same
[1:36:23] you cannot meet God and stay the same
[1:36:26] you know what brother Brown said
[1:36:28] he said one day you're on your own
[1:36:30] Calvary when God Met Death
[1:36:32] he said God and death met face to face
[1:36:34] and when life and death come together
[1:36:37] that's when life Christ pulled the
[1:36:39] stinger out of death and since that time
[1:36:42] death hadn't had no stinger in it he
[1:36:45] said I'm so glad of that death and God
[1:36:47] met together and death hasn't been the
[1:36:50] same since amen it ain't got no Stinger
[1:36:53] to it no more a Christian believer can
[1:36:55] walk right into the face of it and say
[1:36:56] oh death where is your sting old grave
[1:36:59] where is your Victory they both met God
[1:37:01] and they ain't been the same since
[1:37:03] Hallelujah and no man can be the same
[1:37:06] nothing can be the same once it meets
[1:37:10] God
[1:37:11] hallelujah let me tell you his friends

[1:38:26] been trained in all the wisdom all the
[1:38:28] Theology of the word of God he noted by
[1:38:31] letter he'd been to school he had all

[1:38:36] could teach the Egyptian soldiers and

[1:38:40] letter but he was a coward with it
[1:38:43] run out there and went on the backside
[1:38:44] of the desert hurting sheep
[1:38:47] but there come a time
[1:38:49] when God met him there in a burning bush
[1:38:53] and from that time on
[1:38:55] Moses was changed

[1:40:58] at the burning bush he already had it in
[1:41:01] his hand
[1:41:03] it was the same old stick brother Bram
[1:41:05] called a crooked stick it was the same
[1:41:06] stick
[1:41:09] Israel was still captive
[1:41:13] Pharaoh was still pharaoh
[1:41:15] the Egyptian Army was still the same
[1:41:17] Army
[1:41:19] listen every condition everything every
[1:41:22] circumstance that was before the Burning
[1:41:24] Bush was the same circumstance after the
[1:41:27] burning bush
[1:41:29] the only thing that changed was a heart
[1:41:32] that was in that prophet
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:36] Hallelujah let me just say this tonight
[1:41:38] amen amen if God would change you

[1:42:15] in the world listen for his the pull of
[1:42:18] the world will still be there
[1:42:20] but there'll be something different
[1:42:22] because there'll be another ball
[1:42:25] and the other bull will be greater than
[1:42:28] the pull of the world

[1:42:34] change everything

[1:43:56] face to face with God
[1:43:58] in one place brother Brown would tied

[2:22:30] the more I find here foreign
[2:22:37] [Music]
[2:23:12] from that time on
[2:23:14] think of that one
[2:23:16] all those that turned away from me when
[2:23:18] he brought the word
[2:23:21] but there was those that when the word
[2:23:22] came forth from that time on
[2:23:24] they followed him
[2:23:27] there's many here tonight there's some
[2:23:29] of y'all can remember when you got the
[2:23:30] Holy Ghost
[2:23:31] some can't some options God's just
[2:23:33] stealed in your soul that by Revelation
[2:23:36] that you have it there are some that can
[2:23:37] remember that time
[2:23:39] when God put his life in you and sealed
[2:23:43] that life in you to the day your
[2:23:45] Redemption you could remember where you
[2:23:46] was what you were doing how it felt and
[2:23:48] from that time
[2:23:50] but from that time
[2:23:52] till today
[2:23:54] Satan has talked to you every day
[2:23:58] he's made you doubt that every day
[2:24:01] he told you you didn't get healed I
[2:24:02] don't know how many times I've had youth
[2:24:03] come up to me and said brother Joe I
[2:24:05] don't I don't I don't think I got the
[2:24:07] Holy Ghost I got prayed for it I didn't
[2:24:08] think I got the Holy Ghost
[2:24:12] [Music]
[2:24:26] it's just don't listen to a lie of the
[2:24:28] devil
[2:24:29] don't listen to one thing that Satan's
[2:24:31] got to say to you
[2:24:32] you could tell him you take him back to
[2:24:34] that time and you say Satan you remember
[2:24:36] from that time
[2:24:38] from that time
[2:24:41] it might have been last year might have
[2:24:43] been the last campaign you went to might
[2:24:45] have been the prayer line you went
[2:24:46] through but you can point him and if you
[2:24:48] can't Point him there you point him to
[2:24:50] Calvary
[2:24:52] that's where it happened
[2:24:54] yeah
[2:24:55] because Jesus said those that walked
[2:24:58] away from him Jesus Jesus told them
[2:25:01] I'm gonna go away in a little bit
[2:25:05] they turned around and walked away from
[2:25:06] him
[2:25:07] and he told him he said I'm I'm going
[2:25:09] away soon
[2:25:12] he said but I'll come again
[2:25:14] I'll be with you
[2:25:16] and I'll be in you to the end of the
[2:25:18] world
[2:25:19] that was a promise
[2:25:21] he didn't give you any instructions to
[2:25:22] do that so you got to do this you've got
[2:25:24] to you've got to live this way you've
[2:25:25] got to say this he said it's a free gift
[2:25:28] it's a free gift so if you leave tonight
[2:25:30] without it that's not his fault
[2:25:34] he's offering it to you he wants to give
[2:25:36] it to you more
[2:25:38] than you want it me and brother Josh was
[2:25:41] talking last night about young people
[2:25:43] wanting the Holy Ghost
[2:25:45] they think it's so hard they think it's
[2:25:47] some special remedy that you've got to
[2:25:49] get to get the Holy Ghost
[2:25:51] like I said brother God wants to give it
[2:25:53] to you more than you want it
[2:25:55] you just have to desire it more than
[2:25:57] anything else in your life
[2:26:00] anything you have in your life that you
[2:26:02] enjoy that you like that you want when
[2:26:06] you get to the point where you desire
[2:26:08] the Holy Ghost more than the greatest
[2:26:10] thing you desire
[2:26:12] you'll have it that's a promise
[2:26:16] that's a promise God's never failed one
[2:26:19] time
[2:26:20] he's never slipped up one time he's
[2:26:22] never made one mistake
[2:26:24] and he's got the easiest remedy to
[2:26:26] Salvation and eternal life that has ever
[2:26:28] been
[2:26:31] so I urge you tonight
[2:26:33] make that your main goal whether it's
[2:26:36] tonight whether it's tomorrow the next
[2:26:38] day whatever your purpose you wake up
[2:26:40] with that
[2:26:41] my main goal is life in this life is to
[2:26:44] receive his life in here
[2:26:45] nothing else matters because anything
[2:26:47] else that you would possess
[2:26:49] that you hold so dear you're not taking
[2:26:51] it with you that's the only thing that
