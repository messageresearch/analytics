brought little children to you and you laed your hands on them and bless them I'm certainly not you but I'm here to represent you so we bring his little life into your great presence and ask you that you'd watch over him that you'd keep him Lord if he would get old enough to be able to know right from wrong may his heart be gentle towards you when he's young help my sister help my brother that

father again another mother and father that have assumed this responsibility that you've given to them on the earth in an age when people are so selfish and instead of bringing children into the Earth that kill them before they have have a chance to even live how grateful we are Lord for parents that assume it oh it's difficult it's hard it's a quite a challenge we pray that You' just bless them Lord bless mother and father bless the little children that's already been born and dedicated to you now we bring the little brother to you today Father that you'd be able to keep your hand upon him watch over him Lord dear Jesus deal with his little heart if he would would be able to be old enough to accept you may he become a servant of God father we dedicate his life to you today in the name of Jesus Christ [Applause] amen I'm not sure what it is about my face but every everywhere that Carol and I go that happened to me several times this week kids just stare at me I told her the day I said am I that ugly she said well I think it's the presence of God they sense I hope that's what it is may we stand together oh I'm so happy to be in church today isn't it a privilege for us to be gathered together once again in the house of God and to know where we're living in the hour that's upon us and Jesus and his Mercy has given us light let's read today in 1 John 2:5 but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby we know that we are in him now what you notice it's not enough to be able to know his word or to be able to even quote the word but John says it's who so keepeth his word so we don't want to just know it and it's much easier to get the truth than it is the spirit of Truth somebody might give you a Bible give you a book a message book or a tape and you say well I've got the truth this is the truth but the harder part will be getting the Spirit of Truth within your soul just as someone gave you that truth someone else might come and take it away but if you never get the spirit of Truth in you that's yours forever 1 John 4:12 no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US verse verse 16 and we have known and believed the love that God ha to us God is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and notice don't just have love but you actually dwell love agapo is your dwelling place it's where you live it's where you stay so you don't move in and out you love you hate you love you hate you fuss you squabble you argue you fight no but you actually dwell in love and the word dwelleth means abide remain continue to remain not to depart to continue to be present not to become another or different he that dwelleth in God notes rather dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him May the Lord bless his word you may be seated we certainly believe in signs and manifestations all kinds of miraculous things that we've seen our Lord do several people healed right here Wednesday night several people were caught up into the presence of God and couldn't even speak speak their English language no more I mean they were weren't interrupting in the service or anything like that but just in praising and praying and worshiping and we believe in that but yet we also know all of those things can be impersonated and we know that a person could actually speak in tongues and maybe be at order the wrong time or at the wrong U opportunity and they feel it pulsating them so much and they just do it and totally miss the will of God tongues will cease prophecies will fail one day there'll be no need of healing no need of Miracles is that right but yet love eternal love will always exist in heaven there'll be no more preaching there'll be no more prayer lines there'll be no more ministering to the sick but we will dwell in love this is part of our rights as the Bill of Rights that we've been looking at for a while for the elect of God to be able not only to love but to have Divine love now realize it can be something that many people think to have and yet whenever they're really tried it proves that they don't you see this type of Love is unnatural to every one of us there's not a person here today or one that's ever lived on the face of the Earth outside of the Lord Jesus that could love with Divine love and it come as a natural trait it's not natural to us all of our loves are filled with an element of selfishness even after we become Christians children of God there's still an element about the Avenue that we love that is still selfish so we can go to church and we can love to go to church but we can still get selfishness in that we can love to pray and love to sing and even doing things for the Lord can have an element of selfishness in it and it takes Divine love to help us to be able to die to that now watch the prophet says it this way whether in tongues it shall cease whether it's prophecy it shall vanish whether it's knowledge it shall vanish of all these things or even Gifts of Miracles of healing they shall all be done away with only that Divine love shall last now when will they be done away with well whenever we don't need them no more but as of right now we still need them we still need healing we still need Miracles we still need these things standing in the Gap he says now in the Divine love divine love how can that be divine love if it isn't the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is divine love so this is the only Avenue that you and I can have access into this great thing of divine love when a person first becomes a Christian are they baptized into Divine love NOP they're not they get a portion of the spirit of God but this type of Love is only a mained once you've grown and grown into the complete stages of God and it's allowed to grow in you Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says now you got tapes on that you got tapes on what we believe and you got tapes on the discipline the church how we behave oursel and the Church of God how we ought to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out Young under can anybody say Amen to that to get in here to fellowship with your brothers you see we don't just come to church just to be able to fellowship with God we do and there's nothing like his presence but we come also to be with one another so they can minister to us and so we can in turn Minister back to them because there's something about the body that the body is so designed to be able to help one another now say for instance this way if you get an itch on this side of your arm right here now wouldn't it be absolutely awful if you limited yourself though to scratching only with your right hand now that would be real good as long as your right hand could reach everything else but if you limit yourself to scratching only oh I only scratch with the right hand it's going to be awful I'm telling you when you get a a a niche on that elbow there and you're bending and you're bending and you're twisting and you see you're laughing it it's it's dumb isn't it well it's the same way in the spiritual body of the Lord Jesus people get that way well I I I only listen to this preacher and I I don't go to church and I'm just you're going to be hurting on that elbow goes to you know and youve limited it only to that one aspect right there but God has placed so many different things in the body and what's it for it's not to minister to those who have the gifts but it's to minister to those who need ministering to so myself I want to receive everything that God has don't you every aspect of the body you know whenever people look at that and out in the world they can say they believe every word he said and they don't even go to church well they've not moved very far really have they he says so you can't wait for them doors to open to get in here to fellowship with your brothers and if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time you got to praying and the Church said because we're in the last days well the Bible exhorted us to much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with Christian love and with Divine Love Now notice them two different degrees of love you see that's the thing that many people don't understand about love that love is not just one open Channel but there's many degrees many different types and we know that it came from the Eternal in the beginning and as it started coming on down it was like it got narrower and narrower as it came on down and it finally comes into the very bottom of human love lust and Corruption and all that sort of thing and the only way to ever get back up to the top is for the one at the top to pull us into himself now we receive thank God Christian love for one another when we first start but it takes God himself to give us that Divine love now watch this he says with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know that you are my disciples I read to you a couple of weeks ago where the different historians in the time of the first century 2 Century third Century on up to the 4th century and it was one of the most notable things that the historians wrote now there were not Christian historians there were just Roman historians or historians from different uh cities around the time frame of the Roman Empire and they would write about the Christians now they saw Miracles and they knew they did signs and wonders and things like that but one thing I found that was a Common Thread among these historians was that they wrote about the way they lived and they wrote about the way they died so they wrote about these Christians and how much love they had for one another now they knew that they rais the dead and healed the sick but that wasn't the thing that really stuck out to them so much it was that they loved one another you remember I quoted to you that one of the historians said that their Master convinced es them that they are brothers their Master convinces them that they are brothers well if we've got the same Master he still does the same thing to us so we love one another but the thing is being able to love one another without selfish Love Now many people love you know a boy will meet a girl and he fall they fall in love and she falls in love with him and they don't realize they don't even realize that there's so much selfishness that's involved in that first step of Love well I I I want to get married because it'll benefit me this way and it'll benefit me that way sis you better watch out brother you better watch out because all of our human love is so coaled together with selfishness we just can't help it it's the way we're made and the way we fell into after the fall and there's only one thing that can help us and ever turn us around that's why a man can never be able to love his wife the way that he should without the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he will love her yes he would be willing to do all kinds of things for her but he will still have that element of selfishness that'll be there people come to the Lord Jesus and many of them come to him because they do not want to be lost they do not want to go to hell they do not want to perish so they come to the Lord Jesus with an element of selfish love it's all about what they can get all about what he can do for them and and if he asks them one little thing quit this don't do that quit what my goodness you mean I've got to do something you mean I I I've got to give up this and I oh I I am so appalled I cannot believe I thought everything about this was a free gift salvation is but whenever you fall in love with him and if you really love him he wants to see how much you love him do you love him just beyond a ticket Escape Out of Hell or do you love him more than anything else in this world do you want to give him everything that you are do you absolutely want to die to yourself and that's one thing of course that separates the bride from the church because the church still is so engulfed in that selfishness of love but the real people of God of course they move on into that reality notice in 1 Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 8 as Paul again describes about this Agape 11 he says charity never failes but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away when I was a as a child rather I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am also and known now Abid us notice these faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity but it it amazing how that we would look at a person that would have great miraculous faith and they would be able to lay hands on the sick and say they've not only got the gift of faith but they also have the gift of healings or the gift of Miracles and we would look with them and that would be the one that we would make our hero and there might be another one that might not have either of those gifts but they would have such love in their hearts and they are able to love their enemies and pray for their enemies and everything Jesus asked of them individuals they give it to them which one would we think would be the greater person most of us would pick the one with great faith you know why because there's something about that that gets our attention hey I believe in miracles I've seen them since I was a little boy I believe them with all of my heart but not only do I want Miracles I want this kind of love because there'll be many sign workers that'll be able to stand before God as a matter of fact I saw a little documentary La last night and it was from some of the African countries and it was people that was coming to uh me that were practicing supposedly Divine Healing and I saw them as they would come to these men and they' lay hands on them and that that that jerk and shout and many different things was actually happening in these Services as they called them and yet they found out that by a little bit of hidden microphone and a little hidden camera that many of these guys are nothing but charlatans many of them whenever they get they'd pray for these people and whenever they'd get healed especially the women they would call them into their private residence and they'd want a little private payment for what they had just done so you see signs and wonders and miracles alone is not what we look for these signs shall follow them that believe so the order is signs follow us we don't follow them but if a person has real charity real love of God you never have to worry about a man of God doing that because he's doing it based upon charity not based upon Faith you see whenever our foundation is this as a prophet has said I've already quoted to you but as a prophet is so beautifully laid it out for us that perfect love will produce perfect gifts so what will selfish love produce it will produce a mixture of gifts but still with the element of selfishness and then you find them men many of them it's all about them they have more Miracles more signs more w wonders and anytime you hear it you know that that individual may have great face but their love does not match their faith so this is where Kingdom Builders come in now we've had them of course since the dawn of time Kingdom Builders will use the gifts that God gives them to minister to the body but because they have such a degree of selfishness there left in the humanity it's always about them and what I prayed for this one and I prayed for that one and I done this and i' done that and I done something else oh how God hates that sort of thing notice now he says abideth now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity chapter 14 verse1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy now let me ask you just a simple question today if we would have been in the first century and some of us here today would have been kin to the man called Steven and say Steven would have been our father our brother our uncle our grandson our great nephew whatever Steven would have been and Steph was a man of God filled with the Holy Ghost a deacon and and a preacher too some and he was a man that really loved the lord and there was a man that we know formerly by his first name of his own nature a Saul and we know that the people laid their garments at the feet of Saul and it was actually through Saul's Administration that they killed this man stoned him and he become the first martyr in the New Testament then later we hear that Saul has become saved he's become supposedly filled with the Holy Ghost and now he's a preacher of the message and Paul is coming to your home church for a meeting oh but your uncle was Stephen your brother was Steph your cousin was Stephen would you went to church that weekend come on now how deep does our love really really work I personally believe with all of my heart one of the things that we're missing in the message Community is such a baptism of the love of God I ain't talking about to make us compromise I'm talking about that we can love our enemies and pray for them and feel no desire of Revenge in our hearts for them it's amazing how many Christians hold grudges in their hearts and they will get you back if it's the last thing they do they will say things they will they will make their point and then we think we are ready for the Rapture to me friends it's no wonder we're any farther along than what we are amen well come on now it's not a lack of knowledge for many of us it's a lack of obedience to what we know we should do as a Pastor I hear it so much oh I know I know I know I know I know what good does it do you to know if you ain't going to do it I know what I need to do I know where I need to be I know I need to do better I know I need to do this what good does it do if all we do is know it and we don't let it live itself out of our Lives now think about it so let's just let's just move our church now back to the first century Word of Life Church is there and we hear that this man Paul so-called has become converted got the Holy Ghost we still got our doubts of course and then we find out no no wait a minute now you've got to kid me Brother Don you you've invited this man to come to our church to preach and this man was actually the one who was responsible for getting my uncle stepen killed they laid their garments at his feet or could you have went there and really prayed true and you could have said God help me Lord you say I'm on a struggle Lord I I I I don't understand but God I I I want to feel toward that man with the genuine love I ain't going to ask you to raise your hand but I want you to just think about it today you see the way we react today in this Century would pretty much give us an idea of what we would have done in that Century because if people hurt us today and hurt us deeply how many of us can be able to love them anyhow and pray for them over all the top of the hurt or when their name is mentioned is the predominant thing that we think about not their soul and God deliver them and God have mercy on them I hope they can be saved I hope they can be reconciled to God is that what we think about first and foremost or do we think about I'll never forgive them I'll tell you one thing they done this and that and the other to me I hope and pray they go to hell if you you feel that way about anybody today you need to hit this altar before this service is over remember the Lord Jesus could look at those that crucified him and said father forgive them they don't even know what they have done and what they are doing now whenever we get into the to the the Salvation stages of accepting the Lord and then the Lord sanctifies us and the Lord gives us the baptism immerses our soul into the spirit of God and our soul is sealed and we know that it starts out in this tiny form of the true baptism of the Holy Ghost which is Zoe the personal life of God and it starts growing like that little white button on your shirt brothers and it starts getting greater and greater and multiplies and we think oh my I've arrived at this place and I'm really to that position but John being the Apostle of love and he wrote about love in a way that none of the rest of the men did and I read it to you a week or so ago where brother Rand said that Peter was the chosen an apostle for miracles now I'm sure you've noticed it by reading the Bible that we don't have near as many records of John doing the miraculous as Peter did but we don't have Peter much written about him expressing the love of God that John did so you mean to tell me that everybody is not going to be exactly the same way so Peter was not called the Apostle of love but John was so John had an Insight in to the presence of God and about agape love that Peter probably looked at and thought my my I I wish I could be more like John I wish it could be more like that maybe John turned around and said I wish I could be more like Peter you know I I was along with Peter when many miracles happen but I I've seen the sick healed and I've seen things happen out of my Ministry but God never give it to me and that measure isn't it amazing though how that we might compare them and look at them and say oh that guy right there man I'm telling you you talking about a man right there he's a he's a real faith-building man that Peter boy I'll tell you he just SS out there he's as bold as he can be and John would have to kind of hang his head no doubt but yet there was something about John that was able to tap into the very Heart Of God which will be Eternal I wonder if the Lord hasn't and is doing the same thing in our own ranks that there are certain people that will never attain to the same element and level of the miraculous in their Ministry yet they love the Lord they appreciate everything that God is doing in the Supernatural but it's just not been given to them but yet they are actually used in the body of God to be one that God will allow to be run down they will be hated they will be criticized and it seems so unusual why is it that that that one person or that one person or that man or that why is it that it seems like they are so hated above so many others wonder if God wrote it out in their life that they would be able to express the attribute of forgiveness and humility and Reconciliation and people that run them down and talk about them and then you find out years later oh the they're best of friends again and you're probably thinking it was the other person that made it right when in reality it probably wasn't at all it was that one that was actually called to live out the example of Jesus in forgiveness but which would be our choice the example of Jesus in forgiveness the example of Jesus in humility the example of Jesus in mature perfect love or the example of Jesus and walking on water the example of Jesus of standing up in a prayer line Satan in the name of Jesus come out of that person and we watch him shout and scream and run across the P Hallelujah Hallelujah we say wow what a Ministry and yet maybe that man has a hard time forgiving someone come on I wonder if we haven't made the wrong Heroes our example sometimes friends now think of it what John says here in verse 17 here in is our love made perfect made so it's not like it's given to you in perfect form when you initially received it but herein is our love made so this is the same maker that in the beginning created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was made so he's still creating you're looking for creation you're looking for miracles look around this building you'll see hundreds of them look in your mirror and you get in your car you'll see another one so what's he doing he's still making so it's not like that whenever we receive the Holy Ghost we receive it in its perfect mature complete format but we receive it and it's a baby yet as we would say and whenever it goes to growing and maturing and notice the word that John uses he said herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment so what in the world would that do you see a person who's received this from the Lord God they have no fear of standing before him at that day which is absolutely contrary to human makeup and in human nature who which one here Among Us would not be fearful of your life standing before God just humanly how many's made mistakes I'm telling that since you've been in church this morning how many's fell short of the glory of God every day of your life how many of us need Mercy every day of our life Grace every day of our life and yet you by the grace of God once you receive this love and it's maturity in your heart then you realize you can walk before the Lord God with boldness on that day but brother Donnie in spite of our Humanity in spite of our mistakes yes because the love has actually reached to stage of perfect now remember the word perfect elos is not sinlessness but it's maturity now notice John goes on to say that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world how in the world can that even be as he is so are we in this present world so we have the same traits that the Savior has right now the same character the same molding the same material so we don't need to be alarmed at the prospect that we will walk up before the great judgment seat of Christ now remember the bride never faces the white Throne judgment but we do walk before this seed of Christ whenever we will receive rewards for what we have done but yet knowing that in our hearts how could we ever do that and yet we will walk up with boldness not with fear we will not be terrorized because perfect love has cast out that fear now the word fear that John uses there is the word where we get phobias from oh my goodness there's hundreds of them in this day aren't we there's all types of phobias and fear so the word that he chose to use was the word from phobia but also means a terror now he's not saying that we lose our fear for God there's all types of fears that are built in our Humanity that's actually good for us so we hear a certain sound we react you know somebody stops in front every 3/4s of a second your brain responds your foot goes on the on the brake pedal that's a fear that you always need especially with the drivers in this day so there's things about that that we will always need and perfect love will not take that out you understand but the fear that God wants to rid us of is the servile fear which a servant has that a servant has so the servant would be constantly terrified of his master that he would displease him especially after the servant got married and then they would have children well they would always hold that over their head that if the servant did something that displeased his master that his master had the right to sell his wife and sell his children so he would serve this man Master under this Dome of fear that every day every hour oh I'm so nervous I'm so tore up what if I would do something and and I would displease my master and he would sell my wife or he would sell my children I could never live under that it's terrible how many Christians live under that surviv fear of the Lord Jesus instead of under a love relationship of what he wants it to be now want you notice here the prophet he says you might go to all kinds of emotions and carry on every way and calling the name of religion the heathens do the same thing but give me a consecrated life that's dead and rose again in Christ Jesus who lives in the shika Glory with the love of God around them that's the person I would believe that's going to be there God that's the kind of person I want to be put me beneath the veil under the blood of the Lord Jesus take all your gifts that you have in the scripture and the devil can impersonate every one of them but he can't impersonate love he can't impersonate now you and I both know we've had friends we've even had family members and we've had people in the family of God oh brother I love you so much sister I love you so much and while they was telling you that they were sharpening their knife to stab in your back well come on don't sit there and look at me like you ain't never had it happen to you people can say that they can love you but in reality we don't we don't prove our love just by our words but we prove our love also by our Deeds so herein is the love of God made manifest so the the devil can impersonate every gift that God's got but he can't impersonate love because love is genuine the devil can't love think of this the devil can't love it's not in him Angels you imagine every person out here today that is living for the devil they are serving a master that does care nothing for them he does not love them he cannot give them a heaven he has no Heaven he cannot give them peace he has no peace he cannot give them love he has no love can you imagine what the kingdom of hell is actually like I've often wondered myself if we were privileged to be able to go down into that region where they are and hear them as they argue and debate and fuss and Carry On The Prophet tells us in Victor day the reason that that we have wars is because the spiritual uh aspect of it going on that the spirits of Nations get jealous of one another so say the spirit in Yemen will get jealous of the spirit of Israel and the spirit of in Iran will get jealous of the spirit in Israel seem like there's a lot of them demons jealous of Israel today ain't they so them demons over them Nations and where they all come from well they come originally they were angels of God but his kingdom was built upon deception and deceit and Division so that's the foundation of his kingdom what's his kingdom going to be division turmoil how it must be down in hell that Satan constantly has to set him down and shut them up how he has to constant quit fighting you Devils quit fighting right now I'm sick and tired of it well you shouldn't have never started this kind of kingdom in the first place if you didn't want it but they cannot truly love neither can Satan truly love let me go a little farther neither can you that's right neither can I it's beyond our human capability to love in this way it's beyond us there's no way to attain to it without a new birth the devil can't love that's one thing he can't do when you get to a place that you love one another and all the world is dead that's what we want brother sisters now notice again 1 John 4:18 notice how John says there is no fear look at the word there the Greek word phobus which is where we give phobia from Terror dread are that which strikes Terror there is no fear in love but perfect love cast us out my goodness he's making this sound like it's a devil leaving but perfect love casteth out fear so the man who knows or the woman that he loves God and he's heart can never dread him as a judge cuz you won't meet him as a judge you'll meet him as a husband a husband that gave his life for you there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear has torment how many can say Amen to that you ever get afraid of this or that or the other whatever it is and what does it produce it produces a torment he that fearth is not made perfect in Love Now you see whenever we become then a partaker of his divine nature according to what Peter said it carries a sense of the release of the Judgment of God and we know beyond a shadow of doubt that we have passed from Death un life we don't have that fear of ever having to stand before him as a judge and that fear of us being lost because that brings torment love implies affection but fear implies repulsion so love what does it imply affection and attraction you understand that God is attracted to you God is attracted to you you know what gets his attention the prophet said keeping God's word is what gets his attention so real Divine love produces what an attraction those of you that met your husband your wife what was it about that one that stuck out to you more than than another and there was an attraction about them might have been their smile might have been an element of their looks their personality combination no doubt of many many things and there was an attraction that it be to form an attachment from there it grew into a love but then what does repulsion what does that do so this certain per person would repulse you or repulse me and and that that within itself produces a rejection and that's the way many people serve God like they're going to be repulsed and God's out to get them and if you make a mistake and fall short of the glory of God he's just waiting boy he's just waiting to smack you many of them have been raised up like a father like that or they were abused and they relate in their their you know their subconscious and their psychology part they relate to God being the same way is their abusive husband or their abusive father or whatever it was in their life but God ain't like that and the church said I said God ain't like that you see God wants to be attracted to us and God wants us to be attracted to him then we would love him so much that no matter what Satan would ever offer Us in the world would say are you kidding me you think I'd ever want to leave this lovely Lord Jesus and walk out there with you you ain't got no No Heaven you ain't got no love you ain't got none of these good things that God's that's what God wants us to do to where we as the bride of Christ when Satan offers us this and that and the other of the world we look at him and said there ain't no way God don't want it to be to where the preachers have to stand in the pull pit with a big bull whip about 14t long to reach from on the back pew and and just beat the time out of you every time you come the church God wants the preachers to be able to be so Anointed with his heart and with his love that their preaching will make us fall in love with the Lord Jesus more than we've ever been in our life and we will not serve the Lord God because of chains and a big ball hung onto our leg but we'll say praise God I'm free I'm free to love I'm free to worship I'm free to be what God wants me to be I'm not held here by bondage I don't know about you today I don't come to this church because I'm scared to death I don't come to this church I don't believe this message because I'm scared I'll go to hell I love this word I love to come to this church I love to worship God I love to live for him every day I do not fear him with a phobia I have no Terror of God in my heart oh I do have that element of fear afraid that I might displease him somehow but that's not a phobia you see it's something perfect love that's not natural to any of us it can't be because of the fall and sometimes we might imagine that we've actually reached a pretty good spot in our walk with God and the Lord will allow something to come up in our life or maybe I should say someone it's amazing ain't it the people can be some of the greatest in encouragement that we get they can also be some of the greatest battles that we carry some of the most difficult things in our life can be people any y'all ever had a breakdown because of a dog cat Ox fish horse cow where's most of your problems come from humans right some of them's your family some of them's your church family I know some of y'all think it's your pastor but really it ain't me friend I'm for you I mean I am guilty of burning your hide every now and then but that's just comes with a with a position now you see the way John looks at this he said there's no fear in love so love and fear can only co-exist when love is not perfect there is no fear in this degree of love that God wants us to have but fear and love can go can coexist when love is not reached maturity so a person loves God but they still have this phobia about him they love him and they love they love church and they love the pastor sort of but they're scared to death of him go up there and speak to Brother Don you kidding me Lord have mercy you got two contrasts that are coing existing in your heart so love and fear can only coexist when the degree of love has never reached the state of perfection maturity because once it reaches that it's like the maturity of This Love Actually cast out that element of fear so perfect love absolutely will not exist in the same soul with with fear but immature love young love love that is never fully grown up it will shift our emotions in one way and then fear will take a hold and we go the other way anybody here know what I'm talking about this morning anybody ever felt fear and love sure notice he said there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth th fear because fear hath torment he that fears is not made perfect in love so love that is complete when it reaches its proper extent of maturity it will eliminate death this is why Christians can face death and not be afraid can't you understand this is man's greatest fear is death whatever we get the flu whenever people got Co whenever this that and other happens it's not just the thing of Co itself it's what Co can lead to what death so what is it many of the diseases and things that people get ultimately should we think well I've got this disease or that disease but what are we terrified of that that disease would lead us to death and whenever we look and think about it that for a real child of God facing man's greatest fear how can they ever look at it in the face and actually laugh at it because their love has matured praise God brother Ron Spencer told me the other day whenever I saw him a week or so ago it's been brother Charlie many of you that knew brother Charlie and some of you didn't but brother Charlie Spencer I'll tell you he was quite a guy and brother Ron said every time he would call him he said I was preaching in the background and he said Daddy would you please turn Donnie down I can't even hear you Daddy brother Ron talked to brother Charlie about an hour before he passed whenever he passed an hour thereafter he was listening to One of of our services at the church and I it just struck me I thought my goodness you you're talking about something that you're you're laying there listen to a service and one moment you're amen and shouting and praising God hearing an anointed servant of God preaching whoever that servant would be and then the next moment you've jumped into a theophany and you've passed death and you just continue on Hallelujah you just continue on that word that you were hearing just a few minutes ago and you were able to move into that Dimension that's the way I want to face death if I ever have to face it I want to be able to be praying be able to read my Bible sitting there with my computer my L maybe in the CLS is speaking in tongues I don't know what I'll be doing but I'll simply change from this life and one moment I'll move into another body into another dimension by the spirit of God and say yes you don't make me tremble because you are not my master I am yours Hallelujah all you can do is take me to the other [Applause] side oh my thank you Lord fear has torment it's a painful distressing emotion every now and then I get this call n from this number 926 33 1 1 my heart will rise I can feel my blood pressure I break out my sweat it's the dentist oh y'all got that same phone call oh my goodness perfect love will never take away the fear from a root canal you understand what I'm saying what is it about it that our bodies will react whenever we hear certain diagnosis that the doctors will say and a physical change will come over us in a moment oh Lord God help us father you see a True Believer in the Lord Jesus does not have to fear the past the present nor the future CU he took care of my past and he's with me here today so there for it makes me where I don't have to fear my future but there will always be these things around us now watch Paul in Romans 8:15 said for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again that's talking to Christians so you've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear the spirit of bondage again to fear so the word bondage is slavery the condition of a slave so why would we want to be free from the slavery of sin and then come under a so-called slavery under the name of Christianity to which we simply trade the type of fear that we have so it's the fear from the devil and we switch it to the fear of a God who has been painted To Us by preachers themselves that don't really love him right you see you watch a lot of preachers and they're constantly preaching under condemnation constantly preaching under hell I'll tell you what I found out through the years A lot of them guys they're preaching because that's where they live themselves they fear God they dread God they dread meeting God but let me just tell you in case you're wondering you're looking at a man today that does not fear meeting God I believe there's more people in this building that have the exact same thing I'm talking about I look forward to meeting my Lord Jesus I'm not expecting to be thrown into hell I'm not expecting to be beat or whipped I do not believe that because I am his son I am a part of his econom me oh brother Donnie does that make you live loose are you kidding me I want to live closer to him that I've ever lived in my entire life but I'm going to do it not because I'm afraid not because I'm scared I'm going to hell but I OE my whole heart I owe him my emotions I owe him everything about me he has been so good to me why I wouldn't I want to give him everything for ye have not received the spirit so you see there's a spirit that comes with bondage you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption wow how different the spirit of adoption is the feeling of affection Love In other words I'll say it in a way so you can relate to it if God had a refrigerator your picture would be all over it y'all relate to that right he don't look at you and think how bad you are and how awful oh my brother Donnie all my mistake sh knows all of your mistakes but remember that's one of the reasons that he died remember the personal interview of sister Georgia Bruce but brother ROM I have so many things about me that I know that's right sister Georgie that's why Jesus died so your mistakes would not even be alloted to you come on somebody don't sit there and look at me blessed is the man that walketh not in the coun of the ungodly nor sth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful that his Delight is in the law of the Lord in his law does he meditate both day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the river of the water his fruit shall not weather Hallelujah whatsoever he doth shall prosper but the ungodly are not so they are like the chaff which the Wind Drive us away you are blessed to love God you are blessed to have a desire to serve it you are blessed that you're not standing here today with a phobia in your heart against Jesus you see the spirit of adoption is the spirit of being accepted not the way you and I think of adoption that somebody goes down to an adoption center and they adopt somebody else's child but this is the placing of sons God didn't adopt you from the Devil the devil just had your body and God had your soul so it took you package deal away from the devil and filled you with a spirit of acceptance amen adoption whereby we cry father father or Abba Father notice he says in Ephesians 4:26 be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your WRA neither give place to the devil Place room any portion or space marked off as it were from surrounding space an inhabited place so whenever you start to work tomorrow don't make give place in the passenger seat of your car for the devil well brother Donnie wasn't preaching about you you low down sorry dirt bag you you ain't good for nothing Jesus said devil out of here you ain't riding with me to work you ain't riding in my passenger seat you ain't riding in the back seat as a matter of fact you ain't even riding in the truck get out I'm not making no place that's what we need to do in our homes make no place for the devil in our home that's what we need to do in our church make no place for the devil we're not giving the devil a special seat upon the platform there ain't no seats in the mezzanine that we're reserving for for demons as a matter of fact if there's any still left in here get out of here get out of here you Devils of Darkness you Devils of sickness were not given any place in our life for Satan and his [Applause] kingdom Hallelujah let me change now another right that we have as the people of God is a right to the mind of Christ a right to the mind of Christ what this in 1 Corinthians 2:16 for who has known the mind of the Lord now he asked a question for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ so he ask the question you know if you've ever had many interviews with preachers you know that a lot of times preachers will answer your question with eight more questions well I'll ask you this and I'll ask you that so Paul here he asks the question and then he answers it in a very peculiar way for who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ and the meaning of the word is understanding judging the capacity for Spiritual truths The Faculty of perceiving divine things of recognizing goodness and of hating evil I find this to be amazing because there are so many church people that do not have this mind cuz they cannot differentiate between something that is right and something that is wrong so one preacher will say you know this this this this this and this is right and then another one will say the exact opposite and then people sat there and think well which one we supposed to believe well I don't know what to believe well I was totally convinced that this and then I heard this man say something different now I'm just so confused I don't know what to believe and their whole life for many of them that's the way they are flip flop flip flop back forth back and forth and yet they carry Bibles they've got books they got the message on their phone and they still don't know what to don't you understand what's missing it's the newos of Christ the Mind The Faculty which can only come by a new birth to be able to look at something that looks identical can look like an identical twin but the mind of Christ can differentiate between the two and a person trying to use their Sensations or their emotions or whatever or well I I just patronized this brother he's always been one of my favorites and I really like this guy but someone with the mind of Christ has the faculty which is beyond thems to discern between right and wrong and yet you look at it and it might look identical it may feel right it may seem right it may look right but the mind of Christ in you says watch that they're leaving out this word then they'll leave out this one then they'll leave out that one praise the Lord but we have the mind if you want to notice this that Paul it says we have so already in the first church age now remember this was the alpha bride so God had started doing what he desired to do in the Old Testament but the law would not allow it and that was the spirit of God to come inside not only the prophets but the mystical body of the Believers so they had received and element of them had received the mind of Christ so it's the power of considering and judging soberly calmly and impartially so in other words they won't judge a situation if it's you know the pastor's pet then the pastor's pet gets special conditions and you know and then everybody else you know this no the mind of Christ never does that and everybody said amen a particular mode of thinking and judging thoughts feelings purposes and desires so he has endowed those of us that have received the token life inside of our soul he has endowed us with his own personal ability listen now his own personal ability to be able to discern praise be to God so we're capable of separating truth from error thank you Jesus notice again in Philippians 2:5 the aspects of the mind let this mind same English word but a different Greek word altogether let this mind be in you for oal which was also in Christ Jesus now look at the meaning of the word here to have an opinion of oneself God knows we all have that and most of us wrong now let this mind be in you to have an opinion of oneself to think of oneself to be modest not let one's opinion though just of himself exceed the bounds of modesty now this was the mind that was in Christ Jesus now I want you to notice how Paul says this let or allow you see this is something that will not automatically just blow out of you but we must allow God through this mind of Christ that no matter what God ever does through us how great the work God may be that he uses us for but we not the people around us but us keep it in the bounds of modesty that's right and somebody said yeah who being in the Amor of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now who was he the word the Amor of God and he thought it not robbery to be equal with God though he was God in a human body but he did not consider it robbery which is to take something away from God he looked at it as an exact transfer of riches it was not robbery for him to say when you have seen me you have seen the father that's right that was not robbery now for a person to say I'm a Child of God I'm this and that and the other and they're not living a life that's worthy of a child of God they just robbed the Christian title but Jesus didn't not look at it as robbery to say I am the way I am the truth I am the life and no man can come to the father but by me Lord Phillip said Lord show us the Father and Jesus saith unto them Phillip hast thou been with me so long a time and don't know who I am it was not robbery but yet he was God but in supreme authority of his position he never acted like he was right why he lived beneath his position how did he do that Harry it was a mindset for the service that was required he must condem send you see for him to do this when his bride comes Hallelujah for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again them which sleep in Jesus will God also bring with him when he comes when Jesus comes in the Rapture it will not be an act of condensation him humbling himself again you're talking about glory and robes and diadems and crowns why now will be the time but when he's on Earth he needed this mindset praise God who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made him of no reputation and took upon him the form of a Ser don't you see what this mind is let this mind be in use so this mind is the ability to self empty kosis this is what God did he emptied himself then the Lord Jesus emptied himself and In The Garden of Gethsemane the anointing left him and he did not die with the anointing he died without it this is how he coulds say my God my God why H Thou forsaken me so the self emptying is the mind that every member of the Bride not just preachers we must have self emptying denying ourself let this mind be in you the mind of self-emptying instead of self- evaluation Bo I'll tell you one thing I guess I'm just about the greatest preacher on the message well I reckon I'm just about the greatest singer there ever was I've written more songs than anybody in the message as far as I know and if you don't believe I am just ask me I'll tell you I am I'll tell you that right now if you want to know who it is glory to God I'll tell you who it is with all humility oh my you skunk come on now that stinks that's not humility people Saints are humble because they say they are I am so humble I'm so humble how many of us in our church today have the mind of self emptying if we would be looking for people here in the church today that every other service your name would be mentioned either by me or somebody else or you would be recognized for this or recognized for that or this or that or the other wonder how many of us would say that's what I read out tell but if God needed somebody and they pulled down on the parking lot and they seen a little chewing gum rapper laying there said who done that I'm going to stop my car and pick that up people all the time coming out here on the road and throwing out their beer cans and their beer bottles and all that sort of thing anybody willing to stop out there pick any that stuff up brother Donnie how dare you you would ask me to pick up a Coke can I do amen you would pick c a french fry box I do I don't think it's becoming for our place to look like this that's right we are so blessed to have such a facility I don't want us to take advantage of it I don't want us to feel like we can run it down and treat it like I don't know what we ought to be so happy our birthday just last week been here for a year we ought to be so grateful to God we ought to every time we come into this place I come over here sometimes multiple times during the week sometimes it hits me when I pull in some time when I pull out and I'll stop and get out of my vehicle and look back and say Lord I just can't hardly believe it I just can't hardly believe it you've given us such a nice place to worship such a nice place for all of our activities and all that I am so grateful to God to have it today I am grateful no I don't deserve it no you don't deserve it no we do not deserve any of it but God's giv it to [Applause] us oh my y'all pray fast now I'll hurry maybe you see our Outlook determines our outcome our attitude will determ our altitude people's altitude toward Christ the word will determine they will not be able to attain a Rapture altitude notice in this sermon the angel of God I'll close here shortly it's the mind of Christ and the human being has the privilege to enter in and know the mind of Christ Hallelujah I want you to look at the day of the sermon 3448 now some of y'all may think I'm absolute nuts preaching this in 2024 can you imagine what they thought about him preaching this in 1948 when they're this is Pentecost of course Pentecost is wide open they're pushing gifts shouting running jumping you know all that sort of thing nothing wrong with that long as the presence of God is inoc is decent in order thank God for it but how weird and strange this must have seen when all these things are going on and he's preaching about the mind of Christ what a reality to dwell in the channel of Christ we unworthy Mortals have been brought in to be Sons and Daughters of God to be fellow citizens again he says you can't have the mind of Christ and the mind of the world the same time you can't be in your way and God's way at the same time you have to get out of your own way to let God have his way Lord help us Lord help us that's the only way you're ever going to do anything you got to get away from your own thoughts your own reasons don't try to reason just believe let's stand I'll read you this other one while you rest yourself and we have faith in our heart the faith of God in our heart and can see it clear and it becomes a Fai and then we speak it and it comes into existence because the mind of Christ is in the man that's what makes healings and so forth when you get that perfect Revelation just what you're doing then you know how to walk let me look at this again it becomes a faith then we speak it and it comes into existence the same thing because the mind of Christ is in the man maybe some of y'all are battleing things in your life and you come up for me to pray for you brother Daryl to pray for brother Joel brother Jonathan these are the minister Brothers here brother Michael the others visit the ministers that would come they said well I went up for prayer it didn't happen I asked God that didn't happen I wonder if God wants some of of us to be able to let this mind be in us and he will take your own mouth and you will say to that besetting sin leave me in the name of Jesus you know I'm here to help you you know I would pray for you till I fell flat on the floor with all my strengths gone and I'm here to do everything I can to help you but I want us and our church to come to a place to where we realize God don't want the emphasis just to be on the preacher the pastor it's a body move so I'll go back to this elbow that's itching now my head could scratch it but but it's going to be a might awkward and y'all going to laugh at me if I do it or I can take a part that's been appropriated to be more beneficial I've been told by a couple of Brothers but I was told about it the first time from Brother Perry green he was talking about brother brandom talking about the fivefold ministry and he named each one of these fingers you know what they were and he said that this was the prophet and he said notice brother Perry how the prophet can work with the pastor the Evangelist the teacher it it amazing you try to you know try to it's it's hard to do don't do it now but do them when you get home later look how hard it can be sometimes getting this little guy but notice how the prophet can work with all them other folks so smoothly so there ain't going to be one Pastor in the message that everybody's going to hover around there ain't going to be one evangelist come on somebody there's only one man really that all the bride is going to be under his headship and his position that's right and all the rest of them will work like this until they get bigheaded and think they don't need him no more I hope we never get that way in our church where God's message through his Prophet can always be so alive and our hearts come me bow our heads I want each of you today to look at your life as a man a woman a young man a young sister just asking Lord please help me today I I need more of that love that I heard preached about today I need it to mature in me and when we say more I'm not sure so much that it's more in quantity as it is just more mature we're thinking well more and more and more means something other than what you have but I'm wondering sometimes if it's not it's there it's just in the stage that it needs to grow up and the Lord can use use it praise the Lord heavenly father as we have our heads bowed to the dust of the Earth from whence we were taken and one day knowing that if you don't change us we'll go back to that dust we have this petition in our heart today Lord that we can be what we have heard I believe there's people here today and no doubt people that have streamed the service and many of them have grown and grown and their in a matured state in their walk and their life and their love and their faith and their Temperance and their Joy but Lord they just feel like they need just a little bit more growth they're almost at the top maybe there's some that's just starting at the very bottom and they feel they need so much and lack so much but this is one thing we so love about you you can take all of us at different levels and make each one of us feel welcome at your table there's people here that's been serving you for decades after decades but you don't love them any more than you do that one that just got saved a few weeks ago or a few nights ago Lord Jesus I pray you would help us to have your mind for our church what we think you want our church to become no doubt every person here would have their idea and their opinion well I I I believe God would want our church to be this or do that or do this certain thing or have this sort of Outreach this way and that way Lord I I just pray You' help all of us father that we can find your mind for our church not only our church but our marriage our homes our families what's your mind Lord father in the last few years several of our Saints in 2013 I think sister barbar sent the number to Carol that since I've been here I've buried 144 people I believe it was since I've been here 2013 13 in one year that's left behind widows widowers some daughters that are motherless some boys that might be motherless maybe they feel all alone and lost today they don't know what the rest of their life is to be they needs your mind Lord so what about our sisters losing their husbands to covid or to cancer or whatever it would be a real daughter of God that focuses so much of our life around her husband and then all of a sudden he's gone what do they do with the rest of their life they truly need your mind Lord to help them my four little granddaughters here today Lord how they loved and still do love their mama but you and your wisdom chose to take their mama home would you comfort their little hearts today Jesus would you help them Father not only them but others standing here and they're wondering what am I to do maybe some will finish high school here and five or six months whatever it will be and they're pondering what should I do which way should I go we need your mind Lord as the pastor of this church Lord as for now I I want your mind for us I want your mind for us in this community in this area of what we're to be what we're to do I know this I cannot believe it would ever be in your mind for us to pull away from the message of the hour it cannot be in your mind for us to compromise so we could pack this place out I'd rather there be three here and it packed out with the Holy Ghost than Plum full of people and no presence of God oh Jesus don't never leave us please father I don't believe you will as long as we never pull away from your word we need your mind for the future Lord among the message Community there's such divisions Among Us doctrines and this and that and the other that's dividing oh how the preachers need the mind that was in Christ Jesus how we need your mind to direct us as a message Community as a message body help me Jesus help me help our church we didn't choose to be a church that would influence people around the world I never chose to be such it's left up to me you know I would stop the internet today and never broadcast another service as long as I ever live cuz with that comes such responsibility we need your mind Lord Brother Rob brother Joe with the young people what do we want for our young people help us father every Minister here the deacons the trust es the Sunday School teachers help us father we want to just turn this into another denomination another shell of where God used to be no Lord we welcome you Lord Jesus we welcome your healing your deliverance your power father God help us help us I pray Lord give us your mind your mind of Direction your mind of judgment your mind perception The Faculty of a supernatural perception to pick up on right and wrong help us Lord God we worship you father We Worship You Lord you love him with all your heart today Saints and can say be the uplifting of your hand that you probably need that now more than ever before in your life mind of Christ to help you to lead you to guide you for your life some of you young men be looking for a wife before long some of you young sisters looking for a husband will you talking about needing the mind of Christ marrying a man that's not got the Holy Ghost marrying a man that's going to be the ruler of your home your brother's marrying a woman that may not have the Holy Ghost friends if we ever needed the supernatural intelligence of God we need it now how many wants it in your life your leadership job decisions you make business decisions some of you business men here don't trust your own ability don't look at yourself and say I'm such a good business man I'd never make a mistake you've already made one when you get to thinking you're so high and mighty oh Lord Jesus help us today father would you mind laying your hands on one another let me just tell you here Wednesday night we did this there's a brother come to church he standing here today told me I talked to him on the phone said he had this split and headache whenever had the Saints to lay their hands on one another couple people laid their hands on him I think actually brother Daryl went to him too when prayer was made the headache left him immediately these signs shall follow them not just the preachers let's pray for one another Heavenly Father our brothers and sisters have their hands one upon the other here today Lord I've seen one Widow sister reach over and take hold of the hand of another Widow sister they share something in common Lord their husbands been taken from them and no doubt they never thought it would ever happen looking for the remaining portion of their life what do they do they no longer fit with married couples really married couples will ask them to go out and they feel awkward and out of place would you help them Jesus young people standing here Lord maybe they're at that awkward stage in their life trying to find what you want them to be maybe there's ministers here today Lord that'll hear this and they're seeking your wisdom about a pivotable pivotal rather turning spot in their life and they don't know what to do people think preachers have all the answers or if they only knew the truth of it we struggled as much or more than they do trying to find direction sometime for our lives and if a preacher makes a mistake it's public so everybody can see it and criticize him Lord as preachers we need your leadership Lord I pray that every man of God that's called to preach this word may they realize what an awesome responsibility they have especially those of us who stream our services and stream our churches we have an international audience and sometimes our influence overlaps from one to another and there's people here I know that'll listen to this preacher and that preacher and another preacher and then if they hear conflicting things they don't know what to say they don't know what to believe help all of those ministers who stream and do all of that to understand the responsibility that they have in affecting other sheep Lord Jesus we all need your mind father how will it be that you'll ever get a group of people together on the Earth in one mind for the Rapture the Bible tells us that they were in one place and in one Accord there on the day of Pentecost and they' been discussing and debating and going through this and that and the other for several days now but finally they arrived and one Accord no doubt we'll always have differences father but for that which is needful for us as your people would you sweep the world Lord God and bring the preachers if the preachers can't grow up and become mature how can the Sheep if the preachers cannot grow up and be what you've called us to be instead of trying to carve out our little niche here and our little niche there help us Lord God to lead your people together in the unity of the facei and the knowledge of the Son of God great it Lord Lord Jesus help our church father these men that are standing here that are married and some of them with children help these men to realize what a responsibility they have they need your mind Lord these sisters need your mind these young people we need your mind oh Lord God help each of us here today I pray that we can find your mind Lord for our lives for the rest of our journey for what we're to be where we're to go help me Jesus I stand in Greater need than all of these people here today help me I stand in a fearful place oh Lord I'm not afraid that I'll be lost I'm not afraid that you'll cast me out but I just get so afraid that I'll miss you somehow I'll miss your direction you know how I am back there in the office I walk back and forth and I pace and I I get so tore to Pieces before I come out I'm afraid I'll say something that won't please you or I'll eliminate something that I should have said and one Soul didn't get what they come to church for help me I need you Jesus I Need You hallelujah hallelujah how many feels that way about your walk with God can we just raise our hands now you've prayed for one another can we just raise our hands now and let's just focus on us Lord help me just in your way Lord help me help me father that I can have your mind help me that I'll never think of myself higher than I'm supposed to be and always with that element of modesty if I would Heir Lord if there's an error toward modesty let me error that way let me error oh God let me take the order let me take the order of condensin it's the same man Paul here that we read about also told the saints that they would condescend to Brothers of lower degree condens sin to Brothers of lower degree help us give us that father that that mind in you when you were the almighty but you hid it so well people touched you rubbed your clothes and you hid it so well they didn't even know God walked into their little store maybe you walked in and bought a fig or you
