boy if we can keep that before us no matter what we're going through we'd walk a different walk and talk a different talk with me praise the Lord isn't it awesome to be back in the house of God tonight in the presence of the Lord oh I love going to church I love being where the saints of God are I love being where he is goes where he is good things are going to happen turn to listen to me tonight to the book of Zechariah if you would hurt brother Joel did an awesome job here Sunday certainly appreciate that brother Joel God bless you brother Zechariah Chapter 6 verse 11. we're going to talk about him tonight how great he is what a great thing he has in his mind what he wants to accomplish which we believe by his grace that we're part of then take silver and gold and make crowns and sit upon the head of Joshua a son of Joe sedek the high priest speak unto him saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch he shall go up out of his place he shall build the Temple of the Lord even he shall build the Temple of the Lord and He Shall bear the glory now unlike Moses unlike Solomon on like zerubbabel unlike these people restoring this Temple unlike Herod he will be the only one that can build the Temple of the Lord and have the Temple of the Lord's Glory living inside of him notice what he will do you'll bring forth twofold of what no other man was ever allowed to do in the Old Testament he shall bear the glory and he shall sit and Rule upon his throne so he's going to be a king but also he shall be a priest upon his throne so kingship and priesthood will be merged together in this man whose name is the branch and the council listen to this of Peace shall be between them both so nor the words between kingship and priesthood will be a council of Peace merging together not in two men which is typical for the Old Testament once they come to the time of Kings but not so here because this man will bear both and that he's going to build a new order it will be called the order of Melchizedek the worshipers will worship him not in ritual and in routine but they will worship Him in spirit and in truth is that the kind of worshipers we want to be tonight let's bow our heads together I wonder how many he'd like to be remembered before the Lord God bless you like you to remember Erica tomorrow if you would she's gone to Nashville today and uh her and Lance and set an MRI this evening be having her third treatment tomorrow I begin about 7 30 in the morning their time about 8 30 hour time if you'd be remembering her that all will go well the spirit of God will just take that stuff and go after them them Devils inside that body and kill them amen heavenly father it's so good to be in your house tonight Lord so good to see your children again we're so blessed father to be able to gather together how I thank you for Wednesday night's service I know there's people all over the world that would love to be able to come to church on Wednesday night but because of their particular setting some of the ones in Africa don't have their own buildings some of them in India don't have their own building some in the states don't even have their own buildings so they can have a midweek service but all how we love midweek service father it's just such a boost to us and helps us and we want you to know that we are grateful to finally be in our new place we thank you for that but Lord God most of all we want to thank you that you've gathered here with us what good would a fanciest Place nicest place that was ever built on the earth be if you wasn't there but we recognize your presence as you're among us we thank you for that we pray Lord that you'll be mindful of all the hands that was uplifted it signified a need a request a desire we believe that you're mindful of each one of them tonight Lord pray father that should just be with Erica tomorrow you see Lord she had a test yesterday and couldn't eat because of the test and couldn't eat today because of another test so it's left really really weak and just really shaky in her body Lord and we talked to her on the way actually when we pulled into the parking lot here at church and said you just got done with the MRI but she was real weak we as the saints of God agree together right now in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God go to her Lord and touch her body you see she has this thing tomorrow Lord and we're just believing you father we're already confessing by your stripes she's already healed because we looked everywhere and we didn't find nobody that was greater than Jesus Nero endocrine tumor has to bow at the feet of Jesus cancer heartache headaches whatever they are they've got to bow at the name of Jesus take your word tonight father and speak to us would you Lord in Jesus name we ask amen God bless you Saints you may be seated love you so much tonight all my heart is just soul moved for the presence of God seeing what he wants to accomplish in our day let's get just a little view of it the first man and first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear was Adam and Eve that is perfect Oneness God and His creation but speaking lit to ear God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were in so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God and his family was one any man in his family a correct good Noble obedient family is one with one another any family and if there's any something notice this now there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right now listen if there's something that comes in their family that moves them apart it's not right now watch how he ties the first and original family in the Garden of Eden and how that their original position and place was that God could come down any time he desired and talk to both Adam and Eve not just the man but both Adam and Eve everything was perfect there was no sickness no sorrow no death no suffering notice he goes on to say if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the families broken somewhere they should all be one father was Mother Mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that now listen what you'll see when you see that you'll see one lovely picture now this picture is the first one in the episode of God's Great Museum it was a great Divine gallery that after father created the universe and expanded his creation to the Earth now Satan of course had fallen before the Earth's Foundation was ever laid and actually uh preached it done it brother Jason's this weekend that whenever the Angels fell then when God started bringing this earth into existence Satan walked up and down this Earth when the Earth was belching out volcanic rocks and Ash and our bodies were being spewed out of the heart of the earth calcium potash petroleum Cosmic lights copper magnesium all these things that God needed for the material to make our bodies but for our bodies were ever formed Satan was walking up and down the Earth and left his Footprints in volcanic ash because Footprints means possession so Satan claimed this Earth he wanted it at his as his own but again we go back to what we were singing I looked all over and I looked for somebody that could create a blade of grass but have found nobody I went down to hell and I asked oh Satan can you make me just one fly what about one apple what about one peach what about one anything can you make anything I searched all over her but I couldn't find nobody you know why because there ain't but one Creator and that's almighty God Satan couldn't make a nurse the way our father could he could not make subjects so he had to pervert what God had created that's why it's after you and I tonight and Satan purposed in his being to have this place he didn't have a wife he didn't have a family but what he did had by this stage was Angelic beings who had crossed the line of mercy and remember when Angels Fall there is no Redemption the Lord Jesus never died for Angels but for human beings oh I'm so glad today so something come between this first family I hope you understand this really it's quite simple when Satan found what would work against the first human being that he tested he's never changed it that much he just keeps updating his tactics but using some of the same things and that is to pull people out of their god-given position if he can pull one person in a family out of their position it can throw the entire family out of the will of God that's what happened in the Garden of Eden but before he ever got to Eve he had to pull apart of God's creation other than man out of his position and that was of course we know the serpent by pulling him out then he was able to have a tool or an instrument that was a go-between the missing link that science still looks for and we know that that was the tool that Satan used then he come to the woman pulled her out of her place he could not make Adam leave his place so he come to the woman and out of Adam's love for her then Adam was willing to step out of his place for her so what do you see the whole story is beings getting out of their place and Satan loves to do that still to this very day now I want you to notice the prophet said when you see that father mother children father loves mother mother loves father children love parents parents love children and then they have this beautiful lovely picture and God placed it there and what a beautiful piece of art that it was now you know I know art differs according to the very uh you know the variety of people's taste and I've been to a lot of the beautiful museums around the world and I've walked into some of those museums and some of them you stand there and you look at that art and you think what is that any all ever been there some of the art that you see springing up around Johnson City you know some of these things that are made by artists and I think I think I made something like that when I was a five-year-old boy I should have kept it they don't tell what had been worse now so some of the stuff they called Art today I'm sure I'm sure that it's only me and I just don't have an eye for it probably but I like looking at a human when you can look at him and you know they're a human being instead of trying to figure out if they're a dog or a cat or a you really don't know by the way that some people draw it and to me when I look at that type of art so-called I like the Masters myself I like the rendition of the Master's art and whenever they would make it during the Renaissance time and thereafter and they would make those drawings of those animals and beings human beings and so on and they're so real that you almost just want to reach out and touch them there's something about them that is so compelling that pulls on you and then others you just stand there and look at it you just think wow I just I have to think about this is that a dog or a cat or is that a wall is that a two before is it a pile of garbage I mean you know it just leaves you away mesmerized and people just walk away and say man man wasn't that something I'm saying you it sure was brother I don't know what it was and if I ever figured out I might let you know but you just think my goodness and that's the way the church natural has become so you look at it and you see that it's death and got the touch of a master but it looks out to master of deception to me and it looks like some of this modern art or it doesn't even look like the original picture that God made how many believes God's original artist well according to what the prophet said then that was God's purpose and his purpose listen these words together just absolutely awesome his purpose as father Supreme father Supreme was to be one with his Earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them now God now notice it was not that they just obeyed the word do this yes Father do that yes Father do that yes father but actually God's nature was in them now I can't explain to you exactly how that was but I do know whatever it was that Adam and Eve had whatever experience they had with God in the Garden of Eden they were able to lose it and they were able to fall away from it so myself brother Daryl I desire something more than what Adam had so that I'll never fall away from it you understand what I'm saying now had God gave Adam and Eve the Seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I we have today that would be no way they would have ever fallen from what they had but they had something that was temporal something a special allotment of God according to the first dispensation of man under the stage of Innocence let me say it that way and God gave it to them knowing that they could and would fall from it but yet it was something that must have been awesome at the time but something that they could regress from an Adam of course choosing to do that and when he did he throwed us wherever he are today now notice in Father's purpose was was to be not only father but father Supreme now I wanted not not only to be a father but father Supreme in other words there'd never be another father that would ever be above him now he didn't just want to be plain old father but he wanted to be father Supreme so he wanted to be everything that his children would ever have need of and then he put this allocation of his own nature inside of them so when they come up to God to worship they somehow knew what God wanted I really think this is what's missing today in so many worshipers because a lot of the worshipers in the age were living they don't know what God wants so that you know they they're trying to worship and wave their hands a certain way or they hold their hands a certain way it's sad but many of the message folks are the same way they really don't understand what worship really is they don't understand what to give God what he wants one of the meanings of the word worship is a supreme and divine adoration for something so it's not even moving your hands all the meanings of worship have nothing to do with some movement of the body but it projects from the heart and when it comes from the heart it will put the body in motion now people can have the body in motion and still not have the heart and tune then you're really still in a mess but I want my heart to be in tune and they don't want to set my body in motion with it don't you but I want to make sure that it's in the right way so we tonight is the worshipers of God should have a desire do we to want to know what father wants what do we want to just give him what we think he wants do we want to just say well you know just give him whatever you think he wants I don't want to do that myself I want if I want to worship him I want to give him what he wants from me now notice he says this way isn't it a beautiful picture God and his family father over all Supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing but joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with God what a picture what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one what a union a Oneness that would it be to see God in his church now what she brings it Beyond Adam and Eve and brings it to us this is preached in 1962. what a union a one that said would be to see God in his church sell every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God now this is what father Supreme wants father Supreme does not want each of us to pick out his certain man and then all of us will basically just go along with every man every word that man says and we will be just just people for that man yes brother Donnie yes brother Donnie yes brother dark yes brother Tim yes whoever it is that you're going to follow and that's why you think Oneness is no you become a robot but Oneness is the people of God getting God's divine nature by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we will still have our own personality and I don't want to break any ideological balloons that you have but we will never on the earth get to a place to where everybody sees exactly the same thing about everything else never because we are human beings we're always going to have a different opinion about this a different view about that there will be some folks in the message and they will sit there and worship God they'll never run around the church there'll be others that will run there'll be others that will jump and Shout well now praise the Lord and yet if both of them are worshiping with all of us are heart whether or not you understand it and believe it God accept both of them in exactly the same way because they're responding according to what he led them to do now it may not please you and it may not please me so much but after all we're not here to please one another are we we're here to please God right so we will never get to a spot to where even all the preachers are all sit down and they'll discuss the godhead and they'll discuss predestination election for knowledge and they'll set down to every one of them will tea totally agree never that'll never happen as long as when this Mortal realm but there is a Oneness that every member of the Bride must have and will have before the Rapture takes place that Oneness in Christ will help us and give us tolerance for those who see things a little bit different than we do but you know what we tend to get into a denominational Forum to where people don't sit the way we do then they're off the word well first of all God didn't make you the judge or me the judge the word is the judge and remember many times those that have quotes to back up their idea it come from the same message and you get the quotes that back up your idea well which prophet was it that was true well the same man saying the same statements and just different settings now watch it is the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church is the Oneness of himself in the people now remember Zechariah prophesied about a man that would come and would build the Temple of the Lord and as I said before the Lord Jesus would not even have been able to enter into the holiest of holies because he was not a levite he was natural genetically his Natural Body he was of the tribe of Judah not of Levi so he could have never offered a sacrifice in the temple yet he offered his body in the presence of God they would have never let him go inside of there and read the Torah he would never have been able to offer a sacrifice in that amazing man would have never let the Lord Jesus offer to sacrifice but almighty God created that body and said offer it to me and Bible accept it and forgive every person that accepted from now until the end of time but yet as far as they looked at it he would have never been allowed to even step in behind the holiest of holies because he could not go in behind the veil and his body was the veil so you see when man gets it all so cut and dried and man's got it boy this is exactly the way it is and there's no room for growing and there's no more room you know instead of putting a comma we put a period at the end of it bless God this is what I believe and I ain't moving uh oh you're already cut and dry ain't you you better put a comet into that this is what I believe today but I'm subject to change tomorrow if I find another quote or another scripture oh you said how can you be that because I'm a growing man in the body of God that's why now notice God's idea of Oneness is himself in the people that's the only grounds of Fellowship the only way that you can have those grounds is by a union to be United with him forever now you see Adam did not have this in the union of the soul to be able to be United forever what if it was that he had could come in him and go back out of him and not seal him but this Oneness built by the man whose name is the branch will seal the people of God and they will never be able to be broken out of this listen to this in paragraph 23 joined in Heavenly wedlock to the Eternal God part of him part of God joined in Heavenly wedlock to the Eternal God part of him part of God now when we come into the New Testament we find that Paul was the Great Master children now Peter never said that about himself nor did John nor did any of the other authors of the New Testament but Paul felt the Liberty to be able to identify himself as a master builder that's quite a statement for a man to make but Paul knew that God had given him the message of that day and he was not only a preacher he was not only an apostle but he was a prophet messenger he was not a prophet like agabus which the spirit of God could come on him he could take Paul's girdle go out there and wrap it around his hands and say thus saith the Lord the man whose this is he's going to Jerusalem to be bound now agribus was that type of a prophet Paul was more than that Paul was a prophet messenger now there is a difference we didn't just need a prophet in this day we needed also a prophet messenger I don't think sometimes even the message people understand the difference a prophet is a man that God can be able to speak to him showing future events showing things even in people's lives but a prophet messenger is one who brings a turn in the road he brings a dispensational change he brings an Enlightenment above his brothers now Peter had some great things to say all the rest of the brothers in the New Testament had great things to say but none of them can you imagine if we would strip out what is called the Pauline Epistles out of the New Testament if we would take out uh first and second Corinthians in Philippians and Thessalonians and Timothy and Titus and Philemon and all the Pauline Epistles can you imagine what we would have left we would have the four gospels we would have Jude we would have James and we would have first and second third John and the Book of Revelation all the rest of the New Testament we would be totally deprived of we wouldn't know what to think about election because Paul wrote more about it than all the rest of them put together we would know how the churches to operate we would know nothing about dress because John never preached nothing about rest John never said nothing about women's hair well come on somebody James never said nothing about women's hair Paul was the one that was given the great truth to tithe the people of God into a Oneness I know a lot of folks don't like theology they don't like Doctrine all they want is just a little experience with Jesus to where he saves him from hell and lets them live any way they want to don't talk to me about all that stuff I don't need it well apparently you do because the Bible is full of it praise the Lord but you see it comes under a prophet messenger now don't doubt the people in that data said man Paul confuses me he writes all this stuff we don't need to understand all that we're saved what more do we need we know you need to know how to love one another husbands need to know how to love their wives wives need to know how to love their husband and the Saints said children need to know how to obey their parents come on Saints and the church needs to know how to behave itself of the house of God is that right but are those things always Pleasant they're not but they are building blocks and making up this body that the great master builder wanted to achieve so all the other ministers then would fit underneath what Paul had preached now what he preached and what James wrote and what Peter wrote and what John wrote it all dovetails together to make the same gospel but God approached it through diversities of gifts now this is the thing we realize Even in our local assembly that God has a diversity of gifts and our body and many times people can become you know distraught because of trying to find what God wants them to do sometimes people think well I don't know what what the Lord wants for me I don't know what does he want me he's saying does he want me to preach does he want me to testify what does he want well if he's called you then he will equip you and God will never set you to do something that himself has not given you the equipment to be able to do it so if God has called a man to preach then that man will be able to preach now the first sermon maybe even the first half a dozen or a dozen that he preaches he's going to be in the preliminary learning stage and he's going to learning how to submit to the spirit of God learning what to say and all of that and he will learn how to operate his gifts and we don't judge them when they stand up and preach two or three sermons and say he ain't called to preach now argument is how can he pray well let's give him a little time and it's the same but every other gift that God gives what is a gift in a person's life the gift is you getting yourself out of the way then God anoints that part of himself what he put inside of you and then he uses himself praise the Lord and then he uses himself inside of you and the anointing comes on you and you sing you testify or whatever it is God's called you to do lead singing or being a Sunday school teacher and the spirit of God uses you for that purpose it ministers to the body now God places the diversity of gifts in every body every local assembly he also does the same thing and every move that has been down to the ages how many Romans chapter 12 verse 3. now what's the great master builder as he goes to laying out some of these principles in the New Testament for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think now notice that a man should not think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly now watch Paul is going to deal with the gifts and he's already dealt with this but at the same time if you wish to read Romans 10 Romans 11 living up to this but he said now whenever you go to looking at what God has done in your life and how God has called you and how God has gifted you and now he's given us all a warning he said don't start looking at yourself and start measuring Yourself by your own view or by your own opinion of what you think well I'm this and I'm that and I'm that and I'm that but he said now according to the grace of God which has been given to me he said I say this to you that a man should not think of himself more High than what God has placed him positionally notice what he said now but to think soberly now this don't mean that you're supposed to stop drinking because these are folks that's got the Holy Ghost so that was gone a long time ago but you realize that some people though they don't drink they're not sober in the way they look at themselves and they can look at themselves wrong in two ways and they can look at that when they do they can be wrong on both accounts now if you whatever you look at yourself soberly and align with what God's giving you and what God's given you testifies of itself because every gift makes room for itself then there's also then where you can go to one extreme on the other side to where that you look at yourself and you measure yourself as being greater than actually you are so in your mind in your thinking you've got this gift and that gift and that gift and that gift and that gift and nobody recognizes it but you you think so you're never used right you're never appreciated enough you're never made over enough and then what happens is most of the time those type of people unless they get delivered from it they will start expanding in order to use what they think they have now if they do have an influence if they're a singer or don't have to even be a preacher but if they are a person of influence and a body or in a family then they will start handing out this stuff you know what I'm this and I'm that and I'm the other and they will become to intoxicate other people on their own thinking of what they are now what's this word soberly it means be sober minded to exercise self-control to put a moderate estimate upon on one's self think of oneself soberly to curb one's passion so now we're not talking about people getting drunk we're not talking about people going out lusting from women lusting for men but we're talking about people looking at themselves and having a moderate evaluation of what they are in Christ and what they think their gifts are and then also of them controlling their passion I also said this is not a lust for marijuana it's not lust for somebody else's wife but it still is a passion it is a Lust For position it is a lust for a position that many times people aren't called to handle well y'all going to get quiet on them and certain look at me or what now it whatever to be puffed up and one's own conceits is the end of spiritual progress to be puffed up in one's own conceits is the end of spiritual progress in Christ because you say why would you say that well because it's the very sound that God the devil kicked out of heaven he was formerly Lucifer which was God's right hand man the fellowship he was the one who stopped the approach to God and all that and yet whenever he began to sing of himself in a position that he was not made for he began to think of himself as what he wanted to be like God yea thou has said in the heart I will be like the most time so he began to think of himself Beyond his god-given God created ability so can you imagine this being that when we know is the devil today at one time was God's right hand man to Fellowship so in the heavens he was the great cherubim that covered he was the stopper of the approach so if any other Angels come to approach Elohim uh Lucifer stopped us oh he had a great position he was the greatest person in heaven next to God but that was not enough for him he did not want to be the greatest person next to God he wanted to be above God now you see whenever people then get saved if people cannot Satan cannot stop them from getting saved he will try to push them to the other side and make them to where they're constantly going over what God called them to be and they're in and out of trouble many people it just breaks your heart as a pastor whenever you see people that are in and out of spiritual trouble years of their life and much of it has to do with this very simple principle that they think they are more than what they really are if they were then they should be able to handle whatever it is they get into and I shouldn't have to come along behind him or any other man of God and straighten out the mess they made but it's like some people can never see it about themselves it's always everybody else is out to get them God brother Donnie don't like me brother Donnie is jealous of me let me tell you that just settle one thing for everybody here and every other person around the world there is not one mortal that lives on the earth that I am jealous of I don't want their gifts I don't want their church I don't want their wife I don't want their kids and I sure don't want their cat okay I don't want nothing I am jealous of no man I've got enough to answer to God for without jealousy I don't want this man's Pulpit I don't want this man's sheep I don't want this man's money this man's reputation this man's gift I just want to be faithful in the little bit that God has given me and I have great contentment and peace in being there because this master builder wrote it in the New Testament godliness with contentment is great gain I'll never be like brother Rod I'm not gifted the way brother Ron is I'll never preach like brother Tim my many many brothers around the message I just think my goodness I wish I could preach like that I wish I could be like that but I might as well quit wishing cause I'm done too old to start over now so I'm just stuck with who I am and you all might as well do the same thing well I wish I could be like soon so quit wasting years of your life listen you were like others just be what God's made you to be find that slot and then minister to the body oh my notice sin you know Paul goes on to say in verse 4. so as we have many members in one body now what she runs a parallel between the human body and he said all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of another so God caused some people to preach and no my they can just hold a Spellbound by the types and the shadows and the stories and whatever others are much more simple preachers and they're not great great Dynamic preachers but maybe God will use them in healing God will use them in signs and wonders but you know the thing is that each of us find our spot and we allow each other to be what God gifted us and then we don't have to sit around and judge well I'll tell you one thing I don't like him because he Don't Preach hot brother so and so well he may know it but remember God is the one who made these gifts and apparently God didn't want everybody preaching like brother Branham or ever preacher would have preached just like brother Branham apparently God didn't want everybody preaching like brother Daryl or like brother Tim or like brother Timothy or brother Wayne Lawson or some of these other great Brothers we can mention if he did he'd make every one of them do just to call him so God would made the perfect preacher and then everybody else had packed their iPad exactly the same way they would have stuttered and you know and not hold their finger that certain certain way and that had that little certain kick every preacher would be exactly the same you'd never need an evangelist because all the advances had preached the same way and you never need a special speaker because the special speaker would preach like your special pastor and then the special Pastor would percept the special speaker and there'd be no diversity at all and before long which sat around more bored than what you are already tonight so what did God do God Diversified the body and he made some that will dramatize when they preach he made some that'll preach real fiery and he made others that are more scholarly now I know sometimes we don't like the Scotty but remember that's the attribute or the adjective that God used the prophet used rather to describe Paul he said that Peter was like a Firebrand Andrew a prayer Warrior and he said Paul was the more scholarly type so let's not be against those men that may not run around the pulpit and jump up and down and all that maybe God's called them to be exactly that way but they have an ability and input on the word that say the Firebrand don't have man it's hard to tame down a Firebrand you imagine a Firebrand preacher one Greek an Aramaic and Hebrew words he don't want to know that stuff he don't want them quotes of prayer for you to read them he blames us in here and preaches like a bolts of lightning blazes back out and he's gone somewhere else but how many knows who he needed evangelist I think share with it now watch Paul said so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members of one another or of another that is so we are so fitted to be mutually dependent on each other this is why Satan wants to divide us I hate to say it but he's had a great success since the church started two thousand years ago and being able to divide people it didn't take long at all just some 30 years after the church is found in the book of Acts then when they come to the book of Jude and Jude was writing to the Saints and telling them to Earnest they contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so Jude was written in 66 A.D so the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost about 33 and a half uh somewhere almost 33 and 34. so about 33 years after the Holy Ghost has just fell and they had already started getting away from the original Faith well what happened they had people coming again that apparently was telling them we know the Nickelodeon Spirit the prophet said wasn't just the preachers but it was the people that no longer wanted the shouting speaking in tongues the worship and the praise and God is that what he said so they begin to settle for something much less and there was another church that was in the making and it was a carnal Bunch that did not have the same experience but now watch what he said that God places Us in the body then there's usefulness out of each member now remember God does not ask you what you want to be God did not say all right now everybody that wants to sing raise your hand all right all right singers singers singers singers who wants to be bass who wants to be baritone who wants to be tender who wants to be second tender who wants to play the violin who wants to play the trombone who wants to play the drums who don't want to play nothing most of them well God don't do it that way it did amazing that gifts and talents will even run in certain families and there's some families they didn't say much they got nothing I mean they can't even carry a straight turn packing a radio around but they love the same I mean it yeah they love to sing but they can't carry it too so you know what they can still obey the scripture because they're making a Joyful Noise they're making a Joyful Noise it might not be on Pitch but they're making a noise and Buddy they're happy that they can make it so praise the lord well let them sing now they may not be the same lead a song leader they might not may not be a song leader to get in front of everybody but we'll try our best to let him sin and we'll put them so far back and we'll cover them up and phone wherever if we have to the light of them sing with all their hearts because they've got a song inside of there and they want to Belt her out well praise the Lord my brother Donald are not on Pitch are not in harmony well that's just little let a little bit of Harmony go because it's such a blessing to them to do it so let them sing apparent everybody in their soft key except for them well these that's the way they think about it now once in Romans 12 6 having the gifts differing according oh my goodness to the grace that has given us I thought we finished up Grace once we got saved do you realize gifts come by the administration of Grace now what is Grace Divine favor that crisis that which you're not worthy of the something given to you when we were lost God gave us Grace so what are gifts they another allocations of the same Grace that saved you so then tell me if God gifted me in a certain way brother down in another way brother Harvey in another way you other Saints all different Saints around the world then what do I have to be arrogant about since Grace gave me the gifts I have Grace gave you by the Rob the ability the gifts for the gym brother Harry my goodness we have some great talent here at our church normally some great singers great musicians and I we so appreciate with all of our heart but none of them brother nor them sisters have a right to stand up and say do you all know how blessed you are to have me here do you all know how blessed you are that I'm here to pray for you all don't you all just want to give me a standing ovation and just say how wonderful I am and you all know how wonderful I am I am a hammer ham we're not interested in you I am or interested in here that's the grade of ham it's not you but people act like that their gifts are something they did or something that well my great desire God saw my passion God saw no no what was it your passion the Reason God saved you he saved you because you've asked him for grace and grace does not stop once we get saved Grace keeps going until the last phase of Grace you'll ever need is Rapture and Grace to change your body so it is the dispensation of Grace notice what he said now having been gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith now notice then so even these gifts are not determined by our ambition our personal desire well this is what I want to achieve no even your gift will work and correlate according to the proportion of faith that God gives you to operate that gift now don't look and oh don't look at your well I'm a businessman and I've done this and I've done that and I've done that and I've been able to accomplish this and that and the other and the cause I've accomplished that now that I'm serving God I will do the same thing with the economy of God that's contrary to God's word you'll never find Paul ever saying use your business this use your you know your resume out there in the world and then we'll compare it with God and God will reward you according to the amount of success you've had in the workplace well if that's so a lot of the greatest preachers that ever lived would never have nothing well the prophet tells us that Noah was a farmer and he was a man that had little to no ambition so he wasn't a great success now how many of you would want to climb on a boat built by a farmer who'd never built one before now Pastor Noah could you show us your resume I want to know what school that you come from to be able to design this boat now was this drawn on CAD did Johnson City approve of your boat I can tell you right now Johnson said he would not have approved of Noah's book we just got through dealing with them so we know how they can be no one would still be building on that boat waiting on Johnson City CEO before Noah could move in amen oh yo look at Moses could he have used his record and God said well I'll tell you what I'll I'll call you and I'll reward you according to your great success you murdered an Egyptian you run like a coward oh so people who look at their success in the natural world and then they feel you know called to do something in the gospel and they think well God will let me do the same thing two different things completely our allocation of such is company together by the dispensation of Grace also measured with a proportion of Faith let me read it again how many loves the word having them gifts differing according gifts differing according to the grace so you mean this please is God that gives would give her according to Grace why do we despise them why do we despise them why do we look down on others that maybe are less than us why are we ought to thank God notice this whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith isn't this amazing now but you know me coming from a Pentecostal background of course I read the Bible whenever I spent across the preacher but I didn't understand this a bit more nothing so to look at it according to that brother thou I can never make no sense out of the scripture in Romans 12 yet I read the book of Romans time and time and time again whenever I said Pentecostal preacher because I never read no other books other than the Bible so I read the Bible I quoted the Bible and I preached the Bible but I preached it blindly because I was not embracing the light of the end time but once I did you see to me the message of the hour did not come to replace the Bible but it come to open the light on the Bible and the Bible became a brand new book to me the Bible did not become a book that I just wanted to do away with well I don't need the Bible no more I love my Bible now more than I've ever loved it well praise the Lord and if you don't you better get to pray now notice then the gifts of God are given by grace and then God will use the gift according to the proportion of Faith so say a person then can be called by God to prophesy and maybe there's we know that there's a couple of ways by which this comes and it's a shame really that most people want only the vocal gifts which is inter tongues interpretation and prophecy that's the three vocal gifts of the gifts that Paul talks about in Corinthians seems nobody wants to give to wisdom and many of those others but everybody wants the gifts that are vocal why well so everybody will hear them I suppose but a person then that God might use and it might be just with a with a maybe in a prayer service and they're they're praying in the spirit of God would move upon them and they would prophesy thus saith the Lord don't go out tomorrow at a certain certain place brother Ben Davis don't go at your place of work because there will be an explosion in your main building to Mark thus saith the Lord don't goes out well if it was the word of the Lord that will happen exactly and the brother Ben believes that brother Ben will stay away from there till after the explosion takes place and then going to make an insurance claim that's right if you believe it's the word of the Lord but if not that same person say we have our dedication service and we have a thousand people sitting in this building and the spirit of God move on them and says oh Jesus oh no no no no no Lord how no no I just don't think I could do it Jesus I don't think why why the proportion of faith for their gift is not given for them to be able to stand before such a group of people you've seen prophets wanted to say what they said how could they do that how could they walk up before Kings potent takes rulers and tell them thus saith the Lord it ain't raining again though I call for it God gave them the proportion of Faith to match their gift so you see if Satan can't stop us from being gifted he'll try to mess up our perception of the proportion of Faith it's the same way with preaching same way the prophesied same way but singing now you know it is some of you that sing my I can imagine some of you that got up here the first time to sing and some of you haven't got up here yet because you're still nervous and you're trying to work up you know I can do it I can do it I can do it I think again I think again and you're still trying to psych yourself up because you thought oh my goodness I don't know if I can do it or not I don't know if I can or not or can you imagine then a person who sings in a church that's about 25 or 30 people and then walk up here oh my goodness they're froze they're just froze they can't even do it why because they're so used to standing before a certain size and the portion of faith has not been released to them to help them do it but I'm glad they're song leaders that can sing to a Congregation of more than 30. right on that we've got preachers that aren't too nervous to preach to a Congregation of more than 40 or 50. and I've told different brothers look I'd like you to come and preach oh no Brother Don I couldn't come to that big place oh Lord have mercy I'll be so I'd be so scared I'd be so nervous and you know what if they feel that way and they don't feel a release to do that I wouldn't want them to do it because they're going to be miserable and we probably will wind up being miserable with some but if they feel the release in their heart and God drops that there for them they say yes praise God I believe I can do it then they have got the proportion of faith that matches their gift you understand that said so you see God not only gives us but God gives us an allocation of Faith how could Daniel be able to face the lion still how could David be able to face the Goliath because he walked right into the anointing of that hour it's the same way with us in this end time now let's read in First Corinthians in chapter 12 verse 12. for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ now this is the body that Zechariah prophesied the Lord Jesus would make nothing at all locked the temple nothing at all thy parents step on nothing like the Temple of survivable nothing at all because it's going to be people all over the earth born of the same spirit of God and that Temple was in one location and one location only so God wanted to make a body where people would be so filled with his Spirit each one of them would be so diverse in what they would do and how they would function notice in verse 13 for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentile book can you imagine some of them Jewish Brothers brother Jack whenever they read this and they said Lord have mercy you mean Paul put them bunch of Gentiles right in with us why there ain't no way they they're standing there like we are you see they totally missed what the mystical body did it puts you and Gentile black white red yellow there's no difference between us amen can you imagine whenever the Jews began to really grab that Revelation and they come up to a gentile the first time and it might have been an Ephesus it might have been Smyrna who knows where it was and they had their first experience in going to a true Apostolic church and they come and those Gentiles they were slaves there was people of all colors there was people of all cultural backgrounds and ethnicity and here comes some of these Jews which would never even touch a gentile for them to touch a gentile they were unclean for hours for them to even get around you and for them to realize what God had done it must have been a powerful Revelation for them to be able to look over and then grab a hold of the Gentile Brothers hand and first of all they felt kind of funny about it oh Lord would I become unclean is this right for me to do that and that shake their hand and all of a sudden they felt that Unity that between the Jew and a gentile the Torah could not produce that Moses could not produce that the law could not produce that but the man whose name is the Braves could oh praise the Lord you don't understand why the grace of God then helps us to cross all types of racial barriers people that have racial problems I'm convinced need the Holy Ghost a white man that cannot hug a black man's neck needs the Holy Ghost and vice versa a black woman that can't hug a white sister a vice versa there's something wrong with you sis well come on preach brother Donnie because you realize you're baptized by the Holy Ghost into the same body and there's only one Superior race and that is the new race and in the new race are black white red yellow they are of all types of cultural backgrounds they're all type of eccentricity but there's one thing they have in common the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost so in there all their differences become as nothing hmm notice in verse 14 for the body is not one member but many verse 18. but now hath God listen to this construction terms now now hath God said the members who said them who talk to me God so you didn't get to choose I didn't get to choose Mama didn't get to choose for you God set the members listen now every one of them in the body I said please the members you see what we're doing friends whenever we kick against what God has given us we're kicking against God's Own pleasure I hope you understand generally depending on which side you are I've never been a type of person that want to be nothing okay I could sit down right here tonight I've been thinking as hard as I've been working the last couple years about taking a sabbatical maybe about I'm thinking seven eight years I might get caught up rested I thought we'd have a vote on it tonight me and Carol's on the ones vote y'all's vote don't encounter now so I'm the type of person that I don't want to do anything I don't want to be up in front of people I know it sounds crazy to you I don't want my picture taken I don't like to be on video I don't want you to be in front of a big crowd some of you have told me brother don't you I like a small Church any of you just told me that know me I'll tell you about so do I I'm what am I supposed to do around everybody else off except me and you now you see God does not set us in the way that pleases us he doesn't even ask us are you okay with this Arrangement are you fine with this for the doubt are you okay with that are you fine my children are you all okay with it I thought I'd run it by you before I did it he didn't even ask us is that right so he just does it and then he gives us and calls us and places it where and according to what purpose and design as it pleases him so if every one of us can find that for those of us who would want to be more than what we're called to be and for those of us and I'll say I'm guilty who would love absolutely love to be less y'all ever notice me when I'm out in meetings and I'm not preaching you notice where I sat that beautiful woman right there my wife preacher said but I come up on the pulpit and I'll tell them I don't watch me on the camera you say that's crazy I know and that's why you belong to this church you're as crazy as I am [Music] I don't like to live just to call me up to sing I'd blow all the pieces worse than preaching just to call me up to pray over the prayer request I'd rather just be the guy behind the scenes just out of the way I I I I don't like any of that and yet God call me to preach you think he ain't got a sense of humor my favorite clothes is a pair of jeans on and a henley shirt or a t-shirt something like that I hate a suit I hate dressing up I hate wearing a three-piece a two-piece I hate it I hate neckties okay what but you know what God didn't ask me but I'm not going to step out here like one of them modern preachers with my shirt tail all stuck out I'd hop on a pair of ball shoes and look like a beatnik that comes with my position and this is the way I'm on a dress and then cause I like it is because it requires it but I want to please him how many wants to please him even if he makes you do something you don't want to do if he makes you less then what you think you are are you okay with that if he makes you more than what you see you are are you okay with that oh some of you didn't say Amen on that part you see according to his pleasure it makes it fit in the economy of God wow but you know what Satan loves to do he loves to get in now manipulate that and confuse people on the way they look at them now some preachers they're only ever now and then speakers to preach a convention to preach four or five times a week they couldn't do it save the life their capacity just isn't there does that mean they're not called of God it does not it means they've not gone into it yet or they may never be convinced and precious but I dare say shame on any of us that would look down on them because they're not they're just as important in the economy of God as the best convention preacher that ever preached you see it's not our say it's not our position to say who can or cannot notice this in First Corinthians 12 19 it will close and if they were all one member well worth the body but now I'll say many members but yet one body now there was a problem we know in the church at Corinth and the spirit of God took this opportunity with the issues that were in the churches I'd like to take each one of those churches sometime and then bring it out to you but in the Corinthian Church that was there was lots of issues there was adultery there was gift problems no it's all types of problems but when we look at the church of corens from the time the first book of Corinthians was written time the second one was written which is about five years later we can see a lot of maturity and a lot of growth in that church I love seeing that myself I love comparing the First Corinthians to the second because you can see even with the Brethren that was called uh living with his stepmother and we can see how that that brother got corrected by the spirit of God and see how that Paul dealt with him and how the man had got changed and straightened out that issue in his life and we can see by the time we come to Second Corinthians the gift problem many of those problems had subsided because they had grown and matured but they were trying apparently they had an idea before them and they want everybody to be one particular member so they wanted everybody to be a hand I love my hand well sort it what would I do without them but also appreciate my heart I appreciate my lungs my liver my kidneys I ain't never seen them but I've told I've got one I've seen X-rays and stuff how many has ever seen your kidney oh you believe you've got one let me sing your lungs or about your brain because everyone I don't say I'm not sure if I have one or not but yet those things which are unseen are they important how does my hands just go up what was it that signaled my hands to go up oh your hands wanted to no my hands do not have the intelligence to raise on their own but God so designed my body and tied every bit of my spinal cord and all my nerves up to the command center which is in my brain and there it sets and most of us only use a very very small portion of it but from there it controls all these movements all these different things how grateful I am oh no wonder David said we are so fearfully and wonderful day that we can lay down now think of it how much God committed in your body to that which even the subconscious would control think of it if God had not put the controls of your body your respiration your blood pressure your heartbeat all those things to when you would go to sleep if God had placed all that in the element of the first conscience if you everyone sleep you died of a heart attack but what did God do God committed many of those things even to the realm of the subconscious and you can go into a deep sleep inspirational slow down and you enter the fourth cycle of course of the brain waves and that's when you're resting the most deep and yet you're not even conscious that you're breathing but you are in and out in and out your heart's beating back and forth is that right why it's that inside of you that we take for granted every time we lay down y'all ever thank God for that I'm thinking about the other day I know you think I'm weird but I was thinking about the other day and I got to thinking about my heart and I just got to thinking you know as loud as that heart is wouldn't it been annoying if God would have made that thing loud I mean every time it's such a boom boom boom I thought who but God who but God could put his pumping valve inside of our bodies and yet very it's not really that deep it's not really that far in but insulated so much that a doctor would have to lay his head over on your chest or get a stethoscope to be able to hear it and yet it's there bumping all the time pumping pumping pumping and God knew exactly the element of decibel let level to be able to set that heart I thought how an amazing thing and how in the world could that have happened by me coming out of a green pond scum and evolving out of that into this no sir it was my father that did such a thing and if he'd done that to the Natural Body how much more has he done to the spiritual body and the church said and I said let's stand look at verse 24. for our calmly parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which is life so God assigns Christians to their talents and opportunities and even allocates their measure of influence in that position now you realize maybe some of you look at some of these musicians and singers and song leaders and whatever ones that oh my goodness I wish I could do that but I hope you also understand that when the more God gifts you it's like the bigger the target is on your back Satan is out to get you because your gift blesses so many people and helped so many people and when Satan sees it it's like it goes from here of being just a lay member that loves God goes to church does everything you can do and God gives you more and more and more and more and the bigger the target is on your back why you're a blessing to others you're a help to others that's why you should pray for the preachers pray for the deacons the trustees Sunday school teachers praise the Lord don't just pray for the preachers of our church we should be praying for the ministry around the world do you realize Satan hates them more than ever before and he's out after him why because they are such a blessing to God's people and they're such a help and God allocates to them a measure of influence you think it don't scare me when I stand up here or down at brother Jason's or the youth camp in Louisiana or the youth camp in South Carolina Lord willing this year and the different places around the world that I'm scheduled to be you think it don't scare me to death to think of the influence that God's given me around the world for decades and you wonder why I wish I was less if I had to answer for this congregation signs alone it'd be something what's one Soul worse but the influence that God's given us around the world the Lord help us help us it makes you fearful because you realize Satan is after you and if he can't get you with women can't get you with money can't get you with popularity he'll try to worry out try to make you so exhausted it wasn't women that nearly got brother Branham it was not money it was not popularity what was it burnout just burn out he went and went and gave and gave so he just felt like he couldn't give no more imagine coming to himself on his way back from Arkansas his truck went off the road and he had his hands laid on a cow's head praying for that cow thought it was a woman in the prayer line had to come off the field brother Donnie for about a year and he said does God do that to a man man does that to himself but he loved the people so much and he felt for the people so much Satan couldn't stop him with the women so what'd he do just kept pulling him taxing him taking out more more more more more more and then it had to come off the field for a year to recuperate help us Jesus help us Jesus how many loves him with all your heart you want to be what God's called you to be brother Donnie I don't need the people of the church now out there you just told a bald-faced lie if God sets you here at our assembly I don't care where else you'll go you'll never be happy if this is where you're supposed to be and if you ain't supposed to be here you'll never be happy staying here you need to find wherever it is God wants you right but when we do then we do everything we can to work together with that body to make it what God wants it to be not Donnie Reagan's church this that the other the body of Christ I mean lots of people remembered tonight as we pray God bless you let's just bow our heads together o Heavenly Father it's a fearful thing to be gifted by you it's a fearful thing to be entrusted by you was influence upon people how many times have I said in my studying try to talk to people and as I begin to talk to them about this or that or the other whatever it is I realize as I move into that channel of the spirit of God and I realized that I've entered into a sacred yet dangerous place because they have opened their life to me as a pastor while I have them there for five minutes 10 or 15 or 30. I can be able to input things that will change their life Lord God help me that it'll always be for the good help every Minister your father that we will never have our own agenda that will never be competition oh Lord but it'll be for one purpose that is the economy of God we don't want this church to be necessarily my church we don't want it to be built in honor of this man or that man but in the honor and Glory of Jesus Christ people being saved filled with the Holy Ghost healed not to the credit of the pastor but to the credit of the Lord Jesus father May each member realize tonight each one of us have been given something to do and if we fail our post it's not just a simple well I don't like the new building I'm leaving and going somewhere else you never even ask us that you never asked us if we wanted to go to this church or that church or another church I pray it'd help people to see what a dangerous thing it is when they just decide they're going to do this and that and the other help us to realize we are the body father and we need one another to function properly help us Lord Jesus how many years saying sure tonight say Lord remember me just raise your hand to him men women boys girls I've never been given that much I doubt that if you're in the body God has given you something sisters you may say well I don't ever preach I can't sing no you may not but it may be your life it may be your dress it may be your influence the way you live around others and what an influence that can be but God is given to each of us something gifts by grace that we can help others oh father would you mind laying your hand over other person standing by you let's just offer a word of Prayer heavenly father as we have our hands won upon the other tonight Lord we're just praying that should help us men women young people dear God In The Name of Jesus may we find Our Place for many of them they have but yet Lord we know that you change us from time to time and we move up I personally think this that we have built here is a change I believe with all of my heart oh I know some of them didn't want it some of them didn't like it some of them got mad at me because of it but they'll look back and realize it was the Lord I'll give them Mercy We Believe father that our life is placed on the earth to serve you I'm not here to please myself I'm not here to please these people I'm here to please you and if I please you I will please those among these people who also please you so if we please you we will please you together and that's what we desire father Lord we're not looking for a great number we're not looking for a big following we're just looking for everyone that you've ordained to Fellowship here with us how many ever that is we want to help we want to reach out many of them think what could I do I'm only a woman well maybe they could go visit some of these with us go to a nursing home go to a shut-in of some of our sisters just let them know they love them some of our young men want to know what they can do or they want to grab an iPad and jump in the pulpit but you never sent them out like that but you told him to begin at Jerusalem start right there at home start but they wasn't respected I've seen it many times in some of the young preachers they want to preach to the Sunday crowd and I'll ask him to preach to the young people and they don't want to that tells me right there there's something wrong with her call a man that's really called of God will preach to one if he has to he'll start at the very bottom oh it's much easier to want a man's position who's been laboring for decades and stepped there in a position that's been built through all the hardships and the trials but Lord God if you want me to preach to one I'll preach to one Lord God if you go of God anything you want me to do Jesus I don't care if it's little or small I don't care if it's redundant I don't care Lord if people never even know nothing about it I'll go Jesus I've tried to stay away from some of the countries around the world where a lot of the preachers go and the brothers are wondering why I won't come and I've told them look y'all have blisters from everywhere I'd rather go to those places than a lot of people don't go where nobody goes and visits them oh Jesus there's a work for us all help us father help us to find our place May Grace minister to us the portion of faith granted I pray Lord God we love you tonight Jesus we love you Lord can we just raise our hands in the presence of the one who hands out these gifts but whether or not you understand this whenever you were born into this world you have every gift in you that you will ever use for the kingdom of God they're in you then they may come to different years and they'll finally manifest themselves but everything you'll ever need is in you so when you see people trying to be beyond their god-given ability you know right there something is wrong do they love the Lord's sure they may love the Lord but they're confused they simply don't understand a man who feels his call to preach and never can preach years after years after years they never can preach there's something wrong somewhere if God calls a man to preach it gives them the ability to stand up and preach that's just the way God works oh my no wonder the prophet said it this is not word but word but he said how much time would save ourselves in God if we go to him who brought us on the earth and say Lord what am I here for help me to find what am I here for praise the Lord praise the Lord what about it young people you young men you know what you're here for you young sisters you know what you're here for your brother's in your 30s 40s what about it brothers sisters we know what we're here for let's find it let's be faithful or some of you older people say brother Donnie I'm in my 70s now I can't do no more I can't no no what you've done is simply changed a dispensation now you've moved into this realm of being an elder Among Us so be faithful be there for these young people to say there's a brother there's a sister that's like a rock look at them they stood through they stood faithful oh man I don't say that much you don't have to your age your faithfulness your faithfulness to Christ your faithfulness to the church to the word and you're not ready to even saying anything but just being there and going right on to the end you know Abraham and Isaac and Jacob all of them became that in their life they were still alive when the light had changed to their sons and their grandsons Abraham was still alive by the time the glory of God had moved to dispensations Abraham was still alive and not one more word is mentioned about him until he dies so what was he doing brother JD he was fulfilling the part of being stable being an elder to the tribe no doubt they'd come and talk to him and they'd say oh my look at him that old patriarch and it set them shake with his hands but he was a patriarch right down to the very end there's something for all of us don't think what I'm too old no you're not too old some of you Brothers just say brother Donnie I I don't know if I'll be any good or not coming to The Men's breakfast come on Brothers we'll push you in in a wheelchair ain't that right Brothers a brother Donnie I don't want to get on the ball court me either pal but I'm still going to eat breakfast and that ball court ain't for me and soccer ain't for me and all that other stuff ain't for me but the fellowship is for me and the good food I have to admit I like the food too so he said I'm too old I I can't do this I can't do that no you need to go to him and say Lord now what am I supposed to do not what am I supposed to do he'll have something for you oh don't you love it brother Manuel we need you buddy ain't that right some of you older brothers she said oh I can't do nothing no don't you tell me that I'll still need you around here I need them gray hairs brother Jack I need that sort of thing because one day that'll be me sitting back there for the Lord tarries there's something for all of us to do how many wants to do it for the grace of God let me read you this last scripture notice how Paul ends it with this that there should be no schism in the body that the members should have the same care and Schism is division or rent something rent tore from the body a division A dissension what causes this when people get out of their place and someone thinks they're called to do this or that or the other and they're not so what do they Cause A dissension a rent a tear in the body they don't have to be a preacher either there's many many an old gray-haired grandma that's caused all kinds of problems in
