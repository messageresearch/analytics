Lord Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 what a glorious thing it is to be children of God Amen to be able to share the glory of God is such an awesome thing for us as Mortals when you think about something that the angels of God are not allowed to partake of but yet we redeemed mortals can partake of something that is so sacred so holy of the glory of God or blessed people aren't we this is Jesus saying we've been looking at it I know for several services but I want you to listen carefully again to these scriptures tonight and as we read them I want you to think in mind now what what the Lord Jesus is referring to when we read these scriptures about the church and what the church is read it with this in mind we're talking about the government of his body the government so according to what Isaiah said the government will be upon his shoulders and his shoulders are not Angelic beings it's the church so when we read this keep this in mind now that the government of the kingdom of of God on the earth is the church not the man-made system not denominations and all that we don't but the mystical body of Jesus Christ think how important that the church is to the Lord Jesus and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it of course and the prophet quoted the scripture many times he said it goes to show the Gates of Hell will be against it though it is against it it will not Prevail we believe that right that it will not Prevail 1 Timothy 3:14 these things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tar long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God now we've been reading this word for for several several services but it's the word Ecclesia and listen what it is a gathering of citizens called out from their homes into some public place an assembly in a Christian sense an assembly of Christians gathered for worship in a religious meeting which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and the ground of the truth and the word ground is to stay prop or support so this is what the true church is now this is also facts what I'm fixing to say to you the majority of so-called churches around the world their buildings could be annihilated their membership ships destroyed their headquarters obliterated off the face of the earth and the kingdom of hell would not be one bit stronger on neither would the kingdom of God be one bit weaker because many of what we call churches today are not the church that Jesus Built as his own right right now remember it's not what you when I say a church is it's not our opinion well I think a church you have no opinion you may to yourself but not to God it's not what I think it's not what any of you think it's not what any board thinks or anybody else this is Jesus making not ours so Jesus doesn't even claim many of these that say that they are churches all they are the prophet defined them and he said they were lodges amen so the way God looks at it it's no different than a Moose Lodge an Elk Lodge a Deer Lodge a cow Lodge a dog Lodge a cat Lodge it's just a lodge that's all it is now they may have they may have his name on the side but just because they put it there don't mean he put it there and let me say it to you like this if the Lord God has not put his name among us we're no different than they are right we may say well we got a message church and what does that mean exactly because we say we believe God sent a prophet and we we quote the prophet on the occasion or whatever more and we think we're a church on that basis we're only a church of the Lord Jesus if the Lord Jesus himself establishes it and then we truly represent him and we are doing his bidding and what he says amen I hope and pray with all of my heart that's what we are amen one day The Showdown will come it's not going to be a Mount Caramel it's going to be a mountain Z and when that Showdown comes only the church that Jesus himself has built Will Go On The Rapture all others will be left here amen I don't want that to happen to you I don't want that to happen to me how many wants to be a part of the Church of the Living God you have a need tonight you would like to be remembered in prayer we have uh many that are sick of course I'm sure that most of you have heard that brother Scott Airwood had a an accident yesterday someone hit him and totally his truck and uh we're grateful that our brother um had some fractured ribs we grateful that he had that but we're grateful that he didn't have any more than that you already see the pictures of his vehicle it was the grace of God that was with him so we want to just remember him that the Lord will just be with our brother and strengthen him you hold your request in your heart tonight and let's just pray together truly heavenly father it's one of the greatest honors and privileges of our life to be able to stand in your presence we lord God have access to your throne access to your heart access to your ear whenever we call upon your name you hear us when we pray what a privilege our president no matter how the world may look at him and think he's such a great man and people in America may think he's such a great guy and Emperors around the world and kings and queens but it doesn't even mean when they talk you pay any attention whatsoever but a son or daughter of God can call a upon your name and Heaven listens amen how privileged we are Lord God we bring our needs our requests before you tonight father we're asking you for our brother Scott Lord that you just be with him and strengthen him and bring healing to his body with these fractured ribs and things that happened to him Lord we thank you Father for your grace to him Lord we know we got many things that are that are going on as far as um Co and flu and this and that and the other and Lord I heard from brother Tim puit today and they just had a meeting and Lord they had a lot of different things affect their people there they had to cancel church tonight we pray for them Father that you just move for every one of them Lord we know dear God that we're human beings and being your children it does not mean that we're exempt from these things but it does mean that you're with us and you'll help us and you'll touch us so we pray that you be mindful of us help me father that I can get out of the way tonight speak through me Lord your words I pray in the name of Jesus and the saints of God said amen amen God bless you you may be seated it's a law of God and a principle of God that I'm sure that that a lot of people in Christendom in this day does not understand it's evident by the way that they live and their reac action to God's Messengers but it is a law of God to be able to hear God's anointed now whenever I say anointed I don't mean someone that's just anointed to be able to pray for the sick and signs and wonders and things like that happen because people can be that and still be false of course in their Doctrine but I want you to watch this in spoken words Original Seed and the prophet here is referring to Isaiah 9 and6 and it says unto us a child is born a son is given his name Shall be Called counselor principes Mighty God Everlasting father and of his kingdom there shall be no end and the government shall be upon what and the congregation replies shoulder that's the part of his body that's his body is it his shoulders in his body where's the government on the earth at in his body Saints shall judge the Earth so if the Lord Jesus has a government in heaven and we believe he does he also has a government on the earth because right now we are in the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven has not yet come upon the Earth but it will but we are in the kingdom of God that's why the scripture says lo the kingdom of God is within you but we're longing for the visible kingdom of heaven when heaven will come down so if the kingdom of God is here then there must be a government by which that Kingdom will operate you cannot have a kingdom without having a government you agree with that so in that government there will be offices there will be people there will have to be of course magistrates as we would say people that will be in certain capacities to be able to do certain things there will be those that will be musicians there will be those that will be singers there will be those that will be great Authority given to them and there will be some that will be given we'll call them Church AE Messengers stars in the right hand of the Lord now watch he says in his body Saints shall judge the Earth Paul said I dare you to go to court with one another and not take it before the church that's right see Saints shall judge the Earth so where's the government going to be upon upon the shoulders his body the government government upon his shoulders that's a part of the body what is it his Earthly strength his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on Earth so God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body on the earth now you can see why that so much in this day more so probably than any other time that has ever been that Satan has such an onslaught against the Church of the Living God he is against the people of God gathering together in a place set aside apart from their homes them coming together leaving their homes coming together praying assembling together worshiping praising the Lord turning in prayer requests hearing the word raising their hands and praising God isn't it amazing that we have a multitude it's like been an explosion in the last 25 to 30 years of hom groups that have risen up all over the world now listen to me carefully not just message people but people that are doing private home Bible study private home Gatherings but they really don't want a leader now what they want is everybody to just get together and we're all going to talk about it and we won't have no leader and we sure won't have no preacher and we sure won't have no deacons and no trustees because we don't believe in all of that we're going to be free from all of that and yet they think they're getting God's mind they're getting a God's mind all right but it's not the God it is the God of this evil age and you'll notice what happens in a lot of these types of settings that what it does it frees up the position and the place to where more women can come into the preeminent part now of course they're not going to take the scriptures to where that the women women are not supposed to speak in church and they're they naturally if they're gathering in a home or just a little meeting like that then you know it's not exactly a church setting so the women can get up and expound a little bit on the word and the women can kind of take over uhoh uhoh now they they despise the government of God in that God committed from the fall All In the Garden of Eden that God committed the government of the Old Testament body as well as the government of the New Testament body into the care of sons of God God never ordained a woman preacher now I can preach and say men if necessary but it'll look better on your all's Heavenly resume if yall say Amen too God never ordained women de God never ordained women leaders in the church but God called men to lead his church praise the Lord now are can women have the Holy Ghost absolutely can they have gifts absolutely but they're not going to be godall preachers because God never breaks his word so you can see then why that a lot of them would want to have just private home meetings and have little things like that to where that the government of the church does not apply to them because of course most of them would look at Paul and say that Paul was an old woman hater and Paul said that women were to keep silent in the church and if they want to learn anything let them ask their husbands at home well of course that ain't going to go over good and this bobhair faint painted face mini skirt wearing Jezebel religion of the age we're living in because the women feel like they've been free I'll tell you one thing Paul gave the women of the New Testament more freedom than they had ever experienced in their life under the law them women really knew what Freedom was but it wasn't freedom to do what they wanted to do and it wasn't freedom to live any way they wanted to live praise the Lord but God gave them real freedom and the only Freedom that there really is the real real freedom is freedom in the word of God freedom to worship freedom to praise Him freedom to live our lives according to the dictates not just of our minds and our opinions but the dictates from God's Own Heart so you can see why then that God's Earthly strength I remember what the horn in every age was to do the horn in every age was the church which was the mystical body which is given to protect the Lamb's rights so the lamb has a right to have a church a church body around the world he has a right to fill his people with the Holy Ghost the lamb has a right to have a group of people on the Earth that he can prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever to prove that he wants to heal the sick and cleanse the leper and raise the dead and cast out Devils y'all going to say Amen with me that's the land L's rights then it's our responsibility to protect the lamb and say you know what we as his people are going to protect the Lamb's rights to have that in so much that we're going to give him our bodies to prove it through us now am I here to convince everybody in the Tri Cities area I am not am I here am I going to go to Every Church in the Tri Cities and try to convince them we're right nope I'm here to get those that God wants us to reach now there may not be but one more in this city that maybe we're supposed to reach there might be 500 there might be 5,000 I don't know how many they're going to be but I pray weekly that God will let us run across their paths so that they can be born of the spirit of God and we can get ready to leave this hell hole cuz I don't know about you I'm getting more sick of this place every day every day it's a more unfit place for for us as the people of God to live in but until that hour arrives I plan on tormenting the devil every day that I'm [Applause] here now notice how how the prophet divides his Earthly strength from his Heavenly strength who would ever thought the Lord Jesus would have wanted Earthly strengths but remember now he's going to build a church and this church is going to be the conveyance by which he will demonstrate his Earthly strength so it's very important to him that they have strength on the earth and that strength will never be recognized by the world but notice he said what is it his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh so listen carefully now God's Earthly strength is not just us passing out Bibles and we do that we have printed thousands of Bibles around the world you don't realize it but you have helped put Bibles in the hands of many many people that never even owned one you have helped print thousands of seal books you have helped print thousands of Christ the mystery and token and all kinds of books and put it into the hands of Believers but we want more than just printing them books and putting them in their hands we want the context of those books to be made manifest in their lives cuz notice this same Prophet that we're printing his message does not say just passing the books out and passing the tapes out is his Earthly strength but it's when what's on those books and what's on those texes becomes made flesh in those Believers that's when it gains its strength oh praise the Lord aren't you glad you realize that so the Earthly strength of the Lord Jesus is when the word is made flesh in us how many wants that with all your heart the word made flesh now notice this in page 114 paragraph 5 he said this is the law of God God's law is to receive a Vindicated servant Now watch how that leoda wants to undermine this position of God's prophet of the age of course and then the other men of God that come underneath the teaching of that same Ministry in order to talk to people into breaking this law of God now Satan knows he cannot make make you do anything he knows that he cannot overpower you he does not have enough power to make you do one thing you don't want to do he knows that we still don't believe that I don't think I think we almost make the devil like God that he's got all this power and he can make me do this and he can make me do that he's lying to you he cannot make you do anything you don't want to do if you don't want to do what he want you to do then tell him no and resist the devil and he will flee from you you don't have to mind him your goal is to mind Jesus Christ not the devil oh my now listen this is a law of God God's law is to receive a Vindicated servant now the prophet then reads St John 13:20 verily verily I say unto you he that receives whosoever I send receives me but now notice again the home group things and lot of things that people are doing there's no one servant that's there they all become you know just sort of like Quakers that's where the Quakers did you know years ago they really didn't have a pastor in the sense that a pastor got up and preached and y'all familiar with the Quaker religion well what they do they'd gather together in the building and the preacher wouldn't just necessarily get up and preach every service but they just kind of gather they may sat there preacher don't get on the platform but they just kind of sat around and hum and sing a little bit and just see who's got something to say well you might jump up and say something then you might jump up then you might jump up you might jump up Lord sound like a lot of jumping to me but I wonder what said so you see Satan knows the law of God is such an important thing he wants to try to get people who go to church to break this law of God and what is the law of God to receive a Vindicated servant notice now the words of the Lord Jesus Matthew chap 10 verse4 whosoever shall not receive you nor hear now remember the Lord Jesus speaking to the disciples they are disciples before they are Apostles listen carefully to that they are disciples before they come into the office of apostleship but the words of disciples before they even get the Holy Ghost were so important to the Lord Jesus that if you did not receive these men you did not receive the Lord Jesus himself now this is prior to receiving the Holy Ghost Matthew 10 this is when he sends them out two by two so if it was that emphatic and that powerful and it was the law of God existing already prior to the Holy Ghost receiving then how much more is it after these men receive the Holy Ghost now this is the order of Jesus Christ Church now how many churches are built on this order come on now praise the Lord whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when you part out of thy house or city shake off the dust of your feet verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable come on now for the land of Sodom and gomorah now I want you to think of what the Lord Jesus is comparing people that refuse anointed men of God to there will be more grace given to a bunch of perverted sodomites that it would be a religious group of people that turned down God's Vindicated servants amen now I debate with that you ain't got no right to debate with it the Lord Jesus said it I didn't say that some some other man didn't say it the Lord Jesus said it now remember these men didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet so they were given the anointing and remember the the word exusia but also the power says two different things so one is a jurisdiction or a power that is given to them by representation which is what they're operating under but it's not uh something generating from within their soul that did not come to the day of Pentecost but they were so administering as an ambassador look at what they were representing so they were an ambassador now remember when America or the rest of the nations of the world send an ambassador and say we send one and we send him to Israel we send him to Jordan we send him to Saudi Arabia Qatar we send him all around the world and though he may be a small man in stature he may be a little bitty guy his nose might be crooked his ear one ear flop down like this and the other and stick back like that his teeth may be as crooked as a dog's High leg he may not have much of a be able to talk and this and that and other but every missile we've got is behind that man every grenade every tank every man in the Army the Navy come on Saints the air force that man and if they was to kidnap that man then every American citizen is standing behind him now that's the way we look at it as a nation what about God on can you imagine those seven stars in the right hand of the Lord Jesus sir and some of these little two before preachers that want to take that Prophet out of that position and place thems in there are you insane brother Spencer is a great man he's probably listening to me now brother Tim's a great man I can see that million dooll smile in Ron's face now he's just looking over sister Connie brother Tim's a great man other great men around the message but they was none of them that was in the right hand of Jesus Donnie Reagan Boney I ain't never stood in the right hand of Jesus there ain't not not another message preacher that ever was there but our church AE messenger stood there so to reject that Prophet do people understand what they're doing brother D you trying to scare people only telling you the truth if I can scare you in somebody else can scare you out now notice verily verse 15 I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and gamor in that day of judgment than for that City verse 40 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me so he that treats you kindly he that actually receive notice now here Jesus doesn't even go on to say your doctrines your correct formula of baptism but they receive you you the person of these God call men look at how the Lord looks at this law of God when it's enacted so if the people of God receive an anointed servant of God the Lord Jesus looks at that as if though they are receiving him amen you can imagine then how it is when the people turn away that servant oh my my goodness he that receiveth you receiveth me so they treat you kindly you know Jesus saying they're receiving me and I will consider that kindness as if you did it to me personally all right now let's turn it around then so what if they refuse that servant what about those that want to say our Prophet messenger well was a false prophet they're calling the Lord Jesus himself false by identification with the office then those that would choose a false teacher over a true anointed servant of God and it's always been people's always done it but they don't recognize and when we stand before the Lord that day and all their lives is going to be projected on a screen as it were and there will be the very moment that they walked out from under the administration of John of Paul of Timothy of Titus of Luther of Wesley of Pentecost of Elijah and every other man of God that they forsook and then they joined themsel up with some other man that claimed to be a prophet as someone a preacher friend of mine had called me last night and was telling me of of a certain video that someone had sent him in another country many many thousands of miles away from here and the the preacher was standing up and telling them a message preacher so-called standing up and telling the people that he was the Fulfillment of Revelation 81 that he was they had gone beyond Revelation 10:7 that gone beyond the seventh angel messenger and that he was now that great fulfilling of the brother Tomy brother Donnie he said there in that clip I saw look like thousands of people as they were screaming and hollering and almost like making an obeisance and a worship to this man I don't have a problem in believing that since I stood at that church in that church several years ago and preached and saw the spirit that was there you see to turn away from True anointed men of God how God looks at it as personal he looks at it as as personal that's what he says himself for and that's not my words notice Jesus goes on to say now let me say this before we leave this that do you understand that you have the opportunity every day to do something kind nice thoughtful to the Lord Jesus himself on when you've done this to the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me he says that ain't just preachers how many of y'all would buy Jes Jesus a pair of shoes if he needed them pair of clothes what about if Jesus was hungry would y'all buy him something to deep Jesus needed a place to live would you buy him a house he never owned one when he was here the first time would we have built Jesus a house we Liv in here and then that day and we had the finances to do it would we would we build him a house we would well I wouldn't live him then but by his Grace we have been allowed to build him houses all over this world for he and his children can gather together amen and there meet and worship and pray and hear his word oh glory to God I can't wait for that day to arrive when you walk before him and he will say thank you and you'll say for what Lord you built this church you done this you what Lord we didn't know nothing about that we didn't know nothing about that when you done it to the least of these my brothers you done it to me notice in verse 41 he that receive us a prophet now wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoaa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa I thought all the prophets them dispensation ended in the Old Testament and yet Jesus is still referring to it as if though there's going to be more prophets in the future instead of HE that received past tense and oh yeah that won't be no more no Jesus knew there's going to be more in the New Testament he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet so he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet now notice what he's going to get shall receive a prophet's reward I love it when somebody was in 1964 in question answers whenever they asked brother brandham about the scripture and he said 'w what that means is you can be a friend to the prophet it might come in handy sometime amen well I was not allowed and most of you were not there's still a few here that was able to see brother brandom but most of us were not allowed to be there but still yet we can still receive the prophet's message and part of the benefit that we will get is not just being so much a personal friend but being able to have under that influence the true interpretation of the word of God for the age that we live [Music] in so the prophet receives the hidden man according to the Book of Revelation and he has a little special inspiration from the Pres of God and then God gives that inspiration to the prophet and then we that are friends of the Prophet I don't mind telling you children I'm glad to be a friend of this message I know a lot of folks have turned enemies against it and there's going to be more as we go along and it's going to break our hearts as we go but just get ready for it it's got to happen but there's going to be folks that are going to be friends of this message right up to the end and and actually that's what the Rapture is it's a gathering of family and friends amen Jesus said I have called you my friends because you are an intimate connection was what I have on my heart now notice how Jesus relates this thing so he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet reward now want you notice now it comes on down he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward now Jesus doesn't say it here but he goes on later and Matthew and said he that receives them one of the least of these or does something to the least so it starts with a prophet and then a great righteous man then he comes right on down to the least which is me and probably most of you but we're still covered in in the blanket coverage so you see whenever the Lord Jesus is now looking at what what are we talking about the government we're talking about the government will I ever have a position not brother random Lord no I I don't want that kind of position I'm not called to that kind of a position I'm not called to have a position like a lot of Great Men but I do have a position and I want to be faithful to what I'm called to do how many wants to be and those that receive the Servants of God under the law of God it will pay off for you sir as a matter of fact it may not be too much longer the way all the signs of the times and stuff are looking that you're going to get a real reward it'll be a prophet's reward a righteous man's reward an obedient reward it's going to be Award of the ultimate you're going to get your body changed huh oh my Hallelujah notice Jesus again in Luke 10: 16 he that heareth you wow Hearth me he that despises you friends I I don't I don't I don't think that we we take this at face value but brother Donnie you make so many mistakes and and brother brenon was a human and he had that human element there and and and Paul had that human element and Peter had it yeah you're right just like every Ambassador we've ever had in the United States so it's not the humanity it's not the human mistakes it's what they represent and what they're trying to do with all of their heart so if there's any person here tonight that's free from mistake please stand I was hoping the one going to be nobody dumb enough to do this I'm fixing jerk my belt off and wear you out I'm G to cast that Lon devil off of first I'm G to beat the farad of you there are no perfect people there are no perfect pastors there are no perfect churches and if you ever find one don't move there cuz you'll mess it up shes the world but I'm going to tell you before you go there there are none there never was one perfect Prophet there never was one perfect Pastor there's only one perfect Lord Jesus and all the rest of us are looking to him for our [Applause] Perfection so friends where does that put people in this age that despises our prophet Prophet messenger not only the prophet now but his pastors his evangelist his teachers oh my goodness oh it you just you wouldn't hardly believe it but you can you can imagine in your mind how the five-fold ministry is so criticized ridiculed and made fun of by those who identified themsel as tape only you cannot believe the jokes that are told about preachers and these people listen to tapes every day day and night day and night day and night and life not every not all of them but I've heard many of them through the years and to realize one day they're going to walk before the Lord Jesus and he's going to look at them and say why did you laugh at my pastors why did you laugh at my evangelist and made fun of them and you said well why in the world would you want to hear some old preacher somewhere when you got the perfect word on tape and it'll say back to you if you listen to those tapes you have know why they preached because your messenger told them preach the word brother brandom said say what to tell say how can I do that if I do it by just pushing a button I've got to say come on somebody come on somebody brother remember said I know I see my end out yonder and I know these young men will take this same message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord Jesus the government of Jesus Christ is not a tape player the government of Jesus Christ on the Earth is not a bunch of men that are businessmen come on somebody that's trying to tell the bride what to do but it's God called men and women filled by the holy ghost that are living this word day by day they live right they walk right they do what God calls them to do that's the ones that's going in the Rapture and the others are going to be left setting [Applause] here that's his government praise the Lord you see when God's people receive God's ministers they're welcoming the king's ambassadors into their home so you imagine how it was when Golda Mayer received America's great representative he doesn't go to meet her in the knesset he goes to meet her in her home she's wanting planes she's wanting missiles she's wanting all kinds of things to use against her neighbors cuz she's totally surrounded by Arabs and every one of them want to see them annihilated so she's in the kitchen making Honey Cakes she doesn't look like a representative she doesn't maybe look like the Prime Minister but she was so she brings him out some honey cake and they go to talking and she brings him out something to drink and she says we want this and no no no no we we can't do that no no no no we we'll get in trouble of Saudi Arabia we can't do this she just keeps laying on the food and the drink making more honey cakes and more Honey Cakes but the time she got done with our great representative she got everything she wanted it looked totally impossible because he went there with his mind made up but she was determined her Nation needed to survive let me tell you one thing children oh the people of God you know what you have need of in your life tonight many of you maybe you're say you don't even know what you need grab a hold to the power of God and say Lord I ain't letting go I need healing I need Deliverance I need the Holy Ghost my husband needs save my wife needs save I ain't letting go come on pile the worship on top of it oh Jesus I love you so much Lord I ain't letting go till my wife is filled with the Holy Ghost I ain't letting go to my husband is saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost I ain't letting go keep piling on the Honey Cakes honey amen keep P them all he'll give you the F14 t cats he'll give you the Hellcat missiles and it'll blow hell P [Applause] apart oh I can see him as he goes in and he sits down at that little small table and he opened up his diplomatic papers and there's his name all over everything Washington's waiting to hear what he's got to say he represents the president he represents millions of Americans he represents Congress he represents the Senate but he has the power to allocate or say no but the way she was looking at it no was not an option am I wish some of us had that same attitude no ain't an option praise be to God the finally said we'll do this he said I want more we do this I want more come down to the table and he said if you promise to give me this recipe you imagine tra a recipe for F14 Fighters Hallelujah trading a recipe Oh Glory to God you may look like you ain't got nothing to offer but he says will you give me your praise will you give me your love oh glory to God will you give me your adoration oh water my seed I I'll bring healing I'll bring Miracles among you I'll bring the supernatural among you if you give me your praise if you'll give me your love will you get down on your knee would you raise your hand on nobody else's do I don't care if none of you worship God I'm going to I don't care if none of you say praise the Lord I'm going to I've got a need I've got a need Hallelujah so she was was focusing on him not on Mr Johnson not on the Secretary of Defense not on the Secretary of Education or the secretary of the housing he was the representative of the United States of America and he held a pin in his hand and he signature on the bottom meant they would get everything he promised amen oh if you could look as men of God that they are representatives of Heaven amen I ain't got no power now the rest of these preachers has got any power as far as power for us to do it but I do have authority this man wasn't the president he wasn't the vice he was a lot of other men there's man there that people would tremble at their name but he represented them men of power and God used that man God it must have been the presence of the Lord that come in her humble little home because they was going to need them in a little while cuz all hell was fixing a brick loose on Israel if we could come to this place and realize I ain't going to hear Donnie Reagan I ain't going to hear darl Ward Joe jool it ain't that so much right I'm going to hear Heaven's ambassadors praise God you young people when you come I'm not coming just to you're my favorite young preacher I'm coming to hear Heaven's ambassadors amen I'm coming to your men of God that represent the embassy of the New Jerusalem praise the Lord I don't represent Nashville I don't represent Washington DC I represent the King of Kings I'm the Lord of lords I'm the most high [Applause] God that's when my friends we will start seeing things like we've never seen [Music] before brother benam knew the time would come and he spoke about it one Sunday morning and he comes back at Sunday night he you said I felt so inspired when I said it this morning that one day Divine love I'll read it to you maybe Sunday Divine love would so get a hold to the church he said then the gifts you won't focus on them he said don't seek the gifts seek the giver but he said one day that Divine love will come into the church and he said then you'll see Healing The Sick raising the Dead Open the Eyes of the blind cuz it didn't won't be us operating just gifts well this man's greater and this man's little and this man's in the medium it'll be divine love himself oh some of you is wondering and you're pondering and you're trying to figure it out brother D when are we going to ever come to speaking the word speaking the word how you going to speak the word if people don't recognize who they're talking to and who's preaching pring and who's anointed if your faith will never go higher than laying hands on the seil I'll do that because I love you but what if you could move to a sphere where you can walk up and say speak the word oh now you're getting scared Ain you why why go to my ear looked at that man she knew all of America was behind him she didn't need millions of residents to show up on her steps she needed one man I can see it as it's going through the air and it seems like a normal flight but all of a sudden the pilot begins to experience something unusual in that flight as they start coming near Memphis wasn't turbulence wasn't low on fuel it wasn't check the engine light but was an old black sister down there that little Old sheny Tail oh Lord Oh Lord you see my boy oh Lord I like that shoot of my woman but where's your Elijah Oh Glory to God

mansion it didn't look like a fine let me tell you one thing friends I don't care what we own in this life how nice our car is I hope that we have the kind of fa that we could ground an airplane that we could put a jet plane on the ground and say Lord God I've got to need I've got to need send a man of God my way hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah so here he goes down through there [Music] one of them I'm so glad morning Parson how'd you know I was a Parson so I've been s here waiting on you do you want her back let me tell you something G we look at our worst and our value what goods that to

say somebody do something for Donnie somebody go down there and help Donnie he's in need is that what you want oh my I don't want to just have a great name of this and that and the other I want to have a reputation in heaven that when I pray the angel said look out Donny's praying look out Jack's praying look out Dan's praying look out Hallelujah am said I be like that that woman in the Bible see you heard said yes sister I've heard better her so will you see my boy he went wavered he's got this disease said would you come in I said yes ma'am he said I've been in palaces I've been here and there I never felt more welcome in my life uhoh when a man of God feels welcome in your home that means the angels of God feel welcome if you got the kind of house and a man of God walks in and he can tell I don't you anything think I'm some kind of spook or some type of spiritual nut but I've walked in many message homes I didn't know if I was I didn't know where I was at by the feeling that you feel something not right something unclean something ungodly the prophet said if you want angels to visit your home you got to have the right kind of home my we wanted to have the kind of homes in the Word of Life Church that the angels of God are around our breakfast table they're around our lunch table they're around our dinner table the angels of God feel so welcome praise God you remember the story you pray for him he said sister won't you pray first and he said friend you could tell she had talked to him before oh yeah what a reputation for Elijah to have did you ever notice in any of the times he relates to that story he doesn't comment about how many quotes she could quote I've never found one spot where he says how my greater memory was in quoting the Greek and the Aramaic and the Hebrew and all that sort of thing but what was noticeable to him about her was she had talked to him before and she was able to bring something down J Shan with that woman's Faith done she grounded that airplane or you say brother Donnie don't sit there look at me like that I just read it yesterday he said her face grounded that airplane she had such Faith with God it wasn't right hard it wouldn't have check an engine light her face got a hold to that and God said who's in the area who's in the area and near Memphis oh just works out my Elijah prophets in the area Hallelujah well go ahead and ground that jet plane and we'll put his schedule on hold I've got a daughter down there that needs Deliverance [Applause] when people receive God's ministers they welcome the king into their home Lord God now will you pray well yes sister bowed his head prayed a simple prayer he was laying said he thinks he's out on a sea and it's real dark and she took her hand and laid it over on this head of this black brother boy brother remember said he's a big boy said she laid her head over her and said said Mama was baby I thought you said I thought yeah no matter how big he is how wrong he's done but he's still mama's baby it's dark and then God's representative she didn't need tomahawk missiles she didn't need Tom Cat 14 or 81 Avenger warthogs she needed Elijah with the ability to touch the heart of God and it went from to Mama it's getting Li in here mama it's getting Li in here the representative Hallelujah he represented the Kingdom of Light sat the king of Darkness had sent his Angelic poers and pull that boy into a world of Darkness but God had an ambassador of light you remember a couple of years later when he's going down through the train station he's going up there and there he said some little red cap come on say p and BR him p and BR him he said the meals on that train was so high he got off the train he said to get him some of them sack of hamburgers and he said that was this little little boy holiday said Bor BR P BR he said yes son he said don't you remember he said I don't remember you he said don't you remember so long ago you come to my house he said you that boy said yes and I be a Christian now well is anybody else in you going to say I be a Christian now I be a Son of God I I be a daughter of God I've got the Holy Ghost I'm a right to the kingdom of God and eyes got a need tonight too Lord eyes got a need tonight [Applause] you see if a man or woman receives a man of God he's receiving God's representative and God's Ambassador you see often opposition to a pastor or an evangelist or especially a prophet actually shows people's opposition to God oh they don't think it's that way they think it's that man but it's actually their opposition to God's government on the earth oh I'm wonder if it would be possible while we're in his presence we could be able to open our hearts tonight there several ambassadors of the king in this building I don't mean that an ambassador is more of a that man that was there was no more than American than any other farmer or whatever in America but it was his position his position let me read you this in discernment of spirit 1960 knowing surely that in the day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitude toward the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination friends you see how serious this is when a man of God is bringing you the word do you understand how serious that is I'm not talking about his opinion I think I feel I believe I'm talking about bringing you the word of God and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitudes toward the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination now he's praying this to God therefore Lord in that day we will be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to do you understand that I will stand in the day of judgment against those who have sat in our church and turned their back on this message and walked away I along with others will stand there and be a witness against them as so you will but what if you've been true what if you've been faithful and I turn around and I go to walking before him and I turn around this way and look and there you are are let me turn around and be able to say come on children come on and then we'll go gather together under the opes of the ministry of the seventh angel every Pastor every evangelist of this age that's told the truth gather their trophies and there will be standing by the mill ions and we'll all stand there under the oaces of the star we have seen his star in the west we didn't come to worship the star we come to worship him there we will stand all the true men of God and then under the opes of that church A's messenger he will turn and say Lord Jesus these are your people oh Lord God I saw them in the sixth Dimension when I was able to go years and years before I was taken there and they told me then one day you'll be judged and you'll be if you're accepted and you will be we'll go in on your teaching you imagine as we stand there in the millions and the prophet will start taking a step and then then the men of God behind him and the saints of God and there will all go just walking up into the presence of the great king there will come Paul there will come araneus there will come all the church A's messenger remember the sixth Dimension brother bam never saw Luther's group he never saw Wesley's group he only saw his and we'll stand there in our ranks in our battalions remember the prophet tells us in In Heaven There are rank ranks in heaven so people that have problem with rank in this life guess what they miss heaven cuz they have a problem with God's government I won't be preaching there but I will always always so will every other God call man have a position in God cuz it's not just time it's an attribute that is forever amen so for those of you in this message that don't like me you better get your heart right with God cuz whether you like it or not I'm going to be in heaven and I'm going to be in the same age that you are and you ain't going to be on one side of that age and me on the other side God May plant me right next door to you be your next door neighbor but don't worry there won't be nobody there with an attitude all attitudes are dumb be gone come on Saints oh my let me read this and we'll close Matthew 18:18 verily I say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven so heaven doesn't necessarily listen to a president or a king or a queen listen Angels aren't even given this Matthew 18:19 again I say unto you that if any two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything they shall ask it shall be done of them from my father for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them John 20:23 whosoever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them friends this ain't skin milk now who are we talking about we're talking to the representatives of heaven and people think they can treat men of God like a piece of trash and they can disrespect them and dishonor them and think they're fine with God you disrespect God's men you disrespect God that's right listen whosoever sins you remit they are remitted and whosoever sins ye retain they can scream and holler and Run and Jump and shout all they want to listen it's the government of Jesus Christ on the earth whosoever sins you retain they are retained amen I'm going to read a little bit more just in case the devil ain't passed out I'm hoping this next quota go ahead and just knock him out you can only serve God as you do and believe the servants that God sends you can only serve God on Earth as God's servants that sent on Earth by divine inspiration interpret God's word to you you see that's why we didn't need another commentary of the Bible we didn't need another Bible scholar we didn't need another Bible teacher we needed a prophet of God am yes sir let's stand let me read it again you can only serve God on Earth as God's servants that sent on Earth by divine inspiration interpret the word to you you believe that you want to put down some scriptures forth 1 Corinthians 14:16 Paul said you follow me as I follow Christ also chap 11 verse1 Luke 10:16 see what he said Jesus said there in Luke 10:16 hether heareth you heareth me he that despises you despises me he that despises me despises him that sent me look what the says that proves that God speaks his message through his amen servants always has so it can't change today can he so what do y'all need tonight now I went through Burger King on Monday I ordered a large drink now you know how Burger King has changed their little jingle deal you know whenever you come through welcome to Burger King where you rule any y'all been through Burger King since they've done that okay were you rule so I ordered a large drink and the lady said sir I'm sorry we don't have no large cups I said' all right give me a medium so I go up to the window to pay and there's a woman there that I know a little bit you know just by coming through there and I said so ma'am I wanted a large drink but y'all ain't got no large cups I said so really even though you all tell me I rule I don't rule do I she said that is so funny well I wasn't too tickled about it so I go through there today I'm going to come over to the church to do a little bit of work and I wanted another large drink and the woman said I'm sorry we ain't got no large Lids so you know what I'm finding out about Burger King I Only Rule as long as the supplies last let me tell you one thing our God is not short on anything he ain't short on healing he ain't short on Miracles well praise the Lord he ain't short on the new birth he ain't short on the Holy [Applause] Ghost so what do you need tonight you need healing you need Deliverance whatever you need the king is here and I am only one of his ambassadors but I do know this I do represent the greatest King that has ever been on the earth and I represent a kingdom unlike Napoleon which would come to an end unlike the kings and queens of the earth that will come to the end I represent a king whose kingdom was before the foundation of the world and will never be destroyed you love him with all your hearts so do we want to obey the law of God don't just come to church expecting to hear a man but brother Donnie ever preacher I ever heard had mistakes yeah I know remember brother Fred was texting back and forth the other day many him have good conversation back and forth about the word he was talking about nature seeing God in nature and send me a bunch of quotes beautiful quotes you know brother BR said you can see God in nature but you know what I also see in nature deaths I see freezing temperatures plants being killed people having wrecks on slick roads so I see God in human beings but what do I see in nature I see God using a flawed nature look out here at our beautiful mountains why a that beauty y'all think they're beautiful now you need to get your eyes checked they're at their ugliest stage right now but we know it won't be long Buffalo Mountain will be beautiful again there'll be another spring is that right but we still believe God is in his nature do we not so we look at one another and sometimes our flesh and it's hard for us to see God through our old stinking Humanity but if you can see God in wintertime and you can see God in storms and you can see God in lightning and you can hear God in the Thunder and you can see God with the Earth tilted over on its axis then surely we should be able to see see God and flawed Humanity God speaking through a preacher God using a flawed song leader a flawed piano player a flawed organ player a flawed bunch of people sitting in the pews flawed deacons flawed trustees flawed flawed flawed Lord Lord Lord but God manifesting himself in a flawed humanity and doing things through them flawed humans he could never do through sinless holy purified Angels do you understand when brother Daryl Ward stands Before the Throne of God God will say things about that Son of God that he could never say about the greatest Archangel the greatest cherubim soon men of God that's travel brother Jackie bent when he stands there he can't travel hardly no more but when he stands there and all the souls or R behind brother Jack all the trips that he's made to the Philippines and up in them jungles and all them saints stand there and the Lord go oh brother Jack I want to be near you buddy Hallelujah and you imagine them angels to stand there which never said one bad word never had one bad thought in their life and God will reward our brother Jackie Benton with the reward and the cherums will stand there just cuz God chooses flaw things to do his greatest work with that gives me hope that gives us hope don't Brother G don't it brother Jonathan don't it Carol don't it brother Melvin bless skip don't it give us hope Hallelujah SP praise the Lord hallelujah but brother Donnie what if you ever leave the word and can't be corrected that's simple the prophet said you follow your pastor till he leaves the word the man leaves the word you leave the man what's hard about that come on Saints amen if brother Brandon would have left the word we would have left him Paul said follow me as I follow Christ and the Saints in that age never found where he ever left the word even though some of the things that he said they couldn't find nobody else that said them yeah but unlike some of the smart atct theologians around the message who think they know more about it than our Prophet messenger you know friends I'm convinced a lot of the folks have said they believe this message don't really put the prophet of God of our age on the same level as prophets of other age they simply take his teaching as some kind of you know Bible study and well I I I take that and I take that and where you going to stand when you stand before God that day there's a difference in a prophet saying thus sayeth the Lord and a prophet's teaching he is teaching we not only have thus sayith the Lords in this message but we have the teachings of the message The Ten Commandments were the only ones that God wrote by his own finger the rest of them Moses wrote by inspiration were they not as inspired so what if the people said well I'm only taking them 10 I don't want the rest of them come on somebody if it comes right down to it I'll take the prophet's word over yours or mine or anybody else's come on somebody oh my I me want your heart open to the Lord tonight look friends let's receive God's word the devil's going to do everything he can to question The credibility of this Prophet messenger before us why if he questions his credibility then what he had to say is worthless if you cannot trust a man I don't care what he says and what he does if you can't trust him what difference does it make that's why Satan is on the Rampage to try to make us as the followers of this word question The credibility of this message well I don't know about you he's come too late for me praise the the Lord I done burn all my bridges and blow them up ain't no way back why in the world when I want to go back to Pentecost why in the world would some of y'all want to go back to baptist come on now and I don't want to go back to a message version of baptism or a message version of Pentecostalism I've done been there and seen what that produced be no turning back for me praise God let's bow our heads if you would Lord Jesus as we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth tonight from whence we were taken this is one of the sad parts of being a preacher I realize that I will stand that day and give an account of what I've said tonight I know there's people that stream our services and some that archive them and they go back on only to try to find fault and trying to see what they can find I feel sorry for them Lord because instead of hearing the truth and trying to hear correction they're looking for mistakes no doubt I give them a bunch tonight cuz I ain't never preached a perfect sermon been preaching nearly 40 years and I've never preached one perfect sermon I've preached thousands of them to tens of thousands of people around the world and I've never had a perfect one they've been flawed and I've misquoted things or missaid things not intentionally just the human element just like to do the profit they look for mistakes and look for errors spend years of their life trying to find well he said right here this so many people there and over here he said something else see he's a liar no it means he's a human being like like all the rest of us I wonder how many of us tell our stories and how they changed over the years and we remember them happening a certain way when we was 10 years old and if somebody videoed that story we're telling it 10 and would show it back to us at 50 we'd say that video is a lie there ain't no way that's a truth because we committed it to memory wrong and when we recall it we recall it in the wrong way and we tell over and over and over again and we would absolutely die that it was the fact I didn't want you base your word on Lord you don't base it on the recall of men Matthew says there was two Blind Men there the other writer says there was one the four accounts of the gospels recording the very same incident one says it was a purple robe the other one says it was a scarf which is it's not the same color at all shows how ignorant some of the people are if they really knew their Bible they'd know their Bible was written in the same way to Blind the mind of the wise and prudent we don't want just the verses we don't want just the chapters we want the author and if the author is living in our soul than those things which the world points that and says this ain't right and that ain't right and that ain't right well to us all we see is a love letter from our lord Jesus Hallelujah Lord God May Carol and I always have a home where the angels of God can visit may I have a walk with you father where your spirit can deal with me every every day of my life I have been one blessed man in my walk with you Lord there's hardly a week goes by in my life and that's happened since I was just a boy that I haven't heard from Heaven sometimes day after day you'll speak to me then you'll go silent for a few days and here you'll come again I count it such an honor to have been able to to hear the voice of God throughout my walk with you I've been given great friends I've been given the ability to hear the greatest message that has ever swept the Earth thank you Father I am not ashamed of this message nor am I ashamed of this Messenger as Paul told Timothy be not ashamed of what I say or be not ashamed of me so there already must have been an element of reproach that was moving in the first church age and Paul had to remind young Timothy to not be ashamed of him no doubt people was critical of Timothy quoting a prophet because to Timothy it was more than just books it wasn't a commentary it was the word of the Lord no doubt out it was very humiliating and embarrassing to say well where is your Mentor this Paul that you're telling us about where is he uh he um well um he he he um he he's doing a prison term he's in prison it must have been embarrassing it must have been humiliating but they didn't look at that that they looked at what that man had to say Lord God may we as your people look Beyond brother Daryl's Frailty brother Joel brother Joe Lord these other ministers that here at our church Lord these young men feeling a pull in their hearts may they look Beyond mine as I look Beyond theirs may we look beyond the humanity of your servants around the earth may we look oh God to their packing the message of the king would it really matter to us if the king sent us a message if the messenger was to stutter or if the messenger didn't have the best etiquette and the messenger didn't have the best ability I don't imagine the gold of my ear really mattered to her or that great Ambassador was left-handed right-handed whether he combed his hair to the left or to the right or whether he had one hair on his head or not what she was interested in was his authority her country needed help and she was going to do everything in her power to pull on that man Lord Jesus we need help tonight we're living in a dark age a sinful age we need help we need help Lord Jesus we
