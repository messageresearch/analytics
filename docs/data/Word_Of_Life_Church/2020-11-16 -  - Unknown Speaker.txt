jesus we turn our eyes to you right praise be to god we're so happy that we have him to look to today i feel sorry for the majority of the population of the earth today many of them do not have a clue what awaits them for many in america they do not have a clue their ends will be filled with craters explosions that'll be so tremendous before that ever happens earthquakes that will be beyond anything our nation has ever known millions will die at one time a chunk of the earth three to four hundred miles wide fifteen hundred miles long we'll break off fall plum down into the core of the earth towards the core of the earth tidal waves shoot plumb back to kentucky i'm glad i've got a hiding place you know what it is eagle feathers that's one reason i love this message because it is a gathering of the eagles i used to fly around with the crows i used to sit with the chickens come on you did too but i'm so glad i finally one day realized who i was by the grace of god amen gracious today in the name of the lord jesus so happy for the opportunity to be gathered together again today and in the house of god we know we're living in strenuous times difficult times but there are also great things that are happening as we just heard the testimony there a while ago and the lord is doing doing wonderful things we had a waiting here on friday so right in the middle of difficulty middle of hardships good things are happening brother aaron and sister melissa vaughn had a new baby boy that was born so here's marriages and babies being born and the time that people are dying distress and trouble and heartache while people don't know what to do it really just depends on the way you're going to look at it trouble going to come certainly it's going to come but we have a way to be able to deal with it by the grace of god we have a promise that the world does not have and that is that all things will work for the good to go to them that love the lord who are the called according to his purpose how many can witness that today that it's happened in your life things that it looked like there's no way that it would work out and out of some hardships that seemed so unbearable and yet god turned something into it and just make it such a tremendous blessing amen let's turn again today if you would to the book of romans chapter 8 chapter 8 and verse 8. we'll read a few verses here i want to speak to you animals today on the way you got back now i'm not sure if you all understand or not but everybody that i'm looking at is an animal this man you're looking at here on the pulpit is an animal paul was an animal i'm gonna make some of you mad but william branham was an animal all the branham family are animals all the reagan family are animals you might as well say it just go ahead but god wanted to make a way to be able to get us out of that animal dominance that controlled our lives so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god that is living by the nature of the animal life living in the flesh and after the flesh but ye are not in the animal life but in the spirit if so be the spirit of god dwelling you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life now you notice this is capital s which is not human spirit but holy spirit god's presence but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies because you learn to memorize the quotes and because you learn to memorize the word no that's not the way you overcome right you could be a marvelous theologian you could know the message and know the bible know the greek and the aramaic and the diphthongs and all the rest them thongs and in and out and all that stuff that goes with it and be as lost as loss could be because it's not the knowing of the word that quickens your life into obedience but it's the spirit he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you how many like to be remembered today as we go to the lord in prayer let's just pray god will open our hearts shall we to his word lord jesus we love you so much today thank you father for redeeming us lord from ourselves god i pray that you would open our understanding today may the marvel and the mystery of what you've done make it simple for us today would you lord i pray god that your great presence would take the word i've read it and i will read more here shortly and try my best to help them to see it but really i can only go so far it takes you to help us lord god may your presence come today you saw that there were hundreds of hands that were uplifted here today signifying a need some might have been small some might have been so urgent that they don't know what to do but you're a god the only god that there really is that can give life and answer prayer lord as i've stood in the hindu worship festivals and see them lord god take long pens about six inches long and run them through the tongues of those worshipers seen them take gigantic grab hooks and put in the backs of those people and watch them as they would pull those carts with these idle images on them they would be so far out under demonic anointing they didn't even know where they were but lord god there was not a god of life there anywhere it was just heathen idol worship lord jesus we don't approach an idol today we do not want to even make your cross an idol or we don't want to make you an idol we want you to be a living god for an idol god we can pick it up in our pocket polish it we can change its looks and that's what many people have done to you they have this idol called jesus christ they have an idol that they call jesus christ but they have changed your character they've made you fit their modern ideology of this day but we don't want no idol called jesus christ we want a living god called jesus christ that we cannot shape we cannot change we cannot alter but instead of us wanting to alter you we want you to alter us granted i pray today father in the name of the lord jesus and the saints said amen god bless you may be seated paul says in galatians chapter 2 verse 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ that liveth in me the life which i now live in the flesh or in the animal part i live by the face of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me so in my animal life paul was saying in my flesh in my animal life is another person that my animal life is just a mask as most of you have one on here today except the mass that you are wearing is only partial covering your nose your face your mouth a big portion of your face but the real mask is not the blue the black the green whatever you have on today but the real mask is the animal body that contains the living god now whenever you all get done with service today i'm sure that most of you are so happy that you cannot wait to get outside that door and get in safe range and reach up there and pull that crazy thing off of your face is there anybody here that loves your mask is there anybody that wants to wear it even when it comes to a spot that they say we don't need to wear it anymore is there anybody here so in love with your mask that you simply want to wear it every day for the rest of your life really you know what puzzles me about that is that how come we don't feel that way about the bigger mask now the reason most of us do not like it is because it's inconvenient those of you that have the paper ones are the same way no doubt that i am the little threads and things start coming loose on the inside and the golden tickling your nose and you're sitting there rubbing your nose and you're breathing it in and out and some of you i've noticed on sunday morning that it's depriving your oxygen a little bit because some of you all are more sleepy than you've ever been in your life uh so that that's just part of it actually some of you look better with a mask on it hides that nose of yours but for the most part we just we just don't like them right because it's inconvenient but we become so accustomed to this mask here we simply love it we take up for it if anybody would hurt this mask's feelings now anybody could criticize our face mask and most of us would just laugh right with them if they would say boy that's a strange color or why you got that we just oh you know oh you know but boy if they say something to hurt this mass fields we won't speak to him for a week we'll get on facebook and we'll isn't it amazing how we treat this mask versus this one now why is it that we so dislike this face mask or whatever you've got up whether it's this deal up on your net and you pull it up whatever it is it's supposedly trying to help you stay healthy but this one here is actually an animal this one now at least the one you've got on your face i don't see anybody here this morning with a bobcat or a lynx or a tiger or a cat or a dog or anything like that on your face so it is either cotton or nylon polyester mix or a hundred percent cotton or a fabric that is supposed to be three-ply strong this one here has caused you more problems than that mask among your face has ever cast some people won't come to church because they got to wear this one but actually this one ain't the problem the other mask is the issue now paul had come to a great understanding that i hope god will help us to come to eventually we will to where that he realized that in his animal life there was no good thing that his animal life was a constant battle and he had to die to it every day it was the greatest pitfall of his christianity his animal life but he knew that he had received another person in his person another soul in his soul unlike the paschal lamb of the old testament or a dove or a pigeon or an ox or whatever it was that it was the atonement or the wave offering or the sheave offering none of them now they had animal life or botany life which was taken from them to be offered before the presence of god for the worshiper but yet none of those had a soul when god started with the lord forms of life and started with maybe the one cell amoeba and started creating the lower forms of life and kept coming higher and higher and higher and for many of them even in the oceans that he began with those in the lower form of life and had a very very small span of intelligence but god kept bringing it higher and higher up to the dolphins and to the whales and many of those that man is able to teach them various things to do but certain things of the animal life in the water world it's like they do not have the ability you could spend all of your life trying to teach some of them tricks and they'll never do it because they do not have the ability to learn same in the animal life some animals we can teach them you can take your dog or a cat or certain animals certain birds you can teach them to do certain tricks because the advancement of the intelligence in creation yet not one of them has a soul now what is this mysterious thing that human beings have which is called a soul poets wrote about it and have been writing thus for thousands of years people who have written songs have written songs about the soul even people that don't believe in god but what really is the soul now we talk about why my soul this and my so that and god bless your soul and your soul but actually what is the soul our problem is a soul problem when we're born into the world now we're born of course in animal life but actually the animal life in the beginning was not wrong and it was not bad actually when god created it and placed the soul man inside the animal life believe it or not for how many every years that it was it was in perfect harmony so the animal life itself was not sinful originally but it was the breaths of god that breathed into the body or the animal life now god of course made this man in his own image now listen to me carefully that god is a trinity just as you are so you are a soul a spirit and a body which is father son holy ghost and jesus now listen the trinity of god is not three beings it's not three gods but it is father soul or holy spirit which is baptism of the holy ghost son of god god is a spirit and then we have the body which is jesus so your soul is in a reflected image of father god your human spirit in a condescended form is in that mirror image of the holy spirit now what is the son of god i know it confuses people it shouldn't really but the son of god is not just the human body but this is why brother branham would say he was revealed in the church ages as son of god which was not flesh but spirit so what was son of god the condescension of the work of god the baptism of the holy ghost that was able to get into human hearts how many have the holy ghost today what is that son of god in spirit form now the lord jesus the body the human part does not live in our human part it is the son of god what was it son or numa spirit of the eternal condescended forms so the sonship was the way father broke down the ability for his children to have a portion of his own life this is the real son of god this is what people miss when they keep pointing to the man the body the sacrificial atonement hanging on the cross and that's all they identify as the son of god and they think all they need is the literal chemistry from the blood of what they're calling the son of god but the son of god is more than the human body the son of god is that portion of spirit that comes back to live inside of you now today i have in my body the embodiment of the son of god i don't have jesus eyes i don't have jesus nose i don't have jesus ears but that body is on the throne of god but i have today in my body and so do you that have the holy ghost you have what's in you the very life of the son of god himself so how is it the son of god it's that condescended form of god the eternal which could not live just in me or live just in you but in the form of sonship he was able to divide himself on the day of pentecost what's this i don't know if it's been a while since you've listened to this or not but it might be good to listen to it some folks are afraid to listen to it because it can be a little bit scary but it's a sermon entitled souls that are in prison now now we don't want to look so much at the prison part although that's certainly going on around us but to me brother branham and whenever he goes to dealing with the soul inside of this sermon that he god allows him to open up things about the soul and bring things together that he never quite said before quite like this listen to this in paragraph 36 now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul see the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit now remember we've been looking about the kenosis of the lamb of god so it was more than just him becoming a man it was more than him becoming a human being and it was not enough that he would become just a human being and give himself in a substitutionary work but he must give us something back that would eliminate our issue now if he came only as a substitution and died on the cross in my place and said well i i take donny's problems and truly i would be the epitome of the gospel of what people preach today is and that a person that is a person that believes on the work that the lord jesus did but he did not impart to me a life to overcome now this is the gospel that the majority of christians believe today that the lord jesus took their place the lord jesus died for them and he knows basically they're a hopeless cause still are and they'll never be able to live a godly life they'll never be able to live a life above sin so they go ahead and sin a little bit every day sometimes more on other days on the weekend you know you can send a little bit more and you can really majorly sin on vacation but then you've always got the blood the blood cleanses you and all that so that's the gospel the watered-down version of it that many people believe today that you cannot live a perfect life if you don't you're lost the bible tells us be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect look you are not going to heaven a flawed man or woman you will leave perfect or you don't leave and there's only way we can ever reach perfection and that is for the perfected one to come himself but not leave us a symbol or an idol as i said in my prayer that many have turned christianity into an idol so they made the lord jesus simply an idol the cross is an idol and a piece of idolatry that is used and worshipped to me the cross it's much more than that as a matter of fact when you go to reading the gospels if you haven't done it lately and you go to reading from romans and galatians and philippians and philemon and thessalonians and all of that down through there you will find that they refer to the cross but to them it was not just those two pieces of wood but it was the metaphoric symbol of what the cross stood for but today the substitute of that of course catholic church claimed they have one of it they've got 20 some different nails that they drove in his hands i'm not sure how that works since it was just three uh but yet you know what do they want they want a natural something to be able to say well saint so and so was here and saint so-and-so so you go into many of those places and i've been to different catholic places around the world and whenever you do every one of them have those icons well you know the word icon is a greek word it's a great word when you place it in its meaning of actually what it is paul used the greek word icon and he used this several times in his epistles but he used it in the way of revelation and that is an image so it was an image a supernatural image that god gave to me but man takes the word icon and man wants to make a symbol so he wants to set up something that people can come and look toward and they can touch it and they can rub it and they can look at it and somehow that that thing imparts to them some kind of power nonsense heathenism well praise the lord well brother donny don't you go to some of them places sure i've been in sabino canyon i've been wrong tired but brother stephen smith took me years ago whenever the angel the lord come down and cut down the tops of the trees i stood right there where it happened and you can stand there and still see them trees because they're cut off now you've got others that are grown up real tall and you can see where the presence of god come down and cut them i've been there i thank god for those places but i never worshiped the trees when i was there i never worshiped the ground when i was there praise the lord i worship the god who came there who is still alive praise the lord i've been to jeffersonville i've been to the tabernacle brother billy paul's took me through let me go right there to brother random's office go back there and set it to death i thank god for that sure it has something to love i don't worship the desk i don't worth to worship the chair that he set in praise the lord i don't worship any of those things i've been to jerusalem or jesus was or he walked down through there the via de la rosa all that i never worshiped the stones i never worshiped the place where they set his body laid i worshiped the god who brought him out of there right so to us then we do not want to become heathens and worship the wood of the cross or we don't want to worship the man who brought us the message of the hour we want to worship the god of the message of the hour now whenever we go to looking at what makes us different than a cow a horse a dog a pig wonder why you never see a bird bowed down before an idol now whether or not you know it birds do worship and cows worship and horses worship and whales worship and dolphins worship and leaves actually worship they must be really sad right now for a lot of them have already lost their leaves and they will rejoice in the spring because they get their leaves back and they clap their little hands right you see the stars of heaven they actually worship god animals worship god let every sing that hath breasts praise ye the lord but have you ever walked by and seen a dog bow down to a wooden idol have you ever bowed down and see a cow or a horse or a pig now we'd call a pig a dumb animal but have you ever seen a dumb animal like a pig making an idol out of their own body the way humans do you ever see a pig worship itself or a dog or a cat no all they know is survival and reproduce and eat and survive and reproduce and they live their life and they're done and you'll never see them on their own instinct bow down why because they do not have a soul now i know that maybe some of you will put a little outfit on your dog or a little outfit on your cat or this that other but you'll never see a dog do it on its own because a dog does not have a soul so a dog does not know uh about covering a cat does not know about covering but why is it that we human beings and our right mind that we put on clothes and we know of course in the beginning we did not need them but once we broke from the dispensation of innocence then we moved into the dispensation of conscience so then with that god made us so that we have a conscience which will begin to prick us when we're very young when we say things wrong do things wrong or you know just do something that we shouldn't do then that conscience not even being saved not even being born again every human being has it it's part of the affiliation of god giving us that soul so what is that soul well it starts out as the nature of the spirit the prophet said then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hid in god through christ sealed there by the holy spirit now it wasn't your body that died it wasn't your spirit that died it was the nature of your spirit dyed sea the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is god if you're born again now you see what god must must accomplish through the work of kenosis in order to bring us back that the nature of our spirit will die it cannot be our spirit because in our spirit is imagination conscience memory reason and affection it cannot be our body as as the great learned man and saint john 3 was told about being born again and he said how nicodemus trying to understand how can a man enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born again but jesus was relating to him how that the new birth was from the inside out so many of you here today that are born again this is actually what happened to you now listen the nature of your soul is god if you're born again watch him now he does not say the nature of your spirit but the nature of your soul so your soul initially was the nature of your spirit but when you become born again then your soul is the nature of god now none of us are born that way all of us are born lost right we are not born saved we are not born regenerate we are born lost in this lost status all we brought to the earth but then god wanted to bring us to this state to where we are saved or found notice it's not of the world anything that began has to end so therefore the only way you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin and then your life did begin when you were born when god brings the breath of life into your nostrils and you became a living soul then you begin then now this is the natural part this is the animal but how do we ever get born again and what part is it that actually gets born again now i hate to say it today but the truth of it is for many christians they're trying to save the old man it's sad really how many message people believe that how many message preachers believe him you'll never show me a one that don't understand predestination that's ever got the new birthright because what do you do every time he'll want to take that thing that you were born in and wants to save that wants to sanctify that and try to fill that with the holy ghost and there's only one hope for you to ever be born again and that is that part they're trying to save is killed and then something else is reborn in you which is what the deposit of the seed of god you can see why satan hates this teaching in the message but that's all right i'm going to teach it anyhow the more hell fights it the more i'm going to preach it now once he says the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead our lives are hidden in god through christ seal there by the holy spirit now it wasn't your body that died it wasn't your spirit that died it was the nature which is the soul now watch now remember the predestinated seed that god sowed in you when you come to the earth that predestinated seed was not the nature of your spirit that you were born in it's quite hard for you to be quiet today and listen don't bother me it is not the nature of your spirit that we're referring to that deposit that god breathed into you the breath of life was nothing to do with your father or your mother it was nothing to do with you it was the deposit of eternal life god himself but now you cannot have two natures two souls in you that are alive and dominating at the same time but you can have the nature of your spirit which you were born with and it will yield to your first husband and that first husband will rule over you and the other one the seed of god will lay in you in a state of dormant it'll be dormancy and it will never it'll never be quickened it'll never come alive it cannot be because you would be deformed to have two souls in you at the same time well praise the lord so it will lay there for years for decades however long until god can get the nature of your spirit to reason together with him the lord now once he said the nature of your soul is god if you're born again and if it's not it's all of the world anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way you can ever have eternal life is to have a light that never did begin now watch this in paragraph 37 that nature that was in you that nature you was of the world alienated from god that's exactly right actually an animal ah actually an animal anyone knows that we are now not that we were oh yes i was an animal before i become born again you're still one after you're born again but you're not an animal in your soul any longer now can you imagine if we'd be able to go to africa and catch a big lion and somehow would be able to go inside of that lion and find his nature and we would be able to take the nature out of that lion and we would take a sami's cat or we'd take your favorite house cat that is nature so mild and so gentle if there is such a thing in the house cat anyway now if we could be able to find that in the cat and be able to take this nature out of the house cat and put it inside this this black main line from africa and whenever he wakes up now he comes to himself and he begins to yawn and he wakes up and he looks around and here's impala that are standing by him and over here are jim's buck and over here are zebra and all kinds of things that are all around him which would have been appetizer breakfast lunch but now he looks at him and he says meow and we would look at that line and say what in the world instead of him getting out to oh you know that thing they do they know i don't like them and every time i get in round one they go straight to my legs looking up at me i say i'm not the only one they did that to it would be a marvel of science now this same line might have been brought up and taught not to kill and not to do this and that but the primate nature inside of that lion will do it this is why that they will turn on people that's that's been my you know been trainers and guides and so on and we hear about it all the time and they mauled them and they've done this and that and the other why because that nature is still in them but yet somehow we were able to go inside of there and actually help that lion have a new birth so he gets up and he shakes that black mane and he walks around and them impala they take off 90 miles an hour everything around him runs off and he said what's the matter i'm changed i'm not who i used to be that second generation impala was thinking you ate my mama you expect me to believe that right you ain't my grandpa you ate my third cousin my uncle so and so and so do you think he's gonna trust him it's gonna take a long time some way when we really become born again why because we're still living in this outer shell but god hallelujah god took the animal nature out of the soul and put the nature of jesus christ inside of us but we're still dealing with the roaring part now you see those of you that have the holy ghost you've got that little lamb on the inside boy he don't never get mad he don't never get all upset and frustrated amen but you got that line on the outside and he loves to roar oh he loves to scare people and he loves to intimidate or whatever more well you all don't understand what i'm talking about this morning oh how wonderful it would have been that the lord jesus wanted in his purpose to be able to totally eradicate the lion that i live in and made me a complete lamb but that was not his plan notice this the prophet said you see what made us different from other mammals let me go back here at the top of this paragraph read it again anyone knows that we are mammal how many knows that we are mammal we are warm blooded animal now don't raise your hands but i wonder how many folks here today fight temper don't raise your hand those of you out on the internet you either wonder how many folks fight temper and you on the occasion lose that temper and you say things you wish you wouldn't have said and most of the time when we're upset and angry we pick the sharpest cutting words we can find because we intend to hurt with them we want to make our point boy ain't nobody pushing me around bless god sit down in line and shut up that line of yours is going to get you in a heap of trouble well praise the lord now god put a soul in this animal life but yet i'm still a mammal i'm still an animal on the outside watch the way he relates this he says that what see what made us different from other mammals that god put a soul upon us now other mammals don't have to wear clothes no other mammal has to wear clothes to hide his shame but us we're the only ones that does because we have a soul but see god in the beginning knew what man would be like he created the earth and brought up all kinds of animals from the very lowest to the highest and the highest animal come forth was man don't you see what your body change is going to be finally change your animal life now here is this dove of the holy ghost this lamb of the holy ghost living inside of a wolverine or a pit bull for some of you or a donkey for some of you just depending on how your nature now listen you know as well as i know there are dog raisers here in the building today and they raised them professionally or you think that an animal now a mammal you got the same mother and the same father then why would them dogs or cats or whatever more wind up with a different nature now i've had a lot of different horses in my life and you know the breed of the horse has a lot to do with the horse but the horse itself also has an individuality about it same with dogs cats anything else and you say how how does that all come about that every one of them from the gene pool are not exactly identical so here you've got two dogs and they're brothers and yet one of them will be you know one way and the other will be another way one almost the best dog ever was and one of them ain't worth a lollipop i ain't got enough sense to get in and out of the rain i mean he's got a pedigree that llama don't do no good he can't read it he don't know what it's even for but you say what in the world well it's the grab bag of the way the gna and the dna or the genes brother comes out through the dna and then what you say many of us want to attribute our animal nature and stuff about our human makeup as being god-given no much of our nature is a higher form of dog life that's why in the family look i'm the oldest of seven so i know a little bit about variety i know a little bit about how from the same mother and from the same father can come different brothers men harry well we see a lot of things a lot but there's different makeup still between us and our human part our brother brother jamie and our sisters that we have and yet every one of us i'm glad it's that way i wouldn't want everybody to be like me and then i'm scared to death i might wind up being like somebody else well praise god now think about it then look at us whenever we are mammal and the same mother the same father and yet every one of us the outcome of our dna our genes and so on and we'll be able to send it off to 23 and me and they could go back how many ever generations and say well your uncle was so and so way back down on the pioneer days and oh my they've done this and that and the other but yet you might become the nature of one way behind you back here the prophet said that a family will have a child and it'll be born red-headed nobody in the family they know of is red-headed but yet that seed keeps passing right on down maybe the third generation back fourth generation back and here that seed comes out in the natural park well friends one of the worst things we can allow satan to do to us is convince us that our mammal ishmael is isaac the promised son you see if he cannot keep you away from god then he will try to convince you that much of your natural makeup is god-given then why would god anoint preachers to preach against our natural makeup that's wrong if god made us to be this way and then send preachers to preach against us what kind of god are you serving what kind of god do we have if god is so pleased with every one of our humanity our temper our anger and whatever more that we have the greatest enemy that we have in our life as our mammal makeup and yet god is so pleased with her brother lester god said well i don't want you to change well why in the world do i need to preach that why in the world do we need a bible unless god is telling us look you got that out of the human grab bag that's what the prophet called it the human grab bag and god sends his word and god sends the ministry to preach to us that we from the soul of the lamb will bring the outside body of the lion the donkey the pig the hog the bird you know whatever you are well hallelujah some of y'all got a peacock nature because you're all the time standing around fluffing your favors and want everybody to see how beautiful you are and you're so purity and you're just god's gift to all the women of the world you serpent thing you well hallelujah there ain't no peacocks in the economy of god there ain't no hogs in the economy of god there are sons and daughters of god the hogs is the body we're packing around the dogs are the bodies that we're packing around oh jesus notice this he says then after he done made man in his own image he created the male and female there was no man to till the soil and he put him in the dust of the earth and therefore he was that man so the first man was a man of genesis 1. then there was the man of genesis 2. and then there was the promised man of genesis 3. so the man of genesis 1 26 was the spirit man but he placed that spirit man into a body of mammal animal flesh and emerged him inside that body so here he is the highest form of animal life why god wanted the man which is going to lead the animals to bear the image of the animals he would lead so if a man dies a woman dies a baby dies the dog dies a lion dies an elephant dies all these things die they all lay out on the on the sand somewhere and they lay there and they rot and they go back to the dust of the earth does man's dust have gold in it is man's death so supernatural and so wonderful let it lay there long enough and you will not be able to differentiate between the two between a billionaire or a dog why because the body goes right back to the dust of the earth it will rot come on saints you might as well say amen it will rot and go right back to the dust of the earth oh but if you've got that soul in there come from god amen notice this this human was mammal see he was animal he put this spirit of god ah put the spirit of god alive into him so here the first son of god stepped into an animal body a son of god stepped into an animal body and the body is standing there with his toes down into the into the dirt and like the roots of a tree and he's standing now with no life yet he has the mechanics of sinews and bones and cells and tissues and eyes and muscles and all of that but nothing is moving nothing is a lie and what does god do god breathes into him a type of the holy ghost god breathed into him the first son of god amen and when he received that son of god inside of him his eyes began to bat his heart kicked in for the first time his blood pressure started going up all the mechanics of his body started moving now it was divine life merged into animal life can't you see why god is going to perform reconciliation and redemption god must come down and live in a body also like mammal he must live in a body that is like his wife he must live in a body that is like his creation oh my notice now how the prophet goes into this about god bringing us to a new birth but that soul that's in their sea that soul is what god is working on see if he can get that nature that spirit to agree with him then that nature dies now this is what happens when you started feeling something moving on you whether it was in a church in a barn in a bar stool wherever it was and the spirit of god started moving on your heart and you felt something pulling you this is what was going on god was moving on that nature of your spirit that you was born with this is why you might have got emotional you might have got scared you might have started crying you might have felt fear trauma what was it death was moving near your nature praise speak to god death was moving near your nature that you were born with and it frightens you it alarms you because you never felt anything like it before in your life and even though you were not exactly sure what was going on it was an alarm to you something began to move in you inside of you oh god oh god please forgive me lord i'm so wrong i'm so wrong god please have mercy god let me die right here lord well if you really meant that the spirit of god took the life of your old nature if he can only get that nature that spirit to agree with him then thy nature god friend you're talking about a miracle the new birth is one of the greatest miracles you'll ever experience that god could actually get your nature your sinful nature to agree agree to what to die then that nature dies the nature and the love of the world you see friends while folks are missing the new birth well i accept the lord jesus says my savior i'll quit drinking i'll quit smoking i'll quit running around i'll quit i'll quit i'll quit all quickly and many of them do but then they go to feeding the craving the desire the hunger and they go back to doing the same things they've done before and worse why they never let that nature come together with god and god killed that nature and that nature be annihilated forever if you're ever born again you will never ever ever have the nature of the world inside you again is totally impossible so notice what happens if it could only get that nature that spirit to agree with him then that nature that what a marvel how does god talk that nature into agreeing with him then that nature does the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead oh people say well this didn't oh this bothers me and this bothered me that's that's not your problem the problem is the love for those things if there was no love no love no hunger no thirst for those things they could be around you they could live next door to you look friend oh brother donnie oh i i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna start a petition and i'm gonna see if we can burn all the cigarette factory smoking bother me all of my life the cigarette factories don't need to be burned what we need to do is burn out that sin nature in your soul little brother if you live right in the middle of winston-salem north carolina and there was a tobacco process place there and winston was over there and salem was over there and camel was over there and all the rest of them was all around you walk right down the middle and say glory to god he set me free why you got your mask on that old tobacco smell it don't bother you no more we don't need to send a torch lighter down there to burn up the bars and the honky tonk but we need our nature annihilated notice he said if you love the world the things of the world the love of god it's not in you it's so simple it's so it's so simple when the love of the world which is identified with that worldly nature is in there it's the king of your being so the love of god and the love of the world cannot be on the same heart it cannot be in the same throne room they cannot occupy together god will not share his throne with anyone else but notice what happens when a person is born again they may shout they may not they may cry they may jump who knows what they'll do at the instant that it happens but within them that very moment brother jim when they die and that nature of the world dies inside of them listen to me carefully they are standing there soulless oh god for a moment for a second the leader of their being is not dead so god must quicken the seed which is the real soul so if your soul is the nature of your spirit when you're born i wonder who your new nature the soul you have now wonder whose nature of whose spirit it is glory be to god if your soul was the nature of your spirit and god had that nature to reason with him and it died then god quickens that seed and burst that seed inside of you your new nature then who is the new nature of your soul the almighty then you are born again born again there's really been a change in me i got born again just like jesus said hallelujah hallelujah i'm talking about coming up and shaking the preacher's hand i'm talking about putting your name on a book i'm talking am i just grabbing a tape and memorizing brother madame's voice i'm talking about god you and god meeting in the judgment room don't you understand what happened that your soul met god and god annihilated that nature hallelujah and in a moment of time he breathed the breath of life into that predestinated seed that he deposited in you when you were born and then the line wakes up you imagine going to sleep everything in the jungle shuts up and you wake out of a nap and you get ready to do it again oh what's happened to me born again it's actually actually new births can be will be and should be very humiliating because you'll never be able to express your greatness again your royal highness you will be known among the lions as the pansy the weakling the house cat oh it used to be like the best of us he could drink that vodka he could drink old jim crow or turkey or daniels or whatever his name is man a lot i've seen him kill one after another smoke marijuana take pills and everything you know what he does now for fun goes to church and gets whooped on he goes to church and gets swooped on and he wants me to go with him can you imagine me going out there to that crazy church and letting them not head preacher beat on me no way well he's he's apparently he's absolute weakling praise god praise god you're proud of the very thing you should be ashamed of and you're ashamed of the very thing you should be proud of you ought to be proud that you're not like you used to be you ought to be so thankful to god so this nature has to die and the nature of god comes and lives in you and god is the only thing that it is that never did begin or never did end this is why it confuses folks even in the message well but never hear brother branham said there's only one form of eternal life and that was you you of course in your original state me and my original state i was part of god can it go on just a little bit so therefore he has partnership you see and taken this man earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together because god reflected himself back in that that he become a man when he become christ jesus and he was god see god was in christ that lived in him reconciling the world to himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect that belief in god has accepted that becomes the perfection of him well but brother don't know i pay my that's that's good but that's not the way you become perfect you become perfect by accepting his perfection what's this in jehovah john in 1964 then god created man out of the dust of the earth and made him in the form of an animal and y'all ever skinned a seen a bare skin out a bear since paul it's amazing how much look like a human it's amazing the different parts of animals that you look at human beings unless you really know what you're looking at you think it's a human part why god made the image reflect from the animal kingdom right inside the head of the race man so when the men christ jesus come on the earth his hair looked like air hair his eyes look like our eyes his hands look like our hands but he come carrying the soul of god the embodiment of god to release his soul we're mammal that's warm blooded animal we're in that image of animal life that's your ishmael question answer is 1964 in human is an animal the man the flesh part notice where he puts the tents not was is animal flesh we know that we are mammals so don't get mad at me for saying brother branham was brother branham said he himself was an animal a mammal which is warm-blooded animal we know that but what makes a difference the animal does not have the inward soul but the human does he don't know right from wrong friends can't you see when the spirit of god is off of human beings look out here look out here at our race look out here at our generation look at the time they're in people are doing things we never thought possible for a human being to do take the spirit of god off of a man he's lower than a bear he's lower than a hog he's lower than a dog come on friends there won't be no dogs in hell think about it there'll be no animals in hell why they cannot sin they will never be thrown into the lake of fire no they cannot sin but think of the human beings the height of the animals why will they be in hell because they have a soul to know right from wrong and the spirit of god moves on that nature trying to get it to die and they say no no i'm not ready i'm not ready i don't want to leave me alone god that decision will haunt them for the ages aren't you glad one day god helped you to accept that let's stand together i got way too much to go on into let's stop you see the truth of it is this the all nature is so vile and so corrupt it can never be redeemed it could never be sanctified and the new nature is so sinless it don't need to be sanctified because it is your own representation from the presence of god what is the work of sanctification that goes on in us it ain't your soul it's your body this is why in future homie tells us that a person comes to justification and then they move to sanctification and it sets your mind toward holiness so whenever you're getting sanctified what are you doing you're taking these clothes out of your cause you're getting rid of this music you're doing this why because it caters to this so the state of sanctification bears over on the life that you live every day praise god because the soul once the soul gets the holy ghost do we maintain our sanctification we do we still live a sanctified separate lie why you can't trust this animal they're either one of us here friends that if we let our flesh do whatever it wants to do we'll be in a mess of trouble including the pastor deacons trustees song leader everybody here your flesh is an animal quit catering to it quit babying it quit accepting it as the promised seed it is your enemy not your friend that's power he is oh my lord jesus i pray today father that you would help us i know we've covered a lot of territory may they ruminate lord maybe they go back and they listen to a time or two or three or four or whatever lord if there's one standing here today they've accepted you as their savior and all of it's been from a mental standpoint but really their nature has never reasoned and agreed with you and there as it reasoned you took its life on the altar then lord god you breathed into that seed the breath of life no wonder the prophet could say you never sinned in the first place i used to listen to that invisible union lord and i i just i miss the point i missed the point of what he was saying whenever he'd say if you heard i got drunk and i've done all these evil things and then you found out i didn't do it and then you'd say brother branham i forgive you and he said forgive me i never did it in the first place lord we realize many of us what we've looked at the new births is that old man that old nature we go up to the altar and they beat us on the back or whatever more and you forgive that on nature we try to bring that old nature in line we bring him to church we try to put into sanctification that ain't your process at all you ain't trying to save that old man you want to kill him help us oh jesus thank you for my new person lord god i thank you for all i've seen you do i'm one little bitty old tiny guy that's done hardly nothing for you but yet lord i can say i've seen you do such miraculous things as far as healings i've seen you lord god do many tremendous things and i appreciate all of that but lord the greatest miracle to this date is me being born again no doubt many of those people that i've prayed for that you performed a miracle on they'll get sick again and no doubt many of them are already died but lord god that miracle of the new birth can never die praise god help us here today lord jesus maybe get a true understanding the new birth is not trying to save and sanctify and put the holy ghost in that old man the holy ghost won't go in that old man he's got today to die and make room for the new man no wonder the prophet said a soul of god that was in god so what i was born with was not that part that was in god it was the nature of my spirit being crossbred between satan and eve oh lord thank you jesus i don't i'm not even sure lord when it was it really did that i know you changed me that night down at the altar that little hole in this church something happened to me now i know lord when i went up and prayed for the holy ghost i know something happened to me but lord i was still so wrong not sure lord if it's when i come to the message after i come to the message what tape us listen to what sermon i share i don't know but all i know is i'm not the same man i was and i was in pentecost thank you lord jesus i appreciate it lord with all of my heart lord god may your breath glory to god may your breasts come through this place today those that are out streaming no matter where they'd be around the world may the breaths of god pass through those saints there in france those in australia those in new zealand those in canada different parts of the world different time zones i'll listen to it today lord god while we're praying together may the breath of god come through that little hut in africa that place lord god where they're sitting there maybe in a library because they don't have internet in their home may the breath of god pass through that cafe hallelujah embarrass that black man sitting there lord god that black woman that indian lord god in madras wherever they live lord jesus we call upon your mighty name may you open up this lion this donkey this prideful peacock that you put us to sleep as it were and when we wake we'll not awaken our pride but that peacock will awake in genuine humility that donkey that went to sleep so stubborn and so hard-headed nobody could ever tell them nothing but they'll awake with a lamb nature or they'll still deal with that old donkey part but now they've got a power to bring it subject praise god help us jesus granted lord thank you father o breaths of god come through this place today breathe on us lord lord god some have already experienced that breast of the new birth but they're needing the breath of healing the breath of peace our nation has such turmoil our world and sets turmoil lord you see what the scientists are saying about our pandemic of them not thinking it's going to get better for a while but it's going to get worse lord god may you pass through this place another where your children are gathered and breathes peace upon our hearts lord god hallelujah hallelujah healing deliverance whatever we have need of today father god we worship you lord jesus thank you heavenly father can we just take a few minutes friends just to worship him a little bit we've got a little sister that's going to be baptized to dave by the way they'll come prepare for that listen what what brother branham said let me read to you brother jump over to the lamb and the dove just a couple pages over if you want to be a christian just ask christ he will take your old nature out and put a new nature in then you don't have to impersonate anything it's just your normal life that you're living as long as you've got malice envy and strife and all these things in the world then you know christ isn't there look people think the things of the world are just drinking smoking dope popping pills look friends when you have envy and strife and hatred that preceded smoking that was before there was ever one drop of alcohol being worldly and having worldly things in you is not just drinking and smoking and committing adultery on your wife notice this if you love the world the things of the world the love of god's not even in you see because the life of god is in he the life is in there it just produces itself it just lives its way out let me read one more in hebrews your old nature died the nature of the world and you become a new creation so you imagine that was a death and a birth almost at the same time look at the time we're living in people dying all around us and births happening every day people are dying and people are being born that's the miracle of the new birth that your nature dies and once it's dead and about the speed of a twinkling of an eye maybe your new nature your new person is resurrected praise god sing waters on your heart praise god oh jesus draw me yes me let it fade away fade away jesus closer lord to you let this world oh jesus zoe chandler i got to meet his family for the service and the chandler's been coming here for a couple of years now and uh if you haven't met them you want to take the time to meet them real saints god very humble sweet people sister zoe has the fortune of having a family that prays together and uh sister zoe is a very very shy very sober-minded young lady and she has a very sincere spirit about her she had been praying and the lord had been working on her end and her father had come here to pray with her he just prayed that you know she get the desire to be baptized to take the lord's name and baptism and at that same time she responded i love to see it when the lord's working opinions with the parents and friends and the children of greatness it's a real blessing a blessing all right thank you lord jesus is all the hands of my sister we know that acts 2 37 38-39 are the the condition and the prescription and the and the healing all in one lord the promise is there for those who will receive so my sister has come with a profession of faith and a repentance and i baptize her now in the name of the lord jesus christ thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus oh praise god aren't you glad you're born again born again the miracle of the new birth the mysterious soul in your body which now belongs to god remember father son holy ghost your soul your spirit your body the merging together of the mystery of god the same with you your soul now being born again your spirit will be replaced with your theophany in the body change and your animal mammal body will be changed into a body like unto his own glorious body and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is the lord jesus body you imagine there in the tomb he wasn't just brought back to life but he was changed he died a 33 year old man but he looked like 50 but that was not the raised body that martha saw that mary saw that the disciples saw he was changed back to a young man you imagine that body is the image of what one day we will be no longer bearing the image of animal praise god but soul attribute of god theophany

and the rapture will take place our bodies will be transformed into spoken word bodies therefore if you have died and entered into the theophany what happens you bring the theophany you bring the
