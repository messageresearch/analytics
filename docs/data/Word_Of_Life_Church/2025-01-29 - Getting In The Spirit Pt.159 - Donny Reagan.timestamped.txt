[39:17] seed for yourself and us doing the
[39:21] things that are right that you're not
[39:23] just sewing that seed for you as a
[39:27] matter of fact I may not get to it
[39:28] tonight but the prophet of God said that
[39:32] you parents you live right and influence
[39:35] your children right it can influence
[39:38] your
[39:39] children and your grandchildren
[39:42] yes and then he quotes scripture for it
[39:46] whenever Abraham paid tithes to
[39:51] mzc but yet it was attributed to
[39:55] Levi and Levi was only a SE Gene in
[39:59] Abraham's
[40:01] loins it a't one of the devil don't want
[40:03] us to do good things is
[40:05] it Proverbs
[40:09] 16:28 a forward
[40:12] man
[40:13] Seth
[40:16] strife and a
[40:20] Whisperer
[40:22] separateth Chief
[40:26] friends now I know this is not very deep
[40:29] and I realize that for a lot of folks if
[40:31] you're not screaming seven Thunders and
[40:34] you know that sort of thing that think
[40:35] you're not preaching the message but I
[40:38] wonder sometimes myself if we would
[40:40] maybe spend a little bit more time
[40:42] reading this Bible and finding out
[40:44] what's in it we'd be a whole lot better
[40:47] people let's read that again a forward
[40:51] man
[40:52] Seth Strife so this is what a forward
[40:56] man does
[40:58] so this is a man of
[40:59] contention a man who's a troublemaker so
[41:03] a forward man
[41:06] Seth
[41:08] strife and a
[41:10] Whisperer
[41:12] separateth Chief friends now Galatians
[41:16] 6:
[41:19] 7 be not
[41:21] deceived God is Not
[41:24] mocked for whatsoever man
[41:28] Seth that shall he also
[41:32] reap for he that Seth to his
[41:36] flesh shall of the flesh reap
[41:42] corruption so never remember we're
[41:44] talking about Christians
[41:47] non-christians denominational people
[41:50] message people because we all fit into
[41:53] that particular category and the way
[41:56] that Paul is writing wring in here it's
[41:58] not well this is only sinners now
[42:00] Christians can do whatever they want to
[42:01] do this law don't apply to them no it
[42:04] actually applies to us as a matter of
[42:07] fact you'll find the prophet telling us
[42:09] I think it was Christ's mystery in July
[42:12] maybe July 28 63 something like that
[42:15] whenever he talks about coming back into
[42:18] the valley there in
[42:20] Jeffersonville and he said as soon as he
[42:22] would enter in the valley it would
[42:24] become real spooky and dark
[42:28] and he would break out in
[42:30] hives and he said the reason was because
[42:35] he still made it hard on him because he
[42:38] didn't go out the first time when God
[42:41] meant for him
[42:43] to so here is a prophet that has lived
[42:45] all of these years after that initial
[42:49] failure by listening to his
[42:51] mother-in-law instead of listening to
[42:52] God and he's still dealing with that
[42:56] thing
[42:58] makes you want to se good seed don't
[43:00] it for he that
[43:02] Seth to his flesh so your flesh is a
[43:06] garden and the will of God is another
[43:08] Garden which is your partakers of your
[43:11] soul so he that Seth to his flesh shall
[43:16] of the flesh so we can't sow to the
[43:19] Flesh and reap from the soul neither can
[43:24] we sow to the soul and reap corruption
[43:27] from the flesh so the seed itself is not
[43:31] the only part that we need to look at
[43:34] but where we sew it so we could take the
[43:37] message scripture study you know
[43:39] religious things great things that are
[43:42] principles of the truth and seow them to
[43:45] the
[43:45] Flesh and it still is not what we need
[43:50] we need to make our flesh obey yes but
[43:52] the seed needs to be sown in our soul
[43:56] remember I'm talking about the woman at
[43:57] the well spoken words Original Seed and
[44:00] he said that that woman I'm sorry not
[44:03] the woman at the well but Mary and he
[44:04] said that Mary said that my mother or
[44:08] her mother was O blind an Anna and she
[44:13] said my mother placed a seed in my heart
[44:19] from her
[44:20] lips to help her to believe that word
[44:24] now remember he's not talking about
[44:26] predestinated see cuz we can't do that
[44:29] but her mother planted a seed of the
[44:32] promised word of her day in her heart
[44:37] and she waited and waited and waited and
[44:40] that seed actually of the word god used
[44:44] her mother to be able to do it oh my for
[44:48] he that sth to his flesh shall love the
[44:51] flesh reap corruption but he that Seth
[44:54] to the spirit now this is a new
[44:56] testament Greek word which is Numa which
[44:58] is where we get pneumatics and different
[45:00] things like that from but it is the
[45:03] spirit of God it's not just human Spirit
[45:05] but it is the spirit of God you notice
[45:07] it's capital letter but he that Seth to
[45:10] the spirit shall of the spirit reap life
[45:14] Everlasting let me read this quote to
[45:16] you that I read to you last Wednesday
[45:17] night but you reap what you sow just be
[45:22] aware of that
[45:23] people whether you are a nation or a
[45:27] church or an individual you reap what
[45:32] you s let's look at it again but you
[45:35] reap what you sow just be aware of that
[45:38] people whether you are a nation or a
[45:42] church or an individual you reap what
[45:45] you s now you and I may not comprehend
[45:49] this to the fullest extent yet of what
[45:52] the devil already knows about this
[45:54] law you see the devil understands if he
[45:58] can get one
[45:59] generation in the 20s to start sewing
[46:04] about the flappers y'all remember the
[46:06] flappers what the flappers were in the
[46:09] 20s and the 30s the devil knew if he
[46:12] could get the flappers sewn in the
[46:16] 20s then the strip tees and the
[46:18] Hollywood would come on in the Next
[46:21] Generation and then the next generation
[46:23] and we're blaming on the devil and in
[46:25] one sense of course it is the devil but
[46:27] the devil knows human beings will
[46:30] actually help fulfill his
[46:33] program because he gives it to them and
[46:36] they sew it and do these things but
[46:39] Satan knows they don't but Satan knows
[46:42] that what comes out of them and so and
[46:45] their children will be worse in the Next
[46:49] Generation Now notice what he says that
[46:53] whether you're a nation or a church or
[46:55] an individual you reap what you sell
[46:59] let's pray together Heavenly Father we
[47:00] thank you tonight for your word dear God
[47:03] I pray you would open our hearts to it
[47:05] tonight Lord Jesus teach us father we're
[47:08] here at your table tonight we've come
[47:10] hungry Lord I'm so happy to be in church
[47:13] tonight I love going to church I love
[47:15] singing I love worshiping I love praying
[47:18] we love hearing the preaching of the
[47:19] word to speak to us tonight father shut
[47:21] my mouth to anything that would
[47:23] displease you I pray in Jesus name amen
[47:26] amen God bless you you may be
[47:29] seated we know that much of what the new
[47:32] birth does by the Regeneration of the
[47:34] soul and it every potential of
[47:37] everything that you'll ever be is in
[47:40] that seed when it's born by the Breath
[47:43] of God if you haven't listened to
[47:44] Blasphemous names yet in 1962 you hear
[47:47] the prophet talking about that that the
[47:49] Church of the Living God is actually
[47:51] born by the breast of God so all of your
[47:55] potential spiritually are in that seed
[47:58] once it becomes born again some of it
[48:01] may take years for it to develop some of
[48:04] it may be right before you're passing
[48:06] from this Earth that it'll finally be
[48:08] developed in that last stage and as a SE
[48:11] my open comments that what we want to
[48:14] find is that balance in our life and in
[48:16] our walk with god with the part that
[48:19] we're supposed to do and then the part
[48:22] the ministry is supposed to do for us
[48:25] and then the part the spirit of God
[48:27] living in us will do and all of it
[48:30] contributes together and makes this
[48:33] beautiful beautiful plan that God has
[48:35] ordained for each of our lives and us
[48:38] being able to separate between all of
[48:41] that now there's certain things that you
[48:43] will need in your walk with God that you
[48:45] will not be able to provide for yourself
[48:49] that's why God give you a pastor and
[48:51] then there'll be other things that God
[48:53] will send in evangelists visiting
[48:56] ministers and they'll come and speak for
[48:58] us and they'll go down a certain Avenue
[49:00] and you say oh praise the Lord that was
[49:03] just exactly what I needed I never heard
[49:06] that before in my life I just preached
[49:08] it to you three weeks before that but I
[49:11] said it in a different way than the way
[49:13] the visiting Minister did and it was
[49:16] exactly the way you needed to hear it
[49:18] and then you got something out of that
[49:20] service now you could have studied you
[49:22] could have listened to tapes every day
[49:25] and and you get things out of them yet
[49:26] yes but God has allocated a certain
[49:29] element of it to come through the
[49:31] five-fold ministry it's just his plan
[49:33] and then there's an element of it that
[49:35] if you will listen to the tapes and
[49:37] you'll be aware of what the men of God
[49:39] are preaching if they're really
[49:41] preaching the message that is then
[49:43] whenever you hear that you say I just
[49:45] heard that I just heard that yesterday
[49:47] oh yes praise the Lord and I had this
[49:49] question about it Oh Praise You Lord oh
[49:51] thank you Lord it really really helped
[49:53] me well you see if you had not been
[49:55] listening to that then that have been an
[49:57] element of it that you wouldn't have got
[49:59] so you do your part preacher does his
[50:02] part Holy Ghost does his part Evangel as
[50:05] his and then all of that brings every
[50:07] one of us into this stature of what God
[50:10] wants us to be now then there's a
[50:13] negative side about this these Divine
[50:16] virtues that are in Us by the spirit of
[50:19] God God once they are there God will
[50:23] allow us to be Tried by
[50:27] circumstances sometimes people and he
[50:30] will let us see where we are on the
[50:33] growth chart now all of you parents know
[50:37] when I was a child I I don't remember
[50:39] ever being measured I never did hard to
[50:41] ever go to the doctor whenever I was a
[50:42] child anyway but I mean I've took my
[50:44] granddaughter's son and see them do the
[50:47] growth chart and they'll say Well
[50:48] they're above you know they're above the
[50:50] N9 percentile or whatever more yeah
[50:53] they're right in that certain certain
[50:55] thing well what do they do that for well
[50:56] they want to weigh your child they want
[50:59] to be able to get their height and this
[51:01] and that and be able to tell you where
[51:03] they are poor bless her heart she was
[51:05] always a runt she was always under never
[51:08] did grow up past that she was always
[51:10] well beneath it but she had a lot of
[51:12] character to make up for what she lacked
[51:14] in Heights so that's the way we are when
[51:17] it comes spiritually we go to the house
[51:19] of God and then the men of God anointed
[51:22] by the spirit of God they'll begin to
[51:23] lay out the chart and the chart of
[51:25] course the the ultimate example on the
[51:28] chart is the Lord Jesus and then they
[51:30] begin to lay out and the spirit of God
[51:33] will individualize and convict our
[51:35] hearts and say Lord I'm short of this
[51:37] and I'm short of that what's God trying
[51:40] to do he's trying to show us where we
[51:42] are on the percentile now there might be
[51:45] some ahead of you there might be some
[51:47] behind you and there might be some
[51:48] that's equal to you but no matter where
[51:50] you are don't be discouraged and think
[51:53] you'll never make it yes if God has
[51:55] started that work in you he will perform
[51:58] it to the day of Jesus Christ and the
[52:01] church said now when we think about some
[52:04] of the things then that we can do and
[52:06] remember the terminology is so important
[52:09] in the Bible and if you'll be really
[52:11] careful when you Le read it and ask the
[52:13] spirit of God as you're reading your
[52:15] Bible reading the message book listen to
[52:17] it tap whatever it is that God will open
[52:19] your understanding let's read now if you
[52:21] would in Ephesians 4:30 let's look at
[52:24] some more seeds now that this spirit of
[52:27] God is going to give us the admonition
[52:29] tonight that we will have to seow grieve
[52:33] not the holy spirit of God whereby ye
[52:36] are sealed until the day of redemption I
[52:40] want you to notice Paul is writing to
[52:43] people with the Holy Ghost so a person
[52:46] without the Holy Ghost cannot grieve the
[52:50] spirit of God the way a person with the
[52:53] Holy Ghost can Oh you mean brother
[52:55] Donnie people with the Holy Ghost
[52:57] we will make mistakes and fall short of
[52:58] the glory of God well if they can't Paul
[53:01] wrote a lie in Ephesians 4:30 how many
[53:04] believes you got the Holy Ghost how many
[53:06] of you know that you've grieved the
[53:07] spirit of God before and you've had to
[53:09] repent and make it right sure spirit of
[53:11] God called brother Bram alar you're
[53:13] going to say brother B didn't have the
[53:15] Holy Ghost you're dumber than I am I
[53:17] ain't going to say no such thing but yet
[53:19] there's something that a child of God
[53:21] can grieve it a sinner can't grieve the
[53:23] Holy Ghost like that he's not inside of
[53:26] them even a Sanctified person can't
[53:28] grieve the spirit of God the way someone
[53:31] with the Holy Ghost does grieve not the
[53:33] holy spirit of God now who's this
[53:35] speaking to it ain't speaking to the
[53:37] Holy Ghost it ain't speaking to the
[53:39] pastor it's speaking to the individuals
[53:42] who have the Holy Ghost so who can
[53:44] grieve your portion of the Holy Ghost
[53:48] only you who can grieve my portion only
[53:51] me brother Paul who can grieve your
[53:53] portion brother Rob only brother Rob so
[53:56] G grieve not the holy spirit of God
[53:58] whereby ye are sealed until the day of
[54:02] redemption let all bitterness now once
[54:05] in the Avenue that Paul chooses to go
[54:08] here I Believe by the spirit of God so
[54:10] he's going to give us examples of what
[54:13] people can do to grieve the spirit of
[54:16] God let all bitterness and wrath and
[54:21] anger and clamor and evil speaking be
[54:26] put away from you now why would he tell
[54:30] the people that because the spirit of
[54:32] God is not going to do this now I can
[54:35] tell you what you need to do but I can't
[54:38] do it for you the your Sunday school
[54:41] teachers the youth leaders all of that
[54:43] deacons trustees no every fold of the
[54:46] ministry could tell you but they cannot
[54:49] do it for you so you're the only one in
[54:51] your own walk with God that can take
[54:54] these things and put them come away from
[54:57] you now the spirit of God will help you
[54:59] because some of these things are
[55:01] tough some of these things are tough now
[55:04] let all bitterness look at this word
[55:07] it's a strange word it's p so it is
[55:11] bitter G or a Bitter Root and so
[55:16] producing a bitter fruit that's
[55:19] equivalent to this other word which is
[55:21] mirror which was used in the Hebrew in
[55:24] the Old Testament mirror denoting that
[55:26] that which is bitter hence the term is
[55:29] applied to bile or G the fluid secreted
[55:34] by the liver it is also used of poison
[55:39] so Paul chooses this word in order to
[55:44] identify bitterness that a child of God
[55:47] can let get in their heart and it would
[55:50] cause the spirit of God to be grieved
[55:53] now it's also used and and poison of the
[55:56] serpents in job 20 verse4 which is of
[56:00] course the poison ass which the Ancients
[56:03] erroneously believe was gone so
[56:05] Believers are to get rid of the five
[56:10] vices of bitterness now the spirit of
[56:13] God won't do it for you he will help you
[56:17] keep in mind he will help us do things
[56:20] we cannot do but he will never do for us
[56:24] what we're supposed to do ourself and he
[56:27] will never ask us to do things he knows
[56:31] we cannot do he will never do that now
[56:35] watch so coming with this notice in the
[56:37] scripture now that he said let all
[56:40] bitterness and wrath now he's going to
[56:43] name wraths anger clamor and evil
[56:47] speaking put away with the fifth one
[56:51] which is malice so notice W and it is
[56:55] the Greek word Simon which means
[56:58] Outburst of anger
[57:01] Outburst of anger now I've done s myself
[57:05] up tonight and I've been working on
[57:07] myself now for several hours all evening
[57:10] that it's okay if I don't get no amens
[57:12] tonight so I'm going to go ahead and
[57:14] preach with Adam so I'm not going to put
[57:16] no pressure on y'all to say Amen so if I
[57:18] get any I mean if I pass out y'all just
[57:20] you know just say God help him and give
[57:22] him
[57:23] strength notice says so Simon is
[57:27] outburst of anger now this is things
[57:31] that Grieves the Holy Spirit
[57:35] Outburst of
[57:37] anger now as I said this is not deep
[57:41] this is not seven Thunder preaching this
[57:43] is not parosa preaching and and this is
[57:46] not Miracle preaching and signs and
[57:49] wonders and all of that but either we
[57:52] fulfill this word or we miss going
[57:55] that's in the Rapture
[57:59] am so to me this is pretty
[58:04] important what good does it do us to
[58:06] think we're message people and we're
[58:08] bride people and we can't even fulfill
[58:10] scriptures in the
[58:13] Bible I can see why a lot of preachers
[58:15] Don't Preach this because they can't do
[58:17] it
[58:19] theirself amen come
[58:21] on praise the Lord now what so Paul uses
[58:26] is the word WRA now he moves over to
[58:29] anger which is the Greek word orgate
[58:32] settled feeling of anger and
[58:36] brawling woo that sounds rough to me and
[58:41] then he uses the word climber
[58:44] CR which is
[58:47] shouting or
[58:50] crying now this is coming out of
[58:52] bitterness now and then he moves over to
[58:57] evil
[58:58] speaking I was so shocked when I looked
[59:02] at the Greek word that is used for evil
[59:06] speaking
[59:10] blasphemia so it's
[59:14] blasphemy
[59:15] railing
[59:17] slander
[59:19] injur
[59:20] speech injury speech to another's
[59:26] good
[59:27] name so then Christians talking about
[59:30] one another and running down their
[59:32] brothers and their sisters or preachers
[59:35] or whatever it is that they do and they
[59:37] do it with that intent in mind to injure
[59:42] their sister's character or their good
[59:45] name or their
[59:49] brothers and then he uses the word
[59:52] malice Kaka ill will
[59:56] desire to injure evil
[1:00:01] naughtiness
[1:00:03] malignity so here it moves into this
[1:00:06] stage of malice now this is what
[1:00:10] bitterness can unfold in an individual's
[1:00:13] life if they don't ask God to take it
[1:00:16] out so bitterness leads to WRA which is
[1:00:22] the
[1:00:23] explosion on the outside
[1:00:26] of
[1:00:27] feelings that are on the
[1:00:30] inside now of course there's nobody here
[1:00:33] in the building tonight that is guilty
[1:00:34] of any of this but as you all know
[1:00:36] there's some sorry people that stream
[1:00:38] these services and boy after last
[1:00:41] Wednesday night some of them sorry
[1:00:43] outfits they started emailing me and say
[1:00:46] boy that was for me and it was so
[1:00:48] needful for me and I need help with this
[1:00:50] family member and that family member and
[1:00:53] this and that and the other and I I'm
[1:00:54] just so sorry sorry for you poor little
[1:00:57] innocent people here that God would just
[1:01:00] torment you all and and make you have to
[1:01:03] set under this kind of preaching for
[1:01:06] them some of them sorry outfits out
[1:01:08] there that stream these services so you
[1:01:11] all just need to join with me in prayer
[1:01:14] that God will get some of them people
[1:01:16] out there ready and they'll become more
[1:01:18] like
[1:01:21] usen well no maybe on second thought we
[1:01:24] need to think about how we pray for them
[1:01:26] and pray that they'll be more like
[1:01:29] Jesus and not like
[1:01:32] us so bitterness leads to wrath which is
[1:01:37] the
[1:01:38] explosion on the outside of
[1:01:41] feelings on the inside then
[1:01:44] wrath and anger can lead to brawling
[1:01:48] which is clamor or
[1:01:51] blasphemy which is evil speaking wow but
[1:01:57] here is the
[1:02:00] antidote Ephesians
[1:02:04] 4:32 and be ye
[1:02:07] kind one to
[1:02:10] another look at the word cros
[1:02:14] gracious
[1:02:15] virtuous good mild pleasant as opposite
[1:02:22] to harsh hard Sharp
[1:02:26] and
[1:02:28] bitter so for everything that God has
[1:02:32] the devil has one on the other side to
[1:02:35] try to replace it and everything the
[1:02:38] devil has God has a whole lot more to
[1:02:41] give us but the thing of it is it's like
[1:02:45] we cannot have
[1:02:46] both at the same
[1:02:49] time so it's like
[1:02:53] tradeoffs either we
[1:02:56] forgive or we
[1:02:58] forfeit forgiveness amen so it's not
[1:03:02] like that we can
[1:03:05] forgive and yet hold grudges and
[1:03:08] bitterness and all that it's totally
[1:03:10] impossible you see either we forgive
[1:03:13] those who trespass against us or we stop
[1:03:18] the Avenue of our own forgiveness from
[1:03:22] God now if there's anybody here tonight
[1:03:25] that's been holding a grudge or
[1:03:26] bitterness in your heart for say 5 years
[1:03:29] 10 15 whatever it is do you realize if
[1:03:33] you've hold something in your heart
[1:03:34] against people because they've harmed
[1:03:36] you and done you wrong say five years do
[1:03:40] you understand that means your own
[1:03:43] sins have not been forgiven by
[1:03:46] God for the last five years of your life
[1:03:57] I hope and pray to God there's nobody
[1:03:59] here that's that's there but if you are
[1:04:02] I hope you don't walk out them
[1:04:03] doors without repent and saying God
[1:04:06] forgive
[1:04:07] me now think of it either we
[1:04:10] forgive or we forfeit
[1:04:14] forgiveness now some of you may not have
[1:04:16] a grudge against anyone in this life or
[1:04:19] anyone in this
[1:04:21] church but your problem is you haven't
[1:04:25] forgiven given
[1:04:27] God you say
[1:04:29] God yeah because sometimes God will make
[1:04:33] a decision concerning you or your family
[1:04:37] or a loved
[1:04:38] one and you don't understand it and you
[1:04:41] develop a feeling don't tell me I've
[1:04:43] dealt with people all over the world
[1:04:44] that have done
[1:04:45] it and they get hurt against God and
[1:04:49] they get this feeling against God and
[1:04:52] they will not forgive him
[1:04:58] he ain't never done nothing wrong he
[1:04:59] don't need
[1:05:01] forgiveness but do you realize people
[1:05:04] that come to a spot that they can't
[1:05:07] forgive it not only affects the person
[1:05:09] they don't forgive it actually affects
[1:05:12] them
[1:05:15] more now watch so Paul said be ye kind
[1:05:20] one to another my my opposite to harsh
[1:05:25] hard shot bitter more pleasant
[1:05:29] benevolent be you kind one to another
[1:05:33] tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:05:37] another even as
[1:05:41] God for Christ's
[1:05:46] sake do you understand tonight the only
[1:05:49] reason you are forgiven I am forgiven
[1:05:53] it's not because we are worthy
[1:05:56] it's not because we deserve it God
[1:05:59] forgave us for one reason for Christ s
[1:06:04] amen you want to know how I forgive
[1:06:06] people that tell lies on me and do all
[1:06:09] they've done through the years you don't
[1:06:11] want to know how I do it it's quite
[1:06:13] simple yet quite profound I forgive them
[1:06:18] for Christ's
[1:06:20] sake even those who will never come and
[1:06:23] ask me to forgive them
[1:06:26] including preachers that's good never
[1:06:28] come and ask me never be man enough to
[1:06:31] admit that they were wrong and say
[1:06:33] something they don't have to as far as
[1:06:36] I'm concerned I can forgive them for
[1:06:39] Christ's
[1:06:41] sake but you see the reason some of you
[1:06:44] cannot forgive is because you're looking
[1:06:47] at that individual and you think they
[1:06:49] done so much damage they done this and
[1:06:53] they done that and they done that not
[1:06:55] worthy of forgiveness that's the reason
[1:06:57] you'll never be able to forgive them
[1:07:00] you're not told to forgive them because
[1:07:02] they're worthy Paul gives us the example
[1:07:05] I hope somebody's going to hear me
[1:07:08] tonight you talking about one of the
[1:07:10] great mysteries of God functioning in
[1:07:14] the body that we all need dealing with
[1:07:16] one another cuz every one of us is sorry
[1:07:19] rotten piece of junk I mean we're awful
[1:07:23] mixed up with this and that and the
[1:07:25] other if it was for the grace of God
[1:07:26] every one of us i' go to hell and be
[1:07:29] lost well praise the Lord thank God for
[1:07:32] grace and we're still stuck with this
[1:07:34] whole thing after we get converted now
[1:07:37] notice he said forgiving one another
[1:07:40] even as even
[1:07:43] as God for Christ's
[1:07:48] sake has forgiven
[1:07:53] you praise the
[1:07:56] Lord ain't this
[1:07:58] awesome
[1:08:00] Christianity produces true curiousness
[1:08:03] and politeness you're have to be rude
[1:08:07] and be oh my mean and spirited and all
[1:08:10] that because we believe them Oh Brother
[1:08:13] Don I run into people I boy I tell you
[1:08:15] want I tell them where they're going oh
[1:08:18] no you'll never win Nobody by that let
[1:08:22] the dove the spirit of God he can do
[1:08:24] more in five minutes with his presence
[1:08:26] and you can do in five years with that
[1:08:28] temper of
[1:08:30] yours you see it doesn't make us rough
[1:08:33] and crabbit and sour look at 1
[1:08:36] Corinthians 13:4 charity suffereth long
[1:08:41] and is kind charity envest
[1:08:46] not charity VA us not
[1:08:51] itself is not
[1:08:53] puffed up
[1:08:57] now if you want to be a puffer fish go
[1:09:00] ahead but we're not getting a Rapture
[1:09:02] Ready for pufferfish is for bride
[1:09:05] people
[1:09:07] amen now watch he says be ye kind one to
[1:09:11] another back to Ephesians 4:32
[1:09:13] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:09:15] as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
[1:09:18] you look at the meaning of this word
[1:09:19] tenderhearted having a heart disposed to
[1:09:23] pity and compass passion and especially
[1:09:27] disposed to show
[1:09:31] kindness not to the kindness of
[1:09:35] Brothers but to the
[1:09:38] false you understand how God looks at
[1:09:41] you you understand how you mediator
[1:09:43] intercedes for you daily probably for
[1:09:47] most of us hourly and minutely and
[1:09:51] secondly what does he say to the father
[1:09:54] forgive them Father they don't know what
[1:09:56] they're doing forgive them Father they
[1:09:57] don't know what they're doing how does
[1:10:00] our forgiveness come for Christ's sake
[1:10:03] so Christ Our mediator is not saying oh
[1:10:06] they're so good they're so sweet oh
[1:10:08] they're not that no but he's praying for
[1:10:10] our
[1:10:11] ignorance that's the key to us being
[1:10:14] able to forgive those who hurt us so
[1:10:18] severely and yet by the grace of God
[1:10:21] living inside of us we can forgive them
[1:10:25] as Jesus forgave the Roman soldiers for
[1:10:28] crucifying
[1:10:30] him although they never ask for
[1:10:34] forgiveness now watch the watch word
[1:10:36] here for Christians I want to share
[1:10:39] these with you these comments here M for
[1:10:41] all the people is forgive or
[1:10:45] forfeit
[1:10:47] forgiveness be a kind one to another and
[1:10:50] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:10:52] as God for Christ's sake ha forgiven you
[1:10:55] now I found this amazing in researching
[1:10:57] this that God for Christ's sake and the
[1:11:00] Greek is God in
[1:11:04] Christ it is giving as Christ as
[1:11:08] perpetuation so God in Christ Christ in
[1:11:14] you Christ in me now think of it it cost
[1:11:21] God the death of his son which was his
[1:11:26] Humanity to forgive
[1:11:29] us but in reality it cost us
[1:11:37] nothing to forgive our brothers and
[1:11:40] sisters but you would think it was
[1:11:42] costing our every Stitch of clothes we
[1:11:44] own our car our house our truck our boat
[1:11:48] our snowmobile our dog our cat our pet
[1:11:51] mouse oh Lord have mercy if I forgive
[1:11:53] them it'll cost me everything saying
[1:11:57] really no I'll tell you who it cost
[1:12:00] everything the Lord
[1:12:06] Jesus my my
[1:12:08] my praise the Lord you see the way when
[1:12:12] we recognize this it enables
[1:12:16] us to forgive via the Forgiveness we
[1:12:22] have received
[1:12:24] ourself because once you look at it
[1:12:27] right then the Forgiveness that we have
[1:12:30] already received are no merits no basis
[1:12:33] of our own and if we forgive on that
[1:12:36] basis we forgive like God if we forgive
[1:12:40] on the basis that we submit this
[1:12:43] list all right in order for me to
[1:12:45] forgive you brother Jack you got to go
[1:12:47] down here and do all 397 of these things
[1:12:50] and if I think of 97 more I'm going to
[1:12:52] tack that onto the back sheet and then
[1:12:54] I'm going check every one of them off
[1:12:56] and boy I'll tell you one thing you
[1:12:57] better do every one of them to the
[1:12:59] letter you're not forgiving the way God
[1:13:01] forgave
[1:13:02] you do you understand that God forgives
[1:13:04] us many times for sins that are in
[1:13:08] ignorance things that we don't even know
[1:13:11] that's wrong but he wants us to be so
[1:13:14] forgiven
[1:13:16] Hallelujah that he's so willing and you
[1:13:19] imagine then that comes in the hearts of
[1:13:22] human beings and many of them were born
[1:13:25] with an unforgiving Spirit it runs in
[1:13:28] their family that they will not forgive
[1:13:31] they will not do it it's just not in
[1:13:34] them they can't even say they're wrong
[1:13:37] it's amazing how many Christians I've
[1:13:39] dealt with that cannot say they are
[1:13:43] wrong you talking about a proud arrogant
[1:13:46] person that needs the Holy
[1:13:51] Ghost I'm such an
[1:13:53] ignoramus and a dummy
[1:13:55] and a failure I have no problem saying
[1:13:58] I'm wrong I said it a lot of times even
[1:14:00] when I ain't because I'm a peacemaker
[1:14:03] and some Christians ain't
[1:14:05] peacemakers so I I can say it I have no
[1:14:08] problem in saying said it all my life
[1:14:10] probably say it to the morning the
[1:14:11] moment before I'm changing this body cuz
[1:14:14] I'm just a human being I didn't get
[1:14:16] angel wings like some of y'all did my
[1:14:18] mother births me I was a renegade I had
[1:14:20] a naval I guess some of y'all had
[1:14:22] angelic wings and and you're you you do
[1:14:24] need get draw sustenance from your
[1:14:26] mother's cord I I guess you all had
[1:14:28] spiritual Heavenly IVs that was running
[1:14:31] down to you all uh so you didn't get no
[1:14:33] blood from your mama but you got Angelic
[1:14:35] choirs and you got all these spiritual
[1:14:38] vitamins you as this bastard born as I
[1:14:42] was Hell
[1:14:44] Bound woo pour it in God and I'll pour
[1:14:48] it
[1:14:49] out every one of us was as lost as lost
[1:14:53] could be and we were born between Satan
[1:14:57] and Eve that's what your Prophet said
[1:15:00] spoken words original
[1:15:02] SE oh my you see once we realize the
[1:15:08] aspect of God's
[1:15:11] forgiveness it makes it a lot easier for
[1:15:14] us to forgive
[1:15:15] others cuz we're not forgiving them on
[1:15:18] their
[1:15:19] Merit we're forgiving them as God
[1:15:21] forgave us now watch this in Matthew's
[1:15:26] 6:14 if you forgive men their trespasses
[1:15:30] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:15:33] you but if ye forgive not
[1:15:38] men their
[1:15:41] trespasses neither will your
[1:15:45] father forgive your
[1:15:51] trespasses brother Brandon when he reads
[1:15:53] this he said so we see
[1:15:55] faith is based upon
[1:15:59] forgiveness so you see whenever we hold
[1:16:02] something in our
[1:16:04] hearts against whoever it
[1:16:07] is and we think we're getting at them
[1:16:11] you're hurting yourself worse than you
[1:16:13] are
[1:16:14] them you'll never have to answer for
[1:16:17] what other people do I'll never have to
[1:16:19] answer for what other people do I'll
[1:16:21] answer for what I
[1:16:22] do right so can you imagine as we come
[1:16:26] back to it again if if you're sitting
[1:16:28] here tonight and you've had something in
[1:16:30] your heart and I'll never forgive I'll
[1:16:32] never I don't care whatever do I'll
[1:16:34] never do it you have cut off your own
[1:16:37] forgiveness from God it's like God has
[1:16:41] got it on
[1:16:44] hold and your sins are
[1:16:47] accumulating and
[1:16:49] accumulating and accumulating
[1:16:57] I'll tell you one thing I wouldn't want
[1:16:59] to live 10
[1:17:01] minutes with an
[1:17:05] accumulation a day no way a week you
[1:17:08] kidding me a month
[1:17:11] no the way I look at it I have no other
[1:17:16] choice but to forgive my
[1:17:19] enemies pray for them that despitefully
[1:17:21] use me people that have told lies and oh
[1:17:24] oh my my heart has been tore out Carol
[1:17:27] tells me all the time I got scars on my
[1:17:29] hands here and scars on my arms there
[1:17:31] I've cut myself and done this and that
[1:17:33] and the other you know and I'll come in
[1:17:35] and my hand will be blessed Lord what
[1:17:36] have you done now what have you done
[1:17:38] Lord have mercy Donnie and she said
[1:17:40] every time I see one of them scars on
[1:17:42] your hands I think you're a poor heart
[1:17:44] your heart has been tore out of you
[1:17:46] you've got scars All Over You by people
[1:17:49] people that you Pastor and preacher
[1:17:51] friends and this and that and the other
[1:17:52] and we all do we bear those scars and we
[1:17:56] can pet those scars and baby them and
[1:17:59] magnify them and put them in a frame on
[1:18:01] a wall if that's what you want to do I'd
[1:18:03] rather just move on the way I look at
[1:18:05] scars them scars you you've heard me
[1:18:08] tell the story many many times whenever
[1:18:10] I got Fox bit when we were all little
[1:18:12] I've still got that scar there in my
[1:18:13] hand a rabid Fox and we had to take the
[1:18:16] shots for the rabies well to me when I
[1:18:19] look at that ham now that scar is numb
[1:18:21] it's been numb since I was about 11y old
[1:18:23] kid something like that but because
[1:18:26] there is a scar there is a sign that my
[1:18:29] body healed itself so that scar is there
[1:18:33] yep I looked down at it did today
[1:18:35] thought about that fox whenever it ran
[1:18:37] out of the woods and knocked my sister
[1:18:39] Kim down and got on top of her she had
[1:18:41] her hands over her face like this and it
[1:18:43] was nibbling on her arms and I had a
[1:18:45] pocket knife and I grabbed it out
[1:18:47] whenever I did that fox went straight
[1:18:49] from me and grabbed a hold of my hand
[1:18:50] funny how you have flashbacks like that
[1:18:53] but I'm glad that I had a scar instead
[1:18:56] of an open wound on that hand ain't you
[1:18:58] all would any of you want to shake hands
[1:19:01] with me if I had blood and I'm running
[1:19:03] down and whenever my daddy come and Mama
[1:19:06] and they got us in there and they took
[1:19:07] us up to the doctor and had to sew us up
[1:19:10] and all that sort of thing I'm glad I
[1:19:12] got stitched up I'm glad I got sewed up
[1:19:15] and I'm also glad that that scar is
[1:19:18] there because that signifies I can touch
[1:19:20] it or don't feel it but I know that I am
[1:19:23] healed well I think it's time that some
[1:19:25] of you give Jesus the needle and let him
[1:19:28] stitch up your spirit and Stitch up your
[1:19:31] imagination and Stitch up some of these
[1:19:33] things instead of you putting your scars
[1:19:36] on the wall and hanging them in a 48 by
[1:19:39] 98 picture for him and say look at my
[1:19:42] scar let him heal you tonight and let
[1:19:45] him open up the channel of forgiveness
[1:19:49] from your heart so your sins can be
[1:19:52] forgiven
[1:19:55] amen oh
[1:19:59] my let's get down to Colossians
[1:20:04] 312 Now watch how Paul again is going to
[1:20:07] call on
[1:20:08] us to do something put on
[1:20:11] therefore as the elect of God holy and
[1:20:17] beloved bows of
[1:20:20] mercies
[1:20:22] kindness humbleness of Mind
[1:20:27] meekness
[1:20:28] longsuffering now notice he isn't saying
[1:20:31] that the Holy Ghost is going to do it
[1:20:32] all you got to do is just stand around
[1:20:34] he Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam he'll just hit
[1:20:36] you with all and say glory to God I'm so
[1:20:39] humble and I'm so proud of it I am so
[1:20:41] Meek I've got the old P up no but Paul
[1:20:45] uses the word IND
[1:20:47] Duo so it's like putting on a garment or
[1:20:52] sinking into closing
[1:20:56] now we we can't make the Garment we
[1:20:58] can't buy the Garment we cannot provide
[1:21:00] the Garment God gives the Garment of
[1:21:02] humbleness of Mind God gives the Garment
[1:21:05] of all these wonderful things but we
[1:21:07] still have to put it on do you want it
[1:21:13] tonight put on in Duo as sinking into
[1:21:17] clothing as the elect of God so now
[1:21:20] we're talking about bride
[1:21:23] material yeah
[1:21:25] amen put on as the elect of God holy and
[1:21:30] beloved and that's what you
[1:21:33] are bowels of mercies
[1:21:37] kindness humbleness of Mind
[1:21:41] meekness
[1:21:43] longsuffering let me read this to you
[1:21:45] humility is not thinking poorly of
[1:21:48] oneself but rather it is having the
[1:21:51] proper
[1:21:52] estimate of oneself
[1:21:55] self in the will of
[1:21:58] God not thinking too high it's amazing
[1:22:01] how much the New Testament mentions
[1:22:03] about this now meekness is not
[1:22:07] weakness it's power under control I love
[1:22:12] the contrast of the way that God does
[1:22:14] this because it's like God uses a power
[1:22:17] and he leaves that power in us after the
[1:22:21] Regeneration but the thing is that the
[1:22:23] Holy Ghost is not going to totally rip
[1:22:25] out everything of our humanity and then
[1:22:28] say blessed are they that overcome he
[1:22:31] just put you through the end of the P
[1:22:32] reach in there and grabs you and pulls
[1:22:34] you out on the other side you never
[1:22:35] overcome nothing but he's going to fill
[1:22:37] you with the Holy Ghost and leave that
[1:22:39] human makeup them flaws and them
[1:22:42] imperfections and then daily he's going
[1:22:44] to help you to overcome it and there'll
[1:22:46] be times you won't do so good and
[1:22:48] there'll be days you'll do better and
[1:22:50] then there'll be other days you'll sort
[1:22:52] of mediocre you know what I'm saying and
[1:22:53] many has him in your life sure you do if
[1:22:55] you're honest but yet the ultimate is
[1:22:58] that he wants you to reach that place of
[1:23:01] being a total Overcomer look at this
[1:23:04] when I was studying on this I found
[1:23:06] these examples I thought it was really
[1:23:07] amazing this word was used to describe a
[1:23:10] soothing wind a healing medicine and a
[1:23:14] cult that have been broken and each
[1:23:17] instance there is power a wind can
[1:23:20] become a storm too much medicine can
[1:23:23] kill a horse can break loose but this
[1:23:27] power is under control so we don't take
[1:23:31] all the force out of the wind but rather
[1:23:34] brings the wind under control so when
[1:23:37] you look at our lives as the children of
[1:23:40] God now look again that Paul says
[1:23:44] longsuffering the word is literally long
[1:23:49] tempero the short-tempered person speaks
[1:23:52] and acts impulsively ly and lack
[1:23:57] self-control when a person is
[1:23:59] longsuffering he can put up with
[1:24:01] provoking
[1:24:04] people or circumstances
[1:24:07] without retaliating
[1:24:11] amen thank you
[1:24:13] Jesus it's okay right now to say help me
[1:24:19] Lord praise the Lord now let's look
[1:24:22] again down here in at verse 13 again
[1:24:26] forbearing one
[1:24:28] another to forebear is not only freely
[1:24:31] to
[1:24:33] forgive but to
[1:24:35] meet
[1:24:38] halfway with extended
[1:24:43] hand now you see friend I
[1:24:47] realize that everybody in the world
[1:24:49] cannot and never will be able to fulfill
[1:24:53] this verse of scripture am as I said
[1:24:55] this not Revelation 10:7 it's not
[1:24:57] anything you know about the shout and
[1:24:59] the voice and the trumpet but these
[1:25:01] people who obtained this will be part of
[1:25:03] the shout the voice and the
[1:25:07] trumpet I love the meaning of this word
[1:25:09] to forbear is not only Frey to
[1:25:12] forgive but to meet
[1:25:15] halfway with extended hand but how many
[1:25:18] of us when somebody wrongs us we are not
[1:25:21] taking one step toward them it's their
[1:25:24] place to come to
[1:25:27] me and they need to get down on their
[1:25:29] belly and I mean they need a qual about
[1:25:32] a half a mile and they need to bring my
[1:25:34] favorite drink and my favorite Little
[1:25:36] Debbie cake and they need to bring me a
[1:25:39] a $100 gift card from from shop house
[1:25:41] and a $500 gift card from here and there
[1:25:44] and I might consider it you hypocrite
[1:26:05] you see only the elect of God can do
[1:26:10] this because they're the only ones with
[1:26:13] divine
[1:26:16] nature others will try their best
[1:26:18] there'll be many people that will read
[1:26:20] these scriptures and they'll hear it
[1:26:21] preach so maybe hope hopefully not some
[1:26:22] here tonight but there may be some
[1:26:24] and they say I need to do that I need to
[1:26:26] do it and they'll try and they'll try
[1:26:27] and they'll try and they'll fall and
[1:26:28] they'll try and they'll fall and they'll
[1:26:29] try and they'll fall and you will not be
[1:26:31] able to do it I'm telling you right now
[1:26:32] until divine nature is in you because he
[1:26:34] wants it to be him in us doing it not us
[1:26:39] for those of you that has listening to
[1:26:40] the statute of a perfect man Blasphemous
[1:26:42] names you're hearing the prophet saying
[1:26:44] there that these things some people have
[1:26:46] those things nature given so those some
[1:26:49] of those things people can just do by
[1:26:51] nature but God raises the level so high
[1:26:55] that human nature given faith will
[1:26:57] collapse human nature given virtue and
[1:27:00] knowledge and Temperance and godess and
[1:27:02] all these things will never reach it
[1:27:03] he's done it that way so it will only be
[1:27:07] his attributes that can reach the
[1:27:10] measure of the Statue of a perfect
[1:27:12] man oh my forbearing one another and
[1:27:16] forgiving one
[1:27:18] another If any man have a quarrel
[1:27:21] against any oh my goodness you you mean
[1:27:24] to tell me the New Testament Church The
[1:27:27] Acts 2 tongues talking devil casting out
[1:27:32] Miracle working Believers in that first
[1:27:35] century had quarrels in the church if
[1:27:38] they had any human beings that
[1:27:42] did If any man have a
[1:27:45] quarrel against
[1:27:51] any even
[1:27:56] as
[1:27:58] Christ forgave
[1:28:05] you and Word of Life
[1:28:08] said even as so you see he didn't say
[1:28:13] Paul didn't say now as I have forgiven
[1:28:15] and as Peter did as oh no that's not the
[1:28:19] example I am not your example when it
[1:28:23] comes to this
[1:28:25] Jesus
[1:28:26] is I want to be a god example before you
[1:28:29] you understand that even as Christ
[1:28:32] forgave
[1:28:35] you so how does he forgive
[1:28:40] us God's forgiveness is
[1:28:44] complete and
[1:28:48] final it is not
[1:28:51] conditional or partial
[1:28:54] wow
[1:28:56] amen he's still working on me and you
[1:29:01] he's still working on me and
[1:29:09] you in reality friends could we serve
[1:29:12] the Lord
[1:29:13] Jesus if he held back just one t of our
[1:29:18] sins and said I I'll forgive you
[1:29:22] 90% but this this 10
[1:29:24] % and I I'm going to have an attitude
[1:29:27] toward you so whenever you come to pray
[1:29:30] I I'm just going to I mean I'm I'm going
[1:29:32] to you know just kind of turn my head at
[1:29:34] times because that 10% just it's really
[1:29:36] bugging
[1:29:37] me it's just really bothering me so you
[1:29:40] know there may be certain days that you
[1:29:41] come to pray that I'll just say h I'm
[1:29:44] not going to hear this prayer
[1:29:45] today she's really bothering me with
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:49] temperament but he so forgives
[1:29:52] us it's so complete don't you understand
[1:29:56] we cannot do
[1:30:00] this and I am so
[1:30:05] glad it eradicates our ability to do it
[1:30:09] Carol it eradicates our
[1:30:13] ability we can't do it
[1:30:15] there only he can't forgive this
[1:30:21] we praise God
[1:30:26] so he forgave us for Christ's sake now
[1:30:28] watch Colossians
[1:30:30] 3:14 and above all these
[1:30:34] things put
[1:30:36] on
[1:30:38] charity now watch so here Paul is
[1:30:40] writing to Saints of course with the
[1:30:42] Holy Ghost some Believers that no doubt
[1:30:44] didn't have the Holy Ghost but again
[1:30:46] he's
[1:30:47] identifying this charity as it were a
[1:30:51] garment so what was it moving in to the
[1:30:55] fullness of what God wanted them to be
[1:30:58] and believe it or not it was not just
[1:31:02] Supernatural it was not just shouting
[1:31:04] Miracles healing we believe in all that
[1:31:07] but you'll never find God's Prophet when
[1:31:09] you preaches the statute of a perfect
[1:31:11] man ever using that as a sign of you
[1:31:15] being Bride As a matter of fact you'll
[1:31:16] find the
[1:31:17] opposite and above all these things put
[1:31:20] on charity which is the bond
[1:31:24] of
[1:31:27] perfectness I want to share this word
[1:31:29] with you I thought it might mean a
[1:31:30] little more to you if you'd be able to
[1:31:31] hear it the bond of perfectness was an
[1:31:35] upper
[1:31:37] garment which
[1:31:40] completes and keeps the get together the
[1:31:45] rest so can't you see when God adds
[1:31:49] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[1:31:50] Temperance and so on and so on and then
[1:31:53] when this ch ity which is the top of the
[1:31:56] Cal when it comes in the attribute of
[1:32:00] its fullness you see the church
[1:32:02] ages will receive the fullness of what
[1:32:06] is needed for a
[1:32:08] resurrection but yet Luther had a
[1:32:10] portion of the spirit of
[1:32:12] God Wesley had a portion of the spirit
[1:32:15] of God Pentecost had a portion of the
[1:32:17] spirit of God when I gave my heart to
[1:32:19] the Lord and I received the Holy Ghost I
[1:32:22] believe I got the Holy Ghost
[1:32:24] I received a portion of the spirit of
[1:32:27] God but I did not have it in my soul
[1:32:32] come on when Carol and I started
[1:32:34] embracing the message and Carol read the
[1:32:36] token and when she started reading that
[1:32:39] she got under such
[1:32:42] conviction and she told me Donnie I
[1:32:44] don't have what he's saying here because
[1:32:48] Carol had cut her hair in
[1:32:49] Pentecost and she said there's no way
[1:32:53] that I have gone
[1:32:54] what he what he said so she stayed up
[1:32:57] most of that night just about all night
[1:32:59] long crying and praying before the Lord
[1:33:04] so to me one of the mistakes that many
[1:33:06] of the people has come out of Pentecost
[1:33:08] into the message have made is this they
[1:33:11] changed their Doctrine but they never
[1:33:15] allowed their experience to move from
[1:33:18] their Spirit into their
[1:33:21] soul and that's why they're never a able
[1:33:24] to fully embrace the teachings of the
[1:33:26] message and they will nine times out of
[1:33:29] 10 they'll tend to go right back toward
[1:33:31] the teaching of Pentecost on this
[1:33:32] friends I don't understand I do not
[1:33:35] understand we've got Brothers in our
[1:33:37] message that are teaching the gifts the
[1:33:40] same way that I believed them over 40
[1:33:43] years ago when I was a Pentecostal
[1:33:46] preacher teaching it exactly the same
[1:33:49] way that I believed it when I was a
[1:33:51] Pentecostal and somehow believing that
[1:33:54] God's Prophet was wrong in the way that
[1:33:56] he taught it I don't understand it I
[1:33:59] scratched my head and think how in the
[1:34:01] world can this be that's what I believed
[1:34:05] 40 years ago why in the world when I
[1:34:08] want to go back to that what I believes
[1:34:10] in when God sent us a prophet to correct
[1:34:13] all that for
[1:34:15] us praise the
[1:34:17] Lord oh my so here charity is the top
[1:34:22] garment
[1:34:23] ah notice in 1 John 4:12 no man has seen
[1:34:28] God at any time and if we love one
[1:34:30] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[1:34:33] is perfected in us so it carried out to
[1:34:39] completion that is our love for each
[1:34:41] other is the
[1:34:43] reflection of his
[1:34:45] love
[1:34:47] reigning in our
[1:34:49] hearts this is what gives us the ability
[1:34:53] to love one
[1:34:54] another in spite of our
[1:34:57] quarrels in spite of our dislikes for
[1:35:00] this and that and the other oh listen to
[1:35:03] Blasphemous names and you hear the
[1:35:04] prophet saying something like this he's
[1:35:06] he's interpreting sister Shepherd's
[1:35:08] dream and sister Shepherd had a dream
[1:35:11] about a year prior to the preaching of
[1:35:12] the Statue of a perfect man and she's up
[1:35:15] on top of this mountain and there was a
[1:35:17] rock box and out of this rock box was
[1:35:20] coming forth pure streams of water and
[1:35:24] as it came down through down off of this
[1:35:26] mountain it was coming down through
[1:35:28] there nothing could stop it nothing
[1:35:30] could contain
[1:35:31] it and this man which he said was the
[1:35:35] messenger to the
[1:35:36] church which I thought was pretty
[1:35:38] phenomenal because he said he was quite
[1:35:40] a large man and work clothes and he was
[1:35:45] the messenger to the church bringing the
[1:35:48] message so he wasn't measuring brother
[1:35:50] brenham's human stature but his position
[1:35:53] according in to the age so believe it or
[1:35:55] not all the rest of us are little guys
[1:35:59] yeah amen so out of the rock box and
[1:36:03] this messenger told her in the Dream
[1:36:06] It's the Holy Spirit nothing can contain
[1:36:10] it it's too great but then something
[1:36:13] started coming out of the rock box and
[1:36:17] it was honey and as the honey started
[1:36:19] pouring from the top of the mountain Oh
[1:36:22] Glory to God and was coming down the
[1:36:24] mountain and you know how honey is it's
[1:36:28] sticky so he said as the honey come down
[1:36:32] it started sticking it together now he
[1:36:35] said I'm a I'm an old man and I once was
[1:36:37] young and now I'm old and he said I've
[1:36:39] seen it and he said say people say well
[1:36:42] I don't like brother Neville and I sure
[1:36:44] don't like this brother but he said let
[1:36:47] something happened to them and it about
[1:36:49] breaks your heart and he said if they
[1:36:52] was to leave or something like that and
[1:36:54] you say oh Lord oh Lord I I'm so sorry I
[1:36:59] never got to make peace with my brother
[1:37:02] he said see that brotherly kindness will
[1:37:08] stick now notice the attribute right
[1:37:11] before our age is kept off is what
[1:37:18] brotherly
[1:37:19] kindness wonder why wonder why never
[1:37:23] remember almighty God arranged these
[1:37:26] things in the order that he wanted he
[1:37:28] knew exactly what he was doing and yet
[1:37:30] he put brotherly kindness right at the
[1:37:33] very top right before the Capstone comes
[1:37:36] and caps us off adoption and also adopts
[1:37:41] the entire temple of God remember the
[1:37:45] seven Church Ages was a pyramid form and
[1:37:48] the Capstone capping off this age
[1:37:52] produces the resur rection power which
[1:37:55] will raise all seven Church ages they
[1:37:58] are waiting on us children don't think
[1:38:00] it's just me today and old brother
[1:38:02] Donnie's putting us under so much huh me
[1:38:05] it ain't me that's putting you under
[1:38:07] this if Paul was here tonight he'd be
[1:38:09] screaming out come on Word of Life if
[1:38:12] Peter was here and say come on Word of
[1:38:14] Life you need to move up you need to
[1:38:16] climb higher there's more there's
[1:38:19] more all those ages all those Millions
[1:38:23] of saints are waiting for the brotherly
[1:38:26] kindness to boil out of the rock now the
[1:38:29] prophet picked up Sister Shepherd's
[1:38:31] dream that she wrote to him in a letter
[1:38:33] and he said as soon as he started
[1:38:35] reading it he saw a vision and the
[1:38:38] vision interpreted the dream that's the
[1:38:40] way real dreams are interpreted by a
[1:38:42] prophet of God that's right and Word of
[1:38:45] Life
[1:38:46] said so he said in so much that she saw
[1:38:50] the rock box and he said that rock box
[1:38:52] was re ration of the word the rock of
[1:38:55] Revelation and the water it gust down
[1:38:58] into five streams which was Grace and he
[1:39:00] said that water was the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:03] he said now remember this sister was
[1:39:05] praying whether she had the holy ghost
[1:39:08] or
[1:39:09] not oh
[1:39:11] children think of where God is calling
[1:39:15] us now when he preached the statue of a
[1:39:17] perfect man and he draws it out on a
[1:39:19] chalkboard and he points with his finger
[1:39:21] and he said now God did not chir of this
[1:39:24] age what this age had and this one and
[1:39:27] this one but it just so happens we are
[1:39:31] right at the
[1:39:33] top so what's God requiring of us all of
[1:39:42] them you can't pick the one or two or
[1:39:45] three that you're good
[1:39:47] at but God is
[1:39:50] demanding them all yes sir
[1:39:55] stand
[1:39:58] together oh
[1:40:04] Jesus Colossians 3:15 Paul says let the
[1:40:08] peace of God rule in your
[1:40:12] hearts to the which also ye are called
[1:40:15] in one body and be ye
[1:40:20] thankful aren't you thankful tonight
[1:40:23] for the mercy of God
[1:40:26] Amen brother Donnie that that's so
[1:40:28] discourages me because there ain't no
[1:40:30] way in the world I can do that don't be
[1:40:32] discouraged that's I told you thank God
[1:40:34] you can't do it I can't do it brother
[1:40:36] brandom couldn't do it if you've not
[1:40:37] listened to these if you do listen to it
[1:40:39] notice how brother brandham is self-
[1:40:41] inclusive and how he includes himself us
[1:40:44] and me and us and we cuz he was looking
[1:40:48] at himself and wanting to climb higher
[1:40:51] and higher and higher
[1:40:55] and he said there was a little flange
[1:40:57] right on the top and remember that
[1:40:59] Capstone is a mini pyramid
[1:41:03] itself and it comes right down and sits
[1:41:06] right down on the very top and he called
[1:41:08] it the seal he called it your adoption
[1:41:11] called it several things cuz it all
[1:41:14] consummates in you reaching your
[1:41:18] place then the spirit of God I love the
[1:41:20] way he deals with it even in ordination
[1:41:22] of a minister which was the night when
[1:41:24] he preached that day of statue of a
[1:41:25] perfect man just a few words there but I
[1:41:28] found in listening to him that sometimes
[1:41:30] some Services I have wordss he'll
[1:41:32] mention just a few key words and then I
[1:41:34] catch those keys and then I go back in
[1:41:36] retrospect and listen to it again and
[1:41:38] sometimes for me it just makes it so
[1:41:39] much clearer but he's talking about one
[1:41:43] leads to the other to the other to the
[1:41:48] other we'll look at it Lord willing
[1:41:50] Sunday even the word add
[1:41:54] don't mean what you think it
[1:41:56] is add to your faith virtue add to your
[1:42:00] virture knowledge it don't mean like a
[1:42:03] calculator so one will run right out
[1:42:07] into the other to the other and it makes
[1:42:10] a way for the
[1:42:11] other praise
[1:42:14] God and once we have
[1:42:17] arrived until those virtues that they're
[1:42:19] manifested in
[1:42:21] us then it's
[1:42:23] unfolding of God inside of us till he
[1:42:28] gets every member of the body I hope
[1:42:31] y'all are still praying for God to bring
[1:42:32] every name in off the Lamb's Book of
[1:42:34] Life and bring them in in a hurry cuz
[1:42:36] I'm ready to go ain't you I'm ready to
[1:42:38] leave this place y'all want to stay here
[1:42:39] you can have it I'm ready to leave this
[1:42:41] place but you realize they can't go
[1:42:44] until these are molded in shaped in them
[1:42:48] won't it be awesome to see some of the
[1:42:50] last ones that come in
[1:42:53] those of us that have been sitting
[1:42:54] around for years and years and with our
[1:42:56] eyes we'll be able to see people come in
[1:42:59] it will be like a rocket the spirit of
[1:43:02] God will move on them and they'll see
[1:43:04] this and catch that and catch that oh my
[1:43:07] it'll be phenomenal to see what God is
[1:43:09] doing
[1:43:10] through praise God praise God well I'll
[1:43:14] tell you what it'll do it'll Revitalize
[1:43:16] us sir yes it will let's bow our heads
[1:43:20] together
[1:43:23] oh praise the
[1:43:26] Lord how may like to be remembered
[1:43:30] tonight anybody beside me say Lord I
[1:43:33] need help with all
[1:43:35] this I'm sure that many of you can see
[1:43:40] portions of this in your life but you
[1:43:43] see that's not what God wants to see or
[1:43:45] what we want to see we don't want to
[1:43:47] just see portions we want to see it in
[1:43:50] the full fruition of what God intends
[1:43:53] for it to
[1:43:54] be so it can lead to the other and the
[1:43:58] other and then God will finish his
[1:44:01] bride this is our part in the temple of
[1:44:06] God praise the
[1:44:09] Lord heavenly father as we bow our heads
[1:44:13] to the dust of the
[1:44:17] earth we want to thank you first of all
[1:44:19] for your word
[1:44:21] tonight we thank you Lord Lord for we
[1:44:24] made a little trip to the doctor's
[1:44:27] office we knew he was coming to church
[1:44:29] but we didn't know he was going to the
[1:44:31] doctor's office for a
[1:44:33] checkup so we stepped up on the scales
[1:44:36] and told us how much we weighed then
[1:44:39] they measured our height told us we was
[1:44:41] that checked our blood done our blood
[1:44:44] pressure done this and that and the
[1:44:46] other and the doctor come in the room Dr
[1:44:50] Jesus and he took our chart and said
[1:44:53] said I see your sugar's a little
[1:44:56] high well in your terminology you'd say
[1:45:00] I'd see your forgiveness is a little bit
[1:45:03] low I'd say your
[1:45:05] Temperance is running a little bit low
[1:45:09] here I I'm going to I'm going to help
[1:45:12] you raise that
[1:45:14] Temperance but you and I'll have to do
[1:45:16] it together you're going to have to ask
[1:45:18] me
[1:45:19] to and you're going to have to want me
[1:45:21] to with all of your heart
[1:45:25] and then I'll set it in
[1:45:26] motion because you and I are a
[1:45:30] team some of you are wondering what your
[1:45:33] part
[1:45:34] is it's quite simple really you see your
[1:45:37] need and then you begin to ask
[1:45:40] him can we ask him right here
[1:45:42] tonight Lord help
[1:45:45] me these verses are bride identification
[1:45:49] verses Lord Jesus what good would it do
[1:45:52] us to come come here to look the part on
[1:45:55] the
[1:45:56] outside and yet Lord miss having these
[1:45:59] as part of our
[1:46:01] inheritance we all can be honest because
[1:46:04] you know our hearts anyway Lord some of
[1:46:07] these things are very hard they
[1:46:11] are because there's something about us
[1:46:13] as human beings we can tend to be
[1:46:17] vindictive and we can be very harsh and
[1:46:20] hard on others
[1:46:23] we all want mercy of course for
[1:46:26] ourselves but we can sure be hard on
[1:46:28] anybody else that trespasses against
[1:46:31] us I'm just so grateful you're not like
[1:46:34] me I'm grateful you're not like some of
[1:46:37] the people that we know around the
[1:46:38] message and maybe even some that we go
[1:46:40] to church
[1:46:41] with they have so little
[1:46:44] Grace so little
[1:46:46] mercy and it's evident they have never
[1:46:50] really caught a true picture of how lost
[1:46:54] they
[1:46:55] were because if they ever do then
[1:46:58] forgiveness will take on a complete new
[1:47:01] meaning then they will be able to
[1:47:05] forgive for Christ's
[1:47:09] sake thank you Lord
[1:47:12] Jesus oh God we worship you tonight
[1:47:17] father we worship you Lord Jesus

[1:47:31] gentleness just come down and just Smite

[1:47:53] hard I can't go
[1:47:56] on without having more of you in my
[1:48:00] life and it's not that you are measured
