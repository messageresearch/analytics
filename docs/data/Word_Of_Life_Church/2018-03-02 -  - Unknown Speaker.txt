Lord how many of you wanna just really pray for your pastor tonight God would just give him whatever you have need of a man I know my better days are behind me as far as age I know yours is a lot of yours is behind you - they don't laugh you're just too Terry but I do know this I'm gonna make it regardless of how I have to go out of here I'm gonna make it how about you somebody say I'm gonna make it somebody say I've already got it made somebody say I'm just waiting from a chariot I'm gonna make it he's already said that I will ah keep on trustee he's working everything for my good he walks beside me heaven is in my view oh I'm gonna make it through one more time with all your heart I'm go make it he's already said that I wore ah [Music] he walks beside me a man in my view a kid's room [Music] hey man praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus whether we could see it out yonder and we had a good glimpse of it all how it's really gonna be and you could see yourself in a glorified body and you actually caught a glimpse of yourself walking down the streets of gold you see that was our trials and troubles everyone same nears heart of the day so more than likely we probably won't see that while we're in this life but we have faith that we're going to be happy amen the man we've been looking at job for a few weeks if he would have been able to sing chapter 42 at chapter 1 huh no problem no problem he's gonna get twice for everything he heads and I have double his kids he's gonna have all these things that's going to go on double gold double camels I mean there ain't no investment company they can do that for you so God's will actually multiply everything you've had your family's going to come back your friends that's going to come back the sabaeans is going to return everything they've took from you actually and they're gonna bring more back to you if you could see that when you're at pure when God said look you're fixing to go through a test but this is gonna be the outcome fine no problem all this let's get it on Lord let's get her down but he didn't know that he didn't know that now we believe tonight we're gonna be there but if any of you ever by vision seen your name in the Lamb's Book of Life when you ever by vision by reality not just by dream now but by vision which is tangible substance from the fourth dimension seeing yourself and it's the Alpha new body or a glorified body or yourself walking down streets of go well praise the Lord but how many believes you're gonna be there ah so this is why our journey is so affected the things that are around us because we are a believing people and we do believe well I guess when go home now that was my sermon transform in five minutes I preached everything in this turn tonight if I got a little more you think of it all right joke chapter 40 verse 1 they said brother Louie was right or not he said I had a little bit more to say so this same job chapter 40 verse 1 remember our sermon title is still the same what is thy beloved more than another what makes him so outstanding so different I realize the attributes that we're looking at especially in the last couple of weeks and tonight and tomorrow Lord willing it's attributes that people may not necessarily want to really love about God and that they may not consider great but God this God considers them great if God considers things great and I want to consider them great whether I understand them as being great or not because if he says they're great they're great if he's theirs or nothing then they're nothing and I want to think the same way job chapter 40 verse 1 more of the Lord answered joven said shall he that contended worthy all mighty instruct him he that reproveth God let him answer it then job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile which is nothingness I'm little I'm small he ain't down there yet he still thinks he's something what shall I answer they are not honed upon no no in other words I'll stop saying the foolish gibberish that I have said but I'm still not willing to repent the old I'm Val what shall answer thee I will lay my hands upon my mouth once have I spoken but I will not answer yay twice that I will proceed no further but he didn't say he would stop thinking it he just said he would stop saying it but you see God goes beyond even what we say and looks inside of our hearts and say if we're still thinking the same stuff about him hey let's let's pray together shall we Lord Jesus we love you so much tonight and all of your great ment majestic wonder father the universe all the things which you've created and done oh I believe much of it no doubt was done for the very fact you did it because you could prove that you could do it the more we look about and see the things father that you have done and most of humanity many of the things with nature and the laws of God most of humanity will live their life and never even know they exist most of man will live his life and be so ignorant of so many things which you've done upon the Earth's so you didn't do it just necessarily for man to behold it you didn't do it so man would look at it and marvel you did it to prove your greatness so you would be able to enjoy it I pray to not father you would take your word speak to us once again would you Lord Jesus we I'm here tonight as needy people we say that often but Lord we want you to know that we believe tonight your power is much greater than all of our needs so we bring our needs before you and we by faith believes that you will speak to us tonight as you always do in Jesus name and the Saints said god bless you may be seated you ever thought about how many things that God has done how many creatures that he's made how many things that he's placed upon the earth and you will live your threescore and ten or 55 or 35 or 85 and you won't even know one hundredth of one percent of what God has ever done how many of you know high for the species of trees that's on the earth how many of you know how many species of butterflies they are praise the Lord and they notice how many species of flowers kinds of rocks and he all ever seemed a little worm that lives on the jungle floor which has green lights going down his side and comes down he's back on this like led and on his head he has a little red light he is a millipede eater so when he gets close to the millipede he switches off his little green lights because the millipede can't see red oh my goodness you brilliant intelligent intellectual people and none of you ever heard of such a thing face it we're a bunch of ignorant when it comes to the greatness of God friends we haven't even scratched the surface of what God is I'm just glad to let me be saved I know I'm an ignoramus they're suing me and some of you is I know I'm an idiot and some of you think you're brilliant you're worse idiot than I am because you're an idiot too but you're an idiot on a lower level because you won't admit that you are you won't admit that you need such help and you want to try to impress the rest of us by big words that you say big things that you do and let on like you know so much about God why don't you just come on down to the same dirtbag level as all the rest of us and realize if it wasn't for the grace of God you'd be out there tonight as lost as loss could be you'd be out there running around with somebody else's husband or somebody else's wife or drinking or smoking or whatever more but the grace of God has allowed you to sit in the house of God and be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost you know Joel had a great a great understanding about God we don't want to take anything away from Jill but as we will look at it as we go into chapter 42 Jobe admits that much of what he had learned about God was through a transitionary source that it was a source that was very very limited in its ability to be able to teach him and job has now come to this part in chapter 42 where that he's able to admit that he is small that it's not as big as God and he doesn't have as much great understanding of God but he still is into that state of repentance I'll tell you friend I believe that for many many people in the age that were living once we get to a place that we cannot repent and ask God to forgive us and asked one another to forgive us we're in a terrible spot the zeal of this hour is to repent and if you and I get to a spot that we cannot repent when we are wrong not only when we're wrong as far as doing things of the world or whenever were shown that we and doctrine are shown that we're wrong because we've listened to something and called it God and then someone proved to us that voice that told us that was a liar and we cannot repent of that we are in danger of hail because you are that close to listening to a deceiving spirit that you are calling the Holy Ghost now a real sign of God is going to make mistakes and the church said there's going to be times we are going to be certain that we are led of God and it's going to prove we were led by the devil there's going to be times we are gonna feel so impressed that it's the Lord that told me to do this and the Lord said do this and that and the other and the facts itself approve out it was not God at all and this is what makes our beloved so wonderful and that he is just he is righteous he is pure he will not let his children get by when they do wrong or when they believe wrong or listen to wrong he wants him to be straight and that's because He loves us you see the devil is the type of master and the type of God that loves for his children to be deceived he lies for babies to be born blind he loves four men to divorce their wives he lost four people to commit adultery he lies for people to get on Facebook and on their phones and texts and so on and cause trouble and cause gossip in a family he loves for trouble to be born and an atmosphere of deceit alot that's the kind of person that he is this is the kind of God and I do say God because He is God of this evil age but he's a puny God because he ain't got no power to create I said he's a puny God he cannot offer you heaven he cannot heal you and you can sit he cannot raise you up when you get down he cannot deliver you from the power of darkness that's a kind of golf that is he's a liar he's a hypocrite he's two-faced well praise the Lord I figured y'all be shy I'm told that you're head of it now that's the kind of being that is but my beloved is not like that Satan will let his bride get Bible doing anything she wants to do she can live any way she wants to live and then go to church on Sunday and do her religion and her husband loves her for it and she loves him for letting her do it I mean they are madly in love they love one another so much they give their body their soul their mind their spirit they will sell their children to the devil husband's will sell their wives wives will give up their husband they will give everything to the devil come on now and we growl and grumble if the Lord ask us to give up this and that and the other on line the world serves their God they a my my they love him they love him more than heaven they love him more than Jesus they love him more than salvation if they didn't they'd come to God and what's he gonna do take the whole sign right down to the lake of fire that's right but that's not my beloved my beloved is so particular the devil will live in anybody the devil will even go to stoop so low that he will live in animals in order to carry out his will the devil will live in a Hulk that tells you a lot about the devil the devil will live in anybody on what they do how they talk how they did that's the kind of being he is but my husband is very picky who he lives him my husband is very very picky who he calls as his home he's very very picky as far as who he calls as his elect and his bride he will not let a two-faced liar and a hypocrite he will not live in them I don't care how much they think he does he will not live in a troublemaker God hates that sort of thing but the devil loves all those that oh my but my beloved is very very particular the devil is a hypocrite he has an impostor he is a liar he is a fabricator of untruths he is a promoter of sayings that are contrary to the Word of God he is an absolute liar from the beginning he is a murderer he is deceived and a deceiver but my beloved is the fountain of truth he is the truth he is the way he is the life he sells shoddy I used to hold Ajara he saw us along he's a healer come on church he's a heart mender he's a universe creator he's a New Jerusalem maker he's a new life changer praise be to God he is a regenerator that's how my beloved is notice this he is just let's look at this now for a few months before we get over to Joe I said chapter 45 verse 21 tell you and bring them near yeh let them take counsel together who has declared this from ancient time they're told it from that time I've not I the Lord and there is no God so for those of you who believe in more than one this is the man that's in the throne himself and he looked around and said there ain't nobody beside me on either side there is no one home ah there is no god else beside me a just God and a savior there is none beside me that's my beloved he's not one of threes not two of three he's all three in one look at the words yes it is lawful righteous righteous and government righteous and conduct and character right correct and lawful so you believe with me tonight that I believe it is just even when he allows us to go through trials and things that we do not understand you see job is not having a question about God in that can God control the ostrich and God control the stars and God control the solar over to the moon and God placing a position and God doing many of these things that is not job's major problem job's major problem is trying to understand why God would allow the wicked to prosper and God would allow the righteous that love him with all of the heart to lose basically everything they got and struggled a lot job as a rich man he did not hear the conversation in heaven between God and the devil and job is now looking he looks over at the center god this guy may be him no no telling what he's done to get his living he's lied he's robbed he stole he's cheated job as a man of honesty and integrity he had tried to do everything on fries and jocose everything is that his wife even moves out of the house his wife leaves him his servants leave him his brothers and his sisters he don't even get a friendly text from his sisters to check on how he's doing they show up a tree he's healed I've got a few friends out there Oh nobody even comes to the house his settlements are gone there's nobody there Joe beckons and nobody comes they I've got him he's stinking he's satting outside oh my is a rotten mess and jokes that I just don't understand that how can you say you are just how can you say you are holy and righteous and pure I've done nothing to deserve this I've done nothing to bring this Ummah now this is where these three friends accuse him remember they said you've sinned and you've done wrong and God is punishing you say I've not done it I've had a just sacrifice before God and this is something friends that you and I may struggle with from time to time herself is to kill still keep this in our mind God is perfect God is just God is righteous even when things happen that we don't understand even when loved ones pass on and we pray everyday that God will move for them and he simply refuses to answer us you believe he's just for the rest of you believe you believe it's just notice definite chapter 3 verse 5 the just Lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning does he bring the judgment to light he fayliss not but the unjust knowest no shame revelation 15 3 and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the servant of lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works Lord God Almighty notice they don't say Lord God Almighty there's only one Lord God Almighty he's here my name is the Lord Jesus Christ just and true are thy ways thou king of saints so he is just but job is struggling with the Justice of God David said the wicked spring forth as a green bay tree why is it God that he said I'm so hated I'm so persecuted my enemies come against me they stomp me Lord on every side everywhere I turn there against me yet look at this wicked man look at that wicked man look at that one it seems like nothing happens to their they don't pray they don't read their Bible and they are so blessed they have so much stuff and they have such peace are you sure they do remember the law these land of sins or hypocrite actors oh they can tell you how much they got and how good their business is doing how do you know what's going down down inside that soul when they lay down at night when you lay there you may not have the money to pay your bills but at least you got peace with God they lay down or not oh god what happened to me a Fido you say some of them don't think that I'm sure some of them don't they've sinned away their day of grace they've sinned so far there's not even a consciousness of God at all and yet you're laying there and you say oh how am i blessed you're blessed because you say Lord forgive me my sins this day forgive me lord if I've done anything wrong you don't identify that and so blessing do you understand how blessed you are when you lay down on your bed at night and you say Lord if I've done anything this day please forgive me you know you are a blessed human being anything else you pray that way he's just and he's righteous second chronicles 12 6 were upon the princess of Israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the Lord is righteous this is the exact same word that we just read English translators called it of course just his exact same meaning Ezra 9:15 o Lord God of Israel thou art righteous Psalms 11 7 for the righteous Lord loved us righteousness his countenance does behold the upright but in this day we have a different God we have a God that's a large large grandfather he's a big grandfather in heaven and for most people I was just a young little boy and young man setting her by him you know ii come in god a blue team in general all that sort of thing and he does all these other things that this old man this old man didn't want to come down and died for us so he sent his son to come down coward that a my God my God but not send some boy to die for me and then when he say he's the one who gave the penalty if God gave the penalty God should buy his own instrumentality take the penalty of his along my beloved did that condescension and creation of humanity called sonship of Jesus Christ not another God the same God so we got this old dhoti grandpa and he has all these grandkids in church now he knows this is the Laodicean age and grandpa knows that kids can't live right in this day so grandpa noise all the singers and all the preachers and everybody and they're just preaching Christ grace grace grace grace to your appearing grace or the way they preach it anyway what's this but I'm stuck no and this is the layer to see an agent or this age needs a sharp rebuke from God it needs a sharp rebuke on our clergy get so soft and dhoti like some aged grandfather to his grandchildren now I know I'm getting older and I know I'm getting slower but I ain't Dodi yet and I don't plan on getting Dodi neither praise the Lord now notice how he likens it now to grandparents huh to a grandfather instead of a father wonder what it is about a grandfather and a mother and their relation to grandchildren but one thing all three categories are grand grandfather grandmother grand show you saw what I love in kids the most about the homeless set of years ago if I don't know these grandkids that have been so much fun I've had them first forget them youngins so what is it something about that second generation the way like oh my oh my they didn't know Hong that's not true they do do wrong your grandkids are just not mine they're human they need to be born again [Applause] well I see tonight's gonna be an am endless night notice this now that is grandeur of grandfather to expand children ever what they do is perfect it's been said so much that God is such a good God until they try to make God just a big Dodie grandfather so if God is a big Dodie grandfather then God's clergy should also be Dodie clergy now this is why the clergy who have this concept of a grandfather God all these clergymen are Doty clergy but a me in my image of God so guess what I'm not a dirty bastard a man military a member the less hey man Happy Valley now if this is your image of God and this then this is the kind of clergymen that you should expect to come and preach to you because your God is a noted Rand Paul then your God ought to have a dhoti pastor a dhoti evangelist a dhoti teacher a dhoti prophet you see but he's not he is a father God is not my grandpa he's my daddy and everything I do is not perfect in his sight so sometimes he gives me and Kentucky terminology we can understand on war pay now for you sophisticated folks I'm going to show what you want to call it time out I guess count to three my god never did count on me he walked well there's been a few times I wish he had accounted you know no not really i brother him treat me like a son instead of her grandson now notice this is my beloved though this is who he is this is who I see and what I see about him and to me it expresses his love to me if so intimate he loves me so much he will not let give me give I was wrong if I get cold he shakes me up if I get indifferent he shakes me up if I get stopping he whoops me oh oh so I'm your only proud of that you mean you want to see which God would just let you along and let you smoke unless you shoot up and let you listen to rock and roll and you sisters dress out the world and God would treats you like he does he's Laodiceans you know where you're going tribulation God don't treat dollars that way God don't treat sons that way praise the Lord love is always correct if she love corrects no matter how bad it hurts it's still correct so real mother will correct her children a real dad will correct notices in paragraph four - then there you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian and let the life of God go from him and the experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a trench for such as going on he runs twice as quick wow they're laying right in the stream where water is now remember he gets his Simon taught it was down in Kentucky in a bit hunting down there that weak squirrel hunting and he jumped up on the side of a beach draw those would be the only thing about beach snow though the beach is a very hard wood it's not a pretty wood but it's a hard way so they use Beach from making barstools and chairs and tables and things like that the grain is very very drab so they'll put oak veneer walnut veneer shaven here's some type of veneer on top of it but the sub structure will be Beach because it's a very good hardwood very cheap wood doesn't sell for 100 board foot and all that and then some of the exotic types of woods there but a very good structurally foundationally sound wood so you're the profit jumped up on the side of this beef log which had been standing there for years and something happened to it and it died so the life went out of it it fell down and when he jumped up on the side of that beach slope a great big old chunk of the log fell off now this is where he gets his sermon how can I overcome Wow don't you love that seminary he wants it so what happened I brings this like two Christians that are coming he said this big tree at one time stood right there it's roots it's at provement down beside the branch of water that was there and it thrived and thrived for years and pulled the nutrients out of the water and the nutrients out of the leaf matter and that stood for years and years the life goes out of it the tree falls and when it falls it falls right into the same branch of water that it had drawn from from years and years but now the life is gone the quotes are there the scriptures are there maybe so dress as a Christian for a while even tops icon for a while but the life is gone from that tree and then it lays right in there where God's healing where God is delivering were gone is moving and it will rock twice as quick as a badness which is going to a dead church that's why message folks when they go to getting cold on God it ain't no wonder they fall so quick why do they fall so quick though right now we're healing is the right that word deliverance is and they come right there and know there's deliverance and but choose not to be delivered oh my goodness notice the joy of serving Christ and living in a church for such as going on here at ins trisys Creek living right under it so we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least they'll notice I says this because the tokens had to be preached the part of the message we should live counsel in the life of Christ because if you don't you learn around and know that these things are supposed to do and don't do it the Bible said he that knows to do good and do it or not to him it's in then what happens you become duty so you got a doe to God with the dodi clergymen guess what you're gonna become Dody yourself unless you refuse and say I'm out of here I'm now stickin around well they don't believe in the power of God come on show then you become Dodie rotten when you're separated from the life of God so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of Christ that you may be fruit berry now it's job save during this time yes as far as what would call save yes but it sure isn't bearing good fruit he's so ill his temper is so out of sorts and this trial is bringing some things out in job the child never realized was there no doubt and he's disappointed in himself he's disappointed in his understanding of what he thought about God God had never allowed him to be tested in such a way God goes on now in chapter 40 and on down through the rest of chapter 40 and chapter 41 was bringing some comparisons let's look at a few more verses if you don't mind and eleven God says to him cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is proud and a basin now you know that this may not mean much to us but this is deity speaking from a level of deity understanding of God being on a throne and this is one of the attributes of God dealing with humanity in time this will never be an eternity of course but God dealing with human beings for thousands of years this was something that God was demanded of in the loop of time to be able to express at times and that was his indignation his anger and his wrath I proud humanity so God moves from the stars momentarily and he moves from the animals and from botany live it God said here is another attribute of God that I would like to see you displayed so I would like for you to show me your godly air your anger as a king of eternity bring down the proud and make him humble himself before you now the God this is a no-brainer joke in him humble himself how can he humble anybody else now like the rolling of the lion may attacks are far from your throne may your majestic voice and your great of nepeta n-- sand power may it thunder in such a way that the sinners will hear it and tremble at your presence maybe he just got done callin for a servant to come and he found out there were no more servants left they all left God knows how to say the right things at the right time stop aren't you daddy knows your address now I want you to do this and then I want to see the consequence of them abasing themself at your voice maybe I'll believe you job is probably surprised you all right can you - a proud man and the esophagus and make him humble himself and repent as I am able to do come on show how much tammini 10 seconds 5 minutes you tell me verse 12 look on everyone that is proud and bring him low that's it you and I would never even think of this is godly no this is knobby leather this is one of the things that he does everything about him is not sparkling stars this is part of being God this is part of being God listen now don't misunderstand me this is part of being God but not being the eternal God's anger will one day cease to exist in manifestation please listen carefully one day faith will no longer be needed the blood will no longer be needed as an atonement between you and God you will stand there face to face and see him man one day your face will turn to sight or will be to God hey man this is manifested only in time one day God will never look out of his spirit eyes and display such anger there'll be nobody there to look at that way track down the wicked in their place oh my now this is what God does again hacia chapter 2 verse 11 the lost in looks of a man shall be humbled in the Holderness a man shall be bowed down and the Lord a long shall be exalted in that day why because God can do that again verse 17 and the loftiness of men shall be down down on the hardness of men shall be made low and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day you know God will repeat himself several times it's verily verily I say unto you that's a double vindication of God's own character now he said as I am God I have the ability to thunder my voice I'll have the ability to instill such fear in the wicked now I understand you want my job speak all nighty job I guess there's no wall Mattie's in the building tonight but one is there any almighty seaworthy all my T's please stand up will the all-knowing solid nipa Tain's please stand it I better sit down here I think notice in verse 13 hide them in the dust and bind their faces and secret kill them taken the shield now God says if you can do these things in verse 14 then will I also confess unto thee that thou our own right-hand can save thee oh boy if you can do this and you let me say amen to you I mean I don't mind telling you right now job I'll say yes sir you're the man here you go here's my throne here's the keys to heaven here's all the books you can do the whole thing but God wasn't worried you know that I hope you understand this God God is not worried even sometimes when we get all out of sorts I'm sure probably nobody here but me gets in a bad mood every now and then but boy sometimes I do really three or four of you lord I knew there's a bunch of saints here I just didn't know there's so many Oh Marcy what a blessed man I am to have so many church and Saints in church is so sinless in spouse thank you God thank you for letting me pasture nearly a perfect chance I just don't my they job me nots if they're perfect oh sorry that was my man him when you are strong enough to humble men and I'll be convinced you're strong enough to save yourself praise God mmm chapter 42 verse 1 then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou canst do everything now in reality he had no problem with that part of it anyway now wasn't lots of garbage Christians elbis questions God doth not I mean this devil bigger than God God bigger than devil no you don't find him going that way his problem is about allowing the things that's going on in his own life now notice he's moving into the face of repentance real genuine repentance repentance can only come to us in reality when we see the greatness of God the reason people do not repent in this day the fear of God has left them they're not afraid of God they'll come to church and we have a lot to devil and set right terrible the Holy Ghost is moving it don't bother them at all people run down a man of God they'll run down a pastor they'll let the devil lie to them they'll do all kinds of things against the Word of God against the scripture against the message come on Saints and they have no fear of God at all they'll get on the internet make up all kinds of lies they'll get on Facebook make up all kinds of lies the fear of God has left this generation but it has not left the bride praise be to God all mine notice this I know that thou canst do everything not only now by power not only by power by the gym but divine justice to the power of the allocation of his thoughts bringing in the Providence and the divine wheel that the things that you're going through Jove even though you don't understand it not only can God do it by power God is doing it for your good Omar I know the Falcons do everything that no thought can be withholding from thee you understand friends now he's finally reached a spot that you you it's not me it's not been me the one that's been right the whole time I've been wrong I've had such an attitude I've said such things no salt no salt kimby was holded from job saw he now had been so long and he's headed and his mentality notice in verse 3 who is he that highest counsel was that knowledge I love this verse you probably don't remember it but this is job actually quoting word-for-word what God asked him in job chapter 38 verse 2 you see repentance is starting to work because now joke can quote God's word about his faults not only about his blessings and his healings or we can say the word oh yes by strap some here I wish above all things that Thomas prosperous say the word say the word quote the word repeat the word I believe in all that - but when we are wrong we have to quote the word about us being wrong you see he did not do this in chapter 40 he had not broke over the last chapter chapter 40 in full chapter 41 finally broke through that hard shell that had been built around show up in his complexes and all that he was going through and God finally broke through it and now Joe is quoting back to God the thing that God put into him who is this the highest counsel without knowledge now job is saying not you now I can quote your word I'll listen to a lion devil anybody in you ever listen to a lyin devil devil go to line you say brother Wayne don't like your brother Donny don't like it he don't care of nothing in this world for you don't sit don't look at me Saints like you know what I'm talking about the devil has done that over and over not only about you pastor about the Deacons or your friends in the church but the same about the Lord Jesus he don't love you he don't care for you he why he don't even give you the time of day and when we listen to that word listen to that live devil that's exactly what we do he ain't nothing but a liar and the church said we listen to that line Joe finally come to his body said I'm wrong I have listened to lies who is this darkness counsel by words now he's taking the word and rebuking himself well we're all good at that when it comes to buchan or wife or the pastor of the Deacons whoever more bold we drag out our sword will cut their heads off how many of y'all are good at cutting your own off a good Christian is not always one who can cut everybody else's tongue off but knows how to cut their own oh sweet Jesus Carol honey amount Oregon's job application will be fired after this weekend swords a whirl oh ma now in this corrective way the world is finally broke through and Jobs seen himself surely I did not say that surely I did not say that to God surely I would this has not been me it has questioned him this way yes job it was you I am foolish notice this who is this that hiders counselor that knowledge therefore have I uttered that I understood not that sounds like us concerning the providential dealings of God with men I have said things I flap my jaws and I didn't understand the first principle about things too wonderful for me which I've been Deva no now I realize it it was total maintenance on my part even say anything I have pronounced an opinion on subjects which I didn't even understand well I wonder how many of us are so self opinionated and we are so strong on our opinion on just about everything well I'm gonna come right down among you and preach if anybody puts out a bad spirit I'll be able to put my hand on dinner fine what causes the most of our problems and arguments between husband husbands and wives strong opinionated husbands strong opinionated wives and neither them willing to bow and willing to hold their peace sometimes for the sake of peace itself what do you value the most your opinion or peace what do you evaluate the most you get in your way or being able to come to a church I don't go along with the music and I don't like this and I don't like oh then you know what you never will find a church that you like unless you run it and then if you run it nobody else watch it that's all we've all got to be changed because if we'd get there to heaven would be cropping about which foundation was first what say Lord why didn't you make the Burrell first I thought Burrell would have been a lot prettier on the bottom we'll all be changed from all that nonsense well I don't understand why did you make it like a pyramid I would have enjoyed it a little bit better all of that about us so they totally gone all that about us that don't like some of the people we go to church with it will all be gone there'll be none of you standing down on 8th and 7th world crosses down there and still around horses lord have mercy there's brother Jack Oh God let me good on this one that won't be the honor that there nobody will show nobody nobody will dislike nobody nobody will dislike human makeup of nobody and we will all detain and we all need it oh ma this is now the language of true humility and penance from a man who's not willing to confess the thoughts of his wife the fort's of ill affairs though hard and his friends and servants but he's willing to look at himself and say is there a possibility that even I all right whoa Jesus there's a little old guy we used to know down in West Virginia's name was Donny Farley and he wouldn't bless his heart he wasn't totally there but he was telling us one night he's riding his bicycle in from church after a tent meetin he's kind of dark my car come through and kind of run him off the road he run into the river so her ask him said Don what did you do such it give me all your Jesus that's what I'm gonna be saying here in a few minutes Jesus Jesus got Donny out here get this Davi out I ain't in the targa River but some of y'all might want to throw me in before they get down here tonight Joe that becomes so self-opinionated the man is willing to argue with God hmm beyond comprehension is it but we won't ask for a raising of hands of those who have done it here in Happy Valley those of you that are streaming you can go ahead and be brave and net that me eyes on you notice now in verse four he says here I beseech thee and I will speak I'll hold your hand of thee and declare that come to me here here I'll beseech you Joe now humbly asking God God please I know that words tahmooressi but don't let it stumble you demand he's not arrogant you have to catch the meaning of it this is the submissive language of a docile child who's finally reached a spot I'm coming as a humble ignorant child I'm begging you teach me teach me please I beseech you I beg you is the word I beg you I plead for an audience oh you imagine Papa's heart now Papa's are swell in its which say is a human being brother Jim as God the relation that's my boy that's my boy can't bring it out of him God but this town's back to have a spell let your feet teach me this is my beloved I beseech you I don't want to complain no more I don't want to cry I don't want to grumble teach me teach me you've been teaching me you've been telling me but because my attitude your attitude has been quite sharp toward me and I realize it needed because that's what helped break me from that arrogance and hardheadedness that i was displaying but now I want to sit down and I want to have a different attitude and I know I'm not attitude as different yours will be different so I don't want to set here's the stubborn hard-headed Nordahl child I want to set your as a submissive docile child let's end father please please tell me how wonderful tell me tell me what you can tell me about me so what helped me to understand me praise God I refuse to complain I refuse here are beseech them and I will speak I will demand look at this word it does not now mean in a forceful way that you're demanding God to do this or that but look look at the meaning of it to ask inquire bar'el beg to ask as a favor consult to seek I humbly ask of you this favor dream and temper my soul in your presence calm these wise calm these doubts these frustrations and this worries these words that I've spoken there are beseech thee and I will speak up or demand to thee and declare thou unto me he now better taste submitting himself as if in a nurse freed this is a great victory do you understand what a victor this is for us as children of God when we can come this face God I just don't understand I'm not annoyed all I'm not smart I don't know I just don't know but teach me please teach I love this next verse I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear now once you notice now how attributes where he's answering from brother Jim it's not the hearing of the soul he realizes for the tyrrhene is able to come to the divine supper of truth and tradition I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear that job is a great man you agree with that a great understanding but we can see for this child he liked a lot as well notice where he attributes been the foundation of what brought him to questions such things in the swathi had heard about God by the ear his ancestors his parents his grandparents the people that was around I've heard of thee by the hearing of the air but now the eyes of my understanding see you in a total different way then I heard you I realized what I heard about you left me was much understanding what I heard the way you was and the way was told to me and the very best that they might have known but by the hearing of the ear it has left me in such desolation but now well praise the Lord I wonder summer jobs children cannot not could say the same thing some of what we heard of thee by the hearing of the ear made us Trinitarians uh-huh some of the what we heard of the hearing of the year some of y'all said under women preachers or believe tongues of evidence the Holy Ghost or eternal hell or whatever more you got that from the hearing of the year no doubt my people that love God and we're telling you as much as they knew but why don't you believe it tonight because your eyes have seen him in a different way by the hearing of the year and you can hear truce I believe that we have the truce here do you not believe that and yet we hear it over and over and over again and it never never moves out of her head down to our heart it is no more than a traditional value this message can be no more than tradition to us and our children until it becomes a divine revelation I've heard I've been instructed in matters of religion I've been so instructed I heard by the hearing of the year I'd left much to be desired that hearing allowed me to question you know I feel like a fool but this is my beloved he separated Jobs flesh from job's soul by dividing what he'd heard by the ear from what he heard by the heart I've heard of thee by the hearing of the ear notice by the cherry how he identifies I've heard so much about you I've learned a lot about you but a lot of it was not heavenly accurate oh praise be to God man wasn't that too good words put together thank you lord it was not heavenly accurate it was an earthly conception by people that matter men well but it less this man lasting understanding he could develop such an attitude come to understand our people do it today because the teaching they're sitting under oh they're sitting under the teaching and won't apply it I've heard of the by the hearing of the year I have had much hearsay knowledge I've heard you're a good dog I've heard you're a grandpa I've heard that you don't care how women dress I've heard that it don't make no difference to you whether we pay in her face or whether we look at the world address at Jezebel's I've heard that you did she don't even care about that I've heard that you don't even believe in homeless no more god if he believed it wants to still believe in it he's holding he said as I am holy be you there for her Levi be your perfect Sara what what how do people to come up with this conduct of this concept it's because they have heard of him of the hearing of the ear and they hear and they set that under a dhoti preacher preaching a dhoti God they become a dhoti Christian and they hear it in here it in here in here and some we was all the same way one way or another after in the world in his bond as we could be hearing about a God why don't we look at those things tonight God rich and mercy reach down to us and divided and separated just for the hearing of the year to now mine eyes now let me close up again in the morning wherefore I love all my people who tell me they see so much about God and they're so close to God ah you know I get a lot of emails and a lot of letters and a lot of texts from folks around the world I understand understand I understand why God don't have time to talk to me 24 hours a day there's so many other people in the message you spend all of his time with he ain't got time for somebody like me or at least to hear them tell it and most of those people will never amount to nothing in god they're spiritually arrogant spiritually proud and most you know people God said God said God said listen carefully to what they're saying God said most of what Muslims say is it's all the time stuff God's saying about them how great they are how wonderful they are what they're going to be in that amazing God didn't treat Jeremiah that way God spoke to Jeremiah God spoke to syke God spoke to Jose of God spoke to Amos he can spend all that time by the field since you're my you're one the businessmen out there well let's just go eat lunch together come on man I'll tell you what I'm sure Ben Ramos let's have supper together we'll have a midnight snack together I ain't got time talk about how bad is really is that's not what a prophet does a prophet comes to rebuke folks of their sins if he's if he's the end of his prophecy he's a false prophet well a man brother Donnie that's one thing that convinces me more and more brother branham's not a false prophet because his mercy was not pointing to him it was pointing to Jesus Christ and his bride was staying together listen a joke now we'll pick it up in the morning Lord willin i abhor myself therefore i repent in sackcloth and ashes the first time is used this word repent while he's finally seeing himself as being wrong and then you can still see yourself as being wrong at times most the time all the time now believe it or not I don't feel sorry for those of you who say that I feel sorry for those of you who don't that's right because the real son or daughter of God Ballman they miss it they want God to correct they say something wrong do something wrong have a wrong attitude they want God to correct they want to be able to be corrected why because they're born of God they love his word it may burn them it may tan their hide as we say but they'll repent and cry and say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus for loving me so much I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear as my uncle and the preachers of the church that got saved in they told me he was more than one baptize me entitles the man I preached for then I came out of that and I went into Jesus only then I heard of thee by the hearing of the ear and they was wrong too then I heard about one purchase and a her book I don't really care about women painting or doing this and that and the other and Curtis told Matt not long ago she said you remember certain time in our life in Pentecost that we got to even wondering and questioning if holiness was really required by God because I left a ministry that preached it and went to a ministry that didn't and you see the same God doing the same things then you begin to question and wonder do you need it after all was it ready necessary what what was it I'd heard of thee of the hearing of the air but tonight I can say now mine I see a thing praise be to God don't you love it was so much children this is my beloved you see friends you look at me and most of you you don't know me you know already know me or not that much around me you know I'm in the pulpit you know me when I pray for you you know me when we meet back here and I counsel you on occasion that I'll meet you out or something like that one occasion I get to go out and shake hands after church if I don't have an interview so I could stand up here if to you tonight and say I love God with all of my heart I don't want to do nothing wrong if I'm wrong oh I want God to correct me I don't mean it's true you could tell me the same thing but God knows God knows each of us does he not and he manifests himself through our lives so if I ever leave the word if I ever give a selfish motive selfish objective my father knows I don't want to be here in the first place because tell me that day she said wouldn't it be something if we could just sit down you didn't have to preach no more would have to get out of the limelight as people called it I call it gunfire and they limelight it's laser light from them scopes people who think I want this position I want to be an authority you are deceived people in this message to think I want to be here you are deceived and you better get straightened out before you mind up being lost if the devil can tell you that about me and convince you I guarantee is lied to you about God as well I've been with the happiest men in this world if I could step from behind this pulpit and tonight mother Jim would be my final last sermon I could close my Bible shut my iPad shut off my computer and come to church stand outside shake hands do like the rest of you do complain about the organ to loud guitar you came here that still get to hop yeah one thing I don't understand what we're all I even play the fan for I'd be a good church member like all the rest of y'all well I like to burn up in church tonight and tell what church is about to some people growl and fuss and complain after tonight I probably will be sitting out there tomorrow but it just so happened it fell my lot in life to be right here for however long God wants me to be here another service another six years to the rapture however long will I'll leave that entirely up to him to be honest with you I'm glad he don't always grant us our desires and our requests cuz brother Branham would have never been our prophet people who want to be a prophet people who want to be a preacher want to be a pastor more than likely they're not even called it's always the man running from it not the man running toward it that's right aren't you glad God's mercy went beyond you face facts you went looking for God God come looking for you and His mercy oh praise God but this is our beloved praise God let's bow our heads together Oh Lord Jesus Heavenly Father you alone know every heart here tonight I pray you'd begin with mine search me see if you see any hypocrisy any insincerity any error in my ways Lord God I don't have to stand before men to be judged I'll stand before you right here tonight you judge me look at my heart not to sell her see if you see anything in me that displays reveal it to my lord so I can make it right Lord not only with me but search every individual here tonight Lord every man woman boy and girl mayor motives our objectives be totally surrender to Him I pray Lord that you would help each young man each young lady maybe those that have lived decades of the life for you each of us the entirety of the rest of our lives will be placed sill before you that whatever you want to do with us Lord or to him Lord I cast myself before you I say it's job involved give me an audience Lord God oh I hear brother Branham say how they like to be able to just sit down on the creek bank not have to preach anymore still be saved he said still be a Christian and nothing to his salvation but the load the poor man worked under all the criticism of a circus and that he had to deal with constantly I don't say he took it Lord but your grace helped him I'm glad you didn't give him what he wanted because he didn't want to be Malachi 4 he didn't want to be a prophet he did not want to be a man that would bring rebuke to people as a matter of fact I heard him said the other day things of value come of great price they said it costs me something to bring this message I'm sure we won't know till we get there to see the value of the cost of what it was Lord Jesus were thankful he was willing to do and we know that's the kind of people you use so help each of us tonight whether it's a musician a singer I imagine some of these musicians some of these Deacons trustees I'd say brother Jim Babb has topped up his resignation time and time again whether it's made it to the computer or just in his mind or in his dreams he's probably dreamed about giving me his resignation and him just shout screaming and hollering no more library keys no more bookkeeping and then all of a sudden he woke up and realized it was only a dream a fairy tale in reality because Lord people are called to do something most of them don't want to do it in the first place but then we always have those around us who are chomping at the bits god I pray that you'd help those chompers to realize you're the only one that can place people help each of us father Oh Lord God more than likely unless I just get so old I can't preach no more some crippling disease or something that happened to me more than likely I'll never get to retire really I can't even grasp that I'm up at that age and people think about retiring more than likely I'll never get to do it and just as time goes on my retirement awaits me in another place but how we all long for our Father we love you tonight Jesus praise God don't you love him Saints would you just raise your hand to him to say lord help me tonight Lord you see my needs my desires help me Lord I can be what you want me to be if you want me to be a singer Lord let me sing and let my sing and be a blessing you want me to be a preacher let me preach and let my preaching be a blessing you want me to be a musician don't may be a deacon of Trustee what if you want me to be Lord let me to be a part and be it with all my heart but if you don't want me to be none of that let me to be a good church member Lord let me come here and pray and Lord clap my hands and sing and do everything that I can do Lord the big sack of what you've called me to be praise God praise God I have heard of thee with a hearing of the ear but now MA ah si si o blessed God praise the Lord Jesus can which is raise your hands in the presence of God just surrender time tonight now friends whatever you are whatever you think you are and whatever you think you are may not necessarily be what you are but just submit it all to him search my heart Lord if I've been deceived all these years and I ain't really a preacher then Lord let me know it I'll take up another trade I want to be honest lord I want to be sincere I want to be what you've called me to be Lord we're too late to play games we want to be your people praise God thank you Lord Jesus that we can still repent praise be to God hallelujah hallelujah Lord God everything something was just worshipping together now thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus oh maybe your questions have never been as severe jobs maybe you've never been quite so harsh to God but to be honest with you I wouldn't want to be I wouldn't want to be as harsh I got an email today from a brother and from thousands and thousands and thousands of miles from world we are in another country in the ancient lands he's gone through a terrible time a terrible time prolonged prolonged and prolonged I got an email from him and I tried to encourage him earlier in the week but he just got so down brother Seth with what he was going through and he just began to question God and he just began to kind of say things to God and I could just feel it and his email is he said brother Donnie I know I've heard him and I thought yeah that's what a real child of God is afraid of I've heard him I know I've heard him you ever done that no I have I've heard him brother you know who you are you'll strain this I know except God's forgiveness my brother and forgive yourself you're not God you're mortal but humble yourself hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise your name Lord Jesus Oh blessed be the name of us all thank you Lord Jesus amen look children I want the mighty God among us and miracles I don't know if they turned into testimony or not but the Matthew walked up here there they're not : trouble for weeks situations going on in his body brother JD email man think was Thursday morning so brother Donnie Matthew wanted me to share with you God performed a miracle in his body you know I don't I can't do miracles you know I can't do that these brothers who does it God does it but I don't just want him here in miracles of that nature I want him in miracles to break down our strong will and nobody may not even know it it may not be some that you turn a testimony in I've been so stubborn for 40 years I've been hard-headed for 50 God only had to beat the far out of me ain't none of us wants to turn in that testimony but it's as mirror it's a miracle just as well if God can deliver us and we ride to that spot do you understand the rapture is hinging on such preaching you want to see think it's gonna be just great jargon of rigmarole what we're going off and uttering off one mister after another after another deep preaching so-called that we don't even understand it's gonna be our lives and such harm into the Word of God and seeing who we are that's gonna get us out of here we're in the final phase friends don't let this pass over and said that what that wasn't deep that had no value it's got more value than what you realize it does much more value could be placed and on getting the soul in harmony with God [Applause] it's just worship together Kim let me say this this all resultant for yourself maybe you don't hit a perch or lay hands on me you just saying you know what Lord I just have to come up and talk talk some things over with you not ah I realize I've had a bad attitude I've questioned you over this and that in the other and I'm really sorry I just like to be mellowed in your presence the elders open maybe you don't need so much that but you need healing it's hopefully deliverance it's open we'll look at it in the morning how the word says that God come and brought deliverance to Jaffa deliverance closer delivered from his poverty his loneliness his sadness and when God delivered Jove you know what God will look at it again in the morning God spoke to his three friends and said you've not said what job said therefore take an offering and let my servant Joel pray for you the final phase of job's deliverance was praying for the friends that had ran him down and when he prayed for him God never even answered Joel brother Terry God never even responded good job well done God still remained in silence glory to God then God sent his friends to him and said pray for us job we've done wrong pray for us then the scripture says God give him double what he's had his brothers his sister's they brought a piece of money he had something they bring money after he's restored why didn't they bring it when he needed it don't misunderstand me sometimes God will cause your closest friends even separate from you but it's for your good it's when
