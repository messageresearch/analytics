[40:36] control praise the Lord I'm glad we
[40:39] serve such a mighty God tonight let us
[40:42] turn if you would to book of Psalms
[40:45] chapter 42 please verse
[40:47] 5 Psalms
[40:50] 42 verse
[40:55] 5 I want to speak to you tonight on
[40:59] freedom from nervousness all right
[41:03] freedom from
[41:06] nervousness Psalm
[41:09] 425 why art thou cast down oh my
[41:16] soul why art thou
[41:20] disquieted in me look at the meaning of
[41:23] this word to
[41:25] murmur growl
[41:29] Roar cry
[41:31] aloud
[41:33] mourn
[41:36] rage
[41:38] sound make
[41:40] noise be
[41:42] clamorous being an
[41:44] uproar have I covered everybody
[41:48] yet being an uproar to be in a
[41:53] stir be in a
[41:55] commotion or be tur
[41:58] turbulent
[42:00] wow why art thou
[42:03] disqui in me hope thou in God for I
[42:10] shall
[42:12] yet praise him for the help of his
[42:17] countenance so you can imagine now the
[42:20] psalmist David one of the men that if
[42:24] anybody knew the key of praise it was
[42:27] him but he reached a spot in his life
[42:31] where he couldn't praise like he could
[42:33] before notice how he words this for he
[42:37] said I shall
[42:39] yet praise him right now I'm at the spot
[42:44] that I'm struggling trying to do it he
[42:46] said but I
[42:48] will I will I love that attitude don't
[42:52] you for I shall yet praise him for the
[42:57] help of his
[43:00] countenance oh my God my soul is cast
[43:05] down Within Me therefore will I remember
[43:09] thee from the land of
[43:12] Jordan and
[43:16] from of the
[43:18] hermit and from the hill of
[43:22] myar I don't have a clue where that was
[43:25] on the entire face of the Earth cuz that
[43:26] was the only place place in the Bible I
[43:27] could ever even find that name so I
[43:29] don't know where David was even at but
[43:32] look where his where his soul is he's
[43:35] just so cast down in Psalm
[43:40] 61:2 from the end of the Earth will I
[43:43] cry unto thee when my
[43:46] heart is overwhelmed yes sir Glory yes
[43:52] sir look at the meaning of this word to
[43:56] envelop
[43:59] oneself so you mean there's things we
[44:01] actually
[44:03] self-inflict we do to
[44:05] ourself so when my heart is overwhelmed
[44:10] to envelop
[44:11] oneself to be feeble be faint grow weak
[44:17] again be faint to show
[44:20] feebleness and then to faint
[44:23] away when my heart is overwhelmed
[44:27] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[44:31] I for thou Hast been a shelter for me
[44:36] and a strong tower from the enemy I love
[44:39] verse four I will abide in thy
[44:43] Tabernacle forever I will trust in the
[44:48] covert of thy
[44:50] Wings
[44:52] sah praise the Lord I mean like to be
[44:55] remembered tonight in
[44:58] prayer praise the Lord I was just
[45:00] rejoicing as I heard Brother Louie um
[45:04] sharing the different testimonies and um
[45:07] sister Brenda how the Lord had moveed
[45:09] for her and I thought my goodness
[45:12] through prayer she was able to sleep 14
[45:14] hours I think I need to start praying
[45:16] for
[45:18] myself maybe not 14 but eight would be
[45:22] nice but I I just want to say that I've
[45:25] heard so many
[45:27] wonderful
[45:29] deliverances from the service right here
[45:31] Wednesday night from people all over
[45:34] everywhere it shows us that our God is
[45:38] mindful of us is he not so whatever our
[45:41] needs are tonight let's just hold them
[45:43] there before the
[45:44] Lord Heavenly Father we've gathered here
[45:47] again
[45:48] tonight to see your Mighty power on
[45:53] display father the way we understand it
[45:57] you're just as much a God on Wednesday
[46:00] night as you are on Sunday morning or
[46:03] any other day out of the
[46:05] week Lord we Rejoice for what we saw you
[46:09] do here
[46:10] Wednesday and there will still be others
[46:13] that will recognize that thing that has
[46:16] tormented them has left them it might be
[46:20] a few days might even be a week or so
[46:24] before they realize it and one day it'll
[46:27] just come to them and they'll think I'm
[46:30] not even feeling the way I did
[46:32] before so Lord God we open our hearts to
[46:35] your word tonight would you speak to us
[46:38] father we have many needs and we know
[46:40] that our God is mindful of each of them
[46:43] help me Lord Jesus I pray help the
[46:46] people to be able to pull and help me to
[46:49] be able to be submissive to that I pray
[46:52] father speak to us from your great word
[46:54] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[46:56] ask it and the Saints said amen amen God
[47:00] bless you you may be
[47:04] seated and I think one of the greatest
[47:07] the worst things that can happen to us
[47:10] is that when Satan goes to putting
[47:13] things on us whether it's physical
[47:17] whether it's spiritual whatever it is
[47:20] that we begin to accept those things and
[47:24] just believe that this
[47:27] is the new norm and I have to remain
[47:30] this way well I guess I'm getting old so
[47:33] getting older you know they say that
[47:35] nervousness comes with it and where does
[47:38] the bible say that because you get old
[47:40] that you got to be nervous where does
[47:43] the bible say that well you know blood
[47:45] pressure run in your family but wait a
[47:47] minute I thought I'm born of another
[47:48] family so I'm afraid that many times the
[47:52] things that we sign for is nothing but
[47:55] the devil that's trying to get us to
[47:57] compromise on what God has already done
[48:00] for us as his children and for us to
[48:03] just accept it because the devil sends
[48:06] it upon us it makes no sense to me
[48:09] because our lord Jesus has already
[48:12] suffered Stripes so that we could be
[48:14] healed the chastisement of my peace was
[48:18] put upon him so why should he go through
[48:21] that chastisement and then me go through
[48:24] torment of something he's already paid
[48:26] the price for I mean somebody help me to
[48:29] understand that tonight if he's already
[48:32] paid the price why shouldn't I enjoy the
[48:34] full benefit of what I am as a son or
[48:38] you as a son and daughter of God is that
[48:40] right now I want you to notice here in
[48:42] Psalm 143 that David said for the enemy
[48:46] has persecuted my soul he has smitten my
[48:51] life down to the ground he has made me
[48:54] to dwell in darkness as those that have
[48:59] been long dead now they didn't know very
[49:02] much about the grave and they certainly
[49:05] didn't know very much about death by the
[49:08] time this was written and they they used
[49:10] one of the Hebrew words that was sheld
[49:12] which was a place of Darkness so they
[49:16] wasn't really sure where a man went but
[49:18] all they knew was that the body life had
[49:21] left it and they were in a world that
[49:23] they were not aware of so they throw
[49:26] dirt in the face or they put them in a
[49:28] rock tomb and they would put the rock
[49:30] face over the top of it and it was dark
[49:33] so they just assumed by that that
[49:35] wherever it was that the spiritual part
[49:38] went that it was in a place of darkness
[49:40] and David had found himself spiritually
[49:44] yet alive but feeling as if though he
[49:47] had entered into some type of Darkness
[49:51] now let me start this tonight by this
[49:53] saying that when God made the angels of
[49:58] God that God made them each one a little
[50:03] bit different now they were created in
[50:06] hierarchy they were created where they
[50:10] would have a particular position in the
[50:14] powers that they were partakers of so
[50:17] there were seraphim there was zoons
[50:21] there was cherubims there was different
[50:23] classes of angels there were elect
[50:26] angels and then there were angels that
[50:28] were actually created and they were
[50:31] created and put in a period of probation
[50:35] probation now father knew what those
[50:38] angels would do what they would do but
[50:42] remember they were not elect Angels but
[50:45] they were angels that were created out
[50:48] of this element of time because father
[50:51] knew the way they would go now they know
[50:54] were not made like you and I was s in
[50:57] them but they were born or created where
[50:59] with the capability to choose wrong and
[51:03] that way they were put in a probationary
[51:06] time that they could choose what they
[51:09] wanted to do so we can see the
[51:11] attributes of these angels after they
[51:14] fell that they had different makeups or
[51:18] characters or traits about them so when
[51:22] Satan needed then these beings that
[51:26] would help him carry out what he wanted
[51:28] to do he could not create demons he
[51:31] could not create Fallen Angels so he had
[51:34] to take what God had created and tried
[51:37] to pull them away from their original
[51:40] position in God now they were made where
[51:43] they could fall the non-elect were they
[51:47] were made where they could fall so they
[51:50] could fall from their original estate
[51:54] then when they fell they were put in to
[51:56] a realm of everlasting chains of
[52:00] Darkness now they can move about in the
[52:03] fourth dimension they can go down to the
[52:06] regions of the lost they can still
[52:09] actually have an access Up Before the
[52:12] Throne of God remember whenever Micaiah
[52:16] the prophet saw and there was an evil
[52:19] spirit that went Before the Throne of
[52:21] God and said if you will let me I will
[52:24] go down there and become a lying spirit
[52:27] in the mouths of them prophets and he
[52:30] said how will you do this and he told
[52:32] him he said go so father allowed now an
[52:37] angel of God could never have done this
[52:40] but this Fallen Angel which had still
[52:44] obtained a position of hierarchy he was
[52:48] be able to submit what he was now keep
[52:52] this in mind that when country music
[52:55] people many of them as you know started
[52:57] out in church Elvis Presley shouted in
[53:02] the Assembly of God when he backslid he
[53:05] did not lose his ability to sing so at
[53:10] one time he shouted and danced in the
[53:13] Assembly of God Church so he took that
[53:17] dance on Coliseum floors and stages and
[53:22] auditoriums and started shaking his leg
[53:26] and drove people absolutely crazy with
[53:28] it now what did he do he learned that as
[53:32] a Young Man shouting in an Assembly of
[53:35] God
[53:36] Church and he took his ability to sing
[53:40] anointed by God turned it over to the
[53:43] devil and sold his soul out to
[53:47] hell is that right now he had something
[53:51] from God an ability an anointing and yet
[53:56] none of that for any mortal that's ever
[53:59] been all of those that we could name
[54:02] that many of them started out in church
[54:04] and yet they sold out their ability to
[54:07] the devil but no mortal could ever
[54:10] compare to what one of these angels
[54:13] would have had in so much that the Bible
[54:16] called it an estate now we think of an
[54:19] estate as a home and acres and maybe
[54:22] whatever your idea an estate would be
[54:24] you know somewhere where they'd have
[54:26] Rolling Hills and and a beautiful white
[54:29] fence and you know if you're a horse
[54:31] person horses all over if you're an
[54:33] Angus person or you know whatever you
[54:35] are you got that in your mind but Angels
[54:38] had an estate as well so an estate would
[54:42] have been a declared Portion by which
[54:45] they were given a part of that once they
[54:48] forfeited that then the estate was taken
[54:51] from them and they were put into chains
[54:54] of everlasting Darkness res deserved
[54:57] until the time of their punishment but
[55:00] they have access by the fourth dimension
[55:03] to be able to come back and forth so
[55:05] they can appear they can disappear Satan
[55:08] himself still has the ability to
[55:11] transform himself and appear as an angel
[55:15] of Light so he is the king of demons but
[55:19] he can make himself appear as an angel
[55:23] of Light so he could appear and take on
[55:26] an image that would look like Jesus
[55:30] Christ is that right oh sure don't you
[55:32] remember St Martin whenever he appeared
[55:35] to him and told him he said don't you
[55:36] know me Martin I'm the Lord Jesus now
[55:39] you talking about the king of Hypocrites
[55:43] that he would come to St Martin and say
[55:46] don't you know me I'm Jesus your savior
[55:49] why nothing but a balac liar but what
[55:52] did he want he once worshiped so bad
[55:56] that he would appear in the name of
[55:59] Jesus and try to get one of God's
[56:02] servants to worship him because he wants
[56:05] to be praised that desperately but this
[56:08] prophet of course recognized him and
[56:11] identified him by the word so whenever
[56:15] the prophet now preaches about
[56:17] demonology now whenever you read the
[56:20] little book there called demonology part
[56:23] of it was actually preached in
[56:25] Connorsville IND the
[56:27] in
[56:27] 1953 part one part two and then enticing
[56:31] Spirits which was preached in
[56:34] 1955 which was preached a couple years
[56:36] later in Jeffersonville and then they
[56:39] put it together and they entitled it the
[56:41] demonology series uh the prophet goes
[56:44] into it about demons and gives us a view
[56:48] into the realm of what they are like for
[56:51] our first time we have a glimpse of what
[56:54] they really were how they worked even
[56:56] their appearance sometime sometimes like
[56:59] hair hanging off their legs others like
[57:01] a a tortoise shell with legs hanging up
[57:04] and others would be of a vapor of of a
[57:08] darkness of a stream whatever they were
[57:10] and yet some of them were sent more or
[57:13] less to in the political realm well they
[57:16] they they really have a big time in
[57:18] election year don't they yeah they
[57:20] really do and that's what anoints all
[57:23] these politicians to tell all these lies
[57:26] and I'll tell you why people believes
[57:28] them because many people get under that
[57:32] political spirit and then the leader of
[57:35] their party whoever it is Republican or
[57:37] Democrat because the devil owns both of
[57:38] them and controls from the majority of
[57:40] both sides so that demon then on the
[57:44] Democrat Party will anoint their main
[57:47] person and then all their spokesmen and
[57:49] they'll get all the people all riled up
[57:52] and then the demon on the Republican
[57:54] party will get them all riled up and
[57:56] they'll make all these promises knowing
[57:59] that there's no way they can even do it
[58:02] anyway some of the things both sides are
[58:05] promising us right now neither of them
[58:09] have the power nor the authority to do
[58:12] what they are saying because Congress
[58:15] will have to do part of it the Senate
[58:17] will have to do part of it come on don't
[58:19] get quiet on me now you know it's the
[58:21] truth but why is it that people believe
[58:25] them why why because people get under
[58:28] that anointing and that lying political
[58:32] demon will get on that spokesperson and
[58:35] they'll get in these big rallies and
[58:37] they'll hoop and holler and this and
[58:39] that and the other and my goodness
[58:41] within six months or a year a lot of
[58:43] them promises are made people forget
[58:45] about it they don't even expect them to
[58:47] do it why that demonic thing that was on
[58:51] them has totally backed off of them now
[58:54] and they don't even hold that politician
[58:57] to their promise but you see the
[58:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost when it
[59:01] falls on a Believer and anoints a man of
[59:05] God to preach the word or anoints you as
[59:07] you're listening to a tape from the
[59:09] prophet of God the spirit of God will
[59:12] hold God accountable to his promise in
[59:15] your heart and the spirit of God in you
[59:19] will never let one word of God ever fall
[59:22] to the ground and you'll remind God
[59:25] every day if you have to until God
[59:27] brings that to pass why because you're
[59:30] not Anointed with a lying Spirit now if
[59:34] you're knowing with a lying spirit and a
[59:36] lying spirit will let you hear that
[59:39] promise and then you'll forget about it
[59:41] oh well God can't do it God ain't got
[59:43] the power to do it that shows you we not
[59:45] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[59:47] because the Holy Ghost once he quickens
[59:49] the word to you that word is yours for
[59:52] eternity and you will in your soul never
[59:56] let God go you'll be on his hands from
[1:00:00] the time you hear that word until it's
[1:00:02] manifested in your life so when God made
[1:00:06] these angels I don't believe every one
[1:00:08] of them are exactly alike no more than
[1:00:10] we are and the prophet tells us actually
[1:00:12] in heaven when we all get there that
[1:00:15] we're not all going to be the same
[1:00:17] there'll be red heads blackheads blondes
[1:00:19] there'll be all kinds of different
[1:00:20] people all different kinds of people
[1:00:22] with skin colors that are different
[1:00:24] because God is the god of variety well
[1:00:28] you can watch these angels now and if
[1:00:31] you'll see them
[1:00:32] categorically when they are manifested
[1:00:35] in the fourth dimension how that they
[1:00:38] will have a certain effect on people's
[1:00:41] lives now I not only study the message
[1:00:44] from the doctrinal point but also study
[1:00:46] it from the point of discernment because
[1:00:50] nowhere else in the Bible do we get a PE
[1:00:53] a peer open Vision in into the realm of
[1:00:57] the way these demons acted and the way
[1:01:00] they talked and the way they behaved now
[1:01:03] we get a few examples of course in the
[1:01:04] New Testament where they would talk and
[1:01:06] say things outright but yet in this last
[1:01:09] day we have even a greater Vision
[1:01:12] because it was actually the ministry of
[1:01:14] the Lord Jesus himself reincarnated in
[1:01:17] his church in the last days is that
[1:01:20] right that's why the prophet of God
[1:01:22] could say it I'm going go ahead and say
[1:01:23] it tonight it chokes some people Absol
[1:01:26] his death but he said the Lord Jesus had
[1:01:29] more success in his ministry than he did
[1:01:32] his
[1:01:33] own well if you understand that you
[1:01:35] should be able to say Amen the Lord
[1:01:37] Jesus had more success in Jeffersonville
[1:01:41] than he did in Jerusalem the Lord Jesus
[1:01:45] had more success in Jeffersonville than
[1:01:48] he did Nazareth praise the Lord I did
[1:01:51] say the Lord Jesus not brother Brandon
[1:01:54] because it was the Lord Jes Jesus using
[1:01:57] his Prophet at the returning of the son
[1:01:59] of man of Luke 17:30 now he chose to do
[1:02:03] that himself so we're able to see then
[1:02:06] into that realm how that these things
[1:02:09] manifest themselves so when we look at
[1:02:12] anxieties we looked at it the other
[1:02:14] night and we looked at oppression and
[1:02:17] depression and some of these things are
[1:02:19] very very similar but yet they still
[1:02:21] have a differentiation about them and
[1:02:24] you can see by the discernment and as I
[1:02:27] said I will study the discernments and
[1:02:29] watch them as they start back in
[1:02:32] 1947 and then go on down right to the
[1:02:34] end of 65 and you will watch people that
[1:02:37] are called out in different states and
[1:02:40] different time zones different years and
[1:02:43] you will see
[1:02:44] similarities of the way this demon would
[1:02:48] make them out now for instance say a
[1:02:50] person that would have a nervous demon
[1:02:53] on them and I found it over and over
[1:02:55] over again that it would hit them for
[1:02:59] the most part the worst time of the day
[1:03:02] would be in the evening time and that
[1:03:04] nervous demon also it would make them
[1:03:08] shaky depending on whether it was an
[1:03:10] internal nervousness or what he called a
[1:03:13] a mental nervousness and they would over
[1:03:16] and over again by discernment whether
[1:03:19] there a man or woman he would tell them
[1:03:21] I see you you dropped a cup or you
[1:03:24] dropped a glass or you drop a saucer now
[1:03:28] he would see them nine times out of 10
[1:03:30] he would see them standing up and he
[1:03:33] would see them get really weak and
[1:03:35] watching them shake and then they would
[1:03:38] drop something then whenever they would
[1:03:40] drop something then a weakness would
[1:03:43] actually hit them now depending on which
[1:03:47] type that it was whether it was in the
[1:03:49] psyche or whether it was in the nerves
[1:03:50] which runs through the body itself the
[1:03:53] reaction would be a little bit different
[1:03:55] now you realize when you're looking at
[1:03:57] that that you're looking at a family
[1:04:00] trait in the world of demons so then
[1:04:03] these demons that couldn't be the main
[1:04:06] the same one that would be able to
[1:04:08] affect people all over the world and
[1:04:10] people that would be in Oakland
[1:04:11] California somebody be in Phoenix
[1:04:13] somebody be at the indicot shoe
[1:04:15] Auditorium in New York and yet the same
[1:04:18] thing would be this similar attribute
[1:04:21] over and over again so Satan then
[1:04:24] coupled or grou pooped these demons with
[1:04:27] certain makeup that would be very
[1:04:30] suitable for this type of disease that
[1:04:32] disease that disease that disease and
[1:04:35] they would also be able to communicate
[1:04:38] one with the other uh political Devils
[1:04:41] they are jealous of one another and they
[1:04:44] love to fight Victory Day 1963 uh you
[1:04:47] can find the prophet saying that that
[1:04:49] that's what causes Wars because the
[1:04:52] spirit of one nation gets jealous of
[1:04:55] another together so the war in Ukraine
[1:04:58] and Russia and all that that's been
[1:05:00] going going on now for quite some time
[1:05:02] so the spirit of Russia got jealous of
[1:05:05] the spirit of Ukraine then they begin to
[1:05:08] anoint the leaders and the leaders got
[1:05:11] into the this big turmoil and that's
[1:05:14] what's going on now whenever we look at
[1:05:16] the wars and we look at the dictators
[1:05:19] and so on this men that there's demons
[1:05:22] that are chosen for certain powers
[1:05:25] remember when Daniel had prayed and he
[1:05:27] prayed and waited and waited and he he
[1:05:31] couldn't understand what in the world
[1:05:32] was going on finally the angel of God
[1:05:34] came down and said oh Daniel greatly
[1:05:36] beloved to the Lord your prayer was
[1:05:38] heard from the first day and then here
[1:05:41] it's 21 days later but now the angel
[1:05:44] gives him an Insight of what was going
[1:05:46] on so the angel of God ascended down
[1:05:49] over the kingdom of Persia because now
[1:05:52] Persia was the ruling power Gentile
[1:05:54] power and this demon the Kings would say
[1:05:58] or the potentate over the domain of
[1:06:01] Persia had hindered the angel of God
[1:06:05] from coming down to Daniel now can you
[1:06:08] imagine it was a fallen angel but he
[1:06:12] still had a hierarchy that was a little
[1:06:15] bit higher than an angel which had not
[1:06:19] Fallen now listen friends if an angel of
[1:06:23] God could not break through a demonic
[1:06:26] power I'm telling you tonight you and I
[1:06:30] cannot do it on our own it takes the
[1:06:33] Holy Ghost to help us well come on
[1:06:36] somebody and sometimes it will take even
[1:06:39] more than just you having the Holy Ghost
[1:06:42] sometimes you need other people to pray
[1:06:44] with you or you might need a man of God
[1:06:46] to cast that thing away from you now he
[1:06:49] gives Daniel an Insight of what was
[1:06:51] going on so he's wrestling with that
[1:06:54] angel Now find that this angel that was
[1:06:57] sent from heaven could not break through
[1:07:00] so what happened a noted Angel which was
[1:07:04] Michael Michael came down and actually
[1:07:08] delivered this other holy righteous
[1:07:12] sinless Angel and he started dealing
[1:07:15] with this Prince of Persia and when he
[1:07:18] did then this Angel was allowed to go
[1:07:21] down to Daniel and give him his message
[1:07:24] now this Angel then turns after he
[1:07:26] delivers the message to Daniel he said
[1:07:28] lo I must return and fight with the
[1:07:33] prince of
[1:07:35] grea now remember the kingdom of Greece
[1:07:40] is going to be the Greek part of the
[1:07:43] vision or the dream that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:07:45] had you remember the four Gentile
[1:07:46] Kingdoms in the image so it was not the
[1:07:50] same demon that was over Persia but it
[1:07:54] was another demon which had been chosen
[1:07:57] because apparently his traits his
[1:08:01] characteristics would match more the
[1:08:03] anointing that was needed to be able to
[1:08:06] do what God saw would be done oh I hope
[1:08:10] somebody Shar me tonight you see it's
[1:08:12] the same way in the church ages so God
[1:08:14] released a certain power in the days of
[1:08:17] the martyrs in the first church age and
[1:08:19] then we go to the second horse rider and
[1:08:22] the third and then on down what did we
[1:08:24] need we did not need a martyr anointing
[1:08:28] we did not need the lion anointing but
[1:08:30] we needed an eagle anointing so we
[1:08:34] receive what God sends us and we work
[1:08:38] under that anointing it's the same way
[1:08:41] with the kingdoms of Darkness on the
[1:08:43] other side they must have an anointing
[1:08:46] now remember in the last days that
[1:08:49] Satan's Chief demon will come upon the
[1:08:53] Earth and will actually in inhabit the
[1:08:56] body of the Antichrist before the bride
[1:09:01] goes up there will be this inhabitants
[1:09:05] that will live inside Satan's main ruler
[1:09:09] until Satan when the bride goes up and
[1:09:12] the Devil comes down then that head
[1:09:15] demon will be booted out and Satan
[1:09:18] himself will step in now think about in
[1:09:21] the world in the realm of demonology
[1:09:25] when it comes to sickness and disease
[1:09:28] there were certain adjectives that the
[1:09:30] prophet would use to describe certain
[1:09:33] Devils some of them were horrible some
[1:09:37] of them were terrible some of them the
[1:09:40] words that he would use were spooky or
[1:09:44] it would be shaky it would cause the
[1:09:47] person that it was affecting to be shaky
[1:09:51] with many of them when it would come to
[1:09:53] nervousness it would be
[1:09:55] it was about to drive them out of their
[1:09:59] mind and they would be thinking things
[1:10:02] that were contrary to them themselves
[1:10:05] and if they were Christians of course it
[1:10:07] was Saints contrary to the word of God
[1:10:10] now for those of you tonight that have
[1:10:12] never been maybe in a nervous breakdown
[1:10:16] or under a real nervous type of demon it
[1:10:20] might be easy for you to criticize
[1:10:23] someone who's working under that and
[1:10:26] this is something that I found repeated
[1:10:28] over and over again that brother
[1:10:30] brandham would by discernment would tell
[1:10:32] different people that people have told
[1:10:35] you to get next to
[1:10:38] yourself right but you can't he
[1:10:42] said so it was amazing that again it
[1:10:46] reoccurred over and over again so it was
[1:10:49] out of this family more than likely
[1:10:51] wasn't the same demon but it was demons
[1:10:54] that were of a
[1:10:55] spirit so they would get on this person
[1:10:58] that one that one that one that one and
[1:11:00] their family their loved ones maybe
[1:11:02] their Pastor whoever was said brother
[1:11:04] you've got to get next to yourself
[1:11:06] sister you've got to get next to
[1:11:08] yourself Shake yourself out of that and
[1:11:11] yet the prophet did not rebuke them he
[1:11:14] would tell them they couldn't do it yeah
[1:11:17] now remember there's a difference
[1:11:19] between being
[1:11:21] nervous and having a nervous demon come
[1:11:25] on
[1:11:25] all of us can get nervous at times
[1:11:29] praise the lord we can be nervous about
[1:11:32] this or that or whatever but yet
[1:11:34] whenever that certain occasion will stop
[1:11:38] or change then our nerves calm down and
[1:11:41] we're able to reach an element of
[1:11:43] normaly again but if a person is
[1:11:47] Anointed with a
[1:11:51] demon they
[1:11:54] cannot make their s come to their
[1:11:57] senses they cannot with their own
[1:12:01] power cause this thing to
[1:12:04] leave they cannot with their own power
[1:12:08] make theirself of a sound mind
[1:12:14] right
[1:12:15] amen if there's anybody left here
[1:12:18] tonight in the building that's still
[1:12:19] fighting this if you'll believe it while
[1:12:22] I'm preaching you can be delivered right
[1:12:24] now
[1:12:25] amen for he sent his word and healed
[1:12:29] them
[1:12:30] amen but to the person who is dealing
[1:12:35] with it it's you know oppression and
[1:12:39] depression and some of these things can
[1:12:41] be very very similar but what's amazing
[1:12:44] is that a Prophet by discernment can be
[1:12:47] able to go in and be able to divide and
[1:12:51] separate things where a CT scan and MRI
[1:12:55] whatever would never never be able to
[1:12:57] touch it now I want you to notice this
[1:13:00] that this one here the angel of God well
[1:13:04] now here's what happens she gets real
[1:13:06] nervous spells but mainly a
[1:13:10] mental
[1:13:13] psychic
[1:13:14] condition see feeling she gets worried
[1:13:18] at first it's like an old piece of you
[1:13:21] feel like you're going to lose your mind
[1:13:24] isn't that that the way you've been
[1:13:26] feeling there's something haunting
[1:13:28] haunting
[1:13:30] listen there's something haunting this
[1:13:34] lady that makes her feel that
[1:13:37] way but now it's lifted it's gone the
[1:13:43] lady can go home and be normal now
[1:13:46] notice go on your road Rejoice just
[1:13:51] start praising God and thank you dear
[1:13:55] God all that gloomy feeling will be gone
[1:13:59] now as of this present tense when this
[1:14:03] discernment is unfolding the demon had
[1:14:07] left but he left a
[1:14:10] remnant of this feeling that was still
[1:14:14] there now
[1:14:16] listen people will then go and say well
[1:14:20] I felt better a little bit I felt a
[1:14:23] little bit better but that but that
[1:14:24] feeling is not gone and and I must not
[1:14:27] be no better don't you go that way
[1:14:29] friends that thing will try its best to
[1:14:32] come
[1:14:34] back now I want you to notice in several
[1:14:37] of these that we're going to look at
[1:14:38] tonight that that God many times would
[1:14:42] tell the people that they would have to
[1:14:45] do certain things to make their healing
[1:14:49] complete I want you to watch what he
[1:14:52] tells this individual now now you go on
[1:14:56] your road and rejoice but this
[1:15:00] individual is still feeling
[1:15:02] gloomy how do you rejoice when you're
[1:15:06] gloomy you rejoice over the top of it
[1:15:09] that's right you praise over the top of
[1:15:11] it you sing over the top of it you
[1:15:15] preach don't we preachers over the top
[1:15:19] of being gloomy now watch in Mark 2:1
[1:15:23] but that you may not that the son of man
[1:15:26] have power on Earth to forgive sins for
[1:15:29] he saith to the sick of the PCY I say
[1:15:33] unto thee arise and take up thy bed and
[1:15:38] go thy way un thine house now the Lord
[1:15:41] Jesus has already done something but
[1:15:44] Lance what if this
[1:15:46] man would have laid
[1:15:49] there what if this man would have laid
[1:15:52] there and said I'm not going to do it's
[1:15:55] on the Sabbath day I can't do that I'm
[1:15:57] tired I I don't have my strengths back
[1:16:00] yet I I don't want to cause no
[1:16:03] trouble if he had not obeyed the Lord
[1:16:07] let me tell you why some people lose
[1:16:09] their healing they don't do what they're
[1:16:12] instructed to
[1:16:14] do praise the Lord I say unto thee arise
[1:16:19] and take up thy bed and go thy way into
[1:16:22] thy house and immediate ly he arose took
[1:16:27] up the bed and went Force before them
[1:16:30] all in so much that they were all amazed
[1:16:33] and glorified God so when did the
[1:16:36] manifestation of the miraculous happen
[1:16:39] when the natural be to move the
[1:16:43] Supernatural come in and Anointed The
[1:16:45] Natural so but of course we always want
[1:16:49] God to move supernaturally first I
[1:16:52] wonder would this miracle have happened
[1:16:55] happened had this man not put forth an
[1:16:59] effort oh my my and they glorified God
[1:17:04] saying we never saw it on this fashion I
[1:17:07] guarantee you they didn't notice again
[1:17:09] in John chapter 9 verse six when he had
[1:17:12] thus spoken he spat on the ground and
[1:17:14] made clay of the spittle and he Anointed
[1:17:16] The Eyes of the blind man with the clay
[1:17:18] and said unto him go go wash in the of
[1:17:25] Silo which is by interpretation said he
[1:17:29] went his way therefore and washed and
[1:17:33] came seeing remember he was not seeing
[1:17:38] when he
[1:17:40] left I wonder if the reason we've missed
[1:17:44] some of our
[1:17:46] Miracles is because we didn't obey come
[1:17:50] on and the man of God go brother believe
[1:17:53] praise him with all your heart
[1:17:55] and yet you don't do that I said well
[1:17:58] brother Dy Pray For Me Brother D pray
[1:18:00] brother Joel Brown these other brothers
[1:18:02] they pray for me I I didn't get nothing
[1:18:04] did you do what they told you to
[1:18:10] do he did not leave brother John seeing
[1:18:15] immediately the man was not only blind
[1:18:17] he had mud in his eyes how would you
[1:18:19] like if somebody spit on the ground that
[1:18:21] certainly wouldn't be sanitary would it
[1:18:22] and they spit on the ground and make up
[1:18:25] oh my and make a mess and rub it on your
[1:18:28] face and say go to the pool of salom are
[1:18:29] you kidding me I ain't got no GPS I
[1:18:32] don't know where it's even at am I going
[1:18:34] to get there I don't know how to get
[1:18:36] there but you know what that man may
[1:18:37] have stumbled along and he may have
[1:18:39] pressed through all the people life and
[1:18:41] look at him why poor old God that
[1:18:43] preacher rubbed M spit and the dirt and
[1:18:46] rubbed it on his eyes and look at him
[1:18:48] he's doing it no doubt that have called
[1:18:50] him a cult follower that have said the
[1:18:52] man has lost his mind but I like what
[1:18:55] the Bible said he come back see life at
[1:18:59] me ricu me but one day you'll say he
[1:19:02] come back
[1:19:05] changed Oh Glory to God thank you Lord
[1:19:09] Jesus M John 11:9 Jesus
[1:19:16] said take ye away the stone Martha the
[1:19:21] sister of Martha the sister of him that
[1:19:24] was dead said unto him Lord by this time
[1:19:27] he stinketh for he's now been dead 4
[1:19:29] days would the miracle have
[1:19:32] happened if they would have said there's
[1:19:34] no way it'll make a mess if I do this
[1:19:36] everybody's going to life of a suanti
[1:19:38] you be terrible you imagine now the
[1:19:41] temperatures the way they are there and
[1:19:43] a body being laying out for 4 days in a
[1:19:46] place like that it would have been
[1:19:47] absolutely
[1:19:49] horrific but they did as he said and the
[1:19:53] resurrection came came after they did
[1:19:57] their part the resurrection did not come
[1:20:01] first but after they obeyed his
[1:20:05] word praise be to
[1:20:09] God now let's let's get into a
[1:20:13] little combat

[1:34:46] the same thing they said about Jesus
[1:34:49] well come on somebody but the very thing
[1:34:52] they say where he got off of to us is
[1:34:55] the mystery of God the signs and the
[1:34:57] Wonders was nothing but bait on the hook
[1:35:00] it started out fishing with a little
[1:35:02] bitty old thing but it got bigger and

[1:36:42] it amazing the spirit of God is didn't
[1:36:44] always immediately take all of it away
[1:36:46] God's got a point he's trying to prove
[1:36:49] he wants to prove to the devil there
[1:36:51] some of my children I'll have them pray
[1:36:53] for and they'll believe me they don't
[1:36:55] feel better but they're still confessing
[1:36:57] the word they don't feel one bit better
[1:37:00] than they did the night before but their
[1:37:02] confession is by his stripes I am
[1:37:05] healed they may be worse the next day
[1:37:08] the next week and two weeks after that

[1:37:21] her come out of her
[1:37:25] in Jesus
[1:37:28] name now listen friends I don't mind
[1:37:30] telling you I've dealt with
[1:37:32] demons the entirety of my
[1:37:35] Ministry even when I was in
[1:37:38] Pentecost I don't like
[1:37:40] them I'd best rather hang out with
[1:37:46] angels but yet we realize that in this
[1:37:49] Warfare that we're
[1:37:51] in Satan wants to hide him
[1:37:54] himself
[1:37:57] mhm but this word exposes
[1:38:01] him what's this lady standing before me
[1:38:04] is a Christian She's suffering with a
[1:38:06] blood pressure she's really nervous
[1:38:08] she's got a gallbladder trouble and
[1:38:11] nervous upset brings her to a blood
[1:38:15] pressure and there's something strange
[1:38:18] about
[1:38:19] you you you've accepted your healing
[1:38:22] once before four on the same
[1:38:26] thing but you got too Hy with
[1:38:33] it
[1:38:36] wow so you mean a person after they're
[1:38:39] healed they got to be careful with their
[1:38:44] attitude I thought this was absolutely
[1:38:46] amazing I don't remember ever ran across
[1:38:48] this until the other day you accepted
[1:38:50] your healing once before in the same
[1:38:52] thing but you got too bodyy with it like
[1:38:55] and got away and by the way you're a
[1:38:58] missionary or you've been a missionary I
[1:39:00] see another man and that's your husband
[1:39:04] he's a Pentecostal
[1:39:06] preacher he was a Pentecostal
[1:39:10] preacher but is in
[1:39:15] glory isn't it amazing how dimensional
[1:39:18] travel can reflect itself through eyes
[1:39:21] that are dimensional
[1:39:24] so I see this
[1:39:25] man he was past since Pentecostal
[1:39:28] preacher but he's in
[1:39:33] glory glory you're still you got
[1:39:37] something in your
[1:39:38] mind you're trying to figure out what
[1:39:41] you must do with the rest of your life
[1:39:44] again the invitation is
[1:39:48] open come on believe the signers show
[1:39:52] up show us your signs come
[1:39:56] on you cowardly preachers that pulled

[1:40:29] must do with the rest of your life and
[1:40:31] you're trying to make a
[1:40:34] decision and you feel that you're to go
[1:40:36] East out here toward the eastern states
[1:40:40] to finish Lord have mercy yeah this is
[1:40:44] prophecy brother sister it's not yeah
[1:40:47] the Lord say I'm here and I'm good and
[1:40:48] I'm here to bless you and I'm here to do
[1:40:50] this this is the kind of God I'm talking
[1:40:52] about this is the kind of gifts I want
[1:40:54] to see in our church uhhuh and the
[1:40:57] prophet of God said that there was
[1:40:58] tongues and interpretation in his church
[1:41:00] and he said it would actually help his
[1:41:02] gift because in tongues an
[1:41:04] interpretation is like a church
[1:41:06] reflection of a prophet's discernment
[1:41:09] uhhuh that's exactly what real tongues
[1:41:11] and interpretation is he said it would
[1:41:13] lighten his burden so tongues and
[1:41:16] interpretation in the church was yeah I
[1:41:18] say the Lord I'm here and I'm going to
[1:41:19] bless you and didn't I say I bless you
[1:41:21] all and didn't I say no it's actually Oh
[1:41:24] Glory to God it's the church the spirit
[1:41:27] of the Living God speaking out in the
[1:41:29] same way that it did out of our older
[1:41:32] brother well glory to God it's the same
[1:41:35] Holy Ghost through these gifts
[1:41:37] manifesting himself well come on
[1:41:39] somebody oh you say that ain't Bible I
[1:41:42] beg your pardon it is a Bible Paul said
[1:41:45] in the book of Corinthians if someone
[1:41:47] would come in and they would tell about
[1:41:49] the secret of their heart would not they
[1:41:51] say God is with you
[1:42:02] you'd think I'd be old enough now to
[1:42:04] know that these things are going to get
[1:42:06] me in
[1:42:07] trouble but I'm also old enough to say
[1:42:10] if I don't say them they're going to get
[1:42:11] me in worse
[1:42:14] trouble I think I'll pick the Lesser
[1:42:16] trouble notice this that's thus sayith
[1:42:20] the Lord
[1:42:23] what he
[1:42:26] said is that the truth is
[1:42:31] it now there's one thing about it when
[1:42:34] he says
[1:42:35] anything it's always
[1:42:40] right what he said is that the truth is
[1:42:44] it that wasn't me that was him every
[1:42:49] word true it always is

[1:46:06] their feelings you need to pull out that
[1:46:09] smile Hallelujah for the devil and say
[1:46:12] I'm Healed by Stripes by his stripes I'm
[1:46:15] Healed and you are defeated devil but he
[1:46:18] wants you to turn that smile upside down
[1:46:21] and frown in the morning I'm frowned at
[1:46:23] 10:00 I'm frowned at the noon time but
[1:46:26] you need to start smiling the devil say
[1:46:28] good Lord what in the world's going
[1:46:33] on
[1:46:36] Hallelujah but you see a person can be
[1:46:39] in such a
[1:46:41] state with a nervous
[1:46:44] thing that they're almost out of their
[1:46:47] mind and they know they should do this
[1:46:50] and this and this and they should Shake
[1:46:53] yourself out of it and they know they
[1:46:56] should but it's like they
[1:47:01] can't First Kings chapter 19 verse1 and
[1:47:04] Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had
[1:47:06] done and was all how he had slain all
[1:47:09] the prophets with the sword and Jezebel
[1:47:12] sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so
[1:47:14] let the
[1:47:16] gods do to me and more also if I make
[1:47:19] not thy life as the life of one of them
[1:47:21] by tomorrow about this
[1:47:24] time and when he saw that he arose and
[1:47:27] went for his life you imagine a prophet
[1:47:30] of God that just killed 450 false
[1:47:32] prophets and runs from one
[1:47:34] denominational
[1:47:36] Church the old mother
[1:47:38] why the anointing had left him
[1:47:42] he's all geared up now on the anointing
[1:47:44] oh Hallelujah glory to God you false
[1:47:46] prophet you let me call fire down that
[1:47:49] I'll tell you one thing God's God
[1:47:51] hallelujah
[1:47:54] and she said you're as good as a dead
[1:47:56] man I'll have your life by tomorrow said
[1:47:59] oh Lord oh Lord have mercy I'm quitting
[1:48:02] L on and I can't go back oh no Lord have
[1:48:06] mercy you imagine people look I said
[1:48:10] that's the prophet of the
[1:48:12] age that's the man of
[1:48:17] God when he saw that he arose and went
[1:48:20] for his life and came to berseba which
[1:48:22] belongs into Judah left his servant
[1:48:25] there but he himself won a Day's Journey
[1:48:28] in the wilderness so remember he's all
[1:48:29] by himself now which is the worst place
[1:48:32] you can be in such a
[1:48:34] situation and came and sat down under a
[1:48:36] juniper tree and he requested for
[1:48:39] himself that he might
[1:48:43] die he did not want to
[1:48:46] live another day
[1:48:53] a young
[1:48:55] sister just a few days
[1:48:58] ago having had a baby a while
[1:49:01] back went through this depression as
[1:49:04] some mothers can
[1:49:08] do took her
[1:49:12] life maybe her husband didn't
[1:49:15] know maybe her pastor didn't know other
[1:49:19] there people in the church family
[1:49:21] message girl
[1:49:23] love God real
[1:49:26] Christian but you say it's so easy for
[1:49:28] us if we we've never experienced this to
[1:49:30] point our finger I've never been here
[1:49:31] either okay I've never been here I've
[1:49:34] never felt like this before but I've
[1:49:36] dealt with thousands of people who have
[1:49:38] so I've had experience even though I've
[1:49:40] not dealt with it myself so it's easy
[1:49:43] for us to point our finger but be
[1:49:45] careful for the same judgment that you
[1:49:49] judge
[1:49:51] others hopefully that thing won't come
[1:49:53] back to
[1:49:54] you so the best thing for you to do is
[1:49:57] pray for
[1:49:58] people I don't understand why they're
[1:50:00] that way I don't understand but God you
[1:50:02] you help them you help them
[1:50:04] Lord oh my but he went a Day's Journey
[1:50:07] to the Wilderness and came and said
[1:50:09] under a generry and requested for
[1:50:10] himself that he might die and said it is
[1:50:14] enough which means much many great
[1:50:19] abounding great strong exceedingly I
[1:50:23] take no
[1:50:25] more now oh Lord take away my life for I
[1:50:30] am not
[1:50:31] better than my
[1:50:35] fathers do you know what happened to
[1:50:37] Elijah under the juniper

[1:50:43] nervous

[2:03:47] Prophet it'll have to leave her that
[2:03:50] demon was calling
[2:03:52] to that one for
[2:03:57] help you know what's
[2:04:00] sad sometimes demons are smarter than
[2:04:03] Christians Christians can get so low and
[2:04:06] so despondent and instead of reaching
[2:04:08] out to your pastor reaching out to
[2:04:10] another Christian you miss church and
[2:04:13] you stay away and you pull away from the
[2:04:15] rest at least demons have got enough
[2:04:17] sense to say help me help me
[2:04:28] that demon was calling to that one for
[2:04:31] help for
[2:04:33] help to
[2:04:35] accumulate
[2:04:39] unbelief but he's lost the
[2:04:44] battle Sher has faith is
[2:04:50] gathering faith is together that's why
[2:04:52] you don't want to go through a battle by
[2:04:53] yourself the Bible said bear one
[2:04:55] another's burdens reach out to a friend
[2:04:57] reach out to a minister reach out to a
[2:04:59] deacon somebody you got confidence in
[2:05:01] what will it do it will accumulate more
[2:05:04] faith amen accumulate more faith it'll
[2:05:07] help you I do friends as a minister I do
[2:05:11] why because sometimes you get to a spot
[2:05:14] you think you just can't make it you
[2:05:16] need somebody to stand with you to
[2:05:19] accumulate more faith
[2:05:21] [Applause]
[2:05:27] very nervous upset you're bothered it's
[2:05:29] about somebody else too it's a man that
[2:05:31] man's a

[2:05:55] brother-in-law it can even show habits

[2:06:04] the devil wants to get us to take a
[2:06:06] substitute
[2:06:08] gift uhhuh generic stuff that hits and
[2:06:12] miss and hits and he don't want this
[2:06:14] kind in the church amen he don't want
[2:06:17] this kind that'll be able to speak in
[2:06:19] tongues and interpret and call somebody
[2:06:22] out for sinning call her fooling around
[2:06:25] with somebody else's wife or fooling
[2:06:27] around with somebody who I think I'm
[2:06:29] going to preach now fing around with
[2:06:32] somebody else's husband or maybe call
[2:06:34] out a deacon for this or that or the
[2:06:36] other and maybe a preacher for this that
