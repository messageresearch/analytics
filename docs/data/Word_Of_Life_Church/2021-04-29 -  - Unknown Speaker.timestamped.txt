[31:19] test one two work better when you've got
[31:22] them on nothing
[31:26] let's turn today if you would to uh
[31:28] genesis chapter 5
[31:30] verse 21.
[31:34] i certainly want to wish all of our
[31:35] mothers happy mother's day
[31:39] certainly shouldn't be the only day in
[31:40] the week that they get an
[31:42] acknowledgement
[31:45] i if we really understood the
[31:47] position of a godly mother
[31:48] and what a mother can do do you realize
[31:51] just that one principle
[31:53] could turn this entire nation around
[31:56] if real women really stood on principles
[31:58] and the real mothers
[32:00] not just preachers and deacons and
[32:02] trustees with just
[32:03] real real mothers and be their their
[32:06] position of what god wants them to be
[32:09] genesis chapter 5 verse 21
[32:12] i wish to speak to you today on enoch
[32:17] the stone basin
[32:20] enoch the stone mason
[32:24] in enoch lived sixty and five years and
[32:27] begat mesouza
[32:29] and ian locke walked with god after he
[32:31] began the service of 300 years
[32:34] and begat sons and daughters
[32:37] all the days of enoch were 360
[32:42] and five years and enoch walked with god
[32:46] and he was not for god
[32:50] took him let's bow our heads together
[32:54] lord jesus we thank you today for your
[32:56] word we so appreciate
[32:58] the opportunity again that we can come
[33:01] together
[33:02] to assemble in your presence realizing
[33:06] lord that we are a
[33:07] privileged people that have been called
[33:09] unto you
[33:11] we know it's not through our own
[33:12] goodness any merits
[33:14] that we would be able to accomplish or
[33:15] achieve
[33:17] we ask your help your guidance your
[33:20] blessings on the service today
[33:22] lord we don't want it to be a
[33:24] protractive meeting of a
[33:26] gathering together and we show some new
[33:29] clothes that bought or
[33:31] talk about a new business deal that we
[33:33] made this week
[33:34] but we desire to receive something out
[33:37] of the service
[33:38] that will make us more like you
[33:41] people that are more surrendered to your
[33:43] will or consecrated
[33:46] help us today father may you take your
[33:48] word and
[33:49] speak to us anoint me lord but anoint
[33:51] the people as well
[33:53] in jesus christ and we pray amen and the
[33:56] saint said
[33:57] god bless you may be seated
[34:01] i'd like to read i think we read this
[34:02] last sunday but i'd like to read it to
[34:04] you again in
[34:06] verse 24 and enoch walked with god and
[34:09] he was not for god
[34:11] took him and the word took is to take
[34:15] get fetch lay hold of seas marry
[34:18] take a wife take possession
[34:22] of we know that god in writing the bible
[34:26] he had many things that was written out
[34:28] very plain and very simple
[34:30] and yet there was other things that was
[34:33] written in
[34:34] such a way that the average person could
[34:36] just pick it up like reading a newspaper
[34:38] and totally understand everything that
[34:40] god wanted to do
[34:42] god had his plan his program written
[34:45] down through the ages and he hid it many
[34:47] times
[34:48] in symbols jesus actually thanked the
[34:51] father
[34:52] that he had done it this way when he was
[34:54] here which might seem peculiar to us
[34:56] because we'd think why in the world
[34:58] would jesus thank god that he had hid it
[35:00] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[35:03] but yet that's part of god's character
[35:05] and we must take it that it's that way
[35:07] i want you to notice this an
[35:08] infallibility of god's spoken word but
[35:10] the realm says enoch enoch before the
[35:12] world the anti-living destruction
[35:14] if he wanted to show a type how could he
[35:17] do it
[35:18] he didn't want enoch to die he had to
[35:22] make
[35:22] a translation for him
[35:26] he had to make a translation for him
[35:29] god had to do it in order to make a
[35:33] type out of enoch now there was no
[35:36] written bible of course at this time
[35:40] so god wanted to take this man's life
[35:43] and write a type out of his life
[35:46] but enoch was living in a in in quite a
[35:49] terrible day as far as the condition of
[35:51] the world
[35:52] but yet the scripture tells us in
[35:53] hebrews chapter 11 verse 5
[35:55] by faith enoch was translated
[35:59] which means to remove or change to
[36:01] transpose
[36:02] two things one of which is put in the
[36:05] place
[36:06] of another to transfer to change
[36:09] to go or pass over so enoch was
[36:12] translated
[36:13] that he should not see death and was not
[36:15] found because god
[36:16] had translated him for before his
[36:19] translation
[36:20] he had this testimony that he pleased
[36:23] god now we know that enoch walked with
[36:26] god as the bible tells us here but we
[36:28] know also the bible says that noah
[36:30] walked was god
[36:31] there were different people that the
[36:33] bible actually uses his term
[36:35] that they walked with god but we know
[36:37] that there are walks
[36:38] of degrees by which a person can walk
[36:41] with god
[36:42] and in the light that they're walking
[36:43] they can please god to all that they
[36:45] know
[36:46] but enoch walked with god in a degree
[36:48] that noah could not touch or many of the
[36:50] other people
[36:51] that have lived down through time but
[36:53] enoch wasn't just a
[36:55] passive sort of fellow that just lived
[36:57] his own type of life and never really
[37:00] bothered anybody and
[37:01] you know he just believed things it was
[37:03] kind of different and peculiar and
[37:05] everybody just knew it was different it
[37:06] was kind of a hermit type of a guy
[37:08] everybody just left him alone enoch was
[37:11] a man that was a very different sort of
[37:13] a man now he was a man who prophesied
[37:16] in a two-fold way prophesied of the
[37:18] coming judgment of god
[37:19] and he prophesied of the coming of the
[37:21] saints with the lord
[37:23] but yet enoch was also a man that
[37:26] understood
[37:27] many many things about the heavenlies
[37:30] he was a man that understood many things
[37:32] about the earth
[37:33] about the moon about the sun about
[37:36] geometry
[37:37] about algebra he understood many things
[37:40] about the principles of life
[37:42] and the principles of god and how it all
[37:45] tied together
[37:46] now he was not just a man that was going
[37:48] to be charged with being a type
[37:50] to leave this world but committed to
[37:53] this
[37:54] man was going to be something totally
[37:56] different that had never been done
[37:58] before
[37:59] and that the word of god would be
[38:02] translated
[38:03] from thoughts of god those things which
[38:05] was on god's heart
[38:07] it would actually be translated and
[38:10] become
[38:10] visible into a structural form
[38:14] now this man is going to be totally
[38:15] different than noah would be is going to
[38:17] be totally different
[38:18] than any other man that's ever been on
[38:20] the earth committed to his
[38:21] charge is going to take the bible
[38:24] and to be able to put the bible in the
[38:27] second manifested form that god would
[38:30] have it upon the earth
[38:32] now you're already looking at my story
[38:34] odd
[38:36] now listen whenever whenever god
[38:39] wanted to relate it this way notice how
[38:41] brother brahman says it
[38:42] the first bible that was ever written
[38:44] was written in the skies and the zodiac
[38:46] starts off with the virgin
[38:48] i come first ends up with leo line the
[38:50] second coming he's writing his first
[38:51] bible the second bible was written
[38:55] was written by enoch
[38:58] and put in the pyramid so
[39:02] it was written by enoch so how what does
[39:04] that mean
[39:05] so it means that that enoch actually
[39:08] rewrote the bible and put it on skins or
[39:10] something like that
[39:11] and stuffed it in a corn over here and a
[39:12] corn over there and one over here and
[39:14] buried so much over it over here
[39:15] that was not what enoch was actually
[39:18] doing but enoch is going to convey
[39:21] the mystery of redemption the mystery of
[39:24] the bride
[39:25] the mystery of the king the mystery of
[39:28] the seven
[39:29] steps going up to the king's chamber the
[39:32] ark of degree
[39:33] all these different things he's going to
[39:35] hide the mystery of all of that
[39:38] in the measurements of this great great
[39:41] building
[39:42] that is going to stand there which was
[39:43] built before the flood
[39:46] it has been a memorial it withstood the
[39:48] flood
[39:49] it was stood many things has come upon
[39:51] the earth napoleon looked at the same
[39:53] thing
[39:54] moses saw the great pyramid napoleon
[39:57] come and stood as he looked turned at
[39:59] his scientists to try
[40:01] to come and understand it many great
[40:03] british scientists many scientists from
[40:05] all over the world
[40:06] have tried to understand it yet within
[40:08] it contains
[40:09] the bible it's not just a laboratory
[40:12] it's not just a place
[40:14] of scientific research but it's a place
[40:16] which holds
[40:17] the mysteries of god
[40:21] right the second bible was written he
[40:23] says was written by enoch
[40:25] and put in the pyramid the third bible
[40:28] was written the last one which is this
[40:30] one
[40:30] brother brown indicates his bible he
[40:32] passed it god always does things in
[40:34] threes god is perfect in threes
[40:36] he's perfect in father son and holy
[40:38] spirit he's perfect in justification
[40:40] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[40:42] he's perfected in threes we are in
[40:46] his making so we are perfected in three
[40:49] soul body and spirit are bodies
[40:52] controlled
[40:53] of nerves blood and of cells three
[40:57] all perfected in the three so we're all
[41:00] perfected in three so god
[41:02] had three bibles the first one of course
[41:04] was written in the stars
[41:06] and then the second one god was now
[41:08] coming to some sort of a dispensational
[41:11] change
[41:11] by which he's showing his program on the
[41:13] earth so he deals with a man
[41:15] which is a prophet this man will be able
[41:18] to lay out
[41:19] the geometric designs inside this
[41:21] pyramid the various shape
[41:23] the place that will be on the earth the
[41:25] location on the earth
[41:26] the size it will be the pyramid cubit
[41:29] the pyramid
[41:30] inches the all these things that's
[41:32] inside of that will convey
[41:34] a story of god and a sort of redemption
[41:36] now we know that god cannot write one
[41:38] bible and it'd say one thing write a
[41:40] second bible and say another
[41:42] and write a third bible and let's say
[41:43] another they've all three got to say the
[41:45] same thing
[41:46] then when those bibles are then
[41:48] expressed it will live
[41:50] out saying the same thing that what's
[41:53] been written
[41:53] wouldn't it be exactly the same thing so
[41:56] then god had something in his mind look
[41:58] at this in the ark in 1955
[42:01] he said the great pyramid that enoch
[42:03] built the last
[42:04] chamber has gone through ready for the
[42:07] king's
[42:07] chamber now he said the coming of the
[42:10] lord right in the top of the keystone
[42:12] and all the calendar of astronomy points
[42:16] right straight the stars are declaring
[42:18] it as they did the first time now watch
[42:20] this again an adoption he says
[42:22] i've often made this remark and said god
[42:24] made three bibles the first one he put
[42:25] it in the sky the zodiac
[42:27] did you ever see the zodiac what's the
[42:29] first figure in the zodiac the virgin
[42:31] when the last figure is the zodiac leo
[42:33] the lion he come the first time through
[42:35] the virgin
[42:36] and the second time is the line of the
[42:37] tribe of judah he made the next one in
[42:40] the pyramid back in the days of enoch
[42:43] when they made the pyramid they measure
[42:45] them i don't understand it
[42:46] but to the wars where they stoop on
[42:49] their knees
[42:50] for so long and can measure the distance
[42:53] of wars
[42:54] you know where they measure to now plumb
[42:57] across
[42:58] the king's chamber
[43:02] now this is not just a tomb that some of
[43:05] you think well
[43:06] it's just a tomb for the the pharaohs of
[43:08] egypt and it was actually built by the
[43:10] egyptians and it was actually
[43:12] uh you know it was really nothing to do
[43:13] with enoch it was nothing to do with us
[43:16] no no no my friend you are totally wrong
[43:18] as a matter of fact
[43:20] it has been proven over and over again
[43:23] the egyptians at this time of the
[43:26] world's history
[43:28] were not as advanced to even understand
[43:31] geometry
[43:34] this was not made under the council of
[43:36] the egyptians
[43:38] the egyptians 1 000 years after the
[43:41] flood
[43:42] still did not understand pie and square
[43:46] and all of that because they are the
[43:48] descendants
[43:49] of ham he is the father of egypt
[43:53] but this was built under the inspiration
[43:57] of someone who understood the heavenlies
[44:00] as a matter of fact this man understood
[44:03] it so
[44:04] close that he caught the degree of the
[44:07] ark
[44:08] of the earth the curvature of the earth
[44:11] and embedded that secret inside the
[44:14] chambers
[44:15] of the great pyramid so there must be a
[44:18] significance to you and if it's the
[44:20] second bible
[44:21] now what kind of christian would i think
[44:23] you would be if you said i don't need
[44:24] the bible i don't even care about it
[44:26] i think there's something wrong with you
[44:28] well it'd be the same attitude toward
[44:30] the stars and be the same attitude
[44:31] toward the pyramid then
[44:33] because there's something in there that
[44:35] it holds a great great thing for us
[44:38] as the people of god so we'd like to
[44:40] look at the lord but help us to end some
[44:42] of the points
[44:43] about the pyramid i realize some of it
[44:45] will be just knowledge and some of it
[44:46] you won't remember till you drive
[44:48] through wendy's and get you all frosty
[44:49] and it won't mean no more to you than
[44:51] nothing but yet for a little bit
[44:52] you just try to listen and maybe you'll
[44:54] be able to get get some understanding of
[44:56] it
[44:56] the great pyramids i decided to put this
[44:59] up where you could read if you'd like to
[45:00] read along with me
[45:01] the great pyramid sets in the center of
[45:04] gravity
[45:05] of the continents it lies in the exact
[45:09] center of all the land area
[45:12] of the world now notice where this lays
[45:16] it lays in the center of the continents
[45:18] in the center
[45:19] of the gravity of the continents in the
[45:22] exact center of all the land area of the
[45:24] world
[45:25] dividing the earth's land mass into
[45:28] approximately
[45:29] four quarters the north-south axis 31
[45:33] degrees east of greenwood's
[45:34] is the longest land meridian east-west
[45:36] axis 30 degrees north is the longest
[45:38] land parallel on the globe
[45:40] there's obviously only one place at the
[45:42] longest land lines of the terrestrial
[45:44] earth
[45:44] can cross it is at the great pyramid now
[45:47] notice then
[45:48] so all these land lines the four corners
[45:51] of the earth
[45:52] they would all cross and the pyramid
[45:55] sets right
[45:55] in the middle of where they cross
[46:00] so where they cross is a story to be
[46:03] understood
[46:05] in the cross now you think then that
[46:08] they just went out there and enoch you
[46:10] know just eeny meeny miny moe where this
[46:13] rock throws is where i will go
[46:16] you think he just said some kind of
[46:17] rhyme i'm gonna throw this over my back
[46:20] and wherever it goes
[46:21] i'm gonna throw it and we'll we'll build
[46:23] this great big peculiar uh
[46:25] that ain't the way my daddy does things
[46:28] the average height of land sea level
[46:31] miami being the low the himalayas being
[46:34] the high
[46:35] can be measured only by modern day
[46:38] satellites
[46:39] and computers happens to be the same
[46:42] as the height of the pyramid
[46:46] so we'd take the low and we would take
[46:48] the high and then we would find the
[46:50] middle part of that the average line
[46:52] height then it just so happens that
[46:54] that the great pyramid now not all the
[46:56] other pyramids the state pyramids ones
[46:58] and shell in the andes and all that
[46:59] but the great pyramid is that average
[47:02] height of how this works now watch also
[47:06] the curvature
[47:07] designed in the faces of the pyramid
[47:10] exactly matches the radius of the earth
[47:14] not known until modern day technology
[47:19] was available
[47:21] [Applause]
[47:23] unless of course you're talking to the
[47:24] man who made it
[47:26] [Applause]
[47:30] he's always ahead of radar you see
[47:33] [Music]
[47:34] [Laughter]
[47:37] the measurement used by the builders
[47:40] the pyramid cubit when divided
[47:43] into the base length of the great
[47:45] pyramid is 365.242
[47:49] pyramid cubits precisely the number of
[47:52] days
[47:53] in one year a line drawn on a map
[47:57] from the apex of the pyramid to
[48:00] bethlehem
[48:01] the angle of the ascending passage
[48:05] and crosses the red sea
[48:08] and most likely the point where the
[48:09] israelites cross departing
[48:12] egypt
[48:16] i love reading stuff like this it just
[48:18] makes me know how big my father really
[48:20] is
[48:20] [Laughter]
[48:22] a line drawn on a map from the south
[48:25] from the apex of the pyramid
[48:27] at the angle of the ascending passage
[48:31] crosses mount sinai
[48:34] [Applause]
[48:36] the orientation of the great pyramid is
[48:39] within three
[48:40] quarters of an inch of true north
[48:44] a modern magnetic compass is usually far
[48:48] less accurate
[48:53] so there must have been a man
[48:57] on the earth now you realize there's
[48:59] different theories and different
[49:01] opinions of what
[49:02] what happened this some folks actually
[49:04] think that it was ufos
[49:06] that come to the earth and there was
[49:08] aliens and it was all kinds of other
[49:10] things that
[49:11] that dropped down this you know but
[49:13] aren't you glad we have a message that
[49:15] lets us know who it actually was
[49:19] but then you think why would god go to
[49:21] all of this trouble and cause
[49:23] man to go to all of this labor and to be
[49:26] able to maintain
[49:27] such a structure it must have had such
[49:30] value
[49:30] to god that god would allow it to be
[49:34] built in such a way
[49:35] being the only living or the only
[49:38] remaining i should say
[49:39] the only remaining saying of the seven
[49:42] wonders of the ancient
[49:44] world praise the lord
[49:51] glory the ancient egyptians
[49:57] called it the pillar
[50:00] of enoch
[50:04] now i find this very peculiar since
[50:08] enoch was not an egyptian
[50:11] why would they call one of their pride
[50:14] and joys
[50:14] supposedly a pillar of enoch
[50:20] why is it that it does not show on the
[50:22] hieroglyphics and the pictures and all
[50:24] that does not show egyptians
[50:26] building it why is it that there's no
[50:29] affinity
[50:31] in the workmanship or the labor
[50:35] or the craftsmen or the artisans
[50:38] being egyptians who designed and brought
[50:41] such a thing
[50:43] very simple it wasn't egyptians
[50:47] just like it wasn't baptist who designed
[50:49] salvation
[50:51] it wasn't pentecostals it wasn't me and
[50:53] you it was a great designer
[50:56] he's the one who designed salvation he's
[50:59] the one who made the rapture then he
[51:01] ought to know how to get in it
[51:03] amen gloria
[51:06] notice this i found this very
[51:08] interesting one man who
[51:10] measured and studied the great pyramid
[51:12] was a structural
[51:14] engineer by the name of david davidson
[51:17] early in the last century this agnostic
[51:22] set his mind to disprove all the pyramid
[51:25] theories you know all the different
[51:27] things that people are saying well it
[51:28] means this it means that
[51:29] something to do with god when he
[51:31] completed his task
[51:33] his conclusion was that the pyramid
[51:38] was truth in structural
[51:42] form pretty good for an unbeliever
[51:47] [Applause]
[51:49] do you understand friend that that's
[51:50] what the real body of christ is
[51:54] it's truth in structural form
[51:59] can't you see why that the word the
[52:00] message of the hour
[52:02] must be more than brother brahma said
[52:03] brother man said brother brandon said
[52:04] brother man said
[52:05] it must be the truth instructional form
[52:08] in the way we live and the way we walk
[52:10] and the way we move what is that that is
[52:12] truth
[52:12] that is being translated into structural
[52:15] form and behavior
[52:19] oh thank you lord jesus
[52:23] truth and structural form that it
[52:25] established the bible
[52:28] as the inspired work of god how in the
[52:32] world could you ever come up with that
[52:33] idea
[52:34] did he go in and find matthew mark luke
[52:36] and john axe first and second
[52:38] corinthians
[52:39] did he find that road all over the wall
[52:41] no he found it by using a measuring tape
[52:47] algebra geometry
[52:50] he found god in that pyramid
[52:53] by seeing measurements and scale
[52:57] and time
[53:03] oh thank you jesus the great pyramid
[53:08] has been called
[53:11] the bible in stone
[53:19] upon this rock i will build my church
[53:26] so we know then that the pyramid is not
[53:30] just a pile of rocks right
[53:33] now a carpenter might be able to lay
[53:36] some stone
[53:38] brother dave's a good carpenter and
[53:40] other brothers that are carpenter and no
[53:42] doubt they can
[53:43] lay some stone but there's a difference
[53:45] in a carpenter who can lay a little
[53:47] stone
[53:48] and a stone base
[53:51] now they made it much easier in this day
[53:54] to lay stone being cultured and all that
[53:56] where they come with pretty simple
[53:57] directions and you can stick it here and
[53:59] do this and do that in the other
[54:01] that doesn't really require the ability
[54:03] though of a stone mason
[54:05] now many men are suitable for preachers
[54:09] of religion in this modern day
[54:12] but it takes a real stonemason
[54:15] to build children into a house of god
[54:20] to make them constituents for a rapture
[54:26] glory to god hallelujah i'll tell
[54:29] friends we don't need some preachers you
[54:31] know that's just builders and
[54:32] can stick a little stone here and stick
[54:34] a little stone there and stick a little
[54:36] something on the outside we need some
[54:38] men of god to handle that word
[54:40] that's able to take that word and shape
[54:42] us into the house of the living god
[54:50] but where did this man get this design
[54:54] the blue princess would say
[54:57] where did this design come from
[55:01] since they did not understand geometry
[55:05] since they did not understand pie
[55:09] since they did not understand many of
[55:12] these principles at this time of
[55:13] civilization
[55:15] where did this man come from with these
[55:18] understandings
[55:21] notice this
[55:24] the great pyramid has been called the
[55:25] bible in stone because it's
[55:27] passageways and chambers
[55:31] revealed geometrically inline and symbol
[55:35] the profound spiritual truths
[55:38] of the plan of salvation silent
[55:42] geometry reveals a remarkable witness
[55:46] the slope of the walls of the pyramid
[55:50] being the same slope of the curvature of
[55:53] the earth
[55:55] [Music]
[55:58] and enoch was not part of the shuttle
[56:01] crew
[56:03] they had no shadows
[56:07] so how was he able to get outside the
[56:10] earth
[56:11] and look at that and measure that degree
[56:17] well he didn't need to he just took the
[56:19] main designer's word for it
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:28] notice this now on the inside your
[56:31] brother's got the picture ready
[56:34] and the way that this thing is made
[56:38] now there's many different angles and
[56:40] pictures and drawings of course that
[56:41] you're able to get on the internet in
[56:42] different places as far as studying it
[56:45] but i want you to look that down on the
[56:47] very bottom of this thing
[56:50] down underneath the pyramid
[56:54] a place there called the pit
[57:03] glory to god if i don't have a spell i
[57:07] ain't gonna understand why
[57:12] oh thank you lord jesus then there
[57:15] is an ascending passage now notice how
[57:18] it's coming up
[57:19] down in the pit
[57:23] then there is what is called the
[57:24] ascending passage
[57:27] now notice coming up from out of the pit
[57:32] before you get to the king's chamber
[57:35] there is another little smaller chamber
[57:37] there
[57:38] called the queen's chamber
[57:43] now remember this is the bible
[57:47] in stone
[57:48] [Applause]
[57:50] hallelujah to god
[57:53] you come up out of the pit now notice
[57:56] this is our lord's descent this is not
[57:58] our lord's
[57:59] burying place this is our lord's
[58:02] conquering memorial
[58:07] hallelujah they want me to embalm his
[58:09] body
[58:10] they won't need to bury him in there it
[58:13] has withstood the flood
[58:15] it withstood napoleon's conquest of
[58:17] hebrew
[58:18] it withstood alexander ptolemy it was
[58:21] not other why because god
[58:23] purposed it soul
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:29] i want you to notice these little half
[58:31] marks as they come out through
[58:33] their passageways little tiny
[58:35] passageways
[58:37] and look at where they wind up aiming to
[58:39] you got two that goes from the queen's
[58:40] chamber
[58:41] hitting the star sirius and quahog from
[58:44] the king's chamber of rhymes belt
[58:46] alpha draco now look at the lights the
[58:49] sheer from the queen's chamber
[58:52] lights from the stars little tiny
[58:54] passageways so small that a man cannot
[58:56] crawl through it that they have to send
[58:58] a remote controlled robot
[58:59] to be able to go down through there to
[59:01] see it and when they got down in and
[59:03] turn and look out to the night sky
[59:05] there it is now watch the second bible
[59:07] then testifying back to the first
[59:11] [Applause]
[59:14] thank you jesus
[59:19] now watch this grand gallery this is the
[59:22] long passageway now watch we're going up
[59:25] the ascending passage and then it goes
[59:27] up into a spot that gets
[59:29] wider and taller called the grand
[59:32] gallery the grand
[59:33] gallery terminates at a great step
[59:37] beyond which a level floor under a low
[59:41] passageway
[59:42] takes one to the anti-chamber of the
[59:45] king's chamber
[59:46] now watch when you come up out of the
[59:48] grand gallery see this little
[59:50] thing is it comes up and flattens up now
[59:53] it gets very small
[59:54] moves out of the gigantic grand gallery
[59:57] which is very very tall 27 feet or
[59:58] something like that
[59:59] and then it goes down to 42 inches
[1:00:04] why you're approaching the kings
[1:00:08] [Applause]
[1:00:11] i'm afraid a lot of us are still in the
[1:00:13] grand gallery
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:17] boy i'm a big shot you're going to get
[1:00:19] to the king big shot you better get down
[1:00:21] on your knees
[1:00:24] we'll never be able to approach the king
[1:00:26] with a grand gallery
[1:00:28] attitude come on church amen notice how
[1:00:31] god
[1:00:32] writes the very mystery of redemption
[1:00:34] who's found in here the king
[1:00:37] and the queen
[1:00:42] now what's amazing is as you come into
[1:00:44] this little small
[1:00:45] section before you come into the king's
[1:00:47] gallery
[1:00:49] this is called enoch's
[1:00:54] circle
[1:00:56] enoch circle a hebrew
[1:01:00] hebrew a hebrew
[1:01:05] and a piece of egyptian artwork i don't
[1:01:08] think so
[1:01:10] enoch's circle
[1:01:16] the anchor chamber is 10 foot long but
[1:01:19] 42 inches wide by 12 feet tall now
[1:01:22] notice how it opens up into this section
[1:01:24] here
[1:01:24] before you go over to the king's chamber
[1:01:26] enoch circle measures 365.25
[1:01:32] inches genesis 5 23 and all the days of
[1:01:37] enoch were 365
[1:01:40] years
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:47] the dimensions of the holy of holies
[1:01:50] in the tabernacle match the exact same
[1:01:53] dimensions
[1:01:55] of the king's chamber
[1:01:58] in the great pyramid
[1:02:00] [Music]
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:02] is anybody seeing daylight
[1:02:09] glory to god before there was a moses
[1:02:12] before there was a temple
[1:02:13] the mischievous wrote right here
[1:02:17] don't you see friend god pointing to
[1:02:19] your destiny
[1:02:20] you're not earth bound you're not of
[1:02:22] this world you're pointing to the stars
[1:02:24] where you came from
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:31] lord jesus the dimensions of the holy of
[1:02:34] holies matching the king's chamber the
[1:02:36] interior capacity
[1:02:38] of the coffer on the inside of the
[1:02:39] king's chamber
[1:02:41] matches the identical measurements of
[1:02:43] the ark of the covenant
[1:02:45] lord jesus looking at the dimensions of
[1:02:49] the king's chamber and the dimensions of
[1:02:51] the sarcophagus within
[1:02:53] in terms of regular inches reveals
[1:02:55] evidence of the encoding of advanced
[1:02:57] information
[1:02:58] including circle sphere circle sphere
[1:03:01] geometry
[1:03:03] the use of 360 degree of arc
[1:03:06] on a complete circumference the math
[1:03:09] constants of pi
[1:03:11] and of radon the use of base 10
[1:03:15] the precession cycle of earth's in years
[1:03:18] the speed of light
[1:03:30] glory to god now i know this is greek to
[1:03:34] most of you it's greek to me i'm just
[1:03:36] reading this i mean
[1:03:38] i think lord if it's this good and i
[1:03:39] don't even understand it what would it
[1:03:40] be if i understood it boy it would be
[1:03:42] good
[1:03:45] notice how for all these people can you
[1:03:46] imagine for these people who understand
[1:03:48] what all these words mean i mean you're
[1:03:50] just sitting there nodding me and acting
[1:03:51] like you know what i'm talking about
[1:03:53] but can you imagine for these people who
[1:03:54] understand what all this means and they
[1:03:56] go in there and measure all this and
[1:03:57] they think
[1:03:58] where did all this come from how did
[1:04:00] this all get here no wonder they get
[1:04:02] overwhelmed
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:06] the cycle of the earth and years the
[1:04:08] speed of light in the earth's atmosphere
[1:04:11] in terms of miles per second and the
[1:04:14] square root
[1:04:15] of five as the tangent of satellite
[1:04:18] speed
[1:04:19] the great pyramid was constructed of
[1:04:21] granite overlaid
[1:04:23] with 144 000
[1:04:27] white limestone slabs
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:33] glory to god oh i got up early this
[1:04:36] morning sat in and carol hollered at me
[1:04:38] up in the morning said hey how you doing
[1:04:40] i went up and spoke to her and i said
[1:04:42] i've been about to have a spill
[1:04:44] i've been about to have a spell this is
[1:04:46] what i was looking at
[1:04:48] 144 000 slabs
[1:04:50] on the outside of that pillar
[1:04:54] why because it is god's mystery of
[1:04:56] redemption
[1:05:00] it's me issue
[1:05:08] lord jesus
[1:05:13] listen to this the great pyramid
[1:05:14] constructed with granite overlaid with
[1:05:16] 144
[1:05:17] 000 white limestone slabs
[1:05:21] cut to optical precision the joints
[1:05:24] are consistently one fiftieth
[1:05:28] of an inch
[1:05:32] you knew builder brothers want to
[1:05:34] compare to this
[1:05:41] do you understand that our modern
[1:05:42] builders technology all that we have
[1:05:45] we could not rebuild this of course not
[1:05:50] there's no way we can build this
[1:05:53] there's no way we can do this
[1:05:58] but if the same one who designed this
[1:06:00] can get in here
[1:06:01] can't he live it out
[1:06:05] lord god cannot just save one living
[1:06:08] i cannot do it by the doubt in such
[1:06:11] precise way
[1:06:12] that only god could be designer of such
[1:06:15] a thing
[1:06:17] and his bride will not be within one
[1:06:19] fiftieth of an inch
[1:06:20] she will be the absolute image of him
[1:06:25] but i'm telling you we cannot reproduce
[1:06:28] this
[1:06:29] you cannot live this you cannot make
[1:06:32] this you say how am i going to do it
[1:06:33] then turn let go
[1:06:34] and let god
[1:06:46] you understand how big that is one
[1:06:48] fiftieth of an inch
[1:06:50] five pages of your bible
[1:06:55] so take five pages of your bible and
[1:06:58] hold it up
[1:07:04] there you go g-r-a-c-e
[1:07:12] f-a-i-g-h
[1:07:23] friends this is prophecy oh he said
[1:07:26] ain't nobody living right don't you
[1:07:28] never believe this there ain't going to
[1:07:30] be no bread don't you never believe that
[1:07:32] this has stood as a symbol for thousands
[1:07:34] of years a memorial hallelujah
[1:07:37] that god says there will be a people
[1:07:39] there won't be a people
[1:07:49] the cement was probably used
[1:07:52] as a lubricant to slide the blocks into
[1:07:56] position
[1:07:57] [Laughter]
[1:08:02] none of these highly polished stones
[1:08:04] weighed less
[1:08:06] than a ton
[1:08:10] topping the church of all ages as
[1:08:12] brother brown said it's got to be honed
[1:08:14] in that pyramid you can take a razor
[1:08:16] blade and you can't run between them
[1:08:17] rocks where the mortar was
[1:08:19] it's so fiddly put together he said
[1:08:20] spoken words original seed don't you
[1:08:22] understand what this is showing
[1:08:24] god's building and making a body and
[1:08:26] also a union between him and the bride
[1:08:29] notice the great pyramid was god's
[1:08:30] absolute that would preserve a wealth of
[1:08:32] knowledge for the generations born after
[1:08:34] the flood
[1:08:35] for instance the constant pie
[1:08:38] which more than a thousand years after
[1:08:40] the flood
[1:08:41] the egyptians did not know
[1:08:48] it reveals the shape of the earth its
[1:08:51] size
[1:08:52] and distance from the sun and that the
[1:08:55] poles were flattened
[1:08:59] who but god with no such things
[1:09:02] can't you see why they thought it was
[1:09:04] aliens
[1:09:06] can you see why scientists and people
[1:09:08] who don't want to acknowledge god
[1:09:09] they looked up and said it had to be
[1:09:11] aliens from outside the earth looking at
[1:09:13] all of it
[1:09:13] and they flew down here in a spaceship
[1:09:15] and told them well i can
[1:09:17] sort of go along with that
[1:09:21] but it wasn't space it was it was
[1:09:23] [Laughter]
[1:09:25] it wasn't spaceships it was traveling
[1:09:27] like a thought
[1:09:28] you know lord children it
[1:09:31] ain't no wonder this man was able to
[1:09:33] walk with god and walk out of this world
[1:09:36] look at what the man saw look at what
[1:09:39] god
[1:09:39] revealed to the man the whole mystery of
[1:09:41] redemption
[1:09:42] no wonder he got to a place he couldn't
[1:09:44] take it no more
[1:09:46] he just got to a place he said lord i
[1:09:48] can't stand this
[1:09:49] i can't tell you god said well just come
[1:09:51] out home
[1:09:53] you like the last stone i'll come out
[1:10:08] i'd like to have been setting any steady
[1:10:14] just sitting there praying and all of a
[1:10:16] sudden his directions come
[1:10:19] this geometry this power this
[1:10:21] circumference of the earth
[1:10:23] the poles being flat is that lord have
[1:10:25] mercy glory let god write it down and
[1:10:27] get up just walk around
[1:10:29] oh i don't know elohim almighty god
[1:10:32] almighty god
[1:10:33] go back and write it down a little bit
[1:10:34] more right now i want to say put a
[1:10:36] queen's chamber
[1:10:37] down beneath that put a pit because i'll
[1:10:39] go down to the pit
[1:10:40] and then i'll ascend up the ascending
[1:10:42] passageway and i'll go through and i'll
[1:10:44] get mcqueen
[1:10:45] and all this 2000 years of church ages
[1:10:47] i'll work my way up to the king's
[1:10:49] chamber
[1:10:50] and at the seventh day i'll have a
[1:10:51] messenger there that'll introduce the
[1:10:53] people to me
[1:10:58] [Applause]
[1:11:05] none of the latter pyramids reveal such
[1:11:08] perfection of mathematical
[1:11:11] and architectural skills as the great
[1:11:14] pyramid
[1:11:17] so then after the original there was
[1:11:19] churches churches brides brides churches
[1:11:21] churches
[1:11:22] brides brides
[1:11:28] but none of them contained the mystery
[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:32] they were reproductions and there's
[1:11:33] something to look at i've been there
[1:11:34] i've seen them i've seen the
[1:11:35] set pyramid i've seen different pyramids
[1:11:37] been to mexico and seen some of the ones
[1:11:39] there
[1:11:39] but i've also seen the great pyramid
[1:11:42] [Applause]
[1:11:44] i'm not down planning to say something
[1:11:45] the baptist won't be saved the
[1:11:46] methodists some of the message folks all
[1:11:48] that sort of thing that's up to god
[1:11:49] but i know one thing there's only one
[1:11:52] that'll ever fit into this and this is
[1:11:53] god's own design
[1:11:55] who would want to cheat mimic when we
[1:11:57] can be in the great pyramid
[1:12:00] [Applause]
[1:12:05] lord brotherhood said just before the
[1:12:09] anti-living destruction the flood time
[1:12:10] they had a greater civilization than we
[1:12:12] have today
[1:12:13] and i believe they had control of atomic
[1:12:15] power
[1:12:16] i think that's the way they shook the
[1:12:18] world from its orbit
[1:12:20] and we're told to know the world stood
[1:12:22] upright but they had such mechanical and
[1:12:24] such science so they could build the
[1:12:26] pyramids things and so forth
[1:12:27] and we couldn't reproduce it today now
[1:12:29] this is not just a quote from brother
[1:12:30] brown but science tells us the same
[1:12:32] which we imagine it's hard for them to
[1:12:34] admit to we have no machinery to lift
[1:12:37] those blocks that far
[1:12:38] unless it would be atomic
[1:12:43] now you imagine enoch down there working
[1:12:45] with atomic power
[1:12:47] however it was that he done it so it
[1:12:50] wasn't hard for him to believe
[1:12:52] god could change his atoms
[1:12:54] [Applause]
[1:12:59] whatever they've done i mean however
[1:13:00] they went about doing it in the release
[1:13:02] of atomic power
[1:13:03] and they'll be able to cut them stones
[1:13:04] with laser precision
[1:13:11] they didn't say the god that can give me
[1:13:13] this understanding of this
[1:13:14] dividing an atom and lifting these
[1:13:16] blocks surely that god can change me
[1:13:18] if the god can write this up here can't
[1:13:20] that god change you
[1:13:22] if god left this for a memorial and god
[1:13:24] you know doing all the things that he
[1:13:26] did in the mountains and yet
[1:13:27] it was built it withstood the flood it
[1:13:30] withstood the fire
[1:13:31] it's withstood burglars it's withstood
[1:13:33] all kinds of things
[1:13:34] don't you understand it's a symbol of
[1:13:36] the church
[1:13:38] even the flood upon the earth and the
[1:13:40] living destruction could not destroy the
[1:13:44] pyramid
[1:13:49] god had a witness in the heavens the
[1:13:51] stars
[1:13:52] the first bible was stood the flood god
[1:13:56] had an earthly witness sitting in the
[1:13:58] land of egypt
[1:14:00] which is where the original garden of
[1:14:01] eden was
[1:14:06] so god had a witness
[1:14:12] saying i will restore
[1:14:16] say us lord
[1:14:23] lord jesus notice 144 000 casing stones
[1:14:29] highly polished and flat
[1:14:33] to an accuracy of one hundredth
[1:14:37] of an inch about a hundred inches
[1:14:41] thick
[1:14:45] and weighing about 15 tons each nearly
[1:14:48] perfect
[1:14:48] right angles for all six
[1:14:52] sides
[1:14:55] computer calculations indicate 40 745
[1:14:59] casing stones are used
[1:15:01] averaging 40 tons each before the face
[1:15:04] angle was cut
[1:15:06] the number 144 comes up also in the book
[1:15:09] of revelation chapter 21
[1:15:13] the height of the wall
[1:15:16] in the new city
[1:15:24] lord jesus
[1:15:29] you imagine it's my inspiration this man
[1:15:33] moved and he worked and
[1:15:35] thousands and thousands of workers
[1:15:38] under this man as they were bringing
[1:15:40] together the structural vision
[1:15:43] of prophecy and building every part and
[1:15:47] being
[1:15:47] home to this day to where our engineers
[1:15:50] and
[1:15:51] all of the people of this great day with
[1:15:53] their great intelligence cannot to this
[1:15:56] day figure out how they done it
[1:16:00] then we got everything made and the
[1:16:02] spirit of god said
[1:16:04] don't cap it
[1:16:10] leave the headstone the stone of scone
[1:16:14] over to one side
[1:16:22] by that you not know when the king come
[1:16:27] he would be rejected
[1:16:33] lord god brethren says in the easter
[1:16:36] seal the headstone was never put on the
[1:16:37] pyramid
[1:16:39] it's an open top if you've ever been
[1:16:42] there by the grace of god i have he said
[1:16:44] there's no top on the pyramid what is it
[1:16:47] enoch built it before the flood it was a
[1:16:49] memorial
[1:16:51] that's the reason it's never destroyed
[1:16:53] during the time of the flood
[1:16:55] there's nothing destroyed it because
[1:16:58] it's
[1:16:59] a memorial
[1:17:02] now if you notice way down on the bottom
[1:17:04] it's wide then it shapes up a little
[1:17:06] more in the minority
[1:17:08] and then a little more as it goes to the
[1:17:09] headstone that's the looser names
[1:17:11] justification the church
[1:17:12] sanctification than the baptism of the
[1:17:14] holy ghost but as it shapes toward the
[1:17:16] top it continues from the looser age
[1:17:19] to the westerly age amen to pentecostal
[1:17:22] age but after it leaves the pentecostal
[1:17:24] age
[1:17:25] it shapes up until it has to get to a
[1:17:27] place so those stones are so homes
[1:17:31] to the razorblade
[1:17:35] can't you see why the preaching of this
[1:17:36] day friend will hone us so
[1:17:38] fine it will be so close
[1:17:41] oh my now that's what god is doing to
[1:17:44] his church
[1:17:45] he's honing off his people
[1:17:49] and making it in such a perfect way that
[1:17:52] when the headstone christ
[1:17:54] comes it fits the building together
[1:17:58] and then a resurrection of the whole
[1:18:01] thing
[1:18:04] can't you see why the headstone must cap
[1:18:07] off our lives as individuals
[1:18:09] and why the headstone must cap off this
[1:18:12] age
[1:18:13] enoch's headstone will finally
[1:18:17] arrive
[1:18:20] and when the headstone comes and sets
[1:18:24] down
[1:18:24] not the skull stone of scone but jesus
[1:18:28] himself
[1:18:29] when he sets down on that bride and then
[1:18:31] the finale of his work
[1:18:33] amen glory what is that coming
[1:18:36] rapturing body changing time
[1:18:40] then it will cause the resurrection the
[1:18:43] charge from the headstone
[1:18:45] will charge down to looser down to
[1:18:47] wesley down to pentecost
[1:18:54] lord jesus notice he said when christ
[1:18:58] the heads on christ comes it fits the
[1:19:00] building together then a resurrection of
[1:19:02] the whole thing the church has gone up
[1:19:05] again it was famous names in enoch
[1:19:07] completed in his day or back in that day
[1:19:09] the pyramid
[1:19:10] because we haven't got time to
[1:19:12] background it show you how the pyramid
[1:19:14] come up to the chambers and so forth
[1:19:16] it speaks right straight to the end time
[1:19:18] now
[1:19:19] they're in the king's chamber now
[1:19:23] by the measurement but the headstone
[1:19:26] never was put on the pyramid
[1:19:28] that sets perfectly architecturally or
[1:19:31] masonry
[1:19:32] until even a thin razor blade they don't
[1:19:35] know how they ever built it
[1:19:36] don't understand could even a razor
[1:19:38] blade slice among themselves
[1:19:40] where the mortar should be i love this
[1:19:43] and there's no murder in it
[1:19:45] so listen to this that's when it is when
[1:19:49] christ and the church becomes one
[1:19:54] there's no mortar between
[1:19:57] [Applause]
[1:19:59] oh glory to god mortar was not used in
[1:20:03] the pyramid
[1:20:04] to hold rock to rock to rock to rock
[1:20:07] then that would have given element for
[1:20:09] something human made
[1:20:10] but god said don't do it enough just use
[1:20:13] the mortar to kind of make it greasy
[1:20:15] that's all
[1:20:16] make it within big old rocks and slide
[1:20:18] around i don't need no martyr he not
[1:20:21] i'm going to so attach myself to my
[1:20:23] people it'll be
[1:20:24] christ in them the hope of glory
[1:20:32] look friend god don't want you and then
[1:20:35] christ
[1:20:35] and then a preacher sandwiched in
[1:20:37] between his mortar or your mama or your
[1:20:39] daddy or even a prophet
[1:20:41] god wants you and him so together
[1:20:52] lord mercy i wonder how many people in
[1:20:55] the days of this man
[1:20:57] when they started looking at this design
[1:21:00] when there had never been a structure
[1:21:02] built quite this shape is it
[1:21:04] would you come up with that that is the
[1:21:06] weirdest building i've ever seen in my
[1:21:08] life
[1:21:13] we don't build buildings like that
[1:21:14] around here well you may not
[1:21:16] but i am
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:22] i wasn't even sensible in the desert
[1:21:25] with the winds blowing the way they do
[1:21:29] with all the things with the army stick
[1:21:30] out right in the middle of the desert
[1:21:32] like a sore son
[1:21:34] everybody coming through see it right
[1:21:38] now you're seeing daylight why didn't he
[1:21:40] invert the thing and turn it upside down
[1:21:42] and bury it where nobody would see it
[1:21:46] ye ye hallelujah
[1:21:49] are the light of the world a city set on
[1:21:52] the hill
[1:21:54] god don't want you inverted and laid a
[1:21:56] seal and not standing for what's right
[1:21:58] and true
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:05] lord jesus notice this
[1:22:10] god christ and the person again the
[1:22:13] capstone that goes
[1:22:15] upon the pyramid it was rejected never
[1:22:17] put on the pyramid
[1:22:20] isn't till this day the stone of scone
[1:22:23] this claim
[1:22:24] they claim but it never was put on the
[1:22:26] capstone why
[1:22:29] enoch and them in the early days built
[1:22:31] the pyramid down in egypt we find out
[1:22:33] in there they knew that the cornerstone
[1:22:36] the capstone
[1:22:38] would be rejected so prophetically he
[1:22:42] comes right up comes right up comes
[1:22:44] right out bills and bills and bills and
[1:22:45] bills
[1:22:46] and years and years and years and years
[1:22:48] and comes to the final saying god says
[1:22:50] don't that's the mystery
[1:22:54] of the end time
[1:22:58] don't write it you know
[1:23:04] just leave it over here glory to god
[1:23:08] lord jesus remember the dream and
[1:23:10] brother brown took a a crowbar of the
[1:23:12] thing and went and whipped the top off
[1:23:15] the pyramid shaped right mountain and
[1:23:17] said look down inside here
[1:23:20] look down inside your what was a white
[1:23:22] rock that had never been looked on
[1:23:23] before
[1:23:24] [Applause]
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:26] stay here while i go west and come back
[1:23:28] oh glory
[1:23:30] i'm glad he went west and come back
[1:23:32] what'd he come back with the
[1:23:33] understanding of what the white rock was
[1:23:35] because they're still looking at one
[1:23:36] another didn't understand it we didn't
[1:23:38] either
[1:23:42] that's the way god has brought his
[1:23:43] church from justification trainification
[1:23:45] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:46] and now the ministry of the spirit which
[1:23:50] is what quickens the word
[1:23:52] that ministry in the church will have to
[1:23:55] be exactly like his
[1:24:02] so the second bible
[1:24:05] and that reaches its apex at the very
[1:24:08] top
[1:24:10] and i said master stonemason we're ready
[1:24:13] to cap it off he said don't cap it
[1:24:16] what i thought this was this is our
[1:24:19] crowning achievement
[1:24:20] this is the day we wave on we've been
[1:24:22] doing this thing for years
[1:24:24] don't cap it
[1:24:28] what are you supposed to do with this
[1:24:31] god said
[1:24:32] don't cap it
[1:24:35] leave the cap sitting over here
[1:24:37] somewhere it'll wind up in time britain
[1:24:39] will end up with it in france and this
[1:24:41] and that and the other
[1:24:42] but it'll come back
[1:24:46] it'll come back when they say law is in
[1:24:50] the desert don't believe it low is over
[1:24:52] here
[1:24:52] don't believe it for as the lightning
[1:24:54] shineth out of the east and cometh into
[1:24:56] the west isn't it amazing that's the way
[1:24:58] jesus said his coming would be
[1:24:59] it's backwards a lot of the message
[1:25:01] folks are looking to the west
[1:25:05] jesus didn't say look to the west he
[1:25:07] said as the lightning coming from the
[1:25:09] east and goes to the west not vice versa
[1:25:12] come on children i don't know about you
[1:25:15] i'm looking for that headstone
[1:25:19] well that's the same one that daniel saw
[1:25:21] a stone not made with hands
[1:25:27] hallelujah watch this out feast of the
[1:25:30] trumpets like the pyramid how it comes
[1:25:32] in the minority all the time great white
[1:25:33] from luther
[1:25:35] wesley pentecost and the caps on the top
[1:25:38] of soho and each one of those stones are
[1:25:39] so perfectly put together
[1:25:41] we don't know yet how they did it but
[1:25:43] it's so perfectly put together in that
[1:25:44] pyramid we're not a pyramid teaching now
[1:25:47] enoch and then built it years ago and it
[1:25:49] stands for
[1:25:50] a symbol just the same as
[1:25:54] the sun rises and says just the same
[1:25:56] amen
[1:25:57] as the tree drops its leaf and comes
[1:25:59] back again as a fish in the cattle
[1:26:01] everything as symbolizes it the pyramid
[1:26:03] stands as a symbol
[1:26:08] go into the prophet's chamber
[1:26:14] prophet's chamber enoch's
[1:26:20] circle
[1:26:23] it amazing for all these years
[1:26:28] i've been waiting for another prophet
[1:26:31] glory to god
[1:26:35] as far as we know not a prophet
[1:26:38] has stood in that prophet's chamber
[1:26:41] since enoch walked out of there the last
[1:26:43] time
[1:26:46] thousands of years ago now you know
[1:26:48] naturally
[1:26:50] you're gonna saw himself so here he's
[1:26:52] right at the very top he's right near
[1:26:53] the king's chamber
[1:26:54] walking in there you imagine as they
[1:26:56] finish everything and they start backing
[1:26:58] out
[1:26:59] they back out from the king's chamber
[1:27:01] and work their way out
[1:27:02] finishing everything whatever
[1:27:03] hieroglyphics need to go here go there
[1:27:05] and do this
[1:27:06] out of the other and he not backs out of
[1:27:07] enoch circle
[1:27:10] he know backs out of enoch circle and he
[1:27:13] goes to measuring it around 365.25
[1:27:16] well that lets me know how long i'm
[1:27:18] going to live
[1:27:20] oh glory to god i see my life
[1:27:23] i see my life right here do you see
[1:27:26] yours
[1:27:27] [Applause]
[1:27:29] you imagine as he turned and got to that
[1:27:32] door
[1:27:33] and turns around the last time
[1:27:36] and he looks around into eternity
[1:27:41] because the circle of course represents
[1:27:43] eternity he just kind of spun around and
[1:27:45] said
[1:27:46] i'll see you again one day and he starts
[1:27:50] down to send him
[1:27:51] down the green gallery going out the
[1:27:53] descending passageway
[1:27:54] and he closes and goes out for the last
[1:27:56] time and seals the mystery of god
[1:28:03] elijah was a great man but elijah never
[1:28:06] had the ministry
[1:28:07] to walk up in the seven steps of the
[1:28:08] prophet's chamber and introduce the
[1:28:10] people of his day
[1:28:12] to the seven seals paul was a great man
[1:28:15] but god never allowed paul to go up the
[1:28:17] descending chamber
[1:28:18] up into the great hall and stop at the
[1:28:20] prophet's chamber
[1:28:21] peter was a great man luther wesley
[1:28:23] pentecost you understand what i'm saying
[1:28:25] but god was building building building
[1:28:28] moving moving moving
[1:28:29] and he started out a man in the last day
[1:28:32] under the administration of malachi 4.
[1:28:34] he starts out real wide at the bottom 50
[1:28:37] 60
[1:28:38] reaching out to everybody but as it
[1:28:39] keeps going it gets getting married now
[1:28:42] and
[1:28:43] why the mystery of the pyramid is road
[1:28:45] in his own life
[1:28:47] [Applause]
[1:28:49] finally he'll rise to that spot tree
[1:28:52] says
[1:28:53] my mission to the earth is to forerun
[1:28:56] that coming world
[1:28:58] i'm not i'm not he'd come to tell you he
[1:29:00] is coming he is coming
[1:29:02] but he is here
[1:29:11] so once again we have one
[1:29:15] in the prophet's chamber
[1:29:24] to the prophet's chamber is that an
[1:29:26] invitation
[1:29:30] huh brother baby says go into the
[1:29:34] prophet's chamber
[1:29:35] so apparently that means i have
[1:29:37] permission to go
[1:29:39] right if i come to your house and you
[1:29:42] say brother don't go in the kitchen
[1:29:44] anything you want little debbie's in
[1:29:45] there
[1:29:45] pepsi snickers roast beef sandwich
[1:29:47] anything you want go in and get it
[1:29:49] well i ain't gonna understand you if i
[1:29:51] go in and get it and you get madder and
[1:29:52] hornet
[1:29:53] if you don't want me to get it don't
[1:29:54] tell me to go get it well
[1:29:57] says go into the prophet's chamber i
[1:29:59] believe i will
[1:30:06] into the prophet's chamber and watch
[1:30:08] them seven
[1:30:09] steps
[1:30:13] where did the guard meet the challenge
[1:30:15] to bring the comer
[1:30:18] into the presence of the king at the top
[1:30:22] of the steps was in the seventh
[1:30:26] step now watch how steps are built for
[1:30:31] you brothers that are carpenters and you
[1:30:32] take them bill the stringer and cut it
[1:30:34] all out
[1:30:35] one step leads into the other
[1:30:38] right so you step like this and then it
[1:30:40] comes up and then it leads to that one
[1:30:42] and leads to that one and leads to that
[1:30:44] one and they're all tied together
[1:30:45] to make steps right to go up your house
[1:30:48] up your staircase whatever more
[1:30:49] so they tie one into the other you don't
[1:30:52] have each one hanging they're suspended
[1:30:53] and you're
[1:30:53] going around on swings and fishing line
[1:30:55] and trying to but they're actually
[1:30:57] tied in so paul's message tied into the
[1:30:59] second age
[1:31:00] second into the third third and the
[1:31:02] fourth fourth and the fifth fifth and
[1:31:03] the sixth
[1:31:04] and then you come to the seventh when
[1:31:05] you arrive and i hope you understand we
[1:31:07] have
[1:31:08] arrived
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:12] and what was it we were dead now we're
[1:31:14] dead if we are not bidden we are dead
[1:31:18] but the king amen from the king's
[1:31:20] chamber has invited us
[1:31:21] come into the prophet's chamber
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:26] then we arrive at the seventh step
[1:31:30] their shoes we've got to come again with
[1:31:33] that same spirit that was on
[1:31:34] john he introduced the messiah was
[1:31:38] greater than all the prophets he
[1:31:39] introduced it
[1:31:40] and we've come to a place again
[1:31:43] to something that's going to introduce
[1:31:46] the messiah then it's to say a lot of
[1:31:50] folks around the message got in the
[1:31:51] prophet's chamber and they set up
[1:31:52] housekeeping
[1:31:55] they got to bed their table they got
[1:31:57] everything said no they don't want to go
[1:31:58] no farther of course i ain't talking
[1:31:59] about the bride
[1:32:01] because the bride don't want to stop at
[1:32:02] the prophet's chamber she wants to go
[1:32:03] into the king's chamber
[1:32:05] i love the prophet i thank god for him i
[1:32:07] give him respect but he ain't the one
[1:32:08] i'm going to marry for him
[1:32:10] he ain't the one that created me brother
[1:32:11] graham is not the designer of this
[1:32:12] structure i want to marry the man who
[1:32:14] made this
[1:32:16] royally i want to be a part of the man
[1:32:18] who made this
[1:32:20] [Applause]
[1:32:24] let me see if i can find a place to
[1:32:25] close
[1:32:27] here he not builds the entire mystery of
[1:32:29] god
[1:32:31] and god says
[1:32:35] include in this program their destiny
[1:32:40] their origination and give them a little
[1:32:43] preview
[1:32:44] of their future home
[1:32:48] watch this brother branham and laying
[1:32:49] out now that their future home and of
[1:32:50] course
[1:32:51] most of us up until this time in 1964
[1:32:54] looking for heaven to be
[1:32:55] basically built as a cube or a rectangle
[1:33:00] but all of a sudden something strikes
[1:33:03] the prophet and never preached it before
[1:33:06] of course it's no wonder he's standing
[1:33:08] on the seventh step
[1:33:10] he himself has now progressed and grown
[1:33:12] and he's moved and moved and now he's at
[1:33:14] the seventh step and looking back and
[1:33:16] said my lord i'm on a pyramid
[1:33:18] this ain't a box this ain't a rectangle
[1:33:21] this is a pyramid
[1:33:24] the breadth of heights are the same that
[1:33:26] would make it 1500 miles this way
[1:33:27] this way 1500 miles of length by the
[1:33:30] breadth of the height
[1:33:31] think of it transparent gold the city
[1:33:32] had a wall about it now that doesn't
[1:33:34] mean
[1:33:34] necessarily mean by being equal and
[1:33:37] while it's a foundation or equal doesn't
[1:33:38] necessarily mean that it's a cube or a
[1:33:40] square
[1:33:42] there is another geographical measure
[1:33:48] which of course sets at the center of
[1:33:49] the earth
[1:33:51] and divides the earth into four quarters
[1:33:56] and how john saw the new jerusalem
[1:33:59] descending from god out of heaven
[1:34:00] reckon where it'll be i can pretty well
[1:34:01] tell you the apex will be right exactly
[1:34:04] where the great pyramid is today
[1:34:07] center of the earth that's what he wants
[1:34:10] to be in your life
[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:12] he don't want to be over here on the
[1:34:13] side up here in the north somewhere he
[1:34:15] wants to be the center of
[1:34:16] everything that we are oh god
[1:34:19] he wants to be the center of everything
[1:34:21] that we are
[1:34:24] thank you lord jesus but the dimensions
[1:34:27] are the same that is a pyramid four
[1:34:28] square life foursquare and the walls are
[1:34:29] the same
[1:34:30] this being this way would answer
[1:34:34] exactly enoch's
[1:34:38] sign in egypt
[1:34:43] the pyramid would it enoch before them
[1:34:45] delivering destruction which
[1:34:46] justification was coming in
[1:34:48] brought forth a sign and then this
[1:34:51] pyramid is seven steps going to the
[1:34:52] king's chamber
[1:34:53] watch on that seventh step if you ever
[1:34:55] study the dimensions of the pyramid
[1:34:58] what comes out to take the oncomer to
[1:35:01] introduce to the king now notice how
[1:35:03] brother man identifies himself he's not
[1:35:05] the king he's to introduce you
[1:35:09] to the king
[1:35:13] watch that station that is standing
[1:35:15] there and you'll see
[1:35:18] the day you're living
[1:35:21] in the pyramid
[1:35:28] so i want to find myself i want to see
[1:35:31] what day i'm living
[1:35:33] in the pyramid as jesus said no man
[1:35:36] can take salt and add one cubit
[1:35:40] to his stature that's not necessarily
[1:35:43] the measurement on a wall
[1:35:45] but that's length of age
[1:35:49] length of age prolonging age or span of
[1:35:52] time
[1:35:54] so i want to find where i'm at i don't
[1:35:56] want to go backwards
[1:35:57] i don't want to go too far forward i
[1:35:59] want to find where i'm at you understand
[1:36:02] now once again in future home god made
[1:36:03] three bibles there's a pyramid teaching
[1:36:05] this nonsense but there's a genuine
[1:36:06] pyramid see
[1:36:07] now god he made three had to have
[1:36:09] everything in three jesus comes
[1:36:10] three times come wants to redeem his
[1:36:12] bride next time to get his bride
[1:36:14] next time with his bride isn't that
[1:36:16] beautiful oh my
[1:36:18] did you understand what all three of
[1:36:19] them comings was about bright bright
[1:36:21] bride
[1:36:22] first coming redeem his bride second
[1:36:24] time guinness by
[1:36:25] third time worth his bride it sounds
[1:36:27] like to me i mean
[1:36:28] you're on his heart big time
[1:36:33] glory to god hallelujah you are
[1:36:36] identified in all three comings of jesus
[1:36:38] christ
[1:36:40] [Applause]
[1:36:42] how beautiful in this pyramid was seven
[1:36:44] steps the king's chamber
[1:36:45] and we're in the seventh church age
[1:36:47] before
[1:36:48] the king takes his
[1:36:53] and in the earth's time of purifying by
[1:36:55] its baptism of fire
[1:36:58] there will be volcanics such as the
[1:36:59] earth exploding
[1:37:01] and will push up a pyramid
[1:37:04] like mountain there'd be plenty of room
[1:37:08] to do it because the whole thing will be
[1:37:09] changed
[1:37:10] the whole surface will be changed you
[1:37:11] got it it'll push up
[1:37:13] a pyramid like mountain
[1:37:17] so from the center of the earth will
[1:37:20] come up by volcanic
[1:37:21] action will come up a pyramid-like
[1:37:23] mountain
[1:37:25] and then john saw the new city the new
[1:37:27] jerusalem descending from god out of
[1:37:28] heaven what is it
[1:37:30] it's the capstone which is also shaped
[1:37:32] like a pyramid
[1:37:36] and it will come down and set on the
[1:37:39] mountain oh lord children
[1:37:41] don't you understand he's doing the same
[1:37:42] thing with the new city what he's done
[1:37:44] for you
[1:37:46] the new city comes down like this the
[1:37:48] earth is churning and churning and
[1:37:50] volcanoes and they're belching and
[1:37:51] bouncing
[1:37:52] and it'll push and push and push
[1:37:56] and push up a gigantic mountain
[1:37:59] but it'll be without a headstone
[1:38:02] and then john looked and he said i know
[1:38:04] i saw a new heavens in the new earth
[1:38:06] and i saw them in the city of the new
[1:38:07] jerusalem center for god out of heaven
[1:38:09] as a pride going for a husband
[1:38:10] and here comes the headstone
[1:38:17] can you imagine a 1500 mile headstone
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:23] but don't worry the same god who builds
[1:38:25] pyramids know how to lower headstones
[1:38:30] he knows how to pick rocks up he knows
[1:38:31] how to let him down he knows how to
[1:38:33] build big things he knows how to do all
[1:38:35] that
[1:38:36] oh lord
[1:38:40] and john saw that headstone coming right
[1:38:42] down and just settle right down on the
[1:38:44] earth
[1:38:44] heaven and earth embrace
[1:38:48] and they are eternally
[1:38:52] sealed together
[1:39:02] lord jesus and the new city in the new
[1:39:06] earth the new creation
[1:39:08] the city on the hill with the throne on
[1:39:11] the top
[1:39:12] of it brother members illustration and
[1:39:14] the wall that's all around had 12
[1:39:16] foundations and each one of them
[1:39:18] had the breaststone that was in aaron
[1:39:19] which represented the 12 tribes
[1:39:21] and in the gates four gates said exactly
[1:39:25] the temple in the wilderness
[1:39:26] like the tent in the wilderness each one
[1:39:28] had apostles three on each side
[1:39:30] twelve apostles 144 cubits
[1:39:33] exactly 216 feet making each one of
[1:39:36] those big stones
[1:39:38] almost 20 foot tall the breastplate
[1:39:42] in that gate the breastplate
[1:39:47] in the gate you knock
[1:39:52] the stone base
[1:39:55] william branham a stone miss
[1:40:01] let me bring it on down donny reagan
[1:40:04] a stone mace you saw other god come in
[1:40:08] stone me we don't want a guy that just
[1:40:12] should go down lows and buy some stick
[1:40:13] on stuff we want the real stuff
[1:40:17] whatever it takes to cut me and shape me
[1:40:19] listen your friend
[1:40:20] your favorite put just put the stuck on
[1:40:22] stuff and they'll on on this pyramid
[1:40:24] over there it'll never withstood the
[1:40:25] flood
[1:40:26] neither with the church or the living
[1:40:27] god but she's withstood the test of time
[1:40:31] will you stand together
[1:40:36] [Applause]
[1:40:55] lord jesus you know it's amazing when
[1:40:58] you look at all these things
[1:41:00] and hitting in the circumference and the
[1:41:02] measurements in the geometry of this
[1:41:05] is actually the formula of power square
[1:41:08] you take the circumference of the earth
[1:41:10] and the circumference of the sun
[1:41:12] and the circumference of the moon and
[1:41:14] you go to laying all them out
[1:41:15] in the circle inside the square and you
[1:41:18] find that these dimensions are an exact
[1:41:20] parallel
[1:41:22] and now we of course know how this is by
[1:41:24] all these different types of equipment
[1:41:25] they have to measure it
[1:41:27] but how did he not come up with that
[1:41:32] designer himself
[1:41:35] this is why we can have confidence in
[1:41:37] his way
[1:41:39] people say it's too hard it's too
[1:41:40] difficult no he knows how to build a
[1:41:42] church
[1:41:44] a pyramid had never been built before in
[1:41:46] the earth but god knew how to build it
[1:41:48] but what if enoch would have bucked him
[1:41:50] now this ain't going to work god i'm
[1:41:52] telling you i i've been to every builder
[1:41:54] in egypt
[1:41:55] i've been to every building in babylon
[1:41:57] none of them will say this thing will
[1:41:58] ever work
[1:41:59] but he trusted god
[1:42:03] now noah built an ark an ark was
[1:42:05] suitable for animals
[1:42:09] but enoch built the word of stone
[1:42:15] which was fitting for who king
[1:42:19] queen and the 144 thousand
[1:42:28] then once it settles down on the earth
[1:42:30] then all the inhabitants the kings
[1:42:32] will be included where not in the
[1:42:33] headstone because they've been the
[1:42:34] headstone in life
[1:42:36] they'll be included on the rest of the
[1:42:38] mountain they're down
[1:42:42] from under the throne will come the
[1:42:43] river of life
[1:42:45] and it'll trickle down in your backyard
[1:42:47] and if i live below you or whoever lives
[1:42:49] below you
[1:42:50] it'll trickle down down down sort of
[1:42:53] like the hanging gardens of babylon
[1:42:55] nebuchadnezzar had married a woman from
[1:42:58] an area that had a lot of force country
[1:42:59] and she so missed her home
[1:43:01] that she just couldn't get over her home
[1:43:03] so you know what he done he had his
[1:43:05] architects to build her
[1:43:06] when the ancient seven wonders of the
[1:43:08] world the hanging gardens
[1:43:10] of babylon that was built for a wife
[1:43:15] that missed her home
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:21] isn't it amazing he loves you so much he
[1:43:24] don't want to take you off in heaven and
[1:43:25] leave you up there and
[1:43:26] wispy white clouds and the zeal blue and
[1:43:29] all that sort of thing
[1:43:31] they said no i know her she's her body's
[1:43:34] from the earth
[1:43:36] she'll want to go back to the earth
[1:43:40] so the earth starts bouncing
[1:43:48] pushing out pushing out higher than the
[1:43:51] himalayas
[1:43:53] bigger than the appalachians
[1:43:56] but was no cap but the chief designer
[1:44:02] made it just exactly where it capped all
[1:44:05] fifteen hundred miles across
[1:44:08] straighter than any laser could ever
[1:44:10] shoot it
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:13] then he'll lose his power and all of a
[1:44:15] sudden
[1:44:17] this city which will weigh billions and
[1:44:19] billions
[1:44:20] and billions of tons can you imagine all
[1:44:23] the gold the silver all the metals
[1:44:25] that's going to come out of heaven on
[1:44:26] some kind of elevator or some kind of
[1:44:29] hallelujah the chief designer
[1:44:32] and he'll let her float right down and
[1:44:34] their sins the pride gently lord gently
[1:44:36] and now women are about moving furniture
[1:44:38] you know gently
[1:44:44] look like a feather
[1:44:47] just
[1:44:50] base of your city
[1:44:54] here we are standing suspended as we
[1:44:56] watch it just lands right there
[1:45:03] and it says it's done children
[1:45:07] come on here
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:13] now i've done to the earth what i did to
[1:45:16] you
[1:45:18] i took you from the devil and i sealed
[1:45:21] you
[1:45:22] i took the earth from the devil and now
[1:45:25] i've sealed it
[1:45:33] lord jesus
[1:45:36] lord jesus
[1:45:42] sometimes we just don't know what to say
[1:45:47] we just get so from him
[1:45:52] help us lord don't let one of us be
[1:45:56] missing lord
[1:46:01] may we not resent holding shaping
[1:46:05] it's hard on our flesh we don't like it
[1:46:07] we don't enjoy it
[1:46:09] hold me lord cut me shape me
[1:46:14] so i can fit i admit
[1:46:17] i need the touch of a master mason
[1:46:22] i've got i've got things about me lord
[1:46:25] this whole human part that need to be
[1:46:27] shaped and cut
[1:46:30] mow me lord hold me
[1:46:33] that i can fit into the headstone
[1:46:37] and lord god if there's one here today
[1:46:40] that doesn't know you in peace
[1:46:43] may you speak to their hearts
[1:46:48] hallelujah your prophet told us in 1962
[1:46:51] end time evangelism
[1:46:55] was taking the stones and shaping them
[1:46:57] into sons of god
[1:46:59] he said confessions with stones but he
[1:47:02] said many people then don't want to be
[1:47:03] shaped
[1:47:04] which is the attitude to many message
[1:47:06] folks i believe the message i believe
[1:47:08] this i believe i believe i believe i
[1:47:09] ain't what makes them mad
[1:47:10] but what makes them mad is when the word
[1:47:12] goes to really shaping them and cutting
[1:47:13] them
[1:47:15] what good's a pile of rocks i don't want
[1:47:16] a pile of rocks lord
[1:47:18] you don't want a pile of rocks you want
[1:47:20] us cut
[1:47:22] and we'll be more precise than the
[1:47:24] pyramid
[1:47:26] a hundredth of an inch a fiftieth of an
[1:47:27] inch oh no that'll never work in this
[1:47:31] it'll be the most perfect building that
[1:47:33] has ever been built
[1:47:36] and we know you'll do it help us lord
[1:47:39] jesus
[1:47:41] we love you today father
[1:47:44] oh i love it when you do this to us
[1:47:48] i love it when you just unveil yourself
[1:47:51] and you stand before us and we just look
[1:47:53] at you and we're just
[1:47:55] awestruck that must have been what that
[1:47:58] little eagle felt like that day in the
[1:47:59] barnyard
[1:48:01] when his mama was suspended above him
[1:48:04] and he was all struck
[1:48:06] by what he saw just overwhelmed just
[1:48:09] overpowered overjoyed overfilled
[1:48:12] oh my i love it when you do that to us
[1:48:15] when you just get above us and you show
[1:48:17] us your greatness and you show us a
[1:48:19] little bit
[1:48:20] of what you are and we just stand and
[1:48:22] behold you and we don't know what to say
[1:48:23] we don't have even to worship you
[1:48:25] we don't even have to respond back we're
[1:48:27] just down there with our mouths open as
[1:48:28] it were
[1:48:30] oh jesus thank you father

[1:48:48] surely friends a god who is so
[1:48:50] meticulous
[1:48:52] in his great work
[1:48:55] if he's watched down through the ages
[1:48:57] over such things
[1:48:58] surely he can take care of me and you
[1:49:02] if he knows when a robin falls to the
[1:49:05] ground and
[1:49:06] every little bird today every little
[1:49:10] thing of nature he knows how to provide
[1:49:14] when the hinds will calf in the winter

[1:49:21] if he loves that so much how about
[1:49:24] me and you how much more does he love us
[1:49:29] oh if he could only just convince us of
[1:49:31] it or we could trust him
[1:49:34] and just let go of what we are trust our
[1:49:37] emotions our motives our objectives
[1:49:40] everything to him just be like a little
