[22:22] you have for them the word I don't know
[22:24] a single need here I don't need to know
[22:26] one need father but you do when we thank
[22:29] you Lord but you're mindful of each one
[22:31] bless your word in Jesus name Amen
[22:35] if you are I mean standing in turn your
[22:39] scripture to Galatians 5
[22:54] the Galatians 5 verses 4 through 7 Paul
[23:02] speaking to the Galatians here Christ
[23:07] has become of no effect unto you
[23:09] whosoever you are justified by the law
[23:12] you are fallen from grace for we through
[23:15] the spirit wait for the hope of
[23:16] righteousness by faith for in Jesus
[23:18] Christ neither circumcision availeth
[23:21] anything nor uncircumcision but faith
[23:24] which worketh by love you did run well
[23:28] who did hinder you that you should not
[23:30] obey the truth the Lord had the
[23:33] blessings to his word if I could speak
[23:36] to it a little bit tonight on what have
[23:38] hindered you Paul asked the Galatians
[23:43] here who have hindered you as the word
[23:47] has continued down through time through
[23:52] the seven church ages and church age
[23:55] measures the Lord give revelation as the
[23:58] word goes we found out who we found out
[24:03] in this age who hinders us and it's us
[24:05] it's this it's this man so tonight we're
[24:09] going to ask the question what have
[24:11] hindered you just to give a background
[24:13] on the Galatians here the Galatians were
[24:18] a collection of Celtic Gauls that were
[24:21] there your France and there in that time
[24:25] when Alexander went north and they fled
[24:28] down to Asia Minor down around Turkey
[24:31] during that time they were they were
[24:34] considered to be barbarians to the
[24:36] civilized word world at that time they
[24:39] weren't educated so Paul is sent down
[24:44] there by God following the leading of
[24:46] the Lord to go into the Gentiles Paul
[24:50] goes down there brings the word to him
[24:53] and they accept the word they've never
[24:55] heard anything like this before and they
[24:56] accept the word Paul preaches to them
[24:58] adoption by grace he preaches in the
[25:00] cross he preaches that you're saved by
[25:03] the by the blood of Jesus Christ that
[25:05] was
[25:06] their sins and they accept it and they
[25:08] believe it but it just so happened some
[25:12] some of the Jews teachers and Pharisees
[25:16] followed them down there and then but
[25:19] they didn't necessarily go down there
[25:21] and tell them what Paul told you was
[25:23] wrong but what they told him was you
[25:26] have to have this as well you have to
[25:28] have this - so had had they approached
[25:33] it with like Paul was telling him was
[25:35] wrong because they loved Paul they
[25:39] probably wouldn't took it so well so
[25:42] they took it both they they started to
[25:43] believe well you got to be circumcised
[25:44] you got to go by the the you got to have
[25:47] sacrifices you have to go by the
[25:49] commandments so Paul hears tell abyss
[25:53] word comes back to him he's going back
[25:55] to the Ephesians 2 Corinthians different
[25:59] Gentile groups there and it gets word
[26:02] back to him so Paul writes him a letter
[26:03] back and I gotta get to reading the
[26:06] letter the first time I ever read this I
[26:08] thought you know Paul was really mad at
[26:10] them Galatians Paul was mad and then you
[26:14] read it and I got to think another day
[26:17] when I was reading this for the
[26:20] hundredth time that was not Paul's
[26:23] concern Paul was not mad at them we'll
[26:27] get into that just in a few seconds but
[26:29] when Paul goes back down there and then
[26:31] writes to him in the New International
[26:33] Version says I am astonished that you
[26:36] were so quickly deserting the one who
[26:38] called you by the grace of Christ and
[26:40] are turning to a different gospel which
[26:44] is really no gospel at all Paul say in
[26:48] the Old Testament that they're trying to
[26:49] teach you is not the gospel this is not
[26:52] the good news that's the law so Paul
[26:55] begins to tell them he said this is
[26:56] really no gospel evidently some people
[26:59] are throwing you into conversion
[27:00] confusion and trying to pervert the
[27:03] gospel of Christ in in the way the
[27:09] glaciers looked at it they felt like
[27:10] they were this was gonna drag for a
[27:12] minute but we'll get out of it if you
[27:13] won't bear with me
[27:15] the Galatians weren't didn't feel like
[27:17] they were turning away from God they
[27:20] were fervently getting into what Paul
[27:22] had taught them but they also were
[27:24] getting into what these Judaizers were
[27:27] were giving him and they thought they
[27:29] were all one so Paul writes him to
[27:32] straighten him out so the Jews who went
[27:39] down there
[27:40] I suppose they tell them the things that
[27:42] Paul taught you were were good but you
[27:46] have to apply the works you have to you
[27:49] have to have works God looks at works so
[27:51] these people who had done everything
[27:55] with their hands all their life you know
[27:58] they were they were fighters they were
[28:01] athletic people so Paul comes back and
[28:05] tells him you were running so well what
[28:08] happened Paul uses something that they
[28:11] could understand you were running well
[28:14] he didn't say you were serving God well
[28:17] he didn't say you were accepting gospel
[28:19] well he said you were running well but I
[28:23] got to look at the way the Paul
[28:24] approached him who had hindered you is
[28:29] what he asked we're gonna look at that
[28:31] and in Galatians three and one
[28:33] Paul says o foolish Galatians who hath
[28:37] bewitched you that you should not obey
[28:40] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[28:43] hath evidently set forth and crucified
[28:46] among you so it looks like he's upset at
[28:51] you foolish Galatians but it's not like
[28:53] that
[28:54] like that the way I like to look at Paul
[28:56] it is looking at what happened to these
[28:58] Galatians was Paul your children comes
[29:03] home with a your child comes home with a
[29:04] black eye they get in a fight at school
[29:07] you say who done that to you who has
[29:11] done this to you who hurts you so Paul
[29:15] is not not centering his anger his
[29:18] indignation on the Galatians he wants to
[29:21] know who done this Galatians 5 10 brings
[29:25] that out a little more
[29:28] have confidence in you through the Lord
[29:31] that you will be non otherwise minded he
[29:34] that troubleth you shall bear his
[29:36] judgment whosoever he be so Paul saying
[29:39] whoever caused you to do this judge was
[29:42] going to come upon them so let's look at
[29:47] you did run well who did him to you that
[29:49] you should obey the truth Paul says you
[29:52] run well you did that's the action that
[29:55] the Galatians he put upon the Galatians
[29:56] you did run well and we look at that
[29:58] word its metaphor taken from runners in
[30:04] a race to exert oneself strive hard to
[30:07] spend one strength in performing or
[30:09] attaining something the word occurs in
[30:11] Greek writings denoting to incur extreme
[30:14] peril which requires exertion of all of
[30:17] one's effort to overcome I got to
[30:19] looking at this word I got to in the
[30:22] thing that stood out for me this is the
[30:23] same word that Jesus used when is the
[30:25] word run when he is bringing the parable
[30:28] of the prodigal son when he explains how
[30:30] the father ran to the prodigal son and
[30:32] policies telling them you were running
[30:34] this way you were running with every ear
[30:37] exhorting every effort you have you were
[30:40] you were giving it your all while you
[30:41] were running you weren't falling short
[30:44] you couldn't have gave any more you know
[30:47] and I think sometimes you know as we
[30:50] look at our own spiritual life you know
[30:51] how much are we given how much are we
[30:54] running how much you know we when we
[30:57] look at we're running this race are we
[30:59] giving it all we had all we got or were
[31:01] we giving it to something else are we
[31:03] giving it to other things in our life
[31:04] the greatest race you're running in your
[31:07] life is the thing that's most important
[31:08] to you the thing that you give the most
[31:10] time the thing you run it everybody's
[31:12] got a different race in their life I
[31:13] praise this gospel this is the only race
[31:17] that'll get you across the finish line
[31:19] so and Paul tells him he says you're
[31:22] running in this manner you know I got
[31:24] thinking Lord the way Jesus used that
[31:26] and the prodigal son he's telling him
[31:29] you know this is the way the father ran
[31:31] to you the father into you in such a way
[31:34] that he exerted all his effort God could
[31:37] not have gave any more when he ran to
[31:39] you he exerted all he had
[31:42] are you giving all you have where is our
[31:47] effort you know we we say all the time
[31:53] it's almost over the finish line's right
[31:55] in front of us we say it all the time
[31:56] every day you know that's in our minds
[31:59] we're with and it becomes tradition do
[32:02] we do you really stop and think do you
[32:05] think about what you're running to is
[32:07] there anything in your life that's
[32:10] holding you back from giving it all you
[32:11] got is there anything in your life it
[32:14] that you desire so much that you you
[32:17] can't give it to this if God gave that
[32:22] much his entire self for you
[32:25] he couldn't gave them more he could not
[32:28] a gave when God looked back at what he
[32:30] gave you he couldn't have said I could
[32:33] have gave a little more he could have
[32:35] never said that he will never say that
[32:37] and all he expects from us we call
[32:41] herself the bride we call it we say
[32:43] Jesus lives in us Christ lives in us and
[32:45] in Christ said when you see me you see
[32:47] the father I do with as the father does
[32:49] that comes through the bride as well so
[32:53] looking at that he says you did run well
[32:57] you were giving it all you had
[32:59] you couldn't gave any more but what
[33:03] hindered you the Greek word is hinder
[33:08] means to beat back the devil came down
[33:13] there and tried to beat back beat them
[33:15] off of what Paul was telling them
[33:18] the devil was trying to hinder them from
[33:20] receiving this adoption Paul was
[33:22] preaching about receiving the the blood
[33:25] of Calvary receiving the grace
[33:28] so what hindered him we're not gonna
[33:33] fall for somebody coming in in amongst
[33:35] essence telling us you know what brother
[33:37] Donnie's preaching what brother
[33:38] Darrell's preaching brother Terry's
[33:39] preaching you know witting it ain't true
[33:42] you gonna fall for that you're not gonna
[33:45] fall for that
[33:45] so what hinders you what hinders us not
[33:51] who we already know who hinders us it's
[33:54] this old man are you letting the old man
[33:57] run the race or you letting the real you
[34:00] run the race cuz I'm gonna tell you if
[34:04] the old man is running for you you'll
[34:06] never get to finish line because it's
[34:08] old man ain't going this old man it's
[34:11] not fitting is not going across the
[34:12] finish line so what are we running for
[34:16] is it our job is it our families are we
[34:22] making enough we making enough money
[34:24] just because you said God gave you a job
[34:31] does it mean you give all that time to
[34:33] that job if God gave you a job he's
[34:38] gonna give you the wisdom to divide your
[34:40] time for that job and for him your
[34:45] family your money your husband your wife
[34:48] worldly possessions
[34:50] what are we racing for what means the
[34:53] most what are we trying to gain people
[34:57] want so much stuff so much stuff let me
[35:01] explain to this this is not D
[35:03] Christianizing anybody this is not
[35:05] making nobody non bride but Satan will
[35:09] put everything in your life that is not
[35:11] a sin that is not a sin your job is not
[35:16] a sin your vacations are not a sin your
[35:21] money is not just not a sin Satan will
[35:25] put so many things in our life that's
[35:27] not a sin to turn your turn your head
[35:30] from this race
[35:33] there's no way he's gonna get you to
[35:35] smoke to look at pornography to drink to
[35:39] do drugs he's not gonna get you to do
[35:41] sinful things he's gonna put everything
[35:44] in your life that he can that is not a
[35:46] sin to make you sin so so what what are
[35:56] we running for you run you running by
[36:02] the plans and the rules that God laid
[36:03] out in this race right here they are are
[36:07] you running by these plans these rules
[36:12] God's got no clauses in his word to fit
[36:17] your life he's got no clauses in his
[36:19] word to fit your life any different than
[36:22] anybody else's it's an individual walk
[36:26] but everybody has the same rules so
[36:30] we're in a race Satan's job is to hinder
[36:33] you are we gonna run by God's rules the
[36:39] rules that God laid out the 19:58
[36:44] brother Brandt preach the mighty conquer
[36:47] he said just remember this it's a good
[36:50] lesson for the Church of the Living God
[36:51] if you don't play the games according to
[36:53] the rules we'll be disqualified at the
[36:55] end you have to keep the rules of the
[36:58] game to win and if the rules of the game
[37:00] in this place a man must be born again
[37:02] to enter to the fellowship of Christ and
[37:04] His Church you might be the greatest
[37:06] denomination on the earth but if you
[37:08] haven't played the rules of the game
[37:10] we'll be disqualified at the end we've
[37:13] come to straight with God we got to come
[37:16] straight with God's rules it is in our
[37:18] rules it's his rules we've got to abide
[37:20] by them we're running the race according
[37:22] to his rules and we have to abide by
[37:24] them and when I was studying this a read
[37:28] this and I hope I don't offend anybody
[37:30] about using sport analogy in this
[37:34] because I got some cokes here actually
[37:36] in 65 will brother Brandon referred to
[37:39] our interaction as the bride one another
[37:41] worth as a football game so
[37:44] so I reckon I came to so God tells Paul
[37:54] we read up I believe it was an axe when
[37:56] Paul says I turn away from you I go to
[37:59] the Gentiles from this time forth well
[38:03] Paul was doing God recruited Paul you
[38:05] read this story how God how God came
[38:08] down come down Jesus came down the road
[38:11] to Damascus so he recruited Paul so Paul
[38:15] I've got a team down here in Asia Minor
[38:20] Gentiles and they need a coach so God
[38:26] required Paul to be his coach and now if
[38:28] I offend anyone I apologize that's not
[38:30] that I'm not doing taking that lightly
[38:34] they need to know how to run they not
[38:39] only do know they need to know how to
[38:40] run they need to know where they're
[38:41] going they need to know what they're
[38:43] running for they need to know what the
[38:44] prize is so we're going to call Paul the
[38:48] first Gentile to coach so Paul goes down
[38:53] there and he tells them wherefore seeing
[38:56] we also are compassed about with so
[38:58] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[39:01] aside every weight and the scene went
[39:02] through it easy beset us let us run the
[39:05] patience with patience the race that is
[39:07] set before us so he goes down there and
[39:09] he tells him we're running the race
[39:13] we'll get into the prize here in a
[39:15] minute but Paul tells him were running a
[39:17] race how do they know what the rules are
[39:22] how do they know the play of the game
[39:24] how do they know how to do it so Paul
[39:26] begins to write the first playbook yeah
[39:29] he begins writing the book tells him the
[39:32] the plays this is how you do this when
[39:35] Satan brings this against you this is
[39:37] how you count it when when Satan comes
[39:41] against you with with depression with
[39:44] with false doctrine this is what you
[39:46] this is the play to combat that
[39:49] so Paul tells them lay aside everything
[39:54] that is a saying that we apply to our
[39:59] lives every time we hear it so much
[40:00] preaching here lay everything aside that
[40:02] we set you what's what's be setting us
[40:06] what do we have in our life that we sets
[40:11] us to win in a race you have to run to
[40:22] finish in a race you don't necessarily
[40:24] have to run you can walk there's going
[40:26] to be many people finish this race not
[40:28] everybody's getting on the podium
[40:30] there's gonna be many finish you're
[40:33] gonna have some that walk you're gonna
[40:35] have some that run this is a bride that
[40:38] runs so Paul begins to write to pray the
[40:45] playbook and then as they're going on as
[40:51] we talked about earlier they start to
[40:54] look at their own works start taking
[40:56] shortcuts this is the best way to do
[40:59] this this is the best way to do that and
[41:04] what brother Brahim said what it takes
[41:06] to overcome all unbelief so there's an
[41:08] old proverb
[41:09] that's more than a proverb no matter how
[41:13] who is there first you have to play the
[41:15] rules of the game where you'll never win
[41:16] if a runner is running around the track
[41:18] one takes a shortcut cuts through the
[41:21] field and beats the other one thereby
[41:23] half-hour he will be disqualified at the
[41:26] end of the race he's got to play it
[41:28] according to the rules of the game Ruiz
[41:29] is qualified and that's the way we do we
[41:32] have to do the race of life were running
[41:33] now
[41:34] it has to be a played played according
[41:36] to God's qualifications or we lose when
[41:39] we get there
[41:40] whether we're president whether we're
[41:42] the governor or minister or who what
[41:44] church you belong to what denominations
[41:46] the rules of the game has to be kept we
[41:49] must run it fair we must play it by the
[41:51] rules we must preach the word we must do
[41:53] it willingly that's why you see so many
[41:55] people leaving nowadays they can't
[41:58] accept the rules
[42:00] if they go through the playbook they
[42:02] don't see they don't see any play in
[42:03] there that fits them the rules are too
[42:06] hard
[42:07] they tried to take shortcuts that's why
[42:09] you see people go do not nominations now
[42:11] until you they tell you they're as happy
[42:12] as ever they're trying to take the
[42:15] shortcut
[42:16] I'm not counting them people out I would
[42:18] never do that I still pray and believe
[42:21] they've got to bring them back but still
[42:23] they're taking a shortcut many play the
[42:29] game
[42:29] many will finish like this have been
[42:32] only elect few elect will get on the
[42:35] podium when you look at the sports world
[42:37] now they always have all-stars this in
[42:40] sports and basketball and football
[42:42] baseball they all have all-stars some of
[42:46] you know how they get there many don't
[42:48] they have an election
[42:51] there's many on that team there's teams
[42:53] all kinds of teams but to make an
[42:56] all-star to be one of the best you have
[42:59] to be elected you have to get in by
[43:02] election how do they get in Hall of Fame
[43:05] it's an election they get put in the
[43:08] Hall of Fame by election brother Mike
[43:09] Price I was I've been studying this a
[43:11] long time and I was studying this at the
[43:12] time bruh last time by the Mike Price
[43:14] was here when he was preaching about the
[43:16] Hall of Fame and everybody don't go to
[43:19] Hall of Fame everybody don't when you're
[43:25] good enough and you finally you get to
[43:26] go say to the Superbowl where do you go
[43:28] that means you're the best you're the
[43:30] all-stars where do you go you go to the
[43:32] White House you get a banquet see it's
[43:37] not everybody that plays the game gets
[43:40] the big prize
[43:47] so why do we not get any better
[43:49] why do in our life we feel like we're
[43:52] just dredging along we're not we're not
[43:54] running very hard we're you feel like
[43:58] you get up in the morning Lord I can't
[43:59] go on people wonder why their spiritual
[44:02] life is so weak we have practice here
[44:06] three times a week you've got no excuses
[44:14] you've got no excuses
[44:16] I go to practice up on the hill my boy
[44:19] plays if there and I go practice up
[44:20] there and you watch them there's some
[44:24] there that all they care about is
[44:25] getting on the sidelines of a football
[44:27] game and letting the cheerleaders know
[44:28] they're on the team they don't care if
[44:30] they play or not they're just there
[44:33] there's some that get mad because
[44:35] they're not the one running the ball
[44:37] they're not the one playing this
[44:39] position that position we have them here
[44:44] and we got some that just come in and do
[44:47] their job do what they're supposed to do
[44:50] they don't gripe they don't complain
[44:51] they'll sweep the floor they'll dust
[44:54] they'll get somebody a drink of water
[44:56] they don't care they'll do whatever
[44:57] they're asked to do so we have that
[45:02] people you can't understand why you're
[45:05] not getting better when you don't
[45:06] practice you know you sit there mad
[45:10] because you're not singing you're not
[45:12] playing the guitar you're not preaching
[45:15] listen you know if something like that
[45:18] keeps you from praising God I feel sorry
[45:21] for you

[45:26] brother louie makes me stand up brother
[45:28] joel makes me raise my hands brother

[45:33] hand clap of praise listen I'm not

[45:51] raise my hands or give Jesus Christ and
[45:54] Hank type of praise you know what you're
[45:56] telling Christ my disappointment is more
[45:58] worthy than your praise so if we can
[46:04] pray you past that we can use you on the
[46:08] team
[46:14] listen we're gonna make this through
[46:17] we're gonna get through this as a body
[46:20] it's like me and brother Dara was
[46:22] talking earlier it's an individual walk
[46:24] it's an individual race but before you
[46:28] can recognize you are the bride you've
[46:30] got to recognize where you are as an
[46:31] individual it's not a collective memory
[46:36] of no one you're the bride it's each
[46:39] individual no one there the bride thank
[46:43] you for that brother Daryl but you need
[46:48] you got people since I can't do it like

[46:54] just I can't do it that's the devil
[46:58] telling you that the greatest example
[47:01] the greatest example I can tell you of
[47:04] somebody persevering through something
[47:07] and self-will I'm gonna many of y'all
[47:13] member Buster Douglas Buster Douglas was
[47:17] a boxer he was getting ready to fight
[47:20] Mike Tyson Mike Tyson was 37 and L never
[47:23] been beat most of his knockouts were in
[47:25] the first round Buster Douglas was a
[47:27] nobody absolutely nobody busters
[47:33] Douglass's mom died two days before the
[47:35] fight before she died she told everybody
[47:40] my baby's gonna beat Mike Tyson
[47:47] yeah he got knocked down in the seventh
[47:52] round if it wasn't for the bail he'd
[47:56] have been knocked out lost fight he come
[48:00] back in the 10th round and not Mike
[48:02] Tyson al human who wheel human will
[48:08] that's all it was God didn't tell him
[48:13] God didn't tell him nothing you're in a
[48:18] fight every day of your life I think of
[48:21] this every time brother Joel Brown gets
[48:22] up and sings the champion of love we're
[48:25] in a fight every day of our life over
[48:27] here we got we got the devil in this
[48:29] corner he that Satan's got his old
[48:33] demons over here
[48:35] sickness cancer diabetes back problems
[48:38] financial problems depression bitterness
[48:40] sin anything you can imagine he's got
[48:42] him in this corner over here and he's
[48:45] yelling at him telling him you're gonna
[48:47] get that son of God right there or I'm
[48:49] sending you back to hell you're gonna go
[48:52] in there you're gonna attack him you're
[48:53] gonna beat him with fear and doubt
[48:55] you're gonna beat him with reasoning and
[48:57] then there's a son of God standing over
[48:59] here getting ready to face it you think
[49:02] God's standing over yelling at him
[49:04] beating him and telling him what he's
[49:06] gonna do if you don't do this if you
[49:08] don't beat this cancer if you don't if
[49:10] you don't beat this this sin I'm gonna
[49:13] send you to hell God would never do that
[49:14] you never do that but there you are
[49:18] you're everybody's battle is different
[49:20] everybody here tonight if you could put
[49:23] yourself in a ring tonight or something
[49:25] that beats you back something that just
[49:27] gets at you and you can't seem to get
[49:29] over that hump and you're in the corner
[49:33] Mike Tyson would be in the corner cus
[49:35] D'Amato would come up on that side of
[49:37] the ring and say things to him he
[49:38] wouldn't yell at him imagine God doing
[49:42] that to you you're getting ready to go
[49:44] into battle what do you think God would
[49:45] say to you he wouldn't be yelling at you
[49:50] he wouldn't be giving you some some
[49:53] doctrine that you don't understand
[49:57] I believe God would come up to you and
[50:01] say you see that devil of cancer up
[50:04] there brother Keith you can beat him
[50:09] anytime anyplace under any condition
[50:14] that's a quote brother branham gay any
[50:17] condition and he he would let you go if
[50:22] Buster Douglas could take self-will from
[50:27] something that a human being told him
[50:28] and do something that the odds on him
[50:31] were 47 to one and he overcame all the
[50:37] odds and you have a God telling you that
[50:41] has never failed not one time has never
[50:43] failed he's never lied and he tells you
[50:46] you can be him you can beat him it's up
[50:53] to us to believe it
[50:55] it's up it's up to us you get your
[50:59] gloves on we'll call them faith and
[51:03] praise and you go in there and you start
[51:05] beating him back God's not gonna put you
[51:13] in a gang he's they'll put you in a ring
[51:15] he's not gonna put you in a race without
[51:16] properly it quick and giving you the
[51:18] proper equipment he's giving you
[51:21] everything that you need the play books
[51:26] being written the play book for this age
[51:29] has been written we wonder you know
[51:32] Satan toes this situation at me where's
[51:37] it at in the word that I can get the
[51:39] play for this Satan comes against you
[51:42] God says I'll drop a play here in Isaiah
[51:46] 59 19 when the enemy comes in like a
[51:48] flood the Spirit of the Lord will lift
[51:50] up a standard against you you get sick
[51:53] God says well let's put a play right
[51:56] here in mark mark 16 18 they shall lay
[51:59] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[52:00] you get depressed God says I got a play
[52:03] for that peace I leave with you my peace
[52:09] I give unto you not as the world giveth
[52:11] give I unto you any need that you have
[52:14] God says I'll drop another one down in
[52:16] john john 15:8 if you abide in me and my
[52:19] words abide in you shall I ask whatever
[52:22] every you will it should be done unto
[52:24] you you say brother Joe he talks to melt
[52:28] on Satan tops me all the time I came
[52:29] here god from Satan it talks to me all
[52:32] the time that's his job
[52:34] you've got to have an opponent you have
[52:37] to have an opponent it's not a
[52:39] competition if there's not an opponent
[52:40] in there it's just it's just a jog
[52:43] there's nothing pushes you harder than
[52:46] an opponent
[52:48] so you say Satan talks to me all the
[52:50] time well God dropped one in there too
[52:52] revelation 18:4 said I heard another
[52:55] voice from heaven saying come out of her
[52:56] my people run my people run this race
[53:01] that's the other voice from heaven so
[53:04] he's not going to he's not going to put
[53:06] you in the race without properly you
[53:08] equipping you it's on football team do
[53:11] you think they're gonna stick a lineman
[53:12] in there to be the quarterback you think
[53:15] they're gonna book cheerleader out there
[53:16] to be the running back they're not
[53:18] properly equipped you got to be properly
[53:21] equipped that's where this comes in this
[53:24] not only has the list for every play
[53:26] that you need this has all the equipment
[53:28] you need so when you get out there and
[53:34] you performing your best you're giving
[53:38] it all how do you think God is reacting
[53:43] how do you think God reacts when you you
[53:46] give it your best sometimes you don't
[53:48] feel like you're giving your best and
[53:49] sometimes the road ramp said you feel
[53:51] like he's not even there you feel like
[53:53] he's not there you slow down you come to
[53:58] a jog you come to a walk do you raise
[54:01] your hand to be taking out the game
[54:02] because god I can't I can't feel the
[54:05] team owner here so I need a break it's
[54:11] in you it's born in you you don't want
[54:14] to come out you feel like it sometimes
[54:17] but you don't want to come out and we
[54:22] need each other
[54:24] your brother's sister your teammate gets
[54:26] weak gets dragged down we're here to
[54:30] lift him up
[54:31] we're here to lift one another up if I
[54:34] make it you're gonna make it if we're
[54:35] all brides you're not making it without
[54:37] me you're not making it without me at
[54:40] all
[54:42] it's teamwork
[54:46] but don't get upset if you're not the
[54:48] one the featured running back if you're
[54:51] not the star runner in the race if
[54:54] you're not the ten to one favorite in
[54:58] the match it takes us working together
[55:03] listen you're here to protect me
[55:05] and I'm here to protect you we need each
[55:09] other I told you I had this I'm gonna
[55:13] read this this in 1962 the influence of
[55:15] another lebreton when you're playing a
[55:18] ball game and it's football season the
[55:20] thing we want to do is not everybody
[55:22] trait try to take the ball away from the
[55:24] man that's got it we're trying to make
[55:27] he's trying to guard that man protect
[55:29] him let him get through we're trying to
[55:32] make a goal see but could you imagine a
[55:35] team so untrained as to find one man
[55:38] their own man with the ball running to
[55:41] the field go then instead of trying to
[55:43] knock the enemy away from him the
[55:45] opposing team to let your own man that's
[55:50] got the ball take off with it every man
[55:53] try and take the ball of his hand while
[55:54] you're bound to lose and today we have
[55:57] the same thing we see God come on the
[55:59] scene and going to bless a certain thing
[56:02] let's keep all the enemies from it just
[56:04] because you ain't got the ball don't
[56:07] mean you can't block you have to block
[56:09] the brother Terry's running the ball I'm
[56:12] blocked for him today we have the same
[56:17] thing when you see God come on the scene
[56:18] doing a certain and going to bless a
[56:21] certain thing let's keep all the enemies
[56:23] away from it
[56:23] let's use our influence as tackles not
[56:25] runners tackles that protect the runner
[56:28] lets him pack the ball through because
[56:30] there's no opposition all he has to do
[56:32] is just keep running and we should be
[56:34] tackles
[56:35] you know always gonna get to run the
[56:37] ball well I assure you you're not gonna
[56:43] want to run the ball if it's not your
[56:45] play if your number don't wait called
[56:47] you don't want to run the ball you're
[56:50] out of your place running the ball
[56:53] sometimes will include sickness it will
[56:56] include financial downfall all kinds of
[57:00] things hardships I was studying this and
[57:04] I hope you don't mind sister Alice I got
[57:06] to thinking of sister Alice going
[57:09] through her her kidney disease and all
[57:11] that she went through I got to thinking
[57:15] you know Satan come up with a play
[57:18] called kidney disease I know brother
[57:22] Terry would have run the ball for but
[57:25] God said you can't run it she can
[57:27] why wouldn't brother Terry get to run
[57:29] that ball why wouldn't God let brother
[57:31] Terry brother Terry but had done it in a
[57:33] heartbeat he took it
[57:34] why wouldn't he let brother Terry run
[57:36] the ball sister Alice because she
[57:39] couldn't a block like he could you have
[57:43] to we have to block your ball might be
[57:47] cancer your ball might be bitterness it
[57:50] might be depression who knows what it
[57:52] might be I don't want your ball but I
[57:56] will block with everything I got for you
[57:58] I will give it all I got for you that's
[58:03] when you have a team sometimes the ball
[58:06] might be a blessing you might get
[58:08] jealous
[58:10] instead of getting jealous why don't you
[58:11] block for them with that blessing if we
[58:20] can stop for a minute and look at when
[58:22] Jesus was handed the ball God pulled
[58:25] every blocker off the field and gave him
[58:29] the ball and said run it there was
[58:33] nobody blocking for him everything that
[58:37] you had every sin that you could even
[58:39] thought of was placed on him that was
[58:42] his ball that's what he run with who
[58:46] blocked for him you couldn't his own
[58:51] father didn't blocked for him and he
[58:54] took it into the face of the enemy Satan
[58:58] put everything he had on the field but
[59:01] because he did that you don't have to
[59:03] because he was willing to do that one
[59:07] particular play he made a way for you to
[59:12] do all the others whether Bram said and
[59:16] this was in 65 door to the door now if
[59:19] you try to take the ball away from your
[59:21] own man you're just messing up your team
[59:23] guard your man see keep guarding him
[59:26] keep the rest of them so he can make the
[59:28] run we'll have the touchdown after
[59:31] awhile and Jesus will come and then I'll
[59:34] be over brother Branham says the Lord
[59:35] bless you what a way to end the service
[59:39] talking about football don't get upset
[59:44] because you're not running the ball
[59:46] you're still running
[59:49] you're still in the race you're still in
[59:51] the game with my oldest played football
[59:57] yeah we owe a bunch of lime and the
[1:00:01] people after the game you hear you know
[1:00:03] em lawmen they don't ever get no credit
[1:00:06] for nothing
[1:00:07] all the stars go to the runningback the
[1:00:10] receivers the quarterback the
[1:00:11] linebackers they did all the work they
[1:00:17] didn't want that that was their job they
[1:00:22] were finding their place if every single
[1:00:25] one of us could find our place in the
[1:00:28] playbook
[1:00:29] with work we're worrying about how
[1:00:31] you're playing the ball how you're
[1:00:33] running the ball how you're doing your
[1:00:35] play if you're taking my spot you're
[1:00:37] taking her spot find your own spot
[1:00:40] because the person a team has got
[1:00:42] individuals on that don't know their
[1:00:44] spot don't know they're a team they
[1:00:46] figured it out as we're running this
[1:00:54] Brides running yeah she's giving it all
[1:00:57] she's got one thing different about this
[1:01:01] bride she's not getting weaker she's not
[1:01:05] getting weaker she's not running out of
[1:01:08] wind she's giving it all she's got this
[1:01:10] Brides strongest moment would be when
[1:01:13] she steps across the line she'll never
[1:01:15] be any stronger than she will be at that
[1:01:17] time when she crosses the finish line
[1:01:19] that will be her strongest moment so
[1:01:20] she's not getting weaker but we got to
[1:01:23] do it together we got to finish strong
[1:01:25] together you see a brother or sister
[1:01:32] that's on your team this seems like they
[1:01:36] can't figure their spot out they're
[1:01:38] trying they're trying to figure it out
[1:01:41] pick them up pray for them block form
[1:01:47] when I was a freshman in high school I
[1:01:51] run cross-country we didn't have a lot
[1:01:53] of people on the team as a freshman ran
[1:01:55] with the varsity I wasn't any good
[1:01:57] I just ran but I was 14 years old
[1:02:01] we had a senior olan team was like top
[1:02:04] ten in the stage name was Billy Parker
[1:02:07] Billy could run so I get out there I
[1:02:14] start running Billy says you stay with
[1:02:16] me get my pace he slowed his pace down
[1:02:20] so I could keep up it amazes me the
[1:02:28] things that little thing to stick with
[1:02:30] you I begin to lag back because even
[1:02:36] when Billy slowed his speed down I
[1:02:38] couldn't keep up with him Billy said
[1:02:41] grab my jersey he was a senior he was
[1:02:53] popular you know he said yo grab my
[1:02:56] jersey he literally try to pull me
[1:03:01] around I got to thinking about that do
[1:03:10] we offer that kind of help one to
[1:03:11] another sure you know if people have
[1:03:16] that earthly love friendship
[1:03:24] I'll put it this way Viking explained at
[1:03:26] rest sometimes I get in service the
[1:03:31] service is really good I see people
[1:03:32] worship and everybody does it don't make
[1:03:37] you not a Christian make you not have
[1:03:38] the Holy Ghost but something it's just
[1:03:39] like a battle to get through sometimes
[1:03:41] into worship yeah and there's certain
[1:03:45] people that I see worship I don't care
[1:03:48] to tell you now I won't embarrass him
[1:03:49] he's my buddy Greg Robbins when I seen
[1:03:51] brother Greg worship
[1:03:52] I read children I grabbed his jersey
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:07] I've done it with brother Terry sister
[1:04:09] Tessa violet I see somebody the whole
[1:04:11] East Coast and they get that second wind
[1:04:13] Billy would get a second wind and he
[1:04:15] would leave me he needs to Joe grab my
[1:04:17] Jersey
[1:04:18] you know that's teamwork you know I hope
[1:04:25] you don't run but Terry brother Greggy
[1:04:27] I'm gonna reach over spiritually and I'm
[1:04:29] gonna grab that Jersey and I'm gonna let
[1:04:30] you pull me in that's what we do that's
[1:04:33] what we do we're here for each other we
[1:04:41] don't win the race
[1:04:42] that's a bride till all of us are across
[1:04:45] the line
[1:04:47] when we run across chemistry you know
[1:04:50] the team was not considered finished
[1:04:51] unless till the last Runner was in and
[1:04:54] that was it I don't care if you were
[1:04:55] last your team wasn't done until you
[1:04:58] came in we've been in a relay race you
[1:05:01] can look at that at this way we've been
[1:05:03] in a relay race
[1:05:04] for over 2,000 years Paul Tate takes the
[1:05:10] baton and takes off he takes it and he
[1:05:14] runs and he runs and he runs in that
[1:05:17] first Church age and as he runs he hands
[1:05:22] it off Tyrannosaur Iranians runs runs
[1:05:25] and runs and then to Martin Columba so
[1:05:29] on you ever watched a relay race when a
[1:05:35] runner runner has the baton and the
[1:05:36] runners taken off
[1:05:38] you got another runner in front of him
[1:05:40] that he at a certain line in the track
[1:05:43] that's waiting for that baton that
[1:05:46] second runner does not stand there in
[1:05:49] wait he does not stand there and wait
[1:05:54] for that baton he takes out running and
[1:05:57] that previous church age runs right into
[1:06:01] that next church Shh
[1:06:04] that when brother branham took off
[1:06:07] running the seventh church age I'm
[1:06:08] jumping ahead here a minute he didn't
[1:06:11] start out with a baton he was Baptist he
[1:06:15] didn't have this word yet he didn't have
[1:06:17] this word but he was running with his
[1:06:21] hand back he knew something was coming
[1:06:23] you got to keep the hand back brother
[1:06:27] branham's it was talking about it in the
[1:06:28] Philadelphia Church if you want to go
[1:06:30] read it I don't have a quote wrote some
[1:06:31] notes down he said there was an
[1:06:33] overlapping a melting or fading into
[1:06:37] rather than an abrupt end or a clear
[1:06:39] start so the runner has to run into the
[1:06:43] next stage has to hand off the playbook
[1:06:48] from age to age to age the playbook gets
[1:06:51] more explained more explained as it's
[1:06:54] being handed off look at Martin Luther
[1:06:55] he was Catholic he didn't start off with
[1:06:58] this he had two runaways before it was
[1:07:00] poor he ever had justification figured
[1:07:02] out
[1:07:03] John Wesley had to run a while before he
[1:07:06] ever the baton of sanctification was
[1:07:08] ever handed to him so if they had to run
[1:07:12] the race we've got to run the race but
[1:07:19] as we look at the way that relays race
[1:07:22] was was sanctification our justification
[1:07:26] came up to justification didn't stop it
[1:07:32] didn't stop at the six church age line
[1:07:35] you have to have it too it had to carry
[1:07:38] on with it
[1:07:39] justification had to carry on through
[1:07:41] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit it
[1:07:43] had to continue with it to the seventh
[1:07:45] age but now that the seventh age has the
[1:07:49] baton what's that last runner called the
[1:07:54] last runner it's called the anchor
[1:08:00] it's the anchor the anchors the one that
[1:08:04] crosses the finish line with the word
[1:08:06] every single word every dot everything
[1:08:11] that was carried from Paul to our anus
[1:08:15] to Martin to Columba Island down to
[1:08:18] every Church ages this bride will cost
[1:08:21] the finish line with it so Paul jumped
[1:08:38] back to Paula minute so Paula as he's
[1:08:42] speaking to the Gentiles he's telling
[1:08:45] we're gonna run a race he explains to
[1:08:47] him what the word to he has to tell him
[1:08:52] about a prize he got you know telling me
[1:08:55] running for nothing when you start out
[1:08:58] the season say yeah a football game
[1:09:03] you're playing for the Lombardi Trophy
[1:09:05] you know it's there at the end you've
[1:09:08] got to get it baseball you playing for
[1:09:11] the pennant you know what's there you
[1:09:14] know you don't go in blindly when you
[1:09:16] enter a race you those that run you know
[1:09:19] what's at stake so Paul was telling
[1:09:22] there's a prize Corinthians in 1st
[1:09:25] Corinthians 9 he says know ye not that
[1:09:27] they which run in a race one receiveth
[1:09:29] the prize so run that you may obtain and
[1:09:32] every man that striveth for the mastery
[1:09:34] is temperate in all things excuse me
[1:09:38] and now they do it to obtain a
[1:09:39] corruptible crown but we an dunker
[1:09:41] uncorruptible I therefore so run not as
[1:09:45] uncertainly so fight I not as one that
[1:09:48] beateth the air but I keep under my body
[1:09:50] and bring it I keep under my body and
[1:09:53] bring it into subjection lest that by
[1:09:56] any means when i have preached to others
[1:09:57] i myself would be a castaway
[1:09:59] so he says run run for the prize one
[1:10:01] that you may obtain this word obtain
[1:10:04] means to lay hold up as one to make
[1:10:07] one's own to seize upon take possession
[1:10:10] of
[1:10:11] of Christ by his holy power and
[1:10:14] influence laying hold of the human mind
[1:10:17] and wheel in order to prompt and govern
[1:10:20] it
[1:10:21] Christ basically putting your mind on
[1:10:23] cruise control your spirit has control
[1:10:28] of your mind the Spirit of Christ you're
[1:10:32] focused on one thing and that's the
[1:10:34] prize nothing else matters that's what
[1:10:37] your mind is set on Paul says run that
[1:10:40] you may obtain run that you have made
[1:10:42] don't think of nothing else don't think
[1:10:44] of the runner besides you don't think of
[1:10:46] anything that would be said to you keep
[1:10:47] your mind on the prize and keep running
[1:10:51] so Paul tells him in the Philippians I
[1:10:53] press toward the mark of the price of
[1:10:56] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus
[1:10:58] this word press is to run swiftly in
[1:11:01] order to catch a person or thing to run
[1:11:03] after to press on figure T of one who
[1:11:07] runs a race race runs swiftly to reach
[1:11:10] the goal in a hostile manner to pursue
[1:11:13] in a hostile manner basically similar to
[1:11:18] what we said the word run was to exert
[1:11:21] all your energy to exert everything that
[1:11:24] you got Paul saying you pressed towards
[1:11:26] the I press towards the mark in a
[1:11:28] hostile manner because nothing else
[1:11:31] matters nothing else matters in sports
[1:11:36] they call the running backs that run
[1:11:38] like that I call him running angry Paul
[1:11:41] says I'm running angry nothing's gonna
[1:11:45] stand between me and the prize if Satan
[1:11:48] gets in front of me I'm running him over
[1:11:50] that's the mindset we have to have as
[1:11:53] the bride the prizes before us if God
[1:11:56] could could open our eyes spiritually
[1:11:58] and show us how close it was show us how
[1:12:02] close we are to the end he wants you to
[1:12:06] see it through the word but if he was to
[1:12:10] open your mind and let you see it it
[1:12:14] surprised you
[1:12:15] I believe it surprise you how close were
[1:12:17] to the end
[1:12:18] I'm not stolen now for nobody if you
[1:12:20] want to walk you can walk if you want to
[1:12:22] sit take a drink
[1:12:23] whatever
[1:12:24] when I can work across country many
[1:12:26] times I was the last one of my team but
[1:12:28] I never walked I never walked I couldn't
[1:12:31] run fast but I had stamina and I could I
[1:12:35] could run I would pass people that
[1:12:37] walked I would beat many people that
[1:12:39] walked I remember i was telling
[1:12:43] somewhere not too long ago in the state
[1:12:46] of Kentucky before I ran him over at
[1:12:49] ball county over Danville they had a
[1:12:52] state invitation States from teams from
[1:12:55] all over state
[1:12:56] I placed 157th proud of that there's
[1:13:01] about 500 people in the race so I honey
[1:13:03] can do that back but I think I was last
[1:13:07] on my team but my team finished we
[1:13:12] finished the race we didn't walk we're
[1:13:15] gonna try we ran we finished the race so
[1:13:22] Paul says are pressed towards the mark
[1:13:23] the mark the distant mark looked at the
[1:13:27] goal or in one has in view to me the key
[1:13:31] word there in view it's not out of view
[1:13:35] it's in view we've laid our spiritual
[1:13:38] eyes upon the goal we can see it
[1:13:45] Bob Ram says in exposition of the seven
[1:13:48] churches chapter for a crown given to
[1:13:54] the winner of the Olympic race was a
[1:13:56] garland of olive branches but the crown
[1:13:58] spoken of here in Revelation given to a
[1:14:00] martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus
[1:14:03] calls it the crown of life the one crown
[1:14:05] is for those who have striven those are
[1:14:07] others for those who have given both
[1:14:11] crowns are incorruptible they will not
[1:14:13] perish the winners of the worldly race
[1:14:14] of life will soon lose the joy of the
[1:14:16] plaudits of the world their glory will
[1:14:18] fail but those who give their lives for
[1:14:20] God either by daily striving or shedding
[1:14:23] their blood as the crowning sacrifice of
[1:14:26] their lives will be given the crown of
[1:14:27] life
[1:14:30] that's your prize you know the world am
[1:14:34] I not sound like much there's nothing in
[1:14:37] the world I want more nothing and I'm
[1:14:42] gonna run till I get it the thing that I
[1:14:48] like about Paul was Paul was not telling
[1:14:52] Paul was a leader by example he was not
[1:14:56] telling the Gentiles this is what you do
[1:14:58] this isn't how you need to run this is
[1:15:01] what you need to do he wasn't telling
[1:15:03] them that by not knowing how to run the
[1:15:07] race Paul ran it Paul fought the fight
[1:15:11] fought the fight he got in the ring he
[1:15:13] carried the ball Paul knew how to do it
[1:15:17] in second Timothy 4:7 Paul says I fought
[1:15:21] a good fight I have finished my course I
[1:15:24] have kept the faith henceforth there is
[1:15:26] laid up for me a crown of righteousness
[1:15:28] which the Lord the righteous judge shall
[1:15:31] give me at that day and not to me only
[1:15:33] but unto all them that love his
[1:15:35] appearing
[1:15:36] this word course from here I don't mean
[1:15:38] to keep throwing word definition to you
[1:15:40] I apologize but the word course that is
[1:15:43] given here
[1:15:44] it's alternate to the word run that we
[1:15:46] looked at earlier what Jesus used in the
[1:15:50] prodigal son Paul says I have finished
[1:15:56] my course saying I have finished running
[1:16:00] with all I had I have finished giving my
[1:16:04] all theirs I have nothing left to give
[1:16:07] because I've gave it all and through it
[1:16:09] all I've kept the faith I ran hostile I
[1:16:14] run out of extreme peril I ran exerting
[1:16:19] all I had to overcome I have finished
[1:16:21] that and I still kept the faith
[1:16:25] see Paul had faith that he would reach
[1:16:29] he would reach the prize
[1:16:36] the same spirit that led Paul through
[1:16:40] that age down through every age is the
[1:16:42] same spirit leading through this age we
[1:16:49] see people that are being influenced now
[1:16:51] to change the playbook as we would call
[1:16:55] it a do it take it away
[1:16:57] get it to fit their life and get it to
[1:16:59] fit the race they're running get to fit
[1:17:01] the game they're running but we're in a
[1:17:06] race we're a spiritual race we got to
[1:17:16] finish quickly but Bram said what it
[1:17:20] takes to overcome there's an old proverb
[1:17:25] that's more than a proverb no matter who
[1:17:28] who is there first you have to play the
[1:17:31] rules of the game or you'll never win if
[1:17:34] a runner is running around the track the
[1:17:35] one takes a shortcut cuts through the
[1:17:37] field and beats the other one thereby
[1:17:39] half hour still he will be disqualified
[1:17:42] at the end of the race he's got to play
[1:17:44] it according to the rules of the game or
[1:17:46] he's disqualified why would why would we
[1:17:50] why would anybody no one what the rules
[1:17:54] of the game no one that God put the
[1:17:56] rules there why would we try to alter
[1:17:58] that why would we try to change that
[1:18:02] it's man-made it's not gonna work
[1:18:06] it's been the gods have been that way
[1:18:08] all through every church age it's the
[1:18:10] same rules for everybody he didn't
[1:18:13] change him with these church age he
[1:18:16] didn't change him at all
[1:18:17] Paul's brother Bream said that's the way
[1:18:20] we have to do the race of life that
[1:18:21] we're running now has to be played
[1:18:23] according to God's qualifications or we
[1:18:25] lose when we get there
[1:18:26] I believe we read that earlier must have
[1:18:28] headed here twice Paul said I believe in
[1:18:31] Hebrews the twelfth chapter that seeing
[1:18:33] we are compassed about such a great
[1:18:34] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:18:36] every weight and seeing that doesn't
[1:18:38] beset us that we may run the patience
[1:18:39] the race is set before us Paul was
[1:18:42] speaking in the Olympics and so forth
[1:18:43] and that was in Greece in Rome so forth
[1:18:46] he knows you had to play that game fair
[1:18:47] if he didn't you'd be disqualified and
[1:18:50] tonight as born-again Christians as
[1:18:52] believers here at the end time we've got
[1:18:55] to play the game according to the rules
[1:18:56] we've got to run the patience the race
[1:18:58] that sit before us looking to the author
[1:19:01] and finisher Jesus Christ and
[1:19:05] everybody's gonna run with me stand
[1:19:15] let's hurry I know about you but well I
[1:19:17] do know about you but I'm not walking
[1:19:20] I'm not walking I've done made up my
[1:19:24] mind well I might get hindered I promise
[1:19:27] you I might get hindered but you're
[1:19:31] living in a time and age and people
[1:19:34] don't want to run this race no more
[1:19:36] they've lost a view of what's at the
[1:19:38] finish line
[1:19:39] they've lost to desire they lost lost
[1:19:42] the concept of team it's a body move
[1:19:49] it's a body move each individual finding
[1:19:52] their place on the team when everybody
[1:19:56] does what they're supposed to on a
[1:19:57] football team when everybody does their
[1:19:59] assigned positions you got winners you
[1:20:03] have winners I remember enough telling
[1:20:09] you I run across country is a freshman
[1:20:13] and I wasn't the fastest but growing up
[1:20:21] in the messenger's there's things that
[1:20:23] you stand out to you and when my friends
[1:20:28] you know we hear we hear all the time
[1:20:32] you know brother branham said that
[1:20:35] somebody would be there to greet you so
[1:20:39] there's those on the sidelines cheering
[1:20:42] you on those that have crossed the
[1:20:46] finish line cheering you on you know we
[1:20:52] had a coach coach garnet Parker coach
[1:20:54] garnet coach Parker would get there
[1:20:57] early many times and possibly go over
[1:21:01] the track he would go before you and you
[1:21:04] know and he he could let you know if
[1:21:06] when you come out of the woods it's
[1:21:08] gonna go to the trails going to the
[1:21:09] right stay low don't get up on the high
[1:21:12] side it's rocky up there different
[1:21:14] things and I got things about that you
[1:21:18] know the seventh age coach that we had
[1:21:20] in this age she's done the same thing I
[1:21:22] was reading the other day I was reading
[1:21:26] the other day when he was saying he had
[1:21:29] that vision of the bride he was
[1:21:31] screaming out to her stay in line he was
[1:21:34] fulfilling his position as a coach I
[1:21:37] don't know if he looked at it that way
[1:21:39] this is just an allergy so it's not a
[1:21:41] type I'm not typing
[1:21:47] one thing that stood out to me when I
[1:21:49] ran many times meteor one other guys
[1:21:52] their freshman we beat last but my
[1:21:56] friends that had gone across over did
[1:22:02] come inside maybe two or three hundred
[1:22:08] yards away and industries when it comes
[1:22:11] your last stretch would be straight and
[1:22:15] they start yelling at you run don't let
[1:22:18] that guy behind you catch he's gaining
[1:22:19] on you run give it all you got you would
[1:22:23] look down and the in line you could see
[1:22:26] coach Parker up there screaming at you
[1:22:32] Jove you better run and you ran coach
[1:22:41] Parker told you to run you ran I don't
[1:22:44] care how bad you were you ran but in
[1:22:47] thinking of that do you realize how many
[1:22:50] people that have crossed over
[1:22:54] tonight just tonight in this service are
[1:22:57] cheering you on or screaming out to you
[1:23:00] don't stop don't stop stay on the low
[1:23:04] side don't go too far on the high side
[1:23:06] we've been that way before we know where
[1:23:10] it leads they're encouraging you a great
[1:23:16] cloud of witnesses and you got a profit
[1:23:19] on the other side of the finish line
[1:23:20] it's standing there watching you his
[1:23:24] voice is still screaming out
[1:23:26] [Music]

[1:42:12] you look in the back of the playbook we
[1:42:13] win I don't care how bad it looks we win
[1:42:17] it's wonderful I just really enjoyed the
[1:42:20] servicemen did you enjoy what the Lord
[1:42:21] had for today
[1:42:25] [Applause]
[1:42:29] you know I was thinking I also ran
[1:42:32] cross-country not in high school I ran
[1:42:35] ran it in the army
[1:42:37] I remember one race just praying close
[1:42:44] but I used to I would always try to hold
[1:42:49] back when the gun went off I've trained
[1:42:52] at a certain pace but I would never run
[1:42:54] that pace at the start of the race I
[1:42:56] would run a different pace and I would
[1:42:57] always hold back and is about the 3.2
[1:43:01] mark that I would start I would start
[1:43:03] kicking and that's when I would kick
[1:43:05] into the pace that I trained and and I
[1:43:08] did that because when the gun went off a
[1:43:11] lot of people took off like you know
[1:43:13] they had ten yards to run and he just
[1:43:15] went but then they would start falling
[1:43:16] back but it always gave me built my
[1:43:19] confidence when I started catching up
[1:43:21] with the ones that was way out in front
[1:43:23] of me and I would actually start passing
[1:43:24] them in and I learned that when you hit
[1:43:27] the top of the hill it's just human
[1:43:29] nature to kind of relax a little bit and
[1:43:31] so I would always use that moment to
[1:43:33] kick harder and and and and to come down
[1:43:36] the hill and not in a relaxed but in a
[1:43:38] hostile fashion which I didn't under and
[1:43:41] stand at it until tonight but that's
[1:43:42] what I did I would run like that and and
[1:43:44] I remember it was right after this
[1:43:46] certain race and it was about the five
[1:43:50] mile mark of the race I run the 10k 6.2
[1:43:54] miles and I come down off of the hill
[1:43:56] and of course we were running in Fort
[1:43:57] Bragg and we hit in the bottom of this
[1:44:01] hill was heavy sand and I remember this
[1:44:04] particular race I I come out off the
[1:44:06] hill and I five miles I was I was tired
[1:44:10] and blood brother Joe said you just
[1:44:14] start giving everything you've got when
[1:44:16] you start kicking you just start kicking
[1:44:17] and I remember coming down into that
[1:44:20] sand and hitting it and all my lungs
[1:44:22] were on fire and my legs were on fire
[1:44:24] and it I couldn't anybody's ever ran in
[1:44:26] saying you know it's just so hard to get
[1:44:27] you legs and and I didn't even notice
[1:44:30] him when I first came down off of the
[1:44:32] hill but one of my teammates wilkerson
[1:44:34] had pulled a hamstring and lot brother
[1:44:38] Joe said your team has to finish the
[1:44:40] race so he was heading
[1:44:42] the finish line with a pulled hamstring
[1:44:45] and when I hit the sand all of a sudden
[1:44:48] I heard this voice they begin to say run
[1:44:52] Ward run you can make it you can do it I
[1:44:56] was with an airborne unit he started
[1:44:58] hauling airborne airborne
[1:45:00] you can do it Ward you can do it forward
[1:45:02] and when I've climbed the hill I could
[1:45:05] still hear him when I crossed over the
[1:45:06] other hill he was still yelling with
[1:45:08] everything with it
[1:45:10] run Ward finish the course that day I
[1:45:16] finished 12th out of 850 some runners I
[1:45:19] finished 12th that day because somebody
[1:45:23] encouraged me you know I may not be able
[1:45:27] to preach like brother Terry or brother
[1:45:29] Joe or some of these other brothers that
[1:45:31] you may not be able to do something
