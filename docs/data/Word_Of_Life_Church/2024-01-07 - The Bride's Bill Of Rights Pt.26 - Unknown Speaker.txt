I came so far from where I was to where you are the bitter tears the long a the many ways a heart can break but you were at the center of it all to free from the prison of the Fall there was no heill to s for me to climb no roll too long or hard to make you mine I gave all I had to give it was worth the cost to say I love you from an Old Rugged Cross [Music] I took your guilt I bore your shame child I would do it all again my Open Arms reached out in grace to p P you in to loves and prce it's been spoken in a thousand different ways but the cross said more than words could ever say there was no heel to steep for me to climb no road too long or hard to make you mine I gave all I had to give it was worth the cost to say I love you from an Old Rugged Cross oh can you hear The Echoes from that [Music] here I Loved You Then and child I love you still there was no heal to Ste for me to climb no road too long long or hard to make you mine I gave all I had to give it was worth the cost it was worth it all to say I love you to tell you I love you from an Old Rugged Cross praise the Lord what of the law was given on the basis of the way that the measure of love that God would use to be able to judge the people that kept the law and they the way they would be able to express it to others it was built upon this principle love thy neighbor as thyself and actually their neighbor would have not been the Philistines the am amorites the Hittites the jebusites it would have been Jewish neighbors so they all kind of lived in a tribal order in a communal thing so that was the basis of the law this is where God founded it but in the New Testament Jesus says I write you or bring you a new commandment which is not based upon love your neighbor as you love yourself but love them more than yourself that's why this is totally unattainable completely unattainable by any person other than God himself human beings cannot love like that or people can be able to reach out and give a little something to somebody that they don't know you know is a Christmas time all the people stand around jingling their little bells and will you help the poort and will you do this that and the other I don't want to see see it a week before Christmas I want to see it 3 weeks after the Lord wants to see it every day of our life that we live like him in that awesome love God bless you hope youall are doing well today what a beautiful time it is for us to be together here in this January I say we take advantage of it every time that we have the opportunity don't you we know before long snow and I start moving through and it's going to cancel us and this that and other and I hate it so bad I can hardly stand it but we'll have church as much as we can and just be mindful of that 1 John 4 verse 16 I greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus and trust the Lord will help us today as we Endeavor to look into his word and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us God is love and remember Satan cannot love people who serve him he doesn't love them he hates them it's the foundation of his kingdom can you imagine the turmoil in hell every day his kingdom is built upon Rebellion against God's word it must be awful in hell every day the prophet told us the reason that there's Wars against Nations all this going on between um Israel and you know Hamas and Hezbollah and all that sort of stuff you understand what does all that demons over these nations are fussing and arguing and fighting with one another and they take people as their instrumentality to raise up all this war it must be awful down in hell every day notice John says in the love that God ha to us God is love he that dwelleth in love if you notice John doesn't say he that's got a little bit of love dwelleth in God but he that dwelleth in love I love the meaning of this word abide remain continue to remain not to depart to continue to be present not to become another or different so actually love is where you live that's where you live at your residence he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him so God is love and then to live in fellowship with him is to live in his love he or she who is full of God's love and their love toward God and their lord their love toward one another is full of God why would I want just a little bit of him if I could be totally full of him is that what you want with all your heart how many lets of be remember today as we pray God bless you each of you let's just bow our heads heavenly father as we've gathered here today Lord that we could worship and sing and how moving songs are Lord we thank you for the songs today in the worship Lord Jesus when you come to this earth there was no Hill that was too hard for you to climb there was no reproach so low that you wouldn't deal with it for us we thank you for that Lord God we desire to be the type of people you'd want us to be where we can love in that same depth and degree of love and as I said it's inhuman it is not human at all to love this way to love this deeply but we need your help Lord you saw the needs of your people that were signified but uplifting their hand I pray that you'd be mindful of us today help me to get out of the way father I need you so much Lord I pray father that you'd be mindful of those families who've lost loved ones in the last little bit Lord sister Sam's passing over I pray that you'd be mindful of her family and help them Lord and Lord Brother Calvin slipping out and also now father brother Jee Littleton we pray that you'd be mindful the Lord of their family that's left behind and we ask dear God that you would help each of us that we can make preparation to meet him we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be seated let's read if you would there in verse 17 John goes on to say here in is our love made perfect so so actually what we received when we come to the process of the new birth and we were justified by faith Sanctified cleansed and then filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost what we received was not complete but it was a little button we know that the word here perfect does not mean sinless or without fault or flawed but it's growing to a state of maturity to reach its height of what God wants it to be John uses the word here in as our love made perfect so when you got it it wasn't in its perfect form I believe I got saved whenever I was a 12year old boy sometime later they begin to talk about the Holy Ghost so I went back to the altar they started praying for me again they was beating me on the back you know pray praying for me and praying for me one or two of them took their hands and you know sort of like that that's probably the way they thought this helping me get the Holy Ghost but all I done was bit my tongue several times as that was going on but I do believe I got something like some of you that that come out of Pentecost you believe you had something I believe that I got something but I don't believe I could have got the fullness of the token life under a Pentecostal message I don't believe you can get it there I don't believe you can get it in any other denominational system because it's controlled by man but it must come under an even in time message to will we receive that fullness now that fullness does not come in just an instant but it grows it matures even the character of our Lord Jesus had to be developed that's how far he condescended when he stepped down you imagine moving from that Realm of the logos moving from that realm Where Angels loved him praised him adored him nobody ever hated him or despised him to come from that to come down here to where people called him bbub laughed at him ridiculed him mocked at him why was he doing that in order to allow his human character God never had a human character until Christ come on the earth so God wanted a human character ain't that strange all of our life we want to become something other than human and for millions and maybe billions of years he wanted to become something other than God but it couldn't be nothing any greater so he wanted to become something less so he could take us in our fallen State and make us bigger than who we were that's real love brother sister now whenever we receive that is it is it that real genuine love it is but it's in seed form and it's so small and then John says herein is our our love made perfect so it grows and it matures that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world so perfect then is complete and it's grown up so our love still today I don't know about yours I think if You' be honest you'd say with me that my love is still in development how many would say yours is still growing you're learning to love more you're learning how to forgive and learning how to put up with people my main problem in life is not with donkeys I've never had too many problems with donkeys had a few problems with dogs not many really U never have I had a run in with an elephant I got scared by one real one really bad one time in Africa U and whenever I was there and a big elephant big tusker as they call him got after us and and the guy that was there he had been there and done that before so all he' done was got his weapon up and went just like that soon as that elephant heard it it stopped turned and went the other way way I've never had too many problems with elephants zebras any of that sort of thing most of my problems in life is yeah you've guessed it been with human beings is that where most of yours have laid most of my problems has been with uh you know with people and and that's the way of course that it's going to be and i' I've found out a long time ago that my character is going to reach a greater height of where God wants it to be by dealing with people and some people probably say the same thing about me brother Donnie put me here in life life so I would be a better man well God bless you I'm glad I'm good for something so each of us no doubt have found people that just seem to push our buttons and it's just something about them that they don't you know they don't even really try maybe sometimes but there just something about them that just irritates us and just really bothers us and there's other people you just can never be around them enough you just so enjoy being around them and they put out this great atmosphere spere and you just think it's awesome but yet we know those type of people generally aren't the ones that allowed us to be Tried by and it was the same with the Lord Jesus had he been totally surrounded by everybody that loved him everybody that praised him then part of his human character would have never reached that state of development that it needed to be and you and I are going to be exactly the same way so our love then must reach a spot to where that it can be the same type of love that he had himself so where we at then we're in the stages of development because remember I keep saying it but love is like every other Grace that God gives us love must be developed unlike gifts now gifts come gifts can hit they can miss they can be right they can be wrong believe me I saw my share of them in Pentecost wherever You' see one and it would be right on I mean exactly and the very next person say that that they'd call out miss it a million miles and then you say how in the world can that be well that's the way gifts can operate but when it comes to love it's not that it hits and misses the thing that with love is it's the depth of the intensity that we have and if you're thinking today in your mind well I've got to love people more I've got to love people more it's not just loving people more it's loving him more you see the key is the more we fall in love with him the more we will find it's automatic the more we love people around us that's the way it was with him so John 3:16 of course we all know by heart for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved great love is that right phenomenal love and then 1 John 3:16 turns right around to become the manifestation of that love in the human heart now Jesus says then in St John 13:34 read it with me a new commandment I give to you that you love one another now that's not new because the Old Testament the Torah told them that so they're supposed to love their neighbor as they love their themselves so this is the standard this is the foundation of the way the Torah is going to do now if you love your neighbor as yourself and you treat them right then all of the law is consummated in that because all the rest of them will fill for their place because they couldn't even do that without the right love for God you see we get it in in in its order but we get the order misarranged sometime we that well I've got to love everybody okay okay okay I've got all that what do I have to do to do it Fallen more in love with him you see if they loved him and they worshiped him and there was no other God before him and they loved him right then that would help them in turn love their neighbor nebor right and they would treat one another right so notice Jesus says a new commandment I given to you that you love one another that's not new here's the new part as I have loved you that ye also love one another now notice this so what makes his commandment different is it's based upon a new standard a new standard altogether so the new standard is that we don't love one another as we love ourself but we love one another as he loves us and how is that come on does Jesus love us when we're wrong does Jesus forgive us when we ask him to does Jesus care for those who hate him this is the standard so the standard then is not okay well I love those that love me and I'm good to those that are good to me and those that treat me nice I'll treat them nice bad you're no more than a sinner if that's all the love you have but the new standard is that we can love people on the basis of Jesus loving us so he said well no it's all based on Merit it's all based on what they do no it's not it's not based on any of that at all Brother Don you mean to tell me that you're telling us that we've got to love people that would absolutely hate us or kill us absolutely right you see that's the kind of love he had and that's the way he loved his own not only his own that he loved the world the cosmos so John 3:16 is not just primarily to the elect of God the bride seek God so Lov the world well that's Cosmos that's world order but he loved the elect before the foundation of the world so he didn't wasn't even necessarily referring to you as cosmos but you were part of him before there was ever a devil you were part of him before there's ever any sin on the earth is that right so now he says I want you all to love one another as I have loved you oh my goodness so should I stop now we have make an alter call as I have loved you so the context in points to the laying of the foundation of one another's lives for someone else so Jesus then became the ambassador of this new kind of love now he didn't just come with a book under his arm and said here I'm going to hand out this book and this is what y'all are supposed to do but he actually did it first himself if you can get in your mind he was the first human being that ever expressed this kind of love it had never been expressed before Adam had a no doubt a great great Fountain of of love I honest with you I don't know exactly what Adam did have in the Garden of Eden because whatever he had he could backslide from he could fall from people say well I I want to go back to Adam well I don't I want to go farther back to where Adam was because whatever Adam had he lost it but I want something that I'll never lose don't you so no doubt it was great it was Paramount whatever it was that he had but he was never able to experience any when that image of God left him than the very woman that he gave his kingdom for he turned right around and said God the woman you gave me she's the cause of all this anyway so whatever it was he lost it he left it so this is going to be the Paramount sign of every True Believer I find this to be absolutely astonishing because as Jesus was the embodiment of God's love then the elect of God are to be the embodiment of Christ's love now don't get in your mind I'm talk talking about this Le to seeing you know lovey doy ooey gooey type of stuff that everybody's going to heaven and we we love everybody and we accept them the way they are no God wants to change people but we love them while they're in the process of being changed is that right now the modern day they talk about love love of and it's easy to see they don't even know what kind of love they're talking about because they think that you can live any way you want to live and everybody's still wind up going to Heaven there's only one way to heaven and that person's name is Jesus Christ and if you love him then you will do what he says do it's just that simple so the Lord Jesus is showing them then this is going to be the sign wherein people will know that you are my disciples now self-love is the highest love that we are born with we can't help it it's just that that we inherited by the Fall so the new commandment then will go absolutely contrary to selflove because self- Lov if somebody does something to us it's just in our human nature we're going to get them back it may take us a month it may take us two it may take us five or six years but it's not we hold that inside of us and we'll get them back if it's the last thing we do that's why we got to be born again so then we learn to live and learn to love in a standard of love that as was our lord Jesus was himself which is self abandoning self denying love so Jesus says that you can't even be saved unless you deny yourself and take up your cross and follow me I've said it many times before I'll say it again that the Lord Jesus spoke more about your cross than he spoke about his so it must be pretty important is that right now notice with me in verse 35 now remember these are not the words of a theologian they're not the words of a Preacher they're the words of the Lord Jesus by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples I want you to notice he does not mention speaking in tongues he does not mention healing miracles signs Jesus don't speak contrary to his word word he could not say this here in St John 13 and then go to Matthew 24:24 and said they be anointed ones in the last days and they'll have signs and wonders so if that is the sign of a True Believer there cannot be any false anointed ones isn't it amazing that Jesus does not say because you all shout this will be the one inevitable sign that people will know you are mine because you lay hands on the sick this is the one sign do you understand the sign he gave cannot be impersonated right miracles signs wonders can be impersonated as a matter of fact Harvest Time December 2764 the prophet tells us Satan can hand out them Supernatural gifts by the handfuls but he can't do this oh my so you mean there's one sign in all of Christianity that is a dead giveaway way that you had pass from deaths unto life well according to the Lord Jesus notice by this shall all men know now people want the evidence of the Holy Ghost and and people want to know how how can I know how can I be sure well here's the man who gave the Holy Ghost I reckon he would know so by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one to another but yet it can't be the kind of love that Lea specializes in oh we love everybody we love everybody yeah they they say that until you give them a little bit about the word and you cross them a little bit let me tell you something friends as a pastor just take my word for this I will know folks in a way you don't even know them because when I cross them I see the real them oh my oh my yeah then you go to see all kinds of feathers getting ruffled and you're not sure if they're Buzzard feathers if scavenger feathers they're saying they're eagle feathers but the temper but sure don't match it now I want you to notice that in the first century on up to the second century that the historians of the day they noticed great things about the children of God now there was great signs and wonders of course that the early church did but it was not that that distinguish the Christians apart from other things now they did make note of course of the signs and the Wonders and the Miracles but down through the annals of History it was not just the the miraculous and the supernatural that they noted about these Christians that was so great this is one of the ones I'd like to read to you today that the Heathen would say it this way they love one another they are ready to lay down their lives for each other now this was a common saying among the he even then that they would say about Christians now it wasn't brother Joel that they said boy have you seen how when you go to their meetings how they shout boy have you noticed in women's hair how long it is have you noticed in men how they don't dress like women and all have you noticed all of that but what stood out to them the most the most outstanding thing was how they loved one another and they were willing to die for each other no wonder when the prophet went there on the curtain of time and he said lay aside everything until you get perfect love now how this has changed in Christianity down through the years so what are Christians known by now well for many of them well I go to this church I belong to this I belong to that that's not what I'm asking you how are you known well I brother Donnie I'm a woman I got long hair I've known many women with long hair got a big old long tongue about that long to match it too well praise the Lord I got to be honest with you some men's worse gossipers than women are well thank you Jesus you see it it was a rabinal way that rabbis rabbis they they chose their followers the people never chose to follow a rabbi but rabbis chose their followers and each Rabbi would have his own little special doctrinal view about this and that and the other most of the of the disciples were Pharisees so they were under a Pharisee teaching and the rabbis of the Pharisees but yet each Rabbi then would have his own little identification of the way his disciples would dress and do and behave so God had told them that they would take a a ribband r i BB A and D a rib band of blue and they would wear that on the bottom of their garments so when you saw a man or woman that had this little bit of blue on the bottom you knew immediately that they were a Jew but certain rabbis then would enlarge that border and say some of them would make it the hand breaths and then others would make it a cubid which would be around 18 in so you knew when you saw that individual that they belong belong to this Rabbi now those of you that have ever seen Jews if you've been to New York City or you've been to Israel or any place where you got a conglomeration of a bunch of Jews gathered together and you'll see some men that wear a big hat about this big and it's made out of long wool it'll be about this tall something like that and it sits down on top of their head real shimmery and shiny and it looks sort of like a bear's coat is sort of what it looks like and then you know when you see that they belong to a certain uh teaching from Europe most of them come from the Ukraine but they come from under the teaching of a certain Rabbi then you will see others they will have a total different hat and then others will have the little curly cues that come down on the side of their face now that is an identification that when you look at them you know oh they belong to Rabbi so and so and they belong to Rabbi so and so so they follow his teaching well here the Lord Jesus and they did call him Rabbi the Lord Jesus said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you now that was the way rabbis did but he said I'm going to give you all an identification that is different than Pharisee sadducee seen uh zeelot I'm going to give you one that's going to be so different that you were going to stick out so much now having been there in Israel a few years ago and you would see the Orthodox and you would see the ultra Orthodox and you we was able to go in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem near where they were so you see all these Jews coming and going and many of the women you see them with long dresses just like our sisters wear but one thing that you'll notice about some of them according to the rabbi they come from under is that the women will shave their hair and they wear wigs now that's under the teaching of a particular Rabbi or a particular teaching so they are known by what they put on on the outside so the men will dress in black and they will go to the when they go to the Wailing Wall which we were there the men on the left hand side the women on the right hand side and I was able to go back into the ancient part of it still sitting there and there was those Jews there was the young and old and the Herod and the different ones and they're sitting there and as they're reading the Psalms they're sitting there like this because they think you cannot read the word without being stimulated well if an Old Testament does that what off the New Testament do to us so and it's amazing because me being a gentile they would not let me and the other brothers that I were with they would not let us walk down to the Wailing Wall unless we put a little cap over the top of our head now we're on their Turf so if we're going to come in to their place then we've got to put that on our head now for others that would not be enough they would rather I would have one of them woolly hairs on I've got enough wool on the top of my head anyway I don't need another one but each one of them so you look and there was a little group over here and they had one hat on here's another little group and they'd never have another hat but they knew each other by the way they look now Jesus said this is what I'm going to do to you all I as your Rabbi I am going to give you an identification which has never been given to any other disciples since the fall of Man it won't just be the length of your dress it won't just be the church that you go to but it will be a mannerism and a way about you which is So Divine that even Sinners will be able to know there's something different about you they may not agree with you and they may not understand you but by this Jesus said all men will know so they're not guessing so it makes me wonder friends how far we've missed the real sign of what God wants us to be amen I want you to notice says then that the followers of the great teachers would have this distinctive Mark notice what Jerome the historian said Jerome refers to the well-known saying of St John at Ephesus now this was John say this is the Lord's commandment if you love one another it is enough wow boy that sure wouldn't be enough for us would it I mean we got so many doctrines and we split hairs and divide the hairs and then we split the splits off the splits of the hairs and we divide the splits off the splits off the divides man alive you know we get down there but so it makes me wonder how much of our hearts has been turned back to the teaching of our Apostolic fathers well praise the Lord so it was such an outstanding love and here's Jerome quoting John that John said at Eis remember that's where he was from there this is the Lord's commandment if you love one another it is enough you said that sounds so simple but it's much harder to do than it sounds so you see following in divine order you cannot love one another the way you're supposed to until you love God the way you're supposed to love him and if you love him the way you're supposed to love him then all the dos and the don'ts and thou shalt and thou shalt not that comes right with it too but a lot of people try to keep the Thou shalt and thou shalt not and thou shalt and thou shalt not and dos and the don'ts and they try to keep all of that without loving him right and then after a while they just get wor out with all the dos and the don'ts well I don't want to do it no more I don't blame you I wouldn't want to do it without him either but if you love him right then the dos and the don'ts it ain't a burden it ain't torment my goodness I'm glad I live the way that I live I'm glad what about you I'm glad that I live a separated life from the world it's not this burden oh my brother Donnie can only have one wife well was the one I've got why would I want another one why in the world would I want to have three or four wives or or a wife and a girlfriend I want to stand here today and tell you my wife is my girlfriend and has been for 50 years and I love her now more than i' I've ever loved her why because of law because I'm afraid go to hell no because she's such a great woman she's a Godly woman and our love is getting stronger and stronger that's the way I feel about the Lord Jesus well I I'd love to live for him but it's just so hard I got to quit this and I got to give up that you're looking at it in the wrong way if you fall in love with him you realize the devil ain't got nothing out here that is greater than the love Jesus can give you and what Jesus can and wants to do for you notice this historian called tholu t h o l l u c k refers to tertian declaration now this was an early century preacher they love before they know each other but human love is we have to know each other and then the more we know about each other the less we do love because said boy I didn't know she was that way I didn't know he was that way i' never got involved with him you know how human relationships are right but yet this was what stuck out to the historians in so much that this historian would write this of tertian and say they love before they know know each other Lucian tell by the name he was a Roman historian and Lucien this notice what Lucien said about our brothers and sisters our founding Church their Master makes them believe they are brothers I believe we still got the same master notice how the outsider now would would look at it and and they they couldn't understand this up cuz remember in the first second third fourth Century we're talking about under the Roman Empire it was an age of so so much self-indulgence whatever felt good whatever thought you wanted to do do it well just do it oh they were so liberal because it was emerging together of course of the Greek Empire before that wind up in the Roman Empire every Empire has totally annihilated itself from within which is why our nation's where she's at now that's why there's no hope for our nation as a whole because it is rotten from the very core we don't have to worry about the Japanese we don't have to worry about Hamas coming over here and taking us over we have been annihilated from within our own ranks may God help us it don't happen to us in the message notice in so Luci and looking at it as an outsider you can tell this guy did not understand the Holy Ghost he did not understand now he's looking at it from just a mind perspective and what he had heard no doubt the man had heard him talk about love and and heard him talk about loving one another and the way he looked at it it was so strange and he identified the Lord Jesus as their Master their Master makes them believe they are brothers so as long as this type of love was prevalent in the first church age they were totally Unstoppable there was not enough lines that could kill kill it there wasn't enough fire that could stop it there was not enough Nero there was not enough hadrians there was not enough Emperors on the earth to stop it so Satan knew he had to attack something it was their love Revelation 2:4 nevertheless I have somewhat against thee the complaint of God of God against the Ephesian Church age because thou Hast now many many people quote this wrong they say lost that's not what the Bible says the Bible says left if you lose something you may or may not find it and you may or may not know where it is but if you left something intentionally and you left left it on your table or you left it in your bedroom then you know how you're going to get it back you're going to have to go back to your bedroom back to your table back to the altar to be able to find where you left it now this age had run oh my so beautifully for so many years for about 20 years or so they were the alpha bride the type of the seed which was going to be sewn in the beginning in the alpha stage and would be harvested in the Omega stage in the end time for 20 years they had a world shaking Revival is it were the very deity of God was among them they healed the sick like Jesus they raised the Dead Like Jesus they cast out devils like Jesus but yet they done greater they love the way he loved so from within their human Temple proce ceeded Divine love which was God's Own love himself and Satan must have hated them how they got along and they would settle their differences and they loved one another and they would forgive one another they would reach out to the lost and they would do everything that they did was on the basis not of Personality it was not based on well this man or that man it was one basis of their foundation and that was Divine love and Satan said I hate this stuff I hate it so his goal was if I can get them away from loving God right the church will lose its power they won't have as many miracles and signs you said what he wants us to do he wants us to focus on getting the signs back first we got the cart before the horse Let's Fall In Love with him first and then true gifts will manifest theirself and it won't be based upon selfishness or this great man and that great man and this great church there ain't no great ones Among Us only one and that's the Lord Jesus Hallelujah nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou H has left thy First Love Now please keep this in mind such love is not human you cannot do this I cannot do it it's totally impossible my mother and father could not hand this down to me it's impossible for a human to love with Divine love unless Divine love from God comes within their soul so as we love God who we don't see that unseen power develops in us a perfect love to help those that we do see how many of y'all's ever seen God have you ever seen his face his hand his foot none of you and yet you love a being that you've never even seen right how many wants to love him more well why you going to love his eyes is it his feet you're going to love more what do we want to love more about him his nature his character what he is what he does what he says that's who he is so we don't love him then and we don't judge him and we don't base our love upon what we see but yet that's the way we love others come on well did you see her the way she done me did you see him the way he done me did you see so and so they never even spoke to me so you love God in the realm of the Unseen but we base our love for one another totally on the realm of the seen the felt the touched sir whether or not you like it everybody you go to church with is flawed and that's why you're so welcome here cuz you're just like all the rest of us now I also have said last Sunday if you do find a perfect Church please don't go there because you'll mess it up and they won't want me as a pastor cuz I'm not perfect and I sure mess it up but isn't it amazing how that we give everything we give absolutely everything to an unseen being now would have bothered some of you if Jesus would have been black on would it bothered some of Y all Jesus would have been a Chinese come on now what if you're a racist it would yes sir oh Lord I oh dear God I could have never search Jesus if he been black I wouldn't care if it's pink or purple I'm not going by what I seen I love him because of who he is and what he done and what he done for me and you get the Holy Ghost all this race stuff will fly out the window oh my come on somebody then if you're a white man you can grab a hold of a black man or a black brother and you can hug his neck because you got the spirit of God inside of you come on somebody it don't make no difference if you're an Asian a Chinese a Japanese or whatever more you are we have the same love of God in our hearts for one another you see this kind of love can only be depart given to us imparted by the Holy Ghost therefore where love rules it looses us from under the law of condemnation and this is why the the word inside of us becomes the very law or nature that we're Guided by then we are become partakers According to second Peter chapter 1 ver4 we are become partakers of the divine nature so we can love as he loves we can forgive as he forgives oh praise the Lord now notice as as an app tree will bring forth oranges and a preach tree will bring forth pumpkins oh you made a mistake brother Donnie no I said that intentionally but that's the way some Christians are they're a peach tree they say and yet they bring forth pumpkin attitudes they come to church and they act like a big old fat pumpkin sitting on the chair they don't ever clap their hands they don't ever praise the Lord they don't ever worship god well it was too hot in there I understand I'm about to burn up right now myself but you think I'm going to stop preaching because it's hot you think I'm going to stop preaching because it ain't going good this might be my last opportunity to come to the house of God I'm going to give it everything I got oh praise the Lord I I don't know when it'll be my last time to come to the house of God brother Joel I'm going to worship I'm I'm going to sing I'm going to pray oh Hallelujah you feel the same way why because I want an attitude that matches my god I've not come to worship the thermostat I've not come looking for a perfect temperature I've come to be encouraged I've come to be healed I've come to be uplifted by the power of God so I refuse I refuse to let time and people control me [Applause] praise the Lord amen watch this you know as I go on in time I'm beginning to realize why a lot of folks have turned away from this message that we so love and why they just don't want it the bottom line is they can't live it this message brings the simple truths of the Bible in such an everyday way and scope of life that if you're not even a theologian you'd be able to understand it that is if you want to notice this let me tell you today my dear friends the greatest thing there is this side of heaven and he spells it l o v e Divine love the greatest thing this side of Heaven Again the Lamb's Book of life now the fruit of the holy spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness patience meekness that's the fruit of the spirit and that fruit that's the mark of the Holy Spirit showing that Divine love has anchored in the heart and the things of the world is dead so you see the thought of the more love you get the more you can do in the world is totally opposite of the truth fall in love with him and the things of the world will just fall off automatically why because your priorities change and you realize what what I Oh I thought I could never give this up I could never give that up but he gives you something so much greater than what Satan give you say my goodness this is absolutely nothing his word is so wonderful his presence is so awesome why in the world would I've always wanted to serve him notice again he said if you've still got malice and envy and strife you might run dance spoke in tongue shouted preach the gospel or anything but you're lost Lord have mercy until that blood has cleansed you and set in a Divine love of the Lord Jesus not for but of the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart in your life it speaks of Christ behind you well brother D I've got to pray more I've got to read more I've got to go to church more got to read my Bible so I I I'll be able to get this kind of love no he gives it to us then he molds us and he shapes us and he lets that love in it start growing and you love beyond your boundary you you actually start loving beyond your expectation you start loving beyond your comprehension of what love even is and then you start living in this land of love and dwelling in that and you saying I would have never thought I could have forgive that brother I would have never thought I could have forgiv that sister will you find what it is you're growing in the image of god notice oh my where there's trums they shall cease where there's prophecy it shall fail where there's knowledge it shall be vanished and when that which is perfect has come that which is part has done away you Christians always be willing to land a hand to do something to help somebody to make it more pleasant for them you said well I don't have any gift of healing you don't have to have at least offer something yeah offer a prayer do something make them feel do the best you can never turn a brother from India sent me this quote yesterday and I just shared it all over the world I thought it was so wonderful never turn a shoulder a cold shoulder right now maybe I need to walk off the platform and finish this this never turn a cold shoulder to anyone no matter what it is even if they've mistreated you do it anyhow now don't raise your hands but I wonder how many of us are pretty good at that cold shoulder thing but you know that's really sad because that's not a disciple sign so if Jesus would have said now I'm I'm your Rabbi now this is what I want you to do whenever people don't treat you good I want you to now that's the way people will know that you're following me see just get really good at to me it's so sad that we're really good at something that's so bad anybody besides me in here ever give anybody a cold shoulder yes sir 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 well you sisters that didn't raise your hand and your brothers y'all come up here and take my notes and go and finish this sermon then I'm not worthy to said among you wow but why would we give anyone a coold shoulder cuz it's in our nature I listen he said even if they mistreated you do it anyhow if you can't do it from your heart and you ought to come to the Altar and stay till that Spirit comes in you that from your heart you can love those who doesn't love you amen and everybody said Lord help me listen friend that's when God will answer your prayer for as long as there's anything in your heart if I conceive iniquity in my heart then God will not hear me that's what David said and that's true he won't hear you wow some brother dnie will I get it by fasting will I get it by reading my Bible Well will I get it by praying more it may be a combination of all those things if that's what God deals with you about but what you want to focus on is not getting more gifts and more emotion that comes with it but you want to focus on getting more of The Giver himself and the more of The Giver that we get inside of our Lives it's like he pushes his virtue and nature out of us and goes to touching people that you meet every day this is your badge of a true disciple someone told me the other day of someone that embraced the message and come to the message and they left a denomination and they been around for a bit and they started getting on social media and what they started finding was people of the message that was fussing and arguing and fighting and debating and just back and forth and back and forth and these people come to the pastor of the church or they'd went to and said we don't understand that's exactly the way they' done in the church we come out of we thought you all had love testing 1 two 3 testing one to oh my notice I probably goes on to say now what is the church is liking is divine love I don't mean affectionate love this is what the lean preachers specialize in when they're preaching love they're not preaching Divine love at all they're preaching affectionate love so just touching everybody and rubbing everybody oh God bless you God bless you and they think that's love so they welcome everybody to their church that they do anything and everything and they don't preach the truths how can you love anybody and you see them going down a river and the boat they're in is going over the falls and you say you love them and you stand there and wave at them as they go down that ain't love Real Love Is is corrective but affectionate love will hold back truths Divine love will always put truth first with wisdom yes so you see we don't want to just love with human affection people don't understand compassion they think compassion is human sympathy the Lord Jesus you believe he had compassion yet he walked among a crowd of people one day and the Bible says there was many laying there halted blind and the Lord Jesus walks to a man that is called impotent which had an Affliction for 38 years it wasn't going to kill him it had it all this time it wasn't near as major as many other people that were there but he walks straight to that man and brings healing to that man and walks straight out of that crowd of people and doesn't heal another individual our modern day theologians to look at that and saywell that ain't love that ain't love you know why they say that because they don't understand love love with compassion Godly compassion is doing the will of God yeah notice this he said I don't mean affectional love I mean agapo love The Godly love and have it so richly in your heart so you just love the Lord and everything you just take his word for it and you don't miss M trust him again he says we love thee with unchangeable love 25 years ago you placed that Divine Love in My Heart Lord Jesus notice now it grows sweeter praise the Lord it grows sweeter every day I'm so happy that we grow in the Lord amen till we become in the full statue the measure the statue of Christ you say I love the Lord but can you trust him with a doctor shakes his head can you trust him when everything else is gone you need an overflowing baptism of love and going be honest and raise your hand before God and say God I already believe that's what I need I need a baptism of Love isn't it amazing though Mo most why is it that so many would want a baptism of power a baptism of the anointing to lay hands on the sick I believe in that too children we've got so many sick among us I believe in that but if we can get our divine love right I'll guarantee you you mark it down if we get our love right in this church we will see more healings more miracles than we've ever seen in our life but it will not be on the basis of us seeking gifts first but it will be on the basis of us seeking the giver and being able to be a true disciple and people can say I don't understand what they believe I don't understand the way they dress but I'll tell you one thing I ain't never seen a people but such Godly love in my life let that be my badge as a disciple Let It Be My identification that when I get around people they can feel the love of God oozing out of me may they be able to censor something different I what you want as a Believer every child of God here today that ought to be the very thing we want more than than anything [Music] else oh my let me quose of this and handwriting on the wall if I had every gift in the Bible and could exchange it for love I'd never wink an eye I'd take it right now let me feel the blessings of the Lord Jesus his Divine love in my heart that's shed abroad by the Holy Ghost I'll exchange any gift in the Bible for that and the church said amen or you say I've spoken tongues that don't have nothing to do with that I've shouted that's still don't have nothing to do with it Paul said I could speak in tongues like men and angels and still be lost do we believe that friends am still be lost I could have faith to move mountains and still be lost and in it if the Divine love of God isn't in your heart to take everything of the world out notice the Divine love of God will take everything of the world out it don't allow you to keep everything the Divine love of God itself will drive it out Hallelujah that's right listen this if the Divine love of God isn't in your heart to take everything of the world out you're lost the devil's only deceiving you Paul said whether there's tongues they'll cease whether there's prophecies it'll fail whether there's all these signs the Antichrist can produce any sign that's it in the Bible but listen what you can do that the Antichrist can't but he cannot love so you say I lay hands on the sick and they recover the Antichrist can do the same thing I have Miracles the Antichrist can do the same thing but he can't love let's stand together he cannot love there's nothing about him to love agapo love is divine love and when the Divine love is in your heart there is a difference in your life and everybody knows it that's right you live like a Christian act like a Christian walk like a Christian and your whole system is timed to God's Bible oh hallelujah how many loves him with all your heart that what you want I quote this to you Wednesday night but let me read it to you this morning after this morning the holy spirit so beautifully coming down and bathing us listen to these terms bathing Us in his great Beauty bathing Us in his great Beauty oh oh my I was just inspired to speak them words and say that some glorious day all the gifts that's in the church will be set aside on the mantle as it was and the Holy Spirit himself will just take the church and such a control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see the lame will walk now what I find amazing is there's an element of Brothers in the message that will try to take some of these quotes and say Well when Divine love comes in We Ain't Got No more healing you need to read this one along with that one you're reading he don't do away with healing come on Divine Healing is a down payment of the Resurrection oh my the Holy Spirit himself don't you understand the difference a gift is him taking that gift and using it but what he wants is this that he himself does it cuz you know how we are if this certain preacher prays for us it's nearly impossible for us to keep from thinking very highly of that man right and then if we're not careful the next time we get sick we'll want that same man to pray for us again and again and again and again that's just the way we are as humans but can you imagine if the Holy Ghost can so get inside of our church not just ours but everyone that wants this will take such control of divine love until the sick will be healed the blind will see the lame will walk without being hands laid on them it'll just be be one great Unity praise God wouldn't that be something wouldn't that be awesome sort of reminds me of that 20 year or so Span in the early church when the Holy Ghost was so moving among them it was not no big great preachers and this great person and that great person it was the anointing of the lion himself the person of Jesus anointing and they were the extension of his body so what's this message come to do anyway just bring us a bunch of doctrines make us dress different just make us act a little different have strange ideas of what the people say is that all it's for it's to replicate that original church amen I've got one more can I have your permission to read it I was going to do it without it anyway but it's just nice when y'all smile and say I can oh if the Pentecostal Church would only satisfy thirsting God instead of trying to follow some evangelist or some emotion or some little ISM a little sensation how much better off that'd be you'd follow the holy spirit in Divine love instead of Sensations and little gifts and things like that how much better off you'd be God don't want you to run after gift he wants you thirst after him praise the Lord praise the Lord you see if you get him you get all the gifts your sisters meet a fine young man you go to datton him and he buys you chocolates and roses and carnations and daff deals and all kind they said oh don't never stop that please bring on the flowers sis get him and you'll keep getting flowers oh no brother Donna they stopped doing that I still open the car door for my wife after 50 years if you Brothers don't do it you need to fall in love with her again same with the Lord Jesus if we get him and he says Lord you going to stop the chocolate he said goodness no I've got more now that I want to give you you're going to stop the supernatural Lord You're going to stop the blessing we've been taught Lord if we get Divine love you're going to stop gifts he said whoever told you that lied to you I'm want to do more than I've ever done I want healing to be so great it'll be so phenomenal and so great the very next step will be you simply stepping into a new body hallelujah hallelujah you simply stepping into a new body not stop Divine Healing not stop the supernatural not stop Miracles amen amen it's bar it Hallelujah Lord Jesus I pray you'd forgive us preachers if we focus more on the gifts and we have the giver if we focus more on emotion and stirring the people somehow Lord I believe with many many men they want Revival so bad among their people and among the message folks we don't want to see them dead and dry spirit of God not moving Among Us help us to keep the balance Lord to realize if if it's not based upon your word and real Divine love it won't last someone asked Moody one time how long revivals last and do they last he said yes they do last the individual said well how come you have to keep on habit them he said did you take a bath before you come to church the man said yes he said well you have to take another one he said yes he said question answered so Lord revivals come and then they'll tend to wne a little bit and then they'll die and what for so we can have another one and another one and another one but if we can get Divine love and keep falling in love with you more every day of our life and falling in love with one another and even if the church is going through a little bit of a lull we're not ready to quit and walk away and backside and go back to the world because our love for you is just as great as it was when everybody was hanging from the chandeliers as we' say because our walk with you isn't just based upon a Revival coming and going it's based upon our love for you you your love for us and our love for one another I pray for this church today father I pray You' help me as the pastor help me that I can display Divine love help me that I can be the kind of preacher Lord God that no matter where I'm at that people can sense something different I don't care whether they think I'm a great preacher or not whether I'm a Theologian or not I ain't whether they think I'm this or that or the other if they can just sense you my life will not have been lived in vain but that don't just apply to the preacher it applies to each of us every man every woman every boy every girl would you pass by this way today Lord and give us a great baptism of Love Yes Lord to where we'll just fall in love with you more than ever before praise God I'm wondering how many here today would just raise your hand and just say it to him Lord that's what I want would you that's what you want in your heart today Lord that's what I want more love more consecration Hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus oh praise God thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus let's just close our eyes now for just a few minutes in his presence let his holy presence just move Among Us Now Hallelujah father in the name of Jesus Lord some of the Saints I look at them they've been serving you for decades but I'd say if they'd be honest that she'll like to have more and more Hallelujah
