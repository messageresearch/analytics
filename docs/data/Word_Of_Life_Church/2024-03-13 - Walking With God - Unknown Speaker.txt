our God certainly is tonight isn't he what a wonderful privilege it is to serve the Living God count it an honored to be with you and appreciate the opportunity to stand before you tonight and Trust something will be said to help you and encourage you along the way and battling just a wee bit of a cold and I just trust that my voice don't sound like I'm in a barrel too bad but we pray the Lord to just help us tonight but if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of 2 Corinthians want to read from 2 Corinthians chapter 5 sorry not working again well praise the Lord amen I'm telling you if I cross the river and somebody hands me a mic I did not make it it happens everywhere I go praise the Lord praise the Lord God is good all the time amen anyway we we're going to read second made myself laugh we're going to read tonight from 2 Corinthians chapter 5: 7 and also from 2 Corinthians chap 6 uh verse 16 do you love him yes amen the Bible says this very familiar scripture to us all says for we walk by faith and not by sight for we walk by faith and not by sight now you can walk by one or the other but you can't walk for both at the same time so you're either going to walk by what you see with your eye or you're going to walk by what you see with the eyes of your heart amen amen now 2 Corinthians 6:16 says this and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people amen oh myall what a wonderful statement that The God Who created the heavens and the Earth said that you would be his people amen that ought to make you shout tonight good amen do you love him you know in order to walk with God we have to agree with God for the Bible says can two walk together except they be agreed and the prophet of God said this and I thought it was so good he said when a man will walk for God and walk with God then God will walk with that man amen when a man will walk for God and walk with God God will walk with that man amen let us bow our heads Hallelujah Heavenly Father Thy word is true thank you Lord for loving us for it's written that while we were yet sinners you loved us Lord father I pray tonight that you would just take this simple thought and encourage the hearts of your people Lord for truly we're living in such a time of great Darkness but yet Lord you promised in this evening time that there shall be light God we are so grateful that we're a people that's been called out of the darkness to walk in this Marvelous Light bless your children tonight Lord those that are sick and Afflicted maybe those that are weary may you move among them Lord a great way we pray with thy Healing Touch tonight knowing Lord that you're both Creator and sustainer of Our Lives we commit every need into your hands For Your Glory bless your children tonight bless the little bride around the world we pray every Minister ministering tonight use them for thy Glory we ask as we commit oursel and this congregation into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name God bless you Saints you may be seated this evening you know inspiration for a message can come in so many ways sometimes someone can make a comment to you and it'll just something will just strike your heart and it'll inspire you to start looking in a certain direction or you can be going down the road and you see a just a a a a billboard on the side of the road and something on that billb billboard will strike your heart and you'll start looking at a certain thought you know like brother Brenham who was walking through the woods and uh he he's seen a cigarette pack and laying there in the woods and he stopped and looked at the at the cigarette pack and on the side of it was a was a slogan a slogan on the on the cigarette pack and the prophet got an inspiration from that cigarette pack and he preached a powerful sermon on a thinking man's filter and the other day Aiden my grandson was over at the house and after he left I was coming through the bedroom and I bumped into one of his toys that he had left out while he was there and we had it out for him to play with and as I bumped into it it spoke to me and it said let's walk together let's walk together and when it said that something just struck my heart so tonight for a few minutes I'd like to speak on let's walk together Walking with God in the season of transition for you see transition means a period of changing from one state or condition to another and I believe that we can prove tonight by the Bible and by the message of the hour and by the conditions of the world that we are now living in that we are in the season of transition now in our scripture reading we find that the sons and daughter Daughters of God they walk by faith and not by sight and the prophet said a man or a woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they will never please God so if you try to walk after the world and try to walk after the message you will never please God and a person that never pleases God will never take a Rapture amen I said if we never please God we will never take a Rapture for the Bible said that Enoch pleased God and he was not because God took him amen but a man woman that will not look at the things of the world but will go according to the leading of the spirit you will find those kind of people are usually in the will of God Amen and that's the great fight tonight and it's always been the fight that Satan took the eyes of a man's head to control him by his head but God never chose the eyes of your head he chose your heart God wants to lead men so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man could be led by the spirit of God Amen and if there's something in you tonight thirsting for more of God if there's something in you tonight thirsting for a deeper walk with God anybody here like that tonight say you know brother I really desire a deeper walk with God then there's something in you that thirst that's in you for a deeper Walk Of God is the evidence that there's a deeper Walk Of God for you to attain to because if it wasn't there then you would never have that thirst and I want you to know that the thirst that's in your heart for a deeper walk with god did not come from you it came from from God he put that thirst on Hallelujah he put that thirst in your heart oh do you love you tonight it was put there by God now one of the greatest examples in the Bible that we have of a man walking with God is Enoch is Enoch and the Bible says this that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him oh God let that be said about me one day let that be said about you one day that he walked with God and he was not because God took him by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen Faith we're talking about faith we've got to have faith we've got to have it in such a place till we'll be translated like Enoch was we of me you all of us tonight we must come to that kind of faith that we can be translated like Enoch was that's right he had a testimony of faith that he pleased God for without faith it's impossible to please God so you you've got to have the same kind of faith that you believe and that you know but you see this faith is that this knowing is not a head knowledge you don't know it well I've read a few good you don't know it by head knowledge but it's a revelation that God has given to you God has revealed this thing to you amen and that's how we know we can have faith in it not because of a head knowledge but because of a revelation what is faith faith is a revelation of the will of God for your life amen and so when the Revelation comes we can have faith that God revealed this thing to us because we are a part of what God is doing in this hour amen Jesus himself said I do always that which pleases the father that's keep his word for to please God we must believe his word and keep his word and so is it today every son and daughter of God in order to please God must keep God's word not the part you want to keep but all of it all of it God is not known by sensation come on somebody well I got a goosebump you can get that from an air conditioning God is not known by sensation he is not known by education amen well I can read the Bible well I know the Bible from cover to cover that's just being able to read amen God's not known by education God's not known by sensation but God is known by faith amen faith in his word that's the only way he's recognized faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God that's how it comes by the hearing of the word of God Enoch walked with God it was a walk by faith so Enoch must have heard something from God while he was walking there was something that God was revealing to Enoch while he was walking for Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen now we know that Enoch believed God you say how do you know he believed that because he acted on what he believed he walked with God that was the evidence that he believed God we know that Noah believ God you say how do you know Noah beli God because he built the ark before one drop of rain ever fell amen you see when you believe anything when you say you believe anything you've got to put it into action or do you believe oh I believe brother Daryl so does the devil but you got to put it into action amen hallelujah Abraham was commanded to separate himself from unbelief and walk with God Alone instead of getting weaker he got stronger and when he was 100 year old and Sarah was 99 they had the baby amen because Abraham believed God and he walked with God believing that he would have that child out because God said so he never looked at his body he never looked at it come on somebody he wasn't looking with the eyes of his head he was believing with the eyes of his heart and because he didn't look at his body he looked to the promise he never got weaker he got stronger stronger amen he knew he would have the child because God said he would have the child and he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise became flesh he walked with God to the manifestation of the promise was made flesh amen I thought that was pretty good you get me amens but oh my to the promise of the word became flesh whose flesh My Flesh your flesh the message of the hour not just in book form not just in tape form not just in CD form not just computer uh computer format but the message of the hour made flesh in you and I that we are the [Applause] message Hallelujah manifested on the earth making him the same yesterday today and forever so let's look at Enoch for a few minutes and look at his walk and see this walk that was so pleasing to God that God translated him now I don't know about you and I but that's the kind of walk that I want tonight that my walk would be so pleasing to him that he would say Daryl just come on home with me buddy amen so when we look at Enoch's walk we start to see some things that are laying in the message that the prophet said about Enoch and one of the things the prophet said about Enoch was that Enoch was a type he was a type Enoch knew that he was a type and he knew that before the flood came that he had to give an example now where did that Revelation come from amen how did he know that he was the type that everything his life was doing was an antitype of a type that's right where did that Revelation come from so one afternoon it'd be coming to him to take a walk notice not one morning not one morning he didn't take a walk one morning but it was an evening walk amen Enoch was translated just before the tribulation let me say that again Enoch was raptured just before the tribulation and he was took up and he was not found because God took him the type of the going forth of the church the type of the going forth of the church Enoch was translated from Death By God's transforming power and transforming means the ability to bring about a dram dramatic change amen we serve a god tonight who has the ability to bring about a dramatic change hallelujah oh I'm so glad tonight someone on the other day that God don't heal no more these Church of Christ people believe God don't heal no more I'm sorry if you're God suity he can't heal I feel sorry for you but my God my God still heals he still open blinded eyes he still makes the come on somebody we serve a god tonight who has the ability to raise the dead and to change our bodies brother Jackie back to young men again Hallelujah by the transforming power of the almighty God hallelujah you know was translated by transforming power why did God do that what did God do that for why did God change his body that he wouldn't have to see death yeah the prophet said for a type of the rapturing church that's coming for the rapturing church that's coming God done it for a type of the rapturing church that's coming well Glory Elijah was the same Jesus body the prophet said was quickened after it was dead in the grave Jesus body was quickened by the word of God and transform him from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God because the prophet said in Psalms 16:10 if you want to put it down I will not suffer his sold in hell I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption I'll not leave his sold in hell I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption that word has to come to pass why God spoke it God's word planted in your heart the prophet said if you want to go in a Rapture anybody here want to go in a Rapture oh yeah if you want to go into Rapture plant the word in your heart if you want to be a Christian genuine place this word in your heart and believe it as it was Ezekiel said take the scroll and eat it up and the prophet and the word became the self-same the prophet and the word became the selfs same did not John the Baptist John on the alatus was not he the type of the bride and what did he do he took the book out of the hand of he that descended and what did he do with the book he ate the book and John was a type of the bride and the book became one yes sir you take and eat the revealed word of this hour and you and that word becomes [Applause] one every promise has to manifest in your flesh it's not just for the preachers to lay hands on the sick these signs shall follow them that believe every promise must manifest in our flesh hallelujah hallelujah would you let some educated Theologian try to pump it out of you just let him spray you with some of this carnal science and knowledge and education you believe what God said well brother D I don't really understand it you don't have to understand it just believe it he'll reveal it to you when you have need of it amen I'd rather be found believing it than debating it because debating it will never produce nothing but believ in it Hallelujah believe in it will open blinded eyes believe in it will make the L walk believe in it we'll take a drunk and make a preacher out of them by believe in what the word said it'll change our bodies [Applause] amen hallelujah Enoch was the type of the church he also typed the seventh Church age what age are you in what what seventh seventh anoch typed the seventh Church age Enoch walked as a reflector Enoch the prophet said was God's perfect reflector and type when God was through with him he just translated him he took him up the mechanics that he had reflected become the Dynamics with the spirit and took him up the mechanics of the word that he reflected became the Dynamics with the Holy Spirit and it just took him the word that Enoch believed Walking with God the mechanics of the word one God water baptism reing the Holy Ghost forgiveness of sins as though you never done to justification all these Mysteries lay in there the mechanics of the word became Dynamics he reflected that word I was listening to a man the other day talking about leaving the message they said he'd come out of the brandom cult and they let him speak a little bit and this man said I believe in one God I believe in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ I believe in signs and wonders and visions and miracles and healings I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in one God I believe in the Rapture of the church and I'm thinking where did the prophet miss it you walked away from something that you said you you believed think about that friends think about that everything he said he believed was what the prophet preached oh God he was a reflector the mechanics that he reflected became the Dynamics with the spirit that took him up and we are flesh and bone of him amen amen listen to me there's sometime in your life you're going to have to start amening what the prophet said there sometime in your life you've got to start acknowledging what the prophet said well I don't understand it he didn't say did you understand it he said did you believe it and there comes a time that we have to start confessing come on friends we all the time feeding our enemy well I'm no good God don't love me you know what shamgar did every year every year at Harvest Time When they'd come in they'd slap him around and they'd take his his grain away from him take his Goods away from him and leave him with just enough to plant for the next season you know what chevard was doing he was feeding his enemy and I am convinced that many of us feed our enemy with our negative talk well I'm no good God don't love me nobody cares for me it'd be better if I just die you're feeding your enemy why don't you shut that stuff up and start saying what the word said I am an overcomer I am a Son of God I come on somebody I'm predestinated I was born for the rapture and every year they come in but one time this particular season there was another seed that came to maturity Shamar said I am the Seed of Abraham and God promised my daddy his seed shall possess the gates of his enemy that year he killed 600 Philistines with a nox goat because he came to his position he started saying what the word said about him amen we are flesh and bone of him oh that's much better thank you we are you see we're not a church we're not a building we're a body when the when the when the cloud appeared in Arizona what was it was it a block was it a steeple it was a head what do heads go to bodies we are flesh and B we are his body represented on the earth amen a many membered body that's why he said the works I do shall you do and greater that greater means more because what he did was one body but now it's a universal body signs of Wonders being done everywhere because his body is on the earth flesh and Bone amen as long as we are the bride of Christ amen it's his word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in that's what it was that's what it was with Moses that's what it was with Jacob that's what it was with the rest of them sparking off that word of God the reflector God was reflecting himself and come to the perfect image of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him so I say to you tonight what are you reflecting an organization a denomination or are we reflecting him once more the world will hear from God it'll be through his bride for the final voice to the final age amen Voice Hallelujah God reflected himself come to a perfect Masterpiece was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflecting him Enoch was reflecting the word that God was revealing to him as he walked with him God said Enoch let's walk together now didn't that happen sometime in our age when brother bam spoke to a storm and Reb buuk the storm and the sun came up and dried up the snow and God spoke to him and said how would you like to walk with me he said oh God I would love nothing more to take a stroke with my Creator you he's given every one of us in this hour an invitation this message of the hour is his invitation walk with me let's walk walk together amen Enoch walked in the light in the light amen oh my someday the church which is a type of Enoch 500 years he walked before God walking walking in the light with the testimony that everything God said he did he didn't displease him for what the Lord said to do Enoch done it Enoch just kept walking in the light till one day his feet kept getting off the ground he just kept walking He Walked on into Glory without even dying that's right God took him away because God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony that he walked in the light of God he just kept walking he just kept walking oh friends never put a period behind what you believe always put a comma I believe this and this and this and whatever else God in his grace would revealed to me walking the prophet said Brothers It's time we make Footprints we can't stay here in this same camp the fire is moving on let's move on from glory to glory from Bible experience to Bible experience walking in the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold it's like that Roman Candle you light it in the fuse if you walk away you never see the end of it when that first one comes out that's the beginning of the end but you've got to stay there until all of them it just keeps poof poof poof poof continues has the seals been open yes but it continues to unfold what do you see in the seals is it just a sermon is it just a series of meetings or do you see yourself there's a man I believe I think I've told you this before but it just comes to my heart there's a man by the name of bur from New Jersey raised in the Jewish Family wore the cap did all the things that the all the ceremonies he's an award-winning Native American flute player now why would a Jew from New Jersey be an award-winning Native American flute player that don't make no sense think he'd play a harp or something you know some kind of horn why a flute why brother Fred would a New Jersey Jew been an award-winning Sue flute player playing Sue music because one day somebody come to his door with an open book and they told him you're not a Jew you're a sue Indian adopted adopted as a child from the rosebud Indian reservation and when he found out who he was when he found out his genetics you see the ability the play of the flute laid within his genetics and when he realized who he was he surrendered to what he was and he went back to the red path and the sacred way and the elders why that's what he was and one day they told me I was a drunk because my papa was cuz my uncle was cuz Uncle Harold was CU a Francis was they told me I was a drunk but one day somebody came with an open book and said that's not who you are that's not who you are you're my son while you was yet in your mother's W I called you I set you aside for such a time as this the open book revealed to us who we really are walking into the light amen the light of the revealed word as it continues to unfold from glory to glory to glory Enoch walked has an eagle all these were the things the prophet said I just dug through the message all these are things brother brim said about Enoch Enoch walked as an eagle he walked with God whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day that's pretty good he was an eagle who had been called to that day you know the Bible talks about four living creatures is that right a man an ox a lion and a flying eagle now those four living creatures three of them are Earthbound creatures the only way that they could ever cross a Chasm is either build a bridge take a boat an airplane but not the eagle the eagle was born with the ability to lift off the Earth and God never said Enoch was a lion or an ox or the face of a man he said he was an eagle who had been called to this day oh glory to God hallelujah that just stirs my soul to know that I was born oh the devil tried to put me in a the cage he tried to lock me up but Christ come and opened the door and said you're an eagle you can fly Enoch walked with God whatever God said to do he never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle who had been called to that day to that day you B talked about an eagle that he saw in a blowdown remember the story was out there and said he's just praising God and said he knows said he was looking at him he said at first I thought it was me but he said I noticed it wasn't me he was looking at it was an old ground squirrel chipmunk or something said ch ch ch ch chatter chatter chatter chatter said I a't going just his head look at him said after a while he just got tired of the chatter all the political correct transgender he got tired of all the chatter got tired of all the stupidity come on somebody what was it Forest Gump one time said it's stupid is the stupid does that's about where it's at right now some of the stupidest things they do well amen well you ain't supposed to get political I'm just telling the truth I'm sorry come on somebody amen he said he got tired of all the chatter said he just gave a flop just one big jump and he just flopped his wings one time and S them said he trusted his wings he didn't fought from one meat to to the other from one Church to another he just made one big flop and set his wings in the power of God like the Holy Ghost and he carried him away on and on and on and on he got away from that little old chipmunk that Earthbound chipmunk that ain't got no wings that don't know how to fly that don't know anything about the supernatural that don't know anything about God but all they know to do is run their mouth he got tired of it and he realize I am an eagle I don't have to listen to that I can set my wings I Can Fly [Applause] just set your wings in the power of God let the Holy Ghost rise you above it go on and on and on do you don't hear the Chipmunks No More the ground squirrels he got tired of the chatter oh if the church one of these days will get tired of that they'll know how to set their wings they'll take a walk with God and they'll go home they'll go home one they they'll just set their wings they'll get tired of it and they'll just set their wings they'll go home you see the most wonderful thing about Enoch's walk cuz I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I was hoping some of you would get it I'm not talking about Enoch tonight I'm talking about you I'm talking about you Enoch's walk was typing you God was showing through Enoch what he was going to do through you he was a reflector he was the light of his age reflecting the mechanics of the word the evening light is not the name of the church I'm sorry it's you Jesus said I'm the light of the world and then he turned and said you're the light of the world did he suffer from Amnesia did he forget what he said no he was giving you a revelation I'm the light of the world but you are the light of the world because I'll be in you reflecting myself through you and you shall be my people and I shall be your God and I'll walk in you Hallelujah I'll reflect myself through you that the world in 2024 will know that Jesus Christ lived lives he lives in young people he lives in Grandma he lives in Grandpa he lives in that come on somebody he lives in me he lives in you if that's true let's just look at it for a minute that let look at Enoch's walk in the season of his transition now the prophet said God is just loosening up the church everywhere getting it in order now so they can get into the Rapture he's got to give it Rapture in faith before it can go in the Rapture he's just loosing up the church everywhere getting it in order so they can get into the Rapture so that he can get into the Rapture he's got to give it rapturing Faith before it can go in the Rapture the people that are in the spirit of the last days just like they were in the days of Noah eating and drinking marrying in marriage unconcerned don't care walk around anything else as it was in the days of Noah and if you understand it right the prophet of God said that Enoch and Noah was preaching at the same time so the days of Noah when the world was in that condition it was in that season that Enoch translated it was in that season of drinking and marriage and giving in marriage and unconcerned and self-love take the place of the true love of God and earthquakes in diverse places rest unrest between nations wars and rumors of wars pestilence famines it was Enoch's day it was in his season of transition it was in that time it was in that time that uniting times and signs took place sound familiar it was during that time the prophet says you see that time that Nimrod had brought all the confederations together and made people come to Babylon and come into this great Confederation and at that time of all the evil going on between the women sexually and so forth it's at that same time that God had a witness on the earth Enoch who walked with God blameless it was during that time that this evil was on the earth when God said I'll destroy man for his heart is continually evil it was during that time that there was someone on the earth who was found blameless as though they never done [Music] it Hallelujah more than what Luther preached come on somebody a greater understanding of the word walking in the light as he reveals the light Hallelujah was in the season of transition that they were uniting herself amen he was found blameless he was found blameless and that that same time evil was appearing Angels appeared on the earth Angelic beings moved into men a very beautiful type of today as evil is appearing so is good appearing also notice back there in that evil day just before the destruction when God had a man out preaching the gospel a poor man a humble man not very much of the world but a man who had a heart to listen to God a man who had a heart to listen to God how can two walk together except they agree and there's only one thing that you and God can agree on and that's his word amen and you see we know that as it was in the days of Enoch so will it be in our day you say how do you know that because when Jesus was here he spoke more of his second coming than he did his first coming and he even gave us an understanding of what was to take place he actually prophesied of what was to take place in this day that we're living in now you'll find it in Luke 21 and they asked him saying Master when shall these things be and what shall be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass when will these things happen and what will be the sign that it's happening and he said take heed that you be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draw near go ye not therefore after them but when you shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is Not By and By then he said unto them Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and great earthquakes shall be in diverse places many places and famines and pestilence and fearful SES yeah ain't it something that all of a sudden our government is so interested in UFOs and brother Bon said they don't know what they are they don't know what they are but he told us what they were he said they were investigating angels amen oh god oh Hallelujah fearful signs Great Signs there shall be from heaven and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth the stress of nations with perplexity and the Sea waves roaring men's Hearts failing for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud not clouds cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass give up quit coming to church go to Dollywood every other weekend when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your hands for your Redemption draweth n and he spake unto them a parable saying behold the Fig Tree and all trees and all trees not just the Fig Tree and all trees when they shoot forth you see you know of yourself that summer is now at hand so likewise when you see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand and verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away to it be fulfilled heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away it shall not pass away I don't know if you noticed or not have you seen all the buds coming out on the trees the Bradford peirs are all turning white what's that telling us it's a law of God's nature that's telling us summer is on its way huh you see when the leaves come out the leaves don't come out in the winter time no first the buds come out and they start budding forth and it tells us spring is on its way spring is here it's sprung we say and then what does that tell us when the leaves begin it tells us that summer is n amen so you can tell what season you're in by looking and at the trees budding in the spring leaves are on the trees in the Summer Leaves begin to change color and fall in the fall and when there's no leaves on the tree it's winter but as brother Lind wrote that song there'll be another spring amen learn the parable the Fig Tree when it's young it put forth its branches and all the other trees you know summer is n likewise when you see this come to pass know the time is now even at the door when you see what the Fig Tree buding and all the other trees begin to Bud no the time is near speaking of the second coming of Christ that that time would be at hand that time would be at hand at the budding of the trees at the budding of the trees nations are breaking the fig trees putting forth his Bud all of the trees are putting forth its Bud the wicked ones are putting forth their buds romanism is putting forth its Bud communism putting forth it but and your church is putting forth its but springtime's coming oh great master of Life rise with healing in your wings Lord give your servants all power and signs to stretch forth the hand of th holy Child Jesus to perform Miracles and do signs and to preach the gospel to the ends of the world when all the trees begin to bud when everything begins to come into its own amen amen they manifesting who they really are and so are we the trees are budded amen Jesus seeking said father the time has come there are seasons for everything do you believe that you sew in a certain season and you reap in a certain season and there are seasons when the time comes that's right for things to happen yeah season is right for things to happen you see it couldn't happen in' 65 we wern't ready but when that last one comes in remember say she may be in Florida tonight when that last one comes in he'll close the book and call for his bride thank you amen so when the season is right he'll come with the season when the times comes it's right for things to happen he said do you believe that the time came one time for God to destroy the world with water and he sent a man by the name of Noah and God got the world ready for judgment the time came for Noah to go in the ark look Noah could not go into the ark before God was ready for him to go but when the season came for go for Noah to go into the ark God shot shut the door behind Noah he couldn't go in until the season was right but when the season was right he could go and he never shut the door God did God did so Prophet said you see we find that Enoch was a seventh from Adam and the seventh Church age is a seventh from the alpha BR the first church age Enoch was the Sabbath from Adam which is a type of the church ages now all the rest of the six men before him died but Enoch was translated Enoch was raptured the seventh so it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture now there's no doubt we're in the seventh Church age we all know it it's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture all other six died but Enoch was translated because he was not found God took him but Enoch raptured was the type of all the rest of them dying but at the end time bride will be called out the rapturing without death will be called out of the seventh Church age and we are now bearing record of that age we are now bearing record of that age as it was in the days of Enoch so is it in the days of the Bride right we are now bearing record of that age as Enoch was a seven from Adam took a Rapture he did not die so the seventh Church age will take a Rapture there'll be people on the Earth by the transforming power of of God will become about a dramatic change and in a moment and the twinkling of an eye will'll be young again hallu Hall the season of transition the season of transition stand up there where Enoch did my he took a stroll one afternoon with God and walked on home with him don't just to come back Hallelujah not one morning one evening the Rapture of the Resurrection he had a testimony that he pleased God because he believe God and that's what we need and that's what we want and that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but it's time we get away from this fear and from this scar BR B said I didn't come out I didn't come to mix up a Doctrine I come to straighten one out to get away from this fear and from the scare that you don't know who you are he said you're not going to be you are now Sons and Daughters of God you always were Sons and Daughters of God it's time we get away from this fear and from this skar and start saying what he said about us come on somebody there's nothing wrong with saying what the word said as a matter of fact everything else is true he said let every man's lie let every man's word be a lie but let mine be true amen let every man's word be alive but let my word be true heavens and earth will pass away but my word word shall not pass away that's what we need that's what we want that's what we have you're just afraid to use it but I say do not be afraid to exercise your god-given rights after all this is the age of people's rights I did who you going to preach with me I don't one a predestinated word for the season a predestin ated word for the season that God would hold a word back for a certain season before he would let it be released that's why Paul never mentioned the seals it wasn't the season but in a predestinated time God would give a predestinated word to a predestinated people that they would take that word and eat that word and become that word and manifest that word and the word would be Flesh on the earth once again which would be Jesus Christ Hallelujah in his bride fulfilling the promise of the last day when he said a little while the world will see me no more but you shall see me for I'll be with you even in you Enoch was translated 500 years he had a testimony that he pleased God and he was a type of the raptured church amen Enoch after walking 500 years with God God told him Enoch you're not going to have to die he walked walk with God and one day God revealed to Enoch you don't have to die I bet if he told you that you wouldn't be sitting there but he did if you believe it I wish he told me that he already has if you believe it amen he told Enoch after walking 500 years he said Enoch you're not going to have to die you're not going to have to die there come a more sure word of Prophecy a predestinated word for a predestinated season and Enoch believed everything God told him Enoch said I don't have to die I can go where he goes I don't have to die I don't have to die who told you that he did he said Enoch he said Enoch you want to come home are you homick Enoch and Enoch said yes Lord I'm homesick so just before the translation of Enoch he got homesick and I'm telling you friends I've been preaching for 30 some years evangelizing 30 some years I have never seen in all the years of being on the field as many people saying they're homesick and they want to go home and even so Lord come quickly as I have in the last two years I'm just telling you friends everywhere you go people even so Lord come quickly they're posting it on Facebook they're posting it on come on somebody you know it's the truth and God said Enoch are you homesick and Enoch said yes Lord I'm so homesick I don't fit in here anymore I don't belong here no more amen I want to go home he said yes Lord I'm homesick in a season of transition Enoch became homesick he said you walked in this pest I've done here long enough he said yes sir he said all right Enoch just start walking and the prophet said Enoch needed a ladder but God gave him a highway it's a highway Heaven none can go up there but the F in heart hallelujah amen notice God Reveals His word in his own predestinated season hry now how could Martin Luther know about the message today how could the Presbyterians how could Martin or the Catholic Church know Martin Luther's message how could John Wesley know Luther's message how could Wesley know the Pentecostal message or how could the Pentecostals know this message see he reveals it in his Seasons because it's a seed and it grows and matures and he reveals himself Enoch was a type of the church he was a type of the seven Church age can you think of that the seven Church ages there was seven watches and all six watches they slept but in the seventh watch there came a morer word of Prophecy and it said behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and they awoke and trimed their limbs in the seventh watch and Enoch was a type of the seventh watch amen it's the seventh watch that gets the revelation behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him Putin's threaten of nuclear war I saw it today in the news said he's not afraid of nuclear war but I got news for Putin he can't push the button until the last one comes in and if he does push the button said one day they'll drink too much vodka Russia push too much vodka when that bomb passes through the radar when it goes through there there'll be others go the other way and you'll know what'll take place the world can't stand it the gospel's been preached Christ been made manifest to the people just before the Rapture the taken away of the church before that can happen before that can happen the church will be gone I ain't worried about Putin pushing if he pushes we'll be gone before it ever hits he said we know that that could happen before morning it could happen before morning and if it could happen before morning and its capabilities are there the things are there that it could happen before morning but if it does this will be the last message you ever hear the trans position oh God's people hallelujah before that happens the church will be gone not one drop of rain fell Noah was in the ark before one Speck of fire fell from the heavens lot was out of Sodom and before that pic bomb the Nations the church will be gone to Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah do you love you we're walking in the season of Transitions and I say to you as we close tonight is there an Enoch in in the house is there an OK in the building tonight amen then I say edok let's stand to our feet tonight and say we will not walk by sight but we will walk by faith come brother Harry come musicians let me close tonight we will walk tonight by an unconscious Faith standing on what the word says you are you see faith is unconscious B said I'm going to say something faith is unconscious faith is unconscious you got faith and you don't even know if that's right Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm the gals knocking the boat from one side to the other he was standing in the face of a mess of demons he was hanging anywhere it never moved him he walked right along just as calm and quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear anything around him that's right whether it's going to happen or whether it wasn't going to happen he knew it was going to happen because God said so he didn't say oh I wonder if I prayed through I wonder if I fasted long enough I wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconscious that's right he believed what God Said was truth and the word must be fulfilled and he know that his life was here to fulfill it and that's you you're here to fulfill you're here to fulfill the word that's spoken for this hour God never placed us here to fail he placed us here to fulfill the predestinated word for a predestinated season for a predestinated people and we will walk unconscious a fear from the world come on somebody a fear from communism from fear from the Democrats or the Republicans a fear of missing the Rapture a fear of not being no good because the word's done said who we are he's done revealed to us who we are as we walk in Christ we walk in him not paying attention to the left or to the right just keep on moving just keep on walking walking in the light as he reveals the light from glory to glory to glory if we spent more time praising him than we did worrying we would be so much better off amen hallelujah hallelujah and I say to you that little bride if you're sick walk with God if the doctor says you can't get well walk with God if the doctor says you're going to die don't listen to that just walk with God just keep walking with God hallelujah if you got depression walk with God if your neighbors don't like you walk with God if they laugh at you at Walmart just keep walking with God just keep walking get your eyes on him Hallelujah keep your eyes on him he will change our bodies one day just like Enoch he walked with God till he walked all the way home Hallelujah you can't get well walk with God for God has promised us God has promised us I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you you said brother I feel so alone I don't have a friend in the world that's simply not true you got a great friend he said I'll never leave you I forsake you I'll be with you I'll be with you even to the end of the world oh little bride let's walk together as we walk with him you see it's an individual walk but we walk together individually as a body you see it's Christ in me helping you and it's Christ in you helping me that's the way God orchestrated it to me that I may not have faith for my family but I can have faith for yours and you may not have faith for your family but I can have it for yours and it's you helping me and me helping you and that's the body on the earth operating making him the same yesterday today and forever like the eagle in the blowdown he knew he knew he could lift above the chatter it was an unconscious Faith he knew he could do it because his genetics said he could do it you know somebody told me the other day you look more like your daddy every day and somebody said as long as you're living your mom will never be dead some people say I look like my daddy most people say I look like my mama everybody says Aiden looks like me but you know when I did my DNA I found out you get 50% of your DNA comes from your daddy and 50% of your DNA comes from your mama that's why some people see your mama other people they see your daddy in you and that's the natural DNA you know that's like why I could have so much well like like I'm I'm 5% Italian like so much seven 8% Southwest Asia 4 and a half% Native American got all this and then my brother he would have maybe something else I'll be 40% Irish and he might be 40% English but we're brothers because he got more of bomas it lean more to her than you know how and then when I got to looking at I thought the natural types of spiritual so 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from God my father and then I found a quote where brother B said we drink from the breast of Eli and we're birthed by the Breath of God so he said you see God is your mama so I get 50% of my spiritual DNA comes from my daddy and 50% of it come from a mama then what does that make us his seed do you love do you love what an agreement that the temple of God have with Idols you are the Temple of the Living God as God said I will dwell in them and I will walk in them he doesn't want just to walk above us or with us he wants to walk in us that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me God in his people manifesting himself God walking in his people in the season of transition are you glad to be a part of that tonight amen how many here so brother Dar you know I I want that more than anything a deeper Walk Of God I want to know him more than I've ever known him before friends I'm trying to tell you tonight that thirst in your heart for more of God was not put there by you it was put there by him and the evidence that we desire that tonight we know that we can obtain it because that desire is there if you didn't want that if there was no way to obtain that the desire wouldn't be there but the very fact that each of us stand there tonight and say these things these quotes look 99% of this message is quote you know that but the things the prophet said to us we should take these we should eat this and become a part of this amen and to know him and the power of his resurrection to hear him say how would you like to walk with me is God more than anything Lord more than anything is that your Des it's just about listen just lay your hands on one another tonight will you just reach over you can brother to brother sister sister family however it would be tonight am you're not heavy you're my brother you're my sister amen Heavenly Father we come before you tonight God I don't to

living in Dear God that we are the people on the Earth people in this building tonight that will not see death but there'll be change in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and father God As We Lay
