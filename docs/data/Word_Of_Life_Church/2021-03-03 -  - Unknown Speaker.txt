TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when two german universities joined forces to investigate social networking researchers discovered that discover that one in three people surveyed felt worse lonely frustrated or angry after spending time smoking drinking committing adultery sitting at the bar on facebook here we go you all told me to go on often due to perceived inadequacies when comparing themselves to friends research also shows that facebook can cause depression lord have mercy children i've got enough in this world to cause it why would i want to add more to it a recently published american academy pediatrics paper made a major splash that's what i'm fixing to make this morning a major splash when it described facebook depression a condition said to result when tweens and teens spend too much time on social media leading them to turn to substance abuse unsafe sexual practices and aggressive or self-destructive behaviors by spending too much time on facebook this blessed holy righteous holy grail of facebook [Music] i hope the man who made it can be saved poor guy well i can tell right now which ones has got it all y'all dried up on your amens look friends i didn't start preaching yesterday every one of you have body language some of you will amen what's going to your wife or your brother or your neighbor when it comes to you you enter into that serious mode of thinking don't you think i don't know you're guilty as a hound dog in a hen house just go ahead and admit the truth even if you're guilty notice that the more time adolescent girls spent on the social networking side the more likely they were to develop eating disorders such as anorexia bulimia extreme dieting israeli researchers recently found by being on facebook why because the mind they look at the pictures of these girls and this and that and the other said well i'm fatter than her i'm more chubby than her i don't look like that i'm this and that in the other and you say that don't bother me don't tell me it don't bother you you are a human being our bodies are not yet glorified our bodies are affected by such stuff [Applause] [Music] [Applause] why is it friends that we have such a stigma in our society about people that can have mental illness people going to have colon problems people going to have stomach problems they can have all kinds of other problems most people ain't gonna make fun of them but if anybody has a mental sort of a situation we ridicule them we make fun of them we laugh at them and many times people are suffering i'm not saying that they're insane now they just have some sort of mental oppression or something mental going on they hide it from their mother they hide it from the church they hide it from their very best friends why because people have such a stigma about it and we tend to laugh on them shame on us i said shame on us dear jesus tomorrow when y'all get off from work i'll be standing on the side of the interstate out there we'll preach for food and carol be kicked out of our houses oh my notice this exposure to online fashion and music content as well as watching tv shows like gossip girl were also associated with an increased risk for eating disorders facebook was referenced in 20 of divorce specif uh petitions processed in 29. now can you imagine how far along it is beyond this time of this statistic 20 of divorce petitions processed in 2009 by divorce online a british law firm time magazine reported that feuding spouses use their facebook pages to air dirty laundry let me just say it ain't people in divorce that do that it's church people church people getting on facebook and airing church problems family what in the world is wrong with people [Applause] i perceive all you a mentors don't have facebook and all you bug-eyed ones do you're trying to give me that fake smile come on i can see right through you you tell me not to have it no i'm not telling you not to have it but i'm telling you these are the risks that can be with it can it be used it can be just like the internet there's hardly anything in this generation that is a more damnable tool than the internet but it depends upon those of you who use it you and your smartphone it's a shame that sometimes a smartphone's smarter than the person who packs it amen but you can use a smartphone in an internet to contact me but do all kinds of things but who's going to be the one to control it that king sitting inside the throne of your heart he'll keep you off them bad websites he'll keep you off things you shouldn't be there why because we are living in the age of the mind but it's not just the mind of laodicea it is the mind of christ jesus notice this time magazine reported that feuding spouses use their facebook pages to air dirty laundry while their lawyers use posts as evidence in divorce proceedings oh but it's all fun and games facebook is wake up this morning sexual health expert ian kerner phd recently blogged on cnn that he's seen many relationships destroyed by facebook bombs so i figure the best way to avoid a facebook bomb is give you a word bomb people reconnecting with high school sweethearts or other blasts from the past [Laughter] that can lead to emotional if not actual cheating well you say i'm not doing anything if you're not careful you will develop an emotional relationship with somebody by texting or phone calling or facebook don't you sat down look at me big-eyed it is satisfying you it is gratifying you emotionally you are getting something out of it lord children you better run from it don't let the world shape our mind oh hallelujah let's be ready to leave this world and all this layer to sea of garbage sweet jesus recent research has shown that using social networking sites namely facebook can increase people's stress levels oh my produce anxiety and negativity affect a person's sense of self i already have enough of that to deal with [Applause] look at it friend it's a snare that's a tribe for those who are addicted to this they are looking for comfort they're looking for something and satan is saying come on come on and he pulls them right into it and the very place they're looking for help and soulless is the very thing that's going to destroy them there's one place you can find the hell and the comfort and the peace that you need in this age that's jesus christ using these sites might even cause a person to develop a mental health disorder really is this all worth it whoa some of y'all can't stand but church church one time a week because you get beat to death and you do this trash right here you do this nonsense you do this nonsense every day of your life these are not preachers saying this this ain't deacons this is phd and psychologists all these people telling you the negative effect and you will deal with the positive negative things in it in order to gratify something and stay away from the house of god when you can be corrected by the word social media media even has the power to quickly spread moods around the world well glory and so does the internet but in a positive way this same mood right here at happy valley has been spread around the world too right now of course it's spreading two different kinds of moods some of y'all's making you in a good mood some in a bad mood and some of you ain't decided what mood you're into someone i could spread three kinds of moods around the world this morning oh my researchers found that when the participants increased their facebook use their state of well-being and yet you're scared to death if you pick up a bottle and read on the side may cause cancer your brother stop to get gas and you reach and grab a hold of the handle and flip up the pump and select 87 or whichever one you're getting and you read that little warning sign may cause cancer you stand up we're scared to death of cancer and putting stuff in us every day that's million times worse [Applause] well i guess i'll be the subject of saving them on facebook won't i [Applause] well glory can you imagine researchers found that when the participants increased their facebook use their state of well-being declined while those who increased the amount of time they spent with people face to face had an increase sense of well-being oh my praise be to god notice now the next part of this it's addictive like anything that can distract us from stress anxiety and emotional pain facebook can be hard to stop using even as ironically it can be then cause more stress can't you see can't you say who's the father of this can't you see who's the founder of all this [Applause] pulls people in to get them off of the worries and the baby bottles and the baby diapers and doing this and they go on facebook you know just hang out a little bit and be able to get from the stress and he's saying come on come on in get stress-free come on in vent yourself tell how you don't like wednesday night tell how you didn't like the service today give them to yourself don't worry i ain't got a few more pages on this then i'll get you all to shout again now that's what everybody wants in it [Applause] listen to this friends this is serious stuff facebook addiction disorder a condition that is defined by hours spent on facebook so much time in fact that the healthy balance of the individual's life is affected it has been said that approximately 350 million people are suffering from the disorder the prophet of god said the army of the devil put sickness and disease on people the army of god sent to take it off i not only pray for cancer tb kidney stones i pray for folks with fad fad facebook addiction disorder that's what they're calling it fad and it is a very great fad some of the symptoms tolerance this term is used to describe the desperate behavior of a facebook addict they spend an increasing amount of time on the site coming to a stage where they need it in order to obtain satisfaction or on the other extreme it has had a detrimental effect on them as a person and their life for the family members and friends who think they are dealing with an addict don't nobody look don't nobody move or roll your eyes everybody look straight this way so nobody wants suspicion nobody a sign to look out for are multiple facebook windows open three or four more confirms that they are indeed suffering from this condition withdrawal symptoms they become obvious when one is restricted from using facebook because they have to participate in normal everyday activities like we all used to do you know just stuff that we all used to do you ever watched folks in the restaurant when you're sitting there eating father's on his phone mother's on her all 14 kids have got a cell phone all 14 of them's on their own phone do people even talk anymore a doctor told me and carol not long ago that they are dealing with it in the medical field because people are losing the ability to be able to converse young people have lost the ability many of them to even apply properly on a resume to be able to get a job because everything is abbreviated text language they can't even speak english no more they can't go oh boy we're going to keep right on going now y'all getting quieter and i'm going to get louder if we're not careful we become so we're nothing but a generation of addicts we're addicted to our cell phones we're addicted to facebook we're addicted to gossip we're addicted to all kinds of things i would to god some of us would get addicted to the holy ghost get addicted oh i don't know how to go into the house of god get addicted to prayer meetings get addicted to reading our bible we've got these smartphones and we got the bible on them do we even read them anymore do we even care anymore or are we so wound up in the social media oh children let us get ready for the rapture
