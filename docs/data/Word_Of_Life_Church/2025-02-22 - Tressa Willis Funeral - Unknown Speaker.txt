thank you all for coming I always wish it was under better circumstances that we were here today but I'm still happy to see everyone and I know that my mama would have been happy to see you all here today tresa was uh born 58 years ago passing away on Monday she was a loving wife loving mother and a a grandmother that just was top of the line you can ask any of her kids and you can ask her daughter-in-laws and you can ask me your son-in-law and I'll tell you the honest truth she was a remarkable person and we love her still love her in preparing this speech it's never easy when reflecting on the life uh as we have to but speaking of my mother-in-law there is not enough time to get into the friendship that I had with her for nearly 30 years before I married Britney 15 years ago go I was best friends with her son Zach and Matt and she was always a mother figure to me even before I became part of the family she was always a family first woman she's married to my father-in-law for over 40 years raising three children together one of which uh turned out okay the other two she tried it's all that can be said but she wanted the best for all of them and she did her best to give it to them in our own relationship it was a few years before I knew this I I she told me this about the time me and Britney got married they had just moved to this area and were talking and she so happened to look down and saw a little boy walking down one of the aisles in a little mismatched suit and she said that's going to be my son-in-law right there 12 years later she was proven right she was always there for her kids and the only thing she loved more than them was her grandchildren and I believe that she truly with all her heart loved all of of them and she gave each of them the equal amount of love she never picked any kind of favorites every Christmas every birthday every moment was made special she was always just a phone call away with motherly advice getting into a different side of her though one of my little Parts was my mother-in-law was incredibly easy to startle and I think my brother-in-laws and I put several of the gray hairs on her head due to our more Carefree attitude and general stupidity mama and I would often get into kind of a contest on social media of who could scare the other more with uh jump scares and different videos she never won but I can still remember the all cap text that I would get back and I can still hear her scream oh gee when everything went everything started to scare she would immediately just lock up she made all of us feel special on our birthdays and Christmas every one of my birthdays I had a a box of no bakes and homemade fudge that was better than anything that Gatlinburg could have ever made and I still have my collection of pajama pants that she got us every Christmas all three of us we'll miss those little things now Jesus forgive me when Mama first got the news we all immediately started praying for healing us and all of you and people who never even had the pleasure of meeting her and I want to take this moment to say thank you to each and every one of you who took time to pray and all the prayer cloths the food everything has just been so overwhelming to my family during this time we appreciate the home visits that we that she got and the support during this this was a lot easier when I was rehearsing this in the days leading up to her passing my wife and I had a visit we just got got the news that the time was slipping and it was time to start making your final preparations and start saying your goodbyes and we went over me and my wife and Mama wasn't quite hadn't been quite herself she wasn't able to talk very much there was a music playing in the house and from different churches and one of the songs was Victory in Jesus was playing and the last thing that I actually got to hear her say fully was she raised those little hands and said victory is mine mama raised her feeble hands and said that in front of all of us to all of you who prayed for her healing and to all of us who had hoped the situation would turn out different in healing I'd like to remind you all of something today God did heal her cancer has never had a victory over a child of God mama just went home thank you [Music] life is easy when you're up on the mountain you've got peace of mind like you never know but then things [Music] change you're down in the [Music] valley but don't lose faith for you're never alone for the God on the mountain is still God in the [Music] valley when things go wrong he make make them right and the god of the good times is still God in the bad times the god of the day is still God in the night [Music] oh you talk of Victory when you're up on that mountain oh but t comes so easy when life sad it's B but it's down in the valley [Music] of Trials and [Music] temptations and that's where your faith is put to the test oh but the God all the [Music] mountain is still God in The Valleys when things they go wrong he'll make them rise and the god of the good times is still God in the bad times and the god of the [Music] day is still God in the night oh the god of the day is still God in the night [Music] I know your life own Earth Earth was troubled and only you could know the pain you weren't afraid to face the devil you were no strange to the rain so glorious time on that [Music] mountain child your word on Earth is done go to heaven shine love for the father oh how we [Music] cried the day you left us we gathered round your

great time and we wish you were here [Music] certainly wish to extend our condolences this evening to the family and friends of our dear departed sister it's been a privilege to be able to know the Willis family um for all the years that we've been together and so thankful for the opportunity to be able to lead them into the Paths of Heaven brother Eric we good testing one two use the handhel test test test okay now I got it sorry about that it's been a great privilege for me to be able to um know the Willis family when they moved here several several years ago from Kentucky and these young men and young woman that you see here with a little bit of ot9 things and we've been through a lot of hard trials and tests together of life I want to speak to you for just a few minutes this evening on from dust to Glory Genesis 1: 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he them male and female created he them in Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground so wonder what kind of man that was in Genesis 1 that man was made in the image of God and then God puts that man into a dust body and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathes into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so there are most two different types of men that were in the Garden of Eden we look at ourselves today as human beings and we can see that there is a Supernatural part about us a part that does not die when you came around by today and shook the hands of the family and expressed your heartfelt condolences to them and walked by this cast actually what you saw was an empty house a house that was inhabited just a few days ago by another being a being that is not dead according to Genesis 3: 19 after the fall when God had spoke to man and said in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread and till thou returned to the ground for for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and to dust thou shal return but what part goes back to dust the part that came from dust but where is the other part the man that God created in His image that had that Supernatural part so when our sister tresa was able to make peace with God so many many years ago and be able to pass from Death unto life the Old Testament view of death was very very vague very unclear even to the prophets the sages the righteous men that love God job said it this way in job chap 10 ver 20 are not my days few cease then and let me alone that I may take comfort a little before I go when I shall not return even to a land of darkness the shadow of death job is a great man in his day but death was still so obscure they didn't know where you went they didn't understand and he said a land of Darkness as Darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order where the light is as Darkness Psalm 654 in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks Psalms 55:4 my heart is sore pain was meant Within Me and the Terrors of death are Fallen upon me so it was a world an experience that man didn't know anything about and is in indeed man's greatest fear there's something in us and I think of the great creator of God that whenever we see an urgent situation that within 3/4 of a second from the time that we see somebody stop in front of us our body is able to synchronize together with the brain through the tissues and the nerves and all that sort of thing and we can take our foot off the gas and put her foot on the brake um when God made man that didn't have cars and they didn't have people that drive the way people do today but I'm sure go go God made us with that in mind aren't you we'd been a mess today but you think of how that man was so hidden from the view of death when the Lord Jesus came to the Earth he totally changed the view of death look at this in Matthew chapter 9: 24 he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepest so this was a little girl that had died what we call death and the Lord Jesus said something that was so peculiar and so odd and he said hey hey everybody calm down the little girl ain't dead she's just sleeping and they laughed him to scorn so they made fun of the Lord Jesus and laughed at him and said are you you kid who do you think you are well he knew who he was and he knew the difference between death and eternal separation now he knew that this little girl even though they said she was dead in the way that he looked at it she was not dead at all now as we look at this empty house here this afternoon and we know we call it death and we've all had our acquaintance with death and our heart has been torn from us by facing one death after another after another from our families and our friends but we know our sister Tressa did not die and the reason of that is because she has already died she already face death and by facing that death and accepting the life of the Lord Jesus she can never die again you imagine as the Lord Jesus looked upon them and St John 11 some dear close friends of the Lord Jesus sent him a message and it was about one of his intimate friends this man's name was Lazarus his sisters Mary and Martha sent a messenger and they said Lazarus is very sick and would would you come now they had fors in their churches of that day they had already borne a great reproach for the Lord Jesus and You' think if you was a friend to the Lord Jesus that he would do something so special for you and you see this is where many people misunderstand even when a child of God is allowed to go through so much suffering and people will look and from their mind they're trying to comprehend why would a loving God ever allow his children to go through so much stuff and you're saying why don't he just heal all them and then let all the Sinners and all them Wicked people out there let them go through all the terrible things because God knows he can use his children to prove certain things about his word that he can never use a sinner to prove you know it's amazing that God sometimes will answer prayers within 24 hours of the time we pray many of you probably like myself have seen him answered prayers in the matter of moments and watch what he did my wife called her mother yesterday in Kentucky very very sick and she called her in a few moments we had prayer for her sitting at the kitchen table and she talked to her again today and she said after you all prayed for me she said I turned off the phone and went to sleep immediately and she was testifying to the nurses and stuff where she was it was immediate it was much faster than I could drive 4 and 1/2 hours to be able to get to Kentucky but yet there's times God will answer immediately there's times God will say wait a while and then there's heartbreaking times when God will say no I'm not going to answer this prayer for you and all for for Christians and especially for those that don't understand they look at and say how could he do that because they measure God's love by their love so they look at their children and they think if my child was in a dilemma and my child was in a terrible situation there's no way I would let my child go through that I would reach down there and I'd do whatever I could but see you're measuring God's love by your love I've been a pastor of a church for many many years many decades I'm 68 years old I've been preaching since I was 18 and I've seen folks go through things that I have to tell you as far as a preacher I would have stopped it I would have held it off held it away from them and no doubt I would have made the biggest mess of their life because I'm looking at them with human sympathy and human compassion and I say I would stop them from that I'd never let them go through that I would never let them go through that part no way but God and his wisdom looks and sees that when we go through things he can bring us out on the other side and we will be able to testify of what Grace what mercy and what strengths that he brought us through you see there's been many people that has preceded our our sister tresa I read about them in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 called the faith chapter of the Bible and it begins to list many of them by name and it tells the various things that they went through and they trusted God and they believed God it gives several examples of God answering their prayers and how that God moved for them and wrought a great Deliverance but then it also tells about other people but God didn't answer them that way so there's certain people he will be able to prove his great power one of our sisters right here in the church several months ago passed away right back here in church when service was going on we have some nurses here at the church they went back there we began to pray for her and God spared her life the spirit of God moved for her we've seen so many miracles that God has done right here and at the same time we've had so many funerals so the same God that will raise the dead for some of his children he will let them go through the passage of the Valley of the shadow of death all of us are not called to fulfill the exact same scope in the economy of God there will be many many that love the Lord Jesus with all of their heart and they trusted him to deliver them of that sickness that disease whatever they were dealing with until the last breath left their body and people say well cancer got the best of them oh no no it didn't as a matter of fact I want to tell you T today that disease that riddled our sister's body and all that she went through it is not the Victor today because when life went from her body all them cells that was trying to multiply and take her life and so on what happened to all of them they are the one ones who died not our sister tresa as a matter of fact if we could move from this Earthly house here let us take a little brief brief travel we will go into where she was when she brother Randy told me that the night before probably the same situation the brother Philip was talking about that they was playing music and she had raised her hands up and her feeble hands that had been weakened by so much suffering and all that she went through but able to praise the Lord and love the Lord and worship him so what happened to that part so the part that motivated That animated her hands that animated her mouth to speak and to continuously hold on to the promise of God where is that person where is that image of that person that was doing that oh he say it's here no no it's not here something left this all this is is a house just like this building here it was empty several hours ago people begin to come in pay their respects in a little bit it'll be empty again where's the noise coming from in this building coming from singers preachers people well why don't the building itself make all them voices it has no ability to do so it's only concrete material that was put together to make a building that we call a church but this building has no animation and no life on its own and when life went out of this body what happens she can't even move a finger no longer bat an eye no longer make a smile or a frown but the real person that we're talking about today is part of that image that God made in Genesis 1 you see our body is like an Earthly house and Paul talked about it in 1 Corinthians 1547 the first man is of the Earth's earthy and it is simply made of Earth the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are Earthly as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly this Tabernacle that we live in is simply dust but where's the star part you see God gave Abraham two great shadows and types and every called him he said I want you to look up here to the stars and count them if you can and he said that's the way your seed will be then he brought him to the seashore and he Saidi want you to count the dust the grains of sand if you can that's the way your seed will be so from dust to stars from Genesis 1 to Genesis 2 and Paul says it this way for if this Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a build building of God an house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so in this we do grown Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven and if so being found clothed he said we will not be found naked at that day so when this Supernatural part that come out of this Tabernacle sister tresa the real one where did it go what happened to it is she a ghost today just a spirit that might appear and disappear and we may never see her again is that is that what she is no no actually she moved into a body that is called theophany and the word Theo of course those of you that know your Bible Theo comes from the same word that we use for deity Theos so it is a body that was made eternal in the heavens so when the life on out of this body it simply changed houses what sister tresa did on Monday was changed addresses God gave her many years ago an address change notification it was in the form of the Gospel she heard that and something touched her heart she'd been working on on that Journey ever since getting ready to move so instead of when she came down to death screaming hollering crying oh God I'm lost oh God I'm lost somebody help me somebody help me pull me out of the flames of fire no she didn't have to do that she could just simply take her last breath and all of a sudden she stepped out of this house now if you can imagine all that our poor sisters went through as my wife and I went to see them week before last and uh we were just both in shock how much she had changed since the last time we'd seen her brother Randy but just beyond this Veil is another body she'll never have another pain another heartache another sorrow you see the very same event that happened on Monday when the Bible tells us in the Book of Psalms precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints precious was it precious to you all humanly we cry we we feel like something's been taken from us how can the same event be so precious and so heartbreaking to us if we could break in and talk to our sister brother Randy told me the other day and I talked to him my wife Carol and I talked about the same thing I've heard it from two or three people that maybe one of the first ones that when our sister tresa was able to step across Paul likened death to a simple Journey he said the time of my departure is at hand the word that Paul used was a Greek word for shipping so it like the boat was tied to the Moorings the ropes were tied the boat had been loaded the captain was on board the merchants everything was in line and then all of a sudden they say let's go they loose the ropes from the big post which are buried feet in the ground and the ship begins to let go out into the waters and he said the time of my departure is at hand for just a moment before I close let us imagine our sister's heart rate begins to change her blood pressure she's getting to where she can't hear anymore and this Mortal realm skipping breaths she's never been here quite like this before but all of a sudden from another realm that realm becomes more real than this one and she feels herself as it were a vapor which is what the Bible says that we are like a vapor it begins to lift from the Earth's this body here like the morning fog and when the sun begins to shine upon it and it will cause it to just disappear in one moment she was in This Old House and the next moment she was on board the ship of Zion didn't take her 24 hours didn't take her 24 minutes but just in a moment like as soon as she stepped into the ship and she disembarked the ship let's just watch her as she she steps out as she sets her foot upon the shore and she looks around and she sees colors like she's never seen before the sun was unlike anything she'd ever seen the skies the the grass and here comes somebody running there might have been several some from this side some from that side some from that side but I could see one maybe about that tall her long hair hanging Plumb down past her knees her arms out my precious sister who is it oh my goodness it's my daughter Erica sister tresa prayed for her so much there's another one and another one and another one and sister Trestle looks around and she realizes iaz made it I've made it I'm not sure that her and Erica have stopped running yet since she got there my friends if you and I could only be allowed a few minutes to see that land and what awaits us nothing we go through in this life would ever compare to that world to be honest with you I'm glad I can't really see that world all the time I catch glimpses of it every now and then when I preach a funeral or when I'm studying or praying but I'm glad that I I don't have constant access because it would make me why I would be so Heavenly minded I wouldn't be one bit of Earthly good but I know it's there waiting for us sister Tressa would you want to come back oh brother Donnie I've heard you preach about it so much I've heard other preachers preach about it but take my word word for it you don't have a clue what it's like I've already met the CH J's messenger I've met people from our church and the amazing thing about it is brother Donnie we're all the same age there's no babies there's no real old people we're all the same age it's just hard to imagine the flowers and the colors everything it's just I I don't have the word and I've experiened such love I I felt it from time to time in church and i' I'd feel it I could just feel a little bit of it but it is beyond comprehension sister Trester is there anything you'd want me to say to your family tell them to do everything they can to be ready tell them to meet me I'll be waiting for them at the river as God sent me some people down at the river to welcome me I'll be waiting for them may God and His Mercy comfort chch your hearts and help you as only he can I don't know exactly how you all feel today I've still had my wife but I've lost a mother a father Aunts Uncles a daughter but I know it may feel like that there's a hole in your heart there and nobody will ever be able to feel that for you and that is that is true but the Lord God can help Comfort us through these Hard Times until we're able to meet again may God bless each of you and strengthen you and help you is my prayer can we just bow our heads together I know this might seem unusual but with their heads bowed and no one looking around is there would there be anybody here today that would say I want to meet her but I'm I'm not I'm not ready really I know I'm not would you pray for me we won't embarrass you I promise you God bless you God bless you make preparation that wouldn't be my advice Hallelujah have hely father as we come to celebrate this life we know really that a Christian preaches their own funeral it's an honor to be able to stand and try to say something about your children that have lived a Godly life and been faithful Lord we prayed and we hoped and we believe that you would do a miracle for our sister and that you would let her live let her be able to enjoy her life and her children her grandchildren s Carol and I went to see her the other day and someone had made her a a little quilt a wrap of a thing and had all the pictures of the grandchildren on there and she was so proud of it but she didn't just love them here in life she wants to have them there too so I pray you'd help them Father help the parents to be able to instruct them Lord and tell them what to do so they can go where she is we can't bring her back and we wouldn't anyway we wouldn't want to call her back to this old body Lord God the best thing for us to do is just to make ready and stay ready so we can be able to meet her I pray for brother Randy I pray for the children I pray for their spouses the grandchildren the friends the other family members Lord some that couldn't even be here today for the church family God that you would help us that you'd give us strength Lord we thank you Father that there is a land beyond the river we thank you Lord Jesus that you made a way that this part of us which has been quickened to eternal life as a body that's there waiting thank you Father somewhere beyond the Jordan River there's a place Lord that we're longing to go and see help us today I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord let me just say to you that by God's grace each one of us can make the same safe passage that our sister has made and if you want to go where she is you'll have to come through the same route and there's only one way and that way is a person it's not a preacher it's not a church but Jesus Christ himself said I am the way he he's not one of the ways but I am the way the truth and the life and if you don't know him today I just just feel strangely in my heart to say this to you that it's quite simple he made the way for us and we simply accept what he has done and follow his Commandments and his truths and his word and by that if we come by this way it will guarantee us a safe passage to the other side brother Ry buddy we love you going to be praying for you and the children is that right friends when we leave here today we're not just going to walk out these doors and say okay our part's done no please please remember them that God will will give them strength [Music] somewhere just across the Jordan [Music] River there's a place to be Everlasting joy and [Music] peace the tree is blue booming there [Music] forever the CR can we sing it together forgive me I'm sorry Hallelujah that sounds like H to me like where I long to be there'll be no tears to feel our eyes again the heels will Echo with thank you Lord we sing of his grace
