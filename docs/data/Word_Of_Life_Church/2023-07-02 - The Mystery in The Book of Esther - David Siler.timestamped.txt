[53:36] Tabernacle and then there's a group out
[53:38] in Sarah vest and a little small group
[53:40] here and there brother Branham never
[53:42] actually got to go to message churches

[53:48] if he would have been here this week
[53:49] with us
[53:50] I've been able to preach what God placed
[53:52] on his heart

[57:13] wonderful singing everything that's been
[57:15] done for us appreciate brother Donna
[57:17] giving us this opportunity amen now he's
[57:20] come to have church today
[57:23] Esther chapter 2 verse 5.
[57:25] I'd like to speak to you on the mystery
[57:27] of the Book of Esther Esther chapter 2
[57:31] verse 5.
[57:32] now in shoesome the palace there was a
[57:35] certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the
[57:38] son of jair the son of shemiah the son
[57:41] of Kisha Benjamin
[57:43] who had been carried away from Jerusalem
[57:45] with the Captivity which had been
[57:47] carried away with jokanai king of Judah
[57:49] whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon
[57:52] had carried away
[57:53] and he brought up hadessa that is Esther
[57:57] his uncle's daughter first she had
[57:59] neither father nor mother and the maid
[58:02] was spare and beautiful whom bordecai
[58:06] when her father and mother were dead
[58:07] took for his own daughter and it came to
[58:11] pass when the king's commandment and his
[58:13] decree Was Heard and when many maidens
[58:15] were gathered together to shushen the
[58:17] Palace to the custody of hagai that
[58:20] Esther was brought also into the King's
[58:22] house to the custody of haggai Keeper of
[58:25] the women
[58:26] and the Maiden pleased him
[58:28] and she obtained kindness of him
[58:32] and he speedily gave her things for
[58:35] purification
[58:38] with such things as belonged to her
[58:40] seven maidens which for me to be given
[58:43] her out of the King's house and he
[58:46] preferred her and her mates unto the
[58:49] best place of the House of the women
[58:51] brought down to verse 16.
[58:54] so Esther was taken into the king of
[58:56] hazarus into his house Royal in the
[58:59] tenth month which is the month of Tibet
[59:01] in the seventh year of his reign and the
[59:06] King loved Esther
[59:09] above all the women Hallelujah and she
[59:13] obtained Grace
[59:15] and favor in the sight more than all the
[59:19] versions
[59:20] so that he set the Royal Crown upon her
[59:23] head and made her Queen instead of
[59:26] ashtime let's just buy a horse today and
[59:28] ask the Lord just to help us
[59:30] Heavenly Father we are so thankful to be
[59:33] gathered together together Lord that you
[59:35] have given us this moment in time to be
[59:37] able to Lord come and see one another
[59:40] fellowship visit with one another the
[59:43] Lord the greatest attraction Among Us is
[59:46] the thing that we all have in common and
[59:49] it's this great message that you've sent
[59:51] and father we just asked that this
[59:53] morning that you would just help us may
[59:56] the anointing come Lord and may you just
[59:58] help us to move aside help this
[1:00:00] congregation Lord we've seen you do so
[1:00:03] many things Lord last night and we want
[1:00:05] to tell you how thankful that you are we
[1:00:08] want to be careful to give you thanks
[1:00:10] lord it's so important that we approach
[1:00:12] you with Thanksgiving in our heart and
[1:00:14] Lord we believe that you've done
[1:00:16] wonderful things and we believe that
[1:00:18] you'll continue to do things Lord as we
[1:00:20] leave this place Lord and heal and
[1:00:22] virtue we'll go with us Lord in your
[1:00:24] people's lives no doubt they have been
[1:00:26] changed we thank you for it today
[1:00:28] fathers we look into your word take the
[1:00:31] word of God break it to us we ask now in
[1:00:34] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:00:36] everybody said
[1:00:37] amen God bless you today you can be
[1:00:39] seated
[1:00:47] we know that our God is all-knowing
[1:00:53] is
[1:00:54] is infinite that he knows the beginning
[1:00:57] from the end
[1:00:59] veteran makes a statement and I want to
[1:01:01] build from this today if the Lord will
[1:01:03] help us as we look into this out of the
[1:01:06] power of God 1955 Abraham said
[1:01:09] predestination looks back to
[1:01:10] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on
[1:01:13] to destination and in order to be God he
[1:01:17] know the end from the beginning so he
[1:01:19] could predict it and set things in order
[1:01:22] to happen that he could order certain
[1:01:24] things for certain ages aren't you glad
[1:01:27] you're living in the right age
[1:01:29] again the resurrection of Jesus he said
[1:01:31] it's been well stated that
[1:01:33] predestination looks back to
[1:01:34] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on
[1:01:37] to Destiny and God in the beginning
[1:01:39] could see all the things the way it
[1:01:40] would happen therefore he could tell it
[1:01:43] to be this way or to be that obey so God
[1:01:46] could foretell he knows exactly every
[1:01:50] person that would be born in this day
[1:01:53] therefore you're not living in this day
[1:01:55] by chance but you're living in this day
[1:01:58] because God allocated your Dave then
[1:02:00] this is the time that he's called you to
[1:02:02] be alive and we know that God's of
[1:02:05] course whenever he destined something he
[1:02:07] destineds it by election and we know
[1:02:10] that of election looks back to
[1:02:12] foreknowledge foreknowledge looks on to
[1:02:14] the end so whenever you come into this
[1:02:17] day that God would choose you to be able
[1:02:20] to live at this time that God has
[1:02:23] foreordained a destiny he has placed a
[1:02:27] purpose in your life and God has has
[1:02:30] called you as an individual to be able
[1:02:33] to fulfill his part of the word in this
[1:02:36] day now we know that that's something
[1:02:38] that God has always done he projects
[1:02:40] into the future what's going to take
[1:02:42] place he projects in the future what's
[1:02:45] going to happen you'll remember whenever
[1:02:47] Jesus was upon Mount olives and he was
[1:02:49] fixing to ride into Jerusalem remember
[1:02:52] it had already been prophesied by
[1:02:54] Zechariah that Jesus was going to come
[1:02:57] riding into Jerusalem it had already
[1:03:00] been written in the script it had
[1:03:02] already been written in the word and
[1:03:04] nothing can change what God had already
[1:03:07] prophesied in his word that God had
[1:03:10] already foretold he was going to come
[1:03:12] writing into Jerusalem whenever
[1:03:14] Zechariah says it in Zechariah Zechariah
[1:03:17] 99 the Bible said Rejoice greatly o
[1:03:21] Daughter of Zion and Shout o daughter of
[1:03:25] Jerusalem that Behold thy King cometh
[1:03:28] unto thee he is just having salvation
[1:03:31] he's going to come lowly riding upon an
[1:03:34] ass and upon a cult the fold of an ass
[1:03:37] so Jesus come to fulfill that part of
[1:03:41] the word that Zechariah have prophesied
[1:03:44] and we know that somebody had to fulfill
[1:03:46] it but not just anybody but it was there
[1:03:49] for the king to fulfill that part of the
[1:03:52] word now we know that there not only
[1:03:55] does Jesus got to fulfill his part but
[1:03:58] the Bible said Rejoice greatly o
[1:04:01] Daughters of Zion and then he tells us
[1:04:04] to shout o daughter of Jerusalem so if
[1:04:08] Jesus is going to fulfill his part I've
[1:04:11] come riding into Jerusalem somebody's
[1:04:13] got to fulfill the other part somebody's
[1:04:16] got to Rejoice somebody's got to shout
[1:04:19] somebody's got to fulfill what Zechariah
[1:04:22] has already said and let me say this
[1:04:24] they could not just sit and observe the
[1:04:27] king coming into Jerusalem they could
[1:04:30] not just come and see it all Let Me Tell
[1:04:32] we've had plenty of Sinners around the
[1:04:34] message
[1:04:36] oh yes we've had plenty of Spectators
[1:04:39] that has come around the message but God
[1:04:41] don't want just spectators
[1:04:43] but God wants some participators today
[1:04:47] amen not only does Jesus got to do his
[1:04:51] part but I want to tell you you've got
[1:04:53] to do your part you'll remember in The
[1:04:56] Book of Mark chapter 11 that Jesus tells
[1:04:59] the disciples he said I want you to go
[1:05:00] down to a certain Village and when you
[1:05:02] go there you're going to find a cult
[1:05:05] that is tied up and what I want you to
[1:05:07] do is I want you to take and I want you
[1:05:09] to loose that coat and I want you to
[1:05:12] bring that cult to me and if any man
[1:05:14] would ask you why are you loosing the
[1:05:16] cloth you just tell him his master has
[1:05:19] need of him amen now know this notice
[1:05:22] that Jesus foretells them exactly what's
[1:05:26] going to happen and listen to me he not
[1:05:28] only foretold them what was going to
[1:05:31] take place he told them that that donkey
[1:05:34] was going to be there so when they go
[1:05:36] there the word has already been spoken
[1:05:39] the word has already been declared and
[1:05:42] now here is the call that is there and
[1:05:45] tied up they begin to lose sin and as
[1:05:47] they lose him here comes a man and he
[1:05:50] says why are you loosing the call oh his
[1:05:53] master has need of him I want to tell
[1:05:56] you not only did Jesus have a part but
[1:05:59] even that donkey had a part to fulfill
[1:06:01] you realize his life had a purpose the
[1:06:06] day that he was born he was destined to
[1:06:08] pack the word back into Jerusalem it had
[1:06:12] already been prophesied and not just any
[1:06:14] donkey can't fulfill this but it takes
[1:06:17] the right one born at the right season
[1:06:19] that his birth had to be born at the
[1:06:21] right time that when they went there he
[1:06:23] would be of the right age in the right
[1:06:25] time and the right moment and when they
[1:06:27] go there there he is because it's
[1:06:29] already been written in the word and I
[1:06:31] want to say this he was the one that was
[1:06:34] going to fulfill that part of the word
[1:06:36] that Zechariah had already prophesied
[1:06:39] about
[1:06:40] he was elected to pack the king back
[1:06:44] into Jerusalem he was not born just to
[1:06:47] pack beans he was not born just to pack
[1:06:50] weed out of the field but he was born to
[1:06:52] carry the words
[1:06:55] it was his Destiny to pack the word back
[1:06:59] into Jerusalem all my he was called in
[1:07:02] that moment to fulfill a 500 year old
[1:07:06] Prophecy of the Messiah coming into
[1:07:08] Jerusalem
[1:07:12] and then we come to this little Book of
[1:07:15] Esther
[1:07:16] and let me say this
[1:07:18] nobody else could fulfill this part of
[1:07:22] becoming the queen Now esther is a type
[1:07:26] of the bride and the church said amen
[1:07:28] now catch this it was during this time
[1:07:31] that the King was showcasing his kingdom
[1:07:34] before all the princes of the lamb in
[1:07:37] other words there was a gathering that
[1:07:39] was going on and
[1:07:49] seven days had been allocated for the
[1:07:51] feast to come and for six days he would
[1:07:55] show them pieces and parts of this
[1:07:57] Kingdom but on the last day which is the
[1:08:01] seventh day
[1:08:02] [Applause]
[1:08:05] he wants his Queen
[1:08:08] to be showcased
[1:08:10] for six days he give them pieces and
[1:08:12] parts but on the last day the king is
[1:08:15] wanting his Queen to come and be shown
[1:08:18] amongst the princes of the lamb and I
[1:08:20] want to say this in the last day he
[1:08:23] wants her to be seen he does not want
[1:08:25] her to be hid away but he wants her to
[1:08:28] come to the Forefront he wanted to
[1:08:31] present her before the people of the
[1:08:33] land
[1:08:35] but during this time Queen vashti
[1:08:39] she was holding her own little
[1:08:42] denominational Gathering
[1:08:46] huh
[1:08:47] she had her own little Council of
[1:08:50] churches that was going on
[1:08:53] and whenever the king orders her to come
[1:08:56] and stand beside him she refused to come
[1:09:00] before the king and
[1:09:02] bearish the king because he had set this
[1:09:06] whole Feast up to make her the thing
[1:09:08] that everyone would see at the last day
[1:09:11] of the feast but she refused to come
[1:09:13] under the headship of the word and when
[1:09:15] he did the king put that Highway
[1:09:19] we know that that is a top we understand
[1:09:22] that the king turned down vashti because
[1:09:26] of her refusal to go on with the word of
[1:09:30] the king the king put her away and when
[1:09:33] she refused the king he had no choice
[1:09:38] and the prophet says it like this a
[1:09:40] marriage and divorce he said you'll
[1:09:42] remember in the Bible when the King
[1:09:44] married Esther listen to this you'll
[1:09:46] remember in the Bible when the King
[1:09:48] married Esther because the queen refused
[1:09:51] he got him another one and what happened
[1:09:55] when she refused to come out with the
[1:09:58] King and Obey him I want you to notice
[1:10:00] mother Brown brings a parallel from that
[1:10:03] event of the Old Testament and he brings
[1:10:06] a parallel of that event right to the
[1:10:09] day that we're living in now and he said
[1:10:11] she refused to come out to the king to
[1:10:13] obey him and he did it he proved it in
[1:10:17] the days of Luther Wesley and Pentecost
[1:10:21] when they refuse to become a father part
[1:10:24] of him by having a spiritual sexual
[1:10:26] Affair to become pregnant with a further
[1:10:28] part of the word you understand
[1:10:31] she refused
[1:10:33] and the Lutheran Church
[1:10:36] refused for Christ to have many more
[1:10:38] Desire with her Luther refuse it and so
[1:10:41] is it it today with every one of them
[1:10:44] they fail to take that word
[1:10:48] so he's telling us the king is looking
[1:10:51] for somebody
[1:10:53] to take the fullness of the word of God
[1:10:55] he's looking for somebody and Luther's
[1:10:58] age didn't do it and Wesley's age didn't
[1:11:00] do it even the Pentecostals organized
[1:11:03] themselves and they refused to do it
[1:11:06] oh but let me tell you there he is again
[1:11:10] in the land today Hallelujah there's
[1:11:14] another people in the land today who
[1:11:16] under their messenger it's going to be a
[1:11:18] final voice to a final age they will not
[1:11:22] refuse to learn they will not reject the
[1:11:24] promise they will not reject this
[1:11:26] message but they'll come out and they'll
[1:11:28] receive it wholeheartedly
[1:11:36] so the king
[1:11:38] puts away those organizations
[1:11:41] and now there's going to be a search
[1:11:44] on the last day for a new Queen
[1:11:47] so the king sends out a decree
[1:11:52] or a shout
[1:11:53] Hallelujah
[1:11:55] and let me say this it is an invitation
[1:11:58] but it's not just for everybody not just
[1:12:02] everybody's going to believe this King
[1:12:04] [Applause]
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:07] not just any woman will do
[1:12:10] just you know person will do but to be
[1:12:13] the queen you must be elected by the
[1:12:16] king to be the queen
[1:12:20] it's not by your choice
[1:12:23] it's about the king's choice
[1:12:25] glory to God
[1:12:27] it just so happens to be
[1:12:30] at this time in the history of Jewish
[1:12:33] scripture
[1:12:34] that just so happens to be
[1:12:36] oh we would say oh maybe by chance we
[1:12:40] believe it's more than that
[1:12:41] there happens to be a little Jewish Girl
[1:12:44] by the name of Esther
[1:12:47] she's living near the palace
[1:12:51] she's never been in the inner court yet
[1:12:55] oh my she's not in the palace she's
[1:12:58] living in the outer courts of it she's
[1:13:01] never come in yet she's still living on
[1:13:03] the outside
[1:13:05] but her Destiny is about to change
[1:13:08] Hallelujah
[1:13:10] now her cousin at this time that had
[1:13:14] took her in Mordecai
[1:13:16] Mordecai had a position in the palace
[1:13:20] and he had found oh how can I say it he
[1:13:24] had found favor with the King he had a
[1:13:26] position in the body he had a position
[1:13:28] of favor he'd been elevated into the
[1:13:31] kingdom and he found favor during the
[1:13:34] time that Vestal was refused Here Comes
[1:13:37] Mordecai upon the sink
[1:13:39] and during that time that Luther and
[1:13:42] Wesley and Pentecost had been rejected
[1:13:45] here's a man that's got favor in the
[1:13:47] Kingdom
[1:13:51] I said here's a man that's got a
[1:13:53] position he knows what the king wants he
[1:13:56] knows what the king desires he knows
[1:13:58] what the king is looking for in this day
[1:14:01] and since Esther was a virgin preach
[1:14:05] with me somebody
[1:14:06] she's Justified to go into the presence
[1:14:09] of the king
[1:14:11] now listen
[1:14:13] in order to come before the king
[1:14:15] whenever they come in there's got to be
[1:14:18] a time of purification
[1:14:21] in other words the king don't want to
[1:14:24] see something that's unclean he don't
[1:14:27] want to see something that's not not
[1:14:29] pure so he gives them a time of
[1:14:32] purification there's a process of
[1:14:35] redemption that they have to go through
[1:14:36] there's a time of cleansing and
[1:14:39] justification and sanctification
[1:14:42] you realize
[1:14:44] they would go through 12 months of
[1:14:47] cleansing
[1:14:48] before they come before the king
[1:14:51] think about that 12 months of cleansing
[1:14:53] which tells us that the king wants
[1:14:56] somebody that's clean
[1:14:58] he wants somebody can I say it that
[1:15:01] ain't got spot or blemish that ain't got
[1:15:04] the dirt of the world
[1:15:06] [Music]
[1:15:07] [Applause]
[1:15:09] another reason why is 12 months would go
[1:15:13] by it would guarantee that the woman
[1:15:16] coming in has not been with another man
[1:15:18] it would guarantee that she's not
[1:15:20] carrying another man's seed or another
[1:15:23] king or you hear me she's not carrying
[1:15:25] another King's seed she's not carrying
[1:15:27] another kingdom seed but she's pure and
[1:15:30] they give her the time to make sure that
[1:15:32] she's caring no other life in her
[1:15:35] I said he wants no other life's hitter
[1:15:40] so they go through a time of cleansing
[1:15:42] the Bible says in Esther 2 and 8 it came
[1:15:44] to pass when the king's commandment and
[1:15:46] his decree was heard when knitting
[1:15:48] maidens were gathered together in the
[1:15:50] shoes in the palace he said that Esther
[1:15:52] was brought to the King's house to the
[1:15:54] custody of The Keeper of the women
[1:15:56] aren't you glad you got to keep her
[1:15:59] and the Maiden pleased him don't you
[1:16:02] love that
[1:16:03] she didn't just find favor with the King
[1:16:06] but she finds favor with everybody she
[1:16:09] comes in contacts with
[1:16:12] Hallelujah in other words she's got
[1:16:15] character there there's something about
[1:16:17] her that whenever people meet her she's
[1:16:20] different than the rest of the women
[1:16:22] she's different than the rest of the
[1:16:23] churches
[1:16:24] [Applause]
[1:16:27] the maiden pleased him
[1:16:29] she obtained kindness of him and he
[1:16:32] speedily gave her things for
[1:16:33] purification such things as belong to
[1:16:36] her I love that she just walks in and
[1:16:39] all sudden she's got one gift after
[1:16:41] another after another and he says these
[1:16:43] belong to you what I do to earn it you
[1:16:45] didn't earn it what did I do to deserve
[1:16:46] it you don't deserve it but I'm going to
[1:16:48] give these to you
[1:16:51] seven mates out of the King's house and
[1:16:54] he preferred her and her mates into the
[1:16:57] Blessed place of the House of the women
[1:16:58] and Esther watch
[1:17:01] Esther had not showed her people
[1:17:04] nor her Kindred which means lettuce for
[1:17:07] Mordecai her charged her that she should
[1:17:10] not show it
[1:17:12] so here is Esther
[1:17:14] and Mordecai tells her
[1:17:17] you keep your DNA a mystery
[1:17:22] keep your lineage a mystery
[1:17:25] where you come from keep it a mystery I
[1:17:28] want you to keep this a secret so it's
[1:17:32] going to remain a secret for so long
[1:17:35] Hallelujah don't you tell it's a mystery
[1:17:38] and let me say this I want the
[1:17:39] revelation of who you are to remain a
[1:17:43] mystery so keep it silent history
[1:17:46] now no doubt there was a lot of women
[1:17:49] that come that wanted to have a claim
[1:17:52] upon the king
[1:17:53] they wanted to have a claim upon his
[1:17:55] kingdom they claimed they was his type
[1:18:01] they claimed they know what he wanted
[1:18:03] they claim they know but pleased him
[1:18:08] there's a lot of people that's getting
[1:18:10] ready there's a lot of people that's
[1:18:12] reading this and believing that but I
[1:18:14] want to say this Esther was the only one
[1:18:17] that had a prophet that was getting her
[1:18:19] ready to meet the king
[1:18:22] brother there's been churches churches
[1:18:24] Brides brides Church of Brothers coming
[1:18:26] one and let me say this we don't have to
[1:18:29] wonder if we know what the king wants
[1:18:30] we've got a message that has told us
[1:18:33] what the king desires today
[1:18:40] that's why we're not ashamed of this
[1:18:42] message
[1:18:44] because it takes Malachi 4's message to
[1:18:47] dress the bride in this day
[1:18:50] if God want an organization he would
[1:18:52] have took Luther he would have took
[1:18:54] Wesley he would have took last time
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:00] this message
[1:19:02] is the only thing that the king is going
[1:19:04] to recognize
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:08] not Sensations not just emotions not
[1:19:11] just gathering in the building not just
[1:19:13] sitting on a Pew he's going to recognize
[1:19:15] the word of this day
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:19] Hallelujah
[1:19:21] Mordecai knows about this ideal
[1:19:25] will not please the king
[1:19:27] he knows that a Creed will not please
[1:19:30] the king Darkness ideals beliefs from
[1:19:33] man it'll never please the king he knows
[1:19:37] it'll take the unfiling body word of the
[1:19:41] son of man to bring the right woman into
[1:19:44] the presence of the king he don't want
[1:19:46] something that's been mixed he don't
[1:19:47] want man's ideas he wants the
[1:19:49] unadulterated word for this day
[1:19:54] somebody that's not ashamed of his
[1:19:56] spirit
[1:20:00] a people that's not afraid to rejoice
[1:20:02] and to worship and to lift their hands
[1:20:06] and to give glory to God somebody help
[1:20:09] me now he wants somebody who'll believe
[1:20:11] the word for this day they're not
[1:20:13] ashamed of the message and they're not
[1:20:15] ashamed of the messenger
[1:20:23] too many people are on our message what
[1:20:25] a classical Holy Ghost
[1:20:27] and God don't give classical Holy Ghost
[1:20:32] you realize the number one word that
[1:20:35] brother Brown used to describe a new
[1:20:36] birth you know what it was a mess
[1:20:39] [Applause]
[1:20:41] I said it's a mess
[1:20:43] our New Birth has got to be a mess not
[1:20:46] preachers religion
[1:20:50] got to be a mess
[1:20:53] no matter where birth happens at it's a
[1:20:56] mess
[1:20:57] not some dried confession not something
[1:21:00] that's made up or put on something
[1:21:02] genuine
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:05] she's got to be dressed right and let me
[1:21:08] say this she can't dress the way she
[1:21:11] wants to
[1:21:12] [Applause]
[1:21:14] she's got to please the king
[1:21:16] so it takes a special dress
[1:21:19] to be able to catch the king's eye and
[1:21:22] the prophet tells his presence thank you
[1:21:23] my Ministry I hope he'll Crown my
[1:21:26] Ministry with this of letting me take
[1:21:28] the clothes of the word and dress his
[1:21:31] pride in the clothes of the word for his
[1:21:34] righteousness
[1:21:36] I'm glad he didn't say it's mine aren't
[1:21:38] you glad he didn't say it's yours but
[1:21:40] it's the king's righteousness that he's
[1:21:42] looking at today
[1:21:44] again in the evening messenger The
[1:21:46] Messengers hunting the bride trying to
[1:21:48] find character if that man has come and
[1:21:50] messing to the last day he's trying to
[1:21:52] find a bride for Christ he'll not look
[1:21:54] for denominational membership
[1:21:58] he will look for a character that's
[1:22:00] willing
[1:22:01] that's the messenger of the last days
[1:22:03] the evening light Hallelujah
[1:22:06] he said he'll find that church
[1:22:12] where they'll believe the message
[1:22:16] and I want to say he found it
[1:22:20] he ain't looking for it no more he's
[1:22:23] found it he's not searching for it no
[1:22:25] more he has found it he's not looking
[1:22:28] for a bride he's found her
[1:22:31] he said she'll just stand still long
[1:22:32] enough to tell her how the bride's got
[1:22:34] to redress she's got to be closed stand
[1:22:37] still
[1:22:38] so Mordecai told Esther all the things
[1:22:42] that she needed to be ready to meet the
[1:22:45] king
[1:22:47] I said he told you everything you need
[1:22:50] to find favor in the presence of the
[1:22:52] king and Elijah has provided everything
[1:22:55] that we need by this word to be able to
[1:22:58] obtain the blessing in the last days
[1:23:00] he's provided everything that we have
[1:23:02] need of friends if you don't have the
[1:23:04] blessing it's not brother Venom's fault
[1:23:06] it's not the ministry's fault the fault
[1:23:08] belongs to me and you he's given us
[1:23:10] everything we need to obtain it
[1:23:16] if you need healing it's in there if you
[1:23:19] need Deliverance it's in there if you
[1:23:21] need Victory it's in there if you need
[1:23:23] the Holy Ghost that's in there if you
[1:23:25] need Joy it's in there everything that
[1:23:27] we have need of legs in the word for
[1:23:30] this day
[1:23:35] but brother tell me what I got to do put
[1:23:37] it on I said Put it on put that word on
[1:23:41] put the put the word on of God upon you
[1:23:43] and allow that glory to be seen upon
[1:23:46] your life
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:50] and the Bible says in verse 16.
[1:23:53] that Esther
[1:23:55] was taken to the king of Hazards
[1:23:58] into his house Royal
[1:24:01] in the 10th month
[1:24:03] of the seventh year
[1:24:08] 10
[1:24:09] and said
[1:24:11] she didn't go in under 10. listen she
[1:24:15] went in under 10 7. on the 10th day of
[1:24:18] the seventh month and the last time all
[1:24:21] of this is happening under 10 7. the
[1:24:23] bride is being dressed under ten seven
[1:24:26] the bride is making herself ready under
[1:24:29] ten seven under ten seven she's found
[1:24:31] Grace under ten seven she's found Mercy
[1:24:34] under ten seven she's got the blessing
[1:24:37] where'd it come from under ten seven in
[1:24:40] the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:24:42] angel when he shall begin to sell the
[1:24:45] mystery of Esther
[1:24:55] under 10-7
[1:24:57] and the seventh Church age there's going
[1:25:00] to be a people come out of that age not
[1:25:02] another day to come not another age to
[1:25:05] come she's the final voice to the final
[1:25:07] age
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:14] so 10
[1:25:15] 7.
[1:25:17] brings her into the presence of the king
[1:25:23] and verse 17 says
[1:25:25] and the King
[1:25:27] he ain't just infatuated with her
[1:25:31] this ain't just something we can visit
[1:25:35] but the king
[1:25:37] fed head over heels in love
[1:25:40] isn't that incredible
[1:25:42] you can plan when you buy a house
[1:25:45] you can plan when you go to college but
[1:25:47] when it comes to love
[1:25:49] you fall
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:25:59] and there's been a lot of women that's
[1:26:00] come by the king
[1:26:02] but then this woman dressed in the
[1:26:05] king's desire when she comes in the
[1:26:08] king's not looking past her he's not
[1:26:10] looking for another people he's not
[1:26:12] looking for another church he's not
[1:26:14] looking for another preach with me
[1:26:15] somebody he looks at her and the Bible
[1:26:18] said the king loved Esther above all the
[1:26:22] churches
[1:26:23] a woman in the Bible represents the
[1:26:25] church he loves her above every church
[1:26:27] every denomination Catholicism cannot
[1:26:30] receive it denominationalism can't
[1:26:33] receive it but in the presence of the
[1:26:35] king she found love and favor
[1:26:37] [Applause]
[1:26:42] and we found favor
[1:26:49] and I'm not talking about a love that's
[1:26:51] going to end tomorrow or a love that's
[1:26:53] going to end next month or love that's
[1:26:54] going to end next year but this love is
[1:26:57] eternal love it's an agape love that
[1:27:00] once you've got the heart of God God
[1:27:01] can't lose you
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:08] feel my preacher coming home
[1:27:10] [Applause]
[1:27:13] be good brother David it's dedication
[1:27:14] let's just forget that half the church
[1:27:19] she obtained Grace
[1:27:22] and favor
[1:27:23] more than all the virgins
[1:27:27] come on
[1:27:28] I said there was more than just one
[1:27:30] virgin
[1:27:31] but this version this virtue was the
[1:27:34] elect
[1:27:34] virtue
[1:27:38] and the King didn't have to think about
[1:27:39] it from us
[1:27:42] but the Bible says he set the Royal
[1:27:44] Crown up on her head
[1:27:47] and he made her Queen
[1:27:50] instead of Luther Wesley Pentecost
[1:27:53] denominationalism
[1:27:56] can you imagine
[1:27:58] no doubt she had
[1:28:01] living near the palace
[1:28:04] she'd seen royalty
[1:28:06] she'd watch them as they would
[1:28:09] come in and out
[1:28:12] being a little girl no doubt she would
[1:28:14] think about what would it be like
[1:28:17] to be able to be one of the Royals of
[1:28:20] the House of the king
[1:28:21] to be able to wear those type of dresses
[1:28:24] to be able to look like that and be
[1:28:27] cared for and taken care of
[1:28:30] that everything that they would have
[1:28:32] need of what would it be like to be that
[1:28:35] person she'd see how beautiful the queen
[1:28:37] was she seen how wonderful they was
[1:28:39] treated
[1:28:41] oh my no doubt she would go to bed at
[1:28:43] night dreaming about being royalty
[1:28:46] but what she didn't know
[1:28:49] like that little donkey
[1:28:51] she was destined
[1:28:54] she was destined to become the queen
[1:28:58] it could not even Be Imagined in her
[1:29:01] mind I hope you're hearing me she cannot
[1:29:03] even imagine her mind that the king
[1:29:06] would want somebody like her oh can I
[1:29:09] say it for him we Feel So Unworthy
[1:29:11] sometimes so unlovable sometimes we look
[1:29:14] at our humanity and the faults and the
[1:29:15] failures of our humanity and it's so
[1:29:18] hard to comprehend that the king would
[1:29:20] desire Someone Like Us
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:28] and no politics involved
[1:29:30] nothing under the table
[1:29:32] no Shady thing done but God ordains her
[1:29:36] to this position she's destined to be
[1:29:39] the queen
[1:29:41] but the only thing that she needs
[1:29:44] she needs the revelation
[1:29:47] this is my message today
[1:29:49] she needs the revelation of what God has
[1:29:52] predestinated her to be and has destined
[1:29:55] her to become
[1:29:57] so he set the crown upon her now notice
[1:30:01] she's not a part of the Harem she's not
[1:30:03] just she's not another concubine
[1:30:06] he didn't make her a concubine he made
[1:30:08] her the queen She's Not Just Another
[1:30:10] church it's not just another age it's
[1:30:13] not just another people she's the
[1:30:15] elected Queen she's the choice of the
[1:30:18] king
[1:30:19] [Applause]
[1:30:21] somebody are to say man right there
[1:30:27] but there's somebody else
[1:30:29] in this age
[1:30:32] and his name is Haman
[1:30:35] and Haman
[1:30:37] he wants things done his way
[1:30:40] Haman had become
[1:30:42] elevated
[1:30:46] among the princes of the land
[1:30:48] he had one
[1:30:50] favor among them
[1:30:52] and Haman
[1:30:54] is a descendant of agac
[1:30:57] he's from the amalekites and the
[1:31:01] amalekats descended from the lineage of
[1:31:03] Esau whom God hated
[1:31:07] come on
[1:31:10] so remember it was agak that fought
[1:31:14] against Israel that Saul should have
[1:31:17] killed
[1:31:20] it was agag that come against the Jews
[1:31:23] and you'll remember in the scripture
[1:31:25] Israel actually captured the King by
[1:31:28] captured haygoch and the Bible said that
[1:31:30] whenever a God come before Samuel the
[1:31:33] Bible says that the king that Samuel
[1:31:36] took the sword and he hacked to Pieces
[1:31:39] agag their King in the presence of the
[1:31:42] Lord
[1:31:45] and Haman knows this
[1:31:48] I said Haman knows this
[1:31:50] Haman knows
[1:31:52] let me give you a shouting point
[1:31:55] Haman knows
[1:31:57] his whole lineage
[1:31:59] has been defeated by this people
[1:32:08] Heyman knows that the lineage of Israel
[1:32:11] has overcome the amalekites he had
[1:32:14] overcome his family his great great
[1:32:16] grandfather his
[1:32:18] great-great-great-grandfather they've
[1:32:19] overcome one one attack after another
[1:32:22] after another they defeated their
[1:32:24] malachites Moses defeated them just for
[1:32:27] defeating them steps and defeated every
[1:32:30] Son of God has been an a gag and a
[1:32:32] Malachi killer
[1:32:34] the whole lineage of Israel had one
[1:32:37] Overcomer after another there's a
[1:32:39] lineage a lineage of conquerors
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:47] and Haman knows this
[1:32:49] so Haman
[1:32:50] he wants to do something about this and
[1:32:53] he hates Mordecai
[1:32:55] can I say that and again he don't like
[1:32:57] Mordecai Mordecai refuses to stroke his
[1:33:01] ego
[1:33:02] come on Church
[1:33:03] Mordecai refuses to bow down before him
[1:33:07] and here Haman has become elevated in
[1:33:10] this Kingdom
[1:33:12] he thinks he's the bomb.com
[1:33:18] so Haman says I know what I'm going to
[1:33:19] do
[1:33:21] I'm on a hatch out a plan
[1:33:23] and I'm going to make brother random I
[1:33:25] mean Mordecai
[1:33:26] look as bad as I can
[1:33:29] I'm going to try to get people to lose
[1:33:32] confidence in him I'm going to try to
[1:33:34] get people to quit following his message
[1:33:36] I'm going to kill his everything that I
[1:33:39] can do I'm going to try to kill his
[1:33:40] influence I'm going to start websites I
[1:33:43] want to produce you two videos I'm going
[1:33:45] to Tweet some tweets I'm going to grab
[1:33:47] some grams I'm going to take the talk
[1:33:51] come on young people I want to snap I
[1:33:54] want to chat I want to snitch I'm going
[1:33:56] to be real I'm going to sow some
[1:33:58] discords
[1:34:04] the fossils in the room what's he
[1:34:06] talking about
[1:34:10] I'm going to try to get everybody I can
[1:34:12] to lose confidence in this message
[1:34:15] so he wants to be elevated he wants to
[1:34:18] be lifted he wants to be hiring in order
[1:34:21] to do that he's got to bring Mordecai
[1:34:23] down so he can step on him to go higher
[1:34:26] so he brings this plan before the king
[1:34:28] and let me say this he tells the king
[1:34:30] how terrible these people are
[1:34:33] so here is the accuser of the brethren
[1:34:39] telling the king how awful you are how
[1:34:43] many mistakes you make how many
[1:34:44] shortcomings that you preach somebody
[1:34:47] so he brings accusation after accusation
[1:34:50] look at this Haman is used and deception
[1:34:53] haman's using the law and whenever he
[1:34:56] did the king instituted the law
[1:35:00] and it's the law that's been instituted
[1:35:03] and the King says well if they're trying
[1:35:05] to overthrow my kingdom
[1:35:07] but what Haman doesn't know is when he
[1:35:10] hatches this plan out and this law oh
[1:35:13] can I say it this law of sin and death
[1:35:15] comes into effect
[1:35:18] that every Jew is going to die on a
[1:35:20] certain day
[1:35:22] but what that devil don't know is this
[1:35:28] there's a mystery
[1:35:30] I said there's a mystery that's been
[1:35:33] abiding among them there's a mystery
[1:35:35] she's been hidden back for a long time
[1:35:37] she's been pulled back for a long time
[1:35:40] but the hour of silence is over the hour
[1:35:43] of sitting back is done the hour just
[1:35:45] watching and spectating that hour is
[1:35:47] done it's time for the bride it's time
[1:35:49] for the queen it's time for Esther to
[1:35:52] come to her place come to her position
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:59] you see Mordecai
[1:36:02] told her to keep a secret
[1:36:04] so
[1:36:05] Esther is the mystery of the hour
[1:36:10] lineage is a mystery her seed line is a
[1:36:14] mystery
[1:36:15] oh where'd she come from is a mystery
[1:36:18] where she's going is a mystery but it's
[1:36:22] come time for every mystery that's going
[1:36:25] to be finished in this day
[1:36:28] [Applause]
[1:36:30] now when a king makes a decree he cannot
[1:36:34] change his word
[1:36:35] is that right he cannot change his mind
[1:36:38] about his word
[1:36:40] so when the king makes a law that law
[1:36:43] cannot be altered that law cannot be
[1:36:45] changed that law cannot just be an old
[1:36:47] it must come to pass exactly the way the
[1:36:49] king said it
[1:36:51] let the mystery come for us
[1:36:54] and Mordecai hears what Haman has done
[1:36:57] and he knows that Haman has used
[1:37:01] deception against the people of God and
[1:37:04] now there's been a law that's been
[1:37:05] instituted do you see the top today the
[1:37:08] what the devil do in the garden slipped
[1:37:10] underneath the garden gate and when he
[1:37:11] did he used deception against God's
[1:37:14] people and whenever they fail the law
[1:37:16] was instituted the law a sin and death
[1:37:19] was instituted the days there are that
[1:37:22] day thou shall surely
[1:37:25] and God can't take that promise back
[1:37:29] so Mordecai
[1:37:31] against the fast before God because he
[1:37:33] knows something's got to happen if
[1:37:36] something don't take place
[1:37:37] these people are going to perish
[1:37:41] Now esther
[1:37:43] hadn't been before the king
[1:37:45] some 30 days
[1:37:48] so she's uh
[1:37:50] she's been sealed away
[1:37:53] she's been sealed away
[1:37:55] so Mordecai
[1:37:57] begins to send Esther message
[1:38:01] after message
[1:38:03] he sent her some letters he sent her
[1:38:06] some books he sent her some tapes he
[1:38:08] sent her some CDs he sent her some MP3s
[1:38:11] Oh my he sends her letters letters like
[1:38:14] recognizing your day and this message
[1:38:17] letters like the invisible Union of the
[1:38:20] bride of Christ message is like cross
[1:38:22] the mystery of God reveal the seed is
[1:38:25] not there with the shark modern events
[1:38:29] be made clear by prophecy
[1:38:33] Hallelujah he's telling her as she reads
[1:38:37] these letters Esther it's manifesting
[1:38:40] time
[1:38:41] it's seek time it's bright time it's
[1:38:44] lifetime Esther this is what you've got
[1:38:46] to do you've got to approach the king
[1:38:48] Esther
[1:38:51] you got to do something you must take
[1:38:53] your stand you've got to do your part
[1:38:56] you've got to come to your position you
[1:38:58] cannot just sit around you've got
[1:39:00] something to do around this message
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:05] the Bible says if thou all together Hold
[1:39:09] Us thy peace at this time then shall a
[1:39:12] large be delivered to rise from using
[1:39:13] another place but you your father's
[1:39:15] house you're going to be destroyed and
[1:39:17] who knoweth
[1:39:19] whether Thou Art come to the kingdom
[1:39:22] for such a time as this
[1:39:24] I love the way the Amplified says it
[1:39:26] listen to this
[1:39:28] if you keep silent
[1:39:34] at this time
[1:39:38] so the days of Silence has come and gone
[1:39:46] it's time that she finds her voice
[1:39:49] it's time that she finds her place it
[1:39:52] fine she finds her position in the
[1:39:54] Kingdom that she's been elected to
[1:39:57] if you keep silence at your time or
[1:39:59] literature shall come arise from Jews
[1:40:01] elsewhere but you your father's house
[1:40:02] will perish and who knows listen who
[1:40:05] knows that you've come to the kingdom
[1:40:07] hmm
[1:40:08] for such a time as this
[1:40:10] for this
[1:40:14] for this
[1:40:15] very occasional in other words this is
[1:40:19] why you're here this is what you've been
[1:40:21] called to do this listen that's what
[1:40:24] this word has been doing Among Us the
[1:40:27] prophet of God has been honing the mind
[1:40:29] of Esther to let her know she had
[1:40:31] something that she has to do and I want
[1:40:33] to tell you you're not safe just being
[1:40:35] around the message
[1:40:36] you're not safe just going to a message
[1:40:38] Church you're not safe just sitting on a
[1:40:40] message for you it's not safe just to
[1:40:42] have 1100 servants you've been called
[1:40:44] into this word to do something we've
[1:40:46] been called to intercede we've been
[1:40:49] called to stand for the message and
[1:40:51] stand for our god-given rights
[1:40:59] the purpose of your existence is for
[1:41:01] this moment God puts you here in this
[1:41:04] spot and this hour this is your
[1:41:07] opportunity this is your Divine
[1:41:09] appointment my almighty God he elected
[1:41:11] you to be in this day at this time at
[1:41:14] this hour for this very occasion
[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:20] has brother Brown moved
[1:41:22] from the first pool
[1:41:24] to the second pool
[1:41:26] he was building to this moment of the
[1:41:29] word and the last part of his ministry
[1:41:31] was announced to the elected lady who
[1:41:35] she is and what she's been called to do
[1:41:37] and what she's called to fulfill listen
[1:41:39] the third pull is the time of
[1:41:41] recognition among the elect
[1:41:43] that's why the mighty Angel come down
[1:41:45] that's why he come now he come down
[1:41:47] looking for his body he come down
[1:41:49] looking for his Queen listen he's come
[1:41:52] to announce the position of the queen
[1:41:54] Among Us
[1:41:57] that's why the book has come open that's
[1:41:59] why seven Thunders has uttered their
[1:42:02] voices look friends Mordecai done his
[1:42:05] part Luther done his part Wesley done
[1:42:08] his part but Ram's done his part and now
[1:42:11] you got to do your part
[1:42:16] she will be a modern event that's being
[1:42:19] made clear by prophecy by prophetics in
[1:42:23] other words the scripture has been
[1:42:25] pointing to this time every shadow from
[1:42:28] the Old Testament but remember said the
[1:42:30] shadows and the times they're coming to
[1:42:32] light in the day that we're living in
[1:42:33] now and I want to say this this is the
[1:42:35] day every age has been waiting for this
[1:42:38] is the age that every person has been
[1:42:40] waiting for and you've got the privilege
[1:42:42] to be alive and remade and this day
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:47] you're going to carry the work you're
[1:42:49] gonna pack the word you're going to
[1:42:51] carry the king
[1:42:52] [Applause]
[1:42:57] destined to fulfill this part you
[1:43:00] believe that what time is it then Throne
[1:43:02] Room time
[1:43:04] I said it's Intervale time
[1:43:06] she cannot just remain on the outside
[1:43:09] but according to the word she's got to
[1:43:11] go into the presence of the king she's
[1:43:13] going to walk where no other person
[1:43:15] would be allowed to walk why it would be
[1:43:17] debt to approach the king and announce
[1:43:19] but I want to say this she's not just
[1:43:21] any person in the Kingdom She's Not Just
[1:43:23] Another Woman She's elected she's the
[1:43:25] king's Queen
[1:43:26] [Applause]
[1:43:29] God's been building this
[1:43:31] elected Church down to the ages
[1:43:34] and he started the feet he's been coming
[1:43:35] ahead and now he's coming to the climax
[1:43:38] which is the finishing of the church and
[1:43:41] so much that The Headstone has descended
[1:43:43] down and this hour to cap off the pride
[1:43:46] in the end time well I'm going to tell
[1:43:47] you we're not living at the bottom of
[1:43:49] this pyramid
[1:43:52] you believe this don't you we're not
[1:43:54] living at the bottom of the pyramid
[1:43:55] we're living in the closing moments The
[1:43:58] Headstone has come and it's not coming
[1:44:00] crying law it's not cried law it's come
[1:44:03] crying Grace Grace why for this occasion
[1:44:07] for such a time is this
[1:44:09] [Applause]
[1:44:11] Esther's taking these words in
[1:44:13] something's happening to her
[1:44:15] she starts running with a message
[1:44:17] Hallelujah she starts crying Grace
[1:44:22] do you realize
[1:44:25] that the Book of Esther
[1:44:27] is one of the most debated books in the
[1:44:30] Old Testament
[1:44:31] do you realize many theologians
[1:44:34] they debate because they say that Esther
[1:44:36] the Book of Esther don't even belong in
[1:44:39] the Bible
[1:44:41] they say that the Book of Esther has no
[1:44:44] value to it
[1:44:46] because it never mentions the name of
[1:44:48] God it never mentions Jehovah it never
[1:44:51] mentions his name never he'll compound
[1:44:53] that it only mentions fasting and prayer
[1:44:57] but I want to tell you
[1:44:59] theologians may not see a value in it
[1:45:03] theologians may have not seen the
[1:45:05] mystery of it but I want to tell you in
[1:45:07] the eyes of God this book has value to
[1:45:10] it that's what they say about us that
[1:45:12] we're not a real church we don't have a
[1:45:14] headquarters we don't belong to
[1:45:15] denomination we don't got no right but I
[1:45:17] want to tell you in the eyes of God
[1:45:19] you've got some value in the eyes of
[1:45:21] almighty God you're not just another
[1:45:23] people but God loves you and God has
[1:45:25] elected you and God has called you for
[1:45:28] such a time as this for this very
[1:45:30] occasion
[1:45:37] do you realize
[1:45:39] even the placing of the Book of Esther
[1:45:42] it's placed in the Bible in a perfect
[1:45:45] spot
[1:45:47] it is
[1:45:49] because
[1:45:50] it's right after the book of Nehemiah
[1:45:53] and it's right before the Book of Job
[1:45:56] and Nehemiah come on somebody
[1:45:59] Nehemiah represents the Jews going back
[1:46:02] to their Homeland and the Book of Job
[1:46:05] represents the resurrection so after the
[1:46:07] Jews go back to their Homeland and just
[1:46:10] before the resurrection here's a queen
[1:46:12] Hallelujah here's a queen that's coming
[1:46:14] to her place here's a queen that's
[1:46:16] coming to her position after the Jews
[1:46:18] has went back and just before the
[1:46:20] resurrection here's a bride recognizing
[1:46:23] who she is for such a time as this she's
[1:46:26] seeing our place why is the word of God
[1:46:28] just before the resurrection here's you
[1:46:31] and I coming under our Capstone Ministry
[1:46:33] Congress
[1:46:41] thank you
[1:46:47] bortock has been sending these letters
[1:46:49] to these servants
[1:46:52] for quite some time now
[1:46:55] and the scripture says
[1:46:57] listen
[1:47:00] she says and the King servants and the
[1:47:02] people the king's Providence know
[1:47:04] whether it's a man or woman comes into
[1:47:06] the king into the inner Court
[1:47:08] who's not called
[1:47:11] so if you're not called
[1:47:13] you ain't got no rights in there
[1:47:17] and there is one law of his
[1:47:20] that's to put him to death
[1:47:23] except
[1:47:24] Hallelujah I feel like preaching a
[1:47:27] breach right now
[1:47:28] except
[1:47:30] except God throws a breach in
[1:47:32] except such to whom the king
[1:47:35] would hold out his golden scepter that
[1:47:38] he may live
[1:47:41] but I've not been called to come into
[1:47:42] His presence now for these 30 days so
[1:47:45] the law is in effect
[1:47:46] are you hear me the law of sin and death
[1:47:50] is still an effect
[1:47:53] the law bound her and tried to limit her
[1:47:57] from approaching the king so the law of
[1:48:00] synonym it kept her listen it kept her
[1:48:03] out of his presence come on somebody
[1:48:06] I said it was death to go behind that
[1:48:08] inner Veil but the message said he was
[1:48:11] born for this purpose the message says
[1:48:14] you was born for this you're destined to
[1:48:16] do this look what he's doing he's
[1:48:18] telling you you are not just anybody
[1:48:20] you're called to go into his presence

[1:48:29] side of the king you think you're in
[1:48:30] this building by chance you think you're
[1:48:32] in this meeting by chance you think you
[1:48:34] come to this message by accident you are
[1:48:36] here in this day for this purpose to
[1:48:39] escape death you are here to go behind
[1:48:41] the Intervale you were here to be the
[1:48:43] word of God made flesh in this day
[1:48:49] that's the reason we refuse to give the
[1:48:50] devil our children we're not giving him
[1:48:52] our young people we're not giving him
[1:48:54] our family I'd stand on my god-given
[1:48:57] rights and intercede in this hour safety
[1:48:59] take your hands over God's Property
[1:49:07] you should never give up on your
[1:49:09] children I don't care what they've done
[1:49:10] I don't care where they're at I don't
[1:49:12] care what Barstool they're on how much
[1:49:14] they're hung up on drugs never never
[1:49:16] give up on your rights as a mother as a
[1:49:20] father as a Son of God claim your
[1:49:22] god-given rocks
[1:49:31] something happens to this woman
[1:49:34] she becomes awakened
[1:49:36] she's been shook by the word
[1:49:39] and all of a sudden the word catches
[1:49:41] hold
[1:49:43] now she's going to put the word into
[1:49:45] action
[1:49:46] not just quote it
[1:49:48] not just tabletop books not something
[1:49:50] left on a bookshelf not something else
[1:49:52] to draw dust let me put this word into
[1:49:55] action
[1:49:58] she what's her what's her come to go
[1:50:01] before he's telling her he's telling her
[1:50:03] and now she finds her voice
[1:50:05] and he says she says go gather together
[1:50:08] Jews that are present fast for me
[1:50:10] neither need or drink through three days
[1:50:11] and I my Mains will fast like lies and
[1:50:13] I'm going to go into the king which is
[1:50:16] not according to the law
[1:50:19] if I perish
[1:50:21] if I perish let me perish if I die let
[1:50:25] me die in the army of the Lord if I burn
[1:50:27] all friends if I go down let me go down
[1:50:30] proclaiming the message of the king if
[1:50:32] that's the way we go show me it but if
[1:50:34] I'm going to go down I'm going down
[1:50:36] underneath the word of God for this day
[1:50:40] this third Paul is nothing to play with
[1:50:43] it's serious it's life or death
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:49] the only thing that could save her
[1:50:54] is if the king
[1:50:55] takes a scepter
[1:50:58] his golden scepter
[1:51:00] and he extends it to her
[1:51:03] so she needed something
[1:51:05] between her and the King
[1:51:11] in order to go into his presence without
[1:51:14] death taking her over she needed to go
[1:51:16] between she needed a mediator she needed
[1:51:19] the scepter which is Jesus Christ he's a
[1:51:22] mediator between the two
[1:51:24] he went between a king who was obligated
[1:51:27] to destroy us because of his claw here
[1:51:30] is a queen whom he loved and the only
[1:51:32] way to save her is she must have a
[1:51:34] go-between
[1:51:38] and that's what Jesus Christ did for you
[1:51:40] and I he stepped between us and the law
[1:51:43] I said he stands between you and the law
[1:51:46] think about Jesus was our goal between
[1:51:49] he was our mediator that stands between
[1:51:51] you and the god look at it here he is
[1:51:53] standing there
[1:51:55] look at that scepter
[1:51:57] the scepter
[1:51:59] was a rod with a symbol on the top of it
[1:52:03] the scepter
[1:52:05] was common wood
[1:52:08] I said common word but overlaid with
[1:52:11] gold
[1:52:12] common wood overlaid with deity that's
[1:52:16] my savior that's my king he was coming
[1:52:19] flesh and ball born like you and I but
[1:52:22] the difference is he's overlaid with
[1:52:24] deity
[1:52:25] [Applause]
[1:52:29] let me hurry
[1:52:31] I can imagine she's coming down through
[1:52:33] the courts
[1:52:35] the guard standing outside the door
[1:52:37] they're ready to cut her down
[1:52:40] they're there to kill her
[1:52:42] she comes if I die I die no doubt no
[1:52:46] doubt she's rehearsing I'm called for
[1:52:48] this
[1:52:48] I'm anointed for this I'm chosen for
[1:52:51] this one footprint after another one
[1:52:53] step after another I'm called for this
[1:52:55] I'm ordained for this she goes to
[1:52:57] quoting that message she goes to quoting
[1:52:59] her position what is it she knows who
[1:53:01] she is
[1:53:05] and whenever the doors open up
[1:53:08] steps inside
[1:53:10] the law
[1:53:12] the law wants to cut her down
[1:53:15] but the king
[1:53:17] extended cross
[1:53:23] Hallelujah he extended the scepter she
[1:53:26] comes before the king and she touches
[1:53:29] the head of that staff I said she
[1:53:31] touched the head of that Kingdom all
[1:53:33] just like the worshiper in the Old
[1:53:34] Testament we're taking laya's hands upon
[1:53:36] the head of that laugh here she is
[1:53:37] laying her hands up on the head I think
[1:53:39] came down and by doing that the law had
[1:53:42] no effect upon Esther
[1:53:49] and I'm going to say this not only is
[1:53:52] she standing there
[1:53:53] she's gotta find her voice she's got a
[1:53:56] right to articulate words she's got a
[1:53:59] right to say something or you hearing me
[1:54:01] what can she do she can cry out to the
[1:54:03] king oh King I got a need oh Haman has
[1:54:06] done this and the devil's done that and
[1:54:08] the enemy's trying to do this and he's
[1:54:09] trying to rob this but I'm coming before
[1:54:11] the king
[1:54:13] [Applause]
[1:54:16] and the Bible says
[1:54:18] it came to pass on the third day
[1:54:21] that Esther
[1:54:23] put on
[1:54:24] her royal apparel
[1:54:26] she ain't coming in
[1:54:28] dressed with the rags of her own ideas
[1:54:31] but she's wearing the gifts that the
[1:54:33] king Giver she's wearing what pleases
[1:54:36] the king she knows it's got his
[1:54:38] attention it's found favor she goes
[1:54:40] because she's been dressed right
[1:54:44] I love it because the king sees her
[1:54:49] he says Esther what do you want
[1:54:51] I'll give whatever you want whatever you
[1:54:53] ask him whatever you want say it
[1:54:55] whatever you ask in my name it'll be
[1:54:57] given
[1:54:59] she said O King
[1:55:02] Haman
[1:55:04] there he is I want you to look
[1:55:08] who's pulling the veil off of the enemy
[1:55:11] in the last days
[1:55:13] Haman has come against my family Haman
[1:55:17] has come against my church Haman has
[1:55:20] come against my loved ones Haman through
[1:55:22] deception and lie that he's going to
[1:55:24] kill every person that he cans
[1:55:27] and the King says but Esther
[1:55:29] you know once I make a decree I can't
[1:55:31] change my word it's my old it's my word
[1:55:34] it's my decree and I can't change it
[1:55:38] and the King says but let me tell you
[1:55:39] what I'll do
[1:55:40] I can't undo my word
[1:55:43] but I'll make a new testament a new
[1:55:44] covenant
[1:55:48] I said I'll make a higher law I'll make
[1:55:50] a higher order I'll make a new testament
[1:55:53] I'll make a new decree that the day
[1:55:55] before you are to be killed every Jew
[1:55:58] that knows that his enemy is going to
[1:56:00] kill him the day before he can slay his
[1:56:02] enemy before they slay him and may I
[1:56:05] tell you because the veil has come off
[1:56:08] of the enemy you've got a right to cast
[1:56:10] out that in before he takes you before
[1:56:13] he comes against you you've got a right
[1:56:15] to tear the veil off of that enemy and
[1:56:18] take your god-diven rights and slay your
[1:56:21] enemies
[1:56:26] thank you
[1:56:28] the hard word has to know the death
[1:56:32] sentence off of your life
[1:56:34] Hallelujah let me say this Jesus Christ
[1:56:37] under this New Covenant has took your
[1:56:40] sins and your iniquity and he nailed him
[1:56:42] to the tree
[1:56:45] and now you're a new creation old things
[1:56:48] are passed away behold all things has
[1:56:51] become new
[1:56:53] the Judgment seat
[1:56:55] was your mercy seat
[1:57:02] the king
[1:57:06] the king took this assault
[1:57:09] as though it was assault against himself
[1:57:12] anybody hear me right there
[1:57:14] I said he took his assault that he was
[1:57:17] going to Haman was going to try to
[1:57:18] destroy Esther he took it as though he's
[1:57:21] trying to destroy me
[1:57:23] and Haman got hung on The Gallows
[1:57:27] that he had prepared for Mordecai
[1:57:31] and may I tell you
[1:57:34] that Satan has been trying to ascend
[1:57:37] to the highest place he can get
[1:57:40] but who stops the final Ascension
[1:57:44] a queen
[1:57:45] a queen coming to her place stopped
[1:57:49] Satan from he listen she stops his plan
[1:57:52] did in the tracks I want to tell you
[1:57:54] we're the people that stop Satan in this
[1:57:57] hour you're the people that puts him
[1:57:59] under your feet in this day
[1:58:07] so our musicians come
[1:58:10] Hallelujah
[1:58:11] stand your feet with us if you hurt
[1:58:13] you realize
[1:58:16] every year
[1:58:18] the Jews hold a feast of pure
[1:58:22] and the word Purim comes from the word
[1:58:24] Lots it means it's a feast of lots
[1:58:28] and the Feast of lots
[1:58:30] it's a time of Celebration
[1:58:33] it's a time of rejoicing
[1:58:35] the Jews hold this Feast to remind the
[1:58:39] people what has been done to him
[1:58:43] somebody help me right now I said they
[1:58:47] must be reminded they've got to be
[1:58:49] reminded that Haman has no authority
[1:58:51] over them they like to be reminded that
[1:58:54] Haman has been murdered he has been
[1:58:56] killed he has been hung and he cannot
[1:58:59] touch you no more he cannot come against
[1:59:01] you no more so they hold a feast to
[1:59:03] remind them that Haman has lost his
[1:59:05] rights
[1:59:08] it's a time of Celebration it's a time
[1:59:11] to rejoice
[1:59:15] I said let's have a little Feast right
[1:59:17] now
[1:59:22] during the Feast of pyramid they take
[1:59:24] and they make pastries and all types of
[1:59:26] food they make pastries in pyramid
[1:59:28] shapes
[1:59:32] and it's during that time of the feast I
[1:59:35] said it's during that time of the
[1:59:36] celebration
[1:59:38] they took the Book of Esther the Book of
[1:59:41] Esther is called the scroll
[1:59:45] and they take the scroll
[1:59:47] and they wait till the evening time
[1:59:50] to open
[1:59:52] the scroll
[1:59:55] Hallelujah
[1:59:57] and in the evening time they opened the
[1:59:59] scroll and when the book comes open they
[2:00:02] begin to celebrate because the books
[2:00:05] come open
[2:00:09] they don't listen friends the open book
[2:00:12] in Esther the
[2:00:14] Rejoice they begin to celebrate because
[2:00:17] they know they not the mystery the book
[2:00:19] has been revealed the mystery of Esther
[2:00:23] has been unveiled they know that Haman
[2:00:26] is going to come against us but they
[2:00:27] know what his end is
[2:00:34] so in the evening time they opened the
[2:00:36] book and they begin to read from the
[2:00:38] open book
[2:00:40] Hallelujah and as I read from the book
[2:00:43] what they do is
[2:00:45] they take chalk
[2:00:47] and they write the name Haman
[2:00:49] on the bottom of their shoes
[2:00:56] and every time in the book of The Scroll
[2:00:59] that haman's name is mentioned the
[2:01:02] people begin to celebrate and they begin
[2:01:04] to stuff their feet they begin to stop
[2:01:07] there they don't see it they participate

[2:01:12] stomp their feet every time the name of
[2:01:15] Haman is mentioned they begin to stomp
[2:01:17] their feet I say today there are going

[2:18:02] that I saw his face his love captured me
[2:18:08] foreign
[2:18:35] [Music]

[2:18:50] thank you
[2:18:54] [Music]
[2:19:34] thank you
[2:20:05] foreign
[2:20:10] your kids
[2:20:12] well guess what
[2:20:13] God said I'm coming for you kids
[2:20:16] there's a God movement
[2:20:18] there's a bride movement every movement
[2:20:20] the world comes up with every move will
[2:20:22] never stop the move of the Bride will
[2:20:24] never stop bringing your kids up here to
[2:20:26] get baptized
[2:20:29] so as he was saying last night you claim
[2:20:31] your kids
[2:20:32] you give them to God like there's comes
[2:20:35] to a point they make that choice she's
[2:20:37] made that choice
[2:20:38] she told me last night she wanted to get
[2:20:40] baptized because she wanted God to have
[2:20:41] control of her life
[2:20:43] so well just as we baptize her just
[2:20:46] we're going to pray over and believe and
[2:20:48] believe that God take control of our
[2:20:49] life we all need that we all need your
[2:20:52] Humanity your humanity is is what what
[2:20:56] as we've seen it needs to be setting
[2:20:57] sins of your Humanity God takes control
[2:20:59] of your life
[2:21:01] it's as simple as that how do you young
[2:21:04] man ask me last night how do I know I
[2:21:05] got the Holy Ghost I went to the prayer
[2:21:07] line
[2:21:08] I told him I said Satan was waiting the
[2:21:09] very end of that prayer line when you
[2:21:11] come out he's sitting there telling you
[2:21:13] you didn't get it
[2:21:14] tell him you didn't get healed
[2:21:19] if he Satan is a liar so if he's talking
[2:21:21] to you he's probably not telling the
[2:21:23] truth
[2:21:24] so let's pray over our sister
[2:21:27] Heavenly Father
[2:21:28] Lord what a wonderful beautiful thing
[2:21:31] Lord
[2:21:32] when a member of the Bride finds her
[2:21:34] place
[2:21:35] When Heaven reached down and touches his
[2:21:37] soul and places her in the body where
[2:21:40] she's supposed to be Lord getting us
[2:21:42] ready for the last one she might be the
[2:21:44] last one Lord how glorious that would be
[2:21:47] but Lord we're praying and believing
[2:21:48] father Lord as their name is Phoenix
[2:21:50] Lord What a Wonderful Name Lord if she
[2:21:54] could rise up out of the ashes of
[2:21:55] humanity
[2:21:57] Lord and take on the fire of Heaven Lord
[2:21:59] as she Rises and finds her place as a
[2:22:01] daughter of God
[2:22:03] I know and believe with all my hearts
[2:22:05] you're going to do that for Lord we're
[2:22:06] all believing that for Lord and she
[2:22:08] comes out May she seek the Holy Ghost
[2:22:09] Lord and it's a free gift Lord she don't
[2:22:12] have to beg for it she don't have to
[2:22:13] plead for it you said it's a free gift
[2:22:15] it's freely given
[2:22:16] I pray that you would touch my sister as
[2:22:18] we baptize her like before or Phoenix
[2:22:21] as commissioned by the word I baptize
[2:22:23] you in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:22:47] thank you Lord
[2:22:49] so so appreciate you being here this
[2:22:51] weekend with us you have honored us to
[2:22:54] come
[2:22:55] we've got a couple more praise the Lord
[2:23:04] this is a little Maca priest
[2:23:07] he wants to we had a little talk while
[2:23:09] ago and he understands just like his
[2:23:11] daddy when he gives his life to to God
[2:23:14] when this is a symbolism of going down a
[2:23:17] bad boy and coming up a good boy that's
[2:23:19] how he understands it so God reveals it
[2:23:21] to us in simpler ways than than others
[2:23:24] so let's let's pray over the Micah
[2:23:25] Heavenly Father
[2:23:27] Lord the tender heart of the child
[2:23:30] Lord that's what we all need when you
[2:23:32] speak to us Lord and we receive you as
[2:23:34] children of God and over us that's what
[2:23:36] he's come to do Lord is is I pray Lord
[2:23:39] she would reveal to his heart and his
[2:23:40] soul lord the understanding of the
[2:23:42] symbolism father of the death burial and
[2:23:43] the resurrection
[2:23:45] Lord I pray that you would lead him in
[2:23:46] guiding father may you live his life for
[2:23:48] you may he give you everything he has
[2:23:50] Lord Jesus not thank you for it in Jesus

[2:24:31] last name Mr brother Keith
[2:24:33] and he wants to
[2:24:34] give his life to God he wants to be
[2:24:36] baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost

[2:24:39] Heavenly Father
[2:24:41] Lord's our brother comes to baptism Lord
[2:24:44] he wants to start a journey afresh with
[2:24:46] you he wants to Leave the World Behind
[2:24:48] he wants to give you everything that he
[2:24:49] is Lord that's what we have to do Lord
[2:24:52] if we want the Holy Ghost we have to be
[2:24:53] able to sell out everything that we have
[2:24:56] to get it anything that stands between
[2:24:58] us and the Holy Ghost Lord we've got to
[2:25:01] get rid of it I pray father that you
[2:25:02] would bless my brother Lord but nothing
[2:25:04] stand between you and him as we baptize
[2:25:06] him there this morning Father was he
[2:25:08] come up Lord would you fill him with the
[2:25:10] Holy Ghost or believe in you for in
