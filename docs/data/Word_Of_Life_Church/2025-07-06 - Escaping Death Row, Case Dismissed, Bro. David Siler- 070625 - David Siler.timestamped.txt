[2:47] Hey.
[2:50] [Music]
[2:55] Hey. Hey.
[2:58] [Music]

[7:05] [Music]
[9:00] What happened?
[9:02] [Music]
[9:47] When it seemed I stood alone
[9:51] through the heartache and frustration,
[9:55] kept my focus on the throne.
[9:59] So many times I have recalled the
[10:04] Savior's word so true.
[10:07] If you won't be ashamed of me, I won't
[10:13] be of you. So I proudly
[10:17] stand until I see
[10:23] the face of the one who gave
[10:27] everything.
[10:32] And the reason that I'm saying
[10:37] standing from me,
[10:41] every battle that I will make from the
[10:46] ring.
[10:50] I'll bow before his mighty throne.
[10:53] Hallelujah. I can fall down on my knees.
[10:58] Oh, with a reason I'm standing
[11:03] [Music]
[11:06] standing in front of me.
[11:12] [Music]
[11:15] The road has not been easy. I'll sing it
[11:18] to you, church. At times I've lost my
[11:21] way. So often I stumble
[11:26] searching for the light of day.
[11:30] Circumstances all around me. I thought
[11:34] I'd surely fall.
[11:37] When the whispering of doubt and fear
[11:41] told me you would lose it all. Thank
[11:44] you, Lord. But he kept
[11:47] us amazing grace.
[11:52] We're killed. Someday soon I'll have the
[11:55] chance to thank him face to face.
[12:02] And the reason that I'm standing
[12:06] stands in front of me.
[12:10] Every battle that I fought will fade
[12:14] from me.
[12:19] I bow before my Lord and fall down on my
[12:25] knees.
[12:27] Oh, the reason that standing
[12:34] stands in front of me.
[12:40] We will join the millions.
[12:43] Every kind return and raise.
[12:48] Every child of God that day will look
[12:51] upon his face.
[12:54] [Music]
[12:56] The heroes and the marters. We got all
[13:01] the pagans.
[13:06] We all sing together
[13:09] and declare.
[13:12] Jesus is Lord.
[13:18] Hallelujah.
[13:20] When the reason that I'm standing
[13:25] stands in front of me. Oh, what a day.
[13:28] Every battle that I fought it'll fade
[13:32] from memory.
[13:35] [Music]
[13:37] I bow before his mighty throne.
[13:42] down on my knees
[13:46] with the reason I'm standing
[13:52] standing in front of me.
[13:57] [Music]
[14:01] I'll bow before his mighty throne. Yes,
[14:04] we will. fall down on my knees.
[14:11] The reason that I stand
[14:17] in front of me
[14:23] when he stands in front. Oh, hallelujah.
[14:29] Thank you, Lord.
[14:31] Give him a good hand of praise if you
[14:33] love him.
[14:38] Praise the Lord.
[14:40] Amen. Ain't it good to be in church this

[15:02] tremendous job. We're so blessed to be

[39:59] his mercy to me.
[40:03] To Jerusalem
[40:05] our Lord went.
[40:08] Praises to him
[40:12] from the people who receive the Lord
[40:16] and they highly esteem.
[40:20] But the Pharisees that gatherred round
[40:24] said, "Make them be still."
[40:29] But Jesus said, "The rocks will surely
[40:32] cry out, let them shout as they will."
[40:37] Why shouldn't I praise the Lord? He's
[40:41] been so good to me.
[40:45] The living word
[40:48] again
[40:51] to me.
[40:54] I was blind and I could not see till his
[40:59] message found me.
[41:03] And I love to praise the Lord for all
[41:08] his mercies to me.
[41:11] [Music]
[41:13] [Applause]
[41:20] We shouldn't sit with our heads hung
[41:23] down.
[41:24] God is with us now. He's giving strength
[41:30] to the bride. He's saying
[41:33] since the true way she's found
[41:37] and the manifested sons of God this
[41:41] world surely will see.
[41:45] Then the rapture will take us away from
[41:49] death. The last enemy.
[41:54] Why should I praise the Lord?
[41:58] He's so good to me.
[42:02] The living word made flesh again
[42:07] and revealed to me.
[42:11] Oh, I was blind and I could not see till
[42:16] his message found me.
[42:20] And I rose up to praise the Lord for all
[42:25] his mercy to me.
[42:28] Oh, why shouldn't I praise the Lord?
[42:33] He's been so good to me.
[42:37] The living word in flesh again
[42:42] revealed to me.
[42:46] I was blinded.
[42:48] I not see till his message found me.
[42:55] I rose up to praise the Lord for all his
[43:00] mercy to me.
[43:03] So I rose up to praise the Lord for all
[43:08] his mercy to me.
[43:13] [Applause]
[43:13] [Music]
[43:15] [Applause]
[43:39] [Music]
[43:56] Hallelujah.
[43:57] God bless you all.
[44:00] Amen.
[44:02] I left my loan
[44:05] at Calvary.
[44:08] Well, Jesus died
[44:11] for you and me.
[44:15] And then there came
[44:18] a peace so sweet.
[44:21] When I left my load of sin at Jesus
[44:25] feet,
[44:27] I left my Lord. Yes, I did. at Calvary.
[44:34] Well, Jesus died
[44:37] for you and me.
[44:40] And then the king

[45:08] will tell the story
[45:11] how we overcome.
[45:14] For we'll understand it better by and
[45:18] by.

[45:24] of the things our life demand. Why but
[45:28] one of shelter helps to heal and better
[45:32] land that we stand in the Lord and
[45:37] according to his word. Well, we'll

[57:12] Thank you Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord.
[57:15] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[57:19] Hallelujah.
[57:21] We worship you, Lord Jesus.
[57:24] Or can we just take a minute and raise
[57:25] our hand in his presence. Oh, glory to
[57:27] God.
[57:29] Thank you, Father. Thank you, Father. We
[57:31] magnify your name today, Lord.
[57:35] Hallelujah. Lord, it's not a name that
[57:37] we just religiously repeat. It is the
[57:40] name of our bridegroom. Hallelujah. Not
[57:43] only your name but our name. We are
[57:46] called after your name, Miss Jesus
[57:49] Christ. We thank you today Lord. Praise
[57:53] the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[57:56] Hallelujah.
[57:58] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[58:01] Isn't it wonderful to be in his presence
[58:03] once again?
[58:05] Amen. Without any further delay, we'll
[58:08] just ask brother David to come and bring
[58:10] to us what's on his heart today.
[58:13] Such an honor for us to be together and
[58:14] such an honor for you to come and be
[58:16] here with us in these days that we've
[58:18] been able to enjoy his presence and
[58:20] fellowship with one another. God bless
[58:22] you, brother David. Just come, brother.
[58:34] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Praise
[58:36] the Lord. We just had some church. Amen.
[58:41] What do you call him?
[58:43] I call him encourager. I call him king.
[58:46] I call him father. I call him deliverer.
[58:50] I call him redeemer. He's the lifter of
[58:52] our head. Amen. He's a devil defeater.
[58:56] He defeats your sickness. He answers
[58:59] your true your your needs. Whatever you
[59:01] got need of, that's what he is today.
[59:04] Amen. Praise God. That's the kind of God
[59:06] we serve. Amen. and oh, don't you just
[59:08] love him with all of your heart, the
[59:10] things that he's done for us this
[59:12] weekend and just how that he's spoken to
[59:15] us. He is so mindful of his people. We
[59:18] want to say how honored we are to be
[59:20] here with you today. Uh certainly
[59:22] appreciate the opportunity to be able to
[59:24] come and stand before you and the
[59:26] invitation to be able to be a part of
[59:27] this meeting. Well, it's just the
[59:29] highlight of our life to be here. Amen.
[59:32] While you're standing, let's go to the
[59:33] book of Psalms 102:18.
[59:37] Psalms 102 verse18
[59:48] some services
[59:51] whenever we hear preaching is for
[59:54] healing, encouragement,
[59:57] faith, deliverance.
[1:00:00] But then there are some services that
[1:00:02] it's just correction.
[1:00:05] Well, unfortunately, that's what the
[1:00:07] service is going to be today.
[1:00:12] Can anybody handle that?
[1:00:16] Amen. Um, I don't make the rules. I just
[1:00:19] follow them.
[1:00:21] Um, now I'm not talking about being mean
[1:00:23] to somebody, but I'm talking about
[1:00:25] correction,
[1:00:27] the department of corrections.
[1:00:30] So, let's just take a little journey
[1:00:32] today. Amen. Psalms 102:18,
[1:00:36] this shall be written for the generation
[1:00:38] to come, the people which shall be
[1:00:42] created, hallelujah,
[1:00:46] shall praise the Lord.
[1:00:49] For he hath looked down from the height
[1:00:51] of his sanctuary.
[1:00:53] From heaven did the Lord behold the
[1:00:55] earth to hear the groaning of the
[1:00:59] prisoner
[1:01:01] and to loose those that are appointed to
[1:01:06] death. Amen. Amen.
[1:01:09] Romans 5:12.
[1:01:12] Wherefore, as by one man's sin,
[1:01:16] it entered into the world,
[1:01:19] and death came by sin.
[1:01:23] And so death passed upon all men, for
[1:01:28] that all. A ll for that all have sinned.
[1:01:35] Go over to Romans chapter 7 verse 23.
[1:01:38] We'll read verses 23 and verse 24.
[1:01:42] Paul said, 'I see another law in my
[1:01:44] members and it's waring against the law
[1:01:49] of my mind. So Paul sees a law in his
[1:01:52] flesh. He sees a and it's waring against
[1:01:55] this law that's in his mind and he said
[1:01:57] it's bringing me into captivity to the
[1:02:00] law of sin which is in my members. Look
[1:02:04] at this word captivity. It's bringing me
[1:02:07] into captivity or the state of period of
[1:02:11] being held. Imprisoned or confined in
[1:02:15] bondage, severitude, imprisonment,
[1:02:18] confinement. Look at this last word,
[1:02:21] incarceration.
[1:02:22] Paul said that there's a law that has
[1:02:24] taken place in me that is literally
[1:02:26] incarcerating me in my flesh. Verse 24,
[1:02:31] then Paul cries out and he says, watch
[1:02:33] this exclamation point. Oh wretched man
[1:02:36] that I am. Paul didn't say, "Oh wretched
[1:02:40] man that I was." Because when Paul's
[1:02:42] writing this, he's not writing it in an
[1:02:44] unconverted state. But Paul actually
[1:02:47] being born again is saying, "Oh wretched
[1:02:50] man that I am." Then he asked this
[1:02:53] question, "Who shall deliver me from the
[1:02:57] body of this death?" Look at this word
[1:03:01] deliver. It means emancipate,
[1:03:04] redeem, rescue. I like this one.
[1:03:08] Exonerate. Look at this word. Exonerate.
[1:03:11] Who will exonerate me? To clear from
[1:03:14] blame and accusation.
[1:03:16] To free from guilt, to release and
[1:03:20] discharge, to be free and liberated.
[1:03:25] I believe that we are a people today
[1:03:27] that are been exonerated and liberated.
[1:03:31] I'd like to speak to you today on that
[1:03:33] idea today. Escaping death row. May the
[1:03:38] Lord add his blessings to the word. You
[1:03:39] can be seated.
[1:03:55] I think this is incredible portion of
[1:03:57] scripture
[1:03:59] that Paul being aware that
[1:04:02] even though that he's come to the new
[1:04:04] birth and that Paul has actually been
[1:04:08] regenerated in his soul. We believe that
[1:04:11] whenever Paul writes the book of Romans
[1:04:14] and Paul comes down to Romans chapter 7,
[1:04:17] which is some of the most debated things
[1:04:19] that Paul wrote and many people whenever
[1:04:22] they look at that, they try to tell us
[1:04:24] that Paul was writing about the time
[1:04:26] when he was unconverted. But we don't
[1:04:28] believe that tonight because we don't
[1:04:31] believe that God will allow a man to be
[1:04:33] able to write the word that's in an
[1:04:35] unconverted state. But we believe that
[1:04:38] Paul having been born again knew that
[1:04:40] there was something that was going on in
[1:04:42] his flesh that Paul was aware that even
[1:04:46] though that he has been born again, Paul
[1:04:48] knew that he was still a prisoner. Paul
[1:04:51] knew that he was still locked up and has
[1:04:54] been incarcerated. But you know, if Paul
[1:04:57] has been locked up, we would want to
[1:05:00] know what has Paul done to deserve to be
[1:05:04] incarcerated. What has he done to
[1:05:06] deserve to be in prison? What did he do
[1:05:09] to be able to put in this place? What
[1:05:11] Paul would say in my members, I I'm
[1:05:13] warning against this law that is taking
[1:05:16] place. And no doubt Paul knew it every
[1:05:18] day that he woke up the same way that
[1:05:20] you do. That there's something in our
[1:05:22] flesh that is just not right. Now, we
[1:05:25] know there's people today that wants to
[1:05:27] tell us that we're already in the
[1:05:28] millennium and that the rapture's
[1:05:30] already come and the body change has
[1:05:32] already happened. But I don't believe
[1:05:34] that. And I'm sure many of you today
[1:05:36] don't believe that either. It's because
[1:05:38] even though we are born again, we're
[1:05:40] still living in a body of time. And we
[1:05:43] are trapped into this body and we are
[1:05:45] actually locked in this body because of
[1:05:48] time. That's what caused us to be here
[1:05:50] was the fall. And it actually injected
[1:05:53] us into time. Now, because Paul is in
[1:05:56] this place, Paul said that there's
[1:05:58] something going on in his body. Now
[1:06:00] whenever you look at incarceration and
[1:06:02] you look at people that has been put in
[1:06:05] prison, we know we hear the terminology
[1:06:07] that somebody committed such an act that
[1:06:09] it warranted them to be able to be, you
[1:06:12] know, held guilty to where they're put
[1:06:13] on death row. And we know the reason why
[1:06:16] any person would be subjected to such a
[1:06:19] thing is because there's come an accuser
[1:06:22] that a crime has been committed. And the
[1:06:25] prosecutor has told us that there's been
[1:06:27] a law that has been broken. And the
[1:06:30] prosecutor believes that there's
[1:06:32] sufficient amount of evidence to be able
[1:06:34] to bring against an individual and that
[1:06:37] accusation can be proved that that
[1:06:39] person has broke the law. Now we know
[1:06:42] that what that means is if there is
[1:06:44] enough evidence of what has been done
[1:06:47] that he can prove beyond all reasonable
[1:06:50] doubt that that individual is guilty of
[1:06:53] breaking the law. And in this case today
[1:06:56] the law that Paul is talking about is
[1:06:58] the law that was broken in Genesis
[1:07:00] chapter 2. For God said it like this in
[1:07:03] verse 16. And the Lord God commanded
[1:07:05] man, saying, "Of every tree of the
[1:07:08] garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of
[1:07:10] the tree of the knowledge of good and
[1:07:12] evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in
[1:07:15] the day that thou eatest thereof,
[1:07:16] therefore that thou shalt surely die."
[1:07:20] Now, we know that when God says this,
[1:07:22] this is God's word. It's God's law.
[1:07:25] Whenever God speaks, he cannot retract
[1:07:27] or take back that which he says. And
[1:07:30] whenever one takes and they breaks this
[1:07:32] this law of God, they break the word of
[1:07:34] God. God cannot simply overlook what man
[1:07:38] has done. Well, brother David, Adam was
[1:07:40] God's son. God cannot overlook sin. God
[1:07:44] cannot look past sin. He cannot push sin
[1:07:47] under the carpet somewhere because of
[1:07:49] favorability. And to be able to overlook
[1:07:52] it, God can't do that. God must be just
[1:07:55] in the way that he handles sin. And
[1:07:58] because man had broke the law of God,
[1:08:01] notice that now there's going to come a
[1:08:03] death sentence on man, that man is going
[1:08:06] to actually live to die. And the Bible
[1:08:09] said in verse 5, "And all the days that
[1:08:11] Adam lived were 930 years
[1:08:17] and Adam died."
[1:08:20] So God kept his word. God backed up his
[1:08:24] word. Amen. You may not say amen to that
[1:08:28] right now, but you're going to be glad
[1:08:30] that God backs up his word.
[1:08:33] Because of the fall, God caused man to
[1:08:36] come under such a judgment that they
[1:08:39] actually pulled God. Think about this.
[1:08:42] They actually pulled God to the place
[1:08:44] where he was loving father that would
[1:08:46] come down and visit. Oh, I can imagine
[1:08:49] how great the atmosphere must have been.
[1:08:52] But now they pull God into a different
[1:08:54] attribute that God has to come down and
[1:08:58] bring judgment upon his children. So
[1:09:01] they actually forced God to come into a
[1:09:04] place of judgment. And the results of
[1:09:06] that law being broke, it brought death.
[1:09:09] The prophet says it like this in 1957.
[1:09:11] He said God being holy and just, he had
[1:09:14] to have a prosecution. He had to
[1:09:17] prosecute the sinner because he had
[1:09:19] overstepped the boundaries of grace and
[1:09:22] became a lawbreaking citizen. Then he
[1:09:26] must be dealt with. And every law,
[1:09:28] listen now, every law has a penalty for
[1:09:31] the penalty of transgressing God's law
[1:09:33] is death. And it had to project death to
[1:09:36] the human race. And all the human race
[1:09:39] is under the penalty of the law. So
[1:09:42] because of the fall of man in the
[1:09:45] beginning, every woman, every boy, every
[1:09:48] girl, every person that is born after a
[1:09:50] man, after a woman, they are actually
[1:09:53] born with the penalty of death actually
[1:09:56] inside of their members. And let's just
[1:09:58] face it, there's no getting around it.
[1:10:00] The prosecutor had us dead in the right.
[1:10:03] There's no way that you and I can take
[1:10:05] and say that we're not born with
[1:10:07] trouble, that we're not born with
[1:10:08] problems, that we're not born, remember,
[1:10:10] you don't have to teach a child how to
[1:10:12] lie. There's something in bred into that
[1:10:15] child when he is raised up. You don't
[1:10:17] have to teach him. It's automatic
[1:10:19] because he's born under a fallen nature.
[1:10:22] And because of the way we are born,
[1:10:25] every one of us was born onto death row.
[1:10:28] We come to this world born on death row.
[1:10:31] There wasn't one of us born righteous.
[1:10:34] There wasn't one of us born holy. There
[1:10:37] wasn't one born better than the other.
[1:10:39] We was all born the same way. We was
[1:10:41] born in sin and shaped in iniquity.
[1:10:45] Amen. And the reason why we come to this
[1:10:48] condemnation was because of our
[1:10:51] representation.
[1:10:53] Because of our representation, we become
[1:10:56] condemned from the very being. Well,
[1:10:58] brother David, I wasn't here and I
[1:11:00] didn't do it. But you was condemned
[1:11:02] because of the representation in the
[1:11:04] beginning. So it's condemnation by
[1:11:07] representation.
[1:11:08] Amen. We was all represented by the same
[1:11:12] attorney. We was all represented by the
[1:11:15] same man. And when your representation
[1:11:17] loses the case, you lose your case. Why?
[1:11:21] God's law has been broken. And there's a
[1:11:24] penalty that comes with breaking the law
[1:11:26] of God. There's a judgment that comes
[1:11:29] against us. And that judgment tells us
[1:11:32] that a man may live or however long he
[1:11:34] may live. Remember the Bible tells us
[1:11:36] Methuselah lived longer than any man in
[1:11:38] the Bible. But I want to tell you
[1:11:40] eventually the death sentence caught up
[1:11:42] with Meth. Amen. It eventually caught up
[1:11:46] with him and he died 969
[1:11:49] years. But finally here come death
[1:11:52] around that man. And it got all it
[1:11:54] looked like he was going to make it to
[1:11:55] the millennium.
[1:11:58] But eventually the appointment of death
[1:12:00] got him. And I'll tell you, man, since
[1:12:03] that day and the fall, man has been put
[1:12:06] into solitary confinement. We've been
[1:12:09] locked up. We've been caged up. Somebody
[1:12:11] say, "Amen." We could not help
[1:12:14] ourselves. As a matter of fact, there
[1:12:16] was nothing that could appease the very
[1:12:18] justice of God. No matter how many good
[1:12:21] works that we have, no matter how many
[1:12:23] good deeds we have, it would not appease
[1:12:26] the justice of God. Works will never
[1:12:29] appease the justice of God. You can pray
[1:12:32] and we should. We can read our Bibles
[1:12:34] and we should, but no matter how much we
[1:12:36] pray, how many things we do for God, you
[1:12:39] can never appease the justice of God by
[1:12:41] works because you're not saved by works.
[1:12:46] Because God know the way that man was.
[1:12:49] The moment he started doing something,
[1:12:51] he'd go bragging about how great he is
[1:12:53] and how wonderful he is. And God does
[1:12:55] not want the light to move from him to
[1:12:58] anybody else.
[1:13:01] Amen. There will be no time off death
[1:13:05] row because of good works.
[1:13:08] Amen. We're not saved by them, but let
[1:13:10] me say this. If you got right kind of
[1:13:12] faith, your works will tell of what your
[1:13:15] faith has done.
[1:13:17] Paul knows I'm locked up. He knew that
[1:13:21] according to the word, he knew that he
[1:13:23] could not come off of this unless God
[1:13:26] would do something.
[1:13:28] Paul said it like this in Romans 7. For
[1:13:30] we know that the law is spiritual.
[1:13:34] I'll say it for you. But I am carnal.
[1:13:39] I am carnal.
[1:13:42] I'll just say it for you. We're carnal.
[1:13:44] We're human. We get our feelings hurt.
[1:13:47] We get down. We get discouraged. We got
[1:13:50] good days. We got bad days. Every one of
[1:13:53] us are carnal. Notice Paul said, "I am
[1:13:56] carnal. Sold under sin." Look at this
[1:14:00] word sold. It means to sell with a
[1:14:02] price. Sell into slavery. Sold under
[1:14:06] entirely under the control. Hallelujah.
[1:14:09] Of something else. the master to whom
[1:14:12] one is sold as a slave to give himself
[1:14:14] up completely to another's will. I don't
[1:14:18] want to get ahead of myself, but if I
[1:14:21] can be sold by a price,
[1:14:24] I said if I can be sold by a price,
[1:14:26] can't I be bought with a price?
[1:14:30] If I can be condemned by my
[1:14:33] representation, if I can be condemned by
[1:14:36] being represented by an attorney, can't
[1:14:38] Amen. Can't there be another attorney
[1:14:41] that can take and buy me back to be
[1:14:43] bought by a price?
[1:14:48] It being sold and send my master. What
[1:14:51] happens if I get another master? What
[1:14:54] happens if I get another king? Amen. Let
[1:14:57] me say this. We needed a better
[1:14:58] attorney. We needed better
[1:15:01] representation. They tell you that
[1:15:03] individuals should never represent
[1:15:05] theirelves.
[1:15:07] You're almost certain to lose your case
[1:15:10] if you come to represent yourself. So,
[1:15:13] I'm not coming today by my own
[1:15:15] representation. I'm not coming to plead
[1:15:17] my own case. Oh, no. You may get nervous
[1:15:20] and forget the most valuable evidence
[1:15:22] you got. But let me tell you, we got an
[1:15:24] attorney today. He's all remembering.
[1:15:27] He's all knowing. He never forgets one
[1:15:29] thing. I'm talking about a king. I'm
[1:15:32] talking about all remembering God today.
[1:15:36] Hallelujah.
[1:15:41] Paul knew even though I got new life on
[1:15:44] the inside of me, I still I'm still
[1:15:48] bound.
[1:15:51] Now, after you've been found guilty
[1:15:54] and your case has been judged,
[1:15:57] after you received the judgment from the
[1:16:01] jury, there's only one thing that was
[1:16:03] left and that's your sentencing.
[1:16:06] Now watch, because every person that is
[1:16:10] sentenced and every person that is
[1:16:12] judged, they got a right to appeal their
[1:16:15] case.
[1:16:18] So Paul knew that. He said, "Even though
[1:16:21] that I've been judged and I'm
[1:16:23] incarcerated and I'm confined into this
[1:16:26] mortal body, I want a pill." I said, "I
[1:16:29] want an appeal." Hallelujah. And David
[1:16:33] tells us that God will hear the groaning
[1:16:36] of his prisoner. And that groaning to me
[1:16:38] today is, "Lord, I want my appeal to
[1:16:41] come through. I want you to I want a
[1:16:43] righteous judge. I want a holy judge
[1:16:45] that I can appeal my case to. I can
[1:16:48] plead my case to.
[1:16:52] Paul said, "We're waiting." Listen to
[1:16:54] this. We're waiting. When a man gets
[1:16:57] locked up, that's all it can do. You're
[1:17:00] just waiting.
[1:17:02] They say people that is waiting for
[1:17:05] their appeal every day. It dominates
[1:17:09] their minds because they're in their
[1:17:11] mind. Oh, listen now. Cuz everybody's
[1:17:14] Everybody's innocent.
[1:17:16] Everybody's innocent. Everybody claims
[1:17:19] to be innocent. But I don't want to
[1:17:21] claim that I'm innocent because of my
[1:17:23] feelings or my emotions. I want
[1:17:26] something to speak on my behalf. I want
[1:17:29] something to stand on my behalf. And I
[1:17:31] want it to declare my innocence by the
[1:17:34] word of God.
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:36] So we're waiting. Hallelujah. We're
[1:17:39] waiting. Paul said we're waiting. Romans
[1:17:41] 8:19. Watch as he comes now for the
[1:17:43] earnest expectation of the creature. It
[1:17:46] waiteth. Hallelujah.
[1:17:49] Watch what he's waiting on. Watch what
[1:17:52] he's looking forward to. He waitth for
[1:17:55] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:17:57] Because the creature itself also, yes,
[1:18:01] sir,
[1:18:04] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:18:08] corruptional into what, Paul? They're
[1:18:11] going to be delivered from the bondage
[1:18:12] of corruption into the glorious liberty.
[1:18:16] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The glorious
[1:18:20] liberty of the children of God. And we
[1:18:23] know that the whole creation grown us
[1:18:27] and travaleth in pain together until
[1:18:30] now. Look at verse 23. And not only
[1:18:35] they, but ourselves also, which has the
[1:18:39] first fruits of the spirit.
[1:18:42] He said, notice Paul's telling us it's
[1:18:44] not only nature growing and botney life
[1:18:47] and animal life. But I want to tell you,
[1:18:49] we're groaning from the inside. Paul is
[1:18:52] saying that because something has
[1:18:54] changed on the inside, and it doesn't
[1:18:56] match the outside. But what's on the
[1:18:58] inside is calling out for something on
[1:19:01] the outside to release and discharge.
[1:19:04] Amen.
[1:19:08] He said even we ourselves grown within
[1:19:11] ourselves waiting. Hallelujah.
[1:19:14] Waiting for the adoption
[1:19:17] to wit the redemption of your soul.
[1:19:20] Hallelujah. To wit the redemption of
[1:19:23] your bodies. Amen. Now the prophet tells
[1:19:26] us that word means to quicken the
[1:19:29] redemption of our bodies. So Paul said
[1:19:33] if you got the first fruits of the
[1:19:35] spirit you become eligible
[1:19:39] come on
[1:19:41] to be quickened
[1:19:43] until then we're groaning. Nature's
[1:19:45] groaning. Everything's groaning. Oh, you
[1:19:48] can't hear maybe with your natural ear,
[1:19:51] but if you can look into the
[1:19:52] supernatural realms, the trees are
[1:19:54] crying out. Animal life is crying out.
[1:19:58] Everything is waiting for the
[1:19:59] manifestation of the suns. Oh my, think
[1:20:02] about it. They're waiting for something
[1:20:04] to happen. Hallelujah. Nature's
[1:20:07] groaning. Everything's groaning. Waiting
[1:20:09] for the manifestation of the suns.
[1:20:13] Because when sons get back in their
[1:20:16] position,
[1:20:19] Whatever man fell from, if he can get
[1:20:22] back to the place where he fell from,
[1:20:24] everything that was put under man will
[1:20:27] automatically be, hallelujah, will be
[1:20:29] pulled back into their position. When
[1:20:31] you get sons of God back, the trees will
[1:20:33] come back. Animal life will come back.
[1:20:35] The lion will come back. When you get
[1:20:37] the sons in their place, everything
[1:20:39] under man will come back to his place.
[1:20:43] Hallelujah.
[1:20:49] Oh, glory. It literally will force
[1:20:53] everything back into its original
[1:20:55] position when you get sons back. So,
[1:20:58] everything hinges on sons of God.
[1:21:02] Everything is hinging upon the
[1:21:04] deliverance and the exoneration of sons.
[1:21:08] The prophet says it like this.
[1:21:12] He comes in 1963.
[1:21:15] He's going to preach the message of the
[1:21:17] breach.
[1:21:19] Notice just before the opening of the
[1:21:22] seals. And the prophet says, "We've been
[1:21:26] waiting for this hour.
[1:21:32] Paul's been waiting on it. Nature's been
[1:21:35] waiting on it. Animal life's been
[1:21:37] waiting on it. And the prophet says,
[1:21:39] "We've been waiting on it. We've been
[1:21:41] waiting for this hour. We understand
[1:21:44] this will take place at the first
[1:21:45] resurrection. Nature is groaning. We are
[1:21:49] groaning. Everything is groaning because
[1:21:53] we realize there's something that's not
[1:21:55] right." Amen.
[1:21:58] And the only way that you can groan and
[1:22:02] wait for it is because there's been new
[1:22:06] life come in here that speaks of a new
[1:22:10] world to come. Hallelujah.
[1:22:13] So your flesh is represented by the old
[1:22:16] order, but your soul is represented by
[1:22:19] the new order. And one is going to
[1:22:21] dominate. It's either going to be sin or
[1:22:24] it's going to be immortal life.
[1:22:26] Something is going to dominate. And let
[1:22:28] me say this, we've been waiting for this
[1:22:30] hour. The sons of God will come back to
[1:22:33] their position.
[1:22:35] [Applause]
[1:22:38] You realize why you grown? If you've
[1:22:40] been born again, that's what the Holy
[1:22:42] Ghost. You realize if you've been born
[1:22:44] again and you got the Holy Ghost, that
[1:22:46] has given you new life.
[1:22:49] Amen. Not a life under the destinence.
[1:22:52] Not a life of incarceration.
[1:22:54] That new life speaks of a new world
[1:22:57] where there ain't no bondage. Where
[1:23:00] there ain't no jails, where there ain't
[1:23:02] no sickness. Somebody help me now. There
[1:23:04] ain't no trouble. There ain't no devil.
[1:23:07] There ain't no demons. There ain't
[1:23:08] nothing. That's a world we're talking
[1:23:10] about. We're going to a new world.
[1:23:19] Well, brother David, I know I'm a son of
[1:23:21] God. Amen. God gave me the Holy Ghost to
[1:23:24] make me a son of God. No, he never.
[1:23:29] I said, "No, he never." God don't give
[1:23:32] you the Holy Ghost to make you anything.
[1:23:35] [Applause]
[1:23:37] Because getting the Holy Ghost don't
[1:23:38] make you a son of God. But because God
[1:23:41] give you the Holy Ghost, it proves that
[1:23:43] you always was a son of God. It ain't
[1:23:47] God making you something you never was.
[1:23:49] God's not changing you from what you
[1:23:50] was. He's letting you know this is
[1:23:52] something you always was. But because of
[1:23:55] your condemnation by representation, you
[1:23:58] become a part of the fall.
[1:24:02] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:24:05] Yes, sir. And there's a spirit of God on
[1:24:07] the inside that's telling you just wait.
[1:24:10] Just wait. There's a heavens coming.
[1:24:13] There's a new earth that's coming.
[1:24:15] There's a new Jerusalem that's coming.
[1:24:17] There's a new earth that's coming. Oh,
[1:24:19] let me tell you, if you're weary today,
[1:24:21] I'd get my faith wrapped around that.
[1:24:23] Let me encourage you. There's a new body
[1:24:25] that's coming. If you're discouraged
[1:24:27] today, let me tell you that there is a
[1:24:29] new body that is coming. If you're down
[1:24:31] today, if you're sick today, let me tell
[1:24:33] you, a new body's coming.
[1:24:36] And that body can't get weary.
[1:24:39] That body can't get depressed.
[1:24:41] That body will never get down.
[1:24:44] Because the one who gets it down won't
[1:24:46] be there.
[1:24:51] Hallelujah.
[1:24:54] Job knew. Job. He knew. He knew he was
[1:24:59] locked up. He knew he was bound up. In
[1:25:03] the book of Job 14, it says something
[1:25:04] like this. All the days of my appointed
[1:25:08] time,
[1:25:11] I'm going to sit on this cell block.
[1:25:14] I'm going to sit in this prison and all
[1:25:16] the days of my appointed time will I
[1:25:20] will I all my appointed days will I
[1:25:23] until
[1:25:25] until till what Job until my change
[1:25:28] comes. You see Job caught the
[1:25:31] revelation. Even though that Job knew he
[1:25:35] would get down, he knew he would not
[1:25:36] stay down.
[1:25:39] Anybody hear me today? He knew even
[1:25:41] though I may go like the flower, I may
[1:25:43] go like the leaf, I may go back to the
[1:25:46] dust of the earth, and I may wait there
[1:25:48] until my appointed time, but there's
[1:25:50] going to come a day, amen, that the
[1:25:52] king's going to come down on top of me
[1:25:54] and deliver me from the bondage of
[1:25:56] corruption. My change is going to come.
[1:26:03] Job knew there's a resurrection coming.
[1:26:07] Do you know why Job had the resurrection
[1:26:09] revelation?
[1:26:12] I've been preaching on that at home. The
[1:26:14] resurrection revelation. Ain't it
[1:26:16] amazing how many people got it and how
[1:26:18] many people didn't. Not one Pharisee got
[1:26:21] that revelation. Not one Sadducee got
[1:26:23] that revelation. Even though Jesus told
[1:26:25] them over and over again, they never did
[1:26:27] get it. They wasn't waiting on it.
[1:26:32] But Job caught it.
[1:26:38] But Job went by the ground.
[1:26:41] So God wanted to inject something into
[1:26:44] the oat to let us know we're not all
[1:26:48] going to sleep.
[1:26:52] Amen.
[1:26:53] So God allowed a man by the name of
[1:26:57] Enoch.
[1:27:00] Amen.
[1:27:01] And let me say this, Enoch is not
[1:27:05] Pentecost's type.
[1:27:07] It's not Luther's type. It's not all.
[1:27:10] Listen, it's not the Tyra. It's not SRA.
[1:27:14] But Enoch types the last day.
[1:27:19] Now, every other age, the prophet tells
[1:27:21] us this is every other age would go to
[1:27:23] sleep.
[1:27:25] But he's letting us know there's coming
[1:27:28] a people that shall be created.
[1:27:32] Hallelujah. That is going to fulfill
[1:27:34] exactly what Enoch did.
[1:27:38] Amen. If we want the results that Enoch
[1:27:41] got. Amen. We better find out what Enoch
[1:27:45] did. And the Bible said he got to
[1:27:47] fellowshipping with God. Brother, when
[1:27:49] you go to fellowshipping with your
[1:27:51] attorney and you go to letting him know,
[1:27:53] oh my, you go to worshiping because he's
[1:27:56] God and you go to praising because he's
[1:27:58] God, it proves that there's something in
[1:28:00] you that it's not just time.
[1:28:05] The prophet said he got to walking with
[1:28:07] God until he was not. Enoch never did
[1:28:10] die.
[1:28:12] Enoch escaped. Amen. death row.
[1:28:18] And the prophet tells us Enoch was the
[1:28:21] seventh from Adam.
[1:28:23] And we're living in the seventh church
[1:28:25] age
[1:28:26] from the second Adam. I said from the
[1:28:29] first Adam, it brought a man who did not
[1:28:32] go by the way of the grave. And may I
[1:28:34] say in this day, in this last age, there
[1:28:37] is again another people in the land that
[1:28:41] is welcome with God, fellowshipping with
[1:28:43] God. Hallelujah. a people that's got a
[1:28:46] revelation of what the pyramid is.
[1:28:52] Can you imagine what the devil thought
[1:28:54] when Enoch come up missing?
[1:28:57] Probably like some of these prophylars
[1:28:59] around the message.
[1:29:03] Oh yeah. They're good about building
[1:29:06] cases. Come on. I said they're good at
[1:29:10] comparing human nature by human nature,
[1:29:12] human comments by human comments
[1:29:15] because that's all they see. They don't
[1:29:17] have the resurrection revelation. But to
[1:29:20] you that's got an ear to hear what the
[1:29:22] spirit is saying to the church.
[1:29:25] Amen.
[1:29:27] I imagine Satan thought, "Oh, he
[1:29:29] probably ran off in some culture."
[1:29:32] I know what he did. He probably got
[1:29:34] himself locked in that pyramid over
[1:29:36] there. You would probably be right.
[1:29:39] I don't know about you, I want locked
[1:29:41] into this pyramid. Faith, virtue,
[1:29:44] temperance, godliness. I want to be
[1:29:45] locked into it.
[1:29:48] [Applause]
[1:29:49] No. As the prophet said in the breach,
[1:29:51] I'll start my timer now. Is it okay?
[1:29:55] Sorry.
[1:29:58] When a person is struck with diseases,
[1:30:01] aches, pain, one time they wasn't that
[1:30:06] way,
[1:30:09] sir. But they're groaning. Why? They're
[1:30:11] not right. There's something wrong. And
[1:30:13] they're groaning trying to get back
[1:30:15] where they was when they had health. And
[1:30:19] when nature and peoples, the Bible said,
[1:30:21] he said, are groaning, it shows that
[1:30:24] there's something that they're not in
[1:30:26] their ought to be condition.
[1:30:31] They're not in their ought to be
[1:30:32] condition. They have fallen from
[1:30:34] somewhere. In other words, if I fell
[1:30:38] from somewhere, my identity is not just
[1:30:40] a part of time.
[1:30:43] Amen.
[1:30:45] Now, if my identity came from the
[1:30:47] eternal part of God, somebody has to
[1:30:50] come to get me off of this death
[1:30:51] sentence. I said, "Somebody had to get
[1:30:54] us out of this mess." And I want to tell
[1:30:56] you, there was no preacher can do it.
[1:30:59] There ain't no bishop can do it. There
[1:31:01] was no pope that can do it. Hallelujah.
[1:31:03] There was no man. Amen. There was no man
[1:31:07] born of a woman that was able to do it.
[1:31:11] So in order to get man off the death
[1:31:13] sentence, God had to put somebody on the
[1:31:15] earth that was not born under the
[1:31:17] penalty of the law. That way the
[1:31:20] judgment of the law cannot be held
[1:31:21] against him. And since listen now, and
[1:31:24] since the since the fall came by woman
[1:31:28] breaking the word
[1:31:32] in order to redeem and restore man back,
[1:31:34] look what God's going to do. It was a
[1:31:36] woman that caused the fall. And God's
[1:31:38] going to send through the woman, the
[1:31:40] church. Come on, somebody. Something
[1:31:41] that can redeem man back from what they
[1:31:43] fell from. Amen. God is going to use a
[1:31:47] woman to birth the word of God.
[1:31:53] What's God going to do? Brother tells us
[1:31:57] and spoken words originally received.
[1:31:58] Brother says, "Mary did what Eve failed
[1:32:03] to do." Amen.
[1:32:06] Which proves to us that Eve should have
[1:32:08] all listen Eve should have gi birth by
[1:32:11] the spoken word. The same as Mary did,
[1:32:14] that's what Eve should have done. But
[1:32:16] let me tell you, whenever she listened
[1:32:18] to the lie of the enemy, she interrupted
[1:32:20] God's program. And when she took this
[1:32:23] serpent seed, she produced upon the
[1:32:26] earth the wrong nature.
[1:32:28] Amen. I said she took the word instead
[1:32:32] of heeding to what God has said. Amen.
[1:32:34] Isn't that what every age has done?
[1:32:37] I said isn't that what every church age
[1:32:39] has done? They took the word of a man
[1:32:42] and the idea of a man. They took
[1:32:44] Constantine's idea. They took the ages
[1:32:46] idea. But I want to tell you, we don't
[1:32:48] want to feed just from the words of a
[1:32:49] man. Those words will fail you. My words
[1:32:52] may fail you. But God's word will never
[1:32:55] never never fail you.
[1:33:02] the people which shall be created. So
[1:33:04] God was going to create his own bride.
[1:33:11] And then when he comes to her, he's
[1:33:13] going to seal her womb where she'll
[1:33:14] never give birth to anything outside the
[1:33:17] word. Hallelujah. Now the prophet tells
[1:33:19] us before Adam fell, the prophet said
[1:33:23] that Adam had the book of redemption.
[1:33:26] Right? But said, "Adam had the ability
[1:33:28] to be able to control the elements. He
[1:33:31] could speak to the wind." Come on,
[1:33:34] somebody. He could speak the word. He
[1:33:36] could speak to the tree and it'd be
[1:33:38] moved. He could speak to the wind and it
[1:33:40] would cease. And the reason why is
[1:33:43] because Adam had the spoken word because
[1:33:46] Adam had the book.
[1:33:48] But whenever Adam lost the book,
[1:33:52] and the book, listen, and the book did
[1:33:54] not go into the hands of Satan,
[1:33:58] the book did not go into the hands of
[1:33:59] Satan. It went back into the hands of
[1:34:02] the original owner, which is Almighty
[1:34:04] God.
[1:34:07] Every person born after the book went
[1:34:10] from an open book to a closed book was
[1:34:12] born under death. Amen. Amen. From Adam
[1:34:16] until now, every person born bound,
[1:34:20] every person born incarcerated.
[1:34:24] Notice the program says in the sixth
[1:34:25] seal, that's the reason John wept. Yes,
[1:34:28] sir. Because if no man could get that
[1:34:30] book, all creation and everything was
[1:34:33] gone. She just, this always amazed me.
[1:34:36] She would simply turn back to atoms,
[1:34:38] molecules, cosmic light, and there would
[1:34:42] not even be a creation, a person, or
[1:34:43] nothing else cuz Adam lost the rights of
[1:34:46] that book. How many knows the book's
[1:34:48] important?
[1:34:50] Every man is born of sex, born after
[1:34:52] sexual desire. He was in the original
[1:34:54] sin between Satan and Eve, so he could
[1:34:56] not do it. There's, listen to this,
[1:34:58] there's nothing in him. There's nothing
[1:35:02] in him. No holy pope,
[1:35:05] right? No priest, no doctor, divinity,
[1:35:09] whoever it might be. Listen to this.
[1:35:11] Nobody was worthy.
[1:35:14] He couldn't be an angel because it had
[1:35:16] to be a kinsman. Hallelujah. It had to
[1:35:20] be a kinsman. It had to be a man. It had
[1:35:24] to be a man. Then God himself,
[1:35:29] Amen. become a kinsman by taking on
[1:35:33] human flesh through the virgin birth.
[1:35:35] And he shed his blood. Amen.
[1:35:39] He said that wasn't the blood of a Jew.
[1:35:41] Remember I read this morning said,
[1:35:43] "Remember at one time I thought Jesus
[1:35:45] had Jewish blood, but I found out that
[1:35:47] wasn't the blood of a Jew.
[1:35:50] It wasn't the blood of a Gentile."
[1:35:54] Can you handle this? It was the blood of
[1:35:57] God.
[1:35:58] I said it was the blood of God. The
[1:36:01] Bible says we're saved through the blood
[1:36:02] of God and the child takes the father's
[1:36:06] blood. So, brother said every one of us
[1:36:09] are saved by the blood of almighty God.
[1:36:12] That's the reason, listen, that's the
[1:36:13] reason when you're born here, you was
[1:36:15] born with a tainted blood.
[1:36:18] But the blood of the father did not come
[1:36:21] the way my blood did. It did not come
[1:36:23] the way your blood did. Our blood is
[1:36:25] tainted. But his blood was not tainted.
[1:36:30] His blood came by the spoken word.
[1:36:34] Hallelujah. I'm telling you, God created
[1:36:36] a blood.
[1:36:42] The prophet says God created a blood
[1:36:46] cell. Yes, sir.
[1:36:49] Singular.
[1:36:51] Not blood cells. many he created a blood
[1:36:56] cell and then from that one blood cell
[1:36:59] it multiplied
[1:37:02] I said it multiplied so for one cell it
[1:37:05] became two cell from two cell to four
[1:37:08] cell and it starts splitting and
[1:37:10] splitting and multiply and multiply and
[1:37:12] when God's blood cell become multiply it
[1:37:15] created a body
[1:37:18] are you hearing me today and as his
[1:37:21] blood cell multiplied when The word
[1:37:23] comes back over you and I. It may have
[1:37:26] started on one day in the upper room,
[1:37:28] but since that day, that blood cell's
[1:37:30] been multiplying. One son after another,
[1:37:33] one child of God after another, one
[1:37:35] daughter of God after the other, the
[1:37:36] blood cell has multiplied.
[1:37:41] Until it's formed a body.
[1:37:46] Hallelujah.
[1:37:49] So when you get born again, you take a
[1:37:52] different blood.
[1:37:56] You take a different cell. You take a
[1:37:59] different gene. Come on. Now remember,
[1:38:04] that's what the enemy got us by was
[1:38:07] blood evidence.
[1:38:09] That's the reason I was found guilty.
[1:38:11] It's because of the blood.
[1:38:14] Matter of fact, Isaiah picks it up in
[1:38:16] Isaiah 59 and he says, "Your iniquities
[1:38:21] have separated
[1:38:23] between you and your God and your sins,
[1:38:29] have hid his face."
[1:38:34] So when God looks upon fallen man, it's
[1:38:37] as though God can't look at him. So he
[1:38:39] he hides his face.
[1:38:43] Well, if the wrong blood made him hide
[1:38:46] his face,
[1:38:50] I said if the wrong blood made him hide
[1:38:52] his face, what will the right word do?
[1:39:02] Notice Isaiah goes on to say, watch how
[1:39:04] guilty he was. Watch this crime scene.
[1:39:07] For your hands are defiled with blood,
[1:39:11] your fingers with iniquity, your lips
[1:39:14] have spoken,
[1:39:18] and your tongue has mutter perversed us.
[1:39:22] That's what tainted blood caused. That's
[1:39:25] what your tainted blood caused. Because
[1:39:28] of our iniquities, it caused us, listen,
[1:39:31] to be in this state that we are in now.
[1:39:34] And when it did, it caused God to hide
[1:39:36] his face because it separated us. In
[1:39:39] other words, because of because of
[1:39:42] tainted blood, it divided us and God to
[1:39:45] where we become incarcerated and
[1:39:47] separated from the rep from God.
[1:39:51] So your iniquities, your perversess,
[1:39:54] your lies cause you to put on death row.
[1:39:59] And when you're on death row, you're
[1:40:00] locked up, chained up. Amen.
[1:40:04] It caused this divide, this separation
[1:40:06] between you and God. In other words, the
[1:40:08] law found us guilty. And because we was
[1:40:10] guilty, the law has locked us up and put
[1:40:12] us in this incarceration.
[1:40:14] But wait,
[1:40:16] he said we're not saved by the blood of
[1:40:18] a Jew. And we're not saved by the blood
[1:40:21] of a gentile, but we are saved by the
[1:40:23] blood.
[1:40:28] So when my appeal comes up, come on.
[1:40:32] I don't want to take what Isaiah saw.
[1:40:36] I don't want to take the evidence that
[1:40:37] Isaiah was looking at the hands, the
[1:40:40] fingers, the lies, the tongue. We don't
[1:40:42] want to look at that evidence because
[1:40:44] that wasn't me anyway.
[1:40:47] I want to look at something else in my
[1:40:50] appeal. I want to present a better
[1:40:52] blood. Hallelujah. Amen. Notice that
[1:40:56] Paul tells us in Ephesians, "And now in
[1:40:59] Christ Jesus, ye who were sometimes far
[1:41:04] off. We are made nigh by the," In other
[1:41:07] words, you are drawn close. You are
[1:41:10] brought near by the blood of Christ. For
[1:41:13] he is our peace and he has broken down.
[1:41:17] Listen, he had made both one and hath
[1:41:20] broken down the middle wall of petition.
[1:41:25] Look at this word broken down. He has
[1:41:28] loosed.
[1:41:30] He has loose anything that's tied or
[1:41:32] fastened. To loose one that's bound to
[1:41:35] unbind
[1:41:36] to release from bonds. To set free.
[1:41:41] To set free one that's bound up with
[1:41:42] chains. A prisoner. To discharge from
[1:41:46] let go.
[1:41:48] Look at this last part. It means to
[1:41:51] dismiss or break up laws
[1:41:55] having a binding force.
[1:41:58] So he's telling us there's a higher law
[1:42:01] that's going to supersede the law that
[1:42:04] found you guilty.
[1:42:07] And it's literally Hallelujah. It's
[1:42:09] going to break up the law having a
[1:42:11] binding force.
[1:42:13] It literally comes from the word anol.
[1:42:16] Hallelujah. Now watch because something
[1:42:19] happened and there's a blood that we
[1:42:22] want to present. It's a evidence that is
[1:42:26] absolutely it's imperative to our case.
[1:42:30] As a matter of fact, we're going to need
[1:42:33] the right kind of attorney. And anybody
[1:42:35] that wants an attorney, they want a high
[1:42:38] profile attorney. Well, let me just tell
[1:42:40] you, you can't get no higher than ours.
[1:42:44] I said you can't get no higher than
[1:42:45] ours. Our attorney goes beyond time. It
[1:42:48] goes beyond sin. As a matter of fact,
[1:42:51] the earth is his full. You talk about a
[1:42:53] high profile attorney. You got one,
[1:42:56] brother.
[1:42:59] So, we've been under this appeal for the
[1:43:01] last Oh, it's been a long time. You
[1:43:03] know, about seven church ages. And we've
[1:43:06] been waiting. We've been waiting.
[1:43:10] In the last 40 to 50 years,
[1:43:14] do you realize there's been hundreds on
[1:43:17] top of hundreds of people that has been
[1:43:20] released from death row and actually
[1:43:23] released from prison. And the reason why
[1:43:27] is because of new evidence.
[1:43:31] It's called DNA evidence.
[1:43:34] Amen. And the crime scene had blood on
[1:43:37] it, sir. And you have the ability to
[1:43:41] test the blood for DNA.
[1:43:44] Amen. Now, because of the advancements
[1:43:47] of science and technology and all that,
[1:43:49] they have discovered, listen, they
[1:43:51] discovered that there's a mystery about
[1:43:53] blood. They know that there's something
[1:43:55] that lays in the blood. And they
[1:43:57] actually discovered a way to test the
[1:44:00] blood for DNA.
[1:44:02] Now, DNA is found in a person's gene.
[1:44:08] It's literally the genetic makeup of an
[1:44:11] individual.
[1:44:12] Hallelujah. It's your sale. It listen.
[1:44:16] It's your sale driver's license.
[1:44:19] It's your cell passport. Hallelujah. It
[1:44:23] identifies who you are. In other words,
[1:44:26] the identity of who you are is encoded
[1:44:30] in your DNA. Yeah, sir. DNA was first
[1:44:35] noticed in the 1800s. Think about this.
[1:44:40] They discovered, scientists discovered
[1:44:43] there's something about the blood that
[1:44:45] has an identity in it, but the problem
[1:44:48] is they knew that the blood had a
[1:44:50] genetic code. They knew that that code
[1:44:54] lays in the person's gene, but they
[1:44:57] didn't know how to unlock it.
[1:45:01] Come on. They knew there was vital
[1:45:03] information that's laying there. Oh, if
[1:45:06] they could only look far enough and
[1:45:08] there would be a microscope. Oh, that
[1:45:10] would be able to appear deep enough into
[1:45:13] the blood.
[1:45:15] They would know how to interpret the
[1:45:17] information that lays in the blood cell.
[1:45:21] I'm going to say that real slow. I said
[1:45:23] there's a mystery that lays in the
[1:45:25] blood. And they didn't have the answer
[1:45:27] to what the mystery was. They didn't
[1:45:29] have the interpretation to the
[1:45:31] information that laid behind the blood
[1:45:33] cell.
[1:45:37] And in the 1800s,
[1:45:40] the code was still a mystery.
[1:45:42] It was a mystery and they couldn't they
[1:45:44] couldn't figure it out. Now, they
[1:45:47] understood pieces and they understood
[1:45:50] parts and they could see a little here
[1:45:53] and a little bit over there, but they
[1:45:55] didn't have the full understanding of
[1:45:58] what laid behind the mystery. Oh,
[1:46:01] listen. They rallied around the pieces.
[1:46:03] They rallied around the parts, but they
[1:46:05] did not have the full revelation of what
[1:46:08] lays there.
[1:46:11] Yes, sir.
[1:46:13] But somewhere in the mid 1900s,
[1:46:21] the mystery of the blood code, come on.
[1:46:24] Hallelujah. Started breaking. Yes, sir.
[1:46:27] Now, what they found out is Oh, you
[1:46:29] talking about powerful. I found this
[1:46:31] statement yesterday morning. What they
[1:46:33] found out is that within the blood, it
[1:46:36] has what they call, look it up, a DNA
[1:46:38] revelation.
[1:46:41] And you don't hardly have to be around
[1:46:42] the message to know that's powerful.
[1:46:45] They said the blood has DNA revelation.
[1:46:49] In other words, there's a mystery that
[1:46:51] lays in the DNA and that DNA has to be
[1:46:55] revealed what lays in there.
[1:46:59] Now, listen to this. You can impersonate
[1:47:01] a lot of things in life. You can
[1:47:04] impersonate somebody's hair color. You
[1:47:07] can impersonate their hairstyle. You can
[1:47:09] impersonate someone's size and stature.
[1:47:11] But let me say this, all everything on
[1:47:13] the outside can be impersonated.
[1:47:19] [Music]
[1:47:21] But when it comes to your DNA, DNA
[1:47:24] cannot be impersonated.
[1:47:28] I Oh, listen to me. first pull can be
[1:47:30] impersonated.
[1:47:33] We've even seen some second pull be
[1:47:35] impersonated.
[1:47:38] But when it comes to the mysteries of
[1:47:39] God, when it comes to the mind of God,
[1:47:42] when it comes to the word of God, let me
[1:47:44] say this. The third pull cannot cannot
[1:47:47] cannot cannot be impersonated. No matter
[1:47:50] how big you are, how little you are, you
[1:47:53] cannot impersonate DNA.
[1:48:01] Because of the ability to understand DNA
[1:48:05] revelation,
[1:48:07] there's been hundreds of people
[1:48:10] exonerated.
[1:48:14] I'd say a few of them right here in this
[1:48:15] building today
[1:48:18] that's been exonerated because they've
[1:48:20] been wrongly accused.
[1:48:24] Thank you, Lord. Because they tell us
[1:48:27] DNA evidence leaves no room for error.
[1:48:35] There's no mistaking. There's no error.
[1:48:38] DNA is a perfect identification for who
[1:48:41] you always was.
[1:48:44] [Applause]
[1:48:46] They found out in the mid 1900s as the
[1:48:49] mystery began to open and the science
[1:48:52] and technology they knew that there was
[1:48:54] something in that blood. Let me just say
[1:48:57] this at the same time
[1:49:01] that science had advanced
[1:49:03] to understand DNA revelation
[1:49:09] there was one who was sitting on the
[1:49:10] throne that had a book in his right
[1:49:13] hand. Come on, somebody preach. And in
[1:49:16] that book, that book was sealed with
[1:49:18] seven seals. And in that book was the
[1:49:21] mystery of predestination. In that book
[1:49:23] was the mystery of your origin. In that
[1:49:25] book was your identity. In that book,
[1:49:28] listen, your identity was hid under
[1:49:30] those seals laying in that word.
[1:49:35] And John began to weep because no man
[1:49:37] was found worthy. Ain't it incredible?
[1:49:40] John looked above. John looked
[1:49:41] underneath. John looked everywhere. He
[1:49:43] never found one man. The prophet said he
[1:49:45] looked at Moses and he wasn't worthy. He
[1:49:47] looked at Jeremiah. He wasn't worthy.
[1:49:50] Paul wasn't worthy.
[1:49:53] William Brandon wasn't worthy.
[1:49:57] Come on, somebody. He looked and he
[1:49:59] couldn't find him. I wonder. The prophet
[1:50:01] says, "Why couldn't John find him?" He
[1:50:04] said, "Because the one who took the book
[1:50:07] came from the midst of the throne."
[1:50:09] Anybody hear me? From the very heart of
[1:50:12] God, the very throne of God, there stood
[1:50:14] a lamb. Hallelujah. There stood a lamb.
[1:50:17] There stood one that would remember he
[1:50:19] was a bloody lamb. Showing the office
[1:50:22] that he was in. He was coming to take
[1:50:24] the book.
[1:50:28] And in Revelation five, the lamb took
[1:50:31] the book.
[1:50:33] And whatever happened in Revelation 5,
[1:50:36] when John seen it,
[1:50:39] John didn't fold his arms.
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:46] Brother David, I'm a little bit too old
[1:50:47] to shout. The Bible said the elders,
[1:50:53] John began to rejoice. Everything heard
[1:50:56] I, John. And the prophet tells us that
[1:50:58] John represents the bride. So whatever
[1:51:01] happened with the lamb taking the book
[1:51:02] has a direct impact upon the bride of
[1:51:05] Jesus Christ.
[1:51:11] Now watch because when the book comes
[1:51:13] open every mystery that laid in the book
[1:51:17] everything that was sealed up in
[1:51:18] Revelation chapter 5 is now going to be
[1:51:21] loosed. And let me say this we found out
[1:51:24] that he took the book. And as a matter
[1:51:27] of fact, if you go to chapter 10, you'll
[1:51:30] find out that whenever that mighty angel
[1:51:33] descended, he didn't have a closed book.
[1:51:37] He had an open book. And let me say
[1:51:40] this, not only did the lamb take the
[1:51:42] book, but the lamb opened the book. The
[1:51:46] lamb broke the seals,
[1:51:49] and then he handed the book down to the
[1:51:52] seventh angel to reveal it to the
[1:51:54] people. Hallelujah. Listen, not only did
[1:51:58] Listen, only thing we have, only thing
[1:52:00] you have is the same way it was with
[1:52:02] Moses when Moses stood in front of that
[1:52:03] burning bush. You got the word of a
[1:52:05] prophet. Amen. That's the only thing we
[1:52:07] have. But let me say this. When it comes
[1:52:09] to the book coming open, not only do we
[1:52:12] have the word of a prophet, but the
[1:52:14] lamb, let him get his picture taken.
[1:52:28] The Lord let us see him in Revelation
[1:52:32] 10:1. Somebody say, "Amen." Amen. He
[1:52:34] allowed man to take his picture.
[1:52:38] Let me remind you, this was not
[1:52:40] believers that took this picture. Come
[1:52:43] on. This was not followers of the
[1:52:45] message that took this picture.
[1:52:48] [Music]
[1:52:49] They had no association at all with the
[1:52:52] message of the hour. And I believe God
[1:52:55] allowed that to happen to allow it to be
[1:52:57] identification of the Lord coming down
[1:53:00] with an open book.
[1:53:02] Amen. Let me tell you something.
[1:53:05] That's not a rocket.
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:09] That's not even an airplane from an Air
[1:53:10] Force base.
[1:53:14] That's not a missile.
[1:53:16] That's a bomb.
[1:53:19] An a bomb. A DNA bomb.
[1:53:23] That's Revelation 10:1. I believe it.
[1:53:26] Don't you? Let me tell you what I
[1:53:28] believe that is. I believe that's the
[1:53:30] same one that Daniel saw in his day. I
[1:53:34] believe that is the ancient of days. I
[1:53:36] believe it's the same person that John
[1:53:38] saw in Revelation chapter 1. But he had
[1:53:41] hair that was white as wool, eyes as a
[1:53:43] flame of fire, and feet like brass
[1:53:45] that's been burned in the furnace. I
[1:53:47] believe that's the same one in
[1:53:49] Revelation 1. It's the same one that
[1:53:51] took the book in Revelation 5, and it's
[1:53:54] the same one that came down on Sunset
[1:53:57] Mountain in 1963.
[1:54:03] Listen to me.
[1:54:06] And we're not ashamed of it. We're not
[1:54:08] trying to hide it. We're not trying to
[1:54:10] make excuses. We say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:54:13] We say, "Praise the Lord." We say,
[1:54:15] "Thank you, Lord." We're not ashamed of
[1:54:18] God's message.
[1:54:27] The prophet tells us who that is. Now,
[1:54:29] remember when the seals come open, the
[1:54:31] prophet didn't even have this. It was
[1:54:33] months later before he even knew it.
[1:54:38] All right, anybody hearing me? So he has
[1:54:41] the vision and and actually preached a
[1:54:43] serious time 1962,
[1:54:45] months before it happens. Prophesied it
[1:54:48] before it happens.
[1:54:53] And then in 1963,
[1:54:55] here comes down this mighty angel. And
[1:54:58] the prophet tells us who he is. He's
[1:55:01] wigged with that white angel wig. Amen.
[1:55:05] To show that the message of him being
[1:55:09] God is the truth.
[1:55:13] He's the supreme judge
[1:55:17] of the universe. He's the judge
[1:55:21] of heaven and earth. He is God and
[1:55:25] nothing else but God.
[1:55:28] I'm going to ask you, what is the
[1:55:30] attraction on the mountain?
[1:55:33] What's the attraction on the mountain?
[1:55:35] Now the prophet preaches that he goes to
[1:55:36] a lot of mountain top experiences until
[1:55:39] he comes to the last mountain and he
[1:55:41] said whatever happened on Mount Calvary
[1:55:43] is the same thing that's happened on
[1:55:45] Mount Sunset. He said it was God
[1:55:48] fulfilling his word.
[1:55:52] Amen. So whatever happened on Sunset,
[1:55:54] here's that very same God.
[1:55:57] And look what he's doing. He's looking
[1:55:59] to the right.
[1:56:01] which is the way he looked down upon the
[1:56:04] earth when he looked to the right to the
[1:56:06] thief that was there. Hallelujah. And
[1:56:10] watch his last dying act upon the earth.
[1:56:16] Come on. As he told this thief, "This
[1:56:18] day you'll be with me in paradise."
[1:56:22] Amen. What are you saying? I'm telling
[1:56:25] you the very work of our kinsman
[1:56:28] redeemer that almighty God looked down
[1:56:30] upon man and said this day what did that
[1:56:33] man do? How many good works did the
[1:56:35] thief do? How many good deeds did the
[1:56:38] thief do? He deserved what he was
[1:56:40] getting. He said I deserve this. We we
[1:56:42] deserve this. But you've done nothing.
[1:56:46] That resurrection revelation,
[1:56:49] brother. There was something about that
[1:56:50] revelation that struck that thief upon
[1:56:52] the cross. And he said, "Lord, when you
[1:56:54] come into your kingdom, he never done
[1:56:56] nothing. He never done one good deed."
[1:56:58] But let me say, he looked past the
[1:57:00] blood. He looked past the agony. He
[1:57:02] looked past the the body. And he seen
[1:57:04] Almighty God behind those eyes. Amen. He
[1:57:08] seen God hanging on a cross.
[1:57:15] And here he come looking to the right.
[1:57:19] Notice this. Psalms 102. For he hath
[1:57:21] looked down
[1:57:23] from the height of his sanctuary.
[1:57:26] From heaven did the Lord behold the
[1:57:29] earth to hear the groaning of the
[1:57:32] prisoner
[1:57:34] and to loose those
[1:57:37] that are appointed to death.
[1:57:40] That tells me that Paul said, "We shall
[1:57:43] not all sleep,
[1:57:45] but we shall all be." Hallelujah.
[1:57:48] Somebody's got to fulfill that.
[1:57:50] Somebody's got to fulfill that word.
[1:57:55] So, let's leave this building just a
[1:57:57] minute.
[1:57:59] The day of your appeal has come up.
[1:58:02] Let's go to the courtroom.
[1:58:04] Can you imagine you've been waiting? Oh,
[1:58:06] glory. You've been waiting for this
[1:58:09] moment and now the time has come. I can
[1:58:13] imagine you're a nervous wreck
[1:58:16] and you come into the courtroom. Maybe
[1:58:18] you got your head down. It's real
[1:58:20] somber. And you walk over
[1:58:23] and you get behind your place where the
[1:58:25] defense is
[1:58:27] and you look over at your attorney
[1:58:30] and it's Jesus Christ.
[1:58:36] And then you take a glimpse over at the
[1:58:38] jury
[1:58:40] and it's Jesus Christ.
[1:58:44] Amen. And then you look up then you look
[1:58:47] on the throne
[1:58:51] and it's Jesus Christ.
[1:58:54] I don't know about you. I'm feeling
[1:58:56] better already. I said I'm feeling
[1:58:59] better already. He's my judge. He's my
[1:59:02] attorney. He's my jury. He's the alpha.
[1:59:05] He's the omega. He's the first. He's the
[1:59:08] last. He's the beginning. And he's the
[1:59:10] ending. He's got the final say. He's got
[1:59:12] the last word. He is the one that can
[1:59:15] actually declare your innocence.
[1:59:18] Hallelujah.
[1:59:20] Glory to God.
[1:59:24] It's three manifested in one.
[1:59:28] Hallelujah.
[1:59:30] Ain't that the way every believer sees
[1:59:32] him? I see one God.
[1:59:34] [Applause]
[1:59:41] The prosecutor
[1:59:43] which is blind, the prophet said
[1:59:48] the prosecutor's the devil
[1:59:53] the accuser
[1:59:56] is the devil
[1:59:58] and the star witness for the prosecution
[2:00:01] come on
[2:00:02] is the devil.
[2:00:08] So if you whoop the devil,
[2:00:11] if you defeat the devil, they're going
[2:00:14] to lose their prosecutor.
[2:00:16] They're going to lose their star
[2:00:17] witness.
[2:00:19] Hallelujah. They're going to lose
[2:00:21] everything. If that devil can become
[2:00:23] defeated, if Satan can be put under your
[2:00:25] feet, the prosecutor, the accuser, the
[2:00:29] witness is gone. There's nothing to
[2:00:32] stand against you.
[2:00:37] Now, the prosecutor,
[2:00:40] he's wanting to make a show out of this
[2:00:41] thing, man.
[2:00:43] So, they wants to get loud. He wants to
[2:00:45] get boisterous. He wants to tell you how
[2:00:48] wicked you are, how dirty you are, how
[2:00:51] sinful that you are. He wants to remind
[2:00:53] you of how many mistakes you made, all
[2:00:55] the shortcomings that you got. Say amen,
[2:00:56] somebody.
[2:01:00] And after he gets done of ripping and
[2:01:01] snorting and tearing and blowing and
[2:01:03] saying this and accusing that and
[2:01:04] pointing this finger,
[2:01:08] there stands the lamb. I mean the the
[2:01:10] defense attorney
[2:01:14] Hallelujah.
[2:01:16] And he says, "Father, I'd like to
[2:01:18] present some evidence on behalf of my
[2:01:21] client, which happens to be my son."
[2:01:24] Hallelujah.
[2:01:27] I'd like to present some evidence that
[2:01:29] has come up in this case. What is it?
[2:01:33] It's blood.
[2:01:38] I get dangerous about right now.
[2:01:42] What kind of evidence you want to
[2:01:43] present? I want to present a blood. And
[2:01:45] I want to say this, this blood has been
[2:01:48] kept. This blood has been sealed. This,
[2:01:51] let me tell you, this evidence has not
[2:01:53] been tampered with.
[2:01:55] [Applause]
[2:01:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:02:01] I want to present this blood. As a
[2:02:04] matter of fact, we've run samples on
[2:02:07] this blood.
[2:02:09] Matter of fact, we've looked so deep
[2:02:12] into this blood,
[2:02:14] we can not only tell you that our client
[2:02:17] is completely innocent, we can tell you
[2:02:19] who did it.
[2:02:22] [Applause]
[2:02:29] Prophet says like this on the token when
[2:02:32] he becomes both judge, jury and
[2:02:35] attorney,
[2:02:37] he he pleaded our case. We found guilty
[2:02:41] by his own law. He come back and took
[2:02:43] the guilty's person's place that was in
[2:02:45] the sanctuary. He took his sin. and he
[2:02:47] took it upon himself and died and paid
[2:02:49] the price and shed his blood and give
[2:02:50] back his own token, his own life.
[2:02:56] And the prophet stopped. He says, "While
[2:02:58] we're perfect,"
[2:03:00] he says, "the case,
[2:03:12] the case is dismissed.
[2:03:15] There is no more sin to the believer.
[2:03:20] Amen. He said there is the case and the
[2:03:23] case is dismissed.
[2:03:25] No more case to it. Then safely with the
[2:03:28] token applied when death begins to smite
[2:03:31] against the door out there, it has no
[2:03:33] control. So the same way when the death
[2:03:36] angel came through Egypt that night that
[2:03:38] if they had the blood of the lamb over
[2:03:41] the lentil, the death angel could not
[2:03:43] touch the firstborn. Let me say this.
[2:03:46] You're the firstborn, the church of the
[2:03:49] firstborn. And if you got the blood over
[2:03:51] your life, death cannot touch you.
[2:04:04] Invisible Union
[2:04:07] verdict.
[2:04:08] You never sinned at the first place.
[2:04:11] God don't even know.
[2:04:14] It's in the sea of forgetfulness.
[2:04:17] Anybody know what that sea is? The blood
[2:04:19] of Jesus Christ.
[2:04:21] It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:04:23] You never did it. You were accused of it
[2:04:27] by the accuser. But really from the
[2:04:30] beginning,
[2:04:32] I said from the beginning. God is not
[2:04:35] looking at you by time. He's not keeping
[2:04:38] up by time element. He's not keeping up.
[2:04:40] Are you hearing me? But actually, he
[2:04:42] looks at you not as you are. He looks at
[2:04:44] you always was
[2:04:48] really from the beginning, you were
[2:04:49] predestinated to be a son and a daughter
[2:04:53] of God.
[2:04:56] Hallelujah. Do you know why? There's a
[2:04:59] higher law that comes. The prophet tells
[2:05:02] us, let me close. He said everything on
[2:05:06] earth is under a law. Right? Even we
[2:05:10] live under a law. That's the reason when
[2:05:12] you're going down the road and God gives
[2:05:15] you grace and the speed limit's 55,
[2:05:17] grace is zero to 55.
[2:05:21] Amen.
[2:05:23] No, seriously, that's a quote.
[2:05:27] And you going over the law and you look
[2:05:29] in your rearview mirror and there's blue
[2:05:31] lights back there.
[2:05:34] That police officer does not pull you
[2:05:36] over and walk up to your window to
[2:05:40] congratulate you how good of a driver
[2:05:41] you are.
[2:05:44] I'm coming just to tell you how
[2:05:45] wonderful a day it is. And I'm just so
[2:05:47] happy and I wanted to pull you over to
[2:05:49] congratulate you. You're the 565th
[2:05:51] person that I pulled over today and I
[2:05:53] just want to tell you how wonderful I
[2:05:54] drive. You put your blinker on and you
[2:05:56] stopped at the stop sign and you did
[2:05:58] this and I just want to congrat Yeah.
[2:05:59] Right.
[2:06:02] The police officer represents the law.
[2:06:05] And his job, come on, is to enforce the
[2:06:08] law.
[2:06:12] But if you go below beyond the law,
[2:06:15] hallelujah. Right? Isn't it something
[2:06:18] that everything's under a law?
[2:06:21] Newton tells us that everything is under
[2:06:24] a law called the law of gravity.
[2:06:27] This handkerchief's under the law of
[2:06:29] gravity. Every time I let go of this
[2:06:31] handkerchief, what do you think's going
[2:06:32] to happen? Probably going to fall. And
[2:06:35] Newton said, "The law of gravity, every
[2:06:38] time that you do the same thing under
[2:06:40] the same circumstance, the law will do
[2:06:42] the exact same thing."
[2:06:44] And this was a lot of our lives right
[2:06:46] here. We're up and then we're down.
[2:06:48] We're up and then we're
[2:06:52] Amen. It's because the law of
[2:06:55] gravitation has effect and control on
[2:07:00] this and they tell us it controls it. It
[2:07:02] actually has the ability to controls it
[2:07:04] by the proportion of its size and its
[2:07:06] weight.
[2:07:07] So the heavier of weight of sin that it
[2:07:10] has,
[2:07:12] the more the law of gravity has an
[2:07:14] effect on it. Amen. Think about it.
[2:07:19] But if this anchor chip goes to fall and
[2:07:22] I catch it,
[2:07:25] if I catch it, do you know what
[2:07:27] happened? If some Oh, if something
[2:07:30] catches it, and something gets a hand on
[2:07:33] it, if something gets a hold of it, Oh,
[2:07:37] you need to help me right here. Help me
[2:07:39] bring it home. If something catches it,
[2:07:41] if something gets a hold of it, it
[2:07:43] interrupts the law of gravity on the
[2:07:46] handkerchief.
[2:07:48] And that interruption stops the fall.
[2:07:53] I said that interruption stops the fall.
[2:07:57] Hallelujah. That means that the law of
[2:07:59] gravity has become superseded by higher
[2:08:02] law.
[2:08:06] Can I tell you, Satan's been pulling on
[2:08:09] you since the day you was born. He
[2:08:11] pulled on you when you was a child. He
[2:08:13] pulled on you you when you was a
[2:08:14] teenager. He tried to drag you down and
[2:08:16] pull you down.
[2:08:19] But then something interrupted my fall.
[2:08:22] Oh, hallelujah. Something interrupted
[2:08:24] your fall. Something interrupted my
[2:08:26] fall. There was a higher law that
[2:08:28] superseded it.
[2:08:37] Yes, sir. The prophet tells us that an
[2:08:39] airplane will break gravity temporarily,
[2:08:42] right?
[2:08:44] He said, "But we're not living in the
[2:08:46] airplane age."
[2:08:51] [Applause]
[2:08:52] Because in the airplane age, gravity
[2:08:55] still has effect.
[2:08:57] But if you ever get sealed in,
[2:09:00] if you ever get sealed in to the rocket,
[2:09:03] I'm talking about that rocket that flew
[2:09:05] up there and it broke open and then it
[2:09:07] broke open again and it broke open. If
[2:09:09] you ever get sealed in behind the word,
[2:09:13] you can go to an atmosphere that is
[2:09:14] weightless.
[2:09:19] Do you realize that's one of the big
[2:09:20] things of the day today? people wants to
[2:09:22] get launched launched up there into
[2:09:24] space to where they can witness
[2:09:26] weightlessness.
[2:09:29] Well, let me just inform you. I don't
[2:09:32] know a long musk. I don't know anybody
[2:09:34] else. But let me tell you who I do know.
[2:09:36] I know the one who created
[2:09:37] weightlessness. I know the one that has
[2:09:40] superseded gravity. And he can take you
[2:09:42] while you are still on the earth. He can
[2:09:44] take you to an atmosphere where you are
[2:09:46] totally without sin whatsoever.
[2:09:49] Amen.
[2:09:56] Stand there for today.
[2:09:58] What do you think's going to happen on
[2:10:00] the morning of the rapture?
[2:10:04] He's fixing to be a rocket ride.
[2:10:08] I said there's fixing to be a rocket
[2:10:10] ride. A lot of people's looking for an
[2:10:12] airplane ride. I'm looking for a rocket
[2:10:14] ride.
[2:10:16] Amen. I said a lot of people's looking
[2:10:18] for airplanes. I'm looking for a rocket.
[2:10:20] I'm tired of this world. I'm tired of
[2:10:23] this place. I'm tired of this sin. I
[2:10:25] want to go to a place where there ain't
[2:10:27] none.
[2:10:30] Paul even tells us when it's going to
[2:10:33] happen.
[2:10:35] He said, "For the Lord himself
[2:10:38] shall descend from heaven with a shout."
[2:10:41] The voice of the archangel and the trump
[2:10:43] of God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:10:46] first. Hallelujah. Then when we which
[2:10:48] are alive and remain be caught up
[2:10:49] together with them in the clouds to meet
[2:10:51] the Lord, so shall we ever.
[2:10:55] When did Paul say that's going to
[2:10:56] happen? He said it's going to happen at
[2:10:59] the last trump.
[2:11:02] Now according to scripture, when Paul
[2:11:05] was speaking this, the people was
[2:11:07] trained to three trumpets.
[2:11:11] When they'd hear the first trumpet, the
[2:11:13] first trumpet meant get up. All right.
[2:11:17] Get ready. Pull up your stakes. Amen.
[2:11:21] Pack up. Get ready to go. When they
[2:11:25] heard the second trumpet sound, that
[2:11:27] means it's time to line up. Everybody
[2:11:30] gets in line. But then there's a third
[2:11:33] trumpet, which is the last trumpet. And
[2:11:35] the last trumpet is marching orders.
[2:11:38] [Music]
[2:11:40] And Paul said, "At the last trump, I
[2:11:42] want to tell you this. At the last
[2:11:43] trump, we may have been sitting on cell
[2:11:45] block D for a long time. But there's
[2:11:48] going to there's coming a day where you
[2:11:50] and I are literally going to be changed
[2:11:52] in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye. I
[2:11:55] want to say this. We've heard the first
[2:11:56] trumpet to get ready. We've heard the
[2:11:59] second trumpet. The bride must stay in
[2:12:01] line. But the last trumpet, hallelujah,
[2:12:04] the last trumpet means it's time to
[2:12:06] march. It's time to move. It's time to
[2:12:08] get out.
[2:12:14] Hallelujah.
[2:12:19] We've already heard the shout. Come on,
[2:12:21] somebody. We've already heard the shout.
[2:12:23] The shouts went out. It's to gather the
[2:12:26] living bride together.
[2:12:28] We're looking for a feast, a wedding
[2:12:31] supper in the sky.
[2:12:34] Oh, don't you want to be a part of it?
[2:12:36] Listen friends, don't let nothing keep
[2:12:38] you from it that day. No matter what you
[2:12:40] got to do, no matter what you got to go
[2:12:41] through, make sure you're ready. The
[2:12:44] preparation time is now. He's in the
[2:12:47] house. Sing it. Hallelujah. Don't Don't
[2:12:50] you want to go, friends? We've heard the
[2:12:53] message. We've got the truth. Now, it's
[2:12:57] time for the manifestation of sons
[2:13:00] because the books come open. Sons can go
[2:13:02] back into their rightful position.
[2:13:04] They can go back to the origination.
[2:13:06] Friends, what do you think the
[2:13:06] millennium's going to be? Sons back in
[2:13:10] their original positions. Hallelujah.
[2:13:13] Oh, I don't know about you. I'm glad I'm
[2:13:14] living the day of the fulfillment of
[2:13:17] Enoch's time.
[2:13:19] Hallelujah.
[2:13:22] Oh, help him sing it today.
[2:13:25] Weeping.
[2:13:28] They just laughed at Jesus when he said
[2:13:32] she's only sleeping. Think about it now.
[2:13:36] As he took her by the hand,
[2:13:40] she began to live again.
[2:13:44] Some began to praise the Lord. How about
[2:13:47] that be you today? Some began to say
[2:13:51] somebody tell it
[2:13:56] in the highest
[2:14:00] had to flee. It has to flee today. Now
[2:14:04] there is you're living in the greatest
[2:14:06] hour that every man in the Bible has
[2:14:08] looked for. Used to be.
[2:14:11] Now there is hope.
[2:14:16] [Music]
[2:14:17] or down.
[2:14:20] That's what I want to do right now. I
[2:14:23] want to lift my voice. I want to lift my
[2:14:25] hands. I want to praise him today.
[2:14:33] We were like that little girl
[2:14:36] said it all. Come on, somebody.
[2:14:40] Jesus touched this heart of mine. Yes,
[2:14:43] he did. gave me life again. Oh yes, just
[2:14:49] a house. Just a house of
[2:14:52] a blessed day.
[2:14:55] There's a light that shines. Somebody
[2:14:57] let it shine for all the world. Yes,
[2:15:01] Lord Jesus.
[2:15:04] [Applause]
[2:15:06] He's in the house.
[2:15:10] Death has to believe.
[2:15:13] And now there is Oh, hallelujah.
[2:15:18] Lord God, we receive it today, Lord. We
[2:15:21] receive your promises, Lord. Lord, we
[2:15:23] believe that we're the people of the
[2:15:25] rapture, Lord. We believe we're the ones
[2:15:27] that's going to fulfill the word. Praise
[2:15:30] his name. Yes. Praise
[2:15:34] his name.

[2:15:41] Hallelujah.
[2:15:43] Yes. Now there is light.
[2:15:47] I have light and darkness.
[2:15:51] Now there is hope. Yes. And there's no
[2:15:56] more now.

[2:16:02] Praise his name. Yes, I am.
[2:16:06] season.
[2:16:12] We were like that little remes.
[2:16:16] He was locked up on the sail. Glory to
[2:16:19] God. Jesus touched his heart of God.
[2:16:22] Hallelujah. Gave me life. Yes, he did.
[2:16:26] Hallelujah. I am just a house of just a
[2:16:30] born man
[2:16:32] at blessing the Lord.
[2:16:35] There's a light that shines in me
[2:16:38] for all the world to see.
[2:16:46] He's in the house.
[2:16:49] Get past.
[2:16:53] Now there is hallelujah. In darkness you
[2:16:58] praise the Lord.

[2:17:04] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:17:08] Praise his name. We're going to praise
[2:17:13] his name. Hallelujah.
[2:17:15] Praise his name. The bride's going to
[2:17:19] praise his name.
[2:17:27] He's in the house.
[2:17:31] Praise the Lord Jesus. Oh, somebody give
[2:17:34] a hand clap of praise today. Praise the
[2:17:37] Lord.
[2:17:39] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[2:17:44] Do you realize that there's a law on our
[2:17:47] books called double jeopardy?
[2:17:51] It's a legal term. It's a legal
[2:17:52] principle. And what it does is it
[2:17:55] prevents a defendant for being tried and
[2:17:59] punished for the same crime.
[2:18:03] So that means if your judgment was paid
[2:18:06] for,
[2:18:08] the double jeopardy law comes in effect
[2:18:10] on your life. You can never be judged
[2:18:15] again. Hallelujah.
[2:18:18] Hallelujah. You can never be judged
[2:18:22] again.
[2:18:24] Praise be to God. Oh, let's sing it like

[2:20:39] Jesus gave it to me.
[2:20:43] And I'm going to let it shine. Oh, I
[2:20:47] just feel like worshiping him a minute.

[2:22:08] him praise the Lord.

[2:24:00] [Applause]
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:07] I hope when I grow up I can preach like
[2:24:09] that.
[2:24:12] Don't you appreciate God's gifts? Amen.
[2:24:22] I saw a video clip on YouTube of a man
[2:24:25] that had been released just a couple
[2:24:28] months ago and he stood before a press
[2:24:32] corps as they were there and asking him.
[2:24:34] had been on in this uh penitentiary in
[2:24:37] prison for 37 years
[2:24:40] and he had said all along that he was
[2:24:43] innocent of the crime and that he wasn't
[2:24:46] even there but it was supposed to have
[2:24:49] been an eyewitness
[2:24:51] of course we know was blind
[2:24:57] just keep in mind your accuser and your
[2:24:59] eyewitness is blind
[2:25:03] who would take the word of a blind man
[2:25:05] to witness a case.
[2:25:08] So they bring this man up and he he's
[2:25:11] shaking. He's he's crying and uh you
[2:25:14] know that they want to say how how do
[2:25:16] you feel? How how do you feel? He said,
[2:25:19] "I don't know." He just kind of shugging
[2:25:21] his shoulders and and the man is so
[2:25:22] emotional and so torn up. And then
[2:25:26] someone finally asked him said, "Do you
[2:25:29] do you hate anybody?
[2:25:32] Do you do you hate the justice system?
[2:25:34] Do you is there anybody you want to get
[2:25:36] even with? He said, "No,
[2:25:38] I just want to enjoy life."
[2:25:45] That's what Jesus made us for.
[2:25:49] Aren't you glad you're free today?
[2:25:53] He took your place.
[2:25:57] You can lock
[2:26:00] me up
[2:26:03] in a prison.
[2:26:06] We sing it together now
[2:26:09] and throw
[2:26:12] away
[2:26:15] the king.
[2:26:17] [Music]
[2:26:21] Take
[2:26:23] away
[2:26:26] my vision.
[2:26:29] [Music]
[2:26:31] From these eyes
[2:26:34] that now
[2:26:37] can see.
[2:26:39] [Music]
[2:26:42] deprived
[2:26:45] me of
[2:26:48] the food
[2:26:51] I need
[2:26:54] and even
[2:26:59] my hands
[2:27:02] and feet.
[2:27:04] But as long
[2:27:07] as I
[2:27:10] I know Jesus
[2:27:13] [Music]
[2:27:15] and I
[2:27:18] could still hallelujah
[2:27:21] everybody now.
[2:27:24] Oh,
[2:27:26] he said that I
[2:27:29] could still
[2:27:32] go free.
[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:36] Hallelujah.
[2:27:38] What kind
[2:27:40] of a man aren't you glad to be will

[2:27:48] and do this for me?
[2:27:56] Even me.
[2:28:00] know
[2:28:02] I'm worthy
[2:28:04] to live
[2:28:07] and not fit
[2:28:10] to kill.
[2:28:12] But the man on
[2:28:15] the cross
[2:28:17] had your name written under the seven
[2:28:21] sea
[2:28:23] and said that I
[2:28:26] I could still
[2:28:29] [Music]
[2:28:32] [Applause]
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:35] I knew
[2:28:37] you could
[2:28:40] quite I don't
[2:28:43] understand
[2:28:45] why a great king
[2:28:48] would leave
[2:28:51] heaven.
[2:28:53] [Music]
[2:28:57] put on. Think of it the robe
[2:29:02] of an earthly
[2:29:05] man.
[2:29:08] feel pain
[2:29:10] of flesh
[2:29:13] and bone
[2:29:18] into later
[2:29:22] trunk
[2:29:23] of that long
[2:29:29] that led
[2:29:32] to Calary
[2:29:36] or our brothers.
[2:29:37] [Applause]
[2:29:38] Oh,

[2:30:23] Hallelujah. Thank you do this for me.
[2:30:30] Oh, hallelujah for you and me.

[2:30:47] Hallelujah.
[2:30:50] The man on that cross.
[2:30:55] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:30:58] He said that I
[2:31:02] I could still
[2:31:05] go free.
[2:31:12] Hallelujah.
[2:31:15] Thank you, Lord Jesus.

[2:31:24] more before we go. Can we?
[2:31:28] The sun was hot.
[2:31:31] Angry moth
[2:31:34] gathered by the gray stone building.
[2:31:43] Great
[2:31:45] with his crew
[2:31:48] stepped out on his balcony.
[2:31:57] nervously washing his hands to rid him
[2:32:01] of the blood.
[2:32:04] Pilot never
[2:32:07] washed away.
[2:32:13] His wrinkled brows showed the worried
[2:32:17] lies.
[2:32:20] I heard P say
[2:32:25] [Music]
[2:32:28] I find no fault
[2:32:30] in this man called Jesus the healer from
[2:32:35] the shores of Galilee.
[2:32:39] Glory.
[2:32:41] But I command you to ask me to let him
[2:32:45] go free.
[2:32:47] Don't make me take his blood to the
[2:32:50] grave with me.
[2:32:54] [Music]
[2:32:56] Nervously washing his hands
[2:33:00] to rid him of the blood.
[2:33:03] He would never wash away.
[2:33:09] Oh Lord God,
[2:33:14] they cried for the blood of this
[2:33:16] innocent man.
[2:33:18] But I heard,
[2:33:21] oh my, oh glory. Oh, and it was midnight
[2:33:28] in the middle of the day.
[2:33:36] Trembling solders knelt before his
[2:33:41] cross.
[2:33:47] The whole world shook. The veil was ran
[2:33:52] as a sinless Christ was slain.
[2:33:57] And it was midnight
[2:34:02] in the middle of the day. Oh,
[2:34:05] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:34:08] And thunder roll across the rock.
[2:34:17] Hallelujah.
[2:34:19] Lightning burn like a fire across the
[2:34:24] sea.
[2:34:28] But on the holy hills the angels wave a
[2:34:35] crimson flag of triumph.
[2:34:39] They shouted death.
[2:34:47] Good Lord.
[2:34:49] Don't you know that death is swallowed
[2:34:53] up in victory?
[2:34:57] Glory to God. Glory to God. Victory.
[2:35:02] Oh, hallelujah. Let's sing it again.
[2:35:04] Thunder road.
[2:35:06] Oh, thunder roll across the rock
[2:35:11] mountain.
[2:35:16] And lightning burn like a fire across
[2:35:21] the sea.
[2:35:27] On the holy hills, the angels
[2:35:32] a crimson ling.
[2:35:39] [Music]
[2:35:47] Don't you know that death is following
[2:35:53] victory?
[2:35:57] You are his victory.
[2:36:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:09] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:13] You imagine Paul in describing the
[2:36:15] resurrection and he says when this is
[2:36:18] brought to pass
[2:36:20] then will come to pass this saying
[2:36:23] death is swallowed up in victory
[2:36:26] not at the resurrection of the Lord
[2:36:28] Jesus
[2:36:30] but at the rapture of the church.
[2:36:34] Oh what a day friends. Hadn't it been
[2:36:37] awesome for us to be here together these
[2:36:39] few days?
[2:36:42] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:46] Praise the Lord.
[2:36:49] Let me just express a few thank yous and
[2:36:52] a few appreciations and then we'll let
[2:36:53] you go. We want to say thank each of you
[2:36:57] visitors that's been with us in our
[2:36:58] gates and hopefully you've felt welcome
[2:37:01] and and at home. Uh also want to thank
[2:37:04] the deacons for all their help during
[2:37:07] this time. All the brothers on the
[2:37:09] parking lot that helped you to park and
[2:37:11] to be able to show you where to go and
[2:37:13] out there in that heat. We so appreciate
[2:37:15] that. All the singers, the musicians,
[2:37:19] song leaders, the ministry brothers, um
[2:37:22] the sisters that help prepare the little
[2:37:25] bag lunch things for you. And we'll have
[2:37:27] a meal for you over here in the
[2:37:28] fellowship hall once we close here. And
[2:37:32] if I've missed anybody else, we
[2:37:34] appreciate you, too.
[2:37:36] But it's we call them special meetings
[2:37:39] of course not just here but other
[2:37:40] churches where you go and they are
[2:37:41] special. We could have these three
[2:37:43] brothers here and they would have come
[2:37:44] and preached just for our church. But
[2:37:47] why in the world would we want to keep
[2:37:48] you all from being here?
[2:37:51] You what help makes it special.
[2:37:58] And we want to thank most of all our
[2:38:01] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for saving
[2:38:05] us, redeeming us, calling us together in
[2:38:08] the opaces of the message of the hour.
[2:38:11] And I've said it so many times, the
[2:38:12] local church probably gets tired of
[2:38:14] hearing me say it, but I want to thank
[2:38:16] him for our place here that he's given
[2:38:18] to us after all these years. It had been
[2:38:20] years over at the old church at Happy
[2:38:22] Valley before we'd even been able to
[2:38:24] have a special meeting because our
[2:38:26] people filled it up. We had no place to
[2:38:28] set anybody and no place to park the
[2:38:30] cars, but the Lord has helped us to be
[2:38:32] able to have this place. And we're just
[2:38:35] so thankful and so grateful that we
[2:38:38] could come together once again. Let's
[2:38:40] just bow our heads together and we'll
[2:38:42] pray over the food. And
[2:38:45] Lord Jesus,
[2:38:46] it has been such an awesome three days,
[2:38:49] Father.
[2:38:51] Lord, Brother Matt, open it up for us.
[2:38:53] And I just believe that you'd done great
[2:38:55] things, Father, in that service. I've
[2:38:57] already heard so many people talking
[2:38:59] about it that it helped them. Then Lord,
[2:39:02] Brother Daryl bringing to us, Father, a
[2:39:04] message of faith. And the prayer line
[2:39:06] was so wonderful. And we're believing
[2:39:08] for great things that happened. Then
[2:39:11] Lord, today our brother David been able
[2:39:13] to get out of the way. And Lord, just
[2:39:15] remind us who we are. So when we leave
[2:39:18] this place today, we can take the
[2:39:20] assurance in our heart the case is
[2:39:23] dismissed.
[2:39:25] We're thankful, Lord. As we go now to
[2:39:28] partake of some natural food, we just
[2:39:30] ask that you'd bless it, sanctifying to
[2:39:32] our bodies, and Lord, we have a little
[2:39:34] time together of fellowship. And we pray
[2:39:36] that you just watch over your children.
[2:39:38] Many of them will be start heading home
[2:39:39] north, south, east, west this afternoon,
[2:39:42] some leaving out tomorrow.
[2:39:45] It always hurts our hearts when we have
[2:39:47] to say goodbye.
[2:39:49] We weren't made to say goodbye like
[2:39:51] this. No doubt if we have this meeting
[2:39:53] again next year, there'll be some that
[2:39:55] will have already gone to glory and some
[2:39:57] that'll maybe not have the opportunity
[2:39:59] to come back. And we'll never have this
[2:40:01] same setting again. But we're longing
[2:40:04] for the day. We'll all be gathered
[2:40:06] together up at your house. Father, we'll
[2:40:09] all be young and we'll all be new and
[2:40:11] changed. and we'll all get to see you
[2:40:14] face to face. Keep us by your grace.
[2:40:18] Father, watch over us and keep us until
[2:40:21] that time. In the name of Jesus Christ,
[2:40:23] we pray. Amen. We appreciate the
[2:40:26] musicians that have played and helped
[2:40:28] and been singers.
[2:40:32] Amen.
[2:40:34] Praise the Lord.
[2:40:37] Some God bless you. You can be
[2:40:39] dismissed. You can make your way out
[2:40:41] these doors here over to the fellowship
[2:40:42] hall if you haven't been there and
[2:40:44] they'll have the food there ready for
[2:40:45] you. God bless you. We love you so much.
[2:40:48] In the name of Jesus, you can be
[2:40:50] dismissed. You called the son to
[2:40:54] rest.
[2:40:58] You lay it down to rest.
[2:41:05] You hold this heart of mine.
[2:41:13] You hold my every
[2:41:17] breath. You're such an awesome God.
[2:41:22] So mighty,
