And all our streamers locally and around the world, we want to say we welcome them to this service. Also, give our visitors and our streamers a real good hand tonight. If you will, [applause] praise the Lord. [applause] If you don't mind to stand with me just for a few minutes, we don't have that many requests. Uh, Sister Ruth Louise Jax is requesting prayer for her daughter. She is pregnant with twins and they're just asking that the Lord would let everything be all right on her behalf. Sister Connie Kingston says, "Please remember me in prayer. I fell and fractured my arm." We'll be going in next week for surgery. So, we certainly want to pray for her tonight. Want to continue to remember Brother Samuel Sheffller in prayer that the Lord just work out all the details in his life. God's able to fix all those situations, isn't he? Amen. Sister Diana wants us to remember her niec's baby boy, Cassidy. I hope I got that name right. He's 8 months old with a rare cancer. They are starting radiation now and concerned it could cause him to be deformed as he grows. Thank you so much for your prayer. So we certainly want to remember that prayer request tonight as we pray an unspoken prayer request for Aaron Scott. Brother Rudy, sister Nina sends that in. So let's remember Aaron tonight as we pray. Then we have this testimony. This is from brother Curtis Hunnel. Says, "Praise the Lord. God has healed my hip. I can walk now." Isn't that great? Ain't that great? [applause] He wants to thank all of you for your prayers, your love, kindness, food, mailing of cards, texts, and phone calls. God bless you all. So, we appreciate Brother Curtis tonight. Thank the Lord that he's received a touch from the master. Amen. How many of you have a need tonight you'd like for this group to pray about? We just want to commit all these things unto the Lord as we approach this this season and things going on, the hustle and the bustle of all that's going on. We just want to we want to stay balanced and we want to stay in love with the Lord and we want to love each other. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just at Christmas time. We want to love each other all the time, don't we? &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and tell them and say this right, brother, sister, I love you in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me make just a few announcements tonight. We will be having service, a special service on Saturday, December the 27th that will include communion and footwashing. The service will begin at 6:00. So remember that announcement tonight. Also, Christmas cards from Brother Donnie and Sister Carol are available in the library. You still have some of those, Brother Keith. One per family until further notice. Remember that tonight if you will. And all the trustees are going to be a meeting tonight after the service. Remember that a trustee meeting tonight after the service. Let's just sing that chorus one more time. What a lovely name. &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus. A lot of people took his name in vain today. A lot of people take his name in vain every day that they live. But I'm so glad we call on that name with reverence and respect because he is the greatest thing that ever got a hold of our life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "It's the truth." Anyhow, praise the Lord. Is what a lovely name the name of [music] Jesus reaching higher far [singing] than [music] the brightest [singing] star. Oh, and sweeter [music] than the songs they sing in heaven. Let the world [music] proclaim. Brother John, if you'd come, Brother John Hornac, sing it one more time if you will. Oh yes. Now, what a lovely name. The name of Jesus, reaching higher far [music] than the brightest star. Oh, it's sweeter than the songs they [music] sing in heaven. Let the world [music and singing] proclaim. What a lovely [music] name. And we love this guy right here, too, don't we? Brother John. Brother John, just want you to know this. This assembly is praying for your boy. I believe God's going to fix everything. &gt;&gt; I believe God's going to fix everything. He never said, "Did you feel it?" He said, "Do you believe it?" How many of you believe that God's going to help this man's boy? &gt;&gt; Just a wonderful family this guy's got right here. &gt;&gt; We love you, buddy. Appreciate you praying. Have to cry. [laughter] He is doing better. Let's keep praying. We're uh we we have I guess is a good opportunity to tell you we we've been to the doctor about several things with him uh his neck and we think that maybe there's some correlation there between his his his neck is in he's got the the neck of a 54 year old at 14. So unless Lord moves there, he's he's got a long way to go with that too. But maybe there's a correlation between that and his stomach and all that. But we've seen some improvement. Some is not all. And we're believing for all. &gt;&gt; So just keep that in mind. And just remember he's 14 and he's dealing with all this. &gt;&gt; So that's a lot. He can't go to school. He just, you know, that's a lot for a young man to deal with. So and a lot for his mama and me a little too. So if you would just just keep believing Lord more than able. He's more than able. &gt;&gt; And not only more than able, but more than willing. &gt;&gt; Just help us find that faith where we need to be and watch him work. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we love you, Father. There's no doubt in our minds, no no question in our hearts, Father, how real you are and how awesome you are and how many things we've seen you do time and time and time again, Lord. And just because we're waiting doesn't mean that you're not moving, Lord. We believe with all our hearts, with each request that I hold in my hand, Lord, that you're mindful. Lord, I think of the sparrow. Lord, think of your scripture and you you're mindful of the sparrow. Lord, surely you you care about sons and daughters and their well-being and and how it each sickness and each situation, Lord. It affects not only them, Lord, but the family and the loved ones and the the church family, Lord. Lord Jesus, you're an awesome God. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt. &gt;&gt; There's no question, Lord, not only for Lincoln, Lord Jesus, but for each request that I hold in my hand. You're mindful, Lord. And Lord, if we're concerned about it, what kind of God would you be if you weren't? But Lord Jesus, we know that you're concerned and not worried, just just concerned that we we have questions or doubts, Lord. So we believe that you're here to to push all those away that we can look promise right in the face and accept it and believe it, Lord. And Lord Jesus, we're not only asking for healings and different situations and things, Lord Jesus, in our lives, Lord, but we're longing to hear more of you. &gt;&gt; We're longing, Lord Jesus, honestly, Lord, that's the most important thing, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; So, I want to draw closer to you. I want to know you more cuz I know that if I get to know you more, then I'll be able to see myself more. Lord, we're just longing for it. I pray that you'd help us put it aside every weight and every measure, every thought of the day. Lord, I come running from work and and I just want to put all that aside and focus and concentrate on you. I want to worship you, Lord. I pray that you would help each musician in the in the songs that we sing, Lord. May it bring you honor and glory and praise, Lord. &gt;&gt; Just anoint each and every part. Father, we love you. We thank you for it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just share this with you tonight. I was up at uh Valley Forge auction house today. Glenn and I uh brother Donnie had prayed and preached with a prayer cloth for Willie McVeyy's wife. She's facing cancer surgery uh next month and uh got to have a kidney removed. And I gave him that prayer. that prayer cloth and he just melted. He was so so thankful. And you know what? If we're standing here tonight, we can walk, we can talk, we can go look around, we've got friends, we've got a place to go to tonight and lay down and go to sleep. We are so thankful. &gt;&gt; We want to be more thankful, right? &gt;&gt; How many of you feel like we could all be more thankful? And you know, to be able to go to church with you folks right here, how thankful how thankful we ought to be. &gt;&gt; God's put us together for a reason. &gt;&gt; He don't make no junk. &gt;&gt; You're all you're all just diamonds in the rough. Even you. [laughter] Praise the Lord. Well, let's sing a song tonight. We want to give him thanks. How many of you feel thankful tonight? &gt;&gt; Let's sing it if you will.

Give our singers a nice hand as they get ready to sing. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; You are perfection. You have [singing] no [music] flaws at all. When you came [music and singing] to earth, you had your choice of [singing] where you could have been born. So why [singing] choose a [music] stable if you are [singing] able to choose royalty? And I [singing] like to [music] believe it was to [singing] show me that a perfect king can live in imperfect [singing and music] things. M. So if [music and singing] you're looking for a place to rest, oh, here [music] is [singing] my request. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'm not fit for a [singing] king, but if you want to live in me, [music] then make [singing] my heart your own. I [music] don't have [singing] silver or gold, and you deserve a better throne. [music] Still, I'm [singing] the one you chose. Make my heart yours. Oh, [music] [singing] [music] [music] you are so [singing] holy. [music] Oh, the earth bows at [singing] your voice. [music] all knowing [singing and music] king born for suffering but still [singing] you made your [music] choice so why [singing] choose a manger [music] when you're the creator of [singing and music] everything when I [singing] feel so unworthy [music] me. Oh, you remind me [singing] that a perfect king [music] can live in perfect things. So, if you're [music] looking for a [singing] place to rest, oh, here [singing] is my request. [music] I'm not fit for a king, [singing and music] but if you want to live in me, then [singing] make my heart your own. [music] I don't have silver or gold, [singing] and you deserve a better throne. Still, I'm the [music and singing] one you chose. Make my heart. [singing] [music] [singing] Oh, [music] make my [singing] heart. Oh. [singing] your home. [singing] [music] Make my heart your home. [music] Ooh. Oh. [singing] So, if [music] you're looking for a place to rest, [singing] oh, here is my [singing] request. [music] [music] I'm not fit for a [singing] king. But if [music] you want to live in me, then make [singing] my heart your home. [music] I don't have silver or [singing] gold, and you deserve a better throne. Still, I'm the one you [singing] chose. Make my heart your home. [music] [singing] Oh, make [singing and music] my heart your home. Oh, [applause] [applause] words up there. Uh, brothers, can you pull up the the words to Almost Home? Brother Oal Reese asked me to sing this. If y'all can help me and make it a a congregation, it'll be a whole lot better. It's not a Christmas song, but I believe it's a lot of what Christmas was about. &gt;&gt; Christmas was about him making our heart fit for him to live in us. I was listening to brother Brown today and preaching in 49 about deity being in us and I [music] was thinking Lord he preached that in 49 and I still ain't got it [laughter] not the way he preached it but at the end of it he just I love his simplicity [snorts] at the end of it he said let's just have a testimony he said just a three or four testimony said can somebody say I love Jesus and it just people started just here and there saying I love Jesus and it Just I don't know. Can anybody here say, "I love Jesus." &gt;&gt; I love Jesus. &gt;&gt; Ain't you glad he came? [music] &gt;&gt; Are you disappointed? [music] Are you desperate for help? [music] You know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself. [music] You start to believe you don't have what it [music] takes cuz it's all you [singing] can do just to move [music] much less finish the race. But don't forget [music] what lies ahead. Almost home, brother. It won't [singing] be long. Soon all our burdens [singing and music] will be gone. Oh, with all your strength, sister, run on free. [music] Hold up your head. Keep [singing] pressing on. We are almost home. [music] Well, this road will be hard, but we [music] win [singing] in the end simply because it's Jesus in us. It's not if, but when. So [music] take joy in the [singing] journey even when it feels [music] long [singing] and find strength in each step. Knowing heaven [music] is cheering you on. [singing] We are almost [singing] home. Brother, [music] it won't be [singing] long. Soon all our burdens will be gone. [singing] Oh, [music] with all your strength, sister, run all around free. Hold [music] up your head. Keep pressing on. We [music] are almost home. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; We're almost [music] home. We're almost home. [singing] [music] I know that the cross has brought heaven to us. But make no [music] mistake, there's still more to [singing] come when our flesh and our bones [music] are no longer between. who we are right now and where we're meant to be. [music] When all has been lost, made whole again. These tears and [music] this pain no longer [singing] exists. No more walking. We're running as fast as [music] we can. Consider this our second way. [music] We're almost home, brother. It won't be long. [music] Soon all our burdens will be gone. [singing] [music] Oh, with all your strength, sisters, run on, run free. [music] Hold up your head. Keep pressing [singing] on. We are almost home. We're almost home. We're almost home. [singing] We are almost home. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's not just a nice song. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. We don't just know that by looking at us and what God is doing in us and what God is doing through us and the desire that we have. But we look and see on the other side out there. Remember there's two great kings. Both of them have wives. Both of those kings are gods. Two gods, two kings, &gt;&gt; two wives. King God and the God of this evil age. &gt;&gt; He's only a god because he's worshiped by the people, &gt;&gt; not because he's a creator. Remember, God is an object of worship. &gt;&gt; And Satan is a god, &gt;&gt; but he's not mine. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But he is the god of this evil age. If you listen to that title of that sermon, you listen to it and you hear the prophet say he's worshiped by millions and billions &gt;&gt; of people. Isn't that something? People would worship a God that ain't got a heaven to take him to. &gt;&gt; A god that couldn't create a fly. &gt;&gt; A god that can't heal them. A god that don't love them. And yet they give him their whole heart and soul. &gt;&gt; My my don't make any sense to me. Does it? &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can't relate to it. God bless you. Let's turn to Genesis 24. Said all that to lay a foundation for the direction we're going to go tonight. So keep in mind that when we go from Genesis right on to the book of Revelation that there's two great powers that are influencing the people on the earth. And everybody on the earth is under the influence of one or the other. And in that influence there can be people with different motives, different objectives. Just like with the devil, the devil is the king of politics. And yet people on either side of the aisle of whichever side of the aisle you're on when it comes to politics, they'll fuss and fight and argue and debate and they've still got one head, &gt;&gt; the devil. &gt;&gt; So it ain't like God is the God of the Republican party and the devil's the God of the Democratic Republic. &gt;&gt; Depends on which one you are. Of course, you think God's on your side. &gt;&gt; Actually, God is not the God of either one of them. &gt;&gt; The devil is the God of politics. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But in that he diversifies and so does God. So God has different people with different makeups, different callings and that sometimes can be very confusing to people and it's hard for people to imagine. But the fastest growing religion in the world of course is Islam. And whenever you study the history of it, you realize how rotten and corrupt that it really is. But yet the same God of Islam is the exact same God of Christianity in the denominational system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, they would never think they were on the same side, but they are. &gt;&gt; Not only that, but people around this message that don't take the full word are just as bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It don't matter to God. It doesn't really matter to God. which verse of scripture that you don't believe whether it's Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; The real bride believes every word he says. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now watch this this antitype as great as this messenger that we're going to read about was gifted gifted by by Abraham but also gifted by God. called by Abraham, called by God, endowt with treasure by Abraham and by God. But yet, as great as he was, he could not be able to bring a bride on his own strength. As gifted as brother Brandham was, never a gentile like him, never a prophet on the earth like him. But even as great as that was, it took more than that. &gt;&gt; It took the angels of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It took the angels of God. Now remember, Eleazar went, but he was confused about, "Should I take him there if she won't come?" He said, "Oh, no, no. The angel of the Lord will go before you." So, he was not adequate enough within himself. Neither is Brother Brennham. Neither is your pastor. Neither's any other preacher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither will Satan's bride consummate wind up being in hell just on her own corruption. &gt;&gt; She will be influenced by demons. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Them demons will deceive. Them demons will motivate them. So both brides under the headship of God and the God of this evil age have angels working for them &gt;&gt; to bring their bride &gt;&gt; to them. &gt;&gt; I'm glad I just know which one I'm on whose side I'm on. &gt;&gt; And Abraham was old and well stricken in age. And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, put I pray thee, thy hand under my side, and I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son, to the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell. But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son, the three m, my country, my kindred, my son Isaac. And the servant said unto him, per adventure, the woman will not be willing to follow me into this revealed word of the hour. must thy needs bring thy son again into the land from which you come out of. Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins." So God wouldn't call us out, and then send us back in. &gt;&gt; And Abraham said unto him, "Beware that thou bring not my son thither again. The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, which spake unto me, that swear unto me, saying unto thy seed, will I give this land." He shall send his angel before thee. So it would not have been enough for Eleazar to went by himself. Neither would it been enough had brother Brandham came. Why would God send an angel and meet him in that sacred place where he was? And he's down praying and out of this light he sees them feet of the angel of God. Wonder why an angel. So then you realize what a lot of other preachers then had to do in that age. They would also have to say that they had an angel &gt;&gt; because that's one of the things that separated him &gt;&gt; was the angel. Wasn't just a preacher. wasn't just a prophet, wasn't just a prophesier, but he had an angel to accompany him. So then other men in that age and some thereafter, they must say the same thing. Why? Because that will raise them above their brethren, &gt;&gt; uhoh, &gt;&gt; and put them on the level that very few men ever get to walk on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They communicate with angels &gt;&gt; and they talk to them according to them and angels talk back. and so on and so on. [clears throat] Notice this. He shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son. I want you to notice he said. Well, maybe it'll work out. I don't know. I mean, I'm praying that it will. I'm just kind of hoping if I go to all this trouble. No, look how positive he is. He shall &gt;&gt; send his angel before thee. And thou shalt &gt;&gt; take a wife. &gt;&gt; That's right. unto my son from then. If Abraham could be that positive, how much more positive was our God? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I may like to be remembered tonight as we pray. God bless you. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, to be living in this day. We're so grateful, Lord Jesus, for what we see that you have done in the days and the ages gone by. It was marvelous the things that you have done. But Lord, how grateful we are that we live in a day that in reality is greater than them all. Oh, it have been wonderful to live in the days of Peter, James, and John and Paul and all of that. But that was the alpha church. That was the church in its beginning. But here we are, Lord God, the going home time. We thank you for the this day that we live. Speak to us tonight from your word. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. Turn with me to Daniel chapter 10 verse 13. [clears throat] So remember, Satan is not God in the realm that he could create. Uh so he's a powerless being although an object of worship. &gt;&gt; But your car could be that. Your piano could be that. Your house could be that. All kinds of things you could make a god out of. &gt;&gt; So you put them before the Lord. They are your God. But Satan is a powerless god when it would be to to say that he is omnipotent because he's not omnisient. He's not uh being everywhere at one time, same time. He's not none of that. It cannot create cannot do many things that almighty god can do. that he is a god and that he is worshiped by millions and billions of people. So whenever he was able to convince the angels in the beginning and he exalted himself above them and preached to them and then whenever he got these angels to believe his lie, they separated away from the presence of God. Now there was a a divine hierarchy that God had given them by creation. Gave them their power, their authority, their ability of what they would be able to do. God placed them in ranks. And whenever they fell, they actually did not lose that rank. I want you to think that some of the angels that fail actually had higher rank than the ones who didn't fall. &gt;&gt; So it's not like that when they fell and backslid they lost everything. No, they did not lose everything. You see, that's why that preachers, singers, religious people can be gifted of God to do all kinds of things and then they can actually backslide, get away from the Lord, and it's not like they lose everything. How many preachers stand in the pull pit every week and preach and do their duty and in their hearts as backslid as they can be? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And sometimes it'll be years before that ever comes out and people find out, oh my goodness, he was doing this, he was doing that. He was living this way, living that way. Why? Because he never lost that. God gave it to him and it was there whether he was serving God or wasn't serving God. So these angels then that forfeited what the Bible calls their estate. Now it was not land of course, houses and things as we would know, but it was an allocation that God gave to them. Now they are held in chains unto everlasting darkness. So they'll never be able to rise above where they've fallen from. But it doesn't mean that they cannot appear, disappear just like the angels of God can. There's some of them right here in this building tonight. Them demons are right here. And they can appear, disappear, make themselves appear as angels of light. They can anoint people with their anointing. They can actually get into people's mouths with their anointing and uh be so convincing that they would lead people astray in the name of the Lord. And they would say, "Thus sayaeth the Lord." Cuz thus sayeth the Lord, just repeating it doesn't bother demons. They're not afraid. They're not afraid at all to go to church. They like church, unless of course it's a devil casting out church. They don't like them as much. But they're not afraid to get around people that believe in God. They're not afraid to attend a tape meeting. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're not afraid to attend our special meetings, our youth meetings. They're not afraid at all. But what they become afraid of is when the spirit of God will take the cover off of them and God will illuminate you to help you to see who you are and also to see who they are and greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. Now they don't like that and they actually are afraid. Now think about it that demons can become afraid. that when they're going to be exposed, they become very fearful. And they also when God is going to illuminate something about their plan, something that they're in the process of doing that really gets them fired up. Now, God had to send an angel of God that would forerun this great messenger, and he's coming to get a bride for Isaac. And it was more than Ezer, more than the gifts, more than all of that. There had to be an angelic anointing that would come and release her from the hole that she had been raised in all of her entire life. Now watch, let's bring it over now to the book of Daniel, chapter 10, verse 13. Now, we know the story here as we looked at a little bit last Wednesday night that [clears throat] Daniel has been praying because he had learned by the reading of the books of Jeremiah that there was an allocation of time. The children of Israel was going to go down into this captivity state and they were going to be there for a certain period of time, 70 years. And he knew by reading the prophets books. &gt;&gt; Now some people in that day might have said, "Why in the world are you reading the books of that dead man?" &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Why would you sit around and read them books when that man's been gone now for about 65 years? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That man's been gone for years and years. But Daniel knew he had the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Daniel starts praying and fasting and seeking God about the time frame where they were. Now remember, King Cyrus was the king that God had prophesied through Isaiah about himund something years before he was ever born. It was through an edict of King Cyrus. I'd like to go through some of that all with with you sometime. But it was through Cyrus that God had began to move on their heart for restoration to build the temple back. And yet there was more to be done. So it went from one king to another king, from one prophet to another prophet. And now it was time for another loosing of that prophesied word. So Daniel was praying and praying, and you've remembered that he had prayed for three weeks now. So he'd been praying, fasting, seeking the face of God, heard no answer whatsoever. And no doubt he was troubled. God, have I done something or is there something wrong with me? Maybe. Because the first thing is, as I read to you last week, that the angel, the Lord, one of the first things that he said to Daniel was he gave him an explanation why he hadn't been there the first day. So it must have been very troubling to Daniel. And you think how beloved this man was that an angel of God wanted to explain to him why he wasn't even there. So let's read now in Daniel 10:3. But the prince of [snorts] the kingdom of Persia withtood me one and 20 days. Now remember who this angel is that's talking. It's Gabriel. Gabriel, patron angel of the Jews. So, we're talking about a very high ranking angel that never fell. And yet when Daniel was praying and Gabriel is on his way down to bring to him that which was noted in the scripture and when he broke into the kingdom of Persia a demon which was an original angel which ranked an authority higher than Gabriel. Still, [snorts] even though he had fallen, he outranked Gabriel and withtood Gabriel. Now, as we looked at it last week, that these demons actually will get on leaders, prime ministers, presidents, rulers of nations. So when the UN gets together and here's Bulgaria, you know, here's Germany, here's America, here's Israel, here's uh, you know, all these different nations and they're there, but you're only seeing the representative of that kingdom. But in another realm, demons are also at the UN. And those demons will begin to anoint their mouthpieces, whether it's a president or prime minister or whatever they call their representative in their country, and they will start arguing and going back and forth and debating and and arguing and hating and and all of that. Now watch what what's happening here in the kingdom is that he said the prince of the kingdom of Persia withtood me one and 20 days but lo Michael which means to be like God lo Michael one of the chief now watch the rank one of the chief princes came to help me. Gabriel needed help. &gt;&gt; Well, I'll tell you one thing, friends. If Gabriel needed it, I guarantee everybody in this building tonight needs it. &gt;&gt; But at least Gabriel had enough sense to accept help. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is astounding to me. Now he says, "Michael, one of the chief princes came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia." And now remember what was going on was that Simbes which was the son of Cyrus. There was uh uh many different delegates of the provinces of the kingdom and they would come in for these meetings. And when they would, it was like politics today, of course. They would try to get this man on their side and that man and that man and that man. And they would give them gifts and they would promise them certain things. If we can have your vote, then we'll we'll do this for you and if we can have your vote and we'll just just like it is today cuz it's the same king that runs it. &gt;&gt; And what they were doing, there was this demon of the kingdom of Persia, which had been chosen by Satan many years prior to this. and he would be the one that would anoint the Mes and the Persians and they would merge together and make the kingdom called the Miso Persia. But it's running now down to the end of that kingdom. But this demon was still the one in hierarchy and he was the one over this part of the prophecy of God to try to keep it from happening. Now they were getting together and Cyrus heart had already been touched toward the Jews. But this demon of Persia was trying his best since Cyrus kind of leaned that way. He's trying to use the provincial leaders, the magistrates, we'd call them today prime ministers and all of that. and he's trying to anoint their thinking and they're going to come against Cyrus because Satan don't want God's word for the hour to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; So, he's going to attack the word. And if Daniel the prophet, if he can be [clears throat] hindered from receiving the timeline, then the rest of the people there will not be able to know it. Because if God is going to do anything, he's going to reveal his secret to the servants, his servants, the prophets. So they could have read it over and over and over again, and they would have never got it. So here was God's here was God's dimensional mouthpiece that could break into the realm of God and be able to get the timeline for the prophecy. Now, it laid in the word, but it didn't do any good if somebody wasn't able to place it in the right timeline. I hope somebody's hearing me tonight. &gt;&gt; You see, it's the same with us. We didn't need another pastor. We didn't need another evangelist. We needed somebody to be able to catch the vision of where we were in the timeline. Are we in the Ephesian age, the Pergamian age, the Sardis Age? Where are we? We're in the bride age. Well, praise the Lord. So, the prince of Persia, this demon over the kingdom, is trying to keep Gabriel from bringing the timeline to Daniel. And then Daniel will utter it, being the messenger of the hour. And the elect under Daniel's administration will get under the burden of the words. I'm going to say it to you this way that the angel of God will bring the seal of that day and the seal will release the mystery of what's to happen in that day because God has always allocated so much of his word to a certain time frame. Sometimes you may have an allocation of the word and it'll go for decades and nothing else new will come with it. And if there is something new, it'll have to come to a prophet. And you may you imagine how Satan hates that when God has now got a word and it's going to be revealed. He's going to do everything he can to stop that understanding. So whenever Gabriel comes down and breaks into this realm, this demon finds out that he's there. And now he starts waring with Gabriel, the mighty angel Gabriel. So he's coming in and anointing. Now remember, they're not just duking it out like that and just kicking one another, you know, shudo chops and all that sort of thing. You know where the battle was? It was in the minds of the leaders and them demons are fighting for control of their minds. &gt;&gt; Now what THEY'RE WANTING TO DO IS BOTH kingdoms are projecting something. So, the prince of Persia and his associates are there to try to get Cyrus out of of this spot to where he's favoring the Jews and and anoint the the provincial leaders to where they will say, "No, no, no. WE CAN'T DO THAT. NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW, THAT AIN'T RIGHT. That ain't right." And then Cyrus will say, "No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't I don't want to cause trouble in the church here. You know, I don't I don't want to man alive. I hate to do this because it's really going to cause some issues." And them demons HAS ALL GONE ON. AND THERE'S Gabriel G. &gt;&gt; AND GABRIEL IS THERE WHISPERING TO Cyrus and Gabriel. And where's the war going on amongst the people? &gt;&gt; Don't you understand? It's exactly the same way today. It's not like the angels of God are here tonight. I mean, they're just hitting them demons right square in the mouth, kicking them in the shin, you know, knocking them down, kicking and stomping. But you understand what's going on? Both of them are fighting for your mind. Most of them are wanting to control you. They are wanting to control the people of the earth. Now, for those of you who have a seal on your soul, them demons can never go any farther than that seal. But they'll try to trouble you and they'll try to bring affliction upon your body and they'll try to occupy your mind with business and this and that and the other and just keep your focus broke away from the word and the time and the season that we're living in. I hope somebody's going to hear me tonight. &gt;&gt; So this is where that is going. So the purpose of the prince of Persia is detaining Gabriel because his master Satan does not want Gabriel to deliver the mystery to Daniel of what Satan is trying to do. Oh Lord have mercy. You can imagine them demons out of hell whenever them seals started coming open in March of 1963. You imagine them devils was nervous wrecks. They was tore all two pieces when they was hearing the things that had never been uttered on the earth by Paul or Peter or James. Come on, somebody. And yet the devil was hearing what was going on. They must have been tore up bad. NOW THE DEVIL WAS HOSTILE AGAINST THE JEWS. But God had moved upon Cyrus heart and had already softened that heart. Now, a word was going to be revealed for another phase of the restoration. But Michael had come down and Michael, in other words, like this, Michael related to Gabriel, all right, I'm good. I don't need your help, but you need mine. So, I'm here. I'll hold the fort while you're gone. YOU GO DOWN there and make it known to Daniel the time has arrived. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. SO HE WOULD NOT LEAVE CYRUS. YOU UNDERSTAND? THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING. HE WOULD not leave Cyrus until Michael came. And when Michael came, then Gabriel knew he could leave Cyrus and go down and tell Daniel. And what he does, that's the first thing that he tells him and lets him know what was going on. Now watch in verse 14. Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days. For yet the vision is for many days. Now remember this vision that Daniel is going to receive from God is going to be divided by a timeline. So part of it is for right then and part of it is actually still yet to come to pass. We're living in in those days right now. So whenever he said that it shall befall thee, for yet the vision is for many days. And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground and I became dumb. I don't mind telling you, I've seen some of these modern-day charismatic guys. You know, you see some of them on YouTube and some of them and they talk with angels, they eat breakfast with them, have lunch with them, all that sort of thing. And yet, you know, when Gabriel come to Daniel, it made him so sick. The man passed out. When John had these visitations, he passed out like a dead man. Is that right? THE THE PROPHET OF GOD said that every time that it would come near him, though it's happened hundreds of thousands of times, it would always alarm him, leaving him speechless. I've talked to different people that was around brother Brandham. Brother Bisco was one of them. And whenever the angel of the Lord would come near and brother Brandon would turn ashen white and couldn't even talk, lose the ability to speak. And yet SOME PEOPLE THAT TALK ABOUT, "OH, there's an angel. There's one. There's one. There's one. There's one." And it's not describing. Oh, there's a body armor light. Yeah. How you doing there? How you doing? act like you're saying, um, I I I I have to question that. I'm sorry &gt;&gt; because I I'm talking about this man here. I want you to look what effect that the visitation of the angel had on him. And behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips. Then I opened my mouth. Now this presence was so overwhelming that Daniel went dumb dumb to speak. He could not speak. and one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips. I want you to notice now that in these visions, Daniel does not mention seeing angels with wings. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, if you'll do a biblical search and you type in the word angels and wings, you'll find no hits cuz there ain't none. Now the cherubams had wings over their faces and wings over their feet, but none of these had wings, BUT HOW DANIEL SAW THEM was that they looked like a man. Then I opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me, "Oh my Lord." Look at how Lord is spelled though. Not capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D, but all lowercase. Oh my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. LOOK WHAT THE visitation of an angel of God did to this prophet of God. It made him so weak, he had no strength left. How can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? For as for me straightway there remain no strength in me neither is their breasts left in me. So Daniel has been so mesmerized by the presence of this angel that he was dumb. It left him dumb initially. Then it left him breathless and it left him with no strength at all. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE WOULD HAVE died had not the ANGEL OF GOD TOUCHED HIM. BECAUSE HUMAN FLESH CANNOT SURVIVE. It cannot survive in such presence. &gt;&gt; We must be changed. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And then there came again and TOUCHED ME ONE LIKE the appearance of a man. one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me. NOW NOTICE WHAT THIS angel is doing. So Gabriel comes to bring the message and then one like the appearance of a man comes and touches him and he's able to speak. And then one whether it's the same one or not he doesn't say. And then there came one touch me like the appearance of a man. And he strengthened ME AND SAID, "OH MAN, GREATLY BELOVED, fear not. Peace be unto thee, BE STRONG. YAY, be strong." [snorts] And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the angel of God, all he had to do was look at him and tell him, "Be strong." &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So I wonder if the angels of God would say, "Look at us in the last days and say, "Be raptured." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Wonder what we would be. &gt;&gt; You tell me. SO HE SIMPLY RECEIVED strength by the angel of God saying be strong don't be afraid. Now he said whenever he spoke unto me I was strengthened AND SAID LET MY LORD speak for thou hast strengthened me. Oh hallelujah. THEN SAID HE KNOWEST THOU WHEREFORE I come unto thee, and now I will I return to fight with the prince of Persia. Now he's going back and Michael is going to leave, but Michael won't leave until Gabriel gets there. And then Gabriel will resume what he was doing before. Anointing the king, anointing the princes, anointing the provincial mayors and all them people and the leadership. Oh children, I'll tell you one thing. If we could just understand the power of prayer, &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT? I BELIEVE THAT GOD CAN MOVE upon the rulers of this world that we live in. I believe that God still can be able to move on the president, the vice president, senators. That don't mean they're full of the Holy Ghost. A bit MORE NOTHING. BUT GOD CAN MOVE on them. OH, IF WE WOULD ONLY PRAYING IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. IT'S LIKE WE TAKE everything because we believe in predestination and election. We take it as IF THOUGH EVERYTHING THAT happens to us is ordained of God. If you're not careful, the devil will pull the wool over your eyes, as we say, and he'll ROB YOU BLIND OF JOY and many things in your life, and you'll say, "Well, it must be ordained of God." Don't you believe everything that comes from the DEVIL IS ORDAINED OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOW, NOTICE I He said, "I will return and I will fight with the prince of Persia. AND WHEN I AM GONE FORTH, now watch dispensationally, something is fixing to happen. Lo, the prince of Grecia shall come. A demon for the kingdom of the Greeks, which by which Alexander the Great will operate under. Satan had already allocated a demon that would be the antor of Alexander the Great. And when you look at that kingdom within a period of 13 years, he absolutely annihilated the kingdom of the Miso Persians which STRATEGICALLY LOOKING AT IT WITH THE NUMBERS 30,000 MEN. [clears throat] WITH 30,000 MEN. HE GOES IN AND TEARS UP THAT PLACE AND DOES ALL OF THAT. A MAN 33 YEARS OLD WHENEVER HE DIED. AND HOW IN THE WORLD WAS HE ABLE TO DO SUCH? Because a mighty DEMON HAD BEEN chosen to anoint Alexander and make HIM ONE OF THE GREATEST STRATEGISTS THAT THE WORLD HAD EVER known when IT COME TO WAR. WHERE DID HE GET THAT ABILITY TO FIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME FROM THAT DEMON THAT HAD FOUGHT against the angels of God. And in 13 years, he annihilated all that the Mes had fought for, ALL THE PERSIANS HAD FOUGHT FOR. AND THEN THEY JOINED TOGETHER. THEY CALLED IT THE MESO PERSIAN. AND ALL OF THAT THAT THEY DONE. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHY? WELL, YOU SAY, BROTHER DONNIE, WHY WASN'T IT JUST A TRANSFER OF POWER? BECAUSE THEM demons can't even get along with one another. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEM DEMONS CANNOT EVEN GET ALONG WITH ONE ANOTHER and they will fight one another or children. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHY GOD IS NOT THE AUTHOR OF CONFUSION? AND GOD IS NOT THE ONES THAT DIVIDES FAMILIES AND COMES IN WITH arguing and fussing and debating and churches and all that SORT OF THING. THAT'S NOT GOD THAT DOES THAT. IT'S A DEVIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh my. YOU SEE, THE PRINCE OF GRE Grecia is the satanic ruler of the Grecian Empire and it's ALREADY GOT AN EARTHLY counterpart that was chosen which is going to be Alexander the Great. NOW WATCH IN VERSE 21. BUT I WILL SHOW THEE THAT WHICH IS NOTED IN THE scripture of truth. I WILL SHOW THEE THAT which is noted in the scripture of truth. And yet the Bible was not actually put together yet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it ain't like they had Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus and Deuteronomy and Judges, you know, Joshua and Judges and and Ruth and on and on and on. They had this Old Testament said that. No. But you see, it was already scripture in the mind of God before it ever come on paper. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS HIS WORD. OH, THANK YOU, LORD. GOD HAS HIS word and he don't add one new word to it, but it comes a season for it and God lets it loose. SO HE SAID, "I'VE COME TO SHOW YOU what is noted in the scripture of truth." Now, isn't that strange that he would say it that way? Because all scripture is truth. BUT HE SAID that which is noted. WHAT NOTED? WHAT? THAT WHICH was noted for his time. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND FRIEND? THAT'S WHY WE KEEP emphasizing the message of the HOUR BECAUSE GOD HAD SENT TO US A PROPHET WITH A MESSAGE NOT TO REPLACE OUR BIBLE, NOT TO DO AWAY with our Bible. We believe in justification, sanctification, BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. BUT THERE WAS something noted in the scripture OF TRUTH FOR THE HOUR THAT WE LIVE IN. And Satan couldn't stop IT FOR COMING. BUT WHAT'S HE DONE NOW? HE'S CHANGED HIS TACTICS. NOW HE WANTS TO TRY TO STRIKE THE CREDIBILITY OF THE noted truth of this hour AND MAKE PEOPLE DOUBT THAT IT WAS REAL. MAKE PEOPLE DOUBT THAT YOU EVEN NEED IT. HE'S ONLY GOING BACK in reverse and doing what he couldn't do years ago. HE COULDN'T STOP IT THEN. AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, he ain't going to stop it now. He didn't stop in the days of Moses. THEY DIDN'T STOP IN THE DAYS OF DANIEL AND HE AIN'T GOING TO STOP IT NOW CUZ IT'S NOT THE IT'S NOT THE BRAND OF MESSAGE. IT'S NOT OUR MESSAGE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE FABRICATED. It's the Lord God's message. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Honest give HIM A HAND. CAN we [applause] praise the Lord? I will show THEE THAT WHICH IS noted in the scripture of truth. AND THERE IS NONE THAT holdeth with me in these things but Michael your prince. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Michael your prince. So none OF THE REST OF THE angels but Michael and Gabriel were illuminated to the season. None host with me in these things but Michael your prince. So who was Michael? Christ pre-incarnate manifestation. It was him that was the cloud and the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; IT WAS HIM THAT [clears throat] was the bush. PRAISE THE LORD. CHRIST WAS THE prince [snorts] of the kings of the earth. He was the prince, protector, and guardian of THE JEWISH PEOPLE. HE WENT BEFORE THEM in the wilderness. That's right. Oh, you say, "I wish he was mine." If you're bride, he is. &gt;&gt; NOW, NOTICE THIS GREAT MIGHTY ONE, it is he is the only one that shares with me in this understanding. Now Daniel whenever he's hearing these words, YOU IMAGINE AS THE REVELATION begins to strike him. So he's he's comprehending, okay, I can see that I I can see this is a great time and I've been been waiting on it trying to understand what Jeremiah meant. Is this the time, Lord? Is this the season? Or is this some type of spiritual symbolism? Was the 70 years an actual 70 years? Or was it um you know a prophetic something that didn't actually mean 70, but it meant 7,000? And God did IT THAT WAY. LORD, I don't know. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT time are we in? And then God sends him this mighty deliverer to be able to help him to understand. SO HE STRENGTHENS him in order to be able to have the word for the season. that Gabriel could strengthen Daniel because Michael had strengthened Gabriel. &gt;&gt; Oh, I love the divine protocol of God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? GOD STRENGTHENED HIS PROPHET MESSENGER THAT THE PROPHET MESSENGER COULD COME ON THE EARTH AND BRING A word in season for the hour which would in turn STRENGTHEN THE GOD CALLED MEN. AND THEN THE GOD CALLED MEN WOULD CATCH THE WORD, not their revelation, but what was already said. THEY WOULD CATCH THAT WORD. AND IF THEY WILL GET UP AND PREACH UNDER that same anointing, it will bring strength to the people to help them face the challenge of the hour. &gt;&gt; I LOVE TO PREACH about Shadrach, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO. I LOVE ALL THEM STORIES. BUT a real TRUE MAN OF GOD IS GOING TO BRING SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEO right up to the present tense where we are right now. WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO TELL YOU THAT HE WAS A GOD THAT USED TO MOVE? HE WAS A GOD THAT USED to be THE SAME AND SAY, "WELL, he ain't the same no MORE." WHAT GOOD'S THAT GOING TO DO, brother John? But we NEED TO BRING IT RIGHT UP. HOW CAN I DO IT? HOW CAN I DO IT WITH ALL THE OPPOSITION? HOW CAN OTHER MEN OF GOD DO IT WITH ALL THE OPPOSITION? CAUSE AN ANGEL OF GOD COMMISSION OUR PROPHET MESSENGER. YOU GO THERE AND I WILL BE WITH YOU. NOTHING SHALL HINDER YOU. NOT EVEN CANCER. YOU'LL CALL A BRIDE OUT. SO ON AND SO ON. MINISTERS OF GOD LAY RIGHT THERE AND THEY FEED ON THOSE WORDS. HALLELUJAH. AND THEY GET STRENGTHENED AND THEY COME OUT THOUGH THEY'RE FIGHTING HELL EVERYWHERE THEY TURN AND THEY WALK RIGHT UP THERE BEHIND THE PULL PIT AND THEY CLIMB IN THERE AND SAY, "CHURCH, WE'RE MORE THAN CONQUERS. CHURCH, WE CAN FACE EVERY STORM. CHURCH, WE CAN BE ABLE TO DO WHAT GOD'S CALLED US TO DO. THE STRENGTH IS COMING RIGHT ON DOWN. RIGHT ON DOWN. RIGHT ON DOWN. Praise the Lord. [applause] YOU SEE, MICHAEL THE Archangel and his angels UNDER HIM FIGHT for the elect of God. WE NEED MORE THAN JUST A PROPHET. WE NEEDED MORE THAN JUST A PASTOR AND AN EVANGELIST. THANK GOD FOR EVERY GOD CALLED ONE THAT WE HAVE. BUT WE NEEDED beings that would be ABLE TO GO IN THAT OTHER realm and be able to WORK ON OUR BEHALF WHEN WE COULD NOT GO THERE. DANIEL COULD NOT GO INTO THAT REALM. BUT GOD already had that took care of. &gt;&gt; Woo! Praise the Lord. Now, let's let's go into this in victory day in 1963. I'm sure that you you already know it, but just just to remind you of it that there are national spirits. Now, as there are national spirits, so are there denominational SPIRITS. SO, THAT'S WHY THE CHURCH OF CHRIST can fight against the Baptist and the Baptist will fight the church of Christ. And then, you know, they'll fight against a Catholic and fight against this and fight against that. But yet, they're all under one head, &gt;&gt; which is the devil. Of course, the organized religion I'm talking about. Not everybody in there. Some of them will come out. BUT UNDER THAT SYSTEM, they have one head, but it's divided into Catholicism and then Protestants, which was the daughters. And then OUT OF THAT, THEY'LL FUSS AND FIGHT ON ONE ANOTHER. BOY, they'll make a, you know, a podcast and they'll blast that church and they'll turn right around and blast them. And who is it that's doing it? It's the devil. &gt;&gt; Now, them spirits are divided. SO THAT THE SPIRIT THAT WOULD DOMINATE THE BAPTIST ORGANIZED religion absolutely hates the demon that is over the church of Christ. &gt;&gt; And the demon over the church of Christ hates everybody else anyway. Amen. &gt;&gt; WE SPEAK WHERE THE BIBLE SPEAKS AND SILENT WHERE THE BIBLE SILENT. &gt;&gt; Sure you are. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE WHAT MAKES THEM DO THAT NOW? NOW YOU KNOW IT AS WELL AS I DO THAT THE BAPTIST CHURCH, the Baptist theology just like the church of Christ. Everybody will never be a CHURCH OF CHRIST. THE CHURCH OF CHRIST JUST DRAWS a certain TYPE OF PEOPLE, A certain makeup. You know, a lot of them are argumentative. They want to argue and they want to, you know, that sort OF THING. AND THERE'S OTHERS THAT SAID, "OH MAN, I DON'T WANT TO be around nothing like that at all. I hate that sort of thing." THEY JUST LOVE TO ARGUE. THEY JUST LOVE TO DEBATE. BOY, they love to get you and they think, "Oh my goodness, and rip you up one side and down THE OTHER." YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY ARE THE EPITOME OF THAT DEMON. THEY ARE REFLECTING that demon which motivates THE CHURCH OF CHRIST. THEN YOU'VE GOT THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST, and then you got the free will, of course, and then you've got this, and you got that. YOU GOT THE PENTECOSTALS, YOU GOT THE ONE GOD PENTECOSTAL, then you got the THREE GOD PENTECOSTAL AND YOU'VE GOT THEM ALL DIVIDED AND THEM demons actually get jealous OF ONE ANOTHER. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THEN WHENEVER THE BAPTISTS WILL START GROWING AND THEY HAVE BIGGER CHURCHES AND ALL THAT SORT of thing that the demons in the Methodist church cuz for the last how many ever years the Methodist church has been going way downhill and that demon OF THE METHODIST CHURCH I IMAGINE WHEN they all get together they're fussing and fighting and carrying on and they can't stand that Baptist demon AND THAT CHURCH OF GOD DEMON LORD HAVE MERCY I CAN'T be around that bunch of Nazarines [clears throat] and they all hate the spirit of God that brought this angel's message. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; NOW WATCH THE PROPHET. YOU FIND IT WHEREVER you go. YOU FIND A NATIONAL SPIRIT. I went in and they have different ways and it's so strange. If I had time, I'd like to skip through some of the nations and show you. When you go in and you go INTO GERMANY, YOU FIND A military spirit. Everything is military. You have to stand straight, WALK STRAIGHT, CUT YOUR CORNERS and everything. It's military exact perfect match for what was needed to anoint Adolf Hitler. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT ANOINTING would have never worked in Switzerland to bring in the Holocaust. It would have never worked in other countries BECAUSE THE NATIONAL SPIRIT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. IT WOULD HAVE NEVER WORKED THAT WAY. IT'S OUR WAY OR NO WAY. IT'S GOT TO BE THIS. IT'S GOT TO BE THAT. WELL, THE PEOPLE ARE natured that way. And that anointing sits right down on them. And Satan said, "We've got a man. We've got a man. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; You go INTO FRANCE, YOU FIND AN IMMORAL SPIRIT, JUST WOMEN AND WINE and liquor and stuff like that. YOU GO INTO FINLAND, YOU FIND A LOYAL SPIRIT. Kind of like everything is honest. We must pay off everything. I figure we could use a few more fins. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying, you know, WE MUST PAY OFF EVERYTHING. SEE, IT MUST BE DONE. IT'S JUST GOT TO BE THAT WAY. NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY HAVE TO WORK, WHAT IT COSTS, IT JUST MUST BE THAT WAY. YOU COME INTO AMERICA AND YOU FIND A BIG HA. [laughter] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I BELIEVE FRIENDS, laughter is a good medicine. YEAH. &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER, THERE'S ALSO a spirit of America that's ha &gt;&gt; each of us have to find that place and that balance &gt;&gt; to where we're oh my more godly than Americans. &gt;&gt; I believe IN LAUGHING. ABSOLUTELY I do. BUT I ALSO KNOW THERE'S AN American spirit. &gt;&gt; That American spirit can get on preachers in the pullpits. &gt;&gt; And they're more joke tellers than they are truth tellers. &gt;&gt; Preach, Mother Donnie. &gt;&gt; Oh my. NOTICE HE SAID, "SOMEBODY TELL A A JOKE." NOTICE THEY SAID THAT'S THE AMERICAN SPIRIT. The American spirit. SOMEBODY TELL A DIRTY JOKE ON THE RADIO AND everybody laugh at her. Ernie Ford or some OF THEM CRACKING JOKES that they have, you know, everywhere. Arthur god FRIEND GROUP LIKE THAT. THAT'S THE American spirit. AND THEN THOSE SPIRITS get jealous of one another. Now, I would just like for you to think about it, not while I'm preaching tomorrow if you want to or something, &gt;&gt; BUT I'D LIKE FOR you to think of what hell must be like &gt;&gt; for about an hour. SO, YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE DEMONS COMING from their national drama. THEY'RE WORKING THE CYCLE of the END TIME. THE PROPHECY OF THE LAST KINGDOM laying right before them. And they gather down in hell for a demon conference &gt;&gt; AND THEY START TALKING AND THEN THEY START RAISING THEIR VOICES. THEN THEY START arguing and debating and fussing. You see, that's one reason why that I know that for many of the people who have left this message, they're not under the leadership of the Holy Ghost because they'd rather argue than pray. &gt;&gt; Tell the truth. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You see WHAT I'M SAYING? SO THEY MOVED OUT FROM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY Ghost under a spirit that wants to argue and fuss and debate and looking for mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you keep going that way, you will perfectly fit in the regions of the lost. &gt;&gt; There ain't no people like that in heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch. Then those spirits get jealous of ONE ANOTHER AND WHAT DO THEY DO? THEY CAUSE WAR. &gt;&gt; SO IF THE NATIONAL spirits do that, then what about the DENOMINATIONAL SPIRITS? WHAT ABOUT THE DOCTRINE things that we've seen right inside the ranks of our message? One doctrine and another and another and another. You know, this man's got the message of iron. This man's the latest, greatest gift of the bride. This is the bride's revival. How many of them have we had? And what DO THEY DO? ALWAYS ISOLATE, pulling people away, procolating people, pulling them to come over here. Boy, if you ain't having meetings like this in your church, you better leave your church. Well, I find that strange since God's prophet said, "You go back to your church and bring revival back to your church." &gt;&gt; Come on, SOMEBODY. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT IS IT CAUSING WAR? DEBATING IT. WHAT HAPPENS in families? Oh, now here we're going to really get down where the rubber hits the road, I guess. &gt;&gt; Husbands and wives and children and mamas and daddies and BROTHERS AND SISTERS FUSSING, ARGUING, FIGHTING. WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM? HELL, &gt;&gt; NOT HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They cause war. They cause war in churches. They cause WAR IN DENOMINATION. THEY CAUSE war in nations. And they cause war in families. &gt;&gt; That's right. NOW, YOU SEE, EVERY NATION IS CONTROLLED BY SATAN. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID, "SO, HE'S THE GOD OF THE NATIONS." &gt;&gt; Some of you looked at me strange a while ago and I said, "There's two gods." &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I knew what I was talking about. I just knew you waiting. You know, HE'S THE GOD OF THE NATIONS. SATAN TOOK JESUS up top of the mountain, showed him all the kingdoms that was in the world IN A MOMENT OF TIME. And when the prophet quotes this in the Sue book, he says, "What a creature." You imagine the devil showing Jesus the United States, showing him the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND HE SAID, "THESE ARE MINE. I DO WITH THEM ANYTHING I WANT TO. I'LL GIVE THEM over to you if you worship me." Jesus said, "Get behind me, Satan." He knew he was going to fall heir to him in the millennium. So he didn't have to bow down to him. He knew it. AND WHEN GOD COMES AGAIN, I love this. MAKES HIS KINGDOM HERE, THERE'LL NOT BE ANY DIFFERENT KINDS of spirit. Praise the Lord. A GERMAN SPIRIT, A FRENCH SPIRIT, A NORWEGIAN SPIRIT AND AN AMERICAN SPIRIT. THERE WON'T BE THAT. IT'LL BE ONE SPIRIT. AMEN. AND HE SAYS, "THE SPIRIT OF GOD LIVING IN every heart." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AND THERE'LL BE ONE FLAG, one nation, ONE PEOPLE, A BROTHERHOOD, a fatherhood of God, and a brotherhood of men. God hasten the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THEN WE FIND BECAUSE PEOPLE DO THIS AND CAUSE THESE GREAT FUSSES AND SO FORTH. NOW SEE, AS LONG AS SATAN CONTROLS IT, THERE'S going to be wars and troubles and war. Jesus said in St. John, Matthew 24, he said, "You hear of wars and rumors of wars and WARS AND WAR." WHY? CUZ THE PRINCE of the earth, Satan, the power of the nations, there is a national spirit, a national spirit. It's devils. They can't get along with one another. That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine no peace in hell? &gt;&gt; Nobody goes around smiling. How are you today, brother demon? They said, "Get away from me. I don't like you. Stay away from me." I know a few people like that. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; You ain't under the influence of the Holy Ghost and you got that attitude, friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Fred, I find this astounding in the way that he says this. They can't get along with one another. &gt;&gt; So his kingdom, he split away. He split the first church. Satan did. All the congregants were angels. &gt;&gt; The first church worshippers, &gt;&gt; they was worshiping God. That's how that's what made him God because they worshiped him and it was what? Angels. &gt;&gt; Angels. &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR. &gt;&gt; SO, HE SPLIT THE FIRST CHURCH. &gt;&gt; You ever find any scriptures or quotes where it teaches us how to scripturally split a church? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Wonder why. &gt;&gt; So, his kingdom then is established upon a split. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Rebellion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. SO WHAT DO YOU FIGURE the people in the kingdom are going to do? Split &gt;&gt; hell wide open. [screaming] &gt;&gt; OH MY. COME ON, CHILDREN. THEY ARGUE. THEY FUSS. THEY DEBATE. THEY FIGHT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. YEAH. YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND THEN PEOPLE WANT US TO LEAVE THE prince of peace &gt;&gt; AND GO INTO THIS TO WHERE THESE DEVILS CAN'T EVEN GET ALONG WITH one another. Come on. &gt;&gt; Wow. Paragraph 101. WELL, THAT'S THE DEVIL. YOU SEE, HE'S A KILLER. &gt;&gt; The nation. EVEN DEVILS FIGHTING DEVILS. But angels of God don't fight &gt;&gt; angels of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But devils fight devils. &gt;&gt; So when people ARE ALL THE TIME FIGHTING AND ARGUING, [snorts] &gt;&gt; wonder whose kingdom they belong to. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Now notice HE SAID THEY JUST FIGHT ONE ANOTHER. When brother B says this, he he he mentions about the Siberian huskys and he said that whenever they would, you know, they got them them huskys in the in the harness and they'll pull that dog sled and they've got their mouths all taped up, you know, or whatever and then they kind of keep them APART. BUT HE SAID WHENEVER THEY TAKE THEM OUT, THEY'VE GOT A CHAIN OF one over here and one over there and one over there. He said they're so full of the devil. That's what he said. THEY'RE SO FULL OF THE DEVIL THAT KILL ONE ANOTHER. AND YOU THINK, MY GOODNESS. SO, SATAN Satan harnesses these demons &gt;&gt; AND THEY THEY CARRY OUT PART OF HIS mission and AT THE SAME TIME THEY CAN'T STAND one another. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine walking away from the fountain of pure love &gt;&gt; and leaving a kingdom that was so sublime and you walk in to this &gt;&gt; that I've read to you tonight? &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes? Matthew 12:43. When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places. Huh? So a demon leaves out of an individual and Jesus now remember so he would know this these things. JESUS DESCRIBES THAT DEVIL whenever it would go out of a human body into this sphere. Jesus calls it a dry place. So it WOULD BE A THIRSTY PLACE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; A PLACE THAT THIS demon is not being satisfied. HE WALKETH THROUGH DRY PLACES. Now notice what Jesus said then that these disembodied spirits do seeking rest. &gt;&gt; Why? They are tormented beings. Wonder why, friends, for many of these folks that have left the message, wonder why they have turned into such tormented creatures. &gt;&gt; No matter what they do, where they go, where they wind up, it's like they're tormented. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, these are the words of Jesus. When the unclean spirit goes OUT OF A MAN, HE WALKETH THROUGH DRY places seeking rest. You mean a demon would want rest. Look at the word rest. Intermission. Everybody knows what that is, right? Intermission. Cessation of any motion, business or labor. recreation. So the devils are seeking recreation. But notice it don't say they were seeking that when they were in a human body, but once they went out of the human body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now remember this demon and this scenario the way the Lord Jesus gives it was not cast out but he left of his own accord. Now watch how these demons will do. They know that if they leave on their own accord they can come back when they want to. If they're cast out, they cannot do it until that person is willing to let them back in because they were made to leave. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I wonder I wonder as they watch God's program down through the ages and seeing the spirit of God dealing with humans hearts and they can see the spirit of God is drawing them and moving on them the way he did Cyrus and the princes of Persia and all of that. And that demon pulls a fast one and says, "I better get out of here while the getting's good." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because if I leave first, I can come back at my will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that demon will leave that individual. So say they go to a Baptist church, a Methodist church, Pentecostal church, word of life church, whatever it is. And whenever THEY COME, THEY FEEL SO WONDERFUL AND SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLE happened to them. Lord, children, may God open our ears tonight. &gt;&gt; AND SOMETHING TREMENDOUS happened and they're thinking they got born again. But what happened was that demon simply made a fast exit. &gt;&gt; When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places seeking rest. Notice how Jesus said this. And findeth none. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT SATAN AND HIS demons are restless, unqued spirits. LORD BEING CAST OUT of heaven, THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN find intermission, what they perceive as rest, &gt;&gt; is when they're in human bodies and taking the joy of them humans. &gt;&gt; Wow. taking the peace of them humans, causing them humans to drink and lie and, you know, just break God's WORD AND ALL THAT. THAT'S THEIR that's their entertainment. THEY'RE POWERLESS WITHOUT LIVING IN a human body. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY GO OUT, I MEAN, THEY'RE WALKING AND THEY'RE going here and there. I I can't stand it. I CAN'T STAND IT. I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME REST. I'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME REST. SO THEY GO BACK AND GET INSIDE THEM BODIES AND WHATEVER THEY TELL THEM DRINK. WHY? HEY, THAT WOMAN'S SMILING AND SHE SMILE BACK AT HER. GET HER PHONE NUMBER. DO THIS. THAT'S WHEN THEY'RE actually in the only rest they can get. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm so glad the one that used to live in me before I got saved and had not another nar and another day of rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I SURE HAVE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND THE DEVIL WANTS TO CONVINCE YOU HE'S GOT SO MUCH TO OFFER YOU. LOOK AT THE KINGDOM THEY LIVE IN, SAINTS. &gt;&gt; They have no peace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak to us, Lord God. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THESE DEMONS HAVE NO contentment or satisfaction until they return into that human body. Remember the the demons that was cast out of the man and they said they asked Jesus, "Let us go into the hogs." when we don't don't cast us out into the deep. Please don't cast us out into the deep. &gt;&gt; Let us go into the hogs. YOU SEE, THEY RETURN INTO their mire and their filth. It's the only rest they have. Lord God, HIS VIEW IN WALKING in these places among such people is rest. Lord God, think of what we'd be tonight, friends, if it wasn't for the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; IF GOD HAD NOT GIVE US REST. DON'T YOU SEE THAT THE AGE is becoming the epitome of these demons? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE LEFT THE WORD, the revealed WORD OF THE HOUR. LOOK AT THEM. THEY'RE MISERABLE. &gt;&gt; I AIN'T GOT FACEBOOK. I DON'T WANT IT. BUT SOME OF THE STUFF I HEAR the people say left the message OF THE HOUR. MY GOODNESS. THINGS THEY CALL their parents, THINGS THEY CALL THE PREACHER where they went to church and this and that and the other. AND WHENEVER I'VE READ STUFF LIKE THIS, I THINK, LORD GOD, IT'S THE EPITOME. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE EPITOME. THEY HAVE NO REST. THOUGH THEY SAY THEY'RE FREE. We don't have to do this and we don't have to. BOY, I'M FREE. I'M FREE. &gt;&gt; NO, you're not. No, you're not. You have no rest, no satisfaction. &gt;&gt; Notice in Job chapter 1 verse 7, and the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence comest thou?" Then Satan answered the Lord and said, "FROM GOING TO AND fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it, a restless evil. Walking up and down, going here, going there, looking, searching, looking." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got it now, devil. What you going to do with it? You can't even enjoy it, can you? Look again in Job chapter 2 verse 2. And the Lord said unto Satan, "From whence cometh down Satan answered the Lord and said, from going TO AND FRO IN THE earth and from walking up and down in it." 1 Peter 5:8, "Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion, walkest about seeking whom he may devour." You see, that's why people that pulled away from the word in every age that they've done it, whether it was Dayan and Kora, Byum, whoever it was, same in our age, what do they do once they leave the word? They get this walking about thing on them and they want to talk to you and talk to you and talk to you and pull ON YOU AND PULL ON YOU. DON'T YOU SEE WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR inspiration from? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS &gt;&gt; AS HE WALKS ABOUT SEEKING WHOM HE MAY DEVOUR. Lord Jesus, [snorts] A FALLEN CORRUPT spirit can have no rest. But in a polluted human heart, aren't you glad you've got a heart &gt;&gt; that the devil wouldn't feel it on me? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, LORD. THE CORRUPTION OF THE ONE IS SUITED TO THE other as like beggets like. Notice, let me close here momentarily. And verse 44, then he saith, so the unclean spirit goes out of a man, and he walketh through dry places, seek and rest, and findeth none. Now verse 44, THEN HE SAITH, I WILL RETURN. Notice his claim into [clears throat] my house. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You see, the title deed had not been released, he still claimed it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As his Lord Jesus had moved in with the Holy Ghost, he could have not said that. That's right. &gt;&gt; Think about it, friends. &gt;&gt; I will return into my house from whence I came out. And when he has come, notice what he finds now. He findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. First word that Jesus used though was empty. swept. Why did it need to be swept? Cuz it was a mess. &gt;&gt; SWIPE OUT THE CIGARETTES. SWEEP OUT ALL THE illicit this and that and the other wrong, you know, books and movies and all of that filth that a Christian should not even be able to be involved in at all. Come on, somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; And the SPIRIT OF GOD SWEEPS IT OUT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And then notice it garnishes it. This this word is phenomenal. Adorn to put in order, arrange, make ready, prepare. But the key word is the first one, empty. So a person can be empty and still be adorned and arranged and in order and prepared and they think, "I'M READY. I'M READY. PRAISE GOD." But they're as empty as they can be. &gt;&gt; Empty, swept, and garnished. The word garnest also means to ornament, adore. Metaphorically, it's to embellish with honor. What is this? A life of a person that got saved. And sounds like brother Ben even sanctified. GOD DONE GREAT THINGS FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL. And let me read it to you in the prophet's words and we'll close from here. Sometimes [snorts] the spirit gets real contrary. They just don't want to come at all. And that's the time you have to have an authority. Do you believe that? Now there's sometimes if a person's faith will come up, maybe they don't have enough faith and it's just waving there. And there's a demon trying to hold maybe a little of unbelief there. Just kind of skeptical. Sometimes you have to command it out. And if you do that, then they're angry. That's when they go from one to another. &gt;&gt; And when they come out, you know, Jesus said them demons come out and said sufferers are going to the swine. See, a devil is helpless if he isn't in a body somewhere. &gt;&gt; He's just a spirit in the world until he's in a body. No rest. You see, no rest. He can torment us. Notice he said, listen what Jesus said. When the deaf spirit went out of the man, he could hear. When the deaf spirit, when the dumb spirit went out, the child, he could speak. And when demons when they come out, demons are helpless unless they are embodied. Look at the de demon that Jesus met at Gadra said sufferers to go into the swine without a body. Jesus said go and the swine went into fits that was in the maniac and down into the sea. They went and drowned in fits [snorts] just like the man did. And in studying this verse of scripture, I found this in a Bible concordance. It's called Williams Bible, Wilmington's rather Bible handbook. I thought it was just so wonderful. I want to share it with you. Reformation minus regeneration means condemnation. &gt;&gt; Reformation minus regeneration means condemnation. Oh my. Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look, children, we we can't do this on our own. &gt;&gt; This is way too strong for us. &gt;&gt; Way too powerful. &gt;&gt; But with Jesus in us, we can meet the challenge of the day. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our head, shall we? Praise the Lord. Oh my. I'm not here tonight to preach these things to you to scare you or frighten you or anything like that, [cough] but just so [clears throat] we can see what we are dealing with and know that these demons [clears throat] that we're talking about tonight, they have they have been in this battle for thousands of years. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; They have taken down many, many people. Us on our own, we're no match for them. But with Jesus in us, as I've already quoted it to you, greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world. And what does it produce in people who walk away from the word? Arguing, fussing, fighting, hate. I've dealt with some of these people who have left the message. Not all of them, but many of the ones that I have talked to and dealt with by emails. I have never dealt with people with such spirits on them. They hate the prophet. They hate the message. They hate you. They hate every preacher that preaches it. And it's like they have come under an anointing. An anointing to destroy. an anointing not to heal, an anointing not to pray for us if we're so blind. Then show us more of Jesus. Give us more than what we've got. Ain't nobody going to win me by hatred. And the church said, &gt;&gt; the Bible says God is love. The Bible doesn't say God is hate. Can't you see these two heads are coming to their fullness? The God of this evil age is releasing more and more demons. Remember the prophet tells us in 1961, I think it was that the lid had been tore off of the kettle and demon powers are streaming in every direction. But also the power of God has been released. Praise the Lord. God is wanting his people to take on his image. And what image is that, brother Donnie? The stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Yes. Satan wants his people to take on his image. It will be a mark, a mark of the beast. What is that mark? Protestantism. Made light to the image of the of Revelation 17. And they will force everyone on the earth that's left to take that mark or they cannot buy or sell. Can't you see that same spirit right around the message of the hour? Well, if you don't believe what we believe and preach what we preach, you're not even in the bride. You can't be the bride's revival. That's not the spirit of God people are working under. Lord have mercy, children. May God help us. How many wants to be more like Jesus? I don't mind telling you, I've dealt with demons for many years [clears throat] of my life. Seen them, seen them physically. I don't want nothing to do with them. I sure don't want them things living in my body. Driving me out of my mind, making me hate and destroy and want to annihilate. No. and have no rest, no peace. I just wonder what it's like down in hell for a little while. We can see the violence that's coming on the earth. We can see these demons in these cities, how these people are protesting and rioting, killing, mutilating, destroying. We can see this anti-semite thing that's around the world. Friends, can't you see it? You just heard about it in Australia. The FBI just stopped some ISIS recruits out in Los Angeles. They're already saying in Europe that during Christmas time that the chatter on the internet that ISIS and these Islamic people are going to kill and destroy. Why? That's the demon. Study the life of Muhammad. &gt;&gt; He mutilated. He raped. He murdered. &gt;&gt; You want to follow a man like that? There's something mentally wrong with you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That man married a six year old girl. Six years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You imagine having sex with a 9-year-old girl. &gt;&gt; And that's a prophet. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He's a prophet. All right. A false one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Anointed with demons out of hell. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Donnie, be careful. No, I'm not going to be careful. I'm going to tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; The truth is what'll make you free, not compromise. &gt;&gt; I realize we got message preachers. Everybody's on YouTube and everybody's streaming and more gets on YouTube. And the more streams, the less we're talking about it, the less we're preaching and declaring it. I wonder how long it'll be before message preachers will even be preaching against sin. &gt;&gt; Well, if YouTube kicks us off, so be it. If I've got to stay on YouTube and I got to compromise to do it, let's get off of it oursel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS WHAT'S GOING TO GET US OUT OF HERE. THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL RAISE UP A STANDARD AGAINST THE kingdom of hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Help us tonight, Father. Lord God, I pray for every man, woman, boy, and girl that's in divine presence. I pray for those, Lord, that were sick and couldn't come to church. Those, Lord, that live in different parts of the world and they'll stream or archive this service. Dear Jesus, keep us in this hour. Father, either the God of this evil age or the God of eternity is going to dominate our lives. Every person in this building is going to be under the control of one or the other. Our president, our Congress, our Senate, our Congress people will fight and fuss and argue and go back and forth and we see some of them things the way they do and they hate one another. and they're on the same side &gt;&gt; and don't even know it, but they can hate one another and still be under the same king because that's the way his demons are. But yet John told us, "If a man hates his brother, he does not have eternal life abiding in him, for he is a murderer. And a man cannot be a murderer and hate his brother. &gt;&gt; We can disagree. We can have points of doctrine that would bitterly disagree. But since we're part of the kingdom of light, we cannot hate one another. &gt;&gt; And by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples when you have love one for another. But demons are known for their corruption and the rottness. But they're also known for their hatred. They hate their own kind. They hate their own soldiers. They hate the people they live in. And their only fun and pleasure is robbing people of their happiness &gt;&gt; and their health. When demons want rest, they take people's pleasure out of life, that's the only rest them tormented devils know. Oh, and when the Holy Spirit wants rest and peace, he lives in a human heart. This is my rest. That's what you prophesied in Isaiah. This is the rest. Jesus said, "My peace I leave with you." But Satan takes the peace of his people. But Jesus gives us his peace back. You settle our unrest and our uneasiness. And you make us calm even in our greatest trials. Hell is at the boiling point. America's at the boiling point. The world, families. Lord Jesus, help us. Father, we love you, Father God. Would you move in every heart you're present tonight, Jesus? You can start with me or you can save me to the last. I don't care how you do it. But move in me, Lord. Keep me from hatred. Keep me from evil. I know only way a lot of people identify evil as women cutting their hair and wearing pants and all that sort of thing. Oh, but some of the most evil people I've ever seen was those that was religious as they could be. Lord God, we don't want to be just religious. We want to be saved, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost. So if that devil that used to live in us come back to the house to inspect it, first thing he's going to find is there's a sign on the door. No vacancy. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise God. There's no sign on our door to let for rent for lease. And the reason he can know that is is because your name revealed by the word of the hour is applied over our heart. That's what the prophet said when they took the blood and they rubbed it there in Egypt. They took that blood of the lamb and they rubbed it over the mantle and over the doorpost because he said that's where the name of the people were. So they took the blood of the lamb and they rubbed up that lentil and they rubbed right over the name of that individual and their name was covered in the blood. So Lord, it ain't Donnie. It ain't Harry. It ain't Daryl, Jim, Joel, Fred, Susie, Carol. It's your name. and the word interpreted as the manifestation of the name of God. So he comes that old drinking devil, that old lion devil, whatever he was. He said, "Well, I can't get back in there. There ain't no room." No, sir, devil. We ain't got one stack of room. We ain't got a closet. We ain't got a cabinet. We ain't got a drawer. We want our drawers full of goodness. We want our closet. And we want everything about us. Oh, hallelujah. We want the basement.

He said, "Brother Donnie, you know how it felt when you first got saved?" I said, "Yes, sir. I sure do. I remember that, brother." He said, "I just been wanting that so bad. I've just been praying." And I said, "You remember before the prophet left the earth about a month, he said he longed to feel like he did when he first got saved and them mountaintop experiences." And I tell him, I said, "This is just my own belief, but I believe that's the kind of shape the bride's going to be in before she leaves this world. That first love will restrike her. She'll just love him so much and things will be of less value. We will use as we preach Sunday but not abusing this world and we just love him so much and it's automatic. The more you love him, &gt;&gt; the more you'll love one another. &gt;&gt; Remember the last virtue right next to charity is what? healing, miracles, signs, wonders, speaking in tongues, visions, &gt;&gt; brotherly kindness. Charity will set right on top of our brotherly kindness. The very last virtue to be produced in its full manifestation, the sevenths that will fall right into the eighth, brotherly kindness. He knew exactly where to put it. I mean, he loves him tonight. sing something for us. Hey, can we just worship the Lord? I know you got to work tomorrow and your kids have got school and stuff like that. If you if you need to go, feel free to go. I just like to worship him a little before we go. I think of what I could be tonight. I could have been an empty house. As I look back and realize when I was in Pentecost, my soul wasn't sealed. Well, I had a baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yeah. spoke in tongues, run, shouted, cast out devils, all kinds of things, but I wasn't sealed. But thank God he kept me from that evil thing coming back in me. Praise God. And if you're not sealed tonight, friend, you can before you leave this place. You don't want to be empty. You want to be full. Full. Be ye filled with the spirit.
