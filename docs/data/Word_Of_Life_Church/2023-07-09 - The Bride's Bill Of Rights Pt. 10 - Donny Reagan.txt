we want to wish them a very happy birthday and a very happy wedding anniversary let's give them a nice hand this morning and we have a have a couple of tributes this morning we could ask every one of you and every one of you to have nice something nice to say but uh I want brother JD Whitson I want him to come here just for a minute or two he's got something he wants to say to you and then brother Harry has got a tribute to brother Donnie and sister Carol this morning also you knew about it don't act like your this is all shocked you knew about it but I appreciate these brothers Brother Jimmy's got a very very very go ahead and give him a hand a very close working relationship with her pastor and that's why I asked him to say something also outside of sister Carol brother Harry knows more and appreciates more about brother Donnie than than any of us so these brothers are going to give just a few minutes we'll go over just a few minutes but that'll be okay we're here till we leave right but JD we appreciate you buddy [Applause] brother Harry and I didn't have much of a notice and I told Brother uh Louis that I didn't have a button in my mouth I had an m m but I'm sure that everyone in this congregation could and would give a heartfelt appreciation to brother Donnie and sister Carol on this special weekend that they're celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary and their birthday since we can't do that I guess I've been selected to as a representative to try to express that love and appreciation to both of them I know that brother Donnie and sister Carol they don't like a lot of Praise or attention thrown their way but that's just part of the humility that we've grown to to to love and admire about them you know brother Donnie as my pastor and my friend you have been the most influential person in my life I've worked very close with brother Donnie for the past 36 years as a deacon and I've seen some of the ins and outs ups and downs trying situations Corrections Restorations Grace and during all that time and during all those years I've never seen one time not one time that it's not been the character of a son of God he's always led by an example and that's what so impressed me about him I know in the very beginning that we didn't have a pastor at Happy Valley and I kept calling brother Donnie and asking me would he come and hold a service for us would he come and preach he would come and he would preach he'd go back to Kentucky I'd call him again I'd say brother Donnie would you come and hold a service for us he would come hold the service go back to Kentucky but I could tell always that his heart was on that little church in that little church in Kentucky but God had a a greater plan God had a bigger plan and he was squeezing brother Donny's heart to leave that church and come to a church that was in tremendous tremendous need and probably during one of those times when God was squeezing his heart and he was struggling or perplexed about it I gave him a call one day and asked him would he come and Minister for us a service and and I'm sure it was during that struggle that he was having he got a little ill with me he chooses to forget that day but he got a little ill with me I'm sure because of the perplexion he was going through and he said why you keep calling me and my answer to him was I believe pricked his heart I told him I said brother Donnie we're a church in great great need and if we don't have some help we'll perish I could tell immediately his demeanor changed and he said when when do you want me to come I want to thank him for obeying God you know I'll never forget those times brother Donnie and I'll never forget the pain and the courage it took for you to leave and obey God [Music] there's a song that says when words fail us listen to our heart and I know this entire congregation words would fail us brother Donnie sister Carol but if there's some way that you could hear our hearts some way possible that you could hear it our hearts would be screaming to you that we love you foreign scream out honor and appreciation for you and what you mean to us and we'd be thanking you Lord for all the labor all the studying that you've done to bring us Rapture readiness all the prayers all the requests for prayer in the middle of the night we Heirs of the morning all the sacrifices that you've made sacrifices from your family that you've sacrificed for our our flock here but I want to say brother Donnie sister Carol that this entire congregation will be standing at attention with great apprehension and great expectation when your name is called and those great rewards are handed out it'll be a time for us to Rejoice with you I just want you to know that you have her love and you have our hearts [Applause] I sure couldn't add anything to that but there's a couple things I've learned about Brother Louie and both of them is you don't tell him no because he'll get you one way or the other so you might as well just go ahead and do it I'd like to say that uh I think brother Donald Institute Carol for all their sacrifice what uh thought this morning I didn't put a lot of thoughts you know me I don't talk good so Paul said follow me as I follow Christ I would say for everyone of us sitting here we have no excuse we can't say well that man didn't tell me and or that man didn't live it or I saw this or that we have a great opportunity here but we also faced with truth that we don't have any excuse and uh I can't sing but I can sing better and I can talk so key of G yeah uh as brother JD just said I want to be by grace on me standing close when this is not a dream that a song was wrote about but it's a reality dreamed I went to heaven you were there with me [Music] we walked upon the streets of gold beside the crystal sea heard the angels singing someone called your name [Music] turned and saw a young man he was smiling as he came he said friend you may not know me now then he said but wait years to teach my son to school when I was only eight [Music] every week you would say a prayer before the class would start [Music] one day when you said that prayer I asked Jesus in my heart thank you forgiving to the Lord [Music] I am alive that was changed thank you forgiving to the Lord I am so glad you gave [Music] then another man stood before you [Music] said Remember the Time a missionary came to your church his pictures made you cry you didn't have much money but you gave it anyway [Music] Jesus [Music] thank you for giving to the Lord [Music] I am alive that was changed thank you for giving to the Lord I am so glad you came one by one they came as far as he I could see each life somehow touched by your generosity the little things that you had done all the sacrifices you made unnoticed on the earth in heaven now proclaimed [Music] I know up in heaven you're not supposed to cry I am almost sure there were Tears In Your Eyes as Jesus took your hand you stood before the Lord he said my child look around you great is your reward can you help me thank you [Music] I am alive that was changed [Music] for giving to the Lord [Music] I am so glad you came I am so glad you came [Music] [Applause] on how y'all think I'm going to preach after that bow Reds together Heavenly Father we love you so much today dear God we're grateful for the opportunity that we would be able to make this journey together we've been through many hard trials and sicknesses and deaths and so many things together how we long for that day when we'll all be able to stand before you the most important thing in our lives Lord is that you'll be pleased with this I know I'm satisfied with you you've been so good to me you've kept me you've helped me I just want you to be satisfied with me Lord God I'm sure that every Christian is standing here today are those under the sound of my voice that's their greatest desire to be able to hear you say those words well done two of the most powerful phenomenal words a human being can ever hear sin from almighty god well done I pray when our stories written may it be like Abraham don't mention our failures or weaknesses and times when it felt like we couldn't go on but may it be said about us too they staggered knocked at the promise of God we love you so much today Jesus thank you for your kindness to us help us Lord as we look into your word today may we be benefited by our gathering together in church today Lord it's such an honor for us to be together Lord God I pray for this prayer calls that I have Lord Brother Joel receiving this request for this young man I looked at his picture that he sent me I thought poor little guy dealing with this thing nothing but the devil to attack his body but in the name of Jesus May the spirit of God move forward every other need and requests that you're today which immediate father according to your greatness in Jesus name we pray amen well I'm just happy to be the house of the Lord [Applause] it's good to be a Christian isn't it let's turn to the Book of Romans if you would chapter 8 today and while you're turning there let me get through all the birthdays and all that sort of thing I want to wish Ashley and Courtney a happy birthday on Friday I like to wish Carol a happy 50th wedding anniversary yesterday I'd like to wish Carol a happy birthday today I'll not tell you how old she is I'd also like to wear Scotty my son-in-law happy birthday tomorrow I also like to wish Emma and Ellie a happy birthday tomorrow and anybody else that's here God bless you so when I forget this week I'm in big trouble [Music] in big trouble Romans chapter 8 verse 16. the spirit itself Bears the witness with our spirit isn't that awesome the spirit itself bearth a witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join heirs with Christ if wow what a big little word if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together so you mean being sons and daughters and heirs and join heirs is attached has an attachment called suffering according to what Paul said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature waiters for the manifestation of the sons of God may the Lord bless his words you may be seated I don't think there's any man that's ever really loved his wife that would not share everything that he had 50 years ago when Carol and I got married I was working at the anchor motel in Monticello Kentucky it was on Sunday they made me work on Sunday morning so Carol was anxiously awaiting for me to get off work I didn't have much to give her I had no home she had a rambler an American Rambler anybody know what them are antiques now wish we had that car she had an American Rambler and I had a 53 Ford truck we didn't have a house to live in I had no money and nothing to give her no insurance and I do not preach this is the way you're supposed to marry a woman I was in ignorance but I was greatly in love but what I had was hers you're laughing right you think what you just told us you didn't have anything well no I didn't but I I had my heart and my loyalty and my love and my integrity she's had that all these years I know it don't seem not much to you but it was all that I had and it's who I was so for some whenever they get married the marry a rich man's son it's Dad's a corporate guy flies on private jets rubs shoulders with the up and up people knowing by name been to the White House a few times or maybe he's a local businessman you're in Johnson City the people on the boards know him and people seem and shake his hand and speak to him and he has a reputation and his wife is not ashamed to say well who's your husband who you married to well I'm married to so-and-so oh yeah I've heard of him led a big guy with the Johnson City song yeah yeah that's my husband but what if we could be married to the king of the universe who owns everything not only owns it but made it then he would want to share what he is and what he has with us would he not I mean your brothers felt that way mother wife you married whatever you had not only from that point but from that point on whatever you would have you would give to her there's a lady at TJ Maxx showing Johnson City and she's worked there for years and years and for years Carol and I have been there and this lady has watched the purchases that we have made of course I'm surrounded by women married a wife thank God two daughters six granddaughters three sets of twins so a big portion of the purchases that we have made there have been women's dresses girls dresses women's shoes girls shoes women's girls women's girls so one day this lady asked me she said don't you ever get anything so I said yes ma'am every now and then I do I said but me and my wife we made this agreement whenever we got married how many ever years ago whenever I told this to her probably 10 or 12 years ago I said we made this agreement that every saying would be 50 50. so she's just standing there waiting for the rest of the story and I told her our agreement was it would be fifty dollars for her 50 cents for me I can see some of your sisters like that agreement sorry Brothers sorry brother Timothy and you know when I look at it was the Lord I don't feel like it's fifty dollars and 50 cents I feel like it would be more like 500 trillion dollars that I get and he gets a nickel from me now maybe some of you have a higher esteem of yourself than I do but the closer I get to him the more I realize how little I've done for it I used to your brother brandemus he would say that he had set back up on the headboard and put his hands behind his head something like this I would imagine and he was began to think about that song Lord let me look past the curtain of time and as he did a voice said would you like to look past the curtain of time and he said yes it would help me so much and as he lay there he thought boy your past 50 years old you haven't done anything for God now listen past 50. by that time Millions had already been touched by his ministry thousands had been saved thousands had received the Holy Ghost thousands times thousands have been led to the Lord and as I first come to the message in Nigerians say that you remember about the time frame it was in early 1960 when he had this visitation I thought well you know maybe it was just him saying that in a humble way but as I learned more about him and about his ministry I realized no that wasn't him saying it in a humble way that's the way he thought about himself and I've realized great people the closer they get to God it's not the bigger they think they are it's the smaller they realize they are you see those who think they are so great and just go on and on and on about themselves whether or not you understand it it shows us the true picture that person isn't very close to God at all because if we ever get very close to him we'll realize how great and wonderful that he really really is how insignificant and how small and what little we all have done and yet when we stand there that day brother George Burcham which used to come to the church I Pastor in Kentucky he lived there in a little place called Albany Kentucky brother Branham came to his house 1965. brother George had a cheese plant where they made the cheese and the curd stage and the raw stage and real fine crumbly looking stuff brother random came there and brother George and his wife liked Antiques and he came to brother George's house brother George said he wouldn't even sit in the furniture he sat on the floor and set cross-legged like an Indian and he would cross his legs and sit there they tried begged him to sit on the furnace no no no no is that such pretty pretty stuff I I wouldn't want to sit on that so he sits in the floor brother George said he was a type of a man that would talk about you and make you think you were so great and you were just sold this and that I wonder sometimes if we understand what greatness really is and yet this great one the Lord Jesus that we're talking about wants to share everything he has with us and he doesn't want to wait till the other side for everything to be shared but alas there are some things that cannot be shared until we get to the other side much of what we get is absolutely given to us as a free gift with no work no praying no fasting no labor on our part but there are some things that he wants to give us that requirements are made and one of these rights that he wishes to share with his bride is the right to reign to be on a throne with him to him that overcome us will be granted the right the privilege the honor to set with him and his throne as he has overcome and sat down with his father in his throne can you and I imagine this morning that when the Rapture takes place this word will so make us ready we will go straight from Johnson City Kingsport Bristol wherever it is you live straight from this world into the presence of God and will we will be so prepared by the word and the ministry that God's given you will need no supplements you will need nothing along the way between here and Heaven to make you a better person to finish up what you've liked this word will produce such a character of people in one moment you are a mortal facing all kinds of battles all kinds of Trials and then the next moment you will be standing there in a body that is made like unto his own glorious body you will then be changed and brought into the court of his majesty I'm not talking about now a place where a judge is or maybe a mayor and a few years ago or brother Mike Walsh took us to the White House and we was able to go to the White House and see some of the different famous people and while I was standing there the vice president at the time Mike Pence came out and was shaking hands with the people and I got to shake his hand the Bodyguards of course all around him and they rushed him through and I have to say that was quite an honor seeing people that are the rich and the famous but who are they compared to Jesus you and I were never more than likely be allowed allowed to to the White House would never be a personal guest of the president or of some great person and yet the greatest one that ever lived invites you daily into his courts and what's so sad is there's days that go by and we don't even go we don't even use that opportunity that is given to each of us to come into the presence of almighty God and I find that so amazing that he understands the Frailty and the weakness of our Humanity and he loves us in spite of ourself aren't you glad he does the Paul when he Taps into this in verse 17 he said if children than air is Heirs of God in John heires with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together I want you to notice how Paul so they'll use the word prudently as he sets Force this High exalted position he elevates them to this top part of this verse notice what he does before he introduces the word suffer he elevates them to a position that only God could do so he says that if children than heirs Heirs of God join heirs was Christ and he goes from that to the very next part of this verse if so be that we suffer he didn't mention the suffer part first but he mentioned the great elevation that God had given by grace then he brings in the painful part the higher Joy the higher glorification first then the pain then the suffering the pleasure the happiness the extreme joy and then the pain the suffering how many suffered as a Christian if you've been saved very long I guarantee you you have what's amazing is that all of those of us who suffer as being a Christian that is attributed for the sake of the Gospel now whether you're a young sister that is laughed at because of your hair your dress because you don't have makeup whether you're a young boy that's like that because you don't talk and drink and cuss and act like the other young boys at school or at college where you go whatever it is that you go through the Lord Jesus actually attributes that to your account as if so it was himself being persecuted again so everything that you go through Peter says it this way in First Peter chapter 4 verse 16 yet if any man suffer as a Christian now all of us suffer things that are self-inflicted we can do some pretty dumb stuff can't we well come on be honest we have all done pretty dumb stuff we've acted dumb we've taught them we've just acted you know pretty ignorant sometimes and then we've suffered because of that but you're not suffering because you're a Christian when you do something stupid that's your own stupidity and mine right but now Peter wants to characterize and show them the differentiation between them doing something and messing up and then suffering a persecution because of it or if any man will suffer as a Christian now notice what we're supposed to do if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God on this behalf now I'm not sure about you but I'm still working on the last part of that verse because there's a reproach there's a pain there's can be great sorrow and difficulty in suffering for the cause of Christ now some would take this as if though that it's only say Martyrs or only those that are persecuted because they're a preacher but not so you see God will commit some to death God will commit some to suffering in their body he himself has the power to heal them what are you about to say a word all you have to do is just look the direction that thing would be gone but he actually incorporates their life into bringing glory to God by bearing something sometimes for many years and yet it is attributed to bringing glory and honor to the kingdom of God term limited John chapter 9. a very familiar story that all you Bible readers know and I'm sure you'll love it John chapter 9 it is about the blind man and as Jesus passed by saw a man which was blind from his verse now let's get the setting we don't know exactly how old the man was but it's not considered a boy or a use he's actually identified as a man and if you read whenever you want to on down of course to verse 7 8 9 10 on down you'll find I think it's in verse 8 that the Bible says that he set there as a beggar now I want you to say the background of this is he was born blind he had never seen in his entire life so he was blind from his verse and his disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither had this man sin nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him so you mean this man sat there for years for years waiting for the works of God to be made manifest in his life I wonder how much he was ridiculed how he was laughed at now this man as far as we know ever become a preacher but yet the Lord God was able to do something through his life that he never done through Peter and that was that the works of God you see God needed someone in this kind of condition what couldn't the Lord have allowed some accident to happen just say a week prior to this and the man will say fell out of a tree and got a concussion and he lost his sight and he couldn't see well he went to one doctor another said you know what it looks like that you're just blind for the rest of your life and it only happened a week ago well then Jesus would have come to town a week later and the man would have come up and the prayer line is would say and the Lord Jesus would have healed the man and his suffering would have been very short-lived huh but every local person knew this man so the links of time was a further Vindication of the glory and the power of God now had he fallen out of a tree or some type of freak's accident that the people said well his sight just come back well the doctor would have said well why sure yeah we've seen that before that's what it was but God wanted it to be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was the Healer but have you ever thought about the pain this man must have bore to give God these years of his life how many Summers was he robbed how many beautiful flowers he never got to see maybe he would ask people what does the sun look like I feel it I feel that I come here early in the morning and I shiver in the cold and it's chilly but I can feel something as it touches my skin and warms my hand and I feel it as it moves up to my arm and then touches my face well that's the sun well what does it look like exactly well it's a great bright ball in this in the sky and it's great Illuminating Light and and then well tell me tell me something else what's that I hear oh that that's a bird a bird what kind of collar I don't know it's just a bird you know people like us that see it every day and we don't even pay no attention to it we don't even thank God for the breath of air that we breathe and we don't thank him because we can walk come on we don't think him cause we got two hands and two arms that we can raise and praise him and you know how we are we just take it for granted but wait what tell me what's the bird look like what color I don't know I've heard it all in my life I don't know what it is it's just a bird well somebody please tell me what what's the what's the plumage on the bird well what about this what about that he had been robbed for years for this reason the glory of God needed to be made manifest brother Paul I wonder how many times he was laughed at you know how cruel people can be I wonder how many times he was made fun of he had no way of making a living he was a beggar can you imagine begging every day of your life and yet Jesus says but the works of God should be made manifest in him so Jesus was going to prove that he was God by opening a Blind Man's eyes that had been blind from his birth so he was robbed that God might have Glory I wonder how many of us are willing to be robbed of this or that or the other now don't get caught on me already now if God needed someone in this day that could be healed of some terrible terrible disease or sickness but he must prove it by this specialist and that one and another and a scan and an MRI and a CT and this one and that one and a doctor here and the doctor there and a doctor over there and another doctor over there and then when God does it records from from one state to another how many of us would be willing to say Lord I will four of us five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve takes us a while to think about it on to process it and say now Lord I don't want to commit to this if I can't do it you see how the glory of God Is So intertwined with our life and yet sometimes the glory of God cost the recipient of those works such a price I find this amazing because the disciples the preachers they didn't look at this man as an object of Mercy but rather a subject of a discussion about theology so they never even looked at the guy and said poor guy is there anything we can do for it Jesus have mercy on him oh God please be mindful they don't even look at him but that way at all but they look at his situation and they go to discussing the theology of how did this man get this way may God help us to never be so cold and so indifferent oh don't you want to be touched don't you want to be touched by people's failures and their weaknesses and their frailties and their infirmities so the disciples look at him and you know imagine how it must have broken the very heart of the Lord Jesus so what we see in this that Jesus is showing a greater view of suffering which had not up to this time been viewed correctly we remember job of course and different ones in the Bible in the Old Testament and they went through a suffering but yet it was still not brought us clear as it would be in the New Testament so Jesus brings out a view in the New Testament and then Paul picks it up Peter picks it up Paul writes about it in Hebrews chapter 12 if you'd like to read that with me verse 6 and he says for whom the Lord love us he chastened us which means to train children to be instructed talk or learn to chase sin by Affliction of evils and calamities while anybody in line behind me for this oh wait a minute maybe I should be behind you listen now what the what the chastise with blows to scourge of a father punishing his son for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth not only life about it sometimes about going to church well what do you expecting to church today a woman I'm going to church to get beat up I'm going to get the hot tore off of me and I know we life about it but I'll tell you one thing you ought to be one of the happiest human beings on the earth if God corrects you that means your sons and daughters that means he loves you you ought to be so grateful he won't let you do wrong I never even make you feel bad about it there are people that claim to be Christians there are men that claim to be preachers and they can cause one of the biggest messes ever was in the ranks of a message or in a local church or whatever and never feel one bad feeling from God at all they will tear up this and that and the other and spew out their false Doctrine or whatever it is and will cause all kinds of situations and never feel terrible at all oh my goodness I'm so glad that my Holy Ghost if I think the wrong thing if I don't even have to say the wrong thing if I say the wrong thing if I get the wrong attitude praise the Lord Brother JD told you about an attitude I had one time hey I'm so glad that when I do that my father won't let me go on and say well it's okay it's fine it don't matter it does matter to our God and that not only matters to God but it matters to his children notice to whom the Lord loved us he said he's chasing us and Scourge us every son that he receive us so every son that comes to God will be chastened and he will be discouraged and chastised notice in verse 7 if ye endure chastening now notice the further stage of chastening so God could spank you or correct you and then you get an attitude and you still don't go on to placing but verse 7 brings the volume of it together if ye endure which means take patiently to remain not to recede or flee to preserve under misfortunes and trials to hold fast to one's face in Christ they are bravely and calmly ill treatments bear bravely I mean needs help this morning by bravely and calmly ill treatments if he endure chastening God deals with you deals with you house with sons for what sign is he whom the father chasten us not now the disciples are going to get of you into the history and the sadness of this man's life and yet the glory of God is going to be expressed in him in a way that was not expressing any other character in the entirety of the New Testament we don't have time to get into it this morning but I'd like to take this man right here and show you the mystery of redemption lays right in the very life of this man even the very word that Jesus chose to use to send him to a certain pool signified the mission of the Lord Jesus to the Earth but watch this man the disciples wandering now and the Lord Jesus totally blows our theology out of the water and he said neither one of them but this man was born blind that the works of God might be made manifest in his life so the disciples are going to see it now the man himself is going to receive two aspects of Illumination he's going to receive sight in his eyes but he's also going to receive sight in his soul praise God for this man was the very one that stood up before the scribes and the Pharisees and said for they know that God here is not Sinners but if any man be a worshiper of him and do us his will him he hear us whether this man be a sinner or no I don't know but this one thing I do know where I was blind now I see the prophet said this guy had some pretty good theology on himself now so this man is fixing to experience the glory of God but look at the price look at those years he would never regain them brother Rob all the years as a young man we don't know if he was married or not scripture says nothing about a wife or nothing about children the only thing it mentions as far as family is his father and mother now you said why didn't his mom and daddy let me stay at home why in the world when they come right down to it whenever they said they'd asked to ask the mother and father said what about this guy I'll tell you what he's old enough ask him they wouldn't even stand with their son after he had been miraculously healed by the power of God and yet the Lord Jesus said this man was saved for this purpose this man was reserved for this purpose as a matter of fact I knew it would happen and I allowed this to be on him and there was a time I was going to take it off I hope you understand what I'm going to say I want my life to bring glory to God anybody else sometimes that might be by me laying my hands on the set and them recovering other times it might be by me preaching and someone gets saved someone get filled with the Holy Ghost and it might be other times that God would allow me to go through a trial and a test of my faith and I stand there and I will not be shaken I will not be moved and I wait for the day of my Deliverance there might be times that God will let you and I go through something like this man that will be prolonged I pray carefully myself about such things as this and I say God unless you have a reason for this going on longer would you move for me speedily now this is the way we've been praying for Erica for a long time lord unless you have a reason for this going on if there's a reason somehow that you want another doctor to see her another nurse to see her that will have to testify of the glory of God then we want that to happen but if not Lord make a hasty Miracle out of her life look at by the wrong Spencer he told me some time ago one of his doctors told him at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville that whenever he is healed it will be one of the most proven authenticated Miracles that have been in history why because one scan after another one doctor I try another one test after another if God would have healed thy brother the very moment that he found out about it there would not be near as much proof and all sometimes I wonder about his pain his heaviness when I know a person not long ago he vomited eight times before going to church to preach on Sunday morning you think he wouldn't rather be healed you'd think he wouldn't rather have it behind him you think he wouldn't rather be able to stand and not have to have to deal with all that he deals of taking all these pills every day of his life and the doctor sent him a few ever stop it you will not live no time it will overcome you and you will die but what if God has a reason to bring Glory but he has to find an individual that is willing to suffer that God can use them For That Glory I changed my mind I don't want to be first in life let's start back there and we'll make the end of the line right up here on the platform we'll start back there anybody willing I didn't think so but Eddie what is it about us all we want the God is God don't we want God to use you for something but we want this I wouldn't you see it takes a very special person to be able to be tried in this life when you see others being delivered others being healed and changed by the power of God and God touches you in intervals and moves for you something is unmindful but a psyche touches you with this touch and attached to the touch is the words wait for further explanation so he brings strength how many has ever been there whenever you just felt like you were at the end of your rope and you didn't know what to do and you felt like you couldn't make it another day and the spirit of God would touch you and help you and yet not totally deliver you and then somebody else the next service turned into a a praise testimony or I want to thank God I'll tell you what I come to the prayer line and I needed this this and this and God heal me God delivered me and you're thinking God I was right behind them I was right behind them in the line I needed it too Lord I needed it why didn't you hear me but can God trust you for two more months can God trust you for another month what about his sisters can God trust you for another few more weeks can God delay let's set this way he would get this much Glory if he healed you immediately but if he waits and he strengthens and he encourages and he uplifts and he helps you and he helps you and he goes a month two months six months a year and then he goes way Way Beyond all of that and he gets going to further back he gets all that Glory but he'll walk close to you you may not be able to go on picnics with your children you may be even knocked out of service sometimes you may not be able to go shopping the meditation don't feel like even getting out of bed oh can God find some that we'll be willing for such he will and don't worry he's not looking necessarily for volunteers he's looking for the chosen every man under your Testament cannot be this a preacher in the message could not go through what brother Ron's pictures went through I think this morning and I sit and thinking about him of my dear little precious friend brother template God in his wisdom chose to take my little brothers wife that's with him standing back down the other day when my arms around him both of us crying because of sister Karen's passing and I have to be honest I hope and pray to God does he like it I said brother tell me how you doing buddy he said brother Donnie I've just I'm going on I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to commit to him but he said it's so hard he said men care and we're close thank you and Carol I was down to use Camp I saw Miss sinner going to their house so miss said I thought my goodness I miss seeing her just getting to see her a few times a year I cannot imagine what they're doing myself if Mother Tim would have had a choice and a preference and the Lord had said what do you think I'm thinking about taking Karen what do you think I know anyone left to know everybody said no Lord don't please don't take her how will I live Lord but somehow I don't know how somehow God will get Glory do I understand why the Lord wanted to take one of my right hand men brother Jim bath my brother Jim was sick I never ever thought he would pass never I thought no we need him too much no Lord you no you can do I understand why brother Gene Lehman do I understand why I don't on and on I could go but I know this Our Father makes no mistakes but I guarantee in fulfilling the will of God their hearts setting you today that are still dealing and suffering what's the loss ask my son-in-law Scott if he still misses his daddy that's my daughter Alicia she misses she loves Jimmy like a father second father ask my granddaughters I said Courtney sister Lindsay don't need to ask her you know how she feels some of the rest of you that have lost loved ones and you think in a premature time why would God do such somehow he will make it work to his glory you go unservatively brokenhearted yeah one of your greatest treasures taken from you I hear the prophet as he says when God took my wife and my little girl and he said the thing that shook me and I couldn't understand it and he said that then some time later I saw her as a young woman on the curtain of time you remember the story he saw her as a young woman and I saw that wagon and the Broken Wheel and I looked at her and I realized thank you Lord if he would have let her lived she might have turned away from him so he had to take her you can hear him still in 1965. dealing with the loss of that first life and that little baby still dealing with the pain and Satan come to him no doubt year after year well you know what the devil told him standing at the casket he wouldn't even have to look your way he wouldn't have to say a word yeah you've served him and you've done this and that and the other and look at him now now he won't even answer your prayer the prophet said I was about to the place and I said well if that's the way he is but he said thank God there was a typos and I said the Lord give and the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord because I can't say that I fully comprehend what's suffering in time and suffering as a mortal does how that it translates into qualities that are eternal but we know he himself suffered greatly that he might become part of us aren't you glad he did notice Paul says in First Corinthians 4 9 if I think that God has set forth us the apostles last were appointed to death we are made a spectacle unto the world the word spectacle here is a word associated with the Roman Arena so but this time they're already doing the Gladiators and so on in the in the arena and Paul was placing the apostles as they were out in the middle of the arena and The Spectators were on looking notice how broad he makes the audience we are the spectacle to the world to angels and to men so the angels are watching while the apostles are being laughed at ridiculed made fun of the world is looking on and other men are looking on and Paul is trying to understand God why would you make us as the apostles you set us forth last but yet the apostles were the ones who were called first notice how it goes on my in verse 10 for we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ notice the difference between the leadership and the body or how we reverse this around down Through the Ages I'm going to make Idols out of the preachers that show wasn't the way it was in the New Testament Almighty said we are fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honorable but we are despised even unto this present hour we boast hunger and thirst and are naked and buffeted Lord have mercy can you imagine the Apostle Paul being hungry Lord I'd love to be able to bought him some deep wouldn't you him being hungry being thirsty and didn't even have the proper clothes to wear and yet one of the greatest men of God that ever stood on the earth why why God is getting something out of his life which does not come as praise and honor and so on begotten by suffering and yet the apostles names are in the foundation of the city for eternity every time you go in and out the gates of pearl and you look back on those walls that will be the names of The Twelve Apostles in that great City they will have great honor but think of what a price it costs Lord God we are naked buffeted and have no certain Dwelling Place I labor working with our hands being reviled look at the word to reproach rail at revile Heap abuse upon we are reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat look at the Opposites being defamed they make fun of us they laugh at us they call us all kinds of names and we entreat which means Comfort to call to one side to admonish exhort what's being molded in these men character worthy of foundation identification friends do you honestly think a lot of these radio preachers and television preachers in the modern days would be the worthy kind of men to have their names placed in the foundation of the city of God we being the bride we're different from the church we're different from people that are just saved there must be a character from us that must supersede and go beyond the church can I have a few more minutes being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world off scouring refuse metaphorically the most abject and Despicable men isn't that strange you and I would count it as such an honor to hung around Paul but yet they were made the filth the filth of the world why getting ready for Glory you see we're on a journey to the throne remember Joseph's Journey remember David's Journey remember Esther's Journey to the throne character must be molded from the call and the summons to the crowning a character must be molded in us which will match our Lord heart God as the filth of the world and all the off scouring listen to this word off scouring which is wiped off dirt rubbed off scrapings so the scraps the dirt the grease the filth the off scouring the Athenians in order to avert public calamities yearly through a criminal into the sea as an offering to Poseidon hence the term become used for an expiratory offering or a ransom so Paul is looking at himself and the other brothers in the leadership of the church and said we are the filths and the off scouring we are an ax theater ransom for you as the bride oh my Lord let's read a couple more scriptures if you don't mind second Corinthians chapter one verse 3 blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Mercies and the God of All Comfort who comforters Us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the Comfort we're with we ourselves are comforted of God you ever looked at it in the right way if there's anybody ought to be able to pray for somebody that's got cancer it'll be somebody that's got cancer or experience it and got healed or had a family member why they know a little bit about the pain if there's anybody that ought to be able to have a feeling for a caregiver of someone who's terminally ill it ought to be another caregiver that has to minister to a mother or a father or a child now notice Paul says then who comforteth Us in all of our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble do you understand instead of us feeling sorry for ourselves whenever we go through so much stuff if we'd only read the scripture right we would realize God does not do this to put us all to where we live by ourselves excluded from everybody else the rest of our life but God wants us to connect with others who have been through a similar saying I'm not talking about a psychological therapy session I'm talking about a child of God ministering from their heart to another child of God no wonder the Bible says when job prayed for his friends God turned the Captivity of job why because God wanted him to reach out and realize the finale of his ultimate Victory is not pointing to himself but reaching out to others oh my for as the sufferings of Christ abound in US so our consolation also abound Us by Christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which also we suffer for whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation that I may know him and the power of his resurrection listen this is where the nominal Church stops that I may know him in the power of his resurrection the cross the cross the tomb the cross the tomb the cross the tomb the cross how many churches around Tri Cities today and that's as far as they ever appoint their people to I want to point you to the other part of that verse because I believe there's bride sitting here but I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings the fellowship of his sufferings several years ago I was a brother Fred Mullins the sister B down South Carolina I mean Carol and they began to tell us some of the things they went through as a young boy and a young man and young girl and a young woman of how they were treated by sometimes white people and how rough they treated him the names they used and the names and synonyms and things that they were called it absolutely broke my heart as I sat there tears welled up in my eyes as I heard what they had been through but yet in one sense of the word I could not relate because I'd never been called those names if brother Joel Brown would have been sitting there brother Joel is sitting at the same table he would no doubt be able to relate in a way that would be foreign altogether strange to me both of us humans both of us with feelings maybe he and I both sitting there were tears in her eyes but he would have flashbacks of his own things that he's been through for the same cause why because people have a race problem and I'll tell you there ain't no children of God full of the Holy Ghost has got a race problem if you claim to be a Christian you got a race problem you better get to Holy Ghost amen it would touch me and it did it broke my heart but brother Joel would have an affinity that I would not have don't you understand that's the way God was God could hear the anxieties of his people he could hear the trauma he could hear the wise and the wherefore he could hear all of that but he could not relate until one day he came down and sat down around the table himself and said now I know how John's going to feel now I know how Mark's gonna feel now I know how this man this woman now Brothers I know how you're going to feel when the prophet of God said he himself suffered sexual temptation listen if those words suffered suffered sexual Temptation you know as well as I do if you've ever had any bad Temptation there's some Temptation well it bothers you but there's others they actually cause you to suffer and the Lord Jesus allowed himself to suffer he allowed himself not only to get sick but to be tempted in such a degree that it caused him anxiety and stress and suffered second Corinthians chapter 1 verse 6 whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation notice Philippians 3 10 that I may know him and the power of His Resurrection The Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death second Corinthians 4 8 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed let me close with this we are perplexed but not in despair I love this this is one of my favorite scriptures not forsaken you see no matter what you're going through if you look at it the right way there's a positive that always goes with your negative but if we're not careful we will focus only on the negative so let's focus on the negatives in this verse persecuted cast down always bang about in the body beat whipped made fun of suffered stripes now if that's all we want to focus on we can or we can focus on the rest of the truth persecuted but not forsaken glory to God how many can say Amen to that stand to your feet if you have been persecuted but not forsaken by the grace of God how many of you can say by the grace of God I've been cast down but not destroyed Oh Glory how many has been run down run over and everything else but not give up by the grace of God have you felt like it oh sure those times you felt like it but something down inside of you would not let go well he said glory to God I'll tell you one thing I made up my mind to quit which time yeah I'm glad it ain't determined by us making up our mind he made up his mind before I had a mind always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for which we live and are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in US but life in you verse 15. for all sayings are for your sakes that the abundant grace matter the Thanksgiving Amendment down to the glory of God for which court call us we thank not but though our outward men perish get the inward man is renewed day by day now listen at all these things that I have described and listens the way that he puts it up in verse 17 for our light affliction which is but for a moment all of that hey I ain't even finished with it I'll wait till we get to more of it there's more yet to come and he called that a light Affliction it's a man in time looking to Eternity and comparing what eternity is going to give to what he went through in time and he said it ain't even nothing it's like it is it's but for a moment oh it'll pass away so fast [Applause] praise God asparagus Lord Jesus thank you Lord God father we love you today Lord I'm sure that under the sound of my voice in the visible audience and invisible as well Lord many have been through so many things Lord I'm not talking about self-inflicted or things that we've caused and brought upon ourself but since being your children oh Lord God we have to be honest with you Lord we don't always understand why you do what you do but we have to trust you and know your ways are absolutely perfect oh man what a contrast between the service last Sunday morning live Sunday morning when we saw Esther going up to her position to be crowned my we all rejoiced it praise God now this Sunday morning we're brought back down to the journey to get from the summons to the crown we endure a little bit more about the suffering and the the problems that we in face are that sometimes engulf Our Lives Lord and we have to be honest with you we don't always know how you're going to move or when you're going to move we just believe you will in your time I don't think there's any of us here today Lord that would want to walk down streets of gold I don't think there's any of us here today that would want to walk into the paradise of God and have to be babied that you kept every trial and every test away from us but I dare say there's probably just as many that would say Lord I'd rather you didn't take my husband I'd rather you didn't take my wife God don't take one of my children God don't let me have a terminal sickness where I'll be sick for years on end please God I beg you don't and I'm so glad Lord that if we would even think such a thing that you look down on us and you say I understand for you yourself did not want to go to Calvary you did not want to die the prophet said you loved your disciples and you didn't want to leave them y'all had gotten so close and you were the best of friends and you didn't want to have to leave them so you prayed if it be thy will let this cup pass from me Lord Jesus thank you for understanding our Humanity But ultimately what we want is for you to have your way and our lives Lord God Hallelujah how many be willing with me this morning just to raise your hand and say Lord here I am take me use me whatever you want and keep in mind friends before you do that the will of God will never lead you for the grace of God cannot keep you well brother Donnie I'm afraid what if he does this or that well if he does you found confidence and you found favor in his eyes there's only one job in the Old Testament or is only one there's only one blind man like this God knows what you can go through and don't don't ever get under that fear oh God what if God will do this what if God will do that don't live under that fear just live under Trust knowing that if he allows you to go on this track and this path he's using it for a purpose and he'll help you and he'll strengthen you and when you get there that day he will reward you for your pain and use your suffering because you submitted to his will I imagine when we get there that day and brother Tim sees sister Karen sister Linda sees brother Jimmy all these other brothers and sisters oh my goodness they meet their spouses and the Lord Jesus will have a reward for him you didn't understand why I took him you didn't understand why I took her but I had a reason and I saw my greater glory and I saw the greater good but I'm going to add this to your record I saw the tears you cried I saw the lonely nights that you spent I saw the days when you run your hands and you said I'm finished Lord I have nothing else to live for I have no more joy in my life I will reward you today my daughter for your sacrifice I will reward you my son for your sacrifice the Lord oh Jesus We Worship You Lord God take us Sister Clay father God into your hands today moldus shape us make us Lord if you delay help us to endure if you say wait a while I've got one more doctor I want to look at you and then after that it'll be your seventh time around Jericho and you're totally delivered we don't want to Rob Your Glory from you to heal we don't want to Rob Your Glory from this or that Lord God In The Name of Jesus help us in our trials help us in our test father that we can be faithful oh Grant it Lord granted Lord Jesus Hallelujah
