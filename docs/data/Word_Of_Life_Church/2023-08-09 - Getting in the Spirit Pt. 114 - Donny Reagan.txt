measure is power has no boundaries known unto man for out of his infinite riches in Christ Jesus close give him [Music] oh he giveth and he giveth [Music] [Applause] [Music] stand how many knows he's given to you over and over and over again so much more than any of us ever deserve as far as deserving I'm glad that the Bible tells us that his mercies are renewed every morning and their privilege for us to be gathered together here tonight in the house of the Lord let's turn to First Corinthians chapter 12 if you would verse 14. First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 14. we'll read down through verses 18. for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I am not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am not the eye I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole we're hearing where where the smelling but now God now listen how this all comes about God hath set God hath said we don't get to choose our position we don't get to choose our position in Christ and we don't actually get to choose our position when it comes to being in the local body now you've always gone people who want to do this and that and the other in the church and you've got some I find it such a Marvel because many times people who want to do this or that or the other they're not gifted at all to do it and some of the ones who are gifted you have to pump them you have to Prime them you have to pull them you have to coax them you nearly have to beg them and you think why didn't the Lord give that to the people who wanted to do it all the time generally brother Bram says the man who wants to do it is the man who's not called to do it oh what a way to start the sermon but you see God sets it in the body but now has God set the members every one of them so whether you're big or little you know however you categorize yourself really we shouldn't look down on that or we shouldn't look up to and think wow I am really something because God gave me this and this and what choice did you have no so if God gives us gifts what can any of us brag about since he's the one who gave them to us so if I was going to give away say a hundred thousand dollars tonight which is a joke right so I chose to give you a nickel you a dime you 15 cents you 20 25 30 dollar two dollars three dollars four dollars five whatever it was could the person who received forty fifty thousand dollars because they say boy and I something brother Donnie gave me forty thousand you know gave him a nickel what what could you brag about is it not from me so if one preacher would be able to reach thousands times thousands and thousands of people in his ministry when he's on the earth and affect people all over the world and God did that and then another man would be not very much renowned maybe a pastor of a little small church or maybe an evangelist that would preaching very very tiny small churches could the other guy which is more famous as we'd say have anything to brag about more so than the man that God give the smaller portion to no should that man give more glory in the eyes of people you shouldn't he does but he shouldn't because God is the one who gives them out is that right let's read it again but now God has set the members every one of them in the body notice the way he does it and the reason he does it as it has pleased him so if it pleases God to make you a little finger that's all you are now you may look at that and think why that thing ain't worth nothing well let me just give you a little preview of what I'm fixing to read to you in a minute your little finger attributes 50 percent of the strings of your hand your little finger how many of you knew that you mean the medical people didn't even know it brother they hadn't heard you didn't know that now would we have ever thought that 'll tell what you're trying to do you try to do something without it and you'll realize how weak the rest of these bigger fingers are the way God made it so if you're a little finger tonight we need you big time but you see you don't have to be the biggest around or the longest you just have to be where God puts you isn't that amazing that the smallest one on the hand would contribute 50 percent of the strength of the hand you mean more than these big guys well that's the way God does it in it I love him for it myself I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as we pray Heavenly Father we believe you have some wonderful things in store for us tonight I pray that our understanding would be an enlightened Lord that you would open our understanding help us to see and realize father that it's not us that places ourself it's not us that we can choose from a multiple choice that I would like to be this or be that or be the other but actually the prophet tells us we would save ourselves and you a lot of trouble if we would go to him who brought us on the Earth and say why am I here what am I here for I pray you'd help each of us tonight father that we would be able to do such that we would be able to give everything we are to the cause of almighty God and have confidence in you that placed us and set us in the body so size is irrelevant how many people we affect is irrelevant what's important is we fulfill our setting because that's all you require of us speak to us to not from your word father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God bless you Saints you may be seated now looking at the human body and the way that Paul dealt with it as we looked at it last week about the hands the eyes the ears the smelling the hearing all of that I went into a little bit more research and study looking at the human body I've always loved the way that David said it in Psalms 139 verse 14 and he said I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well now David would not have been aware of some of the things that I'm going to share with you tonight as far as physiology and the scientific part of the body he would not have known more than likely Paul didn't know it because medicine had not Advanced to the stage that it is today whenever Paul likened the different parts of the spiritual body to the eyes the ears the hands the feet but Paul could see that there was a great comparison from the natural body to the spiritual body now what I'd like to do tonight with the helpful Lord is to be able to give you a little bit of understanding in the way that God Made You and I want to help you see who and what you are just in your anatomy in the natural side and look and see at some of the Marvel and the Wonder in the way that God made you and then surely if we can look at that we would be able to see what a great spiritual comparison it would be to the spiritual body so again David said I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well well I'm sure you all agree with me that God Don't Make No jump does he so whether we are little or big fat or skinny whatever we are uh you know our race or whatever that that sort of thing that we are it really doesn't have any relevance in the state of God loving One race above the other or one skin color or one person because there are more you know more handsome than the other or or a lady that's more beautiful than the other but God places him in the body as it pleases him now I find it a Marvel in myself when I look at the mystery of the human body I want you to just listen to me carefully now put some of this up so you can follow me along based on an adult man's typical volume you might conclude that the human body contains 15 trillion cells 15 trillion cells now I Marvel at how many there are and then I got to thinking I wonder who counted all them to know how many was there now think that your body contains an average-sized man would be 15 trillion cells and yet God knows every one of them and God put the ability in those cells to do what they're supposed to do now the body is given great power in that it can heal itself my brother I'm taught us this as far as back as the early 50s that Life Is A Healer so healing is within you Satan found that out of course many many thousands of years ago so what he tries to do is affect the healing power that's in the body and even cause what we know today to be auto immune diseases and right now they've got right at a hundred that they have named a hundred autoimmune diseases and you know what that is of course it is sees to where the body will attack itself so the body from within the body the protective system it will begin to attack parts of the body because it looks at them and it thinks that it's a pathogen or it's something that's from the outside and the body is somehow tricked so the immune system begins to attack your own body I mean understands what that is now you realize that Satan tries to do the same thing in the spiritual body of Christ now this is why he always tries to use people in the body to bring attacks on people in the same body he will do the same thing inside the church he'll do the same thing inside a local assembly he'll do the same thing inside a move of God that we're all part of so he will send a spiritual autoimmune disease then I'm sure you know it but a Celiac disease that's exactly what it is diabetes is of the same type of thing many many many of them so it's an autoimmune disease so a person that would have a heart transplant a liver many different organs of the body they will have to put them on certain drugs and keep them on those drugs basically the rest of their life because the body will sense that that liver was not part of that body whenever it was conceived in the mother's womb so the body will attack that liver that the doctors transplanted to save your life so they have to put you on a drug to trick the body well you realize Satan found this out many many years ago that the spiritual body is made very much the same way so if each of us would find our place in the body and do what we're supposed to do then we would not render ourselves our minds our opinions our mouths our different views and so on uh to the devil to where the devil will be able to attack say our our church or in a family now you take a family they can be the same way that if that family will run together on the same motive same purpose same objective then Satan won't have anybody to work through but if he can get one member of that family and the prophet tells us in question answers 1964 if one member of that family gets nervous and tore up then the whole family gets tore up why because that one member gets tore up so then it's like an autoimmune disease and Satan will use that husband that wife that child whoever it is and they will begin to attack the rest of the entire body so it's the same way in a church it's the same way in our mood now there's brothers that have been around the message for years and years and they begin to get a superiority idea about themselves and they begin to think that they have some type of Revelation that is superior to most everybody else in the message so this is where all the major doctrines that have come and have divided the message people over the years it started with a man somewhere well let me rephrase that it started in hell and then the devil got a hold to some man on the earth that had an arrogance problem and then that autoimmune disease that spiritual disease now whether it started in England or in Germany or in New York or in Jeffersonville wherever it was it started with an individual and they began to listen to an evil spirit and they become affected themselves then if they were a preacher then most of them aren't then they would have to go in among their following and they would begin to attack the doctrines that they've been hearing for 25 30 years 40 and they would begin to from within that local assembly begin to attack those doctrines and it would set up that autoimmune disease then of course it never stops with that church but it wants to spread so to go beyond that church to another to another to another before long it has swept the world in a matter of months now it's amazing how the internet is it's a great tool but Satan also learn how to use the internet himself so a man here in America can start out on a false Doctrine or an error and if he gains a certain following around the world years ago it would have taken that man months or years to be able to go from Zimbabwe to Zaire to South Africa to Tanzania to China to Korea but not anymore all he's got to do is have a certain following and then he begins to stream his his ideas and his ideology and he will become another autoimmune disease that will begin to spread all around the world globally in six months he's covered the entire Earth wow and what is it it is a disease that has attacked an individual and it wants to attain other individuals that are in the same mood you understand what I'm saying now that's what happens inside of our body so what is it that tricks a person that is a Celiac so something within their body it begins to attack them now it's amazing because they don't always understand exactly how it starts because some of them aren't always born that way but it's not they begin to develop this certain thing so one day something inside the body begins to trigger so this person that is has eaten wheat and they've ate this and that and the other for months or years and all of a sudden it makes them sick and they start breaking out on a rash or a hive and whatever the symptoms begin to be and they get to where that if they eat this it can almost kill them and then they go to a doctor and they say I don't know what's wrong I don't know what's wrong doctor well what's happened what have you been eating what's this or that or the other and then they track it to trace it down and they say well you know it's a Celia it's this set if you always been the swing no no I've always eat this and drink that it's never bothered me what was it something in the body began to change change and when it does then it begins to attack what was normal for years and years can't you see the way Satan does now he tries to do marriages the same way an autoimmune disease come between the man and his wife and they've been happy for years and years and all of a sudden something will come between them and they're getting attacked on every hand if they don't put a stop to it it'll destroy their marriage it's the same way in a family an autoimmune disease will begin to attack them and it used to be a peaceful happy family they seem like this all on the same page they have the same motive same objectives how many times have we seen it in families and also churches is that right so what is it then it's an autoimmune disease spiritual that will begin to attack somebody in the church and they go to run into the church with an idea or an opinion or a Doctrine or whatever it is and and Satan will try to get on this one and that one and the other one and people that they've loved and fellowship for years and years they get to where they won't even speak to it they won't have nothing to do with them anymore well that's the same thing that happens in a person's body when an autoimmune disease will begin to attack them now notice how marvelous that we are made and how wonderfully that we are made so watch this in the human body would contain around 15 trillion cells now if all those cells will stay what they're supposed to be then they will fight now God divided of course the blood to whether there would be white blood cells red blood cells and we know that the whiter the ones are the soldiers they give their life for us to be able to try to hone in on a disease or a pathogen that enters inside of our body and they fight and they give their life to keep you from dying well I believe that there's white blood cells as we would say in the body of God and they watch over us and they're the men of God that God is called to try to watch over the flock of God and yet there's also others and they identify themselves as white but it's perfectly clear that they're not they're actually a pathogen which identifies themselves as a white blood cell and many times the people they trick the people into believing that they are a white blood cell when in reality they are a pathogen now the prophet tells us that all diseases are fourth dimension diseases now I know cancer and all the rest of these diseases do not begin in time now they can look at it with a microscope and they can say well it's of this family and this and that and the other but they do not have a microscope that will be able to open up the fourth dimension which is where they start so a demon comes out of the fourth dimension and it will get into a cell which is backslin backslid now it tells us this of course in demonology 1953 also 1955 also 1960s several different places so a cell that is vaccin now it becomes bruised as we would say then so this this Spirit gets inside this cell now the spirit cannot multiply human cells it cannot create human cells so it has to find a backslidden human self same way in a family same way in a church so then this demon will take this human cell that is back sitting bruised wounded whatever you want to call it and then that cell will submit itself over under the influence of this pathogen or this demon Spirit now this demon Spirit then will take that and cells have the ability within themselves to be able to divide themselves you understand that they have the ability that's the way you started in your mother's womb so that cell has the ability that demon can't do that you see there's no more demons today than there was when they fell in the beginning they started out as angels of course and they fell how many ever that they are that their words in there's no more tonight Satan has the exact same number so they cannot divide themselves and multiply and then divide again and multiply but Satan had to break him to the realm of the fourth dimension to break into the body and then get a cell that's backslid and then that cell can divide itself now those of you who don't understand cancer you know that cancer cells are different than other cells in our body our cells have a built-in mechanism created by God to whether they have an on and off switch toward that they will shut off cancer cells don't have that cancer cells just keep on and keep on and keep on and keep on they don't have they often on switch and this is why that they will overpower a human body but I'm glad tonight our father has an off and on switch for cancer cells now watch what will happen then in the same way spiritually whenever a spirit a spiritual pathogen will try to get into a marriage or a spiritual pathogen or try to get into a family or a church or a move of God then they will start multiplying and this one will have false Doctrine then they don't want to keep it to their self what do they want to do they want to share it with someone else and then someone else and someone else you see what they're doing they're fought on the exact same pattern that demons do from the fourth dimension into a human body oh my goodness I hope somebody's hearing me tonight so God made the human body in such a wonderful way to where that it would be able to reproduce itself God made us in such a place in such a way that actually our skeletal system is totally renewed in 10 years you don't have the same vertebrae that you have when you were born your skeletal system is totally renewed in 10 years your your outside layer of your skin it ain't the same one that you've had since last year it totally renews itself and changes can't you see the the remnants of eternal life are actually in our body now if we knew what to look for you see what will happen in eternity is we will go back to eating vegetation we will not eat cattle we will not there'll be no meat eaters there there'll be nothing that will die in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve would have plucked the fruit off of the trees and it was not giving their life of course and they was constantly knew it whenever we go into the paradise of God we will go back to a body which will constantly renew itself and the prophet said it this way that those people living inside that City and they're eating from the leaves and the fruit off of that tree they are constantly renewing their use they are renewing their use it's in you and I tonight already to do that oh my goodness yeah y'all y'all still want to go with me tonight on this journey all right now watch this look at look at something else here messages from the human brain travel along nerves in our body nerves at up to 200 miles an hour so messages from our brain move along the nerves now it's amazing how that God when he chose the electrical part of our body and of course we have electrical part in our heart and we have electrical part in our brain and the electrical part is what conveys the messages back and forth so the the message for your finger to move it's not dropped in the bloodstream so it's not dropped in the endocrine stream or the lip stream but it's dropped on the neurological side of your body so God chose the neurological side and the brain is all all hooked up to all the nerves going through your body and then whenever you will think of salt it travels at up to 200 miles an hour to be able to go from your brain to your little finger or your little toe whatever it is there are more bacteria in a human Mouse than there are people in the world somebody passed the Listerine wow can you imagine that more bacteria in your mouth than there are people in the world a human's little finger contributes over 50 percent of the hands strengths a human's little finger contributes over 50 percent of the hamstring I'll tell you what if I stopped right now and we dismiss we ought to be able to walk out of this place tonight and say it was good to be in church because you may think you ain't nothing but a little finger this or that or the other don't you look at that and say well I'm of no value I hope that you never look at yourself again the same way I'm not talking about now in a form of arrogant surprise and remember it is him who placed us to be what we are in the body if a human being's DNA were uncoiled now listen to this it would stretch 10 billion miles now every one of you sitting here tonight if your DNA was uncoiled it would reach 10 billion miles from the Earth to Pluto and back that's just in your DNA now you've seen the pictures of the DNA right the way it goes around the ladder and all that sort of thing so it would stretch 10 billion miles from Earth to Pluto and back all my you mean our god did all of this and you know to me it takes more faith to believe that we jumped out of some green pond way back under somewhere some frog or something or we come from a bunch of monkeys than it did that the Lord God made man in the Garden of Eden oh it makes to me it's a lot farther out how in the world could you and I ever come from some pollywog or wallypog or whatever they want to say we were and all of these intricate systems that are in our body and every one of them work exactly the way they did there ain't no way or brother Donnie it was Darwin's theory it was Darwin's baloney Darwin Siri ain't got no truth to it the truth of it is in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and it was God that made man in his own image oh my notice this for an adult human taking just one step uses up to 200 muscles now look at all that you have done for your entire life and you wasn't even aware that you were doing it so tell me how have we walked all these years and we didn't even know it was taking about 200 muscles to do it you see it was committed to us so if there's so much about ourselves humanly that we don't understand and don't know I wonder how much more spiritually there is about us Oh Glory I hope the Lord will open our understanding tonight and help us to see there's a great parallel okay now can you imagine how complex it would be for us to try to figure out which 200 am I using now or which you know what you'll wind up doing falling flat on your face but you know what God did God committed much of what we do and the way we move and the way we live and the way that we exist to what element our subconscience you note as well as I do that if you're familiar with a certain set of steps you can go up and down them steps never even think about it is that right but you ever notice that you will stumble or trip when you go to thinking about them steps and you watch yourself why you're pulling that from the subconscious running it through the conscience and the conscience and the subconscience are clashing one with the other if you'll let the subconscious how how do you figure you Breeze at night when you're asleep how do you figure your heart pumps at night when you're asleep how is it that you figure when you need to go to the bathroom and you're sound asleep as I don't know what and all of a sudden you'll wake up well it's that other party about the part of your body said hey you go to the bathroom come back go to sleep how is it that your heart goes it's that subconscious so God committed much of it it's the same way with our faith walk that God commits much of our walk into the subconscious level which the prophet said was Faith he said the Lord Jesus was unconscious of the face that he was and he said he didn't think well I've got to go see if I've got enough Faith to do this and he said a real believer that walks in that realm of Faith you're totally unconscious to that Faith itself oh I'm trying to have faith in trying to have faith you're pulling it away from the subconscious and trying to pull it up here in your head but if you leave it into the man in the engine room he he will believe from this man here still trying to figure it out you don't have to think about how your heart's going to do this and that and the other how is it in the four cycles of sleep that you come into the first stage into the second stage you don't even really need that much in the third and fourth stage with an hour or so too maybe and you go into that deep cycle of sleep and you can wake up because you're only there so long but you'll be there long enough to where you get that deep sleep that you need and you're able to wake up and feel as refreshed as you can be because you're in that cycle you don't even know you're doing that you don't even know that your heart rate's on down your blood pressure's on down this is why they say if you wake up two or three o'clock in the morning it's because your body temperature is changing and your body kind of Shivers a little bit and then it'll bring you from that unconscious state to the conscience State and then the body will set the well now you're Wide Awake the worst thing you can do is look at that clock sitting on your nightstand so they say so you accept on your look at it you look at it and you look at it but the best thing you can do is start controlling your breathing and slow down your breathing because you you cannot go back to sleep totally impossible through your breathing as long as you're fast breathing and you're nervous and you're anxious and you're watching the clock oh I got to get up in an hour and a half I've got to get up in two hours anybody ever done that beside me on your watching that car watching that worst thing you can do but begin to concentrate Slow Down slow your breathing why the first conscience is taking it away from your subconscious and your first conscience is nervous and the subconscious if you don't lay down I'm gonna smack you let me have this breathing let me have that I'll put you back to sleep if you'll let me but you won't let him will you you're so anxious you're so nervous and that's why Satan wants to make us afraid with doctors reports and the scans of this and that and the other and we go to thinking and fearing oh no oh no oh no what am I going to do let your unconscious face have it and it will handle it and bring your Miracle but if we keep holding on oh how will it be what when will it be I don't know I don't know oh my goodness I'm getting worse I'm getting worse but let Faith have it faith will look at it and say it don't make no difference if I get so bad or die if God if it ain't God's will for me to die he'll raise me back up again that's what faith will do oh oh thank you Lord a human skeleton renews itself completely every 10 years look at what you're doing as you're sitting here tonight you are renewing yourself the body can detect taste in point zero zero one five seconds which is faster than the blink of an eye isn't it amazing wouldn't it be bad I mean you're just eating eating eating it took about 15 minutes for the taste hitch and you go oh is it amazing how quick who was it that did that who was it they gave you that almighty God what you know what I see when I look at this I think if God did that for the natural body hasn't God provided for the spiritual body of Christ as well that if we would just listen and we would follow the Divine protocol of God how much stuff that we'll be able to spare ourselves but it's when we break out of the continuity of the head of the head that God places this is why Satan wants to pull us away from the word because the word ought to be our headship every move we make the things we do the way we live whatever we do we ought to run it right through the word of God if we did we'd eliminate a lot of problems oh my god listen about your brain the brain contains 86 billion nerve cells joined by a hundred trillion connections 86 billion nerve cells joined by a hundred trillion connections that is more than the numbers of stars in the Milky Way in your brain and who was it that wired all that up who was it that put all of them billions of nerve cells in your brain and made all them connections almighty God what if the devil gets in there and goes to twists in one of them and trying to contort it and twist it around and try to make you sick can't the one who made them in the beginning go back in there and rewire it and straighten it out it's amazing to me when brother Brandon would pray for people many times that was blind and he would rebuke that demon that had a hold of that optical nerve and in one place he called it by name Optimus Optimus you Optimus I imagine that devil got his hide scared off you'll imagine being able to peer into that Realm of the fourth dimension and either hear or see that Demon's name which we're not even sure if it was ever even called before in the open from Adam on down oh my God so the devil will try to affect one or a hundred billion or 50 or whatever it is of these cells but cannot the Creator which made them fix them so a a cancer what's the the blood block that comes up through your neck the way that the doctors describe it there's a blood block by which it's supposed to filter most of these bad things from coming into your body and this is one reason why they never hadn't done a head scan or brain scan on Eric of nine months or so because a neural endocrine that she's dealing with very rare did they ever go to the Head maybe half a dozen people in decades something never even done one and this is why whenever she started talking out of her head a bit ago that they'd done one and that's just one they found those places in the head and the doctor said that this is so unusual it should not pass through the brain the blood block that comes up that goes into the head but he said that cell is so small that it's smaller than a blood cell and it was able to go through there and pass through the blood block the way I look at it if it was small enough to get in there the Holy Ghost can get in there and root him out praise the Lord if the spirit of God made these bodies cannot he get in there and fix everything in there that's wrong can he do it thanks now notice God and what a great thing an adult human body is made up of about seven octillion Adams seven octillion wow in an adult human blood circulates 12 000 miles a day what a journey so your blood's done travel about 11 500 by the time I get done it'll probably be fulfilled its cycle 12 000 miles your blood brother I serve your body 12 000 miles a day praise God you were fearfully and wonderfully made wonder why gonna to move that fast it's on a journey it's carrying oxygen it's carrying nutrients it's carrying waste it's got all this going on so if Satan can slow it down in the body and the blood flow slows down what happens to us what happens to you if you sat on your leg or whatever it is and it goes numb as we say him he's ever done that or your foot go to sleep or you're like well you cut off the circulation you ever sleep on your side or however you sleep sometimes and you wake up and a hand on to sleep or an arm going to sleep as we say something has cut all or at least hindered the blood flow and that's the way Satan loves to do inside the spiritual body of Christ he wants to slow down the blood of Jesus Christ flow so if he can slow down the blood flow and slow down the flow of the life and the nutrients of the spirit of God then what do we do we go numb setting in a pew we ain't got no feeling no more we ain't got no emotion no more why the blood supply slowly come on somebody the blood supply is slowing down this is why we need to keep that blood afraid why it keeps feeling in your hands it keeps feeling in your lips it keeps feeling in your feet to where they don't go to sleep hey we're not sleeping virgins we want to be wise virgins that are worshiping and praising and loving and blessing the name of our Lord we want blood flowing through our soul we want blood flowing through our church [Applause] all praise the Lord and an adult human blood circulates about 12 000 miles a day this is like traveling from east to west across the widest part of the Pacific Ocean now can you imagine twelve thousand miles Carol and I several years ago flew on the third longest flight in the world the third longest flight was on the 747. I had some brothers share with us just yesterday visiting the church from South Africa and that was talking about how terrible the flight was how awful that it was and how long it was same flight that I had one airplane 19 and a half hours you're not stopping every little city between here and there that's Non-Stop 19 and a half hours and yet your blood travels more in one day than that jet plane does isn't it amazing and I I think about it myself and I know you'll think I'm weird anyway and you're gonna think I'm even more weird but I want you to think about you've got this pump inside of your body and it's pump pump pump you got blood running through all these vessels and all these veins inside of your body wouldn't it be so aggravating and so annoying if you heard that punk going all the time and that blood going it'd be so annoying but think here it is this close to you how come I don't hear it all the time how come that I don't hear the the karate already going up here in our veins of going the biggest ones in your body and yet why don't I hear all that going through all the time and it's so close to me he made it to where all this is going on inside of our body and yet maybe it's so comfortable and quiet [Laughter] oh praise the Lord but God couldn't make a human being who could make such a marvelous thing well let me bring it on down who but God could make this great and called The Bride of Jesus Christ man has tried to make him man has tried to make copies of him but there's only one creator that could be able to make a mystical move called The Bride of Jesus Christ there has never been anything like it and there will never be anything like it it is God's special creation praise God a human eye can distinguish between approximately 10 million different colors now think of the spiritual body so we have people in the church that can do this and others that can do that others that can do that what if it's all one heart what if it's all just one big ear one big eye and yet each one of them are so excellent in the purpose that God placed them for listen to this a person takes about 23 000 and 40 breaths a day on about 672 million 768 000 breaths in a lifetime praise the Lord how in the world is it these lungs can breathe that many times in one day how is it that I could breathe that many breaths in a lifetime they say in my lungs say Donnie would you please quit I need a break any y'all ever had your lungs to take a week off isn't it amazing they've been doing all this function for all these years how many hundreds of thousands of thousands and millions for those of you that are up in your 50s and your 60s and your 70s how many millions of times have they inhaled exhale inhale exhale inhale exhale and not one day off don't even take a Sabbath they don't even take a rest but they're constantly there for you but do you appreciate them most of us don't do we say lungs thank you so much for being so faithful you see if we're not careful that's the way it is in the body of Christ we tend to give praise to those that are so visible the part about us what are most of us known by our lungs are most of you known by your liver are most of you known by your kidneys how do most of us know you your face your face and your face oh my is what gets the recognition your face is what we identify you with is this right that yeah you take away all those hidden parts that's in behind the face and what have you got a lifeless face oh my I pray that ever long in here tonight every kidney ever blight or ever little toe or whatever you are we'll walk out of here tonight and say praise God there ain't nobody can take my place if I am a part of this assembly I am just as important as the face is amen notices you get a new top layer of skin epidermis every 30 days you're faster than a snake you just saw snakes shed their own skin oh maybe it's that old serpent connection we've got I don't know I'm just saying look for this is going on in us every day every day these great things wonderful things are happening where here look around us in our assembly in our move and our message wonderful sayings are happening every day every day every week every month wonderful things are happening and we're looking for what oh I'm waiting for a big move of God what come on now let's go inside the systems y'all y'all okay y'all to know you're just coming to medical school tonight did you let's look at the systems now in the human body the circulatory system and the cardiovascular now for those of you who are medical people forgive me if I butcher these words the circulatory system or the cardiovascular circulates blood around the body via the heart arteries and veins delivering oxygen and nutrients to organs and cells carrying on their waste products away as well as keeping the body's temperature in a safe range your body contains about 60 000 miles of blood vessels now see I've described Parts about you tonight that the most of you didn't even know right so it took somebody that knew not me medical people that knew I just simply Dr Googled it and then by them understanding and somebody else studying their understanding I was able to bring something to open your understanding of how fearfully and wonderfully you are made the digestive system and that's a story system the system to absorb nutrients and remove waste via the gastrointestinal tract including the mouse esophagus stomach and intestines now look at the systems that are going on inside of you tonight now more likely most of you ate supper four or five whatever time it was while you're sitting here these systems are going on inside of your body well you see this is why Satan wants to take away part of the vital systems that the church needs and the demon out of hell that gets on many message people trying to tell them they don't need a pasture well come on preach brother Downing or it'll get on them tell them well you don't need an evangelist all you need to do is just listen to tape or all you need to do is listen to brother Donnie because he's the only one that's the same it says it's the same line Devil with a different lie they're trying to tell other people all they need to do listen to a tape of brother Brown God never put one Pastor in the message he put a whole bunch of them God put evangelist God put teachers it's God that did that not you and I we do not vote them in in that sense of God placed them there himself God is the one who put him there and if you strip out one of these systems that we're going to talk about tonight in your body you will die it's the same way God has got a five-fold system inside the body of Jesus Christ come on somebody say amen and it's not tape tape tape tape tape it's pastors evangelists teachers prophets amen why because God placed them in the body as a system that would work the body we will never be a whale body come on somebody we will never go into a Rapture trying to deny four out of the five we've got to have all five you can't choose which one you want you cannot leave out the digestive system and ever live you cannot live out the endocrine system and ever lived but God placed them in our human body and God placed them in the spiritual body if we ever needed pastors we need them now if we ever needed Godly Holy Ghost filled evangelist and teacher come on somebody an apostle missionary we need them now and thank God if we need him we've got them because God placed them in the body not us ah another system in your body the endocrine and influences the function of the body using hormones now I find this absolutely amazing because the digestive system has nothing to do with this one but works together with it you know the prophet once they're only described a pastor and an evangelist and a teacher and told what they were and he said when asking the question actually 61 how do you know what you're supposed to do said well what I do is I look at the person that's claiming they're called to be this or that or the other because God will always work with this creature the way that he's made him so he said if a man's claiming that he's called to be a pastor a pastor cannot be a flighty person um yeah a pastor cannot be a man that's so easy discouraged you'll be surprised at the preachers that I have to encourage to come to church you'll be surprised at the preachers that I've had to encourage over the years to be faithful to the house of God but you want a man like that to be your pastor now can you imagine a man claiming that he's called to be an evangelist he Parks his car at Walmart and it takes him two hours and 47 minutes to find it when he comes out he'll be late forever meeting he ever preaches he has no sense of direction this one's done one thing I tell Carol said if we did believe in wonderful preachers I know you ain't one because Carol gets off of an elevator and I'll tell her whatever comes instinctively for you to turn go the opposite way that's just the way it is bless her heart I love her and I love her to death I've been married to her for 50 years and she ain't never learned which way is the right way she'll be out there looking look and look and look and where do we part the car said you with me I'm good so as I said well what am I going to do if I have to go by myself I said find you a row number find you something or you can be like the Arab thing that somebody sent me not long ago and an Arab man suck out through there and it was all kinds of donkeys everywhere and he pulled out this remote out of his pocket went this when the donkey went ah so you see a man that's called to be an evangelist his makeup will be totally different from a pastor come on somebody that's the same way in the body of Christ that God places the system so the blood the blood the communication channel the electrical circuits and the body each one of them work together do you think you need electricity in your body we've had several people in our church and the Heart gets out of rhythm what is it most of the time the electrical side so they will have to go in there and what do they do to that heart do medical people tell me they shock it right oh why don't they use some other means because what's out of rhythm is the electrical part so they have to shock it in order to get it back in Rhythm uh-huh sometimes that's what we need sharks sometimes it's your electrical parts it's kind of all messed up you know your mechanics is good and this and that but you just ain't got enough humph about you you just ain't got enough electricity and you need a good electrical shock I got to come out kind of just smack around on you a little bit and I take my jumper cables they said all right I got I'm feeling better well praise the Lord that's good but you see hormones won't take care of that and some of the oxygen won't take care of it sometimes we need a good old electrical shock to put us back in Rhythm was what God's saying was what God's doing what's what God's got on his mind come on somebody whatever God wants it's what we want [Applause] praise the Lord the digestive system now this is probably one most of us are more familiar with than any other also the exitory system the system to absorb nutrients and remove waste via the gastrointestinal tract including the mouth esophagus stomach stomach and intestines now the endocrine system totally different it does with the hormones in the body now this word right here is that oh it is a doozy um if I want to pronounce it for me and take him in Terry well they all making no funny face so apparently y'all don't know it either integumentary system or and also the extra credit now that's the system that compromises or comprises rather the skin hair nails sweat another exocrine glands wow and that don't have nothing to do with electricity so what if you decide well I don't want this system no more you're going to look awful funny and walk around just muscles you see if we take away one of these we die we God that's just that simple the immune system and the lymphatic system defends the body against pathogens that may harm the body the system contains a network of lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph now notice even as important as the blood is these have their own route by which they travel designated vessels that carry lymph many of you know if you've had loved ones or friends or you've heard about people and they'd get cancer and they would go to checking what lymph glands right why that's where everything will go and the lamp will try to catch it and stop it and they'll go in and take out part of this and part of that you see this is why Satan hates real good old-fashioned gospel hard preaching he wants it to be all watered down he wants the lymph fluid to be kind of watery and weak and then sin begins to creep in the church and the preacher becomes afraid to preach anything because you might lose his job well praise the Lord we need some lymph fluids still flowing through the body don't we now notice the muscular system which enables the body to move using muscles nervous system collects and processes information from the senses via nerves and the brain and tells the muscles to contract to cause physical actions so what if the muscles got tired and say I am sick and tired of you Mr brain ever since I was a baby you have told me what to do whenever that doctor smacked me Mr brain it was you that told me and I kicked my little t-90 feet in my little legs who Do You Think You Are the boss just because you're at the top of the body does that mean you're the smart guy and I'm a dumb guy come on muscles well why don't we switch this around let's make the big toe the brain let's let it start telling us what to do you see God has a system like that in his church oh my Lord did I lose connection or something I mean this is why God sends one Prophet Messenger to the age and then he has other ministry under that and as they say Faithfully what he said then the body will move on until you get somebody in there that disconnects from the head and they say well I I'm not sure that that the prophet was right on that now I'm not sure well you know what our church is Sovereign you have to watch people when they go to say in that because what that means is this they feel like they have their own little Church of their own big church whatever it is and most of them when they go to say and they're Sovereign what that means is they don't go along with what the prophet taught about this or that or the other and somehow they fill out their little sovereignty in their body that gives them the authority to override the word and where did you read that in the comic books at because you sure never read it in the Bible come on somebody I don't we are sovereign body that's exactly right but none of us are sovereign over the top of God's word come on somebody no our sovereignty does not mean that we don't need the word and every word of it it simply means as a body we vote in our pastor our deacons so on and so on but every member of the body around the world this is what makes the bride an absolute phenomenon in that there will be people you and I have never met and yet they are moved upon by the same Holy Ghost they believe the same message that you believe they speak a different language they're raised in the in the jungles of India or Africa wherever more and yet when the Rapture takes place they'll stand right there before the Lord Jesus clothed in the garments of the word the same way you and I will come on somebody they may be speaking Hindi they may be speaking Afrikaans they may be speaking a language totally different from us but they will stand their Blood Washed Holy Ghost Field Spirit fed amen blessed name of the Lord why the same holy ghost in America the same holy ghost in Kenya the same holy ghost in Tanzania the same Holy Ghost around the world and the same Holy Ghost has got a digestive system and he's got to end the consistent and he's got an electrical system in the body and there ain't enough Devils out of hell to stop it there will be a bride because God said so I don't care how many preachers say it won't be I don't care how many believe the sound this and believe the sound that they will never stop God's bride because God himself said I will build this church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it right praise the Lord there are nearly 46 miles of nerves in an adult's body the renal system in the urinary system the system where the kidneys filled to blood to produce urine and get rid of waste well sometimes we have to have a clean help system too I'll tell Carol sometimes I believe I work in the sanitation department of Heaven I hear so much jump so much trash try to help people clean out the garbage of their lives but somebody's got to do it aren't you glad God's got a cleanup system where would we be tonight if God didn't have men that knew how to clean up people's lives and how to guide them when they make absolute idiots out of themselves God's still got a cleanup system in the body Hallelujah some of our young people be leaving sometime early in the morning going up to a you can't some of them might need a little bit of digestive Department some of them might need a little bit of heart arrhythmia others might need this and that and the other but some of them might need up the cleanup department they might really need some of them men a God that's going to be preaching to get down in there and throw out a bunch of pornography out of their life and throw this out of their life I'm glad God's still got to clean up Department in the ministry well it ain't popular no I don't know any preachers that really wants to deal with it but I'm glad God still got some men they're not they're not ashamed to get in there and roll up her sleeve and get their hands dirty if they've got to why they love God sheep more than they love their pride hmm a couple more I didn't say I was done it's just going to let you rest a minute reproductive system reproductive organs required for the production of offspring now you know the sad thing about it is in some of these moves it's been around I know some of you don't even know them but one on the perusia basically saying Jesus has already come in 1963. they don't take communion no more they don't have revivals no more they don't believe in a move of God no more what's the matter with them the reproductive system is gone they're sterile that's why they have to steal members that's what they do now you notice a lot of these moves and you watch you watch the moves of the preachers that do them and you'll watch what they do they don't have the power to birth people so they steal people from other moves or other churches huh look look Stadium study every move that's been down through time and you'll watch what they do why they don't have life themself any god-called preacher has the ability to pass eternal life I'm sitting there look at me all bug eyed the prophet of God quoted that and said when Jesus said in Saint John 14 12 these works that I do so you do later he said that greater work is imparting eternal life a real God called preacher has the power to beget children that's what I've told you before I'm not interested in trying to steal nobody's sheep from no other church I don't have to do it I don't have a father okay well Hallelujah I said I know how to file their children you know how I know I was taught by the father himself what are you talking about brother Donnie preached the word and it will beget his own kind so we don't have to apostolize people we don't have to go ahead and Rob from the Church of Christ and Rob from the Baptist and Rob from here and there I want to hear who God wants here is that what you want I don't have to go around telling people I've never begged one person to come here I've never pulled on one person I've never asked one person to come I've never spent no church and ain't going to start doing it now but I have the power if I'm filled with the holy ghost ever God call man brother John has the power bow the Holy Ghost living inside of him if he's part of this body he has a reproductive capability and the genus of God Amen that's why we do not have to apostasize people we don't have well let's go over and see if we can steal some from the Baptist let's see if we can steal some from the Pentecostal no sir let's not do it let's see if we can get them born again if they got a seed down inside their soul and they belong here so be it if they don't belong here I don't want them here myself okay Jesus the respiratory system brings air into and out of the lungs to absorb oxygen and remove carbon dioxide Indian amazing same lungs brings oxygen in takes carbon dioxide out so the same preacher that can bring you Joy can make you mad on a hornet the same preacher that can make you feel like shouting can also make you feel like pouting skeletal system bones maintain the structure of the body and its organs oh how wonderfully may I say to the bride of Christ around the world dear lovely elect lady how wonderfully mermaid no wonder Satan fights these in the natural body and fights them spiritual body we do ourselves and our move a great credit when we try to make everybody like us every Ministry the same we're not every Ministry the same but what we want to be is have the same motive the same objective the same desire right you ever notice do you ever think about it we'll get into it in a few weeks I wonder why Paul never did write a letter to the church at Jerusalem I wonder why Paul never did write a letter to some of the other churches that Peter established not the original Church some other church was in Jerusalem I wonder why Paul didn't go to that church and preach and hold revivals I have the answer but I'm going to tell you I said I've not made you mad now don't you love him don't you want to be whatever God made you to me if I have to work for the Sewer Department Of Heaven praise God some of them people I pulled out of the sewer and I got Mighty smelly with them we'll walk down the streets of gold one day oh my some of the other preachers my buddies and my friends and my pals oh goodness gracious they're not really in the sewer department of Heaven they worked for the florist of Heaven they get to do all the fine freely nasty things of Heaven others of us have to get down and roll up our sleeves and do this and that and everything God did you hate me but aren't you glad God's got different ones in the body to do different things and you see this is where we get in trouble because we'll look at someone else's position and say why can't I be like that and preachers if they're not careful will change their Administration and they'll start finding the edge of where they're supposed to be and move slot right of it just to be a little bit more likeable you never know what they believe you never know exactly where they stand on this or that or the other because they're not really going to say and if they're being recorded of what they're going to preach they're never going to say anything that's going to get them on CNN never I know that may hurt some of you but it ain't nothing but the gospel truth so little electricity little finger little toe little nose a little ear whatever God's calls you to be walk out of here tonight with a changed View of yourself and maybe that brother or sister sitting around you that you just don't understand and you think and they don't understand me well they probably don't but yet if God has placed Us in the body cannot we all work together for one common goal let me just share this with you there was a certain preacher several years ago and he did a lot of prison work he come and visited us and I went to the prison with him some and that's a different thing altogether believe me going to prison and preaching to people of all kinds and this brother was so critical of everybody that didn't preach in prisons and I went with him to this certain place and you talking about feeling out of place I mean I felt out of place but this man prior to his conversion had been in prison he was a criminal so he'd been in prison so I watched him as he got up he got up before I did and I watched him as he got up and he started using all these terms it was about like speaking in tongues to me I mean I didn't understand hardly nothing the man was saying laugher and two-timer and this and that and the other thing what in the world but this man knew the lingo that would get to those people that was in prison and I watched in just a few minutes first time they'd ever seen him had never been to this particular prison but yet there was a connection that was made with them people and I thought isn't that amazing that God never put the man in there but God took him from what Satan did and turned it around to be able to use it now here I get up you know my background only prison I've ever seen whenever daddy smacked me a few times so I felt so out of place but I preached on a conscience being purged and what I found was I made a connection with their souls not with their lingo I don't know how many of them hardened criminals come and give their heart to God went to another state exact same thing happened again and I told this brother all brother Donny people I'll take a bunch of these lazy preachers I said brother I said I watched you as you operated like that I said everybody's not called to do that I said let me ask you this he's been to our church and I said how would you like to walk out here before these hundreds of people that I pastor and you have to deal with the garbage in their lives you have to deal with our fusses and their arguing you have to deal with them when they become dilator and they won't come to church one little thing and they stay home and go to Walmart I run into them at Food City after I've been to church and preached like a horse and then I ran into them grocery shopping they say ah brother Donnie I didn't know I was going to see you here I was like no you sure didn't did you let's see the church no no no it's amazing how people can do whenever they said I couldn't take it I said see so if everybody was natured like you there'd be no pastors to be able to deal with the same people over and over and over again know their worst mistakes know their greatest shortcomers and you see that's why a man that's not called to be a pastor does not need to be one because a god-called pastor can hear your worst mistakes he can hear the filth of your life and pray you back through to repentance and the next time he sees you he can look at you with love in his heart and put his arm around you and feel the same towards you that he did before he heard your terrible terrible sins but a man who ain't called to be a pastor can't do that do we need them all we do I need every system in my body did anybody think of one tonight when I was describing you that you just decided I don't want it no more I'm tired of it I mean I we need them all do we need evangelists in our church do we need preachers that'll come in from other places and preach to our church do they need prayer lines and do we need men that will preach in a different way some that might go deeper than others and some shallower than others and some move around more than others do we need them do you need people that don't always go along with you I'm surprised I got so many amends on that actually we do don't you love him with all your heart the sparrow handsome praise the Lord wow father what a great thing you made when you made a man all these things about us Lord and probably one of the medical people tonight would know what I've spoken about maybe and know much more of course than what I have but these things go on within us and have every day of our life and we don't even realize it Lord it is so easy for us to judge and categorize and well they're not like our church and they Don't Preach like our pastor and oh help us Lord no wonder the prophet told us not to be cliques and Clans make ourselves clannish but to love one another to be a part of one another Lord whatever we are tonight in the body help us Lord I I can't say I'll be honest with you sir I can't say I enjoy always in my part there's lots of my part I don't enjoy I'm sure with every other man and yet Lord the same blood that carries nutrients will carry out excretions the same lungs it brings in fresh air and in my lungs would have given out about 55 minutes ago or so whenever I started I would have not have completed the sermon so they were bringing in fresh oxygen taking out the carbon dioxide all of us as we have set here we have in and out in and out in and out our blood has traveled No Doubt couple of hundred and maybe even a couple of thousand miles or we've been sitting right here all this going on inside of our body and we're totally unaware of it Lord God it makes me appreciate so much how you made us you're an awesome God I thank you for my heart I thank you for my legs I thank you for my feet I thank you for my lungs I thank you for all that Lord Lord then I thank you for the ministry Lord I Thank you for those that preached different from me I thank you for those Lord that you may anoint to go in a Direction that's totally different not not not error but yeah Lord see things in just a little different way to illuminate us that we might benefit one another so we can see from looking at these systems and we could take the restrictions and the limitations of each one of these systems in the body and realize not one system is complete within itself but you divided the body into these systems in each one when it works properly complements the other and keeps all of the systems and the body working together and what does it produce when they're all doing it a body in the land of good health but all it takes is one one system to mess up Lord today from our church we had three of our our sheep having surgery three different ones had surgery today Lord they went into the hospital early this morning and knowing what the doctors had told them and father thankfully all three from the last I've heard will went well the surgery went good but no doubt they feel so tender around those positions tonight of surgery and tomorrow and especially the third day it'll be so sensitive that'll be the focal point of everything they'll pay their attention to Lord the brother with a torn meniscus he'll ought to be so careful not to bend his knee and not to walk and not to fall the other brother Heaven repairs and his hernia another individual Lord don't have to be so careful and so cautious Lord help us I pray father that when we have members of our body that maybe they're going through a surgical procedure and they need a little bit of special attention may we be able to reach out to him father maybe be able to love and just be a crutch to them if they need it Lord just be a little walking stick if they needed to till they get over it oh Father we want to minister to one another because who knows next week it might be me in in the need of a crutch it might be me Lord in the need of a little little help because I had a little surgical repair myself we need you Lord oh we all say that but help us not to stop there but help us to go on and say we also need one another one another we love you father with our heads bowed Before I Let You Go I wonder how many of you you see brother Donnie I never quite looked at it that way before I want to be what God Made Me I I want to be able to function better in the body would you just raise your hand to the Lord man women boys girls young men young sisters to be able to function in the body someone may need you to be able to help carry them you've heard the story I know brother Daryl told it to me again the other day it was told in Wartime our troops was having to leave this certain place I was under heavy gunfire and they were trained and taught to bring their wounded out but they was bearing down on them and the commanding officer saw this young man and he was carrying this fella this fella he was carrying was way bigger than him and he said soldier dropped that man then he turned back around giving orders to others he turned back around to look at that man and he said I told you to drop that man the young man kept packing him he turns a third time and said I give you a direct order dropped that man he's too heavy you can't carry him he said sir I can't leave him behind he's my brother so here was two brothers that were fighting in the same platoon and in the same battle and his brother had got wounded natural brother but he just couldn't leave him behind it's strange but we're one of the only armies that kick our own wounded we leave our wounded behind we step on them we find them down and we push them further down where one of the few armies that's been down through time they're crucifying our own leaders and divide our own platoons we break ranks you understand if this was an Army some preachers would be court-martialed because they break ranks and pull out from under a leader that God sends and will make their own platoon if they was in the military in the Civil War days I'll tell you what had happened to them they shot him they shot him on the spot look friends don't just look and say well brother Donny's position is so important it's not just my position that's important your position is important if God has given you a post of Duty you know what that means as it was in an army where the word comes from then you're said over a certain spot and you guard that spot if it's the rear flank if it's whatever it is then if you're not at your post and the enemy comes through and says you're not where you're supposed to be that will be the very Avenue that they will make their approach and come right in how many innocent lives might be lost because you was not at your post it's not just a preacher it's not just the deacons and the musicians but every one of you you have a post a position you don't answer to me you answered almighty God oh my Hallelujah how many wants to be in your post how many wants to be in your position remember one of the Prophecies of the last days in the Book of Joel and it was they would not break their ranks they would not break their ranks but they would stay where they were positionally placed and they would not leave for mother father no one else because they knew God had given them a position oh my help us Lord help us Lord praise the Lord take your weapons friends stand at your post of Duty my brother Donnie I'm just a layperson well you say that as if though that's not important that is very important what good would it do me to study days on end how long you figured it took me to put together the sermon tonight how much searching do you figure it took me hours and hours on end and what good would it have done if I would have come and preached it with no one here you reckon these chairs would have been blessed you reckon these chairs would have said amen I want to be that it's not for chairs it's not for carpet it's for people what makes a preacher's sermon worth preaching people there to take what he preached and live it and become it I believe that's what many of you desire to do tonight oh praise the Lord sing something for us Harry can we just worship a little bit think about the great mystery that you are as you stand there tonight now some of you as we start singing you'll start opening your mouth these processes that I've told you about tonight they'll be ongoing some of you will lift your hand you don't even think about doing you know where it comes from your brain and then your brain sends that signal traveling up to 200 miles an hour and all of a sudden this hand goes up and then that one goes up and then your eyes of course where'd this all come from the command center you've got to have a place that is the headquarters if not this one will go up sporadic that one will it'll go this way it'll go that way you've got to have a place that is the headquarters God has always had that you testify that the people who say they don't need a head they're false prophetess and Prophets their own body is telling them totally different if you need a brain you'll also need a pastor your own body testifies of the headship needed in a body and a pastor also needs a head which is the word praise the Lord can we just worship him a little bit before we go oh praise the Lord in this church thank you Lord It's a glorious church say your mind I was born I had a new birth go ahead one glorious day [Music] by his grace not by

Lord Jesus thank you Father oh hallelujah oh children our God is moving Among Us in such wonderful ways and so many healings my brother sitting the standing right here tonight stood for prayer just a few Services ago cancer in his body holes in his bones but yet they called me today and said the doctor told him it's like somebody went inside that bone and just touched it up and the whole Santana that's all good we'll give you a little bit more about that testimony but let me just tell you the very same doctor that brother is sin just happens to be the same doctor that Miss Erica Parker said so we're waiting for another testimony hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord do we love Miracles oh yes do we love signs wonders healing yes but I'll tell you one of the greatest things this our church could ever have is be so in love with Jesus and so in love with one another that the devil can never put a wedge between us can you imagine what a body look at him or be our signs and wonders it's going to bring us together the prophet said it'll be a paradox if he ever gets her together but he promised it and he will he will he will get us together you believe it God bless you serve us Sunday remember the camp going on up in Ohio some of her used to be leaving early in the morning heading up that way just pray for him that God will be with him visit him in a mighty way maybe we can just pray for that right now before we go father you see some of our use Lord going to the camp there two word Tabernacle dear God we're just asking that should be with them Father not only ours of course but those that are hosting the meeting and different ones from Louisiana and out in Virginia and different places they'll be coming from Lord may it be a special time maybe a great visitation of the presence of God lord Jesus help the ministering brothers that they can go down the Avenue Lord of whatever the body there will need oh Lord this makes it even more clear to me looking at the ministry of the word how sometimes we need electrical shocks sometimes we need digestive attention sometimes we need endocrine attention we need just all kinds of different tension according to what we're going through at that time may you anoint the men of god father give them the Direction Lord Lord we don't know how to run a meeting we don't know how to run a service sometimes we just get in the in in a form if we're not careful we think we've got to go this way and go that way for you to move but Lord may they just be so surrendered to you you just take every service and father it may not go the way they think but that really don't matter as long as it pleases you Lord God grant it we pray be with us now father as we leave bring us back here those that will be here on Sunday May you meet with us one more time we're looking for a great time in your presence Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus and the body said God bless you turn and shake hands to somebody standing beside you God bless you brother sister it's been good to be in the house of God amen God bless you back [Music] we'll fall in love with Jesus [Music] Falling In Love With Jesus
