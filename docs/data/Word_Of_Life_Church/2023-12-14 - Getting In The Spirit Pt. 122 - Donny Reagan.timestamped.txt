[43:23] to say while you're turning there that
[43:26] Carol I wanted to say how much we
[43:28] appreciated the uh youth choir several
[43:32] of them and even several adults showed
[43:36] up at our house on Sunday night uh to
[43:39] sing for us and it was just absolutely
[43:43] beautiful they just done such an awesome
[43:46] job and we wanted to thank them um
[43:49] brother Rob and uh the adults that came
[43:52] with him and drove and it was just so so
[43:55] nice you could just so sense the
[43:58] presence of God as they did that I want
[44:02] to thank y'all for doing that God bless
[44:04] you Matthew chapter 16 verse Verse
[44:10] 18 and I say also unto thee that thou
[44:13] art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[44:17] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[44:21] shall not Prevail against it I'd like to
[44:26] make sure that the devil understands
[44:29] that we believe this is the infallible
[44:31] word of God right so I'd like to read
[44:34] this part again Upon This Rock I will
[44:38] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[44:41] shall not Prevail against it so sloot
[44:47] you are fighting a losing
[44:51] battle 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse 14 now
[44:56] I want you to listen carefully to uh
[44:58] verse 14 and verse 15 because it's it's
[45:02] quite profound the words that Paul
[45:06] uses listen to this carefully now these
[45:09] things write on unto thee hoping to come
[45:12] unto thee shortly now remember this is
[45:15] actually written to Timothy but if I T
[45:18] long that thou mayest know how thou
[45:22] oughtest to behave thyself in the House
[45:26] of
[45:27] God which is the Church of the Living
[45:32] God I want you to think first century ad
[45:36] probably by now this is written
[45:40] 6566 ad they still for the most part did
[45:45] not actually have church
[45:48] buildings that's why the Bible does not
[45:51] give requirements for the office of
[45:54] Trustees do you ever think about that
[45:56] there's no biblical requirements or
[45:59] anything that talks about a trustee
[46:02] because they never had
[46:04] property they never own property thank
[46:07] God for the message which comes and tell
[46:09] us what the trustees do what they should
[46:11] do should not do so on and so on why the
[46:14] church gained property in around the
[46:17] second the latter half of the second
[46:19] century so whenever they talked about
[46:22] church in the first century they never
[46:25] thought about a building what they s
[46:27] about was the mystical body that would
[46:31] gather they would gather at rich
[46:33] people's houses John wrote about it I'll
[46:36] give you little spec of History here
[46:38] John wrote about it and he said that
[46:39] there was people that was coming in and
[46:41] he said they were spots in your Feast of
[46:45] Charity now they call them love Feast so
[46:49] what they would do the rich people
[46:51] that'd have a big house and they'd move
[46:52] the furniture out and they would just
[46:54] kind of put seats out there there so
[46:56] they would have church they would preach
[46:58] they would sing they would pray for the
[46:59] sick all that they did and then after
[47:02] they done that these rich people would
[47:04] feed all the church people so they
[47:06] called them love feast or charity Feast
[47:11] so the rich people did it so this was
[47:13] their church so when you read this in
[47:15] the New Testament and in the and of
[47:18] course the book of Acts and on through
[47:20] don't think about a church building
[47:22] because whenever they read this they
[47:24] would look at one another other and say
[47:26] well this is the church now listen how
[47:29] Paul identifies what the true church is
[47:34] how thou oughtest to behave thyself in
[47:36] the house of God which is the
[47:40] Church of the Living God look at this
[47:44] word church
[47:46] Ecclesia an assembly a gathering of
[47:51] citizens called out from their home
[47:55] homes into some public place so they
[48:01] were called out of their homes wow so
[48:05] you mean they didn't believe in staying
[48:06] home and just reading the prophet's
[48:09] books you see to be identified as a
[48:12] church one of the signs you were the
[48:15] church were was that you left your home
[48:19] to go somewhere where the saints were
[48:22] gathered together right now how in the
[48:24] world people think they can be able to
[48:25] fulfill the word of God and stay at the
[48:27] house and say I don't even need no
[48:29] preacher you need the Holy Ghost is what
[48:31] you need first cuz the prophet said if
[48:34] you get the love of God in your heart
[48:36] you cannot wait till them Church doors
[48:39] open back there and he said if you don't
[48:42] I'll tell you what it's time you got to
[48:44] pray
[48:45] in well praise the Lord a gathering of
[48:49] citizens called out from their homes
[48:50] into some sub public place or an
[48:53] assembly in a Christian sense Now watch
[48:55] how this has a dual meaning in a
[48:58] Christian sense an assembly of
[49:00] Christians gathered for worship in a
[49:05] religious meeting so the building itself
[49:09] was not called the
[49:11] church now we call the name of this
[49:13] place Word of Life Church many of our
[49:17] churches around the message are evening
[49:19] light Tabernacle and this Tabernacle
[49:21] Faith Tabernacle and Living Word
[49:24] Tabernacle and Tabernacle and church and
[49:26] Tabernacle but that's not the way they
[49:29] related to it in the first century they
[49:31] did not call a building a
[49:35] church they call the people the
[49:39] church now notice as Paul goes on with
[49:42] this he says that you know how to behave
[49:44] yourself in the house of God the
[49:47] mystical gathering in the house of God
[49:50] which is the Church of the Living God
[49:54] notice what else he says which is almost
[49:57] just it's
[49:59] overwhelming the
[50:01] pillar and
[50:04] ground of the
[50:08] truth so you mean the
[50:12] church is actually what gives the
[50:16] truth it's substrate or substructure
[50:20] under it and the church is what keeps
[50:25] the
[50:26] truce from
[50:32] dying now if we believe the Bible this
[50:35] is what your Bible
[50:36] says let's read it together now which is
[50:39] the Church of the Living God the
[50:43] pillar the pillar and
[50:47] ground of the truth look at this word
[50:51] ground a
[50:52] stay a prop
[50:55] or a
[50:57] support Now does not the truth support
[51:00] us yes but in this
[51:04] sense it is actually the church that
[51:08] supports the
[51:09] truth so if you were the devil what
[51:12] would you want to
[51:14] destroy would not you want to destroy
[51:17] the
[51:18] columns the stay the support of the
[51:22] truth which is what the church
[51:26] oh my which is the pillar and ground of
[51:31] the truth may the Lord bless his word
[51:34] you may be
[51:42] seated so the real true church the
[51:46] Ecclesia of
[51:48] God is the way God looks at this and if
[51:52] you'll look at this word in your Greek
[51:54] Lexicon
[51:55] it will have a Greek name there and then
[51:58] a a number and it will reflect to you
[52:01] that this is also the same
[52:05] antitype of when Solomon built his
[52:08] Temple and Solomon in the front of the
[52:11] structure Solomon had two pillars or two
[52:16] columns and he gave them
[52:20] names and they were a support in the
[52:24] main structure or the body of the house
[52:27] of God now Paul borrows from that and
[52:31] says now what supports the truth and
[52:36] what will keep the truth alive is the
[52:40] Ecclesia of God now not a church
[52:43] building not church membership but
[52:46] actually the elect of God so you can see
[52:51] why then Satan would do everything he
[52:54] could do do to try to stop the Church of
[52:58] the Living God the truth listen
[53:01] carefully so you don't miss understand
[53:03] me the truth is not self
[53:09] supporting the truth is not the
[53:13] foundation for
[53:15] itself the truth is not self
[53:21] propagating so we could take our Bibles
[53:24] our books
[53:25] we could lay them right here on this
[53:28] Pulpit lay it on your chair where you
[53:30] sat lay it on the piano lay it on the
[53:33] altar rail we could leave it there for
[53:36] 500 years for a thousand years and we
[53:40] would never come back and find that the
[53:44] truth had built another pull pit or that
[53:48] the truth had built another altar rail
[53:51] or another piano or that the truce had
[53:55] actually replicated itself and made
[53:58] another
[54:00] Bible because it has to have God
[54:03] orchestrated it this way that it must
[54:06] have human
[54:08] instrumentality to carry that seed word
[54:11] and the seed passes through the body
[54:15] right so it's not then that we can just
[54:18] now handing out tracks is good and
[54:19] handing out books yes absolutely we
[54:22] should do that with all of our heart but
[54:24] your Bible don't have legs on its own
[54:26] and it does not have a mouth on its own
[54:29] our message books do not have books or
[54:32] legs rather on the books they do not
[54:34] have hands on the books to where they
[54:36] can hand theirself out they don't have a
[54:38] mouse on the books to where the books
[54:41] fall into the hands of the people and
[54:43] then the books go to explaining themsel
[54:46] and telling them this is why you need to
[54:48] read me this is why you need to open
[54:52] this up they don't have that ability so
[54:55] so what is the support of the truth the
[54:58] pillar of the truth the Church of the
[55:01] Living God now let me ask you this what
[55:04] was it that came first in the apostolic
[55:07] age the written New Testament or the
[55:13] Ecclesia now if you know history very
[55:15] well you know that one of the very first
[55:18] books they say that was written was the
[55:20] book of First Corinthians which was 59
[55:24] ad
[55:25] the Book of James was written around uh
[55:29] 6059 latter part of 59 to the early part
[55:32] of 60 so you mean from 33 a until we'll
[55:37] say
[55:38] 59 so for all of those years 26 years
[55:44] they did not have a new testament there
[55:47] was no Book of Mark Matthew Mark none of
[55:50] them John uh book of Acts there was none
[55:53] of them so God started the church
[55:57] actually the Ecclesia and then God
[56:00] started having the New Testament written
[56:03] why he needed a big foundation to lay
[56:05] that book on and he needed support why
[56:08] would you build a house in a in a in a
[56:11] mud hole why would you build a house
[56:13] with no support God did not want to
[56:16] build it upon just the Old Testament
[56:19] alone but what is he going to build it
[56:21] on the doctrine and the teaching of the
[56:24] Apostles and the prophets merge together
[56:28] so then what is God going to do God's
[56:30] going to let the book of Acts of course
[56:32] come into action but what did they
[56:35] preach now they preached Jesus and they
[56:38] preached it from an Old Testament
[56:40] perspective but remember many of the New
[56:43] Testament uh preachers for those years
[56:46] did not even have the Book of Matthew
[56:48] Mark Luke and John acts none of those to
[56:51] be able to take their text from so what
[56:54] did they proe preach they preached Jesus
[56:57] they preached healing they preached
[56:58] Miracles and they preached it from the
[57:01] types of the Old Testament and was they
[57:04] doing the work of God absolutely doing
[57:07] the work of God and yet they didn't even
[57:10] have a new testament to be able to stand
[57:12] up say now let's everybody turn to the
[57:14] book of Acts tonight let's everybody
[57:16] turn to the Book of Matthew there was no
[57:19] such a thing and yet God started out his
[57:22] church in that fashion that he would
[57:25] build it upon now not only the doctrine
[57:29] but also the actions of these Apostles
[57:32] so they're not what the world probably
[57:34] would call Great theologians and learned
[57:37] men but they were men that had this
[57:40] testimony and that the world knew them
[57:42] by this identification that they had
[57:45] been with Jesus now they might not have
[57:48] stood there and but able to have all the
[57:49] types I imagine that Peter and them
[57:52] whenever Paul be to write the types of
[57:54] the old Testament and bring it right on
[57:56] to the book of Hebrews that Peter and
[57:58] James and some of those Jewish Brethren
[58:01] they must have thought wow what an
[58:03] understanding this man has we don't have
[58:05] no no history or anything that Peter
[58:07] ever even tied the priesthood of the
[58:10] levitical order to the Lord Jesus he
[58:12] never mentioned it in the sense the way
[58:14] that Paul did now he referred to him as
[58:17] being a priest and said the little
[58:18] things here and there but can you
[58:20] imagine if the Lord Jesus would have
[58:22] chosen Peter to be the the church age
[58:25] messenger of the Ephesian age it would
[58:28] have been so little that God would have
[58:32] had to reveal himself through now we've
[58:35] got great men in this message great men
[58:38] and we've been privileged in our church
[58:40] to be able to have some great Servants
[58:42] of God to be able to stand here and
[58:44] preach the word but as great as those
[58:46] are there's not a one of them that has
[58:49] the capability to become the light the
[58:53] eye which allows the light to come into
[58:58] the embodiment of the horn in order to
[59:01] illuminate the body for its purpose on
[59:04] the earth now brother Tim prud is a
[59:06] great preacher my he's got the
[59:08] identification of being Prince among
[59:11] preachers but I am so glad that brother
[59:14] Tim is not the church A's messenger
[59:16] because we would be so limited and what
[59:18] we know cuz you know what brother Tim
[59:20] gets what he preaches from the messenger
[59:22] himself because brother Tim is like me
[59:25] he's not made to where that his first
[59:28] conscience and his subconscious is the
[59:30] same which makes him where God can
[59:33] project to him infallable Revelations
[59:37] that cannot be
[59:38] questioned now does he get inspiration
[59:41] from God yep just like me and every
[59:43] other minister but you see a prophet is
[59:45] different from that that's why when God
[59:48] anoints the lips of a prophet and they
[59:51] speak thus sayeth the Lord that is
[59:53] totally in
[59:55] infallable well somebody say Amen
[59:58] because that's the way God made them I'm
[1:00:00] not made that way I can have a dream and
[1:00:03] remember part of it and comes and goes
[1:00:05] but a prophet is made to where his
[1:00:07] subconscious and his first conscience
[1:00:09] are so close together that he can his
[1:00:11] eyes can be wide open and he can enter
[1:00:14] into that realm and God can take their
[1:00:16] lips and their mind and speak prophetic
[1:00:18] things for thousands of years down the
[1:00:21] road and that's the way God projects to
[1:00:24] them the infallibility of thus sayeth
[1:00:27] the Lord there ain't nobody else made
[1:00:29] that way so God is going to now build an
[1:00:32] establish and he's going to have a
[1:00:34] church upon this church he will be able
[1:00:37] to reproduce it over and over again he
[1:00:40] knows in the Ephesian Church age they
[1:00:43] will become cold and indifferent and
[1:00:45] they will lose part of that original
[1:00:47] love that they had when they first
[1:00:49] started out now God is going to show
[1:00:52] John that in the types now remember
[1:00:54] remember many of the New Testament
[1:00:56] preachers never even got to read the
[1:00:59] book of Revelation it was completed
[1:01:02] between 95 and 96 ad so some of them
[1:01:07] first century preachers that started
[1:01:09] preaching around 33 ad some of them were
[1:01:12] totally dead gone in the in the sixth
[1:01:14] Dimension with the Lord they never even
[1:01:17] got to hold the New Testament in their
[1:01:19] hands they never knew nothing about
[1:01:21] seven Thunders they never knew nothing
[1:01:24] about seven Church ages and God kept it
[1:01:27] secret until he called John and to the
[1:01:30] aisle of patmas and there he revealed it
[1:01:32] to him so God is going to actually
[1:01:35] backtrack a little bit in the Revelation
[1:01:38] chapter 1 chapter 2 chapter 3 and he's
[1:01:40] going to take John backwards a little
[1:01:42] bit to where the church age started
[1:01:44] because John didn't even know of course
[1:01:46] that there had been a church age none of
[1:01:48] them even mention it Paul never
[1:01:49] mentioned nothing about a church age but
[1:01:51] yet it started around you know a few
[1:01:53] years after Pentecost 20 something years
[1:01:55] after Pentecost but they were already in
[1:01:58] it but they didn't know it so they were
[1:02:00] experiencing the cess of the church age
[1:02:04] but they hadn't actually put a time slot
[1:02:06] that said it's going to start at this
[1:02:08] certain certain year but they knew there
[1:02:10] was a difference in the church somehow
[1:02:13] and then when God called John and he
[1:02:15] allows him to be caught up into the
[1:02:17] presence of God and he goes to showing
[1:02:19] him manifestations part of them would
[1:02:22] coincide with the Book of Daniel part of
[1:02:24] them would coincide with the book of
[1:02:25] Zachariah and he would see things that
[1:02:28] would be very similar and yet he would
[1:02:30] see things that would be altogether new
[1:02:32] now remember a prophet is what God
[1:02:35] chooses to be able to show them things
[1:02:37] that are not actually written in the
[1:02:40] word now I know there's some of the
[1:02:42] message people what me said this way
[1:02:44] they claim they are message people but
[1:02:47] they have a problem was that and they
[1:02:50] they really don't accept brother
[1:02:51] brandham as the same caliber of pro
[1:02:54] Prophet that Paul was they kind of
[1:02:57] believe brother brandham was a guy that
[1:02:59] you know he he could be able to write a
[1:03:01] commentary well I'm going to tell you
[1:03:03] one thing if that's what you believe
[1:03:05] about Malachi 4 you better get a
[1:03:07] revelation quick if you plan on going in
[1:03:09] the Rapture you ain't going to take no
[1:03:11] Rapture by reading some commentary
[1:03:14] William Brandon was not a commentator he
[1:03:17] was a Vindicated prophet of God oh
[1:03:19] brother Donnie people don't like you to
[1:03:21] say that I don't care if they like it or
[1:03:23] not I'm going to say it as long as I've
[1:03:25] got breath and I'm in my right mind I
[1:03:28] ain't ashamed of this message I ain't
[1:03:30] ashamed of this Prophet come on somebody
[1:03:33] it's going to be this message that's
[1:03:35] going to bring us rapturing Faith to get
[1:03:37] us out of this world we're living
[1:03:40] in so God had to bring John to this
[1:03:43] great spot and he shows John the symbols
[1:03:46] of the things that's going to happen now
[1:03:49] let's pick this up here in the samran
[1:03:50] church age and this is in the church age
[1:03:53] book page 156 and every age we have
[1:03:57] exactly the same pattern this is why the
[1:04:00] light comes some through some god-given
[1:04:02] messenger in a certain area then from
[1:04:06] that messenger there spreads the light
[1:04:09] through the ministry of others who have
[1:04:13] been Faithfully taught now listen to the
[1:04:15] pattern that God will call some man
[1:04:18] through an area and then the light of
[1:04:21] God will come through that man it will
[1:04:23] come from him down to the ministry of
[1:04:26] others and then they will begin to
[1:04:28] spread the same light but now notice
[1:04:30] what happens but of course all those who
[1:04:33] go out don't always learn how necessary
[1:04:38] it is to speak only what the messenger
[1:04:42] has spoken now what happens in time is
[1:04:46] that preachers begin to think they know
[1:04:48] so much and they know so much about God
[1:04:51] and they know so much about their Bible
[1:04:54] and they've studied Greek and Hebrew and
[1:04:56] whatever more and they feel like that
[1:04:58] brother Brandon was you know just a
[1:05:00] little bit back woodsy and he was Kian
[1:05:04] and you know brother Brandon wasn't
[1:05:05] educated and he wasn't very smart and
[1:05:08] and all of that and now that they're so
[1:05:10] smart that they know more about it than
[1:05:12] he
[1:05:14] did so they really don't think it
[1:05:16] necessary uh to to run their ideas
[1:05:19] through the message no more that's why
[1:05:22] we get all these wild haired brain ideas
[1:05:25] that preachers stand in a pull pit and
[1:05:27] preach something that a that a coup of
[1:05:28] chicken shouldn't listen to much less
[1:05:32] sheep well
[1:05:35] Hallelujah but now notice they don't
[1:05:37] always learn is it amazing they can
[1:05:40] learn this and learn that and learn
[1:05:42] something else but they don't always
[1:05:44] learn how necessary it is to speak only
[1:05:47] what the messenger has spoken remember
[1:05:49] Paul warned the people to say only what
[1:05:52] he said in 1 Corinthians 14:37 If any
[1:05:55] man think himself to be a prophet or
[1:05:58] spiritual let acknowledge the things
[1:06:00] that I write unto you are the
[1:06:02] Commandments of the Lord now remember
[1:06:05] Paul said things in the New Testament
[1:06:07] that neither Peter James or John nor
[1:06:11] Moses nor Jeremiah nor Zachariah nor
[1:06:14] Hagi nor Malachi nor any of the rest of
[1:06:16] the prophets ever
[1:06:18] said now some of the people around the
[1:06:20] message to death that lived in the first
[1:06:22] century that have treated just like to
[1:06:24] do our Prophet right now well brother
[1:06:26] brandom I'll say Amen to that if you've
[1:06:28] got a scripture for it don't you
[1:06:30] understand a prophet of God catches the
[1:06:33] unwritten
[1:06:34] word oh I know some people don't believe
[1:06:37] it I know some message preachers that
[1:06:39] don't because I've got emails from them
[1:06:43] right
[1:06:44] uhhuh their old hide needs to be exposed
[1:06:47] to now what so he said what came the
[1:06:50] word of God out from you or came it from
[1:06:52] you only that add here or take away
[1:06:57] there soon the message is no longer pure
[1:07:03] well I don't think we need that do you I
[1:07:06] I I don't think we need that well you
[1:07:07] know brother brandham almost said it
[1:07:10] this way and he didn't but man he should
[1:07:13] have and and since he didn't I I we'll
[1:07:16] just go ahead and say
[1:07:22] it
[1:07:25] uhhuh now notice what happens they add
[1:07:28] here take away there soon the message is
[1:07:31] no longer
[1:07:34] pure and what
[1:07:36] happens the Revival dies
[1:07:41] down and then they go to wondering
[1:07:44] what's wrong what's wrong with our
[1:07:47] churches what's wrong oh well well maybe
[1:07:50] maybe we need to update maybe we need to
[1:07:53] modernize
[1:07:54] maybe we need to modernize our music
[1:07:57] maybe we need to bring in uh some
[1:07:59] outside speakers out outside of the
[1:08:02] message and maybe we need to get uh you
[1:08:04] know um five love languages and and we
[1:08:08] need to get these books and add these
[1:08:09] books to our library you know because
[1:08:12] this PhD and this this guy you know
[1:08:14] brother Ram actually never dealt with
[1:08:15] this and dealt with that and that and
[1:08:17] and then everybody needs to start tuning
[1:08:19] in to doc Dr Dobson and and we need to
[1:08:21] get this Theologian and this guy here
[1:08:23] and that guy there and and we know you
[1:08:25] know our churches are needing something
[1:08:27] or needing something and we go to
[1:08:29] looking outside of our ranks we don't
[1:08:31] need to look outside of our ranks what
[1:08:33] we need to do is look and see what we've
[1:08:34] added and what we've left out while we
[1:08:37] have killed our own
[1:08:44] Revival I'm going to go ahead and say it
[1:08:46] tonight we're not going to have no
[1:08:48] Brides Revival by mixing 1906 version of
[1:08:53] Pentecost him with this
[1:08:55] message oh I know it's stirring Folks up
[1:08:58] all everywhere whenever you say that but
[1:09:00] it's a truth why would God lead us
[1:09:03] backwards why would God lead us with a
[1:09:06] message of Malachi 4 and take us back to
[1:09:09] the isusa street emphasis I ain't
[1:09:12] talking Brother D don't you believe in
[1:09:14] Pentecost I do but there are two
[1:09:17] dispensations or or time frames that are
[1:09:20] called by that same name and we've got
[1:09:22] to be more care careful than any
[1:09:24] generation that's ever been on the earth
[1:09:27] cuz if we're not careful we're going to
[1:09:29] hybridize the original with the one
[1:09:32] which came last and will not even
[1:09:35] recognize what the true is because it
[1:09:39] becomes so modeled and so mixed together
[1:09:41] come on church Preach with me tonight do
[1:09:44] we want the original if we want the
[1:09:46] original we've got to go back to the
[1:09:48] original seed word if we want a 1906
[1:09:52] look what it produced what did it
[1:09:54] produce oh my by the time the prophet
[1:09:57] got here there was everything of the
[1:09:59] world imaginable that was going on in
[1:10:01] the restoration of the gift move and
[1:10:03] will you want to go back to that alone I
[1:10:06] don't I want everything God's got for me
[1:10:09] I want everything don't you but I sure
[1:10:12] don't want to go backwards to get it I'm
[1:10:14] pressing on the upward
[1:10:18] way oh
[1:10:21] my notice this how careful we must be to
[1:10:25] hear one voice for the spirit has but
[1:10:29] one
[1:10:30] voice which is the voice of
[1:10:33] God Paul warned them to say what he said
[1:10:38] now you see the tape people want to take
[1:10:39] this quote right here and say uhhuh see
[1:10:42] right there you read it right there
[1:10:44] tonight so all you need to do is listen
[1:10:46] to the tapes I do and whenever I listen
[1:10:50] to him I hear him saying we need men of
[1:10:53] God out there to get behind the pull pit
[1:10:55] and preach the
[1:10:56] word and then I do what he said on the
[1:10:59] tapes and then I get crucified for doing
[1:11:01] what he said on the tapes that they say
[1:11:03] they believe you set on the tapes and I
[1:11:05] say no you don't no you get you a good
[1:11:08] Holy Ghost F Pastor come on somebody
[1:11:11] inste of one you can control by your
[1:11:14] remote you can pick out which tape you
[1:11:16] want you can stop it you can start it
[1:11:19] you can fast forward it if you don't
[1:11:21] want to listen to this one you select
[1:11:22] you another one but a holy ghost filled
[1:11:25] man of God don't come of the remote that
[1:11:28] you fast
[1:11:29] forward or rewind
[1:11:32] him skip that Brother D no he's anointed
[1:11:35] of the Holy Ghost he cuts you he cuts
[1:11:38] himself he cuts the deacons he CS the
[1:11:41] trustees why because he's LED of the
[1:11:44] Holy
[1:11:50] Ghost oh my
[1:11:52] goodness
[1:11:54] praise the Lord Paul warned them to say
[1:11:58] what he said even as Peter did likewise
[1:12:00] he warned that even
[1:12:02] Paul could not change the word that he
[1:12:06] was given by Revelation oh how important
[1:12:09] it is to hear the voice of
[1:12:12] God by way of his Messengers plural and
[1:12:17] then say what has been given to them to
[1:12:21] say to the churches is now we'll go to
[1:12:25] Revelation 5:8 and we'll come to a
[1:12:29] symbol notice chap verse 6 rather I
[1:12:32] beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:12:34] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[1:12:36] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:12:39] had been
[1:12:41] slain having
[1:12:46] seven what seven
[1:12:50] horns and seven eyes
[1:12:54] so here was seven horns on the head of
[1:12:57] the lamb and then in each
[1:13:00] horn was an
[1:13:04] eye now which are the seven spirits of
[1:13:08] God sent forths into all the Earth so
[1:13:12] this is seven not that God has seven
[1:13:14] holy ghosts but seven manifestations of
[1:13:17] the same spirit of God Church age
[1:13:20] dispensations so the horn represented
[1:13:24] the body the church the Ecclesia of God
[1:13:29] the eye is what catches the light now it
[1:13:35] was formerly believed by medical people
[1:13:39] that actually the eye itself caught or
[1:13:44] produced the light that allowed it to
[1:13:47] emit into the back of the brain and as
[1:13:49] you know when it hits it and it's upside
[1:13:51] down then it changes around
[1:13:54] but actually the light itself the eye
[1:13:57] does not produce the light but the eye
[1:14:01] allows the light to be emitted and enter
[1:14:06] into the body now watch here in the
[1:14:10] breach the prophet tells the seven horns
[1:14:12] was the seven churches the seven
[1:14:14] churches because that was the Lamb's
[1:14:18] protection now notice so this horn as
[1:14:22] you would know saying on a cow or a deer
[1:14:24] or whatever more you know the deer you
[1:14:27] brothers that's been out hunting and
[1:14:29] you'll you'll watch them and them deer
[1:14:31] will get into fights and oh my I've seen
[1:14:33] them it's just incredible some of the
[1:14:35] things that they will do but them bucks
[1:14:38] will not stand up there and take their
[1:14:40] paw so much they'll rare up every around
[1:14:42] them but for the most part what they're
[1:14:45] using is their horns and they find them
[1:14:48] all the time to where two bucks will get
[1:14:51] all caught up and inter twine with one
[1:14:54] another and one of those bucks will
[1:14:57] absolutely kill the other one and that
[1:14:59] one will die and their horns are locked
[1:15:03] and they can't get it off so he will
[1:15:05] actually pull that other dead Buck
[1:15:08] around some of you Brothers have seen it
[1:15:10] no doubt and until that carcass is
[1:15:13] rotten or somebody sees it and helps him
[1:15:15] get undone because the horns are their
[1:15:19] protection so God now takes this symbol
[1:15:22] of course Daniel sees the same thing on
[1:15:24] the goat and he uses this as a symbol to
[1:15:27] show that the body is his protection
[1:15:30] this is Christ support work in every age
[1:15:35] now this is how God identifies the bride
[1:15:38] and every age the church as a horn so he
[1:15:42] uses the horn on himself to Ram the
[1:15:48] devil well I'll tell you one thing if
[1:15:50] I'm going to ram him we don't need to be
[1:15:53] made out of marshmallows do we if we are
[1:15:56] a bunch of marshmallow Christians Jesus
[1:15:59] ain't got much protection in this hour
[1:16:02] if we're a bunch of compromising layer
[1:16:04] Deans well we ain't going to preach
[1:16:06] Holiness and we ain't going to say this
[1:16:08] and that and the other brother Donnie
[1:16:09] we've got a new church we got new people
[1:16:11] coming in all the time I told you before
[1:16:14] we ever come here if you thought I was
[1:16:17] going to compromise because we was going
[1:16:19] to stop having visitors you got the
[1:16:21] wrong preacher this may be the very
[1:16:24] thing they're looking for in the first
[1:16:26] place why would you want me to preach
[1:16:28] the same thing they're hearing at their
[1:16:30] church we need to preach the word of God
[1:16:32] for the hour that we are living in this
[1:16:36] is our
[1:16:38] dispensation I am not going back and
[1:16:41] preaching the 1906 version I am not I've
[1:16:44] already preached that years ago and it
[1:16:47] did not satisfy me then and it's SW
[1:16:50] tonight but what do I want I want want
[1:16:53] to hold up the standard of the Lord God
[1:16:56] in the last days under the eagle
[1:16:58] anointing of Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[1:17:02] Revelation 10 1-7 and tell you we are
[1:17:07] the generation that is going to take the
[1:17:09] Rapture it's not another generation I
[1:17:13] don't believe it's a hundred years away
[1:17:16] I believe we are near that
[1:17:22] time remember that last beast power was
[1:17:26] a flying
[1:17:29] eagle not a setting
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:37] one I wonder if had it right but have
[1:17:39] got the salvation of her boys if she'
[1:17:42] have sat there
[1:17:46] and good
[1:17:48] brother but brother random told her you
[1:17:51] said the right thing
[1:17:55] just to think it wouldn't have done
[1:17:58] it notice I love this the seven Church
[1:18:01] ages because that was the Lamb's
[1:18:04] protection don't you see his support
[1:18:07] work his support work on the
[1:18:10] church this is what the lamb protects
[1:18:13] his
[1:18:17] with what he
[1:18:19] protected his rights with on
[1:18:24] Earth my
[1:18:27] Lord boy I'll tell you I don't know
[1:18:29] about you I feel pretty flimsy with
[1:18:31] that I can understand cherubims in
[1:18:34] heaven Zoom
[1:18:37] seraphim and he don't have Angels down
[1:18:40] here no actually he's got something
[1:18:43] better
[1:18:44] right you ready he's got something
[1:18:48] better Sons and Daughters of God
[1:18:51] hallelujah or if you familiar with your
[1:18:54] Prophet saying it he said who has the
[1:18:56] most Authority in heaven an angel or a
[1:18:59] son of God hallelujah he could have
[1:19:03] placed cherubim he placed them down
[1:19:05] there at the Garden Gate but he BR Adam
[1:19:07] and Eve out of the Garden of Eden he
[1:19:09] placed them Angels there and it was to
[1:19:12] protect the way back to the tree of life
[1:19:14] but after man become converted and
[1:19:16] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:19:18] Ghost and receive divine nature in his
[1:19:21] soul then he said cherub take a back
[1:19:23] seat sarap take a backseat I'm going to
[1:19:27] turn myself I am going to lay my head in
[1:19:31] the lap of my bride she will not trim
[1:19:34] off my hair the way Delilah did Samson
[1:19:37] I'm going to put my rights in the lap of
[1:19:40] my sweetheart because I know she will
[1:19:44] protect me with every drop of her blood
[1:19:47] she will lay aside if she has to her
[1:19:50] mama her daddy she will protect take me
[1:19:53] I feel safe I feel secure because I am
[1:19:57] in the arms of my beloved back off devil
[1:20:01] back off because my bride will protect
[1:20:04] me in every age and let me tell you she
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:16] has so the anointing projects from the
[1:20:19] lamb moves up and begin to energize the
[1:20:24] horn and the horn
[1:20:31] goes you're introducing whirling into
[1:20:34] the
[1:20:40] church now with my mouth my horns you
[1:20:43] can't see them but I got a horn up
[1:20:45] here that's what you are a horn men of
[1:20:51] God that's what we are we've got to
[1:20:52] stand for what's right the lamb anoints
[1:20:55] us protect my rights protect my Holiness
[1:20:59] in my people protect my Purity protect
[1:21:03] my
[1:21:04] [Applause]
[1:21:09] message
[1:21:12] hallelujah what he protected his rights
[1:21:14] on Earth was a
[1:21:17] godsent listen to this
[1:21:20] group of people that's
[1:21:24] protected not just preachers not just a
[1:21:27] prophet but a
[1:21:32] group seven eyes of the seven
[1:21:35] messengers of the seven Church ages
[1:21:39] seven eyes seven
[1:21:42] Sears now let's look at it from this
[1:21:44] angle Matthew chapter 6 verse
[1:21:49] 22 the light of the body
[1:21:53] is the
[1:21:55] eye if therefore thine eye be
[1:22:00] single notice this now if thine eye be
[1:22:04] single thy whole body shall be
[1:22:09] full of light I want you to notice now
[1:22:11] Jesus did not say that the eye produces
[1:22:15] the
[1:22:16] light but the eye is a channel by which
[1:22:20] the light can pass through
[1:22:23] white cannot penetrate so much the hand
[1:22:26] the ears the brain the hair but where is
[1:22:29] it here the eyes so the eyes allows the
[1:22:35] Rays of light to be emitted into the
[1:22:38] body now notice how Jesus says it the
[1:22:41] light of the whole body then is the eye
[1:22:45] so the entrance of light you can't eat
[1:22:47] it you can't swallow light you can't
[1:22:50] taste light you can't hear light right
[1:22:54] you can't feel it but you see it you see
[1:22:59] light so then your eyes are you know
[1:23:01] even the great cameras that they have M
[1:23:03] they're constantly making them better
[1:23:05] and better and better with all the
[1:23:06] megapixels and all this and that and the
[1:23:08] other but they said they have never yet
[1:23:10] been able to make a camera that will
[1:23:13] even compare to the human eye and yet
[1:23:16] the ability of all the millions of
[1:23:18] pixels and colors and all that's there
[1:23:21] and Jesus chose this as a spiritual
[1:23:24] symbol let to bring it over now into the
[1:23:27] eyes in the seven horns so here we got
[1:23:29] the eyes so there was a church AE
[1:23:31] messenger and there was a church so here
[1:23:34] was a bent of the church and then there
[1:23:36] was an eye in that horn so the eye would
[1:23:39] catch the Light Of God being emitted for
[1:23:41] the day and then the eye itself was an
[1:23:45] open channel to pass what was emitted
[1:23:47] through the eye down into the body and
[1:23:52] as long as that light stayed there from
[1:23:55] the eye the light that was in the body
[1:23:58] oh it made the body pure and it made the
[1:24:01] body holy now I'm talking about
[1:24:02] spiritual light because that light Paul
[1:24:05] caught that first church age Revelation
[1:24:07] and the light come from God and it went
[1:24:10] back through that prophet and it come
[1:24:12] right down through the body they had
[1:24:14] gifts they had teaching they had
[1:24:16] miraculous they had all the
[1:24:18] word right they just wasn't one-sided
[1:24:21] you know well go to God all we have our
[1:24:23] church is just preaching we don't
[1:24:24] believe in those Supernatural Well
[1:24:26] that's not Apostolic well all we have at
[1:24:28] our church is prayer lines and signs and
[1:24:30] wonders and miracles well that ain't
[1:24:32] Apostolic either but they had all of
[1:24:34] that together why because it was all
[1:24:38] determined by the eye you follow me so
[1:24:40] far so the eye in that age now whether
[1:24:43] it is a flashlight or whether it's the
[1:24:46] brilliant lights away we have up here
[1:24:48] whatever it is the eye itself will be
[1:24:51] able to adapt and you know how it is
[1:24:53] whenever you're in the dark and you're
[1:24:54] trying to find your way around the least
[1:24:57] little bit of light can help you move
[1:24:59] around but you also know how difficult
[1:25:02] it is if you walk out of this building
[1:25:04] tonight and you start out in the
[1:25:06] darkness you can't hardly see where you
[1:25:08] are going because you are walking out of
[1:25:11] great light into darkness and that's
[1:25:13] what happens to people when they walk
[1:25:15] away from this word and they leave this
[1:25:18] brilliant light of the end time and then
[1:25:20] they get out of here walking away from L
[1:25:22] they can't see nothing they get to a
[1:25:24] place they don't know what's right no
[1:25:25] more is this right is this wrong I don't
[1:25:27] know what to do well it ain't no wonder
[1:25:30] it's because they pulled out from under
[1:25:32] the influence of the eye of the
[1:25:36] age Oh Glory notice and so the light of
[1:25:40] the body is the eye Jesus says if
[1:25:44] therefore it is thy I be single or
[1:25:48] focused on one thing now notice what a
[1:25:51] prophet messenger does and I want you to
[1:25:53] see in this symbol that there was not
[1:25:55] five or six eyes on one horn and there
[1:25:58] was no double vision up there either
[1:26:00] there was only one eye per horn now
[1:26:04] watch this this is why myself I am not
[1:26:06] looking for a prophet to come after
[1:26:10] Malachi 4 and say something to the
[1:26:12] Gentiles right amen there ain't no
[1:26:15] Malachi 4 five and a half come on
[1:26:18] somebody I am not looking for somebody
[1:26:21] to come and perform the sign of the
[1:26:24] Messiah that has already been done well
[1:26:28] glory to God I'm not waiting for some
[1:26:31] man around the message to come and
[1:26:33] everybody in the bride is going to
[1:26:34] follow him there is no such promise in
[1:26:37] the word of
[1:26:38] God Amen there was only one eye on there
[1:26:42] and then that eye didn't fall off and a
[1:26:44] new eye come up you're breaking your
[1:26:48] types oh my so the light of the body is
[1:26:53] the eye if therefore thine eye be single
[1:26:57] thy whole body shall be full of light so
[1:27:02] the the the eye is what allows the light
[1:27:06] to come true as I said it comes back and
[1:27:08] Strikes the back of cornea turns it
[1:27:10] upside down switches the image just like
[1:27:12] that instantaneously to where you can be
[1:27:13] able to pick up images then your life
[1:27:16] has the ability and God made it in such
[1:27:18] a wonderful way you those of you that
[1:27:20] have your eyes testing you have to have
[1:27:21] your eyes dilated you know what that is
[1:27:23] of course and whatever they dilate your
[1:27:25] eyes and then whenever you walk out in
[1:27:28] broad daylight with full sun ain't that
[1:27:31] fun I mean your pupil is about the size
[1:27:33] of an Indian head nickel and you're
[1:27:35] walking out I mean you're just about
[1:27:37] blinded why because your eyes are fully
[1:27:40] dilated which is what they're supposed
[1:27:42] to be in the darkness come on now and
[1:27:45] God made your pupil so it would get
[1:27:48] small and big and it would adjust
[1:27:50] according to the amount of light that
[1:27:53] you are dealing with is that right so we
[1:27:55] walk out from this bright building
[1:27:57] tonight the size of our pupils are going
[1:27:59] to be one size we walk straight out that
[1:28:01] door into the darkness they going to be
[1:28:02] another side and we're not going to be
[1:28:04] able to say anything but if we stay out
[1:28:06] there long enough our eyes will begin to
[1:28:09] adjust and we get used to the darkness
[1:28:12] and then we think this is what we're
[1:28:14] supposed to do come on children let's
[1:28:17] not turn away from this light because
[1:28:19] it's possible for you to walk away from
[1:28:21] the light and you stay in a compromised
[1:28:24] situation or a darkness of the world and
[1:28:27] before long your eyes will become so
[1:28:29] adjusted you'll think well this is
[1:28:32] normal I guess this is what we're
[1:28:33] supposed to
[1:28:36] do oh
[1:28:38] my you see light is admitted listen
[1:28:44] admitted through the
[1:28:48] eye and then it
[1:28:51] illuminates so Jesus then in this next
[1:28:55] verse he says that if your eye is single
[1:28:59] then the whole body is full of light but
[1:29:02] then he says if a person had an evil eye
[1:29:06] which that word there is also
[1:29:10] diseased you see this is what's happened
[1:29:13] to every
[1:29:15] age that people replace the eye of the
[1:29:19] messenger that God put on the horn
[1:29:23] and then they get a man most always a
[1:29:28] man with a diseased
[1:29:31] vision and then they put him in that
[1:29:36] godall
[1:29:39] position but the problem is God
[1:29:43] didn't God don't change his eyes he
[1:29:46] changes his
[1:29:48] ages now can you imagine as I said
[1:29:50] earlier replace in Paul with Peter so
[1:29:54] now let's take the eye out we're going
[1:29:56] to take it out Serge we're going to
[1:29:57] remove it we're going to lay Paul the
[1:29:58] prophet over here and we're going to put
[1:30:00] Peter
[1:30:02] in now Peter was a great man L
[1:30:08] God but that man could not hold Paul a
[1:30:11] light that's right in understanding in
[1:30:14] Revelation in
[1:30:18] Mysteries you can go ahead and say Amen
[1:30:21] right
[1:30:22] well let's look James let's take Paul
[1:30:25] out and we'll put James
[1:30:27] in James hardly ever left
[1:30:30] Jerusalem James was still very
[1:30:33] Jewish yeah James never did really see
[1:30:38] the purging of the Gentiles and the
[1:30:41] merging in show me where James ever
[1:30:44] caught the revelation of the Jews in the
[1:30:46] first century and the merging together
[1:30:48] of the Gentiles to be one body we
[1:30:50] wouldn't even have that scripture if
[1:30:52] Paul hadn't wrote
[1:30:54] it so you see God chose the man that he
[1:30:57] wanted to be the eye and then God makes
[1:31:01] that man and gifts that man was what he
[1:31:03] needs for the age now God knew he did
[1:31:06] not need to put Paul down there in the
[1:31:09] Luther age but where he needed it was at
[1:31:11] the beginning if God would have started
[1:31:13] out with Luther at the beginning then in
[1:31:16] the restoration the last days would have
[1:31:18] to be restored to be all Lutheran cuz
[1:31:21] what whatever he started out with is
[1:31:23] what he's going to end up with now if
[1:31:25] God wanted it to be the 1906 version of
[1:31:29] Pentecost then God should have used that
[1:31:32] instead of the acts two version brother
[1:31:34] Melvin is that right so then we could
[1:31:37] come back and say praise God we're going
[1:31:40] back to isusa Street glory to God we're
[1:31:42] going back to isusa Street amen the Lord
[1:31:45] is restoring us back but that was not
[1:31:48] what he used first what he used first
[1:31:51] was the anointing in of the lion and had
[1:31:54] Paul to speak out and begin to bring
[1:31:57] great Revelations which had never been
[1:32:00] uttered since the foundation of the
[1:32:03] world and whenever he be to preach and
[1:32:06] God opened his understanding it was not
[1:32:09] for him just personally but the
[1:32:12] illumination was coming and shining
[1:32:14] through that eye listen friends it's
[1:32:17] still shining today it's still ongoing
[1:32:20] when you and I read his writing ing by
[1:32:22] the spirit of God you understand what
[1:32:23] I'm saying we're still seeing things
[1:32:25] that this man wrote that's how profound
[1:32:28] that it
[1:32:29] is but notice this Jesus when he says
[1:32:32] this the light of the body is the eye if
[1:32:35] therefore thine eye be single now the
[1:32:39] word here single is devoted to one
[1:32:44] object that's not tunnel vision and it's
[1:32:47] not confusion so you're not looking at
[1:32:50] this and well we got society and you
[1:32:52] know we've got to worry about pleasing
[1:32:54] these people and we've got to do that
[1:32:55] but your eye is single it's on one goal
[1:33:00] and that one goal the most important
[1:33:02] goal of course is pleasing the
[1:33:05] Lord then work family job occupation you
[1:33:10] know all that sort of thing everything
[1:33:12] else comes after that single Vision
[1:33:15] remember those eyes were not doubles
[1:33:18] they were not triplets they were not
[1:33:20] quadruplets there was
[1:33:22] one
[1:33:24] one and that I would be so single on the
[1:33:28] purpose of God can you imagine if God
[1:33:30] would have sent brother brandom in the
[1:33:32] days of Martin
[1:33:33] Luther and he would have walked up on
[1:33:35] that that day whittenberg Germany and
[1:33:39] wrote that 95 thesis I'm not sure
[1:33:42] brother brandom could even spell the
[1:33:43] word thesis I'm not making fun of him
[1:33:46] now God allowed him to be that way for
[1:33:50] this day to confound the smart and
[1:33:54] mainly the smart elic that's
[1:33:58] right you've seen some of his notes back
[1:34:01] in the library right if you haven't you
[1:34:03] need to look at them they're trading
[1:34:04] them out every now and then so you can
[1:34:06] see them the man couldn't even spell
[1:34:08] words properly that's right some of our
[1:34:11] brothers from South Africa were here a
[1:34:13] few months ago and first time they'd
[1:34:15] ever seen many of those things and they
[1:34:17] were just taking pictures and they were
[1:34:19] just in awe at brother brand notes and
[1:34:22] how that he wrote and many of our our
[1:34:25] our school kids would be able to spell
[1:34:28] better than he did and he's saying why
[1:34:31] in the world can you imagine how those
[1:34:32] Ed educated theologians sitting behind
[1:34:35] brother Brandon when he's preaching all
[1:34:36] those great things and if they would
[1:34:37] have saw his notes and said you got to
[1:34:39] be kidding me you got to be kidding me
[1:34:41] this is Elijah this is look look this
[1:34:44] man spelling why don't have his nouns
[1:34:46] and his pronouns right and he don't have
[1:34:49] this right and that right that's exactly
[1:34:51] what God wanted to confound this age God
[1:34:54] could have chose a theologian had he
[1:34:56] wanted to God could have chose another
[1:34:58] Paul if he wanted to a man that spoke
[1:35:01] several languages a man that had a great
[1:35:03] intellect but God said no I don't think
[1:35:06] so I don't think I'll call him from
[1:35:08] California where Newsome's going to come
[1:35:10] from I don't think I'm going to call him
[1:35:12] from Washington DC I don't think I'll
[1:35:15] call him from the mighty Mississippi I
[1:35:17] think I'll call him from down the middle
[1:35:19] of Kentucky I think I'll get him down
[1:35:21] there and nobody will know his name his
[1:35:23] mom and his daddy will be nobody's his
[1:35:26] grandparents will be nobody and I will
[1:35:28] call him I will raise him up I will give
[1:35:31] him a Ministry that he will pray for
[1:35:33] monarchs and kings and potentates come
[1:35:36] on
[1:35:38] somebody why because God chooses the eye
[1:35:42] we
[1:35:44] [Applause]
[1:35:47] don't you see the eye is
[1:35:50] single so it's not a
[1:35:54] denomination so now denomination I mean
[1:35:57] you'd have several rows of eyes on that
[1:35:58] one horn you know the big eyes of course
[1:36:01] and the little you that'd be eyes all
[1:36:02] over that thing I mean there' be the
[1:36:04] head guy and the second guy and the
[1:36:05] third guy and the fourth guy and the
[1:36:07] fifth guy there be eyes everywhere all
[1:36:08] around that thing I'll tell you one
[1:36:10] thing brotherr we had this meeting and
[1:36:11] we've decided that Donnie Reagan and
[1:36:14] them guys that preaching and holding s
[1:36:16] we're kicking them out of that church
[1:36:17] good luck with that pal we ain't got no
[1:36:20] board here over us that tells us you
[1:36:23] can't preach Holiness and you can't
[1:36:25] preach this and you can't preach that
[1:36:27] come on children but what did God say I
[1:36:29] want one eye and through that one eye I
[1:36:33] will project my light the light will
[1:36:35] flow through him down through the entire
[1:36:37] body and the body will become Anointed
[1:36:40] with the same Spirit he's under praise
[1:36:43] God and that will be the message of the
[1:36:46] hour and I will use them to ram my way
[1:36:50] through Darkness
[1:36:51] I will use them and I will push and push
[1:36:55] and push through Catholicism I'll push
[1:36:58] through presbyterianism I'll push
[1:37:00] through Church of God ISM I will push
[1:37:03] until I push my bride right into the
[1:37:06] gates of paradise I will protect myself
[1:37:11] with my
[1:37:12] [Applause]
[1:37:18] body you see the eyes
[1:37:22] designates also
[1:37:24] clearness of
[1:37:26] perception
[1:37:28] clearness of
[1:37:31] perception several years ago I had a
[1:37:35] lasc surgey many you know what that is
[1:37:37] had a stigmatism in both of my
[1:37:40] eyes and uh tried to wear glasses first
[1:37:44] you can imagine me with
[1:37:45] glasses I just never could find a pair
[1:37:47] with windshield wipers cuz I sweated so
[1:37:49] much I just fog up could see where I was
[1:37:51] coming or going then I went to
[1:37:55] contacts and I look I'd come off you on
[1:37:58] a big drunk every time i' preach because
[1:38:00] I'd sweat so much sweat get behind my
[1:38:01] eyes so somebody told me about that
[1:38:03] lasic thing I thought well I'm going to
[1:38:05] go check it out so I went and got that
[1:38:08] done I was making two trips to China and
[1:38:11] they wanted to do one before and one
[1:38:12] after so I laid down on that thing and
[1:38:14] they sta me down some of you've had it
[1:38:17] Carol was standing outside there and in
[1:38:19] a room where she could see and had a
[1:38:20] monitor
[1:38:21] and they strapped your head down they
[1:38:23] pour drops in there and then they got
[1:38:24] this machine that goes like that and
[1:38:28] what they just did was they cut my
[1:38:30] cornea just like that my head can't move
[1:38:33] now I'm wide
[1:38:35] awake and then they take a laser beam
[1:38:39] and they go to reshaping my cornea with
[1:38:43] a
[1:38:44] laser now I don't see it but I smell
[1:38:50] something
[1:38:52] it was my cornea being burned and
[1:38:57] reshaped by laser which is a form of
[1:39:00] light so if ever now and then when
[1:39:03] you're in our church and you go to
[1:39:05] smelling a funny smell it could be your
[1:39:08] hide being
[1:39:10] reshaped by the by the light of God's
[1:39:14] word
[1:39:17] hallelujah now I I just found that so
[1:39:21] amazing and I I lay there and then they
[1:39:22] come back and they take a little thing
[1:39:24] and you know put this back over and your
[1:39:26] eye is the fastest healing part of your
[1:39:28] body I if you knew that or not but it
[1:39:29] heals where they cut that in a matter of
[1:39:32] seconds and then they let me get up well
[1:39:35] before I get up there's a clock right on
[1:39:37] the wall and whenever I laid down on
[1:39:40] that that was the last thing that I saw
[1:39:42] before they start doing all this stuff
[1:39:43] to me and I couldn't even read the clock
[1:39:47] but as soon as they done that and they
[1:39:49] put that flat back over and they
[1:39:51] reshaped it and all that and I looked
[1:39:53] and I'm laying flat on my back and it's
[1:39:55] loed here in front of me and
[1:39:58] immediately I could tell what time it
[1:40:00] was oh
[1:40:04] yeah I could tell what time it was I
[1:40:08] could tell what age I was living I could
[1:40:11] tell by the signs of the time I could
[1:40:15] look and see now I laid there before and
[1:40:17] I could not see it but they glory to God
[1:40:21] glory to God they reshape the way the
[1:40:24] light struck my cornea and allow it to
[1:40:27] hit the same eyeball and what I could
[1:40:30] not make out before I could make out in
[1:40:33] a few minutes after so you see it's the
[1:40:35] same way when we get under the anointing
[1:40:38] of the eye of the age that oh I don't
[1:40:42] understand that I can't say that I can't
[1:40:43] say that and you're just sting there
[1:40:45] saying glory to God I see it glory to
[1:40:48] God I see it and your mom and daddy is
[1:40:51] saying Lord have mercy they're in a cult
[1:40:53] watch them don't drink none of that red
[1:40:55] Kool-Aid I'm noticing he's been drinking
[1:40:57] them colored drinks watch it oh my well
[1:40:59] I'm the only one that drinks if it's
[1:41:01] going to kill anybody it's going to be
[1:41:02] me not you so what happens the spirit of
[1:41:05] God goes to reshaping and then what we
[1:41:08] thought was three gods and then the
[1:41:10] light
[1:41:14] goes and we say glory to God glory to
[1:41:18] God it ain't like this at all it's true
[1:41:21] like that oh my I can see the time I can
[1:41:25] see the age I can see the hour We're
[1:41:28] living and others saying what what I
[1:41:30] don't I don't see anything oh it's just
[1:41:32] like it's been said for thousands of
[1:41:34] years where is the sign of his coming
[1:41:36] where is the sign and you're saying you
[1:41:38] got to be kidding me it's all around us
[1:41:40] everywhere well they got denominational
[1:41:43] stigmatism they got denominational
[1:41:45] blindness and they tore out the light of
[1:41:48] the age and they stuck some preacher up
[1:41:50] on the ch said now I'll tell you one
[1:41:53] thing we don't need to be all excited
[1:42:00] now after all we're having the lighting
[1:42:02] of the Christmas tree in the church on
[1:42:06] Sunday and we're passing out gifts
[1:42:08] everybody will get a carton of
[1:42:09] cigarettes and what wine is your
[1:42:12] favorite wine that you love to
[1:42:17] drink don't sit there and look at me
[1:42:19] funny some of y'all used to drinking
[1:42:23] smoke and bear running out of your mouth
[1:42:27] now you got slobber running out of your
[1:42:28] mouth where you're eating on this good
[1:42:34] Clover you see this is why people look
[1:42:36] at the same thing you look at they say I
[1:42:38] just don't see it I just don't see
[1:42:44] it now they corrected my eyes this
[1:42:48] way this one is 2020
[1:42:52] this one is
[1:42:55] 2025 that so they did that on purpose
[1:42:59] that's so whenever I read a book or I
[1:43:01] read small writing my eyes can be able
[1:43:05] to adjust when I sit down with my laptop
[1:43:07] in my lap my brain switches on my eyes
[1:43:11] and I will sit there for several hours
[1:43:13] at a time and I'll read and then when I
[1:43:15] get up it takes me a little bit from my
[1:43:19] eyes to adjust and the Domin eye to come
[1:43:21] back in to the preeminent part Ronald
[1:43:24] Reagan had that surgery done as well now
[1:43:27] then whenever I'm there my brain
[1:43:29] switches between it and then I can see
[1:43:31] five but when I sit back down again to
[1:43:33] be able to read my laptop it takes my
[1:43:36] brain or my head the control tower to be
[1:43:40] able to adjust my vision to where I can
[1:43:43] see where I need to go aren't you glad
[1:43:45] you got a control tower in your soul
[1:43:48] that helps you sometimes you're looking
[1:43:50] out there you just don't understand
[1:43:51] what's going on anybody ever get there
[1:43:54] you don't know what in the world's going
[1:43:55] on you don't know what you just done you
[1:43:57] don't know what's so and so done and you
[1:43:59] don't know what to do but give your head
[1:44:01] Christ Jesus a little bit of time there
[1:44:03] and he'll adjust your vision where you
[1:44:05] can tell what's going on by that I don't
[1:44:08] have to have readers so I can still read
[1:44:10] tiny writing on the side of this bottle
[1:44:12] which is really good because sometimes
[1:44:14] the mystery of God is hid in tiny
[1:44:17] letters oh yeah so if you've got to have
[1:44:20] a 24 you know I'm tell you one thing
[1:44:22] you're going to completely Overlook what
[1:44:24] God is doing in this hour so God didn't
[1:44:27] send us double vision God didn't send us
[1:44:30] a man with quadruple Vision but he sent
[1:44:32] us a man Whose desire was that people
[1:44:35] would fall in love with the Lord Jesus
[1:44:37] his one desire that he might establish a
[1:44:40] relationship between God and man did
[1:44:43] brother brandom ever build a bridge
[1:44:45] after him did he build a church oh my
[1:44:48] and all of us say we are now the brand
[1:44:51] denomination was there a building a
[1:44:53] college a school a graduation place
[1:44:56] where we send all of our kids to what
[1:44:58] did he leave us a desire that we would
[1:45:02] be like Jesus Christ that he could oh
[1:45:05] what a a great thing it would be if the
[1:45:08] prophet of God were able to visit around
[1:45:10] the world and see the churches that are
[1:45:13] still under the anointing of the eye of
[1:45:16] Malachi 4 and see them doing the same
[1:45:20] work that was done in the book of
[1:45:25] Acts
[1:45:27] but what people want to do is reach up
[1:45:30] here take that eye
[1:45:36] out and put a pastor's eye
[1:45:43] in and I'll tell you one thing
[1:45:46] Brethren I think these prayer lines are
[1:45:49] Pentecostal
[1:45:55] these people screaming and hollering and
[1:45:57] shouting Lord have
[1:46:01] mercy God ain't deaf and he ain't
[1:46:04] nervous
[1:46:07] either do you honestly
[1:46:10] believe my little darling daughter that
[1:46:14] steep beyond the curtain of
[1:46:16] time has found her a chair and been set
[1:46:20] there for the last eight
[1:46:24] weeks just looking
[1:46:26] around how
[1:46:28] y'all Ain this
[1:46:31] wonderful I'm wondering if she's even
[1:46:33] slowed down or
[1:46:34] not praise God scream and holler our
[1:46:39] precious brother you imagine all the
[1:46:41] saints she's already met praise be to
[1:46:46] God but whenever people listen it's not
[1:46:49] always a denomination system and the
[1:46:51] message but it's the same spirit and
[1:46:53] people are scared to death of a
[1:46:55] multitude of men you don't take a
[1:46:57] multitude of men to warp your vision all
[1:47:00] it takes is one that's right and that
[1:47:03] one does an eye
[1:47:06] surgery and it goes in there and it cuts
[1:47:08] out now brother Ram said this but I you
[1:47:10] know I mean that that was in the 50s and
[1:47:12] the 60s you know I mean we we could
[1:47:14] really can't apply that in this day how
[1:47:17] you going to apply what Isaiah said 2200
[1:47:19] years before the 50s and the
[1:47:23] 60s so they take that eye
[1:47:26] out now they lay over here in they
[1:47:28] research they still keep it in their
[1:47:29] study but they just don't preach it no
[1:47:31] more you said Brother D why do you keep
[1:47:33] saying that because you'd be surprised
[1:47:35] at how much is going on in our
[1:47:41] ranks then they put what a pastor's
[1:47:46] eye can you imagine replacing brother
[1:47:49] brandom
[1:47:51] with Donnie
[1:47:52] Reagan that's
[1:47:57] frightening hey I'll have
[1:47:59] illumination but it's about like a match
[1:48:03] compared to the
[1:48:05] Sun a pastor compared to a prophet I got
[1:48:08] the ability to see what he
[1:48:11] saw oh brother Donnie don't that bother
[1:48:13] you not in the least I found my place
[1:48:17] I'm going a brighten my corner where I
[1:48:19] am
[1:48:20] I ain't called to be no major prophet I
[1:48:23] ain't called to do what that Prophet
[1:48:25] done I'm called to do what I'm called to
[1:48:27] do and that's say what he said and do
[1:48:31] what the Lord Jesus called us to do and
[1:48:33] what is that protect his
[1:48:36] [Applause]
[1:48:42] rights oh
[1:48:44] my can you imagine a man crossing a
[1:48:49] stream
[1:48:51] on a
[1:48:52] log the only way that man will ever be
[1:48:55] able to get a Crosset or a
[1:48:57] woman is to focus on
[1:49:00] something on the other
[1:49:03] side if they start looking at that log
[1:49:06] and their steps and what's around them
[1:49:09] it's amazing what the mind will
[1:49:12] do you ever notice things we have
[1:49:14] committed to our subconscious your heart
[1:49:17] rate submitted to your subconscious your
[1:49:19] blood pressure to your subconscious your
[1:49:21] dream cycles that you go through your
[1:49:24] subconscious the steps in your home
[1:49:27] going up and down your garage to your
[1:49:28] back porch whatever you ever notice how
[1:49:30] that is you could just well just go
[1:49:33] right down them unless you start looking
[1:49:36] at them if You' done that brother Rob I
[1:49:38] see you smiling at your wife
[1:49:39] there so then whenever you start looking
[1:49:42] at it is't it amazing that you will
[1:49:45] almost stumble if you
[1:49:47] don't and you say what happened because
[1:49:49] you you pulled it from the subconscious
[1:49:52] and you started concerning yourself
[1:49:54] about it in the first conscience you see
[1:49:57] if we could do that with our faith oh
[1:49:59] Lord we struggle so much and we try to
[1:50:02] make our flesh believe you might as well
[1:50:04] give up on it it ain't never going to
[1:50:06] believe right it'll believe sometimes
[1:50:08] and sometimes it won't the prophet said
[1:50:11] the Lord Jesus was totally unconscious
[1:50:14] of his facei and he talked about living
[1:50:16] in that realm he said now I'm talking
[1:50:19] about bride people that live a walk with
[1:50:23] god with oh I'm going to try to live
[1:50:25] right today I'm going to try to do right
[1:50:26] don't do that friends committed to your
[1:50:29] soul let your soul be United together
[1:50:32] with a man in the engine room and you
[1:50:34] will do more for God than you ever
[1:50:36] dreamed possible in your entire life
[1:50:39] then try to sit around and figure it out
[1:50:41] oh we've got to bring Revival tell me
[1:50:42] how to do it oh brother Don the bride
[1:50:45] needs Revival we've got to have Revival
[1:50:47] we've all got to this and another show
[1:50:48] me where a Revival was ever produced by
[1:50:51] such stuff the prophet of God told us
[1:50:54] how Revival comes it's when the spirit
[1:50:56] of God sends Revival we've had all kinds
[1:50:58] of moves and you know what was behind
[1:51:00] every one of them an eye that replaced a
[1:51:03] prophet look at the seventh under move
[1:51:06] what
[1:51:08] happened was no longer the absolute
[1:51:11] authority of a
[1:51:12] prophet but it was a so-called
[1:51:15] Apostle who was sent to bring clarity
[1:51:20] to the
[1:51:21] message
[1:51:25] uhhuh then put Clarity up there I don't
[1:51:29] want Clarity what they call Clarity I
[1:51:31] want
[1:51:33] charity look at every move that's been
[1:51:36] around this message what
[1:51:38] happened they cut that Prophet out and
[1:51:42] then sck some preacher in there right
[1:51:45] and it can be individual churches just
[1:51:47] one church one preacher and he's got
[1:51:50] this thing about him that he feels like
[1:51:52] he knows so much about
[1:51:57] God we were so ignorant we didn't even
[1:52:00] know how to come to God right well I
[1:52:02] don't care if you say Amen or not I'm
[1:52:04] going to tell you the truth but most of
[1:52:05] us were so ignorant we didn't know how
[1:52:08] to be baptized we didn't know if there's
[1:52:10] an eternal hell we didn't know if
[1:52:12] there's one in the godhead two in the
[1:52:13] godhead come on children we didn't
[1:52:15] hardly know nothing about God right
[1:52:17] brother Charlie Cox used to say before I
[1:52:19] met the prophet of God I didn't even
[1:52:21] know how to cross a fence
[1:52:23] right and by that what he meant was when
[1:52:25] they' go hunting and they'd go hunting
[1:52:27] another people's property they'd go
[1:52:29] right in the middle of the fence and
[1:52:30] just push the fence right down and ride
[1:52:32] it
[1:52:34] down but they hunting with the prophet a
[1:52:36] little bit and he told them said boys
[1:52:37] don't do that again these people's been
[1:52:40] good to you to let you hunt on their
[1:52:41] Farms you ought to treat their fence
[1:52:43] right go up out to that post and step
[1:52:45] across that fence or pull them two wires
[1:52:47] apart and go through the don't don't
[1:52:49] tear up their property we didn't even
[1:52:51] know then understand a lot of that stuff
[1:52:53] we didn't think it matter did it but you
[1:52:55] see an I saw
[1:53:00] a the ey said now you sisters don't cut
[1:53:03] that hair and you Brothers you cut yours
[1:53:08] now you sisters act like women don't put
[1:53:11] on cover hey I I tell my husband what to
[1:53:15] do and yes dear Yes dear
[1:53:22] but what happens I
[1:53:25] surgery I surgery and they say well you
[1:53:29] know we just we're just not sure we need
[1:53:32] no more well we know brother Ram taught
[1:53:33] that really you know prophecy was always
[1:53:36] um always something direct to somebody
[1:53:39] and uh
[1:53:40] actually that God wouldn't repeat
[1:53:42] scriptures and prophecy but but that
[1:53:44] ain't the way we believe it at our
[1:53:45] church at our church we believe that the
[1:53:47] spirit of God can move and speaking in
[1:53:49] tongues say and somebody just yeah said
[1:53:51] the Lord I'm the Lord I'm here and I'm
[1:53:53] I'm fixing to do this and I'm coming
[1:53:55] soon I'm coming
[1:53:59] soon so what did they
[1:54:01] do cut the ey's interpretation how cuz
[1:54:04] the ey said if the preacher stands up
[1:54:07] there and say Jesus is coming soon he's
[1:54:09] coming soon he's coming soon he's called
[1:54:10] to say that but that ain't prophecy
[1:54:13] that's
[1:54:17] right y'all a had I surching now have
[1:54:22] you why is it friends why is it you know
[1:54:25] what it is men so hungry for a move of
[1:54:29] God and if we're not careful we'll let
[1:54:33] this go and that go and that go and oh
[1:54:36] but we're so blessed Oh My My My we're
[1:54:38] so
[1:54:39] blessed sure look in the church age book
[1:54:43] and you'll find that the prophet tells
[1:54:45] us people leave the word they just leave
[1:54:49] the word and they go r on and say hey we
[1:54:51] get results don't we we get results Bo
[1:54:54] God blesses us I'll tell you one thing
[1:54:56] God's doing this that another sure he
[1:54:59] is and he'll try you by that too to see
[1:55:03] will you stay with the word even when
[1:55:06] you overstep it wow there wasn't hardly
[1:55:08] a preacher in the land that could say it
[1:55:09] any more than brother balum boy brother
[1:55:12] B got say glory to God I feeling all
[1:55:14] over hallelujah oh I seen a I'm man
[1:55:17] alive I'm telling you what
[1:55:20] and stepped right over God's original
[1:55:23] word did God stop blessing why no he
[1:55:27] prophesied some of the greatest
[1:55:28] prophecies that's ever been written read
[1:55:30] numbers 24 he prophesied about the
[1:55:32] coming of the Lord Jesus and the man was
[1:55:34] totally out of the will of God right
[1:55:38] why he's a prophet with a double
[1:55:41] vision got one eye on God another is on
[1:55:48] baac
[1:55:50] he's thinking about SSI Medicare
[1:55:52] Medicaid part A Part B part C Part D
[1:55:54] part G part X part Y part Z wow man if I

[1:56:20] his pattern and then God tells you go
[1:56:24] ahead I bless you and you
[1:56:29] say do you

[1:56:35] did you just literally killed
[1:56:44] yourself and God will bless you and
[1:56:46] bless you and bless you more which
[1:56:49] convinces you more and more and more
[1:56:51] you're right right
[1:56:53] right even though your foundation was
[1:56:56] wrong wrong
[1:57:00] wrong is that what we want for our
[1:57:02] church
[1:57:04] friends some of the folks in our message
[1:57:07] have been that way for years more
[1:57:09] heading in that direction now oh we're
[1:57:12] good why we know brother said that's
[1:57:14] just that's just that's just Baptist and
[1:57:16] you can't really pay no attention to
[1:57:18] poor brother Donnie I'll tell you why
[1:57:19] brother Donnie brother Donnie was in the
[1:57:21] Pentecostal move and what what it's
[1:57:22] really done it's it's really scarred
[1:57:24] brother Donnie and that's made him where
[1:57:26] he's just he's just really scarred so
[1:57:28] bad that that he don't want to move a
[1:57:29] God you're a liar right there ain't a
[1:57:33] man on the earth that wants to move of
[1:57:34] God any more than brother Donnie but
[1:57:36] brother Donnie wants a move of
[1:57:38] God a move of God which will be based on
[1:57:42] God's
[1:57:43] word how can I protect the Lamb of God
[1:57:46] in this day with the anointing of
[1:57:49] another other day I've got to have the
[1:57:51] anointing of this hour to protect the
[1:57:53] Lamb of
[1:57:55] [Applause]
[1:58:03] God oh
[1:58:06] my can you imagine what it is when the
[1:58:09] light of God is coming down through the
[1:58:13] eye passing into the body the whole body
[1:58:16] is moving with the light of God
[1:58:20] notice now verse 23 I'll let you rest
[1:58:23] yourself while we close with this but if
[1:58:26] thine eye be evil or diseased so it's
[1:58:30] got something wrong with it that it
[1:58:32] cannot see thy whole
[1:58:36] body shall be full of
[1:58:39] Darkness so look at every manm made move
[1:58:42] down through
[1:58:43] time look at Wesley's day what a great
[1:58:46] day it was but then watch them after
[1:58:50] Wesley left how they begin to change
[1:58:53] look at the Methodist church today so
[1:58:55] when they formed the
[1:58:57] organization did God's spirit leave them
[1:59:00] and their churches crashed and they
[1:59:02] never had nobody else they grew bigger
[1:59:06] after they formed the organization than
[1:59:08] they were before they ever had
[1:59:10] it and they were convinced Bo God is
[1:59:13] blessing us I'm telling you why I mean
[1:59:16] we're busting out the seams well I just
[1:59:18] don't know why we're going to do we're
[1:59:20] getting so big and oh man a liot this
[1:59:23] definitely was the right
[1:59:24] move well let's look back in
[1:59:28] retrospect was
[1:59:32] it so now they're so divided they got
[1:59:35] gay pastors women preachers yeah one of
[1:59:39] the filthiest churches in the
[1:59:41] denominational
[1:59:43] move why they no longer held on to the
[1:59:47] influence of the eye that's
[1:59:50] right what if the Lord carries another
[1:59:53] 10 15 20
[1:59:56] years what will be said about our
[2:00:03] move what will be said about our church
[2:00:07] Our lives our
[2:00:10] families well I know what's going to be
[2:00:12] said about me if I'm alive then I'm
[2:00:16] still faithful I'm still preaching the
[2:00:18] same thing of course then it be so old
[2:00:19] y'all just have pity on me let me preach
[2:00:21] every now just because you feel sorry
[2:00:22] for me I guess I ain't going
[2:00:26] nowhere I ain't moving from behind this
[2:00:29] eye I feel real safe
[2:00:32] there that's why I study it I listen to
[2:00:35] it I preach it I love it maybe some of
[2:00:38] you are getting tired of the message I
[2:00:39] don't know maybe you're getting tired of
[2:00:41] hearing a preach apparently some folks
[2:00:42] are because they quit coming apparently
[2:00:44] some folks around the message are
[2:00:45] getting tired of it because they're
[2:00:46] going over to these charismatic churches
[2:00:48] and going over over here and going over
[2:00:49] there and they out there shopping a
[2:00:51] little bit looking for something else
[2:00:53] well I've done I've done found what I
[2:00:55] was shopping for many many years ago I
[2:00:57] ain't looking for another eye eyeball
[2:00:59] eyelid eyelash or makeup to put on this
[2:01:02] eye I'm perfectly satisfied with the eye
[2:01:05] that God chose himself I don't figure I
[2:01:07] need to help God out and put another eye
[2:01:09] in the Malachi Force Place how many
[2:01:11] understand what I'm saying and I do not
[2:01:13] feel like it let me make sure you
[2:01:15] understand tonight I nor no other Pastor
[2:01:18] is qualified to add to what God's
[2:01:21] Prophet
[2:01:31] said as a matter of fact we'll get to it
[2:01:34] the prophet said three times in the
[2:01:37] Bible it was an unpardonable
[2:01:41] sin to add one word of your own
[2:01:44] interpretation to a message after been
[2:01:47] Vindicated to be the truth
[2:01:50] I don't think preachers realize what
[2:01:51] they're
[2:01:52] doing they're watering changing
[2:01:55] misplacing
[2:01:57] dislocating do you understand what
[2:01:59] you're doing do people understand what
[2:02:01] they're doing three times in the Bible
[2:02:03] an unpardonable
[2:02:07] sin not to leave out a book not to leave
[2:02:10] out a year but to add one word of your
[2:02:13] own interpretation to a message after
[2:02:16] been
[2:02:17] Vindicated to be the truth
[2:02:20] God help
[2:02:23] us God help
[2:02:26] us children if we will stay under the
[2:02:29] influence of our eye all the light we
[2:02:35] need even for the Rapture has been
[2:02:39] emitted down into this
[2:02:42] word if this goes on 200 years message
[2:02:46] preachers will still be preaching things
[2:02:47] out of this message that we probably
[2:02:49] ain't never even preached before and
[2:02:51] it's been laying here the whole time
[2:02:52] right in the
[2:02:53] message everything we have need of is
[2:02:56] right here that's right we don't need to
[2:02:58] go outside of our ranks and get another
[2:03:00] eye and change this and what about this
[2:03:02] guy what about that guy look at those
[2:03:04] who's went that
[2:03:06] way is that what you want for your end
[2:03:09] that ain't what I want for
[2:03:11] M I want to stay right in the Rays of
[2:03:15] that
[2:03:17] light and they told told him he will
[2:03:20] come to you
[2:03:22] first and you will be judged for what
[2:03:25] you preached and if you are
[2:03:29] accepted and you will be then we will go
[2:03:33] in on your
[2:03:38] teaching so the illumination that came
[2:03:40] through him and his Kentucky ways and
[2:03:44] his grammar and his nouns and his
[2:03:47] pronouns
[2:03:50] but what'll be surprising is one day our
[2:03:52] bodies will be
[2:03:54] changed I guess it wasn't the noun in
[2:03:56] the pronoun that God was concerned about
[2:03:58] then was it I mean that's a big thing in
[2:04:01] this day you know men don't want to be
[2:04:02] called by him anymore and then women
[2:04:04] don't want to be called by she anymore
[2:04:05] well you're supposed to call them shim
[2:04:07] Jim sham Jam I'm not sure exactly what
[2:04:09] re supposed to say anymore but I'm so
[2:04:12] glad that we can be able to hear what
[2:04:14] God is saying don't you understand what
[2:04:16] they're doing it's all about their
[2:04:18] rights they rights they rights that's
[2:04:20] right and that's the way we are for now
[2:04:22] careful me mine mine that's not why
[2:04:24] you're here for you're here to
[2:04:28] protect his right
[2:04:34] amen it's bar
[2:04:39] it oh
[2:04:43] Jesus Lord God I pray you would help us
[2:04:47] father what is scary thing it is to be a
[2:04:52] preacher it's a fearful thing to be a
[2:04:55] godall
[2:04:57] one and there's thousands of them that
[2:05:00] aren't even
[2:05:02] called it's evident we can see by some
[2:05:05] of the messes that even message
[2:05:07] preachers have made a lot of them ain't
[2:05:09] called either the prophet tells us in
[2:05:12] question answer 61 that he what he liked
[2:05:14] to look at was the person and see what
[2:05:18] they claim they were called to do
[2:05:21] because God will work with his creature
[2:05:23] the way that he's made him so he said if
[2:05:26] a man claims to be a
[2:05:29] pastor he can't be a flighty person God
[2:05:32] would never call a man like that to be a
[2:05:34] pastor and he said if a man claims to be
[2:05:37] a teacher watch how he interprets the
[2:05:42] word that'll tell you whether he's
[2:05:45] really called of God or not it's evident
[2:05:48] Lord just by that simple quote a lot of
[2:05:51] so-called teachers were not godall but
[2:05:55] the way they interpreted the word it's
[2:05:57] pretty visible when they get done they
[2:05:59] bring more confusion they have more
[2:06:01] questions and they do
[2:06:04] answers oh Lord help
[2:06:07] us may we
[2:06:09] stay in the Rays of the light
[2:06:13] father glory to
[2:06:16] God Jesus please help me me help me that
[2:06:20] I'll never leave this
[2:06:22] word father if I would ever start to the
[2:06:25] left or the
[2:06:27] right if you have to take me out of this
[2:06:31] world if I get stubborn and hard-headed
[2:06:34] and I won't be
[2:06:36] corrected take me out of this life
[2:06:39] Lord don't let me bring
[2:06:43] reproach God knowing that one day
[2:06:45] preachers are going to give an account
[2:06:48] and if there ain't but one Soul they
[2:06:50] lead
[2:06:51] astray that one soul will condemn
[2:06:55] them the prophet talked about when he
[2:06:57] was here that how many preachers said in
[2:06:59] their study and read acts
[2:07:01] 238 before they come out to preach but
[2:07:04] they wouldn't dare read it how many of
[2:07:07] these coward message
[2:07:09] preachers have the message books and the
[2:07:11] tapes and they sit and study them and
[2:07:13] Rob and use a prophet's words won't even
[2:07:16] tell where it come from
[2:07:19] yeah they'll answer at the day of
[2:07:21] judgment for
[2:07:23] it Lord God help me help these people
[2:07:28] father may we get away from our ideas
[2:07:31] and our opinions and my rights and they
[2:07:33] hurt my feelings and I think and I want
[2:07:35] this and I want that help us to realize
[2:07:38] Lord we are here to protect your
[2:07:42] rights and I've learned
[2:07:44] this if I will protect yours you will
[2:07:48] stand stand in defense of
[2:07:52] mine I've seen you do it many
[2:07:55] times Lord as you spoke to me some

[2:08:31] down in this building tonight father May
[2:08:34] every person under the sound of my voice
[2:08:36] leave here tonight with a different view
[2:08:40] to realize their main purpose in life is
[2:08:43] not to make money their main purpose in

[2:08:55] main purpose in
[2:08:57] life is to defend your

[2:14:02] can only see tonight father once they

[2:14:08] we actually become part of that light we
[2:14:12] become the light the carriers of the
[2:14:15] message and then people can look at see
[2:14:18] the very thing that many times the women
[2:14:19] are ashamed of their hair their dress
[2:14:21] their looks will be the very thing
[2:14:23] that'll catch people's attention and say
[2:14:25] why do you dress that way why are you
[2:14:26] different What Makes You Different what
[2:14:28] if they look like everybody else and
[2:14:29] talk like everybody else there wouldn't
[2:14:31] be no difference but it's that
[2:14:33] difference that you designated and the
[2:14:35] light of the Gospel let's that spread

[2:15:24] everything in his power to pull you away
