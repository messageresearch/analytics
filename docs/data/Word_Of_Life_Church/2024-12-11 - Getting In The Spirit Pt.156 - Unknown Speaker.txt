giving themselves away a little bit every day just to be good enough and what do you say to a hopeless Soul who can't remember their way home everything is out of their control there is is no Valley there is no Darkness there is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus there is no moment there is no distance there is no hard break he can't take you through [Music] [Applause] so before you think that you're too lost to say remember there is nothing greater than gra what do you say to someone whose life is on the line and they're unsure what happens after their last breath and what do you say to someone who's only known abuse when the walls they buil to save themselves makes it hard to hear the truth and what do you say to a life of regret that's trying so hard to forget and what do you say to dreams unmet there is is no Valley there is no Darkness there is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus there is no moment there is no distance there is no Heart Break he can take you through [Music] so before you think they you're too lost to say remember there is nothing greater than Grace don't lose hope don't let go don't give up you are not alone there is no Valley there is no Darkness there is no sorrow greater than the grace of Jesus oh there is no moment there is no distance there is no Heart Break he can take you through so before you think that you're too lost to say yeah before you think they you're too lost to save so before you think that you're too lost to save remember there is nothing greater than [Music] Grace I know you are familiar with the scripture that Zachariah says that the headstone will come crying what would it cry gifts gifts healings healings Miracles prayer lines and we believe in all that don't we what about shouting what about church attendance Grace Grace Grace that's what it's going to be that's going to get us there isn't it I'm just grateful tonight for the grace of God I'm grateful for the grace of God that saved me boy am I grateful for the grace of God that's kept me after I got saved I still need it there every day of my life and I'm sure that you do let's turn tonight to 1 Corinthians chapter 14 if you would 1 Corinthians 14 verse one follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts Desiring spiritual gifts and seeking spiritual gifts is not the same thing so follow after charity and desire spiritually gifts but rather rather that you may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understandeth him how be it in the spirit he speaketh Mysteries but he that prophesizes speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and Comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesies edifies the church now this is the way we can judge true prophecy if it edifies benefits makes the church grow so if it's called prophecy and it brings confusion if it's called prophecy and it doesn't happen if it's called prophecy and it doesn't tell an individual something or a church something that they need to hear it does not meet the scriptural identification or meaning of Prophecy he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesizes edifieth the church so it doesn't confuse the church doesn't leave the church and tumult nobody's edified by confusion nobody is edified by tumult or things that are swn and Discord that's what we want is it with all of our hearts if every one of us would set our goal and our purpose in life to be able to edify the church edify our families edify the things that God puts in our path you'll find you're not very far away from being a a complete and mature son and daughter of God it's not going to be how much you know up here it's how much you've got down here and how much you can be able to reflect that through from here out to what you know here and express it right here with these hands and your Deeds I me desire that to be that way in your life tonight I me like to be remembered as we pray God bless you I'm sure there's many needs Among Us you know there's a lot of things that are going on of course folks lives but we believe our God is a mighty God he's a Healer he's a miracle worker is that right so let's just take these needs and requests before him tonight father we count it such a great honor to be together once again Lord in this house that's been dedicated to you Lord Jesus we don't know how many more times will we be able to meet here and no doubt father some of us if we realize how close we were to death's door we would sing more sincerely we would clap our hands more sinc sincerely if we realize how few our days would be upon the Earth um I imagine most of us would live every day in a more consecrated way so I really don't know how many more days I've got so I figure the best way for me to do is live every day as if though it were my last I would rather live that way than have regrets at the end of my life and think well I could have done better here and I could have done more there help me Lord that I can live the best that I can every day of my life no doubt I will never get all accomplished that I think needs to be but I've become an old man now and I've realized it's not really important if it's accomplished the way I think it is but what's important is I do what you want me to do so I pray that you'd help each of us tonight father lead us by your spirit direct us through the word tonight Lord we ask in the name of Jesus and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated what a great privilege it is for us to be part of the body of Christ and to be in our place and uh I understand that brother Tim Bret went a little bit along the lines about everybody was called for a certain place and certain position to be able to be fulfilled we know before the Rapture can actually take place every member of the body of Christ must be in their position now remember there's two parts of this the mystical part and then the church local the mystical part has never hurt anybody the mystical Body of Christ is not the one that you and I have any issues with the mystical part is never the one that you're GI ever getting an argument with because every person that's born into the mystical part every one of them's got the Holy Ghost every one of them is born by the Breath of God so therefore there's nothing in them that clashes but it's those that we go to church with in the local assembly that's the ones that caus US problems that's the ones that we differ with and the ones that we don't like this and we don't like the way they do that and that we don't like something else and a lot of folks you know they think well I'm in the mystical part I'm in Christ so I really don't even need to attend a church but yet we know according to the scripture that the first people that were baptized into the mystical part they went to the Natural part as well because it's part of our assignment that we're given in this life it's part of our heritage actually and our responsibility and we know that the New Testament Church was typified in many different shadows and types and one the one of the wonderful things that I love about it is that God took the Natural Things of life as I was studying about it while I was gone for a few days hunting with some of the brothers and bringing in the work of redemption and how many of the natural things as I got to looking at it in botney life animal life blood type all those different things that God brought in the act of redemption and how many things from the earth that God actually Incorporated to sacrifice Fellowship worship and atonement maybe I could speak to you about it but Paul was the first one to be able to be able to really catch a full understanding the Lord Jesus of course opened it up and mentioned first about it but Paul was the one that God opened up the real understanding in the New Testament about what it was to be a part of the body in so much that Paul was would tell us in the book of Corinthians that the eye could not say to the hand or the hand to the eye or the foot you know well because I'm not the eye I'm not really that important nobody else in the New Testament ever quite dealt with the body of Christ in that way so we know that the body then is likened to the natural human body and then whenever we look at the human body we know there's certain parts of our human body that are absolutely essential for Life there certain things you could do without there's probably people here tonight that no longer have an appendix you maybe no longer have your full thyroid that you were born with or maybe you've only got one kidney maybe you've only got one this and half of that and a quarter of this and something else and there's certain parts of the body that God in his grace knew that people would actually have removed from their body but they'd still be able to live but yet there's other parts of your body that you absolutely abolutely cannnot function without God never gave us two hearts he never gave us two brains he never gave us two parts of certain things that's absolutely essential for us to live and we can look in the mystical body and realize that there might be 10,000 instructors as Paul said yet you have not many fathers so there might be all types of preachers in the body but not every preacher is a father because he don't have the power to beet every preacher is not a starter of the works of God but some preachers only come in after starters start the work of God every preacher is not a starter every preacher is not a finalizer that brings the body to the place of completion now we know that God sends prophets and he chops his people out with His prophets so prophets are the ones that are going to be the major Hing piece in every day and then God will send other aspects of the ministry and they will do the work some will be called to focus a lot on the Divine Healing part in the body others will be called to teach and they will help bring the element of the body into a place of their position to be able to help them see who they are what they are that they need to better themsel in a closer walk with God every man's called for a different spot but yet prophets have a special Insight even in dealing with the body now I love the way that brother brandham deals with this aspect of the body and Christ reveal in his own word which was preached in 8:22 the morning service in 1965 and he said we see down through the age we started all from the foundation through the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed now what went in the ground the complete seed which was in Alpha form God did not seow an impartial seed in the first church age but it was the complete seed when in the ground the complete seed that it come out through the feet in Luther now you got to be careful in types because now where having a human body which also parallels to a pyramid which is another type yet the pyramid does not start with Luther it starts with Paul now when you're running types if you're not careful if you try to run this type over in this type you'll get it all mixed up now watch the bottom of the pyramid did not start with Luther it started with the first church you with me so far but when we're talking about the restoration of the Bride tree it did not start with Paul because Paul under the administration of the anointing of the lion which was the Lamb's own personal life it was not a restored bride it was a whole bride but when you're looking at a restored bride we have a separate type and the analogy is not the same as it was in the pyramid so the pyramid started on the bottom foundation with faith First Church age messenger Paul but when we're looking at a restored bride back to the image and the Perfection of the son of man then it is the image oh she comes into the pyramid truly but when she comes into the image of a man then it does not start with Paul but it starts with Luther in the feet now watch he says it then it come through the feet Luther it come back then through Wesley then into the Pentecostals the tongues now watch what we do we move from Luther the feet and then we move from Luther on up into the stage of wesy which was a great portion of the body which was Whitfield Wesley John many of those men through that era so we come from the foundation part then we come up here then we move into Pentecost and what was Pentecostals type in the body it was the tongues yes the tongues the mouth they knew how to run their mouths but there was also a spiritual part now watch then into the Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now watch we're talking about the image of a man the restored image of the brid tree or you say brother Donnie make up your mind is it a man or is it a woman it's boast it's the restored image of Christ in his bride it will be that that will cause the resurrection now this couldn't happen in Luther Wesley or p Pentecost now watch he said then to bring back through Wesley then in the Pentecostals the tongues in the lips now it's in the eyes now watch now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so forth now there's nothing else left for it to come but him himself to step into that CU that's the last thing there is now watch the last move before the body Chang the next is the intelligence the intelligence Now isn't it amazing that here we are by science and one of the great innovations that science has broke into and I you see it everywhere you're dealing with it every day and don't even know it and it's called artificial intelligence or AI now watch man has come to a spot to where in the scientific age that his focus is on intelligence artificial intelligence Israel has been using it for quite some time to help fight this war over in Hamas and Hezbollah by using artificial intelligence they are starting to do surgeries actually starting to diagnose people with diseases and sicknesses with artificial intelligence now the other day before I went on my hunting trip brother Ron Spencer brother Tim and I were texting back and forth and I told him I was going to be gone for a couple of days and brother Ron said send me some photos so this is a text now so I get this text and I pick up my phone to say okay I sure will but before I could actually type out the answer myself I just updated my phone and my phone through AI asked me if I wanted to send Ron Spencer a photo now before I could even pick it up to answer it AI now I did a search today on a few things and you probably done it yourself and the first one that came up was AI generated artificial intelligence brother Larry Elliott sent me one some time ago and he asked artificial intelligence to write a song about William brandham and it was absolutely incredible brother William Smith sent me another one that he done about brother Joel and sister Jennifer Hara on the basis of Esther of the Old Testament except brother will went a little bit farther than brother Larry did and that was that he asked for a program that it would be someone to sing it you should have heard this song it was absolutely incredible so it talked talked about Joe and Jennifer and how they read their Bible and how they pray and all this and that wonderful just beautiful and this beautiful human voice which was created by AI to be able to sing this song then someone else also sent me something that they had generated and it was a consensus of the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed and artificial intelligence went in in a matter of seconds and put out a consensus of the message that brother Brandon preached and of course it was pressage because that's what these people were doing and it was so good I almost brought it to church and preached it to you all I mean I thought wow this is absolutely incredible and yet there's not there's not a human with skin on it but it's actually humans that have brought this together to make it you follow me that's M making this ability to do that now to me there's also a scary side of that so what what could artificial intelligence do if it goes to turning on us human beings but look at where they are so they are at the state that artificial intelligence is going to start helping doctors it's going to start helping perform surgeries and do all sorts of things chap GPT and so many things that you're familiar with and yet it's constantly there even for our children going to school how are their teachers going to be able to know whether they are answering their homework theirself or AI is doing it for them a famous country music singer lost his voice not long ago because he had a a medical condition that affected him and he was told by doctors he would never be able to sing again but yet it was his desire to make at least one more song If possible so these people got together and they begin to talk to him and his wife and his manager and tell him hey you know what through AI we believe there's something we can do so someone wrote this certain song and sent it to him and you know he motioned and wrote he could write down a little bit and tell them that's the one I'd like to do it so they had another country music singer to come and actually laid down a soundtrack and then they fed this artificial intelligence this man's voice that he had sung for years and years and years and then let him get the tempo the Rhythm the intro the musicians all this and that and the other and then through run it all of that through artificial intelligence and when they got done with it here was this country music singer which could no longer sing but he was singing again now if man can do that through machines what if the voice of God had been stifled and held down by organiz ational systems and man-made ideas for hundreds and hundreds of years but the intelligence not artificial but the real intelligence of Christ himself was so step into his body that they in the last days will call for the resurrection amen and it will not be just their voice screaming and hollering or speaking low or mediocre whatever but it will actually be the voice of God himself and where did the prophet tell us in the church AG book the voice of God in the last days would be where it would be in the bride is that right and it it's not we're not looking for some Eighth Day messenger for some other Prophet to rise on the scene and tell us what brother Brenham did not say or pick up more brother Brandon left all we don't believe in any such nonsense at this church is that right but what if God would take that message which has already been preached and make it so real through us that we live that word we talk that word and it brings us to that place of completion and Perfection to where that the intelligence now if we are at that spot right up here now that does not mean whenever the eyes was here there was no more lips or there was no more tongues because those eyes told us there should always be a gift of speaking in tongues in the church is that right so now remember when we're coming up the body it does no longer mean that the body no longer has feet we still have action in the body we have legs we have all of that in the body but we are not going backwards and downwards to make the emphasis of our day the feet we're not making the emphasis of our day the thighs or the upper torso no no we are not nor are we making the emphasis of our day the mouth the tongues come on somebody we that is not our emphasis yes it is part but it is only part as a matter of fact the prophet said speaking in tongues is the least of the gifts well why in the world would we want a major on a minor then but do we need them you answer me do you all believe in speaking in tongues y'all believe in Prophecy come on so they can hear you on the internet y'all believe in the Supernatural you believe in signs wonders Miracles all of that yes but what is going to be the bride's main emphasis it's not just healing it's not just Miracles it's not just speaking in tongues it's all of that it's that plus praise the lord we believe the whole word so we believe in adoption we believe in the Supernatural we believe in the great manifestation of God God knows we need it like never before do we not now notice where the Prophet then places us that we are up now watch he said so the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own it's his we have no s height of our own how can a man foresee those things he can't do it it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through and then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride notice masculine and feminist feminist is the flesh masculinity is the deity of God himself so it's God living in a ride on the earth in the last days which will become his mouthpiece so it's not that she has her own intelligence we're dumb and everybody said go ahead and say it about yourself I'm a dummy say it with me I'm a dummy no you're not saying that I am you're saying that you are I am a dummy we are dummies we without God we don't know anything come on somebody we didn't know how many gods there were we didn't know how to get saved we in the heart had to do nothing right but God by his grace allowed us to find it doubt then God wants to drop the intelligence what would it be a favor believer in our church had this dropping of the portion of intelligence of God in your life I wonder how many of the mistakes and things that we make because of the lack of leadership will disappear before we leave this place why because we are LED of the spirit of God listen to this then the complete body of Christ is reveal in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning like Adams was rather at the beginning so then a after we have arrived now right up here was where we were in Malachi 4 the eyes this is why the prophet could see so there's no other eyes out of these eyes now I don't understand it but you know there's people in the message that have actually got another set of eyes up here and another set up there and another set up here and they've got all kinds of men that they're following and they're looking for this prophet and that Prophet I'll tell you one thing you have got some kind of weird looking body if you ask me you've got about six or six or eight different sets of eyes in that head you are some kind of deform we don't need no another set of eyes but what we need are people under the administration of the eyes to get under the influence of the Divine intelligence then what will it do well if artificial intelligence offered to help me send a picture to brother Ron Spencer and artificial intelligence help me today generate my search on Google and artificial intelligence it's already doing if you you just don't know it so don't be terrified and scared today as you've already been using it Siri and those types of things are very similar so when whatever it's there what's it for to help you well what do you think the intelligence of Christ is going to be in the body it's not to make you and I superheroes it's not to make us Mighty Man and Wonder Woman it's to help us to live the right kind of Godly life that we can absolutely defy hell every day that we are here don't think that it's going to turn us into a bunch of people that's going to start walking in every hospital and emptying them out Jesus didn't even do that and brother brenon didn't do it and we're sure not going to do it we're not going to start walking on these rivers and lakes and Creeks around here but I'll tell you what we will do we'll be so Godly that there'll be something generated out of our soul that people will be able to witness that there is a God that there is a God they may never believe your theology they may never understand your theology but they will not be able to get away from that aura which is around you which can only be brought to this stage when the body reaches this intelligence the feet are awesome oh my the legs the Torso it was awesome there was some great things that happened in Pentecost yes there were it was not all fanaticism it was not all flesh I saw many wonderful things happen in the dispensation of the mouths and the tongues but it was nothing compared to what happened in the eyes but remember there's nothing else that moves Beyond here so you can move your eyes up down sideways back and forth every way you want to move them around around I can't do mine that way I get sick but you can move them but your brain does not move now I saying we don't believe in Movement we do but that's not our main focus amen oh praise the Lord so then why would we as message people want to make the majority of our Focus back down in the mouth so you mean that's what we're focusing on just preaching more and more and more about the the three vocal gifts oh the gifts the gifts the gifts the gift and the gifts the gifts the gift why are we going backwards so you mean the next thing up according to the eyes was the intelligence and some of the Brethren are backtracking and you take the mouth preaching out of what they say oh my pretty sad I think notice again he says there's not one son in the morning and another son in the afternoon it's the same Sun same Sun that's in the afternoon is in the morning the same in the morning is in the afternoon now it said the day itself the day between that time will be kind of a like a dismal dark day it could not be called day or night never May he's quoting Zachariah in between that see that's the forming of the body from the feet coming up so I wonder how many people in here would know me by my feet my grandchildren probably wouldn't Carol might so how many would know you by your feet what about your legs we're decent people we keep them covered up so what are you known by face so your face is made up of what Pentecost Malachi 4 and Christ's intelligence amen so no matter what I would have on I mean oh my if You' have seen me last week and we was hunting in 13 degree weather and I had everything on the world about every s of clothes I had with me on to keep from freeing to death and you would have still recognized me though cuz there's one thing I didn't have covered up and that was my face I had ear muffs on my ears keeping from falling off Brother D but my face was still visible now you could have looked at my legs you would have not known me from the Abominable Snowman man you would have not known me from many of the other Hunters that were there you could have looked at my feet and saw that I had had on really nice warm boots and I had this and that in the other you still wouldn't have known who I was all right we're looking for brother Donnie we're trying to find brother Donnie I don't know that don't look like his feet I don't know what they look like well try to notify me by my knees look at my knees see if that separates look up here around my waist see if that separates me come on up around my chest so that where we look when we look at people we look at them in the face and the face is a relevance of where we are in the end time and you can see why that people can get so confused so easily because the distance from here to here is so close so close that it would deceive the very ele if possible look how close it is from your mouth to your eyes and then how close the eyes to the intelligence so what is it that controls the eyes your intelligence what controls the feet your intelligence your hands what all of that but yet the connection and the flow of divine energy has never been hallelujah what it's supposed to be the last day it wasn't in the feet it wasn't in the thighs in that way it wasn't even in Pentecost because the prophet said what seemed to be the outpouring of the Holy Ghost of that restoration it was not for just a few years it proved that many of them did not even have the Holy Ghost oh my so why friends why would we not want to keep going do we need feet do we need legs do we need tongues do we still need the eyes it's easy to see how some of the message people have that have turned to left from the message you know what when they do they're as blind as a bad I said they're as blind as a bad they're trying to grind to go straight into the intelligence of Christ and bypass the eyes which helps them read to comprehend the intelligence so they go straight from the mouth straight to the head straight from the lips straight up here straight from there straight up to I don't need them eyes if you're going to read you do if you're going to see the future I don't know I don't understand I cannot perceive Without Eyes the eyes told me this is what to look for this will be the signs the eyes told us that church aren't you glad the eyes soulless and then here we are right up here and it's processing processing where the Feet's going what the legs and the thighs did what the Torso did it's looking at Pentecost and processing and divining here's the True Vine here's the false Vine here's the twins in the last days what does that it's not your mouth that processes and discerns it's your intelligence oh Lord Jesus you see that's the forming of the body from the feet from the feet coming up when he was on Earth he was the Sun the likess the likess then he was killed the church took his place praise God the church took his place well it couldn't be said about the Catholic church that they've took his place it couldn't said be said about denomination not many of them that they took his place I don't even believe what he did they don't believe what he said many of them know is that right so they can't take his place so there's got to be a church in the last days that will take his place how can they take his place without his intelligence cuz I guarantee you there's going to be more to seit in this end time than there's ever been watch then he was killed the church took his place then martyred them went through the Dark Ages began to build on the foundation coming out then where does the sight come from at the top of the head then it started right back coming back the church come back from the feet coming up now it's in the head time head time now it's amazing because God sent the eyes while the lips were still talking and God let the eyes see back to the original word and he went around trying to tell the lips and the tongues y'all ain't operating this right you ain't doing right with it you're you're misusing them and and you're you're causing more of a stumbling block than you are a benefit F but did the lips take it did the tongues take it they said oh he don't know he was a Baptist he didn't understand being a Baptist or a Methodist or a heathen didn't make no difference it's the position that he held Oh Glory to God so are we then going back down this way and bypass the enlightenment that the eyes brought to what they had brother Jim you saw it as a young Pentecostal boy others here saw it as a Pentecostal and you'd see gifts that would hit right on and then other things they said was a million miles off thus sayith the Lord this and this and this a preacher text me the other day after the last Wednesday night service that I preached he said remember being a seven-year-old boy in a Pentecostal church and somebody was spoken in tongues and somebody got up and prophesying they started telling a big bunch of stuff and before they got done prophesying they wind up cussing right in church oh that'll never happen to us who say it won't happen to us if we don't judge our prophecy by what they eyes said instead of the mouth now watch oh oh my you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you see that's that's in in in every move it's been that way the hands work work work work work work work let's do this let's do that let's do that work work work work work but you see we're privileged in that we know how to send our hands to work through the direction of the eyes and their ages they didn't they did not know brother Harvey exactly how how do we do this how do we do that so they'd work and oh boy they'd do all this and they do all that oh praise God I'll tell you one thing I buy to the Widow some coal and I do this and the other oh that's good but the eyes told us the real meaning of compassion that compassion was not human sympathy but compassion is actually doing the will of God I don't know about you but I've let the devil play on my compassion many a time and help people out socalled and I wouldn't helping them at all I was actually making them worse well I didn't figure y'all like it but that's okay I got the doctrine of the eyes behind me that's what I'm want to judge everything I do don't you so the eyes told us that Jesus when he was on the earth he walked in amongst a multitude of people and went to a man that had a prostate trouble and it wasn't going to kill him he'd been that way for years and years he stepped over the lane the halt the blind the and went to one man and healed him why compassion now what would you have thought if you would have sat there that day and thought that Jesus had that power to heal maybe stepped over a little baby that was crippled another little child that was deformed another one that was mentally off and the Lord Jesus went to a man that was there he wasn't going to die of what he had he had no choice of doing that why he had compassion but we think human sympathy is compassion I never even knew what that really was until the eyes told me well I can tell look in some of y'all's faces y'all just found it out here tonight well good the eyes are still talking ain't they praise the Lord now watch you can't see with your hands yet it's part of the body you can't see with the ears yet it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was the ah okay so they done a lot of talking but they just didn't see very far praise the Lord I can say that not only by theology but by experience oh yeah I've done a lot of running a lot of screaming a lot of Hing hey I've seen a lot of genuine Miracles at the same time I've seen absolutely phenomenal Miracles and I was as dumb as I don't know what when it come to the word why I didn't have no eyes I had a lot of hands to pray for the sick I anointed them with old I run up and down and shouted and screamed and holler I gave everything I had to my mouse Ministry praise the Lord I give everything I had to my tongue Ministry but boy I thank God I finally got some eyes I still talking tongues oh Lord God brother Donnie no oh Lord God yes I do I still I still have feet I've still got legs I've still got all of that but none of that is my emphasis and I am not going backwards and made the emphasis of this day the mouth the tongues the feet Luther Wesley I want to bring all of that up here and let it be connected to the intelligence and then the intelligence move the feet the intelligence move the hands praise God praise God you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was the Pentecostal age but now it's in the eye time that the seeing now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye praise God the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body so you can see why that people could make denominations do you understand there's a bride on the Earth today that absolutely cannot make an organization now there's people around this message that will and have but the bride cannot why because the intelligence of God will not allow her to do so so it's not just the eyes oh I can see I can see I can see the next thing is friends we don't want to stop just say oh brother Brandon was so wonderful yes he was he was a great servant of God a great prophet of God but I'm praying I hope you are for the very last thing in this body I'm not looking for brother brandom to come back oh yes he's raising in the resurrection but I'm not looking for a tent come on somebody I'm not looking no sir I'm not looking for him to have a private Resurrection never taught any such thing I am looking for the resurrection of the Dead not just one but all of those in Christ Jesus that's what I'm looking for and I will be changed how can me a 68 year old man go back to being 18 to 20 because the intelligence tells me to so the altar of eternal life living in my soul and stepped into my mystical part one day tells me Donnie become a young man and it will divinely charge me and run through my mortal body and all of a sudden all the scars and the beets and the bangs and the gray hair and this and that and the other that I've got and the wrinkles that I've got praise God they will be gone why because the Divine intelligence tells me so so we could have the feet we could have the hands we could have the lips we could have the tongues we can even have the mental aspect of the eyes but if we don't get the intelligence we won't go in the body change you see there's a mental facei to every one of these moves that was a mental facei to the feet a mental Faith to the knees and The Shins and all of that there was a mental Faith to the tongues and there is a mental faith I said oh yes I believe every word that Prophet said that's just words that's just words if you believe it you'll do it that's right you will do it and this message the eyes will lead you to the intelligence Christ I'm not here to worship brother brandham I'm not here to baptize in his name come on church we are not here to Rally around any man we are here to Worship the Lord Jesus we are here to magnify his name he's the Healer he's the Savior he's the deliverer he's the one we worship [Applause] tonight oh my the next is the intelligence which is Christ itself who controls the whole body no moving motion beyond that everything else has moved move your feet move your muscles in your legs move everything your ears can move your nose your lips and so forth but after your eyes there was nothing moves you know what it does takes human Works away from you and I makes us totally dependent upon Our Savior himself you can't beg you can't scream enough you can't beat the altar you can't cry you can't fast enough it's got to be the spirit of God in you now the mind that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer there is the soul souls in prison now now we find out on that part you see there is nothing beyond the eye every form every move every place in the body positionally shows us the very hour we're living in so just by looking at the spiritual anatomy of where we are right here friends right here not down here not not down here not down here can't you see and science has keeps on going going going and the sad part about it is religion is stale stale and stale so the lutherans are hundreds of years behind the methodists are hundreds of years behind the Pentecostals are many many years behind and it's sad to say but some of the people in the message are many many years behind they're waiting on brother B to come back oh that's when the Revival's coming Ain't nobody got the Holy Ghost Say say ain't nobody adopted Sons Ain't nobody got this we're all just kind of waiting hanging out for brother Bram to come that's an absolute Lie from the pits of Hell there's a bride on the face of the Earth the same has the same holy ghost that Peter had that Paul had on the day of Pentecost the same one brother Skip and they're doing the same works but this is part of the intelligence you see Paul had that when Paul said I wanted to go here I wanted to go there but the spirit wouldn't let me so you see it's not about you it's not even about your ministry or your gift it's not about you being promoted and you being something else it's about the intelligence and if he tells you no don't go here no don't do that oh but you see friends this is the scary part that there is a satanic artificial intelligence and it's very very spiritual that's why the prophet when he preaches Harvest Time F but listen that you need to that he said Satan can hand out them gifts Supernatural gifts by the handfuls and he said if you won't leave the word then he'll try to make you a supernatural offer he might let you speak in tongues he might let you prophesy he said even though it be a milon miles off the word ah but it's supernatural what is that a false artificial intelligence to try to move the body what was that thing in the Garden of Eden that got a hold of Eve it was another another intelligence instead of the spirit of God God knows in the day you eat there oh my that that you can't believe all that stuff God's trying to keep something from you don't you understand what the devil was doing tried to get her run ahead of the program of God she would have finally become a mother by the spoken word oh people to think of that how many brides revivals have we had through this message how many have come oh Lord hasten the day that the last one will arrive and the true bride will be waiting for the manifestation of that word a promise to live itself out of her life will there be healings yes there will not only healings Resurrection from the dead oh praise the Lord notice this every form every move every place in the body shows this position the very hour we're living in not another move can come above it there was a move of the hand charity Wesley there was a move of the foundation lucer charity never a greater it was called Wesley move they sent missionaries to all the world look qu a big move this was in the Wesley move look how big they went everywhere such love they sent missionaries all the world one of the greatest moves that was ever made in the age before then it come to the Pentecostal age then come in the different fingers and things the Pentecostal age of tongues and nose and so forth uh it's probably one of the reasons that some of the Pentecostal said I smell a demon here tonight uhhuh that's Pentecostal oh I know all those some of our message preachers say the same thing the prophet of God said you can't smell no demon I'm going to take the eyes what the eyes said instead of a flopping Mouse well praise the Lord I'll tell you one thing children the the problem is some of our Brethren are taking and bypassing the teach in of the eyes as if though he did not understand the mouth and the problem is because they actually think brother Brenham taught something different than Paul did woo I figured y'all be quiet tonight but I figured at least somebody say Amen or ouch or just wiggle your finger let me know you're with me or something now do we believe in the Supernatural gifts of God yes we do as a church notice now the gifts are actually sent to keep the church clean not to magnify this brother that speaks in tongues or this brother that interprets or this sister that would be able to prophesy it's not it's not about that it's to edify the body and the gifts are there to work in the church to keep the church clean notice this Wood River Illinois we just passed through there Monday night he said into the church Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues that's all for the edifying or keeping the keeping clean of the church okay so if we are truly seeing the gifts of God is there any house cleaning going on so in tongues interpretation and prophecy are going forth is to tell people to clean up this in their life and that in their life I'm not talking about generic now I'm talking about something that's so identifiable oh you say I saw it in Pentecost were preachers I don't know why but it's always been this way for years that preachers wanted to be above and beyond just the regular preacher guy you know you just go to church you study and you preach and you pray and you try to feed God's people and you try to live right and all that but there's been Aire are and many men that they wanted to be so Supernatural and so profound you know they just had to look at you really strange and make you feel really eerie they look at you very strange the next thing you know you know your hair standing up on the back of your neck you say Lord have mercy what in the world don't you think them men can't tell that don't you think they cannot tell when you get nervous they know enough about body language to see you are oh there's somebody here tonight that's got a need they've got this or that or the other baloney brother Tony be careful no you be careful cuz what I'm going to read to you is through the eyes I saw what the mouth does I experienced that I saw it heard what the lips do it just flat out bothers me friends that we see some of our brothers doing exactly the same thing as Pentecost and calling it The Bride move it ain't no bride move at this church if you folks want to vote me out that's fine if y'all getting tired of hearing me preach that's okay get you somebody else if that's what you want but as long as I'm here I'm going to tell you what these eyes said I'm leading you I'm trying my best to lead you up to this next stage of the intelligence why do we want to go back down to here and say oh this is it this is it this is it no this is not it we've done past that sure we bring it with us but that's not the emphasis of this hour I need help I need help and I'm not going to get it just from muttering in tongues and I believe in that I thank God I still speak in tongu but I need intelligence I need wisdom I need knowledge I need the leadership of the spirit of God I don't get it from my mouth notice again he said first as Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors those five god-given gifts in the church so each of your people who has a Godly Pastor has a gift from God in your church a Shepherd pastor means a Shepherd to watch over the flock to teach them the word of God then these other nine different spiritual gifts should be operating in the church amen but now remember here's the way it'll happen so the mouths opened and the tongue spoke and the lips framed the words under Pentecost much of what was said was not even the Lord it was impression it was thinking that's what the Lord said but God said I am not going to let this word of mine fall down and never be accomplished so I'm going to send the eyes and the eyes are going to retrain my bride and my bride they may not have the multitude that the lips has got but they'll be talking right thinking right singing right living right and flying light glory to God we're fixing to leave out of this place children now notice so God is going to bring all you say well he done away with all that you show me where the Bible says that he done away with all of that God's Prophet never taught that once we get up here in the intelligence and up in the eye we didn't need no Supernatural while a great portion of his ministry was based on Supernatural we still need Supernatural oh thank the Lord for it too then these other nine spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean amen ah then what does the eyes do the eyes goes to the bottom of the pyramid crosses over from the human anatomy type and goes over into the Mountain of God type and goes right down to the original foundation of the pyramid and pull from that original foundation in the book of Acts now this is what the gifts are supposed to do in the church keep the church perfected and clean my notice like ananas and Safara so when ananas wed up before Peter what' Peter say a brother now now uh you you've got a need now oh boy something man wow man well I don't understand people they just n fall out when somebody says something like come on a sinner could say that what did Peter tell him why did Satan put in your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost was not this proper to yours why did you and your wife make this deal look come on let's produce the gifts this way okay but much of it is said in such a way that you never really know if it comes to pass or not there's no dates there's no dead lines there's no this or that or the other it's so generic come on I know folks is going to get mad at me they're already mad at me already but that's all right the intelligence is Blessing Me praise the Lord you realize now that their God's Prophet ties it right back to the book of Acts the spirit of God rise up and call somebody out and tell them they're living wrong why to rebuke that sin openly brother sister you got something in your life so and so and so and so and you say good Lord we come back in here Sunday I mean I realize I may not been near as many of us but hey do we want God or do we want to play Church you tell me do we want God in reality do we want TR whether or not you want it ananas and Safara will return in the last days amen it's not just going to be men that are been magnified and I prayed for so and so and this happened if you haven't listened to thetive Spirit March of 1960 I advise you listen to it and you hear the prophet of God talking about Discerning spirits on men and watching how they do with a Great Mighty gift and see if they try to use that gift to bring glory and honor to thems then he said you're not really judging that man but you're judging his attitude and his you know whatever that he's doing with that gift so you know what I'm I'm protected by the eyes to do such now watch he said that's what the holy spirit is in the church for to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord so for our churches around the message that have the gifts moving is that what it's doing testing one two3 test 112 so is it telling brother Keith brother Keith you done this and this on Monday brother you should not have done that repent does it tell brother Rob brother rob you should not have said this to your wife sister Sarah just because she burnt your cornbread before church you had an awful attitude brother repent for that brother Rob and Sister Sarah look at each other and say he looks over honey I'm so sorry but does the modern message rendition make anybody repent and clean yeah the Lord say I'm here and now the Lord said I bless you all and how the Lord say I do this and how the Lord say i' do that and I said i' do this you're quoting scripture and the prophet said prophecy is not that way amen and the church said but you see the problem we're going back to the mouth and we're cons Consul in Mouse theology instead of Consulting our theology in order to use the mouse to bring it out the right way this is why Satan don't want it right this is why he wants us to accept a substitute that hits and misses listen friends there was things said about my daughter Erica that did not have happen and never will happen is it hurtful very is it disappointing very what's even more disappointing than something been said that's wrong but men without the guts to come to you and apologize and say I said something wrong please forgive me stand out before forever they preach that I'm so sorry I I I I I I said the Lord said that or or I told him that was the Lord come on don't get quiet Lord of Mercy if you get any quieter you a bunch of Egyptian mummies there were Supernatural occurrences socalled that happened that supposedly was supposed to be about my daughter that never happened and never will so we just let things go come on now now I made the offer here a few weeks ago everybody that's mad at me to get me a gift card there's only one person that done it and it was a preacher friend of mine he wasn't even mad at me look friends I saw gifts with hit Miss hit Miss hit Miss I'm not interested in hit Miss I'm interested in hit hit hit hit hit every time on target one more quote and I'll let you go now we said in the church to keep the church in line with the word what tapes tapes tapes tapes and more tapes you say a man who tapes that and says tapes is a liar and he don't believe what the Bible said nor what the prophet said keep on you're going to get me killed sir God sent men not man called God sent inspired men to keep the church lined up now what is it gifts of the spirit in the church not a bunch of fanaticism but truly gifts of the Spirit in the church that's right keeping the church if a real church is ordained of God really filled with the Holy Spirit if sin would appear in the church it would be another ananas and Safara okay so our churches look down on because we don't have tongues interpretation of Prophecy going on every service or every other service and we're not supposed to be spiritual but for the those who are operating it where is ananas and Safar if somebody had done something wrong the Holy Spirit rise right up and reveal it that have to clean up the gifts of the Spirit in the church oh God oh God send us a church like that now watch here's the eyes saying oh God send us a church like that not doing away with the mouth not doing away with the lips but Harry now we know how to judge it right why the gifts are put in the church to separate and take sin out to keep the church clean it's God's toxin that's given to the church also his disinfect wow so you mean gifts are like a disinfectant a spiritual LOL or a spiritual bleach you know or spiritual ammonia wo boy that stuff most of that stuff I just mentioned has got a terrible Aroma to it don't it and it'll burn your hands and you don't like smelling it come on somebody but that's what the real gifts are so the real gifts that put off this sweet adorable man worshiping Aroma you need some ammonia come on somebody you need to get rid of your glory of Vanderbilt you need to get rid of your Gambler musk and all that sort of thing and get some of God's good oldfashioned this and infectant it'll kill that love of Pride it'll kill that arrogance it'll kill that man worship it'll kill that idolatry of lifting men to a place that they shouldn't [Applause] be oh my let me tell you some friends I do not judge the word by a spirit I judge Spirits by the word let's stand pray praise the lord it's been good knowing y'all if I don't see you again I realize some of my brothers are taking clips from my sermons and passing them around that's okay as long as my voice is identified saying what the eyes said I have no problem with that now have any of you all heard me quote Donnie Reagan tonight as far as I know we have no Donnie Reagan quote books do we I mean I've never seen one myself so what was I reading to you tonight from the eyes let's go back down to the foundation of the pyramid 1 Corinthians 144 he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies himself but he that prophesy look at the meaning of the word speak forth by Divine interpretations to predict ah here's where it gets scary you see this is where when brother brandham and his own church corrected the people and went to Brother Neville and told him said brother Neville leave them alone they're babies we can't judge it now so he said when it come time to set it in order he said a lot of what they was saying never even come to pass in the brandham Tabernacle and whenever he set Church order in he said a big bunch of them left they pulled away from the teaching of the eyes and left Hallelujah and he said one man told him will you put us on the spot he said don't you think I'm on the spot when I stand before hundreds or thousands of people and tell them your name is so and so you went to a doctor yesterday and this and this but thus sayeth the Lord by next week this time you'll be made well right I tell you friends it's absolutely phenomenal how many Pentecostal people are putting out testimonies on YouTube I saw one not long ago of a man that went to Brother bram's meetings when he was a young boy and his father and mother was there and brother brandham called out a woman and they knew this woman and brother bandam called her out and told her said you live in streets so and so such and such and so and so and that man and woman looked at one another and said we know her that's not where she lives that's not where she lives and they said Oh Brother R and missed it brother R and missed it so they went to that woman after church but you see the thing of it was the Holy Ghost had already updated her address book but they didn't know it so they go to her and said oh sister you know brother R called you out and he he gave you the wrong address he said oh no brother sister I I just I just moved that's what I'm talking about amen hallelujah may God grant to us this to prophesy with the idea of foretelling future events pertaining especially to the kingdom of God to utter Force declare a thing which can only be known by divine revelation this is why it cannot be a repeating of script scriptures that's known by reading a real prophecy of God tells something that's not even in the in the written word you can see why there'll be few and far between but I'd rather have it three times a year or four operating the mouth from the intelligence down to the teaching of the eyes and then Focus this way instead of bypassing the eyes and coming straight to the mouth oh we don't believe in that old church or we don't believe that old church order be careful what you're saying that's not my terms that's the prophet's terms I want gifts too but this is the order I want them not from here out from here down through the teachings of the eyes and then it comes down this way so if one says say I'm an interpreter of tongues and this is the way we'll judge them all right brother sisters so do you hear them speaking in tongues in English well no I just feel led to say it then you don't have an interpretation cuz the eyes says that you hear it in your native language which you was born in but friends this is the problem some of the folks feel out brother brandom was not saying what Paul said I honestly don't know how you could follow a prophet like that so what else did he say that Paul didn't say but them folks that was carried beyond the curtain of time when he said will all leaders be judged he said yes well he said if Paul's people goes in mine will too cuz what Paul preached I preached millions of voices screamed out we are resting on that I'm going to say it tonight that's what I'm resting on if God's Prophet taught for us to do a certain thing do it this way and that way whether or not I even understand it I'm going to do it and if it comes down to opinions I'll even take his own opinion over my own yeah cuz he was eyes I'm just barely a cell stuck somewhere in the middle of the body come on children I don't do my opinion the way some preachers do and they exalt their opinion above the eyes that's pretty foolish if you ask me don't you love him don't you see the last false bride move whatever it is the last false so-called brid Revival when the last one strikes and hits just the other day I saw a message preacher clip that was sent to me said the end is tomorrow the Lord's coming tomorrow so y'all just forget everything cuz it's it's tomorrow then I got another clip a week later and he said the Lord has delayed is coming them hundreds of people ought to kicked him out but instead most of them would be right there screaming and hollering God have mercy on us children do you realize how many message people are going to be lost absolutely lost without God why they do not value this word they handle this word like it's a toy they handle this word like it's a Play-Doh and God's Prophet said three times in the Bible it was an unpardonable sin to add one word of your own interpretation to a message after you have been Vindicated to be the truth unpardonable sin there will be message people that will walk up to the white Throne convinced that they're going into heaven and the Lord Jesus will look at them and say depart from me I gave you eyes and you refused him may God help us one of the scariest categories in this message is preachers how many have we had that a walk before God as lost as a harlot as lost as a drun why because they exalted their own opinion above the eyes of Malachi 4 you see God allowed his Prophet to leave out certain things on purpose why did Jesus say father son Holy Ghost it was said on purpose why were many things left out even in the message left out on purpose so these mongr and Seed of the serpent would come around and say well he almost said it that's what he meant how can we say what he meant my Lord sometimes I don't even know what I mean I don't even know what you mean that's what a prophet meant but don't you understand God does it that way because it's a temptation to man it's a temptation to human beings to want to go ahead and say it just I just got to say go ahead but I want to say what's been spoken yep you know what you come back 20 years from now if I'm still alive then still preaching you know what you're going to hear me preaching the same message you heard 35 years ago when I was here some of the folks and I came here 30 some years ago they didn't like what I was preaching they've come back again I'm still preaching the same thing well they leave and come back again another 10 years if we're still here 10 years you know what I'll be preaching same thing same thing they didn't believe 35 years ago same thing they didn't believe 25 years ago same thing they didn't believe last year so where does people with unbelief stand before God lost lost I sent you prophets and you killed them Prophet tells us about it in sort they said they do the same thing in every generation God will send them a prophet then about another generation they'll polish his tomb and make an idol out of his life make an idol out of his life we are not Amish we are not menites we're not following Joseph Menon we're not looking for another man to make our Idol brother BR never come to make us branhamites he come to make us Sons and Daughters of God to lead us back to a new birth that's what he tells us was the theme of his life in the church age book that men and women would have a closer walk with God except what the message has done for you don't you love the message I'll tell you one thing I love it now more than ever before we're under more persecution and I it's going all over the United States and newspapers and you know all kinds of newscasts and this and that and the other and it shows to me the devil is more scared of this message now than he was in 1965 he hates this message why ain't he doing that to the Bible why ain't he doing that to Martin Luther why ain't he doing that to Pentecost why this message is the Capstone it's the eyes you cannot get to the intelligence from the mouth up you got to have that Capstone right there on the next thing to the intelligence is the eyes itself forgive me if for going on long let let's pray together oh dear Jesus what an hour to be living Lord how I thank you for this message Lord God we want the word to be our absolute we want our church to be built upon that absolute of the word I thank you for some of the experiences I had in Pentecost because I found an element of reality there though it was mixed up with a lot of mess but Lord Jesus I'm so grateful that there was a deep down inside of me hungering for more I had Miracles I had tongues I had interpretation and I had prophecy so if that's all I needed then why did I ever need to come to the message why wasn't I happy why wasn't I satisfied why was it when I come across that Wolf Creek Dam that night and your presence filled that automobile and my hair was standing up on my arms and I was so under the presence of the Lord by myself in that car that I had to pull over just as I crossed the dam and I was afraid to even look sitting there with my eyes closed and my head bowed and I heard your voice in the back seat and it like just scared me to death Lord you remember the night I wasn't even following the message didn't believe it then but you spoke my destiny and you told me there was something greater right just ahead me and my mouth thinking I saw maybe more signs more wonders more gifts this that the other I didn't know exactly what it was but it was what I was ordained to walk in you said I didn't even believe in predestination I didn't even believe in ordination oh I could quote it from the Bible but I was quoting it from my mouth's understanding so the intelligence come back in the back seat of my car and spoke out my destiny oh Jesus oh Jesus help us Lord father I pray for every man woman boy and girl in this place tonight maybe Satan's wiring them out with their failures and their mistakes and their shortcomings but may the intelligence of Christ the Holy Ghost himself maybe they're back sting maybe they're in a cold State tonight Lord but may you speak from within themsel from within their soul and say daughter you are not called to be this but you're called to a higher call son you're called to a higher place oh God woo each heart each child of yours father I say to you tonight with all sincerity of my my heart these are the gifts I so desire I don't want hits misses flesh things not even said in such a way that it can be proven or disproved that if it's said the preachers take glory and if it's said in such a way that it seems that come to pass they take Glory but it's also said in such a way if it don't come to pass they never said thus sayeth the Lord so well I was just trying to encourage them and yet we as message people swallow it down it ain't no wonder the Rapture ain't come lord it's evident we're not ready we're letting the mouse dictate to us what our services ought to be we're letting the mouth tell us what it should be God we want our services to be what the intelligence tells us through the eyes and comes down through the mouth and speaks out the way you said it should be Lord granted father I'd rather have a dozen true prophecies in our church in 8 10 years whatever it would be than to have a whole bunch of Flesh and a whole bunch of stuff that ain't even in reality Prophecy in the first place no sir I don't want it I want the real send us genuine speakers with tongues genuine interpreters genuine ones that can speak true prophecy true discerners Lord and that discernment that belongs in the church body is not to replicate the prophet's gift cuz the eyes told us your pastor won't do this cuz there's only one to a generation we believe what them eyes had to say Lord but father we want discerners that can discern whether tongues are true tongues interpretation is true interpretation cuz that's what the eyes told us but of course many of our brothers are going back and insulting the mouth we don't want the mouth interpretation we see what it brought them to some of the quotes Lord that I've read in the last several months even dealing with question answers to the youth was taken from the sermon the prophet entitled where I think Pentecost failed and it was preached in 1955 and in a few days we'll be entering in the year of 2025 and we have some of the same things happening that he preached against in 1955 are we no farther up the road Lord help us Jesus Purge us Lord cleanse us oh God Hallelujah Jesus anybody here tonight feel that way Lord search me search me Lord Purge me what do we want in our church friends real gifts or just so-called ones that we can't identify Through The Eyes the only identification they have is through the mouth because the eye says something totally different give me the eye understanding as a matter of fact if you listen carefully to God being misunderstood you'll find God's Prophet speaking to the brothers at the church and said Brothers if you all will trust my understanding of the scriptures I'd like to come down with you that are gifted and show you how it's supposed to be set in order because that's the way Paul did it and that's the way it was done in the New Testament ah so the eyes identified with the foundation stone in the pyramid which means the alpha has become the Omega how many wants it that way can we just bow our heads and now remember we're not seeking after gifts I'm not making an altar called tonight oh how many wants a gift of tongues how many oh yes oh God oh God give me tongues oh God give me interpretation no but we desire I desire them yeah by Desiring that I'm not saying that I desire that I have them I'm saying I desire them in our body God can give it to everyone so God may give it to one of our sisters is that right would you brothers be okay with that the Holy Ghost can follow one of our sisters and give true tongues and fall on another sister interpretation yeah I'm fine with that amen I don't want it just to be on me or just the preacher's family or just me and the deacons and you know the the ones I can control I don't believe it ought to be me controlling them I believe it ought to be the Holy Ghost we desire earnestly the best gifts Lord those that will edify the body and help keep our church clean praise the Lord can we just pray together oh I know this is a solemn time hallelujah hallelujah oh Jesus help us father it's no wonder that your Prophet said that the Pentecostals and the mouth age they had so misused the gifts that he said just the mention of their name and it brought reproach and he said no wonder people didn't want them because of the way that they had misused him and they had made a reproach on it Lord there's people here like myself that saw gifts and if the gift was 100% wrong why nobody would listen to that but if it's hit and missed and hit and missed in the last few years Lord I've heard of one after another after another who went through prayer lines and was told this and that and the other you come up here with this person on your heart and they emphatically denied and said that is not true I did not have that person on my mind at all Lord Jesus help us Lord we don't want no guessing we want real father we want want real tongues real interpretation real wisdom real Discerning of spirits word of knowledge Word of Wisdom oh Jesus let the genuine fall Among Us oh God to keep Word of Life Church clean Lord when we get into it a little bit more and your Prophet crosses the country in the mouth age telling them how they ought to use them and little or none of them hardly any of them paid any attention to him brother Greg Parker told me some time ago about a church that he used to go to a Pentecostal Church in Louisiana that had the gifts that way I was flabbergasted by it by hearing it but they actually had it set up the way the prophet taught it they'd meet and gather and pray had men there Discerning the whole thing I thought my goodness what a rebuke a Pentecostal church that did it that way and message churches ridicule the prophets quotes and make light of his words that he used God forgive them I pray lay it not to their charge father may we judge our church Through The Eyes not through the mou Mouse if we were in the mouse age we would judge it by what the mouse understood and comprehended but we're in the eyes right next to the intelligence how foolish we are to bypass the eyes and go straight to the mouth and consult Pentecostal theologians how they did and what they've done oh Jesus help us father I pray we worship you tonight Lord God we bless your name Lord Jesus can we just lift our hands now in the presence of the king I know you kids got school tomorrow and you got to work tomorrow and you got to go but let's just worship a little bit let the Lord pour a little bit of oil in our wounds you know the word has that about it that it kind of cuts us up but that's all right if I need cutting tonight Lord let me have it I want to be ready father praise the Lord how many will say to me with me tonight as a person who comes here to this assembly let all hell know tonight where you stand how many will say with me by the uplifting of your hand you believe in true gifts you want true gifts in our church that will keep the church clean then don't any of you who stream our services and say we don't believe in gifts you are lying amen and not only will God judge you but we will judge you amen I do believe in them but remember the prophet tells us in the church age book that there will be men appear in the last day who will operate gifts with a margin of error I've seen what the error can do to people I've been dealing with some message people that have come through the margin of error and Gifts things that have been told them that were not true that did not come to pass I've seen the tears I've seen the anxiety and for some it has nearly destroyed them and you mean to tell me that's what gifts do no friends gifts don't cause the confusion it straightens it out God don't send gifts with margins of error you get perfect love first then you'll get perfect gifts so let me tell you this people who are operating gifts and our message that are imperfect they miss the foundation stone it's not so much their gift they don't have perfect love when they need to have it perfect love God's Prophet said produces perfect gifts am amazing grace How Sweet the
