because healing [Music] Carolyn I was talking about it yesterday she said how do people live without the Lord as you know the sad part about it is some of them do and they really don't think they need him I said that you and I ought to be so happy because the truth of it is we couldn't do you realize without the Lord in your life some of you would just take your life you'd end up on pills you'd end up on this that another because you're made to live for God you're made to need him isn't that a blessing you're made to need God you just you can't function without any brother Paul we have to have him in our lives I'm so grateful that it's that way God bless you let's turn tonight to First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. let's go back to the Great Master Builder of the New Testament age First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 11. now Paul is speaking to ministers in these first few verses preachers and is likening them to builders as well but he doesn't call them Master Builders now he's warning preachers and telling them what they must be careful of but don't just focus tonight on the descriptions for preachers only but in one sense it's for all of us As we sing the song I'm working on a building I'm working on a building well everybody here is working on it in some way or another because your life testifies and will reach people and either convince them or make them wonder you know if the truth is really right or not so each of us have something to contribute but here Paul is focusing on the preachers and listen what he says for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man and Paul was really really strange here because he didn't believe women ought to preach so he didn't say any women preachers but he said any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day now listen how he says this for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is notice now if any man's work abide which he has built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire now listen to this what up what a astounding thing Paul separates men's work from their destiny so there will be preachers that will absolutely lose every every work that they have done in the Name of Christ but will be saved themselves oh I guess we better dismiss right now if y'all gonna be this quiet that's what your Bible says if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by far I've made love to be remembered to announce we pray sister Martha sacker has a couple of cousins that are very needy and prayer and she want us to pray over this tonight May preach with him I mean he has a need in your life maybe your body your home your wall Heavenly Father we bow our heads to the dust of the Earth from whence we were taken knowing Lord one day unless the change comes we will go back that way the Lord as I said this afternoon [Music] reading these scriptures and looking at them Father and you heard the cry of my heart dear God I am I never want to be this this scripture I do not want to fulfill this Lord I don't want to be a man that would give years of my life to the cause and then find out that I had built it out of wood hay or stubble I pray father that I wouldn't be the only one in this place tonight but may each of us realize what a a tremendous thing that this is but yet a serious thing as well father you see these needs represented by these handkerchiefs that I have I'm asking you that you would be with the Lord everybody that raised their hand it signified a request a desire would you meet that tonight father I pray for those that are sick could be with us in the service tonight father you see that Scotty had an accident yesterday with a saw and hurt his thumb and Lord real bad pain Eric is still dealing with the shingles we're believing you father for a complete deliverance for her Lord Jesus so many needs and we just thank you that you are God and you take care of all of them bless us tonight fathers we're gathered here in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated let's look in second Corinthians chapter five verse 10. I'm sure you realize already that there's a great difference between the white Throne judgment and what is identified as the bhima b-e-m-a the bema thrawn or the bema Judgment the white Throne will be of course the Book of Revelation and John says I saw the dead most small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books now there it is a judgment of Destiny based upon works but what Paul is going to read or going to tell us here tonight that we'll read you in a minute is not a judgment of Destiny but it is a judgment of rewards by works now we are not saved by works everybody believes that Grace is what he did for us works is what we do back for him and his kingdom but because Works doesn't save us doesn't mean that we don't want to have works we do want to have the right kind of works but we want to make sure that the works that we are doing are based on the word and that we're not basically wasting our time because the setting that Paul lays out for us it's quite phenomenal that someone could labor in the name of Jesus they can actually preach Christ they could preach that he is the messiah the son of God that he raised from the dead that he does wonderful things and yet at the end of the way they will lose every sermon they ever preached every hour that they studied it will be as if though there's no record at all now let me be the first one to say to you tonight I'm not sure how all of this works but I know one thing it ain't going to work for me I'm not going to be that type of a guy now will there be differences of degrees in Heaven There Will Be I don't think there'll be anybody there that will be walking around heaven sad and downcast and a broken attitude and you can tell by looking at that person that they suffered loss and they have no reward I I'll just be the first one to tell you I don't know exactly how it's going to work but I know this is God's word and it has to work right but I do know according to what we've just read there will be people that will suffer a tremendous loss and the Greek word that is used there we'll get to in a bit but it's as if though God it's it's it's that they are punished in a sense with a fine so they are fined because their work was destroyed I said how could that be brother darling it's all because of the material that they use now we may look at him and say oh my this man's a great man always preached for 45 years he done this and that and the other but you see God looks at more than the years that the man may have studied or the years that the man might have been a pastor or a bishop or a teacher or whatever more but God also looks at the motive and the objective while the man is preaching because you see every man that preaches is not preaching for the right reason every man that studies does not study for the right cause now people sometimes don't pick that up sheep are able to hear them and say wow man I already enjoyed that guy boy does really really good but you see God don't just look at his ability to speak but God looks at the man's heart to know why the man is preaching now I know I know it's I just can't even I can't even comprehend this I've got to be honest with you I can't imagine a preacher preaching for any other reason than being because God called him I honestly cannot process that a man would want to be a preacher and want to get up before people and want to study and want to put himself through so much torment in life for Envy or for jealousy of another man well you're looking at me funny but in a few minutes you'll have to say Amen because I'm going to prove that to you from the Bible now watch this in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 10. for we notice now Paul is referring to himself as the rest of the Saints so he's speaking to the Corinthian Saints as well for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ now keep in mind that there's two judgments and there's two judgment seats now the word that he used right here is a different word than the one that was used in the Book of Revelation this one is bhima b-e-m-a it is an elevated place an elevated place that people walk out on so it's not like on a level Plateau but it is an elevated place and people walk out on this elevated position and there they are going to be judged for their works now remember the bride does not go in the Rapture because of works the bride is not bride because of Works she is bride because of election and the church said she is called by God chosen by God there's not one thing she can do to make herself bright and let me go to the other side of that there's not one thing she can ever do to unmake herself bride if she is she is and if she ain't she ain't now that's pretty common you should be able to anybody should be able to understand that but there is a distinction even in the bride when it will come to works now are there people in The Bride that possibly might fit into this category that at the bhima they will be fined they will lose their their reward well you know what I'm no judge that's for God to say but now let's read so for all we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he has done whether it be good or bad now listen carefully so Paul says then that all believers will come before the Lord Jesus in this elevated platform called the B now they are going to be tested to say what type of building material that they used in the house of God now excuse me the object of the test is that our works may be categorized now Paul Dunn said it in First Corinthians here that the day will declare our works so we don't want to just do do just a bunch of stuff for God but we want to make sure that what we're doing will well brother Donnie how can I be sure judge it by the word right now let it pass the test right now and you'll have nothing to worry about then but you see those who shirk the word and they won't let what they feel led to do be judged by the word more than likely they'll suffer loss because you see a real believer is not afraid of the word they're not afraid of the word at all because they know the spirit of God will never leave you or you or me or anyone else to do anything contrary to what his word says and the church says you mean I'm going to live my whole life and I'll get to the end of the way and I'll perish nope not if you don't want to well you say how will I know that I won't suffer loss judge it by the word right now and if you're using hay wood and stubble get rid of it and use building material that will be able to withstand the fire now I want you to notice categorically how that Paul breaks this down and he places Gold Silver and precious gems or Jewels now those are Treasures which most of the time must be mined out of the earth now of course there's been times that somebody would be on out on a Creek Hunting or they'd be doing this as it was in the gold rush in 1849 in Alaska as it was in the Black Hills of South Dakota and different places and they would be in a creek or something like that and they would see a little speck of gold then they would start digging and looking around but for the most part Gold Silver and precious gems have to be mined out of the earth now remember Paul for the over emphasizing this I hope it don't bother you too much that he's pointing this mainly at preachers so there are a category of preachers and they preach stubble sermons they preach would sermons they preach chaff type of sermons so they really don't spend a lot of time mining the refined resources that God's gave them because it just simply takes too much time so they just go out you know what you could be able together stubble and would and hey probably in your backyard you'll be able to go right out there and you'll be able to pick it up it's not very pretty it's not of great resource it has hard and no value at all but if you get gold and silver and precious gems they're going to have to be mined it will take prayer it will take consecration to God it may take steady and nor steady and more study but you know what I've realized is that if you've got lazy Christians sitting in the Pew they really don't like a well-minding preacher because that well-minding preacher wears them out so what they really prefer is a wood preacher or a stubble preacher or a hate preacher because that's all they hear that's all they want to live and they don't want no more well I guess you and him can be burned up together oh my goodness now watch this this is not my saying now I'm reading to you from the Bible right y'all believe this is the Bible so the outcome of this test the owner of the gold the silver and the precious gems that owner will receive a reward but the owner of the wood now this will be in refutable it cannot be questioned because you are standing there every preacher every preacher in the message where it's an evangelist a teacher a pastor claims to be a prophet claims to be an apostle whatever it claims to be his work will be made manifest and the day will declare it so there'll be no way to get away from it it'll not be said well you know what no no no that's not me you've got the wrong guy that that's brother John's work there Lauren I know now I'm Donnie Reagan this is my work right here I will be identified with everything that I do the sermons that I preach the amount of time I put into it I will be I will answer before God I think of preachers really believe this that spend a whole lot more time than to be a whole lot more careful about what they say when they stand up before God's people but somehow we've got it in our mind that as bride we never stand before in this room at all you need to re-read your Bible because Paul is not speaking now to the non-elect or the foolish virgin so notice how that he brings this out and he says the others now what it will be with the wood the hay and the stubble it will be Tried by the fire now of course this is a metaphoric symbol that was used in the Old Testament as well as the new and if yours is the gold the silver and the precious stones then they will abide in the fire so you're not afraid of the fire a real believer they really don't they don't prefer tests over the Mountaintop they like a good Mountaintop experience every now and then but they're not afraid of the valley they're not afraid of the fire because they believe what they have is pure genuine and right and what will the fire do I told you several years ago Carol and I went to South Africa and we went down to a a place that they used to mine gold we went way way down and back into this place and they had a pot of gold out there and they would heat it up I forget how many degrees that it was and they explained it that they'd heeded this same pot of gold over and over and over again and they get it to thousands of degrees as far as to be able to make it where it would become molten and then they would pour it out and the the man explained every time that they heeded this goal to this level it made it that much more pure each time now the first time that you would have put a piece of wood under that fire we know what would have happened two thousand degrees it would have burned up in a matter of minutes and it would have been nothing but ashes well what about hay less than that what about stubble less than that but it would simply refine the goal it would refine the silver so you know there's one thing about many of the gems that are dug up out of the earth now they know there's one very unique one that does not come out of the Earth but it actually comes from a little secreture and it is caused by an irritant that gets inside of its little shell it can be a sand it can be a little Burr it can be many different things it's an oyster you know that and it will start secreting this thing inside of his body to be able to envelop this and make a pearl but do you know that pearls cannot be cut do you know that pearls are not like diamonds they're not like sardonyx they're not like all types topaz and all of that no they're not to be cut they are to be taken in the shape they are and then they will set them according to the shape that they bear I want you to notice I wonder why the Lord God is making the great Gates out of the city that we're going to enter into making them out of pearls and every several gate was a pearl now I read it to you here Sunday that God said blessed are they that obey his Commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life but it didn't get to the last part of that verse that said that they may be able to enter into the gates through the gates what are those Gates Pearl Pearl so the Pearl comes to much testing and much trials so the bride of Christ is not afraid because she does not want to present wood hay stubble vanity vainglory look at me I'm a great big guy I'm this and that and the other that's wood hay and stubble now I want you to notice about these in the category that they're in that the gold the silver and the gems are durable material so the fire does not destroy them they are durable material but look at the other they are perishable material wood hay stubble all perishable I wonder how much time we spend in our lives on things that are absolutely going to be a now they did one of these days you see in other words Paul is setting forth to us that there's two kinds of preachers now mainly whenever he's dealing with this you read it and you'll you'll see where I'm coming from that there are some that are sound they're sounds solid gospel preachers on the word and then there are others they simply are not now will they be saved yes so it shows us then that these men are of a savable substance but they just are not having a wholesome Doctrine some of them probably not even calling the first place but yet he knows to be able to put it forth and what is called the Touchstone how many knows what a touchstone is they would use it for gold for silver uh in order to prove if it was true gold or not so it is a trial it is a touchstone so you're able to check and test now so you won't be disappointed when you stand before him then now all Christianity every Christian every child of God here tonight is going to stand before the Lord at this bema every child of God that's here one to every child of God that's ever lived on the face of the Earth are going to stand before the Lord and we're going to walk up to that elevated place and when we do we want our works to be able to stand how many does with all your heart so the doctrine of Christ and the truth of the Gospel must exceed and in order to for us to be identified with that our works must be able to stand the fire so the test will prove the worse or the worthlessness of every preacher and some preachers will stand there and their Works will be worthless because it was all about them oh they preach Christ they talked about him but in reality it was all about them notice First Corinthians again 3 12. now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble now look with me how that I put this together like this so you'll be able to see it gold silver precious stones permanent beautiful valuable hard to obtain gold silver precious stones permanent beautiful valuable hard to obtain wood hay stubble passing temporary ordinary even ugly cheap easy to obtain and that's the kind of walk many folks want with God they want the easiest way out just show me how close I can walk to the world don't exact no more out of me than what I've got to do and I'll walk the line I'll get as close to the world as I can and still be saved and you'll lose everything you ever do all my you see true ministers that are called of God they have a desire to dig into the scriptures to find those Treasures which are hidden there now my goodness can you imagine if a lot of us had to make our living by going out and digging for gold and silver and gems we wouldn't know where to start we wouldn't know what to look for would we would starve to death in two weeks time we wouldn't know what to do and yet that's exactly the way Paul runs the parallel of God called men that will be able to stand the test of time and the test of the fire at the end time so you can find wood hay stubble just about everywhere and you don't have to mine the stubble you don't have to mine the hay and depending on what wood it is you don't have to necessarily mind the wood but in order to get a quality of gold a quality of silver and of the gems it will take work it will take substantial work and investment in order to reach down in there and be able to bring a nugget out of of God's word and every man of God gets that out in his own way and his own gift and he will polish that thing before the people and my how he takes that and rubs it over and over now some men are called him and they come out my it's like they bring out a whole wheelbarrow load of stuff other brothers they may not be gifted like that but what they bring out it's as polished just as much as the man who brought out a wall a whole wheelbarrow boat but because they've done their very best they did not throw a sermon together they did not just get by on Sunday morning well praise God it's over let's get the tithes and go home shame on any preacher that has that kind of attitude not even fit to pack a Bible lazy preachers and lazy Sunday school teachers will have much to answer for at the bema of God well praise the Lord I guess if some of y'all knew I was preaching this you'd have probably had a headache tonight wouldn't you well my back's hurting me a little bit well it might not been for it come in but it may be the time you leave notice in verse 13 how he says every man's word shall be made manifest for the day notice the word he uses the day the day itself shall prove it you understand the day we're in now in Luther's day Luther's day proved what men were of God and which ones were not now there was some that came out after Luther started the Reformation but they were more of a detriment to the Reformation than they were a help and they actually became part of the cause of the persecution and they brought brought great reproach on the message of that day do you know that that the historians that wrote in the time of the first century uh many of you that remember reading in your Bible when Claudius the emperor of Rome and he abandoned all the Jews out of Rome but yet two of the noted Roman historians say equivalent Priscilla of course were had Roman citizenship and they were forced to leave Rome and no Jews could go back into Rome but it was not just because they were Jews alone but one of the noted historians said that the followers of Christus which is Christ the followers of Christus were so divided and arguing and fussing and debating over which one was right and which one was wrong that Claudius got so sick of it that he banned them and made them leave do you understand that when Paul got ready to go to Rome that some of these wood preachers stubble preachers hey preachers had went in front of Paul and when he got there to Rome he only had a handful of people that even showed up to hear him the church AIDS messenger can you imagine so it was not Claudius that did that it was not later on the different Caesar's Nero in them that did it but it was actually some of the preachers around the message that Jesus was the son of God and they had went in before Paul and poisoned his influence my goodness sakes notice this so he says every man's work shall be made manifest so in other words the real nature of the work either the worse or the worthlessness of each man's work will be made known so some of the builders work well absolutely vanish so you imagine men that will stand there and they've given Decades of their life they think to building on the kingdom of God and they will stand there and their hands will be totally empty they will have nothing nothing because they built it on an Ideal or a theological this and that and the other are an arrogance the reason they preached was to get at another man and they will stand before God with nothing as if though they just got saved Lord Jesus help us Philippians chapter 1 verse 15. some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife so you imagine preachers in the first century and these guys many of them they knew they could lose their head Rome did not know the difference between elect and non-elect but when Romans hear a guy preaching about Christians as far as they was concerned they was all one big group these guys could have got killed for what they were doing and yet Paul said they were preaching Christ for Envy or strife only because they love to argue and they become a preacher they they had to be something missing up here I mean a whole load some indeed preach Christ even of Envy oh my goodness I'll tell you a friend I read this yesterday and it just it just staggered me Sr I thought God how could how could men do this why would they subject themselves that everything that goes with being a preacher and their motive is simply Envy or Strife so the only reason they preach is to argue and debate and fuss or because they're envious of a god call man you see the motives of all preachers are not pure oh my goodness some preach him For the Love of strife others endeavoring to draw people after themself because they look and they're saying wow I wish I was there I wish I was like that I was this then that the other mama can you imagine many of that have preached and cry and cry name will suffer Christ's judgment at the end timer because the Lord Jesus does not just look at a man's ability to preach as I saw a YouTube video of one that used to preach could say great things but someone had sent me a video not long ago of him standing at a bar mixing drinks and alcohol telling people how to serve this type of drink I pray God takes me out of this Earth before I ever bring in reproach on our lord Jesus friends this is serious I found this amazing I want you to notice this quote with me in the influence of another when you're playing a ball game as it's football season I just found that as amazing I thought I wanted a thought brother around him even a new one football season even was up you learned something don't you that is if you can learn something so when you're playing a ball game as it's football season the thing we want to do is not everybody try to take the ball away from the man that's got it now listen it's just simple but spiritual analogy it's trying to guard that man protect him let him get through we're trying to make a goal I want you to notice how the prophet is facing it here so say uh God calls a certain man to say we'll say Paul and Luther and we'll see it and brother Branham and all them great men to do only what they could do and there was countless of men around them that tried to take the ball out of their hands and said you're not good enough to be a prophet you're not smart enough you only got a seventh grade education and you didn't have this and that and the other so what they do they instead of playing guard and trying to guard the man that God called they run over and try to take the ball away from him praise the Lord now don't some of y'all go looking now and getting your mind on the San Francisco 49ers or whoever else you're tonight we're talking about a different ball game so stay here with me notice he said protect him let him get through we're trying notice how he says it he doesn't say this man but we are we're trying to make a goal see because you imagine a t here's our problem so so untrained a team so untrained as to find one man their own man was the ball running to the field goal and then instead of trying to knock the enemy away from him the opposing team to let your own man that's got the ball take off with that every man trying to take the ball out of his hand so we're supposed to be on the same side and God will Elevate whoever he wants to and use whoever he wants to but some people think it's not enough glory for them to be able to be a guard they think it ain't enough Glory because they want to make a touchdown well if you're on the same team and that skinny man makes a touchdown it's still a touchdown before you too because you're on the same side you're on the same team but you know it is everybody wants to be the man in the Limelight everybody wants to be the man with it makes the touchdown oh my goodness can you imagine the prophet of God using such an analogy I'm glad he did I think it's a great analogy myself he said notice what will happen now he said the opposing team to let your own man that's got the ball take off with it every man trying to take the ball out of his hand while you're bound to lose and today we have the same thing when we see God come on the scene going to bless a certain thing let's keep all the enemies away from it let's use our influences as tackles not runners so let me ask every one of your preachers here tonight what are you going to use your influence for you see some preachers can't stand it they have to be a runner but if everybody's a runner who's going to block I don't know too much about sports I never did really get into it that much but I do know enough about it I used to watch it some Manhattan whenever we was kids and we played it a little bit but most of the time I always beat him and Harry was a sore loser my goodness would you stand out in the back and play basketball and we didn't have her in no good ball or no nothing else either we're just taking no rim or whatever and put up there and I'd send us older than Harry I was bigger than him so I just stand there and put it in put it in her and get some Mad Head cry you know that little saintly brother that plays that organ hahaha but you see the prophet in using this you get in your mind and he understands what he's saying so what if everybody on you know whatever it is Tennessee I suppose got a team what's the name of it somebody tell me what volunteers some of you sitting there are sacrilegious as you can be you'd act like you don't want me to know that you know that my goodness why do you think I figured them orange Blazers aren't orange t-shirts and orange ball shoes you all wear it ain't cause you're trying to be an orange tree [Laughter] but can you imagine what everybody would say so you tease it sits right to the final play or whatever it is and the main guy he throws the quarterback Frozen and there's a guy that's a wide receiver and he takes off running down through the or if he gets a touchdown he's going to beat Ole Miss or he's going to beat Alabama or whoever it is and somebody on his own team puts his foot out in front of him and trips him and takes the ball away from him and gives the other side enough time to knock the man down can you imagine what you Tennessee fans would say you wouldn't be booing Alabama you wouldn't be booing Ole Miss or whoever more you'd be looking for that old boy you'd want to give him a piece of your mind and maybe I'm not going to sandwich along with it you'll say what in the world is the matter with you boy he was going right down to there and can't you understand that people will do the same thing in the Church of the Living God and preachers have done this ever since God had preachers and they will do it right on down through time but I say whoever God's give the ball to Let's guard it let's protect it let's get behind what's God's doing God called the little guy from down in Kentucky and the world life got him and made fun of him but I say we give our life for this Lord Jesus and we stand behind this message of Malachi 4. let's guard it from the world let's guard it from the ungodly let's guard it from the evil let's guard it from the wicked Hallelujah will not all be a prophet we'll not all be a pastor but somebody's got a guard oh my let's use our influence as tackles not runners tackles that protects the runner let him pack the ball through because there's no opposition you can see why Satan wants to do this how many preachers down through time they did was Paul when Paul was there they was trying to take the ball away from him don't you understand when Paul was in prison these men were out there the judaizers they were out there preaching and Paul said you've looked at my bonds and he said it was further furthest of the Gospel you know why when Paul was in the Roman prison part of the praetorian Guard got a new birth hallelujah amen that was Paul wrote down the Roman jail but there must have been some seed down there God said Paul of God I had to make it a little bit hard on you for a while but I've got an old boy send a little bible the Romans hat on I've got another old boy sending over there and they're part of the praetorian God but they actually belong in my army they belong as part of my word go down there and get them Paul and what did these guys do they took advantage of Paul being in jail and they went from every Church they could and so Discord why they wanted the ball they want to take it out of Paul's hands let me do it let me do it let me make the let me make the touchdown let me make the Home Run let me do that let me do this do you understand them same men will stand before the Lord Jesus one day and give an account all my I hope they're not lost I don't know only God knows that notice this let him pack the boxer because there's no opposition all you have to do is just keep running we should be tackles in this football game even sisters can be tackles get down on them knees and pray for the men of God on this age you can get out on them knees and call out the names of the men of God and Tackle every discouraging thing that tries to come against them every Spirit of division every Spirit of whatever more that will try to drive the men of God why if Satan cannot get the man himself in sin he'll try to get the man so discouraged you think what's the use even try people are going to do what they want to do anyway you preach wholeness and they live the way they want to live but God still got some men they said I've got this ball and I'm going to make a touchdown because if I can make one as the pastor of your church it will cause the coming of the Lord oh don't sit there look at me funny I'll read it to you here in a minute whenever God's men around the world whether they're evangelists or teachers or pastors if they can bring the bride to that place so where we can make one touchdown after another after another it will cause the rapture I don't blame the devil for trying to stop us oh man listen again he says listen it's like a ball game somebody at a football game somebody gets the ball every one of his own players try and take the ball right away from him you can't win the game be a guard guard the ball not to try to take it away from the next man again he says doors and don't enough you try to take the ball away from your own man you're messing up your team the devil don't have to have to do a whole lot of this stuff to us we do it ourselves guard your man see keep guarding him keep the rest of them so he can make the Run and we'll have the touchdown after a while and Jesus Will Come oh my goodness so when we make the final touchdown Jesus will come I wonder how close we are we made some touchdowns down in Louisiana we'll make some the rest of the year in different meetings and things that are going on I don't think we have to wait for a special meeting I believe we have special meeting right here I don't think wet while our useful go over here and they'll get charged up and revive I think we ought to have enough Revival inside of us well he we could have Revival on Wednesday night and on Sunday morning and when we start church back on Saturday night I ain't waiting until brother Ron's special meeting in September I wait until some other meeting in October I want tonight to be a special meeting I want tonight to be a special service and we'll get behind God's men that's packing the ball and we'll stand right there and say oh no devil you devil of discouragement I want to encourage my pastor I want to encourage the Evangelist I'm going to stand between him I'm discouragement I'm going to stand between him I'm going to pray I'm going to ask God to strengthen it oh my notice this in Philippians 1 16 Paul says the one preached Christ of contention not sincerely it's staggering it's staggering you mean a man would preach Christ but of contention look at this word what it means electioneering or intriguing for office ah so this picture is a politician don't you understand he's a lectioneering so it's like he's running for president we've got some preachers this is about as bad off as our president is now go ahead brother Don I Democrat and Republican song blast both sides everybody that's rotten [Applause] it's bad if when it's in our nation what what's even more sickening is when you see it in the message when you see it among preachers that preachers are like electioneers running for governor or vice president or president well praise the Lord Carol honey we might need to pack our stuff they may vote us out of here for Sunday the one preached Christ of contention electioneering or intriguing for office a desire to put oneself forward so Paul dealt with that in his day yep you know as I begin to read and study this I I said it out yesterday as I sat in our downstairs studying and I said it said it out loud more people ain't changed much have the Lord hear the word two thousand years ago and you got the same thing going on this day we're living in so the one preached Christ of contention not sincerely goodness supposing to add affliction to my bonds so some preachers would preach to make it harder on other preachers they would start a work or a Ministry whatever they wish to call it for the intent and the purpose of making it harder on a successful god-called man huh y'all didn't know this is in your Bible what are they doing lying politicians how can we imagine anyone in the days of Paul that would have done this can you imagine by the gym as I said and read this I thought Lord how is that possible a great anointed servant of God like Paul and they would actually do this to make it harder on him so he's in jail now when he's writing this book of Philippians and they are actually going out from church to church and so on Discord and this and that and the other I'm trying to ruin Paul's influence among the people and the sad part about it is some of the sheep in them day listen to it can you imagine she sat in there that word begotten by Paul's Ministry these men did not have the power of begeto they could not produce new births of all and some of these people Paul birthed him and they walked right away from him by who politicians football players spiritual football players that could stand up and run well look at them muscle man yeah look at them things look at their muscle man alive look at them leg muscles wow look at that physique look at that we should pull that guy I'm telling you what he can throw a ball I'm telling you he can run he can do this but you can't see in his heart in his heart he's got a motive and God's Gonna fire for his work oh mama you see Paul's name was to get people to Jesus and to glorify the kingdom of God but these guys were to get people to follow them they were not sincere and they were doing it for a motive to make it harder on Paul when he got out and they did these men succeeded and when Paul did get out he had to go behind them and straighten up all of this mess that these men had caused wow my goodness so they wanted to make Paul feel helpless he's imprisoned by the John he can't get out he can only send out a letter every now and then it don't hardly have any contacts because a lot of the Roman Christians had left him and would have nothing to do with it but it was under his ministry that they got the Holy Ghost God have mercy Shake us Lord open our eyes oh my goodness notice in verse 17. but the other of love now it said some men preached Christ of contention and all that but the other of love knowing now the men the true men of God this is what they knew knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel what then why don't you listen to this first notwithstanding every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ preached my goodness how could this man say this notice whether in pretense which is a cloak or a show or a pretended cause under color as though they would do something so Paul said even though some of these guys are as false as they can be but I want you to notice the key word here he said they are at least telling somebody that Jesus come so instead of Paul send down a feeling so sorry for yourself pulling on me here I am down in this Romans jail Lord don't you love me no more well what in the world am I doing down here he said glory to God them guys out there blasting me and they're doing this and that and the other but they'll get up there and they may some say something about the Messiah and there's a predestinated seat sitting out there that say Messiah you mean it's already here say no it's already come well glory to God he said Hallelujah I rejoice you're rejoice don't you see he loved Jesus so much Hallelujah he loved Christ Jesus so much that he laid his own personal suffering to the side and said maybe one of them will hear enough about the name of Jesus Christ and it'll draw a seed to God [Applause] notwithstanding in every way whether in pretense or in truth Christ is preached I then do rejoice yay I will rejoice you imagine the people said they're looking at him like y'all look at him he said what what do you mean in my name is he was actually glad they were preaching pretense no he was glad they at least had to mention the name of Jesus some of you started out as a Baptist some of you started out maybe it's the Church of Christ or something else and they had to preach what at least a little bit about Jesus and it woke something inside of you a search that started and it wound up in the revealed word of the hour so Paul said I Rejoice because they're at least telling somebody the Messiah has come Christ has come but can you imagine how these men that did this they will stand before the Lord Jesus and their Works will be totally devoured and annihilated oh my gonna go a little farther First Corinthians again 3 13. Paul let me say this Paul would not allow himself to be vexed by the bitterness of their party Spirit you see it was a party and there's dividing himself that's what it was so that's what we've been dealing with for years and years around the message the two Soul party and the Seven Thunders and the return and all this and that and the other it's a party spirit Spirit of denomination and it divides God's people and it's of the devil but Paul refused to be identified in any of that and become bitter and and but wound up I'll tell one thing I've got this old rotten sorry that he said I ain't doing it glory to God he said to one of them guys to go up and say something about Jesus maybe there'll be a seed sign out there say Jesus what's what's Jesus who's Jesus Paul said I Rejoice I rejoice and at least he's talking about that boy you talking about something if we would get our priorities right instead of feeling so sorry for ourselves well I'll go through this and I'll go through that and I don't understand this but what if God let it happen to you the way that Paul said it has happened to me in defense of the gospel and Paul went on to say some of them had preached Christ's a vanity and of strife but he said others got stirred up because I strolled in jail they're some of them brothers that was called to be preachers and yet they kind of took a back seat and was sitting around but Paul said when they throwed they sold me in jail them brothers got a hold to something and God got a hold of some of the praetorian guards and God also so God will hold to some of his other men because they looked at Paul and said that man of God can be persecuted he can be like that talked about he don't even slow him down he keeps right on preaching right on loving Jesus oh give us more men of God like that that can be hated despised and rejected but they are so in love with Jesus Christ they Rejoice that Christ is preached foreign oh my God you see Paul refers to this about the fire Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is the power of fire to try is symbolized in the Old Testament read with me Isaiah 4 4 when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning fire so fire then is used as a symbol of purging manifesting something I said 24 15. wherefore glorify ye the Lord in the fires even the name of the Lord God of Israel and the owls of the city so God wants us to glorify his name when we are in the fire well come on it's easy to do it when you're on the beach side and everything's cooling you got a big glass of iced tea sitting there by you it's a little bit harder to do and you're out in the middle of the burning fire somebody say Amen I'll tell you one thing we ought to be the copper Christians that we'll say yes Lord I want this scripture to be mine I'm going to glorify you on the fire I'm going to glorify you one or don't feel like it I'm going to glorify when I'm sick I'm going to go find one I'm so weak I can't even hardly raise my hand but I'm going to bless your name anyhow I'm going to praise my way right out of this battle notice Malachi 3 2 but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appears for he is like a Refiner's Fire like Fuller's Soap Matthew 3 12. whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and gather his Sweden to the Garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire so let me move from the preachers now for a moment to move down to every one of you what will your Works be when you stand before the bema of the Lord Jesus now you know already that you are not rewarded for everything you do for yourself boy if we were man alive some of us that have some kind of reward with me wow do you realize what you do for you it's not written in the book of remembrance well I bought myself this and I bought myself that and I did this for me and I did that for me and I did that for me and I did that for me there's no record of that you don't get rewarded for what you do for yourself but what you do for others eternal life is not living for you that's human life which we all have and was all born with that old rotten thing you might as well say man because you're just as rotten as a pile of dirt you stink you're no good you're absolutely lost without God you're a hog and a pig lock until God gets a hold of him then he changes your life and your nature and births in your eternal life which puts another desire in you to live for others and the church said First Peter 1 7 that the trial of your faith being more precious than that of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire that it may be found unto praise and honor and the glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so the finds end will be used to try individuals the fire would be used to try works so the day of the Lord is identified in many places in the old in the New Testament as a bursting light or an illumination of fire now notice in verse 14 Paul says if any man's work abide which he hath built thereon he shall receive a reward now if his preaching and his works and his practice of the way he lived is approved by God then that man will receive a reward to share in the glory of Christ Jesus for eternity is a reward of God's grace so what is it it is Wages as a builder that every true servant of God now remember whether it's a preacher or not every true servant of God will God will pay you and give you of his goodness for your reward remember what the voice said to the prophet a huge portion of Heaven awaits Thee Well it don't await me and it don't await all these other preachers around the message why because I don't have the responsibility he had and neither will I get the rewards that he got now realize there's some around the message that think they're great or more important than brother Branham was and I just pray for the feeble-minded because that's what the Bible says do yeah because they got to be pretty feeble-minded if they think they're called higher than the prophet of God oh yeah they're pretty people I figure notice second Corinthians 1 14. as also you have acknowledged Us in part that we are now notice what you will be to me and what we will be to the prophet and what all of us the conglomeration of the seven Church ages will be to Christ we will be to him what Eve was to her man her Adam the crowning watch this also ye have acknowledged Us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus so the crowning of my Ministry the crowning of every true man of God's ministry will be the people he has helped and benefited the one side he's led to the Lord the prophet said if you lead one person to Christ that name is identified with you throughout all eternity so every sermon that every man of God has preached and it's been word solid word base his motive is right his objective is right God gave it to him God inspired him that yet God will reward that man for studying praying delivering it and so on and then the people will stand there from wherever more and say I was blessed by that I was set free by that I this happened to me that happened to me what is that that's a crowning of that man's Ministry now watch again in Philippians chapter 2 verse 15 that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding Force now right here is where I got the name for our church holding Force the word of life holding Force the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain so now here apollon is putting himself in that same place I don't want to do all this for nothing I don't want to run in vain labor in vain or or children can you imagine the disappointment when people stand there before him and they look around and they think oh I've done this and that and the other and there's no evidence there's no evidence of any of that because their whole basis of their Ministry was because they wanted to preach their daddy said there's going to be a preacher their mama said there's going to be a preacher let me tell you something if God wants you to be a preacher God will call you himself and if God don't call you you ain't got no business getting in the pulpit I'm under myself I've wandered down through times and I'll keep white on wondering how many men are up preaching that ain't even called but God in the first place it's easy to see a lot of them ain't look at how they interpret the word look at the mess of me well Amen brother Donnie go ahead and preach it oh my notice first Thessalonians 2 19. for what is Our Hope or joy oh my goodness or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ and he is coming suppose that's and then the question don't you know what my crown is it's not that I fasted so much and I've done this and that and the other my crown my crowning of my Ministry and the proof that I have not worked in vain is when I turn around and I see you all there you will Crown my Ministry brother random says it that we will be the stars in his crown so it makes me feel real sorry for them who say he's a false prophet because they won't be well there ain't no crowns nor Stars only fire oh that may be a star not in the fire praise the Lord for what is Our Hope For Joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye are not even ye in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ at his coming or not you my crown if we are alive and remain when the Lord comes what will be my crown how many sermons have preached how many churches that I've helped build around the world how many things I've done this and that and the other no you so if there is not one soul that stands with me that has become born again that was delivered from darkness that was set free there's no proof of what I preached that I have to prosely and I've got to pull people from this church and from that one and that one and that because I ain't got no power together Within Me if there ain't nobody standing there with me it don't mean no difference how great you think I've done if there ain't nobody with me my work will be destroyed help me God help us God let me close if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss look at the word here same here receive damage to effect with damage to sustain damage to receive injury so the phrase here literally means he shall be malucted the word is a law term that means he shall be fined he shall suffer detriment Lord have mercy children we don't want to wait to find this out when we stand on the Beamer of God if our motives ain't right or objectives ain't right let's fix them now amen he shall suffer loss Dear God that he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire instead oh Jesus Hallelujah you also said let's not just think about preachers well brother Don you know that was totally for the preachers no it wasn't totally for the preachers it's totally for every one of us we'll get to it Lord willing next time we look at it again but the New Testament speaks over and over and over and over again about Christians and their works not just preachers Christians and their works of what you do for others what you do for the economy of God what you do for the church what you do for your brothers and sisters whatever it is that God has called you to do oh my let's bury it if you want a Heavenly Father I feel the same soberness that I felt this evening when I was set and studying as I set their Lord with my computer in my lap and just this somber awesome presence I feel the same thing right here now Lord Dear God I don't do anything that I do for reward I never have why should I start now I don't do it so that you'll say to me well done Donnie no you know that you know my heart I do it because I love your people the father I won't stand there that day and look and see churches in Uganda and churches in the Philippines and here and there and there around the world in books and seven seal books and so on and so on and so on I want to see people people people's lives have been changed people who are witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus Christ oh yes the books have come the tapes the mp3s all that sort of thing that we've done over the years the church buildings and so on food but Lord God we want to see lives you won't put a crown on a tape you don't put a crown on a book but it'll be on a person oh father I pray you'd help each one of these individuals those also that are streaming Lord may we as the people of God do what you want us to do other some of these sisters maybe tonight to think what in the world could I do I ain't no preacher I ain't no man but they can be able to live their life in such a way that someone can take notice that they're different they don't act like the world they don't look like them they don't dress like them maybe raise a question in their heart where do you go to church what do you all believe how come you dress this way how come you do that then they are a Living Word a living epistle Lord God the teenagers the young men the young women the young marriage help each of us father not to wait until we're in our 40s and 50s Lord I'm so glad I gave you my teams every one of my teen years I was serving you from 18 and on preaching I gave you my 20s I gave you my 30s my 40s my 50s and now in the sixth year of my 60s oh and I don't regret a day of it I don't regret one day that I gave you oh but Jesus help me Lord that my work will not be riddled with fire that I'm not using stubble hey or would help me Lord God to constantly add gold silver precious gems jewels from your word then what will it do Lord it'll bring a gem or a piece of gold or silver from your word your message and then impart that into the lives of these individuals and then they become the jewels themselves as they receive that word so as we feed on that word we receive the word and we become the word so then we become the jewels that Jesus is coming for help us O Lord we love you father how many would say tonight brother Donnell want the Lord to look at what I do I want to make sure it's gold and silver and precious things oh sure you've got to make a living friends God don't get mad at you for buying you know this that another but just moderation moderation is what we want remember God's the one who gives us the ability to make money and do this and that and he's going to make us answer for what we've done with what he's given us don't think that everything that God's given you is yours God's given it to us many times so we could give it to others and give it out to others it's not just for us if the Lord were to call each of us tonight into account and make us answer for what we've done what would be left standing what would pass through his holy fire what would be left standing around you that's how much your houses you land your cars this that and the other I'm talking about what really really would pass the test of the fire that's what you'll take with you oh my how many wants to be remembered God bless your heart brother Daryl let's come pray for us tonight buddy or France as you get older when I was a younger man you know you thought about it but you didn't think about it that much but every day I live Carol and I would be 67 years old here in a few months look at brother Jack Benton Center other sitting here in their 80s close to 90. if the Lord tarries some of you that's standing here tonight in your teams that'll be you in a few years and it'll pass just like that before you know it so don't wait till you get old to

Walgreen and buy him a card and say brother I love you I'm praying for you what are you doing you're trying to guard that Pastor of yours so that evangelist brother of yours between an Old Devil of discouragement that's trying to get him so down and so discouraged each one of us can be able to guard those that are called because when we finally make this final touchdown we're all going home together so don't get in your mind oh brother Daryl or he'll make a touchdown one day boy he'll walk Before the Throne of God he ain't going to walk there by himself if brother Darrell walks up by himself and that's nothing to show or we'll always preaching to oh man do any good it's there ain't people there people that you burst people that saw a living God in you and they become what they saw in you Hallelujah pray for us back to spell our heads Heavenly Father we we bow in your presence Warden such a sovereign word that we've heard this evening father I pray Lord that Our Lives that our efforts Lord would not be in vained that we would run empty Lord but I pray father God may you jealous of your lord find their position Lord what it is that you would want us to do do it to the best of our ability Dear God Lord not for fame not for popularity but that one so could be touched at one life could be changed that one young person could see Jesus the one sick person could see health oh God I pray father forgive us Lord of our shortcomings and our weaknesses Lord is into the image he would be pleased to dwell in Dear God Lord I pray for my brothers and for my sisters tonight Lord for my family and for myself dear God that we would be vessels to so surrender to you dear God that others would see Jesus God it's truly our desire Lord It's never to build a kingdom Lord to build some name dear God I don't care if anyone ever knows Lord that I ever preached that ever traveled I'm not interested in that Lord but that someone could say I saw Jesus granted Lord God I pray we just search Our Lives dear God we'd be willing to give our ship away may your blessings be upon your people tonight dear God to make we take these things Lord and meditate upon them that we could be better servants Lord that we could be better husbands and wives and Sons and Daughters dear God that you would be pleased Lord that you would be pleased with our effort Dear God we commit these things into your hands for your glory Lord thank you for your word Lord thank you for your truth Lord with the ability of the word to still touch our hearts Dear God granted Lord I pray father Lord we thank you for brother Donny Lord for his example father we thank you for his labor of what he's brought before the people Dear God Lord I can stand here myself and say tonight Lord that my life has been touched by Brother Donnie's Ministry Lord and I thank you dear God for such a servant and may your blessings continue to be upon him and his family dear God oh Lord how the enemy would like to take him down but Lord we bind together tonight by faith dear God we ask Lord Jesus May the angels encamp about them Lord raise them up God touch sister Erica Lord sister Alicia Scotty others Lord sometimes dear God we realize that the enemy don't attack us so much as it does or family Lord sometimes it affects us more when it's our family but father I pray tonight in the name of Jesus by the same minority that raised my lord for the grave may it move upon these needs tonight dear God we pray bless you children Lord thank you for your word thank you for all that you've done for us in Jesus name amen and amen Hallelujah thank you Lord God thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you Heavenly Father when our brothers are sitting out these chairs they've submitted a plan for us to be able to set them in such a distance from the altar when I come in here looked at it I said Brothers I don't like where them chairs are I want to move back because I'm on a bigger altar so whenever I feel led in my heart to invite as many as the churches wants to come up to pray we can have plenty of room to pray I know most churches don't even have an altar no more but I believe we need one for those of you that like to just take a walk just move out of your seat come up there ain't room for all of you but for those of you that can't stand up here and stand down the aisle just come up let's just pray let's just have a rededication of searching by the spirit of God now you don't want to just do it alone on yourself but you want him to search you because our hearts unless God's in them they'll never be honest with us they'll be dishonest and they won't be true and they won't want you to see yourself as you are but as Jeremiah said who can know the heart the heart can be such a deceitful thing but may the spirit of God come and I don't have a problem with them beginning with me let him look at me let him look in the storerooms of my heart let him look at the building material that I have in me let him look at the implements that I use for his service let him look at motive objective attitude check me see if there's any Envy am I jealous of anybody do I have any Strife toward my heart and anybody did I build this church out of envy God knows me and those of you if you knew me very well you'd know I hate change I hate change and I sure hate major change if it's been left up to me we'd have never never dug the first shovel of dirt where we are but I felt like we needed to make a move and we needed to have a bigger place for more convenience for our people and that's why I did it don't you don't you know and understand that God's men have always been men who were providers for their people brother Raymond Owensboro in 1956 Senator preaching to a church and they built built a church there and brother man compliments the pastor and he said this brother he said look at your what he's done with the money and he said a brother this took taking the money that you've give and built a nice place for you to worship and brother Adam brags and brags oh I've got blasted for years and years by all these filthy rich preachers around the message because I've taken ties and built churches around the world of course they wanted me to do what they've done with their ties buy stocks and Exxon and BP my stocks are on the other side so when the stock market crashes it don't affect my investments I could have been a millionaire friends many times over many times over but why in the world what I want to do such a foolish thing is that Hallelujah may God search our hearts are you willing are you scared or are you willing will you give him the key to every door in your heart and say Lord just come right on in I ain't got no closets nowhere I ain't got nothing hid right here's the key ring to every room I've got in my heart you can have my wallet you can have my heart you can have my house you can have the keys to my car you can have everything my motives my objectives everything about me search me Lord I do not want to fulfill what I heard our pastor preached tonight I do not want to stand there that day at the bema of Christ Jesus and everything burn around me and I'll be saved but I'll walk in with no reward at all Dear God let's pray together can we just for each other for our family for our our church family father I know this is such a different service than we had here last Wednesday night the testimonies of the use that then Lord you come down in the prayer line and oh Father you healed am I you delivered folks that was having all kinds of issues but I believe you've got another thought of Deliverance here now Lord maybe not a back pain maybe not a pain in their foot to here or there but maybe they need to go through the storage room or their life and maybe they need to look at some motives and objectives and realize oh yeah they'd give this for God and that for God but really they could do more Lord look at me search me father you see them I'm getting up in years now and I I realize I I won't have the strength that I had when I was a young man but God can I do more can I give more I don't want to be a preacher Lord that I just I just give a little bit because I use my age as an excuse I'll give you every bit that I have you know I've never held back one time whether I've preached to 10 or 20 or thousands I've preached to thousands in one setting and Lord I preach the same whether it's a handful or a multitude Lord begin with me would you look at me search me then father I ask you to go down to each individual you're tonight every man woman boy and girl and don't stop here go over the internet go out through the father maybe preachers sitting there in their home not having a Wednesday night service tears running out of their eyes and they're saying the same thing search me Lord God maybe others are archived from Holland and from Norway and from Iceland and Greenland and wherever around the world that they do father God in the name of Jesus May you search all of us Lord we don't want our works to be destroyed and burned father but we want to be able to present to you something a testimony that we lived on the earth and that we served your purpose father in the name of Jesus I pray for the Youth here father that you would help them Lord God may they sing Lord help them to realize let a little group of them get together and go and take a guitar and visit some of the homebound Lord we've got several on the screen out there that cannot come to church and they they put it up on the screen remember sister so and so remember brother so and so maybe they can go a few of the time and sing them some songs take them apart just do a little something to reach out to them to let them know they're not forgotten that we love them oh Lord there's something we can all do but the sad truth about it is so many of us wants to pack the ball we want our name and the lights we want to stand before the camera and let everybody know what we've done oh Lord God I don't have to be that person you know me well enough to know if I could and I'd get away with it tonight if you'd let me I'd step from behind this pulpit and turn this church over to another man and I'd retire and I'd step back and be able to enjoy the rest of my life I don't have to be on the Limelight I don't even want to be I wish nobody even knew me but Lord God what can I do if that's what you've called me to be then give me courage Lord give me strength I pray father to stand and fight Lord if you call me to pack the ball help me to pack it Lord God I'll go through the defense Lord there may be great big guy standing in there that's way bigger than I am oh I know some of them great old big giants that will face the Lord they'll be so big and they'll look overwhelming but by the grace of God we'll be like that little Mexican woman down there we'll go over the top of them we'll go between their legs we'll jump over and we'll do whatever say we've got to do because our baby has a need Lord God our desire is to serve your father Lord I want to please you Hallelujah if it gets so old to keep preached Lord God then they may roll me out here at least let me scream and holler Hallelujah let me say praise the Lord let me say glory to God father I pray you would help us tonight to have a greater determination and a greater desire than we've ever had in our life father I believe there's a reason for us to be relocated here and there may be people that will come in I know there's already been lots and lots of visitors and Lord there may be 500 come through but their mom may wind up being one that's got a seed it's been wandering around out here in drunken parties and this and that and the other and you had us to do all of this work and all of this building for one seed of God and when that one comes in we might go home in the Rapture it would be worse all that we've done father no doubt the last seeds that are brought in will be some of the most expensive seeds that have ever been brought Lord God paying internet bills and all this stuff to be able to reach it around the world it will be the most expensive seed but when we consider that one's soul is worth millions of Worlds oh hallelujah how how great expense could we put out for one of your children father then when the last one comes in it may be an evangelist on the field it may be a pastor in his church and he preaches a little simple sermon and he makes an older call and the last one comes in and the pastor will take up the football and cross the finish line and there it'll be the last one that will make it then all of us will get to go home we won't be mad because we didn't win the last one I don't care if I win them or not Lord I don't care who wins them just as long as they're one amen we don't have to be the one that does it Lord Jesus we're just glad to be a part of your great work Gloria we worship you tonight father oh Hallelujah can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord we all know raising our hands is a universal sign of surrender it means we lay down our Armament we lay down our weapons let's lay down our weapons out against the devil of course but are fighting and our warring against God against God and His call for whatever he's called us to be and say Lord what can I do what can I do Lord help me help me not to take the ball from those who have it help me father to guard help me to stand right there help me to pray for every evangelist ever Pastor every God called man oh Grant
