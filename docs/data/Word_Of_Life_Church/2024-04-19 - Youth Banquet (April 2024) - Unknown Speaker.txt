========================================

[Music] please have your seats we're about ready to begin [Music] sister Khloe Hara has put this skit together for all of you and she has done a wonderful job we hope you enjoy it I have seen pieces of it and I think you will really really be inspired by what you see remember these are uh you know these are not professional actors though might be a few mistakes so we hope that you have Grace for them and uh and really really touched my heart when I saw them practice it has been a long time since we've done anything having to do with a skit with our little assembly and and it's just so nice to see them participate for for your benefit so please go ahead and like I said move your seats so you can get a good chair I don't want you to be obstructed by any of the table candles and we'll be starting shortly this kid is named Just As You Are thank you we find ourselves in Great king Tim's throne room on the seventh day of the great banquet the King has just sent for his Queen vashi so that all may observe how fair she is as you guys know my kingdom Reigns from Ethiopia to India and you know I have to deal with the Phoenicians the Egyptians and everything it's kind of crazy but these new AG westerners these benites these Spencer ites and don't even get me started on these raganit that I have to deal with okay oh look here comes one now your majesty what's going on what's up I come from the queen vashi my king the queen has refused to attend your Royal Bank banquet tonight what her exact words were tell the king that I am much too busy and have much better things to do with my precious time than to attend his stupid banquet yikes that's rough are you just going to take that that is so disrespectful that woman needs to be put in her place man if the queen can treat the king like this my wife's going to stop doing the dishes and start to think she can boss me around this is outrageous who does she think she is all I want for her to do is spend time with me but she can't even do that your majesty it sounds to me like you got yourself a queen who has a feminine Spirit on her that is not going to go over well in your kingdom it's going to spread like wildfire I agree Tim you need to find yourself a new wife one that is worthy to be called your bride not someone who thinks she is higher than you but someone who will rule by your side you know what you make a good point let's have a meeting with her tomorrow tomorrow so we can send her away and then ha guy we'll get all the young eligible maintenance in the land and find one among them to replace [Applause] her okay look don't look too intimidating I know that's really easy for you John Michael but Josiah let's just come it down let's make this as easy as possible for her oh my goodness here here comes the Moose now yeah go ahead I don't understand so what if I didn't come I do so much for you I've redecorated the entire Palace I've gotten you a whole new wardrobe so you can be a stylish King I even got you this poodle hey bud I did not want that okay anything I could ever want is at my disposal I'm the king I can set my fingers and I can have it and don't even get me started on this Ukrainian looking poodle okay everything that you've bought me has been with my own money so the one thing that you could have given me that you didn't was your love and your time but you're too busy you're too busy being a vain Queen and not setting an example so how about you do this take Mr poodle and get out of my face that is a Miss poodle to you I believe oh my goodness gracious now the king dismissed vashi and sent out letters to all the princes of the land stating that the single ladies were to present themselves as candidates to be the next Queen all right waiting on one more oh There She is welcome ladies I am hay I the messenger from the King and today I'm going to be preparing teaching you to prepare yourself for the king so one of the things that you need to know about King Tim is he loves Simplicity it's his favorite thing in the world he also loves music and his favorite color is blue have y'all heard a word I've said this whole time oh are you talking okay so I can tell there's only one person listening to me and that's Esther over there she's already even got the color blue on even before I even said anything she's taking down notes heeding my words and she's going to do very well for the king he's very particular and he is not going to take another vashy are you kidding me with this guy he acts like he knows it all like he's some important Angel Sent From Heaven I mean really does he think I need help pleasing the king look at me I'm literally perfect I know right who doesn't want to be like our girl vashy she be out there living her life not listen into nobody honestly I think the king just wanted someone younger and like with better hair what if her bow talk stopped working bless her heart I feel so bad for her but honestly it's great for us right I mean it just feels right it's almost like I was created for such a time as this I know I have spent my entire life training for this moment right here ever since I was a little girl my mother always knew something like this was going to happen for me I think I know what I'm doing more than hey gu does but I cannot say the same thing about Esther though look at her she's literally taking notes what a nerd she's so quiet and compliant I'm sorry is this a safe space okay good because I just can't see how her and those horrible split ends that I can see all the way from here are not GNA please the king I just someone had to say it okay I think someone needs to say this about you four talking this badly about Esther so like you said this is a safe space you for put the fool in foolish virgin that's all I'm saying so I will give you one more opportunity to have a chance with the King and if you don't heed my words the rest is in your hands so you're going to each need to come up with a talent or a gift to theing gifts a talent or a king or oh my word if you were like Esther you would have known that I said you'd like to do something involving music because that's what the king loves that's all I'm saying I am the most fit girl there is I just hit my PR with 500 plates yeah I know and I am going to beat his strongest man in arm wrestling like easy peasy lemon squeezy well I am an artist at heart and I'm going to paint the king the most beautiful painting he has ever seen and guess what the painting is going to be me because there's truly no one more beautiful than I well I need to spill some tea on her Queen bashy I mean I love her but I heard she didn't want to entertain for the king he needs to look no further because I'm basically viral on the gram for my acting skills I have like a thousand followers I know I'm waiting for that blue sh any day now I am so going to follow you well I think I'm just going to bake the king a cake way to a man's heart for sure like not to brag or anything but not only am I the best baker in the land I'm also the most beautiful the most kind the most thoughtful the most humble Baker in all of the land girls did you not hear what hey guys said no what did you he said King wanted Simplicity that he enjoyed music I'm telling you that guy hey guy guy whatever does not know what he's talking about hagy was appointed by the king to instruct us to make us look and act like a bride that the king desires he has been in the presence of the king and he knows what the king likes because the king told him how could you know better than the appointed one of the king Esther you are thinking like so deep into this we clearly know what we're doing you do you though and good luck with that you'll need it for the next months the girls perfected their many talents and gifts and spent many many many hours PR pampering themselves making sure that they would look good for the king each one thought that they knew best how to please the king Esther however listened to hegi and did only what he told her to do soon enough the day to meet the king would arrive I just love mirrors don't you they just make them so beautiful these days I bet it's because we're all standing in front of them I'm just not sure how the king is going to pick one of us I'm kind of hoping he's like King Solomon and he wants a thousand wives we can be like sisters well this dress 10,000 shekels this necklace I'm not going to tell you you would be jealous I actually am kind of jealous but my hair I have spent so much time on this hair I can tell I know speaking of hair let me just say I really hope the king is blonde I just love of blondes oh my gosh jump scare is that dry shampoo she didn't get her hair done Esther is that really what you're going to wear to try and please the king where'd you get that dress peasants are us yeah you're never going to please them wearing that seriously it's like you don't even want to be Queen honestly that dress is so mid I have to look away you're hurting my eyes don't you have any RZ Esther you have spent so much time you have wasted so much time listening to ha guy now you like look so plain you fit right in with the servants yeah like bring me my soup now I trust him suit yourself ladies it's [Music] time oh great king Tim I come before you humbly with five maidens of the land

[Applause] am Esther was become a bride so she didn't want know the adorning of the world she wanted to go in through the king just like she was she adorned herself like the Pentecostal women ought to with a Meek humble spirit and when all these fancy first ladies come by with all their new Fang dangle things the looked at him and put him in the chamber with the concubines but when this Esther come into His sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's her go get the crown and put it on her head that's it let them Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit not only the women but the man too Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit then you're becoming ready for the the the bright sweet Reverend Esther made her heart clean [Music] thank you all for your attentiveness as our young couples performed just as you are that encapsulates the crowning of Queen Queen Esther Our Hope for this skit this play was that you bring it brings to remembrance that when he chose you you know we we watched the actors portray those that would be Queen they brought all their abilities all their works the things that they felt like they could do themselves that they would give God and they would give to the king and their abilities would make make the king a better King remember he gave them a year to prepare and in the preparation they were supposed to prepare for this day when they was to meet the king and bring themselves before the king but during that whole time they were supposed to be listening to what Hagi was telling them this is what the king designed IR s this is what the king wants and we know what the king wanted was Esther brought nothing that's what the king wanted from Esther nothing as we heard Hagi speak to us this week when he said what you can bring to God is nothing tonight hay will speak to you again hay will tell tell you what you need to bring to the king and he I will again tell you tonight come as you are don't bring anything you've got nothing in your life that would make him a better God you have nothing to offer him that would make you a better Esther so tonight if we would heed what Hagi told him understand what God's desires are for you God's desires for you is fellowship God's desire for you is to Crown you God God wants you to bring nothing and God wants to give you everything because he already has everything so we hope that the skit that you heard tonight will bring to remembrance God wants you just as you are it ain't your abilities it's not how good a Christian you could try to be you let God live through you you let the King live through you that's what he wants so we hope you were blessed by that we hope the rest of the evening blesses you and we we thank you very much for for coming and

introduce our speaker and uh and just know that that we love you with all of our hearts and I pray that the atmosphere so fills your heart tonight that you uh leave this place being blessed it's certainly been our privilege to be able to host this time um we're so grateful for those of you that have come and be sure when you go back home to express our appreciation to your pastor and church family for um being able to allow you to come we're so grateful for that as a pastor you kind of guard your sheep and watch them as far as where they go and all that so we count it an honor that your pastors would feel like that you could come and spend this time with us and feel like you wouldn't be hurt or you know anything like that my mind as I look at this occasion tonight and I hope with all of my heart that there will be none of us missing at the great King's banquet but that's the most important thing in our life every young person here tonight that was allowed to be here and participate in this had to be registered your name had to be there your pastor's name and all the different information that you gave even so for the marriage supper of the Lamb people can't just come because they want to but you have to be invited and then you respond to that invitation we're grateful for all the preparation thank the Lord for all those that waited on you tonight and um many of the sisters have been working working all this decoration and all the things that they've done we so appreciate them for doing that we're really privileged to have brother Andrew Spencer going to come and speak for us now I want to just open our hearts and see what the Lord has I'm sure you have needs in your life life you have a need you just want to raise your hand to the Lord that he'll just take our brother and remember that a gift in a man's life is there to help him get out of the way but you can pull on that gift and God can be able to minister to you through that gift a banquet is a different type setting than church but we know that it can also be a place by which great wonderful things can happen and I find it amazing that when we go we find fin make the Rapture and we go into the presence of God and we are there and that table is set thousands of miles long and the great king will come out and he'll walk by each of your chairs and you will finally have your opportunity to look at Jesus in the face most of us probably is going to be crying he will reach down and grab a hold of His Garment and pull it up and rub the tears from your eyes we're here tonight that we might have a little more preparation for that moment I've served him since I was a 12 year old boy I'll be 68 in a month in a few months been preaching since I was 18 and sometimes I don't feel like I know much of anything about him because he's so great and so wonderful we certainly don't want to be like the skit portrayed it that we don't think we need the advice of those men that God has called do we we want to take heed and we want to listen to it so we'll invite brother Andrew if you'll just come and you open your heart to the Lord and we just so appreciate you coming so very much man God bless you this evening I trust you all have enjoyed yourself here amen this has certainly been one of the grandest times of of our life sitting here around this table it it reminds us that this is this is just a preview of what we're getting ready to we're getting ready to see this is just maybe a little foretaste of of what heaven has in store for each and every one of us and I tell you we're just a we're a blessed people and uh we want to thank Word of Life Church here for allowing all of these young people to come and be a part of these this moment and time and y'all don't tell any anybody but I tell you don't tell anybody else I said this but this is the nicest banquet I've ever been to and uh it's uh it's quite well done and I I I know that you understand that so before we just kind of get to our thought here tonight and look over some things that the Lord has placed on our heart for this evening I wonder how many would have a need tonight that you'd like to just maybe lift up your hand and amen our Lord can come in every single setting many times you've met him in your car many times you've met him at at church and different places this might be just a little bit different setting here tonight but our Lord is wanting to come and speak to you because he's placed it on these brothers hearts and then he put a man here behind the pulpit to say something to you so we recognize that your need can already be met here just now so let's just take one another by the hand if it doesn't make you feel awkward anden may we just talk to the Lord just now Heavenly Father we come before you Lord in this time lord it's our privilege Lord Jesus Lord to sit around this table with brothers and sisters Lord that we believe that we're going to spend the rest of our life with Lord eternity will only tell father who is sitting right beside us what it meant for us to go through a journey with them knowing father Lord Jesus that you set up these things in our mind Lord you set up these things Lord that we're just thinking about how we're going to do our hair and how what kind of dress that we're going to wear but father before time you saw each and every one of us sitting at our table Lord but God I'm so thankful to know that there has been a reservation father for every one of your children Lord to sit around the banqueting table father and I pray Lord tonight that you would just begin to speak to your children Lord you see their needs you see their hearts and I pray that this service tonight will be a blessing to them in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen and now I know that many of you don't have your Bibles but I I would like for you to stand with me just to honor the word of the Lord as we just take a little thought here this evening the Bible says here in Esther chapter 2 after these things when the wrath of King aerus was appeased he remember vasy and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king's servant that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins under the Shuan and the palace under the house of the women under the custody of hegi the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things of purif ification be given them let the hidden or let the maiden which pleaseth the king be Queen instead of aasta and the king and the thing pleased the king and he did so also the Bible says here in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5 wherefore when he cometh into this world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast prepared me you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord I would like to take a thought here this evening on something that the Lord's been dealing with me on for quite some time about these meetings I would like to take a thought here tonight on destined for the crown destined for the crown and brother brandham said in the Ephesian Church age he said the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is liken to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect and what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all her works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one a it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God has spoken it just to kind of place it in view as it's been done so wonderfully here tonight this skit that was put on we recognized just to set a a a basis here for this thought here tonight we recognize that the king had made a feast just like this one the king had showed all of his riches for many many days unto the Kings and the princes of the land and there were special Arrangements that was made and then the king called for a feast of all the people of the land and there all the accommodations that were made and set and all the things were made for the vast crowd that was going to come we're sitting here I understand that it's about 190 to close to 200 young people sitting here but in that time when King aerus was sitting in his condition or in his place of position he was sitting there and it is told in history that Persian kings when they would when they would hold a feast of this matter it would hold anywhere from 15,000 to 18,000 people at one time no and and it would be held in the garden because there would be huge amounts of people and all the accommodations were made and all of the things were made according to the things of how the king liked it exactly to the way the king stated in his decrees and how he wanted things and when the people would come in they would sit there and they would sit around and they would be dazzled by The Columns of marble they would look at the King's favorite colors of blue green and white of tapestries that would hold hold the curtains and things and they would be sitting in a place or a condition and all of it was to match the king's kingship all of it was in place there was anything there was nothing that was lacking kind of like what we see here tonight the couches that were laid out for men to rest upon they were made of gold these these people that were sitting there that were from the different provinces they were taking of the best of the best of the wine that the king had stored up only for himself but the king did not hold any of the stimulation back he gave it to the people according to his will and we recognize that on the seventh day is when he made a call for the queen and then vasty did not come unto the king but we recognize that there was a call for somebody to come and to take the crown somebody to step into the place now the Bible said in Proverbs 31 and10 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband do safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life now I know that many of you sitting here from all the way from 15 years old and upwards but one of the greatest treasures that you can have in life that you'll find is a helpmate and any man that has been married for quite some time he knows the difference between a good wife and the opposite but one of the greatest things that God can give you is a lovely wife or a helpmate or somebody that is faithful somebody that is true somebody that is honest somebody that's that is Honorable that is trustworthy and somebody that that has a love towards you no matter whether it's male or female that their love it it passes Beyond barriers it looks beyond faults that her love knows no distance her love knows no bounds her love is patient her love is kind her love is passionate she is a woman if you if you are really seeking for a woman or a man you are wanting somebody that fears the Lord somebody that's got the kind of love that ask actually has the attributes of almighty God God that has been deposited in that other vessel that you're looking for that other one that that woman that he is looking for will have the kind of words like Ruth would say unto Naomi when orpa would kiss her on the cheeks and turn back to the back to the moabitas gods she Ruth would look onto her Naomi and said andreat me not to turn away as well for where you go I will go where you Lodge I will Lodge your people will be my people where you live I will live where you die I will die where you're buried that's where I'll be buried at and that's the kind of love that God is wanting to find in somebody that is that is fit to wear the crown in his position and in his place that he has set aside and we recognize that all the way back as you look and you look at the drama of God's of God's Great drama that he laid out for us we read it in the word that God had longed for a helpmate God had longed for a counterpart that we see all the way there in the garden of the Eden that God seen Adam that he was in a place where Adam had all the animals he had everything that could accommodate him in the natural but yet there was something on the inside of Adam that was lacking and it was something on Adam that he was he was lonely for a helpmate so God caused a deep sleep to come upon Adam and there out of the sight of Adam God pulled a very part of himself out and he brought forth Eve which Adam would call a woman for she is bone of my bone and she is Flesh of My Flesh and ever since the Garden of Eden when do you watch how that she walked out how that Adam and Eve walked and they broke the trust that God had imparted unto them almighty God has been waiting for centuries he's been building a church that he could have that Holy Union with again somebody that would love him in sickness or in health in Pros in prosperity and in good times and in bad times God has been longing for somebody that he could have fellowship with somebody that would not be deceived by the things of the world somebody that would would fully give over to his complete power brother Brandon would say it like this in a church age book he said now Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride he said just as the saint as men choose their Brides today he said the bride today does not simply decide she's going to take a certain man for a husband no sir he said it's the groom who decides and chooses a certain woman for his bride for we know that the Bible said that you didn't choose me you've not chosen me but I have chosen you and brother Ram goes on to say he said the heart purpose of God the heart purpose and the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing he did not Choose You because of who you are or your last name he did not Choose You Because of You Came because of a out of a certain church or out of a certain group he chose you because you were in his mind before the foundation of the world and that is exactly what the message of the hour has done for you in this hour it has taken you and it has placed you in a position that God has been longing for for 6,000 years that we know of in time that God has been longing for a place that there is a place beside our King that is want that he's wanting to be filled and that's exactly what the message of the hour has done for you it has bled you back into a spot that we recognize that we are not a broken bride but we are a restored bride a woman that has knows Fellowship by relationship by predestination a woman that understands the assembling of herself together by The Fellowship of the word of God this God that chose you thought of you before you were ever born here and before you ever fail and before you ever had mistakes this God chose you he elected you you had certain places that you were destined to set here tonight and maybe you didn't get to choose exactly where you or who you wanted to set beside but there was somebody that picked out a spot for you aren't you thankful that you didn't have to pick out your own spot in God's mind that almighty God already picked out a spot for you because if you would have picked your own spot you'd have been out in misery already you'd have already been in TMO but almighty God picked a spot for you and to know this tonight that your circumstances of Life do not change your calling no matter where you are no matter where you came from it does not change your calling remember before Esther was ever to be putting on the crown she was an orphan but when by the end of Esther's story she is not going to be known as an orphan no longer she's going to be known as a queen and when God gets done with you you might have mistakes upon your life you might have troubles upon your life but your story is not going to be troubles your story is not going to be the stories that were written in Le osia but your story is going to be known as the title as Miss Jesus Christ a lady that was so destined to look the part to dress apart somebody that would be fitting to the kingdom when you go to studying out Esther's name her name means star somebody that would rise somebody that that's what we see is a star that would rise and that's what we watched in this generation when God would take a star in this generation and hold it in his hands he was waiting for a certain time to release the seventh star in this generation because he has a certain time that he's going to release release a star because he knows he knows that that star is going to call and it's going to attract a certain people and when he allowed Esther to rise in her position it was only for King Xerxes or aerus that he was going she was fit for him she was destined to match up with his kingship and when God allowed William Bram the Seven Star to be released in this generation he recognized he recognized that it was going to attract a certain people that way have the characteristics that would be called and chosen in this generation that would match him for this hour because he he could not release Luther star in this generation because it wouldn't match your testimony he couldn't lose Wesley star in this generation because it wouldn't match your testimony but the morning star and the evening star are only reflecting of a greater light and we recognize by the message that the same star that rises in the morning is the same star that we see in the evening it's just rolled itself around so it's a sign unto us that there is going to be an alpha bride and there is an Omega bride that will stand in this generation and we recognize that you didn't get here on your own course you didn't choose your own way there was somebody that led you there was somebody that called you there was somebody that destined before you something there's a course that is set before you you may have picked out your career you may have picked out certain things of your life but we know that the Bible tells us or Jesus tells us that the that God that he would be a God he would be he would be the spirit of Truth and he would be our comforter and he would lead us he would guide us so no matter what or where you come from your circumstances of Life he's always been there all the days of your life watching over you one of my favorite quotes that William Brandon makes a statement t i I believe that I believe that it's probably even some of yours that if you've studied the message he says in the God who is rich in Mercy he said now many of you can fellowship with me on this thought he said because he said when you was a child he said there was something he said he said there was something there he said it didn't he said maybe it didn't bother maybe this one or that one he said but something on the inside of you it cried out he said it was that little germ of life right there and then it was something on the inside of you that maybe maybe you didn't know maybe you didn't know what was calling you maybe you didn't know why you didn't go and try to build up certain characteristics of working out your arm so that you could arm wrestler The King's chamber it maybe it wasn't certain things that maybe you built up in your life but there was something there that the rest of the world didn't know but there was something there that was keeping you all the days of your life when the rest of the world could go out and be a part of the enticement and spirits of the generation you couldn't go after them things because there was a greater calling on your life and when other people would pick it up you would put it down and the reason of this is because you're not a vasy I want to say this to you tonight vasy will never be an Esther but Esther will never be a vasty there will be a lot of people that think they're called to this wedding supper but there's only only one generation there's only one person that is set there that is set for that por that portion of scripture that is laying there the Bible said in Proverbs 12:4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh the shamed is his rottenness in his bones so I know which one you would choose is that right I know that probably none of y'all have this on your mind you're probably not here to think about you're probably only here for the word you probably didn't come here to meet a significant other I'm not as dumb as I think as I look I but there's something I know but there's something on the inside of you that that maybe when you when you found that want that it begin to it begin to Sparkle a little something in your eye brother brandom would talk about Esther how that how that she'd walked out how that her beautiful hair and he said her eyes he would talk about Eve and he would talk about how that her how that her eyes were as beautiful as the sky and any of you that have found that significant one you know what it it's a good pickup line if you don't know it your daddy must be a thief cuz he stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes but the first thing let me move let me move I didn't come here for pickup lines but see me after church you're the only 10 I see so but if you're going but if you found that one the first one the first thing brother Brandon would tell us the first thing that comes is a decision the next is the engagement then the promise and then the ceremony he goes he says this he says she takes the bridegroom's name and when the church has the ceremony and makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom's name that she's no longer a church of the world she is the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ he said not by name he said but by birth by Nature power of God revealed to the church in her in the heart she becomes a a Christian church and we recognize that there has been a preview in the bride when all the other maidens would come before him but when it became Esther's turn she didn't want the things of the world she wanted only what the king desired and I believe that that's every call and every Christian's heart that's only the thing that we want we don't want the things of Le osia we only want what pleases him if it doesn't please him I don't want it if it doesn't please him I don't want to be a part of it if it doesn't if it doesn't attract his attention we shouldn't be a part of it because God does not count how beautiful we are in the natural God counts something way deeper than things on the outside of the appearance God sits and looks for something that of character he don't count how many people are here he is looking for character something that will last when the rest of the world has passed away it's something that he saw in you before the foundation of the world and everything that you touch seems as Esther would make her way into the kingdom everything that she touched was blessed and when the king's keeper saw her he knew that there was something different about her she didn't look like vasty she didn't act like vasty and when hegy ey saw her how that she handled herself according to Malachi for's word he be to watch her and he was in intent on her success he was going to make sure he was going to make sure that the methodists in the Church of Christ did not get in front of her he was intent on her success to make sure that he whispered every secret that he knew about the king everything that elaser knew about Isaac he was beginning to tell to Rebecca and tell her this is what the king likes he likes it just like this he wants you dress like this he wants you to be robed exactly like this let me say this to you Esther submitted herself to Malachi 4's teaching she didn't pay attention to what the world said but she paid attention to what the king's Chamberlain had in mind and I believe that is a testament to who you are tonight the way that you showed up here brothers and the way that you showed up here sisters it shows in your character that you have been paying attention to HEI that there's something about you that maybe you don't even recognize about yourself just now but there's something about you that you wanted to look the part even when you didn't feel the part Hallelujah you're not just another one of the girls because you're not just destined to walk past him one time you're destined to spend eternity with him you're not just destined to come and entertain him and please him every once in a while but you're destined for the crown because he trusts your judgment because there are certain things that he did not accomplish here while he was here on Earth so he said greater things than this shall you do because I go unto my father and I will receive you unto myself so there is a work for you so he trust you and I think it's very powerful that our Lord Jesus Christ has entrusted some of the greatest youth there is on the face of the Earth he's entrusted you with his very own life he's entrusted you with his word he's entrusted you so that you'll not just display himself just at church services but you'll display him when you walk through the mall you'll display him when you go to school he has saw something about you that maybe your parents have haven't even seen in you yet but he has entrusted you with the message of the hour so that you'll carry it out according to his Commission because we know that the modern Church in its condition can never carry out its commission but it's going to be an elected lady somebody that's chosen for it somebody that's called for it you didn't put yourself here it was just a call that went out you didn't put yourself in the picture but because you were a Virgin by the blood of Jesus Christ he drawed You by his power he draw you into the kingdom to match his kingship she was a woman of character that would do only as the king pleases as you seen the other girls they wanted to dress himself the other girls wanted to paint themselves up but this lady wanted to dress herself under the Robes of Ephesian 4 she wanted to dress herself under Apostles and Prophets and teachers and pastors she wanted to dress herself according to the scripture because she had heard that she was a king that had liked certain things and when she went in before the king don't dress me the way I want to dress don't let me D be dressed with my attitude don't let me be dressed in my own righteousness don't let me be dressed with what I think the message is but let me be dressed according to the message the way he wants it to be mess how he wants it to be fitted in this hour don't let me cut off certain parts of the Gown don't let me cut off certain parts of I don't need a part of Revelations 3 and14 I don't need this over here in John 3:16 but let me be dressed according to the way that he wants me to be dressed and when you get there on Rapture morning you'll take a spin around and you'll say the dress fits me just perfect it's a beautiful thing when you begin to watch a wedding and I know there's several that's getting ready to take place but when the when the bride to be begins to try on her dress it shows her character when she picks out a dress according to the message and when she goes all the emotions are involved in it she's waited for this day ever since she was a little bitty girl she's dreamed about this she's had little Barbie dolls set out and she's had all of them at her wedding time and time again she's got poster boards on Pinterest and different things lined out this is how I'm going to to do it she's dreamed about it but when she puts the dress on she knows I'm in the final moments I'm in the spot where prophecy is becoming reality and when you come under the preaching of the word young people you're coming under it you're seeing yourself and I if I could maybe just change your view from what you see in the world just to see his you're beginning to look the part now you've dreamed about it for a long time but maybe I'll change your view because whenever I'm at a wedding a lot of people turn to see the bride but I always turn to see the groom because it's his first time seeing her dressed this way maybe I'll just change maybe your view just for a moment from the King's Point of View you're looking the part you're everything that he's wanting all you have to do is keep feeding on this message keep listening to this word don't matter don't pay no attention to the rest of the people that are sitting up there on the porch while they're criticizing making fun and thinking that he'll never come back for you don't you pay no attention to them because he made you a little he give a little no love note and he put on the he put on you a seal a kiss a seal of the Holy Ghost that it was a promise to you that I'm coming back for you with one year and the rest of the world may life at you and they might criticize you but he's promised you when the rest of the world don't understand why you're dressing yourself the way that you're dressing yourself you simply say he promised me that he was coming back for me and if he promised me that he was coming back for me I'm going to keep myself according to his word not what the rest of the world thinks but I'm going to dress myself according to the way that he wants when you begin to study out Esther and you begin to study it through the message one of the most amazing things to me is when brother Brandon begins to identify and study out Esther he identifies her with the woman with the alabaster box I look long and hard at and I thought how in the world could brother brandham identify her with this woman of disgrace a woman that had spent her life doing evil Deeds but he did not compare her to her mistakes he did not compare her to her last name he did not compare her according to her Deeds that she' done he compared her to her spirit because when this woman when she saw Jesus sitting in a seat unwelcomed she came before him with all that she had William brandom identified her that she came before him in a quiet pure Meek Spirit exactly how Esther came before The King he doesn't see your mistakes he doesn't see where you came from when the rest of the world wouldn't entertain him this woman made a choice I can't come on my own Deeds I can't come upon my own righteousness I can't came I can't come upon my own name because all those are filthy racks but I've got to come before him and when she came before him him and the scripture tells us that she came in behind him and she be to wash his feet with her tears and she begin to break the alabaster box and anoint him Simon was sitting there Judas was sitting there Peter was sitting there if he really was a prophet he wouldn't let this be done he would know what type of woman she is but with Jesus to his back to her begin to tell her story where she came from why she's here you didn't welcome me I'd say that maybe it was kind of a setup like this it was a great feast and people were talking about the politics of the day they were talking about the things of world that were going on and they missed that Jesus was setting over in a corner with 30 feet and all she cared about was coming to worship him let me say when you get done washing Jesus's feet there's something going to be said about it because this woman is not going to go down like the rest of women she is going to be down she's going to go down in history as Jesus would say that wherever the gospel is preached there will be a memorial of this woman I had it in my notes who would set out a chair for the king here we have our lord Jesus sitting here we know his decision about you because he already told us I do but what's your decision today in sickness and in health will you love him will you keep him will you be a wife to him when nobody else wants to be a wife to him will you love him and cherish him would you allow him to come and sit down at your table and be the Unseen guest if you allow him and set out a seat for him you won't be remembered as an orphan no more you'll be remembered as a queen and if you can ever learn this that when Jesus came to meet this woman when he had his back turned to her and she he began to preach to Simon said Simon I left a healing campaign out there I left lepers out there I left blind people out there but because you invited me I came but you didn't wash my feet you didn't anoint me but this woman ever since I got into the room she's had something on her heart that she would worship me all the days of her life when others people wouldn't worship me if you can ever figure out young people that the reason why Jesus is in the room is because of you you'll start living a whole completely different life that the reason why he showed up in these meetings is because of you he didn't show up here because of Andrew Spencer or brother Josh Bennett he did not show up here just because of brother brother Reagan and all of these other brothers he showed up here for you and I believe it ought to be a testament to you of where you're sitting at in your condition right now that he cared so much about you to come all the way from the portals of glory and to come and spend the evening with you that to tell you you're not destined to be in the background he might have found you in the background and you might be back there washing the dishes and you might be back there on the scene when when the rest of the world is in the front of the view but there on the backside when you're throwing out the dishwater that's when he sees your true character and when you're trying to hide that you don't have the nicest of things it's exactly what he's looking for IID say that the Bride of Jesus Christ has everything that our King is looking for and when you get to your position you'll m his kingship and his queenship I believe I believe that we have great anticipation I believe we have great anticipation one of I'm not a very I'm not a very old man I'm getting that way don't stand too close to me because my red hair is looking more like a cinnamon bun than than red hair I'm not too old of a man but I I do wake up with stupid ball injuries every once in a while I wish I wouldn't have done acted like a Superman all those times so I'm giving you a word don't don't act too crazy tomorrow but enjoy yourself I'll be watching you I'm not too old of a man just yet but there's something on the inside of me that longs for a change everything within me I enjoy all these moments I enjoy all these meetings and I enjoy the presence of the Lord more than anything else in this world when you get into that place in that position where you're spending spending that much time with him that you can feel him in the room and you don't want him to leave you're in a position that a queen has been elevated to that the rest of the world don't know what it's like and I hate leaving his presence but I am anticipating more than anything else is coming but can you imagine his anticipation as he looks out upon your life and he sees you matching his promise he say I'm coming soon I promised you I was coming I told you I was coming mother brandham said he could hear that buck wagon coming down the street as the sand was rolling underneath the wheels and it was the last day and she began to dress herself she put on her garments brother brandham said that here she was the bride to be was holding her flower of bouquet in her hand he said without a bit of nervousness because she knew he was coming I love what brother random said he said when she saw that buck wagon turn the corner she jumped off the porch and he jumped off the Chariot and stepped in and swooped her up and told her and said honey it's all over you're destined for a crown so Carrie yourself like he sees you as a queen may God bless his word maybe we'll just have a word of prayer turn it back over to our brother Donnie tonight father oh how we long to live a life that so pleases you a testimony that would match your kingship oh God something that you set up before time before molecules and atoms took their position Lord we invite you father to our hearts like never before Lord every person here sitting under the sound of our voice just now father I'm believing with all of my heart that they're going to be setting there across a table from me and we won't have to we won't have to play games and so who wins the prize because we'll all be winners there father so under that word under that belief father that we'll all be sitting there we won't miss it your Prophet would say in this generation that the bride has the material on Earth to make themselves ready father I pray that they would take this message that I love with all of my heart that changed my my life that saved an old Preacher's Son that that was wward May the message which is Christ come find them lift them up into a position that they'll recognize they were destined for greatness they were destined for the crown I pray God that your blessings be upon your people father I so love them with all of my heart and I trust that they'll be there in Jesus name amen where would I be God only knows I'm glad you see through Eyes Of Love a hopeless case and in [Music] can we stand [Music] together thank you brother Andre so appreciate the word tonight I saw yesterday that in the state of Utah several parents had come to a a middle school because the some of the students in that school consider thems furries so some of them think they are dogs cats raccoons all kinds of animals so they're biting other students in school licking them with their tongue and I read that and I thought what a sad time to be living to we kids think that they're animals a school teacher in the message a while back told me in State North Carolina that they're actually putting out litter boxes for students in the schools because they think they're animals and yet you you've come tonight to be in the presence of God I pray that God will help us to realize how blessed we are what a terrible time men don't know if they're men anymore women don't know if they're women anymore while the world is groping in insanity but God has a bride that recognizes who she is and what she's here for and it's to serve his purpose we've been so honored that you would spend this evening with us we have service tomorrow at 11:00 and then again Sunday for those of you that would like to remain and and be with us in the Sunday service brother Andrew be speaking both there brother Josh did two tremendous services for us and just so blessed to have these brothers that would come and be with us so as you go May the blessing of the Lord just be upon you and just as we sing this song Together think about where would you be if it wasn't for his grace maybe you would think he was a dog or a cat or an animal but God by his grace has opened your eyes to help you to see you're not here just to be an electrician a plumber a housewife a farmer but you're here to serve God's Eternal purpose let me sing it together thank you Lord where would I be you only know Lord [Music] thank you Lord Jesus Through Eyes Of Love hopess case why if not for Grace again can we sing it

oursel ready is now here Lord you provided that through the message of the hour I pray oh God that You' just help us to take take that material now let's just put on the garments and Lord as your Prophet said he he desired that the crowning of his ministry would be that he could dress the bride in the clothes of the word that he could present a bride to you oh God I I pray Lord that I'd be a part of that Lord I pray that every one of these young people will be a part of that Lord may we just stand Lord as a part of that that great bride of all the ages dressed in the clothes of the word wrapped in the Robes of your righteousness Lord I pray that you'll just bless all that has put forth an effort to make this possible I pray God that you would just bless them abundantly and Lord we
