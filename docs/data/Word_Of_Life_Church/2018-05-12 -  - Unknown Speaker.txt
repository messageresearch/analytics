[Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord for that American say amen to that for yourself to know that your redeemer is faithful and true the start of Ephesians 2:9 chapter 5 if you would verse 23 let's see how faithful he was fees in chapter 5 verse 23 we'd like to continue our studying looking at the church for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body now remember at this time whenever the book of Ephesians is written there was not as you and I know today a Baptist Church Church of Christ Nazarene Unitarian Universalist Church Catholic Church church Church Church church Church so and they used the word church they was not thinking in the same way that you and I would think today today we definitely want to be designated as bride we don't like it if aperture calls us church I don't mind being called this church because this is the elect the called out so whenever they was writing about the church they didn't have to deal with what we have to deal with today therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband's in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it as Christ also loved the ecclesia the church and gave himself for it was prayer together and we'd like to be remembered to not before the Lord god bless you Heavenly Father we love you so much we're so so thankful in our hearts Lord Jesus to be identified in this great redeemed body of the Lord Jesus we thank you father for opening our hearts our understanding removing from us the shackles of Darkness taking the scales as it were from our eyes illuminating us and helping us to see and this day of such darkness when man is absolutely out of his mind the Lord people don't know what's right and wrong they don't know what's good or evil man is it the place to absolutely destroy himself but we are so grateful for the light of the gospel of this day we thank you lord we have lived in Laodicea another week by the grace of God and we have survived and we're looking for miracles we're bunches of them right here tonight we thank you for Lord we pray that should take your word and speak to us tonight anointest by your presence Lord may we see father a greater understanding of who you are and who we are together in unison of the word of God in Jesus name and the church said god bless you may be seated we know that Paul was given such a special understanding of the relation of the church and how that God had identified it in the full mystery of redemption unlike all the rest the apostles that wrote in the New Testament even of those that did not write very much but those who had preached historical document documents rather than you're able to find some of the things that they said just by reading their writings you see that Paul was given a very special understanding of the word God does that himself and no man cannot make that happen but God does that and Paul in choosing the example that he did he chose I believe is you believe by the Spirit of God he chose the great union of a man and his wife to be able to reflect the perfect union of Christ and the church because it is such a beautiful and perfect time now he could have chose a father and his daughter he could have chose a father and his son he could have chose a man and his friend and he could have chose different human relationships to identify Christ in the church but instead he chose the most perfect that he knew was given and identified in the Old Testament and that was between a man and his wife and we know that God of course reflected that in the Garden of Eden whenever God created man and woman placed him there and it was a perfect reflection of his own identity with his own attributes and thoughts now God had never expressed a bride intentional human form yet from the Garden of Eden but the mystery was unfolding as it did for his first son and daughter so here Paul picks it up again and he wants the church to be able to see what a great love that God had for them and how that love had developed and further unveiled itself in the New Testament verses the old now the Old Testament they could see that God loved him and that God had an identification Kayson with them they could see that God wanted to the test a tabernacle the tabernacle of witness the testimony of the law that God wanted something to be identified between him and Israel but yet the law could never be able to produce what grace could produce because the law put him in jail but grace got him out so here Paul is able to bring them to a higher level with a greater understanding now miss notices in verse 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church now we know of course when you're running a parallel like this it's it's comparing an ant to a man it's like comparing something that is so far apart but yet God uses parallels and allegories you know that Paul was famous for using allegories you use one the Galatians for whenever he compared of course Hagar mounts an eon and we know that allegories are a parable as earthly story with a heavenly meaning so God would compare something that would be as high as the heavens is above the earth yet it would have a very similar meaning or symbolism about which man would be able to understand so here Paul uses something that is so far apart in something that is so far WOB of one story above the other but yet he felt like the church not only them but the countless agents that would come thereafter would be able to identify with the story that he's going to unveil now the distance between these two stories is as far as heavens is above the earth notice now he says he is the savior of the body now he compares a man a true man that's in love with his wife a true man that knows the value of a godly wife and he compares that to Christ loving the church but he runs a parallel between subjection and headship and responsibility and authority now the verse contrasts between verse 23 and verse 24 now many men on the message of course are very very familiar with this verse of scripture they're very familiar with the quotes that lead them to the Almighty man home and the man is the boss and the man is this and the man is that and most men that I've found who had that attitude do not have a clue what it's even all about that's right now if a true man really understands headship he understand that it does not make him some type of dominating man that he's going around kicking his wife hitting his wife abusing his wife but he realizes that it puts him in a greater place of responsibility that's right because the Bible in the way that he relates it notice again in verse 24 therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband's in everything now first he brings the order of subjection how that the church is supposed to be subject to Christ and the woman is to the husband as the church is to Christ and then he goes into verse 5 and expounds the parallel of how this headship will work and he said then husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now this is the greatest epitome of love that the world has ever known there has never been a love that is any greater than this you see this love is the type of love that the mighty elohim is expressing for the attributes which he cannot live without now john 3:16 is wonderful God loving the foolish version is wonderful God moving into the book of life and allowing people to be saved which are not even really his attributes that's wonderful but it cannot compare to the same kind of love that God has for his own body that's right Guarnere listen don't misunderstand me God absolutely could live without those people in the book of life God could live without the foolish version God could live without federal God could live without many many people who bent upon the earth but he cannot live without the elect that's right now think of it the grace of God will allow many of these people to be saved but they were never in that room of the eternal sinking of God from the very beginning in the realm of him condon seeing from the great eternal into the sphere by which in the beginning was the word and then from the eternal comes out the logos outlets of logos comes the attributes that was in him in the beginning of course that's when time began but before time began it was the eternal but you know what the foolish virgins was not there in him neither was those which are in the book of life they were not there in him then so the greatest reflection of that love is those for whom he had fully identified himself and so wrapped them up within himself that he considers himself without purpose of being unless they actually live the children of Israel gave him purpose and reason for being he busied himself for them in the Old Testament how much more has he done in the New Testament by the giving of his own token life amen now as I said this was the strongest love that the world has ever known now this is where that Paul brings the parallel to a man that really understands what headship was all about really loving his wife as a godly wife and a great gift from God but also was a great perspective of understanding in responsibility that that man loves her as Christ loved the church in realizing that well if she don't do what I want her to do I'll divorce and how give me another I don't care I'll get me a young word she's getting fat she's getting ugly she's getting fat and sassy I'll get rid of her boy I'll get they're brand-new now I'll get me a youngin out you and they they keep getting old I'll just want mom give me a Batman don't need to be married in the first place that's right that's not a man that loves his wife as Christ loved the church now come on Saints say Amen because he does not understand what headship really truly is now it follows them that a husband now listen carefully so you don't misunderstand me a husband cannot love his wife too much unless he puts her in front of God there is no danger of a man loving his wife too much being too kind oh my goodness you men are quiet no me not o not but yet in the example of Christ loving the church can Christ love you too much hello can he put a limitation on saying I can love you only so far and then I'll try love you so far I'm a skirt you're not going to love me back right he knows when he love me I could never love him as much as he loves me you see it is selfish life that keeps a record I love you more than you love me I do more for you than you do for me I say I love you 32 times and you only said 31 and 31 so with a grunt and a grumble so I'm not sure that even done it you know that is a very selfish love it keeps a record of all that is done according to first Corinthians 13 love does not keep a record well hallelujah oh I'll tell you this has made so real to me as actually sitting on this one ever eyes on the land of Israel and I was looking around to see the land that God gave to these people and realizing how that they in the Old Testament were the bride of God and how that God had moved for them time and time and time again and we stood upon a tale they tell us a place to where that the people in a civilization will build a city someone it would come in and conquer that city and instead of cleaning it all off they just level it out with more dirt sand and rocks and there on topic then they'd wipe them out somebody else would come in and build over just build it higher and higher and higher and higher and you realize each one of them will testify either of the grace or the judgment of God and that's why they could dig down so far and they would be able to pull out things of the Bronze Age Bronze Age then they would dig down so far deeper 20 feet deeper and they were dig down to them maybe another age and another age then others right in the same place because it would have been a strategic place every one of them told a story and you realize the grace of God giving to each one of them and giving them Mercia man they turned it down God would send an army and then they'd kill them to take it over and I thought how many times in the children it'll stand here in this place and now they've driven everywhere all over the earth and yet the grace of God still calling that 144,000 back we're standing by the way and while the other day a couple of brothers as I said think of it Moses and Elijah could be sent over against that wall right now Priam I believe we are that close Church I believe Moses and Elijah are alive remember the prophet else's question in 64 it'll probably be two men anointed with the spirit of Elijah and the spirit of Moses they're alive tonight don't lie tonight they're probably woke in the shoots of Jerusalem or Bethlehem or somewhere over there waiting for the hour what for for you and I to get ready to leave this world amen they cannot step in their ministry to the bride is gone that's right now what's the sin if a man loves his wife the way that Christ loves the church now that love of course is the model love by which God gave so what does Paul go on to say that he gave he loved his new church so much his white church so much that he gave himself for it that here again is a model by which God projects that a true man will truly love his wife in that he would be willing to die for her he would be willing to give his life for her if need be if someone was kill him or her want a true man that really loved his wife would not push her out and say take her I've got a greater purpose silly boy I'd take her nope if he loves her right he will be willing to give it all but I've gone out that's the way I'll feel about my wife I tell you one thing I'd die for you you're lying unless you're willing to live for now don't tell me what you do if your face of the guns as most of you know she'll never be able to face with that but we are telling me why the way you would really do by the way you live and treat her every day she say it's the same way with the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus tells me and proves to me his love by the way he treats me every day of my life he noticed me when I don't deserve it he's good to me when I'm not I'm not good back come on church he helps me when I'm down he helps me oh my goodness I'm not worthy of 100 to 1 percent of the blessings that I get but he's allowed for me is so much greater than anything I could ever get by he doesn't keep a record up on heaven and a tally book I know there's a book there but you know what the book is the book is the few things that I do there is no scripture there is no quotes that I have ever found that when we get there that day he will drag out his book and show us what all he done for us while we were in life but he keeps a record all right it will be our little measly record of life that we have lived on this earth that he by His grace give us power to live and he will give us a reward that day in heaven that's a true man right there now he gave himself in order to redeem this church this of course there's a model love by which every man should love his wife you young sisters that aren't married this is the kind of man you want you don't want no selfish man that he's talking about marriage and you listen to them and he'll tell about what he's expecting out of you and what you can expect out of him I want a wife that'll do this and I want a wife that'll do that and I want a wife it'll lose something else run sis run if he's not telling you what he's gonna do and what his plans are for you and it's all about him you better head out of here as fast as you can now his willingness to suffer for his bride I give his life of course in all the atonement that he did reflects to us what he did that one time but if he stopped there that would have been a tremendous price you agree with me on that but think of it he's done so much more for us even after we got saved he keeps us he has gives us peace he gives us joy helps us in the time of trouble woman don't know what to do when were up when we're down were a member out whatever was constantly expressing his love whatever we deserve it there's times if we do pretty good by that and yet there's time so we don't worry because he took it upon himself that his wife would be happy in this life you see how Paul parallels that a man who really loves his wife in the right way he will love her with a very unselfish undying love he's here not only to have a friend and a companion but he looks at her as being his responsibility in order to be able to produce as much happiness as he can well even the men's quiet the woman's quiet the kids are even quiet I wish Leah Maria was here them the little things about that hound they stand out and praise the Lord and say amen oh my they're gurgling tune I got no amens now this is the time of a love that God has for his church and this is the type of love that God wants sons of God to have for their well but the dami shed see Angela that's your fault for me [Applause] you ought to pray more oh Jesus it is the duty of a man who is truly married and committed to God also to this wife to support her in sickness inhales not only to work I make a living par praise the Lord I should have come over and recorded amens today to provide for her needs to keep her from danger peril difficulty praise the Lord not flirting with other women you say you love your wife and got girlfriends on Facebook you're a bold-faced liar and a hypocrite you see if a man has the spirit of self-denial then what will he think about oh you make it sound like that a man's supposed to eat dream Berg drink wife wife life what do you think he eats drinks breathes talks about [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mother don't you why you always preaching on them in you get some of these sorry hiding min around the message straightened down the wife so get straightened out reason all the woman's how their place cuz the man ain't in theirs well praise the Lord now the church then is a mirror reflection of that very same thing so you look at the church the church world tell them they're not supposed to dress indecent they're supposed to dress modest know what you know that ain't none of your business what preacher and right mind tells women how to dress the only preachers us in their right mind till women head of this all the rest sums crazy hey well ain't none of your business it is my business I'm a shepherd that's exactly right and to love a woman the way that God loves the church my it's absolutely phenomenal to see how that and God can equip a man to be able to do this you do believe this is absolutely a command of God now this is not an optional I power windows so we find then that the authority of the man over the woman is not because of his gender the authority of the man over the woman is not the very next verse a verse after Paul deals with this and says simply because he's a man and because he can father children it's based on one thing his lover now Paul actually offsets the bitterness of women being subject to their husbands because he knew some would struggle with it if not all oh god I'm going back here so what does he offset telling the women to be subject to their husbands with the man's love being so strong so supportive so much like Christ it offsets the bitterness of her subjection you see this is why sometimes many women struggle was being subject to their husbands because they got a demanding husband that demands they do their and demands they to the anger man's they do something else but he don't love her right and she struggles and then he it's just a circle that never ends she rebelled against him and he'll saw it back in her face and then he'll throw it back in her face and she'll throw it back in their face and the skillet every now and then pancakes it and then they just keep going you know because here's all you don't obey me woman could it be it's because you don't love her right [Applause] now why why when you look at the parallel of this God could love the church because he's God I'm God I want to love the SATs nobody's gonna stop me from got it well I'd serve him but I'd be scared to death of him I know what it is that's the way I used to serve him in Pentecost that's one thing I thought I heard when I heard the prophet on these tapes it freed me from that bondage really so how does he base his lie the book of redemption the mr. dibbs what's it based on he gave himself for us so then his authority is not because he's they all mauriello him always did base it on that but it's used to base it on love now the woman that finds it hard to subject yourself look at the parallel of the church for those of us who would struggle with certain things in the word and all the word says we shouldn't do this without of the other whatever it is that you struggle this in your life and many times we live in war when I go to church I'll tell what God's gonna wear me out I he I deserve a whipping he ought to just bend me over his knee and a lot of times what do you find he gives you grace and mercy and you're sitting there struggling within yourself thinking I'm not even worthy of that I'm not even worth god I want you to smack me down the aisle and hit me about three or four times you know I you got spiritual though beating wife syndrome that's what you think God could do but instead he loves you and he wants to watch the love for the love is to help you to be subject to his word so instead of just sweating himself out on the old mighty club down you question me you disobey my world I'll do this and that in the other no but instead he loves you to obedience oh praise God you see friends Jesus didn't just pity the church he did not pity his he left out I feel so sorry for him oh poor little things little hearts I feel so sorry for look so pitiful it wasn't pity it was a reciprocating love that resounded from his being not a pity that alga that this is the way of course the gospel is preached Oh somebody feel sorry for God God said he's poor little boy Danny already died don't y'all feel sorry for him oh my goodness don't look at them scars look at all that blood don't you feel sorry for her that's the way they preach it that's not my god neither did you go down journey abroad and say poor little wretched thing ain't nobody that can save them all maybe I'll go down he knew who was his from the very beginning he didn't look at you with pity he looked at you with desire there is a difference and pity and desire so he looked at you with desire with your good in mind so tell me what did the cross do for him what did becoming a human being do for the Lord Jesus what did he gain him what good did it do it going to hell burying our sins becoming sin what good did it do him personally at Marty's name at Marty's body Marty's reputation so apparently he was doing it for somebody else you may now man come on crow now husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church praise be to God oh my the spirit that Christ projected is the very thing of course that was able from the very heart of God to bring the church to such a place why would it be so your name are engraved on the palms of his hands I'll tell you one thing when man Carol got married almost 45 years ago we didn't get married with divorce in mind I know our messages he therefore divorce they don't make it right I don't care how many does it I still say the same vile so del Sol still part praise the Lord praise the Lord divorce if you eared into the divorce in mind no doubt you'll need that option so I people coming to God well I want to try Jesus oh you're gonna try and like grapefruit juice or orange juice and if you don't like grapefruit you go to Orange if you don't like orange you go to mango once you really approach the Lord Jesus you realize you ain't gonna try nothin else because he's the only one there's a lot here he's one among many he is the only one there is nothing else I could satisfy there's nothing else that can be able to quench a thirst but if you come to well I'm gonna try and sit for like and I'll keep my music I'll keep my worldly stuff and if I don't like him I'll go back to it more than likely you will but if you really are cold of God all that well I'm not sure I can be able to obey it I'm not sure that I can do it if you fall in love with him and him we're here so mrs. and subjection is automatic why he longed for a return of a loving intimate he longed for a return and it didn't just want to save you and just at the end of the road do something for you then but he actually wanted you to be happy go on that way to me it's a shame that we let the devil rob us of our joy and our happiness and our fees the Lord Jesus has done so much along the way to make us happy I realize we got a lot of things against his friends I nobody got circumstances there are things in our home family disease sickness troubles and so on and so on but does all that override the bounty of our God this should gone there's something wrong with our faith from Fidel's us over and over again we have untapped resources in Christ we have reserves and the goodness of God we've never even broke into you think you're gonna run out of joy you think our God's gonna run out of healing for the rapture I tell you no he ain't gonna run out of joy he ought to run out of peace he ain't gonna run out of satisfaction why don't some of us hop into it oh my the love of the Lord Jesus for his bride is so great he counts himself incomplete without you you say that's a pretty heavy statement it is lean not to your own understanding so you see if you were in the foreknowledge of God then you're becoming a part of God it's the only way you can be a son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you now this is only attributes he could be perfectly complete without foolish virgin somebodies ponder on that issue you're recycling it again you didn't get it the first time and you're really sucking it again they're not part of his eternal being the sea is not part of his eternal being tongue said I so no more sea storms are not part of his eternal being he will be complete without them well Rory to God but he cannot be complete without the alert oh my god isn't complete without you has to be that's right cuz there's only there's one one only one resource of eternal life and that is God and him alone has eternal life now and you were a part of him in so much that you're an attribute our in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning gives listen I bat out a spell to see them when I read this it gives that little tug towards him oh you've been thinking all this while that was your free moral agency you've been thinking about something you done that little tug you fellas him Todd you fellas not you it was him now listen it gives you that little tug toward him that's what has to be quickened it's that little tug your old man can't be born again your old man can't be quickened the tug is what's quickened some of them will never be quickened they just don't have it that's all or children well if it's a happy enough notice what phone as he goes to Ephesians chapter 1 yes put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all you mean the church is the fullness of the Lord Jesus in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the true church Joseph's fullness of the Lord Jesus not in you now not in me but in us this is why we need one another miss a devil that tries to pull you off away from church and pull you off away from one another come on cuz the devil knows no matter how strong you are as an individual your own in a little portion of this thing you're not the whole thing that's right which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so as the woman is the glory of the man that glory is reflected by the way she dresses and also by her hair that of course is the crowning agent of the ministry of the man himself God made the man first of course they made the woman Eve staying in her place and they go ahead and say it this way there was only one man that ever had a perfect wife and there's only one woman that ever had a perfect husband all the rest of us have flawed wives and flawed husbands that's right they were perfect I don't know how long they lasted but I was perfect initially but all the rest of us are flawed but the thing of it is if we follow the leading of the Lord in the woman of the man that we married then God will correlate our flaws to where that the man being followed the woman being flawed they'll be able to work together under the harmony of holy wedlock in order to make both of you a better person than what she was before you got married that's right now you see many want to marry a woman and they want to be able to multiple select what they want out of her get rid of this get rid of this I want that get rid of that I wish this I want that I want that well you know you need to make a frankincense what you need to do just make the kind of woman that you want or is it may be that you need to be remade now Paul when he goes into the part about subjection of the woman they're paralleling it to the church and then the headship of the man being reflected by divine love notice this in verse 26 he said that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he bounces it back and forth from the woman the man and the woman to though to the Christ and the church as brother Wren does marriage and divorce is one reason why people misunderstand marry divorce because brother n goes from man the woman to Christ the church men who own the Christ Church man and woman across church so Paul does Ephesians 5 exactly the same way so he moves from the man now and the woman down to verse 26 speaking of Christ that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word now look at this word sanctified is Hagi's hill which means hallow be wholly separate from profane things and dedicate to God to consecrate to purify so God wants his bride his wife the church to be separate from the things of the world now I wouldn't want my wife going around flirting with every man in this church I wouldn't want to go around for it with one [Music] if I've seen my wife having all kinds of pictures of herself with other men in this church posted on Facebook if I had such I wouldn't like it I don't want her dressing in such a way that's going to get men's attention what she is is mine it's not for sale and it's not for anybody else to look at come on don't get quiet out what Christ feels the same way about his church he redeemed her he sanctified her he watched her and he does not want her looking light of the world that's right and he sanctified her by the washing of the water of the Rhema and ordered that she might be constantly cleanse now itself of the washing of the water of the logos which the logos is that which has been written maybe hundreds and hundreds of years ago the washing of the water of the word remember when they take the sacrifice when a woman will be come in from having a boy child or a girl child and she would have to have a certain offering and from but also with the leprosy then when they would come in by lectures they they would come in and offer a certain offering and then they must also have running water jeonyul of course the temple being built in Jerusalem they come from the brook Kidron and they would have running water it could not be water that was stored up in a cistern to be able to use and the sacrifices it had to be running water so the running water was used in the cleansing of leprosy which is sin also cleansing of a woman who had a child and it must be running fresh water now it's not stored up something that was 75 years ago 500 years ago whatever more but the washing of the water to cleanse the church is the on coming revelation of the present day truth and it is still running it's not dammed up so those folks in the message you try to dam it up here they are there you know what they're totally breaking the type going into a denomination because it is a denominational system the dams of the water of God well however yeah so in order to be cleansed in order to be sanctified now we were sanctified of course when we come to him in the initiation of the bride marriage to him Christ the word but the sanctification does not stop there living in a dirty filthy world we had to be washed over and over again how many even say him into that if you all had to repent so far this week this is Wednesday maybe I - the Lord to forgive you for thinking this say on that Lord get police help me God what is it now what are you doing your inning in to the original bass or the sacrificial water of the washing of the word of God it keeps you clean not only in order to be married to Christ the word as Esther was but it is a continual washing man to consecrate or to purify and in this of course is an allusion as it was Esther in the Old Testament that a woman would come to be married to the king they couldn't come straight from their fathers how about them of course a very poor they very poor food coarse food and this food would actually produce an odor their flesh would begin to take on the sin of the way the type of food that they ate now they were very poor so they very crude types of things and the king himself would eat light or delicate types of foods so they wanted to cleanse someone now I didn't take that long to wash your body but it took that long to detox as we can say in order to her hurt and now they changed her diet they didn't just perfume the woman but they started feeding her seven seals seven thunders opening of the word so as she started feeding on that word and taking that word into her body her body absorbing these nutrients calcium and carbohydrates all this it actually produced a more fragrant smell out of the woman's body itself I wish somebody would help me preach them you know it because it changed her died from the crude course bad this stuff that she fed on for so many years then she started eating on eagle food the son of man the reveal word and what it done it actually start bringing her flesh just started bringing her flash subject to the new diet that she was either a man and you could tell that she was in the king's court because her flesh was being brought subject to the Kings diet and then they would soak her and myrrh and they were so now what's all there for that's not for her spirit that's not for her brain that's not for her intially what's it to do to change the fragrance of her body to change the fragrance of her flesh from within and from without glory to God but they started feeding her it would do no good to constantly give her a bath in all of myrrh and all of frankincense and all them other oils if she's constantly eating no junk food that makes her smell like the world what good does they do to go to church and be washed by the water the word when you're down Sunday morning and still feeding on junk and feeding on the world and of all churches and that's your diet you've got to have a cleansing from Earth and I'm from without whoa praise the Lord so this washing consisted of expensive unguents of perfumes and apothecaries about what's the woman's odor would begin to transform she smelled like a poor girl when she came in but before long meal by meal bath by bass she started smelling like a queen Aaron walked into the presence of Moses one day just looked like any other ordinary man but Moses give him a bath now he's an old man he's giving himself a bath for a long time but this time he needed the bath by a prophet lowered and when the Prophet gave him that bass God already had an ointment I've been a pounding together by the Apothecary of that day a special anjuman of odors by which they would put together which was totally forbidden by any other Israelite to wear nobody I don't care if you're rich or poor whoever you was it was kept only for the high priest that man took off his modernist ephod in the urine Thummim and everything you still know who he was by the way smelled I'll tell your friend this bride puts off a fragrance a man it ain't just when she's in church she don't smell like the lily of the valley and smell like a polecat on Monday morning come on she don't smell like a fragrant rose in church on Sunday and then smell like a a garbage heap on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday but that woke her everyday woke is anointed with the ansan of the Holy Ghost this is the word we get unction from an unction from the Holy Ghost praise be to God praise be to God by the washing of the water mother Rhema Living Word you see the difference between a selfish love and an unselfish love is see in this allegory between Christ and the church a man and a woman in that a man who marries a woman for selfish reasons only all a woman marries a man for selfish reasons not for what she can become not that she can take that man be a real wife and a real queen - but with the concept of what she basically can get out of it Sampson was the epitome of a very selfish man he was a Jew he was elect but he was a selfish individual why do you want what he wanted he did not want what was best for the church he did not want what most best even for Delilah sorry elephant what did he want what was best for Samson he did not keep the secret of God why because he wanted what was best for Samson the epitome of a selfish oh you see an unselfish lover constrains himself to the submission of God first you know the order of real true headship it's not the man being the dominant King in the whole and him subjects and nobody else a man Locke gets a tyrant you young girls looking for a husband tsehai relates to his pastor that'll kind of tell you what your future homes going to be if he's got the eye idea that he's a Hitler that's probably what you're gonna marry mr. ad off himself I don't need the pastor bless God I do what I want you better stay away from him since you're fixing to marry a dictator amen brother Nami preach brother darling I'm with you brother darling you see an unselfish lever that loves his wife he's not gonna do things it's going to damage her no more than Christ now I know Pope's look out and they get an attitude against the Lord Jesus he took my makeup away he took not this so he took my cigarettes away you got a problem with that he took my alcohol the way probably kept me from know how for Oden killings have id+ killing yourself three or four times and you've got a problem it's that anything he takes from you it's for your good but Satan will try to turn your attitude against him it's the same way with women when they're struggling to try to come under the true headship of a true servant of God if that means projecting to you the right kind of love says then finds your place in the Word of God and God will help you it will be for your good it will be the kind of marriage that God wants on the earth just like Christ and the church notice this in verse 27 that he might present it to himself that he might present it to himself a glorious church now the word glory is a strange word it's the glory of God the glory of angels the glory of chairman's of glory and most of the time it is doctor is the word that it comes from but here being glorious it is in DOCSIS and it means gorgeously honorable held in good or great esteem high repute in lustrous splendid free from sin this ought to be the goal of every man that's married to be able to present his wife if she's the right type of woman as Christ will present his church oh brother Darnell it was perfect my I agree with that brother Chisholm thanks brother Lou he is but he just don't know I'm not we do he'll get over it's really mean here that has a perfect wife oh god I shouldn't said that now I've got you brothers in trouble anywhere man got a perfect house of course not but what do you want to present her ass you want to present her as Christ will present his bruh but brother darling she don't always do what I say that sounds like us so you want to send me to tell me you men expect this woman to obey you a hundred percent and be absolutely perfect and some of you are numbskulls some are you are stubborn as a goat you're as hard-headed as the Bulls of Bashan and you expect your wife and you puff your fingers to be there worshiping elected king of alabama your royal highness some of you will read your Bible you get mad at me because I follow the leading of the Lord to preach on your hand you get mad and then Pat will come back to church and then you expect her you just wiggle your nose and she's supposed to come saving on the carpets of Arab Arabia give me something yes bring me a moon pie - okay your royal I was just thinking he'll give you the authority to think in this old woman and we will debate and argue with Almighty God let me tell you friends why we're not in the rapture things just disappear can you imagine I guess every now and then when the devil reads the scripture he just reads it for jokes and laughs and he looks at us as mortals and he says you gotta be kidding this Jesus actually think he's going to have a people like this that are splendid splendid Darrell you gotta be good splendid Donnie splendid Jean people without fault glorious people he will present to himself you've got to be kidding no he's not and he will not produce this by beating us and whipping us and scaring us over hell we'll get weapons sure we will we'll get correction when we need it but he'll love you into this he'll love us but a skip into the body chains he'll love us into the rats a church full of glory splendor beauty psalms 45:9 Kings daughters were among that honorable women upon thy right hand didst and the Queen in gold of all fair hearken o daughter and consider and climbed a near forget also nine own people and our father's house Psalms 45 answers to the Song of Solomon David had no wife quite like Solomon did but here it was in prophetic form the queen stands in the gold of all far notice what he beckons her to do forget her father's house sim like I remember reading that somewhere else in the book of Genesis when he called a man by the name of Abram these are his kids so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy Lord and worship tell him and the daughter of tyree shall be there was a gift even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour oh I know your left it I know people think you're crazy and they think you were nobody but when they walk before the White Throne and them and their human bodies are able to look across that throne and recognize you they will be hoping and praying to God you'll be able to speak on their behalf once they recognize you are the Queen the king's daughter is all glorious was it her clothing is of Roth gold she shall be brought into the King unto the king in raiment of needlework the Virgin's her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the king's palace notice the Virgin's the virgins are coming because they're given to the bride they do not enter on their merit they do not interfere coz they deserve it they are given to her blessed be the Lord over to God the Virgin's her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought I guarantee you with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the king's palace not because of the king's daughter not because of the king's bride but because of companionship to his queen instead of our fathers shall be thy children whom thou miss make princes in all the earth I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and I don't want to stagger you but when we get there to that City that day they're coming to see the city they're coming to see the king but they're also coming to see you there won't be any jealousy there and the kings of the earth that live on the outside will pull off a leaf and hand to one another on their way out it's a think of it brother at one time we fought and we killed one another but now we're in peace and they won't live in the city they'll come up from new moon to Sabbath and and all of that but they will come up to see the glory of the Queen you see it was the custom of many of these middle-eastern kings when they would show the goal and show their armory and show their different things but one of their greatest treasures was always their life remember when King Ahasuerus call for his wife he wanted to show her beauty he wanted to show her majesty and she refused to come right rather sister when God calls for the bride amen he's calling now the glory the glory is preceded by suffering the glory is preceded by our identification I reproach for the word the reason you'll wear this type of glory is because you have suffered with them if you suffer with him you also shall reign with him suffer sister suffer brothers let them life at you let them make fun of you you will be crowned with the glory in the god of heavens Oh we'll share his girl in personification with you at that day and the people will come in and bow before you there's the queen let me close again verse 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing glory that it should be holy and without blemish it won't have a stain it won't have a defect that won't be an impurity and there won't be no wrinkles so she's an eternal young bride in the rigor of this beauty of youth for ever and ever oh ma don't you want to take your wife by the hand brothers and walk down that place together and the bloom of eternal yes in the presence of the king when he will present us to himself praise be to God ever son and daughter of God that will stand there that day none of us 'disformed disfigured no gray hairs Oh bald spots no age ones among us no one cripples in a wheelchair glory to God he will present us to himself praise the Lord brother Branham well I love my wife then yes not like now as a human but it's something that's yours you see it's something that you stepped out of eternity together and a body called time and one day you'll step back into eternity together again hand-in-hand let's stand together notice this in verse 28 how that he caps this so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies you realize how much of our squabbling and fussing and all these things would be stopped if every man would love his wife just according to verse 28 what causes our arguments difference of opinion and we're so afraid we got to give up a little bit you're gonna give up one thing or another you're going to give up the last round of words before you can say you had the last argument or fuss or you're going to exchange it for peace I don't care how much you want to try to convince me or not you're not going to that you can tell me you're where you need to be able in your fussing and fighting the Holy Ghost does not dwell in arguments go ahead I think you can I think you can affect I thought a good I thought about a colloquy so you trade off peace you trade off and drive the Holy Ghost out on the limb somewhere while you're getting your last word in is it really worth it is it really worth it so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself don't you understand he's preaching this from a divine perspective of the way Christ looks at the church he's not overwhelmed by you as a Reagan or a Bab or a horn that's not why I says turn your eyes away from me he's overwhelmed by himself in you he looks at you and loves you and by so doing he loves his own work in your life a man who loves his wife and is good to his wife is good to himself praise the Lord men who put their wives to physical abuse there's something mentally wrong with them men who put their wives through psychological abuse arguing fussing i'ma go ahead and say they're not in the right mind if they were in the right mind this is the way they would look at that one she don't just serve her brother Donnie I understand where you're coming from you don't either how much grace do you think you deserve tell me speak out tell me how much grace how much Blair say how much Holy Ghost how much forgiveness do you think you deserve then why is it then you go to him when you make mistakes and ask for it and yet you don't think you deserve done now you ain't got one standard for you and one for your wife do you praise God the thought is that a man should have the same care for his wife as she does for his own body I fed this thing for almost sixty two years now I love it ain't no man in the world I love any better now don't stand there look at me like a bunch of cherubims be honest who do you take care of better than anybody else who'd you get ready for church your your wife will be able to pick her out if you clothed her we like what we didn't like to drink what we like to eat would like to eat when we like to eat what that's her self you can imagine then a man loving his wife as he loves himself please don't misunderstand me friends the Lord God loves you more than he loved he's simply asking us men to love our wives as we love herself but he said don't worry I'll go beyond what you can even do I love you more than I loved myself because I gave to myself for you I can follow a man like that what about it brothers can we follow this example can we be this kind of man or we want to be men by mouth I'll tell your brother Donny I can benchpress I don't care if you can lift a thousand pounds in each arm I don't care if you can benchpress 789 pounds with your little toe that don't make you a man right here's what makes you a man this is a man after God's own heart well I'm getting old enough to retire I guess I'm retired after this tonight if y'all want me to be dangerous grim that election tonight wouldn't it let's bow our heads together shall we Lord Jesus help us father how can we fathom such love it's love beyond our human understanding it's love that is so great Lord Jesus I pray that should help each of us men women boys girls the married the single the divorced all of us love God to have this kind of undying unselfish love help us men that are married that have wives to take these scriptures there's a very great command directly from the Lord Jesus to us O God may we meditate on them and may we set them before us maybe there's men here tonight who can honestly say they can't do this that they really don't love their wife as their self maybe they say I'm just struggling with it don't I've got to be honest well don't we know that you want us to be honest before you it would be unjust of you Lord to make such a demand of us men unless you would empower us to fulfill it but we know it's a Holy Ghost in our souls and submission of our flesh Lord God we can become this what you want us to be many of these married man will never be preachers they'll never interpret tongues many of them probably have never even spoken in tongues here's what they can't be why should they spend years of their life focusing on something they're not even called to be and ignoring something they're called to be every day of their life Lord this is not trivial this is not small this is a very great demand of us men as it is of the sisters then lord I pray you would help us is true men we have several couples getting married in the next few months six weddings maybe something like that I pray it helped these young men standing present tonight Lord to realize what an awesome responsibility that are entering to help these young ladies Lord what a great great union it is so much that you typed you and your church like this god help us uh pray help us men to give all that we are put you first and foremost secondly after that love our wives oh I know Lord many have it backwards they love their children more than their life they die for their children they put their children first they do this and this and this for the children and then when the children leave home their marriage collapses and they wonder why but you had it right in the Garden of Eden you didn't put Adam and a boy you didn't put Adam and three sons or how many of our sons or daughters you put a man and his wife and you gave them time together which a married couple need to bond together to form a true bond before children start coming because once they do it'll change then you gave children after the Union that's the perfect order then you expect us to keep it in that order it's more difficult when children come along the mothers attention the father's attention but you never intended for the marriage to erode because children come on the scene takes more work more devotion to make it work but it can work and work successfully help us Lord Jesus you know my prayer father one day I want to stand before you as a preacher I want to give an account father from my ministry having preached in every continent on the earth having affected thousands times thousands of people and I say that only by the grace of God you have helped us to build churches all over the world there's organs sound systems computers stuff sitting in preacher steady churches

well you studied you gave so much you did so much around the world but she was a sorry husband your wife suffered you never was a right kind of husband because you're so busy about preaching praying traveling going here and there Lord when I stand I want to stand also as a husband as a father as a grandfather I want to do my best lord in all these aspects of my life help me Lord Jesus I pray praise God praise God thank you Jesus him and your brothers want to stand with me tonight and say I want to be the best husband I can be amen I guarantee some of these brothers here tonight who wives wives have been taken from all of what they'd give for a year six months for five years more was that woman Oh what they'd give to be able to go back and maybe undo this and redo that you know priorities as humans we get them all goofed up we think this is a priority and that's a priority really what are the priorities of life when that loved one is gone was the priority you being able to out talk them out smart him out fuss them now what would you give when there were bodies laying in the grave what would you give what really had the value fussing or life fussing or being able to

father thank you for your word thank you for the Blessed opportunity to be closed all Lamb of God as we trod just last week last Wednesday oh my father as my eyes looked upon the Old City of Jerusalem built by the Turks 500 years ago as we come from the South and went to the north and those who know the geography of theirs are knowing that it's far as the land mass about the size of the state of New Jersey and there's places in America that's much more beautiful places in Europe that's more beautiful but yet according to your word the book of Deuteronomy you talked about that land to the children of Israel and you said it's a land that the Lord our God loveth and his eyes our opponent from the beginning of the year to the end of the year it's a land which drinketh in the rain it is a land that you will not water with your foot which is speaking of the irrigation of Egypt that they by their feet would kick the water wheels and water the land or glory and I thought when I looked at the land and some of it's so barren and so desolate nothing growing it helped me to see how that God's vision is so different from ours as you look at that land and you said it was beautiful and you said it was all these great adjectives and yet even to this very day on some of it nothing grows but it shows your vision of that land glory to God of what it's going to be one day and I thought of us we may look barren sometimes we may look dry and you look at us and say thou art beautiful as tearsa comely as Jerusalem praise be to God we worship You Lord Jesus make us beautiful in your house I pray Lord God hallelujah we worship You Lord God we bless your holy name tonight father go with us now operate bring us back this weekend lord thank you Lord prepare our hearts to receive of your goodness I pray Lord in Jesus Christ's name Amen how many loves you love him with all your heart don't you want to be what God wants you to be base word god bless you brother Larry let's sing together
