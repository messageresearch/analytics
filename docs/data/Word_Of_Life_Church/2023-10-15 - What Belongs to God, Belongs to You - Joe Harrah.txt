these words to their soul your healing is on the way this is the day say that your life will change your pain is temporary the suffering that you carry soon will be taken away your healing is on the [Music] way you may be hurting and you may be tired fighting each day just a smile knowing he's promised to answer your prayers but you see no end to this trial well God may be using your faithful test testimony to touch more lives than you ever did before so just keep believing and telling your story and claiming This Promise in faith your healing is on the way the Healer remembers your name your pain is temporary the suffering that you carry soon will be taken away your healing is on the way for God's promised healing to all of it his children in his perfect time and his way well some will receive it in this life we're living and some when we see him face to face but until that moment he's holding you close and he will give give you peace in the pain your healing is on the way the Healer remembers your name your pain is temporary the suffering that you carry soon will be taken away your healing is on the [Music] way your healing is on the [Music] [Applause] [Music] way I believe that your healing was done brother brand said before the foundation of the world you know we we look at that sometimes we look at our human feelings our human emotions sometimes it clouds the the revelation of what's actually ours you know I was thinking and I was thinking this past weekend too how growing up you know you I grew up with the tapes in the home you know Wednesday night we listen to tape service my dad had you know the big real to real we you know I've heard the profit on my life then you get situations in your life and you we've all thought if brother Brandon was here you have we all have if brother Brandon was here he'd go to my house he he'd pray over me discern my thoughts and tell me to go my way I'm Healed you know when there a lot of people left this message one that human form left when he left they couldn't see the healing anymore they couldn't see the Deliverance anymore but this morning if I can convey one thought to you the same God that stood there beside him when he discerned of thoughts some of the people he would just lay their hands on never say a word they'd walk off healed he's here today he hasn't changed he hasn't left hasn't diminished you know that's just the way our thinking is you know they we have to have a revelation of who we are you know so this morning if if we could keep that thought of who who who we really are and who God is to us let's pray this morning before we go to the word Heavenly Father Lord I have so many emotions going through my mind My Heart Lord nervous Lord in my human brain keeps throwing up doubt and worry and fear but Lord may I channel that part in my heart in my soul that your Prophet said there was the Throne of God lord and if we can put aside ourself this morning lay our human feelings aside and look to a promise you said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world yes Lord we're in a spot to this morning that is one of the greatest positions to be in it is to feed your bride Lord as a human I don't want this spot Lord I've got nothing to say that would be a benefit with my own words but Lord you promis that if we let you have your way if we set ourselves aside we would see your glory there's many needs Lord there's so many needs all of hell has opened up on this bride Lord we see our sister Erica in a position this morning where she needs your touch Lord I was sitting in the back and I was thinking of those four friends that took their budy to say You Lord he didn't have the power to get himself there he didn't have the power to climb up on the top of the house he didn't have the power to tear the roof off but they did Lord let us to be those friends this morning Lord if we have to tear the roof off of Heaven for our sister this morning Lord and set her at your feet Lord you put that power in us I pray that you anoint our hearts this morning to receive Lord may they look past who I am I am one of their own Lord I'm just a friend a relative Lord if they would pull on Heaven this morning they could hear from you Lord if I get out of the way speak to your children this morning Lord we love you we invite you Lord we feel your wonderful presence here this morning we're so grateful Lord that you would honor us with your wonderful presence Lord thank you for the songs that are sung the worship Lord we thank you for deliverance from the requests that been made this morning Lord we pray that you would have your way in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles you'll turn to Romans chapter 8 we'll start it I'll read a couple scriptures after this you can sit after we read this 8:1 14-1 17 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if the if children then heirs HS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be also glorified together may the Lord bless his word you can be seated i' like to speak this morning on what belongs to God belongs to you I think so many times we we get to the place where we don't understand what really belongs to us what we really have and if you're a join there with Christ if if you're an heir of God you know you we hear how a wheel is read when somebody passes the wheel is read and you know and sometimes it's a long lost uncle and you get everything or or you get nothing but we look at when the wheel was read the wheel that God wrote concerning you the deal is with with him he died the whe was ready and when he died he gave you everything everything anything you have need of he gave it to you but then he rose again so he can share it with you he gave you everything and then Rose so you can have it together that's the perfect kind of will that's the you know we would all love say if our our Granddad our grandmother passed away left us something in wheel that you would you would want the what what they give you would want to share that with them but you can't but God says I'll share with everything that I have I've give to you in John 1:12 it says but as many received him to them gave you power to become sons of God even to them that believe on his name gave them power to become sons of God there has to be an adoption the old man has to die and then you become a Son of God even to them that believe in his name which were born not of the blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of God brother Bram said God who's rich in Mercy now we are a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you're only an attribute of God you were only in his thinking your very name if it were on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of of the world he knew you were there I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and this scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be you are now you now are the sons of God you always were the sons of God you know we can identify ourselves with our family our people we work with our loved ones on our jobs you know there's nothing wrong with that it's human nature but God wants us to see past this Humanity God wants us to see past the the troubles in our lives the things that we're going through the battles that we Face the sickness in our lives the our loved ones the things they're going through God wants us to look past that with you like I I was at brother Homer's last week last weekend and I was talking so many times we look at the issues in our lives with our human eyes and then when we look at it with our human human eyes our human Minds we we we we we tend to just blow it up and it's so big and it's so bad and he tells us look at it through God's eyes look at your problem through God's eyes eyes because God says I have given you through my will I have given you everything you need for that problem everything that you need to get over this issue that's in your life everything you need for healing of cancer for healing of TB or whatever it is in your life he says I've already given you that you just need to look at it through my eyes it's so hard to do with human nature especially when it's our problem when we're the ones it's our doctors's report when it's our symptoms when it's our child as I've said before it's so hard to have faith when you're the one grieving you're the one grieving you need me to have faith for you I need you to have faith for me brother Donnie and sister Carol and the family they need us to have faith for them you know it's like I I told Brother Jimmy a while ago sometimes a bad report makes a a good report report even better it makes a good report greater we don't look at the symptoms we don't look at the circumstances we don't look at what is right before human eyes because when you were wrode in the wheel he said healing belongs to you he didn't throw a formula in there he didn't throw some way to work it up and say you have to do this I want you to pray three times a day I want you to read your Bible four times a day I want to make sure you you you you pay 15 and a half% ties there's no formula for healing it's the children's bread it belongs to you when he wrote in the wheel Deliverance for the besetting sin in your life there's no special formula there's nothing that says you got to work it up it's free sometimes you know brother BR made this statement you when when when the bride recognized her position that the Rapture would go and so many times we use that as a cliche when the bride sees who she is she'll leave we hear that often and often but do we ever really recognize the reality of it that that actually has to happen before we leave yeah that has to actually happen before you can receive everything God has for you you have to recognize who you are you have to recognize your position in God you were in God's mind before the foundation of the world yes you always was you always will be God sees the perfect you but Satan makes sure he clouds that view from you he don't want you to feel like an heir he don't want to feel you to feel like a son or daughter of God he wants you to question so much God why is this happening in my life I thought I was your son I thought I was your daughter why is this happening to me yeah and so many times God says because that's my perfect will that's the part we don't want we don't understand if this is God's perfect will for me he said I can have healing he said I can have Deliverance he said I can have joy he said I can have peace he said I can have healing why am I going through this sometimes you have to get through that to get that amen sometimes you have to go through valleys sometimes you have to go over mountains it's not all straight interstates all the way through cuz like I said last last time I preached here sometimes that's the only time that God has fellowship with us is when we go through something that's the only time we talk to him that's the only time we pray to him is whenever things are so hard in our life we don't know how we're going to make it from one day to the next and then we decide to cry out from God after we tried everything else when are we going to get to the spot when we try him first right when we try God first as soon as it comes upon I'm not saying nothing wrong with doctors we have to have them we have to have them brother brandham said you had to but we wait till it's so dark we don't know which way to turn we don't know what we're going to do from one day to the next before we ever call out to God do we ever get to the spot when we're on top of the mountain and everything is peace and love and joy and we sit down and just have fellowship with God where are those days gone where have they gone come on come your bank account is as big as it's ever been I know it was quite listen I had an hour and a half for no I was coming here so it is what it is it's so often human nature will we get our best life is when we leave God out of it you're living your best life and the one who gave it to you you haven't included him you haven't included him you want all the healing you want everything he has to offer when he gives it to you you haven't included him come on that's right I promise you you can leave here today healed amen because he promised it yes you can leave here richer today naturally richer financially richer you can leave richer here today but if you did would you include him in it you could could leave here happier than you've ever been in your life walk out the doors to something just overcome you and I can't believe I'm just happy everything's going good would you include him on now would you give him the praise for it would you give him the glory I I ain't even turn the page and I don't know why I'm going this way God wants to be part of your life more than you want him part of your life God wants to give you joy peace money yes healing happiness overcoming power Deliverance salvation the list goes on and on and on he wants to give all of that to you more than you want it your human mind cannot want it enough your human heart can't want it enough yeah thank you Lord we have to find our position right future home if you are the bride the bride is part of the husband if the only place you the only place you'll recognize it is recognize what part of that husband brother B says in pareses that word the husband is the word what part of that word that you are are you fulfilling the part of the word that you are come on now is your life fulfilling the word are you living the part of the word that is you there's the word says you can have healing right so many times we we we want to work the word to fit us we we want it to fit us instead of us fitting the word we want our life to we want the word to adjust to our life and God says you need to conform to the word yeah because that's who the husband is am you know we we got people nowadays that that that you know they try to fit the word to fit them and they they talk about these you know well brother brandom said this about about this you know and but he didn't say anything about this this is the gray area when he talked about makeup and stuff but he didn't say what color and stuff this a grayer and fingernail polish and this but he he talked about red fingernail polish he talked about these kind of clothes but he didn't talk that's a gray area a gray area oh the word says the bride will be in Pure White okay there will be no gray areas she will not put on anything Gray why why would we want to try to get so close people want to fit in they want to fit in they want to be part of the message but they want to fit in at work they want to fit in at school I'm going to I'm going to say this if if he didn't say anything about it it's a gray area you might ought to stay away from it dress yourself in what you know is pure white and that is the word and with that becomes everything that you own everything you possess is pure white you're not going to find healing in a gray area you're not going to find Deliverance in a gray area you have to put on the word and the word the Bible says she will be without spot or wrinkle because she possesses him everything that he is she possesses it's not enough just to agree that hey I'm a member of the pride I go to Word of Life it doesn't God doesn't mean it matters what church you go to what congregation you belong to knowing you and knowing God and God knowing you is wonderful but if you end up if God allows you to go through a hard trial and a hard test if you don't know who you are yeah you say I know God but do you know who you are we begin to recognize what he has for us Satan's not going to tell you Satan's not going to tell you that this word is wrong this message is wrong we've already you've already been that you're predestinated you have the Holy Ghost listen just because you have the Holy Ghost doesn't doesn't mean that you're not going to battle things it doesn't mean you're not going to that probably means you are that means you're going to go through things in your life if you have the Holy Ghost you're the one that's got going to have a lot of Trials you're the one that's going to have a lot of tests you why because God loves you that seems like a paradox don't it God thinks so highly of us he's going to put us through a trial he loves you so much amen he's going to give you some hard times why because he knows what's in you he knows what you possess he will not put more on you than you can bear sometimes it looks dark it looks bleak and you say I didn't ask for this there ain't a single one in here raise your hand said Lord give me a trial I want to I want to test this thing that you've given me I want to test this Holy Ghost to make sure it's the real thing nobody's here raised their hand and said give me a trial give me a test it's God's Sovereign Grace he need sometimes he needs you to come up higher sometimes he needs you to get out of that rut that you're in right amen but remember this if he gives you a trial he already knew ahead of time that you would go through it you might not go through it the first time you might not go through it the first 20 times but if God give you a trial you're going to get through it that's a promise he'll never put more you can bear your trial I can't handle your trial God looked at your shoulders look at mine said hey yours are wider than mine now I can try to get you on a roof and I can help you tear a roof off and I can help drop you down sometimes that that's our position that's what God wants us for to have the power for somebody else because you possess that power amen my wife gave me a quote while ago her and Came Upon her text brother brandom said your own power of faith has pulled from the supernatural God the desire of your heart your own power of faith has pulled the desire of your heart from God the desire of your heart do you desire to be healed yes do you desire to be to have joy peace Deliverance yes we all do brother BR said your own faith pulls that out of God are we using it Satan's job is to keep you from recognizing who not only who you are but who you belong to in thy house sometimes we we don't look at the realize the power that we have we don't realize it you have the same power laying in here in you that God had when he said let there be light same power it hasn't changed but bandom said in thy house you're talking about Jupiter and Mars and these stars that you see now think about 100 light travels he said about 186,000 m per second take 120 million years by 1 second 186,000 it will break down to 120 million years that's what you get that's miles it just makes you feel like you're you're just but now then beyond that there's many just as many moon and stars and he holds them in the power of his own word that's the very same thing that holds them in you as a Christian see there you are in Leviticus 20:24 he said but I said unto you you shall inherit their land I will give it unto you to possess it a land that floweth with milk and honey I am the Lord your God which hath separated you from other people God says you're different you're different than everybody else You Are My People you shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean between unclean fouls and clean you shall not make your souls abominal by Beast or by foul by any living manner that creepeth on the ground which I have separated from you as unclean and you should be holy unto me for I the Lord am Holy and ser severed you from other people and you should be mine God said I've severed you from other people I've divided you I've separated you other people see who you are when God separates you from other people it leaves a mark people recognize you yes sir you you look you look at look at Rahab in the Bible when them spies come in there what does she tell them we know who you are we know who your God is we know the things that he's done you a lot of you have probably had experiences at work or somewhere else or even sisters come up to you and say there's something different about you where do you go to church sometimes people ask where you go to church just by what you look like sometimes I'll ask you where you go to church because the way you treat others there's something special about you amen but God has separated you why because you are his own but the children of Israel failed to get a revelation of that you know the land that that that God told him he said to push it push it out all the everything that's in your land push it out all the people kill them all kill doubt kill worry everything in your land that hinders you from getting the promise God said to kill it if you got fear in your life you need to kill it if you got worry if you got doubt in your life you need to you need to kill it amen don't let it stay in there that's what happened got the children of Israel what got them later is they said well we'll let give you this little corner over here well let you sit over here you can work for us sometimes and then what God Said do God said kill it yeah get it out of our lives so we get things in our life and we push them in a corner and with a little pill bottle and we accept it we accept the doctor says well you're going to probably have this all your life well okay is there something I can take for it that ain't God's promise to you God's promis that you could be delivered of everything you have need of we rely on ourselves we rely on our own abilities we we rely on doctors more than we do God come on if you've been to doctors around here and enough you know some of the doctors around will tell you I can't heal you but God can they will tell you when I had back surgery right before he put me under Dr Duncan told me he said I cannot heal you but God can heal you they put me under and when they put me under they all got around me and prayed the those staff because he realized he wasn't a Healer and I got healed that way I got healed that way but I refuse God God that's the way God chose for me to push him out of my land but don't let anybody any doctor any person anybody ever tell you you have to live with this now you don't have to live with anything that's not of God you can have deliverance from anything that's not of that's not of God in Exodus 23:30 by little and little I drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land God says I will drive them out why are we not getting things driven out of our life because because we're not allowing God to do it he said the battle is not yours it's mine sayeth the Lord amen he tells them drive them out but he says I will drive them out all you got to do is ask amen God I don't want this in my life you put the Power in me you put the faith in me brother bam said your faith will only go so far but then God's faith takes over why because it's him anyway it ain't you right amen and I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the Sea of the Philistines from the desert unto the river I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee first he says I will drive them out then he says you will drive them out come on now why he is you yes he is you you are him you are one amen I sure hope that there was a marriage that took place yes I sure hope we when we sing the song he became me that I might become him by Grace you have there that has to be a revelation amen if not it's just words fit together with music there has to be a revelation that he becomes you you're joint HS with Christ joint HS you're together everything that he possesses you possess thou shall make make no Covenant with them with their gods they shall not dwell in thy land lest they make uh they make the sin against me and that's what they did and if thou serve their gods ass surely will be a snare unto thee you know when you recognize who you are promises become different yes they become different when you have a full revelation of who you are in the word promises that God Made You just have a different look about them they have a different meaning yes sir faith when real Faith drops in here have you ever had the God just reveal something to you that you prayed for and prayed for and then God settled it in your heart God settles that in your heart and you have something in your heart that just grounds you in faith and you won't budge that's when you realize who you are that's when you realize that it's really not you anyway that's God's faith taken over that's God's faith that anchors it Jehovah Gyra you don't know what you own until you go looking through the Bible to find out the promises they'll keep you from them if they can but they're yours every promise is to Abraham and his seed after him every Divine promise in the word belongs to Abraham and his seed and you're an heir to it I like to look through see what I got you got it all I like to see what I got I like to see what belongs to me too and so many times you might have to remind the devil that's true you might have to remind the devil what belongs to you because sometimes he's got his dirty filthy hands all over it you might have to grab it back and tell him that belongs to me that don't belong to you that Joy belongs to me that peace belongs to me amen that wayward son or daughter belongs to me a well body belongs to me amen thank you I like to look it over I like to look through the Bible and see what belongs to me every Seed of Abraham ought to do that when you become Born Again filled with the spirit of God God and the Holy Spirit unto you you're an heir to every one of them promises you know I I was when you read that reading that that quote you know everything that and I had wrote down here children's bread healing was the children's bread and every time I I hear that phrased the children's bread I think of the saraph phenician woman which we spoke on her last time we was here it wasn't to her Jesus told her that's not for you she refused to accept that she refused to accept healing didn't belong to her Jesus told her no it's not yours I'm not giving it to you that belongs to the that's the children's bread like I said last time if God tells you no ask him again ask him God might be trying your faith come on what what what did he say here no Fai greater Faith have I seen in Israel than this woman even the crumbs that fall from the master's table I'll take a piece of that you don't want to give me the bread Lord give me a crumb just give me a crumb Lord just give me one little touch I'm not asking you to pour out every blessing in heaven on me just give me a little touch Just Breathe on Me a little bit amen you have the right to Healing you have the right to Joy if you can't overcome small things in your life the little battles in your life if you can't overcome them because you're trying to do it yourself you'll never possess them you'll never possess what belongs to you if you can't overcome your trials your test your besetting sins things in your life you know a lot of times when people would come up to get pray prayed for they would have things in their life and brother Brandon would would tell them yes sir you you need to repent of this some we wonder what sometimes well we're not getting what belongs to us check your life check your life to see if there's anything between you and God if there's anything between you and another brother another sister if there's a hindrance there that's might be why you can't overcome that might be why you're not getting delivered because there's something between you and somebody else there's something in your life that's hindering you come on and you know your life better than anybody in Joshua 238 but cleave unto the Lord your God as you have done unto this day for the Lord has driven out from before you great Nations and strong but as for you no man shall be able to stand before you unto this day one man of you shall chase the Thousand for the Lord your God it is he he it is that fighteth for you as Heath promised take good heed there un yourselves that you love the Lord your God if you love him you'll fellowship with him that's true love you say you love your wife you love your husband are are you fellowshipping or is there something in between you yeah I'm going to skip down here kind of going slow here I apologize Poss possessing all things he said oh my I like that believer's promise what's that got to do with it to every believer the believer's promise is eternal life the believer's promise is life joy peace longsuffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit Divine Healing a dozen things that got wrote down here nearly that is your possession it belongs to you if you cannot have it but you cannot have it until you fight for it you got to be willing to fight for it you got to be willing to lay aside everything that keeps you between you and God say God this is what you got to want it more than anything you got to have a desire and sometimes that's what keeps you from getting it is because we don't want it bad enough if we wanted something so bad we would let God deal deal with it instead of us doing it ourselves because so many times we try to do it ourselves and we make a bigger mess than it already is that's right when God says you have when when Prophet said you have to fight for it yes sir he didn't mean your human nature get on your knees and fight for it believe for it possess it it's yours claim it that's what he told the the the children of Israel everywhere your feet go wherever your feet step is is possession it belongs to you you can't step on in anything if you're not moving you can't possess anything if you're standing in one spot you got to start moving your boundaries out you know I might have told this here before years ago but brother Danny Williams most of y'all remember brother Danny Williams he come to our church in Kentucky one time and he's was preaching about boundaries setting boundaries and he would use the microphone stands I might have told this before he would take these and during his sermon he started with both microphone stands right here beside the pull Pit by the time he got done they were on the sides of the church he was talking about how clay the children of Israel God says wherever your footsteps go wherever you walk wherever you trod that belongs to you and he started making examples how you know you've got you've got joy in on the other side of that boundary and you haven't possessed it yet and you have to fight for it you've got to pick up that boundary and you've got to move it right amen you've got to set that boundary on the other side of Joy you've got to set it on the other side of Happiness of Peace you don't possess it unless you got a boundary marker on the other side of it it's not yours until you get your feet and you move and you walk to it healing is not yours until you place a boundary on the other side of it and that boundary Mark is is a Cornerstone of your property this is mine whenever they would put boundary markers they would put these tall Stone pillars and that sign signified that anything in between anything between these boundary markers belongs to me and if they saw something on the other side side of that that God gave them they would move that thing even further well God gave me that too I'm going to go get it God give me Deliverance I'm going to go get it God delivered me from depression he gave me peace I'm going to go get it God delivered me from anxiety I'm going to go get it you can stand in one spot all you want but you'll never possess anything when you're standing in one spot you'll never possess one one promise of God if you're not walking your feet have to stand on your promise sometimes you got to go stand on somebody else's promise to give them Faith you have to have faith for them they might not be able to walk they might be hurting so bad and grieving so bad they can't possess [Music] amen we got to possess what's ours you know I like that story about David David said I want to drink of water from that well in Bethlehem he didn't go possess it but as men said we'll go possess it sometimes you got to fight through a lot of demons for someone else yeah you have to fight we're in a battle right now for sister Erica amen we're in a battle we're going to get to the well we're going to bring her a drink of water amen you might have to kill a lot of demons on the way brother Jimmy you going to have to slay a lot of demons don't ever think that that fight for her is not yours we're all part of the Bride we are one body and we're fighting together I like I like Caleb in the Bible numbers 13 that amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwelt by the Sea and by the coast and Caleb steal the people before God and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but when the men went up with him we be not able to go against the people for they are stronger than we the men were looking at the doctor's report the men were looking at the trial they were looking at the test they were looking at the mountain and everything was on it Caleb was looking at the promise God said he could have it yes sir you can't you can't you you can't just God when God gives you a mountain he ain't going to say well the mountains I cleared it out off for you already there's nothing on it there's no no enemies on the Mountain all you got to do is go up there and build your house and live peacefully for the rest of your life God gives you a possession now he tells you to go get it you might have to fight for it does it belong to you absolutely it does cuz God said it does as Satan going to let you have it more than likely not so you're going to have to fight him every inch of that mountain you're going to have to fight you know I probably 8 nine 10 years ago I did this sermon um climbing the right mountains sometimes it ain't speaking the mountains sometimes God puts that mountain there not so much as you can speak and have it removed and cast into the sea sometimes he puts it there so you'll climb it okay how you going to get stronger as a Christian if you're not fighting how you going to get stronger as a Christian if you're not if you're not climbing if you're not possessing the things that God's put in your life and says this is yours go get it yes sir what he told Caleb this Mountain's yours go get it had am malachit jebusites amorites some of the the the worst enemy in Canaan were on Caleb's Mountain Caleb says I'm more than able more than able let me have it he was excited to go he wanted to show them people on that mountain this is mine you can't have it not only am I going to move you off this mountain I'm going to move you off in a dead body I'm going to kill you I'm not going to leave you up here and I'm not going to let you move to the foot of my Mountain I'm not going to let you move on the on the least side of my Mountain the entire thing belongs to me and there there will not be one live am malachite on it there'll not be one live Amorite on it there'll be no doubt on it there'll be no no fear no worry on it amen there'll be no cancer on it there'll be no besetting sins on it there'll be no lust on it no pornography on it I'm going to clean it off yeah cuz God gave it to me but BR said question ansers 59 before there was a world you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd be wanting it God knew you want it before you knew you'd want it God knew you'd want it and he chose you himself because you desired he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you was on the earth He sent Jesus die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost he knew you'd want the Holy Ghost he knew you'd want something to be able to fight with he knew you would have a desire and the prophet said he killed Jesus to make a way so you can have it does that ever hit us there's one place he said he murdered his own son why so you could have everything he had so you could possess everything that he possessed I'm going to move quickly here are we fighting for our kids are we fighting for our loved ones when you get to pray for your loved ones or your needs or whatever it is does Satan recognize you if you possess everything God does Satan knows who you are right if you don't if you don't you're you're in a tough battle because if you don't possess what he gave you if you haven't taken possession of that yet you're fighting on your own if you don't possess what he gave you in here you're fighting on your own you know look at the sons of St in the Bible they went to go cast out Devils what them Devils tell tell them we know Peter we know Paul we know Jesus who are you who are you yeah when you get down on your knees to pray do they run back to hell and say oh no Brother Jimmy's back on his knees what are we going to do you should live so close to God be so one with what you possess that when you get on your knees all hell is totally confused they have no clue what to do yes sir because they're looking at the possession that you have in here they're looking at the power that you have in here they ain't looking at your flesh when God took his abod in here when you get down to pray and it's God speaking that's all satan sees is God speaking that's all he hears he cannot stand against the name it's in that name by all men are saved and it's in that name that he placed the Holy Ghost in you that's what lives in you that's what fights your battles that's what you possess that gives you everything that God that God has and when you get on your knees to pray you might be driving down the road you might whisper a little prayer all hell trembles yeah Lord help me help help me help help me have a good day Lord you might be 11-year old kid Lord help me on this math test Heaven TR hell trembles yeah hell trembles it it's not the vessel it's what's in the vessel that hell sees amen when you speak [Music] amen it's the power in here that moves cancer yes it's not the power in this this is still going to doubt and this is going to worry we're going to hear a bad report and you're going to it's just going to move you to sadness to fear to doubt to worry but when you possess that Holy Ghost and that fear and that doubt and worry forces you on your knees you can have fear and doubt and worry you might ought to have a chain around their neck and say I'm going to use you you're going to make me doubt you're going to force me on my knees and I'm going to call out to God you can't help human nature that's why this body is not going this flesh it's going to turn to dust you know is like I was saying last time about your theophany you know when brother brand brother brandom said whenever you heard that this word was Eagle food you heard from your theophany and whenever you die and go by the way of the grave and your theophany comes by and speaks brother BR said he your theophany will know exactly where you're buried and will call you from the grave that's not the only two times your theophany is speaking to you on that ain't the only times that your theophany is speaking to you your theophan is telling you you're healed right your theophany is telling you you are delivered you can listen to what this mind says all the time you can listen to what what the doctors report what your financial bank statements you can look at the the the mug shot of your kid because you got arrested for drugs again you can look at that but your theophany is telling you you can possess everything that God gave you amen you don't have to to live in fear have to live in doubt don't wait for your theophany to tell you one time this is Eagle food don't wait for him to tell you to come out of the Grave he's talking to you right now she's talking to you right [Music] now healing is yours Deliverance is yours everything that God has every promise brother B said I'd like to go through the Bible pick up the Bible sometime and go through it look at the promises go look them up every single promise that is for the bride is yours we need to get to the place where we when we hear Bad reports it doesn't mean nothing to us it doesn't mean nothing God's promise always holds true amen always holds true amen why you know why are we not sometimes seeing how God how God sees us brother bam said in Hebrews chapter 6 it's got to be something happened by a birth which comes from God and God brings the new birth into you and gives you a part of himself then the these things are you are New Creation I give unto them Eternal we went through the word Eternal forever is a space of Time Eternity is forever forever and forever there's only one eternity we find out that you receive eternal life the word in the Greek is Zoe which means God's life and you receive part of God's life which makes you a spiritual Son of God you're just as Everlasting as God is Everlasting you have no end no place to stop because you had no place to begin you began you were an eternal thought of God before this body ever came on the earth you in an eternal thought of God you're you will be with God in through eternity you have no beginning and no ending hallu Abraham's seed your heir to it heir of Salvation heir of Divine Healing heir of every Redemptive blessing Jesus died for you are the heir to it for you are Abraham's seed you are the heir of the whole thing he says I feel religious knowing I'm an heir you may think I'm just a little crazy but if I am just leave me alone I'm more happier this way than I was the other way I like this way the best but I know that I'm heir of Salvation heir of every promise when you Pentecostal sing uh you sing every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line then act like it act like it if you said God delivered you show the fruits if you say you're a new person in Christ bear the fruits act like it right one of the first things you can tell if somebody gets the Holy Ghost is their love for other people love for other people you know don't don't uh think that when you get the Holy Ghost you still can't stand certain people makees sure you love everybody brother BR said when God's faith when God's faith drops in here when he that same quote when he said your faith will only go so far God's faith drops in so when you get that Faith he said it makes you love everybody he didn't say you can have healing that's where I thought he was going with it anything you want you can have but he didn't he said it makes you love everybody says then act like it walk around and see what see what you got in here it's all yours your heir to it so walk around take possession it belongs to you God gave it to you what a beautiful promise there let's Stand Together you know we still go back to the scripture in in James 4 you were fighting in a battle you know so many times we we try to take that battle on ourselves and then we we always recite that scripture resist the devil in to flee from you but first it says submit yourself to God you're not going to do much resisting until you've submitted yourself to God and when you submit yourself to God everything you need to resist the devil God's given you prise the Lord everything you need for for healing for deliverance resisting the devil in your flesh the Bible says he's a worthy worthy adversary he's a worthy adversary for this human flesh but against God he's no match and if you and God have become one amen there's no match amen the Lord let's bow our heads I know I jumped around a lot on here but if if you got anything out of what we spoke about this morning and you would say in your heart brother Joe let me I want a better revelation of what I possess I want a better revelation of what belongs to me and I I want more strength strength to possess everything that God's given me Lord Heavenly Father Lord what a wonderful day to serve you what a wonderful day to live for you what a wonderful day to be one with you Lord I pray father every hand that was raised Lord my hand is raised this morning Lord there's so many things that I know that maybe I need help recognizing that I possess that I have need of Lord you

father to fight each other's battles Lord to to go to war for one another as it were when we see our brother our sister in need Lord may we be not just say I'll go fight May we be urgent or may we have a desire as David's men did Lord it was their desire and their love for their King that sent them to that well where they fought through thousands Philistines Lord may we have that urgency as we said Lord the urgency of the four friends that lowered their their friend down the roof and laid him at jesus' feet may we be like that Lord we can't be like that if we've got issues in our lives we can't be like that Lord if we don't recognize what we possess Lord may we possess love one for the other your Prophet said that's what's going to get us out of here is perfect love amen Lord I pray
