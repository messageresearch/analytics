[29:04] me,
[29:07] I'll trust the victory of your cross
[29:11] [music]
[29:12] and fix my eyes upon you, Jes. Jesus,
[29:16] [singing]
[29:18] for you are God and I am not.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Though I [music and singing] can't see
[29:26] what's before me,
[29:30] &gt;&gt; I know [singing] that I can trust your
[29:32] heart.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; And this one truth [singing and music]
[29:37] will be my story.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; You still [singing] reign. You're still
[29:44] God.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[29:47] &gt;&gt; You are good [singing] and you are
[29:49] faithful.
[29:52] As you've been [singing] from the
[29:54] [music] start,
[29:58] you work all things for
[29:59] [singing and music] your glory.
[30:04] You still reign [singing] and you're
[30:05] [music] still God.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, this one truth [singing] will be my
[30:11] story.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:15] &gt;&gt; You still [singing]
[30:19] God. [music]
[30:28] [music]
[30:30] [applause]
[30:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[30:50] [music]
[30:56] &gt;&gt; I've seen a vision [music] harsh and
[31:00] sweet
[31:02] of one who gave all he had for me.
[31:06] [singing]
[31:07] [music]
[31:08] I've seen the passion
[31:10] of his [music] death
[31:14] and [singing] the forgiveness in his
[31:17] final breath
[31:20] now can never [singing]
[31:22] be [music]
[31:23] the same.
[31:26] My [singing] heart has been forever
[31:30] changed. [singing]
[31:31] [music]
[31:32] I've got to live in love and give the
[31:37] way he gave. [singing and music]
[31:44] Now I'm [music] giving my life [singing]
[31:48] away.
[31:50] [music]
[31:51] Laying [singing] it down on the altar.
[31:56] Now [singing] I'm giving [music]
[31:58] my life away.
[32:03] The [singing and music] very least I can
[32:06] offer
[32:08] is my all.
[32:11] [singing]
[32:14] So here I [music] stand today [singing]
[32:18] giving my life away.
[32:23] [singing and music]
[32:26] No earthly price could be
[32:28] [music and singing]
[32:29] too great.
[32:31] No sacrifice
[32:34] too [singing] much to make.
[32:37] No way of measuring [singing and music]
[32:41] the cost
[32:43] next to the blood of Calary's cross.
[32:48] [music]
[32:49] So if I live, I live for him. [singing]
[32:55] Or [music] if I die, I count [singing]
[32:59] it gain.
[33:01] My [music] life is not [singing]
[33:04] my own, but his from this day [singing]
[33:08] on.
[33:11] [music]
[33:13] Now [singing]
[33:14] I'm giving my life away.
[33:21] Laying [singing]
[33:21] [music] it down on the altar.
[33:25] Now I'm giving my life [singing]
[33:29] away.
[33:31] [music]
[33:32] The very least I [singing] can offer
[33:37] is my all.
[33:40] [music]
[33:42] So here I stand today, [music]
[33:47] giving [singing] my life away.
[33:51] [music]
[33:54] Now I'm giving my life away. [music]
[34:01] Laying [singing]
[34:02] it down on the altar.
[34:06] Now I'm giving [music]
[34:08] my life [singing] away.
[34:13] The very least I can offer [music]
[34:17] is [singing] my all.
[34:22] [music]
[34:23] So here I stand today
[34:27] giving [singing]
[34:28] my life [music] away.
[34:34] So [singing] here I stand [music]
[34:37] today
[34:39] giving [singing] my life away.
[34:48] [music]
[34:54] [applause]
[34:55] Amen. We enjoy those specials this
[34:57] evening.
[34:59] Brother Alexander, buddy, I don't know
[35:00] how long you've been hiding that, but
[35:02] you're in trouble now. [music] Amen.
[35:05] Let's all stand. We'll ask Brother
[35:07] Donnie to come and bring us the word of
[35:09] the Lord. Amen. We'll sing Leave it on
[35:11] my mind.
[35:14] The old house
[35:18] that I'm living [singing] in is needing
[35:22] [music]
[35:25] repair. [singing]
[35:28] The windows and
[35:31] the [music] shutters
[35:34] are letting in the cold [singing]
[35:37] cold air.
[35:40] I [music] say to myself, I'm going to
[35:44] fix them.
[35:46] when [singing] I can [music] get
[35:50] the time.
[35:53] But all [singing]
[35:54] I'm getting lately
[35:58] [music]
[36:00] is leaving on [singing]
[36:02] my mind.
[36:06] [music]
[36:07] And lately, all I've got is leaving
[36:12] [music and singing]
[36:13] on my mind.
[36:19] Oh, it seems [singing]
[36:22] that's [music] all I think about
[36:27] [music]
[36:28] so much [singing] of the time.
[36:38] [music]
[36:46] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[36:47] &gt;&gt; I
[36:49] got even
[36:51] [music]
[36:52] [singing]
[36:53] on my mind. Can we sing it together
[36:56] again everybody now? Thank you Lord.
[36:59] [music]
[37:03] Just close your eyes.
[37:06] You're talking about your new home.
[37:08] [music]
[37:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:20] &gt;&gt; So much [music and singing] of my time.
[37:24] I'll be soon and very soon [music]
[37:29] I'll leave [singing]
[37:31] a tr
[37:33] [music] behind.
[37:37] Lately [singing] I got [music] leaving
[37:45] [singing] on my mind. [music]
[37:53] Praise the Lord.
[37:55] Oh my.
[37:57] Well, we realize there's
[38:00] no place quite like home. Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; I've traveled in different parts of the
[38:06] world and seen some beautiful places,
[38:10] some very interesting places, some
[38:13] places that were just places.
[38:16] But there's no place quite like your
[38:21] home.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Might not be that fancy, might not be
[38:24] that big. It might not be anything like
[38:28] the homes you saw when you were gone,
[38:30] but it's yours.
[38:33] And if we feel that way about a natural
[38:36] place,
[38:37] &gt;&gt; what about a place that eye hath not
[38:40] seen, ear not heard, neither hath it
[38:44] entered into the heart of man what God
[38:47] has prepared for us.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; I long to go, don't you?
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Every day that we live in this world is
[38:55] truly becoming a more unfitting place
[38:58] for us to live.
[39:01] If our old age wasn't enough, just all
[39:04] the sin and stuff around us would be
[39:06] enough to make us more homesick.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; But everything we deal with and
[39:10] everything we see around us and knowing
[39:12] that it's going to get worse, it just
[39:14] gives us a greater desire to go.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Let's read about it tonight. Genesis 24.
[39:22] While you're turning there, I certainly
[39:24] want to thank all of you for um your
[39:26] nice cards and gift cards and um
[39:30] different things for pastor appreciation
[39:33] month. I thank you for that.
[39:37] Genesis chap 24 verse one. We'll read um
[39:42] down through verses u 7.
[39:47] And Abraham was old and well stricken in
[39:50] age.
[39:52] And the Lord had blessed Abraham
[39:55] in all things. Now, there's probably
[39:58] times in Abraham's life that he
[40:01] questioned those last three words,
[40:05] in all things.
[40:07] And Abraham said unto his eldest servant
[40:09] of his house that ruled over all that he
[40:14] had, "Put, I pray thee, thy hand under
[40:18] my thigh." Now, this sounds very
[40:20] peculiar and strange to us, but this was
[40:22] the most sacred vow that you could make.
[40:28] So, they'd put it under the thigh, just
[40:30] something like that. And then they would
[40:33] swear, whatever it was,
[40:36] dead wasp. And I will make these swear
[40:40] by the Lord, the God of heaven. I'd
[40:42] rather have him on the floor dead than
[40:43] on top of my head stinging me.
[40:46] You do want me moving by the spirit,
[40:48] right?
[40:52] Where was I?
[40:54] And I will make thee swear by the Lord,
[40:56] the God of heaven, and the God of the
[40:59] earth, that thou shalt not take a wife
[41:03] unto my son of the daughters of the
[41:06] Canaanites,
[41:08] among whom I dwell.
[41:11] But thou shalt go unto my country, and
[41:14] to my kindred,
[41:17] and take a wife unto my son Isaac."
[41:21] Now, to me, these two verses are so
[41:24] strange
[41:25] in the way that they're set forth.
[41:29] So, he points out to the servant. Now,
[41:32] notice what he says, "Thou shalt not
[41:35] take a wife unto my son of the daughters
[41:37] of the Canaanites among whom I dwell."
[41:40] Well, Abraham, what are you doing there
[41:42] then?
[41:44] If these people are so repulsive to you
[41:48] and you don't even want your son to
[41:50] marry any of these daughters, why are
[41:53] you there?
[41:54] Because God led him into that place of
[41:57] trial and test.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; But listen at him now in verse four. But
[42:01] thou shalt go unto my country
[42:06] and to my kindred. What was he saying?
[42:09] I'm not at home at this place.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And take a wife unto my son Isaac. And
[42:17] the servant said unto him, "Per
[42:19] adventure, the woman will not be willing
[42:23] to follow me unto this land."
[42:28] You don't want to be here. It's evident.
[42:30] You don't want to be here. And you're
[42:32] sending me out there to bring a woman
[42:34] here. What if she don't want to come any
[42:35] more than you don't want to? What am I
[42:38] supposed to do?
[42:40] Must I needs bring thy son again unto
[42:44] the land from whence thou camest?
[42:50] So do you want me as the messenger with
[42:52] some message
[42:54] to take your son
[42:58] into what you left?
[43:02] &gt;&gt; You want me to take him back to the
[43:03] denominations, nations, denominations?
[43:07] You want me to return him back to
[43:09] Leodysia Pentecost,
[43:12] Catholicism, Protestantism?
[43:16] And Abraham said unto him, "Beware,
[43:23] beware
[43:25] that thou bring not my son
[43:29] thither again."
[43:31] Every man who preaches this end time
[43:34] message
[43:36] &gt;&gt; needs to keep this before him.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Beware
[43:40] &gt;&gt; that you don't tra try to take this
[43:43] bride
[43:44] back to the country we come out of.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; The Lord God of heaven
[43:55] which took me. Now watch. He's going to
[43:58] bring these verses together. Which took
[44:01] me from my father's house,
[44:06] and from the land of my kindred,
[44:10] and which spake unto me, and that swear
[44:12] unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I
[44:15] give this land. He shall send his angel
[44:22] before thee and thou shalt take a wife
[44:26] unto my son
[44:29] from this. Now this is the answer to his
[44:32] question. So what if she won't come? She
[44:34] will come
[44:36] &gt;&gt; because the angel of the Lord will go
[44:40] before you and you will bring my son a
[44:44] wife into the new land.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; You understand what your land is,
[44:49] friends?
[44:50] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; I'm convinced Satan hates this message
[44:55] right now more than he's ever hated it.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Way back in the 40s and the 50s and the
[45:01] 60s, sure he hated it. But he hates it
[45:03] now more than ever. It's why he's
[45:05] fighting it. So he wants to question the
[45:07] credibility of the messenger. Question
[45:10] the credibility of the message. Why? In
[45:13] order to get you and I to lose the value
[45:17] of this land, our land is the message of
[45:21] this day.
[45:23] Unto thy seed will I give thee this
[45:25] land, and he shall send his angel before
[45:30] thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my
[45:34] son from then. How could he go with such
[45:38] confidence?
[45:40] Because Abraham, which in this parable
[45:42] was a type of God,
[45:44] God told his messenger, "You go and my
[45:48] angel will go before you and you'll not
[45:51] preach in vain. The denominations will
[45:54] throw you out. They'll hate you. They'll
[45:55] get rid of you. But you will bring a
[45:58] bride
[46:00] &gt;&gt; for my son."
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; And where's this bride going back to?
[46:06] Where the father and the son is.
[46:10] Amen.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight?
[46:13] &gt;&gt; How many life to be remembered as we
[46:15] pray together? [clears throat]
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads if you would
[46:19] hold your request in your heart.
[46:23] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads in your
[46:26] divine presence, Father,
[46:29] we're so grateful that we've been given
[46:30] an ear to hear what the spirit is saying
[46:34] in this last day.
[46:36] We realize dear God that only you can
[46:39] illuminate human hearts. Only you can
[46:43] enlighten the spiritual eye. Only you
[46:46] can break open your word and make your
[46:49] word so clear that it will help us to
[46:52] see where we are, where we come from,
[46:56] and where we're going. As we look in the
[46:59] scriptures tonight, we pray, Father,
[47:01] that you would help us, that we would be
[47:04] benefited by looking at these great
[47:07] things. It's a story that has been told
[47:09] so many, many years ago. But to us, it's
[47:14] not just a story of history, but in it
[47:18] is present living truth,
[47:22] which is being lived out by people that
[47:24] are on the face of the earth this very
[47:27] day.
[47:28] speak to us tonight, Father, from your
[47:30] word. We ask it in the name of Jesus
[47:33] Christ. And the saints said,
[47:36] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[47:43] So our father knew that when the angels
[47:49] left his
[47:51] presence
[47:53] and fell from what the New Testament
[47:57] calls an estate.
[48:00] Now we think of an estate as being a
[48:03] house, land, whatever your idea of that
[48:07] would be. You know, if you like horses
[48:09] and you'd think of the white painted
[48:11] fence, or if you like cattle, you'd
[48:12] think of a woven wire or whatever you
[48:15] would think an estate would be, or a
[48:16] fine fancy house and a great subdivision
[48:20] and lighted gates and all that sort of
[48:23] thing. But when we're talking about
[48:26] angelic estates, we're not talking about
[48:30] a palace or a castle made of stone or
[48:33] brick or mortar, but we're talking about
[48:37] a position in a realm which we still
[48:41] understand so very little about.
[48:44] So they were given the ability to
[48:47] appear, disappear. They were given the
[48:51] ability to be able to manifest and come
[48:55] from where they were in eternity when
[48:59] the father created time. And they would
[49:02] be able to merge from eternity into
[49:05] time, go from time back into eternity.
[49:10] They could look at the sphere of the
[49:12] universe, the stars, the planets, all
[49:14] the things that he made and their
[49:17] relation to that. To what extent we
[49:20] don't yet know. So this was the
[49:23] boundaries of their estate. They were
[49:26] given the privilege to stand before
[49:29] God's holy presence.
[49:32] They had never done any wrong up to this
[49:36] time. But they were placed in a similar
[49:39] state that Adam was in the beginning
[49:42] when God placed him on the earth. And it
[49:46] was a state of a lapse of [snorts] time
[49:50] by which they would be able to make a
[49:52] choice. And in there they would forfeit
[49:56] one thing to get another. So when the
[50:00] New Testament writer says that they fell
[50:03] from their former estate and then they
[50:05] were moved into a new sphere that they
[50:08] were held in chains of darkness.
[50:12] Now, God knew that when those angels did
[50:14] that, they actually fell. Of course,
[50:17] before man was brought upon the earth.
[50:21] But God knew that Satan, Lucifer, the
[50:25] lightbringer, morning one, that he would
[50:29] gather them under his opaces, his
[50:33] headship,
[50:35] because he himself would never be able
[50:38] to have a worldwide dominion and a
[50:41] worldwide kingdom if he was the only one
[50:44] in it.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; He's not omnipotent. He does not have
[50:50] omnipresence,
[50:52] omnisientship.
[50:53] He doesn't know all things. He cannot be
[50:56] at all places at one time by his
[50:59] omnipresence.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; So, father knew he would need help.
[51:06] And these angels when they made up their
[51:09] mind,
[51:12] I I I I can't I can't even imagine it
[51:17] that they decided
[51:20] from this day on
[51:23] I will praise him no more.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; From this day forward, I will never love
[51:32] him.
[51:34] I will never give him my all again.
[51:39] This day I walk away
[51:42] from Almighty God and I join my
[51:46] allegiance
[51:48] to Lucifer.
[51:51] From this day I lay aside righteousness,
[51:54] purity, holiness.
[51:56] I lay aside an element of divinity which
[52:00] has been shared with me by Almighty God.
[52:04] I lay aside truth,
[52:08] morality, character, trust,
[52:12] and from this day on I choose darkness.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[52:16] &gt;&gt; immorality,
[52:18] sin, perversion, treachery,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; darkness.
[52:24] This is my choice.
[52:28] I will give my power that God gave to
[52:33] me.
[52:34] I will give my angelic influence,
[52:38] my ability to appear and disappear.
[52:42] I will give it to Lucifer.
[52:46] In the future of whatever lays ahead for
[52:50] God to unfold,
[52:52] I will no longer aid in the kingdom of
[52:56] heaven.
[52:57] I will oppose it with everything I can.
[53:03] I will hate God
[53:06] from this very moment.
[53:08] I will hate everything God loves
[53:12] and everything that God sets his
[53:15] attention toward. I give my all from
[53:19] this day on to despise it,
[53:24] &gt;&gt; to do everything I can to destroy it.
[53:30] They've kept their word.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, they have. Now to me it's one thing
[53:37] for angels to do that for human beings.
[53:41] Now remember there is no redemption for
[53:44] an angel.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Once an angel ever makes that choice
[53:51] they can never come back.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; There's probably people sitting here
[53:57] tonight. I know people actually that
[54:00] have told me before that they gave the
[54:02] devil their soul.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; They turned their soul over to Satan.
[54:12] And then I've had them people ask me,
[54:14] "Do you think there's any way back from
[54:16] me?"
[54:17] And this has been my answer every time.
[54:20] If you want to come back, that's answer
[54:23] enough. There's a way back.
[54:26] But if AN ANGEL WERE TO ASK ME TONIGHT,
[54:30] PREACHER,
[54:32] is there any way for me to get back to
[54:35] God?
[54:39] I would have to stand and look that
[54:41] demon in the face and say, "You crossed
[54:44] the line and you made your choice when
[54:47] you gave up your estate.
[54:51] Therefore, I am against you and I tell
[54:54] you, you are forever separated from the
[54:58] presence of God, and there is no way
[55:01] back for you.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Now, God knew these beings would be
[55:08] quite the enemy.
[55:11] So God started letting the angels, the
[55:15] elect ones, according to what Paul
[55:18] called them in Timothy,
[55:20] as soon as man was brought on the earth,
[55:25] the first angels that we see appear
[55:28] actually not just mystically, but in a
[55:32] visible form were not angels of
[55:35] darkness,
[55:37] but rather angels of light. As a matter
[55:42] of fact, when you study from the Old
[55:43] Testament to the New, the one which
[55:47] takes precedent in the scripture is
[55:51] always the angels of light and purity
[55:56] which appear many more times in the
[55:58] scripture in the visible realm than do
[56:02] fallen angels. Now they do appear of
[56:06] course BUT IT'S AS IF GOD WANTED HIS
[56:09] children to know you are not here alone.
[56:15] Now, I believe that the Lord wants his
[56:18] children to be a little bit more
[56:22] understanding
[56:23] and a little bit, brother Joe, more in
[56:26] tune
[56:27] with this realm that we have access to
[56:32] and these beings that God has already
[56:36] been using all of our whole lives.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT HE WANTS US TO be in more
[56:43] contact with that supernatural realm
[56:45] than we ever have before. You say, "Why
[56:47] would you even say that?" Because we can
[56:50] look around and see for sure that the
[56:53] people of the world are in closer
[56:56] contact with the regions of the lost
[56:59] than they've ever been. Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; We can see that hell has opened up her
[57:06] gates
[57:08] &gt;&gt; and vomited out as it were her influence
[57:12] upon the inhabitants of the earth.
[57:16] Well, if if hell has done that, do you
[57:19] mean to tell me that we as Christians
[57:22] believe hell has done that and heaven
[57:26] has not opened up its gates for the
[57:30] angelic influence that we need as the
[57:33] people OF GOD? THANK GOD for the blood.
[57:36] Thank God for the cross. Thank God for
[57:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But I
[57:41] want to tell you tonight, God knows with
[57:44] all of that awesome thing that I just
[57:47] mentioned to you, there is also another
[57:50] realm
[57:51] &gt;&gt; that he wants to influence our lives
[57:54] daily.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; It's angels.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Read with me in Exodus chapter 14 verse
[58:02] 19. And the angel of God, notice now
[58:07] it's not plural but singular. and the
[58:10] angel of God which went before the camp
[58:13] of Israel removed and went behind them.
[58:18] And the pillar of the cloud went from
[58:21] before their face and stood behind them.
[58:25] Now I want you to notice the angel of
[58:27] God which was in front of the children
[58:30] of Israel, HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY offense
[58:35] and defense.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. So all he did was change his
[58:40] position from being in front of them to
[58:43] moving behind them. And now he's going
[58:47] to blind their enemy. And it was the
[58:51] same angel of God. Well, if he loved
[58:55] them that much, what about you and I?
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Now, notice what he did. that he
[59:01] separated his people from the Egyptians
[59:05] by this angelic presence. And this
[59:09] angelic presence, it made darkness on
[59:12] one side and on the other side it was
[59:15] light by the same angel. Well, it's no
[59:18] paradox to me that the very thing that
[59:21] gives the bride people the light and the
[59:24] illumination of this message, that same
[59:28] angel causes darkness to those who will
[59:31] stumble at it. They'll look right at the
[59:34] very same message and what they see as
[59:37] flaws and mistakes and a human being and
[59:40] they JUST AND THEY STUDY the message for
[59:42] that sort of thing. And you and I study
[59:45] it for rapturing faith. Why? Depends on
[59:48] which side of the pillar of fire you're
[59:50] on.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; And it depends upon whether the angel of
[59:54] GOD WAS FIRST AT your forefront in order
[59:58] to defend you and then moves BEHIND YOU.
[1:00:01] BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND, the only reason he
[1:00:04] moved TO THEIR BACK PART was because the
[1:00:08] enemy was fixing to attack them from
[1:00:12] behind. He had not LEFT THEM. HE ONLY
[1:00:16] CHANGED HIS PLACE of defense because
[1:00:19] that's where they needed it the most at
[1:00:22] the present time. SO SOMETIMES WHEN YOU
[1:00:25] DO NOT SEE THE angel of the Lord in
[1:00:28] front of you and it don't seem like that
[1:00:30] he's leading you very far and leading
[1:00:33] you very fast, it could be that he's
[1:00:36] moved his position behind you because he
[1:00:40] sees your enemy coming up behind you and
[1:00:43] that's where you need him the most.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Can we trust his leadership?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; I believe we can. Notice in 2 Chronicles
[1:00:52] chap 32
[1:00:54] verse 21. And the Lord sent an angel. I
[1:00:58] want you to notice in the Bible that it
[1:01:01] would be said many times that it would
[1:01:03] be more than one. And yet sometimes one
[1:01:07] angel would be able to take care of
[1:01:10] multiplied thousands as we read the
[1:01:13] other example to you a week or so ago.
[1:01:15] And it's amazing to me because it's
[1:01:18] showing to us the angelic hierarchy that
[1:01:23] still exists even though there might
[1:01:26] have been oh my thousands of demons but
[1:01:29] yet one angel of God in the proper order
[1:01:32] of hierarchy could outpower thousands of
[1:01:36] the devil's angels. So the Lord sent an
[1:01:39] angel which cut off all the mighty men
[1:01:43] of valor and the leaders and captains in
[1:01:46] the camp of the king of Assyria. So he
[1:01:50] returned with shame of face to his own
[1:01:54] land. And when he was COME INTO THE
[1:01:57] HOUSE of his god, THEY THAT CAME FORTH
[1:02:01] OF HIS OWN BOWELS slew him there with
[1:02:06] the sword. Now listen, one angel come
[1:02:10] against all the captains and all the
[1:02:12] mighty men and HE CALLS THIS KING. NOW
[1:02:15] THAT ANGEL COULD HAVE KILLED HIM, BUT HE
[1:02:18] CHOSE NOT TO. HE CHOSE to let this king
[1:02:22] return back in shame and humiliation and
[1:02:26] let him go back to the house of his God
[1:02:30] and let someone from his own family kill
[1:02:33] him. Now you believe what you want to
[1:02:35] believe. God still has them same angels
[1:02:38] at your back today.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; NOTICE 1 TIMOTHY 5:21. I CHARGE THEE
[1:02:45] BEFORE GOD and the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:02:49] the elect ANGELS. NOW HERE THE ANGELS OF
[1:02:53] God are brought into the court as it
[1:02:57] were and the magistrate of the first
[1:03:01] church age is bringing them before the
[1:03:05] COURT OF GOD. I CHARGE YOU BEFORE GOD
[1:03:10] AND BEFORE THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND
[1:03:13] before the elect ANGELS THAT THOU
[1:03:17] OBSERVE these things without preferring
[1:03:20] one oh my before another doing nothing
[1:03:24] by partiality. What a charge that Paul
[1:03:28] would charge them not to have respect to
[1:03:31] persons. Isn't that strange and unusual?
[1:03:34] NOW YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT WE AS THE
[1:03:37] PEOPLE OF GOD need to remember that same
[1:03:40] thing that to have respect to persons is
[1:03:43] sin. Right?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; So if this man and that man and that
[1:03:47] man, we treat them in a certain way,
[1:03:49] they get in a certain sin and they do a
[1:03:51] certain THING AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE IN
[1:03:53] THE CHURCH gets caught exactly in the
[1:03:55] same way and we treat them different
[1:03:58] because well maybe they give more in the
[1:04:00] offering or because of this or that or
[1:04:02] the other. ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE, THOSE
[1:04:05] who do that are sinning
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; according to the book of James.
[1:04:11] Now, if there are circumstances in the
[1:04:13] situation, sure, we look at the
[1:04:15] circumstances. But Paul ain't addressing
[1:04:17] difference in circumstances. He's
[1:04:19] identifying with the same scenario, with
[1:04:21] the same setting, and yet you handle it
[1:04:24] different because you like this person
[1:04:26] better or they're kin to a deacon or kin
[1:04:28] to the pastor, you know, however it
[1:04:30] works. NOW NOTICE IT WAS THEN THAT the
[1:04:33] angels of God were brought into the
[1:04:36] court of the magistrate and that Paul is
[1:04:39] now charging the saints of God of that
[1:04:41] day before God, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:04:44] and the elect angels of God. Notice with
[1:04:47] me in Psalm 34:7,
[1:04:50] just in case you're wondering, how do
[1:04:52] the angels of God relate to us? THE
[1:04:56] ANGEL OF THE Lord encampeth round about
[1:05:00] them that fear him
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; and
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; deliverest them.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; Anybody believe this scripture tonight?
[1:05:14] Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you TO NOTICE THE ANGEL OF
[1:05:17] THE LORD. NOT THE angels
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; of the Lord,
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; but the angel of the Lord. This is the
[1:05:27] Lord's angel.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You see, the Lord God himself has an
[1:05:31] angel.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; his theophonyic appearance which
[1:05:39] appeared before Moses and before the
[1:05:42] elders. Anybody know who that was?
[1:05:45] Christ himself.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; It was before he became Jesus.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S ANGEL. IT'S GOD'S ACT OF
[1:05:52] condensation of working himself down to
[1:05:56] take up a human body on THE EARTH. SO
[1:05:59] GOD MADE HIMSELF AN angel or a theophony
[1:06:02] just like he made your theophony before
[1:06:05] he made your body. Yeah,
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me tonight because
[1:06:08] you're made in the exact form or format
[1:06:10] that God chose to make himself.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; So, the angel of the Lord appeared in
[1:06:16] and now remember this could not be said
[1:06:18] about any other angel even in THE ELECT
[1:06:22] ANGELS BECAUSE NOT ONE ANGEL could be
[1:06:25] with every saint of God all over the
[1:06:28] face of the earth.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; NOW, THIS IS NOT YOUR PERSONAL
[1:06:32] THEOPHONY. THIS IS NOT YOUR OWN PRIVATE
[1:06:35] GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT THIS IS THE
[1:06:38] OMNIPOTENT, omnipresent
[1:06:41] angel of God himself.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; I DON'T JUST HAVE AN ANGEL that will
[1:06:47] stand by me and say, "The Lord rebuke
[1:06:50] thee." But the Lord himself can say, "I
[1:06:53] rebuke you, Satan."
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to sing. I'm going to go
[1:06:56] ahead and say it to you right now. I'm
[1:06:57] jumping ahead of myself. BUT EVEN THOUGH
[1:06:59] THESE ANGELS ARE AS GREAT AS THEY ARE,
[1:07:02] YET THERE'S THINGS about the economy of
[1:07:04] God that I have more jurisdiction than
[1:07:07] an angel does.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Not only me, BUT EVERY SON AND DAUGHTER
[1:07:13] OF GOD THAT'S FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[1:07:14] GHOST. YOU HAVE BEEN GIVEN THINGS that
[1:07:17] angels cannot touch.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; NOW, WANT YOU NOTICE WHENEVER MEN OF GOD
[1:07:25] HAVE TO STAND UP AND PRAY. THE EXAMPLE
[1:07:28] IN THE NEW TESTAMENT IS NOT THAT THEY
[1:07:30] WOULD DO as the angels did in the Old
[1:07:33] Testament AND SAY, "THE LORD REBUKED
[1:07:35] THEE." But they stood there themselves
[1:07:37] and said, "In the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:07:39] I resent you. I rebuke you. Come out."
[1:07:42] What happened, Harry? HOW COULD MORTAL
[1:07:45] MEN STAND ON THE earth and not invoke
[1:07:48] the presence or the name of God in the
[1:07:51] same way an angel could? An angel CANNOT
[1:07:53] DO THAT
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S NOT UNDER THE BLOOD.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS NOT SHARING HIS NAME WITH AN
[1:08:02] angel in the same way he is with sons
[1:08:05] and daughters of God.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my. LISTEN TO THIS. THE PROPHET SAYS
[1:08:11] IT THIS WAY. MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD
[1:08:14] ENCAMP about everyone here. MAY THE
[1:08:17] GREAT POWER OF THE RESURRECTED LORD
[1:08:19] JESUS JUST shadow over. MAY THE ANGELS
[1:08:23] OF GOD, I LOVE THIS, SPLIT their wings
[1:08:28] over THIS BUILDING
[1:08:30] AND they distill
[1:08:33] do drops
[1:08:35] of divine healing.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Drop on every sick person.
[1:08:41] MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD SPLIT THEIR WINGS
[1:08:44] AND may they distill dew drops. THANK
[1:08:48] YOU LORD. DISTILL DEW DROP DROPS OF
[1:08:52] DIVINE HEALING DROP ON EVERY SICK
[1:08:55] PERSON. I WANT YOU TO NOTICE NOW THE
[1:08:58] PROPHET WOULD actually make angelic
[1:09:01] visitation a part of the way that he
[1:09:05] prayed for their services TO GO. SO HE
[1:09:09] DIDN'T JUST ASK, "LORD JESUS, PLEASE
[1:09:11] COME. LORD JESUS, COME AND BE WITH US."
[1:09:13] BUT OVER and over again, HE WOULD PRAY,
[1:09:16] "LORD, LET your angels come. Let them
[1:09:18] energize. Let them DO THIS. LET THEM DO
[1:09:21] THAT. LET them do that." I wonder how
[1:09:23] many of us do that.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; DO WE EVEN PRAY FOR THE ANGELS OF GOD TO
[1:09:30] COME
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; and be in our midst?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, saints. NOW,
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; MAY THE ANGELS OF GOD SPLIT THEIR WINGS
[1:09:39] OVER THIS BUILDING. NOW, REMEMBER, IT'S
[1:09:41] NOT SAID IN THE Bible
[1:09:44] that all angels
[1:09:47] have wings.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE ONE THE PROPHET
[1:09:52] SAW, he never mentioned no wings on them
[1:09:55] at all.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; But apparently, there are some THAT DO.
[1:10:04] NOW HE SAID, "MAY PARDON
[1:10:07] from sin
[1:10:09] drop on every sinner." CAN YOU IMAGINE
[1:10:11] RIGHT HERE IN THE BUILDING TONIGHT ARE
[1:10:13] THE ANGELS OF God and THEY'RE WANTING TO
[1:10:16] SPLIT THEIR WINGS RIGHT HERE IN THIS
[1:10:18] SERVICE AND BRING down the distilled
[1:10:22] drops of healing for everyone that's
[1:10:25] sick. AND IF THERE'S A PERSON HERE
[1:10:27] THAT'S LOST OUT OF THE PRESENCE OF GOD,
[1:10:30] THEY WANT TO DROP MERCY. Oh hallelujah.
[1:10:34] PARDON THE SIN DROP ON EVERY SINNER. MAY
[1:10:37] THEY BE SAVED AND BE HEALED. FOR WE ASK
[1:10:41] IN THE NAME OF THY beloved child Jesus
[1:10:44] Christ. AMEN. SO HE WOULD ACTUALLY PRAY
[1:10:47] AND I AND I'VE been saying the last
[1:10:49] couple OF WEEKS AND FOUND ONE prayer
[1:10:51] after ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER THAT HE
[1:10:53] WOULD ASK THE LORD to send the angels
[1:10:56] and let the angels do this and the
[1:10:58] angels do that. And I began to ponder.
[1:11:00] I'm thinking, MY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
[1:11:02] AWESOME BECAUSE IT WAS ELEAZAR that was
[1:11:06] sent with a message and HE COULD TAKE
[1:11:09] ASSURANCE BECAUSE ABRAHAM HAD ALREADY
[1:11:12] TOLD HIM THE ANGEL of God is going to go
[1:11:14] before you. So whenever Rebecca goes
[1:11:16] down, another prophet tells us that he
[1:11:18] believed that the ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:11:20] SPOKE TO REBECCA DOWN THERE ABOUT 30
[1:11:22] MINUTES BEFORE ELEAZAR EVER GOT THERE.
[1:11:25] So the Lord was moving on both ends OF
[1:11:28] THE SPECTRUM. AND HOW WAS IT THAT IT WAS
[1:11:30] COMING to pass? Angels of God.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT, WE'RE NOT
[1:11:37] GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS JOURNEY
[1:11:40] WITHOUT angelic assistance.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. SATAN WILL NEVER BE
[1:11:47] ABLE TO CULMINATE HIS HEADSHIP in the
[1:11:50] earth AND BECOME WHAT HE WANTS TO BE
[1:11:54] WITHOUT ANGELIC ASSISTANCE. DON'T YOU
[1:11:57] UNDERSTAND? EVEN IN THE REALM OF
[1:11:59] POLITICS AND ELECTIONS AND SO ON, DEMONS
[1:12:02] GET ON PEOPLE. DEMONS WILL GET ON PEOPLE
[1:12:06] AND PEOPLE WILL RAISE UP AND BECOME
[1:12:08] LEADERS. And it absolutely astounds, you
[1:12:11] know, the the politicians CUZ THEY SAY,
[1:12:13] "HOW COULD THAT PERSON HAVE EVER raised
[1:12:16] up to BECOME THIS OR THAT? THERE'S NO
[1:12:18] WAY TO BELIEVE THAT it could even
[1:12:20] happen." Demonic power. DEMONS WILL GET
[1:12:23] ON THEM AND THEN THEM other demons WILL
[1:12:25] GET ON OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY'LL RALLY
[1:12:27] AROUND THEM and rally around them and
[1:12:28] they're not EVEN REALLY A GREAT
[1:12:30] POLITICIAN. THEY DON'T HAVE TO. THEY
[1:12:32] DON'T HAVE TO EVEN BE THAT DEMONS GET ON
[1:12:35] THEM. WELL, WE CAN SEE THE negative
[1:12:37] side. What about the positive side? IF
[1:12:41] DEMONS CAN DO THAT, CANNOT THE ANGELS OF
[1:12:43] GOD BE ABLE TO COME AMONG US AND BE ABLE
[1:12:46] TO DISTILL THE DEW DROPS OF GOD'S GRACE
[1:12:49] and mercy to us as we need them.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; NOTICE AGAIN HE SAID NOW LORD REALIZING
[1:12:55] THAT STANDING NEAR THERE'S PERHAPS MANY
[1:13:00] many angels. Now this is the reason why
[1:13:04] he would say they were there
[1:13:07] cuz there's believers here.
[1:13:13] NO DOUBT THERE'S MANY, MANY ANGELS HERE
[1:13:16] CUZ THERE'S BELIEVERS HERE. SO YOU MEAN
[1:13:19] ANGELS GO TO CHURCH, TOO?
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; GOD GOES TO CHURCH. BELIEVERS GO TO
[1:13:24] CHURCH. And angels go to church cuz we
[1:13:26] come to church.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; SO THE ANGELS DON'T JUST COME IN HERE
[1:13:29] AND HANG AROUND AND SAY, "MAN, ain't
[1:13:30] this church nice? This is so cool." They
[1:13:32] show up on Monday. They just sit here
[1:13:34] all day on Monday and Tuesday and just
[1:13:35] say, "This is really a nice place. This
[1:13:37] is really comfortable. I LIKE BEING
[1:13:38] HERE. THEY'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE OF THAT.
[1:13:41] THEY'RE HERE because of you.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; OH MY. CUZ THERE'S BELIEVERS HERE. AND
[1:13:48] THE BIBLE says the angels OF GOD ARE
[1:13:50] ENCAMPED. NOT GOING BACK AND FORTH, BUT
[1:13:54] THEY'RE ENCAMPED ABOUT THOSE THAT FEAR
[1:13:56] HIM. MANY MORE
[1:14:00] ARE BEING CALLED FROM GLORY TONIGHT
[1:14:04] TO ENCAMP AROUND THOSE WHO RAISE their
[1:14:08] hand
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; to teach them the way of life,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; how they should live.
[1:14:16] SO YOU MEAN THE ANGELS OF GOD WHEN A
[1:14:19] PERSON WOULD GET SAVED, THEY WERE BEING
[1:14:22] CALLED. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WHY? A
[1:14:25] NEW POST OF DUTY WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO
[1:14:28] THEM. AND WHERE WAS IT? PEOPLE THAT JUST
[1:14:30] GAVE THEIR HEART TO GOD. AND THEM ANGELS
[1:14:33] ARE GOING TO HELP THEM ALONG IN LIFE TO
[1:14:37] DO WHAT? TO TEACH THEM THE WAY OF LIFE,
[1:14:40] HOW THEY SHOULD LIVE.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU MEAN angels are GOING TO ASK
[1:14:45] SO is the angel going to take a MESSAGE
[1:14:46] BOOK AND SET UP IN THE PULL PIT OR OR
[1:14:49] TAKE A MESSAGE TAPE OR OR YOUR BIBLE and
[1:14:52] you and the ANGEL HAVE BIBLE STUDY AT
[1:14:54] HOME? NO. BUT THERE WILL BE A MAN
[1:14:56] ANOINTED BY THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND GOD
[1:15:00] WILL SEND HIS ANGEL TO HIM TO ELIMINATE
[1:15:02] HIS WORD AND THEN THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL
[1:15:05] SEND YOURS AND THE ANGELIC BEINGS ARE
[1:15:08] CONNECTING WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE
[1:15:10] LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER AND SAY, "FEED
[1:15:12] ME, LORD. FEED ME, LORD. HELP ME DENY
[1:15:14] JESUS. I GOT NEEDS. I GOT THAT. AND THEN
[1:15:17] DON'T YOU THINK, WELL, IT'S JUST I I'M
[1:15:19] PRAYING. I'M PRESSING IN. THANK GOD YOU
[1:15:21] NEED TO DO THAT. BUT REMEMBER, YOU GOT
[1:15:23] SOMEBODY STANDING BY YOU.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT HALLELUJAH. YOU GOT SOMEBODY
[1:15:28] THAT'S STANDING RIGHT THERE BY YOU AND
[1:15:30] THEY'RE TRYING TO NUDGE YOU ALONG. YOU
[1:15:32] BETTER BELIEVE, FRIENDS, DEMONS COME TO
[1:15:34] THE HOUSE OF GOD, TOO. AND THEY'LL
[1:15:36] OCCUPY YOUR MIND. THEY'LL GET YOU ALL
[1:15:38] BUSY ABOUT THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER.
[1:15:41] YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR WORK
[1:15:42] TOMORROW. YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS OR
[1:15:44] THAT. THAT'S DEMONS. BUT ON THE OTHER
[1:15:46] SIDE, THERE'LL BE SOMETHING THERE. KEEP
[1:15:48] FOCUSED. KEEP YOUR MIND ON THE WORD.
[1:15:51] KEEP LOOKING. KEEP PRAISING GOD. AND
[1:15:53] YOU'RE THINKING THAT'S YOU SAYING THAT
[1:15:55] THAT AIN'T YOU. IT'S THE ANGEL OF GOD.
[1:15:59] THEY'RE CAMPING ROUND ABOUT YOU. THEY'RE
[1:16:01] TRYING TO ENERGIZE YOU. THEY'RE TRYING
[1:16:03] TO ENCOURAGE YOU.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here by this
[1:16:16] sacred desk.
[1:16:19] I found it amazing how many times
[1:16:20] brother Brandham used this word sacred
[1:16:23] desk,
[1:16:26] sacred [snorts] place,
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; sacred pullpit. He used his words over
[1:16:31] and over and over again. SO IF IT'S THE
[1:16:34] SAME STAYING AT HOME AND PLAYING A TAPE,
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; wonder why he didn't call it a sacred
[1:16:38] tape player.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Wonder why he didn't sell you sitting in
[1:16:41] your your recliner. He said there's a
[1:16:43] sacred lazy boy.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; There's a sacred stereo.
[1:16:52] WHY WOULD HE CALL A PIECE OF WOOD USED
[1:16:56] IN A CHURCH A SACRED DESK? BECAUSE THE
[1:17:00] PRESENCE of God is there anointing men
[1:17:02] to speak THE WORD. AND THAT MAKES IT
[1:17:05] SACRED. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME YOU
[1:17:06] CAN BE JUST AS GOOD A CHRISTIAN SAYING
[1:17:08] AT HOME AS YOU COME THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:17:10] NOT ACCORDING TO WHAT MALACHI 4 says.
[1:17:12] YOU CAN'T DO IT.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOUR HOME, SURE, YOUR HOME
[1:17:16] OUGHT TO BE SANCTIFIED FOR THE LORD.
[1:17:18] YES, IT SHOULD BE. BUT SHOW ME ONE TIME
[1:17:20] WHERE HE EVER SAID YOUR COUCH WAS
[1:17:22] SACRED, YOUR RECLINER WAS SACRED, YOUR
[1:17:24] KITCHEN TABLE WAS SACRED. YOU'LL NEVER
[1:17:27] REPLACE THE HOUSE OF GOD WITH YOUR
[1:17:30] HOUSE.
[1:17:33] [applause]
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice how he says this.
[1:17:42] There's believers here and the Bible
[1:17:43] said the angels of God are in camp, NOT
[1:17:45] GOING BACK AND FORTH. SO THE ANGELS JUST
[1:17:48] DON'T GO BACK AND FORTH. They camp
[1:17:50] around you. They set up their tents.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, they're with you.
[1:17:55] They're encamped
[1:17:57] about you.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD. MANY MORE ARE BEING
[1:18:03] CALLED FROM GLORY.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; WELL, I guess I've got one question.
[1:18:08] Who's calling them?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Them people that just got saved.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BEING CALLED FROM GLORY. THE
[1:18:22] NIGHT I GOT SAVED, I call one from
[1:18:25] glory.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; THE NIGHT YOU GOT SAVED, THE NIGHT YOU
[1:18:28] GOT SAVED, THE NIGHT YOU GOT SAVED, YOU
[1:18:31] GETTING SAVED SETTING YOU ON YOUR
[1:18:33] JOURNEY, CAROL, YOU [screaming] CALL THE
[1:18:35] ANGEL OF GOD AND HE'S NEVER LEFT YOU.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE HOW MANY TIMES WE
[1:18:42] FALL SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD.
[1:18:44] [screaming] HALLELUJAH. WE MAY PULL AWAY
[1:18:46] FROM HIM, BUT HE DON'T NEVER PULL AWAY
[1:18:49] FROM US BECAUSE HE IS A SIGN TO US AND
[1:18:53] HE WILL NEVER LEAVE US, BROTHER, SISTER.
[1:18:55] NO MATTER HOW [screaming] LOW WE GET,
[1:18:57] HOW SICK WE GET, HOW DOWN WE GET, THEY
[1:19:00] ARE CALLED HERE BY US AT OUR NEW BIRTH.
[1:19:04] AND THERE'S ONLY ONE REASON THEY WILL
[1:19:06] LEAVE, AND THAT'S WHEN THEY TAKE US
[1:19:09] HOME.
[1:19:11] THEY ARE WITH US THROUGH OUR LIFE'S
[1:19:13] JOURNEY. [applause]
[1:19:16] THIS IS PART OF YOUR DOWY,
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; REBECCA.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here by this sacred desk.
[1:19:29] This is a wonderful moment.
[1:19:32] The angels of God
[1:19:36] have set down their camps
[1:19:38] along the side of this place tonight.
[1:19:40] First written in the word, the angels OF
[1:19:43] GOD ARE ENCAMPED ABOUT THOSE THAT FEAR
[1:19:45] HIM. AND IN THE GREAT UNSEEN world
[1:19:49] that is now around us,
[1:19:52] stirring
[1:19:54] our emotions
[1:19:57] to repentance.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; So you mean angels, brother D, move our
[1:20:04] emotions.
[1:20:10] I know there's some of people around the
[1:20:11] message that hate emotions. THEY DON'T
[1:20:14] WANT NO EMOTIONS IN THEIR CHURCH.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; BUT I I QUOTE WHAT THE PROPHET SAID. ANY
[1:20:19] ANY RELIGION WITHOUT EMOTIONS DEAD NEED
[1:20:21] TO BE BURIED.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; THE ANGELS OF GOD, DEMONS WILL ANOINT
[1:20:27] PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS OUT HERE.
[1:20:30] THEY WILL HAVE PROTESTS AND RIOTS AND
[1:20:33] THEY GO TO BALL GAMES AND MY TURNS FROM
[1:20:35] A BALL GAME TO A BRAWL. DON'T YOU
[1:20:37] UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES THAT? DEMON SPIRITS
[1:20:40] GET AMONG THEM AND THEN DEMONS SEE THE
[1:20:43] OPPORTUNITY TO TURN THIS INTO A BRAWL
[1:20:46] AND A BIG RIOT. WHY? TO KILL SOMEBODY,
[1:20:50] TO INJURE SOMEBODY. WHAT'S DOING IT?
[1:20:52] DEMONS MOVING THE EMOTIONS OF THEM
[1:20:55] PEOPLE.
[1:20:57] IF DEMONS CAN DO THAT TO A ROWDY CROWD,
[1:21:00] WHAT ABOUT THE ANGELS OF GOD TO SANCTIFY
[1:21:03] PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE LORD? CAN NOT THOSE
[1:21:07] ANGELS OF GOD MOVE OUR EMOTIONS TO
[1:21:11] REPENTANCE?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. STIRRING OUR EMOTIONS
[1:21:17] TO REPENTANCE AND TO BRING EVIL BEFORE
[1:21:21] OUR EYES.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; SO THE ANGELS OF GOD WILL OPEN
[1:21:25] [screaming] OUR EYES AND HELP US to see
[1:21:27] this is wrong, that's wrong.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; That we have done wrong with penitent
[1:21:34] tears.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; We surrender our evil ways, Lord, and
[1:21:40] ask FOR DIVINE MERCY. MAY THE HOLY
[1:21:42] SPIRIT WHO HAS PROMISED THIS MERCY GIVE
[1:21:44] IT TO EACH OF US AS WE HUMBLY BEG
[1:21:49] and ask God to fulfill his word and to
[1:21:52] mold our lives and our character to fit
[1:21:56] his word.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Tell us that many TIMES FRIENDS THE
[1:22:02] EMOTIONAL STIR that you feel and you
[1:22:05] don't want nobody to see it. Would you
[1:22:06] say well what will my friends say? I
[1:22:08] DON'T CARE WHAT my friends say. AMEN.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; DO YOU UNDERSTAND? SOMETIMES WHAT YOU'RE
[1:22:13] FEELING, IT'S AN angel of the Lord
[1:22:15] standing right there by you,
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; MOVING YOU TO CRY, MOVING YOU TO RAISE
[1:22:20] YOUR HANDS, AND you're ashamed to touch.
[1:22:23] I SAY, SHAME ON US,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; SHAME ON US. ANGEL OF GOD WILL NEVER
[1:22:28] MOVE US TO DO ANYTHING contrary to his
[1:22:30] word.
[1:22:37] in the church house.
[1:22:41] Not in your house, but in the church
[1:22:43] house,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; I believe the angels of God encamp
[1:22:49] around
[1:22:50] because
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; of the saints
[1:22:56] gathering there,
[1:23:00] [snorts]
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; brother Donnie, do I have to be in
[1:23:02] church? Won't my angel go with me at
[1:23:04] home? Yep, sure will. That's right.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; But you and your wife and your two young
[1:23:08] ones, how many angels you figure you got
[1:23:11] there?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; All right. So, if y'all bring your
[1:23:15] angels to church
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; with the rest everybody else bringing
[1:23:18] their angels to church, then look around
[1:23:20] here tonight.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; How many more angels we got than if
[1:23:23] you'd stayed home?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; So, the two hosts
[1:23:32] have gathered tonight. Mayhem
[1:23:36] the angelic host and the earthly host.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, [groaning] hallelujah.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; NOTICE OF GOD. HE SAID THE SAINTS OF GOD
[1:23:48] HERE ARE GATHERED THERE. IT'S A noted
[1:23:52] place
[1:23:54] for God
[1:23:57] where he comes
[1:23:59] and meets
[1:24:01] with his people.
[1:24:04] SO YOU MEAN A CHURCH THAT'S DEDICATED to
[1:24:06] the Lord is a noted place
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; TO GOD
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; WHERE HE COMES AND MEETS WITH HIS PEOPLE
[1:24:15] IS ALWAYS SEEMED kindly
[1:24:18] good to me
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; to be in the living room with a bowl of
[1:24:22] ice cream and a glass of good old
[1:24:26] southern sweet tea you're amending
[1:24:28] brother Donnie from your favorite CH
[1:24:31] EXCUSE ME AMEN BROTHER DONNIE PREACH IT,
[1:24:33] BROTHER. I'M WITH YOU. I'M BEHIND YOU.
[1:24:35] YEAH. Way behind me.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; WAY behind me.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; SO YOU MEAN IT'S A NOTED PLACE OF GOD.
[1:24:44] AND HERE [screaming] OUR prophet
[1:24:49] said, "It's always seemed kind of good
[1:24:52] to me
[1:24:54] to be in a church. I don't understand
[1:24:55] people who claim they have the Holy
[1:24:56] Ghost." Then I ain't talking about if
[1:24:58] they're sick. I ain't talking about if
[1:24:59] they go to church to go to. I'm talking
[1:25:00] about they got churches to go to, but
[1:25:03] they think they're doing the will of God
[1:25:04] by staying home and pushing play.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Preach, brother D.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD ASSIGNED these angels
[1:25:16] their position.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I just think about it, you
[1:25:21] think I'm crazy anyway, but sometimes I
[1:25:23] wonder what my angel done before I come
[1:25:26] along.
[1:25:32] I MEAN, IT'S ASSIGNED TO ME.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; AND I JUST CAN'T KEEP FROM BELIEVING THE
[1:25:39] ANGEL THAT'S BEEN ASSIGNED TO ME is more
[1:25:42] powerful than the demons that have been
[1:25:43] assigned to me from the other side to
[1:25:45] try to wear me down.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't believe God. Give me a
[1:25:50] little T90 amp of an angel. It goes
[1:25:52] around like this. Oh, Jesus. Jesus. I'm
[1:25:55] scared of them demons. No, I can't
[1:25:58] believe that. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOD
[1:25:59] ASSIGNED THE PROPHET OF GOD, A LITTLE
[1:26:01] OLD PUNY ANGEL ABOVE WHEN HE WALKED in
[1:26:04] that room, 200 LB OLIVE OLIVE COLORED
[1:26:07] SKIN, standing there with his arms
[1:26:09] cross, HE MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE A MIGHTY
[1:26:11] ONE. COME ON, SOMEBODY. I DON'T BELIEVE
[1:26:13] YOUR ANGEL IS SOME TYPE OF LITTLE WEAK
[1:26:16] little tiny THING THAT'S HERE TONIGHT
[1:26:18] AND ROLLS OVER AT EVERY LITTLE DEVIL.
[1:26:20] THE ONLY ONE THAT ROLLS OVER IS US
[1:26:23] BECAUSE WE DON'T IDENTIFY. YOU'VE GOT AN
[1:26:26] ANGEL OF GOD THAT GOES WITH YOU TO
[1:26:28] WALMART. HE GOES WITH YOU TO THE GROCERY
[1:26:30] STORE. HE GOES WITH YOU ON VACATION. HE
[1:26:34] GOES WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO TO CHURCH. OH,
[1:26:36] HALLELUJAH. HE'S ASSIGNED TO [screaming]
[1:26:38] YOU.
[1:26:41] [applause]
[1:26:46] FATHER,
[1:26:49] may the Holy Spirit come near.
[1:26:52] May that same pillar of fire that led
[1:26:54] the children of Israel
[1:26:57] move down,
[1:26:59] settle around the holy place,
[1:27:02] this pulpit.
[1:27:08] May your angels of God
[1:27:12] take their position and places
[1:27:16] positionally
[1:27:19] out among
[1:27:21] the people.
[1:27:26] DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY'RE NOT JUST
[1:27:29] WITH THE PREACHERS,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:27:32] THEIR POSITION IS NOT FOR ALL OF THEM TO
[1:27:34] BE WITH ME.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; But you,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; POSITIONALLY OUT AMONG THE people
[1:27:50] speaking to their hearts,
[1:27:53] getting them
[1:27:56] to believe.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] It's perfectly
[1:28:03] predestination.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; The prophet says in question answer 64,
[1:28:09] it's not promised that sinners has
[1:28:12] angels,
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; only the redeemed. Right.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY TIMES WOULD WE STAGGER AND
[1:28:20] STUMBLE OVER THE WORD OR THE WILL OR THE
[1:28:25] GREAT PROGRAM OF GOD
[1:28:27] AND SOMEWHERE A VOICE OUTSIDE OF US,
[1:28:31] OUTSIDE of our own intellect would say,
[1:28:34] "Believe.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Believe."
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[1:28:43] And a lot of you for years have been
[1:28:46] thinking that's you.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; It's not you, it's yours.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Your you part is like my you part. It
[1:28:58] ain't no good sometimes.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And it'll doubt and it'll question and
[1:29:02] it'll, you know, I don't understand. I
[1:29:04] don't understand. But yours, yours will
[1:29:07] come and say, believe. Believe. What's
[1:29:10] it doing? Accumulating faith. The
[1:29:12] prophet said there in one place that
[1:29:14] there was a warfare going on. Streaks
[1:29:16] was ALL OVER THE BUILDING AND THEM
[1:29:17] DEMONS THERE WAS SAYING KEEP THEM FROM
[1:29:20] BELIEVING. KEEP THEM FROM BELIEVING. NOW
[1:29:22] YOU imagine living in a world where you
[1:29:24] would hear this and you'd hear them
[1:29:26] DEMONS AND THEY KNEW THE DEVILS HAVE GOT
[1:29:29] ENOUGH SENSE TO KNOW. NOW A LOT OF THE
[1:29:30] MESSAGE FOLKS DON'T BELIEVE IN GATHERING
[1:29:32] TOGETHER BUT IT SHOWS HOW DUMB THEY ARE
[1:29:35] BECAUSE DEMONS GATHER TOGETHER FOR
[1:29:37] STRENGTHS.
[1:29:39] AMEN.
[1:29:41] THEY GATHERED TOGETHER AND HE SAID
[1:29:43] WHENEVER THEY'D STAND THERE, YOU KNOW
[1:29:45] WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE DISCERNMENT
[1:29:47] SOMEBODY UP HERE HAVE CANCER AND THAT
[1:29:49] DEVIL WOULD GET SCARED AND GO TO CALLING
[1:29:52] ON SOMEBODY ELSE OUT THERE AND IT WOULD
[1:29:54] RUN A STREAK FROM HERE TO THERE. THIS
[1:29:57] [screaming] DEVIL TOLD ON THAT DEVIL.
[1:29:59] I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHEN THEY GOT BACK
[1:30:01] DOWN IN HELL IF THEY DIDN'T DUKE IT OUT.
[1:30:03] SAID, "WHY IN THE WORLD YOU DO THAT TO
[1:30:05] ME? HE HADN'T EVEN SEEN ME YET. YOU
[1:30:08] CHICKEN. YOU LITTLE COWARD. YOU
[1:30:09] [screaming] YOU TOLD HIM EXACTLY WHERE I
[1:30:12] WAS. I LOVE IT THOUGH. SO INSTEAD OF ONE
[1:30:14] DEVIL BEING CAST OUT, TWO GOT CAST OUT.
[1:30:18] [applause]
[1:30:20] THEY REALIZED THEIR STRENGTH AND THEM
[1:30:23] COMING TOGETHER. ALL SAINTS OF GOD.
[1:30:25] CAN'T YOU SEE WHY WE NEED TO ASSEMBLE
[1:30:28] OURSELVES TOGETHER?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:35] Oh [laughter] my.
[1:30:37] Notice what they do. Speaking to their
[1:30:42] hearts,
[1:30:44] getting them
[1:30:46] to believe.
[1:30:48] TAKE AWAY ALL UNBELIEF. MAY IT GO FROM
[1:30:51] THIS BUILDING TONIGHT THAT IT might be a
[1:30:53] great marvelous
[1:30:57] meeting.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:31:02] be well with us. Lord,
[1:31:05] we realize that opposition
[1:31:08] stands close. Satan is raging.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is trying to settle in
[1:31:18] upon the people.
[1:31:20] Unbelief is trying to settle in on the
[1:31:25] people. But now notice how he prays.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Yet the angels are at their position.
[1:31:32] YES,
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE STANDING READY.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; EVEN THE BLACK FLAGS will wave
[1:31:41] or the white flags of heaven
[1:31:44] will wave.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; And victory.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; You imagine every service this place is
[1:31:53] full
[1:31:56] and there's beings there waving their
[1:31:59] flags.
[1:32:01] keep them from believing. Oh, it's too
[1:32:03] hot in there. IT'S TOO COLD. OH GOD, I'M
[1:32:05] ABOUT to die. I'm going outside. Oh
[1:32:07] Lord, I can't sit still. OH GOODNESS, I
[1:32:08] DID. I LEAVE MY CURLING IRON ON. OH NO,
[1:32:11] I LEFT the crockpot on. OH MY GOODNESS.
[1:32:13] DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS?
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER DONNIE STORING THAT STRAIGHT
[1:32:18] AT YOU. HE DON'T LIKE YOU IN THE FIRST
[1:32:20] PLACE. YOU KNOW HE AIN'T SHOOK YOUR HAND
[1:32:21] AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN.
[1:32:22] DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S TALKING TO
[1:32:24] YOU?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; IF YOU COULD SEE THE FACE OF THAT DEMON
[1:32:28] IS SCARING YOU TO DEATH. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:32:32] BUT AT the same time, the angels of God
[1:32:34] are saying, "This is your night.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Believe, listen, focus on the word.
[1:32:39] Tonight is your night of deliverance."
[1:32:41] Glory to God. I believe it myself.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH TO GOD. AND RIGHT THERE, THAT
[1:32:46] WAR IS GOING ON. THEM DEMONS ARE WAVING
[1:32:48] THEIR BLACK FLAG AND THE ANGELS OF GOD
[1:32:50] ARE SEND. COME ON, SAINTS. RALLY AROUND
[1:32:52] THE BANNER. RALLY AROUND THE BLOOD
[1:32:55] STAINED BANNER OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:32:57] YOU KNOW WHAT A FLAG IS, DON'T YOU? IT'S
[1:32:59] A BANNER BY WHICH YOU'VE GOT TO BE
[1:33:01] IDENTIFIED. THE DEVIL WAVES THEIR BLACK
[1:33:03] FLAGS OF UNBELIEF AND FEAR AND DOUBT AND
[1:33:06] FRUSTRATION. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
[1:33:07] SIDES WITH ONE OR THE OTHER. I SAY RIGHT
[1:33:11] HERE TONIGHT, WE TAKE OUR SIDES WITH THE
[1:33:14] FLAG OF THE HEAVENLIES. THE ANGELS OF
[1:33:16] GOD ARE WAVING THE WHITE FLAGS OF
[1:33:19] HEALING AND DELIVERANCE AND PEACE.
[1:33:22] [applause]
[1:33:23] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:33:24] HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:30] Praise God.
[1:33:33] [sighs and gasps]
[1:33:35] Brother Daryl, I wonder when I said in
[1:33:36] this, I wonder what the people of that
[1:33:38] day, you know, this is in the 50s. I
[1:33:41] wonder what the people of that day
[1:33:43] thought when they would hear these
[1:33:44] things.
[1:33:46] What is this man?
[1:33:48] What's he even talking about?
[1:33:51] Why? He was talking things that had
[1:33:54] never been taught
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; before. Don't you understand what it
[1:33:57] was? God had sent a window
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; to the supernatural.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; We hadn't had one in decades. The
[1:34:05] Gentiles had never had one. It was like
[1:34:07] this solid wall right here.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; We couldn't look beyond it. We couldn't
[1:34:11] go beyond it.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; But God sent simply sent a Malachi 4, a
[1:34:16] geometric design of four and five and 17
[1:34:20] and 30 and 10 1 and 7.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD OPENED UP THIS THIS VISION
[1:34:25] into the supernatural and he went over
[1:34:28] there AND SAID, "HEY CHILDREN, THESE IS
[1:34:30] OVER HERE AND THAT'S OVER THERE." NOT
[1:34:31] ONLY THAT, I SAW ALL OF YOU ALL OVER
[1:34:33] THERE.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. GOD OPENED UP THAT. IT
[1:34:37] WAS THERE ALL THE TIME. WE DIDN'T KNOW
[1:34:39] IT, BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE NO WAY TO LOOK IN
[1:34:41] THAT, BUT GOD SAID, "HERE, WOW. LET ME
[1:34:44] raise the window."
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:49] Oh, glory to God.
[1:34:51] LET THE ANGELS OF GOD TAKE THEIR
[1:34:53] POSITION,
[1:34:55] their places tonight along these lines
[1:35:00] of people
[1:35:02] and help us now to recognize
[1:35:07] your omnipresence.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Your omniresence.
[1:35:16] [laughter]
[1:35:17] I love reminding the devil. He don't
[1:35:20] have this.
[1:35:22] He don't have omnipresence. He don't
[1:35:24] have omnipotence. He's not all knowing.
[1:35:26] He don't know near as much as you and I
[1:35:28] think that he does. I love reminding him
[1:35:31] every now and then, you had a day you
[1:35:32] started. That means you got a day you
[1:35:34] going to die. And when there ain't no
[1:35:35] more devil, I'll still be shouting down
[1:35:37] the hills of glory. When there ain't no
[1:35:39] more cancer, when there ain't no more
[1:35:41] sickness, no more disease. THANKS BE TO
[1:35:43] GOD. AMEN, CHILDREN. WE WILL BE THERE
[1:35:46] FOR THE ETERNAL AGES WHEN THERE IS NO
[1:35:49] MORE DEVIL.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; I say we rejoice a little bit now while
[1:35:54] wait till we get over y.
[1:35:57] [applause]
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Now listen carefully.
[1:36:05] An angels
[1:36:07] a servant.
[1:36:10] We're sons and daughters.
[1:36:13] Which is the most thought of,
[1:36:16] your servant
[1:36:18] or your son or daughter?
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Prayer from a saint
[1:36:25] will go a million times higher than an
[1:36:28] angel. Yes, sir. Because he's a son.
[1:36:33] Oh, that's right, my brother, sister.
[1:36:36] I I DON'T BELIEVE THIS SIDE OF ETERNITY
[1:36:40] how will we'll ever realize
[1:36:43] what you are the position
[1:36:46] that YOU ARE THAT GOD HAS PLACED YOU
[1:36:49] SPIRITFILLED people
[1:36:51] you're sons of GOD WHY AN ANGEL'S A
[1:36:54] SERVANT YOU'RE A son an angel can only
[1:36:58] bring you a message
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; but you have to act
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN MAN, YOU'RE THE actor
[1:37:09] on the scene.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand what Paul said in
[1:37:16] the Corinthians that he called preaching
[1:37:20] foolishness?
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; And you're saved by foolishness.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; PREACHING.
[1:37:30] AND YET IT IS THE VERY HEART PURPOSE OF
[1:37:32] GOD MADE MANIFEST through the
[1:37:35] foolishness of preaching.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S THE WAY YOU'LL BE SAVED IS BY
[1:37:40] HEARING IT AND ACCEPTING IT.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; AND YET ANGELS OF GOD KNOW NOTHING ABOUT
[1:37:47] FOOLISHNESS. IF AN ANGEL OF GOD STOOD
[1:37:49] HERE, HIS FIRST SERMON, EVERY SERMON
[1:37:51] WOULD be perfect. I'VE BEEN PREACHING
[1:37:53] ALL THESE YEARS AND AIN'T NEVER preached
[1:37:54] a perfect one and never will.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. nor has or will any other
[1:38:01] preacher.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Things that you know in your mind is
[1:38:05] wrong and you'll stand up and quote the
[1:38:07] scripture wrong and you don't even know
[1:38:09] you've done it.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; You imagine the devil saying, "Ah, your
[1:38:13] boy up there
[1:38:15] kind of foolishness. Don't you think
[1:38:17] God, well, it may be foolishness to give
[1:38:19] it to me. I call it great. I call it so
[1:38:21] awesome. Donnie ain't never preached a
[1:38:22] perfect sermon. Daryl ain't never
[1:38:24] preached one. NOW THE REST OF PREACHERS
[1:38:25] I'VE ever seen on the earth, BUT THEY
[1:38:27] BROUGHT MY CHILDREN OUT OF DARKNESS.
[1:38:29] THEY BROUGHT MY CHILDREN OUT OF SICKNESS
[1:38:31] BECAUSE I ORDAINED THAT AVENUE
[1:38:34] FOOLISHNESS OF PREACHING.
[1:38:38] [sighs]
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; An angel can only bring you a message,
[1:38:44] but you have to act. Remember what I was
[1:38:47] preaching a few weeks ago about the
[1:38:49] theater that Paul said? We are the
[1:38:52] actors on the scene
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; and you're the angels say this, say
[1:38:58] that. They say, "You can do it better
[1:39:00] than me. You do it." Oh, no. No. I'm
[1:39:03] forbidden to act.
[1:39:06] I cannot do it. This This the father's
[1:39:08] drama was written for children only.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; You're the ACTOR ON THE SCENE. YOU'RE
[1:39:19] THE SON. THE ANGELS ARE servants
[1:39:24] to bring you THE MESSAGE SAID I BROUGHT
[1:39:26] THIS MESSAGE FOR YOU TO DO THAT AND SO
[1:39:29] THIS IS FROM FATHER I BRING IT TO YOU
[1:39:32] YES THERE THAT'S it amen your SONS AND
[1:39:35] DAUGHTERS OF GOD PREDESTINATED
[1:39:38] us
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; there is not an angel holy enough
[1:39:41] righteous enough pure enough I don't
[1:39:43] care if he's a cherubam a seraphim a zoo
[1:39:45] whatever he is that could ever
[1:39:46] scripturally be the pastor of this
[1:39:48] church or be an associate minister or
[1:39:50] even be a son or daughter of God.
[1:39:54] [sighs]
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; GOD, WE WOULD PRAY TONIGHT that the
[1:39:59] angels of God would take their position
[1:40:05] now
[1:40:07] in the midst of us.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Let me close your short hand.
[1:40:18] live so
[1:40:20] that if God would want to use you,
[1:40:24] he knows right where to come and get
[1:40:26] you.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; You're in a position, you're living a
[1:40:31] life clean
[1:40:33] before God. Your words are honest.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Your life is true. Now listen,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; your words are honest. Your life is
[1:40:44] true. THAT'S THE KIND OF A PLACE that
[1:40:48] angels
[1:40:50] Amen. COME. LOOK AT ELIZABETH AND
[1:40:52] ZACHCHARIAS AND HONEST UPRIGHT WALKING
[1:40:55] IN ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD.
[1:40:57] THAT'S THE WAY WE WANT TO LIVE. SO WHEN
[1:40:59] GOD GETS READY TO USE US, HE SAY THIS IS
[1:41:03] MY PEOPLE. I CAN DO THIS WITH MY CHURCH
[1:41:06] WHAT I WANT TO. THEY BELIEVE ME. THEY
[1:41:08] stand on my word. See that's the way you
[1:41:10] want to live. live the life.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, and then when it comes time
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; for that saint of God to leave this
[1:41:26] life,
[1:41:30] their soul needs ushering in
[1:41:33] to a realm
[1:41:35] where an undertaker cannot go.
[1:41:39] Their soul needs help crossing a sphere
[1:41:42] and into a dimension that the husband,
[1:41:46] the wife, mother, father, the pastor
[1:41:50] cannot go.
[1:41:53] So who does God use? Those beings who
[1:41:57] have the ability to move from mortality
[1:42:01] in the realm of time
[1:42:03] and take a hold of that soul and
[1:42:07] transport it across the river.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Luke 16:22. And it came to pass that the
[1:42:14] beggar died
[1:42:16] and was carried by the angels. Isn't it
[1:42:20] amazing? Angels in plural.
[1:42:23] Angels in plural. into Abraham's bosom.
[1:42:27] The rich man also died and was buried.
[1:42:31] But the difference between the rich man
[1:42:33] and the poor man was the angels wasn't
[1:42:36] present at his death.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Doesn't say anything about the beggar
[1:42:41] being buried. So made you wonder if he
[1:42:42] was ever buried OR NOT. NO DOUBT THE
[1:42:45] RICH MAN WAS BURIED WITH GREAT ADO, but
[1:42:48] the angels of God never packed him
[1:42:52] to his regions of the lost. Amen.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, WHEN WE COME TO THIS, THERE'S
[1:42:59] not a single friend or parent or brother
[1:43:02] or sister
[1:43:04] that can make that transition.
[1:43:07] I've stood by the bedside of many of the
[1:43:09] saints here through the years and watch
[1:43:13] them take THEIR LAST BREATH.
[1:43:15] SOMETIMES I've been the last one to
[1:43:17] speak to them.
[1:43:19] And I tell them similar words to this.
[1:43:23] be waiting for me when you get across
[1:43:25] the river.
[1:43:27] I'll be following you shortly.
[1:43:31] The last two years, some of the ones
[1:43:32] that I've talked to, I've told them,
[1:43:35] "When you see my little girl,
[1:43:38] tell her we're coming.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I LOVE THEM.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; BUT I can't go with them.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; I can't cross."
[1:43:52] Oh, but I've sensed in that hospital
[1:43:55] room or in that nursing home or in their
[1:43:59] home
[1:44:01] other beings that were there,
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; I could read Psalm 23 to them, might
[1:44:08] sing a song to them as they're getting
[1:44:09] ready to leave, but then the angels of
[1:44:12] God could say, "Excuse me, brother
[1:44:14] Donnie. We'll take them from here on."
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to God. This would be the
[1:44:21] most difficult time in their life. If
[1:44:24] they ever needed an angelic assistance,
[1:44:27] it would be moving from this mortal
[1:44:29] REALM TO THERE. YOU IMAGINE THEM SAME
[1:44:31] ANGELS THAT SPOKE TO THEM, KEEP ON
[1:44:33] BELIEVING, KEEP ON BELIEVING, AND SPOKE
[1:44:35] the word, DON'T LIVE THAT WAY, live this
[1:44:37] way, DO THIS, DO THAT. NOW, THE ANGELS
[1:44:39] COULD SAY, come on,
[1:44:44] today is the last day
[1:44:48] of your mortality.
[1:44:51] I've seen them lay there in them beds
[1:44:52] and them death rattles. I hate hearing
[1:44:55] that. I hate it.
[1:44:59] They can't hardly breathe.
[1:45:05] But right beyond what I can see, the
[1:45:08] angels of God are in the room. Heavenly
[1:45:11] pawbears.
[1:45:14] And they're not putting the the soul in
[1:45:16] a casket, but rather transferring the
[1:45:19] soul into a word form body.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. MOSES WHEN HE DIED, THE
[1:45:31] PROPHET SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF
[1:45:32] PAWBEARS HE HAD? ANGELS. WHY A man
[1:45:37] couldn't pack him where he was going?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; He had to have angels to pack him where
[1:45:42] he was going. Can you imagine friends?
[1:45:45] Oh my whenever death is coming up to us,
[1:45:48] my goodness, I I I think of the various
[1:45:51] ones. But whenever I went to see sister
[1:45:52] Naomi Daily and and she was in the
[1:45:54] hospital there and they said, "Well,
[1:45:56] brother Donnie, they told me I'm going
[1:45:57] to die today." They said, "I'm going to
[1:45:59] leave." I asked him, "Is there anything
[1:46:01] they can DO TO SPEED IT UP?"
[1:46:05] And I'm thinking, they're probably
[1:46:06] thinking, "Lord have mercy. This woman's
[1:46:08] out of her mind." I thought, "Yeah, out
[1:46:10] of her mind and fixing TO BE OUT OF HER
[1:46:12] BODY, FIXING TO BE OUT OF THIS OLD PEST
[1:46:15] HOUSE." SHE SAID, "I'M READY TO GO." AND
[1:46:16] THE LAST TIME I SEEN HER, SHE'S SMILING
[1:46:19] AND LAUGHING AND SAYING, "THIS IS THE
[1:46:20] DAY I'M GOING HOME." OH, HOW IN THE
[1:46:23] WORLD CAN A MAN OR WOMAN FACE MAN'S
[1:46:26] GREATEST ENEMY? IT'S GREATER THAN
[1:46:28] CANCER. IT'S GREATER THAN TV. OUR
[1:46:30] GREATEST ENEMY WOULD [applause] BE
[1:46:31] DEATH. BUT A REAL CHILD OF GOD LOOKS
[1:46:34] DEATH IN THE FACE AND SAY, "YOU CAN'T
[1:46:36] MAKE ME TREMBLE. YOU DON'T SCARE ME. YOU
[1:46:39] DON'T SCARE ME. I AM NOT YOUR SLAVE. YOU
[1:46:43] ARE [screaming] MINE. ALL YOU'RE GOING
[1:46:45] TO DO IS PACK ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY
[1:46:48] KING.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; OH,
[1:46:57] he had to have angels to pack him where
[1:46:59] he was going. Why? He had forsaken the
[1:47:01] glamour of the world.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; And he took the reproach of Christ.
[1:47:09] Brother Brown talking about his wife and
[1:47:11] his baby.
[1:47:13] Where did I get that baby?
[1:47:16] Who gave it to me?
[1:47:19] Not mine anyhow.
[1:47:24] He just lo to me
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; for a while.
[1:47:40] He just loaned her to us for a while,
[1:47:42] girls.
[1:47:44] Us thanking him today.
[1:47:47] Us thanking him
[1:47:50] for loaning her to us.
[1:47:53] Maybe you think of your loved ones and
[1:47:55] those that departed
[1:47:57] that could have been born in that family
[1:47:59] and that family and that family and you
[1:48:00] never known them.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But God loaned them to you.
[1:48:07] So remember
[1:48:09] that wife, that husband, your children,
[1:48:11] your grandchildren, they're on loan.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; And he will want them back one day.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; And he may call them back before he
[1:48:19] calls you back.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; So love them while you can.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Love them while you've got them.
[1:48:28] He laundered to me for a while and I
[1:48:32] said, "Satan,
[1:48:34] get away from me." I went over and laid
[1:48:36] my hand on the baby and I said, "God
[1:48:38] bless you, sweetheart.
[1:48:41] In a minute, daddy will take you down
[1:48:43] and put you on mama's arms
[1:48:46] and the angels will pack your little
[1:48:49] soul
[1:48:50] away
[1:48:53] and I'll meet you in the morning." I
[1:48:55] said, "Lord, you give her to me. You're
[1:48:56] taking her away. Though you slay me,
[1:48:59] like Job said, "Yet I love you and I
[1:49:01] believe you if you send me to hell,
[1:49:05] I will love you."
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Anyhow,
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:49:14] Let me close
[1:49:16] token and shport.
[1:49:19] God is displaying his token now and
[1:49:22] he'll ever be true to it. In the hour of
[1:49:26] your death,
[1:49:28] the angels of God
[1:49:32] will come and pack you
[1:49:35] not in death but from death.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand your body is what's
[1:49:45] dying, not you. Amen.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; It must be outright torment
[1:49:56] for demons out of hell when they come
[1:49:58] into the hospital room where saints is
[1:49:59] fixing to pass on and all this and they
[1:50:01] come. I'm going to get them. I'm going
[1:50:02] to get them to do like they did MOSES
[1:50:04] AND THEY ARGUING. I WANT THE BODY OF
[1:50:05] MOSES AND ANGEL REBUKE YOU. YOU CAN'T
[1:50:08] HAVE ANYBODY. GET AWAY FROM HERE.
[1:50:11] And they come there just TO MAKE SURE.
[1:50:12] MAYBE THERE WASN'T A BELIEVER. MAYBE
[1:50:14] THERE'S A SECRET CENTER. MAYBE IT'S
[1:50:15] SOMETHING THERE. AND THE ANGELS OF GOD
[1:50:17] HAVE TO MOVE BACK OR HERE COMES the
[1:50:19] angels of God right down and they reach
[1:50:22] down and take that soul out of that
[1:50:24] cancer stricken body or out of an
[1:50:27] automobile accident and grab that soul
[1:50:31] out of that body. Angels all around him
[1:50:33] and say come dear one
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; come with us.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:50:42] Hallelujah.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; in your dowy saints.
[1:51:01] It's healing, it's peace, it's
[1:51:04] sanctification. So many wonderful things
[1:51:06] of God.
[1:51:09] But angels
[1:51:11] are in your daring.
[1:51:16] Brother Don, what should I do? Maybe you
[1:51:19] should start praying the way your
[1:51:21] prophet prayed.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, let the angels of God be in church
[1:51:26] tonight.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; It's only Wednesday, Jesus. Does that
[1:51:30] matter to you? Well, I made Wednesday,
[1:51:31] too, Donnie. I'm God on Wednesdays like
[1:51:33] I am on Sunday.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; The angels of God are with you on
[1:51:36] Wednesday. If your expectation is low,
[1:51:38] don't blame them. They're right there to
[1:51:39] have the dew drops. and they're here
[1:51:41] tonight to distill split their wings and
[1:51:44] distill healing, distill peace,
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; distill salvation.
[1:51:50] Or maybe you just need a charge going
[1:51:52] through you like a battery.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Thank my precious friends
[1:52:05] what our father has done for us.
[1:52:09] You mothers and fathers remember there's
[1:52:12] been stage in your children's life if
[1:52:15] you send them to public school or if you
[1:52:16] took them to you bring them to Bible
[1:52:18] school whatever it is and you have to
[1:52:19] drop them off and you know you take them
[1:52:21] to Sunday school and you've got to leave
[1:52:22] them there and you're leaving them with
[1:52:23] their teacher and the first time they've
[1:52:24] ever been oh my goodness you know you
[1:52:27] there's things you have to do and oh you
[1:52:30] want to make sure that they're taken
[1:52:31] care of
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; and our father wanted to make sure we
[1:52:36] were taken care of I'm going to live in
[1:52:37] them I'm going cleanse them. I'm going
[1:52:39] to send a ministry. I'm going to send
[1:52:40] them a prophet. I'm going to send them
[1:52:42] all these things.
[1:52:44] But I know they're going to face such
[1:52:45] things.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to assign each one of them an
[1:52:50] angel.
[1:52:54] And when the record of this life is over
[1:52:57] and they all come before me and I flash
[1:53:00] back their life on a screen
[1:53:03] and I'll show them what was invisible
[1:53:07] and I'll show them. They should have
[1:53:09] died in that car wreck.
[1:53:11] They was heading out on vacation,
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; but they got in the car to leave and the
[1:53:16] kid said, "I need to go to the bathroom
[1:53:18] or spill Kool-Aid."
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; And dad got mad in a hornet. I CAN'T
[1:53:22] BELIEVE YOU. I TOLD YOU NOT TO BRING
[1:53:23] THAT RED KOOL-AID in this car. What in
[1:53:25] the world are you doing? Little did they
[1:53:27] know, the angel of the Lord was
[1:53:28] protecting them from a head-on
[1:53:30] collision.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] They come to church time after time and
[1:53:38] they're struggling. They're struggling.
[1:53:40] They got there, they barely barely made
[1:53:42] it to church in time and they didn't
[1:53:43] even been able to eat and they just ate
[1:53:45] something real fast coming to church.
[1:53:47] I walked the parking lot out here
[1:53:49] sometimes and I've passed by here on
[1:53:50] Wednesday night, seen saints sitting in
[1:53:53] their vehicle eating pizza, eating
[1:53:55] sandwiches
[1:53:57] cuz they come straight from work to come
[1:54:00] to church.
[1:54:04] Hallelujah. Why? They want to be where
[1:54:08] he is.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you think about this
[1:54:11] place. To me, this is a sacred place,
[1:54:15] sir.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; I said this is a sacred place. This is a
[1:54:18] sacred desk. And just in case you're
[1:54:20] wondering, Brother Brandham never said
[1:54:22] that only at his church.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the first place
[1:54:25] that he ever mentioned, it wasn't even
[1:54:27] in his own tabernacle.
[1:54:30] This is a sacred place.
[1:54:34] Hallowed
[1:54:35] set aside.
[1:54:38] Praise God.
[1:54:41] Let's bury our heads if you would.
[1:54:47] How many wants God to help you that
[1:54:50] you'll be more conscious and be more
[1:54:52] aware of of these things that we've
[1:54:55] talked about tonight?
[1:54:58] You all, by the grace of God, going to
[1:55:00] approach it in a different way. Are you
[1:55:01] going to start praying, Lord? Let the
[1:55:02] angels of the Lord. I don't I don't know
[1:55:04] how y'all do before I get ready to go
[1:55:06] out somewhere. I always pray first. May
[1:55:08] the angels of God go with us. Oh, I'm a
[1:55:10] good driver. I don't care how good a
[1:55:11] driver you are. And I ain't worried
[1:55:12] about me. I'm worried about them other
[1:55:13] people out there.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; My good and driving may not keep me out
[1:55:17] of a wreck, but an angel of God can. And
[1:55:20] I'm going to ask
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; I hope that we come back here Sunday and
[1:55:25] from this point on to the rapture
[1:55:29] asking God, Lord, let your angels, let
[1:55:32] your angels be in the service. May they
[1:55:34] distill healing.
[1:55:37] Oh, glory to God. Do you understand,
[1:55:38] friends? Right here in this church, the
[1:55:42] dead have been raised
[1:55:45] in this church. Women which could not
[1:55:47] conceive
[1:55:49] have conceived and the doctors told them
[1:55:50] they never would.
[1:55:53] There's children here tonight that their
[1:55:55] parents are told they can never have
[1:55:57] them.
[1:55:58] How many great things have happened here
[1:56:01] among us? Yes, it is a sacred place,
[1:56:06] a holy place.
[1:56:11] Father, I
[1:56:14] before I ask you for anything
[1:56:18] in the line of illumination and help,
[1:56:22] I want to say I'm sorry.
[1:56:26] I apologize for myself
[1:56:29] and I apologize for these people
[1:56:33] that we have not recognized.
[1:56:38] Not only your presence at times,
[1:56:41] but the angels of God.
[1:56:44] How many times have you spoke, Lord, and
[1:56:48] let the angel of the Lord say something
[1:56:51] and I just thought it's me or my mind?
[1:56:55] When the angels have been around us to
[1:56:57] energize our faith,
[1:57:01] they've whispered, "Believe. Believe.
[1:57:04] Trust. Wait."
[1:57:06] We can know it'll be an angel of the
[1:57:08] Lord because it'll never believe the
[1:57:09] word. Never. Not one time.
[1:57:13] Oh Jesus.
[1:57:16] Help us as Christians, Father, that we
[1:57:18] can make up in our minds.
[1:57:21] If our home is not the type of home that
[1:57:25] angels can feel welcome in, if there's
[1:57:28] anything in our home that would defile
[1:57:31] it, anything, Lord, in our behavior, our
[1:57:35] actions
[1:57:37] that would prevent angels of God from
[1:57:40] coming around us, may we take care of
[1:57:43] it, Lord.
[1:57:46] For those of us, Father, that believe
[1:57:48] that all things are clean between us and
[1:57:50] you, we're asking, dear God, make us
[1:57:53] more mindful.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Make us more mindful.
[1:58:00] Lord, I realize some people get scared
[1:58:03] when you go to talk in this way, but I
[1:58:05] don't believe that you intend to terrify
[1:58:08] us, but only in the capacity that we're
[1:58:12] ordained to see them
[1:58:15] is what we're praying for tonight.
[1:58:19] Lord God, we ask you.
[1:58:22] May we recognize when we come to the
[1:58:24] house of God. This is a sacred place,
[1:58:29] a holy place sanctified
[1:58:32] by your presence, Lord God.
[1:58:36] The angels of God are here waving their
[1:58:38] white flags. Demons are here waving
[1:58:41] their black ones. But I'm going to go
[1:58:44] ahead and tell them they might as well
[1:58:45] roll up theirs and walk back down to
[1:58:48] hell
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; because they ain't claiming the victory
[1:58:50] in this place tonight.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; We worship you, Jesus.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:59:04] Would you lay your hand over on the
[1:59:05] person standing by you tonight now?
[1:59:09] Glory to God.
[1:59:13] Hallelujah.
[1:59:16] Brother Daryl, would you care to come up
[1:59:18] buddy and pray over the needs
[1:59:22] request of the people?
[1:59:26] Hallelujah.
[1:59:29] Hallelujah.
[1:59:34] Let's just bow our heads.
[1:59:42] Heavenly Father, [snorts]
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; we are so grateful in our hearts, Lord,
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; for your word that you have illuminated
[1:59:51] to us tonight. Lord,
[1:59:53] we are so grateful, dear God.
[1:59:57] We have come to this sacred place, Lord,
[2:00:00] to open our hearts, Lord, to receive of
[2:00:02] your word that we could become more
[2:00:05] light, Lord, to this dark age. We pray.
[2:00:07] And Lord, you see the heart of every
[2:00:09] person in this building tonight. And I
[2:00:11] ask you, Lord Jesus,
[2:00:13] may your spirit, Lord, be felt upon
[2:00:15] every heart, Lord, and touch every life,
[2:00:17] Lord, as we lay hands upon one another.
[2:00:19] May the Holy Spirit, Lord, that
[2:00:21] anointing that raised my Lord, from the
[2:00:23] grave, may it move, oh God, about every
[2:00:26] heart and about every life, dear God,
[2:00:28] that our sick, dear God, would be
[2:00:30] healed. That our weak would be made
[2:00:31] strong, Lord. that those that would
[2:00:33] struggle, God, would find strength to
[2:00:35] stand in this hour, dear God. For Lord,
[2:00:38] though the world may be sinking around
[2:00:40] us, we are rising, dear God, to our
[2:00:41] rightful positions as sons and daughters
[2:00:44] of God, Lord, to be an example to this
[2:00:46] dying generation that you are the same
[2:00:48] yesterday, today, and forever, Lord. And
[2:00:51] God, I pray, Father, that each person
[2:00:53] here tonight would receive that which
[2:00:54] they have need of, dear God. May you
[2:00:57] move upon every home, Lord, upon every
[2:00:58] heart, upon every life, upon those dear
[2:01:00] God, that are streaming and around the
[2:01:02] world, God, who are gathering, Lord, to
[2:01:04] hear of your word tonight. I pray, oh
[2:01:06] Lord. God, we know that times and
[2:01:08] situations and and landmarks, Lord, and
[2:01:11] geographical situations does not hinder
[2:01:14] you from moving above the needs of your
[2:01:16] people, oh God, tonight. And we call you
[2:01:18] on the scene, Lord Jesus. Oh God, may
[2:01:21] the angels tonight, Lord. May they wave
[2:01:23] the white flags of victory and may the
[2:01:25] black flags be drugged out in DEFEAT
[2:01:27] TONIGHT, LORD. BECAUSE THE SONS and
[2:01:29] daughters of God have exercised their
[2:01:31] God-given rights, oh Lord, to lay hands
[2:01:34] upon one another for it is written IN
[2:01:35] THY WORD. THEY SHALL lay hands upon the
[2:01:38] sick and they shall recover. And we
[2:01:40] believe that tonight, oh God. We believe
[2:01:42] that tonight, Lord. And we thank you,
[2:01:44] Lord Jesus. forever time. Lord, your
[2:01:46] hand has touched us, Lord. At a red
[2:01:48] light when it's turned, Lord, and we
[2:01:50] should have left, but you held us back,
[2:01:52] God, and it was you, Lord. Oh,
[2:01:54] hallelujah. Your prophet said, "One day
[2:01:55] you'll know it was the hand of Jesus
[2:01:58] holding you back, keeping you from that
[2:02:00] accident, Lord. How we thank you for it,
[2:02:02] God. Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; From the times you have watched over us
[2:02:05] and protected us, Lord, that we weren't
[2:02:07] even aware of it. But tonight, we thank
[2:02:09] you from the depths of our heart.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; And you've brought us home every time.
[2:02:13] [laughter]

[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; And God, you'll bring us
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; to our our heavenly home.

[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, and to thee, Lord. Let us labor. I
[2:02:24] pray. Touch your children, Lord.
