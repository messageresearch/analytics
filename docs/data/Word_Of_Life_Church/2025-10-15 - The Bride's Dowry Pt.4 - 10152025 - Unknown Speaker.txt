That's brother Charles Anon's um, testimony. So, was going to have brother Rob, but I think he stepped out on us. So, if we can just bow our heads. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful, Lord, that we can come sit around your word, Lord. Lord, there's many needs that have been written down here and turned in. There's many needs, Lord, on the needs of the people here, Lord. Every heart has a need. Every mind, Father, and and those that are are listening, Father, if you have a need there, Lord, as we was singing while ago, send the rain. Lord, we're asking you tonight, Lord, that you would send the rain of healing down on your people, Lord. Lord, may you the the healing rain come down and wash anything away, Father, that's unlike you. Anything, Lord, that would hinder people to get through this service, Lord, that would wash any critical spirit away. Anything, Father, that would that would try to hinder the coming of the word, Lord. Lord, we pray for every one of these needs, Lord. We know as your prophet said that the healing was already has already taken place, Lord. He said, "In the mind of God, before the foundation of the world, Calvary took place. And and in the mind of God, this healing was already paid for. Lord, may we accept what you've already done for us, Father. Lord, we want to give you thanks, Lord, for the testimonies of healings, Lord, our sister's eyes, Lord, and keeping Brother Charles Anon safe, Lord. We're so grateful for that, Lord. We know you you do marvelous things, Father. And we're asking that you would continue to do that in the needs, Lord, that been brought before you tonight, Lord.

We thank you for it in Jesus wonderful name. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All day today just thinking about what to sing, I just uh the word awesome just kept coming on in my mind. Awesome. My God is awesome. You can be seated. [Music] My God is awome. He can move mountains, keep me in the valley, hide me from the rain. My God is awome. gives me when I'm broken. Strength where I've been weakened. Forever he will reign. My God is awome. He's awome. Awome. Awome. My God is awesome. He's awome. Awome. He's awome. My God is awome. Savior of the whole world. Giver of salvation. I strong [Music] [Applause] awome. My God is awome. Today I am his grace is why I'm here. My God is awesome. He's awesome. [Music] He me. [Music] My God is awesome. He is awesome. My God is awesome. [Music] Awome. My God is awesome. Savior of the whole world of salvation. And by his stripes I'm here. My God is awesome. He is awome. He's so awome. Awesome. My God is awome. [Music] As the singers, get ready. Yeah. You can go ahead and give him a hand clap of praise. He's awesome, ain't he? [Applause] Standing on holy ground. F. Yeah, they're coming. Let's sing this real quick as they're coming. Brother Donniey's talking about angels being with us. And I just couldn't help but think of this song. I was driving home the other night and we are standing on holy ground. And I know that there are angels all around. Let us praise Jesus now. We are standing in his presence on earth. [Music] We are standing [Music] on holy ground. [Applause] And I know that there are angels. [Music] [Applause] Jesus praise Jesus. Now [Applause] we are standing in his presence on holy ground. God bless you. Let's give our singers a good hand. [Music] I could never praise him enough for the cross of Calvary. I could never thank him enough for salvation full and free. I could never do anything to deserve such perfect love. Oh, for everything he's done, I could never praise him enough. For many years, I've served the Lord the best that I know how. giving unto him my time telling of his power. But if I were to spend unending hours on my knees praising him for everything he's ever done for me, I could never praise him enough for the cross of Calvary. I could never thank him enough for salvation full and free. I could never do anything to deserve such perfect love. Oh, for everything he's done. I could never praise him enough. A thousand tongues could never tell just what the Lord has done. As if he hadn't done enough, he sent his only son to hang upon a rugged cross and bear the load of sin. And that explains why I can't express the love I have for him. I could never praise him enough for the cross of Calvary. I could never thank him enough for salvation full and free. I can never do anything to deserve such perfect love. Oh, for everything he's done. Oh, for everything he's done. Oh, for everything he's done. I could never praise him enough. [Music] [Applause] I know you hear me sing way too much and I try to stay out of the specials, but every once in a while, Brother Louie can't get anybody, so he drafts me. But I've never sung this song, although I just looked it up while ago. It was written about the time I give my heart to the Lord. And I give my heart to the Lord in 1977. And ever since that, I've wanted one thing, and that's to go home. I know we've lost a lot of loved ones, and I'm sure all of us want to go home from time to time, but I believe the bride is just wanting to go home. [Applause] [Music] They say that heaven's pretty and living here is too. But if they said that I would have to choose between the two, I'd go home. [Music] I'd go home where I belong. [Music] Sometimes when I'm dreaming, it comes as no surprise that if you'd look, you'd see a homesick feeling in my eyes. I'm headed home. I'm going home where I belong. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And while I'm here, I'll serve him gladly and sing him all these songs. I'm here [Music] but not for long. When I'm feeling lonely and when I'm feeling blue, it's such a joy to know that I am only passing through. I'm headed home. I'm going home. where I belong. [Music] [Applause] [Music] One day I'll be sleeping when death knocks on my door. And I'll awake to find I'm not homesick anymore. I'll be home. I'll be home where I belong. [Music] [Applause] where I belong. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Thank you. I trust that's our greatest desire tonight. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm just glad we've got a home to go to. &gt;&gt; You realize there's our population here in Johnson City is increasing more and more. You see that if you get out early of a morning, 7 7:30, and you're going or coming east or west. Traffic everywhere. with that more homeless people. I'm sure you've seen that as well. But what's even worse than people that don't have a mobile home to live in or a house, an apartment, a condo are those that are spiritually homeless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have no place that they can really identify with Jesus. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad we've got a home. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're not just going to a home. We already have one. And he's took up his home inside of us. &gt;&gt; We're blessed, aren't we? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Trust everybody's well. &gt;&gt; Doing good. Fighting the devil. &gt;&gt; Winning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Winning. Praise the Lord. All right. Good. Genesis 24:58. to speak again tonight by the help of the Lord on the bride's dowy. I'm afraid that I've broke into a a u quite an extensive little bit of information here about the dowy. I'm not sure there'll ever be an end to it with all that our Lord has provided for us. He knew we needed it, didn't he? &gt;&gt; He knew we needed it. And they called Rebecca and said unto her, "Well, thou go with this man." And she said, "I will go." And they sent away Rebecca, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. And they blessed Rebecca and said unto her, "Thou art our sister. Be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them." And Rebecca rose and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca and went his way. I love the way Moses writes this and the way that he divides it as it goes. So, Rebecca arose. Notice she takes precedent and Rebecca arose and her damsels inclusive with her. And they rode upon the camels and followed the man. So, the damsels were following the man too, &gt;&gt; but they were not bride. &gt;&gt; No. They probably heard some of the same stories, &gt;&gt; some of the same teaching that Rebecca heard, but they were not called to be bride. But were they better off? I think they were. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were better off being with her. &gt;&gt; Even though they may not be bride, they were better off being with her. And the servant took Rebecca. Notice how Moses goes back. Now doesn't mention about the foolish virgins. I I I mean the handmaidadens. The servant took Rebecca and went his way. How many like to be remembered tonight as we pray? So many needs among us. Those that are sick and afflicted and going through different trials and things like that. So let's let's just pray for the church body as well. Heavenly Father, we love you so much. You've been so good to us, Jesus. I'm sure I could give you a million reasons or more why you shouldn't love me. And a million reasons or more as to why you shouldn't love most of these people that are here tonight. But if I would give you a million and they would give you a million and everyone else a million, no doubt you would give us millions more back. Why you do love us and we're grateful that your answer overpowers ours. And as we see with Rebecca here that her destiny has come into view, a little simple lady that probably thought she'd marry a merchant or uh a man that would sell livestock, never amount to much of anything. But little did she know when that messenger showed up that day, her life would never be the same. From thinking she might marry a man and have two or three kids, her destiny was to be the mother of thousands of millions. Who would have ever thought it? But we know it is part of the father's drama that the father picks the actors, the characters, and he writes their parts. If he can just get them into the spirit of the drama, and they will quit trying to take this one's place or that one's place, and just find their part and be what the father made them to be. Truly, Lord, that's our desire tonight. We pray that you'd speak to us by your word. You see the needs of all the hands that was uplifted, those Lord God that are sick tonight, can't be in church, those that have various needs. We pray that you'd be mindful of them. Help me to get out of the way. Father, speak to us the very counsel of the Almighty God. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray Lord that you'd be mindful of the camp starting tomorrow night. Father, you see the minister brothers that'll be there doing the speaking. We pray, Father, that you'd just be with the young folks as they'll be coming in tomorrow and the next day. And Lord, we're just looking for a great time in your presence. Change lives, fill with the Holy Ghost, do some great things, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. So the dowry is given to the bride by her father to equip her for her new life. And part of it will be her inheritance which will carry over beyond the journey as it was with Rebecca. And part of it would have been designated for the journey in time and then part of it will go on into eternity. Imagine that when Paul began to get this understanding that God had opened up to him, we don't know exactly how long he had it before he started writing it in the book of Ephesians. And we know that Paul, as with other prophets, as with the church in the New Testament as well, that they grew in understanding. We can see from the very beginning that Paul was illuminated above his brothers and God gave him an understanding, an allocation of the mysteries of God that no other had in that age. And we know that God trusted him with that. And yet I imagine sometimes it must have been quite overwhelming as he went to Arabia first and spent that time alone with God and then didn't meet Peter and them again for about 15 years or so. And he found himself preaching some of the same things they were preaching. But I want you to listen to that carefully now. He was preaching some of the same things they were preaching. But they couldn't say that. They couldn't say they were preaching some of the same things Paul was preaching because God gave things to Paul that Peter never preached. God gave things to Paul that Andrew, Bartholomew, Matthew, Mark, many of those brothers, they did not get directly from God. Now you remember when brother Random went beyond the curtain of time and he said he preached what Paul preached and those voices echoed back that we are resting on that and brother Brandham preached what Paul preached but there was things that brother Brandham preached that Paul didn't preach &gt;&gt; because Paul didn't need to. Now listen carefully. The church ages did not need to be preached in the first church age. The seven thunders did not need to be uttered when John heard them on the aisle of Patmas. So Paul never preached all that brother Brandham preached. Come on now. Don't get quiet on me already. &gt;&gt; Why? It wasn't time. Now do you understand the Lord Jesus never preached all that Paul preached. Why? It wasn't time. &gt;&gt; It was not time for it to be said. Now, it wasn't that he didn't know it and that he didn't have the understanding. He did. Well, come on now. I'm going to go a little farther. Men of God in the message of this age are preaching things now that men who were around brother Brandham in the 60s, 70s, and even some in the 80s that they never preached then either. &gt;&gt; You know why? because many of them did not have the message on the laptop or a computer where they could get in there and compare the statements. Wonder why it wasn't necessarily needed for that time. God knew how long we were going to be here. And God allowed, I believe with all of my heart, even though I come off the tree of knowledge of good and evil, God allowed the message to be put in an infabase to be studied. So men of God around the world would be able to find things that's in the message that laid there for years and years that message preachers never even knew that they were there. So can you imagine my preaching all the rest of these preacher brothers around the world if we were still having to listen to tapes individual tapes or read individual books and try to write it down and then make little notes and compare here and there and there. So if I want to do a study like I have today and I want to type in several different words. So if I want to search angels as I did today, angels of God, if I want to search angels in whatever format and I pull up 585 and I'd be able to sit there and go from one to the other to the other to the other to the other to the other just like that as fast as I can read. You imagine what that would be if I would try to pick up my Bible and go from one chapter to another to another to another of trying to search it. Oh my goodness. I would never get done, would I? I would constantly be looking. But God has allowed the speed of the message being searched, the Bible being searched to match the speed of the revelation that is needed for this end time. What is it all doing? speeding up for a body change. &gt;&gt; They didn't need to be sped up in the days of Luther or in the days of Wesley. They moved along in the horse and buggy days. But you know what? We need it, brother Joe. And I thank God for it myself. So whenever it was there, we can see how that that it unveiled in Paul. And I'm going to read again if you don't mind that Paul again in Ephesians 3:8 when he said unto me who am least than the le less than the least of all saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ. Now remember, no one else in the New Testament uses these terms and writes this way. And to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places. So principalities which was the first ones in the order of creation the preeminent ones ara principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church. Now angels of God are not all knowing. They are not all knowing. They are not omnipotent. And there are many things that God has kept secret from the angels. The Lord Jesus says that the angels don't even know when he's coming. Is that right? &gt;&gt; They don't know that. They did not know until the mystery was broke at the dawn in between the Old and the New Testament when he was coming to the earth the first time. So unto the principalities and powers to the angelic host, these super intelligent beings, if we can say it that way, that surround the throne of God, yet many things are kept from them. So this is part of the father's drama. I don't know if you remembered or not, but I preached a sermon to you many, many years ago and entitled it the father's drama. Let me just set a little bit of a foundation for you. And I want you to notice what I'm going to read from tonight. This very first quote. The deity of Jesus Christ, December the 25th, Christmas Day, the year 1949. But look friends, the hour has come and is now that when God's great drama set here before us, now watch. God's great drama set here before us. The son of God that was in the cradle is in the heart now. He's the deity of God. But that is the God, the creator living in you, giving you all the power. And you're in possession of anything that he had. So is it in you to abstain from evil, to do good, to shun evil and flee to righteousness, to turn away from temptation? Now this is the kind of power I want to see made manifest in our church as well as healing the sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. All malice, hatred, strife, envy, and so forth, come away from it. for that'll take him from your heart if you will receive him, embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart. Now notice the prophet calls it a drama. So it is a drama that the father wrote in his mind before he brought angels into an angelic form or being. Now watch this. and shalom. He says, "So we have these times of symphonies of the symphony of God's word that the whole drama changes. Now now what he does is he brings the drama of God and he puts it to music. Now watch the symphony is now correlating together with the drama. Now, in the early days whenever they first come out with moving pictures, and many of you probably have seen them, if nothing else, just on an archive format, that the movies were silent. So, they would act out and they would do this and that and the other, but there was no voices. So, they would just act and jump around and this and that. And then they started putting music to it. And then they got to where they could actually synchronize the actions with the voice and then they paired it up to where it would be able to work. So it's like they were learning the visual first was audio and then visual but it was not together and then they learned to synchronize it together and then they would also put music in the background with it. Now watch the word as it's starting to do the same. You who are interested, listen for that change. You know it's getting close. You hear the way the drums are beating, want something to happen, and you know this is a change. See, it's going to break out into a burst in a few minutes and you're watching for it and you can tell the way the drums are timing. He said, "God, oh God, if you can hear the drums of the finish." Now, now watch how he's going, not only to the drama and the actors that are on the scene, but also the music, the symphony, and also the sympathy. Now, I know there's been some of the message people that thought that Brother Brandon actually made a mistake. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And I'll let you think it for a few minutes now. Watch. Oh, God. If you can hear the drums of the finish now. If you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly word singing itself out. So the echo, notice why he says this. If you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly word. Now what is it that causes an echo? Now let me explain sound to you a little bit. That sound does not travel as fast as the speed of light. Sound travels much slower. Barometric pressure affects sound. Humidity, relative humidity reflects sound. Several different things affect the soundwave. So in here by going straight to the PA system there and the way it works here, it's not so bad. But if you go into some of these other rooms that we have around and also onto the internet, I was down at brother Jason Watkins several years ago and I preached there and then I I I got done with the service and I went off the platform back into the room there and their internet room was right next to the office and I I just couldn't keep from laughing because I had done stopped preaching and I'd stood on the platform for a little bit and worship with the people and yet when I walked into the office. I heard myself still preaching over the internet. Now, what was happening? It was the delay from the time that it had come to however all that internet stuff works and where it got to where it was. And yet, I had already done. And I thought, what a great a great reflection of prophecy that that is that God can say things for thousands of years and it's already said and the actors come on the scene. But whenever you're setting up sound, so say in the nurseries or back in some of the remote parts of the building that we would actually be able to put it on a timer and be able to either speed up the frequency of how it works or delay it because if you don't, it will be an echo and I'll say it here and then say it there again, say it here and say it there again. But you can run it through a processor and speed it up and time that voice to where when I say it here, it will be exactly the same back there. Now you see God prophetically has his prophets to say it and it is an echo and they're echoing way back. It's coming. It's coming. And then the echo will say it's coming. It's coming. It's coming. But they're done saying something else by the time you hear it. But watch what God has been doing as he's dialing in the message of the hour with the season, with the time, with the drama, with the music. And the delay is getting shorter and shorter. And what God is waiting for is the events out here, plus us as his people, to all get exactly right. And then he'll make the last final tune and the echo will absolutely disappear. &gt;&gt; Why? It's because the way you process the sound and you can be able to do it in such a way that it eliminates it now naturally because sound travels so slow. And you know how it is those of you that have stood out in places and you go through a tunnel and people in there and they what do they love to do? They love to honk their horns in a tunnel and they go through. You ever stood in the Swiss Alps and you stand up there and on and on and on it goes. What is it? It's because that sound does not travel as fast as light does. Now watch what God is doing prophetically. Now we said the echo of the music of the heavenly word. Isn't that an awesome quote? The echo of the music of the heavenly word singing itself out. And it shall come to pass in the last days. The sympathy, come on. &gt;&gt; The sympathy of God's great drama that he's playing, it changes him. The sympathy of God's great drama, it changes him. His sympathy at the junctions, the composer and those who are interested. Anybody interested tonight? &gt;&gt; Those who are interested, listen for the change. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's what we're listening for, friends. the change. &gt;&gt; Now you see, we called it when we come to the message and we call it change again. The further our revelation begin to grow and advance in the word, the the music has changed us and we're coming closer and closer, but we're listening for the final change. Now watch. He says the composer and those who are interested listen for the change. That's what's all this stuff is to us. We're listening. We're watching. Now, notice. So, we're not just in the days of audio alone, but we're in the days of drama and audio being mixed together. We're not just in the days to where it's totally audio. And when as long as we are just hearing the tapes, as long as we're just listening to the message and not letting the message manifest itself out of our lives, then we are not yet synchronized to where the audio and the visual are becoming one. &gt;&gt; You see, we don't want to just talk about the message and quote the message. We want to become it. So we want the drama and the symphony to be together and then it will act out exactly what father wants in the drama. This is not just a musical. This is not just music alone. It is not audio alone. It is a drama. So in the drama there is audio but there is also visual. You see, we want to be Jesus, the living, resurrected Jesus living out of our lives. Who will be Jesus to this age? Who will be Jesus to Johnson City, Elizabeth, and all these places around us? Come on, somebody. Now, a lot of the message people, it shows that they've missed it. They've totally missed it because their focus is audio alone. That's why they focused the tapes, the tapes, the tapes, the tapes, the tapes, the tapes. Brother Bram's voice. Brother Bram's voice. Brother Bram's voice. Well, this is Brother Bram's voice saying it right here. &gt;&gt; That there's got to be drama. And in the drama, there's more than one actor. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, every time, what she said, that's what all this stuff is to us. We're listening and we are watching. Now if it's audio alone, we don't need to watch for anything. We just listen and that's all we do. But if it's a drama, then we are listening, but we're also watching. Sometimes the introductory part to the drama, the visual will be led in by what? Audio. The audio. That's what I do almost every wedding you've ever seen me do. I am waiting most of the time for a particular song and we will come and practice and they will give me this list. Now, brother Donnie, when they play and they change the music to this, this is your cue and the brides and you know, all the groom guys, all them there, that's when you all come out. The change of the music will be your sign. I said, "Now, how do I know? How do I know when it is?" You know, I I ain't done this that much. So, I want to know. How do I know? I I don't want to mess it up. I don't. I want to be right. I I want to know my queue when to come out. When they change the music, then you will come out. So what leads me out? The audio leads out the visual. &gt;&gt; So what how horrible it would be if the audio plays and we sit back there in the room and we're back there talking and the bridegrooms passed out and then after he passed out, I passed out. Then all the groomsman passed out and all y'all sitting on here waiting for the visual. Well, just keep on playing the audio. Just keep on playing the same song. Well, I'll tell you one thing. It's going to be hard for that little girl to marry that song. &gt;&gt; Amen. I ain't marrying no tape player. I ain't marrying no tapes. I'm marrying a person, the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. Now, watch how the prophet and his way lays this out. Every time he appears, something happens and we see the time getting close. Now, watch the word sympathy. Look at what this now. It's amazing because you know you'd think sympathy would be feeling sorry for something. Oh no. You see there's a musical term for sympathy. And it proves if you listen to when brother Rab says this several places he actually apologizes and said I I guess I'm using the wrong word. It shows that he didn't even humanly himself know that this was a musical term. So he actually apologizes for using the word. Well, it kind of makes you wonder who is doing the talking then sometimes, don't it? Kind of makes you wonder if it was not the great composer himself that actually used brother Random and it must have been a question within himself or maybe people were sitting there looking at him funny and he thought that he had used the wrong word. Come on. &gt;&gt; Sympathy in music refers to a short often instrumental piece sometimes called a begatella. Oo, what a big fancy word that acts as a homage or a reculum for someone special. Oh, so the symphony now, what is that? That's a bunch of different people playing different instruments and they're all playing the same song, which is amazing to get them all on the same page at the same time playing the same song. But then the sympathy part is for someone special. So, it's a sp a special thing that's going on inside the drama. And the music is leading up to the introduction of someone special. Oh my. You mean sort of like our special bridegroom and the special bride that's going to be joined together. And we didn't just need the term symphony in this day, but we also needed the word sympathy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at this. And three kinds of believer. And we are at the closing of the history of the world. The book is now being finished. The last line will be wrote across. It someday shall be closed up. Then time will be no more. There is a great drama being set and angels are standing over the skies watching. You know what a drama is? The actors are ready. You can see them acting. You can see the evil one acting. Now, the devil's got a part in this drama. Aren't you glad you didn't get his part? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The devil has got a part. Now, God knew God knew that there must be evil displayed, but he could not make any of the angels do it. So, he placed and created this being on a basis to where he could choose. And in his soul that day on Calvary 1960, Satan sin. What was the origination of sin? It was in him. What happened? Did he smoke a cigarette? Nope. Didn't do any of that sort of thing first. But sin began in him when he said, "I will exalt my throne above the stars of God." Can't you see why God hates pride and arrogance so much? So notice then there there's a part of that. Now there's also then a part of demons which were part of the angelic host in the beginning but they were not elect. Now remember Paul calls a certain element of the angels of God elect angels but there are other angels which were not elect. They were given great authority and they still have that. They have the ability to appear disappear. They can do all kinds of great things. No doubt about it. But yet they were not elected. They are part of the drama on the negative side. There will be true prophets. There will be false prophets. There will be true pastors. There will be false pastors. There will be true churches. There will be false churches. It's part of the drama. Now watch. He goes on in three kinds of believers. But you can also see the rapture church. Now watch the drama. You can also see the rapture church making herself ready. It's a great scene. &gt;&gt; So the rapture church is making herself ready. Isn't that an unusual term? But you can see the rapture church making herself ready. Now, wouldn't that seem backwards to say it that way? You'd think that we'd say, "Well, she's making herself ready so she can go in the rapture." No, actually, she's got to be raptured first, translated into the kingdom of his dear son, so she can get ready. &gt;&gt; There ain't no way in the world any mortal can get ready on their own to be able to enter into the kingdom of God. He has to translate our soul before he translates our body. Woo! Praise God. It's a great scene. You can see the presence of God. Amen. Vindicating and making the great drama that's foretold here in this Bible to act itself out. To act itself out. Friends, every one of us in this building tonight, we have been given a part of the drama. Oh, what a great thing it would be if every person here under the sound of my voice and those who are are part of our church that are not here tonight. If every one of us would go to the great writer himself, who is also the one who composed the music, who is also the one that give all the life to this animation and made it real and would say, "Father, I believe you call me. I believe you love me. I believe you chose me. Help me, father, to find my part in the drama. If it's just a little bitty guy, you know, to maybe play a little roll on the drum every now and then. Or maybe I'll wait to the very end, right at the end time. And my little part is I take these little tiny symbols and when everybody's written just getting ready to come to a close, I go and that's all I do. I live 30 years of my life for you. I live 50 years of my life and I have one little part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know that I'll ever forget it. As a little boy, I remember at my uncle Harold's church there, they was real big on Christmas plays and they did the Christmas play by Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol. And I started acting early really. And my part in the play was I was Tiny Tim. You remember it, Harry? My goodness, it's been &gt;&gt; how many decades ago has that been? So I was Tiny Tim and a man by the name of Dave Rednau. He was my daddy. Tiny Tim Cratchet his name, something like that. And I mean, I had to go to all the practice. I had to be there for everything. Then other people had to memorize lines and lines and more lines and more lines. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I just had a few words to say at the very end. Y'all remember what Tiny Tim said? Okay. All right. And I But I had to be at all the practice. I had to go to every service. &gt;&gt; I had to stand there and clap my hands even though I never got to sing a special. I had to, you know, to pray and read my Bible and go to church and be faithful and pay my tithes and nobody ever called me to sing a special song. I'm speaking to you now in a metaphor. You understand what I'm saying? I had to do all of that and be there and sweat like I don't know what, you know, just singing, "Oh, I hope they don't mess up. I hope they don't mess up." And then my little line right at the very end and Dave Red and I are standing up there holding me in his arms and everybody did their part. my the hours they put into that and then it come my little time and you know what my face flushed red probably is right now I can feel it all over me right now I I I was so scared to death and I thought donnie you've only got one little line you've only got a few few words and may God bless us all may God bless us all you thought I was the main actor no I was not the main actor &gt;&gt; but I was the last one speaking Oh my god, children. Think of it. God raised up Paul and Luther and Wesley and Pentecost and they've done so much for the kingdom of God. It's not that we're trying to outdo them. We're not trying to outdo anybody else. We just want to find our part. If I ain't got nothing to say, but right at the end, let me say it. Well, young people, you've got something to do in this drama. It ain't just for the old people. It ain't just for the preacher. Every one of you are called by God. You're chosen by God. You're ordained by God to take your part in the Father's drama. Oh, come every service. Pray, read your Bible, be faithful if you ain't got nothing to say but [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Well, some of you couldn't explain the seven seals to me to save your life. You couldn't tell me the dates of the church ages. You couldn't tell me the messenger. You couldn't tell me this and that and the other. But some of your part, you know what it'll be? Amen, Lord. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it, God. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "Is that important to God?" Ask Hattie Wright when you see her. That ain't nothing but the truth. That was Hattie Wright's part, Harry. Oh my. She didn't have to study like brother Benham. She didn't have to have the visions like brother Benham did. But when it come time and the father's drama opened up and had his little house, &gt;&gt; glory to God, had was pulsated by the same spirit of God that pulsated our prophet. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You imagine the angels of God standing in the room waiting for Addie. What are you going to say? Brother Bren, that ain't nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, you imagine the rich and the famous people that come to Brother Brenham. The rich woman that he talked about, where was it down in Florida had enough rings on her hand and said, "Send missionaries around the world seven times or something like that." You know, had her hand all propped up there. He said, "Put it down here." Said big old fat looking hand. said, "Pull it down here." Should come down like this. I guess wanting him to kiss it. Elijah kissing hands. He might bite your finger off him maybe, but he sure going to bow to no dower or no countest or nothing like that. I'll tell you one thing. I'd rather have my part in the drive of God to be the most important person in the world. If you was the richest person in the world, it'll only last for so long. Somebody will outdo you. Mark Cuban or Trump or somebody else will put you to shame. Come on, somebody. If you're the greatest singer, if you're the greatest preacher, it'll be short-lived. But if you fulfill your part in the drama, eternity will contain you and the great archives of God. If you ain't got no more to say than amen, Lord, so be it unto me according to thy word. [Applause] You can see the presence of God vindicating and making the great drama that's foretold here in this Bible to act itself out. What a time to live. The most glorious time. The man of all ages has long for this time. The prophets of old long to see this hour &gt;&gt; but wasn't privileged. You're blessed. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm fighting such battles. I'm going through this and the other. Quit focusing on that negative stuff all the time. &gt;&gt; I know you're going through battles. I know you're going through trial. But you got so many blessings. You ought to go to counting them instead of counting your trials. Anybody tell me where the Bible says count your troubles. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You've got so much to be grateful for today. I had to borrow $5 to come to church. You say, "Brother Donnie, I had to come to church hungry. Let me know. I'll take you out and buy you a hamburger after church. But I'll tell you one thing. You've got life, ain't you? You got breast, ain't you? You got a church to go to, don't you? You got a man of God preaching to you tonight. You got saints of God that love you. You got angels of God that are in this building right here tonight to minister unto you of salvation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now let's let's move into this realm that God knew we would need divine help. So he allowed beings that would be able to influence us and help us to act out our part. Now remember, Rebecca didn't calculate this and figure it all out. Rebecca had an angelic visitor. &gt;&gt; 30 minutes before Elizer got there &gt;&gt; and that angel told her to go to the well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch in Hebrews chapter 1:13. But to which of the angels said he at any time &gt;&gt; set on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foottool? Are they not all &gt;&gt; ministering spirits &gt;&gt; sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs &gt;&gt; of salvation &gt;&gt; sinless holy beings &gt;&gt; which have never thought one thing wrong never uttered one wrong word never done one thing wrong. And yet God created them to be your ministers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The greater to help and assist the lesser. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; But only the lesser for a while. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz actually you are greater than they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll let you think on that for a bit. Psalms 103 verse20. Bless the Lord, &gt;&gt; you his angels that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. Bless ye the Lord, all ye his host, ye ministers of his that do his pleasure. Now remember, they're not preachers, but they're ministering spirits sent to minister unto you and I. Now, they can also do natural things like the angel of the Lord come in amongst the camp one time and slew 185,000. of the enemies of Israel in one night. No nukes, &gt;&gt; no tomahawks, &gt;&gt; 2 Kings 19:32. Therefore, thus sayeth the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, he shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow, not even one, nor come before it with a shield, nor cast a bank against it. By the way he came, by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord. For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake. Glory to God. It wasn't that they deserved it. It wasn't that they done everything right. God did it for his own sake. Oh, I hope one of these days you're going to see it. The very reason you're saved is for his sake. The very reason he loves you, the abundance of grace and mercy and revelation and kindness beyond what we all deserve. Can anybody say amen to that? He ain't doing it because we're so good and sweet and kind and lovely. He's doing it for his own sake. Hallelujah. He ordained a bride and there ain't enough devils in hell to stop him from accomplishing that part of the drama. He can go plum over to the back of the book and have the drama done shut up in prophecy and say the end. Hallelujah. Tell me who can reverse it. &gt;&gt; For my own sake and for my servant David's sake. You mean to tell me God will kill 185,000 people for the sake of a man &gt;&gt; who committed adultery. &gt;&gt; A man who numbered the people. A man who disobeyed God. &gt;&gt; But I want you to notice how God put David in with his own. God said for my sake and for David's &gt;&gt; cuz we're buddies. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't ask for a better buddy. Buddy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God. &gt;&gt; And it came to pass that night that the angel of the Lord went out and smoked in the camp of the Assyrians 104 scorn 5,000 185,000. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it wasn't that the Assyrians got up. They arose. They didn't arise. When Israel got up, &gt;&gt; 185,000, God had took care of every one of them in one night. Well, probably didn't even take them a night, just a matter of a minute or two. And they were all dead corpses. Let me tell you something, friends. Our God has got the same power tonight. Come on, somebody preach with me. And if my God wants somebody to live in this life, they can live. If my God calls them home, there ain't enough preachers. There ain't enough churches to pray to keep them here. If it's God's time for them to come home, they're going home. But they ain't going home. But God is ready. I'll tell you. And I read this boy. I really throw it right at the devil with both barrels. I said, "Did you hear that, devil? You can't take this man, that woman, my daughter, this woman's husband, that son. You can't do it because you want to. Our life is in the hands of Almighty God, not even in her own hands. [Applause] Now look at your identification &gt;&gt; before angelic beings based upon your confession and your belief about the Lord Jesus. Luke 12:8 also I say unto you, whosoever shall confess me &gt;&gt; before men shall the son of man also confess &gt;&gt; and the word is say the same thing &gt;&gt; before the angels of God. So, you're talking about Jesus to your boss, talking about Jesus to your mama, your daddy, whoever it is. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is talking about you &gt;&gt; before the angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. What an honor. &gt;&gt; Now, reversal of that in verse n. But he that denieth me &gt;&gt; before men shall be denied &gt;&gt; before the angels of God. &gt;&gt; It's probably a good thing that this scripture wasn't written after the crucifixion because Peter to put his finger on that scripture. said, "I I I I can't come back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I can't come back. &gt;&gt; Depends on who you are." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, if your confession is you are his before the world began, &gt;&gt; tell me what can happen in time that'll ever change what he said about you. &gt;&gt; But there ain't no question about it. We've all lost friends and there's things people said about us and we think, "Woo! Boy, I'll tell you one thing. I don't know if I ever want to be close to them or not." But that's the difference between us and God. We don't know what our friends will do. We don't know what our brothers and sisters do. You don't know what your own family will do to you for it's all said and done. But he knew everything I'd do to him and looked at me and said, "I love you anyhow and there ain't nothing you can do down there that'll ever turn me against you." You know what? I believe the Lord Jesus looks at us as I brought up Mphibicheth on Sunday. I believe the Lord Jesus looks at us, brother Joel, through the eyes of empathy and also sympathy and also in a sense of humanity. He sees our failures. He sees our weaknesses and he actually feels sorry for us knowing that we are captured prisoners in this humanity. and knowing in a moment of time when he releases us from this body, we will never be that way again. Because in our soul, we are not that way now. Oh, hallelujah to God. He knows one day we'll get a body that'll match his thought. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, we looked at Peter the other night, the angels of God opening the prison door. Look again in Acts 5:18. Look at some of the relations that angels has with men on the earth. They laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth. But does he open every prison door? &gt;&gt; What if death faces you? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What if some type of sickness this that the other? sometimes if that's the way he's going to take you from the earth. You can cry, you can pray and do all you want to do. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Notice again Acts 12 21. Look at Herod. And upon a set day, Herod arrayed in royal apparel and sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, "It is the voice of a God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. not of a man. And immediately the angel of the Lord smokeote him because he gave not God the glory. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine this man must have made such a powerful impressive speech and all God wanted him to do was just say, "Father, thank you for helping me to be able to say these words." Come on. Reminds me of preachers. &gt;&gt; Come on. Boy, I'll tell you one thing. I preached this great message. I've done this. I've done that. The other. You want the angel of God to smite your height. &gt;&gt; Give God glory. &gt;&gt; Give God glory for your 1,385p part series. Give God the glory for the mysteries that you preach. Give God the glory for every person you've laid your hands on and they've got healed. Lest the angel of the Lord smite you. &gt;&gt; Now look how they interact with human beings. They can minister life or encouragement &gt;&gt; or take your life. &gt;&gt; I want to be on the right side of these angels, don't you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here is part of the mystery which actually was kept secret from the angels and it pertains to the mystery of God, the incarnation of the word itself in humanity. This is astounding scripture to me. Hebrews 1:5. For under which of the angel said he at any time, thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee. And again, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And again, when he bringeth in the firstborn into the world, he saith, "Let all the angels of God worship him." So you mean angels had to be told to worship Jesus Christ. Testing. One, two. One, two, one, two. &gt;&gt; Sound check. Sound check. Why would angelic beings have to be told to worship him? &gt;&gt; Because they knew better than to worship what was supposed to be creation. &gt;&gt; That's idolatry. to worship creation as Paul said they worshiped the creature more than the creator. &gt;&gt; So for you to worship creation &gt;&gt; instead of the creator &gt;&gt; that's idolatry. So whether it's your job or your home or your wife or your mother, your father, your career, your body, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; To go to the gym and work out and stand in the mirror and selfies all over everywhere and show your big muscles. Uh-huh. You know what you're doing? You're worshiping the creature. &gt;&gt; Now, what was it about the Lord Jesus, hey, that the angels of God would have to be instructed if they understood &gt;&gt; the work of incarnation? &gt;&gt; Why would they need to be told, "Let the angels of God worship him?" Boy, I'm going to hear from this one, ain't I? I'm sorry y'all had never noticed this in your Bible. Now notice he saith to them and again when he bringeth the firstborn into the world he saith let all the angels of God worship him. So you see for those of us who understand the mystery or at least this part of it of the Godhead once again it testifies to us he is not a creature of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Father had to illuminate the angels of God as they saw what looked like a human being. &gt;&gt; He had to illuminate them. This is not just a creature. This is me &gt;&gt; in another form. &gt;&gt; Why? They didn't see it. They didn't understand. Even the angels of God, brother Nathan, had to be instructed. Worship him. It's me. &gt;&gt; It's me in another form. &gt;&gt; But he looks so much human. Oh my. Then what do they do? Don't you understand? He had to enlighten them before he was born or they would have never went down there and sung. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They would have never went down there and worshiped him the way they did &gt;&gt; because they was looking at it from Oh, hallelujah to God. They was looking at it from a holy angelic perspective. This had been hid in the very heart of God since the foundation of the world. And they didn't have a clue. There's no way that they can worship a creature. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; sure. &gt;&gt; They worshiped the creator. That's all they knew. But the creator had to illuminate them. &gt;&gt; Hey, it's me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wrote this part of the drama for myself. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. So, Father had to send out this message to these beings. Let all the angels of God worship him. And I look around think isn't a woman carrying him. I mean, how how could God a baby? &gt;&gt; How could this speak? &gt;&gt; But you imagine when the angels heard it, they do like we do sometimes. They still might not have understood. They said, "Glory to God." He said, "Worship. I'm going to worship." [Applause] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't feel nothing, but I'm going to worship anyhow. &gt;&gt; He said, "Worship him. I'm going to worship him with all my heart." the the mystery will further be unveiled. Oh, was it ever unveiled? &gt;&gt; Let all the angels of God. Now, had they known, had they seen this, Harry, don't you understand how this annihilates trinitarian doctrine, &gt;&gt; if Jesus was a pre-existing son there before the father, and the father and the son had a conversation like an old man and a young man, they would have known who he was. He would have stepped down off of that secondary throne and they'd say, "Well, the son in here, he's gone. I guess that's him down there." But it was so mysterious &gt;&gt; that even the angels didn't see it. &gt;&gt; Lord God &gt;&gt; to worship any creature is idolatry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pure worship is to worship the creator. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you understand friends why many people they actually worship their church. They worship their pastor. They worship their job, their work. They become so work alcoholic. They're worshiping their work. They're worshiping their job. They're in love. They're in love with being a businessman. They eat it. They drink it. They they think it. They dream about it. It's everything. It's it's an idol. Any creature that we worship &gt;&gt; is idolatry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man was made to worship one thing only, &gt;&gt; the creator. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I've got a preacher friend of mine that will not wear sunglasses. Because he says every time that he puts on sunglasses, he gets an attitude. Ain't that something? I guess Mr. Cool, you know. So he gets an attitude. So you know what? He won't wear them. I went to Maine several years ago to preach there and there's a brother come pick me up at the airport and hide on blue jeans which what I normally wear. I noticed him looking at me funny and he asked me if he could talk to him. I said, "Sure." He said, "Brother Donnie, I was in the world. I was a hippie. I was this, this, this." You know, just going through different types of things and tell him, he said, "I just can't wear blue jeans. I I just can't do it." He told me some other things. I just can't do that. I said, "Brother, I understand that that relates to you to the to the world out there. &gt;&gt; Somehow another that relates to you in that way." I said, "But I wasn't out there." &gt;&gt; I like these blue jeans. &gt;&gt; You do know a Jew made them. &gt;&gt; Come on now, &gt;&gt; Levi Strauss. Jewish. &gt;&gt; A lot of things in your home and in your life, &gt;&gt; Jewish ideas. Why? God said, "Through you, I'll bless the world." You're putting them on every day, &gt;&gt; leaving your sisters in skirt form. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when we Oh, Lord, shutter me. When we take pride and I achieve this, I've done that. I've done this. Don't you understand why Paul had to have that thorn in the flesh? Even Paul, the great man, he was filled with the Holy Ghost. But he said, "Lest I should be exalted above measure." Not because he built a beautiful building, not because he was this, that or the other, but because God had showed him a revelation which was above or superior to his brothers. &gt;&gt; And God had to let that devil aggravate Paul and aggravate Paul to keep this old flesh from his from getting lifted up. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Why? Then Paul would go to worshiping the creature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for our place. But we never want to make an idol out of this place. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I've been over here so much this summer doing this and that and the other and there's very few times that I pulled in that driveway just like today. I didn't look at and said, "Lord, thank you so much for your blessing and we're so grateful." But we never want to worship creation or to create or a creature. We want to keep all of our worship. Well, friend, this is why I'm not against you playing a basketball game. I'm not against you out there running and this and that and the other. But whenever that becomes your soul love and your desire and you love sports more than you love the Lord Jesus, don't you understand what you're doing? You're worshiping a creation of man. &gt;&gt; It would be wrong and sinful for us to even worship the stars which were created by God. But we would be worshiping a creation, not the creator. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, here's the mystery. He was totally man and yet totally God. &gt;&gt; But Jesus Christ is glorified humanity. And the angel could not tell Mary to call him Lord Jesus Christ when he was born. Come on now. &gt;&gt; But thou shalt call the human tense name &gt;&gt; human &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ wasn't even mentioned the four gospels. If you read your Bible &gt;&gt; when did it come into mention? Book of Acts and the epistles of Paul. Why? He wasn't Lord Jesus Christ yet. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; But when the father comes in him, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he becomes the Christ. Now listen carefully. He was not even the Christ yet. &gt;&gt; He lived on this earth as a man for 30 years without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You imagine the angels looking at him and said, "Who is this? What is this? I mean, what what's going on? &gt;&gt; And then the father slips down in the form of a dove &gt;&gt; and fills him with himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You imagine when the angels of God finally catch him. I said, "What a plan." Don't you understand what happened? The audio finally caught up with the video. &gt;&gt; So, what did God do? The audio. This is my beloved part of the drama in whom I am pleased to dwell. The symphony, the symphony, the drama, the father, the son. Hallelujah. It all come together right there in the river. No wonder the angels of God stood there. They say, "Oh my God, oh my." So this this is so that was Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. That was Isaac and Rebecca. You imagine that one angel jumping up and said, "Glory to God." I see it for the first time. That's why I was sent down there to Rebecca, Lord have mercy. I didn't even know that's what it was. You mean he's Isaac? She's like, "Oh my goodness, this is awesome. This is awesome. Glory. &gt;&gt; If the angels would have worshiped Jesus and he was the second person of the Godhead and Aryanism started projecting in the first century that he was a lesser god and a lesser creation actually created being. Then God the Father would have been telling holy angels to idol worship. &gt;&gt; They would have been worshiping a creature. &gt;&gt; But brother Donnie, brother says he was the beginning of the new creation. He sure did. But that new creation did not have a day necessarily when it started. It was an attribute from the eternal. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Let me just go ahead and bring it to you tonight. You didn't have a day when you had started. &gt;&gt; Or you might might have come up to the altar. The prophet said you wouldn't saved on any certain day. You always was saved in the mind of God. You always was saved. He just had to bring you to a recognition of it. And you' be able to recognize who you already were by the grace of God. Hallelujah. Don't you understand how the bride must see who she is in the last day in order for the rapture to go? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 1:14. Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them? sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation. So a ministering spirit is one that is sent employed to execute the divine will of God. To who? Heirs. &gt;&gt; Angels are not errors of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's those who render aid to others and help sent forth appointed by God. Remember God sending Gabriel in Daniel 9. Daniel needed understanding and the angel come and ministered to him. Oh Jesus. Let me go ahead and say it. One of the highest honors given to angelic beings is a coming minister &gt;&gt; to the heirs of salvation &gt;&gt; oh you and I think oh my the highest honor would be there to stay around his throne. No they've dealt with him on a firsthand basis and they've seen how he looks. They've seen how he's so touched by our needs. And they've seen what it does to him. Such is the love and the care that God has toward his people. Are they not all ministering spirits sent to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation? So they are employed by almighty God to come and minister to the heirs on the father's will. Notice Hebrews 2:1. Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by angels were steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward. Now, remember what I read to you last Wednesday night in Galatians 3:19. Therefore then serveth it the law. It was added because of transgression till the seed should come to whom the promise was made. It was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Yet here Paul says the word spoken by angels. If the word spoken by angels, how shall we escape? Verse three, if we neglect so great salvation was first at the beginning spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard it. Hebrews 2:9. But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels. You imagine it's their holy eyes beheld this and in their angelic thinking and thoughts they're thinking how can how can we worship something that is less than us. But notice Paul's terms. But we see Jesus, not the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But we see Jesus, the house, the human temple. But we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels, far the suffering of death. But what do we see about Jesus? crowned crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of God. Do you understand how Jesus did this? By the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to have the grace of God. Not to forgive him of his sins, not to forgive him of his wrong, but to give him the ability as a human &gt;&gt; to carry out the will of God. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember this scripture, 1 Timothy 3:16. And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. God God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels. Now, why is this a mystery? That the angels would see God. And Paul is putting in this verse these remarkable events. For without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. For God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, alluding to they had never seen him before. That's right. &gt;&gt; In this form of the drama &gt;&gt; scene of angels. &gt;&gt; Why is that remarkable? If they seen him for millions of years, &gt;&gt; it was a desire. It was a secret. But they saw the secret made manifest. And the angels of God could say, "I have heard, but now I see." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I have seen him. seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, received on in the world, received up into glory. Who was God? &gt;&gt; Let me close with this. Revelation chapter 4 part three. You notice these cherubams that John saw there must have been interested in keeping the tree of life. So they must be interested in human beings. Or read Genesis getting back to Genesis again. They kept the tree of life and guarded it. The way of life. The way of life. How is the way? Jesus said, "I am the way. I am the bread that come from God out of heaven. If a man eats this bread, he'll live forever." Now, there was a way back to that tree of life. You get it? Now, this I want to show you now and make sure this sure it's at an altar. Now, there must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden. And I'll tell you why. You remember both Cain and Abel come up there to worship. So, that showed that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden. And the only way back to Eden, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; is back by the altar. Here you are again. See, back to Eden through the altar. And they were to keep the way there to guard it. They couldn't get back there until the altar was covered with blood. Oh, God. Can't people see it? Nothing but the blood. There has to be an atonement, a mercy seat. This altar of judgment must become a mercy seat. A stand. So the cherubims over the ark of the covenant faced each other and looked down toward the mercy seat, which was the seat that cherubim sat on. They weren't looking at each other. They wasn't looking up this way. They weren't looking at their neighbor, but they was looking down at the mercy seat, trying to understand. As Peter said about the Holy Ghost, the angels of God stooped down &gt;&gt; to look into and understand. Praise God. Let all the angels of God worship him. I guarantee you one thing. They didn't need to be told that 583,000 times. They were told one time and from that time on they've done it ever since. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, if we're his bride, we shouldn't have to be told it 583,000 times either. &gt;&gt; It ought to be something in our soul. It ought to be something that responds even in our emotions. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Don't you love him? Look at what is in your diary. I I need just a couple more minutes. So angels are sent to give us strengths to resist temptation. strength was furnished to our Lord Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane in Luke 22:43. Angels come and ministered to him. And imagine he is there thinking, "I've worshiped him. I've adored him. I've loved him. I've worshiped him. But now he needs my strength." Remember in Matthew 4 and Luke 4 as well, whenever he was tempted of the devil, he fasted and he was tempted of the devil and the angels of God came and ministered unto him. So here he is. He's fixing to face Calvary and he needs angelic help. Oh children, this is why we want to live right. This is why we want to live clean. &gt;&gt; Can't you see why the majority of Christendom, they'll never have these visitations? They live filthy lives. Their homes are ungodly. They're they're they're everything about them is their church members. They're less of sins. They're naked. They're wretched. They're blind. They're they're naked. They're pitiful. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But if you and I live right and clean before the Lord, we have promises that when we get to a spot in our garden, we think we can't go no further. Father can dispatch angels to us. If you'll think back real, real real close, you'll probably remember times in your life when you wasn't sure. You just wasn't sure. Maybe you was praying. You felt nothing. You had no tears. You had no anointing. You had nothing. But somehow another when you got done, you just had a little bit more of a desire. Something just really happened. If God would have opened your eyes and you'd look standing there by you, &gt;&gt; it would have been your angel, &gt;&gt; which is yourself in another dimension. &gt;&gt; That'll about blow your brain, won't it? No, question me if you want to on next Wednesday night. It's up to you. Or you can take my word for it tonight. Can you imagine angels of God coming, ministering, helping us, aiding our faith. I don't know about you, I need them. I need them, brother. &gt;&gt; I need them. &gt;&gt; Why shouldn't I receive from them? &gt;&gt; Brother, how will I know if it's a if it's a true angel or a fallen angel? Easy. They'll never leave the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your angel will never come from heaven and say, "Well, Brandon was a false prophet. He was a deceiver and a liar." You point your finger in that angel's face and say, "Go right back to hell where you come from." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Angel will never leave the word &gt;&gt; and it'll come to minister. &gt;&gt; Now, we know that when he ministered, Jesus did not regain the anointing. No, the anointing left him in the garden of Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; So, he didn't minister anointing, but strength. Strength for what? The journey to the cross. Praise God. How many loves him with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Isn't this awesome tonight? &gt;&gt; Isn't this awesome? &gt;&gt; I don't know, maybe it's just me, but kind of makes me wonder if we haven't maybe ptook of a little angel's food tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Do you honestly think them angels ate that bread? You honestly think them angels in heaven took that bread off of their table and it was actually their physical bread. What did Jesus say about bread? My bread is to do the will of him that sent me. So bread isn't just always what we put in our mouths. It's what we do. Angels of God are right here in this building tonight to share angels food with you. &gt;&gt; The strength for you to do the father's will. &gt;&gt; They're not faced by temptations by lurements. Women don't bother them, brothers. Lying, gossiping, pride, arrogance, it don't bother them. But they're here to share. They're here to minister to you. I can preach the word to you. And an angel couldn't stand here tonight and take my iPad. He's not called to preach. But he can minister angelic realms, spiritual realms that I cannot do and no other man can do. Praise God. Boware heads if you would. If fallen and malignant angels come to tempt, to try to test, why would it be hard for us to believe that those who have maintained their position for millennia, for eternity, God would not send them to us to help us. Praise God. Oh, hallelujah. Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads tonight, Lord, I pray you'd help us. I'm sure they're probably some of them their minds running 90 miles an hour would say trying to think Lord what in the world that's about the way I was when I started looking at this and thinking dear God dear God thank you father thank you, oh Jesus. Apparently, Lord, preaching in these last hours needs to be in a way that the first church age didn't need it. They needed strength for sacrifice and strength to be martyrs and strength, oh God, in that anointing of that day. Most of us will never be a martyr, but we're fighting against the powers of hell in a way that no other age has faced them. And the culmination of seven church ages, the weight of it is laying on our shoulders tonight. The weight of it is laying on the true men of God to preach the word. And yet, Father, we've never had such opposition. preachers haven't even in the ranks of the message. Who ever thought that preaching would be so laughed at and made fun of and people trying to get preachers to sat down and quit preaching. It can be expected for the world to do that. but inside our own ranks and to try to take the prophet's message and prove that preachers should sit down and only press play to take the very message that you sent to the earth to restore our hearts back to the original faith &gt;&gt; and try to pull out quotes and put things together and to make it appear to the ignorant that preachers should not preach. What spirit would be on a man that would try to get any man or woman to discourage men of God from preaching? And your prophet never laid hands on tape players. And does God change his mind about his word in 41865 in the evening service? He never laid his hands on realtore recorders. They didn't have, of course, CDs and digital format in that day, but he laid his hands on men. Men. So, if we don't do the same, we're not preaching nor believing nor acting like the messenger did. I pray you would anoint your men's servants like never before. In reality, Lord, it's just the little squirrel like the prophet saw the little chipmunk. Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter. Days of miracles has passed. Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter. All the preachers sat down. Chatter, chatter, chatter, chatter. But we're going to preach. They don't like it. We're preaching harder. We're preaching more. Stop preaching. Huh? That's exactly what the devil would want. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord God, help us, Father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many would raise your hands tonight to God and say, "Lord, help me to understand greater what I've heard here tonight. &gt;&gt; Give me greater understanding, Lord." If you need to go back and listen to it again, listen to it, friends. Read these scriptures. Read these quotes. They're the truth. &gt;&gt; Ponder and meditate what the Lord has in your diary, little brother. It's right there in your case, your little suitcase as it was as you're riding on the camel train heading back to our Isaac. Praise God. An angel introduced her. You say, "Brother Donnie, some of this stuff is pretty far out." I know it's far out. We need far out stuff to take us far out. &gt;&gt; Same old same old church as yesterday. Church is as usual. That ain't going to get us out of this world. &gt;&gt; It's going to take a body changing message to get us out of here. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It ain't something that leaves the scripture. It's right in the scripture. I proved these things to you tonight from God's word. The mystery has been revealed. Think of it, friends. We're living in the day. You imagine if Paul would have been here tonight, he'd have probably tore this church up. If Peter would have been here tonight, he'd been running and screaming, "Glory to God. I never even seen it that plain when I was here. If James was here, oh my, the brothers, imagine if I don't know how that dimension works, but if they could have heard it on beyond the curtain of time tonight, they'd probably been saying, "Amen. Preach it. Preach it." You're going to get them to a place they're going to call us out of the sixth dimension. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And we're going back to Earth to take up bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh Jesus, help us. &gt;&gt; Can we just raise our hands now? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, beginning with me tonight. Lord, help me Jesus. Lord God, increase my understanding. Father, I don't want to lean on my own understanding or human reasoning, but Lord Jesus, upon your anointing of this hour, Father, how we thank you for the message of the word of God. It didn't come to replace our Bible. These scriptures have been laying right here, Father, for thousands of years. But now the drama is catching up with the audio. The audio and the video are synchronizing together and the echo is getting less and less. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. But when the spirit and the bride are saying, "Come," John didn't hear an echo between the two voices. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride was saying, "Come, come, come, come, come." No, there wasn't an echo. The spirit said, and then an echo and then the bride finally said it, but they were synchronized. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, we thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Father, Brother Tim sent me a text there the other day after their meeting that backsliders had come back to you and people renewed their walk with you and different people got healed and things went on in their meetings down there last week. Thank you, Father. I text him back and said, "Praise God when one meeting closer to the rapture going home." &gt;&gt; Lord God, as we're heading over across the mountain, Father, this weekend to begin this camp, Lord, it might be the last young person that'll come in. It might be the last young person that'll get the Holy Ghost. We don't know. But we're looking for great things, Father. Hallelujah. The prophet tells us the final voice to the final age is in the bride. That's what the devil's really trying to shut up. Your voice. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you tonight, Father. May our lives reflect the father's drama. May the music, may the symphony, may the sympathy that's going to introduce some great person. And we know there's no great people among us. The only great one is our husband that's coming to take us away. Oh Jesus, we worship you, Lord. We praise you tonight, Father. Bless your holy name, Lord. Hallelujah, Jesus. We worship you tonight, Father God. May the angels of God, I don't have to pray that they'll come near because they're already here. They're already here among us. Your prophet said, "They don't come and go, but they can't near us all the time." They were with them on their job today. They were with the housewives at home when they fixing supper. They were with the brothers as they was driving home from work. they was witnesses was coming to the house of God. Then Lord, why would it be unusual for us to believe the angels of the Lord are right here in this service tonight? The prophet said it over and over again. May they take their positions there in the pews and down the aisles by the saints of God. Oh, surely them fallen angels are here, too. But we ain't hard even going to recognize they're even here. We're going to say we're under the influence of the angels of God. Oh, Father, for your saints that are down or weak or sick, whatever it is, may the angels of the Lord. Hallelujah. May they minister, Lord. I've ministered the word and done the best that I can in my limited ability. But now, Father, we're praying as your prophet messenger did over and over again. And he prayed that the angels would be able to minister to the needs of your children. granted tonight. Father, for the sick, we pray in the name of Jesus. May the angels of God drop that pulsation of faith to know the work has already been done. They're already healed. And if you were here yourself tonight, you couldn't heal them. It's already done. Maybe there's some that's weak, some that's weary, maybe they're feeling similar. No, no, let me restate that. They couldn't feel the way you felt in the Garden of Gethsemane. You were left. you were forsaken by God and by the angels we'll never be that low. But maybe to them may they think in their mind that they're that low. But heavenly father, oh we're so grateful that whenever you were at that spot you the angels of God come and minister to you what? Power to knock them devils out. Power to evade the cross. Power to accept the cross and embrace it. Then Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus strengthen your people tonight Lord. Hallelujah. Minister to us tonight, Lord Jesus. Our needs are great, but our God is greater. Our requests are many, but your power is multiple, multiple, multiple times beyond anything we could even ask or even think. Lord, we worship you tonight, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sing something, Harry. Let's Let's just worship him, can we? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Now, if the angels of God were told to worship him, and I believe tonight, if the voice of God would ring back down to us, what would he tell us? Worship him. Worship him. Bless his name. Praise his name. Whether there are two or three gathered together in my name, I am in their midst. And if he's here, he's here to heal. He's here to save. He's here to fill with the Holy Ghost. He's here to strengthen. He's here to encourage. Let's worship him. &gt;&gt; Let's worship him. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, we bless your name, Father. &gt;&gt; We worship you tonight, Lord Jesus. We don't worship you as a lesser creature. We don't worship you as a lesser God. We worship you as the first, the last, the alpha, the omega. We're so grateful tonight that we can see it, Lord. &gt;&gt; We can see it. You created yourself in a human form. Not another being, &gt;&gt; not a creation apart from yourself, but yourself in created form. But you had to make the mystery known to the angels &gt;&gt; or they wouldn't have worshiped you in their created form would just be illuminated. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, that's the way I was and as a trinitarian. &gt;&gt; I'd worship the father. I'd worship the son. I'd worship the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; But thank you for opening my eyes and helping me to see these three are truly one. We worship you tonight, oh Lord God. Hallelujah, Jesus. Oh, let's sing it together, saints, with all of our hearts. Raise your hands. Close your eyes. I'll let you go just just in a bit. I love him. Because he not they but he first loved me [Music] and purchase my thank you Jesus. Thank you my God. I bless your name. I worship you to that. How great you are. Who are we, Lord, that you'd share these awesome things, Father. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We praise you. &gt;&gt; I bless your name tonight, my God, my King. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. with all your hearts, children. With all your soul, &gt;&gt; brother Donnie, I don't feel anything. I don't either. But I'm going to praise him anyhow. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to love him anyhow. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Who knows? It might be my praise that brings the feeling. Hallelujah, Jesus. Hallelujah, Jesus. and purchase &gt;&gt; purchase my salation [Music] on Cal [Music] tree. [Music] Jesus is the sweetest name I know everybody now. And he's just the same [Music] as his holy lovely name. That's the reason why him. [Music] For Jesus is the sweetest name I know. [Music] Oh, Jesus is the sweetest name I know. [Music] And he's just the same as his holy name. And that's the reason why I love him. So for Jesus the sweetest name. Once again now, hands raised, eyes closed for the singing now. For Jesus is the sweetest name I know. And he's just the same as his lovely precious name. That's the reason why I love him so [Music] Jesus is the sweetest name I know. Hallelujah. Brother Daryl, Sister Cheryl, Sister Jessica, Lord willing, are leaving on Saturday to head to New Zealand for some meetings there. Brother Daryl kind of pulled a muscle this week in his back and really dealing with that. And I know that appreciate their prayers tonight. Brother Daryl physically and also for the trip there, God's grace. Can we pray for them together as we just before we go? Heavenly Father, we pray for our brother and our sisters as they depart this Saturday, Lord, on this long trip. You see, Father, what a journey that it is. And I just pray for them, Lord, that you'd give them strength and that you'd help them. You see, Father, that brother Daryl just moved a just a tub thing this week and just reached around and pulled it and Lord pulled something in his back and had to text me, Lord. And reaching out for prayer to myself and to others. Dear God, just hurting him so bad. Lord Jesus, we believe the angels of God are here tonight. Father, would you just touch our brother? Lord God, in the name of Jesus, my brothers have their hands laid over on his body. You suffered stripes in your back so brother Daryl could be healed in his. Father, we pray for him. May you go before them. May the angels of God go before them. Lord God, in this country out in the middle of nowhere down in the ocean, but yet Lord God, you got some seed down yonder. May the presence of God come among them in a mighty way. Anoint our brother like never before. May the presence of God come and visit them, Father. Give them fruit for their labor. We pray. We love you, Lord Jesus. We praise you tonight, Father. With all of our hearts, we worship you, mighty God. Hallelujah. We love you, Jesus. We love you, Lord Jesus. We worship you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're awesome in this place, mighty God. Let's just sing this together as we prepare to go. Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Remember us over over this week at the camp there. If you would, God will just go with us and help us there. Also, myself and the other brothers. I'm supposed to speak Saturday night and I imagine we'll be having a prayer line Saturday night after that. and then service again on Sunday morning. Uh so pray and we have some other brothers that'll be ministering as well. I know they would appreciate the prayers. Let's just sing it together as we go. And it been good to be in the house of the Lord. Praise the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; As I come into your presence, pass the gates of praise.

We certainly would appreciate your prayers tomorrow. We thank God for his grace and his mercy to help us and to give us strength, but we still have those moments. And of course, we still miss her and all of that. But I believe we're one service closer to being able to meet not only her, but all the rest of our loved ones that have gone. We so appreciate you helping us during this time.

I can only bow down and say you are awesome in this place. Mighty God, you are awesome in this place. I have a father. You are worthy of all praise. To you our lives we raise. You are awesome in this place. Mighty God, God bless you. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]
