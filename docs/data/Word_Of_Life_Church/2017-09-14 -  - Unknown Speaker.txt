Raleigh is gonna come and sing us a song and he this is if we all help him so it's a special and you get to help on the special you never can say again that I do ever did get to sing it's special because you're gonna sing a special right now all right where is brother Marcus sak come brother Marcus out you know we request your prayer for this family for several weeks now just not that long ago they've found their son 30 year old had passed away it's been the most difficult time of this man's life but God has done wonderful wonderful wonderful exploits in brother Marcus's life and it's just it has been a long conversation with you last night to see where he was to where God has brought him raised up in this message loves his truth more than he lives life and I want you to give him a nice hand he's gonna lead us in a song this morning but the markets come buddy [Applause] so it is now the promise to keep it short as I can't there won't be last night's conversation main reason I'm here outside of just had to see this brother again and the other brother who are you getting back the areas for the lineal there's I'm probably without any doubt the least among us there's one thing I've learned in my life and it's not just by reading the scriptures it's through experience what the power of prayer does you're looking at an individual that short of the prayers answered there's little doubt I wouldn't be here this morning some of you heard years ago my sister that played the organ for 40 years that we had a lot of great times in church singing I lost her lost my brother my mom the most tragic time of my life my son David that worked with me every day barely in the spring of his life we don't know why now other than God's time but I thought about this brother when he sent me word he's praying and I knew he would I knew he would and without getting into it God has answered some prayers or I wouldn't be standing here and I wanted to come to this assembly not because you're infamous and I wanted to see one doc but I wanted to say thank you I don't know if we always stop and look at her brothers and sisters and thank them for the prayers I wouldn't be here without your prayers I'll say this and I'll move on and he asked me about the singing I won't get into the reasons and some discredit to myself it's it's been many many years since I stood up and sang other than at funerals and weddings but it's a passion in my life and I gave me compliments beyond what I deserve so I'm not sure what it'll do today but the first thing I thought about if I seen like I said everybody's gonna join cuz if it croaks I know how to let you drown me out and another reason I chose this song you knows like Markus Falls songs you've seen today I've seen some beautiful that song you opened with was think you picked it for me but I'm gonna take this brief I was blessed to be able to visit the holy land we call it Israel two years ago and I the brother that led the location is that each place that we went to it was I cannot what it was like to listen to that brother stand on the Mount of Olives and deliver a little short sermon talk about the disciples come in that night or he pray and go back and they were asleep he brought it to life stood in the basement of the safest the high priests where we're told Christ meant that last night naked cold walk the streets where he bore that cross and just one thing after another stood at the base of what they call gall Gotha and felt it all come to life so real it was invited to go to a sunrise meeting the next morning that there's 6 a.m. on the banks of the Jordan River and the optics you couldn't have planned it you look out there and there's this ship and just like in the old days it's like they planned it but they didn't there was some fishermen throwing out their nets and I think all of that just build up something so deep in me that I said as simple as this song is we all know it it's one of the reasons but I said someday I'm almost seeing this song again in church because when that brother opened up the song victory in Jesus I tried to explain it last night I have never felt the power of God like I felt I was so engulfed in bawling-crying and i was amongst good denominational brass brethren you know I'm like hiding my face my chest is heaving I couldn't control it and I know that it was a culmination may be psychologically of everything I had witnessed that week but then I set there and it all came back to him I loved the Prophet I loved the ministry but it all came back to him so that's what I want to sing today all of us I heard an old old story I was Sadie came from glory whoa how he gave his life Oh calories just to say [Music] here's gone these precious blood told me would I leave opossums and one told [Music] Oh [Music] - something with his me-tv and all my love this to him for he pumps me to victories and he thought lance and flood well I heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing Lord you made too lame to walk again and he calls the blind to see right here Jesus come and heal my bruised but spirit somehow Thole victory in Jesus I say [Music] and all [Music] well I heard about that matching watch you pick me up and about go beyond Christmas [Music] just sing shun story and some sweet day Lord become a singer the songs are written [Music] launcher solving and reporting [Applause] [Music] yes - yeah we punch B to the 2d I say only something with his me [Music] or he punched me to [Music] I told you he can sing and Gary Hara being a smart aleck that he usually is I made a hits right in thank you [Applause] I made a remark over in the practice room I said when I first heard brother Marcus saying I said to myself I'll never sing again as long as I live Gary said we kind of wish you two stayed true to that so he's a smart aleck just like his wife god bless their hearts I love those folks Gary and Lona bless their heart you can be seated this morning praise the Lord did you enjoy that this morning amen now had some more songs lined up but I'm going to put them on hold just for a just for a week or so brother Aaron sister Lindsay was going to sing but I know they won't be mad at me if I don't let them this morning but the Harry's had a song he was going to sing for about three or four weeks and he finally agreed to do it this morning without much pressure actually his Nick's not too blue so but I want him to come and sing that song look this is the best time of your day you're out here whatever you do from here on out it's it's okay but this is the best time of your day let's just enjoy this brother Darrell's got an outstanding message that he's gonna bring to us you're in good company you're in the fellowship of the Lord what ask is yes for giving one more good hand clap of praise this morning you know brother Harry a nice hand to seek it's ready this thing [Applause] don't nobody be nervous I'm nervous enough for all of us as I have said before sometimes I tell brother Louie I got a song in my heart and then five minutes later I usually regret ever telling him that this song is kind of it's sounds like an older car song it's called Jesus is calling but I'm glad through my whole life Jesus has been calling and if Jesus has called you one time and you were the bride he's called you a hundred times as brother Danny's been going through the book of Solomon I I know many times in my life spiritually he's looked through the lattice and called my name and when I was cold or half back slid get too busy with things of like everybody and not pray like I should not read like I should and start getting cold on the Lord and I can start hearing call me Harry where are you I need you fellowship so whether you're just beginning or whether you're back slid or whether you're away from the Lord Jesus is calling and if he is calling you you're the richest man in the world you're much richer and Bill Gates if he's ecology anyway [Music] [Applause] how are you hurting and broken within overwhelmed by the weight of your sin Jesus is carving have you come to the end of yourself do you thirst for the dream from the world Jesus is calling or come to the altar the father's arms are open wide forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ leave behind your regrets and mistakes come the day there's no reason to wait Jesus is calling brings sorrows and trade them for joy from the ashes a new life is born Jesus is calling come to the altar the father's arms are open wide forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ [Music] oh come to the altar the father's arms are open wide forgiveness we spoke with the precious blood Oh heart is sad isn't he wonderful sing [Music] Christ is risen water say isn't he one wonderful sing halleluh christ is risen oh come to the altar the father's arms are forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ [Music] forgiveness was bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] this morning over there and I'm gonna make an exception this morning what you and sister Lindsay to come up here real quickly but you got to do this song for me Satan we're through can you do that Satan we're through Satan we're through somebody say it with us Satan we're through let's give these folks a nice hand as they sing for you we've been all over the spectrum this morning but it's ok it's ok don't get nervous for the higher cities they're nervous for everybody so but this song I'll ever hear these folks sing this song I want you to say you throw your heart with our good sister Lindsay give them that one more hand as they get ready [Applause] you can call me crazy you can say I'm a fool [Music] I'm not saying it's easy [Music] sometimes it seems so cruel woman I remember where I came and what you put me through [Applause] and devil are saying it through [Applause] and you turn me to oh gee the time [Music] I'm sayin we're through Lu maybe fee [Music] was so sad and blue when you may not be know just exactly what to do don't you touch me thank you friend me when you Oh Oh [Music] me too

[Applause] praise the Lord hey man devil were through you man I'm sure he's tore up about that he worked someone's over real good didn't he man praise the Lord certainly good they enjoyed the singing the presence of the Lord and brother Louie said you know it's it's really true this is the best time of our day right here you know and to know that we're making preparations and preparing and getting their voices all warmed up for that day when we gather over yonder said at daddy's table can you imagine can we have to have a body changes our human minds can even comprehend what that's going to be like in that Bank transit will not be one sick person might be one problem it won't be no author etic arms and won't be no paralyzed arms that keep worshiping there won't be no blinded eyes and then we'll all have hair praise the Lord yes it should be wonderful thing a man don't miss it whatever it whatever it takes don't know there's nothing here worth missing it over we can see that friends our nation is you know I love I love our nation now when I was a young boy my mom and daddy actually signed for me to go into the army I was even too young to join myself I had got my parent's signature but I went and I was in the airborne artillery over at Fort Bragg 18th Airborne Corps and you know I wanted to serve my country I wanted to and I'm not an American in my heart you know but it breaks my heart to see the condition that our nation is in this morning it does it breaks my heart but you know we know these kingdoms have to fall these things have to give way because there's coming a kingdom that will not fall you know and really that's the one I really belong to fish and so a man we just kind of such an honor to be here this morning if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of mark we want to read from mark the chapter 11 this morning starting at verse 12 amen I went to the lapel mic this morning so maybe think maybe it won't fall off I'm not exactly sure how that happened last night but anyway we want to read from mark chapter 11 this morning we greet once again in the name of the Lord Jesus and desire your prayers this week and me and brother Danny and brother Lindsey McGrady are heading down to Nicaragua to Chinon daga for some meetings up so we just desire your prayers we can get in and out safely amen I want to speak to you this morning on breaking the barriers of doubt breaking the barriers of doubt now I want to read this quote just before we read the scriptures and I want you to listen to what brother Branham says says the same thing by divine healing your sick people here this morning believe that and you've been born again and our sons and daughters of God Christ has all ready healed you the only thing that keeps you from being well this morning is a spirit hanging over you that won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promises that he's done it that's right now that's my Commission that's what God gave me it's what he gave every gospel preacher who will believe him the power and the authority to break that spirit I believe with all my heart that every demon power that's in here at this minute is already broken I do I believe there's every sick person in here right now feels a lot different if that's right he says raise up your hand you who was sick see there what's the matter the devil has broke away from you he has to faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Jesus Christ died for you amen Jesus Christ died for you and faith in the Word of God breaks Satan from away from you faith in the Word of God that Jesus died for you if he loved me enough to die for me surely he loves me enough to heal me and faith in the Word of God is what breaks Satan away from you amen breaking barriers now let's read mark chapter 11 verse 12 and on the morrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything their own and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eateth fruit of the hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remembrance said unto him master behold the fig tree which thou curses is withered away and jesus answered and said unto Him have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whoever who whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them it's the word of the Lord and when you stand praying forgive if you have any old against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you in your trespasses now why does he go from talking about all things are possible how faith in God why does he tie in this scripture on forgiveness why does he turn to that and start talking about forgiveness because we know that faith is based on forgiveness amen faith is based on forgiveness let's bow our heads this morning breaking barriers Heavenly Father thy word is true in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we look to you this morning thou who has placed the Holy Spirit within our hearts that it may lead us and guide us Lord may we less not ever wait Lord ever thought every barrier that Satan were trying to hinder us with this boredom and simply take you at your word Lord and father may they be great testimonies because you visited among us as our brother saying truly Lord there is victory in Jesus other be mindful of the folks down in Florida today we pray Lord as we just heard coming up the road over a million already's lost power father just be merciful to him we ask Lord as we commit these things into your hands for your glory and the Saints said god bless you may be seated this morning now in our scripture reading we find that our Lord was hungry and finding no FIGS on this tree he cursed it that it would never bear figs again but I want you to notice he never made a public show out of it he never said all right now everybody stop I'm fixing to do something and I'm fixing to speak I want everybody to hear what I'm going he never done that but just in passing he made a statement and Peter heard it and Peter hearing this the next morning when they were passing by Peter sees that the tree is starting to wither from the roots and he remarks to Jesus and he says look the tree is dried up you see Peter seen that the tree was dying and it broke to his remembrance that the Lord had cursed it and he says look look Lord the tree is dying what you said is happening aim ahead and Jesus turns to Peter and says have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whatsoever you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen but then we know it's got to be it's not just how personally asked him whatever comes to your mind but it's according to the will of God amen but if you said in your heart and don't doubt in his heart now doubt means to be uncertain about something to believe that something may not be true or that it's unlikely to be undecided to tend to distrust to disbelieve now when most of us think of doubt we think of that part of the definition that something may not be true or simply we don't believe it so as believers we think along these lines I'm not an unbeliever because I believe all things are possible how many believes that this one sure we believe all things are possible so we as a believer you say you know and I'm not trying to hinder your faith nor am I trying to make you an unbeliever but I want to make a point here I believe that we're believers and we get in the mind I'm a believer because I don't disbelieve it I don't distrust it but there's a part of the definition of doubt that I want us to look at just for a minute and that's part that says that it's unlikely or undecided because I think that's where many times we find ourselves yes we believe God's more than able to do anything but we have this barrier this barrier of doubt that hangs over us that hangs just above us that tells us it's unlikely that it'll happen to you or we're undecided yes gods a healer but will God heal me gods are delivered yes I believe God to deliver all things are possible but will God deliver me you say how many please there's a bride the church will raise their hands happy believes you're a part of it you don't get as many hands amen yes God's a healer none of us here this morning doubts that but Satan places over us a barrier will he heal me my brother Brenda said a spirit hanging over you that you won't fully let you go out yonder and believe God's promises he said brother what are you talking about let me give you an example in the Bible of Mark chapter 9 verse 23 and 24 jesus said unto him now this man had a boy that had epilepsy and he fell into the fire and all these things and jesus said unto him if thou can believe o things are possible to him that believes and straightway the father of the child he cried out and said with tears lord I believe but help thou my unbelief [Applause] amen but jesus said i say unto you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them now friends that's just as much the Word of God as let there be light that's true that's just we have no doubt nobody ever questions let there be light you know why we see it every day but when he said this right here whatever you desire your if you pray and don't doubt you can have what you ask for that's just as much the Word of God and every word of God is only as true as every one of God if let there be light is true then this is true if there's a true let there be lighting through because what thank God don't do God don't lie you see faith cometh by hearing now hearing is not faith hearing is not faith many people here and never have faith hearing is not faith but hearing comes or faith comes by hearing fake comes by hearing here is not faith but faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God when you trust in what the word is saying to you see the word has got to be come to you personal it's got to be a personal revelation because what is faith faith is a revelation it's something that's revealed to you that's not yet but you believe it will be faith don't look at what it sees with its eye faith looks to the unseen faith is a revelation of the will of God faith is such a deep subject it's so mystical to us and yet it's so simple and I wonder sometimes if it's not so simple that we stagger over it [Applause] but as I said I see people come through the line and they say oh I have faith to be healed and bereave said friends when they passed by I know they haven't got enough faith for it to cure a toothache and some of them coming through with cancer and say I have faith to be healed and they do not have faith even though they say it they do not have faith they have hope hope is faith enemy but faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen it's a substance it's something that's direct it's something that you really have not something that you imagine not something that you think you have it's a direct positive act that you have people many people have hope instead of faith and yet faith is so simple the only thing you have to know is that Jesus died to save sinners and his blood washes us why the snow that's all you need to know God how simple can that be I was a sinner he died for me he washed me with his blood now I'm a son of God and every diptych blessing belongs to me it's just that simple it's not something tango it's not if I hold my hands right if I can pray on enough if I could pray loud enough we do that but that's not what Desi Ghee it's that simple child like faith then he said it I believe it that settles it you see when Jessica was blind the doctors gave us no encouragement none mr. Ward if you'll do this and mr. Warner I think we can do this and she'll be all right they never said that they never gave us a choice of surgery they never gave us a choice of therapy they never gave us a choice all they said was we're sorry so Shirley and I went to the Bible because if they didn't have the answer Jesus did [Applause] but do you believe in doctors yes I used to work with doctors I have nothing against them but when they can't help us Jesus can someone told me the logo I don't believe Jesus Hills no more I said you come too late to tell me I see it every day of my life I see a name and not only do I see it she sees it hallelujah we went to the Bible we started quoting Isaiah 53 we started telling Jessica you'll see me again you'll see me again let's say do you see me no daddy I don't see you know what that was barriers yes God heals blinded eyes did I know that I preached it for years I preached for years God opens blinded us but what about hers is that Alright this morning what about hers because you see brother Charlie the devil come to tell me yeah God opens blinded eyes but really her eyes will not blind God who was blinded eyes but really there's nothing wrong with her eye there's nothing wrong with her nerve you see her problem wasn't really her eye her problem wasn't really her nerve her problem was her brain the brain was so damaged it could not process the information so he said you have God opens blinded eyes this is what I bought this was the barriers these were the hindrances that Satan tried to use yes God heals yes God opens blinded eyes but her eyes are really not blind so that really don't apply to her what was it barriers hindrances but we had to break through those barriers what was the Satan's barriers but she believed me she was just a little girl but she believed me and let me be honest with you this morning when she started believing me it wasn't her it wasn't me helping her it was her helping me because for the last her faith in believing in igniting my faith do you understand what I'm saying when she started agreeing with the word it helped me to agree with the word food one can put a thousand the flight do can put ten thousand amen amen [Applause] she started believing me I'll see you again because daddy said I'd see again that simple child like faith you see she didn't understand the barriers she didn't understand the x-rays in the MRIs she just a little girl she didn't understand that so I'll see new to believe was what daddy said and I think a lot of times how much better off we would believe if all we understood was what daddy said you're sick you see the working of the Holy Spirit stick oh if I can just get brother Jones to pray for me and have more faith people come up for prayer all the time I pray for hundreds of thousands of people a year we pray for people coming in prayer lines people coming up for prayer and lots of civility I'll pray that I'll have more faith and you try to get them to understand you've already got it you've already got it it's just that simple ice up we'd the same fate that brought you to the meeting this morning or planting any promise of God will bring it to pass in your life did anybody get up this morning to go through their house and look at the vase on the wall and look at the coffeepot and say you know this may be the last time I ever see this I want to get a good look at my house cuz I don't know if I'll be back a lot we don't do that when we go to the store we don't hugger laugh like it's the last time that we'll ever see her again we just kiss or say honey I'll be back in a minute I'm gonna go get some taters or something like that that's what we do you know why it's an unconscious faith we've done it so many times we don't even think about it I'm going to the store and I'm coming back and that's the way it ought to be with the Word of God God said it God's brooding it should not even be a second doubt it should not even be a second thought God said it and that's gonna happen because God said it would happen [Applause] amen it's just a simple childlike faith to apply the blood to believe it with all your heart and it'll happen you know you know he ever said you know what Jesus all Jesus ever said was do you believe only believe not only believe plus a goose but not only believe plus a vision come on somebody none of you believe by seeing a pillar of fire hanging over the platform no he never said that the goose-bumpy field may not be from God it may be from the air-conditioner so we don't base it on goosebumps we don't base it on sensations we base it on the Word of God [Applause] it's just simple you know sometimes I think we get too smart sometimes I think we get too educated but they asked an old country boy just a little country farmer just an old fella said sir I want to ask you a question why do you believe why are you a believer you know what he said because I believe is that when we understand that sir we know that you believe what I'm trying to find out sir is why do you believe he said because I'm a believer yes sir yes sir listen to me mr. Jones listen I know you're a believer but what I want to try to find out is why are you a believer oh that's easy because I believe you see if we wasn't believers they would probably call us something else hallelujah you see I'm not saved this morning because I got down to an altar and cried I've made a few years ago up the camp up in Ohio at the youth camp my brother had a testimony service around the bonfire that night and the kids were testifying and some of them said I was sitting listening to him some of them said oh ha say when when that certain brother out there I preached that message home I spoke to my heart and I begin to shout and I know I got it nothing it's wrong answer they're basing their religious experience because they shouted the others gonna appreciate I tell you I got down at that altar and that word was so real and I thought God I know you're talking to me god I know this words for me and I just received it and I got so happy I got the shouting of it being that's the answer believers don't follow signs and wonders but signs and wonders do follow believers so we're not saved because I got down an altar in Christ I'm not saying because something touched my heart and made me cry but I'm saying because I meant God's Word I met the requirements of God's Word you see Satan can whip us around our emotions sank your weapons around on how we feel because some day we fell out we can conquer the world the next day we don't want to get out of bed but saint can whip us around on our feelings that's why some people that when they're come to when they're old fire for God they never miss a service but the first time something goes wrong they can't hardly make it to church and when they do they set my brother duo rosie-wosie me you said brother now you don't understand I'm going through a hard time I'm not belittling what you're going through with friends we all go through hard times I've lost loved ones I've buried my mom I've buried my daddy I buried my brother I buried my father-in-law I buried my sister I've done those things I know it hurts but one thing I do know the pain is never greater than my god oh yeah no matter what I go through it's not greater than God's ability to change my lives hey man boy to God I feel like speaking Cherokee how you can interpret revelation amen it meant but I'm saved because God said so accept him on the basis of his word that's how I'm saved because I believe it and I confess what the word says and it brings the results of the word I'm saved because we're God's Word teaches that I'm saved because I met the requirements of God's Word that's how you're saved if you're saved this morning Satan can whip us on our ideals Satan can whip us on things but he can't go around the Word of God jesus said it's written and that settles it with all of it it is written in the word then I'm saved not because I feel like it but because I met God's requirements and that same principle applies to healing I'm not healed because I feel like I'm not healed because I got a goose bump I'm not here because somebody screamed when somebody pray with somebody pray for me somebody screamed and that's the evidence I know sir that's not what it is it's the same principle we accept God on the basis of his word he is my healer here's my deliverer and Christ alone I stand amen then I'm healed because God teaches me that I'm healed you see in order to have faith faith let's have a basis you can't just let faith be loosen around faith has to rest itself upon something not the shifting sands of man's reason it's not up one day and down the next faith can never anchor there but faith is based on the solid rock of God's Word faith rest right Oh God's words God said it that settles it it don't shift things don't shift from that men sometimes they can paint a picture so real doctors can paint the picture so real MRIs CT scans can make the picture look so real you'll get a lump in your throat trust me I know I can make it look so real but faith will never look at that if it's contrary to God's Word if it's contrary to God's Word thank don't see them they don't see you know the doctors they thought I'd lost my mind and I did I had the mind of Christ and so sort of watch Jessica when I and I went down to this panel of doctors and they were sitting there in a table across from me I was on this side the rest of them was on that side all their pens in their pocket and their stethoscopes around their neck and their white coats and I said mr. Ward were a little concerned about you said we don't think that you're we don't think that you're that you're that you're grasping the situation we don't think you fully understand the Cygnus that the the extent of your daughter's injuries we don't think you you know we don't think that you realize the seriousness of what you're facing and we're just a little bit concerned I said what are you expecting mixed outcome of your daughter's case what do you expect I said sir I don't care my daughter's present in the United States I'm not interested in it she flies the jet plane she flies the jet plane but I'm not interested in that that's not what I'm looking for that's not I said what do you want I said just for her to be normal just to be made the way God made a man faithful look at those things they said I just want to ask you sir when she's because she's just a little girl you know she had just not long before had been potty-trained she's almost three year old and you know and I said sir I just want to ask you do you think when she comes out of a coma do you think she'd still be potty trained or will we have to read potty trainer and I'll never forget he looked at me like I was an idiot I just heard crickets you know I said mr. Ward that's the least of your problems that's what I was just wondering but when she came out of the coma guess what we never had the potty trainer again and I believe God honored my faith [Applause] faith will track will track right straight back to God's Word that's where faith and acres of what God said he said it I'm the Lord that healeth thee we believe that from God because God said it and we believe it and it brings the results then if these principles of God's Word is true why can't we be healed God wants us to have it God's done gave it to us I don't think he's an Indian giver I don't think God gives it to us and it takes it back away from us so if God gave it to us I'm not too smart but if God gave it to us he must have wanted us to have it or brother Charlie he wouldn't gave it to us huh he wants us to have it the Prophet said that God wants to heal you think of this quote right here God wants to heal you a thousand times more then you want to be healed then why is there such a struggle it's because of Satan's barriers it's Satan's barriers of doubt that little spirit that hangs right above you but I said it's just that one thing above you that little thin shadow of doubt I said if you can ever break through that said they tell me a great airplane they tell me these jet planes that they struggling Windell and struggling wiggle till they get through the sound barrier but after they break that sound barrier they are free I would have lied and that YouTube pull it up sometime and look at it's amazing I looked at some pictures brother I know using the Air Force I looked at some pictures of planes breaking the sound barrier and they was coming through there it was almost like a hindrance and all of a sudden a big white cloud come around them and boom and when that thing exploded they were gone and that's the way it is with that damn barrier once we break through it goes 50 miles of elbow room it's unlimited it's unlimited to what we can do amen your speed is unlimited you will receive the manifestation of what God's already said because God's already said you're healed breaking Satan's barriers of doubt see Satan's desire is to build barriers of doubts around you because he doesn't want you to catch the revelation of the Word of God for your day you see there's two books that Satan hates we know this two books Satan hates more than any other books in the Bible that's Genesis and revelation because Genesis tells this beginning Revelation tells his end this ain't no like that so if you want to upset Satan if you really want to obsess upset Satan don't say what he wants you to say say what revelation says if Satan hates the book of Revelation because it tells him where he's going and I think we ought to tell him every day where he's going [Applause] Satan hates the book of Revelation he knows that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Satan knows uh certainly that the original trenchant in accost with the power of God March 16 in action is the only true church that Jesus claims as his own all else is false for Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of revelations exposes him exposed to Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of God's people the discrediting of God's Word because he knows if you get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for you will be an invincible army and Satan will be powerless before you so then what is Satan's desire Satan wants to hinder you from realizing who you are safety wants to beat you down that you can't even say Amen when the word priest [Music] Satan's number one job his desire is to keep you from recognizing the promise of the word for you to keep you away from revelation because he knows as you get that revelation he's whooped it would be so good if we knew what the devil knows because he knows that but he tries to lie to you to keep you from knowing that because he knows if you see the word if he knows you see the word that's promised to you if he knows that you see in James which says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth he knows if you catch that revelation that that's you then he knows when you pray something's got to happen because the God's Word don't lie the reason sometimes have a struggle with that scripture out there is because the devil tells us that's brother Donnie well that's brother Branham well that's brother horn it's everybody in the church with you but why don't you realize he's telling the person beside you the same thing what is it his lectures what is it barriers the devil trying to get you from realizing who you are in the world and if we never know who we are we'll never have the right kind of faith how does he do it by barriers barriers amen you know what a barrier is it's a fence an obstacle that prevents movement or access it's rylynn it's a barricade it's a hurdle it's a bar it's a block it's a roadblock the barrier is something that's placed across an entrance okay a circumstance or an obstacle that keeps people or things apart prevents communication or progress barrier Beier is an obstacle an obstruction a hurdle a stumbling block a bar a block an impingement a hindrance a curve don't you see what Satan uses everything because when Satan sees a real move of God gets started in the church when Satan sees a real move of God get started in your life he'll do he'll put everything everything he can do to cause the hindrance to put a hindrance in your way they're trying to keep you from the promise that's revealed that the healing the revelation the healing the peace to keep you from obtaining these things he will throw everything in your path to hinder you from receiving the blessings of God in your life the redemptive blessings that belong to us you see it's not something that we're going to get someday I don't need it someday I need it today the people down in Florida they don't need a god of tomorrow they need a God of right now like a little boy in the storm when he was scared said the father said son Junior do the Donald take care as he said my momma I want a God with skin only amen Satan will clutter your path to victory with feelings emotions symptoms lies confusion education all hindrances even the kitchen sink he'll even throw that out there if he thinks it'll work he throws it all at you Satan throws everything in your way that he can what is it barriers barriers of doubt see we don't have to have a great education to know God matter of fact God's not known by education heads and I've got nothing against education we should go to school you have to work you have to know these things you have to give seizures what seizures but we'll never know God through some kind of MC equals three rule of some kind of slide rule you'll never know God man education God is known by faith when Jessica first got her go to God I tried to go to God and plead to God I tried to make a plea to God I tried to get him to feel sorry for me I'll be honest with you said Lord it's my only little daughter garden that's the only dollar that I have and she didn't she had nothing to do with it she was riding with her grandpa she wasn't driving the car and then I realized that don't move God God does not move because he feels sorry for us but God we moved by faith amen hallelujah do you love you miss water that's not known but knowledge amen but you see here's the thing if a person wants to find God there's nothing going to stop them but here's the good thing about that Satan knows I want you to understand this morning October Michael last night I would preach a message one day on what Satan knows but Satan knows that he can't really stop you he knows that oh god oh yeah this morning well brother I thought the devil all wake up but he's a bluff he can't not stop you but when he tries to convince you is that he can but he can't he knows he can't oh god help us this martyr to know and we struggle I know you struggle because I struggle we're humans sometimes we struggle and we're ass when we struggle why it's because of Satan's hindrances it's his barriers God's pulling you God's pulling to you God's showing you things if God can just get you past that barrier that barrier of unbelief then revival will break out through United States and everywhere he said if you can go beyond the sound barrier that sin barrier of them belief breaking the barriers of doubt when Satan says yeah God heals but he won't heal you yeah God loves or he don't love you if God loves you you wouldn't be going through this hard time in your life God don't really love you or he wouldn't it took that boy from you God don't love you he wouldn't took your wife for me come on somebody what is it hindrances its barriers the Satan puts to try to keep us beat down but if we can push beyond that if we can push beyond there is the word talking to me yes has God my healer yes it's not my deliverer yes if we can look to that friends if we can keep our eyes on that and push back the barriers and struggle to break through those things those voices that speaks to you that voice that says you'll never get well that voice that tells you that cancer is gonna take your life that voice that tells you your child's gonna die that voice that tells you your marriage is gonna bring you that voice that tells you you don't have the Holy Ghost and you're not going to if you can break that barrier it's unlimited a man breaking the barriers of doubt is it true does it mean me can I be healed could I be safe could God fill me with the Holy Spirit that Satan bears just to get you to doubt that but break that barrier just keep struggling like that airplane just keep struggling and struggling and struggling just keep pushing that away breaking that barrier away or I don't believe that I'm not looking to that I'm not seeing that I'm not accepting that come on somebody it when Satan brings the barriers we need to push them back that's not what the word says that's not what the word chance the word doesn't say you might receive the Holy Ghost the word says you shall receive the Holy Ghost and we need to break those things off of our life break those things away from us well I've had scoliosis all my life but it can stop today well I've had this on my life but it can stop today oh my forehead time I'd share that with you but we'll just catch you some other time amen when you break through that barrier behind a deer there's 50 miles available River just died out to everything just died out to the voices I'm not going to hear that barrier I'm not gonna believe that barrier I'm not going to push that out of my mind I'm not going to look at that I'm not gonna listen to reason and we look at the promise I want to quote his word I'm gonna rest on the promise I'm gonna like I told Christine over a mound in Rome in Romania that had the hill problem and I told her I said she said brother down I want God to heal my hips she said I want to be I want to have children I want who would marry me like this I said listen to me says if I was you I quit asking God for my healing and I start accepting I said you take this prayer cloth you put it under your pillow and when God heals your help you send it back to me I said you get up in the morning you say thank God for healing me when you go to bed and not you say thank God for healing me when you go to search service you say thank God for healing me and I said it when God heals you you send that handkerchief back to me as a testimony of what God did for you years went by and I got a brother here in the church came up been in the chat room said somebody's willing to find you and so I got an email from this grocery several down my name is Christina I'm the girl with the hill I've been trying to find you several down I did what you told me to do I went everywhere testified said my even my friends said oh no here she goes again said but I kept on testifying my mom and daddy said you need to stop because you know you're not any better and you're bringing the reproach me she said I didn't listen to him brother down I kept testified and she said I was in church I said I stood up with that crutch and I said I want to thank God for healing me he said brother Darrell I felt a pop I felt a pop in my hip and when I did I threw down the foot then I walked out of church why break up the barriers of doubt break through the barriers you'll never be no better you've had this for years you've had this for years but congressman Upshaw have at 66 years 66 years in a wheelchair but God's it's tangible hey hey we've got to come past the birds until you break the barrier you'll never do no good it's not God was well God did those things in 65 when brother Brennan was here if God never done it once God still does it well God was God then but he isn't down it's a sin that's a singer that's a doubt bear come on that Satan's burger it's just a lie he's still gone if he ever was God he's still God is even the same God today then he never was God he said I am God and I changed not it's not God's lost his power God has not lost his power he's the same God he always was God's not lost his power man has lost his faith it's not god it's man it's man just went back on the promise to believe a man ohh I managed to get a few weeks off the rest I feel good a man breaking barriers you know there was a time that they said that man could not run a four-minute mile they said if man would run a four-minute mile II was bust his heart his lungs would break his muscles would ripped from his legs medical science experts missed thousands of years they said man's tried to break the four-minute mile experts said it couldn't be done they even put Bulls behind people and had the Bulls to chasing them to see if they could run faster [Applause] you can't make that up I pity potato right now they put a ball behind me I might break the four-minute mile they said the body shot said the human body was incapable of breaking the four-minute mile not only was it dangerous it was impossible you know I think God loves that word impossible it's a barrier that cannot be broken thousands of years they said man has tried to break it in the 1940s the mile record was pushed to four minutes and one second where it stood for nine years they could not break that one because they had in their mind what's that said your lungs will explode your heart will burst you'll die well you might do it but you'll die you can't do it the body can't take it if they would run and sometimes they was one second off but perhaps brother weighs just perhaps as they was about to break that record the thoughts begin to come into the mind you're gonna blow your heart out you're gonna blow your legs out still never run again and perhaps they hesitated just enough to miss the mark by one second nine years but on May the 6th 1954 there was a man by the name of Roger Bannister broke the four-minute barrier he ran the mile in three minutes 59.4 think of it and they said Roger how did you do that he said help him my mind a vision I saw myself breaking the record I saw myself going across that mark I saw the clock I saw that it said it was under four minutes I kept that before me we're not trained when I ran I didn't listen to what they said I didn't listen to the reports I didn't listen to the experts I kept a vision before me that I would break that barrier but I want you to notice not only did Roger have to break that barrier the four minutes he had to break the barrier sighs he had to break the barrier of myth he had to break the barrier of entrance he had to go against everything that everybody said he had to deny it he had to cast it down he had to refuse it he had to push beyond the barriers but when he did when he did when roger bannister broke the four-minute mile other saw that it could be done the four-minute mile barrier has since been broken by many male athletes and now today is the standard not the exception the standard of all male professional middle distance runners in the last 50 years the Mao record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds because one man broke the barrier you said brother I want you to say that's simply this that I don't need everybody in this building to break the barrier this morning I'll just be one person one person that can push through one person that can break through and once one person breaks through what's one person they say oh my brother Charlie got it I can get it his brother Terry got it I can get it one person breaking through it remember left over in Switzerland when the man said this day I'll give my life for Switzerland and he said follow me get what you can get follow me and he ran right into the ranks of that army that had moved upon their country and he broke the ranks at once he broke that right he gave his life but when he broke the rank they ran through it and whoop that army hey man I just need one person to break that barrier and we'll whoop the devil's army amen it's like a plane that struggles and struggles to break the sound barrier it just keeps pushing just keep believing break through the barriers unbelief break through that thought that tells you it's not for you you'll never be will you've had this problem with lust for years you've got this beset easy and you've got this trouble of pornography you've tried to overcome it it's alive the devil I tell you if one man overcoming if one woman overcoming you can overcome it come on somebody if God healed one of cancer God can heal you of cancer if I can save one marriage God can save your marriage they may have what to really don't appreciate figura go on positive affirmations he loves me he wants to heal me he wants to save me he wants to revive me he wants me to break through and once you break through others can follow pray until you pass the doubt barrier then you're running free then you're running free you're past the unbelief it's done been settled it's all over when you get the assurance in your heart it's going to be that way you're just as happy as if it's already happening Hey like gyrus his daughter when his daughter was dying he went to find Jesus he fell down in worship team he said sir my daughter's died would you please come would you come to my house you know what Jesus said I'll go see how simple it is and as they started can you imagine how he felt he just seen the woman with the bloody shoe healed can you imagine how he felt me and Jesus would be FFC she's coming the back of us let me taste it I guarantee you Jesus come to your house you wouldn't say it like you're sitting here this morning huh come on for you I don't even agree with Donald Trump I'm not a Republican or Democrat don't get mad I just don't I'm a Christian but if Donald took them to my house I would be excited if the mayor of John City come to my house I'd be pretty excited just out of respect but here Jesus was coming to his household can you imagine how excited he must have been because don't you see the Jesus agreeing to go was just the same as his daughters and son being healed it's gonna be any children oh my I'm telling you you know he he was stirred Jesus is coming to my house he might have moonwalked a little bit I don't know he was excited and no sooner did he started getting excited here comes the barriers here comes the mourners here comes the people that with the church with well I don't know they said trouble not to master anymore your little girl is dead and all that joy all that excitement that one hindrance yes deflated him you know my mama god rest her so she told me for years when I was little boy she said you know Burt she said you know Darrell as long as there's breath there's hope and that's a good sailor but one day I said you know mama that's true I said I taste something better than that even when there's no breath or still hope how do ya and all Jesus did was touching on the shoulder and you know what he said only believe you know why I said that because that's what breaks the barrier you see Satan wants us to compromise yes he does when Jessica was in that condition in the hospital somebody I worked with I appreciate incoming I really do they came down there just to visit I I was out I went and done something and sure was there and this person I worked with come and they they had a boy that had that had spinal meningitis as a challenge a real high fever and it left the boy deaf and she come tutto Cheryl she said you know said I forget the boy's name but she said you know they told us he was going to be deaf but we were willing to accept it just to have her little boy and so say when she said that to her something inside of her raised up and said but we won't accept that [Applause] see Satan wants you to accept something less something less than what God has for you but let me tell you for this if Sam Walton was my daddy I wouldn't go to Walmart with a basket I've done a Walmart with the truck God says asked me for big things don't you see when you ask God for big things you are telling God I think you're a big God when you ask God for the impossible you're telling God I believe God you can do the impossible amen amen God's Word says so that settles it he's my healer he's my joy he's my deliverer you see the devil knows if you can just use a little faith he's defeated Amen you said brother I don't know if I can believe or not well can't you halfway believe you see if you can just halfway believe the devil still defeated amen oh I got a hurry look at that woman with the bloody shoe she had plenty of hindrances she had plenty of barriers she had been sick 12 years the doctor said they couldn't help her the doctor said you'll never be well when she got down out of where Jesus was not only did she have what the doctor said not only did you have what everybody else was saying not only did she have the evidence of 12 years of a blood issue that wouldn't stop all those barriers then when she got down there guess what she found a crowd she could even get to Jesus and everybody was touching him everybody was touching Jesus what was it barrier a barrier what is it Satan trying to stop us from receiving what's ours she had physical barriers spiritual barriers everything trying to turn her back all the noise all the confusion the devil telling her he'll never buddies touching him you'll never feel your touch a man but if you can be persistent Amen if you can be persistent and not not everything hinder you you see physically you might feel bad physically you might not feel well at all you might not feel like coming to church you may not feel like doing anything sometimes we can be so sick we just don't feel like doing anything but if we can break those physical hindrances you see every person that comes to Christ will find hindrances tribe studying to bring a message to help God's people ask tests brother David asked brother Horn ask brother Amos that's some of these brothers that's brother west how much Satan tries to hinder you amen you see every time you start for a closer walk with God you know what you'll find hindrances the devil is at your door to try to stop you in every way he can but you see this woman she thought if I could but touch his garbage you see she thought it first and then she manifested what she thought she went through with that thought because military she thought if I could but touch His garment I will be made whole but not only did she think it brother Jerry she pushed me on every reason well there's everybody touch me he'll never feel your touch but she pushed me on that she broke that barrier ac touched him that way she touched him he stopped you know what he said who touched me you see that was her anticipation when she touched as she passed the sound barrier she broke that barrier of doubt she was free for in her heart she said if I could let touch him and then she done exactly what she thought and when she done exactly what she thought if I do this I'll be healed and when she done that she was healed well she broke the barriers you know it was a it was a man one time he had the palsy real bad and he had some friends and they heard that Jesus was in this house Jesus is in the house and they went and got this man who had the palsy to bring him to Jesus when they got to where Jesus was they couldn't even get in they were so meaning in the house the door was blocked so they had to go Guinea they had to carry they get to where Jesus is the place is packed out hindrance that can't go through the door because the doors blocked with people hindrances there's no witness in the house if there was a window data went through the window there's not even a window hindrance now they could have took him home so what we tried but there were so many people we couldn't get in but they didn't stop they never stopped pushing well it's crowded so can't get in the door so there's no windows so those are us how we gonna get him under us Pender's and when they got on the roof guess what they found a Ruth oh we go to get him further hindrance so do what they did they tore the earth off oh I'll tell you right now son I rip his roof off and fall in here this morning we have Church they tore the roof of the church all the dust all the pieces of town the people that I want again hindrances but they would not stop if they had to tear the roof off that there that I found if they had to kick up some dust they would kick up some dust and you know what they did they dropped him right at the feet of Jesus God Oh God give me friends like that [Applause] Thank You Optio right at Jesus feet can you imagine what happened at their house that night oh my god brother I'd love to be in there they had a justice did you see did you see that man's face when we talked of the Prophet did and here come the man that was had the policy here he come walking through not only was he healed but it sins were forgiven him Oh God you talk about a revival you talk about a revival let me close Chuck Yeager was the first man to ever break the sound barrier and I read just the other day I think it was he done it again almost on the exact same moment in time 50 years later I think it was 80 years left 50 I don't know when it was some so many years later Chuck Yeager 84 year old climbed back in the cockpit and broke the sound barrier again you know what that tells me if you've done it once [Applause] we could do it again Hey but you see he had to have something to break that barrier with and let me say this morning so do you the hindrances and the barriers of satan the voices are real friends it's his job that's his desire is to keep you from receiving what God died for you to have C signal care if you come to church as long as you come defeated a defeated soldiers one of the hardest soldiers you could ever get to fight that's why many times when soldiers get that battle fatigue they'll pull him off the field and send him over to Hawaii and let him rest up a little bit he will know he wants you to do is come to church fill up this place set defeated you see Chuck Yeager had to have something to break that bird he used an airplane and I say to you this morning as I'm closing our vehicle that God has given us it's not a motion it's not sensation it's not mind over matter it's faith faith breaks the barrier and once that barrier is broke it's unlimited it's unlimited to what God can do to a person who believed him [Music] who believe there's no limit send that plane it'll shake it'll rattle the Prophet said the boats about come out of the wings how many people was almost at that barrier and they pulled back because they sprayed the plane would break apart right there at that moment almost pushing through and then they let the devil tell him I wouldn't go up further thighs you you know you don't like to walk in front of people they're gonna look at your dress

Harry brothers come let me show this with you as we're closing trust of not being too long but I don't I want to share this with you I thought this was so good there's another definition for barrier all the ones we're a barricade a block a hindrance obstruction and pigment but there's another word for barrier and that's used in horse racing it's called the gate bear the gate barrier is where they put the horses before they start the race it's that gate that the horse stands behind and when they fire off that pistol and the gate flies open then he runs and I want you to understand this morning we're not hybrids we're a real race horses our genetics is from our daddy you know my brother d'Alene just done his DNA he said you know you get 50% from your mom and 50% from your daddy but I want you to know this morning we're all dead II and I want you to see that this barrier this gate barrier is just like the gait of a racehorse I want you to understand you know where they put the Scarecrow in the garden where the best fruit is why do they put it there to keep the coal out of the strawberries what is the Scarecrow telling you the Scarecrow is really telling you not to stay out it's really telling either something good in there don't you see when Satan tries to play some barrier don't you understand what Satan's trying to tell you he knows there's a finish line he knows there's a victory line he's trying to stop you but you know what the player should do the bear shouldn't be a hindrance the bear should tell me I'm fixing to run I'm fixin to go towards a victory lane a man do you love him this morning that little shadow of darkness that hangs over you that little down there if you could ever break through that little barrier and get free thank you lord thank you lord you remember the eagle brother man talked about that was in the cage up in Cincinnati he said I could talk if I had the money I would buy him and set him free and that eager would run his crash against that cage and he'd fall back you see he done that brother Larry because he wanted to go where God built him to go he wanted to fly into the heavens because he was built to fly into the heavens and what he needed brother Eddie what he needed was not a set of wings that would lift him out of the cage he had the wings to do it all he needed was to break the barrier and say all you need to do this morning is break the barrier it's like getting a bird out of the cage he's got the wings he just needs to get out the door everything you need this morning you've already got it well I will come up
