[Music] [Music] w [Music] you may be seated we welcome you today to this special occasion we're gathered here in the sight of God in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman and the holy state of matrimony which is committed in the scripture to be entered into in the fear of God reverently discreetly and prayerfully if there's any person who can he show a Just Cause while these two persons should not be lawfully joined together let them speak now or forever hold their peace who gives this woman to be married to this man and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds the man that she loves no matter what he looks like he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate and Glory those death or nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity and they stepped out into space of time and will return back to [Music] Eternity I require in charge you both as you will answer at the day of judgment and the secrets of All Hearts be disclosed if either of you know of any impediment why you may not be
