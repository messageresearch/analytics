[21:25] Eugene was born on September the 14th
[21:27] 1967 to parents Willie and Linda Kennedy
[21:31] in Sandusky Ohio
[21:33] he was a devout Christian loving husband
[21:36] and proud father
[21:38] despite the frustrations disappointments
[21:41] and the unentered questions from
[21:42] countless Physicians over the years
[21:44] Eugene maintained his faith his
[21:47] influence spread worldwide and was a
[21:49] pillar of inspiration at Happy Valley
[21:50] Church of Jesus Christ now Word of Life
[21:53] Church
[21:54] outside of Jesus Christ his family meant
[21:56] more to him than anything else in the
[21:58] world
[21:59] he was unendingly proud of his sons Ryan
[22:02] Jolie Kennedy Andrew Eugene Kennedy
[22:05] stepdaughter summer Nicole sink stepson
[22:09] Gerard Adam Talkington and late stepson

[22:49] grandsons Brooks Brooks Lucas and Owen
[22:53] granddaughters Jordan Amelia Leanna
[22:56] resaith
[23:00] foreign
[23:01] whatever happened to Mary
[23:06] his his sister Tammy and her husband
[23:09] Mike Sutherland Brother David Kennedy
[23:11] and his wife Rebecca and brother Jason
[23:13] Kennedy and his wife DIA

[23:20] Brooke
[23:21] sink Lucas Talkington owing Talkington
[23:24] Micah Brown Josiah Brown and Zion Brown
[23:29] and you know if if I was to look in the
[23:31] Bible to find a book and a chapter that
[23:33] would describe brother Eugene's life in
[23:36] his character it would have to be the
[23:38] book of Hebrews chapter 11 the faith
[23:41] chapter
[23:42] for you know in in this chapter we find
[23:44] men and women who met
[23:46] great challenges and endured great
[23:48] hardships
[23:49] and yet their faith in God never wavered
[23:53] and to me that describes brother UT
[23:56] hear them to God's word
[23:58] he believed God was his healer his
[24:00] strength was in the word of God
[24:02] and I remember many a time that I would
[24:04] fellowship with brother Donnie in the
[24:06] study and right before the service start
[24:08] I would slip out and come around the
[24:09] parking lot and
[24:11] brother Eugene would be sitting in a car
[24:12] because he was too sick to sit in church
[24:15] and I would always go up to the car and
[24:17] he'd row down the wind and we'd shake
[24:20] hands and pray together and sometimes
[24:22] just give a thumbs up but he was always
[24:24] positive he was always claiming his
[24:27] healing he was always believed in God
[24:33] Hebrews chapter 11 is a chapter of
[24:35] inspiration
[24:36] to me brother Eugene Kennedy his life
[24:39] was an inspiration to me
[24:42] and to all of us
[24:43] and I like to say today
[24:46] go rest high buddy
[24:48] your work is done
[24:50] you kept the faith
[24:52] let us pray
[24:59] father we are gathered here today
[25:02] to remember and to honor the life of our
[25:05] brother Eugene
[25:07] we are taught by your Prophet that
[25:09] eternal life is living your life for
[25:10] others
[25:12] and even in death our brother gave of
[25:14] himself that others might benefit
[25:17] and Lord no doubt many times
[25:20] he wondered how he could be doing any
[25:22] good laying in the bed weak
[25:25] and did his life
[25:27] was a life of inspiration and faith and
[25:29] it touched people the world over

[42:53] about me
[43:01] [Music]
[43:06] and
[43:08] please Master said
[43:15] [Music]
[43:17] bye
[43:21] eyes me
[43:49] I certainly wish to extend our
[43:51] condolences to
[43:54] family friends of our
[43:57] to party brother
[44:00] his life certainly
[44:02] touched us all in one way or another you
[44:04] are here today to
[44:06] signify that by your presence
[44:11] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7.
[44:14] the scripture says in the Lord God
[44:16] formed man
[44:18] of the Dust of the ground
[44:20] and breathed into his nostrils
[44:23] the Breath of Life
[44:25] and Man became
[44:27] a living soul
[44:31] so I'd like to ask you today
[44:34] what is man
[44:36] soul
[44:37] and soil
[44:40] soul and soil
[44:43] breasts
[44:44] and body
[44:47] puff of breath
[44:49] a pile of dust
[44:52] so if that's all that man is in this
[44:55] life
[44:56] than when man departs it certainly is a
[44:59] sad departure
[45:01] but yet we know that there is another
[45:04] part of that that is beyond what science
[45:07] chemistry
[45:09] what scientologists
[45:12] anthropologists different people would
[45:14] be able to see
[45:16] that is a life
[45:18] that God himself placed there
[45:21] and we know that life is a sacred thing
[45:25] to God
[45:26] so God puts every Mortal who comes to
[45:29] the Earth their name in a book
[45:33] thankfully we're the only ones that can
[45:35] contribute
[45:37] to what's in that book
[45:40] and thankfully no one else can do that
[45:42] for us
[45:43] most of us have enough to answer for and
[45:46] what we've done ourselves I'm sure glad
[45:49] you can add to my book and you better be
[45:51] glad I can't add to yours
[45:53] because we would all be in worse shape
[45:55] than what we are today I'm sure
[45:58] but yet the great thing about it is that
[46:01] God is the only one that can change the
[46:05] substance and the things that are
[46:07] written in that book
[46:09] when Eugene was born
[46:11] just a wee little fella nothing went on
[46:14] for a long time
[46:16] several years went by before bad things
[46:20] started being recorded in that book but
[46:23] as with all the rest of us that are here
[46:25] and every other Mortal that has lived or
[46:27] ever lived on the face of the Earth
[46:29] those bad things begin to accumulate
[46:32] might have started with a lie might have
[46:35] started with taking something that
[46:38] wasn't yours and yet it seems to go and
[46:41] go and grow and grow and the abundance
[46:44] of those things by the time some of us
[46:47] reached 15 16 18 20 30 it is accumulated
[46:52] to such a mass that is against us
[46:56] job says it this way in Job chapter 8
[46:59] verse 9 for we are but of yesterday and
[47:03] know nothing because our days upon Earth
[47:08] are a shadow now you can't see it
[47:11] because of where you are but as I put my
[47:13] hand up here it's between these lights
[47:17] and this Pulpit so it's a shadow I put
[47:21] my hand there it appears I take my hand
[47:23] away it disappears I put my hand back it
[47:27] appears I take my hand away it
[47:30] disappears that's your life that's my
[47:34] life now if we live to be 50 60 70 80
[47:37] years old still it is so short in
[47:42] comparison to Eternity again job says in
[47:45] Job 14 1 man that is born of woman is
[47:48] but few days and full of trouble he
[47:52] cometh Force like a flower and is cut
[47:55] down he fleece also as a shadow and
[48:01] continuous knot and thus thou open Thine
[48:04] Eyes speaking to God do you open your
[48:07] eyes upon such a one as that and bring
[48:11] me into judgment with thee can you
[48:14] imagine almighty God judging a flower
[48:18] God judging a shadow that was here for
[48:22] 50 60.
[48:28] what happens to that shadow what happens
[48:32] to what made the shadow now in order to
[48:35] have a shadow there has to be a contrast
[48:37] between light and darkness the elements
[48:40] the chemistry in my hand comes between
[48:41] the light and been able to reflect here
[48:44] so the light rays cannot penetrate
[48:46] through my hand I would hold up a piece
[48:48] of clear glass it would be totally
[48:49] different light would be able to come
[48:51] right through it and pass
[48:57] born in darkness come to the world in
[48:59] darkness I want you to notice again that
[49:02] psalmist David and Psalms 39 4 says Lord
[49:06] make me to know my end and the measure
[49:11] of my days
[49:13] now if you can imagine that when each of
[49:16] us come to the Earth here is a measuring
[49:18] tape of life
[49:21] now we were going to make this Pulpit or
[49:23] make this piece here we wanted to make
[49:25] it eight and a half inches wide by 14
[49:28] and a half inches long by three quarters
[49:31] of an inch deep how are we going to do
[49:32] that maybe there's some guys here today
[49:34] that are good enough you'd be able to
[49:36] look at it and you'd be able to take
[49:37] your pencil Mark a mark most of us will
[49:40] not be able to do that we would have to
[49:42] take a measuring tape hold it on this
[49:44] side come to this side and let's say 14
[49:47] and a half inches or whatever we want to
[49:48] make it would place a Mark we would go
[49:51] to the other side eight and three
[49:53] quarters of an inch would take stock
[49:54] material three quarters of an inch thick
[49:56] that have been planed on both sides and
[49:58] we'll be able to cut it according to the
[50:00] mark That's your life
[50:03] that's my life
[50:05] that was brother Eugene's life
[50:07] almighty God the day that he was born
[50:10] held the tape on the beginning
[50:12] almighty God knew where the tape would
[50:15] end on the other side I didn't he didn't
[50:18] he wanted to live no doubt to the
[50:22] Rapture I know he wanted to live to be
[50:24] able to move into our new church oh he
[50:26] every time I'd go see him I'm just
[50:28] believing brother Donnie I'm just
[50:30] believing I'm going to be able to go but
[50:32] apparently the measuring tape went from
[50:35] here to here and it didn't include that
[50:38] in his life
[50:39] each of us though we receive the Breath
[50:42] of Life from God we don't receive the
[50:45] exact allotment of time by which our
[50:49] space will cover
[50:51] you see I hold in my hand here today a
[50:53] check
[50:54] that may not look like your normal
[50:56] average check but it was a check written
[50:59] by Brother Eugene Kennedy
[51:03] let me read to you what it says
[51:06] September the 14th 2020.
[51:09] Bank of God
[51:11] in heaven and Eternity
[51:14] paid to the order of
[51:16] Eugene Kennedy
[51:19] for what healing and all that he has
[51:23] need of
[51:24] all on the bottom of the check here
[51:27] is signed Jesus Christ
[51:30] over on this side of the line is put the
[51:34] word
[51:35] let me tell you today
[51:37] he has been paid in full
[51:41] for this chat
[51:44] now did he know exactly when he would be
[51:46] paid in full no he believed was all of
[51:50] his heart that God was going to him all
[51:52] you say why he finally beat him oh I beg
[51:55] to differ with you you see he went to
[51:57] this clinic and that clinic this
[51:59] doctrine that thought well sir we're not
[52:01] sure it could be this try this and
[52:03] doctors as you know are truly practicing
[52:07] medicine and a lot of them practice on
[52:09] us so he tried this and try that and do
[52:13] this and do that did they ever find the
[52:16] answer no they never did but yet you
[52:19] know David says it this way in Psalms 39
[52:21] 5. behold thou Hast made my days as an
[52:27] Han bread
[52:30] right here
[52:32] now look how short that is now some of
[52:35] you've got a bigger hand than mine
[52:36] goodness look at brother John's hand
[52:38] hold your hand up our buddy wow what a
[52:41] hand
[52:43] but how short would that be compared to
[52:46] Eternity so your hand breath is like
[52:48] this so say a man that would be granted
[52:50] a three score and ten this first finger
[52:53] would be 20 years second another 20.
[52:55] third one another 20 and then the last
[52:57] one
[52:58] so here's the span of our life right
[53:02] here
[53:03] you know some people are known
[53:06] for what they do in life
[53:08] singers great Builders great contractors
[53:12] people that are politicians they are
[53:15] known and whenever they die people
[53:17] standing all he done this and she done
[53:21] that and he did this and that
[53:24] but brother Eugene wasn't known just for
[53:27] what he did
[53:29] he was known for what he could not do
[53:34] some people's faith is manifested by
[53:37] what they do in life
[53:39] brother Eugene's Faith was manifested
[53:41] more so
[53:43] and what God didn't allow him to do
[53:47] he could do many things talented very
[53:50] gifted
[53:51] but his faith his crowning of his life
[53:55] was not known so much in what he did
[53:58] but what God kept him from doing
[54:01] and he believed God
[54:03] with all of his heart
[54:06] you see for some of you you'll never go
[54:08] through that
[54:09] you'll look back in life and you'll say
[54:11] wow I accomplished this and this and I
[54:14] did that and I made a fortune and I'd
[54:17] done this and I'd done and I done and
[54:19] I've done
[54:20] how many times did I sat with our
[54:22] brother when I go to visit him
[54:25] one of the last times that I was there
[54:27] had been
[54:28] several months before he passed and he
[54:30] talked about just laying there in the
[54:31] bed can never do anything and he said
[54:34] I just wish I had a carburetor off of a
[54:37] car
[54:38] where I could just sit here and hold it
[54:40] on my chest and just take it apart and
[54:44] put it back together
[54:45] or a model car or something where I
[54:49] could just do something well I happened
[54:50] to mention that to somebody and somebody
[54:53] bought him one
[54:55] and I brought it to his door and
[54:58] delivered it now can you imagine wanting
[55:01] to put a model car together
[55:03] to take a carburetor and take the floats
[55:06] out of it and take the screws out of it
[55:08] and be able to put it back together
[55:11] so I wasn't known just for what he did
[55:15] but what he was kept from doing
[55:17] but still had the attitude the Lord
[55:20] gives and the Lord takes away
[55:24] blessed be the name
[55:27] of the Lord
[55:31] David went on to say in Psalm 78 39.
[55:35] for he remembered that they were but
[55:37] flesh talking about God remembering us
[55:41] a wind
[55:43] that passeth away and cometh not again
[55:48] David said my days are like a shadow
[55:51] that decline us
[55:53] I am wizard like the grass again it says
[55:57] man is like to vanity
[56:00] his days are as a shadow that pass away
[56:03] James picked up the same thought in the
[56:07] New Testament whereas you know not what
[56:09] shall be on the moral for what is your
[56:13] life
[56:14] it is even a vapor
[56:18] a vapor which is even more condescending
[56:22] than a cloud
[56:25] we know that clouds don't just pop just
[56:27] appear and most of the time they don't
[56:29] just disappear but they build and they
[56:33] build and they accumulate and accumulate
[56:37] but a vapor can come up
[56:39] in just a few moments and what does that
[56:43] Vapor do it disappears in exactly the
[56:47] same way if you live around this area or
[56:49] you're familiar with this area and it
[56:51] can be just as clear as it can be on
[56:54] Roan Street it can be clear in
[56:56] Elizabethton until you head to Gray and
[56:59] there's something about Gray Tennessee
[57:01] it's one of the foggiest places I've
[57:03] ever been in my entire life and I've
[57:06] been in England
[57:08] and what is it about gray there's some
[57:10] people here that live here I used to
[57:11] live there myself there's just something
[57:13] about it but you know what as many days
[57:16] as I've lived here many years I've lived
[57:19] here and drove through gray and you go
[57:21] through and it will be so clear but you
[57:23] get on the other side of gray and it
[57:26] dissipates and all the fog and all this
[57:30] that has been there and yet it fades
[57:32] away that's your life
[57:36] that's my life
[57:38] brother Eugene's told me many times
[57:40] brother Donnie I just wish I could do
[57:42] something
[57:44] I said brother Eugene
[57:47] you don't realize
[57:50] what a blessing your life is to people
[57:54] around the world
[57:57] now he had just sat there and look at me
[57:58] like I was from another planet
[58:02] and he said what have I ever done
[58:05] it wasn't what he'd done
[58:09] it was what he wasn't allowed to do
[58:13] but it's not been that long ago
[58:16] that that man got in his little what did
[58:19] you call that thing
[58:20] little scooter
[58:22] and he's scooted from Mimosa Lane right
[58:25] over here
[58:27] right here to be in church
[58:29] on Sunday morning and I'll tell you what
[58:31] he'll do
[58:32] he'll condemn many people at the day of
[58:36] judgment
[58:37] who were well who were healthy who had
[58:41] the opportunity to go to the house of
[58:43] God and they chose to go somewhere else
[58:46] he cried as brother Daryl said how many
[58:49] times would he set out in his vehicle in
[58:51] the dead of winter
[58:53] and have to start the vehicle to warm it
[58:56] up to keep him from getting so cold he
[58:59] would sit there in the heat of the
[59:01] summer and have to turn the air
[59:03] conditioner on
[59:05] but he wanted to go to church even
[59:07] though he couldn't even make it inside
[59:09] the church
[59:11] he told me many times I want to let the
[59:14] devil know whose side I'm on
[59:19] so
[59:21] what's the preacher going to say about
[59:23] you
[59:25] what's a preacher is going to say about
[59:27] me
[59:29] I'll tell you one thing I want to live
[59:31] my life so that they are so overwhelmed
[59:33] of good things to say they don't know
[59:35] where to start and don't know where to
[59:37] end
[59:38] I hope you don't choose to let your life
[59:43] be wasted
[59:45] and when a preacher has to stand up that
[59:48] he stutters and stammers and says well
[59:53] well
[59:55] well that's a deep subject say something
[59:59] wouldn't it be awful to live your life
[1:00:03] and you lived it so selfishly
[1:00:07] you lived it so inconsiderately of God
[1:00:11] and of others
[1:00:13] that hardly nothing can be said about
[1:00:15] you
[1:00:16] you see the life that brother Eugene
[1:00:18] lived
[1:00:19] it's still living today
[1:00:22] as I looked at some pictures in the
[1:00:24] videos a while ago
[1:00:25] and the thought just struck me
[1:00:28] I wonder what the current photos look
[1:00:32] like
[1:00:33] of him
[1:00:35] in the sixth dimension
[1:00:39] if we can only imagine it
[1:00:42] brother Andrew Glover and myself was
[1:00:44] there was brother Andrew brother Eugene
[1:00:46] rather just a few hours before he died
[1:00:49] when I walked in he wasn't breathing
[1:00:53] he couldn't talk he was so far gone
[1:00:56] could speak we was there with his family
[1:00:58] and we talked and they told us of
[1:01:01] different things different experiences
[1:01:02] that had
[1:01:04] but we couldn't fellowship with him
[1:01:07] on my way back home
[1:01:09] they called me and told me brother Ryan
[1:01:11] did he was gone
[1:01:14] as I prayed with him before we left I
[1:01:16] told him buddy
[1:01:18] as your pastor I've tried to lead you
[1:01:20] tried to guide you tried to help you
[1:01:24] but you're fixing to make a journey
[1:01:26] I can't make with you
[1:01:28] each of us are going to make that
[1:01:30] Journey one day much as you love your
[1:01:32] wife she can't go much as you love your
[1:01:35] children your grandparents your pastor
[1:01:37] whoever it is there's only one that can
[1:01:40] make that Journey with you and you sure
[1:01:42] want to make sure you're in good
[1:01:43] speaking terms with him
[1:01:46] you'll imagine this is respiration begin
[1:01:48] to drop and his blood pressure begin to
[1:01:50] get low
[1:01:53] he done made the decision don't recess
[1:01:55] the technique because there ain't
[1:01:56] nothing there
[1:01:58] as you begin to get where he couldn't
[1:02:00] breathe and he couldn't see and he
[1:02:02] couldn't hear
[1:02:04] and this voices begin to get weaker and
[1:02:07] weaker
[1:02:09] he began to feel himself pulling out of
[1:02:11] this old Tabernacle which had been a
[1:02:13] prison house
[1:02:15] for all of these years
[1:02:17] can you imagine in your mind as he
[1:02:19] stepped out of that into a brand new
[1:02:22] body
[1:02:26] I can just see him as he steps out of
[1:02:28] The Old Ship of Zion
[1:02:30] and the Lord God sent someone down
[1:02:33] by the river maybe his mother
[1:02:35] maybe the prophet of God we don't know
[1:02:37] who it was
[1:02:39] do you imagine he stepped out of that
[1:02:41] ship upon to this
[1:02:43] to the great Beach he ran his hand
[1:02:46] through the Bluegrass and the gentle
[1:02:49] breeze was blowing and he looked around
[1:02:51] and he saw greens like he'd never seen
[1:02:54] green before he saw yellows he saw Blues
[1:02:57] he saw Reds violets crimsons
[1:03:01] and he began to see people
[1:03:04] that he had recognized
[1:03:06] people that he had fellowshipped with
[1:03:08] around the word
[1:03:10] and looking at himself
[1:03:12] have changed
[1:03:15] the last time I was there with him
[1:03:18] and I stood by his bed
[1:03:21] I put my hand over on his knee
[1:03:24] to pray for him and his knee was smaller
[1:03:27] than my elbow
[1:03:30] he was so frail and so puny
[1:03:34] but can you imagine as he looked down
[1:03:36] but he saw himself and he could say
[1:03:39] praise God
[1:03:41] I'm a new man
[1:03:47] the bank of Heaven
[1:03:51] stood by this check
[1:03:56] Hallelujah
[1:04:01] you friends you loved ones
[1:04:05] question will be
[1:04:07] do you want to see him again
[1:04:10] you want to sit here today and cry
[1:04:12] because of your memories that he's gone
[1:04:14] I I've never understood humans
[1:04:17] that they will go to a funeral and they
[1:04:20] will cry and they will DeMent and they
[1:04:22] they express such sadness
[1:04:25] because that loved one is gone
[1:04:27] and they make absolutely no preparation
[1:04:30] whatsoever
[1:04:32] to ever see that loved one again
[1:04:35] and I'm scratching my head and thinking
[1:04:38] but did you love them or was that just
[1:04:40] an act that you went through if you
[1:04:43] really love them
[1:04:44] don't you want to spend eternity with
[1:04:46] them
[1:04:49] I don't mind telling you I cannot wait I
[1:04:53] wanted was all of my heart
[1:04:55] for brother Eugene to be able to walk
[1:04:57] down in our church be able to praise God
[1:05:02] but the way I figure it and the way I
[1:05:04] look at it he's already entered into a
[1:05:07] place that's Way Beyond any church
[1:05:10] building in this life
[1:05:12] they have been worshiping they have been
[1:05:14] singing there has been no Darkness there
[1:05:17] has been no night there has been joy
[1:05:20] unspeakable and full of Glory it's
[1:05:22] beyond Sublime it's beyond perfect it's
[1:05:25] beyond anything he could ever imagine if
[1:05:28] we could tap into him for a few moments
[1:05:31] and ask him brother Eugene what is it
[1:05:35] what what would you say brother Eugene
[1:05:37] if you could walk up here and have this
[1:05:40] microphone what would you tell your
[1:05:42] family
[1:05:43] I tell them don't miss it
[1:05:47] it's greater than anything you can ever
[1:05:49] imagine
[1:05:52] brother Eugene would you come back are
[1:05:55] you kidding me me go back into that
[1:05:58] frail body that had been a prison for
[1:06:00] years
[1:06:01] never
[1:06:02] but keep pressing the battle
[1:06:06] let me close with this
[1:06:09] truly our life being a vapor
[1:06:12] our life being a shadow
[1:06:14] our life being so short
[1:06:17] there's three things
[1:06:19] we will do with our life
[1:06:21] we will spend our life
[1:06:24] we will waste our life
[1:06:27] or we will invest
[1:06:30] our life
[1:06:33] now many of us like Investments
[1:06:36] but many of us want to invest
[1:06:38] but we'd like to keep it too you've
[1:06:41] heard the old saying you want your cake
[1:06:43] and eat it too if there wasn't a risk to
[1:06:47] investment everybody would invest
[1:06:50] but anybody that knows anything about
[1:06:52] Investments knows there is a risk if
[1:06:56] you're dealing with a broker that tells
[1:06:58] you there is no risk at all in this run
[1:07:02] run
[1:07:04] well I'm going to take it today I am a
[1:07:07] broker
[1:07:09] for the eternal life
[1:07:11] Assurance company
[1:07:15] I've been a broker now for many many
[1:07:18] years I'm 66 years old
[1:07:21] I've been a broker since I was 18 when I
[1:07:24] first started preaching
[1:07:26] I've been a broker all over the
[1:07:28] continents of the earth I've seen the
[1:07:31] Lord God bring thousands of people to
[1:07:34] him
[1:07:35] and I'm telling you today this is the
[1:07:38] only company
[1:07:40] that I can fully say
[1:07:42] you will not lose your investment
[1:07:47] but I am going to tell you it will cost
[1:07:50] you something yes
[1:07:52] you'll not be able to invest your life
[1:07:55] and be able to do with your life what
[1:07:58] you wish
[1:08:01] there's something about the owner of
[1:08:03] this company
[1:08:04] he wants all of you
[1:08:06] oh I know I know we want to give him
[1:08:08] what little bit we choose well I don't
[1:08:10] like this about me God you can have that
[1:08:12] and I don't like this you can have that
[1:08:14] but please don't tell me how to live
[1:08:17] God now look now look just stay off of
[1:08:20] that I don't want to go to hell I don't
[1:08:22] want to be lost but God forget this
[1:08:24] stuff of telling me what to do where I
[1:08:26] can't go I can't listen this music no no
[1:08:28] no no no God ah poor baby
[1:08:35] you want your cake don't you hide me
[1:08:39] but you see the Lord God says
[1:08:42] If any man will follow me
[1:08:45] he must take up his cross
[1:08:47] and deny himself daily
[1:08:51] actually the Lord Jesus talked about
[1:08:53] your cross
[1:08:55] more than he talked about his own
[1:08:57] so apparently
[1:08:59] it's pretty important
[1:09:02] so I ask you Fred
[1:09:04] we've come to celebrate this life
[1:09:07] that has been a blessing to many people
[1:09:10] around the world
[1:09:13] as a matter of fact there will be people
[1:09:14] that will long to meet by the Eugene
[1:09:17] Kennedy
[1:09:18] that never even knew him
[1:09:21] brother Daryl has traveled many
[1:09:22] countries of the world I myself have
[1:09:24] been through some of you have been able
[1:09:25] to go to different countries of the
[1:09:27] world and people you shook their hand
[1:09:29] other Eugene never got to do that
[1:09:32] but people all over the world that I'm
[1:09:35] in contact with how's brother you change
[1:09:37] it up how's brother Eugene to send
[1:09:38] condolence to his family this man never
[1:09:41] got to go to Uganda
[1:09:42] had never got to go to Tanzania he never
[1:09:45] got to go to me in those places how was
[1:09:47] he known
[1:09:49] because he was robbed
[1:09:51] he was robbed
[1:09:54] it would seem as if though he was robbed
[1:09:56] of so many things
[1:09:58] but in his robbery
[1:10:01] he was faithful
[1:10:03] to God
[1:10:05] you see God allows some people never to
[1:10:08] walk
[1:10:09] they're confined to a wheelchair
[1:10:11] from the time they're able to walk their
[1:10:14] entire life
[1:10:16] some are robbed of their eyesight
[1:10:19] some are robbed of this and that and the
[1:10:21] other that God might get Glory out of
[1:10:24] their life
[1:10:26] isn't it amazing when you look at it
[1:10:28] some bring glory to God but what they do
[1:10:31] others bring glory to God but what
[1:10:34] they're not allowed to do
[1:10:36] but they judge him faithful
[1:10:38] who considered this their lot
[1:10:41] in life
[1:10:43] despairing it
[1:10:52] I wonder with every head bowed here
[1:10:54] today if there's any one year
[1:10:56] who would like to be remembered in
[1:10:58] prayer
[1:10:59] would you just raise your hand to the
[1:11:00] Lord God bless you God bless you
[1:11:04] if you're not ready my friend to meet
[1:11:06] the Lord Jesus if you're not ready to
[1:11:08] meet brother Eugene
[1:11:10] there's only one way you can be ready
[1:11:12] we're not pointing you to a church we're
[1:11:15] not pointing you to some system
[1:11:16] somewhere or pointing you to a person
[1:11:20] the Lord Jesus they come to this earth
[1:11:23] to give his life for you for me for
[1:11:25] brother yucci
[1:11:27] it's brother Eugene perfect oh no no he
[1:11:30] made so many mistakes like all the rest
[1:11:32] of us
[1:11:33] but he had found a place where he could
[1:11:35] be able to confess his mistakes
[1:11:38] and that was in the blood of Jesus
[1:11:40] Christ
[1:11:42] Heavenly Father
[1:11:45] I wish so love and miss our brother
[1:11:49] dear God I thank you for him
[1:11:52] now he's come up to your house
[1:11:55] Lord I just can't imagine what he's
[1:11:57] already experienced
[1:12:00] he's not been sleepy one day
[1:12:02] he's not been tired he's not been weary
[1:12:05] and we know him in reality that in that
[1:12:08] Dimension they they don't peer down in
[1:12:11] this life and still see the troubles and
[1:12:14] the difficulties that we are still
[1:12:15] dealing with it certainly could not be a
[1:12:17] place of Joy if they did
[1:12:19] but they moved into a sphere into a
[1:12:22] realm that is beyond what our poor Minds
[1:12:24] can imagine today
[1:12:26] a land of Eternal peace joy happiness
[1:12:31] they're not going anywhere
[1:12:33] he's been there to offer that over a
[1:12:36] month
[1:12:36] and it no doubt just seems as if though
[1:12:38] it was yesterday
[1:12:40] they have no appointments they have no
[1:12:43] watches no time clocks to punch
[1:12:47] they're not going anywhere
[1:12:49] they have just arrived
[1:12:52] and we have a little bit of
[1:12:54] understanding in what kind of house they
[1:12:55] live in it's the house that Paul told us
[1:12:58] about a house not made with hands
[1:13:02] Eternal in the heavens
[1:13:04] we long to see our brother father
[1:13:07] I pray you would help each of us no
[1:13:10] matter what you've chosen us to be
[1:13:12] whether we will be known by what we have
[1:13:15] done or we will be known
[1:13:18] but what we were not allowed to do
[1:13:21] may we be faithful father
[1:13:23] may we be true Lord God I pray
[1:13:27] touch every heart you saw the hands that
[1:13:29] were uplifted all over this Congregation
[1:13:32] of people today father would you
[1:13:33] minister to him
[1:13:35] if there's some here today that don't
[1:13:36] know you may they be able to make peace
[1:13:39] with you father
[1:13:40] may even in our brothers memorial
[1:13:43] service
[1:13:44] May something of the life that he lived
[1:13:47] touch some of those that are still here
[1:13:49] today
[1:13:50] we committed to you father in the name
[1:13:52] of the Lord Jesus we ask
[1:13:55] amen
[1:14:34] spin of them
[1:14:37] wonderful service memorial for precious
[1:14:41] brother
[1:14:42] Ryan I said brother Eugene s wanted me
[1:14:46] to sing this song as I was going over it
[1:14:48] this morning uh
[1:14:51] the name of it's almost home
[1:14:53] as I was practicing it I just thought
[1:14:56] the first verse it starts out are you
[1:14:58] disappointed are you desperate for help
[1:15:01] do you know what it's like to be tired
[1:15:04] and only a shell of yourself and I
[1:15:05] thought that was
[1:15:06] definitely brother Eugene from well not
[1:15:09] first met him just a strong
[1:15:12] muscled guy I mean just and then after
[1:15:15] years and years of suffering just a
[1:15:18] shell of himself but as all the speaking
[1:15:22] is being told about how faithful he was
[1:15:25] and how he just kept pressing the battle
[1:15:27] he didn't complain
[1:15:29] at the end of the second verse says
[1:15:33] foreign
[1:15:37] I think he might have left for the rest
[1:15:39] of us
[1:15:41] it says find strength and need help in
[1:15:43] each step knowing Heaven is cheering you
[1:15:46] on
[1:15:47] so for the rest of us I believe this
[1:15:49] today this afternoon brother Eugene is
[1:15:51] part of that cloud of witnesses that's
[1:15:53] telling us we're almost home you're
[1:15:56] almost home you've heard about it all
[1:15:57] your life and now that he's witnessed it
[1:15:59] he could say the half has never been
[1:16:02] told as good as brother Donnie has
[1:16:04] explained it and as many times as you've
[1:16:06] heard it
[1:16:07] it don't touch what it's like when
[1:16:09] you're here
[1:16:12] help me if you know this
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:22] you're disappointed
[1:16:26] are you desperate for help
[1:16:31] you know what it's like to be tired and
[1:16:35] only a share of yourself
[1:16:39] foreign
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:45] don't have what it takes
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:50] it so you can do just to move much less
[1:16:54] finish the race
[1:17:00] don't
[1:17:02] don't forget
[1:17:04] what lies ahead

[1:21:19] know from the family to
[1:21:22] to thank everyone for coming out today
[1:21:24] thank you all for taking the time out of
[1:21:27] your all schedules to come and honor my
[1:21:30] father today
[1:21:32] um I can say that
[1:21:36] as a son you know you you watch this
[1:21:39] journey you know we were we were
[1:21:41] teenagers whenever my dad got sick
[1:21:44] and
[1:21:46] I remember going to the hospital the
[1:21:48] first time and
[1:21:49] you know hearing people say
[1:21:53] I don't know how old I was exactly but
[1:21:55] you know the doctor's saying well you
[1:21:57] know
[1:21:58] might only have a couple more months to
[1:22:00] live we don't really know what's going
[1:22:01] on you know and
[1:22:03] it's like you know as a kid you know you
[1:22:05] take it hard and
[1:22:08] then years later and get another report
[1:22:10] well I think he's only got a couple more
[1:22:12] months to live and
[1:22:14] all right
[1:22:16] another decade goes by well we think
[1:22:18] he's only got a couple more months to
[1:22:19] live
[1:22:21] I can tell you one thing right now and
[1:22:23] you know I think I think brother Donnie
[1:22:25] did a great job you know covering the
[1:22:27] faith
[1:22:28] my dad was a fighter too
[1:22:31] you know and
[1:22:32] that's why you know whenever I got the
[1:22:34] call out in Arizona that you know Dad
[1:22:36] had passed away I'll be honest with you
[1:22:37] whenever I I heard he had been kind of
[1:22:40] declining you know pretty quickly I
[1:22:42] I'll be honest when you watch someone
[1:22:43] suffer for two decades your prayers
[1:22:46] start to change especially knowing what
[1:22:48] we believe you know the prayers they
[1:22:50] start changing and you don't
[1:22:53] I'd pray for healing but in my mind I
[1:22:56] knew what healing meant whether it was
[1:22:57] on this side or the other side it didn't
[1:22:59] make a difference
[1:23:00] you know and
[1:23:01] so I remember the the last couple of
[1:23:03] times you know we got phone calls about
[1:23:05] it and remember I told my wife I was
[1:23:07] like you know I said I'll be honest with
[1:23:08] you I said
[1:23:10] whether he goes on this side or or sorry
[1:23:12] whether he's healed on this side or
[1:23:14] whether he passes away and he's healed
[1:23:15] on the other side I said makes no
[1:23:18] difference to me
[1:23:19] you know it's like I I've cried because
[1:23:21] I missed them but I haven't cried from
[1:23:23] sadness one time yet and that's because
[1:23:26] man could you only imagine what he's
[1:23:28] what he's doing right now I watched a
[1:23:31] man confined to a bed a guy who who
[1:23:34] there were days he couldn't lift the
[1:23:35] blankets off of himself by himself
[1:23:37] someone had to lift the blankets off so
[1:23:39] that he could
[1:23:44] sorry I feel like I could preach another
[1:23:45] sermon up here but
[1:23:50] I just I don't want dad's the thought of
[1:23:53] dad to just be a sad thought of a guy
[1:23:55] who was confined to a bed because I
[1:23:58] watched a strong man the strongest man
[1:24:00] that I've ever known in my life
[1:24:03] you know I feel like me and Ryan's had a
[1:24:06] lot of expectation to live up to because
[1:24:09] you know I don't get the excuse of well
[1:24:12] I don't really feel like going to church
[1:24:13] today because the second I do my thought
[1:24:16] of my dad comes up and I'm like this guy
[1:24:18] couldn't lift the blankets off of
[1:24:19] himself yet
[1:24:22] mom helped them get in a car and drove
[1:24:24] to church he couldn't get out of the car
[1:24:25] he couldn't get inside of the church
[1:24:28] building he would just sit out in the
[1:24:30] car because he wanted so badly to be
[1:24:31] with his church family he told us all
[1:24:33] the time that this was this was his
[1:24:35] family and he wanted so badly to be
[1:24:37] there with you all that he would go and
[1:24:39] just sit in the car just so he could be
[1:24:41] close to you he could do like everyone
[1:24:43] else and he could listen online he could
[1:24:45] stream it that'd be perfectly fine no
[1:24:46] one would fault him for that but he
[1:24:48] couldn't do it he had to be there
[1:24:50] because that's that's where he felt at
[1:24:52] home
[1:24:54] so like I said my dad was strong as can
[1:24:56] be so my prayer changed the last few
[1:24:58] times and it was
[1:24:59] Lord if he's not meant to be healed on
[1:25:01] this side take him take him peacefully
[1:25:02] take him quickly that's perfectly fine
[1:25:04] we're okay with that I remember talking
[1:25:06] to Dad on the phone he could barely
[1:25:08] could barely hear me could you know
[1:25:09] could barely talk and I told him I said
[1:25:11] look
[1:25:11] I said we have this side covered I said
[1:25:14] we'll take care of things on this side
[1:25:15] don't worry about it I said if you need
[1:25:16] to go go that's fine
[1:25:19] sorry I'll uh I'll go ahead and get to
[1:25:22] this I just I want to take a second and
[1:25:24] uh I want to thank everyone that made
[1:25:26] this possible I know that this was kind
[1:25:28] of difficult to throw together and
[1:25:30] um I had to change locations and I just
[1:25:33] I want to thank everyone that took care
[1:25:34] of the food for the family and stuff and
[1:25:37] that unfortunately I don't I don't
[1:25:39] really have names in a list or anything
[1:25:40] but I just want to say we we appreciate
[1:25:43] it we greatly appreciate you all taking
[1:25:45] the time to to do that for our family
[1:25:47] and our friends
[1:25:49] um again you know thank you brother
[1:25:50] Donnie for for speaking today I know
[1:25:53] that your family's been going through a
[1:25:54] difficult time and we're praying for you
[1:25:56] but I want to thank you for for taking
[1:25:58] the time out today to be able to help
[1:25:59] honor dad and the musicians thank you
[1:26:03] all I really appreciate it uh the sound
[1:26:05] guys who got here early and took care of
[1:26:07] things and our guys over here who you
[1:26:09] know helped get things off the stage
[1:26:11] move things and Maddie who's who's been
[1:26:13] there for us well the entire week pretty
[1:26:15] much so uh you know helping any way that
[1:26:18] he could and I know that since I've been
[1:26:21] gone there's been so many people take
[1:26:22] care of dad and take care of Mom and
[1:26:24] come and help with the house and
[1:26:26] I could sit here and thank all of y'all
[1:26:27] so much but
[1:26:30] I just want to say that that I love you
[1:26:32] and I know the Dad loved you all too
[1:26:34] and like I said he wouldn't want this
[1:26:36] service to be one of sadness he wanted
[1:26:39] to be you know joyous and people people
[1:26:41] rejoicing and people drawing closer to
[1:26:43] the Lord because that's all he actually
[1:26:44] cared about
[1:26:45] so again I just I want to thank you all
[1:26:48] and I want to tell you all that I love
[1:26:49] you and if you don't mind I'm gonna you
[1:26:51] know dismiss everyone in prayer actually

[1:26:54] quick we do have a uh it's a memory book
[1:26:57] uh just outside right here some people
[1:27:00] might have seen it as they came in
[1:27:02] um they said if you want to if you want
[1:27:04] to just share a memory that you have of
[1:27:06] them uh it doesn't matter what it is or
[1:27:08] if you just want to sign your name
[1:27:09] that's perfectly fine too but if you
[1:27:11] could take time to to just do that real
[1:27:13] quick after the service and also I don't
[1:27:16] know as far as like floral arrangements
[1:27:18] if if we had any but if there is uh let
[1:27:21] Mom go through them first before anybody
[1:27:24] handles them just to give her time to to
[1:27:26] look at it and stuff so all right if we
[1:27:29] could just uh bow our heads please
[1:27:33] dear heavenly father we just want to
[1:27:35] tell you Lord that that we love you Lord
[1:27:38] we want to thank you Father for such a
[1:27:40] beautiful day that you've given us
[1:27:41] you've given us more time on this Earth
[1:27:44] with each other Lord but
[1:27:46] although we know like brother Donnie
[1:27:48] spoke Lord this is just a vapor Lord
[1:27:51] father when you realize how small your
[1:27:54] life is and how short your life is Lord
[1:27:55] you look to the things that are bigger
[1:27:58] Lord it blows my mind sometimes when I
[1:28:00] see people talk about you know as far as
[1:28:03] in science and stuff Lord and they see
[1:28:04] as far as they can see and I'm like yeah
[1:28:06] but you're thinking with man's
[1:28:07] understanding they're so much bigger out
[1:28:10] there
[1:28:12] feel like if we could just see that and
[1:28:14] we could just see how much more there is
[1:28:18] Lord Jesus we wouldn't be walking around
[1:28:20] sad because a man passed away we'd be
[1:28:22] rejoicing for what he found for the
[1:28:24] doorway that he passed through for the
[1:28:26] life that he has now
[1:28:28] Lord Jesus I couldn't imagine
[1:28:30] couldn't imagine Lord that's the life
[1:28:33] that he has now this is this is this is
[1:28:35] just a thought this is just a vapor it's
[1:28:37] nothing compared to what's on that other
[1:28:39] side
[1:28:40] Lauren if I could end this in any way I
[1:28:42] just pray for everyone out there Lord
[1:28:45] just draw close to him that's all you
[1:28:48] can do just draw close to him
[1:28:51] like brother Donnie said we're not
[1:28:52] trying to lead people to a church or
[1:28:53] lead people to a man just get to God God
[1:28:56] will lead you where you need to be but
[1:28:58] just find him
[1:29:00] Lord Jesus we just we want to thank you
[1:29:02] Lord and we just want to say thank you
[1:29:04] for the for my Dad's life Lord thank you
[1:29:07] for allowing me and my family to be a
[1:29:09] part of it Lord because what a blessing
[1:29:11] it's always been
[1:29:12] I Love You Lord with all my heart
[1:29:15] I pray you'll be with these people Lord
[1:29:16] as they leave today keep them safe in
[1:29:19] Jesus name amen
