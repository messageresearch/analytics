TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let me just tell you friends while this coronavirus and all this is going on on the earth and people are tore all to pieces and scared to death and let me just remind you God's prophet said it read it today and I shared it with a few folks that God's prophet said the worst thing the devil could ever put on you was fear fear is worse than cancer fear is worse than the flu it's worse than the coronavirus it's worse than any virus that there is down inhale and the Prophet goes on to say even if you had cancer if you did not fear it you wouldn't be in too bad a shape so don't go running around here and I can lock a bunch of people that ain't been told the Word of God when calamity comes what do we do we behave ourselves as sons and daughters of God sure wash your hands cover your mouth do all the sensible things but don't let the devil put fear on you because it won't just stop with the coronavirus you'll start fearing this and fearing that and fearing something else God has not given us the spirit of fear but of love and power and a sound now sure wash your hands be sensible I'm the one who bought those things out there for you to put your hands under you know germs are like Jesus they're everywhere so it's sensible to wash your hands and do all that sort of thing but don't let fear grab ahold to you look what it's doing to the world look what it's done to the stock market look what it's done to the people what brother Donnie shouldn't we take care of sure we should take care but I live that way every day of my life I take care every day I think that's the way we ought to live but I think it displeases the Lord when we let the media when we let the newspaper when we let us whether it's fox or CNN or CS NBC whoever it is scare the live around us we forget who we are we are God's children at the time of storm we are God's children at a time of pandemic we are God's children in the time of trouble because we're children by his blood [Applause]
