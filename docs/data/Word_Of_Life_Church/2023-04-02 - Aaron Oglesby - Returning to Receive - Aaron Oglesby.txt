greetings from from my home Church even like Tabernacle there in Minden Louisiana and from my pastor brother Tim Pruitt and just so thankful to have this opportunity you know I was telling some of my friends this weekend I've been visiting up here and well I was visiting Happy Valley every year since about 1999 just every summer coming I have so many friends here and it's just it's a incredible experience to stand here before you and here at Word of Life church today and um I'm thankful to have my wife with me sister Lydia and my two oldest children Aaliyah and Jude I'm just thankful for this opportunity it's such a wonderful thing I've always had such incredible respect for brother Donnie and and for for the ministry that has stood the test of time here and has always stood for truth and you ought to thank God every day for a pastor that stands and proclaims the truth in this day it's wonderful to have that and not only do I respect him and his ministry but there's so many men and women in this congregation who I've known to come to love and respect and you know there's no situation that's hopeless there's no situation that's hopeless I know many of you have probably heard that on Friday morning I got the phone call that my dad had passed away and and I was already here but the last time I spoke with my dad was Monday morning and and I sat there and he looked at me you know and his eyes had already turned towards Eternal things and he said Son no matter what happens he said if this turns south from me you do not cancel that trip he said you go do your job so I went and told him my goodbyes Wednesday morning knowing it'd be the last time I'd see him he told me I loved you and I told him I loved him and but talking about hopeless situations in the last few months of his life the Lord restored and did so many miraculous things in his life that so far exceeded physical healing that I can stand here today in peace knowing that he knows where he was going and I know where he was going you know my dad set in church with me for many many years but that didn't mean I could look you in the eye and tell you I knew exactly where he was going come on now he said on the pew let me tell you about a restoration I'm sorry just let me testify for a minute but Donnie in the year 2000 my parents divorced my my dad divorced my mom and I sat in the same church with my parents for 20 something years with one sitting over here and one sitting over there but two months ago God restored that marriage as they renewed their vows and she was by his side every step of the way all the way up to the crossing over don't you give up on your situation don't you give up on your loved ones don't you give up on that marriage don't give up on that lost son or daughter it's never too late it's never too late there's somebody out there this morning and he's working on your behalf don't ever give up on your situation God bless you this morning church returning to receive that's what we're going to speak on this morning returning to receive if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with us to the book of Isaiah chapter 44 pray you'll bear with me today is I I do have a a lot of scriptures to read uh not not at the beginning but as we go through there'll be a lot of scripture reading thank you brother Isaiah 44 we're going to read verse 28 and then we're going to move down to Isaiah 45 and 1. it says that saith of Cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to Jerusalem Thou shalt be built and to the temple thy Foundation shall be laid Isaiah 45 and 1. thus saith the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right hand I have Holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of Kings to open before him the two live gates the gates shall not be shut skipping down to verse 13. I have raised him up in righteousness and I will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for Price nor reward saith the Lord of hosts can we pray together this morning our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Lord as we stand here before these people Lord it is very evident to us Lord our insufficiencies and our inadequacies adequacies and we recognize Lord that we need you right now Lord we ask that you would just come and shut my mouth Lord where you'd have me to shut it and speak through me Lord and where you'd have me to speak Lord only you can come and take a sermon and break it apart in a way that it can meet the needs of this many people but Lord we've seen you do it time and time again and we're asking you to do it again this morning Lord speak to your people feed on my pray father take complete control of this service Lord we recognize the evil all around us and we see Lord that we're at the blending of Time and Eternity and Lord we just want to be ready and we want to be in our position ready to receive that which we're called to receive father granted now I pray in Jesus name amen amen you may have your seats it's good to be in the house of God this morning I want to look for a little bit at Israel and and their captivity in Babylon and the return back to the Homeland and as it relates to the church down Through the Ages and her captivity and mystery Babylon because we know that Israel being at being a type of the church and we know that Israel had strayed away from God and because of this they were exiled and they were taken down to Babylon and they would spend 70 years of Exile here just as Jeremiah had foretold that they would this Exile out of the Homeland would have great effects on them as a nation it would have great effects on their culture and it greatly would affect their worship they made attempts to continue to worship how they had done in the Homeland that Scholars actually believed that it was during this time of Exile there in Babylon that synagogues were established and they did this so that they could hold services in an attempt to worship the way they had done in the original the way they had worshiped at the beginning Services were held and holidays were observed there in the synagogues and they prayed here and and they practiced circumcision here and and the traditions of their religion was carried on in these synagogues there in Babylon Now understand as we say these things the problem wasn't with their worship they were doing the best they could where they were at with the truth that they had while in captivity even though they couldn't fully worship Him in spirit and in truth and and even though they couldn't sacrifice in the temple they were worshiping as best they could with what they had but the issue came when it was time to go back the issue came when there was an opportunity to be restored back to the original the issue came because they no longer saw the need to be restored back second chronicles 36 23 it says thus say Osiris King of Persia all the kingdoms of the earth half the Lord God Of Heaven given me and he had charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there among you all his people listen to The Challenge now who is there among you all his people the Lord his God be with him and let him go up historians say that if they were to attach a percentage to it perhaps those who actually left Babylon which is now Persia left Babylon and when go back would be no more than 10 percent of the Jews that were in captivity many believe that it was possibly as few as five percent so at least 90 percent of the Jews who had been living in the Babylonian Empire against their Wills now choose by their own choosing elect not to return to the original Homeland think about it now they have been given now look they're there and they had been given instructions while they were there to tarry they had been given instructions to do the best you can while you're here Jeremiah 29 5 said build your houses dwell in them plant Gardens eat the fruit of them take your wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminished and seek the peace of the city whether I have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the Lord for it for in peace thereof ye shall have peace in other words they had a prophet tell them that if you're planning your wheat go ahead and plant your wheat go ahead and hold your potatoes you've heard it said go ahead and plant your potatoes but in the tarrying they began to lose focus on the most important thing that we're not supposed to stay here forever in the tearing they lose focus that they're supposed to return to the place that they came from when they were taken captive they lose focus because in verse 10 it says for thus saith the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word towards you and causing you to return to this place now what place is he talking about he's talking about the original Homeland the place that they were taken captive from they're supposed to return to this place but they've been caught up now in the tearing and now they're too busy to think about leaving they're too busy to think about Wednesday night service because jobs got them tied down they're too busy going to this ball game and that ball game in this practice and that practice and this school thing and that school thing they're not doing sinful things but they're too busy in the tearing and they forgot that they're not supposed to stay here they've lost focus on what their goal is the goal is to go back the goal is to leave the goal is to return but they got too busy they're too busy in the tearing too comfortable in Babylon oh Lord help us too comfortable in laodicea [Music] they had grown accustomed to a little bit of Babylon mixed into their beliefs a little bit of denominational thinking sprinkled in they got too accustomed and they didn't see the need for an Acts 2 38 experience anymore they didn't see the need for an acts 4 experience anymore they said you know I can just accept God sent a prophet and stay right where I'm at they became comfortable in the tearing just believe on the Lord just accept God sent a prophet but God had come and provided an opportunity for them to go back an opportunity to move and I'm telling you when God says move you better move When God says go back and he opens the Red Sea you better go through it he says go back and when that comes you got to go all the way back you can't be like Reuben and God that got so caught up in the herds that they accumulated on the journey that they settled on this side of the Jordan they got so many herds that these grasses look good and they stopped they said we'll settle right here but there's got to be somebody says no I will not stop short I won't settle for anything less than the promised land I'm crossing over I'm going all the way all the way back all the way back all the way to my promises Hallelujah we can't stay here you can't get comfortable here Isaiah is writing this more than a hundred years prior to Cyrus taking control of Babylon and he calls Cyrus the anointed of the Lord he says I will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall free my people I think it's important that we come to the recognition people that God does things the way he wants to do things he doesn't ask our opinion and what we think ought to be done and how things ought to be run come on now we've got two used to a Burger King Society have it your way right away this ain't about your way he is the way he is the truth he is the life and when he lays it out in front of you like I told the young people the other night all you got to do is follow instructions this is so simple this whole thing is simple well I don't understand this and I don't understand that he laid out the instructions for you I don't know what to do just read the instructions just do what you're told to do it's his way and if you take his way you'll make it out of here it doesn't matter how you expect things to happen when you expect things to happen God does things the way he wants to do it listen God's in control no matter what we think I know I'm guilty we all gripe about this leader and that leader and this President and that President and Uncle Joe this and oh come on yeah but as hard as it is for except for us to accept this fact the ones that are supposed to be in control or in control doing what they're supposed to be doing listen they're bringing about an end time condition and us as the end time Believers why are we so shocked at an end time condition I'm saying this ain't this what's been foretold ain't this what we've believed ain't this what we've looked for all along and people are getting scared and worried we're not getting scared and worried we were told it was coming and we were told look up your Redemption draw it nah this doesn't worry me this confirms everything to me it's going Hometown Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord God chose Cyrus a pagan polytheistic King to set his people free and tell them go back you see Cyrus being polytheistic meaning he believed in many gods he looked at this situation and thought the more Gods I can have favoring me the better it is so he wanted the favor of their God will do whatever he has to do he'll move the people that he wants to move and I'm sure there in that day they were like well no no God's going to raise up a deliverer like he did with Moses he's going to raise up one of our Brethren a mighty man nope Cyrus Cyrus was the anointed of the Lord same thing happens in the day of Jesus they can't recognize him because they can't that he didn't come the way they expected it oh surely it's going to come from you know from this sector that sect and caiapha says so oh welcome him in nope in a Manger in a barn God did it the way he wanted to do it Hey listen if you got a problem with this message let me remind you God did it the way he wanted to do it he chose the messenger he spoke it the way he wanted it smoking it's exactly the way God wanted well I don't know about this and I don't know about that God didn't ask you he said this is my messenger this is my message it is Vindicated it is the truth it is the way just accept it God does it the way God wants to do it Hallelujah oh surely it'll be this one surely it'll be that one it'll it'll be this great Theologian nope William Branham that's the messenger and we're not looking for another amen God sent the message and it was delivered exactly the way he wanted it delivered so he foretells in Malachi 4. Malachi 4 5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children in the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse is prophesied of an opportunity to go back to be turned back an opportunity given to go back an opportunity to to return to the land of the word to the original land to the faith of the fathers the church had need to be turned back because it found itself down in Babylon it had started free it had started full of power there in Jerusalem the spirit could move freely the spirit could speak they operated according to Mark 16. they operated according to James 5. there was no claims on that church there was no false baptisms on that church there was no false Trinity doctrines on that church other false doctrines that down through the years that man put in those things didn't exist the the doctrines and the Deeds of the Nicolaitans had not taken hold yet he was a free church it was God's church it was how God wanted it and let us be reminded they were the pattern [Applause] they were the standard they were the original a few quotes here that you'll recognize from the church age book he says Pentecost was our pattern no one will have to say but what that church was in all that the church was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost that's what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep doing until the church age is close he says the true church how many hearers in the true church you believe that he says the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that early first one I believe brother Brown makes it very clear here what the pattern is and what we are to attempt to be like he even says they will try to approximate it but what happened to that first church because even though they're the pattern we don't want to repeat what they did sure it's not a return to repeat because in repeating what they did you go back into the ground this church is not called to go into the ground oh yeah all right so what caused that true First Church what happened to him the same thing that happened to Israel as they began to drift they begin to follow after other gods after the idea is a man they begin to drift and allow the ideas of man to rule in the church Prophet says it like this the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all began to fade and instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God it had cooled off and become a bit formal oh please don't ever let that describe you here at word of life no matter what they say about you I'd rather them sayeth a bunch of Holy Rollers over there than to be say they become a bit formal don't ever let that be the description of this church he said they become a bit formal then that second generation coming on was just like Israel they demanded a king to be like other nations when they did that they rejected God but they did it anyway that's the history of the church they let down the bars and goats come in and took over the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone oh they kept on with a form but the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is all about that's left he says but as usual people don't heed God's warning the Revival fire built upon the sacred word is so that a little fear Creeps in and a whisper in the heart says how can we protect this truth we have what can we do to see this revival goes on that's when the Antichrist Spirit comes in and Whispers you have the truth now see that it does not get lost how slick is he that he uses the fear and the love of Truth to ensnare you the fear and the love that I don't want to lose this truth this is a wonderful truth and he comes in and Whispers says you've got the truth now make sure you don't lose it and right here is where the capture takes place right here is where the church goes down into Babylon the very moment they organize that first move and yet even as the church began its Journey back from the Exile down Through the Ages as a restoration of Truth begins to come forth even as God would send Messengers down Through the Ages that Spirit kept working in the people to keep them from coming all the way back even though there was a restoration taking place even when they came out of Rome or even when they left Babylon if he could keep them with that same denominational mindset then he would still have a claim on the people he would still have a claim on that church and how would he do it fear of losing the truth listen the revelation of justification was so special brother Donny it brought such freedom the revelation of justification that you can be forgiven of your sins and that just shall live by faith it was a move of God and yet they came in and walled it up so tight they couldn't move any further they said we must protect this truth and they couldn't go on to sanctification and then the move of sanctification comes in as such an incredible truth it's so wonderful to be freed from worldly habits to be cleaned out by the power of God we must protect this truth and they wall it up so much that they can't go anywhere else and they're stuck right there at sanctification other moves of God that the move of Azusa Street comes and and the gifts are restored power of God pours out through a place this is wonderful this is the truth and they wall it up so tight they can never go beyond tongues and accept anything else and they're stuck right there [Applause] oh you ain't gonna like this but then God sends a prophet and we say this is the truth don't lose it and you wall yourself up so tight you end up with more Traditions than the denominations and you can't go beyond God's in a prophet and actually walk in the message that he sent you to walk in stop right there you gotta move on keep going progress to what the message called you to be Hallelujah don't wall yourself up keep going you're called to return imagine Egypt imagine Israel sitting there in Egypt as everybody leaves everybody marches out to the promised land and you sit there going God sent Moses [Music] where are you bunch of Fanatics going I'm staying right here on this truth that God sent Moses [Music] stuck in captivity by a truth [Music] hey look we got to be willing to move we got to be willing to progress you may have put blood over the doorpost the angel Death Angel passed over in the next day if you wouldn't leave you were still a prisoner many people are stuck at the place of their last victory listen if you were still dancing on the banks of the Red Sea a year later you was left behind move to the next Victory move to the next place keep going keep walking don't get stuck where you're at it may be a victory it may be wonderful but press on Church press on the more keep going Hallelujah [Applause] he says the Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit is gone oh they kept on with the form I don't want to focus too much on those that are still on the banks of the Red Sea because there's been a people whose Hearts have been turned all the way back there's a people that ain't stopping on this side of Jordan there's a people that's going to go all the way in and possess the land I believe I'm looking at some of those people tonight refusing to stop short of all the way refusing to stop short of everything that's been restored how dare us God sends a prophet in this day and restores all the truth and we only want to take some of it opens up all the word we only want to take some of it Lord I want all of it I want all you can give pour it out Lord I want all of it because I want to receive I'm returning to receive what you have for me in my life a return to the original a return to where our fathers worshiped and how our fathers worshiped yeah Hallelujah Jeremiah prophesied that they returned back to the land of their fathers the land of Abraham the land of Isaac the land of Jacob he says I will visit you and perform my good word and causing you to return to this place and as we already read there in Malachi the same thing it's prophesied that one would come and turn our hearts back to the land of Peter land of Paul the land of Stephen the land of the fathers and an opportunity arises by getting away from the first love the church had drifted further and further and further but God would send prophets and different servants down through the ages to keep hope alive that one day you're going to have the opportunity to go back one day there's going to be a restoration Malachi prophesied Joel prophesied just like in captivity and in Babylon that there was prophets that came and kept hope alive but finally the return comes and it's more than a hope the opportunity stares you in the face it's time to return time to go back time to rebuild and a prophet comes on the scene with a message from the King declaring Bible truths declaring Bible doctrines telling you return to the original you must have the token spoken word is the Original Seed only to find that Christians didn't want to go back only to find that they had become comfortable in Babylon they didn't want Bible holiness they didn't want real Bible sanctification they wanted a form of godliness they were comfortable with worldly comfort worldly entertainment most just didn't see the need they had their religion I've got religion we've got our synagogues we're do we're worshiping the way people have always worshiped and yet I don't have to give up this other stuff comfortable but the king decreed that we could go back the king puts forth a decree that we can rebuild the Temple and have the same worship our fathers had that we could rebuild the walls and have the same protection of the word that our fathers had we know during this time that around 42 thousand returned around forty two thousand they came at different times under different administrations but they were all under the consent of the current reigning King why didn't Moore come out you ever think about that the message makes so much sense how can you not see it how can you not see it it's Vindicated it's obvious it's right there why didn't Moore come out why don't Moore believe how could they see Vindication night after night after night and say I'm good I'll stay in Babylon how could they declare Bible days are here again how could that could that clear a man sent from God that wasn't message Believers saying that stuff brother died there was no message there wasn't churches like this that was the denominational world and they saw it and they heard it returned to the original go back go back to the Homeland and they said we're good right here why are you here when others stayed why are you here when others just can't see it Ezra one and five then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and the Levites with all of them whose Spirit God had raised to go up and build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem it's no accident you're here today it's no accident that you're returning it's no accident you're going back the spirit of the Lord has called you it has raised you out it has chosen you and something on the inside of you responds and says yes Lord that's me I don't know why they can't see it and why they don't hear it but the spirit of the Lord is moving in me it's no accident Hallelujah you've been called to go home you've been called to return there's a work that has to be done who's going to do it you're gonna do it you're called to do it you're called to the restoration you're part of the restoration all right we will not be stopped this move cannot be stopped because it's not man's move man didn't start it man can't stop it this is the move of almighty God that says build my house restore the worship go back to the Homeland Hallelujah there's something driving you back their hearts were being turned to the faith of their fathers by the moving of the spirit I will restore saith the Lord and the King begins to give back oh I love this the king begins to give back all that was stolen through the years of the Babylonian captivity Ezra one and seven also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods notice as things stolen from the original place of worship and being used for the worship of false gods [Music] in other words that yelling and screaming and shouting that they're using out there to worship their false gods was originally meant to be to worship the real true Living God yeah they're using it wrong but it's okay if we put that back in its place today he says even those did Cyrus King of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithra death the treasurer and numbered them unto chess Bazaar the prince of Judah and this is the number of them 30 charges of gold a thousand Chargers of silver nine and 29s 30 basins of gold silver basins of a second sort 410 and other vessels a thousand all the vessel bring up with them of the Captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem and the King says these things belong in the house of God these were part of the original worship that is being restored and I want them put back in the worship where they belong these doctrines were robbed true baptism put it back God had put it back serpent seed put it back those things have been robbed I want them restored put back in the house of God if you're going to worship how they worship Supernatural put it back prophecy put it back gets working tongues working the movement of the spirit put it back where it belongs in the house of God in the original worship Hallelujah it belongs to you you have a right to it it's yours and it's been returned today Hallelujah [Applause] freedom of worship was robbed the laity conquered put it back [Applause] Hallelujah hold the canker worm took this Palmer worm took this here's the gifts of the Spirit put them back put them back where they belong the king decrees take these things back and put them in the worship in the original where they belong because in order to worship like they did at the beginning you got to have these things these were stolen from the temple and as the work begins to progress even though they're a small group and even though they're a hated group and even though there is opposition on every hand the king provides for them every step of the way as a 3-7 they gave money also unto the Masons and to the Carpenters and meat and drink and oil unto them of zydon and to them of Tire to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the Sea of Joppa according to the grant that they had of Cyrus King of Persia he didn't send you here send you on this journey give you a commission and say good luck you make it hey this is the same guy that opened the Red Sea it's the same God that rained Man Out Of Heaven it's the same God that said put a serpent on the pole look and live your sickness he's provided for your finances he'll provide for you won't go down you won't come up against something that he hasn't already thought of he said I'm going to take care of you I'm going to provide for you every step of the way when he sends you on a mission he provides what you have need of to finish the mission [Applause] oh come on let's quit listening to the devil hell you're not gonna make it you can't do it you're not going to overcome let me remind him this is the King's work this is the King's edict he's the one that declared go back cooperate this isn't my idea I'm operating under an edict from the King Hallelujah and even though others aren't going back even though the majority of folks decided to stay in Babylon there there is a drive in this small group that says we must rebuild we must rebuild Jerusalem we must rebuild the city we must rebuild the Temple we must rebuild the wall there must be a restoration and with edicts from the King and with everything they need provided by the king they return and they began to rebuild and as they return to the original faith to the original worship it could not be mixed with other worship it could not have other people's ideas mixed in it couldn't be mixed with the Theology of man it couldn't be polluted with Babylon it had to be free from denomination it had to be pure just as it was at the beginning Ezra 4 1 says now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the Captivity builded the temple into the Lord God of Israel then they came to his Aruba and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you we're all working for the same kingdom here we seek your God as you do now right here it lets you know they ain't on the same side because they didn't say your God will be our God they said we seek your God there's no identification with it with it being theirs as you do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Essa hardened king of Asser which brought us up hither you know this seems reasonable we need to get this rebuilt man we can take all the help we can get it seems reasonable reasonable got us in this mess to begin with in the Garden of Eden quit worrying about reasonable what the word say quit worrying about reasonable what'd God say quit worrying about reasonable ah here we are well brother Donnie don't seem real reasonable this decision seemed pretty harsh listen God chooses his man he puts him in place and it ain't about what you think is reasonable you're not going to answer for the decisions made behind this Pulpit you're not going to answer for it but he will so let him be let of God we're gonna move so quick now away from that sorry think about it though we'd love to help you sure brother Brandon we'll support your meeting but lay off the women [Music] I will help get the tapes around we'll help do that we'll support the campaign we'll give you all the financial help you need but quit preaching that serpent Seed doctrine couldn't accept that help couldn't take that help the word adversary here means oppress or press someone hard so prior to the Jews returning to the Homeland these are the people that had been the dominant rulers so what they see is as there's a message to return they recognize we're about to lose some of our people we're about to lose control over the people their fits in a new wall and a new Temple and we're not going to be able to control them anymore oh come on why you think the devil fights so hard against you from getting the revelation of who you are and what you stand for and what you can do he's about to lose control of the people there's a people breaking free there's a people saying I don't gotta stay here that's my God I'm going back I won't stay here any longer he's about to lose control of the Bride world what as we begin gravity's losing its hold we're taking our flight Hallelujah he's losing control of the people Hallelujah Glory he's losing control of a people they don't want to lose their people so they offer a hand verse 3 but to ruble and Joshua the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God listen I don't care if you like the way we worship I don't care if you like the way our services go or what we preach we're worshiping Our God you worship your God how you walk you have no part Worship in our god this is our God we worship Him in spirit we worship Him in truth he has freed us he has loosed us and we will worship him the way we want to worship Him but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord God of Israel has King Cyrus the King of Persia had commanded us this return can't be mixed the y'all's clocks broke you got some bad batteries he's talking about it's got to be pure and unadulterated word because that's how it was at the beginning it was pure it was an adulterated and when they find no compromise here amongst the Israelites when they find that these are going to stay true to the king's edict no matter what then they begin to try to hinder the work well there's a lot of hinderers amongst us verse 4 then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building well what does this mean you know what this means did you hear what so-and-so said can you believe they're doing this at that church can you believe what brother died brother Daryl did that can you but that stuff I believe there's a lot of people that are mad that God didn't call them to preach so they take a Pulpit anywhere they can get and spew their gospel try to hinder the work if God would have wanted you to have a Pulpit he'd have gave you one you take your Facebook pulpit and your Instagram pulpit and whatever Pulpit you can find and begin to spew all this nonsense and false Doctrine I don't care there's a work to be done there's a restoration to be done you keep spewing I'm Gonna Keep building I'm gonna keep working I'm gonna keep doing what the king's edict said he said return go back build up [Applause] verse five and they hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days Osiris king of Persian Persia even until the reign of Darius King of Persia and in the reign of a hazarus in the beginning of his Reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem church one thing you can be sure of in this return is that you're going to face opposition [Applause] the enemy doesn't want to see you back in the Homeland again he doesn't want to deal with the power of God back in the church again oh come on now you read what happened to him in the book of Acts he ain't wanting to deal with that no more he liked it a lot better in the dark ages oh you saw what he had to do with in the ministry of William Branham now when you see a flesh bride begin to manifest the same things he don't want to deal with that so he tries to hinder the work I can't let him recognize I can't let them see what they're capable of I can't let them get that true revelation of who they are and so he's his opposition to the restoration and he tries to stop the work because look I know we call him a dumbo devil but he knows how to read and he understands that Israel cannot be blessed unless they're back in their Homeland and he recognized that they can't receive the Messiah until they're in their Homeland recognizes there's a bride at his longest Bible on has a claim owner then the Rapture can't go as long as they're stuck in Tradition as long as they're stuck in man's ideas then they can't receive the Messiah and he tries to keep you here but I'm telling you there's a people break and lose there's a people breaking free this idea don't matter that idea don't matter the word matters the standard matters I'm returning to this I'm going to be found standing in my place of restoration all right you find the same thing all down through Nehemiah we don't have time to go into it how they try to hinder the work but even Nehemiah he's not worried about the threats he's not worried about the accusations because he carries letters from the King that gives him the authority to do what he says he can do I'm not making this up church I got letters from the King that gives me the authority just say what I'm saying to do what we're doing to cast out demons to lay hands on the sick we got the authority to put Satan under our feet we've got the authority to worship we got the authority to praise prove it it's right here I brought my letter from the King today Hallelujah hallelujah it's your right it's the king's eat it [Applause] [Music] brother Branham says he's quoting a scripture and then he adds to it he says I will be found of you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from All Nations and from all the places where I've drove you saith the Lord and I will bring you again unto the place which I cause you to be carried away captive back to Pentecost he says they were very religious and so was those Pharisees but Jesus said except the man be born again he will in no wise enter into the kingdom you've got to go back to where we left him go back and find him for these Creeds was not so in the beginning the denominational churches was not so in the beginning so just drop everything and rush back to Pentecost and find the true and the Living God who heals the sick who cleanses the leopard who cast out devils and claims to be in the Bible the same yesterday today and forever what does this tell you this tells me that the King has decreed that you can have exactly what they had at the beginning you can have the same experience with the same Authority and the same power John 14 12. The Works that I do shall you do also an even greater every time brother Branham let me clarify that for nitpickers most times brother Branham lists the end time scriptures he will include John 14 12 in that list he'll say Malachi 4 5 6 Luke 17 30. Revelation 10 7. I'm 14 12. it's an end time scripture it's for you to fulfill you've been restored back to that it's a part we have to play we can't just put it off and say somebody else is going to do it there ain't nobody else coming we are the ones that are returning we are the ones on the way back it's our opportunity It's Our Moment it's our time to charge into the eternals and Ezra haven't turned down the help of the hybridized religion now faces their attacks as they try to hinder and Cyrus is no longer on the throne and for a Time the new king is ruling and they begin to write him letters and here for a little while we're probably gonna I'll read a good bit of scriptures y'all just bear with me Ezra 4 12. be it known unto the king that the Jews which came up from thee to us are common to Jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad City and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations Hallelujah be it known now unto the king that if this city be building and the walls set up again they will not pay toll tribute and custom and so Thou shalt and damage the revenue of the Kings now listen this is where they get themselves tied up he goes on to say search make a search maybe a search may be made in the book of the records of thy father so these are the ones trying to accuse the Jews they tell the king go search the records search the records so that thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious City and hurtful unto Kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed he says listen these are the same people that rebelled against you time after time and if you allow them to rebuild they're going to continue to cause trouble they're going to be rebellious once again look in the records and see if these people weren't sinners go to the records and see if they haven't failed you King Time After Time After Time go back into the records and see if these aren't the ones who went down into captivity and now they claim to be free now they claim to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now they claim to have a restored word search it out search the Records who are they to rebuild anything who are they this is the same church that fell away they fell away once before and you're going to let them rebuild it and for a time it causes the work to cease you know all the things they said were the truth sure everything they wrote in the letter was facts the facts were stacked up against them but none of the facts changed the truth that the king had made a decree that they were the ones that was supposed to go back and rebuild the city listen you can take all your facts and you can stack them up how you want and you still don't have the truth this in fact was I was a sinner that because I was lost fact was I was backslid fact was I was going to hell but the truth is he saved me he set me free stack your facts up I'll stand with the truth the truth said go back rebuild this is your city this is your Homeland that was the truth the fact is I'm sick the truth is he's my healer hello it's a fact my son and daughters out in the world the truth is they're coming back Hallelujah yes there have been false doctrines yes Pentecost had failed but the king said I will restore [Applause] the king said you can have whatever you have need of to finish the job Ezra 5 1. then the prophet saw the prophet and Zechariah the son of Edo prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the god of Israel even unto them then rose up cerebral the son of Chateau and Joshua the son of Joe sadak and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem and with them were the prophets of God helping them in response to the enemy trying to stop the restoration God sends a prophet again look into that message and they look at the prophecy and they say we ain't stopping I don't care what the facts stacked up saying my message says billed the prophets say build I'm going all the way back to Pentecost I'm going all the way back to the land I'm not stopping short and to begin to build and there's a drive within them there's a drive in a people today he says I'm going all the way back to Pentecost I'm not stopping oh and the devil didn't like that now who Do You Think You Are so in verse 3 it says at the same time came to them tonight the governor on this side of the river and set their bosn I and their Companions and said that son to them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall and once again they write to the king be it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea to the house of the great God which is builded with great stones and Timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on Hallelujah and prospers in their hands I say hallelujah then ask we those elders and said unto them who commanded you to build this house and make up these walls we ask their names also to certify thee that we might write their names of the men that were the chief of them and thus they returned us answers saying we are the Servants of the god of heavens and earth and build the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of Israel built and set up but after that our fathers had provoked the god of Heaven under wrath he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon the Chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon but in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God and the vessels also of gold and the silver of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought them into the Temple of Babylon those did Cyrus the king take out of the Temple of Babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was just bizarre whom he had made governor and he said unto them take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem and let the house of God be builded in this place then came the same chest Bazaar and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem and since that time even until now it hath been built in building and yet it is not finished now therefore now we're getting there I know I've read a lot but we're getting there now therefore if it seemed Good To The King let there be a search made in the king's Treasure House which is there at Babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning the matter we're going into chapter six now then Darius the king made a decree and a search was made Hallelujah of all the roles where the treasures were laid up in Babylon and there was found at agmouth and the palace that is in the province of the media role and therein was a record thus written in the first year of Cyrus the King the same Cyrus the king made it a Cree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem let the house be builded the place where they offered sacrifices let the foundations thereof be strongly laid and the height thereof three score Cupids and the breadth thereof three score cubits with great rows of great stones in a row of new Timber and let the expenses be given out of the King's house and also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem and brought into Babylon be restored and brought again into the temple which is at Jerusalem everyone to his place and place them in the house of God now therefore it's happening the governor beyond the river Seth bazana and the companions of the aparca sites which are beyond the river be ye far from this in other words get away from these people quit bothering these people this is not a cream get back get away he says let the work of the house of God alone let the governor of the Jews and the Elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place moreover I make a decree that you shall do to the elders and these Jews for the building of this house of God that of the king's Goods even of the tribute behind the river forth with expenses be given unto these men I want you to pay for this [Applause] home to build the house of God ages and that which they have neither both young bullets and Rams and Lambs for burnt offerings of the god of Heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail God I need a little something today here you go Lord I need healing today here you go I need a touch today here you go day by day by day without fail Lord I need you today here's some more I need you tomorrow here's some more every day without fail oh Hallelujah everything you have need of without fail Ure we're bringing this down you want to stop this restoration you want to tell me what I have a right to and what I don't have a right to I say search the records I say search the records today you say we ain't supposed to go up to Pentecost I say search the records you shouldn't be doing all that dancing in the church who gave you the right to do that I say let's just search the records Psalms 140 9-1 praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in the day than the records you have a right it's in the record searching today search the records Hallelujah Hallelujah oh we're not Pentecostals we don't need all them tongues and dreams and such going on okay let's search the records Joel 2 28. and it shall come to pass that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old man shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions Mark 16 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues that's the king's Egypt that's in the records it's yours you have a right to it you have a right to worship you have a right to praise you have a right to Freedom enjoy your freedom Hallelujah those that ain't too comfortable with Babylon don't mind enjoying their freedom [Applause] well we don't believe in Divine Healing and laying on our hands well according to the Kings you can be disappointed because he says in James 5 13. is any among you afflicted let him pray is any Mary let him sing songs is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him that's the king's eating I like this too much I'm enjoying this too much what about all shouting [Music] I understand that you don't like shouting in the chicken pen because it makes things Dusty so just give me a minute I ain't gonna stay here long because I've Heard a Voice from another world what about shouting he says be glad in the Lord Rejoice ye righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that are upright in your heart it's in the record well do we still get the Holy Ghost just search the record that promise is unto you and to your children to as many as our Lord God shall call Hallelujah I'm gonna have to y'all can sit down for just a minute I'm gonna skip to the end I'm gonna skip to the end so we can get this because this sermon had a point and I'm trying to get to it thank you not everyone returned only the ones that God had moved upon their heart but the ones that return came because they wanted to worship Jehovah the way that they were called to and they wanted to be in the place that they were called to be in they had to be where he had called them to be because there was something moving them back there was something driving them back something calling come out of her my people something on the inside turning their hearts back to the land of their fathers Israel had to be established there was a word that prophesied there was a messiah coming he was to be born in Bethlehem Bethlehem had to be there the people had to be there Jerusalem had to be rebuilt the Messiah was to come there Zechariah 9 9 Rejoice greatly o daughter of Zion's Shadow daughter of Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto thee he is just in having salvation lowly and riding upon a house and upon a cult the foe of an ass they had to return in order to receive their promise they couldn't receive it in Babylon but something drove them to return they were driven they had a mind to work they had to be there things had to be ready and they worked and they built to get back to what the original was Ezra 3 12 but many of the priests and Levites and the chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice they felt like they failed we saw who saw what it used to be they had such Glory it was so magnificent this doesn't compare this has fallen short I got 2-1 it says in the seventh month in the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the Lord by the prophet haggai saying speak now to zeruble son of chattel the governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Joe sedek the high priest and to the residue of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing the Ark of the Covenant is not there right you're in my thumb is not there it didn't have the fire that originally fell from heaven there verse 4 yet now be strong Jose rubel saith the Lord and be strong o Joshua son of Joseph the high priest and be strong all you people of the land saith the Lord and work for I Am with You saith the Lord of hosts according to the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear not for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake all nations in the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts what's he telling them just a little while in the Messiah himself is going to be here just a little while in the Messiah himself is going to walk in this Temple he says the silver is mine the Gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I get peace saith the Lord of hosts in other words don't worry about the silver don't worry about the gold don't worry about what you built that all belongs to me anyway what's going to make this house so glory is I'm going to walk in it the Messiah is going to be dedicated here he's going to preach here he's going to move through it on a daily basis his glory he's going to fill the temple and that's why they had to be in that place why did we have to come back why were we driven out of the denominations oh we look around and maybe we don't compare to their grander it's not as big Lord we tried Lord we've done the best we could with the message we've stood we're still staying and it's an evil day we're doing our best but it just don't compare look at that first stage rugged Man men who gave their lives men who died look at the Miracles look what they've done Lord and he says but the crowning Glory of this age why did I have to come back because this is where the Messiah is coming he's coming back to the original he's coming back to the Homeland and the glory of this age will far exceed the previous ages because we're going to receive the Messiah we're going to receive the body change and we come back to receive I have returned to receive and I won't stop short I won't quit building I won't quit proclaiming because this is where the Messiah is coming to take his Original Seed back home Hallelujah Hallelujah blessed

read it to you a few weeks ago where the Jews said in the book of Nehemiah was said about the Jews their enemy said it well even if a fox goes up on that wall they'll knock it down that was their report but Nehemiah said I'm up on the wall I'm doing a good work and I ain't coming down we searched the records that didn't stop them so they sent some Messengers out and said hey why don't you come
