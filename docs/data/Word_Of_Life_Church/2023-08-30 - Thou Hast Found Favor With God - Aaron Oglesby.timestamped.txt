[12:54] He emailed a testimony in and said I had
[12:59] to share a testimony said maybe a little
[13:02] long said he went to a men's Bow Shoot
[13:03] in Ohio I think there's a church there
[13:06] that puts uh kind of that gets the event
[13:08] together Brother David Seiler preached
[13:11] that weekend
[13:12] on Sunday morning said the Lord had been
[13:15] dealing with him about love lately how
[13:18] important the Capstone is
[13:20] said he's able to share a little bit
[13:21] with a girl at the gas station so then
[13:24] today came to get something to eat
[13:26] talking to a gentleman in the lobby and
[13:28] expressing to him how much love is
[13:31] missing in our society he said he went
[13:33] to order and there was a gentleman with
[13:34] his nephew turned around and paid for
[13:36] his lunch and the gentleman that he was
[13:38] speaking with also got a chance to
[13:40] witness to another right there in the
[13:42] lobby
[13:43] and then he asked if he wouldn't mind
[13:46] praying so he took their hat off prayed
[13:49] right there in the lobby of the
[13:50] restaurant set just a confirmation from
[13:52] God showing him charity of love and
[13:56] charity
[13:57] it said how important it is to be

[14:15] pulling into urgent care with his father
[14:17] and it said just spoke to him that he
[14:20] could just pray for the situation right
[14:22] there said the Lord delayed him on his
[14:23] heart and said God uses his body for one
[14:26] another and said just be willing and
[14:29] sensitive of that small still voice that
[14:32] says praise God hallelujah thank you to
[14:34] you all amen just wanted to
[14:36] talk about how that the Lord sometimes
[14:40] lays people on our hearts and you know

[14:46] for him send them a text call them amen

[41:24] says in and in the sixth month the angel
[41:27] Gabriel was sent from God into a city of
[41:29] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin
[41:32] espoused to a man whose name was Joseph
[41:34] of the House of David and the virgin's
[41:37] name was Mary
[41:39] and the angel came in unto her and said
[41:41] hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is
[41:45] with thee blessed art thou among women
[41:48] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[41:51] his saying and cast in her mind what
[41:52] manner of salutation this should be and
[41:55] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[41:58] for thou has found favor with God and
[42:01] behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[42:04] and bring forth the son and shall call
[42:06] his name Jesus he shall be great and
[42:09] shall be called the son of the highest
[42:10] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[42:13] Throne of his father David and he shall
[42:15] reign over the house of Jacob forever
[42:17] and of his kingdom there shall be no end
[42:20] then said Mary unto the angel how shall
[42:23] this thing be seeing I know not a man
[42:25] and the angel answered and said unto her
[42:27] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[42:30] the power of the highest shall
[42:31] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[42:34] thing which shall be born of of thee
[42:36] shall be called The Son of God and
[42:38] behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath
[42:41] also conceived a son in her old age and
[42:43] this is the sixth month with her who was
[42:45] called Barren for with God nothing shall
[42:49] be impossible
[42:50] and Mary said behold the handmaid of the
[42:53] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[42:56] and the angel departed from her amen I
[43:00] pray that the Lord will add His
[43:01] blessings as you have your seats
[43:03] amen I was just in prayer for tonight's
[43:07] service and
[43:15] I've said this before but I used to
[43:17] never would take my coat off
[43:19] because I had a little bit of a complex
[43:21] about how fat I was
[43:23] and then I saw myself with my coat on I
[43:25] said it didn't help none so I might as
[43:27] well get comfortable
[43:28] so
[43:31] might as well be comfortable amen
[43:35] as I was looking into what to minister
[43:37] and
[43:38] and the Lord just laid this on my heart
[43:40] and
[43:42] and I was torn between two thoughts and
[43:44] he began to lead me this way and
[43:46] my instructions were to encourage
[43:49] so we're here to encourage and put our
[43:51] shoulder to the wheel and to encourage
[43:53] tonight up I love this account of Mary's
[43:56] visitation and the conversation that she
[43:58] has here with the angel and brother
[44:00] Brown will take this story of Mary's
[44:02] going to the well and he dramatizes it
[44:04] in several different places and and he
[44:07] really begins to bring it to life and I
[44:09] want to minister to you tonight on the
[44:11] thought thou has found favor with God
[44:14] thou have found favor with God and and
[44:17] brother Branham takes this story and and
[44:19] when he does he talks about how Joseph
[44:21] and Mary had gone to service that day
[44:24] and they had gone into the service and
[44:26] brother Branham says it had been a
[44:27] wonderful service and that that the
[44:30] rabbi there had talked about how God had
[44:32] brought them out of the land of Egypt
[44:33] with a mighty hand and and how they when
[44:36] they came down to the Red Sea that that
[44:38] God had parted the Red Sea for them and
[44:40] and when they needed food that God had
[44:42] reigned Manna down from heaven and that
[44:44] God had brought water out of a rock and
[44:47] that God had rolled back to Jordan and
[44:48] how when they got there there had not
[44:50] been a feeble one amongst them even
[44:52] though they had been wandering in the
[44:53] wilderness and the rabbi talked about
[44:55] Victory after Victory after Victory and
[44:58] bro Brown says it was a wonderful
[44:59] Service as he talked about what a great
[45:02] God that they had he said but brother
[45:04] Branham goes on to say he says but then
[45:07] he ruined the service
[45:09] says it was a wonderful message but at
[45:12] the end of it the rabbi ruined the whole
[45:14] thing by saying God just doesn't operate
[45:18] like that anymore he said it wasn't
[45:21] necessary anymore he said the people
[45:23] have settled in the Homeland and they
[45:25] don't need the god of Miracles anymore
[45:27] and I'll tell you they'll ruin a service
[45:29] for me pretty quick if we start taking
[45:31] that tone as well you can lay it out as
[45:34] best as you can and have the most
[45:35] beautiful power points and speak
[45:37] eloquently but if we start talking down
[45:39] the line that God don't do that anymore
[45:41] I'm gonna tell you real quick that just
[45:43] ruined the service for me that's where I
[45:46] check out that's where I get off that
[45:47] train because let me be here to tell you
[45:49] tonight God still does that God still
[45:52] moves that way and I still need him to
[45:55] move that way in my life amen listen too
[45:59] many times we get the attitude of wasn't
[46:01] God great
[46:03] wasn't it awesome the way that God used
[46:06] to heal and God did those things just to
[46:08] get people's attention until he could
[46:10] get them settled back in the homeland of
[46:13] the word
[46:14] oh but now that we're settled down we
[46:16] don't need the supernatural anymore we
[46:18] don't need the god of miracles in him
[46:20] listen they may not say it with their
[46:22] words but with their attitudes they do
[46:24] with their attitudes those things come
[46:26] out and and too many times we're
[46:28] relating the testimonies as if there's
[46:31] something that has to stay in the past
[46:32] God did God did God did yes sir God did
[46:36] but why do we tell testimonies not to
[46:39] talk about how great he was but to
[46:41] remind you of what he can do right now
[46:43] in this moment in this service today
[46:46] it's not about how great he was I'd love
[46:49] to testify but it's to remind me that if
[46:51] I'm sick he healed today if somebody's
[46:54] lost he saves today if you need the Holy
[46:57] Ghost he feels today because he is the
[47:00] same yesterday today and forever amen
[47:04] I'm not against testifying I believe in
[47:06] it but for the purpose of building faith
[47:08] for now that is the purpose of our
[47:12] testimonies what does God want to do
[47:15] tonight
[47:17] what does he want to do in our midst
[47:19] right now because listen hopefully we're
[47:21] not gathered here tonight to fulfill a
[47:24] religious Duty
[47:25] hopefully that's not our intentions and
[47:27] just coming together and and hearing a
[47:30] good service and and maybe hearing A
[47:31] good sermon listen the days of just
[47:33] having good sermons and going home and
[47:35] saying wasn't that great that needs to
[47:37] be over what did that good sermon do
[47:39] what did God do for you how were you
[47:41] changed how were you molded how did God
[47:43] interact listen he is a living God and
[47:46] he's in our midst tonight and he wants
[47:48] to operate in this building tonight at
[47:50] your seat not just somebody else's seat
[47:53] it might be good for them and you're
[47:54] sitting there going oh that's good that
[47:56] brother needs it that brother needs it
[47:58] but how about you find a spoonful for
[48:00] yourself find a shovel for yourself and
[48:03] feed on the word say God deal with me
[48:05] tonight move tonight discern my heart
[48:08] tonight
[48:10] Hallelujah
[48:12] I believe there's a living God in our
[48:14] midst
[48:15] I believe it's going home time
[48:18] I believe it's time for prodigals to
[48:20] come home
[48:23] Justin it sure was good to see you
[48:25] singing
[48:27] I sure bless my heart
[48:29] and there's more of that
[48:31] there's more out there but listen we got
[48:33] a promise we got a promise and the
[48:35] promises of God are just as good as God
[48:37] himself and he says if I've got Jesus
[48:40] I've got everything if I got a promise
[48:42] my son's coming he's coming if I got a
[48:45] promise of healing I'm Healed if I got a
[48:47] promise of Deliverance I'm delivered
[48:49] just stand on the word tonight he is the
[48:52] same yesterday today and forever there's
[48:56] Chronicles coming home there's
[48:57] Deliverance coming to your house their
[48:59] salvation coming to your house
[49:01] Hallelujah I've heard testimonies from
[49:03] this very place about prodigals there's
[49:06] more coming there's more coming just let
[49:09] it be a sheep way there's more coming oh
[49:13] I can't wait to see the day where you
[49:15] can't find a seat in this place just
[49:16] because of the prodigals that have come
[49:18] back
[49:20] why we need all these seats cause
[49:22] there's more coming we're gonna blow
[49:25] this place apart
[49:27] it's gonna fill it up
[49:29] there's more coming
[49:31] I'm expecting more
[49:34] listen some folks believe this isn't the
[49:36] season for miracles
[49:38] how can we be
[49:40] on the verge of the rapture
[49:44] the change of our bodies which will be
[49:47] the biggest most total and complete Mass
[49:49] Divine Healing in history and it not be
[49:52] the season for miracles it has to be the
[49:55] season for miracles because I'm about to
[49:56] get one I'm about to have one and I know
[49:59] there's been Miracles Happening Here
[50:00] service after service but pretty soon
[50:03] it's going to sweep across don't tell me
[50:05] it's not the season for miracles it's
[50:07] the season of the body change it's the
[50:10] season of The Rapture it's the season
[50:12] for God to pour it out like never before
[50:15] I'm expecting more God bless more
[50:18] Supernatural more moving of the spirit
[50:20] more power more Revelation I'll take it
[50:24] all I'm expecting more
[50:26] Hallelujah
[50:28] our expectations should always be for
[50:30] more
[50:31] I say pour out more Lord
[50:34] pour out more or less come expecting
[50:36] more and creating an atmosphere for more
[50:40] let the spirit Move Free In Worship
[50:42] let the spirit move free in preaching
[50:45] let the spirit Move Free and now listen
[50:48] I say the only thing that we need to
[50:50] bind up is the devil it's time to bind
[50:52] up sickness bind up complexes bind up
[50:55] hatred bind up bitterness and let the
[50:58] spirit free let your brothers and
[50:59] sisters be free but let's bind up the
[51:02] enemy tonight quit throwing stones at
[51:05] our brothers and start throwing them at
[51:07] the Devil quick tying up our brothers
[51:09] and let's bind up the devil tonight
[51:11] Hallelujah
[51:16] listen we don't have time for cold and
[51:18] formal
[51:22] we don't have time for just another
[51:23] Wednesday night service
[51:27] it's time to manifest what he manifested
[51:31] listen these are beautiful quotes bone
[51:33] of his bone flesh of his flesh Pirates
[51:34] power she is it's got to be more than
[51:36] quotes
[51:38] we got to begin to manifest what he
[51:40] manifested it's time that fruit begins
[51:43] to come forth It's Time to let God out
[51:46] of the box and just let him move
[51:50] yeah
[51:51] listen it ain't something we're trying
[51:52] to work up
[51:53] it ain't something you have to work up
[51:55] because if he's Divine and we're the
[51:57] branches then every branch that comes of
[51:59] that bind will bear the same fruit
[52:02] so if the very first Branch came out of
[52:04] that vine wrote a book of Acts
[52:07] we know the quote
[52:09] but when's it going to be more than a
[52:10] quote
[52:12] then this branch is going to Bear the
[52:14] same fruit as the first branch and you
[52:16] don't have to work it up you just got to
[52:18] be who you are you just got to let the
[52:21] life of the vine flow through the branch
[52:23] and it'll produce the works listen if
[52:26] you work it up and if you work up a run
[52:28] and work up a shot I don't want it
[52:30] I don't want it
[52:32] but when it's the Life coming out of the
[52:34] vine flowing into the branch I say I
[52:37] don't want to stop it just flow Lord
[52:39] Jesus flow Lord Jesus move how you want
[52:42] to move in this service tonight
[52:45] we don't have to work it up it's just
[52:47] who we are
[52:48] it's Who We Are
[52:51] we've returned to the original we just
[52:54] have to let him do what it is that he
[52:55] wants to do and get out of the way
[52:58] too many times we want to blame the
[53:01] devil for all the hindrances and a lot
[53:02] of times we're the hindrance
[53:06] go back and look at the word and in the
[53:08] book of Acts and and almost every single
[53:10] time that you find a major outpouring or
[53:13] a major event it'll start off by saying
[53:15] they were in one mind and one Accord and
[53:18] then this happened
[53:19] one mind and one Accord and then this
[53:21] happened and I wonder what percentage
[53:23] honestly
[53:25] have we ever had
[53:27] of everybody in One mind and one Accord
[53:31] and I I think if we gave it 50 we'd be
[53:33] doing pretty good
[53:35] and we've had some pretty amazing
[53:37] services with the failing grade
[53:39] that's an if
[53:42] what would happen if more of has got in
[53:45] one mind more of us gotten one Accord
[53:47] and right now you weren't thinking about
[53:49] Thursday you weren't thinking about what
[53:51] happened yesterday and you sure wasn't
[53:52] thinking about that brother that
[53:53] offended you 10 years ago but you were
[53:55] here thinking I need Jesus tonight I
[53:57] need Jesus to move tonight I need him to
[53:59] heal tonight I need him to fill the
[54:01] night Jesus Break Forth in this place
[54:03] tonight I need you pour yourself out
[54:06] tonight
[54:08] we let so many things distract us and
[54:11] pull us from what we really need to
[54:13] happen tonight we need him to break out
[54:15] in this place like never before right
[54:18] now in this moment in this service
[54:24] and we're making it about a service if I
[54:26] want to make it about you God wants to
[54:28] move for you
[54:29] God wants to move in your situation he
[54:32] wants to display his power on your
[54:34] behalf
[54:35] and listen God is willing and able but
[54:38] he's looking for people who will take
[54:39] him out his word
[54:41] somebody that will believe no matter
[54:43] what anybody else says or no matter what
[54:45] the doctor says and no matter what the
[54:46] symptoms say someone who doesn't just
[54:49] quote Hebrews 13 8.
[54:51] but they believe it for their current
[54:54] situation
[54:55] for right now for today where I'm
[54:58] standing what I'm facing Hebrews 13 8.
[55:01] amen
[55:03] the rabbi that day
[55:05] believe that the miraculous was a thing
[55:07] of the past
[55:08] brother Brown said somehow that didn't
[55:10] satisfy the thirst and the hunger of
[55:12] Joseph and Mary
[55:13] listen that kind of stuff's never going
[55:15] to satisfy the hunger and thirst on the
[55:17] inside of a True Believer
[55:18] brother Branham goes on to say our
[55:20] Traditions our church Creeds will never
[55:22] satisfy a heart that's been called of
[55:24] God you cannot make him say the Apostles
[55:26] Creed or be sprinkled or something like
[55:28] that and be satisfied with it when the
[55:31] hunger of God is in his soul he will go
[55:33] back to Pentecost to the beginning and
[55:36] find the real holy ghost that sets his
[55:39] heart of Fire
[55:41] Lord set my heart on fire tonight I need
[55:43] more tonight brother Aaron have you been
[55:45] filled with the Holy Ghost yes sir but I
[55:47] want more tonight brother Branham said
[55:49] that the Dynamics of this bride would be
[55:50] a refilling of the Holy Ghost so Lord I
[55:53] need it if you said that's what we're
[55:55] going to have pour it out on me listen
[55:57] it is it's okay to testify of the past
[55:59] but it is never okay to be satisfied
[56:02] with what he did in the past
[56:05] it's okay to testify but it's not okay
[56:08] to be satisfied
[56:09] because when you get to the place
[56:12] that it's all in the past and it's not
[56:14] an Artesian well that's beginning to
[56:15] spring up and flow forth then suddenly
[56:18] you become stagnant
[56:20] and you begin to dry up
[56:22] and you become spiritually dehydrated
[56:26] you know if you look at it and I'm
[56:28] a medical person so if I get this wrong
[56:31] forgive me but the general consensus is
[56:33] that a person can live three to four
[56:34] days without anything to drink
[56:37] somewhere in there according to what I
[56:39] read maybe longer I don't know but let's
[56:41] just say three to four days you begin to
[56:42] really shut down
[56:44] well let's apply that to spiritually you
[56:46] telling me you're going from Wednesday
[56:48] to Sunday without anything to drink
[56:52] you're not taking a drink from Sunday to
[56:54] Wednesday try that no don't try that I
[56:55] don't want anybody sick
[56:57] but you know how thirsty you'd be
[56:59] how you wouldn't be able to function
[57:00] properly you wouldn't be able to
[57:02] manifest properly you wouldn't be the
[57:04] person that you normally are and if
[57:07] you're not drinking and you're not
[57:08] drinking brother Brandon says drink and
[57:10] push out and drink and push out and
[57:12] drink and drink and drink and drink the
[57:14] problem is a lot of y'all been sober too
[57:16] long all right
[57:17] it's time we start drinking again and
[57:20] not just on Sunday but let's drink on
[57:22] Monday and drink on Tuesday and drink on
[57:24] Wednesday and drink on Thursday that guy
[57:27] sounds like he's got a drinking problem
[57:28] yes sir and push out and drink and push
[57:31] out and drink and manifest that life
[57:34] from the inside of you quit going from
[57:36] service to service without drinking
[57:40] drink
[57:42] be strong
[57:48] listen the 50s were awesome
[57:51] the 60s were awesome
[57:53] but what about today
[57:55] Camp was awesome
[57:58] your dedication meetings were awesome
[58:00] hey Sunday was awesome
[58:03] but what about today
[58:04] what about right now
[58:07] what about tonight
[58:10] oh brother Aaron you're all about listen
[58:12] I'm all about what he said we could have
[58:14] I'm all about the promises that are in
[58:17] this book and I know I can't make it
[58:19] without each and every one of them so
[58:20] the reason I'm preaching this way is
[58:22] because I need God that opened the Red
[58:24] Sea to open up problems in my life
[58:26] tonight I need the god that Rain Man Out
[58:28] Of Heaven to feed my soul tonight I need
[58:31] God that moved as the fourth man in a
[58:33] fiery furnace to come down and move in
[58:35] my situation tonight I need God to be
[58:38] real and living and moving I can't make
[58:41] it any other way
[58:45] I need the pillar of fire that was in
[58:47] Moses day Paul's name William branham's
[58:49] day I need that Pillar of Fire tonight
[58:53] I need it right now
[58:55] not new to theology
[58:58] not something dried up the intellectual
[59:00] Doctrine not a better argument
[59:04] listen we didn't get this message so we
[59:05] could argue with people
[59:07] I need Hebrews 13 8 manifested I need
[59:10] John 14 12 in action
[59:13] and he expects it to be in action
[59:17] pardon me
[59:27] amen
[59:29] too many of us become satisfied with
[59:31] religion
[59:33] will become satisfied with religion the
[59:35] Pharisees became satisfied with religion
[59:38] but we can't get to the place
[59:40] to a religion satisfies us
[59:43] brother Brown said and Mary said you
[59:45] know since I heard the rabbi say that
[59:47] this great God that brought us here and
[59:49] made us what we are that he doesn't have
[59:51] to do things for us now like he did then
[59:54] I've been thinking for a long time if
[59:57] this God was as great in the Days of Our
[1:00:00] Fathers as he was in the days of our
[1:00:02] grandfathers then why isn't he just the
[1:00:05] same great God today
[1:00:07] that's only good thinking he says
[1:00:11] that's only good thinking
[1:00:13] you see Mary wanted something more and
[1:00:15] when and whenever you get to the place
[1:00:17] that you're not satisfied where you're
[1:00:19] at and you begin to hunger and thirst
[1:00:20] and long for More and You Begin to seek
[1:00:22] more you will get more
[1:00:25] why haven't I got anything lately
[1:00:26] brother and have you been seeking
[1:00:29] or have you been showing up
[1:00:32] because there's a big difference between
[1:00:33] seeking and showing up
[1:00:35] all right there listen there will be no
[1:00:37] perfect attendance Awards in heaven
[1:00:43] it's not about just showing up
[1:00:46] but when you're here are you seeking are
[1:00:48] you feeding are you pulling or you're
[1:00:49] growing are you recognizing what you're
[1:00:52] here for what the purpose of it is for
[1:00:54] the prophet would say that Mary and
[1:00:56] Joseph read from the scroll of Isaiah
[1:00:58] that afternoon
[1:01:00] and he says they read about the coming
[1:01:02] savior unto us a child is born
[1:01:05] and this is what she was dwelling on
[1:01:07] that day as she was walking down that
[1:01:09] little path going to the well
[1:01:11] listen there's a lesson right there we
[1:01:13] can learn
[1:01:14] what are you dwelling on
[1:01:17] what are we thinking on what are we
[1:01:18] talking about when we're with our
[1:01:19] friends what about what are our
[1:01:21] conversations consist of what where are
[1:01:23] we at on a daily basis and I get it I
[1:01:26] understand that life's busy
[1:01:28] listen there's things we have to do that
[1:01:30] life is stressful the world is crazy
[1:01:31] 401s are crashing everywhere
[1:01:35] there's a lot to think about
[1:01:37] there's a lot that that fills up our
[1:01:39] mind and so much running through our
[1:01:40] minds but if we can ever just stop and
[1:01:43] get our minds back on him if we can come
[1:01:45] back and get our Focus back on him then
[1:01:47] that's when we can have a visitation
[1:01:49] like Mary Had
[1:01:51] Mary's belief 1961 he said Hail Mary
[1:01:54] you're highly favored before God oh I
[1:01:58] like that that little woman in the
[1:01:59] meanest City there was in the world the
[1:02:02] meanest City there was in the world at
[1:02:04] the time known to be the meanest City in
[1:02:06] Palestine and in there she had lived
[1:02:08] such a life until God chose her for a
[1:02:10] certain work that he was going to do
[1:02:12] there she looked into his face and it
[1:02:14] startled her you know it's usually
[1:02:16] usually as we are thinking on those
[1:02:19] things
[1:02:20] the Bible said if there be any praise if
[1:02:22] there be any virtue think on these
[1:02:24] things I think the reason we don't see
[1:02:26] no more of it than we do is we got our
[1:02:29] minds on too many other things
[1:02:31] I think the Angels would still appear to
[1:02:34] us if we only kept our minds upon them
[1:02:36] but we're thinking about something else
[1:02:39] like where we're going a certain program
[1:02:42] we got to look at or certain shopping we
[1:02:45] got to do
[1:02:47] not sinful things
[1:02:49] just not giving him the thoughts not
[1:02:52] giving him the attention that he
[1:02:53] deserves and our minds are thinking on
[1:02:55] this and thinking on this and I say
[1:02:56] tonight let's turn our minds back to our
[1:02:58] mind back to his promises tonight let's
[1:03:00] turn our mind back to his goodness let's
[1:03:02] turn our mind back to his worthiness
[1:03:04] let's turn our mind back on on him
[1:03:07] tonight and let's begin to prepare for a
[1:03:09] visitation
[1:03:11] let's begin to prepare for a visitation
[1:03:14] not just talk about it no it's great
[1:03:16] that this happened to this one it's
[1:03:17] great why don't you begin to prepare for
[1:03:20] a visitation put your mind on it put
[1:03:22] your thoughts on it begin to ask God and
[1:03:24] pray for God because listen you may be
[1:03:26] in turmoil right now this may be the
[1:03:29] worst day you've ever had the most worst
[1:03:31] week you've ever had the worst month or
[1:03:33] the worst year but listen to me One
[1:03:35] Moment In The Presence of almighty God
[1:03:37] one moment will turn that around listen
[1:03:40] you can run from God for years and years
[1:03:42] and years and years and years and Satan
[1:03:44] can put in decades into your life and
[1:03:46] then you step into that presence just
[1:03:48] one time and it'll change everything
[1:03:50] it'll turn your life in around in a
[1:03:52] moment let your son have a visitation
[1:03:54] let your daughter have a visitation let
[1:03:57] your home have a visitation it'll fix
[1:03:59] marriages it'll bring young people back
[1:04:01] it'll take that bitterness out of your
[1:04:03] heart it'll do it all in one moment
[1:04:06] that's why we prepare for visitations
[1:04:08] because visitations can change
[1:04:10] everything in a moment
[1:04:14] not only be prepared but be looking
[1:04:17] because just because you don't recognize
[1:04:19] it doesn't mean it wasn't your
[1:04:21] opportunity
[1:04:25] there's a lot of people came in contact
[1:04:27] with Jesus and walked away unchanged
[1:04:30] because they didn't recognize their
[1:04:32] opportunity in his presence
[1:04:34] look for that opportunity
[1:04:37] prepare for a visitation because it only
[1:04:39] takes a moment
[1:04:40] the Fourth Man in the fire boy it seemed
[1:04:42] like it was too late but in one moment's
[1:04:45] time he took what what was sure death
[1:04:48] and turned it into an incredible
[1:04:49] testimony
[1:04:51] let him begin to work in your life and
[1:04:53] move in your life
[1:04:55] listen let's be like Abraham sitting in
[1:04:57] the tent door looking for him
[1:04:59] If Abraham would have been looking down
[1:05:01] the Sodom or arguing with his wife or
[1:05:03] doing all those things
[1:05:04] he might have walked right on pass
[1:05:07] but he was in the tent door looking and
[1:05:10] because he was in the tent door looking
[1:05:11] and he hosted him and he had his
[1:05:13] visitation there was a body change that
[1:05:15] came
[1:05:17] amen
[1:05:18] who's he appearing to
[1:05:21] people who are preparing for a
[1:05:22] visitation
[1:05:23] people who are thinking on him
[1:05:25] Philippians 4 and 8 says finally
[1:05:27] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[1:05:28] whatsoever things are on us whatsoever
[1:05:31] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:05:32] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:05:34] whatsoever things are of good report if
[1:05:36] there be any virtue and if there be any
[1:05:38] praise think on these things
[1:05:43] and the times that Mary lived in wasn't
[1:05:45] exactly just peaceful times that were
[1:05:47] rocking along where everything was
[1:05:48] smooth but Mary lived in a time that was
[1:05:51] actually very similar to our time it was
[1:05:53] a time of great trouble
[1:05:55] it's actually considered a bad time in
[1:05:57] the history of a place that was already
[1:05:59] a very troubled land it was a time of
[1:06:01] religious and political upheaval violent
[1:06:04] rebellions taking place evil leadership
[1:06:07] Roman occupation and the Romans were
[1:06:09] influencing everything and the Jews were
[1:06:11] all separated and bickering and arguing
[1:06:14] and fighting amongst themselves and it
[1:06:16] was in this type of atmosphere
[1:06:19] that Jesus comes on the same
[1:06:22] it's in that type of atmosphere that
[1:06:24] that Jesus shows up so what am I saying
[1:06:26] don't be discouraged by the things that
[1:06:28] you see around you tonight don't be
[1:06:31] discouraged by the fact that the world
[1:06:32] is falling apart all around you don't
[1:06:35] let it get you down what is it brother
[1:06:36] Aaron why is all this happening it's
[1:06:39] called end time conditions
[1:06:40] that's exactly what we're dealing with
[1:06:42] it's income end time conditions and this
[1:06:45] isn't the first in time that's ever been
[1:06:47] on the face of the Earth
[1:06:49] there have been other end times and
[1:06:51] every time there was an end time it was
[1:06:53] full of blatant evil instability so sin
[1:06:57] and it's always an anti-god climate
[1:07:03] there was an end time in Noah's day
[1:07:06] and in reference to the climate Genesis
[1:07:08] 6 and 5.
[1:07:09] and God saw that the wickedness of man
[1:07:12] was great in the Earth
[1:07:13] and that every imagination of the
[1:07:15] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:07:18] continually
[1:07:19] there was an end time for Sodom and in
[1:07:22] reference to that condition Genesis 13
[1:07:24] 13 but the men of Sodom were Wicked and
[1:07:27] sinners before the Lord exceedingly
[1:07:29] and according to Luke we can expect that
[1:07:31] exact same thing in this day Luke 17 26
[1:07:35] as it was in the days of Noah so shall
[1:07:38] it be also in the days of the son of man
[1:07:40] skip down to verse 28 likewise also as
[1:07:43] it was in the days of lot
[1:07:46] and then verse 30 even thus shall it be
[1:07:49] in the day when the son of man is
[1:07:52] revealed
[1:07:54] so as you look at each and every end
[1:07:55] time that's come before us as
[1:07:57] they did all that we're experiencing
[1:07:59] with the evil and the corruption and the
[1:08:00] instability is just end time conditions
[1:08:03] it's part of what's supposed to be here
[1:08:06] and Mary is living there in the ending
[1:08:08] of the Jewish dispensation and she's
[1:08:11] experiencing these conditions brother
[1:08:12] Branham says right in the middle of the
[1:08:14] most wicked city right in the midst of
[1:08:16] the world falling apart right in the
[1:08:18] midst of riots in the streets constant
[1:08:21] unrest and in the middle of all that
[1:08:23] Mary's mind is on the Lord
[1:08:26] in the midst of all that she's not
[1:08:28] wondering well I wonder if herod's going
[1:08:30] to get reelected or if that guy that
[1:08:31] there indicting is going to come back
[1:08:33] and get reelected and maybe we'll get
[1:08:35] this one in office and maybe they'll
[1:08:36] turn this and maybe listen when are we
[1:08:38] going to learn that the people in office
[1:08:40] are nothing more than Paul's in the
[1:08:42] hands of God and the ones that are there
[1:08:44] there for a reason to get us in the end
[1:08:46] time condition and here we are but she's
[1:08:49] walking in the middle of that and her
[1:08:51] mind is on the Lord her mind is God is
[1:08:54] good God is great I believe God is alive
[1:08:57] I believe God still moves I believe God
[1:09:00] is still The Miracle Worker and in the
[1:09:02] midst of that
[1:09:03] in the midst of that
[1:09:06] all of a sudden
[1:09:08] a flicker of light
[1:09:11] and an angel sits out
[1:09:13] with a message
[1:09:15] and says Hail Mary
[1:09:18] Thou Art highly favored
[1:09:22] Church listen in that moment the unrest
[1:09:24] didn't matter no more
[1:09:25] in that moment the politics didn't
[1:09:27] matter no more in that matter what was
[1:09:30] going on in this church and that church
[1:09:31] and what this one was saying and that
[1:09:32] none of that mattered anymore in that
[1:09:34] moment all she cared about was there's a
[1:09:37] message coming to me from an angel and I
[1:09:39] want to listen to that message and I
[1:09:41] want to hold on to that message and he
[1:09:43] told her you're highly favored the Lord
[1:09:45] is with thee Oh What a message that we
[1:09:47] receive in this day a flicker of light a
[1:09:50] pillar of fire and a message that came
[1:09:53] out and said you are highly favored the
[1:09:57] world Fallen apart but you're favored
[1:09:59] the world's going down to hell but
[1:10:01] you're favored it's all in chaos oh but
[1:10:04] there's a people tonight that's found
[1:10:06] favor with God
[1:10:12] every end times had an awful condition
[1:10:14] every end time seemed like the world had
[1:10:16] gone completely insane
[1:10:18] but every end time also had something
[1:10:20] else
[1:10:21] a people who found favor with God
[1:10:25] Abraham found favor Noah found favor
[1:10:29] you have found favor listen just because
[1:10:32] the end times getting to where the
[1:10:34] world's getting more wicked and more
[1:10:35] wicked and we stand and we go oh it's
[1:10:37] getting bad it's getting worse it's
[1:10:39] getting worse don't fail to realize that
[1:10:41] if the world is in an in time condition
[1:10:43] there has to be a bride on the face of
[1:10:46] the Earth that has come to her position
[1:10:48] in the end time Rapture condition
[1:10:50] brother random said we're always talking
[1:10:53] about how Wicked the world is and we're
[1:10:55] failing to recognize how powerful the
[1:10:57] church is all the time
[1:10:59] oh it's wicked yes sir but there is a
[1:11:02] power in The Bride of Jesus Christ there
[1:11:04] is a restored word there is a living God

[1:13:48] wants to think for just a second
[1:13:50] the angel is about to ask Mary to
[1:13:52] believe something
[1:13:54] that seems impossible
[1:13:57] she has no
[1:13:58] examples to go off of
[1:14:01] she does have
[1:14:03] the scripture that says Behold a virgin
[1:14:05] shall conceive but she has no example of
[1:14:07] this ever coming to pass
[1:14:10] he's about to tell her that she's going
[1:14:12] to have a child even though she doesn't
[1:14:14] know a man
[1:14:15] and he tells her two things
[1:14:18] to raise her faith to a level that she
[1:14:20] can receive about what she's about to
[1:14:22] hear
[1:14:23] Thou Art highly favored

[1:14:36] downer I'm just speaking real you may be
[1:14:39] in the middle of it now
[1:14:42] but there's also great Miracles ahead
[1:14:45] there's also a Rapture and a body change
[1:14:47] of hand and he sent a message to elevate
[1:14:50] our faith to a place to receive that
[1:14:53] body change and what did he tell us Thou
[1:14:57] Art highly favored
[1:14:58] and I am with you
[1:15:00] listen he didn't just say he was here he
[1:15:03] proved he was here night after night
[1:15:05] time after time service after service he
[1:15:08] would challenge the devil and he proved
[1:15:10] there was a living God in our midst and
[1:15:12] I want to tell you that didn't end in
[1:15:13] 1965 but he's still here he's still
[1:15:16] proving it he's still moving he's still
[1:15:18] healing sick he's still bringing back
[1:15:20] Chronicles he's still saving the laws he
[1:15:23] is a living God and he's here tonight
[1:15:25] and he's reminding you I'm with you I'm
[1:15:28] with you in the fire I'm with you in the
[1:15:30] blood I'm with you in the sickness you
[1:15:33] have my favor
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:38] brother Branham says and we know he
[1:15:40] lives because he's with us and proves
[1:15:42] himself by physical signs and wonders
[1:15:44] that he promised that he would do to
[1:15:47] show it and so much as a pillar of fire
[1:15:49] that led the children of Israel through
[1:15:50] the Wilderness it's with us today even
[1:15:53] having its picture taken performing the
[1:15:55] signs and wonders that he promised it
[1:15:57] would do in this day seeing all the
[1:16:00] words that he promised being made
[1:16:01] manifest in this day
[1:16:04] well brother Aaron that was all for when
[1:16:06] the prophet was here okay
[1:16:09] he says and when he went away
[1:16:12] he said now the same thing that I've
[1:16:14] done you'll do also for I'll be with you
[1:16:17] always to the end of the world you'll do
[1:16:21] the same thing I've done until the end
[1:16:25] of the world
[1:16:28] listen I know sometimes it feels like
[1:16:30] it's all over but we're still here
[1:16:33] it has an officially ended yet so as
[1:16:36] long as we're still here he's still with
[1:16:38] us he's still moving he's still saving
[1:16:41] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:16:42] forever and that doesn't change until
[1:16:45] the end of the world
[1:16:47] you need healing he's the Healer tonight
[1:16:48] you need Deliverance he's the deliverer
[1:16:51] tonight you need salvation in your home
[1:16:53] he's the Savior tonight and he will be
[1:16:56] until the end of the world
[1:16:58] it's not time to dwell on the
[1:17:00] impossibilities
[1:17:01] it's not time to dwell on your failures
[1:17:04] and it's not time to question really me
[1:17:07] I'm So Unworthy I'm sure why me
[1:17:11] you know so many times he's standing
[1:17:13] there and he's offering it to you and
[1:17:14] he's right here saying take it take it
[1:17:16] and we're sitting there no no no I can't
[1:17:18] I'm not good enough I'm not listen we
[1:17:21] know
[1:17:23] you're not good enough
[1:17:26] get in line behind the rest of us
[1:17:28] unworthy people
[1:17:30] and you say I know I'm not good enough
[1:17:32] but I accept it I'll take it it's a free
[1:17:35] gift it's your favor it's your love it's
[1:17:38] your blessings I recognize my own
[1:17:40] worthiness but in accepting this I'm
[1:17:43] recognizing his worthiness he was worthy
[1:17:46] enough for my sin he was worthy enough
[1:17:48] to open the book he's worthy it's not
[1:17:52] about your worthiness it's about thou
[1:17:54] has found favor with God
[1:18:00] I'm sure Mary could have stood there for
[1:18:02] an hour explaining to the angel why she
[1:18:03] couldn't be the one
[1:18:06] but he's looking for people who will say
[1:18:07] be it unto me
[1:18:09] just be it unto me Lord I accept it I
[1:18:12] accepted why do we argue with God
[1:18:18] I just want to ask you
[1:18:20] if somebody showed up at your house
[1:18:22] tomorrow with 10 million dollars would
[1:18:24] you tell them you weren't worthy of it
[1:18:30] I you know I really didn't do anything
[1:18:31] to deserve this money
[1:18:35] I I really didn't earn it
[1:18:38] there's probably others who deserve this
[1:18:41] more than I do
[1:18:45] who asked you
[1:18:48] they just said here
[1:18:50] and there's where he's at tonight going
[1:18:51] you found favor do you accept it do you
[1:18:54] take the grace and mercy of almighty God
[1:18:55] do you accept that I send a message to
[1:18:58] call you but but what about the others I
[1:19:00] sent a message to call you you found my
[1:19:03] favor you found Grace do you accept it
[1:19:05] do you respond to it tonight and say be
[1:19:07] it unto me Lord Lord I accept it I'm
[1:19:09] unworthy but I accept it I accept the
[1:19:12] blood I accept the token I wanted to
[1:19:14] infiltrate my life I may not be
[1:19:16] deserving but you were worthy and I
[1:19:18] accept it tonight I'm not going to argue
[1:19:20] with you anymore I accept the favor of
[1:19:23] almighty God
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:27] he says Hail Mary blessed art thou among
[1:19:31] women thou has found favor with God
[1:19:34] brother Branham says oh Church hell
[1:19:36] blessed are you among the people for you
[1:19:39] found favor with God you've believed for
[1:19:42] eternal life and God's given you the
[1:19:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:47] [Applause]
[1:19:49] we just got to receive what he's trying
[1:19:51] to give us tonight
[1:19:52] if we're going to produce all that the
[1:19:54] word says that we're supposed to produce
[1:19:56] we must respond to God's favor the same
[1:19:59] way that Mary responded to it we got to
[1:20:02] move Beyond self-pity
[1:20:06] we got to move Beyond woe is me and step
[1:20:10] two be it unto me
[1:20:12] they sound similar but there's a we got
[1:20:14] too many woe as me people
[1:20:16] always down in the dump I call them
[1:20:18] eeyors
[1:20:20] I'm sorry I've seen Winnie the Pooh
[1:20:22] Eeyore nobody loves me
[1:20:25] it's a terrible day
[1:20:29] God probably doesn't care about me
[1:20:33] and they go through their whole life
[1:20:34] that way
[1:20:35] listen I think we need to be a little
[1:20:37] bit more like that tiger in there what's
[1:20:39] his name Tigger always bouncing around
[1:20:41] and full of joy and full of happiness
[1:20:43] because we recognize not woe is me but
[1:20:46] be it unto me there's joy in my step
[1:20:48] there's overcoming in my life I got
[1:20:50] reason to be happy you make it you can
[1:20:52] be sad all you want but I know I'm going
[1:20:55] to heaven I'm going in a Rapture I'm
[1:20:57] going in a body change I got a reason to
[1:20:59] be happy and full of mine it was a bad
[1:21:02] day at work but I'm saved it was a bad
[1:21:05] seed went out at home but I'm saved I'm
[1:21:08] going through a horrible trial but I
[1:21:10] have favor with God and I've got reason
[1:21:13] to Rejoice tonight
[1:21:15] Hallelujah his love is elective
[1:21:18] it doesn't mean you're not going to go
[1:21:20] through trials but his love is proven
[1:21:22] because he called you and he died for
[1:21:25] you and it secured an election tonight
[1:21:27] God loves you you have found favor with
[1:21:31] almighty God
[1:21:43] Hallelujah
[1:21:46] you know six months before this
[1:21:47] visitation to Mary Gabriel visited
[1:21:49] Zacharias at the temple
[1:21:53] Luke 1 and 5.
[1:21:56] he says there was in the days of Herod
[1:21:58] the King of Judea a certain priest named
[1:22:00] Zachariah
[1:22:02] of the course of ABIA and his wife was
[1:22:04] of the daughters of Aaron and her name
[1:22:06] was Elizabeth
[1:22:07] and they were both righteous before God
[1:22:09] walking in all the Commandments and
[1:22:11] ordinances of the Lord blameless
[1:22:15] and they had no child because that
[1:22:17] Elizabeth was Barren and they were both
[1:22:19] now well stricken in years now
[1:22:22] I want us to notice
[1:22:24] that their situation
[1:22:26] isn't near as impossible as Mary's
[1:22:29] situation
[1:22:30] because they have an example to look
[1:22:33] back to
[1:22:35] and if you look at Genesis 18 11 it
[1:22:38] almost describes the exact same
[1:22:39] situation
[1:22:41] now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[1:22:43] well-stricken in age and it ceased to be
[1:22:46] with Sarah after the manner of women
[1:22:51] see it's been done before
[1:22:53] there we are
[1:22:56] what are you facing tonight
[1:22:58] cancer it's been healed before
[1:23:01] depression has been delivered before
[1:23:03] [Applause]
[1:23:04] prodigal sons they've been saved before
[1:23:06] just look in the word it's been done
[1:23:08] before it's all been done before there's
[1:23:11] nothing that he has not conquered just
[1:23:13] look back and see if he did it before
[1:23:15] and he's the same yesterday today and
[1:23:16] forever he'll do it again for me tonight
[1:23:18] in my situation
[1:23:21] we skip down to verse 11 of Luke 1.
[1:23:25] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[1:23:27] the Lord standing on the right side of
[1:23:28] the altar of incense and when Zechariah
[1:23:31] saw him he was troubled and fear fell
[1:23:33] upon him
[1:23:34] but the angel said unto him now I figure
[1:23:38] this is a very friendly tone
[1:23:40] he's telling him not to be afraid so
[1:23:42] he's not being rough
[1:23:44] he says fear not Zechariah
[1:23:47] for thy prayer notice thy prayer
[1:23:51] is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall
[1:23:54] bear thee a son and thou shalt call his
[1:23:56] name John and thou shalt have joy and
[1:23:58] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[1:24:00] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[1:24:02] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:24:04] nor strong drink and he shall be filled
[1:24:06] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[1:24:07] mother's womb and many of the children
[1:24:09] of Israel shall he turn to the Lord
[1:24:11] their God and he shall go before him in
[1:24:13] the spirit and power of Elias to turn
[1:24:15] the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:24:16] children and the disobedient to the
[1:24:18] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[1:24:21] people
[1:24:22] prepared for the Lord
[1:24:24] now if you're not quite picking this up
[1:24:27] it's a pretty big deal
[1:24:30] that's pretty big deal
[1:24:32] this is a pretty awesome thing that's
[1:24:34] just happened
[1:24:36] listen Zacharias is about to shout he's
[1:24:39] about to declare the glories of God he's
[1:24:41] about to get loose in the spirit and run
[1:24:43] around testifying about the power of God
[1:24:45] I mean what a message to just come to
[1:24:47] him
[1:24:48] you've been praying for this child
[1:24:51] oh Zachariah your prayers have been
[1:24:53] heard and not only are y'all going to
[1:24:54] have a son but he's going to be great in
[1:24:57] the sight of the Lord many are going to
[1:24:59] turn to God because of him and he's
[1:25:00] going to be the Forerunner how
[1:25:02] incredible this is and you just expect a
[1:25:04] wonderful celebration of praise
[1:25:08] in verse 18 and Zechariah said unto the
[1:25:11] angel
[1:25:12] whereby shall I know this
[1:25:14] for I am an old man and my wife is well
[1:25:17] stricken in years
[1:25:25] are we are we expecting to receive the
[1:25:28] things we pray for or are we just
[1:25:29] praying
[1:25:32] are we actually looking for the
[1:25:34] Fulfillment of it can we accept it when
[1:25:37] the word says that you're healed
[1:25:40] can we accept it when the word says that
[1:25:42] the promise is unto you
[1:25:44] well I don't know there's so many
[1:25:48] do we even believe what we're praying
[1:25:49] for
[1:25:51] God the angel said this is your prayer
[1:25:53] I'm here because you asked
[1:25:56] and now you don't know if you can accept
[1:25:58] this or not
[1:26:03] one Bible scholar describes it like this
[1:26:06] he said this was not a humble petition
[1:26:08] for the confirming of his faith but a
[1:26:12] peevish objection against what was said
[1:26:14] to him as altogether incredible
[1:26:17] as if he would have said I can never be
[1:26:20] made to believe this
[1:26:24] I can never be made
[1:26:27] to believe this
[1:26:29] now we go to verse 19 and I I believe
[1:26:31] that the tone of the Angel changes a
[1:26:33] little bit
[1:26:34] I don't think we're in Friendly tones
[1:26:36] anymore
[1:26:37] and the angel answering unto him said I
[1:26:40] am Gabriel that stand in the presence of
[1:26:42] God and am sent to speak unto thee and
[1:26:45] to show thee these Glad Tidings and
[1:26:47] behold Thou shalt be dumb and not able
[1:26:50] to speak until the day that these things
[1:26:52] shall be performed because thou
[1:26:53] believeth not my words which shall be
[1:26:56] fulfilled in their season
[1:26:59] listen because of this doubt God said
[1:27:01] strike him dumb because I got a little
[1:27:04] virgin down there that I'm about to
[1:27:05] visit and I don't need you spreading
[1:27:07] your doubt and your unbelief and your
[1:27:10] fears and your worry because I got a
[1:27:12] little virgin down there that's going to
[1:27:14] say being unto me I think it's time that
[1:27:16] the mouth of the unbeliever just gets
[1:27:18] shut up quit spreading your doubt in
[1:27:21] your worry and your fear and your
[1:27:22] negative confession and just say yes I
[1:27:25] don't know how it's gonna happen but yes
[1:27:27] Lord it's gonna happen there will be a
[1:27:29] pride there will be a Rapture that will
[1:27:32] be a church without spot a wrinkle yes
[1:27:34] yes yes yes yes yes
[1:27:37] so he has his mouth shut up
[1:27:40] so that the unbelief can't be spread
[1:27:44] now I want you to notice something
[1:27:48] back in verse 34.
[1:27:51] this is different what he said
[1:27:55] from Mary asking
[1:27:57] how will this be if we look back in
[1:28:00] verse 34.
[1:28:02] because I I gotta be honest with you
[1:28:04] I'm an open book sometimes it's too open
[1:28:08] but I know where brother Brandon said
[1:28:09] Mary never ask a question
[1:28:12] she never doubted
[1:28:15] he said she she never doubted she never
[1:28:18] questioned
[1:28:19] but then I see and I read the verse and
[1:28:21] it says
[1:28:22] how shall this be and I'm like
[1:28:26] I don't know it's just there is a
[1:28:28] question mark there that's all I'm
[1:28:29] saying
[1:28:30] I'm just saying I see a question mark
[1:28:33] it looks like a question
[1:28:36] but as you begin to read into it and
[1:28:38] study it and break it down
[1:28:40] it's simply
[1:28:42] her saying okay
[1:28:44] the Messiah is to be virgin born
[1:28:47] and I'm going to be that virgin
[1:28:49] will you share with me how you're going
[1:28:51] to do it
[1:28:54] in other words it's actually her just
[1:28:56] asking for more instruction
[1:28:58] if you get into it it's actually no
[1:29:00] different than the preacher up here and
[1:29:02] he begins to preach and he gets under
[1:29:04] the anointing and you like what you're
[1:29:05] hearing so you're on the edge of your
[1:29:07] seat and you're going amen tell me a
[1:29:09] little bit more tell me a little bit
[1:29:10] more about this Rapture tell me a little
[1:29:12] bit more about this body change tell me
[1:29:14] a little bit more about this message I
[1:29:16] believe it I just want to hear a little
[1:29:18] bit more and she's not saying how's this
[1:29:21] going to be she's saying tell me more
[1:29:23] about it tell me about Isaac I want to
[1:29:26] know about my bridegroom tell me about
[1:29:28] heaven tell me about the Pearly Gates
[1:29:30] tell me about justification tell me
[1:29:33] about the Holy Ghost
[1:29:35] she's just wanting to hear more
[1:29:39] she's just wanting to hear more tell me
[1:29:41] more
[1:29:43] and what's wonderful about it is the
[1:29:45] answer that Gabriel gives her fully
[1:29:47] satisfies her he says in verse 35 and
[1:29:50] the angel answered and said unto her
[1:29:52] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:29:55] the power of the highest shall
[1:29:57] overshadow thee therefore also that Holy
[1:30:00] thing that which shall be born of Thee
[1:30:02] he shall be shall be called
[1:30:05] the son of God
[1:30:06] and once she's told that it's going to
[1:30:08] be done by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:10] that's suffices
[1:30:12] she says be it unto me oh I know the
[1:30:15] Holy Ghost can change my situation
[1:30:16] tonight I know the Holy Ghost can move
[1:30:19] in my home yes just be it home to me I
[1:30:21] know he can change me he'll ranked
[1:30:23] sinner I know he can give me the Holy
[1:30:24] Ghost I know he can bring my children
[1:30:26] back I know he could just be it unto me
[1:30:28] Lord oh how's this going to happen the
[1:30:30] power of the Holy Ghost Okay I accept it
[1:30:32] be it unto me I don't know how I'm gonna
[1:30:34] do it the power of the Holy Ghost okay
[1:30:36] be it unto me how am I ever gonna make
[1:30:39] it because you have a promise you have
[1:30:41] his favor and it's going to be done by
[1:30:43] the power of the Holy Ghost okay Lord I
[1:30:47] accept it be it unto me Lord Jesus just
[1:30:50] be it unto me Hallelujah
[1:30:54] if we can just take that recipe tonight
[1:30:57] that you got a promise
[1:30:59] you got his favor
[1:31:01] and it's going to be done by the power
[1:31:02] of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:04] there's nothing
[1:31:06] there's nothing
[1:31:08] that you can't overcome
[1:31:10] listen there
[1:31:13] I'm not Gabriel
[1:31:16] and I didn't step out of the pillar of
[1:31:17] fire tonight right here before your eyes
[1:31:20] but God did lay it on my heart to bring
[1:31:22] a message to you
[1:31:23] and tell you
[1:31:25] thou Hast found favor with God
[1:31:28] thou Hast found favor with God and God
[1:31:31] is with thee every step of the way and
[1:31:33] the way you're going to make it is
[1:31:34] through the power of the Holy Ghost the
[1:31:36] way you're going to overcome is the
[1:31:38] power of the Holy Ghost the way we're
[1:31:39] going to Rapture the way we're going to
[1:31:41] be healed the way we're going to be
[1:31:43] delivered the way your child's coming
[1:31:44] home the way it's all going to wrap up
[1:31:46] in absolute perfection how by the power
[1:31:49] of the Holy Ghost thou has found favor
[1:31:52] with almighty God tonight how are you
[1:31:55] going to respond to it how are you going
[1:31:57] to respond to it is there anybody here

[1:32:01] unto me Lord Jesus I accept your favor I
[1:32:05] accept your forgiveness I accept all

[1:32:43] healing is here
[1:32:45] you've been praying for deliverance and
[1:32:46] deliverance is here
[1:32:48] you've been seeking the baptism of the
[1:32:50] Holy Ghost and he's here to give it to
[1:32:51] you
[1:32:52] you've been asking for the impossible
[1:32:57] then he says watch me do it
[1:33:00] and once you recognize that you have
[1:33:02] favor
[1:33:03] no trial matters
[1:33:05] no hardship listen you don't think that
[1:33:08] Mary knew in her mind
[1:33:10] the hardship she was about to go through
[1:33:12] and she went around telling people I'm
[1:33:13] pregnant but she knew
[1:33:15] the mocking and the ridicule they're
[1:33:18] going to want to Stone me
[1:33:20] they're going to want to kill me for
[1:33:21] they're going to do this and they're
[1:33:23] going to think that I'm going to be an
[1:33:24] outcast the rest of my life
[1:33:26] and she weighed that
[1:33:28] up against his favor
[1:33:31] and she said be it unto me I'll take
[1:33:34] whatever the world wants to throw at me
[1:33:35] I'll be ridiculed I'll be outcast but
[1:33:38] Lord Jesus just let me have your favor
[1:33:40] just let me know that you're with me
[1:33:42] wherever I go just let me know that the
[1:33:44] power of the Holy Ghost is walking
[1:33:46] before me is that does that mean we
[1:33:48] won't have trials does that mean no he
[1:33:50] doesn't mean that
[1:33:51] it just means that you have his favor
[1:33:52] and he's right there with you and he's
[1:33:55] going to see you through to the other
[1:33:56] side
[1:33:57] listen I know life hurts
[1:33:59] I know there's scars and there's
[1:34:01] heartaches and there's wounds and
[1:34:03] there's real things and he comes and the
[1:34:05] devil tries to bury you under all those
[1:34:06] things and begin to tell you you're
[1:34:08] going through this because you messed up
[1:34:10] you're going through this because God
[1:34:13] doesn't love you anymore and brother
[1:34:14] Branham comes and he says that the
[1:34:16] cloudy skies and the storms of life are
[1:34:18] no sign of God's disapproval
[1:34:21] job never lost God's approval as a
[1:34:24] matter of fact job had God's favor in
[1:34:27] his life and brother Branham goes on to
[1:34:29] say that when you go through a trial and
[1:34:30] you go through a hardship it proves that
[1:34:32] you found favor with God because he
[1:34:34] chose you to beat this devil he chose
[1:34:37] you to win this trial and I want to tell
[1:34:39] you tonight the trial that you're in was
[1:34:41] not sent that it might rule over your
[1:34:43] life but you were said that you might
[1:34:45] rule over that trial you were said that
[1:34:47] you could so he's the same yesterday
[1:34:48] today and forever that God's A Healer
[1:34:50] that goes to deliver that God's a savior
[1:34:53] that trial in your life is manifesting
[1:34:55] the very works of Christ once again in
[1:34:58] the closing moments of time
[1:35:01] within time conditions all around us God
[1:35:04] says
[1:35:05] hell Church
[1:35:07] thou Hast found favor with God God bless
[1:35:10] you tonight we love you in the love of
[1:35:12] the Lord
[1:35:13] [Applause]
[1:35:38] Hallelujah
[1:35:40] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:35:43] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:35:46] the power of the highest shall
[1:35:48] overshadow thee
[1:35:51] therefore also that Holy thing which
[1:35:53] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:35:56] Son of God
[1:35:58] the prophet goes on to say that anybody
[1:36:00] knows the body of God is not yet
[1:36:02] finished
[1:36:05] but it's being finished as it's being
[1:36:07] born in US
[1:36:09] the word of this day
[1:36:11] wants to be born
[1:36:13] In You and I
[1:36:16] so we've been told that we've found a
[1:36:18] favor
[1:36:19] now he's waiting on our response
[1:36:22] so what will be our response
[1:36:25] we found favor in his eyes
[1:36:27] were loved
[1:36:28] he thought of us before the foundation
[1:36:30] of the world
[1:36:32] when there was no stars there was no
[1:36:34] atoms no molecules were light
[1:36:37] but he thought of you
[1:36:40] and he wants you to know that he loves
[1:36:42] you
[1:36:43] so what's your response going to be
[1:36:47] well I'll I'll have to think about it I
[1:36:49] mean I don't know if I could be able to
[1:36:52] but
[1:36:54] that's not Mary's response be it unto me
[1:36:58] according to that word
[1:37:01] be it unto me
[1:37:03] and he believes he is the same do we or
[1:37:06] not do we believe he's the same
[1:37:08] we saw him right here Sunday perform
[1:37:10] several healings
[1:37:12] and you only saw part of it you see part
[1:37:14] of it kept on going on back in the
[1:37:17] office after church
[1:37:19] it kept on going
[1:37:21] God was moving for more back there
[1:37:23] preachers
[1:37:25] as a matter of fact the Lord touched
[1:37:27] brother Joel back there the Lord touched
[1:37:29] by the Chisholm back there
[1:37:33] Hallelujah
[1:37:39] there was a sister here from Brother
[1:37:41] Jules Church
[1:37:43] and whenever she heard me
[1:37:45] referred to Brother Brad Gilbert getting
[1:37:47] his eyes healed Sunday a week ago
[1:37:50] she heard that and instantly the Lord
[1:37:54] touched her eyes and healed and then
[1:37:57] be it unto me Lord
[1:38:00] according to Thy Word
[1:38:05] now you know preachers came to that
[1:38:09] all I said was Lord Heal sugar diabetes
[1:38:12] okay I'll say it again Lord your sugar
[1:38:14] diabetes Lord Heal sugar diabetes
[1:38:19] it won't do any good just for me to
[1:38:21] repeat those words
[1:38:22] but it's when we take him at his word
[1:38:25] and then that something connects with us
[1:38:27] as an individual and God drops it in
[1:38:30] your heart
[1:38:31] how many has a need to know
[1:38:35] Hallelujah
[1:38:38] maybe you've got a circumstance or an
[1:38:40] event that you can't find a scripture
[1:38:41] for or quote for
[1:38:44] don't worry God still got you covered
[1:38:48] as our brothers so beautifully said Mary
[1:38:50] didn't have any example to be able to
[1:38:52] refer to
[1:38:54] she believed it
[1:38:55] the woman with issue of blood
[1:38:58] she had no reference that she could
[1:39:00] point back to now God can do this
[1:39:02] because he did it forward
[1:39:04] had never done it no record of it but
[1:39:08] somehow she believed it how is that
[1:39:10] possible since she didn't have any
[1:39:12] Scripture to base it on
[1:39:14] how is that possible that she didn't
[1:39:15] have any history to base it on
[1:39:18] but she had a need the sorrow Phoenician
[1:39:21] Woman Jesus called her a dog treated her
[1:39:24] mad talked to her racial terms racial
[1:39:28] slurs
[1:39:29] or to be categorized today
[1:39:31] but she had the kind of faith that Jesus
[1:39:34] himself couldn't even run her off
[1:39:37] I believe that's the way the bride is
[1:39:41] people saying that Old Devil oh they
[1:39:43] want that old devil and people talk
[1:39:45] about me at the church and people you
[1:39:47] mean that's as close to God as you are
[1:39:49] you'll let people knock you out you'll
[1:39:52] let the devil knock you out you're
[1:39:54] really going to be hurting when you meet
[1:39:55] God
[1:39:58] Jacob didn't meet the devil on the bank
[1:40:01] Jacob didn't meet a fallen angel
[1:40:03] he met almighty God and almighty God was
[1:40:06] trying to wrestle him out of getting
[1:40:07] what he wanted he said I'm telling you
[1:40:09] God I'm going to hurt you I'm going to
[1:40:11] hurt you I'm here to be changed I need
[1:40:14] help I'm tired of being Jacob I'm here
[1:40:16] to be changed
[1:40:19] that's the kind of faith
[1:40:24] praise the Lord
[1:40:26] it's about our heads right now let's
[1:40:28] let's hold our needs our desires our
[1:40:30] requests not only here in the visible
[1:40:32] audience but those of you that are home
[1:40:34] streaming Wherever You Are
[1:40:38] Heavenly Father we believe what
[1:40:41] you have laid upon our brother's heart
[1:40:43] for us tonight
[1:40:46] I believe that you gave him this for us
[1:40:49] a sermon that was made especially for
[1:40:52] Word of Life Church
[1:40:55] to tell us that we found favor in your
[1:40:58] eyes
[1:41:00] what else could we ask for that would be
[1:41:03] any greater
[1:41:05] to know that we have found favor in your
[1:41:07] eyes and your presence as you're with us
[1:41:10] to bring to pass the purpose
[1:41:14] of that favor
[1:41:16] Mary found favor
[1:41:18] but for a reason
[1:41:20] so it wasn't like she just found favor
[1:41:22] and oh okay well okay I found favor in
[1:41:24] his eyes she found favor to fulfill
[1:41:29] we believe we have found favor
[1:41:32] to Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:41:35] to fulfill the words spoken of us Lord
[1:41:39] your Prophet tells us the same word that
[1:41:43] spoke of the groom also speaks of the
[1:41:46] Bride
[1:41:47] Lord God you say our desires
[1:41:50] you see our reasons for being here on
[1:41:52] the earth is to serve you
[1:41:55] we're not here to build a kingdom we're
[1:41:57] not here father that people might look
[1:41:59] at us and think that we are something
[1:42:03] Lord Mary's name has been heralded for
[1:42:06] thousands of years because she submitted
[1:42:09] to the charge of the angel
[1:42:12] but Mary was herself nothing nobody
[1:42:16] yet Lord God she found favor in your
[1:42:19] eyes so we've already established that
[1:42:20] our brother's done a beautiful job with
[1:42:22] it tonight so why should we spend the
[1:42:24] rest of the time trying to re-establish
[1:42:27] we don't deserve it in the first place
[1:42:29] we say that right up front
[1:42:32] but you have called us Lord
[1:42:34] so it's not our worthiness it's yours
[1:42:38] now as we pray together
[1:42:41] I'm asking you in the name of Jesus
[1:42:44] you'd pass by this way to my father
