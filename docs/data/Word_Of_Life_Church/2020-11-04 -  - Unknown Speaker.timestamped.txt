[0:00] you know we have so many choices in life
[0:03] to make
[0:04] the prophet said it this way in choosing
[0:06] of a bride he said there's another
[0:08] choice that we have in life
[0:10] and that's a life's companion a young
[0:12] man or a young woman stepping out
[0:14] and life has been given a right to make
[0:16] a choice
[0:18] the young man chooses and the woman has
[0:20] a right
[0:21] to accept or reject but it's still
[0:25] a choice on both sides
[0:28] both the man and the woman they have a
[0:31] right
[0:31] to a choice now it's very hard for me
[0:34] dealing with this because
[0:36] we got people sitting here people get
[0:38] the videos and people get the tapes
[0:39] who made the wrong choices in life when
[0:42] it comes to companion and i realize
[0:44] every time i deal with it always makes
[0:46] some nervous some jittery
[0:47] some always get their feelings hurt at
[0:49] me but friend i've got to preach the
[0:51] word of god
[0:53] i've got to say it if it's my brother my
[0:55] sister my wife my mother and don't make
[0:57] no difference
[0:58] i cannot cut no corner i've got to
[1:00] declare the word of god in the right
[1:02] attitude the right spirit
[1:04] and let you know that god by his grace
[1:07] surely every one of us has made so many
[1:10] wrong choices in life
[1:11] but the only way we can ever come to
[1:13] grips and peace with those
[1:15] wrong decisions is to not blame god
[1:18] but accept the responsibility ourselves
[1:21] and say
[1:22] lord help me to live with the
[1:24] consequences of my wrong choice
[1:28] he said a man in his right mind that's
[1:30] planning a future
[1:32] should choose that wife very carefully
[1:34] be careful what you're doing in a woman
[1:36] choosing a husband or accepting the
[1:38] choice of a husband
[1:40] should be real careful what she's doing
[1:42] especially in these days
[1:44] a man should think and pray before he
[1:47] chooses
[1:48] a wife and yet
[1:52] as many of us here today who didn't do
[1:54] that
[1:56] now many of you were lost you wasn't
[1:58] serving god
[1:59] i'm not using some denominator church
[2:01] and they never taught you these things
[2:03] but some of you done it after you come
[2:04] to the truth why
[2:07] because you didn't wait you didn't wait
[2:09] on god
[2:10] to get that real choice god help me
[2:14] you see when god placed you on this
[2:16] earth you men
[2:17] god ordains you to have a certain
[2:20] companion
[2:21] that companion come down to the stream
[2:24] of time
[2:24] she was not born in another age oh no
[2:27] she was not born in luther's age and you
[2:29] born here
[2:30] but she was born in your age and your
[2:33] time frame
[2:34] and if you will wait on god you will
[2:37] connect one day
[2:39] but it is satan's way to get you messed
[2:42] up
[2:46] and get you to blame god
[2:51] for your choice for your choice
[2:55] a man should pray earnestly for he could
[2:59] ruin
[3:00] his entire life how does that mean that
[3:04] people who have
[3:05] been messed up in the marriage that mean
[3:06] they're lost no does that mean they'll
[3:09] not be in heaven
[3:09] no does that mean they're not sons or
[3:11] daughters of god no
[3:13] but it only means by making the wrong
[3:16] choice in life
[3:17] they can have hell on this earth god
[3:20] wanted them to have this companion here
[3:22] that he ordained for them because of
[3:24] their nature be complemented to their
[3:25] nature
[3:26] and if they don't wait on god and they
[3:28] get the wrong woman
[3:30] and they'll fuss and bicker and argue
[3:32] back and forth
[3:33] their entire marriage it'll never be
[3:35] what god wanted
[3:36] god wanted them to get the right one to
[3:39] raise
[3:39] children to love one another to have
[3:42] godliness in their home
[3:43] they wind up with this sister instead of
[3:45] the ordained one now they both will go
[3:47] to heaven if they love the lord and born
[3:49] again
[3:49] but once they cross over the veil you'll
[3:52] get the right one you should have had
[3:54] here
[3:56] now whose choice was that the choice was
[3:59] you get the right one now but your
[4:02] choice
[4:02] give you the wrong one
[4:07] now god cannot say i ordain this man and
[4:10] this and this man this woman this man
[4:11] this woman this man this woman this man
[4:13] this woman and then when you get down
[4:15] your
[4:15] life then god say i'm going to go
[4:17] contrary to what i've already ordained
[4:19] my own will and i'm going to
[4:20] predestinate this man marry this woman
[4:21] just for confusion
[4:23] just be mean to it
[4:26] choices we make
[4:29] don't blame god god's choice has already
[4:32] been declared and god's choice is his
[4:34] word
[4:34] and when something goes wrong check your
[4:36] choice by god's
[4:38] and see if it lines up come on church
[4:40] now watch he said a man could ruin his
[4:42] life
[4:43] remember the vow is until death do we
[4:47] part
[4:48] and a man could ruin his life by making
[4:50] the wrong choice
[4:51] and if he knows it and he knows he's
[4:54] making the wrong choice and marry's a
[4:55] woman that's not fit to be his wife and
[4:57] does it anyhow
[4:58] then it's his fault and if the woman
[5:00] takes a husband and no it's not fit to
[5:02] be a husband
[5:03] then it's your own fault after you know
[5:05] what's right and wrong
[5:07] how many of you said and you have known
[5:08] truth been raised in the message
[5:10] get away from the lord backside and go
[5:12] out there marry some man
[5:13] and then you find out your life is
[5:15] nothing but hell on her you mean to tell
[5:17] me
[5:17] god puts a woman through that nonsense
[5:21] we do it our choice
[5:24] in life choices why because you're a
[5:28] free moral agent
[5:29] oh my brother donny if god ordained for
[5:31] me to have it why don't god just
[5:32] override me
[5:33] why don't god override my will why don't
[5:35] god because god's program is not set up
[5:38] that way
[5:39] if god would override your will then god
[5:41] would be a task master
[5:43] god wants you to be healed how come this
[5:45] folks you're sick if god's going to
[5:47] override your will on that why don't he
[5:49] override him on joy on peace the right
[5:51] woman
[5:52] this this this this but you are a mortal
[5:55] and those choices are put before you
[6:00] oh children
[6:03] question answers look at this my
[6:05] brethren do you
[6:06] know many times we get the wrong mate
[6:11] here on earth
[6:15] now wait a minute we get the wrong one
[6:19] now you see some people get the wrong
[6:21] one but they never get divorced
[6:23] they just live together all their life
[6:25] but they have nothing but trouble
[6:26] well some will get the wrong one but
[6:28] there's escalation accepts trouble
[6:30] they'll get divorced now them kind of
[6:32] people are the ones that are
[6:34] more looked down because their choice is
[6:36] visible
[6:37] it's more visible oh sure their marriage
[6:38] didn't work out well everybody can tell
[6:39] they've got a divorce or you made the
[6:41] wrong one but there may be other people
[6:43] that are sitting there that made just as
[6:45] bad of a choice
[6:46] but because theirs doesn't escalate to a
[6:48] divorce there's this more hid behind
[6:50] they're still together
[6:52] but you see it'll never be what god
[6:55] ordained
[6:55] to me i cannot believe that god ordained
[6:58] marriages to be fussing
[7:00] and fighting and squabbling i cannot
[7:02] believe that god made the woman
[7:04] amen not to love her husband or the
[7:06] husband to love his wife
[7:08] out of the donny even as christ loved
[7:11] the church
[7:15] but i could preach that every night for
[7:17] 15 years in a row
[7:19] and some of you could never attain to it
[7:21] you know why because you got the wrong
[7:23] one
[7:29] choices we make
[7:34] now what do we have to do we can't blame
[7:36] god god's give you as he did israel
[7:38] when you go in the inhabitants drive out
[7:40] all the inhabitants of the land but
[7:42] benjamin chose not to do it manasseh
[7:45] chose not to do it ephraim chose not to
[7:48] do it even as you
[7:49] chose
[7:54] i know this is hard friends but i've got
[7:55] to tell you the truth
[7:58] many times you get the wrong mate in the
[8:01] earth
[8:02] now what is god's will what was god's
[8:04] choice
[8:05] that every son of god get the right mate
[8:12] right now once some pretty pair of brown
[8:16] eyes
[8:17] or gray eyes vamps you into a place
[8:21] that you shouldn't have listened but let
[8:24] me say this
[8:26] you might have the wrong companion if
[8:28] you got the wrong companion in this
[8:31] life you'll never have it
[8:34] on the other side so it proves to me
[8:37] sons of god can have the wrong one here
[8:40] and still be sons now he didn't say if
[8:42] you get the wrong one here you won't be
[8:44] there
[8:44] but he said if you get the wrong one
[8:46] here now that decision does not change
[8:48] your eternal destination
[8:50] hey man aren't you god if you
[8:54] make the wrong choice that does not god
[8:57] say all right that's it boy
[8:58] i had this woman for you and you married
[9:00] somebody else that proves you're not a
[9:02] son of god no
[9:04] and listen friends many of you may have
[9:06] married this woman than sin and that
[9:07] woman and whatever it was
[9:08] and when you come to church and come to
[9:11] the truth you finally found the right
[9:13] one
[9:13] that was all those marriage and divorce
[9:15] marriage and divorce was that the will
[9:17] of god
[9:18] no had you sought god you would have
[9:21] found this right sister anyhow
[9:24] amen but it's choices
[9:28] that we make not god
[9:34] not god and while i'm here let me say it
[9:37] real plain
[9:39] god's perfect and original will even in
[9:42] time
[9:43] under the sex law you young men listen
[9:45] to me
[9:47] god's will is not for you to marry some
[9:48] young girl in this church or some other
[9:50] church
[9:50] and then if that don't work out divorce
[9:52] her and get you another one and divorce
[9:54] her and get you another just keep on
[9:55] going do you find this right
[9:57] 47 times down the road that is not god's
[10:00] way
[10:00] god only gave us divorce because of the
[10:03] hardness of people's hearts
[10:05] god's way is pray and wait
[10:08] i don't care how long they've been
[10:10] married that divorce thing haunts people
[10:12] all of their lives
[10:15] every time a preacher mentions it
[10:16] something swells up in other oh god
[10:19] god's way is not that god's way is pray
[10:23] pray pray make the right choice
