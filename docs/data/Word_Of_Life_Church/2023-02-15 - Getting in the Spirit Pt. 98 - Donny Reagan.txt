other times it just makes you mad you just want to take it off and throw it away somewhere just got to keep patient with these guys let's give them a hand up our thank you guys we just have to be patient with them don't we certainly appreciate all the effort that they've put forth in doing all this and all the work and also we finally get it I'm just hoping that we get it three days before the Rapture released so we can say well we had three good services let's turn tonight if you would to the book of Zechariah Chapter 6 verse 9. I know we've been having a lot of people asking about our dedication services and what dates that we're going to do it and I threw out middle of May and I had threw back at me this is going to be gone nothing's going to be gone nothing's going to be gone so I'm gonna throw some more out at you tonight um I've been wanting to have a special meeting Ever every year anyway so I'm thinking that we will have it the last the last day of June and first and second day of July for dedications that'd be Friday Saturday and Sunday that should give everybody plenty enough time to make plans we've got people from Canada people from Europe people from France people from all over the United States that's wanting to come if it works out where they can so maybe that'll give everybody enough time to where they can make plans to come and of course all the local folks are cordially invited y'all please come too amen Zechariah Chapter 6 verse 9. and the word of the Lord came unto me saying take of them of the Captivity even of held AI of tobaja and Jedi which are come from Babylon and Come Thou the same day and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah then take silver and gold and make crowns and set upon the head of Joshua now listen what he's going to do said on the head of Joshua the son of Jose deck the high priest and speak unto him saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the Temple of the Lord now what A peculiar setting that this is so the rebuilding the temple they've got just a remnant of people from Babylon some from Persia some from different parts and they're Gathering Together and God tells this Prophet to go in and take silver and gold and to make a crown and sat on the head of Joshua that this of course not the Joshua that was in Moses day and then when he does that he gives this Prophecy of the Lord Jesus and you think why in the world would God have Blended them to together now notice what he says speak unto him saying thus speak of the Lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch so I wonder what some of these modern folks that want to criticize prophets over saying this and that and the other and they don't understand them I wonder what they'd said about Zachariah whenever Zechariah says this actually to Joshua and he says behold the man whose name is the branch and that probably the critics of that David said well is that him or is that Jedediah or who's even talking about I believe that man it's a false prophet I don't think what he said come to pass but you see we live on this side of the Fulfillment of him saying it to us it makes better sense does it not but can you imagine living in that day and you're a message follower as we would say and you believe God sent this prophet and you hear this prophecy you're probably like the rest of them you didn't understand it either so you think what did the man mean was he calling Joshua the branch was he calling Jedediah what was the man saying but then you go on and you say he couldn't have been talking about Joshua but the Lord tells him speak unto him thus speaketh the Lord of hosts behold the man whose name is the branch he shall grow out of his place he shall build the Temple of the Lord but the thing of it is Joshua is a high priest zerubbabel is the one building this Temple so the critics would have said that man don't even know what he's talking about this man's not even building the Temple well he wasn't talking about that man but God veiled it in such a way and that Gem of Prophecy laid there for hundreds of years I'd say the devil didn't even know who it was notice verse 13. even he shall build the Temple of the Lord and he shall bear the glory and he shall set and Rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne which was never allowed and the whole time of the Kingdom of Israel only one man tried to do that and we remember he was stricken with Leprosy but God is going to merge both offices King and priest into one and they probably thought this guy's a false prophet while this man never was a king he never was a mixture of that I hope we don't do the same thing in our day he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of Peace shall be between them boasts so the office of king and the office of priests will merge together and whoever this man is and there will be reconciliation and peace in both of these offices I mean a lot to be remembered tonight as we pray I'd like to remember Carol tonight she's not feeling well she's at home sick also my daughter listed sick and Lance had some dental work extensive dental work done today so he's not feeling very well also brother Dan Dyer is Maiden made in prayer who else would you hand up before the Lord God bless you can we just take these requests before the Lord Heavenly Father we are so blessed and not to be once again in this place that you have given us we thank you for Jesus we thank you Lord that we not only have a nice place to be able to come and worship but what makes it so wonderful is that you are here it wouldn't make any difference how nice it was how pretty it was how clean it was how brand new it was if you don't show up then we sort of want to be here but we know as long as you are here that's what makes it Church so father we bring our needs our requests our desires before you you've told us that we could approach the throne of grace through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus and we believe that our prayers will be answered according to the will of God and they will be accepted through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ so we bring the needs that I have mentioned also Father of the hands of the people that were uplifted no doubt people sitting at home people streaming the service we pray that you'll be mindful of them as well I ask your father that you would help me tonight help me to get out of the way Lord God hold my mouse to anything that would displease you may I be so surrendered to the holy ghost that you can speak through me to your children to minister to their needs and we'll give you the praise for it all in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask him and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated I've been said in Prophecy for the most of my life whenever I was a Pentecostal preacher the only book that I read was the Bible so I committed a lot of the Bible to memory so I could quote it quoted it and quoted it whenever I'd stand and preach what little bit of understanding that I had that's what I quoted I didn't quote Malachi 4 I didn't quote Charles Spurgeon I didn't quote Webster I quoted the Bible but as much as I loved it and as much as I quoted it I was blind to much of the truth that I was quoting and one day God helped me to realize that there was more to his word than just being able to quote it that's the intellectual part so someone who has a mind and a pretty good memory would be able to commit a lot of it to memory and be able to quote it and do their entire life spending it that way and actually never understand very much about it at all so we realize that God has chosen a way that he would make his way known I mean part of the keys to that is Amos 3 7 surely the Lord God will do nothing except he Reveals His secrets to his servants the prophets so we can see here now God is working in a twofold way in the ministry of Zechariah now Zechariah was one of the restoration prophets because they went down into Babylon there for 70 years and God had told them under the minister of Jeremiah that they would come back and we know that Nehemiah the cut Bearer he began to get a burden for the people of God remember Nehemiah was not a priest Nehemiah was not a prophet but he was going to be a governor so God needed these different administrations to go back to the land of Israel now Ezra had already went ahead of him several years and he's there as the foundation part Ezra being a priest so the priesthood is going to be essential the law givers are going to be essential but they also need a governor so the governor is going to be Nehemiah Nehemiah fulfills a great position in the work of God going on but here is Zechariah which is one of the restoration prophets also during the same time frame close to the time same time frame of Malachi and also Micah these brothers these men are called Minor Prophets of the Old Testament and yet because of that because her book is quite short but God had a lot to say under the ministry of some of these great men and Zechariah was one of those that was able to write of the Messianic prophecies of the first coming of the Lord Jesus and also of the Millennium coming so here God merges this together as I mentioned single last Wednesday night that God is actually dealing with currently what's going on so they're rebuilding the temple they're restoring the wall they went through that several years ago in the book of Nehemiah and now they're coming up to part of the crowning part so what they're doing God Is prophesying by words but God is also prophesying by symbols now prophecy isn't always like this thus saith the Lord tomorrow there will be an earthquake that will come down through Johnson City it'll be a 7.5 all of you that live near the Carter County Line stay away from that now that's prophecy but yet there's also Prophecy in the Old Testament that God would have someone like David that would get in the spirit of Prophecy and he began to prophesy in Psalms 21 22 brother verse 1 my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me all my bones they stare at me and he goes on and on and your David is actually in the passion of that prophecy but yet we don't have it written by the rest of the prophets acted quite that way but yet it was still prophecy then we have Joseph that never said thus saith the Lord one time not one time but in Joseph's life was written types of Prophecy so Joseph never said I am a type of the Lord Jesus so I'm going to marry a gentile wife I am a type of the Lord Jesus so my brothers will sell me I am a type of the Lord Jesus so my brothers will despise me because I'm spiritual he never one time said that but yet his prophecy was him acting out the very Life of Christ itself you see it was Christ hid in Joseph it was Christ hid in Abraham it was Christ's head and many of the lives of the prophets now what we see here is Christ again hid in a symbol of God telling this Prophet to go down and take silver and gold and to make a crown and set it on the head of Joshua but in reality Joshua is not going to be the king of Jerusalem but yet it is a symbol now I want you to look when you look at this and you realize that God is actually having him to make a crown for a prophetic Carpenter now before he ever tells of the prophecy of the role of the carpenter he makes the crown in type and sets it on Joshua's head and the people are probably pondering and wondering and thinking what in the world is he doing this man is not a king he's not even the genealogy of a king how come he's calling him a king but God is having him to act out the prophecy in another well I'm totally convinced about this then that we ourselves can be a part of a prophetic vision and yet we live our life every day we walk on the earth we love our wives our children we live our lives we do what we're supposed to do and we don't even realize what we are doing as it was with brother miscal many many years ago whenever he was going to be a part of the vision and he didn't even know it his wife didn't even know that he's just supposed to put a green checkered shirt inside of his bag he didn't even know he had one until he fell in the water and went to change his shirt and he pulled it out and whenever he walked out there he was with a green checking shirt a part of the vision but not studying to be apart a part of the vision but not trying to be apart just doing what they were hunting they were not even on a 40-day fast they were not even you know on a Shabbat before the presence of God and seeking God day and not they were hunting they were just having a good time together as brothers and Little did he know he was fixing to move into a part of the vision now many of us more than likely will never see many Visions in our life maybe some of you have I've seen a few in my life but for the most part most of us will never see a vision and yet many people will tend to look at that and say well I'm not spiritual because I don't have many dreams and I'm not spiritual because I don't have many Visions well you know just because a man does have visions doesn't necessarily mean that he's more spiritual than those who don't have him it just simply means God calls that man to be able to do that but whether or not you see a vision you can actually be a part of one now myself I would rather be a part of the vision of the last day than just be a person who can see a vision and not live what they see because believe me I run into many of them in Pentecost and they could see all kinds of Visions as a matter of fact I've seen a man one night called a woman out and done something that was just totally completely wrong and after he called her out he called me out the very next person and told me what I prayed that day the very words I told to God the very words I said by myself my wife didn't even know what I prayed no one knew what I prayed and yet that man told me word for word what I told to God I thought that was so spiritual I thought it was so phenomenal and I thought it was so wonderful until I found out that man had a girlfriend here and another girlfriend there and another girlfriend somewhere else while he's married to another woman well praise the Lord what is that false anointed one at the end time so don't get all down because you don't see Visions but get all up because you're part of one you see as the bride the prophet of God saw us in a vision and what was that Vision it was the bride being in line but remember there were some who stepped out of line but because they were bride they did not stay out of line but they come back in life so I would rather be one who can be a part of that remember it was the bride you notice in that Vision he didn't see them separated as being preachers and being prophets and being prophesires what he saw was the bride and they were typified by who preachers no they were not typified by preachers they were not typified by being singers they were not typified by being musicians they were all typified as being women of all all different cultures isn't it amazing so here wasn't the main preacher up front and then a secondary preacher and a third preacher and then a singer and then a piano player and an organ player it wasn't none of them even seen they were all typed by what women in the vision so even men which are preachers prophets whatever they are they still come under the symbol of being the bride type is that right and there they were identified as those who heard the voice of the message of the last day and they got their eyes on the church and when they did they began to Veer off and follow that church downward and he screamed back get back in line get back in line he comes back to himself standing in the room screaming to the bride to get back in line I believe she come back and lie I'm our self-desire to be a part of those in the vision anybody else here with me now Zechariah whenever he moves into this and who knows if the man even realized himself that God was going to pick him up now remember prophets see their Visions in the realm of the fourth dimension no God created seven dimensions in the beginning because he knew that we would need these seven dimensions in time to be able to communicate which are light matter time science where the unbeliever goes for the believer goes and where God Is So in the fourth dimension is actually a word diseases begin in the fourth dimension is where television is in the fourth dimension it's where prophets see their Vision so in that realm a prophet has the ability to be able to see a vision like having a dream with his eyes wide open so his son right there and look at you Brother David Johnson and see you as a five-year-old boy and then see you as the age you are now and then maybe look ahead in your future and see you as a 70 or 75 year old man and it could go from one scene to another to another in a matter of seconds how could he do that it's beyond time travel it's beyond light travel it's Fourth Dimension travel so he's moving in there and he's able to see all of that and that's why that that gift is so absolutely perfect because when God Taps into that of a man who's called to be that God made it so that that man cannot say error well praise the Lord that's why God captured prophets to be able to reiterate his word I'm not made that way okay every sermon I've ever preached has had mistakes in it I've never preached the perfect one I've been preaching most all of my life and I've never preached one perfect sermon I dare say it would be nice to have one under your belt before you go but more than likely I never will because now I'm only a prophet is made to where whenever he speaks the saith the Lord it cannot be wrong because God so captures that into that Realm of the fourth dimension that the prophet's Soul moves aside he can't even say what he wants to say he can't even say what he's thinking and no doubt they were standing there and the human part is thinking this and that and the other but God's direct contact into the gift of that man's life he had to do it that way in order to write the Bible do you think this man would have ever spoke these things of thus saith the Lord on their own if that have thought it through with Isaiah have ever said a virgin shall conceive if he would have run that through his intellectual mindset what in the world why why am I going to say that well there's nobody going to believe that they'll make fun of me they ridicule me but God so tapped into the gift in that man's life he really didn't have no say about it it really didn't even matter if he didn't even believe it once it was done and we know sometimes a prophet would say things and then they'd get an attitude about God didn't Jonah do the same thing and others done the same thing Jeremiah said I made up in my mind I wasn't going to preach no more why it caused him all kinds of trouble all types of anxiety he said I made up my mind I wasn't going to speak no more in the name of the Lord and then he come back and said but his word was like a fire shut up inside my bones so you know what he really didn't have an option he really didn't have well God said boy thing you want to go and do it again he didn't have an option there was something inside of there that ability from that gift tied to the fourth dimension he jumped right back on and said the same thing again now watch what God does as he breaks into this gift in Zechariah let's look in verse 13. even he shall Bill the Temple of the Lord now what we're talking about is not that it's the man it's not the man Joshua it is not the man said to die it's not the man's cerebral but it is actually God prophesying of a man which will come and build the real Temple of the Lord he shall bear the glory the glory of what the Temple of the Lord and He Shall sit and Rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of Peace shall be between them both now whoever this man is notice it doesn't say that he's an angel it does not say he's a cherubim a seraphim a zoon but it actually calls him a man the man whose name is the branch so this man is going to build the Temple of the Lord so it is the promise of a future building you imagine the Jews they are so elated and they are so excited because they're getting their Temple back and after all these years they haven't had one and they're getting their Temple rebuilt and while that is being rebuilt and the last church is being put on it God is speaking hundreds of years down the road and telling them of another man that's going to come and build another Temple now whenever the Jews begin to take these scriptures and down through time no doubt some of them begin to look and think wonder if this could be a Messianic prophecy well the temple which has now been currently under construction is built by who cerebral so zerubbabel is going to be the one that's going to bring her to the consummation and finish it Joshua has been anointed as being King which wasn't king so you imagine the people saying what is this Prophet doing what we're building the house right now Somebody Like Us come and say praise the Lord we've got to move in you're now a couple of services now we're starting to build a church a day after tomorrow down the road and y'all think poor brother Donnie he's lost his mind the poor guy he just saying the poor man there's something wrong with it well here they are they're so excited about building the house of God and this Prophet stand up and said don't be too carried away with this because there's coming a man that's going to build the Temple of the Lord and they're thinking build the Temple of the lord well this is the Temple of the Lord prophecy can be so mysterious can it not so the temple which he's building is not the one that zechariah's Prophet is prophesying about it is going to be a spiritual Temple which is going to be what the Church of the Living God yet the prophet Zechariah doesn't say it in those terms who knows if the man even knew what he was talking about or not and no doubt the prophets did whenever they would say something in the name of the Lord and they would write it down or have a scribe that would write it some of them couldn't write so they would actually have a scribe that would follow them around and they would write it they would just put it down as they said it and you imagine said well what what did I say well you you call that woman out and you said her name was so and so and is that right is that was that what your name is I don't even remember it remember our modern day Prophet done the same thing so they would say you mean I said that is that is that what I say that's what you said I wrote it down word for word and then prophets would think oh my goodness a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child and you'll call his name Emmanuel the Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of peace and of his kingdom there shall be no end you imagine they must still live such an odd peculiar life and people would have criticized them they would have made fun of them but they had to stand on what they believed was thus saith the Lord now watch if this was a prophecy now as I said we're looking back and that's what's much easier for us hindsight is always 20 20. so we're looking back and we're looking back to the cross and we can see the Fulfillment of that scripture watch in Matthew chapter 20 verse 28 even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister to give his life a ransom for many now notice what this man whose name is the branch is going to do he is going to build the Temple of the Lord now unlike zerubbabel and all of those men in that day they was taking up out of the rubble and they were digging up Stone so what they would do they would make basically a tale it's called a tell t-e-l-l like right now whenever they're digging down in the city of David around cerusalem and they've just dug under and found the the steps that went up to the place to be able to worship and they said these are the same steps the Lord Jesus would have walked upon yet they had to dig down like 22 feet under dirt and stone and rubble and all kinds of things so what did they do so instead of carrying All That Rock away they were just haul in more and level it out haul in more and level it out so they would build one on top of another on top of another so they're digging down and digging down and the more they dig the more identity they find of who live there it's the same way with us if we can dig past our traditions and our fears and all those sort of things and really find out who we really are well he is going to build the house of God but he's not going to use the stones that they use what's he going to use well he will have to find something of material by which he can build the temple out of the house of God so what's it going to be is it going to be Jerusalem Stone now Jerusalem still has this it's a word that if you build inside the old city walls it is a legal mandate you must use either Old Jerusalem stone or New Jerusalem Stone which is still mined I saw a video not long ago where they had actually found one of the original places to where Solomon and his men went down in there and mined all of this Stone and took it out of the ground it's a mandate in order to keep this particular look well God has a look in his mind of what he wanted the temple to be now it's not a certain skin in color and it's not a certain way and a certain stature you got to be so tall but that would have to be something that he would be able to purchase or buy or create or recreate in order to have the material to make this now we know it has whenever we build a house or a building and we want something so y'all are sitting on a concrete floor so we would call the concrete company and say we want so many yards and they would come well this wall here is made out of metal studs this one's made out of studs got Steel on top Yep this wall here is made out of plywood two layers of plywood right here two between I was running down this way so we've got all sorts of material and each one of those things has a specific use and yet it's the same way in the body of God now zachariah's prophesying that there's going to come a construction man and he's going to be the head contractor for deity and construction company and he's going to be able to make this type of body and it will be a body boasts natural and spiritual and he will bear the glory of this Temple himself and he will build the temple so where is he going to get the material to make it well it won't be Stone and it won't be out of the rubble that's irritable in them is now dug out but it will be a buried treasure that is carried around in human bodies it won't even be knowledgeable or visible to those who pack to treasure they will be born like other Mortals they will come into Life Born Into time they will have a lot of them no purpose in life at all others will have a great agenda of what they want to accomplish and one day they will meet this head contractor and he will change their lives forever he will set them into the economy of God and he will start working on them from the inside out and then he will place them in relation to a body on the Earth by which they can Fellowship now we know that we come to the house of God not just to see one another we don't come here just to be seen but we come to fellowship with each other truly but we come mainly to fellowship with God is that right but yet we also realize we need one another I need you I trust you need me you not only need me but you need those brothers and sisters that are setting around you so here he comes to the earth now whenever the Lord Jesus comes upon the Earth and he's going around as it were looking for building material and he found it some of it was in a refuge pile for sure some of it was found to where even the devil didn't think there's no hope for him but the devil could only see what was on the inside and be able to peer down into the realm of the spirit and see what he thought was damaged goods so damaged said he probably thought that never be able to be redeemed but this general contractor has the ability to look past the flesh past the spirit into the soul and see representation now even at that when he knows the reputation is there it is stained it is soiled by by sin and it must be brought to a process in order for the Builder to be able to use him now once the words of the Lord Jesus even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister but to give his life a ransom for how many Oh you mean not all not every Mortal lives on the earth now you want to argue argue with the Lord Jesus these are his words so the son of man came not to be ministered to but to give his life as a ransom for many so what would be a ransom well you know we've heard of ransoms in our time so some rich person they capture a daughter of those or a granddaughter or a son or something like that and they will call him on the phone and they'll mask their voice you've heard that and they will Master voice and they say we've got your son here he is Dad Dad it's me it's me uh you know do what they say dad they're going to kill me if you don't do it then they take the phone back away from them and they'll say look we want two point million dollars well most of us they'd say just go ahead and bury him and when well I could do that 75 cents maybe well we want two point meal that's why they don't capture our youngest some of y'all was praying they would well he ain't got well we ain't got no money to be able to Ransom so they tell them look we want this money you better not call the police neither because if we see the police weren't killing him dead or in a hammer so we're going to be at a certain certain spot you get that then you meet him and we'll turn them loose oh why do they call that they're holding them for around some well then they try to figure every way they can to Mark the bills they try to put secret messages on them and everything so they can trace it down well we were all born in this prison house and sinful humanity and we were all held at captured by who the devil the enemy of the Lord God so we were held in this place and we were held for what a great Ransom Moses couldn't do it Jeremiah I couldn't do it Zechariah couldn't do it no one could do it because man was in a great Strait it could not be an angel to redeem him and he couldn't be a Kinsmen Redeemer God was the spirit so God couldn't redeem him so there was only one thing that could be done the answer to man's dilemma was what seemed to be a crossing of the Tomb now God himself was in this holy strain the mighty hell on him he could not die of course he could not even even be seen by the natural eye and you was man on the earth everyone broke the womb come forth a sinner marked by sin Cain it come to the world speaking lies so how in the world are you ever going to be able to get something or someone that can be able to meet to tell well the answer is right here and what we call the cross now look at these two beams what we call it a cross so the symbol that he died on symbolize who and what he was he was a cross in the sense he was both God and man so looking at it from the outside they thought he was simply a man and part of the time it becomes so confusing even to the disciples because the prophet said part of the time it was the father speaking and part of the time it was Jesus speaking so the father would speak and then Jesus would speak and then the father would speak and Jesus was fake I hope you understand you yourself are the same way once you become truly born again and the father lives in you you know what it's like to get that pulsation of faith and something speaks out of you that's not even yourself you ever had it to happen to you well that's the father speaking out of you and then there's other times you do the talking well most of us it's probably us does most of the talking most the time maybe so the Lord Jesus dying on the cross was only an answer of his life that it was deity which had been crossed and mixed together with Humanity this is the only way to bring the building material back into the presence sense of god notice again in Acts 20 and 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood so now he was a ransom in Matthew 20. now he is the purchase price and remember the Old Testament that they actually had what was called Redemption money I mean notice what that metallurgical value was it was not bronze it was not gold but it was silver so silver was a metallurgical symbol of redemption now remember gold is deity so gold itself was not what redeemed the firstborn so you had a mule that was born or a donkey I should say not a mule a donkey that was born he was flop here and he was all bow-legged he's standing around and his mama said oh son oh you're so ugly they'll kill you as sure as they see you and that little fighter said Mama Mama I'm so bow-legged I'm so ugly my ears is floppy and his mama she already taught in the word should say sonny boy today is your day you are my firstborn because you are my firstborn you can be redeemed Oh Glory to God now notice what they did was they would go through the act of redemption and he would be redeemed but with some man that God gave them silver silver and they would be able to take that silver because God wanted the firstborn of all the tribes of Israel but God said I'll tell you what I'll do I'll let you keep your firstborn children but you can redeem them from me so bind back from me and let silver speak on their behalf so a firstborn son which would be me Madonna and Betty's first son first born that when I was first born by law God had a claim on me so God by his law would have claimed me but Mom and Daddy would have went and said now God we love Donnie and we want to keep God in our house so we're going to give this silver this Redemption money to buy Donnie so Donnie can be in our house and God said I'll trade with you I'll take the silver you take Donnie there's probably time to say we said kept the silver maybe but God did that soul that they could but redeem their firstborn now here we come then out to the Cross when the Lord Jesus comes to the Earth whenever he is now going to act out the part of the buyer and of the judge which is Satisfied by the amount that was paid I know I don't want to confuse you tonight but it's it's not three Gods it's not even two Gods it's the same God acting out different parts of the drama so one time you see him he's walking through the pawn shop pushing a buddy a buggy of electric attributes said he picked up off a shell here was one in a bar here was one in this church there was one in that church and he began to set them all down through there and he headed right up towards the front because he had the matching part of their soul so he had the Peace by which they could be Redeemed by so he stands out there and he presents the bug and he lays him up on there and then all of a sudden he changes his garments and he steps on behind the cash register and he pays himself hallelujah hallelujah so the justice of God was met in this human Cross of deity and humanity and the justice of God finally was met by what mercy so mercy and Grace kissed and embraced you see they had been divorced they had been apart for all these hundreds and hundreds of years but through the marriage of deity and Humanity mercy and judgment met together and the person of the Lord Jesus that's why you're sitting here tonight and good saying I am redeemed I am redeemed how how is that even possible because the man whose name was the branch he was able to come down and buy the material to build a church First Corinthians chapter 6 verse 20 for ye are bought with a price now notice I know people especially in this age don't like to be told what to do you know well you shouldn't dress this way you shouldn't do that you shouldn't go there you shouldn't do this people don't like it they just don't they just don't like it but remember you are bought with the price and in reality you are not your own well I'm going to do what I want to do well that tells me then you don't understand Redemption now this Gatorade was bought I'm not sure who bought it but I'm glad they did they bought this Gatorade a price was paid for this Gatorade now it is mine because they brought it up here and set it on my Pulpit it's in my left hand and if I want to take my right hand and take the lid off of my bottle of Gatorade if I want to do that and drink the whole bottle it's mine I can do what I want to if I want to take the lid off it's getting pretty warm I don't like warm Gatorade so if I want to take the lid off and take it to the back and pour it down the sink I can do that why because it is mine you are not your own but you are bought with a price and what for for the house of God what I've got my own life I've got my own agenda no you are not here for your own agenda I'm not here for my own agenda I am here to serve his purpose praise the Lord and he bought us with the price and therefore he will put us where he wants us all glory he ought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods First Corinthians 7 23 ye are bought with a price be not ye the Servants of men this is why you don't owe your allegiance to men you don't know your allegiance to the world you belong to the Lord Jesus Christ now he prepares them he buys them and then he prepares him he renews them by his grace and he begins to form and shape and polish them in order to fit and the predestinated slot that he ordained them to walk out now for many of us it will be totally different than what we want it'll be totally different than what we thought but I want you to notice in the Book of Genesis we find a conveying of God and where he was after man fell God walked God walked with his people now notice this verb and Enoch walked with God after he began methusa 300 years and he begat sons and daughters in verse 24 he not walked with God and he was not for God took him Genesis 6 9 these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and a perfect in his generation and Noah walked with God so notice then what we find in the Book of Genesis we find God walking with men this is the relationship that God chose up in the Book of Genesis again we see God now changing in the book of Exodus so we move from Exodus and we move over Genesis rather to the Book of Exodus Exodus chapter 25 verse 8 and God said let them make me speaking to the children of Israel let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them not walk among them now watch God is now entering and bringing the people into a different dispensation so it's no longer that God will just walk among them but God wants to dwell among them look at the meaning of this word to settle down abide reside so God wanted to settle down you imagine God wanted to settle down so God said Moses let them build me a house so I can come down and I want to dwell with him can you imagine how Mighty God wanted to come down and hear the people so he's going to be in this tent and the people are going to be sitting on all four sides according to their tribal Banner so they will sit there and God was on the inside this Shekinah presence of God and God's hearing them talking about trading goats and milk cows God's children I'm talking about racing their onions and their taters and their maters and God shared on talking about their family problems and God sharing them talking about all these domestic things of Life why because God wanted to dwell among them he wanted to come down and not just walk with an Enoch and walk with a Noah and walk with this man and that man but God wanted to be right there amongst them and just hear what this talk about Lord have mercy children can you imagine the great Eternal wanting to be a part of our life I believe he wants more than that today I don't think he just wants to come in here two or three times a week I think he wants to be with us every day of our life brother Paul I think he wants to be right there he wants to be a part of your life a part of your family a part of your house a part of everything that you do in life he wants to be a part of that people make God this this creature this way out yonder somewhere that it does not even concern himself with our problems that is a lie of the devil he is concerned about your troubles he is concerned about your problems he's concerned about your bills he's concerned about your shortcomings he's concerned about you so things that matter to you matter to God wow notice this so God says I'm that I may dwell among them again Exodus 29 45 and I will dwell among the children of Israel and will be their God oh my I will be their God verse 46 and they shall know that I am the Lord their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I may dwell he keeps saying it over and over again that I may dwell among them I am the Lord and what do we find God dwelt in the Tabernacle until the people of Israel sins got so horrendous that the glory of God lifted off of the Tabernacle and departed away from it and they renamed it and called it Ichabod which means the glory has Departed but it was not God's desire or God's choice now this is what happened on the Tabernacle and Exodus chapter 40 verse 34 a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord fill the Tabernacle I want you to listen now what it was that filled the Tabernacle it was the glory of the Lord remember that the glory of the Lord is what filled the Tabernacle it does not say it was his theophany it was the glory of the Lord remember the prophecy in Zechariah was the man whose name is the branch will build the Temple of the Lord and He Shall bear the glory himself so whatever it was they came into that Tabernacle that Shekinah of God the glory of God is what this man is going to Bear whose name is the branch notice in verse 35 and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud Abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle oh what a great thing it must have been verse 37 but if the cloud were not taken up then they journeyed not until the day it was taken up for the cloud of the Lord was upon the Tabernacle by day and fire on it by Night a visible manifestation of the presence of God in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their Journeys and then God dwelt there and God did until the time run out then what did God do God had a man by the name of Solomon and Solomon come and built a temple for God the glory of God now moves inside of this Temple First Kings 8 10. and he came to pass when the priests will come out of the Holy place that the cloud fill the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord then spake Solomon the Lord said he would dwell in the thick Darkness Oh What A Time well you know the sad part about it is Ezekiel chapter 10 verse 18. then the glory of the Lord departed off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubims so once again the glory of God leaves the house of God can't you understand for a child of God today that is filled with the Holy Ghost Satan fights you like no other person on the face of the Earth if he cannot get your soul like he once had it what he wants to do is get you out of fellowship with God he cannot stand this Unity that the Great Divine architect wanted and created in his body so once a person is sealed by the Holy Ghost the devil will never be able to get in that Soul again but the devil will try to make us indifferent or cold or make us bitter or make us have attitudes remember the scripture in Ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of your Redemption so this scripture is actually addressing people that are filled with the Holy Ghost and people fill with the Holy Ghost can do things that will grieve the spirit of God what's he trying to do the same thing to you in the anatite that he did to the children of Israel to where the glory of God will the perfume of Life some of you you know what that feeling is you get colds you get indifference something gets in your life you still love God you'll still go to church you'll see you're not there you're running around and doing this and that and the other but it seems like something's left let me tell you what it is it's the glory the glory the glory has left you your walk and you're having problems with this and you know you go to church and you sit there and you struggle and you struggle and you try to get in and your mind's at Walmart some of you has done fixed your tractor tonight and some of you fix your lawnmower because the grass is starting to grow again some of you stopped your Hogs and feds your chickens well you need to let them chickens wait till after I get done preaching what does that well it's the devil of course trying to hinder you if there's any place he will hinder you from it's the house of God why he don't want you to come here and he sees this Divine Purpose that God has done that now the members of Christ on the Earth are his glory and they are the place where he dwells so the glory of God then in the Ezekiel we see the glory of God move from the threshold of the Tabernacle and it goes upon the cherubims and it stands over the cherubims Hosea 10 5 and the inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth Haven now here they made golden calves and they're worshiping them calves for the people there have shall mourn over it and the priests thereofs that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is departed from it so the glory of God wound up believing again and we know of course whenever whenever it was rebuilt again the time and the days of the Lord Jesus and Herod spent 46 years in building an Attica which was actually the second temple and whenever he enlarged the courtyard and made it very very beautiful we have no record whatsoever the spirit of God ever went back into that place so where was God when the Lord Jesus was on the earth in his human Tabernacle now here excuse me God's next Dwelling Place was going to be a human body now who was it it was the master builder himself that stepped inside his own Creative Body so the master builder God the Eternal steps inside of this human body which we call a son now what makes it so difficult for us is that we know having the children all of us that boy when everything well this this certain man he had this you know he married this woman and they had a child and that's his son so we look at that father and then we think well there's the son which is another person and that's the way it works and the humans train but that ain't the way it works in the God's trade and the gods train the Eternal projected something out of his own heart Christ was the very heart of God not another God that one out of that God but the very portion of that God which the Old Testament kept seal they never knew the love of God and the death said it would be revealed in the New Testament God projects that out of himself that's why the Lord Jesus said I came forth from God and I go back to being God or back to God because that was the projection that could die the Eternal could not die this was the sonship now notice in Saint John 10 38. he said if I do though you believe me not believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him so where is the father then now the Lord Jesus of course goes to the temple and he offers the sacrifice as Martin misfold which is 12 years old and there he was dedicated as a wee little boy but we have no record he was ever allowed to preach there because he was of the tribe of Judah and not of the tribe of Levi so he went there but never allowed to go in behind the holiest of holies he was never allowed to preach in the Holy place of God but we have no record that God was even there anyway as far as the same thing that it was in the days of Solomon so where was God God was in his new Temple his new house now I'm going to say it to you this way we've spent years couple years now building this place a lot of Labor a lot of work a lot of sacrifice but don't get it in your mind now that this this building right here is where God lives so whenever we all come in God's here and then when we come and well you know we all go back home and we go our way and we leave God right here because this is where God lives God is here because you're here and he would meet with us if we was in a brush Harbor and a storefront because we bring him with us so it's not like that the presence of God we honor and we reverence this because this is when we worship Him of course but you bring him and I bring him and you bring him and you bring him and you bring him so you bring your lick of fire and that's why we need one another you understand notice this in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 19 to with that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself so here God was in his human Temple God was in Christ reconciled the world to himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and as committed unto us the word of reconciliation now it goes on the next verse and said he's also given to us the ministry of reconciliation so now God is having men who are called to preach the gospel and they are carrying out the same thing the master Carpenter started two thousand years ago that's why the devil hates God called preachers why he knows God called preachers ain't building a building for themselves now Satan loves egotistical anointed preachers because they're building their own little kingdom for their own little name for their own little deal but a real true man of God ain't building a Reagan Kingdom or a Spencer Kingdom or whatever other Kingdom they're simply glad to be identified as a worker in the Kingdom of almighty God somebody tell me why in the world would I want to build a Donnie Reagan Kingdom and forfeit my rights into eternal life when I can be a part of the biggest kingdom that's ever been on the Earth but you see I can't build a Reagan Kingdom and build to the kingdom of God at the same time there ain't no way totally impossible it's got to be one of the other and don't just look at me as a preacher it's the same thing for you you can build your own little life your own little world your own little kingdom and then you'll give Jesus just a little bit of space of your life or you can give him your all and you'll get rewarded at that day oh my goodness it'll be on anything you can imagine in your mind notice in Colossians chapter 1 verse 14 in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God so the Lord Jesus was the temple or the house of the being which could not be seen he is the sealable part of the Unseen God praise the Lord who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature Colossians 2 9 for in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bodily so today then of course beginning with Acts 2 he dwells where in his church now in the book of Acts chapter 7 verse 48 how be it the most high dwell us not in temples or churches made with hands I saith the prophet so don't take tonight whenever we dismiss here in a little bit that we're all going to go out and almighty God is going to be left in here and he sleeps in here and he stays in here and this is where God dwells God dwells in your heart I believe if we really believe that we'd act different at home would act different on the job well my goodness some of you Brothers wouldn't come in here wearing a hat for nothing you wouldn't come in here some of you would never come in here and raise your voice while you won't talk after church you will not talk before church is good that's what we should do we need to reverence that and thank God that we do but yet what about in our own life what about in the house of God oh you wouldn't throw a fit you wouldn't lose your temper in the house of God or not but you lose one in this house we need to recognize where God actually lives and where God actually dwell can't you see that why Satan looks at this and Satan says I hate this I hate what he's been able to do so what will he try to do divide divide and this is his same context that he's used and the same tactics he used from the Garden of Eden and that was divide and conquer so he'll try to divide us among ourselves he'll try to get in in between the husband and wife in their home come on now don't get quiet on me he will try to get between the husband and his wife in their home and cause them to bicker and fuss and fight and argue and whatever more why he knows you're only as strong as the unity projected in your walk with God you see this type of unity is not a denominational auspices that we all join together because we're United so and so on United so and so it is each one of us baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Jesus Christ and yet at the same time individual members that are as different as days from night one from the other God don't want you to be like me God don't want me to be like you but he wants all of us to be like Jesus Christ and the church said oh my so he dwells in the hearts of those that have received a spirit notice Psalms 40. so he builds his Temple by taking dead stones out of the pit of sin Psalms 40 and 2 he brought me also out of a horrible pit out of the Maori clay and set my feet upon a rock an established my Goings praise the Lord Ephesians 2 21 and whom all the building fitly framed I love this because Paul used the words that a carpenter in that day would have used so it's not like it's just thrown together you know just get this long board and tied to this stick and tie it to this piece of stuccoa just to take a you know take a a piece of Scotch tape I know what we can do this let's duct tape it all together they to duct tape they say is just absolutely phenomenal on this day well you can't duct tape a Christian you can't duct tape we're not Ducks no hand we're Eagles amen and Eagles and we don't have to use no tape we don't want to be taped together we want to be baptized together if we're only Eagle taped together we will bust apart but if we're baptized into the same body by the Holy Ghost you won't get us apart brother in whom all the building fitly framed fitly framed together grow us what a peculiar building this is so we can say it that the two befores are ten foot where they need to be 10 foot and 12 foot where they need to be 12. and eight well they need to be eight and you put them all together and you put them on there's eight foot there's ten foot there's 12 foot there's fourteen there's two by tens two by twelves two before there's three quarter of an inch and a half and note you look at and say wow that building them in the walls was eight foot now they've grown that was ten foot now they growed and they're almost 12 foot they've all grown how in the world can these building grow well that's the because the master Carpenter pulled it together to make it where that they would have stretchable material oh oh hallelujah it's fitly framed together so it's the framework of a building and the materials accurately and carefully cut now I've been working around some of these brothers around here that's been building and uh they kind of developed a little phrase whenever we was doing some building and some modifying so if they couldn't get in touch with me or they was just uncertain about something they developed this phrase that they would ask for forgiveness instead of asking for permission well some of the things they asked forgiveness for I made them redo it anyway because I had something in my mind something that I wanted it to look like Oh Brother Tony be okay with it and I come in and say oh cry okay I did that cross I looked at that cross other down said brother Dave the cross is too low they said really I I believe that's what it needs to go no it's too low so we come over yesterday morning and took it down you know why it didn't match what I thought well we wrestle with it and wrestle with it and took it off the wall and read it on the lights and reboard the stone and this and that and the other and then we got it up and all three of us and my brother Michael and brother jacket four of us and we stood back there and brother Dave and Brother David looked over her brother Michael and said he was right it looks better now he could ask for forgiveness all day long but that wasn't what I wanted I wanted it high at the top now you see the Lord has this in his mind but what we'd ever say you know what I believe it looked better if it's over here and somebody else said no that don't look right it needs to be over here and then somebody else said why you're both wrong it needs to be right there I'm so glad we've got one absolute about what the Lord wants I wasn't called to tell you what I think we need to change it this way I think the Lord started his church the way he wanted it and I believe he'll finish it the way he started it I don't think he started it out wrong well I know some of the message people don't like it because it's built on an Apostolic Foundation but I happen to love it because that's the way he started it and I'll tell you one thing if he wanted to start it out on playing tapes only going to church I figure he could have done that 2 000 years ago so if he started it out with preachers filled with the Holy Ghost casting out Devils Healing The Sick and preaching the gospel I don't figure he's going to close it down fruits are shutting down and push and play well come on now oh no he started with men filled with the Holy Ghost speaking The Word of Life laying hands on people that is the apostolic way of receiving the holy ghost that man called of God born of the spirit of God lay hands on those and that is imparting eternal life Hallelujah why because it is the same Lord Jesus and another body doing his same work that he's always done to be continued oh praise the Lord is it any Wonder that Satan wants to do everything he can to divide us and separate us might breaks my heart when I think about down in every age what he's done how he's divided the people with doctrines and opinions and theology about this and that and the other and these people take this side with this Doctrine and won't speak to these people and this one take this side and won't speak and yet going to heaven and we can't even speak to one another on Earth what are we going to do y'all going to walk walk down the street and meet that person from that other church I ain't walking down that street I'll do one thing right now I ain't gonna do it you got that attitude you won't be there and if they got that attitude about you they won't be there neither come on children don't you see why Satan wants to divide us can't you see why why he wants us to have hard feelings and our heart against this one and that one the other one to go to church with Even in our own family and you know as well as I do it don't take 57 members of a family to get all 57 out of sync all it takes is one all it takes is one member of a family getting out of harmony with with the rest of the family and they can cause more trouble than 50 people can try to fix well praise the Lord Brother the only person it's the truth Satan knows how to do this but I'm going to go ahead and tell him and tell you Satan you are defeated he's tried for 2 000 years to destroy this house of God he will never do it he burned him he fed him to Lions he crucified him he divided him by denominations God sent a prophet and he's divided this message all down through the time he's done exactly the same thing but he never has or never will stop the work of the Living God because our God is greater our God is bigger our God is stronger amen forgiveness and love is Mercy is bigger than the devil's contention and Discord amen how many beliefs how many beliefs God will have a people around the world that will fulfill his word all hell will never stop it oh praise the Lord that thing go off well he got mad didn't he we got a sister that wants to come be baptized tonight verse one to be buried alive in the Baptist baptismal poor I hope I hope and hope there's all kinds of them you believe what you want to I don't believe we're just here I don't believe we're just here so we could have a new place to come God has a reason for us being here that I'm not being a little sheep wandering around out here somewhere we're going to reach them by God's grace hallelujah how many believes it with all your heart oh don't you love him let's sing something together Hayes they they come and prepare for the baptism well the Joe you've taken care of that all right praise the Lord I wonder let's just bow his father coming and preparing for that how many of you said brother Donnie with all my heart I want to be in my place I want to be in my place in the body which I'm not important if God placed you in the body you are important and nobody can take your place I'm not rich you don't have to be I ain't neither lion handsome huh I mean you both got something in common there well in my family tree this that the other if God called you you're a part of us and we need you each of us pooling pulling together for the purpose of God to see what God is going to do oh praise the Lord Heavenly Father we think it's a not for your word Lord we ask you Lord Jesus that you would help us father what a what a thing we have before us tonight to see your great program that has unfolded since the dawn of time to see what you had in your mind before the world began Satan no doubt thought he had messed it up for good in the Garden of Eden he thought when he got Abraham down into the land of Egypt you turn your back on him salt money got Moses you'd forsake Him every turn of the journey the failures of men never overrode the sovereignty of God but vice versa we're so thankful that you allowed that clause in your Covenant for your sovereignty you knew it would be necessary from time to time to intervene I think Lord of our Prophet messenger himself pull his gloves off after the death of his wife and daughter couldn't stand life no more pulled his gloves off on the power line up the power pole going to put his hands on those wires and take his own life but the mercy of God the sovereignty of God overrode his human weakness thank you Father thank you Father when he was going to take his life again the sovereignty of God no doubt there's people standing here tonight if your Sovereign Grace had not intervened they wouldn't even be here tonight oh God we believe we are called for a purpose and all hell cannot stop that purpose father may you help each of us that we can find our place I believe with all of my heart and many of them have but we know once we find it like the children of Israel they fought for years to get their position then after they finally gained the ground that they were able to reach in that day then they had to change their mindset and they had to fight to keep what they already fought to get so many of us Lord we may find ourselves finding to keep something that we think my goodness overcome that years ago why in the world am I here again because now we're defending what is already ours and Satan trying to bring depression or sadness or maybe some besetting sin back on people's lives that they were delivered from years ago it's nothing but him we know when the children of Israel conquered the land in Palestine South first and then they begin to move northward and by the time they moved northward took them years to be able to take it all and by the time they come back whenever Caleb come to receive his Mountain they had run the Giants out of that land but after years they moved back in and what did Caleb find them Giants had moved right back into that same land now he's confronted with some of the same things that they dealt with years before but he said give me my mountain Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus you'd help each of us tonight father maybe that mountain is peace maybe that mountain is healing over a disease maybe it's a sister going through the change of life some days she don't even know who she is someday she struggles even with her sanity but father God in the name of Jesus I pray you'd give my sisters that claim Lord is Carol and I run into a sister the other day that dealt was coveted and lost a bunch of her hair and as we talked to her there in the store and the tears trickling out of her eyes down her cheeks because of losing her hair father I pray not only for her tonight but every other one and you know I prayed for many of them after dealing with covet in the name of Jesus I resent that devil attacking our sisters even some of our brothers Satan leave them in Jesus name Hallelujah we worship you tonight father we want our ground and if there's more we ain't got yet we want that too yeah Hallelujah we worship you tonight Jesus we bless your name father the sister of Sandy Edwards has been coming for quite some time now with Keith and she told me she was baptized when she was five years old but there's a lot of things she saw around her life that that was happening that made a really question if she was if it was even real if it even worked if it would even the right way to do it and she's been coming and she came in here Sunday and she said well brother Donnie was was preaching she said it was just like it was just her and him Lord speaking and I told her I said this is the great thing about God you can have 500 people in here hear the same sermon and God will speak to 500 different needs that's just the way he is you know I was standing outside talking to her and you know and I explained to her I said you know you don't we can't search for God we have we don't have God is unsearchable we don't have that ability but it's God that finds us it was my purpose that God later here was my purpose that God spoke to her and she came down and she told Brother she said I want to get baptized as soon as possible so that's where we're at today so if you'll pray with me we'll pray for sister Sandy that when she comes up that God will fill her with the spirit of the Holy Ghost let us pray Heavenly Father Lord you said that you are the way the truth and the life Lord you said none other can come come to you except through that way Lord but we know father that the prophet said when that is calling to us if that's not there we would never hear it the Deep calling to the deep and there was something in in inside of her Lord would you call her name but she responded Lord I think of the woman at the well she went to get water that's all she did sister Sandy just came to go to church to hurt hear another another sermon but Sunday was her day at the well where she met Living Water Lord I pray tonight Lord as we bury her in this in this physical water and this bastary Lord May that Living Water be what that consumes your lord lord may you wash her clean it inside and out May her greatest desire Lord is to serve you to be to be led by your spirit Lord we're taught in in Matthew the spirit will lead you to all truth that's our desire for her Lord fill her with your Holy Spirit as we baptize her in Jesus name amen sister Sandy I'm on your confession and commission by Acts 2 38 I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you Lord men and Brethren what must we do to be saved repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call aren't you glad he called you I'm glad the Lord called our sister may the Lord be with us
