[24:23] I'll see you
[24:25] [Music]
[24:39] d
[24:48] it seemed like a good idea yesterday to
[24:50] tell brother Louie I had a song when I'm
[24:53] in my truck driving down the road and
[24:55] singing it it seemed like it was alright
[24:57] but this song basically says I've come
[25:05] too far to turn back and there's nothing
[25:10] that the devil can put on the other
[25:12] scale in my life too that outweighs my
[25:15] lord and my love for my lord
[25:19] he never said there never be heartaches
[25:29] no he never as I recall and he never
[25:44] said the path was an arrow but as I see
[25:53] the little sparrow when it falls
[26:02] he never said there wouldn't
[26:10] B times you spin with your back to the
[26:19] [Laughter]
[26:21] oh but to me
[26:26] anytime
[26:29] I've walked with
[26:31] my Jesus and I'll never
[26:37] look back to it all
[26:45] too many try I'm sorry a mountain
[26:56] and too many times I've faced this cruel
[27:04] Oh
[27:04] [Applause]
[27:06] we never ride first ed his love
[27:14] cause my fountain in Satan can hold
[27:21] enough to turn back Oh
[27:30] some may not hear it and other
[27:38] furs may fear it oh and many made out
[27:45] there
[27:46] it's real but I'm just a sample on
[27:57] earthly example of an empty vessel
[28:07] [Applause]
[28:08] spear
[28:12] my
[28:14] life was
[28:16] so broken till these words were spoken
[28:24] let body
[28:34] since he put it all together
[28:40] there's no kind of weather that can ever
[28:46] caused me to stray from his way
[28:53] [Music]
[29:00] time
[29:02] I've climbed up life's mountain
[29:08] two men
[29:11] times a face the cruel
[29:15] world say
[29:18] I first did his love war
[29:27] my fountain and Satan can't hold enough
[29:35] to turn back
[29:37] Oh
[29:38] [Music]
[29:50] he is loved
[29:54] my fountain knackered and old Satan
[30:00] can't hold enough to turn back Oh
[30:13] thank you
[30:16] [Music]
[30:21] many feels that way tonight with all
[30:23] your heart where would you go we're on a
[30:28] world would you go a man
[30:31] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23 a man we
[30:39] know where we're going we're going up a
[30:42] man let's look again tonight at the
[30:46] parallel of the church the marriage
[30:50] between a man and woman what God puts
[30:54] them together how God reflects it from
[30:57] the Old Testament through the new into
[31:01] the New Jerusalem Ephesians chapter 5
[31:04] verse 23 for the husband is the head of
[31:08] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[31:13] the church and he is the savior of the
[31:17] body therefore as the church is subject
[31:21] unto Christ so let the wives be to their
[31:25] own husbands and everything they go
[31:27] along with and everything that they
[31:30] don't go along with then I must have
[31:37] been the Queen James Version
[31:42] so let the wives be to their own
[31:45] husbands and everything husbands love
[31:49] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[31:53] church man that loves his wife right it
[31:57] helps take up the difficulty of verse 20
[32:01] for a man that doesn't love his wife
[32:04] right
[32:05] and yet demands subjection and for a lot
[32:09] Oh be daeun ceccolini ver never be able
[32:17] to operate and function properly
[32:19] because the head itself is not
[32:21] functioning right but if the man doesn't
[32:24] do his part and doesn't eliminate the
[32:26] woman from doing hers if the woman
[32:28] doesn't do her part doesn't eliminate
[32:30] the man from doing his so you get on a
[32:33] merry-go-round well she don't well he
[32:35] don't she don't he don't none of that
[32:38] won't hold water and you stand before
[32:39] the Lord no he don't since she don't
[32:42] swim they ever get you through the gates
[32:44] it's gonna take our wheels not he don'ts
[32:49] and she don'ts husbands love your wives
[32:52] even as Christ also loved the church and
[32:56] gave himself for it let's bow our heads
[33:01] together and we'd like to be remembered
[33:02] tonight before the Lord in prayer amen
[33:04] Lord Jesus thank you for your precious
[33:06] word father we're so grateful that we
[33:08] can be gathered together again tonight
[33:09] Lord to be able to hear your thoughts to
[33:13] hear your words a pray father that you
[33:16] would help us that we would be able to
[33:18] open up our very hearts to your spirit
[33:21] tonight we desire to hear from your
[33:24] heart Lord Jesus we count on an honor
[33:28] that we would breathe so privileged to
[33:32] be able to hear from the heart of God
[33:35] to hear your law is a wonderful thing to
[33:39] hear your Commandments it's a wonderful
[33:43] say yet father we know one day the law
[33:46] the commandments they were ceased to
[33:50] exist but the heart of God
[33:53] we'll be through eternity so we desire
[33:57] to serve you from your heart so if you
[34:02] project to us from your heart to ours
[34:06] even as a woman finds herself in
[34:08] subjection to her husband so we as the
[34:11] bride that projection makes all the
[34:15] commandments the do's and the don'ts
[34:17] makes them so much easier for those who
[34:21] try to live this word just by simply
[34:23] complying under the stage of
[34:25] sanctification and I can't go here and I
[34:27] can't do that can't say this I can't
[34:30] were that have to give up this have to
[34:33] stop that they'll never never understand
[34:37] the joy of living for you but if they
[34:39] can ever get it from your heart to
[34:41] theirs
[34:42] it becomes a pleasure speak to us
[34:45] tonight and that pleasure form father in
[34:48] Jesus name and the Saint said I bless
[34:52] you may be seated
[34:58] 1st Corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 but I
[35:02] would have you know that the head of
[35:06] every man is Christ now here we come to
[35:10] real godly headship a woman will never
[35:16] be able to find her place under any man
[35:20] unless that man is under Christ now I'm
[35:25] not talking about man throwing quotes
[35:27] around and the man throwing scriptures
[35:29] but I'm talking about the man himself
[35:31] being under the headship of the Lord
[35:34] Jesus any true daughter of God that she
[35:38] may be strong nature she may battle and
[35:41] wrassle was being submissive but if
[35:44] she's truly born again from her soul she
[35:48] longs for a man that she can be able to
[35:52] respect and be able to be under his
[35:55] headship if she's a real believer but
[35:59] she will never be able to do that IFS a
[36:03] man himself is not where he needs to be
[36:06] now he can demand and she can march in
[36:09] tune and signal and salute and left
[36:11] right left right left right if that's
[36:14] what he wants his home to be but this is
[36:16] not what Paul is even writing about now
[36:20] notice how he introduces divine headship
[36:22] I would have you know that the head of
[36:25] every man
[36:26] notice again now we bring back to the
[36:28] original creation of the family in the
[36:31] Garden of Eden God is by divine protocol
[36:35] giving his order of creation and that
[36:39] way he makes the man first and he does
[36:43] not make him a little boy he does not
[36:47] make him a seven-year-old child a
[36:50] ten-year-old child sixteen year old
[36:53] child but he makes him a man a man right
[36:58] now notice his sisters for those who
[37:01] fall in love with their little boy more
[37:05] than they do their husband there's
[37:07] something wrong with your love or
[37:10] something wrong with your husband or
[37:12] something only both but God made him to
[37:16] be a man this is God's order then he
[37:20] lives for however long in the Garden of
[37:23] Eden then God does not bring a son out
[37:27] of the man or a daughter out of the man
[37:30] but he brings a woman out of the man not
[37:34] a wife first a woman a man a woman then
[37:41] a husband and a wife now you sisters
[37:46] that are looking for a husband let me
[37:49] give you just a little bit of advice you
[37:53] watch that man that you're interested in
[37:55] see the makeup of his daddy of his mama
[37:59] his grandmother and his grandfather his
[38:02] uncle that you can't stand and realize
[38:06] and when he hits about 30 to 35 or 40 he
[38:09] may wind up being like that uncle that
[38:11] you don't like now and also keep in mind
[38:15] that his habits before what he's
[38:18] professed
[38:18] to have as the new birth may show up
[38:22] again later if he don't really have it
[38:25] because whatever he is will repeat its
[38:30] cycle without the new birth annihilates
[38:34] that old nature he may keep it a press
[38:38] for a long time so makes your sisters
[38:41] when you're looking at it don't just
[38:44] look always a Christian he's in church
[38:46] all that's well and good but that's a
[38:49] lot different from being filled with the
[38:50] Holy Ghost that's right and you look at
[38:53] what he done in sin and keep a good idea
[38:56] in mind that if that boy ain't born
[38:58] again if he's just professing that he is
[39:01] he'll wind up being that and worse a few
[39:04] years down the road
[39:05] except being you're his wife well praise
[39:09] the Lord amen now notice this is why
[39:13] that God sets the order of the home in
[39:16] this way so Paul said I would have you
[39:18] know that the head of every man is
[39:21] Christ and the head of the woman is the
[39:27] man and the head of Christ is God now
[39:33] you see a real man a real son of God has
[39:38] no problem was Christ being his head
[39:42] because Christ himself now what is
[39:46] Christ Christo's the Anointed One it is
[39:50] that what's condon sin out of the
[39:54] eternal now this is not to people we're
[39:56] talking about it is not a tri unity and
[39:59] I got hit but God even shows divine
[40:03] headship and The Anointed One now
[40:06] remember Jesus when he was born the
[40:09] angel told Mary you will call his name
[40:13] Jesus he did not tell her you would call
[40:18] him the Lord Jesus Christ that would
[40:21] have been an error thou shalt call his
[40:24] name Jesus the name of the human body
[40:29] was
[40:31] Jesus well somebody's looking at me bug
[40:34] I all the Jesus only is always stiffen
[40:37] up on you when you go this way now he
[40:39] was called Jesus at his verse but he
[40:44] received the fullness of the baptism of
[40:47] the Holy Ghost at the river then he was
[40:52] Christ then when he died raised up from
[40:56] the dead then he moves into the supreme
[40:59] office of this same Jesus asked God made
[41:03] both Lord and Christ then of course he's
[41:08] identified as Lord Jesus Christ
[41:13] so the Christ is under divine headship
[41:17] of the eternal now the eternal never
[41:20] began so you see a real true man has no
[41:24] problem with real headship himself but a
[41:28] man who never really comes under
[41:31] headship it's gonna be an awful husband
[41:34] to any wife well praise the Lord my
[41:40] early Oh everybody ready
[41:42] good for the man notice now the man is
[41:46] under this headship of Christ as Christ
[41:50] which has a beginning is under the
[41:54] headship of that which never started and
[41:58] we know that God is now looking at it
[42:02] and running the parallel between the man
[42:05] and the woman as it is was Christ and
[42:08] the church so the man is the head of the
[42:12] woman we looked at this word but let's
[42:13] look at it again the word head since the
[42:15] loss of the head destroys life
[42:17] this word is extremely used in the
[42:19] phrases relating to capital and extreme
[42:22] punishment metaphorically it's anything
[42:24] supreme chief prominent of persons a
[42:28] master or a lord of a husband in
[42:32] relation to his wife of christ the lord
[42:35] of the husband and the church of things
[42:38] the corner stone now
[42:40] then the man is the head of the llama
[42:43] and the church said both men and women
[42:47] said the man is the head of the woman
[42:52] but now related in the right way as God
[42:55] is the head of Christ and Christ is the
[43:00] head of the man and the man is the head
[43:03] of the woman now this is real headship
[43:06] whenever I hear men talking about
[43:08] headship and the only thing they talk
[43:10] about is how obedient their life should
[43:13] be to them they're missing very
[43:15] important more elements and you know
[43:18] right there they don't have a clue about
[43:20] what we're talking about they don't have
[43:22] it in divine order all they think it is
[43:24] is them snapping their fingers no I've
[43:27] been there like a little puppy dog
[43:29] yes master yes master
[43:31] what did you want myself you don't need
[43:35] a wife you need a dog pound
[43:40] yeah now Paul goes on to say now in
[43:44] verse 8 the man is not of the woman but
[43:50] the woman of the man I remember him
[43:53] saying this we're going back to the
[43:55] original creation actually before the
[43:58] man ever fell and I remember God made
[44:00] the man and he did not have to grow as
[44:03] far as from a young boy our teenager a
[44:06] preteen a teenager in his twenties but
[44:09] he was a man when God made him and then
[44:13] God of course makes the woman ish and
[44:16] his shy out of the man so God never made
[44:19] him a husband first because there was
[44:22] nothing there to make him a husband he
[44:24] must have a counterpart which would be
[44:26] the wife so God made him a man in making
[44:29] this the man
[44:31] live and in right display of the
[44:33] proximity of the attributes of God in
[44:36] the Garden of Eden for who knows how
[44:38] long it would have been unbecoming for
[44:41] God to have made him in the office of a
[44:44] husband and had nothing there to be able
[44:46] to meet that need or be the counterpart
[44:49] of that attribute so God made him in his
[44:52] first position and that was a man so the
[44:56] Lord God formed man from the dust of the
[44:59] ground and then of course about all the
[45:01] animals and so on saw then we see the
[45:04] man's position changes as the Lord God
[45:08] brings something out of the man to bring
[45:11] him into his own position so it was the
[45:14] creation of the woman that actually
[45:17] exalted the man and lifted the man out
[45:20] of his first dispensation and that was
[45:23] the state of being a man alone but it
[45:26] was the creation of the woman coming out
[45:28] of his own body which now exalts him
[45:31] into a higher position I ought to be
[45:34] rejoicing with me because the same thing
[45:36] happened to the Lord Jesus
[45:38] now when the Lord Jesus of course being
[45:40] the logos being the Christ he was that
[45:42] one who went out of the eternal of
[45:43] course many many eons of years ago but
[45:46] yet he could not be able to walk into
[45:48] that position of being husband or
[45:50] bridegroom until there was a bride
[45:53] actually given it was all an attribute
[45:55] States of course first but once the
[45:57] bride was going to be burst than that
[45:59] but then himself exalts him to the
[46:01] position where he can now be fulfilled
[46:04] of what his heart and longed to be for
[46:06] many many millennia and we are now
[46:08] helping fulfill that desire of the
[46:11] Almighty God aren't you glad for that so
[46:14] in that Paul reverse back to this in
[46:16] verse 8 and says the man is not of the
[46:19] woman but the woman of the man and we
[46:22] know even whenever a woman today will
[46:24] give birth to a baby boy that God is not
[46:27] doing in the same general way as it was
[46:30] in the very beginning because now it is
[46:33] a mixture of the DNA the genes are
[46:35] chromosomes all that together and the
[46:37] woman is not the man of the boy is not
[46:39] the see
[46:40] of the woman but the boy is actually the
[46:42] product of the woman holding him and
[46:44] carrying it in a room of course and the
[46:47] navel cord attached to that but the
[46:49] woman cannot do that without the man so
[46:52] Paul is relating out to the original
[46:54] creation that God never actually took
[46:57] Adam out of Eve but it was the other way
[47:00] around now showing this with headship
[47:02] but remember the headship does not just
[47:05] stop in a home it's the same way with
[47:07] the church so Jesus Christ was not made
[47:11] for you but you were made for him now
[47:15] the church has got it all turned around
[47:17] and they make Jesus name his blood
[47:19] everything that he is it's a third
[47:21] disposal they can use it abuse it make
[47:24] fun of it ridicule it do whatever they
[47:26] want to because the way they got it
[47:28] that's typically at us in the way
[47:30] they've got it he was made for them so
[47:33] if they wanna blaspheme his name they
[47:35] can do it and he's obligated to forgive
[47:37] them though he's not in the building of
[47:40] the house of the human temple in the
[47:43] beginning God places it in the cycle of
[47:46] the Divine Protocol and that was the man
[47:48] first then of course with that comes a
[47:51] great responsibility then the man being
[47:54] first he's given the responsibility to
[47:57] be like Christ and yet brothers you may
[47:59] sit here and wonder tonight my goodness
[48:01] what a thing that God puts upon us he
[48:03] does but yet in reality it is well worth
[48:06] the responsibility one of these days you
[48:09] brothers and men just like you around
[48:12] the world that is lives since this
[48:14] gospel has been introduced 2,000 years
[48:17] ago one day you will take your wives and
[48:20] you will take your children which will
[48:23] be grown of course by the hem will all
[48:25] be the same age you will take them by
[48:28] the hand as it were and you will enter
[48:30] into that blessed land and to Eternity
[48:34] and you will walk in there with an
[48:36] awesome responsibility being fulfilled
[48:39] in your hearts and your lives before God
[48:43] and God will look at you men that have
[48:46] faithful and God will reward you
[48:49] accordingly now you may never preach you
[48:51] may never be a missionary you may never
[48:53] do anything like that but yet in one
[48:55] sense of the word you are the pastor of
[48:58] your home you are the one in your home
[49:00] that is supposed to be the head of that
[49:03] home or the house band that holds that
[49:06] home together so what kind of church
[49:08] have you men got there if you're passing
[49:11] your church what kind of church do you
[49:12] have now but whenever we arrive that day
[49:16] and you men will stand there before God
[49:19] and give an account and then your wife
[49:21] can be able to turn and look at you and
[49:23] say God I'll thank you for giving me
[49:26] such a man I thank you for giving me
[49:29] such a man Lord you knew i was the
[49:32] weaker vessel you knew I needed a man of
[49:35] integrity to help me along the way
[49:38] you knew I needed a man that would help
[49:41] me in the land of seeing aids that you
[49:43] chose me to live that would be able to
[49:45] guide me in a man that I could be able
[49:48] to look up to and a man that I could
[49:50] signal or you'll give me a man God that
[49:53] I well I want to stand your guard and
[49:56] thank you for giving me such a husband I
[49:58] believe there's a man sitting here like
[50:00] that tonight I believe it all my heart
[50:04] that's exactly right
[50:06] now with the responsibility will also
[50:09] come the delivery because as Christ will
[50:12] present to himself a bride without spot
[50:15] or wrinkle so were the godly sons of God
[50:19] that marry their mate in time and listen
[50:22] carefully those sons of God that find
[50:25] their mate in time and they married that
[50:27] mate and through that Union together of
[50:30] the election of God their hearts are
[50:32] joined together because their souls are
[50:34] joined together before the foundation of
[50:36] the world they will achieve that type of
[50:38] oneness in this life before they ever
[50:41] walked through the gates of paradise
[50:42] because they have already been deposited
[50:45] in the same timeframe the same church
[50:48] age and they wound up meeting one
[50:50] another maybe one lived in Indiana
[50:52] lived in who knows where that God
[50:54] allowed for their paths across and they
[50:56] came together and there was a tide from
[50:58] the soul and they begin to join and God
[51:00] began to move on their home and begin to
[51:03] give them that something and the man was
[51:05] exactly what the woman needed and the
[51:07] woman was exactly what the man needed
[51:09] they will begin to reflect heaven while
[51:12] they are still here in this mortal body
[51:14] in these five senses the very headship
[51:17] of Christ over the church will be seen
[51:20] in them as the headship of God is seen
[51:23] over Christ men can't you see why well I
[51:26] keep preaching at you and telling you
[51:28] what a great thing that it is for you to
[51:30] send well what a miserable thing that
[51:32] would be that day if you jump and shout
[51:34] and scream and holler and you stand up
[51:37] before God and your wife has to send and
[51:39] say God my man was the weakest thing
[51:41] that ever was he was as weak as a
[51:44] dishrag
[51:45] he was as weak as all get-out a topsy
[51:48] turvy today he's going to make up his
[51:50] mind he's going to serve him next week
[51:52] he don't know what he's gonna do god
[51:54] I'll tell you one thing he added to my
[51:56] burdens what a horrible thing for a wife
[51:59] to say about her husband well praise the
[52:03] Lord oh my
[52:06] now notice what sis then comes this
[52:09] responsibility but Paul makes it clear
[52:12] which many folks miss when they read
[52:15] this both women and men as well in that
[52:19] Paul is identifying a partnership which
[52:23] comes in in view with the headship so
[52:26] there is a partnership that comes in
[52:29] view it's not like a general with our
[52:32] boot camp that he's getting everybody
[52:34] the orders go here and go there
[52:36] my orders are not to be questioned and
[52:38] don't you question me on one thing
[52:40] that's not the way God does us and we
[52:43] know that's certainly not the kind of
[52:44] relationship he wants among his sons and
[52:46] daughters
[52:46] it'll never produce the product of God
[52:49] so many miss the partnership aspect now
[52:53] look at this but my head here tonight
[52:55] contains my brain
[52:56] it contains the base of course of the
[52:58] stem it contains the different
[53:00] peripherals of my brain that control my
[53:02] sight they control so many other
[53:04] but what if I took a knife tonight or
[53:07] one of you did it for me and you totally
[53:08] removed my head from off my shoulders
[53:11] and then you set it down
[53:12] on top of this pulpit here now all of
[53:15] the counter parts by which my head are
[53:18] supposed to move on now detached and
[53:21] there's no way if my head would be able
[53:24] to live of course it could not but if it
[53:26] could live very long at all and I would
[53:29] still be having thoughts finger move
[53:31] foot move or move twist do this that the
[53:34] other there's nothing to be able for it
[53:36] to respond to what is missing the union
[53:40] of partnership or the union of
[53:43] connection by which by blood flow and
[53:46] nerves and systems and all of that that
[53:48] will never comes in your mind within
[53:50] just a half a second or three-quarters
[53:52] of a second then your hand begins to
[53:54] move your arm moves your foot moves
[53:56] whatever it is because the head is
[53:59] setting down on the body so what if the
[54:02] head and the rest of the body is
[54:04] fighting all the time so why you're
[54:07] sending Church you just set there and
[54:08] smack yourself and then all of a sudden
[54:10] you reach over just kicked the far a
[54:12] t-cell and then you just reach over and
[54:14] just grab a hold your big cheek and just
[54:16] paints and paints and pings well I'm
[54:20] gonna tolerate that for a little bit and
[54:22] then I'm on how I'm afraid I'm gonna
[54:24] have to have the Deacons come and
[54:25] dismiss you because you're gonna draw
[54:27] more attention that the word is and I
[54:29] can handle that that be something wrong
[54:32] with you you agree with me well how is
[54:35] it then that folks think that the man
[54:37] being the head that he can be so
[54:39] detached by love by commitment by
[54:42] intimate affection for his life and it's
[54:45] all orders orders orders orders orders
[54:47] it'll never be right
[54:49] there's no partnership that's dwelling
[54:52] among the members what is it
[54:56] dictatorship and that's not what God
[54:58] wants in the church or in the family now
[55:02] god of course designed the woman as far
[55:04] as her body shivers in God's thinking we
[55:07] know that that God was going to do it
[55:09] and he was going to take her we know
[55:11] from the rib out from under the heart
[55:13] designated by that the joint partner
[55:15] bye what's the man what identify
[55:18] himself now the man of course he's a
[55:19] bachelor before he gets married he has
[55:21] his own life his own thing the way does
[55:23] this out the other many men never grow
[55:25] out of that they still have bachelor
[55:28] ways they don't feel like they're
[55:29] responsible to their wife they can do
[55:31] anything in the world I think they want
[55:33] to do
[55:34] everybody in the family answers to them
[55:36] and they answer to nobody wake up mr.
[55:38] Hitler and you claim you got the Holy
[55:42] Ghost you may have a Holy Goose but you
[55:44] ain't got no Holy Ghost
[55:45] the Holy Ghost is subject to the Word of
[55:48] God you ain't got the sense God gave a
[55:49] goose if that's what you think a
[55:51] headship is you are under headship
[55:56] yourself that is the headship of Christ
[55:58] the word a man now as the hair being
[56:05] attached to the body and all these
[56:06] circuitry of course made by God in order
[56:09] to make it work so is it inside the home
[56:12] whenever the man being the head the man
[56:15] himself and the very life flow coming
[56:17] from the brain yet the brain along I
[56:19] cannot be able to make the body live
[56:21] take your kidneys out see how long you
[56:23] live without them take your liver out
[56:25] certain things of course in your body
[56:27] you can live without many parts of your
[56:29] body which are not your brain how do
[56:31] most people know you by your hand or by
[56:33] your head most of you wouldn't even know
[56:37] my hand because you don't get to shake
[56:38] it that often most of you wouldn't even
[56:42] know the hand of your brother because
[56:44] you don't sit that much most of us don't
[56:46] start folks hands but yet what do they
[56:48] know one another the most by their head
[56:51] their face that's the way we know them
[56:53] on occasion maybe their profile or the
[56:56] back of their head but for the most part
[56:58] it is their head but that's not who all
[57:00] they are they are also kidneys they are
[57:03] pancreas they are liver by our
[57:05] gallbladder I've never seen your
[57:06] gallbladder not sure I would care to him
[57:08] but yet that's who you are as well but
[57:11] what is it that I know you barber the
[57:13] Dell it is your face and it's the same
[57:16] way in the body of Christ same way in
[57:18] the home now
[57:19] then that the man gets his physician
[57:22] then it helps a woman to be able to get
[57:24] into hers notice again in verse not
[57:26] neither was the man created for the
[57:29] woman but the woman for the man now the
[57:32] man was not created to be subservient to
[57:35] the warmer that the woman snaps her
[57:38] fingers and the man goes here and goes I
[57:40] said sat down and shut up yes ma'am oh
[57:44] brother Donnie I'm not him Pat and hope
[57:47] assume you men got hen house ways so
[57:48] what's the difference well praise the
[57:52] Lord well hallelujah
[57:56] hey man how does a woman have a say in a
[57:59] home sure she does Paul said she runs
[58:01] the house a ma'am
[58:05] so she have a say she does but yet when
[58:08] it comes to the final decisions made in
[58:10] a home it should be the man and the
[58:12] woman trying to prayerfully be able to
[58:15] consider what's the best for the home
[58:16] what's the best for us as far as what
[58:19] church we're going to you know whatever
[58:21] more in our life
[58:22] let us pray honey let's do this and that
[58:24] in the other that we can be able to find
[58:26] the will of God for our lives God never
[58:29] made the man to be subservient to the
[58:31] woman neither did God to make the woman
[58:33] to be a doormat under the man's feet
[58:37] praise the Lord the man is to defend the
[58:41] woman as a matter of fact if it would
[58:42] come right down to it and they're one of
[58:44] their lives is going to be taken a true
[58:46] man of their lives is why we'll give his
[58:49] life for his wife all brother Donnie I
[58:51] do it I do it well show me everyday and
[58:53] then we'll take care of that at the end
[58:54] of the way okay show me how much you
[58:56] love her just by the way you live to
[58:58] order now yet this was not in the
[59:00] original creation of course in the way
[59:03] that it's going to merge together but
[59:05] yet I to the fall then of God of course
[59:08] introduces the double covenant and
[59:09] introduces polygamy and animal creation
[59:12] how that is brought in and we know
[59:14] because of ant-man's fallen nature that
[59:17] man
[59:18] needed a savior I tried the save here
[59:21] what did God use God in the bread
[59:24] projecting the prophecies of the Savior
[59:26] to come to the earth God never used a
[59:29] man in bringing the Savior to the earth
[59:32] now God did not raise up another Adam
[59:35] and then out of Adam's side bring Jesus
[59:38] to Christ out of head inside but God
[59:40] brought the Christ out of not Eve or
[59:43] Mary's side but out of her womb yet it
[59:47] was not her life it was not in any of
[59:49] her DNA nothing of her whatsoever she
[59:52] was simply just a womb that God borrowed
[59:55] to be able to carry this child is this
[59:56] right not of a blood absolute in our
[59:59] creation of God and out of there God is
[1:00:02] now going to bring the second Adam yet
[1:00:05] it will not be hers in the sense that
[1:00:08] she genetically or by DNA can claim him
[1:00:11] at all but God gave her a seed well if
[1:00:18] you say men that God give her one why do
[1:00:20] you keep phrasing argument with me when
[1:00:21] I say God give you one that's right now
[1:00:26] the woman was made for the man and when
[1:00:30] the man
[1:00:40] you
[1:02:01] or that lace and a little godly woman
[1:02:05] now the man may not be one notice I said
[1:02:09] this if any man obey not the word they
[1:02:13] also may without the word be won by the
[1:02:19] conversation of the wives
[1:02:22] what power that lays in a Holy Ghost
[1:02:25] filled woman well praise God was her a
[1:02:29] woman here that even said a mintue there
[1:02:31] my goodness we want to place it all in
[1:02:34] the man and all on the preacher friends
[1:02:36] that's not all the Bible says now here
[1:02:38] is a godly woman this fill of the Holy
[1:02:41] Ghost that the Spirit of God anointed
[1:02:43] Peter to write about her you do believe
[1:02:45] this that this godly woman now she came
[1:02:48] to reach of course and he doesn't go
[1:02:50] that way but appreciating but he said
[1:02:52] that the man would actually be one
[1:02:54] without the word so the woman is succour
[1:02:58] to god I'll tell you one thing my man oh
[1:03:01] my god you better straighten up to high
[1:03:04] round turning over to the devil
[1:03:05] corner god it's her conversation not or
[1:03:13] preaching I know most of you sisters
[1:03:16] won't act like you don't preach at home
[1:03:18] I don't believe that for most of you you
[1:03:20] most of you're a woman preachers some of
[1:03:26] yous read it's a pickle bit
[1:03:29] now notice this likewise you wives be in
[1:03:33] subjection different word who Pluto so
[1:03:41] put under be subject to submit oneself
[1:03:47] unto to arrange under to subordinate to
[1:03:55] yield to ones admonition or advice my
[1:04:04] lord even the man they say them in their
[1:04:09] now come on brothers even the word we
[1:04:12] use this got your title in it a man we
[1:04:17] don't say a woman that meaning of this
[1:04:25] word is is compound and look at the
[1:04:27] latter part of this a Greek military
[1:04:30] term meaning to arrange troops troop
[1:04:35] divisions in a military fashion under
[1:04:38] the command of a leader in non
[1:04:42] militaries it was a voluntary attitude
[1:04:49] they say the problem of the law the
[1:04:51] message men is that they use them all at
[1:04:54] the military side they didn't use the
[1:04:57] non-military use yes sir
[1:05:01] well sir well praise the Lord but it is
[1:05:11] God's order for wives to be in
[1:05:15] subjection to their husbands praise go
[1:05:21] you know it doesn't mean now that the
[1:05:24] woman is evil and wicked and bad I mean
[1:05:28] some are but I'm talking about Saints
[1:05:31] you know sisters because that she's in
[1:05:35] that position but we see everything in
[1:05:40] the order of God that is made in such a
[1:05:44] way there is only one Sun in our solar
[1:05:48] system yet there are trillions of stars
[1:05:53] and millions possibly or trillions of
[1:05:58] moons we only have one but yet we only
[1:06:03] have one son now if they both were of
[1:06:06] the same luminosity then we could look
[1:06:09] at the moon at night which will be as
[1:06:11] bright as the Sun
[1:06:12] and would be 24 hours of sunlight but
[1:06:16] God made one great light to rule the day
[1:06:19] and the lesser light to rule the night
[1:06:23] and she rules by borrowed light from her
[1:06:27] head so what is the head of the moon the
[1:06:32] Sun because without the Sun the moon has
[1:06:36] no life right so whenever we look at the
[1:06:40] moon whether she's in the quarter cycle
[1:06:42] hype cycle three-quarters or full it is
[1:06:45] all borrowed light from the Sun in the
[1:06:47] way that God put them in order so we see
[1:06:51] the order of God in the universe so God
[1:06:53] only made one Sun and he gave us we know
[1:06:57] that Mars and Jupiter and other other
[1:06:59] planets have their own moons some of
[1:07:01] them have multiple moons but we only
[1:07:03] have one but under the order of God for
[1:07:07] our planet God gave us the Sun as it did
[1:07:10] others in this galactic place where we
[1:07:13] are but yet he only gave us this moon by
[1:07:17] this great reflection which would come
[1:07:19] upon her she's humble she bears only
[1:07:22] reflection of the light she has no light
[1:07:25] within herself if the Sun does not shine
[1:07:28] upon her she remains in darkness perfect
[1:07:32] epitome of a Christian take Christ out
[1:07:35] of our lives we are nothing take Christ
[1:07:38] out of our lives take the glory out of
[1:07:40] our lives who are miserable that's right
[1:07:44] so this is God's protocol so how does
[1:07:47] the moon shine she shines by borrowed
[1:07:51] reflected light from the Sun under whose
[1:07:54] command the command of God and what do
[1:07:56] you see you see the structure of the
[1:07:58] whole so then God making the Sun and
[1:08:01] then out of the Sun coming all these
[1:08:02] clinkers that come out so what come out
[1:08:05] of the Sun he gave birth to his own wife
[1:08:07] which was the moon so then the Sun
[1:08:10] shines upon the moon and the moon in
[1:08:12] turn reflects it back to her the earth
[1:08:15] the dust people on the earth so God
[1:08:18] wrote
[1:08:18] the order of divine protocol of the
[1:08:20] family of God in the heavens before he
[1:08:23] ever had a man on the earth praise the
[1:08:25] Lord
[1:08:26] does that mean that the moon is not
[1:08:28] important you know the moon is important
[1:08:30] whenever the moon turns her back look at
[1:08:33] what the tide does look at all the
[1:08:35] different things that the moon has an
[1:08:37] effect and the way that we plan things
[1:08:38] even you know yourself that one bit
[1:08:41] women are going to have babies you watch
[1:08:43] the cycle of the moon how many babies
[1:08:45] will be born in the full moon you watch
[1:08:47] how many folks who wind up going to the
[1:08:49] middle place whenever the full moon
[1:08:51] comes a friend that's not a bunch of
[1:08:53] wives fables this is scientifically
[1:08:55] proven because the moon has an effect
[1:08:58] upon the earth where she ever takes the
[1:09:01] sons place of course not and she doesn't
[1:09:03] want to she bears this image of the Sun
[1:09:06] in her humble way man has walked on the
[1:09:10] moon man has stepped on the moon but man
[1:09:13] has never stepped on the Sun and never
[1:09:15] will because the Sun would consume him
[1:09:18] man talks about the church man read it
[1:09:21] kills the church and God will allow it
[1:09:23] for so long you know the atmosphere
[1:09:25] being so thin upon the moon that a
[1:09:27] footprint or track print being placed
[1:09:29] upon there by Rover vehicle well I shall
[1:09:32] lay that for hundreds of years and never
[1:09:34] be disturbed because the atmosphere on
[1:09:36] the moon is so still hardly nothing
[1:09:39] moves it's the original footprints of
[1:09:41] the original astronauts are still there
[1:09:43] laying like they were in the early 60s
[1:09:46] when they were made all the Land Rovers
[1:09:48] and things that they write across if
[1:09:50] they're still there the tracks are still
[1:09:52] there because her atmosphere is still
[1:09:55] thin so shallow that mysterious thin and
[1:10:00] shallow
[1:10:01] we need a mighty God we need a big God
[1:10:04] no matter how late we all would still
[1:10:07] moon and we still need the power of God
[1:10:09] on our lives so the moon then reflects
[1:10:12] the woman in the home and the Sun
[1:10:15] reflects the man the moon reflects the
[1:10:17] church the Sun reflects Christ there's
[1:10:20] nothing out icater with that is there
[1:10:21] that's the way God made it does that
[1:10:23] mean the wife is not important she's
[1:10:25] very important you take a Gandhian woman
[1:10:28] out of a home and
[1:10:29] a man try to run the home by himself God
[1:10:31] never intended it to be that way God
[1:10:33] never intended him to be a single mother
[1:10:35] trying to race kids God never intended
[1:10:38] her to be a single father trying to
[1:10:41] raise kids for the Lord God took them
[1:10:43] together from the man and the woman in
[1:10:45] the Garden of Eden
[1:10:46] what's work should come forth in
[1:10:48] children comes after that divine union
[1:10:50] of God now that does not mean that the
[1:10:53] woman is some poor in a wretched
[1:10:55] creature that many folks want to project
[1:10:57] us as the message and let me just be a
[1:11:00] force against that line devil that's
[1:11:02] trying to go around this message anyway
[1:11:04] oh these people that have left it and
[1:11:06] try to project that we make the women of
[1:11:08] the message dogs that is an absolute lie
[1:11:11] and you go to hell for life the women of
[1:11:15] this message they have been given a
[1:11:17] godly and wonderful position they are
[1:11:20] not dogs they are not to be trampled on
[1:11:24] they are to be treated like Queens well
[1:11:31] praise the Lord now in saying that a
[1:11:35] husband's love being so great for his
[1:11:38] wife does not eliminate the woman's
[1:11:41] desire and godly call to be in
[1:11:44] subjection to that husband because his
[1:11:48] love no matter how great it will be it
[1:11:50] never overrides that well my husband
[1:11:53] loves me so much I just do whatever I
[1:11:54] want to do no that's what the layer to
[1:11:56] see in church thinks about Christ they
[1:11:59] think Christ loves them so much that
[1:12:01] they can do whatever they want dress how
[1:12:03] I want live how they want say whatever
[1:12:05] they want drink whatever they want do
[1:12:07] anything they want to do cuz Christ
[1:12:09] loves them so much so you sisters don't
[1:12:11] want to think that while my husband
[1:12:13] loves me so much I'm just free to do
[1:12:15] whatever I want to do no you're still
[1:12:17] under the subjection word and that home
[1:12:20] of what God gave you praise the Lord
[1:12:24] now notice again in 1st Peter chapter 3
[1:12:26] verse 2 while they behold your chase
[1:12:30] conversation I remember a lost husband
[1:12:33] or maybe a husband out of fellowship
[1:12:35] with God but this
[1:12:37] woman has such power in her but the Holy
[1:12:40] Ghost that the husband may not hear the
[1:12:43] word he may not want to actually go to a
[1:12:46] church and sit down and hear some
[1:12:48] preacher preach but if there's anything
[1:12:50] reachable in that man's being do where
[1:12:53] God can grab a hold of him
[1:12:56] then it may be through this channel of a
[1:12:58] godly why does that sound like a
[1:13:00] powerless individual to you does that
[1:13:03] sound like an individual to you that
[1:13:05] ain't got no position in God and those
[1:13:07] serve while they behold your chaise
[1:13:11] conversation coupled with fear whose
[1:13:16] adorning let it not be that outward
[1:13:19] adorning of plaiting the hair and
[1:13:22] wearing of gold or of putting on of
[1:13:27] apparel now notice this this is an
[1:13:30] important thing of course in that day as
[1:13:33] it is today and that is the adorning now
[1:13:36] you will notice of course that Peter
[1:13:38] directs the adorning toward women and
[1:13:41] not men now today of course he could do
[1:13:44] it toward men since we've got men's
[1:13:45] salons where men are going and getting
[1:13:48] their fingernails done and their
[1:13:51] toenails you pervert you don't know
[1:13:57] which side of the house you belong on
[1:13:59] men having makeup for men lipstick Rouge
[1:14:06] oh let me get off that's why I get sick
[1:14:12] whose adorning now notice this how that
[1:14:17] Peter do you believe that the early
[1:14:18] apostolic church believed in holiness
[1:14:21] what kind of holiness did they believe
[1:14:23] in God's holiness I'm not interested in
[1:14:26] man-made holiness no I'm not I'm
[1:14:28] interested in what God terms as
[1:14:31] wholeness I notice who's adorning let it
[1:14:34] not be that outward adorning that we're
[1:14:36] talking about a godly woman a woman who
[1:14:40] has power in her life by which she would
[1:14:44] be able to influence an unconverted man
[1:14:46] what about a man
[1:14:48] that is saved and maybe just refilled
[1:14:50] with the Holy Ghost if a woman a godly
[1:14:53] woman could have such an impact upon a
[1:14:55] man that's not even saved what about a
[1:14:57] woman having an impact upon a husband
[1:15:00] this may be not worrying needs to be
[1:15:01] with God but she'll never be it by
[1:15:04] trying to take his place now you see it
[1:15:08] seems odd but in the submission of a
[1:15:11] beloved on its heart I struggle in my
[1:15:13] husband he does this it does that he
[1:15:15] does something else
[1:15:16] sister God God understands how you
[1:15:18] relate to a man that's not living the
[1:15:20] right kind of sisters husbands are not
[1:15:22] serving the Lord they're not Christians
[1:15:25] and maybe some is not really where they
[1:15:26] need to be but remember you are the
[1:15:29] position they hold even if you cannot
[1:15:31] honor the man that's in the position
[1:15:33] because of the life that he's living
[1:15:35] like our president oh god what have we
[1:15:38] gotten the White House oh my goodness
[1:15:40] you never know what in the world that
[1:15:41] man is going to say ever one way gets
[1:15:44] worse than the last one and you think it
[1:15:47] can't get no worse but that's what we
[1:15:48] are friend but to me the leaders in the
[1:15:51] White House reflect the nation itself
[1:15:53] why do we have that type of leaders in
[1:15:55] Congress and mayors and all that because
[1:15:57] the people themselves are of the same
[1:16:00] caliber of people that's right no I'm
[1:16:03] glad you didn't lost evidence the truths
[1:16:04] anyone now whenever then God empowers
[1:16:07] not only a man's lie but a woman's lying
[1:16:09] he gives her the ability by the Spirit
[1:16:12] of God to find her position and work as
[1:16:15] well as she can under the condition that
[1:16:18] are existing in the home even ever had
[1:16:21] to deal with this of course and other
[1:16:22] godly sisters don't because her husbands
[1:16:24] are serving the Lord consecrated to God
[1:16:26] but they're on the element of women who
[1:16:28] do I don't in our church but basically
[1:16:30] everywhere around the world
[1:16:31] so aren't you glad God gave you a word
[1:16:34] sisters aren't you glad that God gave
[1:16:36] you a word something that would help you
[1:16:38] to know what do I do
[1:16:40] and then Peter goes not just to the
[1:16:43] position of the woman and being
[1:16:45] subjection but he actually comes to the
[1:16:48] outside and then bounces back to the
[1:16:51] inside and he identifies her position
[1:16:54] spiritually by the way she dresses
[1:16:58] oh my goodness now I realize in the age
[1:17:02] we're living in focusing the way you
[1:17:04] dress while you wear your hair is and
[1:17:06] all that sort of thing it don't have
[1:17:08] nothing to do with you well they need to
[1:17:10] read their Bible Dante whose adorning
[1:17:12] let it not be that of the outward
[1:17:14] adorning of plaiting the hair wearing a
[1:17:17] goal or putting on of apparel now the
[1:17:20] Apostle now refers to this desire which
[1:17:23] exists in a woman's heart now is that is
[1:17:27] that wrong no no it's not wrong whenever
[1:17:31] it is disciplined in the way of the word
[1:17:34] now it is wrong whenever a woman will
[1:17:37] desire to dress like the world and look
[1:17:40] likely to see it
[1:17:42] you sell woman that smells like a
[1:17:45] polecat never combs her hair and she
[1:17:47] thinks she's humble she hopefully she
[1:17:52] stinks
[1:17:54] that ain't humility it's ignorance well
[1:17:59] praise the Lord
[1:18:00] but Paul our dinner Peter rather
[1:18:02] identifies this as an adorning an
[1:18:05] ornament an ornament so it is something
[1:18:11] that is added to what is already there
[1:18:15] identified as an ornament or unadorned
[1:18:19] it it is something to commend them
[1:18:23] something that will speak of their
[1:18:26] character so then you take the worldly
[1:18:28] things of Laodicea and put them on a
[1:18:32] daughter of God's face or a daughter of
[1:18:35] God's body the clothes that they would
[1:18:37] want put them out on the street it is
[1:18:39] not a commendation to that daughter of
[1:18:42] God but it is absolutely contrary to
[1:18:45] their very testimony that she says that
[1:18:47] she is a daughter of God because it is
[1:18:50] an ornament all right which is perfectly
[1:18:53] fitting for a bunch of blond Laodiceans
[1:18:55] but it's just not fitting to a daughter
[1:18:57] of God well praise the Lord
[1:19:00] come on our brothers y'all been waiting
[1:19:02] for this at least squeak or peep or
[1:19:04] something so I know you're with me now
[1:19:07] this desire
[1:19:08] is lay deep and the nature of most women
[1:19:12] it's actually in the human nature
[1:19:14] therefore when it is properly regulated
[1:19:17] by the Spirit of God it is not
[1:19:19] necessarily wrong within itself but each
[1:19:22] one must find that place to where that
[1:19:25] God helps send that they're not adorning
[1:19:28] to learn that they look like that you
[1:19:30] look at a church member and you look at
[1:19:32] the world and you can't see no
[1:19:34] difference because they're adornment
[1:19:35] it's exactly the same and may I say it's
[1:19:38] the same way for you Mia I've seen a boy
[1:19:41] yesterday with a pair of breeches on
[1:19:43] that was so tight the only way I can
[1:19:46] figure that he got into it his mama must
[1:19:48] have melted him on top of the stove and
[1:19:50] apart and poured him down inside them
[1:19:52] britches at the end part I could figure
[1:19:56] out how he's gonna get out of him I
[1:19:58] didn't understand it at all I mean
[1:20:00] they're so tight down on his leg it look
[1:20:02] like I've hit a mood he's busted them
[1:20:04] britches
[1:20:05] I saw you big praise the Lord
[1:20:13] God meant for men to dress like men I
[1:20:16] got men talk like men and smell like a
[1:20:20] man praise the Lord
[1:20:25] but yet God does not condemn a true
[1:20:29] ornament now notice in the way that
[1:20:31] Peter ties all of this together now
[1:20:34] people have taken this for years and
[1:20:37] years and say well you know the Bible
[1:20:39] says that the Bible speaks against
[1:20:41] priding of the hair no the Bible does
[1:20:43] not speak against plaiting the hair well
[1:20:50] I figured they'd go over about that girl
[1:20:53] if the Bible speaks against planting of
[1:20:56] hair the Bible speaks against putting on
[1:20:58] clothes so we're all sent into not we
[1:21:00] should strip off planting of the hair
[1:21:06] wearing of gold or putting on of apparel
[1:21:09] so if you take Peter now let's take him
[1:21:11] in the way that you're thinking that
[1:21:13] he's saying it then it's wrong for us to
[1:21:15] work clothes we'll go from the skirt
[1:21:19] church to the streaking church now God
[1:21:26] actually now listen to me carefully
[1:21:29] God loves righteous adornment the
[1:21:36] universe is full of it
[1:21:40] now think why didn't God if God does not
[1:21:45] like variety and if God does not like
[1:21:49] sparkle and Sheen and tinted colors why
[1:21:53] does not every vegetable exactly the
[1:21:56] same color why would not they be a dull
[1:22:00] drab green why are some yellow some
[1:22:03] orange some of the ones I've seen in the
[1:22:05] different parts of the world you'd never
[1:22:07] believe them the exotic fruits and
[1:22:09] vegetables that hang on a tree and our
[1:22:12] Father gave them that pigmentation and
[1:22:15] the outside may be red and the inside be
[1:22:18] black the outside may be red or the
[1:22:21] inside be orange and yet you look at the
[1:22:25] way that God made them what does that do
[1:22:27] does it change the flavor it does not
[1:22:29] the pigmentation of the meat on the
[1:22:32] inside or the pigmentation of the skin
[1:22:34] on the outside would not vary the tastes
[1:22:37] on the inside if it went from one end of
[1:22:40] the spectrum the light spectrum to the
[1:22:42] other what is it for ornamentation and
[1:22:45] God loves to ornament and adorn his
[1:22:49] creation so God is not God is not
[1:22:52] against ornamentation what God is
[1:22:55] against is against ornamentation used to
[1:22:58] use to try to implement what's here on
[1:23:02] the inside
[1:23:04] now da are there some things that are
[1:23:06] wrong with himself absolutely
[1:23:08] you can't run Mary Kay through
[1:23:10] sanctification and get her clean no way
[1:23:13] you can't take lipstick and try to save
[1:23:16] it and baptize it and give it the Holy
[1:23:18] Ghost the Holy Ghost won't go in
[1:23:19] lipstick it just won't do it there are
[1:23:22] some things you just can't save you
[1:23:24] gotta throw them away but there are some
[1:23:28] things that aren't necessarily wrong of
[1:23:31] themselves but it's what the doer will
[1:23:34] use them for and how it will become
[1:23:37] wrong because of how much they use it so
[1:23:41] it's not that it's wrong it's sell in
[1:23:44] small quantities but it's when they load
[1:23:47] up like they've been through a dime
[1:23:48] store with a magnet oh now look at God
[1:23:53] in the universe of how that he did you
[1:23:56] know Miguel was driving the other day
[1:23:58] and I tell you one thing right now I
[1:24:00] love this time of year with all the
[1:24:01] flowers and trees don't you everything's
[1:24:04] so beautiful and we were starving at
[1:24:06] Virginia and I going up and I took I
[1:24:08] said look at all these greens going up
[1:24:10] through the Roanoke Valley and then come
[1:24:11] up to the Shenandoah Valley you don't
[1:24:13] come on up through Washington DC and
[1:24:15] Baltimore going into New Jersey and on
[1:24:17] and on and on up to New York and it's
[1:24:19] saying all the different hues of green
[1:24:21] and you look and there's an oak and it's
[1:24:24] green but yeah you look at a walnut
[1:24:26] standing by but Shinra comes out later
[1:24:28] than the old it'll be another green and
[1:24:30] there's a pine and there's a Norwegian
[1:24:32] spruce and there's this and then you
[1:24:33] look at the grass and you look at all
[1:24:35] the things that's around and why didn't
[1:24:37] God make it all say black and white God
[1:24:41] just make every bit of it black and why
[1:24:42] why do you do that because that's not
[1:24:44] the way God does so God wanted to give
[1:24:46] each its own ornamentation by which it
[1:24:50] would be on me now you take human beings
[1:24:51] and look at their now God could have
[1:24:53] made every one of this if it's so
[1:24:55] designed with it all look the same no
[1:24:57] matter who her parents were so it all
[1:24:58] looked the same so you'd be number eight
[1:25:00] billion three hundred and forty five
[1:25:01] thousand but you look like to all
[1:25:03] previous eight beyond they live before
[1:25:04] you but yet God didn't make us that way
[1:25:07] so each of us have our own skin
[1:25:10] pigmentation and then you take a person
[1:25:12] whose skin Pig
[1:25:13] Taoiseach is the color of mine me and
[1:25:15] Carol hold Hansel art and I'll hold her
[1:25:17] hand and she'll hold mine and will have
[1:25:19] her hands one on top of the other and
[1:25:20] you know we look at one another and I
[1:25:22] tell her I said you know in reality
[1:25:23] we're the colored people us white folks
[1:25:27] oh yeah here I go because we are so many
[1:25:33] colors and you get one that's a little
[1:25:36] bit darker and one that's a little bit
[1:25:38] lighter pink and one that's a little bit
[1:25:39] more why and you look at us how varied
[1:25:42] that we are not look at people's eyes
[1:25:44] and God could have made the eye so they
[1:25:47] would have been very plain and bland
[1:25:49] they would have had no sparkle no
[1:25:51] shimmer no shine to them but God instead
[1:25:53] of doing that God gave color to the eye
[1:25:56] so when you would look at somebody in
[1:25:58] the face that they would either have
[1:26:00] hazel or brown or blue you know I mean
[1:26:03] some of the folks I've seen around the
[1:26:04] worlds and you just get mesmerized by
[1:26:06] their eyes do you think wow what need
[1:26:09] eyes they just have the neatest eyes and
[1:26:12] then God didn't just add the color but
[1:26:15] God added a sparkle into every human
[1:26:18] beings are this born proper so God
[1:26:20] placed it where that it would be there
[1:26:22] it would be constantly being lost and it
[1:26:25] would add a little sparkle or a little
[1:26:27] twinkle now does the twinkle help you
[1:26:29] see better does it help you rebate er it
[1:26:32] is ornamentation what does the color do
[1:26:35] ornamentation what does that what does
[1:26:38] the different color of your lips being a
[1:26:40] different color from your your nose or
[1:26:42] your forehead now why did God do that
[1:26:44] ornamentation of your face so why did
[1:26:47] God make us and whenever something would
[1:26:50] be said or something like that that we
[1:26:51] would brush oh I did God make it to
[1:26:54] where it was this part of your head they
[1:26:56] were blessed and sit at the back nobody
[1:27:01] would have seen it so God allowed the
[1:27:04] capillaries to gather in a more
[1:27:06] condensed form right here in the front
[1:27:08] part of your face so that whenever but
[1:27:10] do that and then that rosy colored part
[1:27:13] inside of our cheeks what's it for so
[1:27:15] make you smarter doesn't makes you a
[1:27:17] more intelligent person because you've
[1:27:18] got more natural roses in your cheeks
[1:27:20] and someone else ornamentation so God
[1:27:23] places it inside
[1:27:25] of his creation God did the animal
[1:27:28] kingdom
[1:27:28] the Botany kingdom the flowers the trees
[1:27:30] God made every one of them in the same
[1:27:33] order so the heaven ornamentation so
[1:27:35] does God get mad at human beings when
[1:27:39] they try to embellish who and what they
[1:27:42] are well that depends on what they're
[1:27:45] embellishing with praise the Lord if I
[1:27:52] didn't know better I think some of y'all
[1:27:53] got a makeup problem you're getting
[1:27:55] cried on man now I would expect this if
[1:27:58] I was preaching down the road or over
[1:28:00] there over here but now the human
[1:28:04] complexion is an ornamentation of the
[1:28:07] creator himself we know that and God
[1:28:09] actually crowns that by the nature it is
[1:28:13] an ornament of nature that God gives to
[1:28:16] every one of us so it is not to make
[1:28:18] them more beneficial it's not to make
[1:28:21] them more useful but it is actually an
[1:28:24] ornamentation that is added to the looks
[1:28:27] you could see without the color of your
[1:28:29] eyes you can talk if your lips this is
[1:28:31] pale his brother Charlie's pants there
[1:28:32] you could still talk perfectly fine of
[1:28:35] course unless your hemoglobin so low
[1:28:36] that you can't even you know early
[1:28:38] breathe but as far as what's most of
[1:28:40] that added to us for because God wanted
[1:28:44] us each of us type and ornamentation and
[1:28:46] yet Peter is not speaking about that but
[1:28:49] he's speaking about and mainly with
[1:28:51] women that would fight the Battle of
[1:28:53] them trying to take on a worldly
[1:28:56] additive that would be added to what
[1:28:59] they are now what is the sparkle in your
[1:29:01] eye it is a super added ornamentation by
[1:29:05] the hand of God that makes a brighter
[1:29:08] luster in your appearance
[1:29:10] what is the shaded on your lips or the
[1:29:12] the pigmentation of your skin what is
[1:29:15] that does it make it any better it is a
[1:29:17] super added ornamentation given by the
[1:29:21] hand of God does it make you function
[1:29:23] better absolutely not
[1:29:24] take it out you'd function just as well
[1:29:26] without it but it is an
[1:29:28] ornament ation by God to the animals to
[1:29:31] these to the Stars who all this
[1:29:34] everywhere you look around and you will
[1:29:36] see that so God Himself it's not against
[1:29:38] that one it is used the right way but
[1:29:41] Satan found out that the desire special
[1:29:44] in the women is there for them to add
[1:29:46] ornamentation so he'll try to get them
[1:29:49] to add something that's a little bit
[1:29:51] questionable or something that they know
[1:29:54] is just find out wrong but they think it
[1:29:56] adds to who they are and it makes them
[1:30:00] more attractive or makes them more
[1:30:02] appealing well I guess that depends on
[1:30:05] who you're trying to appeal to well
[1:30:09] hallelujah now the appearance of course
[1:30:13] is a very important thing we knows that
[1:30:16] it is to God whenever we get to heaven
[1:30:18] it ain't going to look like the Bronx it
[1:30:20] ain't gonna look like you know some
[1:30:22] place in Philadelphia where you wouldn't
[1:30:23] want even want to take an armored car it
[1:30:25] ain't gonna look like that I mean it's
[1:30:27] gonna have quite an appearance you
[1:30:29] believe that streets of gold gates of
[1:30:31] pearl walls of Jasper I mean so what you
[1:30:32] want that's a pretty impressive palace
[1:30:34] but yet what Peter is now emphasizing
[1:30:38] and Paul did exactly the same thing that
[1:30:40] the ornamentation should be accompanied
[1:30:43] what's on the outside should testify
[1:30:46] from the inward virtue and character
[1:30:48] that's on the inside what's his got to
[1:30:50] do the subjection well a woman might be
[1:30:53] subject to her husband that you know the
[1:30:55] husband's headship as we call it and she
[1:30:58] never buffs against him and does this
[1:30:59] and not in the other but yet her
[1:31:01] ornamentation is pried her ornamentation
[1:31:04] is excessive jewelry her ornamentation
[1:31:07] is constantly drunk on clothes oh my
[1:31:10] goodness
[1:31:10] and she iced out the latest fashion and
[1:31:12] the this and that and the other and if a
[1:31:14] sister in church walks into the same
[1:31:16] dress she got on from TJ Maxx she'll
[1:31:18] never wear it again now that's the
[1:31:24] vanity of a woman a man looks and says
[1:31:27] good not you got all my shirt what where
[1:31:30] are you doing wiring Marshall a woman
[1:31:34] blushes a woman oh my god
[1:31:37] had been heard and walked I think I'll
[1:31:42] go home I won't be able to get a fan out
[1:31:45] of a service don't sit and look at me
[1:31:50] like I don't know how women think
[1:31:52] sisters I'm married to one I've got two
[1:31:59] daughters and a whole bunch of grand
[1:32:01] young uns it's all women now Peter says
[1:32:08] let it not be in the outward adorning
[1:32:12] let this not be the main or principle
[1:32:15] saying that your heart is set on not
[1:32:19] notice Peter does not say that the woman
[1:32:22] should never comb her hair that she
[1:32:24] should never clean herself up even make
[1:32:27] herself presentable for her husband
[1:32:34] praise God I used to know a woman down
[1:32:40] in Kentucky I won't call her a name list
[1:32:45] some of her family was to hear me but it
[1:32:49] didn't make no difference what time of
[1:32:52] the day or what day of the week you went
[1:32:56] to her house he's always going to find
[1:32:59] her and the same attire and it was
[1:33:04] actually gonna be the same one
[1:33:07] her housecoat and her house shoes
[1:33:11] I believe that thing was so nasty she
[1:33:16] could stand it up in the corner and it's
[1:33:17] standing salute
[1:33:30] praise the Lord now you imagine what
[1:33:35] this does for a woman raising girls or
[1:33:38] boys the home you're raised in has a
[1:33:44] great deal to do with the kind of man
[1:33:46] you choose or kind of woman you choose
[1:33:53] now for many they think it's humble if a
[1:33:57] woman don't call my hair and don't use
[1:34:01] deodorant and don't spiff up a little
[1:34:05] bit it ain't a spiffing that gets you in
[1:34:10] trouble it's what you sniff with
[1:34:18] neglecting personal appearance is not
[1:34:21] humility
[1:34:22] it's misunderstanding God now you don't
[1:34:27] have to go you know and buy the very
[1:34:29] best of this and that and the other but
[1:34:30] you can't wash what you were now I'm
[1:34:34] gonna tell you some whiz raise poor my
[1:34:37] daddy never had a great paying job so is
[1:34:40] raised poor I wore blue jeans to school
[1:34:45] with holes in them but at the time I was
[1:34:48] wearing them they wasn't in style
[1:34:56] you got me now they take them out on a
[1:35:00] dirt Benten somebody stands out there
[1:35:02] and this is their occupation they stand
[1:35:05] out over the shotgun and blow holes in
[1:35:08] them blue jeans and sell them for 125
[1:35:12] dollars a pair and I felt embarrassed
[1:35:16] but the same every day I went to school
[1:35:18] were and man I do wear tennis shoes that
[1:35:23] was not in rke they were dollar store
[1:35:27] specials now today they're cool to wear
[1:35:31] them but I was lying them when they
[1:35:32] wasn't cool so everybody that looked at
[1:35:36] me laughed at me
[1:35:37] I very few friends in school because
[1:35:40] we're so poor so the rich boys would
[1:35:43] always come around me and ridicule me
[1:35:45] and make fun of me my clothes wasn't
[1:35:48] fancy but my mama kept them clean praise
[1:35:55] the Lord
[1:35:56] our bathtub was not six-foot long
[1:36:00] covered in fiberglass it was galvanized
[1:36:04] and a circular form and y'all know what
[1:36:11] I'm talking about few of the older folks
[1:36:13] do that was our bathtub we didn't have
[1:36:16] running water we had a sister I was the
[1:36:21] oldest so I got mine first so I got the
[1:36:23] clean water and that got home from Harry
[1:36:26] on down God have mercy no telling what
[1:36:28] they got but my momma never let us being
[1:36:34] poor convince her we had to smell like a
[1:36:38] bunch of polecats going to school pray
[1:36:42] so long well hallelujah did the odorant
[1:36:49] department in Walgreen will be sold out
[1:36:50] by midnight you see friends for those
[1:36:55] who feel like for a man to comb his hair
[1:36:59] oh brother Donnie's got so much brat
[1:37:04] just have everyday brush my teeth
[1:37:10] multiple times take a shower use
[1:37:16] deodorant oh I'm gonna smell like a
[1:37:20] racehorse and I get done preaching but
[1:37:22] now I'm gonna smell nice when I come out
[1:37:27] praise the Lord
[1:37:28] oh is it
[1:37:33] God made the children of Israel wash
[1:37:36] themselves and washed their clothes
[1:37:39] before they even come to the mountain
[1:37:41] where he was that's our God well praise
[1:37:48] the Lord
[1:37:49] now is that wrong nope that ain't wrong
[1:37:53] within itself
[1:37:54] now you know God God has an order zone
[1:37:58] now what's the way Peter lays this out
[1:38:00] we'll find a place to enclosure shortly
[1:38:01] whose adorning let it not be the outward
[1:38:04] adorning of the planting the hair and
[1:38:08] wearing of gold or of put him on apparel
[1:38:12] so if you're gonna preach against
[1:38:13] planting on her hair you gotta preach
[1:38:14] against wearing clothes notice this John
[1:38:19] Gill said of planning the hair folding
[1:38:22] it up in curls now for those of you who
[1:38:26] feel like holiness is just a modern-day
[1:38:28] invention of william branham john gill
[1:38:31] lived in the 1600s folding it up putting
[1:38:36] it in curls tying it up in knots putting
[1:38:39] it into the form of horns and towers
[1:38:42] horns would be very fitting probably for
[1:38:45] some oh hey man putting into the form of
[1:38:48] horns and towers made by their crisping
[1:38:52] pins with their coals and round
[1:38:55] tires like the moon as with the custom
[1:38:59] of those times and still is now there
[1:39:04] were women among the Jews whose
[1:39:07] occupation was to plant women's hair in
[1:39:11] great extensive ways actually the woman
[1:39:14] Mary Magdalene
[1:39:17] this was her occupation not just where
[1:39:21] she lived Magdalene is a hair platter no
[1:39:29] wonder she had Seven Devils now think of
[1:39:33] it she would have been a modern fashion
[1:39:37] woman in a salon or a spa or whatever in
[1:39:40] that day beautifying women now not an
[1:39:46] adornment by which a woman would make
[1:39:48] her hair pretty but constantly trying to
[1:39:51] outdo their neighbor let's stand
[1:40:01] let me read you this the women in
[1:40:03] Eastern country says dr. Shah travels
[1:40:06] page 294 effect to have their hair hang
[1:40:10] down to the ground which they collect in
[1:40:14] one lock up on the Honda part of the
[1:40:17] head binding and fighting it about with
[1:40:19] ribbons above this or on top of their
[1:40:22] heads persons of better fashion wear a
[1:40:24] flexible plates of gold or silver
[1:40:28] variously cut through and engraved in
[1:40:32] imitation of lace now you imagine they
[1:40:37] would have these gold and silver strips
[1:40:39] that would be cut through to look like
[1:40:42] lace and that take their hair which
[1:40:45] would lay down on the ground and they'd
[1:40:47] we've all this stuff through their hair
[1:40:49] and wear it up like a pentecostal do now
[1:40:57] was the long hair wrong no but the way
[1:40:59] they were doing it was an adornment
[1:41:02] which was wrong and you know what
[1:41:05] happened in the first church age them
[1:41:07] some of them grill old fashioned
[1:41:09] Pentecostal first church women started
[1:41:13] doing some of the same things so the
[1:41:16] rich message folks started taking gold
[1:41:19] and platinum into theirs and silver and
[1:41:20] Peter and Paul both had to strike again
[1:41:24] sadness and no sisters don't do that
[1:41:26] the people look at you and you look just
[1:41:28] like the world sure fix your hair pulled
[1:41:31] it up comb and let it grow out we're at
[1:41:33] wrong but don't do what they're doing
[1:41:34] don't look like them because they
[1:41:37] they're competing one against another
[1:41:38] one against another and this ins hairdo
[1:41:41] cost so much and this one's called
[1:41:43] summer I've got five thousand dollars
[1:41:45] worth of gold in my head you better be
[1:41:47] careful walking and Lizabeth and Walmart
[1:41:49] with that you'll come out without a head
[1:41:54] what was it competition oh my goodness
[1:42:00] the illusion here see the excessive care
[1:42:03] which will then prevail and especially
[1:42:05] to their setting the heart on such
[1:42:07] ornaments
[1:42:08] rather than on the adorning which is
[1:42:10] internal thin plates of gold were often
[1:42:13] mixed with the hair to make it appear
[1:42:16] more ornamental
[1:42:17] by the reflection of light now can you
[1:42:20] imagine what these women must have look
[1:42:22] like in that day here they got all this
[1:42:24] gold and silver and all this metal in
[1:42:26] their hair out on the Mediterranean Sun
[1:42:28] there were no clouds and stuff like we
[1:42:30] note here good night it must have been
[1:42:32] something like a runway in Atlanta you
[1:42:36] come this woman and here was another man
[1:42:38] that was another and that was another
[1:42:40] you get him hardly look at him what was
[1:42:42] it all for
[1:42:43] pride ornamentation and some of the
[1:42:48] sisters start doing the same thing well
[1:42:52] praise God more little foxes I guess
[1:42:57] small golden buckles were also used in
[1:43:01] different parts and among the Roman
[1:43:02] ladies pearls and precious stones of
[1:43:07] different colors there is a remarkable
[1:43:10] passage in park conjugal ah precept
[1:43:13] Plutarch was a first century scholar and
[1:43:16] philosopher and ornament as kratie said
[1:43:19] which was also a poet is that which
[1:43:22] adorns the proper ornament of a woman as
[1:43:24] that which becomes her best there is
[1:43:27] neither gold nor pearls nor scarlet but
[1:43:30] those things which are an evident proof
[1:43:32] of gravity regularity and modesty it got
[1:43:37] so vain by the gym that the poet started
[1:43:40] reading now this guy wasn't a preacher
[1:43:42] he wasn't Paul or Peter but from the
[1:43:45] social circles of poetry
[1:43:48] they started rebuking it themselves
[1:43:54] praise the Lord
[1:43:57] don't you love him
[1:43:59] you appreciate the tres
[1:44:09] it's about hits together Heavenly Father
[1:44:15] we thank you tonight for your mercy we
[1:44:18] thank you Lord Jesus that you would
[1:44:21] share such things with us I realize the
[1:44:25] majority of Laodiceans would laugh and
[1:44:27] ridicule and make fun of this from
[1:44:29] probably than from the very five minutes
[1:44:31] from after reading my scripture from our
[1:44:33] opening comments to the very end they
[1:44:36] would think what an ignoramus it's that
[1:44:40] man a complete idiot an imbecile yes
[1:44:44] mother standards I would be but we
[1:44:47] believe Lord God that this Bible still
[1:44:50] carries through to the rapture we don't
[1:44:53] think it's outdated we don't think it
[1:44:55] needs to be updated we think it needs to
[1:44:58] be made flesh and our hearts for both
[1:45:02] men and women boys and girls I pray
[1:45:08] you'd help each of us father maybe we
[1:45:10] have some here tonight Lord that's
[1:45:12] single we know we do some that's
[1:45:14] divorced something that the companion is
[1:45:17] going on before them but each of us
[1:45:20] father can take that which we've heard
[1:45:22] tonight let it be applied to our life in
[1:45:25] the area Lord that we need it father God
[1:45:29] we desire to meet you that day and
[1:45:32] you'll be able to look at us and
[1:45:35] there'll be nothing on our record
[1:45:38] that'll speak against us Lord Jesus Oh
[1:45:41] search our hearts father search us
[1:45:45] married men let us make sure that in our
[1:45:49] home we have real headship no
[1:45:52] dictatorship let the women who comb
[1:45:57] their hair and fix themselves up and do
[1:46:01] all they can with the natural
[1:46:02] ornamentation that you've given them
[1:46:05] help them father that it does not become
[1:46:07] an element of pride Lord but they know
[1:46:13] their boundaries and their limitations
[1:46:16] help us I pray father each of us
[1:46:19] as we rub shoulders with this whole
[1:46:22] world that we don't become contaminated
[1:46:25] with its filth keep us clean keep us
[1:46:30] true keep us washed Lord Jesus we love
[1:46:36] you tonight father we commit the word
[1:46:38] and the hearing of the word back into
[1:46:42] your presence Lord and we know that it
[1:46:44] will not return unto you void well it
[1:46:46] will accomplish that which you've sinned
[1:46:48] it for oh we love you Jesus praise be to
[1:46:53] God thank you Lord Jesus how many of
[1:46:58] your sisters married unmarried younger
