grace and his Mercy that he wanted to extend to us greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus certainly counting a great privilege for us to be able to be together to get today and once again see what the Lord will say to us and do for us in this hour of terrible spiritual Darkness that's on the earth we're grateful that we're still able to walk in light are we not let's turn to the book of Hebrews if you would today chapter 3. 3 Hebrews chapter 3. wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus the Apostle and high priest of our profession look at the meaning of this word profession it means confession subjectively it means whom we profess to be ours what one professes or confesses so he is the Apostle and the high priest of our profession so the word simply means to say the same thing now just give you a little bit of a background where Paul was coming from when he wrote this that there was in the days of the high priest and there was the regular priesthood which was of the levitical order but the high priest alone could go in on the day of atonement to make atonement for the people of God so he went in one time a year you would go in and out in and out in and out seven times on that particular day before he would go in the Elders of the Sanhedrin which was the overseeing body of the Jews they would come to him and they would tell him great apostle and messenger of God you are going into God's presence to represent us so they would Place their faith and confidence in this man that he had lived the right kind of life and that he would be able to represent them before God so Paul has taken from this now he tells us we have an apostle and a messenger In God's Presence so as they confessed and profess that he represented them so we confess our lord Jesus represents us and verse 2 who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house I made love to be remembered today as we pray have a need a request desire in your heart Lord Jesus we profess first of all today that you are our high priest we do not come to a man we do not come to a system or a church but we come to you today we believe that you represent us in heaven therefore we bring our needs our desires our requests before your presence right now we're asking great Apostle great high priest of God that you would mediate for us today not only just as we pray but as we Endeavor to break your word and open it up may you mediate on our behalf open to us the scriptures open to us your word for we know out of the word comes the abundance of power to help us to live the right kind of life we can quote the word 24 7. but if the power in the word is never released to us it doesn't do us a lot of good so help us today mediate on our behalf speak to us father as only you can do we commit the hearers of the word the speaker all of it into your great charge today in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated I know that you already are aware of it but until he came there was never a priest like the Lord Jesus it was forbidden by God's law for any of the Kings of Israel to ever cross the line of being priests and King in the same position we know that Uzziah got in great trouble with God because he tried to do such there were several different ones down through the Jewish history that did so they tried to mix both King and priesthood now to you may look and think what was such a big deal the big deal was God was going to be the first one and the only one that would be able to do this so whenever we are able to look at our lord Jesus today and know that he is not only our King but he is our mediator he is the one that intercedes for us whenever we are sick Afflicted weary whatever it is that we have need of he's the one that can do it it is the merging together of the Divine slash human high priest there was never such on the earth before a high priest all of them of course were human but he was the first one to be divine and human at the same time in order to bridge the gap so that once he ascended back into the presence of God even though he was glorified and deity had embodied him again he would never get away from the human memory of experiencing what humanity is really like I'm so grateful for that today I know you are too turn with me to Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens now unlike abiathar unlike Aaron unlike any of the other priests that ever existed through the Jewish line none of them could ever Ascend into heaven now there was a foreshadowing of this of course in the Old Testament and when Abraham met the great Melchizedek who was the king of Salem which was Jerusalem and it was we know God in the form of a theophany that appeared theophany in form of a man and it was something that was a mystery and it had been for thousands of years until the end time when it was revealed but here Paul is emphatica now remember the title of this book is the Hebrews so it was to Hebrew people that had become converted by the new birth you imagine what a struggle that some of them must have had that accepting a man like Jesus now for you and I we look back through through 2000 years and we know who he was but can you imagine being there a Jew in that day a Hebrew in that day and or you heard about where this guy was born you actually went around by the cave where his mother gave birth to him you went by the house where he was raised you went by the place in Capernaum where he had preached in the synagogue by this time it had not yet been destroyed you went by Peter's house which is just a stone's throw from where the synagogue was compared him we stood there a few years ago and they found it just a few years back and they dug around and actually found Peter's house where Jesus went in there in Peter's house and laid his hands on his mother-in-law and she was healed and you saw the boats that it actually stood on to fish in and then in your mind you've got to accept the fact that this was actually God in a human form it must have been a very difficult thing unless of course you had the Holy Ghost so this letter whenever you see the setting of it that was actually written to Hebrews people that had been their whole life under the influence of Moses their whole life under the influence of the prophets and the Torah and now they're trying to accept that some man that had walked among them was that Mighty God of the Old Testament so Paul wanted to make sure that by the spirit of God he covered every aspect that God would give him so now he goes again into the order of the high priest and he said seeing that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God notice he doesn't refer to him as Jesus the son of Joseph because he wasn't Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession now here we have a high priest that has passed into the presence of God and because we have that now let us hold fast hold fast best our profession or confession to who the Lord Jesus notice now let us hold fast our profession so verse 14 does not say let us hold fast our holy ghost or let us hold fast our Salvation or let us hold fast our favorite Church seat or our favorite church pew but let us hold fast our profession why would we need to hear these words because there's going to be many things that's going to try to take our profession away from us now what will our profession be it will be our confession and who we believe that he is and who we are in him you understand now it's more than just saying well I'm a Christian I believe the Lord I accept the message of the hour I believe I'm going in the Rapture anybody can do that mentally and that never Strike their soul but the type of profession that we must hold fast is the one that God himself has revealed to us by the Holy Ghost and once that is there even though we have it we still must hold on to it why because symptoms sickness all types of negative things around us will do its best to take it away from us anybody ever lost that oh yeah you know you can imagine now that he would write to them and say let us hold fast that profession so it has to do with the believer's testimony of what he believes that Jesus is but it also has to do with what the believer believes that he is in Christ Jesus now the Jews in the Old Testament were a type of this in that they wandered through the Wilderness for 40 years and God the Bible tells us that God actually LED them a different way now there was a more direct past that would have led them straight away to the promised land but if they would have went straight away from Crossing out of Egypt straight by the way the crow would flies would say they would have went more direct they could have been there in a very short time but had they went that way it was the most civilized trade route in the known world at that time so they would have fought the most tremendous battle so the Bible says that God LED them another way lest they would become discouraged in the way because of War so God LED them the long way around and they thought why are we going this way no doubt some of them knew the trade routes they knew the shortest path to this land and it could not understand they couldn't make no sense out of the whole scenario why would God lead them way around this way he did it for their own good and I'll tell you there's times he leads you and I the same way and we try to contemplate it figure it out and just be honest with me today most of the time we don't we just say I don't understand I don't understand but if you could look out there he's got a giant he's sparing you from he's got another trial he's sparing you from and it's actually for our good that he's doing it this way but it doesn't always tell us that he wants us to trust him so what the Jews lost as they were in this transitory time and they're moving from the land of Egypt into the promised land what they lost was their confession they lost their confession that the god that brought them out of the land of Egypt the god that gave them the token under the administration of the Prophet Moses that same God was going to lead them to the land but what left first their confession he's forgot us he's not with us anymore where is he we can't find him we can't see him we can't feel him what did they lose they lost their confession now remember the prophet tells us that God never left them but they left him but it had to begin with in their heart before they would physically leave him so word was one of the first aspects that they left him they left him in their confession that he loved them that he cared for them and he brought them out with a mighty hand and if he brought them out You See Redemption actually has two parts and the first part is coming out and the second part is going into a person can believe God can bring them from The World God can bring them from a life of drinking and a life of drug addiction on the life of all kinds of things and many people accept the Lord Jesus on that basis but they never go any further all they do is just confess well he's my savior He's My Savior and I love him and I no longer belong to the devil but they never become a disciple they never go any farther in Christ Jesus don't you understand the right the Rapture is for those who are not just saved from sin it is for those who become one with Christ Jesus in the word now you realize that for for the children of Israel they could testify things most of us have never even seen in our life the Miracles that God did in the land of Egypt had never been done before and have never been replicated exactly like they were then and they could stand up and have a testimony meeting boy didn't we see God do something God done this and God done that and God done something else and yet they began to get away from their confession that they believed that God that brought them out could take them in so where did they run into issues believing that God had brought them out no believed in God would continue to take them in I wonder if some of us aren't in the same place today oh yeah he saved me from sin I was lost I used to drink I used to do this and that but I I just don't know if he can take me on in or not I just don't know if he can finish this work if you're not careful there's where you will lose your confession I'm struggling with this and I'm struggling with that I it didn't bother me when I was a sinner of course not you was a hog in the pig lot you was eating slop you was eating junk you was eating all kind of old trashy things that matched your nature and now you've come out of that but don't lose your confession in Christ Jesus how many believes the same God that brought you out can bring you in well if he came he said puny God I'll tell you that this morning but they begin to lose their confession I want you to notice in the pogos on to say in Hebrews 4 15 we have not an high priests which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities again look at this word weakness disease sickness want of strength feebleness of health or sickness or of the Soul now can you imagine in order for him to be a high priest that could be able to understand people of infirmity he himself must also become infirm so Jesus became sick Jesus became weary Jesus became oppressed I hope you understand this Jesus actually allowed himself to feel depressed he allowed himself to feel the depths of sadness and heartache and sorrow you understand that he must feel infirmity to help the infirmed now you know no matter how great a person can quote the scripture and quote the word I I don't necessarily if I'm in the time of need and if I'm really going through something and I want somebody to pray I don't really care if they're a theologian or not I don't care if they can quote the scripture word by word and tell me all the diphthongs of the Greek and they can quote the Aramaic and tell me where the word comes from what I want is somebody that can touch God now you know yourself if you've ever had anything in your life those of you that's had kidney stones or say cancer you go through something there's something about having that yourself or your wife or your daughter or your children it changes your view from that point on anytime you hear of anybody having that it touches a part of you that was never touched before come on say Amen you know it's the truth because it does something to you well that's the way God had to become himself he had to become that he knew it because he knew all things but he never experienced it until he experienced it in the Divine human relationship that he did in Christ Jesus so then we have a high priest himself who was infirmed and felt sad and felt lonely you imagine how disappointed Jesus must have been in the apostles how many ever been disappointed with friends family members loved ones sure we all have can you imagine how disappointed the Lord Jesus was in his disciples how disappointed he was in people that he loved and that he tried to lead them to the truth and and that they're fussing and arguing along the way because they're trying to figure out who's going to be the bishop when Jesus is gone who's going to be the big man when Jesus is gone you're talking about disappointing oh my some of the greatest disappointments that I experience as a pastor as a servant of God it's not from Sinners out here I expect him to run me down I expect them to talk about me I expect them to do all kinds of crazy stuff but what becomes so heartbreaking and disappointment to me is people who say they love you Christians who say they love you you know what I'm talking about it's like we don't expect very much from the Sinners that we work with and go to school with but what breaks our heart the most when Christians will sneak around behind our back and talk about us or betray us or whatever you know what I'm saying then what does that do say I thought they was a Christian I thought they was a brother I thought she loved me I thought he loved me can you imagine the disappointment that Jesus must have felt in people so when you and I feel that way we have a high priest that we can go to we can just be honest with them and say Lord I don't understand my sister said this my brother did that Lord I need your help before he come to this earth he could not relate and say I understand Dave I understand I understand what you're going through but now when you go to him he can answer back and say I know exactly what you feel why because one of my preachers actually sold me out to the Sanhedrin it was one of my preachers that I anointed one of my 12 closest Apostles that I called them and chose them that forsook me and betrayed me I understand how you feel notice and again in Paul whenever he says this let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain Mercy how many needs Mercy that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need don't friend get in your mind that the only time that you need Grace is associated with sin no do we we limit God so much when we think well the only reason I need Grace is whenever I've sinned and done wrong no you need Grace every time you have a need what you notice Paul does not put this just about repentance of sin but he says find Grace to help in the time of need as a matter of fact the more I look at this the more I realize I need Grace every day of my life I need Grace to overcome I need Grace to live right I need Grace to forgive I need Grace when I need forgiven you understand so we find Grace to help in the time of deed watch again in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 13. Paul said let us hold fast here he goes again with the same words let us hold fast the profession and again the word whole there means to take by or be powerful to be chief be master of so God wants us to be master of our profession or our confession so God don't want circumstance or events or what people say or even your mistakes or your failures to be the master of your confession well I'm nothing but a failure I'll never amount to nothing I'll never go on the Rapture they don't need me at the church nobody loves me nobody even speaks to me I ain't no good I guess I'll just quit do you understand somebody else has got a hold of your tongue well come on now but Paul said what you need to do is be the master of your confession I wish somebody would say Amen be the master to rule to cease to lay hands on in order to get one to get him into one's power so God wants us to lay hands on our mouths lay hands on our confession lay hands on our profession and say shut up shut up that negative stuff God saved you God Sanctified you God give you the Holy Ghost he loves you he cares for you you have value you have worse oh my now remember this is definitely not mind over matter but there is a truth to the understanding of the psyche now this may Blow Your Plum out of your Pew today or your seat but the prophet uses this word psyche because the people in his day actually thought that he was a mind reader so he would be able to stand up and tell the people that they lived on this certain address there's three steps going up to your apartment where you live I see your address 2309 West so and so you want to adulter Heaven said God wore glasses he told you this and that and the other you can imagine the people thinking this guy's a witch I mean this guy's nothing but he's just a sorcerer or something like that so he had to use this word citing and explain to them that it's exactly a part of our being that God made us that way and oh it'd be wonderful if we lived under the anointing 24 7 but we don't do it we don't always overcome under the anointing as a matter of fact most of my overcoming is without them anointing without feeling one thing but I'll stand on the word whether I feel it or whether I don't but yet our mind what we feed on what we the appetite the diet that we feed into our spirit is much of what we become and lie now you say brother Donnie here you go and that mind will partner that mind over matter no it's not mine over matter notices the prophet says it this way God can't do nothing till you first confess that he is now I want you to notice how your confession actually is tied to what the Lord Jesus does and says about you in heaven now remember he is our high priest so we want to go to him this morning as the Sanhedrin did to the Old Testament high priest and we want to lay at the feet of our high priest our confession and say this is what we believe you are to us and this is what we believe we are to you now we want you to act on our behalf now remember this is what the high priest would do so they would come oh Apostle of God messenger of God we believe that you're going into the holy place you will represent us now remember he walks in there with the ephod on him he walks in there with the breastplate on him the breastplate actually was something that was worse or like a vest something like this except it had 12 stones are close to here four rows of three it was a birthstone of the Twelve Tribes of the children of Israel so they would have their names engraved on each one it was when the light of God would shine upon that stone it was the urum thumum so the light of God would shine upon it and the supernatural colors would reflect from the high priest's heart because the light of God shined on this and the mixing together of these Stones which is the foreshadowing of the city you're going to live in then when the rainbow colors come back it was showing that Israel was God's covenant people so he walked in there representing them so their name was on his heart their name was on this Stone so here was issachar zibulan Judah Levi nephtalia all the different ones they couldn't go in there themselves but they went by representation so their names was under the trial every individual name was not there but every name that was identified in the tribe of naphtali or Judah or issachar or whoevermore you was identified if you was a Jew under that birthstone praise the lord well if God could do that in the Old Testament what about the Lord Jesus he did not wear our names on a vest as it were he did not wear our names on and he fought but he said your names are engraved in the palm of my hand so when he goes before Spirit God he goes by representation to represent every one of us that's the kind of high priest we have today now what is he going to say well the high priest would walk in there on the day of atonement and he would say oh Lord God oh Yahweh I don't die I come here today to represent your people I bring this Blood of the atonement please forgive your people one man is repenting for the whole nation One Man by representation has the right to stand before God and if there's two million people standing outside of that Tabernacle two million people that believed that one high priest prayed and every one of their sins were forgiven in an instant by the prayer of one man oh Hallelujah if a high priest could do that what can the Lord Jesus Jesus do for us today but you see they must believe they had to trust they had to believe enough they try to figure it out my mind now how is that even possible how can one man go in there and represent me and Scott and everybody else and that one man is going to pray and I'm going to be forgiven how is that even possible they probably couldn't figure it out no more than we could but they had to believe it and they had to confess it I believe I believe when that high priest goes in there I am forgiven I believe when he walks in I don't understand it I don't understand how it works but I believe when he walks in there my sins are annihilated so their profession much match his office I want you to listen to this I hope you understand that some of these modern day guys that preach this positive confession stuff this is being preached before some of them as ever preachers in order some of them got it from a prophet of God oh they'll never tell it but that's why they got it notice God can't do nothing to you first confess that he is then when you confess it then believe it act upon it stay with it and God will bring you out notice again he said now he's the high priest of our confession you get what I mean what you confess you are that's what you are now the Lord Jesus will never match your confession in heaven if you're saying I'm defeating I'm no good there's no way out I'll never get through this I'll never be victorious I'll just barely hang on from one service to the next you do not have a high priest that Echoes In Heaven Before the Throne of God that type of testimony so when you're saying that he's saying nothing is that what you want do you want one you are praying to him that he can't even respond because your testimony does not match his thought of you so his thought of you is you're a conqueror you're more than a conqueror his thought of you is you are one of his attributes he loves you before the foundation of the world but you're saying something totally opposite so he cannot Echo your confession in heaven because you're not saying what he thought you're saying what you think not what he thinks oh praise the Lord now I want you to notice this any man will never live any further or any higher than what he believes he's living so you'll never live any higher than what you believe you're living again he says remember he can never do nothing for you until first you say he's done it oh brother don't in my marriage is enough to shape every voice and my my wife she's gone too far this time I'll tell you one thing my husband has gone too far I'll never be able to forgive him do you know what just come out of your mouth you'll never be able to forgive him or forgive her never is a long time you must say I'm struggling to do it and I need God's help that's one thing but don't never say never don't never say I'll never go to church again I'll never I'll never I'll never if you're going to say never say it this way I'll never again testify of the devil I'll never again let the devil control my confession I'll never again let Satan lie to me and me take that is who I am [Applause] isn't it amazing we're not very good at those Nevers we're so good at never forgiving and never this and never that but when it comes to the devil it just seems like it's natural for us to never never never but remember the Lord Jesus can never do nothing for you and the first you say he's done it believe him and accept them and testify to you know that he's the high priest of what confession now he quotes the scripture we just read Hebrews 3 1. now he's standing at the right hand of the father to make intercession Upon Our confession so he's not setting there to make intercession upon what he wants the Bible says he is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but we'll all come to repentance why because God wants them to go to hell because God wants him to see he wants to see him burn in a lake of fire no it's not his will it's not his desire it's not his purpose that the biggest drama the biggest liar the biggest whatever out here in Johnson said it's not God's will that that man or woman go to hell and burn and burn and burn that's not God's will but why do they not receive it because they well I came to her I've been to church and I've seen a bunch of Hypocrites I agree there's a bunch of Hypocrites in church but everybody in church ain't Hypocrites and if you let the Hypocrites stand between you and God they're closer to God than you are oh yeah there's a lot of Hypocrites there's a lot of folks that don't live it but that ain't got nothing to do with me that ain't got nothing to do with you there's Hypocrites but we just move right around them and we keep serving God with all of our hearts now about hypocrites ain't nothing but a scarecrow to try to keep you from eating butter beans what you need to do is do lots of little groundhog dead when the prophet was out there planting butter beans in his garden and he would plant them out there and the groundhog would come to and eat them he'd go back and plant them again the groundhog would come to down and eat him so he put out a scarecrow and he put that scarecrow and boy it scared the little that little groundhog for a bit but after a while he got used to it so it would Rattle and make faces and he got to where he'd just go right around him well that's what you and I need to do with Hypocrites liars whoremongers and whatever more why can you believe so-and-so goes to church over there well right here's a good place for so and so to be changed right here's a brother Donny there's people that come to the church that drink and don't do right don't you think I don't know that but I figure they're better off coming here than they are to a bar on Sunday morning the better off coming yeah well somebody preached with me today they can get their lives changed here they can get their souls changed here by the grace of God ah now notice he said he's before the father to make good anything that we confess in the Redemptive blessings of course so you mean God Almighty can't do anything for me until first I say he can do it wow now remember it isn't how much you cry it is and how much you repent it isn't how loud you can cry to God it is and how sincere you can be it's how much Faith you have when you come to it he doesn't save you on the merits of your prayer he doesn't save you on the merits of your righteousness he saves you upon the merits of your faith it's by faith are you saved and that through Grace well to God I I live right I don't cut my hair and Lord I don't cheat and I don't lie Lord I need heal so I want you to heal me on this basis I pay my God that ain't the way he heals you he heals you on the basis of your face and his promised word and then you start telling him what you believe by your stripes I was healed can you imagine Isaiah writing such a thing he writes that hundreds of years before the Lord Jesus ever died and Isaiah puts it in the past tense and by whose stripes we are healed he put it in the past tense before the present tense ever declared it oh you say you people are crazy well if we are we're enjoying the blessings of God you know imagine Isaiah writing that brother Scott and saying before the Lord Jesus ever died by his stripes we are already healed a real believer in faith and the promise of the word they can have every symptom they can be dealing with all types of negative things but down inside of their heart their confession is still by his drops I am healed but you got a terrible headache by his tribes I am healed but you still ain't got your voice back this but by his stripes I am healed But Eric because you're still dealing with symptom but by his child I am already healed those of you sitting here today fighting this and that and the other by his strike I am already healed the work has already been done that's my confession now high priest go into the presence of God and repeat what I say [Music] we've heard it preach for decades the opening of the word the third poll speaking the word well here's your chance forget squirrels I don't need squirrels I need healing I need Deliverance forget me controlling the lightning and the Thunder I don't need that I need wisdom to guide God's people and it's strange oh hallelujah how many understands what I'm saying oh my god listen to this friend how he Narrows us down he can't do nothing nothing for you until you confess it nothing for you until you confess it as ever for he is the high priest of conjunction of your confession he can do nothing you can confess me before men I'll confess you before the father what you say I've done here for you that's what I say the father that you that I have done for you so what you say on earth when it aligns with his word he says it in heaven Before the Throne of God on your behalf not just that you're forgiven this is not just for folks getting saved this is not just for green Christians young converts that's just come to Christ how can a sinner know these things to get saved he can't but this is for people that's been saved and people that should be Disciples of the Lord and then you're saying well the blessings have slowed down since I got saved he wants you to grow up he wants you to learn how to manifest what he's called you to be and he wants you to learn that he reciprocates in heaven with you so your conversation on the earth can be repeated by the Lord Jesus Before the Throne of God can you imagine the Lord Jesus wanting to take your words be for Father God he's not wanting to send the Lord Jesus oh Jesus please heal me oh Jesus oh Jesus that's when you got saved but now that your son or daughter of God he wants you down here in the middle of Hell in the middle of battles in the middle of trouble so quote his word and then Jesus Lord God he's the high priest you get that young man to hear the prophet speaking to a young man the other Scott of need you get that young man the high priest of your confession setting to make intercessions on my confession I have a right to confess that he's done anything for me that's in the Redemptive blessings there you are he can can't do nothing for you until you first confess it he's a high priest of your confession not his don't you understand yourself Santa they are mine they are mine I claim them I love them I forgive them I died for them that's already been settled but he's waiting on us you imagine day in and day out brother Paul he says give me something children give me something to take before father today sister Judy give me something that I can't give me something young people that I can tell father let me Express to Father your faithfulness your brother Daryl prayed for you but give me something that I can tell father so I can tell father you're still holding fast to your professor tell me something to tell him oh I'm down I'm weary I'm no good I got prayed for yesterday and my symptoms is worth I don't know if I'll even go back or not so you give Jesus all this to say and Jesus says absolutely you're saying Lord what's going on he said repeat that I cannot say that praise the Lord listen to this believe us now this he cannot intercede for you until first you confess it's already done by faith for he is the high priest of your confession not the high priest of your salvation not the high priest of your mercy not the high Priests of your oh I got the Holy Ghost praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost but he's the high priest of your confession well he said how often should I do this however often you need it four times a day 40 would probably be more like it or 400 . hey look we're going to say something okay we're going to say something most of us have got a mouth and we know how to use that tongue in our fat mouth and we say so much negative stuff and so much something ain't worth nothing if you're going to put a bunch of stuff on Facebook why don't you put your confession on that I'm saved I'm Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy Ghost it may not look it like like it now but I am a complete Overcomer in Christ Jesus it may look like this disease has gotten my body but I want everybody to know by his stripes I am already healed it may look like I'm a loser but a whatever devil in hell to know I am a winner and Jesus Echoes it in heaven you hear that father he is a winner she is healed she is delivered and Jesus is a high priest of your confession go imagine when you give him that he says give me more give me more give me give him I can say on your [Applause] [Music] he's the high priest of your confession setting at the right hand of the father making good what you're confessing now that's the same thing it is about healing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings that's hard to do when you've got a headache that's nearly blinding you right you got a migraine or you got this or that or the other and you're dealing with it it seemed like it's about to get the best of you but renounce something in the middle of pain speak to your body and say in the name of Jesus I am healed [Applause] you imagine the Lord Jesus and papa father did you hear that she's so sick she can hardly stand it he's holding his head he's in such pain did you hear what he said he renounced his feelings he renounced his anxiety some wonder how many days the Lord Jesus ain't had a whole lot to do as far as some of us is concerned you're just sitting around you know what you waiting on I'm waiting on Donnie I'm waiting on John I've been on Janet I'm waiting on Keith what you waiting on him for I'm waiting on him to give me some good stuff to say I'm waiting on Esther I I I'm waiting on Mike I'm waiting on Harry I'm waiting on Daniel I'm waiting on my sons and my daughter around the world give me something to work with Youngs give me something to work with don't let him set up on Heaven aisle but give him something to work with thank you glory to God the same thing by healing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings it's not by feelings it's by faith say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed associate with those who believe in healing amen associate with those who believe in healing I like to associate with those that believe in a supernatural God I like to associate with those that believe God still heals the sin and God still perform Miracle come on friends I don't want to associate with a bunch of people they'll say well oh don't do it no more I ain't gonna hang around them long well we can't have Revival entire day oh yes we can we can have a bride's Revival which is not just emotion but it annoys you to live a life that lines up with the word say your heel believe you're healed act like you're healed associated with those that believe in healing and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of Hell's who will not fail I want you to list this next one when you confess him and he confesses you well you said you think I would have thought he'd have better things to talk about in heaven than me there is nothing anymore he wants to talk about than you so can you imagine when we're confessing him he's my healer he's my savior he's my deliverer and while we're confessing him he's confessing us boy I'll take one thing if I was the devil I guarantee I'd try to take y'all's confession away from you I try to get you all to believe there ain't no power in your words I try to get you all convinced oh that's just an old worked up old preacher is all it is he's just all beside himself it ain't got nothing to do with me it's got something to do with God's word this is the same prophet of God that God worked with in Supernatural signs and wonders that has never been anything like that on the earth he didn't just come with Miracles he come with a message this is part of the message this is what separates us from the rest of the church World a message to get us out of here don't you understand why the bride is going to be so different going on the Rapture she's becoming the word as you feed on the word you walk by the word every day you confess the words you live the word and you talk about the Rapture well if there is one I won't be a don't you never say that the Rapture is for you the Millennium is for you the future home is for you and God will pull you into it by his power when you confess him and he confesses you he's a high priest working on what not on your crying not on your repenting not on your face wow you can have all the faiths in the world but if you keep your mouth shut about it Jesus don't work on your silent faith he works on your confession he's a high priest working on what not on your crying not on your repenting not on your face but on your confession no matter how much Faith you got it'll never do you any good till you put works with it for facts without works it's that he cannot heal you or cannot save you or do one thing for you until first you accept it and believe it and confess it a be see accept believe confess what does ABC produce salvation sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost healing from cancer healing from malaria you see malaria yeah malaria I've told you about it before years ago when I was there in Kenya under a big tree Heaven church and the spirit of God moved for a young man there that had malaria you know I think about the doctors you know they'll tell you once you have it you'll never get rid of it but that ain't what God Said that young man believed that's white preacher from America running around under that big tree tell him that he's the same yesterday today and forever you know what happened to that young man God so healed him that he didn't leave any sign of it even inside of his body to this day as a matter of fact that young man has started preaching the gospel and he's not got anything from him the other day wanted to testify and said thank you for preaching the truth because I am alive today and preaching to others and I got a YouTube video to where this brother was have been witnessing of the power of God why he chose to believe God's report are you going to believe you're oncologist are you going to believe your high blood pressure doctor or your blood pressure your doctor or are you going to believe what Jesus said by his stripes I am healed by his power I am delivered free it's marijuana yes you can I can't get free of alcohol yes you can if you'll come to the Mighty God and go to confessing his word [Applause] Hebrews 3 1 said he's the high priest of our confession in other words he makes intercessions Upon Our confession what we confess that he is that's what he confesses that we are you got to be kidding me so I confess him and he confesses me I confess what he is and he turns right around and confesses what I am you ain't getting that are you you're not getting it it's just like it goes into your mind and some of y'all suddenly your brain's just jumping around like this having you know these all I don't know how can that be how can that be it's too simple it is very very simple but if God will open our hearts this morning we'll walk out of these doors different people then we came into those doors we can walk out of their River don't feel it you'll say whether I feel it or whether I don't by his stripes I am healed whether I feel it or whether I don't I am more than a conqueror hell is not going to stop me the devil is not going to stop me I am one of the spoken words of God [Applause] laughs what we confess that he is that's what he confesses that we are brother sister I'm down through somebody's notes Here go down your past quote but I don't know what to say

listen to is take what they're saying don't make them a God don't make them and I don't say oh how great how great how great how great you think that's what they want you think they want you to idolize them and make them some great big honor you you'll make God bring them down before you just like it will me if you do me that way the greatest thing you can do for me is take what I'm preaching and fight the devil with it I don't want you to be reaganites we don't want to be followers of men well this is my passion this is no we want to be followers of Jesus Christ the word let's put our heads together praise the Lord Heavenly Father wow what great things Lord Jesus huh I pray that it should help each of us father we can take these things and ponder over them think about them meditate on them Hallelujah we know that sheep many times a real feeding Shepherd will give sheep much more than they can ever eat in that service and they say oh I couldn't get it all I couldn't get it all of course it's designed that way it's designed so they will go back and ruminate and feed and feed and feed days and weeks and months here we are Lord still ruminating on sermons some of these quotes I read here today started in 1949. 1950 1951 1953 said all of those years ago but the Holy Ghost made them so real to us today wow we're still ruminating on that anointed word help us Lord Jesus forgive us father for dwelling in the realm of negativity being so down some people the only type of criticism that they have they don't have constructive all they had is destructive everything is negative they don't have nothing to do good to say about nobody no preacher of the church instead of come and saying wow what a beautiful place to I don't like the way they painted that ceiling black I don't like to call it that carpet on the platform why in the world they put two screens and they set turn pick and pick and pick well Lord if we're going to pick I'd like to pick dig around all the dirt and round all the mess around us and find them golden nuggets that are buried down in God's word amen so I can be a better man a better Christian a greater Overcomer Lord God in my life we love you today Jesus I wonder I'm on all for prayer for those of you that's visible and those of you that are home or wherever you are in your office streaming the service wherever you might be Greenland Iceland Switzerland France South Africa wherever you are around the world you'd like to be remembered today sit right there in your home you visible here you say God remember me I'm sorry Lord Jesus I've not been confessing you I'm sorry I didn't realize there was such power there I pray you'd forgive me help me to be different after today would you mind laying your hand on the person standing near you let's pray together as a congregation today you visitors in our gates we welcome you too of course we want your heart to be ministered too as well now heavenly father is a group of believers we agree together We Believe Lord that what we've heard is the truth we don't want it to be that it'll go in one ear and out the others we say James called him forgetful hearers people that hear it but they don't really apply it to their lives we don't want to be that kind of people Lord I pray you would help us begin with me recreate my thoughts recreate Lord God that which I was born with in this negative world fed it to me since a child we don't even have to learn it really it's in our nature but Lord God would you help us today we're not designed to be great as far as the world is concerned most of us will never be on the who's whose book but we do want to make your who's who we want to be identified as your children but we don't want to just be saved and constantly live at the foot of the cross I know some people think that is such a great description to describe a Christian but we know that John was the only disciple as far as we know that was there to see you die at the cross but yet Matthew wrote more about it than John did the other gospel writers and why didn't John just write one chapter after another after another after another that John wrote about the cross but he also wrote about election and he wrote about the mystery of God and he wrote it wrote about so many other things because John didn't stop at the cross he knew the cross was the bridge to Eternity so father we don't want to stop at the cross Lord God we want the cross to become a bridge to Eternity for us and Eternity involves the word so it opens up all the things we need in our lives and Heaven consists of the word help us today Jesus we love you father hear our prayer now Lord God I pray in Jesus name and the Saints said a band from Kentucky there were certain vernacular that I picked up of being a Kentuckian one of them was that when you was a little boy especially and if you said words that you weren't supposed to say now I never had this to happen to me too many times but it happened enough where I didn't want it to happen again but Mama one time I said something and it wasn't bad words but it was just some smart mouth that I said to her she said little boy you're going to get your mouth washed out with soap we didn't have dial we didn't have antibacterial that smelt and tasted like lavender but on special occasions we used lie soap some of y'all don't want him I'm talking about do you how many knows what a lot of soap is all right some of you well it didn't take too many times now you say brother Donahue mean literally literally so she put your mouse over a wash pan and she gets that live soap real soapy and sticks that soap in your mouth and washes your mouths out nope I didn't see no words laying in that dish pan when she got done any all Ever Had it happen to you brother Paul has all right some more okay praise the Lord but today they'd call that child abuse but I'll tell you it taught me a lesson that I wouldn't take a million dollars for it today so actually what just happened in this service was the Lord Jesus had me grab shall we all by the back of the neck and hold your mouse over a pan of washing of the Water by the word and put the soul for the word of God in your mouth [Applause] and wash your mouth out with the soap of the word saying something brother Harry don't you love him Saints don't you appreciate his Mercy to us how
