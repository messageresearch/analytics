[3:55] that it is a tremendous privilege to be
[3:58] in church wonderful opportunity God has
[4:00] given us once again to come into his
[4:02] sanctuary to worship Him in spirit and
[4:05] in truth good to see all of you this
[4:07] morning look at somebody and tell them
[4:08] you're glad to see them we got some
[4:13] unhappy people in this church this
[4:15] morning I don't hear many voices at all
[4:17] if you have to move this house somebody
[4:20] you're glad to see them do that praise
[4:24] praise the Lord take a man it's good to
[4:28] see you

[4:31] see you god bless you good to see you
[4:34] sister Janet good to see you
[4:36] military good to see you it's good to be
[4:38] in the house of the Lord
[4:39] a man we've got several prayer requests
[4:41] this morning you can be seated while we
[4:43] look at those brother Daniel done if
[4:45] he's in the building today I want him to
[4:47] come be getting ready to lead us to the
[4:49] Lord in prayer as we pray over these
[4:51] things today but the burning young since
[4:57] this prayer request and I read a couple
[4:58] requests this morning just absolutely
[5:03] well they just get next to you if you
[5:06] just think about in a second this is one
[5:08] of them have a student at Happy Valley
[5:13] High School who is in dire need of a
[5:16] miracle in his life he is an adopted
[5:19] foster kid who has been emotionally and
[5:22] physically abused by his adoptive parent
[5:25] the authorities have intervened and are
[5:28] working on the case I would ask that
[5:30] everyone pray for this young man he has
[5:32] a great kid
[5:33] and he is a Christian so we certainly
[5:36] want to pray for that need that the Lord
[5:38] would just be mindful then here's
[5:40] another request I read this morning
[5:41] please pray for a fourth grader a fourth
[5:46] grade student at Happy Valley just got
[5:49] out of Woodridge talks about killing
[5:52] himself all the time
[5:53] very troubled young man you reach stuff
[5:57] like this where's mom and dad where's
[6:01] the parents that most of them don't even
[6:06] care about stuff like this
[6:07] so we got it we're living in a very
[6:09] troubled world we're living in a world
[6:12] that's vastly quickly quickly turning
[6:15] into a world of hate love is gone love
[6:20] is not existed it's a world filled with
[6:22] hate so we just need to pray for
[6:24] situations like this that God would be
[6:26] mindful also just thinking about you
[6:30] know brother Doug Baker of the Assembly
[6:31] learn to some where they're having the
[6:33] meetings for the Donnie brother Darrell
[6:35] some of the brothers I don't know who
[6:37] all was there but some of the folks is
[6:38] gathered there for those meetings you
[6:41] know they was able to rent a place to
[6:43] have the meetings but you know after the
[6:46] meetings over military reality is really
[6:48] gonna set in they still got to have a
[6:50] place in the days and that and the times
[6:53] that lay ahead you know we need to pray
[6:55] for that assembly that Pastor that God
[6:57] would just be mindful of them and that
[7:00] God would help them in their situation
[7:02] provide them with a good place to
[7:04] worship and to have church they take
[7:06] you've come together or not be afraid of
[7:08] what's going to happen because we're
[7:10] just we're in that place in the world
[7:12] and this time that as I said it's just
[7:15] it's just a lovely not a lovely place to
[7:17] live a man want to remember the family
[7:21] of Jack little check he was killed in a
[7:26] motorcycle accident on Thursday of this
[7:28] week so we want to pray for that family
[7:30] that the Lord would just comfort their
[7:31] hearts be with them they'll be receiving
[7:33] friends at Appalachian funeral home
[7:35] tomorrow evening at six o'clock until
[7:38] 7:00 and then the memorial service for
[7:40] Jack Lynch XO Lester remember let's
[7:43] remember those those folks as we pray
[7:45] today but afraid since this into please
[7:49] remember Pastor John what's that last
[7:52] name riah and family from Indiana they
[7:56] bought land where their church is so
[8:00] that they could have more services and
[8:03] they have had death death threats
[8:05] because they preach
[8:07] the message of this hour so just another
[8:10] example of where we're at in time God is
[8:13] mindful of us and he loves us and I'm so
[8:15] glad for that aren't you sister Judy
[8:18] dire needs prayers for digestive
[8:20] problems very weak she is unable to be
[8:22] in the service today so we wanted to
[8:23] pray for that need the Lord would be
[8:25] mindful want to pray for mama King this
[8:28] morning it looks like that she may be
[8:30] going home at any time just want her to
[8:32] be comfortable and to remember Papa King
[8:35] at this time as we pray so that family
[8:37] as they get ready to embark on this
[8:40] season of their life may God help them
[8:42] may God be with them this sister Shama
[8:47] sends this in we want to give the the
[8:49] good Lord our praise and thanks for
[8:52] healing my sister of a stroke a couple
[8:56] of weeks ago from being a non-responsive
[8:59] to be able to walk thank the precious
[9:02] Lord Jesus so we thank God for that
[9:04] testimony this morning continue to pray
[9:06] for sister Laura wakow and her family as
[9:09] she lost her mother this week so we
[9:12] certainly want to pray that God would
[9:13] comfort that family be with him during
[9:15] this time but the Keith Phillips has a
[9:18] spoken prayer request that he would like
[9:20] for the Lord to to work out and for you
[9:22] folks to pray help him pray about I'm
[9:26] asking for prayer for he that I've had
[9:28] discomfort in my heart for about two
[9:30] weeks really not sure what it is your
[9:33] prayers are greatly appreciated till we
[9:36] meet live Estrada sins that in so let's
[9:38] remember that prayer requests as we pray
[9:40] today please pray for Nadine Patterson
[9:44] of Dyersburg Tennessee very sick she's a
[9:46] true believer God knows the needs so
[9:49] with this ask the Lord to move on that
[9:50] behalf brother Chuck sieminski offers
[9:53] this testimony I want to thank the Lord
[9:56] Jesus for his Healing Touch brother joel

[10:02] tooth and this morning I don't have a
[10:05] swollen face I don't have a swollen eye
[10:07] and I don't have any pain and he wants
[10:10] to praise the Lord for that so praise
[10:11] God for that test
[10:16] for the Rob Weber and family says that
[10:19] his mother Barbara is having surgery
[10:22] tomorrow for nerve pain requests for
[10:25] God's will and mercy during that time so
[10:27] let's remember that prayer requests
[10:29] Daniel Willis is fighting migraine
[10:31] headaches he woke up with one this
[10:33] morning by the West since that end so we
[10:35] want to remember that need as we pray
[10:37] brother Jim God has an unspoken prayer
[10:40] request he appreciates all of your
[10:42] prayers so we certainly won't remember
[10:43] that need this morning as we prayed all
[10:46] the unspoken prayer requests if you have
[10:48] a need it's a gloomy old world but this

[49:02] come to work it was not to prove in size
[49:04] of wonder even though we believe in him
[49:06] Jesus come to the earth for one purpose
[49:09] one purpose in it was in first John 3:8
[49:12] he said whose own committeth sin is of
[49:15] the devil for the devil sent from the
[49:17] beginning for the purpose of the Son of
[49:21] God was manifested that he might destroy

[52:14] fallen nature the fallen it was a fire
[52:17] hovered over her and it was bored and it
[52:20] was darkness
[52:21] anyway where
[52:23] it was no sign of manifestation of life
[52:26] in the earth but God moved upon the face
[52:29] of the earth
[52:30] and God said let there be light and we
[52:34] gonna say light the darkness had to move
[52:37] out in a way that what he'd done to your
[52:39] life today you might have been under the
