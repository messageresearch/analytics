in this world Amen nothing nothing so apparently you've never got over the hill yet have you we're talking about the hill of Calvary of course than once people really come in contact with that reality it changes our life doesn't it I'm so happy that I'm I was able as a boy to be able to see that reality years ago and I don't mind telling you I love him tonight more than I've ever loved him greet you tonight sure missed you all good to see you appreciate the goodness of the Lord to us let's turn to U First Peter chapter 1 tonight Lord willing I guess we're still having the we're having the question answers tomorrow night for the Youth at 6:30 we'll be having it in here and um the youth asked me if if um if we would do this so um some of the questions I've had for a month or so some at least three weeks and I've been studying on them for for a bit so last Wednesday night I was going to preach what I'm going to preach tonight and then we was going to do question answers on Thursday night but we got snowed out of course and couldn't do it but what I want to speak to you tonight on is what is the Holy Ghost I'm sure every one of you would surely be able to give me an answer what you think it is no doubt not just a little bit but on the latest Foundation tonight we're because the first question that I want to answer tomorrow night is how can I know G so the Lord just put it on my heart that if we want to be able to know we've got it might need a refresher what it is so we can know what it is got know uh what it is in your life and before we start let me just say it this way the Holy Ghost is not jumping the Holy Ghost is not sh the Holy Ghost is not in motion right the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues but the Holy Ghost does all so what is the Holy Ghost it's the spirit of God in us so to say that the Holy Ghost is shouting and say that God is a shout or God is a tongue or God is a feeling or God is an emotion but we know that God is a spirit and the Holy Ghost is the attribute of God could be divided divided so the spirit of Christ which refers to what the Old Testament prophets had if you notice we read here in First Peter tonight that it does not say Jesus because Jesus the human body of God never existed in the old so it's not Jesus that Elijah had on Jesus that Moses had in him but it was the spirit of what Christ CH anointed one First Peter 1 verse 10 so the question answers are for alls and we'll be streaming it for those of you that like to stream as well and I believe you'll be blessed amen so if you can listen this careful now 1 Peter 1: 10 of which salvation the prophets have inquired and search diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify Peter says he doesn't say Jesus the humanity of God was in them but the spirit of Christ and it was actually in the prophets that come in them like it did Ezekiel but it did not seal their soul so that's what Peter called the spirit of Christ when it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow so the sufferings and then the glory that should follow of course that order and the glory is going to be the glory of the Resurrection but not only that but the glory of the church but it testified before him the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did Minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you wow so that first church they Le in vir that's the way God started his church that's way in his church so it was reported unto you by them which have preached the gospel unto you now listen this carefully with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into okay which things the Angels desire to look into now look at the screen there at what the word look means to stoop to a same in order to look at it if you can imagine in your mind ton that every one of you that have the Holy Ghost in your soul it is so overwhelm in and so great to the angels of God that they actually sto and they're looking we should never take Grant look at that meaning to look at with the head bowed forward to look into with the body bent so they don't just stand up real proud and sophisticated but they actually are looking they're trying to understand what in the world how God love them people we're with you all that Amen to suit and to look into metaphorically to look carefully into to inspect curiously yeah so it's like you're looking at something you just you got that look on your face in bewilderment you think wow body armorock orange Clementine wow I wonder what this going tast like and the angels are looking at God deals with us DAV think how can he how could he forgive them how can he put up with and what they have he in them I hope you understand that God uses the church as a school to teach his angels W to look carefully into to expect curiously one of who would become acquainted with something so they're so curious that they like to become acquainted with with that was the Angel's desire to look into so here it portrays the stretching of the neck and the bending of the body to be able to gaze upon some wonderful s that are struck with all yeah as you have the Holy Ghost on thank you Lord thank you Lord father that just about leaves us speechless to think that what you have done in human beings is so great I'm so curious that the angels of God study it in such a curious manner to try to relate to it father I pray you would help us toight would you open our understanding may we be able to leave this place [Music] over and becomes a demon there is no Redemption for the demon ad then demons could live inside of us when we were lost and we can be redeemed but that spirit that was inhabiting our could not be so they look at it in such a curious Manner and try to understand so the Redemption of the Saints and then also this infinite being holds such Marvel to them of his work not only Redemption for us but his work of incarnation that he would come to the Earth and become one of us and so much that he would bleed and die in pain and sorrow and Agony and scream from the cross my God my God why is s foren and they still are looking in this curious manner to understand every generation is different every age of what they go through I wonder how curious they must be tonight of us in this age the darkest most terrible age a person could live and they look with bewilderment at us as God deals with us in Mercy and Grace saves us sanctifies us fills us with the Holy Ghost and then they see us still as humans and we make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God and they see the plan of reconciliation that they say father please forgive me I'm so sorry and they see the mercy of God as it eliminates that sin never to be remembered against us again and they're looking at and thinking how that how can you do that and he don't even remember it how could it be that he that he just totally obliterates that sin and it'll never be remembered against again and they're looking with their bodies bent and their neck stretched and they're trying to comprehend you think the great work of what God has done is it any Wonder Satan hates the True Church of the Living God w't you notice in Ephesians 3:9 that Paul says and to make men all all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ notice the order now Jesus Humanity Christ anointed so anointed Humanity now Paul is bringing it from the stage of the invisible logos to show us that that invisible logos became a man and was crowned with Glory the anointing to the intent that now to the principalities and Power ERS in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God so again principalities is the beginning of the creation of angelic beings Aro so it's the first one in order so Paul broke into it in a little different way than God allowed Peter to and he says to the intent so the purpose is that the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God and manifold is the word variegated yall know what a variegated plant is so a variegated plant will have green and light green and I have green and white it's actually and there'll be couple of three different colors sometimes in there and you never know exactly how each Leaf will be so Paul says this is what God did God chose to manifest his manifold wisdom not in angels not in charans but by the church the church the Ecclesia of God the called out of God people who leave their homes and gather in a public place and by their own walk and they're the variegated body of God some were drunk some were alive some were this and that and God brings them all together by the variegated manifold wisdom of God and the angels are still trying to figure it out how can this be how can he love them right now he says that it not be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God the angels are not participants in Salvation the Angels do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Angels do not experience deity in the way you now in a simplified form the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your soul is your portion of deity yes sir from the God Amen it is your portion of deity that once you get in here it will be yours forever you will never that's right it is always yours now remember this is what the Holy Ghost is it is the part of God I know it's difficult for us even looking at the Father and Son relationship because we judge it by human terms and human perception so you would look and say well father and son so here's Brother D Swanson he is a father and then we look at his sons and say well them sons and they they look a little bit different than day and our makeup is a little bit different than the day and that's the way we judge God him but remember Jesus said God is a spirit God is not a man God is Not Not a Human Being right God is a spirit and God never had a permanent human body unto Jesus his word his son come on the earth then from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it will this part now this was God's Humanity he was both human and God is that right so the truth then of God was made manifest in the human body the Lord Jesus so now the manifold wisdom of God will be made manifest not just in Jesus but actually in the church so the Holy Angels are taught by the instrumentality of the church how in the world could a bunch of weaklings a bunch of former Sinners former Liars drug addicts everything of the world you can imagine and God would use them to teach Angels you imagine God speaking to them and say you want to know more about me watch me in my church you want to understand me greater you archangels you cherubims you seraphim you zoom Watch How I deal with my bride Hallelujah so they catch a view of God's Supreme love in a way that they didn't see it in the universe so the prophet tells us to his opinion the first thing that God made was Angels then he become into the position or the object of worship which is God before that he was the Eternal the Eternal so there was no one to worship him so it wasn't God because God is the object of worship so there had to be something to worship him so he created angels and actually the Angels the Fallen Angels actually fell before the foundation of the world was ever Le so they were there when he started creating this aspect of the universe and they never saw with the trillions of Angels the billions of stars and they never saw the great display of his wisdom in the way that they see it and you and I so here the church then becomes God's school for Angelic beings notice in Hebrews chap 1:14 are they not all ministering Spirits talking about the angels of God are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of Salvation so their Ministry is for The Heirs on the earth that's going to receive salvation so this within itself makes them more Curious to be able to look into it I wonder how many times them angels have been around us I wonder how many accidents that the angels of God have stopped you from having when Satan laid a a snare or trap or whatever and an angel of God stood between you and that truck or that car or maybe you got out and you was fixing a head somewhere and and you forgot something back at the house and you had to go back and get it and if you would have been 5 minutes earlier you've been right in the middle of a terrible terrible accident God has appointed the angels to watch over you not only to watch but to minister wonder what they're ministering so they minister to those that are Heirs of Salvation so they comprehend they're trying to look imagine these angels they some of the same ones that were assigned to Noah they were the same ones that was assigned to Paul and assigned to the first church age on down to the seventh and they're still pondering and looking at what God did through Paul and looking at us today they're saying they're similar but they're so different look at them and what they're dealing with they're living in the the most terrible age that's ever been on the earth and yet it seems like they're at their wits in sometimes and they don't know what to do but father will allow me to be able to give them a little boost and they don't even know where it comes from but it's like they're all alone and he'll he'll send a message to me and I'm their angel to watch over them and I will get down near where they are are and from my being projects a supernatural strength and they're thinkinking lord I can't go another day I don't think I can put up with anything else and all of a sudden I'm allowed to send a charge through them like a battery and where they were standing there with their heads bowed and crying and in the next moment tears are running out of their eyes and they're saying thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus they didn't even know it was me standing right there by him amen oh Hallelujah to God so what is the Holy Ghost you see the Holy Ghost is not Jesus the human body of God living in US you understand that so God did not divide the human body and give you an eye you an ear you a piece of hair there was not enough Humanity in that body the body itself served as a carrier of the sacrificial blood but the token was not the body of Jesus now listen carefully the token was not even the chemistry of the blood but the token was the spirit which was inside the body that was not enough chemistry in the body of the Lord Jesus if you'd give every one of us a drop of that blood as we say and the songwriters write about it it makes a good song but it's not really true the blood literally is not applied to Your Heart Right There was not enough chemistry inside that body to do it but God was able to hide in the blood cell so what is the Holy Ghost the attribute of God which could be divided you understand the Eternal himself and that original attribute could not divide himself into multiple portions and send it around the world I wonder how many people tonight on the face of the Earth have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's the exact same holy ghost that Peter got on the day of Pentecost and let me just say this tonight in case you're wondering you late folks don't have a lesser Holy Ghost than what preachers have got and US regular preachers don't have a lesser Holy Ghost than what the prophet had it's the same Holy Ghost right but it's our calling and so on that makes us different you young people have got the same Holy Ghost so there's not like a young people version of the Holy Ghost so there in heaven you know God's got a special young people version and that's why young people can listen to rock and roll gospel because they're Holy Ghost allows them it's exactly the same holy ghost that us old people have got so if it is is it should be the same way we should act the same way now let me just go on and say so then the Chinese people that get the Holy Ghost get the same Holy Ghost then the Mexican people right get the same Holy Ghost uh uh the Native Americans get the same Holy Ghost of people in in Czechoslovakia and Poland and all around the world exact same Holy Ghost is that right so then you see whenever God sends a message globally around the world and sends the spirit of Christ into the hearts of those True Believers then this is why the standard of Holiness righteousness Purity and holding to that same gospel can be the same no matter where you are unless of course you hold on to your tradition over the top of the teaching of the word now you find that of course you go into different places and you'll find that they hold on to their original tradition which you're not supposed to do it's you're supposed to be baptized into one mystical body by the Holy Ghost so let's look now so how the Holy Ghost came Acts chapter 2 you're all familiar with it how the Holy Ghost came Acts 2 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting wow what a strange way to get the Holy Ghost they wasn't even at an altar nobody was beating them on the back nobody was taking that g no they were all setting now listen to me this is the only time in the book of Acts that it happened quite this way now it happened of course in Cornelius it actually happened in Acts 19 but nowhere else does it mention exactly in this same way of a rushing Mighty Wind Now read your Bible and you'll find that out watch what God did suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it bu all the house the house the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire now this is the original breaking up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it was like this big Pillar of Fire comes into the upper room and he started whipping around in the room and a lick went off and went clothing tongues of fire begin to set upon each of them notice what it says and it set upon each of them so he didn't say that the fire the burning fire actually went in them read your Bible but it sat so it came and set upon them this is the original dividing of God separating himself s into this attribute where that this is the first time it's ever happened since the dawn of creation that more than a prophet more than just one man in the age would be able to have the spirit of Christ that would testify of what he's going to do but here they are 120 people and it's visible God wanted them to be able to see it that's what I said God never done this in another place in the book of Acts but this was a visible appearing so here you've been looking around 120 of them and you have saw pillar fire there lick over him one over her one over him one over her one over a young person one over another person and it was visible God wanted them to see what he was doing he was dividing himself into this attribute now notice in verse four and they were all filled wow notice how it happens though suddenly there come a sound of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as a fire and set upon each of them and then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost one sign leading to another signs to get their attention no wonder that Paul in the book of Corinthians talked about tongues and prophet prophecy about one being assigned to the believer and one was assigned to the unbeliever and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues now notice they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance I love the meaning of this word I can't believe it I honest cannot believe it that I've been preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost now for how many every years I've been preaching and I had never actually looked up the word utterance until today but boy am I glad I did today I want you to look at what this word means speak force not a word of everyday speech but one belonging to dignified and an elevated discourse and the spirit was giving them a dignified elevated discourse well I reckon this is a bunch of ignoramuses they were ignorant and unlearned can you imagine as they begin to speak this way and they were looking around and they were speaking Arabian they were speaking Spanish they were speaking Chalan they were speaking Hebrew they were speaking all these different languages and they were looking at each other and just speaking in these languages they never knew these languages but it was the spirit of God giving them utterance now I realize there's people around the message today they say we're Way Beyond that and we don't need that you show me where he took it out I'll preach the same thing now I do believe that as the people of God we should never major on a minor but I am enough of a musician to know that if a songwriter writes a song and puts miners in the song even if you don't think they belong there and you sing them without it the song will not sound the same without them and it just so happens that the author of the New Testament song put minors in with Majors so when he minored I want to minor with him when he majored I want to Major if he diminishes if he goes to a seventh or a ninth or an argumented whatever he does I want to follow it I to be honest with you I really don't care if you think it sounds good or not because I'm not playing for you I'm playing for him amen that's the way you should look at it as well I'm not here tonight every one of you should look at it exactly the same I'm not here tonight to just necessarily please the church I'm not here tonight to please my wife my husband my family I'm here to please God if some of us would get that out of our mind I think we'd Worship the Lord a little a little bit more than what we do but we're scared to death somebody's going to think we're Pentecostal I'm scared they're going to think I ain't all right now notice in verse 38 whenever Peter begins and the the the 120 go out and the people out there they look at them and they're acting so peculiar and odd and they said they're drunk now do you honestly think they would have said they were drunk had they been setting like this you see us in the message many of us have quit saying amen and instead we nod I wonder what hadie R would have got from God if she would have nodded you see the prophet did not tell her hady because you nodded but he said you said the right thing God wants to hear your amens God wants to hear you see it's not just the preacher that wants to hear them God wants to hear them now Peter's in and they move outside and they're kind of Staggering around and you know my goodness what in the world is wrong with them people and they said well they're trunk and they said no no no it ain't that this is just the third hour of the day while the saloons and taverns ain't even open yet it's the morning time so this is the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel so they begin to say well what what must me what must we do them to get what y'all got then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost H what' he say in the name of Jesus Christ you mean to tell me that he stands right there and says the exact opposite of what Jesus said in Matthew 2819 no he actually said the same thing cuz father ain't a name I'm a father but that ain't my name how many men in here our fathers yes sir so is Father your name brother Matthew so the children go to say father father father father how many of us men would say yes yes so Peter says you got to repent you got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and your children to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call acts 5:32 for we Are Witnesses of these Saints so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that that obey him which is the main reason more people don't have it to them that obey him so this is how it comes acts 8:14 now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God they sent they sent I want you to know Peter and John didn't go on their own read your Bible they didn't go on their own they were sent praise the Lord they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for as yet he was fallen on none of them only they oh no they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus oh my goodness you mean to tell me the Apostolic Church baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus amen is this your Bible Well if you haven't been baptized that way then I ask you tonight why acts 10:43 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins notice through his name verse 44 while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on all them which had heard the word now want you notice in the three accounts that we're reading here about the Holy Ghost coming none of them are exactly identical amen isn't it amazing though how that we want everybody to get it the same way we did and we think boy if you didn't shout you didn't get it if you don't run you didn't get it if you don't speak in tongues if you don't jerk your head a certain way you didn't get it that's not following the book of Acts pattern well come on now and they of the circumcision in which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles now listen to me the Jews were very very set in their National thinking in one sense of the word they were still yet to be enlightened that there was a gentile bride they were shocked Harry they were shocked astonished you mean them dogs got the Holy Ghost this the same one that we got how is that PO possible we are Abraham's chosen race we are Abraham's chosen people how in the world could they get the Holy Ghost come on you see the mystery of the Gentile bride had not yet been made known and God wanted to prove to them Jews look I'm giving the Holy Ghost the exact same one you got to them Gentiles aren't you glad praise the Lord and as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost now I want you to notice what they done for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God but ain't it amazing in every other place it does and say that they spoke in tongues wonder why this is significant because they was looking at it still through the tongue aspect and God said okay I see you're hung up on the tongues so I'm going to let this Bunch speak in tongues too so it'll convince you all that they got the same thing you got did they have to to have the Holy Ghost no oh my for they heard them speak with tongue and magnify God then answered Peter can any forbid water that these should not be baptized which has received the Holy Ghost as well as we now watch this is God pouring out of himself and he's dispersing himself and the angels of God now this is what's going on in the the visible realm but in the invisible realm now the angels of God are being divided so it's like a subdivision being built in a mystical Kingdom so the angels are being divided and they're not only now just watching Jews but some of the angels for the first time in their existence of their creation they're watching over heathens former Gentiles heathens you imagine the angels of God being assigned to former Gentiles which were idolators oh my and they never they never had done this before it was Daniel you know it was it was some great king over in the Old Testament it was some great king Uzziah or Joshua and for the first time in their existence they're being assigned to Gentiles praise the Lord and he said unto them now watch this is Paul going to the upper coast of Ephesus and the prophet you know in order so we'd be able to relate to it he he said he found a bunch of Baptist up there and they hadn't got the Holy Ghost yet so he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they were some message people and they said unto him we've not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost now I find this absolutely amazing because they were following John the Baptist two dispensations had changed and they were behind two dispensations so they hadn't even heard of the Holy Ghost which again I find strange since John had it from his mother's womb his mother got it and his father got it and they hadn't even heard about it so it goes to show you that you can follow a prophet's message and still not have the Holy Ghost now this is pretty pitiful to me oh my and he said unto them unto what notice what unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism so see there are two dispensations behind so John did not baptize in a name now John was not the first one to baptize the ases baptized the zealots baptized so there was different ones that baptized but John was the first one to baptize point in unto a Messianic Advent and he'd say You Must Believe on him which is to come on him which is to come he didn't have no name cuz you weren't sure who he was yet so these people now several years after the Lord Jesus had come and gone several years after the Holy Ghost had been given and they were still baptizing people in this same way you've got to believe on him which is to come but there was some seed among them Baptist there still might be today praise the Lord and he said unto them then what were you baptized and they said unto John baptism then said Paul John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him now Paul can give the name that is on Christ Jesus know how he places the order here now Christos anointed Humanity so it's anointed Humanity Christ Jesus you know that the New Testament when the angel of God appeared to Mary and also on to Joseph and spoke his name it did not call him Lord Jesus Christ he was not called that until the book of Acts why he was CHR Christos the anointed one out the river he was named Jesus Jesus the human Jesus when the father came in him at the river he was jeus Christos but he was Lord Jesus Christ after he raised from the dead for God has made this same Jesus both Lord and Christ Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy Ghost oh praise be to God notice so here them Paul tells them John baptized the people and tells them what he said they should believe on him which should come which is that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized wow so is there anyone here tonight or anyone that will listen to this if you can show me in the book of Acts or in recorded history of the first century of the church second century as well where the original Church baptized using the titles of father son Holy Ghost I will stand here next Wednesday night and say I was wrong right or of course you can let me re-baptize you tonight cuz you ain't going to find it this is the way the true church baptized praise the Lord now notice how they get the Holy Ghost and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied now notice different from what happened in the upper room and different from what happened when Peter spake the word and they spake the word and when he done it then they just receive the Holy Ghost by by hearing the word but here and this is where the Prophet picks it up of course and he said the apostolic way of receiving the Holy Ghost is to have hands laid on you but notice it does not say in Acts two that when they got the holy ghost that they prophesied but these Believers in the upper coast of Ephesus did so which one are we going to use to say well that's the right way all of them are all of them are a't it amazing that God didn't make every one of them exactly the same so this and spoken tongue this and spoken tongues this and prophesied this and shouted don't you understand what Satan's trying to do he's trying to make a denominational thing out of even receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the message people that lean more toward the emotion and the ecstatic explosion of all of that everybody that don't have that you ain't got it the ones that are more still on the other side and they produce stillborn children well bless God it's a you know the Holy Ghost without sensation you don't have no sensation and no emotion and somehow you just grow into it you know you're just one day you'll just wake up and realize that you've been born again how in the world can that ever happen how can a man that's as lost as lost can be not realize that God has changed his nature oh praise the Lord Now watch how the prophet dealt with what the Holy Ghost actually is and what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the spirit of Christ in you now before we read I just like to say a few commoning words here what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant What is the Holy Ghost it's a sign what is the Holy Ghost then it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you so then it's not emotion it's not shouting though it will bring all types of effects some spoke in tongues some prophesied and yet it's amazing now look you know I believe in Emotion I believe in worshiping God and yet none of those scriptures that we read when they receive the Holy Ghost do we find where any of them as we say today shouted now brother Donnie don't you believe in that I do but I do not believe in making shouting an Evidence of the Holy Ghost you won't find that in the book of Acts as a matter of fact you won't even find where they shouted in the way that we think shouting is don't you believe in the quickening power of God I do and I don't like it when we make a denomination out of it that's exactly what some people are doing they're making a denomination what do you mean a denomination it's where everybody has to do it this way right here because this way's been declared my men it's not declared in the book of acts if it is you show me you preachers that won't like this you send me the scriptures and I'll apologize show me show me what they shouted and they they did all of that I believe in all of that but it is not an Evidence any more than other evidences that we make well somebody say amen and we can see how that these these different examples that God gave and every time that it came it was a little bit different well someone say well how did you get the Holy Ghost I got his sitting right here and her preacher preach the word well they might go up to Ephesus said brother tell me how you got the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what Paul laid his hands on me well my Lord what in the world you must not be near as much of a Believer as I am I sat right there and heard that word hallelujah you know how we are about that I sat right there and heard that word GL to God I'll tell you one thing I'm so spiritual I sat right there and heard the word of God and I sat right there man alive that eternal life entered into me and the other say well Paul laid his hands on me and I got it does it really matter does it really matter whether you were sitting or standing or rolling in the floor like a Holy Roller does it really matter the most important thing is what you got it you got it so whether you spoke in tongues and prophesied or you fell out in the floor you got it how do I know it changed you forever now watch brother Brandon preached this in 1959 and he preached the first service what is the Holy Ghost second service you know what is it given for and then the third service he preached how will you know you got it which I find it so amazing that they recorded it but it's never yet been released and then yet he does question answers so you saying isn't that strange isn't that odd that he would actually allow that to be released well let me say it to you this way it was not released in 1959 but the mystery of it was going to be released when he reti titled it and called it the token so how you going to know well brother Donnie if you're a woman your hair go out and you have a long dress and and if you're a brother you you'll uh you know you dress this way and that way and Men of course won't wear dresses to church and Men won't wear you know this and that look like a woman and that's the way you know it no that's not the way you'll know it that is part of it but you will be changed from what you were unto a brand new creature in Christ Jesus and the church said amen now he said what did the Holy Spirit what did it come for what did he come in you for what did he come in me for now listen it's quite simple was to continue the works of God to continue the works of God now remember part of these things were limited when the Lord Jesus come on the earth he's going to now sh share things of nature that had not been done since Adam lost it in the fall he's going to share things over animals and over nature and over storms that had not been replicated since the Fall In the Garden of Eden he's going to reverse nature he's going to reverse the cycle of death and go to a man's grave and he's been laying there for 4 days and his nose had fallen in and the skin worms were eating on his body and by the spoken word of God he's going to call that man's name and he'll come out of that grave is that right now he didn't just do that for himself and said now look at me you all can't do this but I want you to see what I am but what you all do you just go to church and you try to live right and you try to be be as good good as you can but he said now I'm showing you all what to do and I want you to act like me talk like me preach like me live like me raise the Dead Like Me cast out devils like me yeah now remember he says here that the Holy Ghost was given that we might continue the works of God remember the blind man and St John 11 whenever the disciples said Lord who s this man or his parents and Jesus said neither one but that The Works of God might be made manifest and then of course in another place in John they asked him and said Lord what might we do to do the works of God and he said this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent so the works of God then incorporates healing miraculous but it also means you're able to get in line behind the godall leader of the age and a god call Pastor and so on and so on that's also part of the works of God Jesus knew every woman was not going to cast out Devils Hallelujah come here devil I'm ready for you he knew the daughters of God was not going to do that th and sharan went to Brother Bram said brother brandham I fasted and fasted to cast out devils and I still can't do it he said you're not called to do such he said but you're called to fast and pray for those who are called to cast them out and you said well I can't do nothing brother Donnie's called to do that and brother Joe and brother Daryl and brother Joel these other brother Jonathan these other brothers that are called whoever they are but I can't do nothing yes you can you can pray for me and you can pray for the rest of these brothers because we're not dealing with a little video saying when you're dealing with a demon you're dealing with a fallen angel oh what a comfort it is to know that the saints of God are praying for you so what do we do we continue the works of God which is what building a church having church membership really so it's not just going to church every now and then whether you feel like it or not and and you know you drop a little money in and and you really don't believe in ping ties and you really don't believe in walking right and doing right and you know you just you just go to church that's the work of God that's the way Jesus did the Bible says that Jesus on the Sabbath day went to the synagogue which was his custom so lets me know a lot of the folks around the message don't have the custom of Jesus cuz Jesus went to church and if they really believe what them tapes say they don't because their feet testify they're voting with their feet not with their mouths then they would know exactly that the prophet tells us even Christ The Mystery of God revealed that if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to open you see the reason people don't feel that way they're missing God in their heart well come on somebody if God is in your heart you can't wait for them doors to come open and he said if you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to pray it come on somebody let's say what the tapes say praise the Lord now I love the way that he goes on down in this paragraph a little further and he said the Jesus that sends you goes with you and is in you and if that Spirit living in Jesus Christ made him do and act the way he did you'll have some general idea of how it will do what it's in you because that life cannot change it'll go from body to body but it cannot change its nature listen what it is now for it is God your baptism of the Holy Ghost is your portion of God now you all educate me for a bit dogs bring forth help me now educate me some of y'all been wanting to teach me a few things so help me now cats bring forth horses bring forth so what would God bring forth if he brought forth children say it come on you you can do it come on that's it come on come on honey say it say it what would God bring forth gods in humanity but you see we look so much at our Humanity we suppress the Divine Supernatural and what you and I suppress the angels of God are looking at in amazement and they just are mesmerized by about what's inside of us and we're saying well I ain't nobody I don't ever amount to nothing I guess you know I just make so many mistakes and they're looking at every one of them mistakes and you make and they're not even thinking that about you at all they think don't they know what he told them don't they know what he said that he don't even see their mistakes don't they know that that blood that he shed on the cross don't they know that it ain't no wonder that they look at us and they thinking you know I how how could he love them he gave his life he gave his word he gave his Bible then he sends a message with over 1100 sermon and then they still question does he even love them it's a there's said what in the world is it going to take for them bunch of Noe heads that's Kentucky language translated into Angelic language I guess what's he going to take for them to realize how much he cares and they're looking at you daily and thinking if you only knew what I knew about you thank you Lord praise be to God notice this what is the Holy Ghost again what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in you the comforter that's the Holy Spirit when the comforter has come he'll do the things that I've done while the comforter is in me so it's a very same father that was in Jesus except he had the fullness all of that fullness was in him but it was the fullness that was going to be divided think of how great he is he could divide himself into millions of parts and he is no less that great August presence around the throne is no less being subdivided into how many ever pieces that he is and he's still as great upon the throne as he ever was before he divided himself now here he is he he on the throne and yet he's on the earth and he's in the United States and he's in Ohio and he's an Africa he's in India and and the angels of God are looking and say I didn't know he was this big I didn't know he was this great I saw that light I saw that shakina I saw that Glory I didn't realize you mean every time they get the Holy Ghost that's him that's him inside of them oh my God how great he is how wonderful he is and they're just saiding oh how awesome how wonderful he is he's everywhere I didn't know he's everywhere they knew he was Everywhere by his omnipotence and by his omnipotence but they didn't know he was going to be everywhere by dividing himself and baptizing himself into a little white boy and a little black girl and a little Indian a little Native American and a swed and a German and so baptizing with the love of God that they by nationality might have great differences but they'll be able to put their arms around one another and say brother I love you sister I love you why it's God don't you understand God in Me will love God in you that don't mean My Flesh will love everything about yours I'm going to say something shocking it don't mean you're going to like everything about me but if God's in you you can't hate God in Me and if God's in me and in you I can't hate God in you we might disagree on the flesh but how can God hate [Applause] God so the Holy Ghost is a seal it's a sign it's a comforter watch paragraph 16 what is the Holy Ghost it's an advocate it's an advocate what does it do oh oh Jesus it has Mercy it stands in your place it does things you can't do or say Brother D you're talking about perfect love and all that I just can't do that of course you can't I can't either none of us can do it there's only one that could do that and that was the Lord Jesus but God wants to come in Us in such a way well you say how come some people can do it easier than others it's because they've learned how to submit the key is the more we submit the more he can take over oh praise God it does things you can't do it's a perpetuation for your sins don't you understand you don't need an altar in the church in the sense with blood on it and mercy you make a mistake tomorrow say oh goodness I've got to run by 490 okalona Road and be able to have the brother still at me in the sanctuary so I go up in the front and kneel down no you packed your altar Oh Glory to God you pack your altar and you pack your eternity your eternity is there you pack the blood The Mercy Seat the forgiver The Advocate you carry it with you so you don't have to wait till Sunday to come back and say Lord I'm so sorry I messed up on on Thursday and I've been waiting all week Lord to get back I'll tell you

your case hallelujah hallelujah oh my it's your righteousness it's your healing you know but friend I I I guess I just I don't understand I I I guess I just don't understand why is it that so many want to just preach the holy ghost that it's all healing it's all miracles it's all signs it's all wonders it's all emotion what about this part right here and preach the Holy Ghost in such a place brother if you look crosseyed to somebody you're about lost you ain't even got it you mess up one time and you make one mistake brother you ain't got the Holy Ghost well if he's not going to have to be an advocate for me why in the world do I need an advocate if after I get it boy I'm fine from that day on I'll never make a mother mistake you ain't preaching the Bible holy ghost on well somebody said amen it's a perpetuation for your bleep what there's a brave person here who was that you brother me thank you so it's a perpetuation for your sins Lord have mercy you don't mean to tell me people of the Holy Ghost is going to fall short of the glory of God it's your righteousness brother Donnie I'll have you to know glory to God I got her 40 years ago I ain't sin since you just sin

continue his work among his people to bring his church together wow to a place in this day far beyond Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostal and to a place to adoption and rapturing Grace this is the only way the bride will ever be able to get together friends we are as divided now if not more so than we have ever been in this message I hate to tell you it's a shame really it's a shame we are so divided and so split up it it it's heartbreaking it's absolutely heart heartbreaking preachers preaching at one another and throwing quotes at one another and throwing scriptures at one another and churches divided young people divided it's pitiful who's the blame for a lot of it preachers are to blame for a lot of it Amen brother Donnie you going to keep on Sir you're going to get me fired but he'll fire me up if I don't tell it so I'd rather y'all Farm it than him Farm me up noce into a place to adoption of rapture Grace that when this part of the church listen what he's waiting on when the spirit moves into this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth all the redeemed that's touched that Spirit no wonder brother Daryl the angels of God are looking at it and say father now you're you're if I understand this right you're not bringing no Resurrection until everyone I'm get to Holy Ghost is that right that's right and according to what them preachers are saying down there you imagine Angels listening to preachers to be updated on what's Happening Lord have mercy so according to what them men are saying you're you're going to bring your people to together for rapturing Faith and it will be their faith when they come to The Headstone crying Grace Grace that when when they come to that spot when they arrive there it'll be such a cosmic upheaval that the dead will be raised father are we getting that right and father said yep that's what's going to happen my church will actually arrive to that place of maturity and the devil's holding his sides laughing you got to be kidding me I don't never happened uh devil maybe I should take you back to Acts chapter 2 on the day of Pentecost them men that you laughed at and said this church won't last three or four days but when that Pillar of Fire come down and divided himself They Live Like Jesus they healed the sick like Jesus they died like Jesus they preach the gospel they rais the dead that same Lord Jesus said he will have a bride in the last day Hallelujah he will have a bride in the last day that will come to the fullness of that maturity again at this time unlike Paul the alpha bride did not cause a resurrection but the Omega bride will glory to God glory to God thank you Lord list stand let me finish this quote here for you it'll bring forth them redeemed that's touched that Spirit those Lutheran who stood there with all the light they had in justification those methodists that fell on the floor and they throw water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification those Pentecostals that walked up and down the streets and they called them Tong deong what in the world that ever means and jabberers and Goose language and all of that they'll stand in the righteous in the sight of God at that day just as certain as this Bible stands in here oh my Lord imagine the day it'll be when the Lord Jesus is at wor steps behind the curtain and takes off his Priestly garments when the angel you'll see him rise from the throne and he steps off the platform we say and when he comes out he's got on his marriage garments you understand Peter's never seen him yet Paul's never seen him the Saints in the sixth Dimension haven't seen him yet it would be Unbecoming for them to see him with blood on his garments so he changes close imagine when David come in from slaying the Philistines and laid the forkins of those Philistines down before Saul he did not go directly and take Mall imagine he must have went changed clothes took a bath got Philistine sweat off of him Philistine blood off of him when the Lord Jesus steps out and the angel see him for his first time the bridegroom closed of all they've seen out of him they've never seen him look like this can you imagine the smile I know it maybe seem hard for you to comprehend but the Lord Jesus actually laughed when he was here on the earth I imagine one of his greatest laughs will be whenever he steps out and a smile comes upon his face and they're standing there looking at him and say I've never seen him smile like that and they look at one another and say you know what today is she's coming home him changing clothes is a sign you're fixing to amen praise God then those of us that are alive and and remain will change clothes all of a sudden a sweep will come over us and our muscles and our tissues and our bones and all of that will be changed Oh but before that happens our loved ones will start to appear first I told Carol the other day I said I want I want to you know I said you think about it as long as we've been here I've lost the count now but since ever I've been here 35 36 years whatever it is I buried over aund and some people through the years since I've been here I got to think about the other day I'm not sure my house big enough for all them folks to come in at one time I'm going have to build a bigger house cuz I guarantee you one thing when they raise but I imagine there'll be a little girl yes sir about this talk right her long blonde hair hanging down her back if anybody get in her away they say excuse me excuse me excuse me Hallelujah of course after she stops over the hill sees her husband and her children oh I can't wait to see brother Allen mckenny brother Homer Arnold sister clark brother Jean Littleton oh my it'll be one after another and then the prophet said you'll see your loved ones and you know it won't be long you're going to be changed so may I'll be standing there combing my hair you know for years y'all thought this was a teg it's still mine it's still mine it's all still there it didn't turn loose but it did turn gray thank you all for that y'all help do that and I may be standing in front of the mirror brother Rob I brush my teeth and I take the comb out you know I'm I'm combing it back and all of a sudden I run that comb through that gray and it goes and it'll be Browner than it was of that picture that's hanging out there the sister Sylvia wrote the poem about me years and years ago when I first came here and the wrinkles that go out of my face and I'll look and see my loved ones right the prophet said he knows how we are we'll be looking around to see did this one make it did that one make it so we get together with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth can you imagine think of it he says going beond the camp 1964 missing people they can't find you no more I wonder who in the world they are they can't find you no more I imagine humans and demons they said where' doy go where' doy go he was standing there brushing his teeth bam he's gone and then they go to communicate them back and forth what in the world happed to ke he was standing there one minute oh Lord my back oh Lord my knee oh Lord and somehow brother Jack maybe getting up on his things oh Jesus I don't know if I can make it another day or not and in a moment brother Jack was changed to a young man and there s sister bent right by and the devil said Lord have mercy what is it the move is on brother the move is on but I want to tell you it's on tonight too the move is on get filled with the Holy Ghost yeah barot children I'm not sure that I could preach a more serious sermon than tonight you may think well you know brother Donnie I'm kind of messed up in my Doctrine and you know maybe this and that I I already needed that tonight but if you can get filled every fiber filled with the Holy Ghost he'll take care of your Doctrine everything you'll have need of is in you then for your journey no doubt I've not buried the last one I'll probably have to bury more I've walked in front of the casket of many and stand there and say the last words over them stand by their bed and watch them take their last breath my life has been filled with so Much Death I hate death oh sometimes I wish I wasn't a preacher that makes sense to you I have to deal with so much sickness and so much turmoil so much sadness so much deaths thank God one day death will die praise God death will die hallelujah how many of you wouldd like to be remember tonight brother Donnie I I just just want to be sure maybe some of you are sure you've got a rest you know beyond the shadow of a doubt you've got the Holy Ghost but maybe you just need to refilling anybody here like that maybe some of you sick you need a healing maybe some of you fighting oppression whatever more you just need the presence of God to come this way look friend I'm not interested in trying to produce to you an AA Allen Revival a jackco Revival oh they had Great Signs wonders and miracles but I'm more concerned about being able by the grace of God to preach to you a gospel that'll produce the life of Jesus Christ then come the signs then come the Wonders then the signs will follow us instead of us following the signs I am not a sign follower I am a person that signs follow yeah that's the way it should be praise the lord lord Jesus as we bow our heads tonight father as we enter into your August courts I pray the presence of God would move across this place Lord we're sitting in a different type building than Peter and them were in Acts 2 different type of setting than they were no doubt at Ephesus the other places where the Holy Ghost come in the book of Acts that's changed we're glad we can say tonight the Holy Ghost is not changed would you come by this way tonight Lord so what are you once you enter into this attribute by which you can divide yourself then my brother Harry not being a preacher but yet has the same holy ghost that I have my nephew Justin my granddaughters both of my daughters my son-in-law WS the people here at the church the the ones that might feel like oh I'm so insignificant but yet if they have the Holy Ghost they've got exact same holy ghost that I've got the same one and their life is a mystery to angels as they watch them and they minister to them oh Lord God we need your ministering presence tonight father sometimes we go through so much in life Lord we don't know what to do would you send an Angel by our way Lord we know you sent one to Peter there in jail and I hope they take it the right way when I say it this way that was Jesus 2,000 years ago well we're not in a physical jail tonight but we still need angels to come to us L ministering spirits that are sent to minister to the air of Salvation wh what a what a what a thing and the word ministering deonia which is the very word that Deacon comes from so when they chose deacons in the book of Acts they were men that were chosen to minister so the deacons are never called to run the church but actually they placed the deacons in the church to be able to minister to the hungry and to be able to take care of the things like that and that's the Greek word that it com comes from Deacon deonia and it means minister to minister to can we grasp it tonight those great Heavenly beings are our deons you send a Heavenly being that's never said one bad word that's never had one thought of doubt them angelss have never had one thought of ever leaving you and you send them to me and to these people and your people around the world Lord God who would think of such that you would send the greater to minister to the Lesser unless of course the Lesser is actually hid and one day the Lesser will enter into such a stage of glorification that the angels of God will Circle the Earth's one day and bow their heads when the Resurrection The Rapture takes place and the prophet tells us those angels will circle the Earth with bowed heads as the redeemed go to singing the songs of your Redemption and mercy because they don't know what we're singing about they Minister about it and they minister to give us strength and courage and hope and all of that but they don't understand it oh Jesus I'm sorry I'm so sorry we've belittled this great thing you've done for us help us tonight Lord may we never look at our Holy Ghost the same way again praise the lord we worship you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah hallelujah let's just let's just keep in this presence now I know you got to work tomorrow and you got school and all that but who knows there may not be a tomorrow in no way let's just take a few minutes as if though this might be our last service because it might be for somebody oh praise the Lord can we give him something tonight that an angel cannot can we funnel praise through redeemed lips something that Angels cannot do can we lift hands that were Unholy hands that hell beer cigarettes marijuana fifth of whiskey but now they're classified as holy hands lifting up holy hands praise God I hope you can understand it friends right here in this building tonight are the Angels of God and they are watching you they are watching in bewilderment don't make them wonder why you're not praise him don't make them wonder why that you're not giving him that fruit of your lips oh my but may they see the Fulfillment of Calvary tonight may they see why once again on a Wednesday night that Calvary was a success you know why I know because he saved me because he saved you I a testimony that Calvary worked praise be to God thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus there's a brother right here in our midst tonight came to our church several years ago first service he attended he was taking pills for this pills for that pills for something else one service in the presence of God God delivered him and set him free he's still living right tonight and stands right here in this building as a testimony Calvary was a success each one of you bear your own testimony of what God has brought you through and you stand here tonight and nobody can have your testimony you are unique and you're variegated in the body of God Don't You Love him thank you Lord don't you appreciate him Harry let's just sing a little something together whatever whatever's on your heart let's just Worship the Lord now a little bit before we go I'll try not to hold you too long if you need to go you go on but let's just worship him a little before we go praise God may we now Minister back to our husband brother bam talked about a wife and what a great thing she could be and a man comes in tired from work and he said he's weary and all that and his little wife meets him at the door and she comes in takes him by the hand and sets him down and she goes over and sets in his lap and puts her arms around him he said it just feels like it all goes away I wonder how many times since Sunday the Lord jesus' name has been taken in vain how many people said he don't even live there's no such thing as a God how he's been blasphemed how he's been ridiculed and criticized just in the last couple of days why don't we open the door and say come on in Lord Jesus let's take him by the hand let's take him by the hand and go over and set him down let's sit down in his lap I preached this several years ago in a convention and the Lord helped me to dramatize it like the Song of Solomon and how that she went and got him at the door door and she brought him in and she let him over and set him down and then she sat down on his lap and she took her arm and put around it and let her eyes which at one time could not even look in the face of God but now her Li her eyes looked at him and he was so mesmerized that he said turn away thine eyes for me for one of Thine Eyes has captured my eyes heart there was a brother there from Germany I heard him telling some other people after the service he said I've been a preacher for all these decades I've heard hundreds and thousands of sermons preached I've never heard anything like that in my life he said this is what I got out of it he didn't see me he said but this is what I got out of it that man actually has sat in the lap of Jesus I thought that's one of the greatest compliments I have ever been paid in my life it's one thing to say it but when you tell the story that you have experienced people can tell the difference don't you want to be able to tell the same story that you sat in the lap of Jesus and you put your arm around him and then you you move both of your hands upon his face and you just look into his eyes and you say have I told you today how much I love you I'll do Carol that way sometimes not near enough I'm sure I'll take it by the hands and I'll pull her real close and I'll say have I told you today how much I love you have I told you how much you mean to me and more times than not she'll say no tell me I want to hear it
