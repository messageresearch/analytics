brother Eric could you pull up blessed assurance the song was written by Fanny Crosby and but the the music to it was written by a friend of hers whose husband happened to be a life insurance salesman and she had this tune that she the Lord gave her but she didn't have words for it and she played it over and over in one and and Eve Crosby being her friend she said Fanny could you write some words to this song and she'll the inspiration struck her and she wrote blessed assurance Jesus is mine we know how many times brother Graham told the story about the man wanting to sell him life insurance

been inspired to write a song and a person just write a song some people just write Psalms the George Smith calls from homemade just homemade you imagine how old that song is in the inspiration that was given to it and yet it still inspires and blesses people's hearts a man well how many's happy to be in the church tonight let me brought your shotgun yeah what if you didn't I've got an extra one for you I smell a Fox your tonight you didn't know you can smell you didn't know you can smell them you can I got a smell to him there's 37 different species of Fox 37 but the species of your shortcomings are way more than that but I think we'll have a pretty good idea don't you let's turn again to the Song of Solomon if you would chapter 2 verse 14 so appreciate the Word of God appreciate God loving us so much to tell us the truth song one Solomon chapter 2 verse 14 oh my dev thou art in the cliffs of the rock and the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance you see it's not the church that sees him like this it's not the foolish virgin South 144,000 this is the bride that's viewing him in a secret place she's the only one notice where she sees him all my devoured and the clefts of the raw and the secret places of the stairs the ascension of the supernatural so she finds him in the ascending but notice what she links to the ascending the things that's going to try to come between them and try to erode their relationship now he's already ascended up but he's coming to get her so she can ascend as well so the Ascension has been building and God has been building a body through seven Church ages let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and our countenance is comely take us the Foxes or capture them let's get them the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes my beloved is mine and I am his he feedeth among the lilies until the daybreak and the shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a roll or a young heart upon the mountains of bether this marries together Heavenly Father we so love you tonight we are so grateful Lord Jesus for the opportunity to given to us that we could assemble to nine Lord on this Saturday night a night known to the world as a night of drinking and carousing and running around and partying and people getting drunk and getting high committing adultery and doing all kinds of things on Saturday night but we're doing what we love best going to church singing worshiping praising hearing your word becoming your word Lord Jesus there's not another pleasure there's not another thing that the real saints of God love any better than the house of God the Word of God the Fellowship of God the peace of God I just want to say thank you for once again giving us a Saturday night service I know Lord we've had Saturday night services here now for over 30 years since I started coming years ago and pastoring between Kentucky and here this is the reason we started Saturday night so I could preach your own Saturday night and Sunday morning Drive four and a half hours preach Sunday night Monday night in Kentucky and Lord I'm grateful that you've allowed us all these years to be able to have church Saturday night I'm grateful we still got some folks that want to come to church on Saturday night I appreciate it Lord may you bless our gathering together what little feeble effort that we can put forth speak to us tonight from your word father may we be a better people when we leave here for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it amen god bless you Saints you may be seated I love Saturday night church don't you I realize people you know they pass by and see our cars I think you all have church on Saturday night when do you do your grocery shopping other days when do you do this other days a we like church it don't work for everybody but you know what so far it works for us and I'm going to keep it this way as long as the Lord lets as long as you want to be able to come now let us by the help of the Lord be able to resume a little bit of this and I'd like to speak to you tonight as you might have guessed on little foxes we know that it's them little foxes that as the bride said spoil the vine little foxes never stay little of course unless they're the kenick Fox from Africa which is you know about this tall I've got one now at about that size most of you probably never even seen one or a lit bat-eared Fox a couple of species around the world that are very very tiny and small but even at that they will mature not only in size but in cunning and in understanding and you're the bride is able to recognize some of the things that will come against her and her beloved she does not call them by name she doesn't identify what they are and I wrote some of these down a rim to you last week and I like to read them again and I put them up on the screen here the brothers royal so you can be able to read them with me they are sins like pride and jealousy self seeking criticism or being critical wanting my rights gossip judging others harshness impatience ingratitude self-pity hypocrisy mistrust superiority inferiority worry and a thousand more but hopefully I'll not make this series two will will cover all a thousand but if the Lord hates us too we will now how do these little foxes actually spoil the vine well in all they not only get to the vine itself to eat from the tender part that's shooting out they eat around the base of the vine which comes up out of the ground they also dig down with her tiny little paws and they will dig down beneath the surface of the earth and they will dig down into the heart where the roots are and they won't tear that out but they will also their favorite parts is the little grapes as they come out now looking at this and type in all says the Holy Ghost as he begins to produce the fruit of our union with the Lord Jesus and the fruits of the Spirit of God in our lives then these little foxes will try their very best to be able to destroy the fruitfulness and our life as a child of God and there's many foxes and no doubt there's no way a preacher could cover them all because they vary according to our own makeup and according to our weaknesses but I'd like to deal with the ones that the Lord lays upon my heart wouldn't that be the ones you'd want me to deal with I could study no doubt and look in different ones and the way different preachers have preached it but I like to pray myself and go in the direction that I feel the anointing and the pulsation of the Holy Ghost because to me that's what Sneed 'fl for our congregation well that's those that are actually visibly here are those who would visit us by streaming and I pray that you'll pray with me and we'll just go along as the Spirit of God will anoint our hearts now I hope tonight that what you brought was an open heart and you didn't bring your shovel and your pitchfork and your corn scoop or you can shovel it over to this brother and over to that sister but your heart will be open that you'll be able to receive from the Lord tonight let us sow tonight and a little bitty old tiny Fox it's a little bitty guy he's so cute now you know man has broken many many years ago to the ability of high breeding now there's not that many original species of Fox but what man did man got into the breeding of Fox confers or a very great value now because of the left and the animal huggers and the tree huggers and a lot of that you know they've so stood against the fur trade that the fur trade is and what he was years ago but when it was quietly and you know an explorative type of saying and exploitive on the animals himself man got into breeding a lot of really colorful beautiful foxes now the marbled Fox is one of the most sought-after very very beautiful and if you've ever seen one or not but they're by and they're white have a little touch of gray some of the Raritan the genetics of the gene will come out with a little bit of pink that'll run through the hair and absolutely breathtaking Wade you know pretty much what they'd use it for they would use it for fur but yeah there's also they cross Fox and he's quite a beautiful sample himself then the silver platinum fox and those on and on and on and on what man has been able to do by genetics but yet for the most part those are not the ones that we'd like to look at because those are raised in a pen they are raised and what are their trained were they are fed never had a wild day in their life so they really wouldn't know what to do in a vineyard because they are hand fared hand raised and then somebody kills them and they use them of course for their fur but the most of the ones that's really going to get - you and I are going to be the ones that are going to be wild in nature because that's the way we are born wild in nature and actually your nature is closer to a fox and probably what you'd want acknowledged because we are animal not your soul now but your body is animal one just before you got saved it still is so you take the Holy Ghost off of a human being and that human being will do things an animal never thought of doing an animal will kill but an animal does not commit premeditated murder an animal will kill for sustenance or it will kill because another animal is threatening its own kind and the animal does not have the ability to sing and do as a human being that's why human is lower than an animal without the Spirit of God on them and the church said that's right now once this so these little foxes that you and I would deal with they're all sizes or all shapes they're all colors but the one thing we want to focus on is that they all start out very small now let us look tonight at this first little guy always a cute little fella my seems very very harmless he doesn't seem like it cause any about any problems until you look at the end results of this little guy he's called the fox of slothfulness Wow the Fox of slothfulness now let's look at him shall we proverbs chapter 12 verse 27 the slothful man roasts us not that which he took in hunting but the substance of a diligent man is precious now this guy that Solomon writes about and he speaks a lot about this particular class of people and a lot of what the Bible would actually speak about when it would come to the sluggard or the slothful is more of the natural man than it would be the spiritual man but many times you found they run hand in half so your Solomon here in other places in song Psalm house Ecclesiastes he will refer to a man that's basically sluggard that he doesn't work or he doesn't do much naturally but we don't want to look at it just so much in the natural sense but we want to focus in parallel of this that it also runs in the spiritual sense as well being spiritually lazy spiritually sluggard or a spiritual sloth I'm he's ever seen the animal sloth well let me give you an example of how they move he's 150 years old before he's ever a father and he finally reaches up and gets a branch with a leaf on it he starved to death time he gets it to his mouth that's the sauce now this is where the word of course comes from sloths for a man always say we have Church now what'd he say we all got cleaned up took shower hope you did anyway got all dressed up and everything since we're already here I figure we ought to go and have Church now I want you to notice is the way that Solomon sets this slothful man the slothful man roasts just not that which he took in hunting now you the slothful man he goes out now he's either hunting a rabbit or a bird or a deer or whatever more that they would have hunted in that day and he goes out and he hunts he gets up early and he gets up and prepares himself takes him of course a long time to get Sarkozy's the sloth but he finally gets sad and you know whatever so whatever was chance of what if it was he got this animal and he finally made it back to the house but by the time he gets back to the house he is so wore out and he is so exhausted from all the energy that he put forth into this hunting trip that when he gets back to the house he decides he's not going to eat it after all because he is so wore out he has absolutely tuckered out so the slothful man roast is not that which he took in honey now look at the perspective here the Solomon brings into view and watch how he parallels the diligent man with the slothful man the slothful man roasted not that which he took us in hunting but the substance of a diligent man is yes now he will contrast the diligent man with the slothful man and several other different instances but here he compares a man who actually went out put forth the effort to become a Christian or I mean a hunter and the action hunted and he salts something and he got something that was apparently edible something of some value and once he got it he never actually went through the final process to eat that and become one was what he hunted out so he goes through the process of being a Christian they got saved so on and so on and so on but he never really goes on to take the flesh of that which he had hunted and eat that unbecoming one with that what she's taken into his heart now he contrasts that then with the diligent and he says but the substance of a diligent man is precious not an amazing how that he looks at what the slothful man is taken which is now his he will now be responsible for it because it says he has taken a life and if he did not use that life for our purpose that was to provided for he'll be responsible to God no matter how brother Brandon bloss said people kill an animal's just to kill him and laying there God will judge them for murder people that drive up and down the road and shoot animals and try to do all that thing it's a sin I said it's a sin now if you've got a need for to use for that's one thing killer to kill your murderer in your heart so this man took this substance it was now his he was now responsible for taking its life what's he going to do now with the substance he decides it's so much trouble to prepare it he'll have to skin it out he'll have to clean it he'll have to do all this son my goodness is going to be naptime the times he gets it all sodden and roasted and everything he's wore plumber so he just decides he's not going to do it so then Solomon contrasts this type of the God with the diligent man and he uses what the diligent man owns notice I said this I love this he said substance or the possessions of a diligent man is precious now listen this you can tell a lot about a human being but how they value what God has given them now you may never live in a house in the ridges you may never own a great big build business that makes all kinds of money but you know what your aspect on it should be that if God allows you to live in a single-wide trailer and God never gives you more than a 1953 Volkswagen Beetle and you've got a pretty good job at paints of minimum wage you ought to be so grateful for God for every pair of shoes you've got you ought to be grateful for every pass socks you've got even if they do have holes in them you ought to be grateful forever shirt I've repaired breeches every dress ever pumpkin ever watermelon ever slicer bacon because to the diligent man his substance has value to the slothful man it makes no difference what he owns what he has it's like he does not matter it has means nothing them you understand you can answer to God for what you have in life you're gonna answer to God not only for what you have but how you've treated what God gave you and people spend a lot oh I wish I could be like so-and-so why would God and trust you with a million dollar house when you don't even take care of a 12o 60 single-wide trailer well amen brother Donny now whenever slothfulness will begin to grab ahold of an individual's heart nine times out of ten or never remain the natural realm but it'll move over into the spiritual realm as well well notice this enrolments of Proverbs rather 1519 the way of the slothful man is as a hedge of thorns but the way of the righteous is my point now watch in contrast now you know what's amazing is that you might be both of these people and these verses in the same body your own flesh may there's nothing but a sloth but if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost his speech you up now that's gonna be a miracle from a sloth by the time you get your hand up to praise God we've changed songs three times we're not even in one of them kind of songs but God gets a whole to you from the inside and gears up that's awesome before you know it you're raising your hands at the right time you got them down at the right time you're clapping them at the right time and you want to see an overcomer you are overcoming the sped-up want is overcoming the slow down one that's a greater miracle than if God would have turns you into a rabbit cuz if you stand up like a rabbit us and a rabbits nature to round here and go there but God leaves you and that old small body to the change takes place oh [Applause] ma the way of the slothful man is as a hedge of thorns because he is slothful he imagines thousands of things of why he shouldn't do whatever it is he's supposed to do now it's not necessarily real but it's real to him or her and it becomes as a hedge what a peculiar way to like in a human being now notice Solomon says the way of the salt for man is as on a head now you know as a man would look at a heads most of you are probably seen his rows and how they will start out and then they start out they of course we're all gonna start out very very small as a matter of fact they could be plucked up by the roots by hand without a whole lot of strenuous effort but if they are left alone and left to themselves they will make a heads roll that you'll cut yourself all to pieces trying to get rid of them you see that's the way sins and temptations are whatever the Royal foxes are come in at ass awful man or woman that's not playing reading the Bible don't what they ought to do and a little hairs will sprout up its head and then another and then another or they look small they look very insignificant it doesn't look like it's gonna bother anybody it's just sneaking over and looking on your smartphone that's something you should look at well praise the Lord brother darling and the next thing you know you're addicted why because a hedgerow growed up in your life and it started out with something that big sticking its head out of the ground but the slothful man says it's awful hard out there my Guinness it's 85 in the shade I think I'll wait till fall I believe my wait till things cooled down a little bit and then I'll get out there with a mattock I might even hire somebody to come over with a backhoe and dig that thing up I'll tell you one thing course and fall gets there he decides he's gonna rest all through the fall because it's just so hard still it's just a really bad fall and it's JA who knows he might get out there and catch on fire something or something bad may happen a slothful person can imagine some of the most bizarre circumstances there's one good thing that they are good at that's imagination well praise the Lord you understand why this imagination comes from their slothfulness their slothfulness produces this type of bizarre imagination I do have an advantage on you I have other scriptures in front of and you're waiting to say where I'm going now what's this in the mind of the slothful man he looks and says this is so hard I just there's no way I can do this and it's you know what you saw my there's one and there's another there's another oh my Thanksgiving thanks you I had to think of it I don't believe in do anything now Thanksgiving it's holidays I always take all the holidays from spent it with my uncle my sushi Bell and everybody so hi Mon do nothing and then before you know I you know what the winter snows of December's born that is Krishna said well I never do anything on Christmas Day you know what in that was January oh it's too cold to do it now it's January in East Tennessee in the mountains and fabula soon as March rolls around I'll tell you one thing I want to go up to that Alton I'm gonna grab a hold of them horns and I want to tell mother Donnie brother Donnie lay hands on me and toss this devil out of me it's March March comes they spend the whole month every weekend at Dollywood how many all ever had Devils cast out at Dollywood I want to ask you to raise your hands to this how many has ever picked up a few Adal he would preach Jesus you see every difficulty is in the pass of the slothful individual Solomon said is the way of the slothful man Oh such a heavy thorn so every difficulty in the path of this type of a person it just secures and absolutely encourages them for inactivity so because the difficulty is there just don't do it cuz after all you'll not fail Oh that'd be so embarrassing I'd rather fall flat on my face ten thousand three hundred and eighty five times than to sit in a Pew and never make a move [Applause] I may stand before God with a lot of mistakes but I'll never stand before me and it'll say you were slothful nope ain't saying that to me notice how Solomon contrasts these ways now the way of the slothful man so it's not only the contrasts of ways but the contrast of characters I'll never forget years and years ago it's actually before I came to the message and I was preaching down in Louisiana preached and actually for brother Lance's grandfather I'm sister crystal and sisters in Thea's father but they're all of her and he took a text I told brother my throat was really sore in sunny more so won't you preach the morning I'll rest a little bit and I'll pick a back up on Sunday night he was one of them old fashioned Pentecostal preachers he hewed the line oh my he took his text and he preached about the amp consider the ant thou sluggard I'll tell you what time he got done on that the elder nerding got saved Oh My I've never forgot that I can't remember all the particulars and the wherefores and the wives but I fell for everybody in there I felt so sorry for him including the devil can't tell me he got done with it I dated it made you want to grab a hold of the altar and say God's tranvia tearing me apart I believe we need some of that friends and this are because the the Laodicean age we live here it's easy to become complacent and dilatory and cold and slothful you have to beg people to st. a special song you've got a bag him to come to repair me you got a bag I'm to pray for somebody that comes up to the altar what is the slothfulness you see the way of the sluggard is one of self prevention the devil actually don't have to do a whole lot they stop themselves because it's his inner complacency that so much on the inside of them so masala Tiff's are going down you know soft form an ass off a woman going down a rapid stream they hit Rapids they're not so bad they don't frighten them too much it's not white-knuckle stuff yet but they know from what they can see in front of them danger lays ahead but instead of trying to go ashore say you know what I'm out too far I better I better get back in there I'm gonna wind up in the mess here so instead of doing that thus awful man or just or woman will sit in the boat and they have their or they had the capability and the strength to stop it but instead of stopping it they just go well then in a few minutes they found themself and a cataract that is deadly now they drag out a and try to save themselves you can blame it on the devil all you want to the devil had nothing to do with him you defeated yourself the power that was given to you back yonder to stop this thing you never used it well praise the Lord but Terry Bell you guys think you can back up within the morning I may have to have you to preach to the mourner getting quiet on me I'm afraid I'm getting fired after this tonight you see he license his power by neglecting to use it think of it the slothful man or woman actually weakens themself by refusing to use the power that God has made available to them Oh God speak to our hearts Lord you see he is his own destroyer or so may I say for her though instead of grabbing a hold of the situation God helped me to use what you've given me a slothful man or woman just keeps going the Fed the thorn heads gets bigger and bigger and higher and higher and what was it one time controllable sin grow and before long hedge this individual in and they find themself headstand and it an amazing how heads doe it never grows a gateway what does it do close one beside the other beside the other beside the other none of them had the genetics in our said now these are gate hinges here and whenever this one stops here XY t o3 v Y it will stop right here leaves three foot and then CY three old four it'll start on the other side and it'll start going around that's not the way they're design they're designed for once in the company another another another another until they have hedged the slothful man around because he looks at what he's God all my and he doesn't look at in the real that what man in his right mind would want together a walk with God what woman in her right mind would want to give up an opportunity to be a daughter of God filled with the Holy Ghost come to church live for the Lord Jesus and give it up for prostitution give it up for drugs give it up for alcohol they're mentally disturbed our whole world friends is groping in insanity oh my maybe six months a year two three four before long they find themselves we're totally enclosed in a hedgerow that's impassable no gate unless you happens an old man of God he'll take a Holy Ghost Chainsaw lookout devil he made our chopper down as fast as you want him to but I'll tell you what a man a gods wanted to do he's wanting to take that thing and river up in the name of the Lord Jesus and cut out a walkway it may not be but just that way and you may have to turn sideways and get out like that you may be looking for a four-lane highway God don't always do it that way sometimes God will cut out a narrow path because you felt yourself to get in and you may have to fight to get out of it and a real person that sick of that heads will say I'm gonna fight every day of my life till I get out of this heads and I was living in here and being a slothful woman that is the way of a slothful man then what does God do turns out man a woman into a diligent person so they you to one hedge and another and another and another they become easily formed habits easily formed habits you ever seen anybody out miracle growing weeds wonder who in the world of this is phrase miracle grow on the Nettles who is it that this miracle go on the nettles and the bars and the thorns and the fifths who in the world does that nobody they'll grow you have to baby your files you have to baby your landscape and come on out you're a baby in you got to put down all kinds of man around your landscape and the glass will come up or through it anyway if they don't come up to it it'll burn yourself and come right up beside a bush and you said well in the world did that thing come from it's part of the curse don't you understand why it's easier for thorns to grow out of this than the seed of God don't you the Sun wash easier for evil worse to go out of this that's easier brother Larry it is for the good works of God it is a battle for the good word of God to grow out of this dirt pile like it or not your body its germanized to be a seed bed for weeds praise God is one reason we come to church you got a pastor that's loaded down with we'd be gone we'd be gone oh ma but notice the way of the righteous man now the way of the slothful man is a hedge of thorns but the way of the righteous is made plain and the word plain is paved it's a divine ordained way but it isn't just him sitting around and waiting on God but this man actually so part of this man's character and trait that God identifies it as the man's way and not his word lorry to God why the man is so in touch with God God gave him that seal in his heart the way of God is imprinted on his soul in so much that God would call it the man's way because the man was converted by the Spirit of God he used to run around is to drink he used to lie but he don't go no more and God so burst him by heavenly genetics that God put his own seed inside of that man or woman and breathed on them the Holy Ghost and God said I've got so much confidence in you I know you're not gonna fall I've sealed you to eternity you mine forever I am yours forever I'm gonna go ahead and call this your way [Applause] the continued reputation of this kind of a life becomes habits of good behavior well I don't want to get in a ritual I see you don't want to get in a ritual doing right but you want to get Ana bitch'll forming of doing wrong are you an imbecile oh what's out of the idiotic thought found a family sigh do you come from if I might have a form and a manner I'm gonna choose righteousness am I gonna do part of it without feeling I am because it's bred in me what about the difficult in this man's way oh he's got him he just don't pay attention to a lot too soft for man let's also say oh I said gravel roof oh no hurt my feet huh I'll get dust on my new shoes oh if I was to go for the church no I know I need more water God but what if I go back to my brother Donny Oh God what if I was to get so emotional now I get up once ever since I ran around the building then I'll think I'm crazy oh my goodness what what a violet no I think I'll just go on occasion and just Connie you know be a part of what's really going on but don't really get in too deep I'll worry about whether Donny and some of those other people are having Valley I believe they're fanatics well let me just going to settle it for you where you are that's right football fans have fanatics wrestling people have fanatics basketball fans have fanatics I'm a fanatic for Jesus Christ I am addicted to him and his word you see the soulful person looks at of assets difficulties and say it can't be done the diligent man looks has said where do we start [Applause] the sophomore man says what if I drop one of the big rocks the diligent man looks at it said God put it on my heart to come and have a meeting so he goes in down there and starts including our little stable of a thing the bully of the town comes in said what's that guy's on there sees a preacher holy means that hey hey no

said sir knocked him down God on top i'ma that's bear the cross alone Jesus give me strength just beat the tar out of it me said I'm the man gots a first night now slothful man would have packed up his briefcase his Windex and paper towels and left Dodge but you know what the diligent man's that I leave it here because God laid it on my heart to come oh my goodness friends may I say tuna may it not be just preachers it'll say that but may housewives say my young men saying my young ladies say our God has called me to be a Christian I'm packing up I leave I'm staying right here I'm not gonna be soft but the sauce for person can be a calculator square I don't say there's any way that can work out you it won't work out that's what I was thinking too it's too big if everybody at Happy Valley what's the st. I'd go I know some of them people that go up Erebor they got problems we don't deny that but the main thing we push around here is a problem fixer it's not how many problems we've got us how many how God can take care of little slothful man I look at well I tell you this looks bad so what a little bit of courage he has he talks himself out of it where it's all said and done just sits down grabs his remote or his game thing and merges himself in a world that does not exist in terms of the air conditioner and drinks in our sea you see one thing slothful person looks at as a heads that is not possible the diligent man looks at a hedge as being road level [Laughter] who already the god solitude alliance it could count all the brothers all the rest of mrs. Lord David looked at the prophet said his head was the size of a washtub imagine her eyeballs about that big around his dream and dancing in the Sun David look at enemy's fingers twitching I stood there about a month or so ago in that Valley I don't mind telling you I felt like David well we stood there and pulled off a side of the road and it kind of shot up like this brother Tim's putting a video and stuff for us together free to be able to see it the little hill come up like this the Philistines on this side here so on this side and a little drought broke down on the bottom I went down through there and picked up a bunch of them little stones I thought my what a privilege it is to stand right here or David stood so many many years ago hallelujah and he walked down and grabbed a whole two that you imagine looking that's the glory to God with a target that big how could you miss it but it depends on if you're a diligent man or a slothful man a slothful man that all gone I won't listen he'll feed me to the car cuz another sane man said let me have it you've signed your death warrant today buddy you cross the pulse the people of God you'll pay for it this is your hour of gas why diligent man knows this is my property this is my inheritance a name no for listening gonna get it no you one day the Pharisees come to the Lord Jesus and they begin to speak to him about Herod and Jesus said you don't tell that Fox what if your dealer tonight I want this to be your scene go tell that Fox this man herod antipas of us and heard the graves his son herod antipas it was a great man of power is also an adulterer also a liar also a political ploy and the Lord Jesus said you go tell that Fox today I do cures tomorrow I do miracles and in the third Pole and the third day I will be perfected you've got high blood pressure tell that Fox leave me in the name of Jesus you've got an addiction you're the now you're bound by temper don't tell that Fox my body is a temple of the Holy Ghost can I go on about proverbs 18 9 he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster you imagine belonging to that family one of your brother's names a soft on the other his name is waster and what was your name oma proverbs 19 15 slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and then I don't soul shall suffer so slothfulness AXA can rocked folks to sleep now don't just say naturally I was spiritually the brother/sister we've got a megadose from this last day of later to see him because the Laodicean flu is bad and it's really catch him you read the church age in the book of Revelation there you'll find out they had a bad case of lair to see and flu it was rich and increased with nothing which means their solution agencies coming and going in and out of their mind come on help and they were naked that's right and didn't know it and yet here they are they're also dealing now with this great thing of a deep sleep so the devil turned up go to sleep go

devil that's trying to rock me to sleep and Laodicea I'm gonna start scrolling and kick it and call until I get out of this constraint and I will because I'm getting ready for a rapture and I can't take it being slothful so just reach up out of your bassinet and smack at Oh devil in the mouth and then start yanking your little feet and taking your little hands and Jambres butter Donnie I wonder about you sometimes how wonder what do you take before you preach I'll take peals well yeah I do I take pills Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John first and second Corinthians Romans Philippians glacially monk what kind you take Manny well somehow jump in canoe in three times all I've been preaching today you can't wait on tomorrow it's your mind off you stupid canoe get your mind off you picnic tomorrow word the feasts well I think about a picnic notice again proverbs 1924 a slothful man how does his hand he's bosom and he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again I said my hands real cold so I'm gonna put it in my vest cause it's real cold I'm starving to death and there's food in the kitchen I mean it's the church but it'd just be so much trouble I left to get in the shower and taking showers then I have to get dressed again yeah it's a good idea cuz we will have you thrown in jail for coming naked then I have to park the car I have to walk up the steps to get into church it's wearing y'all now then I have to come in and no doubt somehow meet me at the door and have two shakes to myself I don't have to take my hand a time of live I just think I'll stay home and streamed but the time they get to computer I'm saying Amen you're dismissed well I'll catch them tomorrow your models get up at 3 a.m. look look you're you're laughing why because I'm putting it in sets extremity look how this man put it in such contrast it makes no sense but when a person gets under such slothfulness somebody that's on fire looks adamant thing they're mentally distraught because the excuses they make thank you Jesus a salsa man how does his hand in his bosom and we'll note so let's just bring it to him a second so he sits her nobody called me from the church they ain't got no love we called you eight to seven times it's just a slow you never heard the phone rang one her it loves to call the prodigal son who was it that visited him what's deacon was it that got ahold to his name tell me if people want to go to heaven there ain't enough hell to drive them back and if they wanted God don't want to go to heaven there ain't enough heaven to pull them in notice again proverbs oh this is a bad Fox in it proverbs twenty thirteen the slothful man says there is a lie I shall be sighing in the streets look at these excuses they're absolutely insane absurdity assess this person there is a line with that which means that were without referring to in the wilderness area is not even know word close to where he lives but the lioness oh my god it's in the Serengeti not even the half-hours budget but if I go out of the street it might kill me somehow to get a white vest was here look at how absurd small fulness destroys people friends the slothful man since there is a lime without now he ain't seen one he probably never even heard one in his life but in his mind well was that aligned no it was your house cat nitwit scratch scratch cockroach no problem let there's a line without oh I may be killed on the street if I come out so the best thing for me to do is stay home this is the soft full person now but this stage the foxes have grown up had young ones and they got dens all around this person's life you see well the slothfulness removed from this individual all this imagination and lies and stuff that is so real to them for the most part this volume would live from because it's all associated what's love honest and excuses and more excuse some of the excuses I have heard for people not coming to church here I need to write a book sometime if I ever had time it would be a best-seller excuses excuses we hear them every day what if I go to church oh my god what are you going to apply that philosophy don't you ever dare step your foot in Walmart or your favorite steakhouse or your favorite drive-through place they don't keep you from going to Walmart they don't keep you from going to win these or Hardee's or McDonald's whatever your food is you go in and get what you want and you leave if you had that same attitude about the house of God I don't care how many Devils come here you're doing that I'm going to see them I'm going I'm going to get fed I'm going to get some from God they ain't keeping me away God's laid it on my heart that's my church and I'm staying there till God tells me different can I have a little more time y'all are cutting for punch Supernature proverbs 24 30 I will mother filled of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understand that notice the room and water setting is for the Song of Solomon it is a vineyard so when by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man that was void of understanding are you thinking one sense of the word how about a man like that of a wind up for anything but God is merciful God will give grace God will save all kinds of people God will save people that you and I wouldn't give them a nickel God will save people and God knows exactly what they'll do he knows that many of them will turn away from him down the road 5 years 10 years and he'll bless them in love them I'm gonna shock you the prophet of God said God loved Cain that's right he said he loved Cain and went after him God is safe some people even in six months time or a year's time wouldn't even speak to him but God is a merciful and a loving God he'll reach down to people he'll help people that only uses him as a spirit are and when they get back up on the road again they throw God in the trunk and don't want to speak to him again but he is a merciful God I'm so glad aren't you so God will give people things sometimes they don't even deserve now remember Solomon was a very devious a very industrious type of an individual how this must have struck him a man genius a man of brilliance a man who loved gardens and trees and no doubt this must have happened to him at this way Carroll that he walked by and he saw and he knew this man and he saw this place in this vineyard he just tore his heart out knowing what the potential was for this vineyard to be I went by the field of a shawl for the vendor of the main void of understanding so the field and the vineyard are not his house and card necessarily but let's look at it as his spiritual possessions he saved is forgiven maybe even justified maybe lived a sanctified life but he begins to neglect that which God has given him let me tell you something friend every mortal of sins before God one day will stand without excuse or you say what if I bribed you still be able that excuse you know what if you ain't bribed you can still live a pretty good life by the help of God there's gonna be all kinds of folks that's gonna come up to the Tribulation Period and they're going to be pretty good people you know hard cuz they don't want to go to hell so basically those of you well I bribed ain't going you'll stand there before God and be thrown into the pit one day because there will be people on the center and they're not brought a bit more than that trees right but they say God I don't want to go to hell I don't want to be lost I want to do the best I can I want to live a good life God you've got a place in heaven for me and I want it and you know what they'll be there that day there'll be millions times millions of them that will stand there with no more than that they're not elect they're not chosen of God they're not the predestinated but they're whosoever will and God made them on offer and they grab it [Applause] oh ma now watch this man brings Baroness because of neglect to punish Seoul or this woman look in verse 31 and lo it was all grown over with thorns Wow who planted the umbrellas you mean this man God after I went to all that work and planted it all then thorn ever were Solomon looked was thorns neglect brings thorns how automatically don't never forget this this grows thorns easy this grows neglect and slothfulness and saying easy these bodies are sin it don't need no help friends this is why folks struggle with Christianity they just don't understand it it's so much easier to live the life of a backslider it's easier to live the life of a softball toppers it's so hard it's so hard it's so hard you see what they're talking from the dirt you get a drop of that eternal life down inside of you your worst day as a Christian better than your best ever living for the devil low levels all grown over the thorns and nanos had covered the face face and the stone wall was broken down so this briars nettles on the face and the stone wall which separated this garden from the rest of the world compromise allowed things to come in I know folks don't like walls I know folks that's one thing they hate us for this message because we preach separation they call them prison walls we call them palace walls and garden walls a man in this country that was going to build a garden he's absolutely out of his mind if he don't build the wall Almighty God gonna build a garden called a bride and not put a wall around her no sir not my father he's gonna put a wall around her and he's gonna put me in line Nehemiah in case the wall just broke down I hope God will help me tonight that I'll be able to help you as may may I be a nehemiah to you or I can be able to stand up and say brother let's rebuild this wall let's be able to restructure this wall not to buy Oh make fun of us well all the rest of our make fun of us but we're rebuilding our prayer life we're going to rebuild our supernatural walk with God why because God said we can have it I'll have a Jerusalem without a wall I have a garden without a wall well I have a Christian experience without a wall you'll never keep it so Solomon lost bonny sees this beautiful beautiful place maybe remember the former days in the life of this man or maybe the life of this father and it saw what a beautiful thing that was or it's a beautiful garden with all types of exotic fruits and plants and flowers and that had all kinds of finds and Maya it was beautiful so the Hat had a watchtower in order to watch it they had a wall around it they had a press they had all these things that was there and this guy gets it you see him uptown you see him over here and you say hey shouldn't you build my own business I don't believe in purchase I play tapes I don't need no prints are telling me what to do I guess not if you're a goat if you're a sheep you still believing preachers keep in mind you're listening to tapes only you can always pick what one you want to hear you control fast-forward rewind and everything else preachers don't come with a remote Oh sometimes some of you wish I did that away when I got on something you didn't like it then whenever I said something you really like that you want to throw it across the church to somebody else you'd rewind it y'all just have me back and forth back and forth I come with a remote alright but the Holy Ghost has it so you can't tell me when to preach what to preach how long to preach how short to preach how emotional a couple children and I know one a bunch of these backslidden message people want to listen to tapes only they don't want know a man of northern man of God just stand right and preach the Living Word of God and tell them where they're living in this day so what is the state of this garden been brought to the heart in this case it's not run into movies it's not money women popularity solemn and lazy non one thing swath fulness so a place that was so fertile so beautiful now the forms are hit hot the nettles have grown so much by the John they're creeping over the wall you can no longer than getting the gate in the wall itself is so deteriorated and broken down animals come and go people come and go there's no way to protect it the thorns evil habits would start in a person's life the nettles being the things which defenses which those things cost to others you see when you walk down the street you're not on just representing yourself you're representing us as a church family oh I know so-and-so from up in Happy Valley yeah I know some of them too but we got some saints here as well as some of them other kind oh we've got enough of them other kind more than what I like but that's the way it is no it was all grown over the thorns and nettles and that covered the face stirrup and the stone wall thereof was broken down oh my then I saw and considered it well I looked upon it and received instruction I hope we can do likewise that and the close of this yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to see now this dude was a professional sweeper I mean they didn't if they slept in class ah that's it your pillow got a certain spot that you'd like to just kind of they excel and slothfulness so they fold their hands and they see that coming on your church table I get so sleepy at Church time you better get that devil off of you [Applause] you ever notice sitting an amazing how many family your kids get sick on Church nights in animation y'all feel great all week long - Wednesday everything's great till Saturn than that everything's great - Sunday morning it's amazing how fast miracles happen after church on Sunday morning around here not only here but other churches as well folks is sick they'll pray for songs all breakfast loans I'll pray for so and so I go through Dairy Queen for 13 even after I went home and rested a little bit now they're going through the dairy couldn't giving them a s'mores blizzard Wow where our prayers must already went to effect [Applause] you had a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep so shall that poverty come as one that traveler has moves from one place to another and thou want as an armed man so now you're going to be faced with a professional warrior that's armed and he is facing a slothful individual the little fox everybody agreed with midnight we need to kill this dude this tank let me read you a few more scriptures Kenan then we'll go a little different direction in the morning please yesyes 10:18 by much slothfulness the building decay us through either honest of the hands the house drop us through by idleness and slothfulness the building decays in the building will fall through it just makes sense it's just logical so spiritually what about our walk was God a prayer life or time to read the Bible and for instance I'll be honest we're under the same bondage that I preached it to you years and years and years ago the bondage of time we never have enough time I'll be 62 years old here in a few weeks I'm at the retirement age apparently the Social Security apartment think so cuz they sent me and Carol thing the other day in the mail I told her I said can you believe that whoever thought we'd ever got old enough to get this in the mail I'm glad y'all think it's funny but I thought when people got older I had this in my mind as a kid that I see them old people down in Kentucky sitting on the front porch for my brother horn hey I always thought I thought it was old people you know 50 60 year old people that did that now I'm wondering when do people ever get but once it ever get any better I used to think man you get old I mean old preacher you'll get to where your burdens get lighter yeah mine's harder now in the everywhere my difficulties my burdens both private and public both family both church internationally you to be and every other way yes and when does it ever not you have to be 70 or 80 oh god don't ever I gotta wait that long before they leave me alone so you know what we have to do well there were 60 or 40 or 20 or five or 95 we set our pride our eyes upon the prize you know I keep Norman you know what they said that old preachers I don't retire they just put them out to pasture pa sto R may God give us strength may God give us strength may we shake slothfulness idleness I made love to be remembered tonight before the Lord all praise God let's pray together Lord Jesus I know these types of services are sobering they've already make us look at ourselves father but I pray that you would help us it wouldn't fall on ground that is so hardened Lord Jesus but may it fall on fella ground that's broke up by the pile and the disc oh Jesus may the nutrients of the Soul wrap around the seed word I don't think there's probably a person in here tonight including myself that wouldn't say we need to move up a little higher Lord God searches almost of us aren't like this slothful examples that we read of know so more of them would be just in that baby fox stage so some of them are just where the little fox is gnawing around and they've laughed with me tonight it's these contrasts that have brought and they thought how terrible it would be to be such a thing but if they don't change the direction in six months or a year they'll be exactly will have preached tonight because the elements are making them slothful is nibbling at their little vine tonight oh don't come in great bites it doesn't come as it was years ago whenever I was bit by that Fox is a boy and it laid open my hand with its teeth and my hand immediately went numb no no it's not like that but it's so gentle and so easy that we might not even feel it but little by little we go to feeling the effects cooling off and our zeal is in its greatest it was by that time the hedge is already grown if we're not careful the gate out will be growing nettles and briars as well thank you for these things Lord Jesus to speak to us I take them to not Lord as a son of God I don't believe that I'm slothful I don't believe and I'm at all like this man or woman these examples that I preach tonight but let me go on to say neither do I want to be so Lord I look at these examples and I do it's like Solomon of old a look and are steady and I receive instruction I receive instruction Donnie if you don't want to be this way then avoid this and this and this yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord a will a will praise God help each of us in my father thank you for your word your word makes us free praise God we love you tonight Lord Jesus I pray

for your word tonight I know these are simple illustrations and they're not great theological terms and wouldn't be classified as deep and so on and so on yet I think we all can relate to it I think we all can be witnesses of truths to know that these things work on our lives it's one thing we so love about the Prophet that you sent us in this day Lord he would be honest enough to tell us he'd get discouraged and he'd get down and he'd fight this and go through that to give us an insight into the life of a great servant of God but yet it was not so great that he was superhuman or beyond human test not only him Lord Jesus but when you come to the earth you experience such things I read today when your prophet said when they come to you that day and said show us a sign and said you responded you was discouraged when you said it a wicked and evil adulterous generation seeks after the sign and no sign will be given but Jonas the Prophet now read that up on the Haqqanis you allowed yourself to feel discouragement thank you Lord Jesus for that if you had experienced sickness and you would experienced sexual temptation and all kinds of other things and would have left discouragement out than when we got discouraged with whatever of life we would have went to you you couldn't have understood but you allowed yourself to feel discouragement thank you for that it shows your love to us so when I come to you're discouraged by the Wes these sisters these young people these brothers no matter who they are whatever it's brought on their discouragement you can relate to our feeling thank you so much for loving us in such a way that has been God's you could never understand such being God's you could never even feel such but becoming man you said outside the city and held your head and groans with a headache you were tempted by women tempted by drinking bothered by discouragement thank you my brethren that is part of us looking at you and the flights of stairs for we know stairs work both ways miss Jacob of all was laying there and made a stone his pillow and he looked and he saw the angels of God ascending and descending he saw the ladder anchored up in heaven anchored down on the earth we saw the angels coming and going on that ladder and the prophet tells us that ladder was Jesus Christ so you ascended and descended you condense and when you come down not just from the angelic realm but to become a man to feel sick to feel troubled to feel discouraged and despondent at times thank you Lord Jesus so when that little Fox comes around trying to discourage us and tell us we can't make it we can go to you with that sad lonely feeling and know that you understand that you'll not rebuke us you'll not chastise us but you can look at us with understanding in your eyes and say I know how you feel thank you Father go with us now pray Lord bring us back in the morning if it be pleasing to you would you speak to us again Lord you've been so kind to us we hate to keep asking you but you told us to ask much better joy might before if we tear another hundred years if time would want another thousand there'll be people still asking and you'll still be granting and still hearing we love you lord thank you for the service tonight thank you for coming by and speaking to us visiting us Lord Jesus we don't want to just eat at your table and not say we thank you but we thank you for the food we've received tonight we thank you for the correction the encouragement I'll thank you for the whip and the chastising whatever you sent us thank you lord praise God we love your father go with us now Lord God we love you in Jesus name Amen praise God you love him turn and shake hands with somebody say god bless you brother sister good to see you in the house I'm
