mentioned and I'm sure that probably most of you know it with the Jerry Phillips Pass yesterday afternoon um we're getting more on the other side than we've got left here aren't we what wor matters more than anything else in life no matter how rich famous important what your name might be known among millions of people but what would it really matter when it comes time to cross over what will matter more than anything else is that you're at peace with God aren't you glad we can have that in our lives I was with brother Jerry yesterday morning and um he was asking me about brother Harvey and brother Harvey was doing he had heard the service on Sunday where i' requested prayer for Justin and he was asking about Justin and there he was he did four stents in his heart then had a major heart attack asking about other people that's what eternal life does for you it helps you to where even when you're dealing with hard times you can think about other folks eternal life is amazing isn't it um sister Linda fell last night and fractured three ribs um very very very painful fall one of the ribs that punctured part of the Lum and uh they put her in intensive care going to put her on oxygen so that she doesn't develop pneumonia so not only she did him with a broken heart and grieving but also this terrible terrible pain and stuff so would like to remember remember her in prayer tonight anybody else have a need on your heart just raise your hand there before the Lord before we read the word let's just pray together shall we Heavenly Father we never know what what the day will bring when I walked into that Intensive Care Unit yesterday and saw brother Jerry and took him by the hand and I didn't realize it would be my last time to see him alive we talked and had prayer together and if I only known it would have been the last time I seen him I would have probably stayed a little longer talked a little more help us I pray father to live so that if we are to leave that very day we can leave every everything intact everything in order cuz the truth of it is we never know when we'll be our last day so we want to have everything taken care of you see how we are as Mortals we have our shortcomings our failures our mistakes but we're so glad as your Prophet has taught us that when we lay down at night that we can be able to tell him we ask him to forgive us for anything that we've messed up during the day and anything that we've done that's displeased him and then we can feel like that at the close of the day we've done our best and we know Lord that if we are trusting in you and believing in your report then when we stand before you that day it will be written and said about us the way it was about Abraham that he believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness sake may that be every one of our testimony Lord Jesus because we know our flaws and our mistakes would certainly outweigh any good we would ever do if there's not a mediatorial value that will step between us and our Humanity that wouldn't be a human ever be saved but you knew that so you made a way and we are so grateful we pray for the Phillips family tonight Lord and the church family and all the friends that knew brother Jerry and for sister Linda were asking that you'd be merciful to her and help her Lord during one of the greatest losses in her life and now dealing with this physical pain herself Lord Jesus would you be be mindful of each of them Lord the other needs that were uplifted here tonight signifying by the hand being raised would you move for them Lord help us as we look into your word father we are such a needy people but we bring all our needs our petitions our requests before your throne and we leave them there with you knowing that you know how to take care of each one of them in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God bless you isin't it good to be in the house of the Lord yes what a privilege it is for us to be gathered together once again let's turn to Revelation chap 10 verse one if you would Revelation chap 10 verse one one of my favorite subjects in studying and and uh talking about is redemption because I see God and in so many ways of not only human life but in nature and how that God redeems and that God will let the leaves fall off of a tree the potass calcium all the nutrients that's there in the leaves will fall off and the roots in a matter of time will pull them right back down into the ground and the leaves will come back up again in a new form that's Redemption God does the same thing of course for human beings for everything that serves his purpose there is a resurrection to it Revelation 10 verse 1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven closed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now notice the Raymond he's dressed for the occasion this look and this appearance would not have worked on Calvary this look and this appearance would not have worked before Pilate but it works in Revelation 10 and he had in his hand a little book open now remember the same book in Revelation 5 but the book was closed in Revelation 5 but now it's opened and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roar us and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to Rite now remember John heard what they said it was not a mystery to John because when they thundered he heard exactly what they said so he gets his pen his scroll paper there and he's going to write it down but he said I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer so it's the Declaration of a Heavenly angel that says time is running out so it's a dispensational change of something that's fixing to happen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God want you notice that John didn't put this in plural form the mysteries of God but the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets may the Lord bless his word you may be seated I realize for many down Through the Ages Revelation 10 has been much of a mystery within itself as Revelation the entire Book of Revelation is to many but yet we believe that God has promised in the last days that he would make known those things which was necessary to be able to produce a faith that will lift us into a Rapture in Revelation we find the deity of God we find the Sevenfold personage of God as he reveals himself starting in chapter one and then chapter 2 we move over chapter three we begin in the the church ages chapter 4 we see where it's the end chapter 5 the little book is there in the hands of him that set on the throne and then we keep coming till we arrive to Revelation chap 10 with a a significance of something that God had not shown in the previous chapters and we've been looking at the book of Ru and how it parallels to Revelation 5 and also Revelation 10 because we are a people of redemption and we are a people that are living we believe in the closest stage that has ever been to the Redemption of our bodies I think it benefits us as the people of God to look into the word that we might be able to find out who we are and what's prophesied for us so God could have great prophecies and yet if we lived in those a that day when those prophecies were supposed to come to pass if we were not aware of what God had promised for the season we could live much of our lives and we could go to church we could participate in religious services and believe that there was a god there was a Heaven There was a hell there was a devil there was good there was right there was wrong there was evil and so on but if we were not illuminated to our age in which God had promised certain things now we know what one of the reasons why that the Jews so missed him 2,000 years ago because they had taken the promises of what they felt like applied to the Messianic coming so they took Genesis 3 where God himself said that he would raise up a seed it would bruise the serpent they took the Messianic prophecy of psms they took the Messianic prophecy of Hagi 2 they took the Messianic prophecy of Zechariah 7 Zechariah 14 Jeremiah 23 they took the prophecy of Malachi 3 they took so many of those things and they put them together in a way they thought that he was going to come but the problem was it was according to their thinking and not God's thinking so when God sent a forun which was Isaiah 40:3 we better know this man as John the Baptist also the fulfilling of Malachi 3:1 and the first part of Malachi 4 and when God did that instead of them becoming Anointed with the anointing that was on John they stayed with what their church had to say and what their forefathers had to say because after all it had been handed down to them from their fathers and their fathers and their fathers and who is this guy he was a man that was very odd very unusual clothed in Camel's hair and he ate Locust and Wild Honey a very strange sort of a guy and had no you know no really no approval of the Sanhedrin he was not a Pharisee he was not a a scene he was not a zealot they really didn't know where he belong as a matter of fact they sent some people people one day and said you know our our overseers sent us to find out who are you anyway and and where do you come from and where do you get the authority to do these things that you're doing he answered them simply by the scripture and they walked away just as blind as they were before they came to it because they did not catch the anointed word for the hour they were living now John was sent to forun this coming Messiah that had been prophesied about for thousands of years but if you don't catch the Forerunner I wonder how many that miss the Forerunner that will catch the true message when it arrives so those who minimize the value of the Forerunner in every age of God how many of them identify with the true Messenger most of them don't so we can see the value of us as the people of God that if God foran his second coming with one with the spirit of Elijah on him again also prophesied by the same Prophet Malachi that prophesied of the first Rong that forerun his first coming I believe we better listen we better pay attention or we will become like that age 2,000 years ago so they went to the temple they went to the synagogue they offered the turtle does the pigeon the lamb the Pascal lamb they they took the cedar they all those rituals and routines and they kept the Passover they kept it to the letter all of that they done and yet they crucified the Lord Jesus Christ now he did not come without a war and his Advent was so great I want you to notice how that God will categorize his word it's not for every event that God will send a forerunner now as far as we know Moses never had a forerunner Joshua never had a forerunner Jeremiah never had a forerunner Ezekiel never had a forerun so when God sends a for Runner before a messenger we better pay attention because it's something extraordinary even above and beyond someone like Moses Joshua Zachariah Malachi Hagi of all of them prophets you understand what I'm saying none of them had a forerunner before them so when God sent a forerunner to the Earth the people should have known by that Forerunner it was something that had never been since the dawn of time that God had ever sent a forerunner to a prophet before the people should have known that if God is going to do that then it must be something of Great Value and importance a coming of a prophet himself is so important to God because he is the very mouthpiece of God himself and then for God to forun it must have been such value in the eyes of God and what did they do to him well of course they said he was crazy they did not believe him they ridiculed John they made fun of him and so if they did that to the Forerunner it should not be an unusual thing that when the main attraction was reveal that they never knew it either they never caught what God was doing why their treatment of the Forerunner was the epitome of the way they were going to treat the main attraction now listen don't be blind that you and I have also been privileged by God that he would send a forerunner again before the second coming of the Lord Jesus but what all is involved in that second coming you see it is more than just a Corporal appearing of our kinsman redeemer coming to claim the book it is more than just a resurrection and a Rapture as great as those events are it is more in the coming of the Lord which is the mystery of the seven seal now in the seven seal there's multiple things it's like layers that lays in the mystery of the seals and in the seven seal as the prophet says no one knew that was the minute or the hour that Christ would come that's right now in that coming it was not the resurrection neither was it the body change for the living what was it it was the word presence of Jesus Christ himself not the Corporal body now the the corpor body when he returns he will not even put his feet upon the Earth but it was a reappearing again of the son of man to unite him and his bride together and he could not trust it just to a profit alone now if we would have been so blessed by God just to have the ministry of Malachi for in this day that within itself oh my it's just it's beyond words of blessed that we would have been but Malachi 4 foran the great one now if God sent one that was so great which was a forerunner what was fixing to take place now because Redemption has different cycles and phases for us Redemption is not only coming out of something but it's also going into something and in order for our Boaz to play the full part of the Kinsman redeemers ship it was also the same transitory power for him a coming out of something and going into to something else so he had to come out of the Eternal out of the very Heart Of God now notice the Kinsman Redeemer work he had to come out of something and go into to something else so he came out of Eternity and he went into something else what was that something else a body in time he came out of a glorified State remember he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same as in the beginning with God all things are created by Him and without him was not anything made that was made and of course we know then that the Bible goes on to say and there was a man sent from God whose name was John he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light that all men through him might be saved so God here brings the word and then it merges the Forerunner right there with him in those verses and God did a tremendous thing now this was the stage of redemption in the act of condensation that he's changing himself from that which is invisible to a form that can die a form that can feel pain a form that can look like a human in so much that people would look at him and just consider him to be an ordinary man now the Effigy Of The Lord Jesus was not something that you just stand around and light rays would just Pierce out from him like that everybody would have known there was something special about him had that happened but he looked so much like an ordinary man that people would have looked at him and they would have never known that he was God they would have seen that there was something about him of course by his works and the way that he talked but his flesh was so much like ours that he could bleed his flesh was so much wrapped and time that it died his body died on the cross he had pain he had sorrow he felt anguish the Lord Jesus felt sadness and happiness he rejoiced and he felt all types of emotions just like we do and yet there was something on the inside that was greater than anything man had ever seen before so the part of redemption that he did at his first Advent was he must pay the price the penalty must be met so the justice of God can be emerged into the penalty now remember when man fell and man stayed across the chasm every man from Adam until that time died except for those that were translated but there must be the justice of God that is going to be met so God can get the book back into the hands of his children because that book holds their titled deed of redemption if the book is not returned to man now don't misunderstand me no matter how much he died on the cross how much blood come out of his body and the agony that he experienced that is only one part of the cycle of redemption the book was not at the cross do you understand the book was not there at the cross he never took the book at the cross I wonder sometimes if even some of our brothers in our own ranks if they realize the significance of preaching Revelation 5 and Revelation 10 it's like all they focus on is just the blood and the mercy seed at the cross and it's not they don't understand that the book at the death of the Lord Jesus the book was still in heaven he did not take the book at the cross the book was not at the cross the book was in heaven but the price was paid at the cross so that in Revelation five he could take the book when was that when did he take the book not on the cross amen not on Resurrection morning but there was a time a slot amen the end time Revelation 10 did not pertain to Paul The Book of Revelation was not even written in the days of Paul it was not written in the days of Peter and many of the original Apostles but it was given as a prophecy to the end time because they would not need rapturing face they would need Resurrection face so they would live their life they would preach the gospel they would be illuminated by the presence of God and they would go down to the Grave countless of millions of them but God knew there would be a people one day in that last age upon the Earth that would be alive when the Lord Jesus would come and there would have to be such a power revealed in that end time they becoming one with that word that one morning they would get up and brush their teeth and comb their hair and normal stuff that they would start out their regular day not knowing that that day is the last day of their mortality in a moment in the twinkling of an eye they will be changed by the power of God and there maturity will cause the resurrection Hallelujah and yet the great price that he paid we could never overemphasize what he did for us at the cross we could never thank him enough for the blood that he gave is that right and we know that the justice of God was never met in the Ten Commandments it only brought out more Justice and judgment it could not be met in the prophets they were the body of the word of the Old Testament symbolism being made but yet it could never be met in the prophets and God himself must produce the product and the law couldn't do it the prophets couldn't do it nothing else could do it and God made a demand and if God makes a demand and man cannot meet that demand God must meet it himself and he met it in the person of the Lord Jesus so in order to become our goel our kinsman redeemer he must become a man all man and all God never had been a creature like him on the face of the Earth he was the only begotten Son of God but let me just remind you the word goes on to say he was the firstborn among many Brethren he was was the first like that but he certainly was not the last well praise the Lord so what must he do he must from his own body the own Corporal body that was given to him upon the Earth carry within his Humanity the created blood of God which would be the bleach that would be able to purge man back to where man one day could handle that book himself and yet at the cross as we've been through it many many times before but at the cross he did not die the death of a righteous man he did not die the death of we know what some people would look at and say oh my this great holy righteous man he became our sin oh my the Bible tells us he who knew no sin become the our sin they all that the very righteousness of God could be handed to you and I aren't you grateful for that tonight he never lied he never stole he never done one thing wrong in his life but it's what he became that exacted from him the price and yet we know the value of things and we all certainly know with inflation how everything has gone up you're paying now more for groceries than you've ever paid in your life is that right you're paying more for gas you're paying more for this and that and the other we don't like paying that price but if we want it we have to pay it do we not the way the Lord God looked at it there could be no greater thing that he could do than to pay the ultimate price in order to bring us back not just save us oh my I wish people could understand there's more to the Cross than just being saved that's just the beginning of your walk with God there's so many wonderful things that he has laid up in store for them that love him my goodness children there's great things in the economy of God no doubt we've never even looked into I to the prophet had preached for years he said there are untapped resources that we've never even broke into yet but people get so happy just going to church well I gave my heart to God praise the Lord I'm going to go to I'm going go to church now I guess I'll go every now and anyhow where I need it or not and that's all I really need oh my goodness I I I believe there's so much more in God than what any of us have ever seen and it's not like well brother Don in the Millennium will get it why in the world would I want to wait to the Millennium I want what I can get right now don't you I want everything that I can be allowed to understand in the economy of God whatever it can be with my name on it let me have it Lord I don't want to just barely get it and can barely understand it now there must be a contract you understand the parallel of Christ Jesus and Boaz in that Boaz is looking for a legal match a legal match and he wants a bride that will be his and his only he does not want to share her with to he don't want to share her with no one else he wants her to be his amen the Lord Jesus wants exactly the same thing he does not want to share you or me with the world come on somebody he don't want you to be with him one night and the devil the next night and the Lord the next night the devil the next night or the Lord that morning and and the devil that night he wants you with him all the time and if the Devil comes knocking on your door you say get out of here devil I am already married to Jesus Christ we are already joined together by holy word Lord you leave right now I ain't got no time for you devil anybody feel that way by the grace of God you see but Boaz had a way that this must be done I me know that there was four stages by which Ruth was coming toight the last one was Ruth waiting and then the third one rather and then Ruth rewarded this is where we are we're in that waiting stage for our Boaz to finalize Redemption why are we still having Saints to die because our bodies are not yet redeemed I wonder why are are people sitting here tonight sick people their hair turning gray others is turning loose people got false teeth got glasses got contacts got canes got wheelchairs come on somebody why because our bodies are not yet redeemed and they are still subject to the weakness of the Flesh and you better believe the devil knows it too he knows every weakness you've got he knows every weakness I've got he knows how to hit us oh y'all want to have church tonight he knows exactly what to bother you with just like he does me and do we make mistakes we all do anybody made any this week oh praise the Lord glad to have you Angels that's with us tonight I see some hands that didn't go up but he knows all of that but one day he will lose his grip on us that's right but the Lord Jesus wants a bride that is his own how many of you Brothers here tonight that are married or you young men that are not would you want to share your wife with some of the other brothers in the church any of your brothers would you want to share your wife or some other man and she goes home with you tonight and then she goes home with some other man from the church uh tomorrow night and then the next night and you never know exactly where she at until it's your night again well no you wouldn't want that you said that's absolutely ludicrous I'd never want such a thing and yet we do the Lord Jesus that way we give him our leftover time our leftover commitment our leftover strengths amen many of you lay down at night and you're wore out and you ain't hardly got no strength left and you you fought Leo to seal like crazy and you lay there in the last three or four words you say oh Jesus Jesus amen there you go you're gone you give football you give baseball basketball Fox News MSNBC all during the day y' ought to take away some of that time from MSNBC and give some more time to the Lord Jesus to read his word to praise Him amen hallelujah notice this in Ruth 4:9 and Boaz said unto the elders and to all the people you Witnesses this day that I have bought all that was eliks and all that was chilon and Mayon of the hand of Naomi now I want you notice where we are in the cycle of redemption as we've looked at it a couple of Wednesday nights of what's going on with the Jews and all the oppression and all the things that are happening there remember Naomi was a part of the Redemption of Ruth God is focusing of course on his Gentile bride but he's also got his eye on Naomi and Naomi in this age is still over there in the land of Israel come on children and that our Redemption is tied also to Naomi so elik was gone chilon was gone Mayon was gone but how did he buy this how by what proxy did he purchase this Naomi Naomi so through Naomi he got Roose through Naomi now now she tried her best to discourage her she said go back to your mother go back to your Gods you know the beautiful beautiful verses there and she said I will not go where you go I will go where you die I will die where you're buried I will be buried your God will be my god oh yeah that's a gentile bride all right if you notice you wasn't a trinitarian either she said your God Elohim will be my Elohim your Elohim your elsh ey will be my elshad ey where you die I will die where you're buried I will be buried notice the judeo Christian Foundation of what we believe so how in the world could you ever get a Jew to be convinced that there's three gods in the New Testament when there's only one in the old well come on somebody but you realize that we are tied together I know that many Christians don't understand this tie in the judeo Christian bound as it's come together but it is through Naomi that Boaz will pull Roose out by doing what he what he allowed Naomi to do in his first Advent on the Earth first what did they do the Jews and what's he going to do in the last day he will gather them again and if you notice when we come down to the last part of this whenever God actually blesses Ruth with a child Naomi takes that child and becomes a nurse so here she is in the stage of her Redemption and that 144,000 will be with the bride on the earth in the thousand year reign oh yes I'll be so glad when we get done with them old Jews we ain't never going to be done with them old Jews as you call them God loves them and he's got an elect number there ain't enough devils in Hell there ain't enough bombs in Russia there ain't enough I don't care what they do they will never wipe them out of God's mind I want you to notice how Boaz looks at this he says moreover Roose the oidas the wife of milon have I purchased to be my wife whom I have purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance I believe there's a Ru in the last day that the Lord Jesus is going to raise his name that he's not dead either that's right he's Hebrews 13:8 the same yesterday today and forever well praise the Lord to raise the inheritance well you know that was in the days of the Apostles well only the apostles got the Holy Ghost well that's absolute nonsense whenever Paul went up in Acts chapter 19 and asked them about getting the Holy Ghost and they said how was you baptized he said well un John said that won't work now so they got re-baptized and the Holy Ghost fell on them they wasn't even the original 12 not only that but there's a person in this building tonight called Donald Lee Reagan Jr which is me I got the same holy ghost that Peter got on the day of Pentecost there's other people sitting in this building tonight men women boys and girls and you've got the same Holy Ghost don't you understand what you're doing the Lord Jesus is raising up his name and he's proving to people I'm not dead look at my wife I'm not dead I heal that one I save that one I done a miracle in that one's life what's he doing rais in his name that he's the same yesterday today and forever what an honor children what an honor oh praise the Lord that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his breth and the gate notice and from the Gate of his place ye are witnesses this day so the business transactions and this day we're settled at a gate so you'd have at least 10 Elders there of course our Lord wanted to outdo that so he got 24 but you had to have at least 10 Elders so Brother D had a piece of property and I'm going to buy that property me and brother D we go up to the gate of the elders and say all right brother what do you'all have but they said well brother Donnie wants to buy this property of mine I've got two two cows and three goats and 14 horses up there and about 32 dogs and I've got this that and other and we're going to settle this and okay so you agree to pay him that amount and D you agree yes I agree together all right now we are witnesses this day that Don is now the owner 32 dogs three Hogs 14 cows 37 horses you know whatever more all right and we exchang the money now what they would also do remember is that they would would take off their shoe because the way they moved about on that property for the most part it was by walking so Footprints meant possession so the man sometimes it was both sometimes it was one but it was required absolutely required that the man selling it had to take his shoe off and give it to the buyer sometimes the buyer would also turn right around and the seller would give him is you back but it was a significance that I give you my word I will not be walking on your property no more here's my shoe this is a proof Oh Glory to God I won't be back bugging you no more I'll tell you one thing I think that's what we need to do to the devil tonight some of us need to get pretty sick and tired of that devil trying to steal our health and steal our children and steal our home and steal our peace well come on somebody steal the things that the Lord God has done for us and we ought to take his shoe off him and say get out get out right now I want my health back I want my joy back I want my peace back take your shoe and get out of [Applause] here ye are witnesses he says this day that I bought it then he comes around and said I have purchased Ruth to be my wife notice in Ephesians 1:13 in whom ye also trusted now the New Testament version after that you heard the word of truth but I want you to notice they didn't stop there the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise oh my goodness that's New Testament Christians so then they just didn't hear and settle down praise God and everybody's favorite chorus I shall not be I shall not be moved the song leader won't move me the preacher won't move me no that's not the way the is the bride wants to have church I like that new song he sng just that's what we're here tonight for is it anybody come to see me well I didn't come to see you either did anybody here come to see Jesus I did too well if we're year for that purpose I believe we can see it yes sir now notice Paul said that after you believe you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise so your believing does not seal you all about but I I I believe Jesus died for me that's not the seal I believe he raised from the dead that's not the seal but the seal is the Holy Ghost acts 238 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you unto your children then that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen praise the Lord now notice he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost in verse 14 and he says which is the earnest of our inheritance look at the meaning of the word earnest the first installment paid as a pledge that the rest of the purchased inheritance will follow how many understand what payments are and he's got them okay so they make that convenient for us poor folks so whenever we buy things and we don't have the money to do it then we set it up on installments right and then once a month you know however it is you've got it set up the first the 15th the last of the month and you have to pay interest of course on that installment and you you know if you don't do it then they'll let you go with so many if you don't do it they going to reclaim that car that boat whatever it is that you bought so God said I tell you what I'm going to do I am going to set up an installment plan I'm going to give you one major big down payment and what it's going to do it's going to annihilate your own nature that is a big down payment it's going to annihilate your nature and it will Quicken that CG that I placed inside of you Hallelujah it will Quicken that c Gene and it will seal off your soul to the day of your Redemption and the devil will come knocking knocking knocking he'll aggravate you he'll tempt you he'll even talk you into doing things that's not right sometime but you'll repent every time and you'll make it right with me and the seal will still hold oh I'm so glad tonight when I get weary the seal still holds I'm so glad when I get low when I get in the valley that the seal wish somebody would have church with me tonight I'm so glad that whenever the Wall's falling apart the seal is still hoing I'm so glad when the government don't know what they're going to do the seal is still holy it will hold you it will hold me there's not enough devils in Hell there's not enough powers in darkness to break that seal it is ours it will hold us the first installment paid as a pledge now you see the reason some of you all wonder whether you've got the holy ghost or not is because sometimes we use so much of that first payment and sometimes we dip down into it and it just seems like we need a renewing or refreshing and this is why I founded preaching years and years generally when you preach the Holy Ghost is such a place and it'll raise it you know a question and people say oh goodness I I don't know if I've got it or not oh you know people get real serious and we should we definitely should but what I found most of the time the ones that that will really question theirself they're probably the ones that's got it and the ones that don't ever question theel they're probably the ones that don't cuz they're so Vince nothing ever touches them no way but them real genuine saints of God when they hear it preach and they sit there they B to fre oh God oh God I want to make sure oh God I want to make sure because there's something inside them they know there's more well of course there's more it's the rest of your payments it's the rest of your payments and many of us are wanting the rest of our payment that's what we're hungering for now but you've got to understand just because you're hungry don't mean that you ain't got the first down payment that down payment is what's making you hung hungry the first place but the devil will try to convince you because you're wanting more you ain't got it no that ain't the truth it's because that one payment is so good it's so powerful it's so rich and you think if it's that good and that's only a down payment I want the whole book oh yes sir I want the whole book I want my [Applause] inheritance the first and Stone paid as a pledge that the rest of the purchased inheritance will follow a portion of the purchase money paid as Earnest so we say God gives you $100 he say oh $100 would go very far today in today's economy with it oh boy well you use your faith to buy a little healing and you buy a little joy and you buy a little this and you say oh man I've only got 30 77327 left out of that oh my goodness I I need need a miracle for this well that brought it down to 5240 and then I need a little bit something else I'm down to 1275 that's the way we thinking in our mind oh goodness is it going to run out it won't run out you see that payment book is constantly renewing itself and you know he specializes in taking the oil when they ain't Harding none in the in the cruise and he specializes in taking a little handful of meal and he can just turn it into a whole lot of stuff that'll feed a whole lot of people come on somebody don't tell me old brother Don that was back in the Bible days oh no you see I sat at the house of a sister in India who had a very similar thing happened to her that she run out of meal and oil and the Great Famine struck that part of India and it lasted her for years some of the church people come into her church cuz they didn't have no food and her church people come over into her house she fed the pastor several meals fed people to the church several meal well come on somebody he wanted to take somebody well what if he would want to take you and prove his word and another word and let you prove it another word and another word he wants to prove his words if we will let him he might take us and prove his word that he's the same yesterday today and forever which is the earnest the down payment of our inheritance until the Redemption of the purchased possession so The Possession has already been purchased but it's not yet been fully redeemed brother how can that be because the final stage of that Redemption will take place in your body unto the praise of his glory so we have the Holy Ghost as a pledge that my body change is sure so whether I go by the way of the Grave or if I'm alive my Holy Ghost witnesses to me that I will raise up the Redemption of the purchased possession so the acquisition that he will take it all friends if we could be able to look beyond the curtain of time tonight and see those saints of God what they are doing oh oh my that they wouldn't be one of us that even want to leave this place we wouldn't want to go home we wouldn't want to go to work tomorrow we wouldn't want to do nothing else we would be so caught up when God allowed that Prophet to go beyond the curtain of time and come back he said he would never be the same again oh it drawn something so to him that changed him and you realize the the reason is letting us enjoy this it's to the praise of his glory praise be to God notice 1 Corinthians chapter 6:20 for ye are bought with Sur price now are we sure we believe this absolutely so Church money bought this Peach mang low calorie body armor light it was purchased brother Dan sister onette one of them bought a whole bunch of them got it back here in my refrigerator so they paid whatever the price was for all those things to keep me hydrated but if I wish to I can pour it out on top his carpet sister nette wouldn't like it very much but I all when you purchase something it is yours right so if I want to take it and throw it up against the wall and just bust it everywhere and splatter all over the wall if I want to take it outside and pour it down a drain it's mine oh but I find it so hard to understand then the Christians that belong to him and he tells them I don't want you doing this I don't want you doing that well who are you to tell me what to do you're asking the wrong person the wrong question you should be asking yourself who am I to tell the purchaser what he can and cannot do with me I don't belong to myself but I wonder how many of us here tonight really believe that that we do not belong to oursel we are purchased by the kid we don't have a choice well I I I I think that I I would like to you know I'd like to go out here in the word and I'd like to do a little bit of this that and other no no that's not the way it is we are bought he paid for us he paid the price now this again is what separates the bride from the church in that the church does not follow in this same line of redemption Redemption means to buy back the church world is not bought back they are John 3:16 they are given a chance to be saved and saved they will be but the Redemption the Redemption is only for those who were part of his thinking before the world ever began therefore he could buy back the elect and buy them in that personal possession stage and they actually have no problem with it they don't get mad and say huh I can't believe you you f around and bought me what you going to do you going to treat me like I'm a piece of garbage or something like that you going to tell me I can't do this and I can't go there and I can't do this I can't do something else you want me to pray about everything I do you want me to pray about what church I go to you want me to pray about what job I should take you want me to pray about the woman I should marry you better pray about that brother glory to God not only brother but you sister better pray about it too that's right because some God gives us these things in life but he wants us to seek his wisdom and his understanding why he placed us here to serve his purpose and he bought us right now I know I'm weird okay y'all can nod your head that you agree with me some of you think I am you see I cannot go to church where I want to that's right that's right I have to go to church where God puts me that's right amen thank you Lord but I find that so weird the way that people look at it cuz people look at it I'm going to church where I want to go well either that speaks one of two things to me either you're not purchased or he's mean to me right people say well I don't like a big church I don't either right so I guess I don't have to come anymore right my preference would be a much smaller Church my preference would be I was not on the internet not on YouTube Instagram none of that stuff just do away every bit of it that's my preference my preference would be that Hardy nobody around the world would ever know me that way they wouldn't shoot at me so often and I Pastor a little small Church remember I came from a small Church in Kentucky my preference is not a big church so people don't come here because they don't like a big church so that works for me too right no come on be honest you you will not let me have the same choices you think you can make because you're unjust Hallelujah Jesus didn't want to die but he did Jesus didn't want to go to hell but he did Jesus didn't want to have to become our sin but he did and I'm so glad he did aren't you so what was it he was the very attribute of God self sacrifice he was the attribute of God sacrificing himself and then when we are purchased it's not like well I want to I want I want I want I want no way you see that's the lot type not the Abraham type there will be not one individual in the bride that does not live a self-denying self-sacrificing life arrogance selfishness promotion of self will never make the bride call amen why it would match the husband can I go a little further 1 Corinthians 6:20 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods so Christians are bought and the price has been paid by right of purchase he can designate them to be whatever he wants them to be that's right so if he wants somebody to be a preacher he don't even have to ask him hey I was thinking about making your preacher what do you think I can tell you what I told him I can tell you whatever God called man told him there's some that wants to preach and he never called them in the first place but I ain't never met a god call man that wanted to do it Prophet said it's them that don't want to do it they're the one running from it that's the god call man so he called me to preach and didn't even ask me if I wanted to and that in h the story he ain't even asked me after 40 years well almost 50 50 now he ain't even asked me after that hey how you like it you want to reconsider what about another vocation there'd be some other Fell's name on that sign out there if he asked me that you know why cuz he knows what we do so he said I'm not even asking you you're a preaching I said what wait a minute that ain't fair I don't want to be a preacher I don't like I don't like preaching I don't like reading I hated homework when I was in school hated it I didn't like reading yeah y'all think that's funny don't you I didn't like reading I hardly ever brought homework home I would miss break at school and stay in and do my homework cuz I did not like homework isn't that amazing and now I have homework every day of my life but it ain't mass and all that sort of thing it's studying God's word did not like to read for nothing oh no I didn't like to read I'd just go ahead and read it wasn't that I struggle with it I just didn't like doing it I taught myself how to speed read so I would be able to read man bam bam bam bam I can still do it read very very fast and catch a great accumulative amount of knowledge out of doing it but you know what God Said I day what old boy you think you're going to get out of reading you ain't you're going to be a preacher said I don't want to be no preacher you are and it didn't say now tell you what Donnie you know okay I know you don't want to preach look son I've got five ass aspects I've got five aspects of the ministry Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors okay I'm going to make you preach I'm going to compromise with you which one do you want to be and you folks think you can choose about anything you want when it comes to God boy God's been really mean to a lot of us did you get my point yes sir good we'll move on you see with that right of purchase it's not us that can say back imagine when brother John got in touch with the guy to get all this Lumber here brother Phil got in touch with the guy to be able to get all the lumber to make the handrails and all the beautiful stuff that they did back there and that Walnut Lumber would eras St to Brother John said now what are you going to do with me am I going to be a main part of the church I hear y'all Building a Church do I get to get to be up front what it just so happen that the Walnut did but it takes a [Music] beaten as a matter of fact they've been some visiting preachers they parent apparently they got watches on their arms or Rings or something and they've beat the fire out of this thing already and yet that wood had no say we purchased it we could have burned it if we so desired but instead look at what it was turned into so he purchased us and he spends years wooing us drawing us breaking down our wh not making us now he don't want to take his belt off his W say all right Donnie if you don't do it I'm bo boy boy I'm telling you but he just wants to say papa what you want me to do what you want me to be where you want me to go where you want me to live what church you want me to sit under I don't know some of you wish you wouldn't here under me I know that you done told me which is probably the best you need to be amen God knows which preacher to set you under God knows which church you need to go to I know some of you oh yeah some of y'all like to go here and there and there and you'd like to sit under a politician or you'd like to sit under a preacher that really don't never cross you you know and you don't really never know where he stands cuz you don't never really say where he stands so when he's here he preaches this and when he's there he preaches that and when he's there he preaches that and some you say that's my kind of preacher and God said no no assign him to the Reagan camp and he said oh no no Jesus please don't please don't please don't Jesus said are you back talking me are you mouthing back to me remember I bought you I could throw you into outer Darkness I could do this or that or the other oh aren't you glad he's so merciful to us how many times have we back talked him and tried to talk him out of his will forgive us Lord forgive us Lord oh my Paul said you're bought with a price be not ye the Servants of menow so you don't belong to yourself that's you don't even belong to your wife or your husband that's right or your family you belong to God first amen then your family and all of that and the order is this God's Prophet said you put God first your family second you last of course a lot of folks have taken care of that they just simply go well that was easy wasn't it man a Al wasn't that something but action you make it harder on you yes harder on your family harder on your church family so actually the easiest and best way is God your family and you don't you love him let's stand praise the Lord listen this he your himm you're born again then you're a son and daughter of God it's a regeneration a new creation then your attributes your thoughts are not like they were your life is not like it was you're a complete surrendered vessel to God complete surrendered vessel to God and he speaks and uses you you're not your own no more your bought was a price that's the price of the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ again he says you're bought and you're not your own but you're bought with the price of the precious blood of Jesus Christ and you're not your own wonder why he keeps repeating this I guess so we'll get it to throw your life away and to live the way you do you have no legal rights to take that life that Christ has bought and sell it out to the devil you have no rights of doing it so he made a way that every drunk could be set free every drug drug addict ever whatever vile wretched sinner that they are but instead they take that life that he bought he bought all of mankind now think of it friends it's not just people that profess Christianity all Lays before him and the price was paid so for those of you who look at reprobation and you feel like God is unjust he is not unjust at all he bought them all so look at Humanity as a great great great Potter's field and the Potter reaches down over here and forms an Abraham he reaches over here in the penny pile and forms a lot reaches back over here and forms an Isaac reaches back over here and forms an esel reaches over here a Jacob over here a Canaan on and on why he bought the whole thing I'll tell you one thing we ought to just be so grateful that he put his hands in our lives shaped us mold us my goodness how many needs a revelation of this tonight that you are not your own you belong to God look for so for you to sing I I can do with what I want with my life you can do it but your answer to the purchaser you understand well it's mine I can do what I want to with it no it's not actually your life belongs to God my life belongs to God but it's amazing how people look and differentiate between Ministry and lat oh yeah yeah you ain't got no choice brother Donnie no no now you can't preach no now you you can't leave here and go to some other little church now brother Donnie you'll get out of the will of God that works for me right but don't work for you so that's a Gospel According to you I guess I'm purchased you're purchased those of you that have such an ability to sing and you'll hardly ever use it you understanding you're burying the gift that God gave you you have an ability to be able to put a big smile on your face and just go around and tell people God bless you thank you for everything you do thank you for prayers thank you for this that the other just to be a blessing well I ain't nobody I God don't buy No Junk God's not a junk collector your life belongs to him take what he's given you maybe it's your personality your million dooll smile there's one of the brothers here in our church and every time I see him he's got that smile on his face I said I wish I could smile like that my smile is just drabby you know I don't have a nice smile and I said man I wish I could smile the way you did but you know what God makes each one of us and he purchases and bought us and said now go out there and bless my people yeah go up to the D drive through them poor people at the drivethru they have the offest time ever was don't they just go through there and if they give you a a hot dog with Pino cheese on top of it and jell just think them other people's going to cuss him so bad I tell you it's going to be awful you heard it just last week a man went through the drive-thru

her brothers of Sho Ohio man is not property of the church neither is man property of the state man is property of God Sons and Daughters of God we belong to him because we are thought was a price and

complaining all this that and the other huh people think they want to be a preacher they're crazy they're crazy either that or they're called oh my goodness and yet oh God I don't want to be no Lord I don't want to be and you make all your all your excuse no Lord I don't want to be he saw every time I'd say that you think these deacons want to be in a big church I can tell you I've asked several of them most of them would rather we had a church about a third or less the size that we do so really our church is made up of a lot of people who don't even want to be here I guess we could all leave I hope you're catching what I'm saying so we're not here for one another we're not here you think I built this building for me it' been a lot easier if I had never moved one shovel of dirt all we had to go through to do it I didn't build it for me if the Lord carries I'll leave this place one of these days I didn't build it for me I built it for you and the glory of God why cuz I'm his property I'm his property if every one of us can walk out them doors tonight and come back in here Sunday morning and realize well it seems a little cool in here to me well it seems a little bit warm to me didn't you think that base was a little bit loud I thought them symbols was a little bit loud didn't you I'll tell you brother Don sermon I was really disappointed today I didn't think he moved around near enough it's not about you you're not the only one here amen it's about him first of all amen amen if we would come to church like that praise the Lord let's bow our heads together shall we dear Jesus first of all I want to say to you tonight I'm so sorry I've never got out Lord and drank and run around and done many of those type of things but Lord I've I've fallen short of your glory and ways totally different from that I don't like being in the spotlight I don't like being looked at I don't like being before a crowd you know how many times I go to the bathroom before I come out of my office one trip after another after another CU I'm so nervous I can't hardly stand it I get tore to Pieces whenever I know I'm going to have to stand before a group of people I don't like that nervous feeling it puts me in such a spot when people are needing counsel and advice and they're asking me for answers serious important things Lord it makes me so nervous and I counsel sometimes for two and 3 hours at a time and when I get home I'll tell Carol my throat is so sore I can hardly swallow Lord each one of us here tonight could say well I have to do this and I have to do that but forgive us for all that complaining Lord help us to realize we don't belong to oursel my voice is not mine my strength is not mine I don't have a choice in the sense of whether I preach at a big church a little church a mediumsized church I belong to you if you want to you can move me from here and send me to a little jungle back in Africa and start with one or two heathens in in a hut cuz I'm yours and I belong to you but Lord we don't want to just be able to confess that and say okay do whatever you want but we want to do it willingly so we want to be what we are be what you made us to be with all of our Hearts my wife does not want to have to force me to tell her that I love her I don't want to have to ask her please tell me please tell me please tell me neither do you want us to have to be begged to say we love you and that we want to give everything we are to you Boaz took Ruth a moabitas and changed her life she became the great grandmother of King David she became one of the matrons of our Lord Jesus Christ took her from being a moabitas one which is not even allowed in the presence of God for 400 years law kept her out but Grace brought her in Hallelujah I wonder how many times she read that in the Torah for Thou shalt not marry a moabitas or one of Moab shall not be allowed in the congregation of the Lord for 10 Generations wonder she would feel really strange when she would read that and it seems like the word was putting her out but all she knew was Grace got a hold of her life hallelu Lord God we're so grateful that our mistakes and our failures and our shortcomings they might want to try to put us out but Grace has always got the upper hand thank you Father we love love you tonight Lord how many in you're with me and not only visible but those that are streaming in your home your hospital room wherever you are you just raise your hand there where you are as well Lord I'm yours I am your property can we say it with all of our hearts I'm Yours Lord do with me what you will Lord God I belong to you help me love Through Me Jesus Lord God I've seen you heal the sick through my hands as I lay hands on folks I've seen you stop heart attacks I've seen you do all kinds of things that's the Glorious part as we say but Lord take my lips when I have to preach things that I don't want to preach but I'm yours I'll do it Lord if you need someone to be reproached publicly because of this word I'm willing Lord oh Jesus use us mold us shape us father or just a lump of clay with a deposit of eternal life on the inside I could have been made to be a vessel oh Lord that the world might have looked at it and said oh yes we like this that or the other but I'm so grateful that you chose me oh God every man woman boy girl in this building tonight that was chosen by you they ought to be so grateful they may never be a preacher they may never stand and give great accolades of Praise but they just live their life a simple gospel life but that life lived by the word is the word expressed we worship you tonight Lord Jesus use us father use us for your work use us for your name to the praise of the glory of God granted heavenly father can we just raise our hands may he just take the clay tonight oh but Brother Don I messed up well he specializes in taking messed up vessels and putting them back on the wheel getting a little bit of water he dips his hands back down in the water and he refreshes and renews that clay and then he can reshape it and mold it again you see he won't throw you away he loves you he did not save you to lose you he didn't call your name to throw you away in spite of your mistakes in spite of my mistakes oh praise the lord we worship you tonight Jesus sing something for us Harry can we just worship him a little

softened tonight maybe you're finding the will of God that it's chafing your life it does sometimes maybe that cross that you're called to Bear is rubbing some raw places on your back and it's hurting really bad may the Lord Jesus give you comfort tonight think of what a reward you'll get that day if he has called you to bear his cross he will also allow you to share in his glory it's a strange
