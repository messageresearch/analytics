[5:54] while to go

[6:07] Jesus's face in heaven he said what you
[6:09] know
[6:10] because this ain't me but he asked me to
[6:13] do it and I was talking to brother

[8:21] and
[8:23] since we've got a new place here we've
[8:26] got we've come up
[8:28] with some rules
[8:29] that we got to go over
[8:31] and if you know rule number one we're
[8:34] going to have a good time this weekend
[8:35] who knows what rule number one is don't
[8:38] be bashful
[8:39] [Music]
[8:41] obey all rules thank you Mark
[8:45] rule number two
[8:47] this is for you brother Rob make at
[8:49] least one friend before you leave this
[8:52] weekend one new friend and if you make
[8:56] two or three be at Sunday school Sunday
[8:58] morning we'll give you a little gold
[8:59] star if you make more than more than one
[9:02] sister Raley's room rule number three
[9:06] have fun
[9:08] have fun in the Lord and have fun with
[9:11] your brothers and sisters while you're
[9:13] here the Lord has given us this place
[9:17] for a sanctuary
[9:19] from the world
[9:21] this is our safe haven for you for our
[9:24] young people so enjoy it while you're
[9:26] here
[9:27] Rule Number Four
[9:30] leave a better person than you came
[9:34] because you're probably your father your
[9:36] mother your brother and sister will
[9:37] really appreciate that okay
[9:40] [Music]
[9:41] and get something from the Lord that's
[9:44] why we're here
[9:45] okay that's the rules okay
[9:55] this is where it gets fine if you don't
[9:58] care just hold off for a minute
[10:00] I'll let you look at that for a little
[10:02] bit and study it if you've seen this and
[10:05] you know how to figure it out just just
[10:07] be quiet don't say nothing
[10:09] for a while
[10:16] so
[10:18] despite
[10:19] what you're probably thinking
[10:22] those circles are not equal there is one
[10:26] that is a fraction of a size larger than
[10:29] the other
[10:30] I need you to figure that which one it
[10:34] is
[10:35] do we have any people that's left-handed
[10:37] in here they said left-handed people can
[10:39] usually get it right
[10:41] a lot more than right-handed people
[10:45] so is everybody letting quit looking at
[10:46] me look at this see if you got it
[10:48] figured out
[10:51] everybody ready everybody's got to vote
[10:53] if I don't see you voting
[10:55] it could be in trouble for you so
[10:57] everybody's got to vote on one of them
[10:59] okay raise your hand if you think the
[11:02] blue one is a fraction bigger
[11:09] okay
[11:11] raise your hand if you think the pink
[11:13] one is a fraction bigger
[11:16] okay looks like majority's got the pink
[11:18] one
[11:20] what was your first instinct before I
[11:23] said anything about the circles
[11:25] but they're probably equal they look
[11:27] equal
[11:28] just a different color
[11:30] that is because in fact they are equal
[11:34] they are the exact same size
[11:40] identical
[11:41] but I got just by a few words I got
[11:44] everybody as soon as I said that the
[11:46] first words I said they're different
[11:48] some of you said golly bum they are I
[11:50] can see that right there you know
[11:52] but they're not and I seen this on the
[11:55] internet a professor did it in a college
[11:57] room did the same thing everybody was a
[12:00] vote this one's bigger that one's bigger
[12:02] and but he kind of went down a different
[12:04] Avenue and I sat there and I thought
[12:07] this is exactly what Satan does to us
[12:13] we our first initial is we know what's
[12:17] right we know God's word we know what is
[12:20] for us but then Satan starts talking to
[12:23] us
[12:24] and since he starts talking to us he
[12:26] starts changing our mind
[12:28] you know and uh
[12:31] that's his job to come in and make you
[12:33] disbelieve you know I've got he tries to
[12:37] make you disbelieve that you you can't
[12:39] be healed
[12:41] he tries to make you disbelieve that God
[12:44] doesn't hear you when you pray
[12:48] that your friends don't like you or you
[12:50] don't have any friends
[12:52] he tries to get you to disability that
[12:56] everyone in school thinks you're weird
[12:59] the only bad thing about that one if
[13:01] you're homeschooled that it could be a
[13:02] problem that one is
[13:05] you know
[13:06] he tell you you're not part of the Bride
[13:07] you're not saved you're not going into
[13:10] rapture
[13:11] he talks to all of us continue every day
[13:14] and uh
[13:16] if you notice he's a liar you know how
[13:20] many times did Satan tell you that
[13:23] you're not saved
[13:24] before you got baptized before you got
[13:26] saved zero it's after you you start your
[13:29] walk with Lord he starts saying you're
[13:31] not saved
[13:33] you're not going into Rapture but the
[13:35] best thing is that we know he's a liar
[13:37] so if he's telling you you're not saved
[13:39] it's a good thing that you are
[13:42] who's telling you can't go in the
[13:43] rapture
[13:45] it's a good evidence that you are going
[13:47] so always believe that
[13:49] just don't let him don't let him do what
[13:52] I did everything I said I made up the
[13:55] left-handed people you know whatever it
[13:58] wasn't true I just made it all up it's
[14:00] blowny
[14:02] and that's exactly what Satan throws at
[14:04] us and sometimes we still believe it
[14:09] that's just he uses fear tactics you
[14:11] know and I said everybody has to vote
[14:13] you know it could get bad for you he
[14:15] starts telling you things that you know
[14:17] are fearful to you and you start
[14:20] believing it
[14:21] but that's that's his ways you know but
[14:25] you see what I'm my point is with this
[14:28] it's very simple but uh
[14:31] and I want everyone from this night
[14:33] forward when you start hearing that
[14:35] voice he'll be talking to me probably
[14:36] tonight to you in the morning but when
[14:39] you hear that voice and you know God's
[14:41] word you know the promises that are for
[14:43] you you in your mind you walk through
[14:45] those doors you come in and sit exactly
[14:47] in your seat you look at those two two
[14:50] circles until Satan he's a liar because
[14:53] you know what is right for you
[14:56] that's what I want us to do with this
[15:00] but uh
[15:02] I think that's a that's about it
[15:05] let's just have a word of Prayer

[42:52] something very powerful he said if you
[42:54] want to see God you can see him
[42:58] and you know what he also said in
[43:01] another place he said if you want to see
[43:03] God he said I believe that God wants to
[43:06] show himself
[43:08] God in other words God wants to be seen
[43:11] and so I believe that if we really want
[43:15] to see God tonight I believe that we can
[43:17] see him amen we can see him in his word
[43:20] we can see him in his people amen how
[43:23] many believes that you can see him in

[43:37] won't be disappointed amen how many has
[43:40] a need tonight you just want to make it
[43:41] known by lifting your hand I believe God
[43:44] sees every hand he sees every heart
[43:45] tonight so let's just bow our hearts
[43:47] together and look to him Lord Jesus
[43:49] we just come before your throne of grace
[43:51] and we thank you for this opportunity
[43:53] that you've given us to gather together
[43:55] and Lord we look out and see these young
[43:58] people that's
[44:00] here on a Friday evening and Lord of all
[44:04] the things that they could be doing and
[44:06] Lord but they've they've chose to come
[44:09] here and
[44:10] and Lord I believe that it's because
[44:13] that there's something a desire Lord
[44:16] that you placed in them Lord we know
[44:19] there if there's a deep that's calling
[44:22] there's got to be a deep to respond Lord
[44:25] if there's something in them as that
[44:27] that's crying out for you then I believe
[44:30] Lord that Lord there's something to meet
[44:32] that tonight there's Lord there's a God
[44:35] that Lord I think about how that Lord
[44:38] when a soul begins to crowd Lord nothing
[44:42] could stop you Lord you cross the land
[44:44] and sea you Lord in the Bible Lord there
[44:48] was one Soul crying out Lord over there
[44:51] in the in the land of Galleria and Lord
[44:54] just that one crying out and Lord you
[44:57] left the multitudes and great revivals
[45:00] crossed Land and Sea to go to that one
[45:03] need
[45:04] Lord if you would do that then I believe
[45:07] you'll do it again today
[45:09] Lord so if there's somebody crying out
[45:11] for you I pray God that you just come
[45:13] tonight Lord that's what we desire more
[45:15] than anything Lord I pray that you had
[45:17] just help us to lay our our thoughts to
[45:21] the side Lord our own anything that Lord
[45:25] perhaps we would want to say or do God
[45:28] we just lay all that down now we just
[45:30] want you to speak Lord we want you to
[45:32] have your way Lord we're giving you the
[45:34] preeminence
[45:35] Lord we've studied we've tried to do our
[45:38] part and but Lord we want you to do the
[45:41] ministering tonight

[45:58] ourselves into your hands and we give
[46:00] you this service for your glory in Jesus
[46:03] name amen amen amen just honored to be
[46:07] here tonight and amen we appreciate the
[46:09] brothers brother Joe and uh and for
[46:12] giving us the invitation of course
[46:13] brother Donnie appreciate the confidence
[46:16] that they would have for us to be able
[46:19] to come and speak to you and and I tell
[46:21] you it's a great privilege to speak to
[46:23] the to the young people of this message
[46:25] and I believe that you're the cream of
[46:27] the crop and there ain't no better young
[46:31] people than uh you know you're the uh
[46:35] you're the results of of the word of God
[46:39] that's been preached and and the the the
[46:42] fruits of of the ministry and and I
[46:45] always say like this you're the greatest
[46:46] evidence
[46:48] that this message is true
[46:50] you know a lot of people think about oh
[46:52] there's all kinds of things and
[46:54] vindications and we thank God for all
[46:55] those vindications but I'm looking at
[46:58] one of the greatest vindications that
[46:59] there is right here tonight amen and so
[47:03] uh I believe that with all my heart amen
[47:06] let's just look in our Bibles tonight
[47:07] we'll turn to the Book of Revelations
[47:09] in the sixth chapter of Revelations and
[47:12] I'm also going to read out of the book
[47:14] of James
[47:17] in the fourth chapter of James
[47:19] start here in Revelations chapter 6.
[47:23] and I'd like to read from verse 12.
[47:27] and everybody's going to think man this
[47:28] is strange for a youth service so
[47:31] but uh
[47:33] just you just pray and and I believe
[47:36] that the Lord will just bring it
[47:38] together tonight but Revelation 6 and
[47:41] verse 12.
[47:42] and I beheld him when he had opened the
[47:44] Sixth Seal and lo there was a great
[47:46] earthquake and the sun became black as
[47:48] sackcloth of hair
[47:50] and the moon became his blood
[47:52] and the stars of Heaven fell into the
[47:55] Earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[47:57] untimely figs when she's shaken of A
[48:00] Mighty Wind
[48:02] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[48:04] it's rolled together in every mountain
[48:06] and Island were moved out of their
[48:08] places and the kings of the earth and
[48:11] the great men and the rich men and the
[48:12] chief captains and the Mighty Men And
[48:14] every Bond Man and every free man hid
[48:17] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[48:20] of the mountains
[48:22] and said to the mountains and the Rocks
[48:24] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[48:26] him and setteth on the throne and from
[48:29] the Wrath of the lamb for the great day
[48:32] of his wrath has come and who shall be
[48:36] able to stand
[48:38] James chapter 4
[48:41] and I'd like to read from the 13th verse
[48:52] the Bible says go to now ye that say
[48:55] today or tomorrow we shall go into such
[48:58] a city and continue their year
[49:01] and buy and sell and get gained
[49:03] whereas you know not what shall be on
[49:06] the morrow
[49:07] for what is your life
[49:09] is even a vapor
[49:11] that appear for a little time
[49:14] and then vanish it away
[49:17] for that ye ought to say
[49:19] if the Lord will we shall live and do
[49:23] this
[49:24] or that may God add His blessings as
[49:27] you're seated
[49:37] I want to um
[49:39] just speak out of those scriptures
[49:41] tonight and and if I had a title I would
[49:44] title it
[49:45] a Divine interruption
[49:48] and um
[49:50] I was several years ago I was out in
[49:54] Colorado hunting and I was there with
[49:56] brother Wayne Lawson and we were doing
[49:58] some some elk hunting and we were there
[50:01] over the weekend and on Sunday morning
[50:03] most of the time on Sunday you know we
[50:06] just kind of hang around and don't
[50:07] really do much hunting but just try to
[50:10] you know give that time to the Lord and
[50:13] you know because Sunday just being a
[50:15] special time and um and so we were we
[50:19] were there and and he just pulled up the
[50:22] service back home that there in Ohio and
[50:26] brother
[50:27] there was a brother preaching there and
[50:29] and he was he was speaking on
[50:32] interruptions and and as he was speaking
[50:36] brother Daryl you know how it is
[50:37] sometimes somebody'll just say something
[50:38] and and and and when they say it it just
[50:41] an inspiration begins to open up and and
[50:44] so I began to think about you know an
[50:48] interruption and and so that that's what
[50:51] inspired this thought and I preached it
[50:53] before but and I you know I was studying
[50:57] in different directions praying God just
[50:59] show us the way to go for these services
[51:01] and and I just couldn't get away from
[51:04] this thought and you know it may as I
[51:07] said seem a little bit odd you reading
[51:08] about the Sixth Seal and you're
[51:10] preaching a youth service you say
[51:12] brother you're going to preach the Sixth
[51:13] Seal for a youth service well you know I
[51:15] tell you what you're not just any youth
[51:18] you're a special group of of young
[51:22] people tonight and I believe that I
[51:24] could preach the Sixth Seal amen and you
[51:26] would have an understanding of it amen I
[51:29] tell you that you're blessed amen that
[51:31] you know that that word has been open in
[51:34] such a way and I and I look out here and
[51:36] I see uh different young people from
[51:38] different assemblies and you know a
[51:40] great group from this church and I know
[51:42] you're well taught and and and you the
[51:44] rest of you know you got good Pastors in
[51:46] there and you've been taught the word of
[51:48] God and so I'm not worried about about
[51:50] it tonight I'm not worried about getting
[51:52] too deep or or being too shallow amen I
[51:55] think we ought to just follow the
[51:56] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen but as
[52:00] I look at this tonight I do want to read
[52:01] a couple quotes and I'm not going to
[52:03] preach on The Sixth Seal as uh I may
[52:05] mention some things about it but but I
[52:08] want to read a quote out of The Sixth
[52:09] Seal to get started and the prophet of
[52:11] God said here he said I could say some
[52:13] something awful good right here but I
[52:15] guess I'll hold that he said and he
[52:18] begins to go back into the scripture
[52:19] here and it says that they have power
[52:22] over the waters to turn them in the
[52:24] blood and the Smite the Earth with
[52:25] plagues as often they will now he's
[52:27] describing the ministry of Moses and
[52:31] Elijah that is to come during this time
[52:34] of The Sixth Seal and how many knows
[52:36] that they're going to come to Israel
[52:37] during the tribulation these Moses and
[52:40] light and this ministry amen that
[52:42] they're going to have is is going to
[52:44] they're going to have power to over the
[52:46] waters to turn them in the blood and the
[52:47] Smite the Earth with plagues as often as
[52:49] they will what is is it what can we
[52:51] bring at these things or he said what
[52:54] could bring these things but the word
[52:55] see amen they can do to Nature any way
[52:59] they want and here it is they're they're
[53:02] the one who brings the six seal they
[53:04] uncover and open it up it's the power of
[53:07] God to interrupt nature see The Sixth
[53:10] Seal is a completely an interruption of
[53:14] nature amen do you get it now there's
[53:16] your seal what does it do it's those
[53:18] prophets on the other side of the
[53:19] Rapture with the power of God the word
[53:22] of God and they just condemn nature they
[53:25] can send earthquakes turn the moon into
[53:26] blood the sun do anything amen at their
[53:29] command amen it's an interruption of
[53:32] nature now what is an interruption an
[53:34] interruption of the definition of it is
[53:36] it's something that causes a stop or a
[53:39] stop in action amen it is to cause her
[53:42] to make a break in the continuity or the
[53:45] uniformity or a a process see or a
[53:49] condition to break take something off to
[53:51] cause it to cease in the middle of
[53:53] something that's an interruption Amen to
[53:56] cause a break or a discontinuation an
[53:59] interference through action or speech
[54:02] amen especially by interjecting a remark
[54:05] so amen how many knows what it is to be
[54:08] interrupted you you know sometimes
[54:09] you're talking to somebody and you're in
[54:11] deep conversation somebody else just
[54:13] walks up and they interrupt you now you
[54:15] know and and then you you know how
[54:17] many's ever interrupted somebody now
[54:19] some of you children is probably more
[54:22] acquainted on that side and you know you
[54:25] you've done a lot of interrupting and
[54:28] probably been corrected quite a bit for
[54:30] interrupting but you know but what is it
[54:33] you see it it causes a distraction amen
[54:37] and and it will cause a shift even in in
[54:40] focus and even it could stop something
[54:43] completely from happening you know we're
[54:45] here we are and we're having church
[54:47] tonight and and you know and we're
[54:49] writing Mill the service but I tell you
[54:52] what if the fire alarms went off that
[54:54] would be an interruption and it would
[54:56] probably bring an end to you know I
[54:58] guarantee you wouldn't be paying
[55:00] attention to what I'm saying no more
[55:01] amen because you're wondering what's
[55:03] going on it's an interruption see and
[55:06] sometimes you know most of the time amen
[55:08] we look at interruptions as being bad
[55:10] but amen but I want you to see tonight
[55:12] that every Interruption is not a bad
[55:15] thing sometimes we need an interruption
[55:18] amen amen just as I said you know if if
[55:21] if your house was on fire amen and you
[55:25] know you're you're all caught up in
[55:27] reading a book or something like that
[55:28] amen you would be happy if somebody come
[55:31] along and interrupted you amen you know
[55:34] you might you might think that's awful
[55:36] rude for them to interrupt me like that
[55:38] amen but I guarantee you you'd be
[55:40] thankful for it amen when you realize
[55:42] wow they were interrupting you is that
[55:45] right amen now as we look at this I'm
[55:48] just going to read a few quotes and uh
[55:51] uh but the prophet said he said what
[55:53] about Healing The Sick he said see
[55:55] greater is he that is in you than the
[55:58] sickness because that's an interruption
[56:00] see it's interrupting the very laws of
[56:03] God's sickness is well see he's showing
[56:07] that sickness is an inner is an
[56:10] interruption of Health
[56:12] is that right amen so we can see it by
[56:15] that the prophet said the devil that's
[56:17] interrupted the very program of your
[56:20] life so sometimes Satan will come along
[56:22] and interrupt your life with sickness
[56:26] amen see he's goes on he says see Satan
[56:29] interrupts the life now amen I can we
[56:32] can trace this all the way back to the
[56:33] Garden of Eden because amen what
[56:35] happened in the Garden of Eden was
[56:37] actually an interruption
[56:39] see because amen the fall in the garden
[56:42] was an interruption of Eternity it was
[56:46] an interruption of perfection amen how
[56:48] many knows that God had a masterpiece
[56:50] family and amen and all creation was
[56:53] perfect and amen there was no sin there
[56:55] was there was everything God and his his
[56:58] children was in perfect Fellowship amen
[57:01] but then Satan climbs down and creeps
[57:04] under the wall amen and comes in amen
[57:07] and what does he do amen Eve begins to
[57:10] listen Amen to the LIE of the enemy and
[57:12] it brought an interruption Amen to
[57:15] Perfection it brought an interruption
[57:17] that friends I just say this and I time
[57:19] it's only an interruption to Eternity
[57:22] amen amen but thank God Amen one day the
[57:26] interruption's going to end amen and
[57:28] time's gonna blend right back into
[57:30] eternity again
[57:32] hallelujah amen so as we look at this
[57:35] amen
[57:37] I'll just say this amen because brother
[57:40] Brown's saying now sickness is an
[57:41] interruption it's it's Satan amen
[57:44] bringing an interruption brother Brown
[57:46] said in your life it's an interruption
[57:48] of Health how many believes that God
[57:50] Amen desires you to be healthy
[57:53] amen listen friends I I we don't have to
[57:55] wonder about these things tonight amen
[57:57] God don't want you to be sick God Amen
[58:00] don't want you to be depressed ah God
[58:02] does not want you to be oppressed or
[58:05] burdened amen amen I'm having a spirit
[58:09] of depression upon your life amen that
[58:11] is not the desire of God Amen that's an
[58:14] interruption amen that Satan has brought
[58:16] into your life amen but I say this
[58:18] tonight if Satan can interrupt Health
[58:21] with sickness I believe that God by the
[58:24] Holy Ghost can interrupt sickness with
[58:26] health amen by the power of Divine
[58:29] Healing
[58:30] hallelujah amen do you believe that
[58:33] tonight
[58:33] amen now amen as I said most of the time
[58:38] we look at an interruption as being a
[58:40] negative thing but but but you know
[58:42] sometimes we need an interruption amen
[58:45] because I just say this we were all on
[58:47] our way to hell
[58:49] every one of us
[58:51] amen amen I I hope that you know I hope
[58:55] that most of us is on another path
[58:57] tonight but maybe there's some that's
[58:59] still on that road but I'll tell you
[59:01] this amen all of us all of you all the
[59:04] adults every one of us that was born in
[59:06] this world we all come the same way
[59:09] amen and we were all born in sin amen
[59:12] and Shake shaping in iniquity amen and
[59:16] another place the Bible said we come
[59:17] into this world speaking lies amen why
[59:20] because we were born the wrong way amen

[1:09:20] the perfect word of God and I believe it
[1:09:22] is the infallible word of God and I

[1:09:25] cover amen but there's a lot of mistakes
[1:09:27] in this Bible you want to know what they
[1:09:29] are amen Abraham lied
[1:09:31] David was a murderer
[1:09:33] was a harlot Paul was an enemy to the
[1:09:37] church a persecutor of the Believers
[1:09:40] hallelujah amen that's what they were
[1:09:43] but that's not who they are Hallelujah
[1:09:46] because they met God one day and God

[1:09:52] they are all trophies of the grace of
[1:09:55] God Amen Let me just say this even as

[1:10:02] hallelujah amen but you are lost
[1:10:07] Hallelujah and you are signified but you
[1:10:12] are justified in the name of the Lord

[1:10:31] thank God tonight amen that his grace
[1:10:33] found you hallelujah amen you were going
[1:10:36] in the wrong direction but God
[1:10:38] interrupted your path
[1:10:42] hey he changed the course
[1:10:50] I like what brother Ram said
[1:10:52] perfect Faith he said we caught me when
[1:10:54] when he caught me I was nothing
[1:10:56] I'm still nothing

[1:11:02] I was unlovable
[1:11:04] amen he loved you and he was unlovable
[1:11:06] but he changed you

[1:11:10] aiming that time in her testimony I'm
[1:11:12] not what I ought to be I'm not what I
[1:11:14] want to be amen but thank God I'm not
[1:11:17] what I used to be amen how many feel
[1:11:20] that way tonight this is amen you might
[1:11:22] not be what you want to be amen and I
[1:11:25] tell you what amen if you're satisfied
[1:11:27] where you're at you need to come to this
[1:11:29] altar because a real True Believer don't
[1:11:31] never get satisfied they don't never get
[1:11:34] enough of God it's always crack there's
[1:11:36] a cry in the heart I want more I want to
[1:11:39] refill it amen I want a closer walk I
[1:11:42] want more Revelation amen I I want a
[1:11:44] more dedicated consecrated life it's a
[1:11:47] risk I'm not what I want to be I might
[1:11:49] not even be what I ought to be but I
[1:11:51] know this for sure tonight I'm not what
[1:11:54] I used to be by the grace of almighty
[1:11:56] God I've been changed
[1:12:00] Hallelujah how many can say that tonight
[1:12:04] how many please God's done at work in
[1:12:06] your life
[1:12:07] how maybe some God started something in

[1:12:11] about my God he don't never do nothing
[1:12:13] halfway
[1:12:14] [Applause]
[1:12:15] and God ain't never started a project
[1:12:17] that he didn't finish
[1:12:19] Hallelujah he ain't never started
[1:12:22] something that he didn't complete that's
[1:12:23] why I feel like Paul tonight even I am
[1:12:26] persuaded Hallelujah that he is able to
[1:12:28] keep that which I committed unto him
[1:12:31] even in he that has begun a good work in
[1:12:34] me shall perform it to the day of Jesus
[1:12:36] Christ he is both the author and the
[1:12:39] finisher of my faith listen friends if

[1:12:51] victory one time he'll give you a
[1:12:54] victory again

[1:12:58] you're completely delivered and made
[1:13:01] whole
[1:13:08] Hallelujah
[1:13:10] plenty family has nothing
[1:13:12] I'm still nothing
[1:13:14] but I'm in his hand
[1:13:18] that's the way see
[1:13:19] amen that's the way if God he said I was
[1:13:22] an alien from him
[1:13:24] so he loved me
[1:13:26] until he stood down to get me and picked
[1:13:27] me up and that gives me confidence that
[1:13:31] hey what he that he wants to use me he's
[1:13:34] got a purpose in doing it he's seen
[1:13:36] something in me he's seen something in

[1:14:20] Hallelujah let me encourage you tonight
[1:14:23] amen you young people amen I tell you
[1:14:25] what there's a story in this Bible amen
[1:14:27] that name it was a leper amen over there
[1:14:30] in the land of Syria amen and he was a
[1:14:33] great man and a mighty man the Bible
[1:14:35] says but yet he was a leper and leprosy
[1:14:37] represents sin amen but Dad took a
[1:14:40] little captive girl that the Bible the
[1:14:42] Bible don't even call her name they took
[1:14:45] that little captive girl and they took
[1:14:46] her over there in the land of Syria and
[1:14:48] she become a maid to naaman's wife and
[1:14:51] one day she got to testify and she said
[1:14:54] I would to God Amen that my Lord was
[1:14:57] over in my country amen because there's
[1:14:59] a prophet of Yonder amen and he knows
[1:15:02] the supernatural he's acquainted with a
[1:15:04] supernatural God Amen and if I could
[1:15:07] just get him over there he'd be healed
[1:15:09] and may hold amen the prophet of God
[1:15:11] picked that up he said that little girl
[1:15:13] had a testimony amen and knows that she
[1:15:16] was surrounded amen Elizabeth she was a
[1:15:19] slave she was an alien
[1:15:21] she didn't have nobody around her to
[1:15:24] support her she didn't have no church to
[1:15:27] go to amen she didn't have no youth
[1:15:29] group to join remember all by herself
[1:15:31] she had a testimony
[1:15:33] Hallelujah in the power of that
[1:15:36] testimony amen took a mighty great man
[1:15:39] amen over to the land of Israel and got
[1:15:42] him in connection with a prophet
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:46] and Naaman was healed
[1:15:49] and her story became immortal in the
[1:15:54] scriptures
[1:15:57] I think about Mary over there in John 12
[1:16:00] I believe it was she coming anointed
[1:16:03] Jesus
[1:16:05] and
[1:16:07] and anointed him for his death
[1:16:10] and she poured that ointment on him
[1:16:12] and it was costly and it was great
[1:16:15] is that right yeah
[1:16:17] even so much that it Judas and some of
[1:16:20] the others begin to criticize
[1:16:22] say what a waste
[1:16:24] what a waste she took this money could
[1:16:27] this this could have been sold and the
[1:16:29] money could have been given to the poor
[1:16:31] and we could have used this to feed a
[1:16:33] bunch of people and but the Bible says
[1:16:35] it because listen friends the Bible said
[1:16:37] that Judas didn't say that because he
[1:16:40] cared for the poor
[1:16:41] no no no no no
[1:16:43] amen he had a critical spirit
[1:16:46] amen and he looked at what she she was
[1:16:49] doing and she said and he said that's a
[1:16:52] that's a waste
[1:16:55] but you know what the Bible says Jesus
[1:16:57] said she did what she could
[1:17:02] she did what she could listen she
[1:17:05] couldn't preach
[1:17:06] the Bible wouldn't allow it
[1:17:09] she couldn't be a missionary the Bible
[1:17:11] wouldn't allow it
[1:17:13] amen but she did what she could
[1:17:15] amen and her name become immortal in the
[1:17:18] scripture and so much that Jesus said
[1:17:21] wherever the gospel is preached
[1:17:24] her name will be mentioned
[1:17:27] I don't know why I'm here tonight but
[1:17:28] I'm just going to I I believe I'm here
[1:17:31] for a reason this ain't in my notes I
[1:17:32] believe I'm here for a reason to

[1:17:38] Pulpit but I'll tell you one thing with
[1:17:40] your long hair and long dress you're

[1:18:08] your name will be immortal
[1:18:12] Hallelujah
[1:18:19] let me try to
[1:18:22] find out where I'm at and then
[1:18:25] so
[1:18:27] you know
[1:18:29] I was just thinking about interruptions
[1:18:31] and I was thinking about how you know
[1:18:33] sometimes
[1:18:35] you know as young people and
[1:18:38] I'm going to try to be
[1:18:39] brief and
[1:18:41] as I can but
[1:18:42] you know as young people
[1:18:45] you know you make a lot of plans and
[1:18:48] sometimes
[1:18:50] you know especially about the age where
[1:18:52] you guys are at right now I mean you're
[1:18:54] in a planning time of your life
[1:18:56] you're you're
[1:18:58] you know
[1:18:59] there's so many decisions in front of
[1:19:01] you and
[1:19:02] you know you you're you're deciding on
[1:19:04] Career paths and
[1:19:06] you know what direction you're going in
[1:19:09] to further your education or you know to
[1:19:12] not or whatever more and and on your and
[1:19:15] all those things and but I I think this
[1:19:18] is
[1:19:19] everybody's gonna understand this
[1:19:21] because you know sometimes you make a
[1:19:23] lot of big plans
[1:19:25] but love
[1:19:29] can be a great interruption
[1:19:33] you know you got it all figured out
[1:19:35] and you know exactly what you're going
[1:19:38] to do and where you're going to live and
[1:19:41] you know exactly where you're going to
[1:19:43] school and you know all these things you
[1:19:44] got it all figured out and then one day
[1:19:46] you just see her
[1:19:50] and everything changes
[1:19:53] you know what you know what just
[1:19:54] happened interruption
[1:19:57] love interrupted
[1:20:00] same you can look at either way you know
[1:20:02] you see that boy or whatever it is and
[1:20:04] you know what your plans just change
[1:20:07] you see what I'm saying it just get it
[1:20:10] can be interrupted
[1:20:12] even and all the things you had figured
[1:20:14] out and all the dreams that you had and
[1:20:16] all the amen but just in a moment
[1:20:19] everything's beginning to change
[1:20:23] you know and I I thought about that and
[1:20:26] I thought you know you can look all
[1:20:28] through the through the scripture and
[1:20:30] you can see how that there was people
[1:20:31] and they were going on a certain path a
[1:20:33] certain course in a certain direction I
[1:20:35] think about the woman at the well and
[1:20:37] you know the life that she had lived and
[1:20:38] and the troubles that she had had and
[1:20:40] she had been you know uh married several
[1:20:43] times and all these things and all the
[1:20:45] disappointments and the failures and
[1:20:46] everything that she but one day she'd
[1:20:48] come to a well listen she didn't go to
[1:20:50] that well to meet Jesus but Jesus went
[1:20:52] there to meet her
[1:20:55] oh she didn't wake up that morning
[1:20:56] brother they don't think now I'm going
[1:20:58] to go down to the well and meet I'm
[1:20:59] gonna go meet my savior I'm going to go
[1:21:01] meet him a man that's going to change my
[1:21:03] life forever she had no thought of that
[1:21:04] she was just going about her day
[1:21:07] amen she was just doing the thing same
[1:21:09] thing she did yesterday and and no doubt
[1:21:11] she had her day all planned out and and
[1:21:13] she was going to go down and draw some
[1:21:15] water and then she probably had a lot of
[1:21:17] things she was going to do after that
[1:21:19] amen but Jesus amen told his disciples I
[1:21:22] got a need
[1:21:24] to go by the well so Mary I got a need
[1:21:27] hallelujah amen and when he went down to
[1:21:29] that well he began to speak to that
[1:21:31] woman and he began to reveal the very
[1:21:33] secrets of her heart
[1:21:36] hallelujah amen and he interrupted her
[1:21:39] life
[1:21:40] [Applause]
[1:21:42] Hallelujah it was a Divine interruption
[1:21:46] let me tell you amen her plans changed
[1:21:51] I don't know what she had planned that
[1:21:53] Afternoon brother Dale but her plans
[1:21:55] changed amen you say what are you
[1:21:57] talking about I tell you what I'm
[1:21:58] talking about by the time amen he got
[1:22:00] done with her she dropped her water pots
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:04] she didn't even take the water back to
[1:22:06] the house even she left what she was
[1:22:09] doing and she forgot about her plans and
[1:22:12] she went running into the City and said
[1:22:14] come see a man that told me all the
[1:22:17] things that I'd ever done is this not
[1:22:19] the Christ
[1:22:21] Hallelujah I tell you what friends I
[1:22:24] believe we need some interruption in
[1:22:25] this amen well I pray that God will
[1:22:28] interrupt our services
[1:22:31] interrupt our programs amen I say let
[1:22:35] the spirit of God Amen fall down in the
[1:22:37] church even because I tell you what we
[1:22:40] get too much in a rut and we got
[1:22:42] everything all planned out and we're
[1:22:43] gonna sing three songs he's gonna preach
[1:22:45] 45 minutes we're gonna sing three more
[1:22:47] songs and then we all go into amen
[1:22:49] cookout or our McDonald's or wherever
[1:22:52] y'all go even if I tell you what
[1:22:54] sometimes a Divine Interruption amen
[1:22:58] begins to take place in the spirit of
[1:23:00] God begins to move and the Holy Ghost
[1:23:03] drops down Hallelujah and you forgot
[1:23:06] about McDonald's and you forgot about
[1:23:08] cookout and you find yourself living in
[1:23:11] an auction
[1:23:23] amen what we need amen is an
[1:23:25] interruption
[1:23:29] let the spirit of God move
[1:23:32] [Applause]
[1:23:35] I ain't got a a lot of time but I got a
[1:23:39] lot of materials
[1:23:43] but you do you realize
[1:23:45] do you realize that God
[1:23:49] interrupted
[1:23:51] the course of this world
[1:23:55] for you
[1:23:58] listen friends
[1:24:01] way back there
[1:24:03] in the first World War
[1:24:05] brother Brown will begin to talk about
[1:24:07] it
[1:24:07] he said all the arms of the earth
[1:24:09] gathered together
[1:24:11] and he said the world
[1:24:13] was moving
[1:24:15] in a course of Destruction
[1:24:18] is that right
[1:24:19] I know this way before your time you
[1:24:21] know I started to use an example tonight
[1:24:23] about interruptions
[1:24:25] and I was gonna you know use this
[1:24:29] example sometimes you know you you you'd
[1:24:33] listen to the radio
[1:24:34] and
[1:24:36] and then there comes this big buzzing
[1:24:38] sound across the radio and then you hear
[1:24:42] a voice and it says this is the
[1:24:45] emergency broadcast system and we have
[1:24:47] interrupted this program and the more I
[1:24:50] thought about I thought I was putting on
[1:24:51] them kids ever heard
[1:24:55] but you know
[1:24:57] he you know even though this was way
[1:25:00] before your time
[1:25:02] the Bible speaks of it the first woe the
[1:25:06] first World War
[1:25:08] and and and the in the in the armies of
[1:25:10] the Earth are gathered together and the
[1:25:12] world is on a a course to destruction
[1:25:15] and man would have completely destroyed
[1:25:17] himself
[1:25:20] but God stepped in
[1:25:23] according to Revelations the seventh
[1:25:25] chapter and the first verse there he
[1:25:27] said and after these things I saw the
[1:25:29] Four Angels standing on the four corners
[1:25:30] of the Earth holding the Four Winds of
[1:25:32] the earth that the wind should not blow
[1:25:34] on the earth nor the sea nor of any tree
[1:25:36] and I saw another Angel ascending from
[1:25:38] the East having the seal the Living God
[1:25:40] and he cried with the loud voice to the
[1:25:42] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[1:25:44] the earth into the sea saying hurt not
[1:25:46] the Earth neither the sea nor the trees
[1:25:48] till till we have sealed the Servants of
[1:25:51] God in their foreheads and the number of
[1:25:53] them which I heard were still worse and
[1:25:55] they were sealed whereas 144 000 of all
[1:25:59] the trials of Israel this of course
[1:26:00] speaking of that elect group of of Jews
[1:26:04] amen that would be sealed under the
[1:26:06] ministry of Moses Elijah that I was
[1:26:08] talking about brother man would call
[1:26:10] them the 11th Hour workers
[1:26:12] and they amen would have to be in the
[1:26:15] Homeland amen when the Lord returns back
[1:26:18] to the Earth Amen to receive Christ
[1:26:20] there amen the one that they amen their
[1:26:23] Messiah that they had rejected they'll
[1:26:25] have to be back in their Homeland amen
[1:26:26] and listen amen but under that first
[1:26:28] world war listen to Israel wasn't even a
[1:26:30] nation
[1:26:31] amen they were not in in their position
[1:26:35] amen and and yet the world was moving to
[1:26:38] destruction
[1:26:39] so God stepped in and stopped it
[1:26:43] he interrupted it amen and brother Brown
[1:26:46] would talk about it was 11th month 11th
[1:26:49] day 11th hour he said why was it nobody
[1:26:51] understands he said they talked about
[1:26:53] they've they they wrote books about it
[1:26:55] amen they've asked the generals who who
[1:26:58] was the one that come forth and who done
[1:26:59] this and nobody had the answer it was
[1:27:02] mysteriously stopped at that time why
[1:27:05] it's the question why was it stopped I
[1:27:07] tell you why amen it was because there
[1:27:09] was an 11th Hour worker hallelujah amen
[1:27:13] there was some elect amen Jews amen that
[1:27:16] had to be in the Homeland Amen brother
[1:27:18] Prophet comes along and says and there's
[1:27:20] also an 11th Hour Gentile worker
[1:27:24] Hallelujah you want to know why the
[1:27:27] world was not destroyed under the first
[1:27:29] world war you are the reason you want to
[1:27:32] know why I wasn't destroyed under the
[1:27:34] second amen you are the reason you want
[1:27:37] to know why amen the atomic bombs ain't
[1:27:39] falling right now you are the reason you
[1:27:43] want to know why even that the Lord
[1:27:45] didn't come amen and finish this thing
[1:27:47] in 1963 or 1965 brother you looking at
[1:27:51] it tonight you want to know why it
[1:27:53] didn't end in 1977 even you are the
[1:27:57] reason because he wrote your name on the
[1:28:00] last book of life
[1:28:03] but for the foundation of the world
[1:28:07] and all the angels of Destruction being
[1:28:10] held back for you
[1:28:12] he's been waiting on you to get here
[1:28:15] hallelujah amen he's been waiting on you
[1:28:18] to come amen God is holding but holding
[1:28:21] it back amen there's something
[1:28:22] luciferous there's something holding
[1:28:24] back the tribulation right now you want
[1:28:26] to know what it is amen you say well
[1:28:29] brother Josh amen the cup of the
[1:28:30] amorites ain't quite fool you amen
[1:28:33] that's part of it friends but I tell you
[1:28:34] what this world is ready for tribulation
[1:28:36] amen I don't know how much bull that cup
[1:28:39] can get amen but I believe it's about to
[1:28:41] run over right now amen they're ready
[1:28:43] for it they're in the spirit of it ain't
[1:28:45] but one thing on back the Judgment of
[1:28:48] God and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:28:52] Hallelujah
[1:28:54] and I don't know but one of you might be
[1:28:57] the last one
[1:29:01] oh brother amen that's why I'm gonna
[1:29:04] preach when everything's within me
[1:29:06] that's my brother Adam's gonna preach
[1:29:08] that's my brother Dale's gonna preach
[1:29:10] that's why your pastor preaches that's
[1:29:12] why brother Joe preaches Amen in every
[1:29:14] certain way preach we preach like it's
[1:29:16] the last one because it might be
[1:29:18] Hallelujah because you might be the last
[1:29:22] one to recognize Who You Are
[1:29:27] it could be in these youth meetings that
[1:29:30] the last one gets sealed with the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost
[1:29:36] this bracket being Glory
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:40] well I believe that
[1:29:42] you think about this friends and I'm
[1:29:44] going to try to wind this up but in
[1:29:46] closing I want you to think about this
[1:29:48] you know that's because I was thinking
[1:29:50] about them Jews
[1:29:53] and the Bible talks about how they were
[1:29:55] scattered
[1:29:58] so if they were scattered to the four
[1:30:00] corners of the earth brother there they
[1:30:01] were scattered all over they was in
[1:30:02] Africa they was in Europe they was
[1:30:04] scattered all over the world
[1:30:07] but God
[1:30:09] had already gave a prophecy
[1:30:11] he prophesied through Isaiah he had
[1:30:13] prophesied through Hosea amen and many
[1:30:16] other prophets of the Old Testament had
[1:30:18] spoke amen of their that there would be
[1:30:21] a time that they would be gathered back
[1:30:23] Hosea said amen in the third day
[1:30:26] hallelujah amen he said after two days
[1:30:29] amen after two days amen he would begin
[1:30:32] to revive them and gather them brother
[1:30:34] Brown would talk about how even though
[1:30:36] he would chop her out amen by the
[1:30:38] prophets and how that you know how the
[1:30:41] Israel would be gathered back together
[1:30:42] and brother man would talk about how
[1:30:44] that you know that he would even begin
[1:30:46] to describe the pressures of the world
[1:30:49] and and men under the uh anointing of
[1:30:53] Supernatural demon powers like Hitler
[1:30:57] and and Stalin and Mussolini and all
[1:30:59] these men and they begin to uh you know
[1:31:02] they were literally killing them by the
[1:31:04] thousands amen that persecution coming
[1:31:07] and brother Brown called it the tender
[1:31:08] hand of Jehovah
[1:31:11] he said driving them back to their
[1:31:14] Homeland
[1:31:16] I thought about that brother Daryl and I
[1:31:18] thought you know what
[1:31:19] they had they had homes
[1:31:22] many of them in Germany and Belgium and
[1:31:26] England
[1:31:28] in in France
[1:31:30] all over the world
[1:31:32] they had homes they were they they were
[1:31:34] born there
[1:31:37] they they had raised their children
[1:31:39] there
[1:31:41] I mean they had businesses there
[1:31:44] they were successful there
[1:31:48] no doubt they planned to to to live
[1:31:52] there the rest of their life to leave a
[1:31:54] legacy their children would continue on
[1:31:57] take over their businesses amen raise
[1:31:59] their children amen leave it to their
[1:32:01] children and on and on and we go listen
[1:32:03] amen they didn't have no plans to to
[1:32:05] uproot and and go back to a land that
[1:32:09] they had never seen or never knew or or
[1:32:11] or or or what that we would call their
[1:32:13] Homeland listen friends amen it wasn't
[1:32:16] it wasn't a Homeland to them
[1:32:18] it was it was like a foreign country
[1:32:22] they felt like they were at home
[1:32:24] and they had their plans and their and
[1:32:27] their they had their um you know
[1:32:31] um Ambitions and and and and and all
[1:32:34] these things and and they had it all
[1:32:36] mapped out
[1:32:37] and God
[1:32:38] interrupted
[1:32:42] listen France and their plans changed
[1:32:46] and they no longer had their business
[1:32:49] and they no longer had their homes
[1:32:51] and they no longer had a future
[1:32:55] and there was nowhere to go
[1:32:57] and brother Brown said what was it it
[1:32:58] was a Tinder hand of Jehovah leading
[1:33:00] them back to their Homeland driving them
[1:33:02] back to their Homeland he would go on
[1:33:04] that same quote he said we see the
[1:33:05] churches today as communicating the
[1:33:07] people putting them out all these things
[1:33:10] even think about it in the early years
[1:33:11] of this message there was no message
[1:33:13] churches would go to you are a blessed
[1:33:15] generation
[1:33:15] [Applause]
[1:33:18] you're a blessed group of young people
[1:33:21] Amen to be able to come to a church amen
[1:33:23] and have a pastor preach this message to
[1:33:26] you and be surrounded by message
[1:33:28] believers
[1:33:31] there was a time that none of that
[1:33:33] existed
[1:33:34] and brother Master they're being pushed
[1:33:35] out and forced out he said but it's just
[1:33:37] a tender hand of Jehovah leading them to
[1:33:40] the Tree of Life
[1:33:43] hallelujah amen amen and I begin to
[1:33:46] think about that and I thought about
[1:33:47] amen and look amen there she is over in
[1:33:50] her Homeland now Israel is a nation Amen
[1:33:53] in there I believe amen and you know
[1:33:55] listen friends amen I'm not trying to
[1:33:57] preach Doctrine tonight or anything like
[1:33:58] that amen but I believe amen that 144
[1:34:01] 000 that group of elect Jews they're
[1:34:03] probably right there right now in the
[1:34:05] land of Palestine just waiting for them
[1:34:07] two prophets to come amen just waiting
[1:34:10] to receive the message amen and listen
[1:34:13] by the way the message that them two
[1:34:15] prophets is going to preach it's the
[1:34:17] same message that you hear every Sunday
[1:34:19] and every Wednesday
[1:34:22] Hallelujah and the holy ghost that
[1:34:25] they're going to get is the same holy
[1:34:27] ghost that you already got
[1:34:30] Hallelujah and by the way the 11th Hour
[1:34:33] worker got the same pay as the first
[1:34:36] hour worker and let me just tell you
[1:34:38] this that's why I can say this tonight
[1:34:40] amen you 11th are Gentile workers that
[1:34:44] are sitting in front of me tonight you
[1:34:45] are them a living dire workers you are
[1:34:47] thou to liveth our Gentile group and
[1:34:50] you've got the same holy ghost that fell
[1:34:52] on the day of Pentecost it ain't no
[1:34:54] different Holy Ghost it ain't no lesser
[1:34:56] Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost amen
[1:34:59] and if it's the same only goes it'll do
[1:35:01] the same thing
[1:35:04] Hallelujah it'll have the same results
[1:35:09] you believe that
[1:35:11] I believe they're there now
[1:35:14] amen
[1:35:15] amen but I want to tell you what
[1:35:18] amen
[1:35:19] there's another Interruption coming
[1:35:20] friends
[1:35:22] there's an interruption coming this
[1:35:23] world
[1:35:24] it's called a tribulation

[1:35:39] they got all kind of things that they
[1:35:41] plan to do and but there's coming an
[1:35:43] interruption

[1:35:47] there's coming Interruption under the
[1:35:49] ministry of two prophets nature

[1:35:53] the sun's going to refuse to shine
[1:35:55] earthquakes amen all the things you read
[1:35:57] about in this Bible

[1:36:02] before that interruption
[1:36:04] there's going to be another interruption
[1:36:07] it's called The Rapture

[1:40:03] I tell you what I'm not going to give
[1:40:05] you all my whole testimony I know the
[1:40:07] time is gone now and
[1:40:09] I preach what I had on my heart just
[1:40:12] preach
[1:40:13] and but I just wanna
[1:40:16] share this with you tonight
[1:40:18] because
[1:40:20] maybe some of you
[1:40:22] have felt the way I felt
[1:40:25] and you know what brother Daryl
[1:40:28] I I was raised in the church even
[1:40:31] raising the message
[1:40:33] and
[1:40:36] and there was just something in my heart
[1:40:39] I never doubted this message as being
[1:40:41] true like I just you know the devil
[1:40:44] didn't battle me in that way
[1:40:46] he just didn't do it because
[1:40:48] I don't know it's just something my
[1:40:49] heart was just settled you know I just I
[1:40:51] never questioned that
[1:40:52] I knew it's real you know there's
[1:40:54] something real about that
[1:40:56] I didn't understand all of it but it was
[1:40:58] just and you know what brother Aaron
[1:40:59] I've seen a lot of stuff
[1:41:01] around the message and growing up as a
[1:41:04] kid and
[1:41:05] I've seen a lot of things happen
[1:41:07] I've seen a lot of
[1:41:09] wrong things happen
[1:41:11] I've seen a lot of bad mistakes made
[1:41:14] a lot of disappointments
[1:41:16] you know I looked at a lot of people and
[1:41:18] people that I looked up to and had a lot
[1:41:21] of confidence in they just you know let
[1:41:23] me down
[1:41:25] do you know what all that
[1:41:27] somehow another by the grace of God
[1:41:30] you never it never shook me
[1:41:34] brother I knew it was right
[1:41:36] but you know how the devil fought me
[1:41:39] this is this is how the devil fought me
[1:41:43] the devil
[1:41:45] Hey listen
[1:41:47] brother Brown said this way he said when
[1:41:49] God's silent devil does a lot of talking
[1:41:53] and I will you know
[1:41:57] the devil was just telling me constantly
[1:42:00] it ain't gonna work you're a failure you
[1:42:04] you know what I convinced myself of or I
[1:42:07] let him do
[1:42:08] I let him convince me that the message
[1:42:11] is right but it ain't for me
[1:42:16] you know in the way we hear
[1:42:17] predestination the election and things
[1:42:19] like that and thank God for them truths
[1:42:21] I mean wonderful truth ain't you
[1:42:24] how many is thankful for that wonderful
[1:42:26] Revelation but you know what the devil
[1:42:29] he's slick he is a slick guy
[1:42:32] he'll take the very things that you
[1:42:35] believe and turn them around and use
[1:42:37] them against you and he started telling
[1:42:39] me he said you ain't predecimated and if
[1:42:42] you ain't predestinated ain't nothing
[1:42:43] you can do about it you cannot make
[1:42:46] yourself predestinated and I thought you
[1:42:48] know what
[1:42:49] devil you're right
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:53] and I was really battling and that pull
[1:42:55] of the world was really pulling me and I
[1:42:58] thought you know what
[1:42:59] I know it's right but I'm probably going
[1:43:02] to hell anyway so I might as well just
[1:43:04] go on out and
[1:43:06] and live live like the world and have
[1:43:08] fun and
[1:43:11] but just even though I was raised in the
[1:43:15] church to give you a little bit of
[1:43:16] background I come up in a broken home
[1:43:19] that was an alcoholic his dad was an
[1:43:21] alcoholic
[1:43:23] I seen
[1:43:25] I've seen what the world had to offer
[1:43:29] I looked at some of my family
[1:43:31] I seen broken marriages and broken homes
[1:43:35] I couldn't hold down a job never
[1:43:38] you know
[1:43:40] no future no nothing and
[1:43:43] I'll tell you what I've done one day I
[1:43:45] remember it
[1:43:47] I was standing on the porch of a church
[1:43:51] and I I was just standing there brother
[1:43:53] on there forget this I was thinking
[1:43:54] about it and I thought you know what
[1:43:57] I might not be predestinated
[1:44:01] and I might not be elected I might not
[1:44:03] even make it
[1:44:04] [Music]
[1:44:06] but this is a better way to live
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:12] and I said I want to have a family and I
[1:44:14] want to raise some children and
[1:44:16] I want to be a good daddy and I want to
[1:44:18] be a good husband and this is a better
[1:44:20] way to live I'll tell you what I'm going
[1:44:22] to do even if I ain't predestinated I'm
[1:44:24] going to stay with this and I'm just
[1:44:26] going to do the best I can and I said
[1:44:28] Lord if when it all ends if I if I just
[1:44:32] end up in hell
[1:44:33] you know I'm just going to do the best I
[1:44:35] can and I'm going to stay with this
[1:44:37] right here as soon as I made that
[1:44:39] decision
[1:44:41] and I said
[1:44:43] God begin to deal with my heart
[1:44:46] listen friends I tell you what it cost
[1:44:48] me friends it cost me
[1:44:50] I ended up
[1:44:52] leaving the church I was in there was a
[1:44:54] lot of things I won't go into all them
[1:44:56] things but
[1:44:58] listen
[1:45:00] God began to deal with my heart and he
[1:45:01] began to reveal his word to me
[1:45:04] and he began to
[1:45:06] he began to show me
[1:45:10] you do belong to me
[1:45:14] I don't know why
[1:45:15] you know I don't know why I didn't
[1:45:17] really go what I'm preaching tonight but
[1:45:19] I just felt to share that with you
[1:45:21] tonight because I really had it just it
[1:45:23] just come to me real strong
[1:45:25] and I want to encourage everyone of you
[1:45:27] because I know the devil's fighting you
[1:45:31] I know what I know some of you the
[1:45:34] devil's probably told you the exact same
[1:45:35] thing some of y'all probably convinced
[1:45:37] that the message is right but you're
[1:45:39] wondering if it's for you
[1:45:40] and you're wondering well you know it
[1:45:43] it's probably working for somebody else
[1:45:45] but I'm just not sure that's for me
[1:45:47] listen it's a better way to live
[1:45:50] and I'm telling you this you just need
[1:45:52] to make a decision and I say I'm gonna
[1:45:54] I'm gonna follow Jesus
[1:45:56] and brother Brown just come to a place
[1:45:58] he said even when we get to the end of
[1:46:00] the road if he throws me in hell
[1:46:02] amen listen we just had to admit bro
[1:46:04] Daryl we're just getting what we deserve
[1:46:07] it's like I told the church Southern
[1:46:08] artists they you know they say well all
[1:46:10] this predestination election stuff ain't
[1:46:12] fair I said you got that right and I
[1:46:15] don't want what's fair
[1:46:16] I want God's grace
[1:46:19] if we got what's fair all of us would go
[1:46:22] to hell

[1:56:34] Christian gets on his knees hail
[1:56:36] trembles
[1:56:37] so you interrupt hail
[1:56:40] you you interrupt the devil's day
[1:56:43] he had your day all planned out
[1:56:46] and you just whispered a small prayer to
[1:56:49] God and you just changed his day
[1:56:53] God will interrupt heaven for you when
[1:56:56] you have a need God will silence heaven
[1:57:00] to listen to you
[1:57:02] God will silence angels to listen to you
[1:57:06] yours creation brother Branham said and
[1:57:10] I've said it not many so many times here
[1:57:13] as brother Brandon said when that
[1:57:15] perfect God met that partnership with
[1:57:17] that imperfect man you become the
[1:57:19] Perfection of God
[1:57:21] so what God Is You Are
[1:57:24] and there's it's impossible for you not
[1:57:26] to interrupt hail
[1:57:28] and the life of God lives in here
[1:57:30] That's what Satan fears it ain't this
[1:57:32] flesh he knows he'll never interrupt
[1:57:34] that life of God in you
[1:57:36] and I I I've never heard the word
[1:57:39] Interruption preached before brother
[1:57:41] Josh but I'll never I'll never look at
[1:57:44] it the same
[1:57:46] I plan up to get in the morning to to
[1:57:48] interrupting when I get up interrupting
[1:57:50] through the day
[1:57:51] you can make Satan's life hail
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] you can
[1:57:56] you can make it rough on him
[1:57:59] it's the life of God God's been doing it
[1:58:01] since creation he's been making it hard
[1:58:03] for Satan
[1:58:06] I enjoyed that if you have a need if you
[1:58:08] have the Holy Ghost if you need the Holy
[1:58:10] Ghost
[1:58:10] he's here
[1:58:12] and God's not holding the Holy Ghost
[1:58:14] back off of you saying you need to get
[1:58:17] your life right before I give you this
[1:58:19] he's not saying you need to do this
[1:58:20] before I give you this it's a free gift
[1:58:23] you have to have that desire
[1:58:25] [Music]
[1:58:27] and he will interrupt everything from
[1:58:29] Heaven and Hell to give it to you
[1:58:32] I enjoyed that I appreciate that brother
[1:58:34] Josh just give brother Josh
