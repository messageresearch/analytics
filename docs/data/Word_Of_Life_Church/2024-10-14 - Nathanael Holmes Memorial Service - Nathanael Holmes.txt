[Music] let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord we come before you this afternoon Lord in this very sad Time Lord but father we're very aware that you're here in this building tonight Lord father we invite you the angels of God to encamp around this service tonight Lord we invite you Lord to come personally to the family Lord you see the heartbroke Father the grief but Lord we are very well reminded of what your word tells us we don't see all things we don't understand all things but we do see you and Lord I pray that you would come may your anointing rest upon this service father may your anointing rest upon every song that's sung upon every word that's spoken Lord may your angels just encamp around the hearts Lord we're reminded again of your word that says you're very near a broken heart and a contrite spirit Lord we commit this service tonight into your hands move among us and have your way Lord Comfort the hearts and lives of The Grieving family friends dear loved ones of our departed brother in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen want to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to the family and friends of our dear departed brother brother Nathaniel I count this a very honor and a privilege to be asked by the family to stand here today and take a few moments and speak something concerning his life and just to share sh a few things I thought a lot of brother Nathaniel thought the world of him his family spent many Sunday afternoons together with them and the children and sister Sue and The Wades and their homes and uh many trips uh I looking at the pictures here many trips with the family together down to Pigeon Forge and I just want to take a moment here and thinking of this time I'm reminded tonight of a prophet's prayer when he would say these words he would say Comfort the uncomfortable and make known thyself in our midst and may you do something tonight for us Lord a special thing I trust the Lord tonight to come among us even in this moment and do something special for the hearts of the family that's grieving I would like to just share uh a few moments of the last time that I had the privilege to be with brother Nathaniel and sister Sue we met just a few short months back and spent uh probably two or three hours together at a a coffee shop and just was talking and uh sharing some time together and I will always remember the last few things I heard him say and the last time I was privileged to see was just assuring me of his beliefs in this great message that God has sent us and all that God has done in this generation and tonight I believe we can take comfort in those words and knowing that in his soul those things were settled in St John chap 14 and verse 16 Jesus said I will pray the father and he shall give give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever in St John chap 14 and: 18 Jesus speaking again he said I will not leave you comfortless but I will come to you how thankful we are tonight in times like these that we are not left helpless and hopeless but we are left with a comforter who knows all things I think of how in first Thessalonians chapter 4 and: 18 as many of you here know that the prophet of God would use that in this text for the Rapture and he would speak many things there that would comfort the hearts of Believers but at the end of that verse Paul would say these words wherefore Comfort one another with these words I think of the words of our prophet and just a quote that come to my heart the other day I would like to share when I heard of the news of the passing of our brother and the message the testimony of a true witness brother Brandon would tell us now the one reason that I am a calvinistic thinker of the security of the believer is because that I believe that when a man or a woman is in their right mind that is the time to accept the Lord Jesus and get it all settled then once and forever because when we come to the end of the road we don't just know where and how we're going to be sick he said we may be sick in our mind there might be a fever that would really cook our very brain and we might say anything or do anything we don't know but you see if we have already already Anchored In Christ no matter what sickness takes us or what condition we are in it's already settled we are sealed until the day of our Redemption Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day not of your death but the day of your Redemption see after death is done over you are still sealed this evening I would like to share this with you from my heart our enemy the devil can touch our flesh he can trouble us in our spirit but I am so thankful tonight to know that he can never touch our soul once it is sealed by the Holy Ghost I believe our brother was a testimony of a seal of God upon his soul no matter what the devil would do to the flesh or the spirit I believe the soul was sealed and someday we will meet our brother again on the other side I believe that's more than just words I believe those words of a Vindicated Prophet were the words of comfort to this generation I believe God had this not in mind that no matter what has happened or what has transpired we have words to comfort one another we will see our brother again we take comfort in that we say to the family may God bless you all may God wrap his arms around you may God visit you may God show himself to you and may God ultimately give you the peace that no man or anything else can give you the peace that passees all understanding God bless you for [Music] Great Is Thy Faithfulness oh God my father there is no Shad of turning with the thou changes not thy cassions they fail not as thou has been thou forever will be great is thy faithful Great Is Thy Faithfulness morning by morning new mercies I see all I have needed thy hands have provided Great Is Thy Faithfulness Lord on to [Music] me paron for sin and a peace that endureth thine own dear presence to cheer to God strength for today and bright Hope For Tomorrow blessings on M with 10,000 beside Great Is Thy Faithfulness Great Is Thy Faithfulness morning by morning new mercies I see all I have Meed God hands have provided Great Is Thy Faithfulness Lord unto me it is [Music] well with my my soul It is Well it Is Well with My Soul it is well it is well with my [Music] soul certainly wish to extend our condolences to family and friends of our departed brother all of those who you that have come to express your condolences as well we thank you for that in such a time as this we can truly find comfort from God's presence but all also his word as I was reading this evening from The Book of Job and uh reminisced the verses that job had said when he went through such hardship and difficulty and the Bible says that job cursed his day and he said cursed be the day that a man child was conceived why did not I die in my mother's womb why was it said cursed be the time why did not I go why did not he was so low he couldn't understand where he was at he couldn't understand what he was going through the only thing I need to do is just look at his conception his origination the night that I was conceived and the day that I was born and why would this ever happen a situation like this that we are looking at tonight it brings me to a place to where I desire to be more sensitive I guess I could say to the needs and the things that are people going through around us sometimes we never know we never know what people are thinking and what they're battling you know when the Lord God made man in the beginning and he made him a dimensional being so he had a soul he had a spirit and he had a body each one of those are contacted by different Avenues his soul by free will his Spirit imagination conscience reason and affection as outside man see taste feel smell and here there's things we could say about the soul we couldn't say about the spirit and the body and we know and we are taught that a person could be insane in their mind and yet be filled with the Holy Ghost that would stumble some people because they don't thoroughly understand the separation between that part and some might in their hearts and in their minds wonder you know a Christian How could a Christian go and not leave this world in a blaze of glory How could a Christian not just go to sleep and wake up on that Resurrection morning oh but you see there's many of God's children that it went by way that we wouldn't think was very glorious at all can you imagine the head of a prophet called John the Baptist being served up to a dancing girl a dancing girl and God let that prophet's head be cut off like a chicken in a barnyard I think of Jonah whenever he had obeyed the command of God and whenever he done what God told him to do one of the largest meetings a man's ever had 120,000 people got converted instead of Jonah being happy about it he was all tore up and sad he just couldn't understand what in the world's going on here I told these people this thing was going to happen to them and now they've all repented this ain't the way I thought it was going to be so he goes out and he trying to find a little bit of shade and God let a Vine grow out on a tree and a worm come out and ate it oh Jonah he was he was in a fix you think um how that as Christians we in our right mind in serving the lord Jesus yet living in a world that we're under an onslaught constantly day in and day out and Jonah looked and said would to God just would to God I could die I don't even want to live no more you imagine a man just had one of the greatest meetings that'll be known upon the human race of people becoming converted and he don't even want to live so what is it that gets a halt of human beings sometimes to where they just don't want to live anymore you see for those of you that's never been there it might be quite easy for you to sit and criticize and say well I'll tell you one thing I wouldn't do this or that well possibly just maybe you've never been there yourself so if you've never W walked there then you would know how Elijah felt under the juniper tree when he'd have a nervous breakdown God had sent him to do a great work and he did it and after he had done it then the anointing leaves him and he falls into that state he doesn't know what to do I'm reminded of our Prophet messenger of this age had it not been for the mercy of God he would have taken his own life several times over so when we think of here we are as Mortals pleas you're in contact with each other that we might be able to help each other along the way sometimes we do a pretty good job I guess sometimes not so much because as humans we clash with one another but may God help each of us as we continue our life and our brother's life has now come to its close we will stand before the Lord one day and all of us will as an individual but may circumstances like this make us more aware of those that are around us and maybe we don't even have a clue what they're going through and in their mind they're toying with these thoughts they don't want to live they don't want to survive they just don't want to do it anymore and they become overwhelmed a friend of mine by the name of Doug McHugh many years ago he was a pastor in Tucson and he shared this story with me and I I'll close he was pastoring in San Jose sou California and when a prophet was here he he had come under the influence of his meetings and things and there was a man in brother Doug's church that took his life so brother Doug's background was a Pentecostal like mine and many others maybe here and if they did that there was no repentance you were lost that's all there was to it so brother Doug didn't know what to do so he calls up and he talks to the prophet and asks him what do I do how do I preach this what what do I say now he told me this story himself and he said remember brother duck a person who does that they are not thems and they're not in their right mind I wonder how many of us Christians here tonight have said today is my last day serving God I ain't doing it no more I ain't going back to church I ain't going to do this that and other aren't you grateful for the grace of God that helps us under such times yet some people go so far and it's like they can't get back sister Sue and her children need us like never before to pray with them to stand with them to do everything that we can to be able to help them during this great loss a death to someone that you love it's very very painful this Wednesday night will be a year that my daughter Erica was taken from us I'm Mr still crying I'm still weeping I still feel the pain of that loss so when you go home tonight or tomorrow whenever you do please don't forget them drop them a line a text a WhatsApp a phone call something just to let them know that you love them and you're praying for him during these Hard Times may the Lord bless youall time measured out my days life carried me along in my soul I ear to follow God but do I never be so strong I looked hard at this world to learn how Heaven could be just to end where I began where human effort is all in vain but were it not for Grace I can tell you where i' be wanding down some pointless Road to Nowhere with a my salvation up to me I know how that would go the battles I would [Music] face forever running but losing the race but were it not for [Applause] Grace so here is all my praise expressed with all my heart offered to the friend who took my place and ran the court I could not start and when he saw in full just how much his love would cost he still went the fin mile between me in heaven so I would not be lost were it not for Grace I can tell you where I be wanding down some poess Road to Nowhere with my salvation oh to me I know how that would go the battles I would face forever running but losing the race were it not for Grace [Music] forever running but losing the race were it not for Grace [Music] you know when you know somebody you want to talk about them they've been coming to the church for the past three years I'm guessing faithful who is this man it was a man of Faith a man of character a man of love he bore a cross that many of you may never carry he had a job that many of you will never understand some of our brothers and sisters that or in our congregation they they know about nursing and doctoring some of you do too and uh it's hard to hold back the tears at times because of how it happens and I see the joy in a man's face and the life that he lives under the pressure he continued serving God and while he was doing that service he was being attacked and the Bible talks about there's many of the righteous were always attacked many of the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord he said I'll deliver you out of them all and I looked at brother Nathaniel the situation all that's been dealt to him and how that he's battled through all that he's been going through and when we got the call last Saturday a week ago I knew there was something we needed to do and it wasn't that I needed to say anything I just needed to be there so immediately my wife and I when I told her she be to she begin to weep you see my wife suffered in that same direction one time she wanted to leave this world she couldn't understand love she couldn't understand how to take care of three little children she would look me in the eye and say I don't love you I knew that wasn't the woman I married yes sir but the God I serve with the Seal of the Holy Ghost he took care of her He restored her back to me sister Sue he's going to be restored back to you maybe not in this life but we believe that God is in control of all things and when God is in control of all things we have nothing to fear when the pressure gets on you when my wife would tell me she wanted to to leave this world and take her life it put me into a different kind of thought pattern it took me from a realm of just hallelujah praise the Lord to Lord I'm desperate I need you this family needs needed God and he they still need God even today as I was looking and thinking about the pressures that we go through and I didn't realize why the Lord would let us go through such an awful time that he did back in 1988 when my wife was at the point of death the doctors told me within two to three days she'll die and I with all my heart brother Jackie Benton was preaching for my dad that weekend when the doctor said she had maybe two or three days to live she's inting the hospital and I go to my father and brother Jackie is there and I say I don't know what to do and they told me gave me the right advice but little did we know it would shov into a deep depression what the doctors did you see doctors sometimes they they do things that doesn't always help we can't always understand but every step of the way of a Believer is led by God the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord you say but I don't understand why did this happen you'll have to understand it better by and by God is in control of brother Nathaniel's life and his Destiny I want to read from Ephesians chapter 1 because I believe in this scripture and as I was you said but what a scripture is this for a funeral now we're we're talking about a man who's no longer in this flesh but as we were taught by the prophet of God he's just sleeping but he knows where we are he can see us right here now we can say a lot of nice things but he lived his testimony he knew where he stood with God and God knew where he stood with him Ephesians chapter 1 verse one it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you in peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ he's the only only one that can give you the grace and the strength to carry the load that you're going to carry Emma Whitney Levi I'm not your father brother Donnie is not your father but we as men of God we understand that we need to help carry you brother Emanuel will do all he can to help you Sister Carol your grandmother will help you I want you to just take a look around at all the support you'll support her right you'll love them right brother Donnie and sister Carol we prayed and prayed for Erica we trust the Lord we know where she is and for us who believe this word it said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ worldly pleasures they're good for a little season but when you're in Christ the power and the glory that's revealed in you is what's giving you the power to continue in believing this and verse four he says and according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love this man is not to blame we had a prophet messenger who would preach a message the greatest battle ever fought and he talked about the Mind battle and how that the enemy would challenge us in our mind and I'm going to tell you something friends you know it's real how many of us have had bad thoughts about somebody or we wanted to take care of something oursel and then we have to turn and say Lord forgive me I didn't want to think that way I don't want to say those kind of things and God in his grace and mercy says I understand your pressure because in these mortal bodies we suffer so many things and we challenge many things but yet God understanding God and he brought the power of His Spirit into us and because he brought the power of His Spirit into us he said we could be the Overcomers we're not survivors of this age we're the Overcomers of this age and God by his authority has put his spirit in us to give us the authority over the devil and over his spirits you said but where were you at when he needed you I didn't really understand that he had depression because when he would come to church he would out of the church he'd go man and most everybody knows him knows that when his church is over when you say the amen he's done I'm out of here how many knows he does that he would just leave after the church he's not mad at nobody that's just how he was some of you know that he was a cut up some of you know he'll pull a he'll pull a gag on you if he gets a chance he was a happy guy he'd do certain things some of the fam they're not in head yeah I know who was this man he was a man who could understand people when they were hurting when they were sick he worked in the ER and he worked his different parts in the the nursing and I have several people two weeks ago I think it was September 29th they were in the service for the last time with brother Nathaniel and I was preaching and I was was preaching I started talking about some of the young people and and some of the things they need to be doing and I got him to laugh sitting in the back row he was looking and and I just happened to look his way and he was really he was with me and he could see what was taking place and so here he is he's a man and and many of you have testified brother Aaron you testified that he was there when you needed him my son was telling me what a wonderful time he had with him not long ago had lunch with him and I've heard so many different stories of how and a sister I had no idea of this Saturday night we had a hay ride for our children and a sister came to me and when she recognized brother Nathaniel she said you know brother Mike it was brother Nathaniel who helped my cousin to get to the hospital when he couldn't get there he was the one that helped him get to the hospital and so brother Nathaniel has helped hundreds and hundreds of people that we will never know about and you'll never know what he did for those people he gave his life in a different kind of a way and so as brother na Nathaniel went through all these different things and helping people like he did the Devil comes along and starts planting thoughts in your mind why this and why that but remind the devil that this man was a Son of God and that Son of God stood for the word of God that he knew for his hour you see I just give you a little quick history here and I hope sister Carol don't mind and we were we we've been you know Sister short used to come to y's church and when you were in the old building and we would come and visit in the early ' 90s 9091 when you were there and and sister short I show up Sister short would come looking for me because my dad was their pastor at one time yours too and so but when my dad was a young man he had a major stroke and he could only move one finger and sister Carol was telling me that she was a little girl out in the front yard when her daddy and another Minister was in the in the house praying for my dad and they asked all the people who didn't believe that he would get up to go out of the house and my mama told me that there was only five people left in the house and brother short was one of them another brother butd whed was there and the sisters I guess was there and just in a few minutes completely healed he raised up off the bed walked out the door and they had lunch for everybody that was there and now it comes down the road and and I'm pastoring sister Sue I'm thinking my dad was their Pastor years ago and then the real thing was it comes along my my grandmother on my mother's side brother brother short I didn't even know this was her pastor she's sitting in brother Schwarz and then we go to the to the funeral of my grandmother in the house where they're having the church and we had a Hallelujah meeting there they were praising the Lord and then I found found out later that in my grandma's house she knew the message she had the message books I didn't even know that and I'm thinking praise the Lord Grandma knows the message too and then I see these people come along when we left Richlands Virginia we didn't know nothing about no message we didn't know nothing about a prophet but God in his divine intervention has brought these people together brought it in a full circle and this man I got to Pastor him for the past three years and see the faithfulness of a man who would stand for the word of God where he was in his in his job brothers and sisters we need to thank God for each and every one of us we're brothers and sisters in Christ we need to understand that when somebody's sick and as brother Donnie said a few minutes ago you may not understand you may not been through that trial you may not think that way so until you've walked in that person's shoes you shouldn't condemn them and because they made a mistake don't dechristianize them because we suffer in many different ways how many times you have a service and the blessings of the Lord comes down and you go out and you think oh God what am I going to do how am I going to fight the next battle but God looked at us let me just continue in verse 5 he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself you see he was chosen by God himself no Pastor chos him no person chose but Jesus Christ in the fullness of his word verse 6 he said to the praise and the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved and verse 7 says in whom we have Redemption through his blood as brother Andrew reminded us that that Redemption God has redeemed us into this word of God the redemption's there and we're waiting on the change to come and he said and here he is is he said in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins how mean he's ever made a mistake I'm still making mistakes but thank God for Grace he looked beyond my fault saw my need and pull me out of the mar clay and said come on man you can do this it's by his grace verse eight says and wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself you have been chosen for his good pleasure not yours that's right you've come here to glorify him not yourself you come here to worship God not your pastor not your husband or your wife but you come here to glorify God because he said it was a mystery and you know what many people can understand why we follow a message why we follow a prophet why we follow the word of God why we believe in Jesus Christ Jesus Christ says it's a mystery that you worship me if you just worship him because it's a good idea it's not going to help you but when Revelation strikes the word in your soul and it changes your thinking and it changes your expression and it changes your desire you know that something's going to happen and so he comes along and he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will and I looked up that word mystery to see what it said it's a hidden thing you know mystery is a hidden thing he said it's religious secrets so the devil doesn't understand it religious people doesn't understand it he said it's religious Secrets confided only to the initiated and not or ordinary Mortals so we're not just ordinary Mortals we are living under the power of the supernatural because if Jesus Christ lives and dwells in who you are then you have the power of the Holy Ghost living inside of you that's the supernatural power of God I can't say much more about this man because he's did his own testimony he's preached his own life he's told us what he's going to do and he serve God to the best of his knowledge but God said in this mystery it's to the initiated so when God initiates you to be a real believer the devil cannot take your soul from God because he says when you're sealed you're sealed until the day and God's power is walking and living and breathing in human flesh today listen we were created in the image of God Genesis chapter 1 and he comes down he says and we were created in the image of God what was the image of God it was a spirit the first part was a spirit realm it was an image you that don't know Jesus Christ this will be the last time you see brother Nathaniel but those of you who are born again by the same power and The Same Spirit when he rises again in the resurrection we shall see him for we shall be like him will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye but you that don't know this Jesus Christ you that's not been initiated by the word of God you'll never understand why we worship God why we praise God you say but you're crazy with your religion that's all right we know why we're this crazy because the world don't know where we are they can't see this because they're not initiated to see it but if God initiated you then you ought to serve him with all your heart brother Nathaniel did the best he could and God accepted his best when you've done the best that you can God accepts that's good enough he don't expect you to live like who the pastor is or a deacon or somebody but he wants you to live to the ability that you see the ability that you've received and that's what he's going to that's what he's going to measure You by if you try to live to the standard of a Preacher he's notable to tell you the wrong thing to do but when you live to the standard of the Holy Ghost then he will let you know exactly how he's going to take care of you so it doesn't matter how low you feel or how high you feel or what you feel God's not looking at your feelings he's looking at the purchase price of the blood of Jesus Christ and here is the purchase price and one day we're going to see that man Rise Again those of us who are waiting for this Rapture we're going to be standing there and saying praise God thank you brother Nathaniel because when the dead Saints arise sister Sue when he comes walking through the door you'll know it's time to go home we're just getting ready to crossover friends we are getting do you not see the world and the turmoil that it's in and what the devil's doing and how much Rule and reigning he's got into the politics listen friends we know by a prophet's message we are getting ready to cross over are you ready this man was ready I say let's stand together in the power and the authority of the word and let God be God and lead us and guide us that was his promise it ain't just your pastor preaching it ain't just somebody else but when he says I'll lead you and I'll guide you that's his promise and if he gives you the promise then he's a ble to keep every promise so today if you don't know this initiated power of the Holy Ghost I ask you don't condemn me if you don't know why I live it why don't you go look at the mirror because you're your biggest problem right every one of us that's our biggest problem look in the mirror I am my biggest problem I give myself the hardest time I know the issues I know who I am and I look at the grace of God and say thank you Lord that you chose to love me you chose to raise me up and let me see you and because he did that I didn't want to be a preacher I didn't want to be a pastor but if I'm going to be it I want to have compassion I want to show you love I want to show you that the god I I serve as real and if you'll just let him come in and just come in that meekness of his Spirit he'll change this Mortal body he said that he will Quicken this flesh he'll Quicken this Mortal body and he'll change you to serve him tonight we worship the Lord God we praise him for all that he's done for us sister Sue how's he going to do it by his grace how did how did brother Nathaniel get here in Ephesians chapter 1 he said he knew us before the foundation of the world so it wasn't because of his mom and daddy that he's here it was because of the Lord God saw him in his mind before the
