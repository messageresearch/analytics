[30:00] charity is I preached this in Kentucky a
[30:04] few weeks back and this is kind of part
[30:06] two to that so they'll have to sit
[30:11] through the first part of it I'll try to
[30:13] condense it a little bit but y'all pray
[30:17] that he comes to Hales mirror I'm gonna
[30:18] stumble through it the golden China
[30:24] dishes are in North Carolina tonight so
[30:26] y'all gotta eat it on paper plates and
[30:28] plastic tub
[30:30] but the menus the same I hope so
[30:38] God said let us make man in our image
[30:41] after our likeness and let them have
[30:43] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[30:45] the fowl of the air over the cattle over
[30:47] all the earth and over every creeping
[30:48] thing that creepeth upon the earth so
[30:50] God created man in his own image and the
[30:52] image of God created he male and female
[30:55] created he VM
[30:56] God blessed them and God said unto them
[30:58] be fruitful multiply replenish the earth
[31:00] and subdue it have dominion over the
[31:02] fish of the sea over the fowl of the air
[31:04] and over every living thing that moveth
[31:06] upon the earth God said behold I have
[31:08] given you every herb bearing seed with
[31:10] some on the face there's every tree in
[31:12] which the fruit of the tree yielding
[31:14] seed to you it shall be meat and every
[31:17] beast of the earth and every fowl of the
[31:19] air and to every thing that creepeth
[31:21] upon the earth wherein there is life I
[31:23] have given you every green herb for meat
[31:25] and it was so and John one starting to
[31:30] verse three
[31:40] that which we have seen and heard
[31:42] declaring to you that you also may have
[31:45] fellowship with us and truly our
[31:47] Fellowship is with the father and with
[31:50] his son Jesus Christ and these things
[31:52] write we unto you that your joy may be
[31:54] full
[31:55] we got out of the blessings to his word
[31:57] you can be seated in reading that
[32:00] scriptures you might wonder how these
[32:04] two scriptures go together and really
[32:07] there's no tie that I know that I can
[32:09] think of it Hobie's two scriptures
[32:11] together but they stood out to me is
[32:12] what I'm going to speak on tonight the
[32:15] title what of title of giving is what
[32:16] God wants what does God want we reading
[32:23] in John 1 that God wanted fellowship
[32:27] God's desire was fellowship but yet he
[32:31] looks it we look in Genesis and bringing
[32:35] up to that fellowship God created all
[32:37] this everything that there was that God
[32:39] created and he give it to Adam and Eve
[32:42] this was his love for them this is the
[32:44] setting that he made for them that he
[32:46] could come and fellowship with him with
[32:49] them and so we look at you know what
[32:50] what does God want in our own feeble
[32:54] mind we think you know God wants us to
[32:56] live right he wants us to dress right
[32:58] now the sisters you know be modest wear
[33:01] the right modest clothes that don't cut
[33:04] your hair you know no smoking drinking
[33:07] we think you know that's what God wants
[33:09] and that's nowhere even near what God
[33:13] wants that's not what God desired of
[33:16] Adam and Eve and at first if we could we
[33:19] could go back the way that brother
[33:21] Branham did and nice he said God dwelt
[33:24] alone you know and when I was studying
[33:27] this I got to thinking you know God
[33:29] dwelling alone does God ever feel alone
[33:32] when he's with me
[33:35] does God it might never go back to when
[33:37] he he once fellowship to me and I'm not
[33:40] giving him that fellowship does God ever
[33:42] feel lonely
[33:43] does God ever desire that what he wants
[33:46] for me and I'm not giving it to
[33:47] you know so we look at gone brother
[33:50] brain said God dwelt alone stop and
[33:54] think that that for a minute the
[33:56] greatest beam that ever was through
[33:59] eternity that ever will be but he was
[34:01] lonely and yet he had a desire God have
[34:06] had been headed his desire this is a God
[34:08] that could have anything he wanted but
[34:11] has everything that owns everything but
[34:14] there's something he did not have
[34:16] there's something he didn't have and
[34:18] brother Brent said love makes you do
[34:20] things and when the church gets the real
[34:21] love of God in their heart they'll do
[34:22] things they'll not be ashamed Christ
[34:24] don't want you to be to be them so much
[34:27] to be loyal he don't want your Partridge
[34:28] you want your fellowship that's what God
[34:31] wants is to have fellowship with you so
[34:34] we look at God he dwelt alone with it
[34:36] and he wanted fellowship but he starts
[34:38] to create things he creates the chair
[34:41] rooms the angels you know any he looks
[34:44] at his thoughts he starts having
[34:47] thoughts and I know I've touched on this
[34:49] here before when God had his first
[34:53] thought of you his very first thought of
[34:56] you brother Jim when he thought of me
[34:57] the very first minute his heart began to
[35:00] beat that's for the second when he had
[35:03] that thought of you his heart began to
[35:05] beat out of his chest he never lost that
[35:07] the heart the very faint when he had
[35:11] that thought of you the very first
[35:12] desire God had was I wanna have
[35:14] fellowship with Gene so everything that
[35:17] God purposed when he said let there be
[35:19] light his purpose behind that was
[35:22] fellowship and with Gene his purpose was
[35:25] to fellowship with brother Greg with
[35:26] brother Roberts that was his thought and
[35:29] everybody needs to get that in their
[35:31] mind that when God thought of you he
[35:34] didn't have a better thought of anybody
[35:36] else than you
[35:38] you were his main thought you were his
[35:40] main purpose you are what drove God to
[35:43] create I've got a few quotes here and
[35:49] I've got a lot of quotes according to
[35:51] brother Bradley brother Bradley said
[35:53] they took him forever to put them all in
[35:54] there but I don't have that many I do
[35:57] have some but Bram said in the Easter
[36:02] seal now there's a great statement I
[36:04] want my ministry brothers to try to
[36:05] understand this in the beginning God the
[36:07] Great Spirit he wasn't even God then he
[36:09] was the eternal one
[36:10] he wasn't even God God was an object of
[36:12] worship so if there's nothing to worship
[36:14] you how can it be God he couldn't even
[36:16] call himself God he can't say I'm God
[36:19] because there was no one there to
[36:20] worship me and then when he began to
[36:23] create and he created cherubims and
[36:25] angels they couldn't have fellowship
[36:27] they didn't understand we've got to
[36:30] understand what God wanted to fellowship
[36:31] to us every attribute that he was he
[36:36] couldn't he couldn't fellowship with
[36:38] angels and say hey let me tell you about
[36:40] how a huge let me tell you how it
[36:43] redeems you how I pulled you out of sin
[36:46] angels could never understand that this
[36:49] was parts of God that he was desiring to
[36:52] push out to reveal that's why there was
[36:56] the fall in the garden was never a
[36:57] mistake that was not a mistake Satan
[37:01] didn't take God by surprise in the
[37:04] Seavey's not knew who was gonna happen
[37:06] all alone Eve had to fall so he can have
[37:09] fellowship with me Eve had to be
[37:12] deceived so he can fellowship with each
[37:14] of us so he can reveal himself as a
[37:16] redeemer that was God's purpose so what
[37:21] do we think what God wants God wants
[37:23] fellowship so here he began to create
[37:24] and his thought of you when he has his
[37:27] thought of you he says let there be
[37:29] light that's one step closer to
[37:30] fellowship to you then he says let there
[37:33] be
[37:34] let there be the earth the waters the
[37:36] trees each time he speaks each time he
[37:40] speaks a thought brother branham said
[37:41] when he said let there be that was God
[37:42] expressing a thought
[37:45] God Express the thought so he says let
[37:48] there be and in his mind he goes that's
[37:50] one step closer to by the West that's
[37:52] one step it might be millions and
[37:54] billions of years by the West before he
[37:55] would get to you but you were still
[37:57] thought Brooke Maps had had fellowship
[38:00] with you and his thoughts before the
[38:03] foundation of the world he had
[38:05] fellowship so this was his desire have
[38:09] you ever wonder I don't know how this
[38:13] came to me I could say was a father God
[38:15] he every you want to look how God still
[38:17] projects his thoughts he's still
[38:18] projecting his thoughts today every
[38:20] single day well you have a minister get
[38:22] up here to speak to you
[38:23] he had taken thought that God gave him
[38:25] then he gets up here and it's God
[38:28] projecting the thought it's not a
[38:31] thought of a man but still God
[38:34] projecting his thoughts you know never
[38:35] end
[38:36] they'll never become no more thoughts
[38:40] will never have not another thought God
[38:43] will say wow that was my last thought
[38:46] that it will all go home what Graham
[38:48] said eternity will never fully Express
[38:51] everything that God is God will take you
[38:55] turn to you to express his thoughts to
[38:57] each other it'll take you turn to
[38:59] express his thoughts just to one of you
[39:01] how he feels about you can you imagine
[39:04] God sitting for eternity eternity
[39:07] eternity would end before God would be
[39:09] finished tell you how he feels about you
[39:12] eternity would be over before God could
[39:15] fully express his feelings towards you
[39:19] in studying that just overwhelming that
[39:22] you know above all that God wanted all
[39:25] he had everything he had he didn't have
[39:28] to let he didn't have to let Adam Adam
[39:29] and Eve fall he didn't have to let the
[39:31] live even to be deceived here was at him
[39:34] in God's own image why couldn't God be
[39:37] happy with that
[39:38] having everybody like that right there
[39:40] he speak him and here they are
[39:42] they're standing here in the garden
[39:43] their their name in it there's millions
[39:46] and billions of people in the garden
[39:47] that were spoke why couldn't God be
[39:49] happy with that God could never
[39:54] ever expressed to Adam himself as a
[39:57] healer he could never Express to Adam
[40:01] himself as a redeemer till after Calvary
[40:03] it had to happen I don't mean to be
[40:07] stuck in this one spot y'all forgive me
[40:14] he wasn't even God then he was the
[40:17] eternal one here's an object of worship
[40:18] he had nothing to worship him there were
[40:20] no angels no nothing just God alone him
[40:23] alone in eternal is eternal but in order
[40:25] to be God there had to be something to
[40:27] worship him so he created angels and
[40:29] beings in cherubims and so forth to
[40:31] worship Him his plan began to unfold so
[40:33] God had a plan he had a plan he had a
[40:36] purpose but Bramson the greatest
[40:38] fellowship man could ever have is he
[40:40] fell ship with Jesus Christ it's that
[40:43] simple it's that's we complicate things
[40:46] so much I'm trying to I've got to do
[40:49] this I've got to do this I've got to do
[40:51] this if you read the definition of
[40:53] fellowship if you go into the Strong's
[40:55] and look at the definition of a
[40:57] fellowship there's so many words in it
[41:01] for I'll just put it this way mix
[41:05] company its intimate relations you
[41:11] haven't felt with Jesus Christ
[41:12] there's going to be a birth there's
[41:15] going to be a birth it's going to birth
[41:18] healing it's going to birth deliveries
[41:20] it's gonna it's gonna birth redemption
[41:22] salvation this is this is the fellowship
[41:26] that God requires but then we complicate
[41:29] it
[41:30] we feel like we we've got to we get so
[41:33] in our mind how worship is and we I'm
[41:36] getting jumping way ahead of myself but
[41:38] I can't help
[41:40] you get into it we we look at God
[41:42] sometimes in we worship God sometimes in
[41:45] this form of idol worship I don't
[41:50] worship I hope they don't some of you
[41:52] feel and I'll tell you where I'm going
[41:53] with this
[41:54] with God all we do is we approach God we
[41:58] we bow down God I need this I need this
[42:01] I need this our prayer life becomes a
[42:04] ritual God thank you for the day
[42:06] thank you for my food lord help me as I
[42:08] sleep and that becomes our life that's
[42:10] idol worship
[42:11] that's not fellowship to worship God is
[42:14] to fellowship with God it's a daily walk
[42:18] fellowship with God is a daily walk and
[42:21] when we turn our daily walk into worship
[42:24] of graven image I hope that's almost
[42:29] humble you but and I don't mean to say
[42:31] it in calling God an idol but that's
[42:33] that's the way we approach this so many
[42:36] times it becomes a ritual it becomes a
[42:38] tradition and then God is just something
[42:42] that's a part of our day and not our
[42:44] whole day God needs to be your day
[42:49] no I don't least need to be a part of
[42:51] your day he needs to be your day
[42:55] everything needs to come second
[42:57] hey I'm preaching to myself I'm feeling
[43:00] awful bad up here right now because I
[43:04] find myself focusing on the things I've
[43:07] got to do of the day and I forget I
[43:09] forget I thought Lord I had this name
[43:12] back here I meant to talk to you about
[43:13] and I'll let it go but this is God's
[43:17] desire his fellowship and we look at it
[43:21] so many ways
[43:22] look God you know when you took your
[43:25] first breath of life I'm not even off my
[43:27] first page here I apologize when you
[43:29] took your first breath of life and God
[43:31] placed that part of him down in you do
[43:35] you realize that part of God that's
[43:36] inside of you requires worship that's
[43:40] God that's God and then you know only
[43:45] God Himself knows how to worship that
[43:48] you can't worship fact it takes God to
[43:52] worship that you've been driving down
[43:56] the road you in your office and you feel
[44:00] something warm come over you can't
[44:04] explain it and you don't want it to go
[44:07] away we don't understand how God
[44:12] worships us we don't understand how many
[44:17] can tell me how God worships you how
[44:21] does God worship you
[44:22] oh well not out of order I want to do
[44:26] something here this is God worshiping
[44:29] that God it's not going to come up to
[44:30] brother ways to kneel down and say I'm
[44:32] worshipping that part of me that's in
[44:34] brother West God's not going to do that
[44:36] here's God worse than you
[44:40] how's your day today buddy Geoffrey good
[44:43] day yes you know I love you don't you
[44:46] you remember you remember way back many
[44:49] years ago you used to go through all
[44:51] them terrors at night all the things
[44:54] used to deal with and you had all of his
[44:56] hatred beat it just kind of built up in
[44:59] you you remember all that yes sir you
[45:00] know I never left I was there the whole
[45:03] time
[45:04] there was one time there was one time
[45:07] Wes it Michael wanted to come down there
[45:11] and run them off and I went Letty I went
[45:14] Letty I said he's got a part of me in
[45:17] here me he don't need you down there
[45:18] right now you wait to see what he's
[45:21] gonna be in the future this is why
[45:24] here's gonna Mull this is God worshiping
[45:25] brother Wes you know there's I heard
[45:30] somebody say the other day that you
[45:31] rhond them Peter you look like him and
[45:34] everything Peter's excited to meet you
[45:39] so from what I've heard he's already
[45:42] waiting by the gate but this is God
[45:46] worship this is on what God's worship to
[45:48] us that's God's fellowship
[45:57] thank you brother we're sore but that's
[46:00] the way God worships us that's God's
[46:04] desire of us and he had this thought of
[46:08] you all right we can sit here go through
[46:11] this all night and our human thoughts
[46:13] cannot contain contain all this we can't
[46:18] contain it but this fellowship brings
[46:21] harmony we wonder so many times we got
[46:25] things in our lives when we get desires
[46:26] in our life that we have needs in our
[46:28] life and we wonder you know what God why
[46:31] is this happening why is not this
[46:33] happening why am I going through these
[46:35] things that I'm going through and you
[46:37] wonder I've checked myself with this so
[46:41] many times most of the time it's because
[46:42] I'm not fellowship and like I'm supposed
[46:44] to thank God saying I'm allowing this
[46:47] I'm allowing this your son and daughters
[46:50] of God the first time God ever had a
[46:51] thought of you and and he does that in
[46:54] his thoughts you were elected that never
[46:57] changed it's an eternal thought when it
[47:00] leaves God it comes back to God it'll
[47:03] never change your eternal destination
[47:05] will never change ever it's impossible
[47:08] for your eternal destination to change
[47:10] if you were a thought of God God's
[47:13] thoughts will always come back to him
[47:15] always so you even though you go through
[47:21] life and you think you know what it's
[47:23] been three days and I meant to listen to
[47:27] this message
[47:28] I meant to read my Bible and God's
[47:32] checking you could put something in your
[47:34] life he'll put a problem not because he
[47:37] hates you
[47:38] it's because he loves you and he's doing
[47:41] that to turn you the other way he wants
[47:44] to turn you aside to fellowship talk to
[47:47] him about the problem
[47:48] God wants to hear about your problems
[47:50] but let's not get to a point that's all
[47:52] we tell God what God was telling by the
[47:55] West but God by the West God was to hear
[47:58] that back God I had a wonderful day
[48:01] today thank you for that I had the
[48:04] situation of work and you fix it just
[48:06] like that
[48:07] know what I want to thank you for that
[48:10] that's fellowship - god that's that's
[48:14] his children worshiping look at your own
[48:18] children which my kids are spoiled they
[48:21] can say but they are I my wife would say
[48:25] something the other day about I get feel
[48:28] bad about getting on Michael and then I
[48:30] go buying something he's the baby of the
[48:35] families but that's that's you know when
[48:40] you project yourself to your children
[48:43] there's nothing never going to change
[48:45] but through your children there's
[48:47] nothing I never change how you love them
[48:49] and that's the same way God protects
[48:51] himself but it's infinite times more
[48:53] than that in studying inside got to
[48:59] looking at different quotes your brother
[49:03] branham said about fellowship and I'm
[49:10] gonna jump around both Daniels so you'll
[49:13] you can get me afterwards in God and
[49:19] fellowship through reconciliation of the
[49:21] blood and 55 he's talking about Adam and
[49:26] Eve in beginning and God made man in his
[49:30] own image he put him in the Garden of
[49:31] Eden he had perfect fellowship perfect
[49:36] God didn't want it any other way
[49:39] it was perfect what was he saying Adam
[49:43] you did everything perfect
[49:45] you done it just like I would have done
[49:48] it you did everything perfect so God
[49:51] said he had perfect fellowship it was
[49:54] late in the afternoon the evening when
[49:56] the twilights were falling I could see
[49:58] the great Jehovah come across the top of
[49:59] the palm trees the roaring of the
[50:01] Thunder when Adam and Eve gathered their
[50:03] gathered there in the open the great
[50:06] open-air cathedral worship God had
[50:08] fellowship talked with him it was like
[50:12] this for who knows how long
[50:17] Bible doesn't say hell could have been
[50:19] billions of years but Adam had
[50:22] fellowship then Adam fail but the
[50:35] Branham said question answers law having
[50:38] a shadow there you are then the great
[50:42] picture of the fellowship was broken God
[50:44] can't talk to his people no more he done
[50:46] said so when God speaks he's got to keep
[50:48] his word I told Adam on that day you eat
[50:51] thereof that day you die he's got to
[50:54] keep his word he's got to but he said
[50:57] I've got to talk to him he said I can't
[51:02] I got to cut him off but something
[51:06] inside said I've got to get to him I've
[51:08] got to talk to him God does the same
[51:10] thing to you
[51:11] to me when we fall God don't say I told
[51:15] you not to do that we can never
[51:20] understand the love of God when we fall
[51:22] when we make mistakes Adam was just the
[51:26] type look what Adam did we'll new we'll
[51:31] never do anything we'll never do
[51:33] anything to talk what Adam did as far as
[51:36] fallen he destroyed the entire human
[51:39] race have you done that have you made
[51:43] that big of a mistake and God redeemed
[51:46] him back God said I'll bring him back
[51:50] if you've done something worse than that
[51:53] oh you're on your own
[52:05] my brains said yeah I've got to talk to
[52:08] him so God went over and got some sheeps
[52:10] Kim brought them old bloody sheep skins
[52:13] back throw them back in the bushes as I
[52:16] said put them all here come at him and
[52:18] he's wrapped up in them old sheep skins
[52:20] the Bramham said when you come God came
[52:23] running through the garden calling for
[52:24] Adam if you're centered autre of God
[52:28] when you fall when you make mistakes God
[52:33] desires fellowship with you so much
[52:36] you're come looking for you you didn't
[52:40] come into this message on your own you
[52:42] didn't decide one time to join this
[52:44] message if you're here tonight it's
[52:46] because God called you
[52:48] you didn't tell him one day Lord I think
[52:51] I'm gonna serve you today man does not
[52:53] have that in him man cannot put that in
[52:56] you it has to come of God and in what we
[53:00] was talking with brother Wes that part
[53:03] that's inside you is God so you can't
[53:06] say well I call out to God know if you
[53:09] made a call that's strong enough for God
[53:11] to answer it's God calling it
[53:13] you can't call God it's God go back and
[53:16] listen to deep call till the deep bed
[53:18] will clear everything up for you but
[53:23] Graham said they made themselves to
[53:24] religion they joined the church
[53:26] somewhere I thought they was going to
[53:27] get by with a fig leaf Church sorry
[53:32] Daniel I'm jumping on you you know just
[53:34] hide behind something hide behind
[53:38] something that's the human thing to do
[53:42] we make mistakes blame it on something
[53:45] else I will promise you you will feel so
[53:51] much better if you claim the blame your
[53:57] trials went in so much quicker instead
[54:01] of you trying to figure out who done it
[54:05] we're talking about fellowship tonight
[54:09] we're only human we're going to make
[54:12] mistakes we're going to fall we're going
[54:13] to stumble but don't blame God
[54:18] don't blame something else say Lord
[54:22] forgive me I've done wrong go to your
[54:25] brother go to your sister who would
[54:26] whoever you wronged and make it right
[54:29] don't behind behind something but when
[54:32] they went out to stand in the presence
[54:34] of God their fig leaf religion didn't
[54:35] hold up here he comes out with blood
[54:38] running over his manly shoulders look at
[54:40] Eve let's draw a picture that pretty
[54:42] little thing Adam's sweetheart and wife
[54:44] his darling and here she comes out and
[54:47] blood running down her legs here's Adam
[54:48] and the blood running off his shoulders
[54:50] I see you around his collar here where
[54:53] it's wrapped around his shoulders the
[54:54] blood shagging in his hair look at
[54:57] little Eve her head bent down the MOE
[54:59] bloody skins walk out before God they
[55:02] were no longer in fellowship only way
[55:06] God could speak to him something had to
[55:09] die it's a perfect type of Christ I was
[55:12] listening to fellowship through
[55:14] reconciliation in the blood today
[55:15] brother Branham was talking talking he
[55:17] talking about
[55:18] I had him you know the he said here he
[55:20] come walking out of the garden God drove
[55:22] them out of the guard here he comes with
[55:23] these bloody skins hanging on him and
[55:25] that that blood slapping him then bloody
[55:29] skins slapping his leg but Ram said I
[55:31] think of Jesus Christ he said here he
[55:33] goes this man with his white robe on
[55:36] dragging this cross he said you can see
[55:39] little bitty dots of red on the back of
[55:41] that red robe he said in the further he
[55:44] went the bigger them little spots got he
[55:48] said by the time he reached the bottom
[55:49] of the hill of Calvary it was one big
[55:52] spot and then I begin to run he said in
[55:56] that robe got bloody and that robe begin
[55:57] to spat and slapped Jesus on the legs
[56:01] God's covering for your sin
[56:03] God's covering to bring you back into
[56:06] fellowship perfect top he said brother
[56:10] branham said here here these this bloody
[56:12] robe was smacking the second Adam as
[56:15] he's carrying the cross no longer in
[56:21] fellowship but God says I'll bring you
[56:24] back
[56:28] in Parden in 63
[56:31] well Bram says until the church gets to
[56:33] a place and away from its rituals and
[56:34] back to God's original plan there that
[56:39] men are born into the kingdom of God not
[56:41] joined in church that is the time that
[56:44] fellowship will reign everywhere the
[56:46] Spirit of the Lord will cover the earth
[56:47] like the waters cover the sea when it
[56:48] comes to a place that men forget their
[56:51] differences and come together in
[56:52] fellowship under the blood we can all
[56:54] come under the baptism of the tree the
[56:57] Baptist tradition the Presbyterian
[56:59] traditional methods tradition on the
[57:00] Pentecostal tradition but we can all
[57:02] meet and fellowship under the blood of
[57:04] Jesus Christ because that's God's
[57:06] original plan so we looked at God's plan
[57:13] I've gotten my notes here and God's plan
[57:15] and I've already preached about it so
[57:20] before you can have a desire of godly
[57:23] fellowship it has to be a God here to
[57:28] desire that and there has to be a god to
[57:32] respect that desire to fellowship with
[57:36] you know in and that's morning when God
[57:39] drops that in us when God drops that
[57:42] down in our hearts you wonder what that
[57:47] feeling is when you want to you miss
[57:49] church you have to go somewhere you get
[57:52] sick and you can't be here then you feel
[57:54] that feeling you hate not happy to be
[57:55] here that's not humanly that's not you
[58:01] will you miss these brothers and sisters
[58:03] that are not here when we miss brother
[58:05] Terry not being here because the God in
[58:07] me desires to fellowship with the God in
[58:09] him you know and you a lot of times will
[58:13] you hear people say well I just can't
[58:15] fellowship with with him and he just
[58:17] this she's your sister what do you bring
[58:18] into the fellowship what do you bring in
[58:23] is it because you can't fellowship them
[58:25] because you're approaching them humanely
[58:28] something about them if you got the same
[58:31] God if you got no don't get me wrong on
[58:36] this everybody's different God likes a
[58:39] variety and some people don't click but
[58:44] there's some people that shun some
[58:45] people because they can't feel like they
[58:48] can fellowship with him they believe
[58:49] something a little different than they
[58:50] do let me tell you something I've got a
[58:54] friend and y'all pray for him he had his
[59:00] name's Roger Ambrose he's Rogers
[59:04] probably in his 60s probably him about
[59:07] six in his 60s 70 a better Christian
[59:14] than Roger Ambrose that lives what he
[59:22] believes he's Baptist
[59:25] he's Baptist I love being around every
[59:31] time I'm around Roger Ambrose he gets me
[59:34] wanting to go to heaven quickly well the
[59:39] Roger his wife died about two years ago
[59:43] you start talking about the Lord within
[59:45] two minutes he's in tears well we like
[59:50] that I can fellowship with that I can
[59:55] fellowship with Roger because we have we
[59:59] have something kindred we love
[1:00:02] fellowship with the father if we ever
[1:00:06] get to the place that we can't
[1:00:07] fellowship with somebody because they
[1:00:08] don't see this message the way we see it
[1:00:11] the way they see it because you believe
[1:00:13] something different it's a belong altar
[1:00:17] it's long and I promise you they'll
[1:00:22] leave the doors unlocked long as you're
[1:00:24] down here you never get to to the point
[1:00:29] that we're too good to worship for
[1:00:31] somebody that don't believe the way we
[1:00:33] believe out of however many people that
[1:00:36] go this church I promise you there's
[1:00:38] people that see doctrine different
[1:00:40] that's human nature but we get to the
[1:00:46] point that we can't fellowship one with
[1:00:47] the other and then we come into church
[1:00:51] sometimes we can't fellowship with God
[1:00:53] in church that's human I mean that
[1:00:56] happens you got things on your mind
[1:00:59] you got bills you your mom's in the
[1:01:01] hospital you dad's in hospital or you're
[1:01:04] sitting here Warner of Tennessee one or
[1:01:06] not
[1:01:07] I've done it I've done it we've all done
[1:01:13] it if he likes fourths but I mean that
[1:01:16] that's a fact that's the fact we can't
[1:01:20] get into fellowship I found Michael
[1:01:24] Bailey in the bathroom one time checking
[1:01:26] his phone I really didn't but I hated
[1:01:33] getting back for something he told me
[1:01:34] today but seriously that's we need to
[1:01:46] come in you know with with our hearts
[1:01:48] with a purpose in our hearts to
[1:01:49] fellowship with God lately you have
[1:01:51] everything back there that we can leave
[1:01:53] it outside the doors you know that's
[1:01:56] God's desire would you want to walk in
[1:02:00] here would you want to walk in here not
[1:02:02] having the same desires God and you sit
[1:02:05] here you waiting for the the only way
[1:02:07] you can pull on this minister is if you
[1:02:09] have the same desire that God does
[1:02:11] that's the only way you can pull on him
[1:02:14] God's desires to fellowship by giving
[1:02:17] you one of his thoughts God's projecting
[1:02:20] his thoughts to you and you can't pull
[1:02:22] because your thoughts are somewhere else
[1:02:25] so if every single person in here we
[1:02:28] come in here every single time myself
[1:02:30] included we're human we get distracted
[1:02:32] that's that's human nature we make we're
[1:02:34] going to make mistakes in this whole
[1:02:35] body till we leave but if if we could
[1:02:39] purpose every single time I mean we've
[1:02:41] come here three times a week and for
[1:02:44] three times a week we can say tonight
[1:02:46] I'm walking through them doors leaving
[1:02:47] everything outside my purpose is to
[1:02:49] fellowship with God my purpose is to
[1:02:52] pull a net minister I have needs than
[1:02:54] things that I left outside the door
[1:02:56] those are my needs so when I go back out
[1:02:59] what I receive tonight I can apply those
[1:03:02] to their needs but if you bring those
[1:03:05] needs in here with you and let them
[1:03:06] ponder over your mind worried and in
[1:03:09] doubt and what am I going to do Lord
[1:03:11] bills are due and I'll leave that
[1:03:13] outside
[1:03:15] leave that outside you can't bring that
[1:03:18] into the presence of God leave it
[1:03:22] outside in fellowship it's an intimate
[1:03:26] relationship where you fellowship God
[1:03:27] you will birth a need you will you will
[1:03:30] birth something that will take care of
[1:03:32] your needs there's a birth that comes
[1:03:35] with fellowship it's an intimate
[1:03:37] communication that's what God desires
[1:03:45] let's look at Joe by talk about Jobe and
[1:03:48] every sermon I preached just about
[1:03:49] because Jobe is me
[1:03:52] Jobe is me and I love Joe is I be not
[1:04:03] afraid brother Ram said in 59 and Jobe
[1:04:07] came by the way of blood the shedding of
[1:04:08] blood that's the only grounds that God
[1:04:10] ever fellowship with a man his own basis
[1:04:12] of the shed blood there's no other way
[1:04:14] that God will fellowship with people
[1:04:15] only through shed blood that's how
[1:04:19] Calvary bought the fellowship to you
[1:04:21] without Calvary there's no fellowship
[1:04:23] with God
[1:04:24] there's without Calvary there's no way
[1:04:26] that God put that part of him inside you
[1:04:27] but when you took that first breath
[1:04:29] because God will not put himself on a
[1:04:32] sin body unless it's through the blood
[1:04:36] in the Old Testament Israel to come to a
[1:04:39] place of worship that was under the shed
[1:04:41] blood and when trouble struck Joe he
[1:04:43] would scream out I know my Redeemer
[1:04:44] liveth in the last days he'll stand on
[1:04:46] the earth though after the skin worms
[1:04:48] destroy this body yet in my flesh shall
[1:04:50] see God and he was screaming though he
[1:04:52] slay me yet I'll trusting he know what
[1:04:55] path to turn when he got in trouble he
[1:04:58] did for a little while
[1:05:04] Joe got on the ash heap his thoughts got
[1:05:08] a little different
[1:05:10] and I've got a quote Ryan got it with me
[1:05:13] where operator here before where le you
[1:05:17] came to job and said you've accused God
[1:05:19] wrong so job falls out of fellowship all
[1:05:23] these trials job thanks he's fell out of
[1:05:26] fellowship all these trials are heaped
[1:05:29] upon him he's lost everything
[1:05:31] he's lost his kids you think God don't
[1:05:34] love him no more
[1:05:35] so when job's mine I'm no longer having
[1:05:38] fellowship with God I can't fellowship
[1:05:41] with God anymore God don't like me he's
[1:05:42] gonna take taking everything of God
[1:05:43] there's no more fellowship every one of
[1:05:46] us can put herself in there we've went
[1:05:48] through them times where we feel like
[1:05:49] God's not speaking to us we can't hear
[1:05:51] and we sit there on our ass heaping we
[1:05:53] cry God don't love me no more
[1:05:56] God don't ain't spoke to me in a we've
[1:05:58] have you spoke to him
[1:06:02] sometimes God waits for you speak to him
[1:06:04] and most of time it it's not because you
[1:06:07] want something if you look at fellowship
[1:06:11] fellowship has nothing to do with
[1:06:13] requests we request God for this we
[1:06:17] request God for that and that's great
[1:06:18] Calvary was there so we can bring our
[1:06:21] needs our request to him but what if
[1:06:24] that's extensive our fellowship what if
[1:06:26] that's how we're bringing to God and so
[1:06:30] jobs on this ash heap it looked like his
[1:06:37] fellowship was over well God God's his
[1:06:40] fellowship was gone there we always sit
[1:06:45] on our ass cheap sometimes international
[1:06:48] bein we got financial problems cancer
[1:06:51] sickness these are our assets
[1:06:54] everybody's got an ass heap and we sit
[1:06:56] on this ash heap like Joe
[1:06:59] the problem with job is jokes have
[1:07:01] lowered him the flower dies and this
[1:07:05] message reconciliation of the blood
[1:07:07] brother Bram said the flower dies the
[1:07:09] petals fall off the grass goes leaves
[1:07:13] and it comes back but when I die I'm not
[1:07:16] coming back so he's accusing God that he
[1:07:19] can't redeem me he's saying God you
[1:07:20] can't redeem me Ellie who said you
[1:07:23] use God wrong but Branham called le who
[1:07:28] the little prophet he said he came to
[1:07:30] Java said you've accuse got wrong you
[1:07:33] heard him the last three four weeks
[1:07:35] you've you've heard God responds to Jo
[1:07:38] what have you done what have you done
[1:07:42] I've done all this but you've done
[1:07:46] nothing new you are sitting on your ass
[1:07:48] heap complaining that I can't bring you
[1:07:50] back brother Branham says him he said I
[1:07:59] do have it here I'm sorry he begin to
[1:08:02] straighten Joe bops head look Joe I'm
[1:08:03] not accusing you of being a secret
[1:08:04] Center but you've accused God wrong and
[1:08:07] now joke said ìlook I've noticed the
[1:08:10] trees they die they live again flower
[1:08:11] seed drops in the ground it lives again
[1:08:13] but man laughs down yeh he gives up his
[1:08:15] ghost his sons come to mourn and
[1:08:16] perceive it not
[1:08:17] he don't raise up no more he lays there
[1:08:19] oh that thou can hide me in the grave
[1:08:21] and distressed honest man getting a
[1:08:24] little bit of child training we still
[1:08:28] require some of that child training I'm
[1:08:34] gonna have to hurry I'm gonna get behind
[1:08:35] if this was June as long as I preach
[1:08:39] this was June y'all be getting out with
[1:08:40] sunup what if God required us to have
[1:08:53] fellowship the way they did in the Old
[1:08:55] Testament Lord of God required you to
[1:08:59] have fellowship once a year you could
[1:09:03] enter into the holiest of Holies in
[1:09:05] Shekinah glory of God through a certain
[1:09:08] certain way the only one way you could
[1:09:10] do it you had to find a red heifer you
[1:09:13] had to kill her outside the camp good to
[1:09:16] burn er you had to bring the blood here
[1:09:20] to mix the ashes with the water for the
[1:09:22] water of separation and the priest had
[1:09:24] to put seven stripes of blood over the
[1:09:26] door I've told the by the richest church
[1:09:33] town of Kentucky we couldn't we didn't
[1:09:36] have enough herds there wouldn't be no
[1:09:37] cows
[1:09:37] left in the country me one month I mean
[1:09:44] how many if you wanted to enter into the
[1:09:45] worship in the Shekinah glory with God
[1:09:47] every day there'd be a lot of dead cows
[1:09:51] it'd be a lot of dead heifers so what if
[1:09:54] God requires that of you and here it is
[1:09:58] once a year this was what they had to do
[1:10:00] be able to fellowship with God one time
[1:10:04] one time Tanner and brother Branham said
[1:10:07] he knew they would go in there and it
[1:10:08] would get all smoky in the holiest of
[1:10:10] Holies and they were enter into the
[1:10:11] Shekinah glory said then people would
[1:10:13] stand up say what's wrong with him
[1:10:14] people in there that's what they should
[1:10:17] be saying about your life what's wrong
[1:10:19] with them you should be in the Shekinah
[1:10:22] glory and fellowship on gana people
[1:10:24] looking at your life and saying what is
[1:10:25] wrong with that person the fellowship
[1:10:29] they've been and into the glory of God
[1:10:31] their fellowship and with God it's just
[1:10:36] you and him can you lose your fellowship
[1:10:44] can you lose it a lot of times in our
[1:10:52] life we get to feeling feeling like you
[1:10:56] know I haven't felt the Lord in a while
[1:10:58] I've done something or you might balk
[1:11:01] max lie you fall out of fellowship with
[1:11:05] God in here you you backslide and you
[1:11:07] don't have that anymore when you have
[1:11:10] things of your life your troubles and
[1:11:12] trials your life you have no way to turn
[1:11:13] because you've left God you haven't been
[1:11:14] to church in six months you're doing
[1:11:16] things you shouldn't do and you get out
[1:11:21] from under the fellowship of God I dunno
[1:11:25] I spent many years back slid many years
[1:11:28] never did one single thing that I ever
[1:11:30] didn't think that I was doing wrong not
[1:11:32] one time I knew it every time I done it
[1:11:35] I knew I was doing wrong something in my
[1:11:37] heart said you shouldn't be doing that
[1:11:40] something there was something still in
[1:11:42] there you'll never take that out
[1:11:44] you could never take that out what was
[1:11:47] that and inside they're saying that's
[1:11:49] wrong don't you do that I did it anyway
[1:11:55] what was that
[1:11:57] here we go back to that little moment
[1:11:59] when you took your first breath and God
[1:12:02] placed that part of him can we ever
[1:12:05] fathom that that God placed part of him
[1:12:07] inside you when you go walking around
[1:12:11] going where you go day to day you're
[1:12:13] walking around with a piece of God
[1:12:15] inside of you a piece of the eternal
[1:12:17] creator inside of you can you ever
[1:12:20] fathom that human minds will never
[1:12:23] fathom but here God says I thought of
[1:12:26] you before the foundation of the world
[1:12:29] I'm holding that thought to when you
[1:12:32] come it might be billions of years
[1:12:33] before you ever come on this earth and
[1:12:35] when you took your first breath God
[1:12:37] never forgot the thought he never forgot
[1:12:40] the thought he takes that thought of you
[1:12:41] that he and places it in there and
[1:12:43] you're his favorite person you're his
[1:12:46] favorite why would you not be why would
[1:12:50] hold a thought for billions and billions
[1:12:51] and billions in years if it's not dear
[1:12:55] to you you can't hold a thought that
[1:12:59] long if you didn't like it but God says
[1:13:02] I'll place that thought right down in
[1:13:03] brother West that's my thought I thought
[1:13:06] of this before the foundation of the
[1:13:07] world and now I'm putting it in him it
[1:13:09] may be many years before he knows it's
[1:13:11] there but there was things even when he
[1:13:14] but before I ever heard of this message
[1:13:16] there was things that struck his heart
[1:13:18] might not do that something that he
[1:13:21] couldn't explain it they couldn't
[1:13:23] explain it but he was in there so can
[1:13:29] you ever fall and stay fallen out of
[1:13:31] fellowship it's impossible it's
[1:13:35] impossible if God ever had a thought of
[1:13:38] you ever one single thought you're an
[1:13:44] eternity
[1:13:46] you're eternal listen this both Bram
[1:13:51] said in fellowship God wanted fellowship
[1:13:54] and if we no matter if meant today is a
[1:13:58] fallen son of God there are some parts
[1:14:00] of God still in that man in his fallen
[1:14:02] state you take a man today that can
[1:14:07] split an atom a molecule or whatever you
[1:14:09] want to call it you can drive a jet
[1:14:11] plane around the world in a few hours
[1:14:12] you can see that he is sometimes he is a
[1:14:14] fallen creation he cannot create
[1:14:16] anything he can revert what has been
[1:14:18] created is something better himself
[1:14:20] that shows that man man never came from
[1:14:22] animal life because animal can
[1:14:24] continually builds the same habitations
[1:14:26] to live in but man makes him a better
[1:14:27] house but a way of living better closed
[1:14:29] better transportation now all that shows
[1:14:32] there's something behind
[1:14:33] even in his following state he's the son
[1:14:34] of God fallen and then when he wants
[1:14:37] fellowship and when we get courtship and
[1:14:39] things like that it's blown a basis of
[1:14:40] agreement so you've got a son or
[1:14:46] daughter that's back slid you're
[1:14:48] backslidden you're in a place that you
[1:14:51] know you're not right with God I've
[1:14:55] actually had people tell me they want to
[1:14:57] come back to church but they think they
[1:14:58] went too far if you have a desire to
[1:15:02] come back Ewing went too far God says I
[1:15:07] put that if God placed that in you
[1:15:10] before the foundation of the world if
[1:15:13] you ever lose it he and God God's never
[1:15:16] lost a thing and so if you can stay in
[1:15:20] that following condition if you can stay
[1:15:23] there with that peace of God in you if
[1:15:25] you can stay fallen he's not God you may
[1:15:28] stay in that condition for years but
[1:15:32] when God quickens that thought there's
[1:15:35] going to be one day God's gonna quicken
[1:15:37] the thought
[1:15:39] you might be driving down the road and
[1:15:42] all sudden you just feel overwhelmed
[1:15:42] it's God's time for you
[1:15:44] you start thinking all you've done you
[1:15:45] think Lord I shoulda never done that
[1:15:47] I've got to get right with God you may
[1:15:50] take the loss of a loved one
[1:15:51] you may take a trial in your life that
[1:15:54] you know there's no way that I'm gonna
[1:15:55] get over this trial it may take
[1:15:57] something major in your life to quicken
[1:15:59] that little seed that was put in there
[1:16:01] before the foundation of the world but
[1:16:02] God's gonna quicken it it's impossible
[1:16:05] for you to stay falling if you have a
[1:16:07] part of God in you because God cannot
[1:16:10] fall I'm what I'm gonna jump here I'm
[1:16:23] taking too long
[1:16:29] what if God just as he did it in Adam
[1:16:33] just spoke a body here he is he speaks
[1:16:37] his body he steps into it but he did
[1:16:43] that and from that time to this what God
[1:16:47] had done that there'll be no sin there
[1:16:50] will be no sin here of all the things
[1:16:54] that we have today it'd be nice we could
[1:16:56] speak to trees mountains whatever what
[1:17:00] if God did that we think you know that
[1:17:04] would be nice
[1:17:07] you would never know him as a healer
[1:17:10] you would never know when there's a
[1:17:11] redeemer you would never know him as a
[1:17:14] savior these are attributes that God had
[1:17:18] there's not one single attribute that
[1:17:20] God has that he doesn't want to reveal
[1:17:21] to you the only way he can reveal that
[1:17:24] to you is through fellowship so feed had
[1:17:27] done that God's desire was to inhabit a
[1:17:30] man inhabit man inhabit fallen man
[1:17:36] through the blood I was tell I don't
[1:17:41] know after we were down in there
[1:17:43] Christmas I was talking to my brother
[1:17:45] not feel I said you realize when God
[1:17:49] spoke that body going to to fellowship
[1:17:53] with Abraham God the Creator spoke a
[1:17:57] body took the elements out of the ground
[1:17:59] and spoke a body and stepped into it
[1:18:02] even in that body God was not satisfied
[1:18:06] he was not satisfied this was a sinless
[1:18:09] body created body brand-new spoke it
[1:18:14] from the 16 elements of the earth and he
[1:18:16] speaks his body and to exist in steps
[1:18:18] into it and you think man that would be
[1:18:19] great but God says this ain't what I
[1:18:22] want this is that body did not satisfy
[1:18:25] God's ultimate desire to fellowship he
[1:18:30] could fellowship with Abraham in this
[1:18:32] body he could fellowship with him God's
[1:18:36] realtors are was it in habit Abraham was
[1:18:39] to be inside Abraham to be inside of you
[1:18:42] so you know the God the Creator that he
[1:18:45] could done anything he wanted look at
[1:18:47] yourself
[1:18:48] if we can look at ourselves through our
[1:18:50] own human eyes look at the things that
[1:18:52] you've done in your life that nobody
[1:18:53] knows about look how dirty and filthy
[1:18:55] that you are we're dirt WordArt
[1:19:00] there's things very there I dare say
[1:19:03] there's not anybody here that don't have
[1:19:05] a secret I've got him
[1:19:09] everybody's got secrets you would be
[1:19:12] ashamed if anybody knew but God said I
[1:19:15] want to live in that I want to live in
[1:19:18] that I want to live in that that's what
[1:19:20] I want to live in that dirt I want to
[1:19:22] live inside that dirt we can't
[1:19:26] comprehend it that was God's fellowship
[1:19:28] and here God wants to reveal himself
[1:19:30] revealing look at the way God chooses to
[1:19:33] reveal himself he reveals himself
[1:19:34] through the word to the word that's not
[1:19:37] all God uses creatures of time and
[1:19:40] implements of time to reveal himself how
[1:19:43] else would you know what all God created
[1:19:46] we brother Donnie V stick this stuff up
[1:19:47] here on the screen we see all the stuff
[1:19:49] that God created how would you know if
[1:19:52] God didn't take took a creature of time
[1:19:54] a man that's possibly a creature of time
[1:19:56] come inside him in his mind his mind and
[1:20:00] he puts together this thing they call
[1:20:03] the telescope and there's God builds his
[1:20:06] telescope back in the 1920's 1930's he
[1:20:09] begins to develop a telescope and starts
[1:20:10] looking in the galaxies and say hey
[1:20:12] y'all those little bright lights we sit
[1:20:13] there those ain't stars those are
[1:20:15] galaxies Edwin Hubble 1920s so God uses
[1:20:20] a creature of time to develop an
[1:20:23] implement of time to look into the
[1:20:27] eternal and then as time evolves men get
[1:20:34] smarter smarter God allows it God allows
[1:20:38] it man to get smarter to build these
[1:20:41] telescopes so they can see him
[1:20:42] light-years away and take pictures that
[1:20:46] we stand in our house would you know how
[1:20:49] great of a God created that God was if
[1:20:51] you didn't see it if God didn't use
[1:20:53] these implements of time such as a
[1:20:56] smartphone where you can look at it a
[1:20:57] laptop a projection screen that you can
[1:20:59] look at God's creation these are
[1:21:01] implements of time but God is usually
[1:21:03] needs to reveal himself and on it to
[1:21:07] eternity
[1:21:08] when these implements of time fade away
[1:21:11] then God can tell you about himself
[1:21:14] he can show you himself I'm gonna wind
[1:21:23] down here in study in this I got to
[1:21:27] thinking about Peter you know Peter you
[1:21:36] know he thought he done lost all
[1:21:39] fellowship after he denied Christ three
[1:21:43] times and it's just this is projected
[1:21:47] even more when we see him running to the
[1:21:49] tomb and he gets slower and slower and
[1:21:51] slower
[1:21:52] put yourself in Peters shoes when you
[1:21:58] look at Peter you thinking Peters
[1:22:02] thinking when I get there he's gonna say
[1:22:05] depart from me I never knew you you
[1:22:07] denied me I don't fellowship with you
[1:22:10] anymore Peter was the only one that he
[1:22:14] projected himself love to when he got
[1:22:16] there he loved him all but he wanted to
[1:22:18] he wanted to stress to Peter the love
[1:22:23] Peter do you love me you know I do Lord
[1:22:25] Peter do you love me when he was
[1:22:27] instructing him to feed his sheep
[1:22:30] this was God's trust in him this was him
[1:22:32] trusting and will give myself to you and
[1:22:34] will give my word to you you're gonna go
[1:22:35] feed my sheep because I love you and you
[1:22:38] love me
[1:22:40] so Peter in his human mind you realize
[1:22:46] the blood had already been shed his sins
[1:22:48] were covered the blood had already been
[1:22:50] shed but it Satan got in here devil was
[1:22:55] telling him when you get there ain't
[1:22:57] gonna have nothin to do with you you
[1:22:59] remember when he says when the
[1:23:01] crows three times you'll deny me and he
[1:23:06] did how many times has Satan got in our
[1:23:09] mine it says because you've done that
[1:23:10] God ain't gonna talk to you God don't
[1:23:13] have nothing to do with you
[1:23:14] people will actually leave fellowship
[1:23:17] over something that will quit church
[1:23:20] over something they done and afraid what
[1:23:22] people think sorry what God things
[1:23:26] listen long as I know I've got a part
[1:23:29] down here I got a part of God living
[1:23:32] inside of me it don't matter what
[1:23:36] anybody thinks
[1:23:37] long as I have fellowship with him and
[1:23:39] he has fellowship with me listen I'm
[1:23:42] gonna fail I'm gonna fall gonna make
[1:23:45] mistakes I'm gonna make people mad
[1:23:47] that's human nature that's human nature
[1:23:54] there was a thought that I had him will
[1:23:56] close now but here you go on account
[1:24:04] brother David Siler I was at his church
[1:24:06] about 3-4 weeks ago ain't preached his
[1:24:08] sermon called God remembers and it
[1:24:10] really struck my heart he's talking
[1:24:13] about God then how God wrote had this
[1:24:20] book that he wrote the sins of these
[1:24:22] people and God remembered that and cast
[1:24:24] him out but he there's another group
[1:24:27] that the things they did they said God
[1:24:29] remembered and he wrote him down and God
[1:24:33] remembered but the striking thing that
[1:24:35] he brother David said that really just
[1:24:39] sunk how I was studying some of this at
[1:24:41] the time that he said that he said when
[1:24:44] God looks at you what God remembers is
[1:24:48] the very first thought he had of him so
[1:24:53] when he looks at you when he looks at
[1:24:55] you in your faults and your failures the
[1:24:59] mistakes that you've made he looks at
[1:25:01] you and he still sees that first thought
[1:25:05] because God can't see you through
[1:25:07] anything but the blood
[1:25:10] and you're a thought of God and when he
[1:25:14] he projects himself to you and you
[1:25:17] project back and this fellowship that's
[1:25:20] how God sees if I'm having fellowship
[1:25:22] with a brother gene I'm having felt your
[1:25:24] brother Wes you know your fellowship as
[1:25:28] I said earlier your fellowship back to
[1:25:29] God is if God's just worship
[1:25:33] that's worship when you tell God how you
[1:25:36] feel God I had a wonderful day today it
[1:25:41] ain't all about tell him you're hot
[1:25:42] about all your problems God's concerned
[1:25:46] don't get me wrong God is concerned
[1:25:48] about your problems but he loves
[1:25:51] fellowship intimate communication so
[1:25:55] Strong's caused this word fellowship in
[1:25:57] the Bible intimate communication that's
[1:26:02] the kind of communication I have with my
[1:26:04] wife I don't talk to I don't fellowship
[1:26:07] with anybody else like I fellowship with
[1:26:09] her
[1:26:10] you shouldn't fellowship with anybody
[1:26:12] else like you fellowship with God you
[1:26:14] shouldn't fellowship with anything in
[1:26:16] your life like you fellowship with God
[1:26:18] if you're giving something else more
[1:26:20] fellowship than you're giving God my
[1:26:23] daughter might ought to rethink who
[1:26:27] you're what you're giving fellowship to
[1:26:30] let's stand I hope this was a blessing
[1:26:32] to you
[1:26:34] [Applause]
[1:26:44] I was thinking thought I was singing
[1:26:49] this song today my brother here you
[1:26:51] don't mind to sing it you know I was
[1:26:55] reading that that part one
[1:26:57] he said you ever never get falling into
[1:27:00] that in that place when your fallen
[1:27:02] condition that little part of God and
[1:27:05] you haven't had that fellowship in a
[1:27:06] long time you desire that fellowship but
[1:27:10] you think you too you're too far gone
[1:27:12] it's been a long time since you felt to
[1:27:15] fellowship yeah I think often about one
[1:27:19] brother branham said God they didn't
[1:27:21] speak to him for a long time because he
[1:27:24] went with some brothers when he wasn't
[1:27:25] supposed to and the brother in he said
[1:27:27] God he got he didn't feel God and I got
[1:27:30] to thinking that I was singing a song by
[1:27:32] the hair if you could sing it so and
[1:27:33] bring back the new again this is my
[1:27:37] desire if I ever get to a place every
[1:27:40] one of us if you could remember that one
[1:27:45] time when you receive the Holy Ghost I
[1:27:49] can think it's been years then I was
[1:27:54] sitting right back there when I received
[1:27:55] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:56] I've sitting round fronted by the Loess
[1:27:58] we hadn't been in this church very long
[1:28:01] I can think about that moment today
[1:28:13] I've never felt nothing like it since I
[1:28:17] have felt his presence a lot but that
[1:28:22] one moment when he comes down and he
[1:28:24] just washes you full and you think you
[1:28:27] know this is what Jesus must have felt
[1:28:29] like every day this is what Jesus must
[1:28:33] have felt like this every day and you
[1:28:37] get that feeling come over in then it
[1:28:39] goes away
[1:28:40] now you might go a week to month or you
[1:28:44] get in a hard place in your life and
[1:28:45] you're more worried about this issue in
[1:28:48] your life then you are fellowship with
[1:28:50] God and it's it's a while since you feel
[1:28:52] anything you think Lord
[1:28:57] remember that time back there when I was
[1:28:59] sitting in the back and you can fill me
[1:29:00] with the Holy Ghost I want to feel that
[1:29:02] again that's my desire that would just
[1:29:07] mean God alone we were fellowship come
[1:29:09] back I didn't care you saw me I didn't
[1:29:12] care God saw me let this be our prayer
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:34] it seemed the world was mine I had joy I
[1:29:39] had springtime but that's all just a
[1:29:44] memory
