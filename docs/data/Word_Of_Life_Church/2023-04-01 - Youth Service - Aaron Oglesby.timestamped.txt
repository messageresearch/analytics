[31:53] to come
[31:55] when we was in the old church that's
[31:57] where they're going to come
[31:59] evidently it wasn't his time
[32:02] and you know we've we've asked him to
[32:05] come this time and you know
[32:08] Satan's been hitting him different
[32:09] directions like he's trying to stop him
[32:12] Satan will always try to stop a work of
[32:15] God
[32:15] whether it be a young person's life a
[32:18] person's life it's a steal of soul
[32:22] so
[32:23] tonight whenever there comes you have
[32:26] your need however many people is here
[32:28] you have a need in your heart your meat
[32:30] can be met it don't have to be laying up
[32:32] on the hands of praying brother Daryl
[32:34] could pray for you brother could pray
[32:35] for you Billy Rock could pray for you
[32:36] laying on hands but God can meet your
[32:38] needs sitting there pulling on the word
[32:41] as you're pulling on the word
[32:43] put that need before God
[32:46] never does anything in vain

[32:51] Pierre test in vain
[32:53] there's a reason for everything God does

[33:28] pray Lord help the minister get out of
[33:30] the way and we rely on that ministers
[33:32] rely on that getting out of the way
[33:33] because it's not their place to talk to

[36:48] opportunity to stand before you I'm so
[36:51] thankful once again to be invited back
[36:54] even though it didn't work out last time
[36:56] as brother Joe mentioned we don't
[36:58] believe things happen for accident we
[37:00] believe that God's hands is in these
[37:02] things and when we see the enemy come
[37:04] against us and try to stop us we know
[37:06] that God has something great in store
[37:08] for us
[37:09] and um
[37:10] you know I do I do want to just I know
[37:13] everybody's heard and shared with you
[37:14] and I want to say thank you for your
[37:16] prayers as as our family goes through
[37:18] this time
[37:19] but uh
[37:21] I was with my dad on Monday and had a
[37:23] nice conversation with him and we kind
[37:25] of had an idea of where things had
[37:27] turned
[37:28] and uh he looked at me and he said
[37:31] whatever happens
[37:32] do not cancel your trip this weekend
[37:36] he said you you go when you do your job
[37:38] and so I had the opportunity to speak
[37:41] with him Wednesday next to his bedside
[37:43] and
[37:44] knelt down next to him and he was on a
[37:46] lot of morphine and things and couldn't
[37:47] really speak but I let him know I said
[37:49] dad I'm going
[37:51] and I want you to know I love you and he
[37:52] was able to mouth back to me I love you
[37:54] too so listen young people you matter
[37:57] you matter a lot
[37:59] you know that when men and and their
[38:02] dying days
[38:04] once their eyes are set on eternity they
[38:06] begin to think about eternal things
[38:09] and he said no matter what happens you
[38:10] make sure you go and and so what we're
[38:13] here and we are we are
[38:15] sad by the loss but I know where my
[38:17] daddy is and his his life was
[38:19] surrendered to the Lord and so I'm I'm
[38:21] I'm thankful for that and I have a piece
[38:23] in it and before we start in in just a
[38:26] moment we'll stand and read the word I
[38:27] do just want to take a moment and just
[38:30] say some things to you that I never take
[38:33] it for granted when I have the
[38:34] opportunity to to speak to young people
[38:36] of this message because I believe with
[38:38] all my heart that you're the finest
[38:40] young people in the world this message
[38:42] produces the best it produces the best
[38:45] and you know and I know many times
[38:49] many times maybe we don't tell you but I
[38:52] want you to know that I'm proud to be
[38:53] associated with you I'm I'm proud to be
[38:56] associated with the with the young
[38:58] people that I believe are going to be
[38:59] standing on this Earth and when the
[39:01] Rapture strikes and when the body change
[39:03] comes and I believe that I'm looking at
[39:06] a portion of that people here tonight
[39:07] and I'm proud of you and I'm proud to be
[39:10] Associated I'm I'm proud to be in the
[39:12] fight with you you know I know we preach
[39:15] we preach the Holy Ghost and you got to
[39:17] have the token and you're going to hear
[39:18] some of that tonight and we believe that
[39:19] and we're not going to stop preaching
[39:21] that but along the way sometimes I've
[39:23] dealt with a lot of young people that
[39:24] because they haven't come to that place
[39:26] yet they feel like a total failure and I
[39:28] want to tell you tonight that wherever
[39:29] you're at if you're in the battle I'm
[39:30] proud of you if you've reached
[39:32] justification I want to celebrate that
[39:34] justification tonight and if you've
[39:36] reached sanctification I want to
[39:37] celebrate that sanctification but I want
[39:39] to tell you there's more keep going keep
[39:41] going and press for more and if you've
[39:43] received the Holy Ghost there's more
[39:44] keep going press for another refill and
[39:47] press for more of God there's always
[39:49] more of God to be had but but I want you
[39:51] to know that wherever you're at if
[39:53] you're standing in the battle tonight
[39:54] I'm proud to draw swords and I'm proud
[39:57] to stand next to you and fight the enemy
[39:58] because we have one common enemy and we
[40:01] have one common Lord and Savior and I
[40:03] believe that we're at a place today
[40:05] where I need you and you need me and we
[40:07] need each other you know we we our
[40:10] salvation and things like that we
[40:12] understand is worked out as individuals
[40:13] but I can't go on the Rapture until
[40:16] you're ready if your name's on that book
[40:18] and I believe it is so I need you and
[40:21] you need me and I want us to all do our
[40:22] part to be ready to go amen so I want
[40:25] you to know that I love you with the
[40:26] love of the Lord I appreciate this
[40:28] opportunity I appreciate brother Donnie
[40:31] having confidence
[40:32] to invite me to be here tonight so
[40:35] without any more let's turn to the word
[40:37] tonight if you'll stand with me and open
[40:39] to the to the Book of Joshua
[40:42] the second chapter and we have a little
[40:43] bit of a a reading here but it's gonna
[40:45] lay the foundation for what we want to
[40:46] speak on tonight
[40:48] and you know I told brother Joe in the
[40:50] back I said this thought might be a
[40:51] little bit heavy
[40:53] so uh
[40:55] I'll just ask you tonight as we go
[40:56] through this to open your hearts
[40:58] and be willing to be honest with
[41:00] yourself
[41:01] you know we're in this we you know for
[41:03] many years I coached ball and we'd get
[41:05] to practice some days and you'd see kids
[41:07] maybe loafing a little bit or not giving
[41:09] it their all and I say look we've
[41:11] already did the hardest part we showed
[41:12] up now let's don't waste the fact that
[41:15] we're here you did went through the
[41:17] effort of being here tonight so don't
[41:18] don't waste the effort give it
[41:19] everything you got lock in and allow the
[41:22] Lord to speak to you and be honest with
[41:24] yourself tonight Joshua the second
[41:26] chapter the first verse
[41:28] says in Joshua the son of nuns sent out
[41:31] of shouldom two men to spy secretly
[41:33] saying go view the land even Jericho and
[41:36] they went and came into a harlot's house
[41:38] named Rahab and lodged there
[41:41] and it was told the king of Jericho
[41:43] saying behold there came men in hither
[41:45] tonight of the children of Israel to
[41:47] search out the country
[41:49] and the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab
[41:51] saying bring forth the men that are come
[41:54] to thee which are entered into thine
[41:56] house for they become to search out all
[41:58] the country
[41:59] and the woman took the two men and hid
[42:01] them and said thus there came men unto
[42:04] me but I wish not once they were and it
[42:07] came to pass about the time of shedding
[42:09] of the gate when it was dark that the
[42:11] men went out whether the men went I what
[42:13] not pursue after them quickly for you
[42:15] shall overtake them but she had brought
[42:18] them up unto the roof of the house and
[42:20] hid them with the stalks of flax which
[42:22] she had laid in order upon the roof and
[42:25] the men pursued after them the way to
[42:26] Jordan unto the Fords and as soon as
[42:28] they which pursued after them were gone
[42:30] out they shut the gate and before they
[42:33] were laid down she came up unto unto
[42:35] them upon the roof and she said unto the
[42:37] men I know that the Lord hath given you
[42:40] the land and that your Terror has fallen
[42:42] upon us and that all the inhabitants
[42:44] attempts of the land faint because of
[42:46] you
[42:47] for we have heard how the Lord dried up
[42:49] the water of the Red Sea for you when
[42:51] you came out of Egypt and what you did
[42:53] unto the two kings of the amorites that
[42:55] were on the other side of Jordan Zion
[42:57] and OGG whom you utterly destroyed and
[43:00] as soon as we had heard these things our
[43:02] hearts didn't melt neither did there
[43:04] remain any more courage in any man
[43:06] because of you
[43:07] for the Lord your God he is God in
[43:10] heaven above and in Earth beneath now
[43:13] therefore I pray you swear unto me by
[43:15] the Lord since I have showed you
[43:17] kindness that you will also show
[43:19] kindness unto my father's house and give
[43:22] me a true token and that you will save
[43:24] alive my father and my mother and my
[43:26] brother and my sisters and all that they
[43:29] have and deliver our our lives from
[43:31] death and the men answered her our life
[43:34] for yours if you utter not this our
[43:36] business and it shall be when the Lord
[43:38] hath given us the land that we will deal
[43:40] kindly and truly with thee then she let
[43:43] them down by a cord through the window
[43:45] for her house was upon the town wall and
[43:47] she dwelt upon the wall and she said
[43:50] unto them get you to the mountains lest
[43:52] the pursuers meet you and hide yourself
[43:54] there three days until the pursuers be
[43:57] returned and afterward you may go your
[43:59] way and the men said unto her we will be
[44:01] blameless of this thine oath which thou
[44:03] has made us swear behold when we come
[44:06] into the land Thou shalt bind this line
[44:08] of scarlet threat in the window which
[44:10] thou just let us down by and thou shalt
[44:13] bring thy father and thy mother and thy
[44:15] Brethren and all thy father's household
[44:16] home unto thee and it shall be that
[44:19] whoever shall go out of the doors of thy
[44:21] house into the street his blood shall be
[44:24] upon his head and we will be Guiltless
[44:27] and whosoever shall be with thee in the
[44:29] house his blood shall be on our head if
[44:32] any hand be upon him I want you to
[44:34] notice it won't be the messenger's fault
[44:37] if you don't do what they told you to do
[44:40] they're letting you know look if you do
[44:42] this you'll be saved but if you don't
[44:43] it's not our fault we've told you
[44:45] exactly what you have to do
[44:47] verse 20 and if thou utter this our
[44:50] business then we will be quit of thine
[44:52] oath which thou has made us to swear
[44:55] and she said according unto your word so
[44:57] be it and she went
[45:00] she sent them away and they departed and
[45:02] she bound the Scarlet line in the window
[45:04] let's pray together
[45:08] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we stand
[45:10] here Lord humbled Lord at the sight of
[45:13] of these young people Lord a portion
[45:16] lord of the price that Lord that you
[45:18] purchased there at Calvary these are
[45:20] those that you died for and Lord we
[45:22] don't take this lightly as we stand here
[45:23] and speak to them
[45:25] Lord what we recognize Lord as we stand
[45:27] here is that we really don't have
[45:28] anything to offer them Lord
[45:30] Lord that we need you to come and take
[45:32] control and take this vessel and move me
[45:34] out the way and calm my nerves and
[45:36] settle my spirit Lord and just allow me
[45:39] to to allow you to speak Lord I pray if
[45:42] there be a single heart here that
[45:43] doesn't know you or hasn't gone all the
[45:45] way with you that tonight would be that
[45:47] night Lord that Lord they can break
[45:48] through the lies and the hindrances that
[45:50] the enemy has put upon them Lord that
[45:53] they can recognize Lord that there is a
[45:55] message of Freedom that there is a blood
[45:56] Lord there is an atonement that is for
[45:58] them
[45:59] Lord we ask you to have your way and
[46:01] that you'll speak to every heart and
[46:02] Lord May there be freedom in the house
[46:04] of God now may every hindrance spirit
[46:06] and anything that would try to hinder
[46:07] this service we bind it now in the name
[46:09] of Jesus and we give you Liberty to
[46:11] speak father in Jesus name we pray
[46:14] amen amen you may have your seats
[46:18] amen we just want to get right into it
[46:20] tonight and I want to start with asking
[46:22] you a simple question and if we were to
[46:25] title this tonight it would be the title
[46:26] of our message but the question is
[46:28] what's hidden
[46:31] what's hidden I want you as we go
[46:34] through this ask this in your own life
[46:35] what is hidden what is it you're hiding
[46:38] because all of us have hidden something
[46:40] in our lives
[46:41] every single one of us our our story
[46:44] today is going to revolve around a great
[46:46] victory
[46:47] it's going to revolve around two people
[46:49] hiding things both of them are part of
[46:52] the same battle
[46:54] they both come from opposite directions
[46:56] but they end up at the same place and
[46:57] they're both going to hide things and
[46:59] both of their stories are going to have
[47:01] very different outcomes and the outcome
[47:03] is going to be determined by what's
[47:06] hidden
[47:07] what it was that they chose to hide
[47:12] on this day it was a little bit
[47:13] different than most days there in the
[47:15] city of Jericho
[47:17] sure they had mighty walls that
[47:19] surrounded them
[47:20] so tall and so thick they seem to be
[47:23] impenetrable they they most of the time
[47:25] felt safe other armies had had come
[47:28] before and tried to take the city and
[47:30] yet they had failed
[47:32] and every time they'd come these walls
[47:34] had stood the test but something was
[47:36] different today there was a different
[47:37] nervousness in the city and everyone is
[47:39] scared in the city and moving about with
[47:42] a different energy and there's Whispers
[47:43] And and people know that that
[47:45] something's different and they're scared
[47:47] because there are reports that the
[47:50] Israelites are getting closer there's
[47:52] nervousness in the place and like I said
[47:54] armies had come before and armies had
[47:56] failed but this time it was different
[47:58] because the reports that the people of
[48:00] the city were hearing were different
[48:02] from any reports they'd ever heard
[48:03] before the testimonies that was come out
[48:06] of this Camp was different from the
[48:08] testimonies that they had heard before
[48:10] they that they had heard reports of
[48:12] other people coming and when they had
[48:13] came they had failed but but what they
[48:15] hear about this people is that their God
[48:17] is going before them and that their God
[48:19] is giving them victory over every
[48:21] obstacle that rising in front of them
[48:23] over every King that has risen up in
[48:25] front of them and they're hearing these
[48:26] reports and as Rahab said there in verse
[48:28] 11 she said their hearts have melted and
[48:31] their courage is gone you know that's a
[48:34] little bit different story from what the
[48:35] devil's been telling you this week isn't
[48:37] it that you're not good enough that
[48:39] you're not going to make it that you're
[48:40] never going to amount to anything that
[48:42] you can't be forgiven that you've Fallen
[48:44] too many times or or maybe that you've
[48:46] crossed the line actually the truth of
[48:48] the matter is the devil knows that he
[48:51] cannot stand before you he knows that he
[48:55] can't stand before you because the
[48:56] reports coming out of this people is
[48:59] different from the reports that they've
[49:00] heard before brother Branham says a very
[49:03] familiar quote here he says he knows
[49:05] that if the people get the true
[49:06] revelation of the true church and what
[49:09] she is and what she stands for and that
[49:10] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[49:13] an invincible Army now the the key here
[49:17] in this line is that he knows and his
[49:20] goal is to make sure that you don't know
[49:22] that's why the constant attacks that's
[49:24] why the fear that's why the anxiety
[49:26] that's why you're not good enough trying
[49:28] to keep you beat down keep you beat down
[49:30] because he knows and the last thing he
[49:33] can do is let you know because once you
[49:36] know he says you're going to be an
[49:38] invincible Army I want to tell you
[49:40] something tonight I'm looking at a
[49:41] people that are part of an invincible
[49:43] Army the world may look at you as some
[49:46] kind of backwash or Outcast or nobody
[49:48] but our God says you're an invincible
[49:50] Army and the devil's says I know that if
[49:54] they find out who they really are they
[49:56] will be an invincible Army and so that's
[49:58] why these attacks come he wants you to
[50:02] be afraid of him but I'd like to declare
[50:05] tonight that the enemy has heard the
[50:07] reports this group of young people is
[50:09] different from you groups in the past
[50:11] this group has broken free from Egypt
[50:13] and nothing that gets in their way has
[50:15] stopped them the Red Sea rose up they
[50:17] went through it the serpents came out in
[50:19] the wilderness they kept going they
[50:21] needed food God reigned it down from
[50:23] heaven this group of young people is
[50:25] different from groups before lust
[50:28] Spirits they conquered them pornography
[50:30] they've conquered them suicide Spirits
[50:32] they've conquered them whatever has
[50:34] risen up before this people they have
[50:36] conquered them and the devil says and
[50:39] they're still coming and they're getting
[50:41] closer oh Hallelujah I'm telling you as
[50:43] we get closer to the final strongholds
[50:45] of the enemy he knows his walls can't
[50:48] hold you he knows he can't keep you here
[50:50] and he is scared of you
[50:53] the enemy is scared of you tonight
[50:56] Hallelujah
[50:57] and he knows that he can't stop you
[51:00] so what he tries to do is he tries to
[51:02] get you
[51:03] to stop yourself
[51:06] he tries to get you to doubt what you've
[51:08] been called to
[51:10] he tries to bring a negative report out
[51:12] of your mouth or set a negative Vision
[51:14] in front of you the way he did there at
[51:16] kadish barnia Twitter became a negative
[51:18] report well we just can't do it
[51:21] we just ain't gonna be able to make it
[51:23] and if he can get you not to see who you
[51:25] are if he can get you doubt on what
[51:27] you've been called to but tonight I
[51:29] believe there's some Joshua and calebs
[51:31] raising up in this generation that says
[51:33] I don't care who falls away I don't care
[51:35] who goes this way or that you're going
[51:37] to give me my Mountain I've been called
[51:39] to a body change I've been called to a
[51:41] Rapture I've been called to do more than
[51:43] just be a church member here in Johnson
[51:45] City Tennessee have been called to more
[51:47] than that I've been called to be a part
[51:50] of an invincible Army that tears down
[51:52] the final strongholds of the enemy
[51:54] that's who you are that's what you're
[51:57] called to Don't Stop short don't settle
[51:59] don't listen to his report this report
[52:02] says you're going to make it this report
[52:04] says you're an overcomer
[52:06] Hallelujah
[52:10] brother Branham says
[52:12] all the country is afraid of you when we
[52:15] heard that the Lord dried up the Red Sea
[52:17] and let you cross drown Pharaoh's Army
[52:19] give you food by man out of the
[52:21] Wilderness put a brass serpent up for an
[52:24] atonement
[52:25] he'd done all these things for you and I
[52:27] know what you've done destroying OG and
[52:30] the other kings I've seen what you did
[52:32] utterly destroyed and when we heard this
[52:35] and you were headed our way we just
[52:38] fainted there's no more courage left in
[52:42] no one
[52:43] Church you're fighting a defeated enemy
[52:45] you're fighting an enemy that's already
[52:47] given up you're fighting one who knows
[52:49] you're gonna win if you will keep
[52:52] fighting the one thing he tries to get
[52:54] you to do is lay your sword down and
[52:55] think there's no hope he is the one
[52:58] tonight with no hope he is the one that
[53:00] was stripped of every right he ever had
[53:01] that day on Calvary it's been restored
[53:04] to you and I'm just telling you just
[53:05] keep going you're going to win just keep
[53:07] pressing the battle you're gonna make it
[53:09] you're not gonna quit you're not gonna
[53:11] fail you're not gonna give in oh this
[53:13] one failed I thought he was strong this
[53:15] ain't about this one this is about you
[53:17] and what you're called to and I'm
[53:19] telling you you're gonna make it you're
[53:21] gonna overcome you're going to be
[53:23] standing there I choose to believe that
[53:25] tonight and it's time that we start
[53:27] taking the word and saying that's who I
[53:29] am that's what I'm called to
[53:31] Hallelujah
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:36] Rahab had
[53:38] been a woman of the streets for many
[53:40] years and
[53:42] brother Branham says it's a life that
[53:44] she had been forced into
[53:47] he says let's picture her this morning
[53:49] for a few minutes
[53:51] as a young lady
[53:52] a beautiful young woman
[53:55] who some Misfortune in life had been
[53:58] forced into being the pagan
[54:00] had been forced into the life that she
[54:02] was living
[54:03] and many times people are forced into
[54:06] the life
[54:07] that they live
[54:10] you know maybe you can relate tonight
[54:12] maybe you're in a place where you don't
[54:15] really want to be at in life
[54:17] maybe you didn't see yourself struggling
[54:19] at this point in life
[54:21] maybe you hadn't went as far down the
[54:23] road as you thought you should be
[54:25] maybe the devil's taking you down roads
[54:27] into places you never thought you'd go
[54:30] lied to you and convince you that you're
[54:33] worthless
[54:34] that the sins you've done can never be
[54:37] forgiven that you've crossed the line
[54:39] that you're not good enough and that
[54:41] people don't really care
[54:43] but tonight an opportunity comes
[54:44] knocking
[54:46] it says maybe you were forced into this
[54:48] life maybe you didn't have much Choice
[54:49] maybe the devil's forced you this way
[54:51] but tonight there's a message of
[54:52] Deliverance that says as the walls fall
[54:54] you don't have to perish
[54:56] when the walls come down and I'm telling
[54:58] you the walls of this world are
[54:59] crumbling faster than the walls of
[55:01] Jericho but there's a place of safety
[55:02] tonight and he's offering that to you
[55:04] saying you haven't gone too far you
[55:06] haven't crossed the line he's here
[55:07] tonight saying I died for you that
[55:10] scarlet cord is for you surrender your
[55:12] everything to me tonight and you can
[55:13] have a place of safety it's a message of
[55:16] Deliverance
[55:18] and the Bible tells us that the spies
[55:19] came into her house and and whether it
[55:22] be that she still practice a life of
[55:24] harlotry or or maybe at this point she
[55:27] ran an end as many believed but either
[55:29] way the fact is to see men and come to
[55:32] to come and go from her house would not
[55:33] have been an odd thing
[55:35] this was this would have been a common
[55:36] occurrence but what's amazing to me
[55:40] is that these men going into her house
[55:42] stood out
[55:45] they didn't fit in with the rest of
[55:47] Jericho
[55:48] I want to ask you tonight if that's your
[55:50] testimony as you walk through this evil
[55:52] world and go places look it's not
[55:53] uncommon to see people walk in Walmart
[55:55] it's not uncommon to see people walk
[55:57] wherever you go shopping in this store
[55:59] in that store and stop at Starbucks but
[56:01] when you stop at those places do you
[56:03] stand out or you're someone that people
[56:06] notice because these people went into a
[56:08] harlot's house or into the end and
[56:09] people's coming and going all day but
[56:11] when they saw these men they said
[56:13] something's different we know these
[56:15] people don't belong here and I want that
[56:16] to be our testimony is I don't know what
[56:18] it is but these people right here don't
[56:20] belong here they're from somewhere else
[56:22] and I want to testify you're right you
[56:24] nailed me you got me pegged I don't
[56:26] belong here I'm just passing through and
[56:28] and they notice these and it isn't long
[56:30] until the king sends word and says give
[56:32] the men to us
[56:35] we know that they are spies and In This
[56:37] Moment Rahab
[56:39] which is one of the the most important
[56:41] moments in our whole story she
[56:43] recognizes her opportunity
[56:46] young people it's extremely important
[56:48] that you recognize your opportunities
[56:51] you Matthew speaks in not Matthew excuse
[56:54] me Jesus speaks in Luke 19 and he's
[56:56] speaking about the destruction of
[56:57] Jerusalem and he says It Came Upon them
[57:00] because they didn't recognize their time
[57:02] of visitation
[57:04] recognizing your opportunities is is of
[57:08] vital importance there is many people
[57:10] who walked into the presence of Jesus
[57:12] they didn't come out change because they
[57:14] didn't recognize what was going on
[57:17] how many times do you gather here in
[57:19] this place on a Wednesday night or on a
[57:21] Sunday or on a youth service and Jesus
[57:24] Christ moves through this place and we
[57:26] don't recognize our opportunities
[57:28] we got to get Beyond it's just church or
[57:31] it's just brother Donnie or it's just
[57:32] brother Joe or brother Daryl I said
[57:33] that's not what it is the King of Kings
[57:36] and the Lord of lords comes down to
[57:38] commune with you to speak to you to set
[57:41] you free and and to change your life in
[57:43] those moments we have to recognize this
[57:45] isn't just a church service this is an
[57:48] eternal opportunity to be changed
[57:50] forever to be delivered forever to be
[57:53] set free forever this is an opportunity
[57:55] I don't want to let it pass me by I
[57:58] don't want to miss this moment in this
[57:59] presence and in that moment you've got
[58:01] to grab hold to it and Rahab recognizes
[58:05] her opportunity this is her chance at
[58:07] life
[58:08] this is her chance at life she may not
[58:11] get another chance this is it this is
[58:13] that one
[58:16] listen more than ever I want you to
[58:17] understand you don't know when your last
[58:20] chance is we're not here to preach fear
[58:22] and those I don't care who who we're
[58:24] talking to we don't know I don't know
[58:26] you don't know don't pass an opportunity
[58:29] look into another opportunity grab each
[58:32] and every opportunity as it comes your
[58:34] way
[58:35] and she decides she's going to be all in
[58:38] she's going to be all in this is her
[58:39] moment she recognizes her opportunity
[58:41] and she holds nothing back
[58:43] I pray that each one of us will
[58:44] recognize our opportunity tonight
[58:46] wherever we're at whatever our need is I
[58:48] need I need him tonight I recognize
[58:50] tonight I need you this is my
[58:52] opportunity in your presence Lord
[58:55] and In This Moment without ever
[58:56] witnessing a thing that's the amazing
[58:58] thing about Rahab brother Branham deals
[59:00] with this she had not witnessed a
[59:02] miracle
[59:03] she had not been there when the Red Sea
[59:05] opened she had never met Joshua she had
[59:07] never met Moses
[59:09] come on young people you can relate
[59:12] in some ways you know we've told you a
[59:14] lot of stories about brother brown but
[59:16] there aren't many people in here can say
[59:17] they ever met him
[59:19] she had never met Joshua
[59:22] but she heard
[59:24] and she believed
[59:25] without witnessing a miracle
[59:28] without stepping into the presence of
[59:30] the messenger per se she was willing to
[59:32] risk it all
[59:34] brother Branham says she never said I'll
[59:36] believe when I see a great anointed
[59:38] Joshua do some sign if I could have seen
[59:41] Moses do some of the signs I would have
[59:43] believed but she said I have heard Faith
[59:46] cometh by hearing hearing of the word I
[59:48] have heard that the god of Heaven which
[59:50] is the real God is with you and he's
[59:53] done great signs and wonders he dried up
[59:55] the Red Sea he brought plagues from
[59:57] Egypt
[59:59] listen I dare say that everybody in this
[1:00:01] room has witnessed more than Rahab had
[1:00:03] ever witnessed
[1:00:06] she was heathen
[1:00:08] she never had the opportunity to sit in
[1:00:10] a church service
[1:00:11] sit there while songs were sung and
[1:00:13] brother Harry played the organ and the
[1:00:15] spirit moved and to feel the Holy Spirit
[1:00:17] move through a place she never
[1:00:18] experienced that
[1:00:20] she didn't come from a Godly home where
[1:00:22] parents prayed for and tried to steer
[1:00:24] her in the right direction as a matter
[1:00:25] of fact she had been pushed out of her
[1:00:26] home by her parents
[1:00:28] you have experienced and have had
[1:00:31] greater opportunity than Rahab
[1:00:33] Rahab only having heard
[1:00:36] do we take for granted the opportunities
[1:00:39] that we have
[1:00:41] to hear Time After Time After Time to
[1:00:44] fill his presence to be told she was
[1:00:46] told one time and it was her one chance
[1:00:51] and in this moment she takes a hold of
[1:00:53] it she says I want to live
[1:00:55] oh if there be a young people here
[1:00:56] tonight to say I want to live I want to
[1:00:59] live I recognize the death that's all
[1:01:01] around me but Lord I just want to live
[1:01:02] and she says in this moment she says I
[1:01:04] want to live I don't care what I have to
[1:01:07] give up I don't care who makes fun I
[1:01:09] don't care who mocks I don't care what
[1:01:11] friends I have to leave behind whatever
[1:01:13] it takes I just want to live I recognize
[1:01:16] in this moment I want life I believe
[1:01:18] this is a real living God I believe
[1:01:20] these testimonies to be true I know that
[1:01:22] I know that it's getting closer I know
[1:01:24] that it's getting closer and in this
[1:01:26] moment of life and death
[1:01:28] she has to make a decision
[1:01:31] the king who she has served up until
[1:01:33] this point
[1:01:35] oh come on we've all had those kings
[1:01:38] but that King sends a message
[1:01:41] and says give me the men
[1:01:44] give me The Messengers
[1:01:46] let's bring it down he says give me the
[1:01:49] message you've received
[1:01:51] turn it loose
[1:01:53] turn loose of what's been given to you
[1:01:55] turn loose of the opportunities you've
[1:01:57] been given
[1:01:59] Satan says turn it over to me I'll trade
[1:02:01] you some things
[1:02:02] come on let go of those opportunities
[1:02:04] give me the message you hear just doubt
[1:02:06] it a little bit just turn it over to me
[1:02:08] give it to me and you have the
[1:02:10] opportunity you got a decision to make
[1:02:11] am I going to listen to the king that's
[1:02:13] led me to this place or am I going to
[1:02:15] listen to this message
[1:02:17] this opportunity the one that's offering
[1:02:19] me deliverance and he says give it to me
[1:02:21] give it to me and it's a life and death
[1:02:24] situation and she makes a decision
[1:02:27] Joshua 2 verse 3 in the king of Jericho
[1:02:29] Senator Rahab saying bring forth the men
[1:02:31] that are come to thee
[1:02:34] life and death hangs in the balance in
[1:02:35] this moment
[1:02:38] Rahab was risking way more than some
[1:02:40] mocking
[1:02:43] she was risking way more than walking
[1:02:45] down the street dressed different people
[1:02:46] going
[1:02:48] she was risking way more than losing a
[1:02:51] couple friends
[1:02:52] this was a life and death situation
[1:02:54] she's lying to the king
[1:02:56] she gets caught she's going to be put to
[1:02:58] death her family is going to be put to
[1:02:59] death this is this isn't a a an easy
[1:03:02] matter
[1:03:03] and In This Moment
[1:03:05] she makes her decision
[1:03:08] she says I'll make a trade
[1:03:11] I'll make a trade
[1:03:13] I'm gonna hide them
[1:03:15] I'm going to spare them I'm going to
[1:03:17] give them their life though I risk death
[1:03:18] I'm going to give them the life but I
[1:03:20] want to promise I want a promise in
[1:03:23] return that I'm going to receive life
[1:03:25] listen young people there's a promise
[1:03:26] for you tonight
[1:03:27] there is a promise for you tonight she
[1:03:29] says I want a promise you got to promise
[1:03:31] me that I wanna I won't utter any of
[1:03:33] this I'll hide this message but you got
[1:03:35] to promise me that there's gonna be life
[1:03:37] and you got to recognize tonight
[1:03:39] whatever I have to give up whatever I
[1:03:41] have to do he's already come and made
[1:03:43] the promise he's already done his part
[1:03:44] he's already proved to be faithful he's
[1:03:46] already proved to be true he's already
[1:03:48] established his side of the Covenant and
[1:03:50] he's saying will you hide it will you
[1:03:52] hide me in your heart will you take my
[1:03:54] word will you hold on to this message
[1:03:56] it's life to you will you make that
[1:03:59] trade tonight
[1:04:02] you can imagine
[1:04:04] it's an opportunity tonight
[1:04:07] to make a trade and I tell you whatever
[1:04:09] you're asked to give up whatever you're
[1:04:11] asked to do will never compare to what
[1:04:12] you get in return
[1:04:14] oh listen this exchange rate is
[1:04:16] wonderful
[1:04:17] what a wonderful exchange rate we have
[1:04:19] in the Lord Jesus my sins my failures my
[1:04:22] shortcomings everything I've done wrong
[1:04:25] for his life for his righteousness For
[1:04:27] Eternity for life I can trade in this my
[1:04:30] failures time after time I've come up
[1:04:32] short and he says it's okay I'll trade
[1:04:35] you tonight I'll trade you for eternal
[1:04:37] life
[1:04:38] and he offers that trade tonight amen
[1:04:41] amen and in return I get
[1:04:43] eternity
[1:04:45] I get eternity
[1:04:48] Rahab says this is my chance
[1:04:54] I pray there's young people are not
[1:04:55] recognizing this is my chance I've heard
[1:04:56] of his power
[1:04:58] I've seen him cast out Devils I've seen
[1:05:00] him overcome in other people's life but
[1:05:02] he promised me I can be saved
[1:05:04] listen testimonies are awesome are
[1:05:07] awesome testimonies are amazing and we
[1:05:08] love them and they build our faith but
[1:05:10] the point of them is so that you
[1:05:11] understand what he can do for you
[1:05:14] the point of testimonies from the past
[1:05:16] ain't to talk about what God did in the
[1:05:18] past and so you'll know what he can do
[1:05:19] today
[1:05:20] let's quit leaving it in the past where
[1:05:22] God delivered this one oh and I get so
[1:05:24] thankful we come back many times and I
[1:05:26] hear young people who I know need
[1:05:27] deliverance and yet they'll come back
[1:05:29] from a camp just Rejoice singing oh you
[1:05:31] should have seen this one get delivered
[1:05:32] you should have seen that get delivered
[1:05:33] and I rejoice in it too but in the midst
[1:05:36] of it you were so worried about what
[1:05:38] they needed it's time for some of you to
[1:05:39] grab a hold of what it is you need it's
[1:05:41] some of you to grab a hold and say Lord
[1:05:43] in this moment I want to make a trade I
[1:05:45] want eternal life I want deliver it from
[1:05:48] the things that has kept me I want to
[1:05:50] surrender my all
[1:05:52] and let your story be the story of
[1:05:54] testimony that's told
[1:05:58] she recognized
[1:06:01] I can be saved
[1:06:03] but she knew she had to have a token
[1:06:05] young people tonight there is a token
[1:06:07] that is required
[1:06:08] and whatever you have to do whether you
[1:06:10] have to constrain him whatever you have
[1:06:12] to do you make sure tonight you leave
[1:06:14] here and you have that token I'll
[1:06:17] constrain him I'll do whatever it takes
[1:06:18] but Lord I'm not leaving out of here the
[1:06:20] same I'm not leaving out of here
[1:06:21] wondering you know he told us he said in
[1:06:24] that day you shall know you don't have
[1:06:26] to guess anymore you don't have to be
[1:06:28] guessed where will I think I met the
[1:06:29] Lord you know something no listen I want
[1:06:31] to know that I know that I know that I
[1:06:34] know and in the word he came and he said
[1:06:36] in that day you shall know you have the
[1:06:38] opportunity to know tonight you can get
[1:06:40] that that token get it applied get it
[1:06:43] displayed and you can leave here with
[1:06:44] such a peace you can walk out with no
[1:06:46] fear of death no fear of the Rapture no
[1:06:48] fear of hell no one is displayed it's
[1:06:51] finished he's faithful he's true it's a
[1:06:53] done work I say finish the work tonight
[1:06:56] young people drive the anchor down
[1:06:58] tonight drive a steak down be willing to
[1:07:01] do whatever you've got to do
[1:07:03] but I must have that token no matter
[1:07:07] what
[1:07:09] and so risking her life
[1:07:12] she hides The Messengers on her roof
[1:07:17] brother Joe is there some water
[1:07:19] somewhere thank you buddy
[1:07:23] risking her life she hides The
[1:07:25] Messengers and
[1:07:26] but more importantly
[1:07:29] she hid their message
[1:07:32] in her heart not just the messengers but
[1:07:35] she takes that message
[1:07:37] and from this point on the only thing
[1:07:39] that matters to her
[1:07:40] was the message that had been delivered
[1:07:42] to her by the Messengers
[1:07:44] I must have that token displayed
[1:07:46] I must have my loved ones under the
[1:07:48] token if I apply this they're all going
[1:07:51] to live
[1:07:52] from this point on everything else from
[1:07:54] her past life was meaningless
[1:07:57] and this is where we've been trying to
[1:07:58] get to for a little bit now
[1:08:00] from this point on everything from her
[1:08:02] past life
[1:08:04] is meaningless
[1:08:06] her money
[1:08:08] her old worldly garments
[1:08:12] her lifestyle
[1:08:15] done
[1:08:18] because see now she recognizes that
[1:08:20] those things are associated with death
[1:08:24] those things are associated with the
[1:08:26] destruction that is coming and now her
[1:08:29] Focus was on life
[1:08:32] let me just deal with some little
[1:08:34] nitty-gritty things little small things
[1:08:36] that I know sometimes people deal with
[1:08:37] they're not really small things but
[1:08:41] all of a sudden
[1:08:43] cutting her hair wasn't something she
[1:08:45] wanted to do anymore
[1:08:47] all of a sudden that little bit of
[1:08:48] makeup she wanted to wear didn't seem
[1:08:50] like a big deal that had always seemed
[1:08:52] like a big deal now she recognized
[1:08:53] that's associated with death
[1:08:55] that's associated with what I was
[1:08:58] she's willing to make a clean break
[1:09:00] there revealing clothes that she
[1:09:02] shouldn't be wearing she no longer wants
[1:09:04] any part of that because her focus is
[1:09:06] now on life and no longer associated
[1:09:08] with the things of her past
[1:09:11] worldly music
[1:09:13] come on now
[1:09:16] I know I was there matter of fact
[1:09:19] and I don't ever talk this way I don't I
[1:09:22] don't ever like to give glory to the
[1:09:23] devil but we're going to be honest and
[1:09:24] real tonight when I was your age I
[1:09:27] wasn't living right so I know what the
[1:09:29] battles are I know what the attacks are
[1:09:31] I've been a school teacher for 15 years
[1:09:33] I know how he still comes after you
[1:09:36] I know the music is still the way he
[1:09:39] comes in and attacks and tries to draw
[1:09:41] you and tries to pull on you brother
[1:09:43] Branham didn't call those things out for
[1:09:45] no reason talk about it Gathering people
[1:09:47] to the battle of Armageddon the worldly
[1:09:49] music she no longer wanted that because
[1:09:51] it was associated with death
[1:09:55] violent video games
[1:09:59] the movies
[1:10:02] ungodly relationships
[1:10:06] those things no longer matter to Rahab
[1:10:09] because she knew those things are
[1:10:13] associated with death
[1:10:16] and she recognized that Association and
[1:10:18] she makes a a clean break from it
[1:10:20] tonight and I want to tell you that
[1:10:21] whatever it is that has tried to hold on
[1:10:23] to you whatever it is that tries to
[1:10:25] identify you with that life you got to
[1:10:28] make a clean break from it
[1:10:30] she recognized if I'm going to be
[1:10:31] someone different I can't still have
[1:10:33] things that would tie me back to that
[1:10:36] still attached to my life
[1:10:38] I can't still have that thing and claim
[1:10:40] I've Been Changed come on somebody you
[1:10:43] can't claim I had an experience and I'm
[1:10:45] filled with the Holy Ghost and yet your
[1:10:46] life is still attached to Jericho
[1:10:49] there has to be a willingness to change
[1:10:52] listen I know there's many different
[1:10:54] ways of looking at it but one of the
[1:10:56] main things I look at with young people
[1:10:57] as far as an Evidence of a change in
[1:10:59] their life is that their appetite has
[1:11:02] completely changed suddenly there is a
[1:11:04] hunger for the word there is a hunger
[1:11:06] for the things of God they're drawn to
[1:11:08] the things of life and they take a break
[1:11:10] away from those things not a temporary
[1:11:12] break but a clean break cut off by the
[1:11:14] word of the Lord and they no longer
[1:11:16] desire those things it's not a I wish I
[1:11:19] could but I can't it's those things are
[1:11:22] death and they will have no part in me
[1:11:28] that's where Rahab was
[1:11:30] she's recognizing that those things are
[1:11:32] death and now
[1:11:34] she's come to a place where all she
[1:11:35] wants is life
[1:11:37] all she wants is to be free
[1:11:39] all she wants is her past to be
[1:11:41] completely erased and she prepares
[1:11:43] exactly how they told her too she binds
[1:11:46] the scarlet cord out the window and she
[1:11:48] gets her family inside and and she acts
[1:11:51] on the message
[1:11:52] here's something
[1:11:56] we have to be doers
[1:11:58] not just hearers
[1:12:00] there's a lot of people can quote the
[1:12:02] message up one side and down the other
[1:12:04] and they don't live it for nothing
[1:12:06] she did more than just hide the
[1:12:08] messengers and she did more than tell
[1:12:09] people about the message she acted upon
[1:12:11] the message that was given her she acted
[1:12:14] upon it she put the cord where she was
[1:12:15] told to do it she followed the
[1:12:17] instructions because she recognized this
[1:12:19] message is Vindicated there is a God of
[1:12:21] Miracles that has backed this up and she
[1:12:23] recognized I have to be a doer of what
[1:12:26] I've been told you have to take the
[1:12:28] message and act upon it
[1:12:30] and she knows that nothing from the old
[1:12:31] life is going to be able to go with her
[1:12:34] nothing from the old life young people
[1:12:36] can go with you
[1:12:39] all that mattered now to Rahab was the
[1:12:41] message she would receive
[1:12:43] Prophet God says it like this and this
[1:12:45] young woman after she'd got her first
[1:12:46] hearing of Israel and of a God who was a
[1:12:48] God that answered prayer not only a God
[1:12:50] to pray too but a God that answered back
[1:12:52] when she heard that there was a god of
[1:12:54] Miracles who could perform Miracles who
[1:12:56] dried up the Seas and reigned bread out
[1:12:58] of Heavens her heart began to tremble
[1:13:00] and when she got her first message from
[1:13:02] the two preachers that went over quickly
[1:13:03] she accepted it with all her heart and
[1:13:06] there was a scarlet cord bound at her
[1:13:07] window for a protection of her house
[1:13:09] because she had received the message
[1:13:14] and she attacks and gathers up
[1:13:16] everything that she had from that life
[1:13:20] it didn't mean anything to her she knew
[1:13:22] she couldn't take it with her and she
[1:13:24] takes it all and she just opens up a
[1:13:25] cabinet she knows she's not going to be
[1:13:26] staying there long and she throws it all
[1:13:29] in a cabinet brother Daryl
[1:13:31] shuts it she's leaving it behind
[1:13:34] she's taking nothing with her
[1:13:36] it was basically her life earnings
[1:13:39] it was a Babylonian garment once given
[1:13:42] his payment
[1:13:43] 200 shekels of silver
[1:13:47] and one wedge of gold
[1:13:50] and she leaves it
[1:13:53] is nothing more to her
[1:13:55] now we're going to change the scene and
[1:13:57] over in the Israelite Camp about this
[1:13:59] same time they're also receiving a
[1:14:01] message
[1:14:03] and it's exact instructions from their
[1:14:05] messenger
[1:14:07] God tells Joshua and Joshua 6 and 2.
[1:14:10] and the Lord said to Joshua see I have
[1:14:13] given Jericho into your hand with its
[1:14:16] king and Mighty Men of Valor
[1:14:21] I have given Jericho into your hand with
[1:14:24] the king and the Mighty Men of Valor
[1:14:26] young people he's already given you the
[1:14:28] victory
[1:14:30] he's already given you the victory all
[1:14:32] the spirits they're already in your hand
[1:14:34] they're already conquered they're King
[1:14:36] already conquered all you have to do is
[1:14:39] follow instructions
[1:14:41] he says I've already done it I've
[1:14:43] already conquered it all you got to do
[1:14:44] is follow the directions it is simple
[1:14:47] except for as human beings it's not
[1:14:54] one of my biggest frustrations as a
[1:14:56] school teacher for years was did you
[1:14:58] read the directions
[1:15:01] like literally it was a sentence how did
[1:15:03] you totally mess this up so bad
[1:15:05] oh I didn't read that
[1:15:08] guys it's been laid out very plain in
[1:15:10] this day more than ever before we have
[1:15:12] no excuse to not know what we're
[1:15:14] supposed to do
[1:15:16] the instructions have been laid out all
[1:15:18] you have to do is follow directions
[1:15:24] he tells them here in this scripture
[1:15:25] Victory is already yours
[1:15:27] just listen to the message
[1:15:29] act on the message do what you're told
[1:15:31] to do follow the instructions and take
[1:15:34] those instructions and put them into
[1:15:35] action
[1:15:38] and so he's told that you already get
[1:15:40] this and
[1:15:42] I can't I don't want to leave this right
[1:15:43] now just because I I know who I'm
[1:15:45] dealing with
[1:15:46] Young Folks especially some some older
[1:15:50] folks too I get it I get it
[1:15:52] we want everything to make sense
[1:15:57] we want it all to be able to add up and
[1:15:58] well what about this and what about that
[1:16:00] well why do I have to do this
[1:16:03] why did Brother Branham say we have to
[1:16:05] do this
[1:16:08] why listen I don't know why I'm telling
[1:16:10] you the battle plan is if you'll just
[1:16:12] follow the directions you're going to
[1:16:14] win
[1:16:15] if you'll just do what the messenger
[1:16:17] told you to do you're going to overcome
[1:16:18] the stronghold in your life is going to
[1:16:21] fall but you got to follow the
[1:16:23] directions you got to do what the
[1:16:25] messenger told you to do oh well this
[1:16:27] doesn't make sense and that doesn't make
[1:16:29] sense and maybe that was just brother
[1:16:30] branham's opinion
[1:16:32] come on now
[1:16:35] that don't make sense how much sense did
[1:16:37] it make to walk around the wall all
[1:16:39] those times silence and then shout and
[1:16:41] the wall is going to fall down it didn't
[1:16:43] matter it wasn't your plan it's his plan
[1:16:46] and he said this is what you're going to
[1:16:48] do to win the Victory and it doesn't
[1:16:50] matter if it all makes sense this is
[1:16:52] what you gotta do to win the victory
[1:16:54] just stick with the instructions just
[1:16:57] follow the plan just hide the message in
[1:17:00] your heart and the walls in your life
[1:17:01] are going to come down
[1:17:08] it didn't matter if it made sense it was
[1:17:10] his plan
[1:17:11] it was his victory
[1:17:13] and he's teaching them that my way
[1:17:16] is the only way you're going to have
[1:17:18] victory
[1:17:19] my way is the best way
[1:17:22] listen you're not going to take a
[1:17:23] Rapture doing it your way
[1:17:26] you are not going to take a body change
[1:17:28] doing it your way
[1:17:30] but I have a promise that if we do it
[1:17:31] his way he ain't going to leave us here
[1:17:33] if we'll do it his way there is going to
[1:17:35] be a Rapture and there is going to be
[1:17:37] young people in that Rapture it ain't
[1:17:38] just for Mama and Daddy it ain't just
[1:17:40] preachers and song leaders and deacons
[1:17:42] there's going to be 12 year olds in the
[1:17:44] Rapture 15 16 17. it doesn't matter what
[1:17:47] your age is tonight he's calling you
[1:17:49] saying just follow the instructions I'm
[1:17:51] coming it's getting closer don't be
[1:17:53] nervous there's a scarlet cord you don't
[1:17:55] got to be shook up like the rest of the
[1:17:57] world the walls ain't gonna Crush you
[1:17:59] but you're gonna walk out over these
[1:18:01] walls delivered set free Hallelujah he's
[1:18:04] not leaving us behind but you just gotta
[1:18:07] follow the instructions a message has
[1:18:10] been sent for your deliverance
[1:18:14] it's got to be his way
[1:18:17] we can't try to make everything make
[1:18:19] sense
[1:18:20] he said you got to have the token
[1:18:24] you got to have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:26] and there is a prescription on how to
[1:18:28] get that he said repent be baptized
[1:18:30] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:18:32] Christ and you shall receive
[1:18:34] so tonight I'll say it's time we lay
[1:18:36] down what we think I know that's hard
[1:18:37] for us to do but we got to lay down what
[1:18:40] it is we think
[1:18:41] lay down what it is we feel lay it down
[1:18:43] what what we reason about the situation
[1:18:46] lay those things aside tonight and
[1:18:48] follow the instructions of the word
[1:18:52] Joshua 6.
[1:18:56] the instructions are laid out
[1:18:58] and the plan is carried out
[1:19:01] and just before they shout there are
[1:19:03] final instructions
[1:19:05] Joshua 6 17.
[1:19:08] and the city shall be accursed even it
[1:19:11] and all that are therein to the Lord
[1:19:15] only Rahab the Harlot shall live
[1:19:18] she and all that are within her house
[1:19:21] because she hid The Messengers that we
[1:19:24] sent
[1:19:25] but you keep yourself from the things
[1:19:29] devoted to destruction
[1:19:32] young people we spend way too much time
[1:19:34] trying to gather up things that are
[1:19:35] going to be destroyed
[1:19:38] he says keep yourself from the things
[1:19:40] devoted to destruction lest when you
[1:19:43] have devoted them you take a take any of
[1:19:45] the devoted things and make the camp of
[1:19:47] Israel a thing for Destruction and bring
[1:19:49] trouble upon it
[1:19:51] but all silver and gold and every vessel
[1:19:54] of bronze and iron are holy to the Lord
[1:19:55] and they shall go into the treasury
[1:19:59] of the Lord
[1:20:01] hearing this message there
[1:20:04] there was a man of the house of
[1:20:08] what a lineage
[1:20:11] it would eventually lead on down to
[1:20:13] Jesse
[1:20:14] lead on down to David
[1:20:16] and of course our lord Jesus
[1:20:19] this Man's family had lived in Egypt his
[1:20:22] great-grandfather's name was Sarah
[1:20:25] his grandfather's name was zabdi
[1:20:28] his father's name was Carmen
[1:20:32] they had witnessed the rise of Moses and
[1:20:35] Aaron combined they had been in the land
[1:20:37] of Egypt many many years his
[1:20:39] great-grandfather and his grandfather
[1:20:40] and his father they had come up and they
[1:20:42] had seen the rise of Moses and Aaron
[1:20:44] they had seen the plagues they had seen
[1:20:46] the Flies they had seen the frogs they
[1:20:48] had seen the lice and the locusts
[1:20:51] they had been there the night the death
[1:20:52] angel moved through the land
[1:20:54] think about this
[1:20:58] he had seen the hand of God as he
[1:21:00] journeyed through the wilderness
[1:21:04] it's possible that he had at some point
[1:21:06] as a kid maybe even been bit by a
[1:21:07] serpent in the wilderness and looked on
[1:21:09] the brass serpent in order to live
[1:21:12] he had just come through the River
[1:21:13] Jordan and seen it completely rolled
[1:21:15] back
[1:21:16] seen it dry up and then flow again as
[1:21:18] Israel crossed into the land
[1:21:20] and now this man stands on the front
[1:21:22] lines
[1:21:25] he's ready to attack Jericho
[1:21:28] he's ready for the Revival
[1:21:30] he's ready for this victory
[1:21:35] he knew that in just a moment Jericho
[1:21:37] was going to be a mountain of rocks
[1:21:38] brother Joe
[1:21:39] and he knows that he was destined to
[1:21:41] stand on top of those
[1:21:43] he was destined to be victorious he was
[1:21:46] raised in the message
[1:21:48] he had been to all the camp meetings
[1:21:51] he had seen Devils cast out he had seen
[1:21:54] people healed he had heard the
[1:21:56] testimonies he had felt the presence of
[1:21:57] God he knew who he was
[1:22:00] he was ready
[1:22:03] they had marched through the Wilderness
[1:22:05] all these years and now the promised
[1:22:07] land lays right in front of them
[1:22:10] he was filled with the excitement that
[1:22:12] you might would feel when
[1:22:14] right before a Revival or right before a
[1:22:16] youth camp
[1:22:18] when you can feel victory in the air
[1:22:21] how many of y'all have been to
[1:22:23] Louisiana youth camper South Carolina or
[1:22:25] Ohio or any of those camps and certain
[1:22:28] Services you're sitting there and you
[1:22:29] just feel it
[1:22:30] you just know
[1:22:32] things are about to happen
[1:22:34] now this is where he stands he can feel
[1:22:37] it
[1:22:37] even more than that maybe the excitement
[1:22:40] of knowing that we're about to cross
[1:22:41] over into the promised land because the
[1:22:43] body changes here you can feel it
[1:22:46] there's a rapture
[1:22:48] and he's standing there on the front
[1:22:49] lines and he's feeling these things and
[1:22:51] he says within himself I'm ready
[1:22:53] I'm ready
[1:22:55] and just then it was time for the shout
[1:23:00] and Aiken lifted up his voice with all
[1:23:02] the others and began to shout
[1:23:06] and Aiken shouts for joy as the walls
[1:23:09] come down
[1:23:10] Aiken loved this revival
[1:23:13] Aiken was a part of this revival
[1:23:17] he shouted with them and the walls come
[1:23:20] tumbling down
[1:23:22] Joshua 6 21 says and they utterly
[1:23:24] destroyed all that was in the city both
[1:23:26] man and woman young and old and oxen
[1:23:28] sheep and ass with the edge of the sword
[1:23:31] but Joshua had said unto two men that
[1:23:33] had spotted out the country going to the
[1:23:34] harlot's house and bring out Vince the
[1:23:36] woman in all that she hath as she swear
[1:23:38] as you swear unto her and the young man
[1:23:40] that were spies went in and brought out
[1:23:42] Rahab and her father and her mother and
[1:23:44] her Brethren and all that she had and
[1:23:46] they brought out all her Kindred and
[1:23:48] left them without the camp of Israel
[1:23:50] and they burnt the city with fire and
[1:23:53] all that was therein only the silver and
[1:23:55] the gold and the vessels of brass and of
[1:23:57] iron they put into the treasury of the
[1:23:59] house of the Lord I want you to notice
[1:24:01] that the promise
[1:24:03] of the token held
[1:24:06] they went in and they kept their word
[1:24:08] and sometimes the Devil comes with fear
[1:24:11] and anxiety I want you to know that this
[1:24:13] God's going to keep his word
[1:24:15] he's not going to leave you behind
[1:24:16] you're not going to be destroyed here
[1:24:18] you're not going to be crushed here
[1:24:20] but they go in and they get them all out
[1:24:21] and they take them without
[1:24:24] and Aiken charges the walls I want you
[1:24:26] to picture it for a moment
[1:24:27] I mean this was a giant City and the
[1:24:29] walls fall and there's smoke and there's
[1:24:31] debris and there's sounds of war and
[1:24:33] he's charging and they're shouting
[1:24:34] there's fighting going on this is a
[1:24:37] battle and and you can see the battle
[1:24:39] rage and the smells of Wars all around
[1:24:42] him and he's part of Victory Aiken is
[1:24:44] partaking in the victory
[1:24:46] he is dancing in the aisles at the camp
[1:24:53] come on now
[1:24:55] he's partaking in this Victory and
[1:24:59] he walks into a home that was right on
[1:25:01] the wall
[1:25:02] still standing
[1:25:04] and he had just witnessed two of his
[1:25:05] brothers escort the family out naked
[1:25:07] walks in and he walks into this home and
[1:25:09] he finds himself
[1:25:11] all alone
[1:25:14] young people we do things the way we do
[1:25:16] things for a reason
[1:25:19] that's why we don't pair up boy and
[1:25:20] girls we're dating and go off by herself
[1:25:22] all along
[1:25:25] we don't put computers in little
[1:25:26] isolated nooks and crannies in our house
[1:25:28] where you can get on them all alone
[1:25:30] we don't go off with our worldly
[1:25:32] acquaintances or school friends all
[1:25:34] along come on now
[1:25:35] he finds himself
[1:25:38] all along
[1:25:40] separated from his brothers during the
[1:25:42] battle and he begins looking here
[1:25:45] he begins looking there just curious
[1:25:47] just wondering wonder what's in this
[1:25:49] house
[1:25:51] you know how it is when you're just
[1:25:52] looking around the internet you're not
[1:25:53] really doing nothing you're just you're
[1:25:55] just looking just looking in this window
[1:25:57] and opening that window and I can't help
[1:25:58] what pops up
[1:26:02] come on
[1:26:04] oh he's just he's just curious he's not
[1:26:06] doing anything he's just flipping
[1:26:08] through stations on the radio do y'all
[1:26:09] still use the radio I don't even know
[1:26:12] he's just flipping through stations
[1:26:14] scrolling through looking at this
[1:26:16] looking at that but not really doing
[1:26:18] anything wrong but in his heart
[1:26:21] he was coveting something
[1:26:25] in your heart when you're doing those
[1:26:26] things you're coveting something that's
[1:26:28] cursed
[1:26:31] and he's just flipping he's just going
[1:26:33] through
[1:26:34] and then all of a sudden you open up
[1:26:36] that window you're actually looking to
[1:26:37] open all along
[1:26:40] then you hit that song your ears were
[1:26:42] wanting to hear all along
[1:26:46] and I've dealt with this at home let's
[1:26:47] just be honest for a minute
[1:26:49] these days you don't have to go look for
[1:26:53] nothing
[1:26:55] how many of you have ever watched a reel
[1:26:59] this guy jokes don't lie
[1:27:03] how many of you watch a lot of reels
[1:27:11] just a little clip I mean it's just a
[1:27:12] little clip
[1:27:14] most of those clips ain't set to Amazing
[1:27:16] Grace brother Joe
[1:27:20] come on now
[1:27:25] I've had to deal with it with young
[1:27:26] people even when I hear them just say a
[1:27:28] few lyrics from something I'll say
[1:27:29] where'd you hear that it was just a clip
[1:27:31] I say would you like to know what the
[1:27:33] next line says
[1:27:35] would you like to know what you're
[1:27:37] identifying yourself with
[1:27:40] would you like to know that that links
[1:27:42] you to Jericho
[1:27:47] come on we're just being real tonight
[1:27:55] Aiken opens up that cabinet they had
[1:27:58] hoped to find all along and and they're
[1:28:00] in that moment all along he can't
[1:28:01] withstand and he takes to himself what
[1:28:03] God has cursed
[1:28:05] and he finds a Babylonian garment
[1:28:08] 200 shekels of silver and a wedge of
[1:28:10] gold
[1:28:12] and being right on the wall it was easy
[1:28:14] for him to sneak out and return to the
[1:28:15] camp and hide this in his tent
[1:28:18] and Aiken hides it in his home
[1:28:21] same battle
[1:28:23] Jericho
[1:28:26] same battle
[1:28:28] Rahab and Aiken
[1:28:30] one from a cursed race seemingly
[1:28:33] destined to die under a pile of rubble
[1:28:36] one from the tribe of Judah
[1:28:39] seemingly destined to do it to be a man
[1:28:41] of renown
[1:28:43] destined to have his name written in the
[1:28:46] Bible as a mighty conqueror someone who
[1:28:48] fought at Jericho and and helped conquer
[1:28:50] the Promised Land
[1:28:51] come from two totally different
[1:28:53] directions
[1:28:54] and they both received a message
[1:28:58] it matters what you do with the message
[1:29:05] you can't just play around with it and
[1:29:07] think well this part really doesn't
[1:29:09] matter
[1:29:10] well that's just brother Donny's opinion
[1:29:13] on the subject
[1:29:14] well I don't know listen I know we've
[1:29:16] dealt with this for a little bit but I
[1:29:17] want you to understand let's just
[1:29:18] eliminate it right now if God thought
[1:29:20] enough to write it down in his Bible or
[1:29:22] take up space and have the prophet of
[1:29:25] God in his limited amount of time on
[1:29:26] this Earth speak about it it matters
[1:29:28] there we settle the discussion if it's
[1:29:30] in the word it matters
[1:29:32] if it comes over the pulpit from your
[1:29:34] pastor it matters because the point of
[1:29:36] it is to get you outside the walls is to
[1:29:39] get you outside Jericho it may not seem
[1:29:41] like a big deal but when the rocks are
[1:29:43] falling and the walls are coming down
[1:29:45] you're going to say thank you Lord for
[1:29:47] the instructions thank you Lord for the
[1:29:49] message thank you for a Godly Pastor
[1:29:51] thank you for a church that stood for
[1:29:53] truth even though it didn't seem like
[1:29:55] those little things mattered
[1:30:05] thank you
[1:30:12] Judah
[1:30:14] think about it
[1:30:15] it doesn't matter what church you go to
[1:30:17] I know where most of you tonight are
[1:30:19] from right here and forgive me if I
[1:30:21] accidentally call it happy valley Word
[1:30:23] of Life
[1:30:24] most of you from here there's a few
[1:30:26] visitors here it doesn't matter where
[1:30:28] you come from
[1:30:29] it doesn't it doesn't matter who your
[1:30:31] daddy is and who your pastor is and it
[1:30:33] doesn't matter how many Church camps
[1:30:34] you've been in how many mighty things
[1:30:35] you felt how many times you felt the
[1:30:37] spirit move upon your flesh
[1:30:40] how many victories You've Won
[1:30:43] all that matter is when it all comes
[1:30:45] down to it is the token on display
[1:30:48] did you do what you were told to do
[1:30:50] did you get the token in place when the
[1:30:53] time comes will there be any cursed
[1:30:55] treasure found in your heart
[1:30:59] for God says Aiken thought this little
[1:31:02] old wedge it won't make any difference
[1:31:03] the rest of the ladies are cutting their
[1:31:05] hair
[1:31:06] I'll do the same thing it won't make any
[1:31:08] difference but what did it do it never
[1:31:10] brought pleasure to his family it
[1:31:12] brought death to every one of them
[1:31:17] Joshua told him he said keep yourselves
[1:31:20] from the things devoted to destruction
[1:31:24] church we hate to talk this way
[1:31:25] sometimes but the truth is the truth is
[1:31:27] the truth this world and the things of
[1:31:29] this world are devoted to destruction
[1:31:32] and it's getting closer and closer and
[1:31:34] I'll tell you when I was coming up
[1:31:36] you didn't talk to nominal Christian
[1:31:38] people and them speak about the end time
[1:31:40] the way they do now
[1:31:42] they used to be like well we don't know
[1:31:43] when it's going to be it could be 100
[1:31:45] 200 we don't know but now they're saying
[1:31:46] something's going on
[1:31:48] something's happening and I'm telling
[1:31:49] you if they're noticing where are we to
[1:31:51] be
[1:31:52] their notice and you've been told look
[1:31:54] and people are getting scared and
[1:31:55] they're running here and and it kind of
[1:31:57] something to me when message Believers
[1:31:59] are like what do we do look how bad it's
[1:32:01] getting look how bad it's getting and
[1:32:02] I'm like ain't this what we've been
[1:32:04] expecting this whole time why are you
[1:32:06] getting worried when you see things come
[1:32:08] to pass you've been told was going to
[1:32:09] come to pass I've been told look up my
[1:32:12] Redemption draweth now I'm telling you
[1:32:14] don't get scared get in the ark don't
[1:32:16] get scared get the token apart don't get
[1:32:19] scared follow the instructions it's
[1:32:21] gonna be okay little children you're
[1:32:23] gonna be safe you're gonna make it but
[1:32:25] just make sure that token is applied
[1:32:31] you have to run from the things of this
[1:32:33] Earth
[1:32:34] you have to run from it I'm telling you
[1:32:36] it's cursed and the thing is they know
[1:32:38] it's cursed
[1:32:40] I'm gonna take a moment here and tell a
[1:32:42] little story I still got a little bit to
[1:32:43] go so bear with me but I want to tell
[1:32:45] this story I feel like it's pertinent
[1:32:46] because if you're anything like me I
[1:32:48] struggled with music for years as a
[1:32:50] young person I was drawn to it
[1:32:53] I was drawn to it sucked in and and I
[1:32:56] had good friends and
[1:32:59] and those friends had a rock band and
[1:33:01] they were musicians and we'd been raised
[1:33:03] in the church together
[1:33:05] but they became musicians drawn to that
[1:33:06] world and I'm a
[1:33:09] date myself right here but it was in the
[1:33:10] era when what was known as the grunge
[1:33:12] movement had hit real big in the early
[1:33:14] 90s and and that was I was in Middle
[1:33:17] School and as I went through high school
[1:33:18] they got better and better and started
[1:33:20] playing different places and
[1:33:23] and they had this one local place in
[1:33:25] town where they were what you would call
[1:33:26] the house band they played there every
[1:33:28] weekend
[1:33:29] and we thought it was so cool we were so
[1:33:31] stupid but
[1:33:33] we thought it was so cool oh yeah yeah
[1:33:34] and I didn't know how to play music
[1:33:36] still don't so my part was to literally
[1:33:39] sit on the stage
[1:33:41] I was a groupie I guess I don't know
[1:33:45] and uh I'd hang out every weekend well
[1:33:49] there was this big name band that was
[1:33:51] booked to play a big place in Shreveport
[1:33:53] and somehow I don't know how these
[1:33:55] things work the Coliseum had double
[1:33:57] booked
[1:33:58] on the same night they had booked two
[1:34:01] concerts
[1:34:02] and so this band shows up and they're
[1:34:04] like they have no place to play
[1:34:06] so they've driven all the way from
[1:34:07] wherever they came from and they're like
[1:34:09] what are we gonna do they end up
[1:34:10] contacting our friend who owns this
[1:34:12] little facility and says we're going to
[1:34:14] come play your place and of course us
[1:34:15] once again being stupid thought this was
[1:34:18] so cool these are guys are rock stars
[1:34:21] so they come out and we hang out with
[1:34:22] them all day and we think it's such a
[1:34:24] cool thing
[1:34:27] and this building would probably hold
[1:34:28] three four hundred people
[1:34:31] that night there's seven eight hundred
[1:34:33] people in there
[1:34:35] and I try to tell this story in a way to
[1:34:37] not bring any glory to the devil because
[1:34:39] I think you'll understand that that's
[1:34:40] not the point of this
[1:34:42] we're in there man and in our mind we're
[1:34:44] having a good time
[1:34:46] they are playing and we're acting stupid
[1:34:49] and we're in the middle of what they'd
[1:34:50] call Mosh pits and this it was a
[1:34:53] manifestation of Hell on Earth is what
[1:34:54] it was brother Joe maybe and you gotta
[1:34:57] understand I'm a backslid message kid
[1:34:59] I know
[1:35:01] and we're there and they're playing and
[1:35:03] everybody
[1:35:06] song gets over and the dude that I think
[1:35:08] is so cool steps up to the mic bro Joe
[1:35:10] and we're just cheering we're right I'm
[1:35:12] right there
[1:35:15] and he says if you think we're having a
[1:35:18] good time now just wait till we all get
[1:35:20] to hell
[1:35:24] and I'm gonna tell you I went from this
[1:35:26] kid going yeah
[1:35:28] huh
[1:35:35] because I couldn't go that
[1:35:38] but I do want to stop for a minute and
[1:35:39] make a point that if they can get that
[1:35:40] happy and that rejoice and knowing where
[1:35:42] they're going
[1:35:43] young people how dare has come to the
[1:35:45] house of God knowing where we got an
[1:35:46] opportunity to go and sit on our hands
[1:35:49] and not worship the King of Kings and
[1:35:51] the Lord of lords they started jumping
[1:35:53] and shouting and screaming because they
[1:35:55] was going to hell and I'm here tonight
[1:35:57] with a message telling you don't have to
[1:35:58] go to hell you're going to heaven and if
[1:36:01] you think we're having a good time now
[1:36:03] you just wait till you see us over there
[1:36:05] but I'm saying you don't gotta wait you
[1:36:07] don't gotta wait to praise His name you
[1:36:09] don't gotta wait to shout but you get
[1:36:11] that scarlet cord in your life you get
[1:36:13] that token and you know I'm going to
[1:36:15] heaven I'm going in a Rapture I can
[1:36:18] Rejoice there is no cursed treasure in
[1:36:20] my life make sure it's not there young
[1:36:23] people make sure it's not there you hide
[1:36:27] one thing in your heart it's the word of
[1:36:29] God it's the life of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:32] Hallelujah
[1:36:36] they know where they're going
[1:36:40] so do we
[1:36:42] we can rejoice in that
[1:36:46] as we begin to bring this down we find
[1:36:47] in chapter 7 of Joshua
[1:36:51] that Israel not knowing of the sin of
[1:36:53] Aiken goes to Ai and they believe it's
[1:36:54] going to be an easy victory
[1:36:57] and yet they're defeated easily
[1:37:01] and they lose 36 men
[1:37:04] Joshua doesn't understand this isn't
[1:37:06] what's supposed to happen
[1:37:08] why were we not Victorious
[1:37:10] let's deal with some things
[1:37:12] because as long as there's sin in your
[1:37:14] life young people you will not be
[1:37:15] victorious
[1:37:17] as long as there's things hidden there
[1:37:18] you're not going to overcome no matter
[1:37:20] how much you want to overcome
[1:37:22] well how come I can't get rid of this
[1:37:24] Spirit how come I can't overcome this
[1:37:25] this habit how come I can't overcome
[1:37:27] this lust how come I can't be filled
[1:37:29] with the holy spirit because as long as
[1:37:32] there's something ungodly hidden in your
[1:37:34] heart you can pray you can fast you can
[1:37:37] yell and scream you can curse that demon
[1:37:39] and it'll sit there
[1:37:43] brother Brown speaking of a woman he
[1:37:44] says well now what if she's got some
[1:37:46] hidden sin there somewhere you could
[1:37:48] pour a gallon of oil on her anoint her
[1:37:51] as many times jump up and down and
[1:37:52] scream and that devil will lay right
[1:37:54] there
[1:37:55] unconfessed sin you'll never move him no
[1:37:59] sir
[1:38:02] I told you tonight you gotta be honest
[1:38:03] with yourself
[1:38:05] why am I where I'm at why have I not
[1:38:09] progressed
[1:38:10] why am I not deeper in the Lord why am I
[1:38:13] not overcome why am I not filled with
[1:38:14] the Holy Ghost
[1:38:16] what's hidden
[1:38:19] what's lying there what needs to be
[1:38:21] dealt with
[1:38:22] and so they go through the process of
[1:38:24] casting lots and God shows the the tribe
[1:38:27] the family the household all the way
[1:38:29] down until it's discovered what's hidden
[1:38:31] and when it's all said and done it's
[1:38:33] aching
[1:38:34] who has hidden these worldly things in
[1:38:36] his in his life and
[1:38:40] they weren't things
[1:38:42] that he could claim ignorance of
[1:38:45] they were things your pastor preached to
[1:38:47] you about all the time
[1:38:49] they were things the message warned you
[1:38:51] about
[1:38:52] all the time things the Pastor said not
[1:38:55] to do
[1:38:56] things he heard directly from the lips
[1:38:58] of the messenger
[1:39:00] chapter 7 verse 22
[1:39:03] says so Joshua sent Messengers and they
[1:39:05] ran unto the tent and behold it was hid
[1:39:07] in his tent and the silver under it and
[1:39:10] they took out the midst of the tent and
[1:39:12] brought them under Joshua unto all the
[1:39:13] children of Israel and laid them out
[1:39:15] before the Lord in Joshua and all Israel
[1:39:17] with him took Aiken the son of Zara and
[1:39:20] the silver and the Garment and the wedge
[1:39:22] of gold and his sons and his daughters
[1:39:24] and his oxen and his asses and his sheep
[1:39:27] and his tent and all that he had and
[1:39:29] they brought them into the valley of
[1:39:30] acor
[1:39:31] and Joshua said why hast thou troubled
[1:39:33] us the Lord shall trouble thee this day
[1:39:36] and all Israel stoned him with stones
[1:39:38] and burned them with fire and aft after
[1:39:42] they had stoned them with stones
[1:39:44] and they raised over him a great heap of
[1:39:47] stones unto this day
[1:39:48] so the Lord turned from the fierceness
[1:39:50] of his anger wherefore the name of the
[1:39:52] place was called the valley of acor Unto
[1:39:54] this day
[1:39:57] young people when you disobeyed the word
[1:39:59] of the Lord
[1:40:00] death lies at the door
[1:40:03] and one thing I want us to notice
[1:40:04] tonight you're not going to spend much
[1:40:05] time on as we're running out of time but
[1:40:07] your actions affect more than you
[1:40:11] his Disobedience brought the death of
[1:40:13] his entire family
[1:40:15] think about it in your friend groups are
[1:40:17] you bringing people in is your life and
[1:40:19] your testimony and your music and the
[1:40:21] things you're feeding on drawing people
[1:40:23] in
[1:40:24] are you getting them under the token or
[1:40:27] are you the reason they're in the
[1:40:28] streets when the walls fall
[1:40:31] it matters the decisions you make it
[1:40:34] affects those around you
[1:40:39] chapter 6 verse 23. and the young man
[1:40:42] that were spies went in I know we've
[1:40:44] read this but I just want to reinforce
[1:40:45] this as we come home
[1:40:47] and brought out Rahab
[1:40:50] and her father
[1:40:52] and her mother
[1:40:54] and her brethren in all that she had and
[1:40:57] they brought out all her Kindred and
[1:41:00] left them without the camp how many of
[1:41:02] you have loved ones you'd like to see
[1:41:03] saved
[1:41:04] how many of you have friends you'd like
[1:41:06] to see saved by her testimony by her
[1:41:09] following the message by her putting it
[1:41:11] in action how many times does our life
[1:41:14] drive people away from the message oh if
[1:41:16] that's what the message produces then I
[1:41:17] don't want anything to do with it come
[1:41:19] on now but her life brought people into
[1:41:21] and saved him because of her testimony
[1:41:24] because she did what she was told to do
[1:41:26] do not underestimate the power of your
[1:41:28] influence or nobody looks to me that's
[1:41:31] not true
[1:41:32] a lot of eyes are upon you
[1:41:38] let me move down some
[1:41:43] friends
[1:41:47] who make so many decisions based off of
[1:41:48] what friends might think
[1:41:50] how they're going to react how they're
[1:41:51] going to look at us but I want you to
[1:41:52] know if you were to ever stand before
[1:41:54] the judgment
[1:41:55] you're not going to stand there with
[1:41:56] your boyfriend
[1:41:59] you're not going to stand there with
[1:42:00] your girlfriend or your little group of
[1:42:01] buddies
[1:42:03] you're going to stand there and answer
[1:42:05] for your actions
[1:42:07] and your excuses won't matter
[1:42:09] you're going to answer to God for what
[1:42:12] you hid
[1:42:14] what was hidden
[1:42:17] what was hidden
[1:42:19] what did you hide in your heart
[1:42:21] you know I find it so sad that Aiken
[1:42:23] owed his very life to the fact that his
[1:42:25] great-grandfather and his grandfather
[1:42:27] and his father had obeyed the word of
[1:42:29] the Lord
[1:42:30] they had put Blood on the doorpost
[1:42:31] that's why Aiken was here
[1:42:34] they had done these things they had
[1:42:36] looked to the serpent they had gathered
[1:42:38] up the Manna they had they had marched
[1:42:40] they had done what they were told to do
[1:42:41] and yet his entire family now perishes
[1:42:44] because of his
[1:42:46] Disobedience to the word
[1:42:49] now listen this is in no way a sermon
[1:42:52] about dating and marriage but I can't go
[1:42:54] past here without saying this do not
[1:42:56] yoke yourself with someone who is not
[1:42:58] completely sold out 100 and filled with
[1:43:00] the Holy Ghost
[1:43:05] because don't think for a minute that
[1:43:06] the decisions and the way they lead your
[1:43:08] home isn't going to lead you and your
[1:43:09] family a certain direction
[1:43:12] due to the best of your ability you pray
[1:43:15] and you seek God and you know that you
[1:43:17] know is all that you can that this
[1:43:20] person is dedicated this person is sold
[1:43:22] out hey I don't care how ugly they are
[1:43:25] how good they look you better make sure
[1:43:27] they're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:29] oh I know we're young people ain't none
[1:43:31] of us going to marry somebody ugly
[1:43:37] well you better not think that at least
[1:43:42] you better love them because of the
[1:43:44] character that's there and you see a
[1:43:45] real Godly desire to serve the Lord and
[1:43:48] you know you can serve the Lord together
[1:43:49] she don't end up in a situation like
[1:43:51] Aiken and his and his family ended up in
[1:43:55] Aiken received a message just like Rahab
[1:43:58] did but what she was willing to leave
[1:44:01] behind as we drive this home what she
[1:44:04] was willing to leave behind
[1:44:06] he wanted to put in his tent
[1:44:11] isn't that how it is today you
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:18] they come to the house of God and they
[1:44:20] get freedom from those things and you
[1:44:21] see other people walking out the house
[1:44:23] of God to go pick up the very things
[1:44:26] that those people were willing to lay
[1:44:27] down
[1:44:28] the things they were willing to lay down
[1:44:30] you leave it all behind and you say I'm
[1:44:32] done with it it's death to me and you
[1:44:34] flee from the world and it's cursed
[1:44:36] treasures and you watch others go the
[1:44:38] opposite direction they'll leave homes
[1:44:40] of safety
[1:44:41] they'll leave homes where they've been
[1:44:43] LED in prayer they'll leave homes where
[1:44:45] they've had the message taught to them
[1:44:46] the Bible read to them and they'll go
[1:44:48] right out there and pick up those things
[1:44:50] the instruments of death that others
[1:44:52] were willing to lay down
[1:44:55] they go pick them up
[1:44:57] they bring it into their homes and they
[1:44:59] bring it in to their lives
[1:45:02] or what about you God moves in a mighty
[1:45:04] meeting
[1:45:05] he's moving through the congregation
[1:45:06] we've already hit this and this this
[1:45:08] one's getting delivered and you see it
[1:45:09] this was delivered and you see it you
[1:45:11] feel the power of God you even end up
[1:45:13] there there at an altar and you end up
[1:45:15] at this place and and the battle is
[1:45:17] Raging and you know there's victories
[1:45:18] run the Shadow the king is in the camp
[1:45:20] and yet somehow you leave that service
[1:45:22] undelivered
[1:45:25] you leave there with the same stuff you
[1:45:27] walked in how do we let that happen
[1:45:32] you have an opportunity tonight
[1:45:35] you have an opportunity to make sure
[1:45:37] there's no cursed treasure found
[1:45:38] anywhere in you
[1:45:40] because you cannot have victory
[1:45:43] and curse treasure too
[1:45:45] we found that at AI you cannot have
[1:45:48] victory and cursed treasure
[1:45:51] you need to take all the things of this
[1:45:53] world tonight
[1:45:54] their music their movies Their Stars
[1:45:57] their ideas your ideas about what
[1:45:59] matters and what doesn't matter you need
[1:46:01] to lay it on the altar of God and you
[1:46:03] need to invite the Holy Spirit to come
[1:46:05] burn those things out of your life
[1:46:07] burn those desires burn those wants burn
[1:46:09] those thoughts burn those ideas lay it
[1:46:11] there and let the fire of God consume it
[1:46:13] because I'm telling you it's going to be
[1:46:16] consumed one day along with those who it
[1:46:20] is attached to
[1:46:25] who's going to be burned brother Aaron
[1:46:27] only those that are attached to the
[1:46:29] cursed Treasures
[1:46:32] only those who weren't willing to let it
[1:46:34] down and hide the Lord in their hearts
[1:46:37] Prophet says we've got to stay with that
[1:46:39] word that's the Commandment of God it
[1:46:41] was not to touch nothing in that City
[1:46:43] that cursed City don't touch it leave it
[1:46:46] alone
[1:46:47] young person here we are at the end and
[1:46:49] I'm telling you make sure that there's
[1:46:50] no cursed treasure in your life make
[1:46:52] sure that you're not dabbling with it
[1:46:54] make sure that you're not picking it up
[1:46:55] the stench of the thing will get all
[1:46:57] over your life the stench of it will
[1:46:59] affect those in your home your your
[1:47:01] friends and those near you and it'll
[1:47:03] it'll bring death to you and to your
[1:47:05] family and your loved ones but I'm
[1:47:06] telling you tonight there's an
[1:47:07] opportunity there's a token there's a
[1:47:09] chord and I'm telling you if you'll get
[1:47:11] it displayed there is a promise you will
[1:47:13] not be crushed under the rubble but when
[1:47:15] the walls fall you're going to be
[1:47:17] walking out with the victors you're
[1:47:19] going to be celebrating you're going in
[1:47:21] a Rapture I'm telling you tonight it's
[1:47:22] for you it's not for just others it's
[1:47:24] for you do you have the token do you
[1:47:27] have the scarlet cord or is there cursed
[1:47:30] treasure dragging you down if there is
[1:47:32] run from it tonight run from it with
[1:47:34] your whole heart it's not worth where
[1:47:36] it's going to take you to it's not worth
[1:47:39] it but tonight he's offering Freedom
[1:47:41] he's offering the Holy Ghost he's
[1:47:43] offering a place of repentance and he
[1:47:45] says tonight you can deal with it
[1:47:47] tonight you can lay it down
[1:47:50] Hallelujah
[1:47:54] what Rahab did in hiding those spots was
[1:47:56] a death sentence
[1:47:58] but she knew that if she didn't do it
[1:48:02] death was coming anyway
[1:48:06] I'm telling you death is coming
[1:48:09] but life is offered to you
[1:48:12] Psalms 119 11 Thy Word
[1:48:15] have I hid in my heart
[1:48:17] that I might not sin
[1:48:20] against thee
[1:48:23] back to Joshua 7 25 in our closing
[1:48:26] scripture here
[1:48:28] and once you think about where you're at
[1:48:31] I want you to think about the
[1:48:32] opportunities you have
[1:48:36] and what you think about the opportunity
[1:48:37] you have right now
[1:48:41] I want you to think if the walls fail
[1:48:43] right now
[1:48:47] is there anything that is cursed
[1:48:49] treasure
[1:48:50] in your life
[1:48:53] verse 25 and Joshua said why hast thou
[1:48:55] troubled us
[1:48:57] the Lord shall trouble thee this day
[1:48:59] and all Israel stoned him with stones
[1:49:02] and burned them with fire
[1:49:04] after they had stoned them with stones
[1:49:08] and they raised over him a great heap of
[1:49:11] stones unto this day
[1:49:14] so the Lord turned from the fierceness
[1:49:16] of his anger wherefore the name of that
[1:49:17] place was called the valley of acor Unto
[1:49:19] this day
[1:49:21] look at that
[1:49:22] he was never meant to be underneath that
[1:49:25] pile of stones budget
[1:49:28] he was destined to be on top of the
[1:49:30] rubble
[1:49:31] he had a message that called him not to
[1:49:34] be under the rocks
[1:49:36] and here we see the end of Aiken because
[1:49:38] he just wanted
[1:49:39] what's wrong with that
[1:49:42] what's wrong with it
[1:49:44] my music what's wrong with a little
[1:49:46] makeup
[1:49:47] what's wrong with it what's wrong with
[1:49:48] the with the kiss
[1:49:53] what's wrong is it shows that the
[1:49:55] token's not where it's supposed to be
[1:49:59] it shows that you're still holding on to
[1:50:01] what you want
[1:50:03] and that the token's not applied
[1:50:07] visualize it now
[1:50:11] I see a young woman
[1:50:12] her name's Rahab
[1:50:15] and she walks past this great pile of
[1:50:17] stones
[1:50:19] on her way to AI
[1:50:21] she's new to the camp she knows
[1:50:23] something just happened she's not sure
[1:50:24] what it is
[1:50:27] but if she looks at that she can't help
[1:50:29] but think
[1:50:31] that could have been me and my family
[1:50:32] under there
[1:50:37] That Could Have Been Me
[1:50:39] but a message came
[1:50:42] God sent a message by my way and gave me
[1:50:44] instructions to make sure
[1:50:47] that I didn't end up under there
[1:50:49] that was going to be me and my family
[1:50:52] and she said I'm so thankful I hid those
[1:50:54] spies
[1:50:56] I'm so thankful that I listened to that
[1:50:59] message
[1:51:01] I'm so thankful I listened as brother
[1:51:03] Donny preached Time After Time
[1:51:05] I'm so thankful I took it and applied it
[1:51:08] Could Have Been Me
[1:51:13] what's hidden
[1:51:16] what's hidden in your heart tonight
[1:51:19] you know that she actually traded places
[1:51:23] with Aiken brother Joe Aiken was in the
[1:51:26] tribe of Judah
[1:51:29] and then we find that she
[1:51:32] marry salmon
[1:51:35] in the tribe of Judah and is listed in
[1:51:37] the Book of Matthew in the genealogy of
[1:51:39] Christ in the tribe of Judah
[1:51:43] because they both got the same message
[1:51:48] here he was a message believer
[1:51:52] with every opportunity he was the one
[1:51:56] that was supposed to be in that lineage
[1:51:58] forever he was the one that was supposed
[1:52:00] to take a rapture
[1:52:03] and here she walks past that pile of
[1:52:05] stones
[1:52:07] and now she
[1:52:09] steps into that lineage
[1:52:11] in Christ
[1:52:13] comes down through that lineage
[1:52:18] what's hidden
[1:52:22] will you bow your heads with me for just
[1:52:23] a minute
[1:52:25] what's hidden
[1:52:31] are the things that you've hidden in
[1:52:33] your life going to produce Jesus Christ
[1:52:36] is it going to produce a body change is
[1:52:38] it going to produce a Rapture for you
[1:52:39] and your family
[1:52:43] you got a choice right now what
[1:52:46] will
[1:52:48] I hide
[1:52:52] but maybe right now you need to answer
[1:52:54] what have I hidden
[1:52:57] what's there
[1:52:59] is it the message of the hour tucked
[1:53:01] down deep in your heart
[1:53:03] are you allowing it to change you are
[1:53:05] you allowing it to mold you
[1:53:10] or is there cursed treasure hidden there
[1:53:16] listen today more than ever I can
[1:53:18] Rejoice knowing that I have a loved one
[1:53:19] that stepped across having laid aside
[1:53:21] all the cursed Treasures of this Earth
[1:53:25] and because I know he did that I know
[1:53:27] I'm a seam again
[1:53:31] you can know that you know
[1:53:34] that you know

[1:53:47] search yourself
[1:53:50] allow him to search you right now don't
[1:53:53] leave a door shut

[1:53:58] it don't matter right now examine your
[1:54:00] life

[1:54:56] the devil right now that he's not going
[1:54:58] to hold you and that he's not going to

[1:55:14] completely sold out I want to leave
[1:55:16] everything that I have I want to make
[1:55:18] sure that as the walls begin falling as
[1:55:20] the walls come down all around me that
[1:55:21] there will be nothing found in my heart

[2:09:37] young people
[2:09:41] one thing that I love about the
[2:09:43] testimony of Rahab
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:47] is that when she left Jericho
[2:09:50] there was no one in the camp of Israel
[2:09:52] that knew her story
[2:09:54] there were no accusers
[2:09:56] because there was no one left alive who
[2:09:58] knew her past
[2:10:01] everyone who knew anything about her was
[2:10:05] destroyed
[2:10:07] when you laid these things in the blood
[2:10:09] of Jesus
[2:10:11] it's finished
[2:10:14] where are your accusers
[2:10:17] so don't you keep bringing it up
[2:10:20] quit doing the devil's job for him
[2:10:23] quit digging up your pass and saying but
[2:10:25] I did this but I did this but I did this
[2:10:30] let me leave you with this tonight
[2:10:33] his blood is sufficient
[2:10:37] his blood is sufficient
[2:10:39] the atonement works
[2:10:42] the token will hold
[2:10:46] what's in
[2:10:48] what sin
[2:10:51] where are your accusers
[2:10:54] just lay it down
[2:10:56] and leave it there
[2:10:58] forever
[2:10:59] don't ever pick it up again that's not
[2:11:02] your burden to carry he already carried
[2:11:04] it for you to Calvary

[2:11:15] Victory and another Victory and another
[2:11:17] Victory and another Victory oh but in
[2:11:20] the past this ain't about the past
[2:11:22] we just laid that down
[2:11:24] that's over
[2:11:26] we're going to Victory upon Victory upon
[2:11:29] Victory upon Victory upon Victory and
[2:11:31] it's going to culminate in a body change
[2:11:33] and a Rapture and that's where we're
[2:11:35] going we're not looking back forgetting
[2:11:37] those things that are behind we press
[2:11:39] towards the Mark we press forward what's
[2:11:42] in store for you little people not death
[2:11:44] not under the Rocks but a Rapture of
