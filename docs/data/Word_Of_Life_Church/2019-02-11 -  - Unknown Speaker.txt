TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you cannot hide from God you cannot hide from God you can hide from me you can hide from your pastor you can hide from your wife you could hide things from your husband you could hide things from your children but you can't hide from God God sees everything he knows the intention of your heart for every choice that you make every decision everything that you say in conversation God looks at one thing your heart and God the Bible says he who searches the heart and knows the mind so God knows us inside and out you cannot hide from God the Bible says in Ecclesiastes 8:11 because senate's against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully setting them to do evil another word Solomon says that just because we don't reap what we sow over night doesn't mean that we don't reap what we sow but the Bible says God will not be mocked whatsoever a person shows that person shall also reap but the Bible says because sin it's because that reaping doesn't always happen overnight you can live a life in sin for years thinking you're getting away with it you can live a life in secret sin for 10 years 15 years and think just because judgment has not been passed that somehow we've slipped by or somehow we've gotten by God but understand this you shall reap what you sow you know many times we could pray for children for years and not see anything in wonder if God's here in our prayer and then one day the appointed time comes and that seed that you've been watering for years and years and years comes the harvest we're told of a bamboo seed that the heart the farmer that plants a bamboo seed he has to plant that thing in faith because it's very different than other seeds you see usually a farmer and human nature is to work based upon what we see if we don't see results we give up and so a farmer under normal circumstances plants the seed puts it in the ground and begins to water it he begins to labor for that seed he begins to give it sunlight he begins to nourish it and address it and the next day he comes and maybe there's a sprout up and maybe there's a green leaf and he's told by that sign that my efforts are paying off but the farmer who plants a bamboo seed is very different because although he waters it although he dresses it although he nourishes it for days and I forget how long the process I think it's something like six months he sees absolutely no sign whatsoever that his efforts have done anything at all the only thing he can do is put faith in the process the only thing he could do is put faith in nature knowing that nature will run its course and after six months of just doing the same thing over it's much like when you pray over and over and over and over and you wonder is God ever going to hear my prayer is anything ever gonna change am I ever gonna reap the harvest of what I've been sowing but after six months that tree that bamboo shoot' shoots up six feet tall in just a couple weeks you know this is the way it is with sin for many years we could sow the wrong seed and think that we don't see any result from it so it's okay and something starts so small in our heart your sin will find you out the Bible says in numbers 32:23 if you will not do so behold you have sinned against the Lord and be sure be sure your sin will find you out the Bible paints a very amazing picture of a man who thinks he's sinning and getting away much like a fugitive you know when a fugitive a person commits a sin person commits some heinous act and he goes on the run running from the police running from the government running from the law and that man thinks he can get away with her now boy I really pulled one over I really pulled one over no one's ever gonna know and I got away with it and now I got all this money or whatever the profit was but the part that you don't see is the man his entire life he's always looking behind his shoulder he's always miserable wondering if anybody's gonna find out and eventually that pressure will cause him to make a mistake and the law the whole time is chasing him looking for him watching for him watching they know eventually he'll make a mistake and this is the picture that the Bible paints for a man running from God and your sin literally follows you and haunts you and chases you you may move from church to church you may move from place to place but you can't outrun God you can't outrun the Spirit of God if you're a son of God he'll chase you he'll haunt you he'll bring you to justice and the Bible says the wages of sin what it pays its payment you know what it pays death pleasure for a season thinking that we've gotten away Isaiah 29 15 and 16 woolen - they'll wall unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord and their works are in the dark and they say who sees us and who knoweth us no one's gonna find out this just happened once she'll never know he'll never know I can just cover it up it'll be okay and I'll just move on and the pain that it would cost him for me to confess that would be greater than the reward you know who's talking to you the liar the father of lies are you here this morning woe unto them now listen job 34 21 says for his whose God's his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his goings there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves human beings think they can hide from God and eventually this secret sin begins to drive us from the presence of God the first thing that Adam and Eve do after the Fallen nature comes in after that after the fall happens one of the first attributes is to hide to cover up to make a religion to ease the conscience to cover themselves and the first thing that a person a Christian will do after living a life of sin that no one knows about they'll begin to hide themselves Satan will know you don't know what you don't to know what the devil will do to you he'll push you away from church he'll push you away from fellowship he'll push you away from brothers and sisters you'll become reclusive as is not attributes of God the Bible says in him there is no darkness at all there is only light there is only exposure listen Christians should be the most transparent people on the face of the earth we have nothing to hide we have nothing to run from it is the devil who pushes you into a closet it is the devil who tells you don't confess don't make it right it is the devil who puts fear in your heart to stay under that religious cloak
