[49:08] and have your way we're so grateful for
[49:10] you in Jesus name amen amen if you have
[49:13] your Bibles we turn real quick read two
[49:16] quick
[49:18] scriptures in Revelation
[49:22] 12 we're going to read 9- 11 and then
[49:24] we'll read John 8 7-1
[49:30] 11 John says here the Great Dragon was
[49:33] cast out and the old serpent called the
[49:35] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[49:37] whole world he was cast out unto the
[49:40] earth and the Angels were cast out with
[49:42] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[49:44] heaven now has come salvation and
[49:46] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[49:48] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[49:51] of our Brethren is cast down which
[49:53] accused them before God day and night
[49:56] and they overcame him by the blood of
[49:58] the lamb and by the word of their
[50:01] testimony and they loved not their lives
[50:03] unto death if you can go to John chapter
[50:15] 8 and so when they continued asking him
[50:18] he lifted up himself and said unto them
[50:21] he that is without sin among you let him
[50:25] first cast a stone at her as you
[50:29] familiar with the scripture the
[50:30] Pharisees and the the the real religious
[50:33] people of that day had brought this the
[50:35] woman found in
[50:37] adultery as we read the scripture she's
[50:39] not denying anything she didn't say I
[50:41] wasn't the scripture said she doesn't
[50:43] say she
[50:46] wasn't so then in their in their in
[50:49] their Pious attitude and their
[50:51] self-righteousness they're going to
[50:52] Stone her and Jesus says you he that is
[50:55] with out sin cast the first stone I
[50:58] think that's a big lesson we should all
[51:00] learn this
[51:01] morning he that is without
[51:04] fault he that is without mistakes
[51:07] failures you Stone those around
[51:10] you throw
[51:13] it throw your stone if you are without
[51:15] sin without fault without failures
[51:17] without mistakes start chunking
[51:22] them and again he stooped down and rode
[51:25] on the ground and they which heard it
[51:27] being convicted by their own conscience
[51:29] God did not convict them I want you to
[51:31] understand that God was not in these
[51:33] people their conscience convicted them
[51:37] it went out one by one being in the
[51:39] eldest even until the last and Jesus was
[51:41] left alone in the woman standing in the
[51:44] midst when Jesus lifted up
[51:47] himself and saw no one but the woman
[51:52] Jesus got lower than she
[51:54] was he had to lift himself back up to
[51:57] talk to
[52:00] her
[52:02] woman where are
[52:04] those thine
[52:07] accusers hath no man condemned
[52:11] thee how could she say no man when they
[52:14] had drugg her into the city condemning
[52:16] her how can she say no
[52:19] man she had a revelation of who he
[52:23] was that he could take it away all
[52:27] condemnation she said no man Lord and
[52:29] Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn
[52:32] thee go and sin no more you could be
[52:36] seated I've had this stop for several
[52:39] months now and
[52:42] it's I've titled who are your accusers
[52:45] and now you're going to notice true to
[52:47] the way I am halfway through this I'm
[52:49] going to take a right angle and it's
[52:51] going to look like I'm going totally off
[52:53] of what the subject is and I am
[52:57] but I'll tie it back in so I won't be
[53:01] lost I was studying this last night and
[53:03] I was typing it things were coming and I
[53:05] was just typing it and I got to looking
[53:06] at it and I was like I'm totally way off
[53:08] the thought I was on but it will tie
[53:11] together I promise you that so if you'll
[53:13] bear with me but looking at
[53:15] this in Revelations when when it says
[53:17] they overcome him by the blood of the
[53:19] lamb and by the word of their
[53:22] testimony the word of their testimony is
[53:25] what what you test
[53:27] ify if you walk around testifying that
[53:30] Satan's beating you down he's made me do
[53:33] this I'm doing that I've got this
[53:35] besetting sin in my life and that's your
[53:37] testimony that is your testimony and how
[53:40] you overcome him is is not just you say
[53:43] well I trust in God that you know God's
[53:45] going to take care of you know you've
[53:46] got a job to do you why do you think in
[53:50] in in in the scriptures in Ephesians it
[53:53] tells you what you're armed with you've
[53:55] put on the the the breast of of
[53:57] Salvation and the the helmet in the
[53:59] sword of the of the word and all that
[54:01] and you're armed that means you got to
[54:03] do something yeah so in John tells them
[54:06] they overcome by the word of their
[54:07] testimony so what are the words that are
[54:09] coming out of your
[54:12] mouth when you feel defeated when you
[54:15] make a mistake when you you fall down
[54:17] and you stumble around and you you you
[54:19] get so convicted in your heart you feel
[54:21] condemned at that point what is your
[54:25] testimony yeah come on because when you
[54:28] testify what Satan Satan is doing to you
[54:31] what the enemy is doing to you you're
[54:33] giving him
[54:34] Victory you are not
[54:36] overcoming and and we read the scripture
[54:39] to me when I wrote down beside that when
[54:41] they overcome by the word of their
[54:42] testimony by the blood of the lamb and
[54:44] they love not their lives and I wrote
[54:46] John I mean James 4:7 submit yourself
[54:49] unto God resist the devil and'll flee
[54:51] from you how do you resist him by your
[54:55] testimony yeah
[54:56] yeah and then looking down here where
[55:00] Jesus goes
[55:02] and they all leave he says you know you
[55:06] without sin cast the first stone and it
[55:08] came down to it it was just her and
[55:10] Jesus nobody
[55:12] else that should all be all that matters
[55:15] in your life it shouldn't matter who's
[55:17] accusing you of this who's talking about
[55:19] the mistakes in your life who's saying
[55:21] the things that you've done and
[55:23] spreading it around the church and
[55:24] spreading it around your work the the
[55:26] things that you're that you are how you
[55:28] are whatever you and you worry about
[55:31] these people standing around you with
[55:36] stones they're always going to be
[55:40] there people will stones will always be
[55:43] in your
[55:47] life but she had an attorney that come
[55:50] up to
[55:51] her the attorney this was her courtroom
[55:53] they were condemning her this was a
[55:55] trial
[55:57] in fact they had already reached the
[56:01] Judgment they were getting ready to pull
[56:03] the lever on the electric chair and her
[56:05] attorney walked in and got a stay of
[56:10] execution that's what happened to
[56:13] you when when when Adam fell in the
[56:15] garden you became a
[56:20] prisoner you were lost you were there
[56:23] was no
[56:25] hope believe it or not you say I'm a
[56:27] Child of God always was in the mind of
[56:30] God yes you were but you had to be
[56:32] redeemed to get
[56:33] there you had there had to be a
[56:35] Redemption take place but you got to
[56:37] understand when Adam fell Satan went to
[56:42] work brother brandham said you became
[56:45] his
[56:47] property you became his property he
[56:51] owned
[56:54] you and his job is to continuously
[56:57] accuse you day and night yes
[57:02] sir the word accuser when you read the
[57:04] in this in the the New Testament there
[57:08] the accuser that is the that is the the
[57:11] term that the rabbis the Jewish rabbis
[57:13] of that day gave to Satan was the
[57:18] accuser you couldn't help the way you
[57:20] were born you were born in sin shaped in
[57:23] iniquity came into the world speaking
[57:25] lies yeah you couldn't help the way you
[57:27] were made and and when you're accused of
[57:30] things you you got to look at it and you
[57:31] say yeah I did do
[57:34] that your father before you did that his
[57:37] father before him did that generation
[57:40] after generation if we looked at the
[57:42] flesh if we look at where we were at
[57:44] after the fall we would have to say Not
[57:47] Looking Through The Eyes Of God but we
[57:48] would have to say I did do
[57:51] that I'm forever lost I'm going to the
[57:54] judgment
[57:57] you understand and I got this studying
[58:00] this and
[58:01] because as you know I I teach criminal
[58:03] justice and I like looking at law and we
[58:06] we do a lot of theory stuff I'm not
[58:08] intelligent
[58:10] but I did it for so long I understand
[58:12] some of it and they have what they call
[58:15] a differential association theory does
[58:18] anybody know what that
[58:21] is okay
[58:26] a child will become a criminal because
[58:29] his father was a criminal because his
[58:31] father was a criminal because his father
[58:34] was a
[58:35] criminal if you go to places like
[58:37] Washington Park on south side of
[58:39] Chicago my dad can tell you a bunch
[58:41] about that side of Chicago it's so much
[58:45] worse now than it was then violent crime
[58:48] in in Washington Park is
[58:52] 71% more than the national rate
[58:56] oh cops don't even go in there it's the
[59:00] wrong
[59:02] jungle I saw a video on
[59:05] YouTube about a year or two ago and this
[59:07] person's sitting on another part of town
[59:09] and he's got his camera up and he's
[59:11] pointing it over toward Washington Park
[59:12] in Southside Chicago and it sounds like
[59:14] the 4th of
[59:16] July just gunfire every night gang wars
[59:21] but ever so
[59:23] often somebody makes it out
[59:27] somebody says I I don't want to live
[59:29] like
[59:31] that it's
[59:33] rare but ever so often somebody breaks
[59:37] this
[59:39] Theory Satan tells you you have a
[59:41] differential association
[59:44] theory you'll fall like your father
[59:49] Adam on he wasn't deceived right but
[59:54] you'll fall like he he did look at the
[59:57] mistakes so and so made they were in the
[1:00:01] same situation you'll make them same
[1:00:03] mistakes and he gets over and over in
[1:00:04] your mind that you have this Theory and
[1:00:07] this is what is running running your
[1:00:09] life this is what's moving
[1:00:12] you you know Brother brandom Talks so
[1:00:14] much about how the natural type the
[1:00:17] spiritual you know and I get students
[1:00:20] that come in and my my first day of
[1:00:24] class I walked in there when I took the
[1:00:26] job two years ago over at tat and
[1:00:28] there's this young man sitting there and
[1:00:30] always ask him why do you want to get in
[1:00:31] law enforcement why do you want to do
[1:00:33] corrections and this young man he's
[1:00:35] sitting
[1:00:36] there and he tells me where he lives and
[1:00:39] I'm kind of familiar with the plac it's
[1:00:40] over in Solomon County near Bristol and
[1:00:43] he says I said why do you want to get in
[1:00:45] law
[1:00:46] enforcement he lived in a trailer park
[1:00:48] over there and he said I was so
[1:00:52] used watching cops come in and get my
[1:00:55] mom
[1:00:57] my aunts my
[1:01:00] dad instead of hating the
[1:01:03] cops he said I want to be like
[1:01:07] them his whole family
[1:01:09] generation I had a boy graduated him
[1:01:12] this past last year this past
[1:01:15] spring he's been in he got hired over at
[1:01:19] Carter County um Sheriff's Department
[1:01:21] it's been there about six or eight
[1:01:23] months I've arrested his granddaddy
[1:01:26] chased his dad granddaddy across state
[1:01:29] lines arrested his daddy for car
[1:01:33] theft arrested his mom on numerous his
[1:01:36] mom has been arrested so many
[1:01:39] times this month that young
[1:01:43] man became the top correctional officer
[1:01:46] in the whole state of Tennessee wow
[1:01:49] because he refused differential
[1:01:51] association
[1:01:53] theory I say that to say this to
[1:01:58] you just because you see somebody go
[1:02:01] down a path your family member you see
[1:02:04] this one fall away that one Fall Away
[1:02:08] you don't have to go that way Satan's
[1:02:10] telling you he's accusing you saying
[1:02:12] you're going to go this way you're going
[1:02:14] to do this cuz look at them they tried
[1:02:16] the same thing that you tried and it
[1:02:18] didn't work for
[1:02:21] them just remember he has a job to do
[1:02:26] the Bible says day and night even after
[1:02:30] the blood was shed for you he still the
[1:02:33] accuser of the Brethren he's not the
[1:02:36] accuser of the outcast right on he's
[1:02:40] accuser of the
[1:02:43] Brethren he's accuser and of Sons and
[1:02:46] Daughters of God so if that's
[1:02:49] you except the fact that he's got a job
[1:02:52] to do he's going to be accusing you
[1:02:54] that's his job yes it's not going to
[1:02:58] change until you take a Rapture until
[1:03:01] he's chained for a thousand years that
[1:03:03] job of his is not going to
[1:03:07] change yours
[1:03:09] can by the word of your testimony amen
[1:03:12] you don't have to say you know what he's
[1:03:14] right because so and so did this and
[1:03:16] I've tried it this way I've been
[1:03:17] fighting this thing for four years for
[1:03:20] for for 10 years this besetting sin in
[1:03:23] my life I can't get over it I can't I
[1:03:26] can't I can't I used to tell my boys I
[1:03:29] don't want to ever hear that come out of
[1:03:30] your mouth I
[1:03:32] can't I was at the police academy we got
[1:03:34] an obstacle course and the very last
[1:03:36] thing is the 8 foot

[1:03:50] there for you get your foot and go
[1:03:53] over and he just grabbed the top and
[1:03:57] just feebly tried to pull himself

[1:04:05] you get over the
[1:04:06] wall yes brother Rob I think I could
[1:04:09] have got over the wall I know what
[1:04:10] you're
[1:04:14] thinking I did get over the wall but I

[1:04:17] younger but he kept trying and trying
[1:04:19] and finally he come around he goes I

[1:04:33] wall guess what he
[1:04:36] did he got all over the wall yes and I

[1:04:46] this whole obstacle course if you ever
[1:04:48] say I can't again you can do more than
[1:04:51] you realize what you can do you're
[1:04:52] listening to things up here in your mind
[1:04:55] say that you
[1:05:02] can't and studying this it it just came
[1:05:06] to me you know the the things that we
[1:05:08] get we we've heard for years you know
[1:05:10] the bride's going through a judgment now
[1:05:12] we're not going through the great white
[1:05:13] Throne judgment because because we're
[1:05:15] being judged
[1:05:17] now you've already been
[1:05:22] judged God cannot pardon you write your
[1:05:25] name in the Lamb's Book of Life until
[1:05:27] you've been properly judged
[1:05:30] yeah am you think you get up in the
[1:05:33] morning God says okay I'm going to watch
[1:05:34] him today make sure he don't make no
[1:05:36] mistakes I'm watching him I'm judging
[1:05:38] him right now when that blood was shed
[1:05:40] your case was over yes your court case
[1:05:43] was over when the blood was shed he
[1:05:45] wrote his name brother brandom said his
[1:05:47] name in blood on your
[1:05:50] pardon that's right you've already been
[1:05:53] judged in fact you've already been given
[1:05:55] eternal life
[1:05:57] amen thank you Lord amen if you want to
[1:06:00] keep living under the
[1:06:04] law that's up to you but God gave
[1:06:08] Grace we're going to we're going to look
[1:06:10] at that here in a minute but you you've
[1:06:11] already been judged yes the the word you
[1:06:14] you know the the word is sharper than a
[1:06:16] two-edged sword and there's things in
[1:06:18] our hearts in our lives you know when
[1:06:19] brother brandom said you know when he
[1:06:21] went behind that door when God pulled
[1:06:22] him behind that door in that Diner when
[1:06:24] he was accusing that um that woman and
[1:06:27] that police officer just you know
[1:06:29] judging
[1:06:31] them and he comes in behind that door
[1:06:33] and he shows him Jesus up there and is
[1:06:36] hitting him Jesus being a buffer for him
[1:06:40] he says are those the sins of the world
[1:06:41] and he said no those are yours but God
[1:06:43] never saw him because God Jesus stood
[1:06:46] between him and
[1:06:47] God that's what the blood was
[1:06:51] for
[1:06:52] right brother brandham said after the
[1:06:55] blood you've accepted the blood your
[1:06:57] sins going into the blood says you've
[1:06:58] never done it God looks at you perfect
[1:07:01] white and clean
[1:07:03] amen let's move on here brother brandom
[1:07:07] said in the future home of the Heavenly
[1:07:08] bridegroom and the Earthly bride both
[1:07:10] the heavens and earth now is
[1:07:11] contaminated with Devils that can accuse
[1:07:13] us before God Jesus is there to
[1:07:16] intercede for us while the accusers keep
[1:07:18] pointing a finger they did this they did
[1:07:21] this they did this but the blood still
[1:07:22] covers he came to redeem that elected
[1:07:25] that he he foresaw that's why it's so
[1:07:27] filthy today in the fourth
[1:07:29] seal as long as the intercessor is still
[1:07:32] on the throne Satan can stand there and
[1:07:36] accuse because he is the attorney for
[1:07:38] the other
[1:07:40] side he's the district attorney he's the
[1:07:43] prosecuting attorney he's the one that
[1:07:44] brings charges to
[1:07:49] you he said Christ he is the opponent of
[1:07:52] Christ he's standing there the opponent
[1:07:55] is stand there saying but wait Adam fell
[1:07:57] Adam done this I conquered him I got his
[1:07:59] wife to believe a lie and you said she
[1:08:01] would be damned by it I got
[1:08:03] it Satan's already doing his Victory lap
[1:08:07] saying I've already won I I made him
[1:08:10] fall I deceived his wife I made Adam
[1:08:13] fall now everything belongs to me so
[1:08:15] he's already thinking he's already won
[1:08:16] the
[1:08:17] case but there's a mediator standing
[1:08:20] there amen the kingsman kinsman redeemer
[1:08:23] stand there with the blood that can take
[1:08:25] the vile a sinner heart and change it
[1:08:27] the mediator is on the throne yes sir
[1:08:29] Satan said but they're guilty he could
[1:08:31] say they're
[1:08:32] not When God says you're not guilty the
[1:08:35] case is over a judge you ever heard of
[1:08:38] Double Jeopardy you cannot be tried for
[1:08:40] a crime that you've already been been
[1:08:43] tried with before in court you can't say
[1:08:46] we found new evidence if the judge says
[1:08:48] you're not guilty dismisses the case
[1:08:51] they can bring all the evidence they
[1:08:52] want it's double jeopardy you don't ask
[1:08:54] believe me ask brother the
[1:08:57] Matthew you can't you might even find
[1:09:00] video evidence you've ever been you've
[1:09:03] already been found not guilty
[1:09:08] right so what I've been building up to
[1:09:12] now is kind of putting you in a
[1:09:17] courtroom you know what we got to
[1:09:20] understand and this is something they
[1:09:22] stress nowadays and you hear it all the
[1:09:24] time is our
[1:09:26] rights we have rights the bride has
[1:09:30] rights American citizens have
[1:09:32] rights undocumented illegals have rights
[1:09:37] transgenders have rights homosexuals
[1:09:39] have rights everybody has rights yeah I
[1:09:42] think the bugs have rights everybody has
[1:09:47] rights but we
[1:09:49] we we hear the preaching so long we've
[1:09:51] been hear hear the the series that
[1:09:53] brother Donnie's been doing on the bride
[1:09:55] rights and I think it's so wonderful and
[1:09:57] and you if you look at the way he's
[1:10:00] preaching the rights you go read the the
[1:10:02] Bill of Rights and the Amendments all
[1:10:04] the way up the 27 Amendments and you
[1:10:05] start looking at that and realize how
[1:10:08] much parallels with the rights that he's
[1:10:10] been preaching to you and your rights as
[1:10:12] American CI you got people nowadays more
[1:10:14] concerned about their their rights as
[1:10:16] American citizen than they are about uh
[1:10:19] their rights as a
[1:10:21] bride this your rights as a bride should
[1:10:23] be more important to you than your
[1:10:24] constit tional
[1:10:28] rights I'm not saying that you won't
[1:10:30] that you can violate somebody else's
[1:10:32] rights but you have these rights that
[1:10:35] God gave you that Satan tries to violate
[1:10:37] day in and day out and sometimes I think
[1:10:39] we fail to understand what our rights
[1:10:42] are brother Bram said if we'd
[1:10:45] stayed where our forefathers planted the
[1:10:47] foundation we'd have built upon the
[1:10:48] principles of the Bible yes handwriting
[1:10:50] on the
[1:10:52] wall forefathers talking about George
[1:10:55] Washington James Madison and all
[1:10:58] those if we'd have built if we'd have
[1:11:01] stayed there we'd have built upon the
[1:11:02] principles of the
[1:11:04] Bible so we're going to look at some
[1:11:06] things
[1:11:06] today brother brother Bram says tested
[1:11:09] Faith produces goods in 58 here's where
[1:11:13] our forefathers landed for this freedom
[1:11:15] of religion on Plymouth Rock it is from
[1:11:18] these sacred Souls here that praying men
[1:11:20] and women went forth to establish this
[1:11:23] great spiritual economy that we are PR
[1:11:25] to serve
[1:11:26] today no American should be ashamed of
[1:11:29] their forefathers who landed in this
[1:11:32] country went to church packing
[1:11:34] guns who came here for freedom of
[1:11:37] religion went on Horseback covered in
[1:11:39] Old wagons fought the Indians and so
[1:11:41] forth to get to go to church those
[1:11:43] Bloods bathed this soil if we'll be
[1:11:45] sincere and believe in God that they
[1:11:47] believed in and serve him with the same
[1:11:49] reverence they served him with we'll see
[1:11:51] a Revival again yeah and I believe it
[1:11:54] will start in New England God's willing
[1:11:56] to do it if we'll carry it out what did
[1:11:59] they believe in we can take a history
[1:12:01] lesson this morning right brother Pete
[1:12:04] gave us one and that was absolutely
[1:12:07] wonderful and I probably don't know
[1:12:10] American history like brother Pete does
[1:12:11] but I know a little around the because I
[1:12:15] teach the Constitutional stuff but you
[1:12:17] understand in in people get confused
[1:12:20] think the Constitution was was signed in
[1:12:24] 1776 and it wasn't that was Declaration
[1:12:26] of Independence and if you look at the
[1:12:28] similarities you know I don't want to
[1:12:30] say types because people think you know
[1:12:32] you're taking the place of the Prophet
[1:12:33] or something if you say this type that
[1:12:35] and type I I won't say that I the
[1:12:38] similarities when you look at how the
[1:12:41] forefathers your forefathers that come
[1:12:43] to this country they they came away from
[1:12:45] a evil King they had a fight they come
[1:12:48] into a new
[1:12:49] land that was given to
[1:12:51] them God Was preparing it for you God
[1:12:54] Was preparing this land
[1:12:55] for a prophet to come in your
[1:12:58] day somebody had to come somebody had to
[1:13:02] fight for the land yeah and so the these
[1:13:05] guys come over and I like to look at the
[1:13:08] the similarities between between the old
[1:13:10] test and and the children of Israel
[1:13:14] coming out of Egypt how they had to they
[1:13:15] left a king that wanted to oppress them
[1:13:18] they wouldn't let him serve the god that
[1:13:19] they wanted to serve and they come to a
[1:13:21] land they had to fight for that land
[1:13:25] and then they wrote
[1:13:27] laws they get out in the wilderness and
[1:13:30] God gives Moses the law you understand
[1:13:33] the Constitution the way the
[1:13:35] Constitution was written it was all
[1:13:37] law Bill of Rights did not come till
[1:13:40] later it was
[1:13:44] law if you go read the first three
[1:13:47] articles it's the same thing is it was
[1:13:50] in in the Old Testament it was law it
[1:13:53] was judge and judgment
[1:13:56] that's what it was there was when they
[1:13:58] had the Constitutional Convention in
[1:14:00] Philadelphia in May through September
[1:14:03] 1787 and when they finished the
[1:14:05] Constitution they got it colonel George
[1:14:07] Mason from Virginia looked at it and
[1:14:08] says I would rather cut off my right
[1:14:10] hand than to sign that paper because
[1:14:12] there is no
[1:14:14] Grace there was no rights given to the
[1:14:17] people and you had go Christ come and
[1:14:20] looked at the law and says there's no
[1:14:22] Grace yeah there is no Grace there I was
[1:14:25] telling brother Robin other day how much
[1:14:27] I when I read the Constitution and read
[1:14:29] the how it came to be it makes me think
[1:14:31] of the Old
[1:14:32] Testament there was it was all law it
[1:14:35] was you had to live this way you had to
[1:14:37] do this do do this and if they accuse
[1:14:40] you of something they just threw you in
[1:14:41] jail they threw you in a
[1:14:45] dungeon and when you when you look at it
[1:14:47] and you you see how how Satan does the
[1:14:50] same
[1:14:52] thing you you're not Ling by the law in
[1:14:54] the Jes Jesus Jesus came and when the
[1:14:56] old the New Testament comes and he he
[1:14:58] sheds his blood he didn't just cut off
[1:14:59] his hand he said I'll give my whole life
[1:15:02] yeah so that we don't have to just live
[1:15:04] by law we have to have
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:12] Grace 1
[1:15:16] Timothy 1 ver8 but we know that the law
[1:15:19] is good and if a man use it
[1:15:21] lawfully knowing this that the law is
[1:15:24] not made for a righteous man but for the
[1:15:27] Lawless and dis disobedient for the
[1:15:30] ungodly and for Sinners the Unholy the
[1:15:33] profane that was me and
[1:15:36] you that's what the law was for and
[1:15:40] before the blood was shed that's what
[1:15:42] you had to live
[1:15:44] by that was you that was
[1:15:47] law you you Wen you weren't the
[1:15:49] righteous man you weren't the righteous
[1:15:52] woman you you're you're not the one that
[1:15:54] said God says well we don't need a law
[1:15:56] because these people are
[1:15:59] perfect you were the profane you were
[1:16:02] the sinful you were the
[1:16:05] ungodly but God knew you couldn't live
[1:16:07] by the
[1:16:09] law that's I said before you imagine if
[1:16:13] we still had to go by
[1:16:15] sacrifices we wouldn't have room for
[1:16:17] houses for all the herds right if we had
[1:16:20] to sacrifice something for every sin
[1:16:21] that we done we wouldn't have enough
[1:16:23] animals we'd be sacrific the stuff all
[1:16:26] day
[1:16:29] yeah but for whoremongers for them that
[1:16:32] defile themselves with mankind for
[1:16:33] menstealers for liars for perjured
[1:16:35] persons if there be any other thing that
[1:16:37] is contrary to sound
[1:16:40] Doctrine God always had a law look at
[1:16:42] the high priest these were the most
[1:16:45] revered men in in in the Bible in the
[1:16:47] Old Testament but God had a law you had
[1:16:49] to dress a certain way you had to smell
[1:16:52] a certain way you had to bring a certain
[1:16:54] smelling savior into him an
[1:16:57] incense you had to wear a certain color
[1:17:00] you had to make a certain sound yes and
[1:17:03] if you didn't you
[1:17:06] died right that was God's law amen if
[1:17:11] you if you did things on on the on the
[1:17:13] Sabbath or if you if you did looked on
[1:17:16] someone unclean or or many things that
[1:17:19] they did if you ate of this meat if you
[1:17:22] sacrificed the wrong wrong sacrifice God
[1:17:25] could kill
[1:17:26] you that was the
[1:17:28] law and God's always had a law you know
[1:17:32] when Grace came Grace didn't take away
[1:17:34] the law the law was still there the law
[1:17:37] is still there amen Grace didn't say the
[1:17:41] interpretation of some people now now
[1:17:42] it's Grace I can do whatever I want
[1:17:44] there's no it took away the law it did
[1:17:46] not take away the law God married them
[1:17:49] together the grace and law became
[1:17:53] married
[1:17:59] when you look at Adam and Eve God had a
[1:18:01] law God said on that day you eat that
[1:18:04] day that day you die they died that day
[1:18:07] you realize the lamb that God killed and
[1:18:09] clothed them in was not to
[1:18:12] cover the place of their sin it was to
[1:18:14] cover their
[1:18:15] shame God didn't say okay you can
[1:18:18] continue to live I'll kill this lamb in
[1:18:20] your place and you can go ahead and go
[1:18:22] on
[1:18:22] living they died that day
[1:18:25] they no man no longer lived a thousand
[1:18:28] years
[1:18:31] amen we're getting somewhere I'm kind of
[1:18:34] slow right now but we'll get
[1:18:39] there without the grace of God Satan
[1:18:41] could accuse you of anything before the
[1:18:42] Throne of God and he still
[1:18:45] does in Hebrews
[1:18:48] 12 and 18 I'm going read here a little
[1:18:51] bit and then we'll we'll get into
[1:18:52] something for you are not come to the
[1:18:54] Mount this is God's law this is him him
[1:18:56] telling you couldn't touch the
[1:18:59] mountain Mount s siia you were now
[1:19:03] coming not come into the mount that
[1:19:04] might be touched that burned with fire
[1:19:06] nor into Blackness and darkness and
[1:19:08] Tempest and the sound of the trumpet in
[1:19:10] the voice of The Words which voice they
[1:19:13] that heard and treated the word should
[1:19:14] not be spoken for for them anymore for
[1:19:17] they could not endure that was which was
[1:19:20] commanded they couldn't endure the law
[1:19:22] and if so much a beast touched the
[1:19:24] mountain it it was stoned or thrust
[1:19:25] through the dart it was so terrible a
[1:19:27] sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear
[1:19:31] and Quake but you are come unto Mount Si
[1:19:35] and unto the city of the Living God the
[1:19:37] heavenly Jerusalem into an innumerable
[1:19:39] company of angels to the general

[1:20:01] courtroom God the judge he sits on the
[1:20:05] on the seat the spirit of just men made

[1:20:26] when you look at the setting and you
[1:20:27] read down in verse 28 wherefore we
[1:20:30] receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:20:32] moved let us have Grace whereby we may
[1:20:35] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:20:38] godly
[1:20:43] fear brother brandom said in the
[1:20:46] breach he comes forth to take his claims
[1:20:50] now comes forth to take his claims he
[1:20:52] has done the Kinsman work he has come
[1:20:54] down become man died he done the Kinsman
[1:20:56] work of redemption he had not as yet
[1:20:58] called for his claim now he comes to the
[1:21:01] scene to claim his Rights Watch what
[1:21:03] takes place for which he was slain for
[1:21:06] becoming a Kinsman to men to die in his
[1:21:08] place to redeem him but the Elder was
[1:21:10] right when he was a lion the Elder
[1:21:12] called him a lion called him and said a
[1:21:14] lion because he had been a lamb
[1:21:16] intercessor bloody lamb now he's coming
[1:21:18] forth as a lion his days of intercession
[1:21:20] is over seven horns was the seven
[1:21:23] churches the seven Church ages that was
[1:21:26] the Lamb's protection when he protected
[1:21:28] his rights on Earth with a god-sent
[1:21:30] group of people that you that protected
[1:21:33] see the Horn of the Lamb he claimed
[1:21:36] those rights and is the the God sent
[1:21:38] people that horn that was on the lamb
[1:21:39] you protect those rights those are your
[1:21:42] rights to protect are you using them are
[1:21:45] you accessing your
[1:21:48] rights It All Belongs to You overcoming
[1:21:51] power Deliverance healing yeah this is
[1:21:55] all that he whenever he did the
[1:21:57] intercessory work this is all that he
[1:22:00] claimed and he gave to you as your
[1:22:04] rights many men died in this country so
[1:22:07] that you can have rights a man died that
[1:22:10] you could have rights as a
[1:22:12] bride so what I want to do for a little
[1:22:14] bit if you'll bear with me is I want
[1:22:17] to look at a few of our
[1:22:21] rights in the
[1:22:23] Constitution and kind of look how they
[1:22:25] kind of are similar to the rights as a
[1:22:28] bride the First Amendment the freedom of
[1:22:30] religion you have the right to believe
[1:22:32] and worship however you wish in your
[1:22:34] country that's a great Freedom
[1:22:37] especially nowadays when they're trying
[1:22:39] to take it from you they're going to
[1:22:40] eventually work on they're not
[1:22:42] eventually they're wanting to form a

[1:27:57] Amendment we're going to get into
[1:27:59] brother Matthew's territory
[1:28:02] here right against unlawful search and
[1:28:10] seizure so what was
[1:28:13] happening was the Red Coach would come
[1:28:15] in and they would say we're looking for
[1:28:16] so and so or we're looking if you have
[1:28:19] guns or ammo or or gold or whatever and
[1:28:21] they would come and search your house
[1:28:25] that was nothing you could do by to kick
[1:28:26] the door in come and search through
[1:28:29] everything and they come up with
[1:28:32] this this amendment Fourth Amendment
[1:28:35] I've had to deal with this a lot of time
[1:28:37] on cases I worked Auto burglaries and
[1:28:39] and a lot of times I'd have to go search
[1:28:40] houses or cars and if I didn't get
[1:28:42] consent I would have to go do a search
[1:28:45] warrant because of the Fourth Amendment
[1:28:49] yes so Satan likes to come in and search
[1:28:52] your house
[1:28:55] he likes to trick you say I want to I
[1:28:57] want to come in and just I'm looking for
[1:29:01] let me tell you trick you I'll type it

[1:29:09] teach in my class I tell my class I said
[1:29:11] listen so you got a warrant for so and
[1:29:14] so and you you go in this house and and
[1:29:17] you've got actual warrant that you can
[1:29:18] go in and look for this person and
[1:29:21] you're searching around and you go into

[1:29:50] box and you was looking for a person and
[1:29:54] Satan tricks you so many times tells you

[1:32:22] good the six a
[1:32:25] minute we're getting back around to
[1:32:27] where we was the right to face your
[1:32:33] accuser anyone brings an accusation
[1:32:35] against you you have the right to face
[1:32:38] them in a court of
[1:32:42] law the right to have witness on your
[1:32:46] behalf and the right to a speedy
[1:32:51] trial your counselor faced your accuser
[1:32:54] so you wouldn't have
[1:32:56] to he was also your
[1:33:01] witness your trial was so quick it was
[1:33:04] over before the foundation of the world
[1:33:06] you talk about a speedy
[1:33:08] trial in the mind of God before the
[1:33:10] foundation of the world he said I'll
[1:33:12] show you a speedy trial before the
[1:33:15] foundation of the world your trial was
[1:33:18] over you've already been judged found
[1:33:22] not guilty pardon and prom
[1:33:24] a better Dwelling Place brother brandham
[1:33:26] says in the church ages in 54 this is
[1:33:28] when he preached it the first time brass
[1:33:30] is always judgment you know the Brazen
[1:33:33] Altar and the brass serpent so forth
[1:33:35] brass speaks of judgment his feet then
[1:33:37] the Church of Jesus Christ is set upon
[1:33:40] Divine judgment Christ dying in herstead
[1:33:42] the just one paying for our judgment up
[1:33:44] there before God and died there as a
[1:33:47] sinner on the cross his soul ascended
[1:33:49] into hell and God not suffering his holy
[1:33:51] one to see corruption raised him up on
[1:33:53] the third day for our justification
[1:33:55] that's the one that took your place
[1:33:57] prise the Lord so now we we'll look at
[1:34:00] what happens if just say you're brought
[1:34:03] to court
[1:34:04] today If today was your court day and
[1:34:06] and Satan says I'm bringing so and so to
[1:34:09] court brother so and so sister so and so
[1:34:11] to court and I'm accusing them of this
[1:34:13] and we're going to have a court
[1:34:15] trial brother Matthew if I M this up you
[1:34:18] fix it for me
[1:34:21] later so before there could be a a
[1:34:23] charge brought to you there has to be an
[1:34:26] accusation you have to be accused of
[1:34:29] something and then they come arrest you
[1:34:31] and then they and they lock you up and
[1:34:34] they set you a court date and on your
[1:34:36] very first court date they have what
[1:34:37] they call an
[1:34:39] arraignment and here you are
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:34:42] and you stand before the judge and the
[1:34:45] very first thing the judge asks you do
[1:34:47] you know what your rights
[1:34:49] are and the judges around here whether
[1:34:52] you know what your rights are or not
[1:34:53] he'll they'll read them to
[1:34:56] you do you know your
[1:34:59] rights and he tells you what you right
[1:35:02] then he tells you do you know what
[1:35:02] you're being accused
[1:35:05] of do you do you know what's being
[1:35:07] brought against you what your charges
[1:35:09] are and then he says can you afford an
[1:35:13] attorney if you can't afford one one
[1:35:17] will be appointed to represent
[1:35:19] you and trust me you can't afford one on
[1:35:23] the things that Satan accuses you of you
[1:35:25] can't afford attorney right on the
[1:35:28] things that he says that youve done and
[1:35:30] if you want to take your human mind and
[1:35:32] look back at everything you've done
[1:35:33] you've got no
[1:35:35] defense you've got no excuses you've got
[1:35:39] no argument for it and here you're St
[1:35:42] standing before a righteous judge just I
[1:35:45] want you to look at it for a minute
[1:35:48] without the
[1:35:49] blood you're standing before a judge
[1:35:52] without the blood of Christ in a
[1:35:54] courtroom how do you think that's going
[1:35:56] to end in for
[1:35:59] you how do you think it's going to end
[1:36:01] for you when you when when everything
[1:36:03] that you've done is brought across the
[1:36:05] screen as
[1:36:06] evidence and and the the the the
[1:36:10] prosecuting attorney says your honor I'd
[1:36:12] like to I'd like to present this
[1:36:15] evidence let me tell you about
[1:36:21] evidence evidence is your case
[1:36:26] it's very few times can you win a case
[1:36:29] just by proving the intent of somebody's
[1:36:31] mind it's so hard to
[1:36:33] do it's very hard to do evidence is
[1:36:37] what unless it's OJ OJ
[1:36:40] case totally different totally
[1:36:44] different but if your life wants to show
[1:36:46] before you and this puts all this
[1:36:48] evidence he brings a big screen up and
[1:36:49] he shows your
[1:36:51] life and everybody's looking at it and
[1:36:55] there's all these accusations against
[1:36:59] you you've got no
[1:37:03] defense so the judge judges around here
[1:37:07] an attorney can walk into the courtroom
[1:37:08] and the judge if I'm right brother
[1:37:10] Matthew a judge can say I want you to
[1:37:12] take this
[1:37:13] case he can pick any turn he
[1:37:16] wants I want you to take this case I'm
[1:37:19] I'm appointing you this case it just so
[1:37:21] happened one day on Calvary Christ
[1:37:23] walked into your
[1:37:25] life he said I want you to take this
[1:37:28] case you become the
[1:37:31] attorney you explain to him what his
[1:37:33] charges are you explaining what's
[1:37:35] waiting for him if he don't
[1:37:41] win you got no chance of
[1:37:43] winning so they have what they call the
[1:37:46] burden of
[1:37:47] proof so if you've been accused of
[1:37:51] something the burden of proof
[1:37:54] lies with the prosecuting
[1:37:56] attorney the prosecuting attorney has to
[1:37:58] prove that he accused you of something
[1:38:00] that you actually did and he has to
[1:38:03] provide proof of
[1:38:05] that I remember I was I had a case 2010
[1:38:10] somewhere in there and I arrested this
[1:38:11] man and this woman for murdering their
[1:38:13] two-month old baby little Kaylee
[1:38:19] Atkins the thing that struck
[1:38:21] me was the power of the
[1:38:25] judge we presented this
[1:38:28] case with against one of the best
[1:38:30] attorneys Jim Bowman Matthew worked for
[1:38:33] him for a while wonderful man a great
[1:38:35] man outside the courtroom wonderful
[1:38:36] inter
[1:38:38] attorney but we presented so much
[1:38:40] evidence the evidence was
[1:38:44] overwhelming and we knew we had the case
[1:38:48] one and then when there all the evidence
[1:38:52] is presented closing statements are done
[1:38:54] the judge asked the defense
[1:38:58] attorney now I want you
[1:39:01] to put yourself in Christ at this
[1:39:03] defense attorney's table for a
[1:39:06] minute but judge judge cup looks at Mr
[1:39:10] Bowman and says counselor do you have
[1:39:12] any last
[1:39:15] statements Mr Bowman stands up and he
[1:39:18] says yes your
[1:39:20] honor I ask that you dismiss this case
[1:39:23] for lack of
[1:39:27] evidence I'd never seen that happen
[1:39:30] before and I looked at the da and I said
[1:39:33] can the Judge do that he said absolutely
[1:39:36] he can actually just sit there and say I
[1:39:38] haven't seen enough evidence and toss
[1:39:41] the whole
[1:39:42] case not
[1:39:44] guilty that didn't happen in our case
[1:39:47] but it showed the power you look at such
[1:39:50] a mighty powerful God that it growing up
[1:39:53] when you're a kid you know you get this
[1:39:55] image of God and what he is this big
[1:39:57] powerful God that if if you do something
[1:39:59] wrong he's going to strike you dead if
[1:40:00] you tell a lie the lightning is going to
[1:40:02] come down and strike you and that's
[1:40:03] that's what we picture Our God
[1:40:05] as until we get get a revelation of who
[1:40:08] he really
[1:40:09] is but he has the power but you had you
[1:40:13] you you had an attorney that could stand
[1:40:15] up no matter what the evidence was the
[1:40:18] burden of proof is on the prosecution
[1:40:20] and yet the defense says your honor we
[1:40:23] we ask that you dismiss this for lack of
[1:40:27] evidence and that's exactly what God did
[1:40:30] for
[1:40:31] you not
[1:40:33] guilty you haven't showed me enough
[1:40:36] Satan you haven't showed me anything I
[1:40:38] didn't see that
[1:40:42] right you you got to understand that the
[1:40:45] the prosecuting attorney's got his list
[1:40:47] of
[1:40:48] witnesses he's bringing all these
[1:40:50] Witnesses and do you realize he might
[1:40:52] bring somebody and your family subpoena
[1:40:54] them into court to witness against
[1:40:59] you who are his
[1:41:01] Witnesses look at the woman who were her
[1:41:04] her Witnesses against
[1:41:07] her they were going to be her they were
[1:41:10] her Witnesses against her they were her
[1:41:12] judges they were her
[1:41:17] judgment I want you to look the person
[1:41:19] beside
[1:41:21] you sometimes that's the witness against
[1:41:26] you
[1:41:29] silence do you
[1:41:32] realize now I'm not trying to step on
[1:41:36] toes when you talk about
[1:41:39] somebody when you bring up something
[1:41:41] that God forgave them of right you go
[1:41:44] pick up the phone and you call your
[1:41:45] daughter your best friend your
[1:41:47] daughter-in-law whoever it is your buddy
[1:41:49] you say you know do you hear about so
[1:41:50] and so did this you've become a witness
[1:41:52] for hell oh my you are on the
[1:41:55] prosecutions witness list you have put
[1:41:58] yourself
[1:42:00] there in studying this I don't know if I
[1:42:02] put it down here or not but brother
[1:42:03] brandom said whenever you start talking
[1:42:05] about people accusing people and
[1:42:07] backbiting you can't even call yourself
[1:42:09] a Christian
[1:42:12] yet and whether or not you like it
[1:42:15] you've entered into their
[1:42:18] courtroom yeah and you've pointed
[1:42:21] fingers and you sat in the witness box
[1:42:23] right beside the judge and you looked at
[1:42:25] the judge and said God they did
[1:42:30] this
[1:42:32] yeah that's what you're doing you've
[1:42:35] become a witness for the devil oh my
[1:42:39] remember that this is you are people
[1:42:41] that that your brothers and sisters here
[1:42:44] need to lean on for prayer for help and
[1:42:47] encouragement but instead we're armed
[1:42:49] with
[1:42:50] stones we've got people trying to take
[1:42:54] Rapture and we're standing with stones
[1:42:56] in our
[1:42:57] hands we've got people that want to get
[1:43:00] out of
[1:43:01] here and you're ready to Stone
[1:43:04] them you could you could you could tell
[1:43:07] me all you want brother Joe I would
[1:43:08] never do that I I would never do that
[1:43:10] and you probably wouldn't
[1:43:13] physically but that's what God
[1:43:16] hears oh Satan's got a new witness
[1:43:20] Satan's got a new witness got him on the
[1:43:22] stand brother BR said you're not even a
[1:43:24] Christian yet if you call up your friend
[1:43:27] to tell talk about somebody did this
[1:43:29] this brother did this and this sister
[1:43:30] did
[1:43:31] that get the Holy Ghost yeah you better
[1:43:34] find that attorney cuz you're going to
[1:43:35] need him in a little
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:41] bit so moving on you you get the defense
[1:43:46] understands that the prosecution has all
[1:43:48] this
[1:43:49] evidence and we and the defense does
[1:43:51] what they call a motion for discovery
[1:43:52] that is the very first thing they do
[1:43:55] when you enter a court
[1:43:56] trial motion for discovery which means
[1:44:00] every little bit of evidence that you
[1:44:03] have you have to show it to
[1:44:06] me you can't keep
[1:44:09] nothing you have to say this is what I
[1:44:12] have the next
[1:44:14] thing that Christ did was filed a motion
[1:44:18] to suppress am I right so far brother
[1:44:20] Matthew a motion to suppress how many
[1:44:22] knows emotion to suppress is Paul have
[1:44:24] you figured that out
[1:44:26] yet he's going to law
[1:44:28] school emotion to
[1:44:30] suppress that's which means I am going
[1:44:33] to ask the judge to throw out everything
[1:44:37] that I found in
[1:44:41] Discovery so how does the Satan how does
[1:44:43] Satan gain the evidence on
[1:44:46] you I know you quiet that's
[1:44:50] fine so what what the defense attorney
[1:44:55] is going to say is your
[1:44:56] honor he's going to say well why should
[1:44:59] we suppress the evidence he's going to
[1:45:00] say your honor it's fruits of the
[1:45:02] poisonous
[1:45:06] tree how many knows what fruits of the
[1:45:08] poisonous tree
[1:45:10] is I know some of you
[1:45:12] do evidence that's obtained
[1:45:15] illegally hence comes the Fourth
[1:45:17] Amendment
[1:45:19] again if I was to go into somebody's
[1:45:22] house and start searching and I take
[1:45:24] things well I I know what this is this
[1:45:26] was stolen out of Auto burglary that I
[1:45:27] had a couple weeks ago searching the
[1:45:30] house I find this this is stuff that was
[1:45:31] from a robbery over at the pawn shop and
[1:45:33] I take
[1:45:36] that I take it no search warrant no
[1:45:38] consent no nothing I take
[1:45:42] it it's fruits of the poisonous
[1:45:47] tree you have to understand any evidence
[1:45:51] that is brought against you that is
[1:45:53] deemed fruits of the poisonous tree is
[1:45:55] thrown
[1:45:56] out it can't be used against you at
[1:46:00] all so Satan could say your honor I had
[1:46:03] a search warrant you understand who
[1:46:06] signs a search
[1:46:07] warrant the judge has to sign a search
[1:46:09] warrant and your judge says I would
[1:46:12] never put my name on a search warrant
[1:46:14] written by the
[1:46:15] devil right I'll never put my name so I
[1:46:18] know I didn't sign
[1:46:20] that so he had to get it illegally so
[1:46:23] God says now this fruits of the
[1:46:25] poisonous tree I'm putting it under the
[1:46:26] blood of calvary's tree Glory I can't
[1:46:28] see it no
[1:46:29] [Applause]
[1:46:39] more so when you got your
[1:46:46] attorney he knows what pro bono
[1:46:50] is brother Matthew is says I don't get
[1:46:53] paid when I do those yeah that's exactly
[1:46:56] what it
[1:46:57] is American Bar
[1:46:59] Association model rule
[1:47:02] 6.1 brother Matthews probably got this
[1:47:04] on his bumper sticker the state rule
[1:47:06] states that lawyers have a professional
[1:47:08] responsibility to provide legal services
[1:47:10] to those who can't pay you could not pay
[1:47:13] yes you couldn't
[1:47:15] pay amen it took a life it took a life
[1:47:20] to pay for your attorney
[1:47:23] a
[1:47:26] life so if you didn't get one it was
[1:47:28] going to cost you your
[1:47:30] life so God appointed you one it's a you
[1:47:34] got to understand and I'm I'm wrapping
[1:47:37] up you got to understand God every every
[1:47:40] case that that Christ has taken has been
[1:47:43] pro bono it cost him way more than it
[1:47:45] cost you
[1:47:48] yeah you know there there's people that
[1:47:50] get acquitted or or found not guilty y
[1:47:53] with a a pro bow attorney and they might
[1:47:54] buy him a a gift card or something you
[1:47:56] know they might it might feel
[1:47:59] insignificant all all all your attorney
[1:48:02] wants is hey when the case is
[1:48:04] over come over the house a little
[1:48:08] bit when the case is
[1:48:10] over want to go grab a
[1:48:13] bite he'll never bring up your
[1:48:17] case when it's over he'll never ever
[1:48:19] ever ever bring up your case ever
[1:48:24] you understand it's he don't even
[1:48:26] remember it
[1:48:28] either when your case is over he don't
[1:48:31] remember
[1:48:32] it now you're just
[1:48:35] friends now you're just
[1:48:37] buddies now he just wants to sit down
[1:48:39] and fellowship with
[1:48:41] you can we give him that much
[1:48:44] yeah c can we give him the the the one
[1:48:47] that paid so much for you that took care
[1:48:50] of your case for you amen you know he he
[1:48:53] calls his Witnesses
[1:48:55] too there's there's such a thing in in
[1:48:59] in the in the courtroom in a court trial
[1:49:03] when the defense will ask for the
[1:49:08] rule what the rule is is
[1:49:13] everyone that has to
[1:49:15] witness or testify in this case has to
[1:49:18] leave the
[1:49:20] courtroom they have to leave
[1:49:24] they can't sit in there and listen to
[1:49:26] testimony anything that would sway their
[1:49:28] testimony but they have to leave we
[1:49:31] we've had many witnesses on our behalf
[1:49:33] in our time that have left brother Jim
[1:49:36] bab sister Erica brother Daniel Nunley
[1:49:40] sister Sharon Ward they they've had to
[1:49:41] leave sister na me daily they've left
[1:49:44] but the scripture says we are incompass
[1:49:46] we are compassed about with a cloud of
[1:49:49] witnesses these are your Witnesses
[1:49:53] they're the ones that witness on your
[1:49:56] behalf and they're also telling you you
[1:49:59] can make it I am a witness is that what
[1:50:02] your reward when you win this case this
[1:50:04] is what your reward is we've seen it
[1:50:08] there's always a witness on your behalf
[1:50:10] there's more for you than is against
[1:50:13] you let's Stand
[1:50:16] Together Hebrews 12:1 wherefore sing we
[1:50:19] are also compassed about with so great a
[1:50:21] cloud of witnesses
[1:50:23] lay aside every weight lay everything
[1:50:26] aside that Satan says is accusing you
[1:50:29] because it's dragging you
[1:50:30] down lay it
[1:50:33] aside and the sin which so easy easily
[1:50:35] beset us and let us run with patience
[1:50:37] the grace that has set before
[1:50:42] us your defense attorney called a a
[1:50:45] witness to your behalf called
[1:50:49] Mercy thousands of years maybe millions
[1:50:52] of years
[1:50:53] grace and mercy have been behind the
[1:50:56] veil hiding behind the veil Mercy is
[1:50:59] wanting to to speak on your behalf so
[1:51:03] bad it's pushed up against that Veil so
[1:51:06] tight but the veil wouldn't give Mercy
[1:51:09] screaming out to get to you I I want to
[1:51:12] get them I want to be a part of them I I
[1:51:14] want to help them through
[1:51:16] this for thousands and thousands of
[1:51:18] years Mercy was behind this Veil
[1:51:22] yeah then one day he was called out the
[1:51:26] day you got appointed your attorney the
[1:51:28] vent was the the veil was written too
[1:51:31] and mercy ran to you with everything it
[1:51:33] had yeah Grace came to you with
[1:51:36] everything it had Lord those are the
[1:51:39] witnesses that the judge listens
[1:51:43] to judge don't listen to all this these
[1:51:46] these false accusers these false
[1:51:48] witnesses that come in and tell you that
[1:51:50] you you have cancer because you have
[1:51:52] depression
[1:51:54] it tells you everybody's talking about
[1:51:55] you behind your back you know
[1:51:59] sometimes you you think that people are
[1:52:01] talking behind you back and they really
[1:52:03] ain't that's
[1:52:05] right sometimes they're
[1:52:07] not Satan's telling you they are
[1:52:13] yeah that's when you you're listening to
[1:52:15] the W the evidence the witness that the
[1:52:17] devil brings against
[1:52:21] you let's bow our
[1:52:27] heads Heavenly
[1:52:31] Father Lord I know it it's chopped up
[1:52:34] again as it always is father but Lord I
[1:52:37] pray if there's some bits and pieces
[1:52:38] that you could put together for
[1:52:40] someone Lord someone that's going
[1:52:43] through so much father
[1:52:46] that Satan's brought this against them
[1:52:48] brought that against them Father and
[1:52:49] that's all they
[1:52:50] hear they don't they don't how to
[1:52:55] testify what you've done for them Father
[1:52:57] because they're so
[1:52:59] overwhelmed Lord I pray that you would
[1:53:01] touch their heart speak to them or Lord
[1:53:04] may they
[1:53:05] realize whenever Satan accuses them of
[1:53:08] something he has to accuse
[1:53:10] Christ because your word says that you
[1:53:12] took our place your Prophet said we took
[1:53:15] your
[1:53:17] place when you wrote your name the
[1:53:19] Lamb's Book of Life you wrote ours
[1:53:22] so anytime Satan brings the accusation
[1:53:25] accusation against the bride he's
[1:53:27] bringing it against the
[1:53:28] groom Lord I pray that you would touch
[1:53:30] the needs here Lord Lord May something
[1:53:33] been said that would touch a heart
[1:53:35] father Lord as little as it was I pray
[1:53:37] that you would we thank you for it Jesus
