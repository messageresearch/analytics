[37:14] to love
[37:16] to be a child of god
[37:19] let's read if you would book a
[37:21] revelation tonight chapter 12 verse 7.
[37:32] this is where
[37:34] the pull of the end time
[37:37] for those who
[37:39] are not washed by the water of the word
[37:43] this is where they're fixing to be
[37:44] gathered
[37:47] revelation 12
[37:49] and there was war in heaven
[37:52] michael
[37:53] and his angels
[37:55] fought against the dragon
[37:58] and the dragon fought
[38:00] and his angels
[38:02] now keep in mind who his angels are
[38:06] angels that god created
[38:08] for his own purpose
[38:10] and they fell from their estate in
[38:13] heaven
[38:14] remember satan was the first preacher
[38:17] that tried to pull people
[38:19] out of their position
[38:24] and prevail not
[38:25] neither was their place found
[38:28] anymore in heaven notice how
[38:31] the john says this neither was
[38:33] their
[38:34] place
[38:35] they had an allocation an allotment that
[38:38] was actually their place
[38:40] but neither was their place found any
[38:43] more in heaven and the great dragon was
[38:45] cast out that old serpent called the
[38:47] devil and satan which deceiveth the
[38:50] whole world
[38:51] he was cast out into the earth and his
[38:54] angels were cast out with him
[38:57] and i heard a loud voice
[38:59] in heaven saying
[39:01] now
[39:02] is come salvation
[39:04] and strength and the kingdom of our god
[39:08] and the power of his christ
[39:11] for
[39:12] the accuser of our brethren is cast down
[39:16] which accused them
[39:18] before our god
[39:20] day and night
[39:22] and they overcame him by the blood of
[39:24] the lamb and by the word of their
[39:26] testimony and they loved not their lives
[39:30] unto death that's real bride people
[39:32] right there
[39:34] therefore rejoice ye heavens
[39:37] and ye that dwell in them
[39:39] woe to the inhabiters of the earth and
[39:41] of the sea for the devil the devil
[39:45] has come down unto you
[39:47] having great wrath
[39:50] because he knows that he has
[39:53] but a short time
[39:54] let's pray together
[39:59] heavenly father
[40:01] if we did not have a hope
[40:05] of being able to miss this that we have
[40:07] read
[40:09] i'm afraid we would be so sad
[40:12] and so depressed and so gloomy
[40:16] we would not want to live another day
[40:20] to see and hear the things that are
[40:22] fixing to break loose on the earth
[40:26] and to know father that you have made a
[40:28] way
[40:29] that we can escape if we wish to
[40:33] you even told us
[40:34] how to pray
[40:36] and what to say when we pray it
[40:39] pray you therefore always
[40:42] that you may be accounted worthy
[40:45] to escape all these things that shall
[40:47] come to pass
[40:49] and stand before
[40:51] the son of man
[40:53] lord god may you speak to us tonight
[40:56] from your word
[40:57] we ask in the name of jesus
[41:00] amen
[41:01] god bless you you may be seated
[41:09] i realize there's an element of
[41:11] christians
[41:13] that
[41:14] don't really see a need
[41:16] for a preacher
[41:19] to
[41:20] preach
[41:21] deeper things
[41:23] or preach things that
[41:26] they really
[41:28] say don't understand
[41:30] or don't comprehend they they would
[41:32] rather have a preacher that would
[41:34] preach
[41:35] pretty much
[41:37] where they are
[41:38] and if your first grade teacher would
[41:40] have taught you that much you reckon
[41:42] you'd ever graduated out of the first
[41:44] grade
[41:46] but she had to prod you
[41:48] you know
[41:49] there's an element about the bible
[41:52] that many people miss
[41:55] and it's why
[41:56] that many preachers
[41:59] are not really pulled upon
[42:01] by their congregation especially pastors
[42:04] to preach
[42:05] the full bible
[42:07] now it's one thing to say that we are
[42:10] full gospel people
[42:11] but it's another thing for the preachers
[42:14] who say they are full gospel to preach
[42:18] the full bible i know i'm leading you
[42:20] out on a limb but don't worry i'll get
[42:22] you off and i won't saw us off
[42:24] so there's more to the bible to preach
[42:28] than just salvation
[42:30] healing miracles blessings new cars new
[42:34] houses
[42:36] right
[42:37] so whenever men of god are inspired by
[42:41] the spirit of god to go into avenues
[42:43] that people aren't aware of many times
[42:47] people were set in the service well i
[42:48] didn't understand that i didn't get much
[42:50] out of that i don't understand that i
[42:51] like hearing a preacher like that so you
[42:53] don't like to be challenged
[42:55] you only want me brother daryl brother
[42:57] joel whoever the rest of the ministers
[42:59] ever come in here is just basically
[43:01] preach what you already know
[43:03] you don't want us to ever go in any
[43:05] realm of a sphere of the word of god
[43:08] that's not beyond you i i don't
[43:10] understand your thinking at all
[43:13] myself i want to sit under men of god
[43:15] that motivate me to study the word
[43:19] that motivate me to move higher amen
[43:23] now this is the key
[43:25] why that that some people don't do that
[43:28] listen to this in the kinsmen redeemer
[43:30] brother rahm said the bible is a love
[43:33] story the whole bible
[43:36] is a love story not only is it a love
[43:40] story but it's a prophet
[43:44] not only is it a prophet
[43:46] it's also
[43:48] a history all right so the bible is a
[43:51] love story the bible
[43:54] is a prophet in that peculiar that you'd
[43:56] say the bible is a prophet so the bible
[43:59] is the love story the bible is a prophet
[44:02] and the bible is history now he said
[44:05] it's a love story a history a prophet
[44:10] it's god himself
[44:12] so for me i want to be
[44:15] a full
[44:17] bible preacher
[44:19] okay
[44:20] i don't want to just preach healing
[44:21] alone i preach even i believe in healing
[44:24] but the whole bible is not just about
[44:26] healing
[44:27] the whole bible is more than john 3 16.
[44:31] the whole bible is more than just
[44:33] preaching about salvation every night i
[44:36] figure the majority are you folks saved
[44:37] here tonight how many all saved
[44:39] how many y'all been saved for at least a
[44:41] week or two
[44:42] so is it okay if i preach something
[44:43] beyond salvation tonight now for
[44:45] somebody i hear this loss we will
[44:47] certainly make way for you too all right
[44:48] anybody here most y'all believe malachi
[44:51] 4 god sent a prophet
[44:52] most y'all believe there's one god
[44:55] most y'all been baptized the right way
[44:58] so you want me to keep going over and
[45:00] over and over and over and again
[45:03] so you'll feel comfortable sitting there
[45:05] backsliding
[45:07] no
[45:08] not if you love god you don't you'll
[45:10] tell me man of god preach what god lays
[45:12] on your heart
[45:13] and if i have to go back and listen to
[45:15] it five times
[45:16] it'll inspire me it'll stir me
[45:20] now once again in christ the mystery of
[45:22] god revealed he said the bible is a
[45:24] prophetic book it's a historical book
[45:29] it's a book of love it's a book of songs
[45:34] it's a book
[45:35] of life
[45:37] so
[45:38] four gospel preachers aren't necessarily
[45:41] for bible preachers
[45:43] so a full bible preacher especially
[45:46] pastors are going to get into more than
[45:49] just healing miracles signs wonders now
[45:53] there's no way evangelist is going to go
[45:55] out and preach a 37 part series because
[45:57] the pastor angler invited him back for
[45:59] 37 services more than likely
[46:01] so you can't expect an evangelist or a
[46:05] traveling minister that goes out from
[46:06] church to church to church but a pastor
[46:10] god will move upon them and they will go
[46:13] into areas of the word
[46:16] to where that they will be able to bring
[46:20] something about the word to their people
[46:23] that the people can sit there under them
[46:26] for decades and never get bored on the
[46:30] word amen
[46:32] now how is that even possible it's
[46:35] because god will take their gift and
[46:38] their understanding and as they grow now
[46:41] i saw
[46:42] last week some pictures and i saw some
[46:44] more today things by the way maybe they
[46:46] had posted them and it was the spec out
[46:49] in the universe that the hubble
[46:52] telescope had taken many many years ago
[46:55] now they aimed this new one james webb
[46:58] telescope out into the same field and it
[47:02] was like they said it would take a grain
[47:04] of sand and put it on the end of your
[47:06] finger and that's what it would be
[47:08] looking like that that tiny part of the
[47:10] universe and they took the exact same
[47:13] picture of the same stars
[47:16] now here it was and hubble was it was
[47:18] unbelievable compared to what they'd
[47:21] seen prior to that but now they take the
[47:24] same picture of the same part of the
[47:27] universe but they take it with new
[47:29] vision
[47:31] with a new capability to look at the
[47:34] same things and they're seeing
[47:37] constellations
[47:38] and stars and bright lights and colors
[47:42] and yellows and greens and oranges that
[47:44] they looked right at it under hubble
[47:46] don't you understand that's the way it
[47:48] is with the light of god's word
[47:50] looser looked out there and saw stars
[47:53] and he said oh my there's three of them
[47:55] father son holy ghost and wesley looked
[47:57] out there just a little bit farther and
[47:59] said oh my it's still father son holy
[48:02] ghost but we got to be sanctified and
[48:04] pentecost looked out there a little bit
[48:06] farther and then god got a prophet that
[48:09] was able to look way out there and said
[48:12] you know what you thought them was three
[48:14] stars but it actually was one
[48:17] they all blended together praise the
[48:19] lord
[48:21] now you see science wants to see more
[48:24] and they want to see farther and they
[48:26] want to see what they saw even clearer
[48:30] well i don't understand christians that
[48:32] don't myself to me is a child of god i
[48:35] want to understand the very basics of
[48:38] redemption and salvation not in the same
[48:41] repetitive form that i knew it 40 years
[48:44] ago but i want to see it with a clearer
[48:47] understanding don't you sanctification
[48:50] baptism of the holy ghost heaven hell
[48:53] all of those great things i honestly
[48:55] don't think we'll ever reach a spot that
[48:57] will ever understand it all as a matter
[49:00] of fact in eternity he will still be
[49:02] revealing himself because he is the
[49:05] eternal one so then the bible is a book
[49:09] of love it is a book of songs prophet
[49:13] another place says it's a book of poetry
[49:16] it is a book of history it is also a
[49:19] book of redemption it is also a book of
[49:22] mystery so in this great book is all
[49:26] these aspects of the same book and yet
[49:29] some people never go beyond we're just
[49:31] getting saved and sanctified and
[49:33] teaching me how i can overcome and all
[49:35] that i don't need to understand all the
[49:36] rest of this stuff well if it's in the
[49:38] bible god apparently wants somebody to
[49:42] be able to understand it
[49:44] myself and i look at it and say well
[49:46] lord maybe i ain't got the understanding
[49:48] but please let me hear somebody one of
[49:49] these preachers out here somewhere that
[49:51] god has dealt with so let me find
[49:53] something where the prophet said i just
[49:55] don't think that god placed scriptures
[49:57] in the bible to take up space do you i
[50:00] believe they're there for a reason now
[50:02] whenever we look at this in the book of
[50:04] revelation i know it's one of the most
[50:05] misunderstood books in the bible and
[50:08] this is the reason that we needed a
[50:09] prophet to come and bring a prophetic
[50:12] class of people along with it with a
[50:15] prophetic understanding so whenever i or
[50:19] brother dale or any other minister
[50:20] that's called of god when god lays
[50:22] something on our hearts to preach and it
[50:25] might not be exactly where your
[50:26] understanding is don't sit there and say
[50:28] oh my i can't understand i can't get
[50:30] nothing well maybe god wanted you to
[50:32] grow up a little bit more and pull up a
[50:35] little bit higher
[50:37] is that right now watch we're going to
[50:39] break in to whenever the bride goes up
[50:43] and satan comes down and the picture
[50:45] changes because it's a dispensational
[50:47] change that it moves from the grace of
[50:49] god to the wrath of god it moves from
[50:53] the lawyer of god being on the throne
[50:57] changing his garments and becoming under
[51:00] the aspect of the man child of
[51:03] revelation 12. now the man child of
[51:06] revelation 12 is actually the serpent
[51:09] bruiser the serpent bruiser whenever god
[51:13] is able to consummate the man child and
[51:16] bring it back up into the presence of
[51:18] god which happened of course 2 000 years
[51:20] ago but this other missing part of
[51:23] himself the entire reconciliation of the
[51:26] bride and groom is not finished until
[51:29] our rapture and resurrection now i find
[51:32] this amazing because satan was not cast
[51:34] out of heaven as soon as the lord jesus
[51:37] went up 2 000 years ago now was that
[51:39] that a great victory was not that a
[51:41] tremendous thing when the lord jesus
[51:44] overcome death hell on the grave and
[51:46] ascended right up and went right back on
[51:48] the throne of god and has been there as
[51:50] our kinsmen redeemer for 2000 years and
[51:53] yet that ascent into the presence of god
[51:57] never kicked him out of heaven
[52:01] that never rendered him powerless and
[52:05] sent him down to the earth but even with
[52:08] our lawyer being on the throne of god he
[52:11] can still have access to the throne of
[52:14] god and go before him day and night
[52:16] accusing us but here we read of
[52:19] something that has happened what was it
[52:22] it was not that a lion come it was not
[52:25] that an angel come what was it that made
[52:28] this great change that rendered satan
[52:31] finally powerless when the bride goes up
[52:36] so when the bride goes up into the
[52:38] presence of god those people who he has
[52:42] been accusing he can accuse no more
[52:46] so he loses his position before the
[52:50] throne of god as the opposing attorney
[52:54] i'll tell you one thing if you and i
[52:55] could ever let it grip our hearts by
[52:58] revelation and satan keeps trying to
[53:00] bring up your past and your mistakes and
[53:03] your failures if you by revelation could
[53:05] ever move into that spot to where you
[53:08] refuse to allow him to condemn you for
[53:12] those things you're forgiven of and you
[53:14] refuse not god but you refuse to allow
[53:18] him to bring up all of your past and
[53:21] remind you of them ten thousands of
[53:23] things that you've done wrong but you
[53:25] draw that line and say no more devil out
[53:28] of here i'm sick of it i'm sick of
[53:30] hearing my past yes i did that but that
[53:33] was the old man i'm a new man now i'm a
[53:36] new woman i'm a brand new creature in
[53:39] christ jesus he will begin to lose his
[53:42] hole on you before your ever changed oh
[53:46] hallelujah he will begin to lose his
[53:50] hold of power and authority on you
[53:53] before your body ever changes one cell
[53:58] now read with me here in revelation
[53:59] chapter 12 verse 13 and when the dragon
[54:02] saw that he was cast into the earth he
[54:04] persecuted the woman which brought forth
[54:08] the man child so when the dragon is now
[54:12] cast out of heaven into the earth
[54:14] knowing that his defeat has been brought
[54:18] about by the conquest of the man child
[54:21] now who is the man child the lord jesus
[54:24] and the lord jesus was produced out of
[54:27] the woman which was draped in this
[54:29] crimson color and all that that that
[54:31] john was able to see by vision and she
[54:34] brought forth the man-child it was the
[54:37] result
[54:38] of the manchild's victory that his back
[54:42] has been broke and the man-child's wife
[54:45] is now caught up into the presence of
[54:48] god and whenever she's called up into
[54:51] the presence of god the devil can't
[54:53] condemn her no more because the part
[54:56] that he was condemning which is her
[54:57] mortality has been changed
[55:00] now it can point his finger well they've
[55:02] done this they've done that they don't
[55:04] pray right they don't do this and that
[55:05] and the other and we constantly need a
[55:08] lawyer there before us is that right and
[55:11] he represents us but once the bride
[55:14] child is raised up and united with the
[55:17] man child then they themselves become
[55:20] one and the body has been changed satan
[55:24] can no longer condemn that bride oh
[55:27] happy day happy day
[55:29] then what does satan do notice now how
[55:32] his hatred begins to change up prior to
[55:35] this time he's focused on that bright
[55:37] church that's what all that he's been
[55:40] against so he's focusing on that now
[55:42] that she's lifted from the earth then
[55:45] what does he do he changes his hatred
[55:48] and he aims his hatred toward whom
[55:51] toward the woman that gave birth to this
[55:55] man child
[55:56] because the man child was actually the
[55:59] problem now the woman herself was not
[56:01] the problem in herself so he will
[56:04] concentrate his hatred notice this what
[56:06] the scripture said he persecuted the
[56:09] woman which brought forth the man child
[56:12] now who was the woman the one of course
[56:14] was israel so the woman that was clothed
[56:18] in the sun and there she was clothed in
[56:20] the sun and she had 12 stars and all the
[56:22] symbolism of course and it was israel
[56:23] and whenever the sun came out of there
[56:26] then the sun was received up into the
[56:28] presence of god and a place was prepared
[56:30] for the woman in the wilderness and
[56:31] there she fled and she was kept time
[56:34] times and half a time which is three and
[56:37] a half years great tribulation the last
[56:39] part of daniel 7 is weak now notice this
[56:42] the prophet isaiah speaks of a prophetic
[56:45] time in the last days that will come
[56:47] isaiah 26 20 come my people enter thou
[56:51] into thy chambers and shut thy doors
[56:55] about thee hide thyself as it were for a
[56:59] little moment now notice come my people
[57:03] god speaking to israel god speaking to
[57:07] the chosen 144 000 and beckoning them by
[57:11] the prophetic voice of the old testament
[57:14] come as it were but for a little moment
[57:17] until the indignation or the tribulation
[57:20] period be
[57:22] overpass notice isaiah 27 1 in that day
[57:26] the lord with his sore and great and
[57:30] strong sword shall punish leviathan
[57:34] now leviathan is a creature that's
[57:36] really hard for bible scholars to even
[57:38] identify what it was they thought it
[57:40] might have been a crocodile some thought
[57:42] it might have been a hippo they're not
[57:44] really exactly sure what it was but it's
[57:46] pretty plain to see here in the
[57:47] spiritual symbolism of isaiah 27 that he
[57:50] says the strong sword shall punish
[57:53] leviathan
[57:54] the piercing serpent even the vile sand
[57:58] that crooked serpent and shall slay the
[58:00] dragon that is in the sea now notice
[58:03] your god in chapter 26 tells them to
[58:06] come into a place of protection that he
[58:10] has provided for them and there they
[58:13] will be kept from the great indignation
[58:16] on the earth and then god says by the
[58:19] same prophet that he will turn right
[58:21] around and punish the leviathan the
[58:24] crooked serpent of course you know the
[58:26] symbolism of the devil was a serpent
[58:28] from the old testament on down now
[58:31] notice whenever the dragon in revelation
[58:34] 12 17 and the dragon was ross with a
[58:37] woman and went to make war with the
[58:39] remnant of her seed which keep the
[58:42] commandments of god and the testimony of
[58:46] jesus christ so here we have two
[58:47] categories of people we have people that
[58:50] are keeping the commandments of god the
[58:52] old mosaic law and then we have another
[58:55] category of people which are keeping the
[58:57] testimony of jesus christ notice he
[58:59] doesn't say both of them have kept that
[59:01] so you've got the jews pre-conversion
[59:04] you've got the jews before receiving the
[59:06] holy ghost and that's why the prophet
[59:07] said many of them will be them orthodox
[59:09] jews and they'll come out they'll be
[59:11] looking for their brother joseph they'll
[59:13] be looking for their messiah and these
[59:15] are the two that they'll be brought
[59:17] together and satan will come down on the
[59:20] earth with great wrath to look for the
[59:23] woman and for the remnant of her seed
[59:26] now here's where we get to what the
[59:28] prophet called the free threefold
[59:30] purpose of the sixth seal and the
[59:32] threefold purpose of the seventh seal
[59:34] now this is not just big words these are
[59:36] his words i believe they're important
[59:38] don't you
[59:40] now we find out also on the seventh seal
[59:42] who said that in this sixth seal now
[59:43] being open it was four or three full
[59:45] purpose here was the purposes the first
[59:47] thing was the sleeping virgin had to go
[59:50] through the tribulation period for
[59:52] purification now notice if the sleeping
[59:55] virgin was under the blood of the lord
[59:57] jesus as they say they are and the
[59:59] prophet of course tells us in the first
[1:00:01] seal they're not actually under the
[1:00:03] blood they think they are if they were
[1:00:06] under the blood there's no way they
[1:00:08] would need to go through a tribulation
[1:00:10] period to be purified
[1:00:12] the blood would make them absolutely
[1:00:14] sinless
[1:00:16] [Applause]
[1:00:18] so they think they're under the blood
[1:00:20] but they have to go through the
[1:00:22] tribulation period so the first fold of
[1:00:25] the revealing of this seal shows that
[1:00:27] they must be a people that will be
[1:00:29] purged so there's threefold purpose and
[1:00:31] the first one is that the gentile
[1:00:32] foolish virgin must be purged second
[1:00:35] fold of this is the 144 thousand must be
[1:00:38] purged third fold is that the earth
[1:00:40] itself must be purged this is the
[1:00:42] threefold purpose now he said the
[1:00:44] sleeping virgin had to go through the
[1:00:46] tribulation period for purification she
[1:00:48] had to be purged of her sins of unbelief
[1:00:52] and rejecting the bible
[1:00:55] the blood
[1:00:56] the cross
[1:00:58] god soul of the world he gave his only
[1:01:00] begotten son
[1:01:02] what
[1:01:04] the message
[1:01:05] the message
[1:01:07] this she was done in the tribulation
[1:01:09] period we say that wind up and
[1:01:11] revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th
[1:01:13] chapter she had been purged and she's
[1:01:16] been given white now notice this is the
[1:01:19] symbolism that they saw on the fifth
[1:01:20] seal she's given robes now she's not the
[1:01:23] bride but it's the church the pure
[1:01:26] people that didn't have the opportunity
[1:01:29] maybe to receive the message now in this
[1:01:32] other paragraph he said it was people
[1:01:34] that had to be washed and cleansed of
[1:01:35] their you know of the message itself so
[1:01:37] there's some that didn't receive it some
[1:01:40] that rejected it
[1:01:46] or in some way they were blinded by
[1:01:48] these false prophets and they didn't get
[1:01:50] a chance and yet they're really sincere
[1:01:52] in their heart and god knows their heart
[1:01:55] and hear their purge during this time so
[1:01:57] some will never hear about the message
[1:01:59] some will hear about it but they'll just
[1:02:01] not be bribed and they won't blaspheme
[1:02:04] and make all kinds of stupid websites
[1:02:06] and all kinds of things like that look
[1:02:08] for in some infos they've done across
[1:02:09] the line there's absolutely no mercy
[1:02:11] form at all
[1:02:13] no
[1:02:15] and god will give them blood to drink
[1:02:18] because they've crossed the line between
[1:02:20] mercy and judgment
[1:02:24] notice they're another purging time
[1:02:27] that's for israel when she gathers
[1:02:29] that's the second fold god purges israel
[1:02:31] and the tribulation period out of the
[1:02:33] millions that will gather there there'll
[1:02:36] be a selected 144 000 that's purged also
[1:02:40] god purging israel there's a whole earth
[1:02:43] is to be purged there will be such a
[1:02:45] thing as the moon the stars
[1:02:49] and all nature will be purged you see
[1:02:51] what it is the earth renewing herself
[1:02:54] being purged getting ready for the
[1:02:56] millennium the millennium coming up
[1:02:58] think of it friends no wonder that the
[1:03:00] atomic fire will have to burn the earth
[1:03:03] so deep wonder how many landfills that
[1:03:06] we've got on the earth they take our
[1:03:08] garbage and make mountains you drive
[1:03:10] right by the one over here and going to
[1:03:12] johnson city they turn that thing into a
[1:03:14] mountain as they keep on going i'm not
[1:03:16] sure mount everest even be able to
[1:03:18] compare to it and what is it garbage
[1:03:21] full of plastic full of this and that
[1:03:23] and the other can't you see why god is
[1:03:25] going to burn this thing off and leave
[1:03:27] not one trace of man
[1:03:30] god said them that destroy the earth he
[1:03:33] will destroy
[1:03:36] all right no tree hugger there's one
[1:03:38] tree i hug and that's the tree my lord
[1:03:39] jesus died on
[1:03:41] but i do believe that god has laws that
[1:03:43] we must live by
[1:03:45] now notice this in the fourth seal he
[1:03:47] said if we find out here that this satan
[1:03:49] after being kicked out of heaven he
[1:03:52] incarnates himself in the beast and now
[1:03:55] he is a beast antichrist false prophet
[1:03:57] now beasts given the name of death and
[1:03:59] hell follows him fully satan on his
[1:04:02] throne now this cannot happen as long as
[1:04:05] the bride is here and once the bride
[1:04:07] goes up then satan is able to move into
[1:04:10] the last phase of his kingdom the total
[1:04:13] embodiment of himself in the false
[1:04:16] prophet then he's given the heart of a
[1:04:19] beast now the head demon will be inside
[1:04:23] of this false prophet until satan is
[1:04:25] cast down so the mechanics will already
[1:04:27] be gone i'm sure i am totally convinced
[1:04:30] that while the mechanics for the bride
[1:04:32] are being operated and moved right now
[1:04:34] for the rapture the mechanics of hell
[1:04:36] are also being operated on the other
[1:04:38] side there ain't no telling what's going
[1:04:41] on amongst our government officials
[1:04:43] there ain't no telling what they're
[1:04:44] doing and what they're planted because
[1:04:46] the devil ain't gonna have long he's
[1:04:48] gonna do everything he can and he
[1:04:51] himself is busy up there trying to
[1:04:53] accuse you so he's seen his head demon
[1:04:56] whatever his name is he's got him down
[1:04:58] here and he's trying to manipulate and
[1:05:00] if this ain't the pope then it'll be the
[1:05:02] next one if it ain't happening it'll be
[1:05:03] the next one and he will no doubt get
[1:05:05] his message from the man himself and say
[1:05:08] this is him get in him and hold that
[1:05:11] house till i come down
[1:05:14] hold that house shall i come down and
[1:05:16] then he will be given the heart of a
[1:05:18] beast which is what the nature of satan
[1:05:21] this is the heart that cain had in the
[1:05:23] garden of eden y'all with me tonight
[1:05:24] this is the heart that cain had in the
[1:05:27] garden of eden this is why it would kill
[1:05:29] his brother he had the heart of a beast
[1:05:33] can't you see why people have no problem
[1:05:35] murdering babies can't you see why
[1:05:37] people have no problem taking a gun and
[1:05:40] killing 19 children and school teachers
[1:05:42] and all of that can't you see why mass
[1:05:44] killings are going on everywhere they're
[1:05:46] getting in the spirit what kind of
[1:05:49] spirit is it tribulation
[1:05:52] death sorrow anxiety suffering like this
[1:05:56] world has never never never known that
[1:05:58] there's another group of people on the
[1:06:01] earth they're not getting in the spirit
[1:06:03] of tribulation
[1:06:04] they're not getting in the spirit of
[1:06:06] murder they're not getting in the spirit
[1:06:08] of violation to the word of god but they
[1:06:11] are getting in the spirit of unity and
[1:06:13] harmony and love and fellowship they're
[1:06:17] getting ready for a body change they're
[1:06:20] getting ready to meet the lord jesus
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:29] notice this
[1:06:30] in this fourth seal it continues on now
[1:06:32] we find out here that this satan
[1:06:35] after being kicked out of heaven
[1:06:38] incarnates himself in the beast and now
[1:06:41] he's a beast antichrist false prophet
[1:06:44] and now beast and given the name of
[1:06:46] death and hell follows him fully satan
[1:06:48] on his throne oh my on the earth he's
[1:06:51] satan's representative on the earth
[1:06:54] that is now his head of the kingdoms of
[1:06:57] the world the very same kingdoms he
[1:07:00] offered the lord jesus
[1:07:03] in matthew 4.
[1:07:05] but it was beneath the lord jesus to
[1:07:07] take such trash to rule over
[1:07:12] well come on satan don't mind ruining
[1:07:14] over perverts and homosexuals and
[1:07:16] transgenders and all kind of kind of
[1:07:18] stuff
[1:07:19] now listen you're a homosexual can come
[1:07:20] to god and get saved a transgender can
[1:07:23] come to god and get saved get filled
[1:07:24] with the holy ghost they won't be trans
[1:07:26] no more they'll be changed they'll be
[1:07:28] transformed
[1:07:30] well wasn't that good
[1:07:33] they will be transformed come on church
[1:07:36] they will be changed by the power of god
[1:07:39] i don't believe in the jesus that this
[1:07:41] modern age has that they want to come to
[1:07:43] god as they are stay as they are go to
[1:07:46] heaven as they are there is no gay
[1:07:49] streets in heaven there will be no
[1:07:52] rainbow flags flying around in heaven it
[1:07:55] is the banner of the blood of the lord
[1:07:59] jesus that has changed us and loosed us
[1:08:03] and cleansed us from those vile things
[1:08:10] [Applause]
[1:08:14] paul wrote to some of them in the new
[1:08:16] testament
[1:08:17] whenever he said that they used to be
[1:08:19] effeminate
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:23] they used to be
[1:08:25] but not after they met jesus
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:31] so y'all believe in trans at your church
[1:08:33] we do
[1:08:34] transformed
[1:08:36] come on
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:42] we're living in a nation where many of
[1:08:44] our politicians are so scared to death
[1:08:46] of the people they can't even define
[1:08:48] what a woman is
[1:08:50] they can't even answer a simple question
[1:08:52] can a man get pregnant
[1:08:55] what in the world does it matter what in
[1:08:57] the world is going on hell is eking its
[1:09:00] way out
[1:09:02] don't you understand what it's doing and
[1:09:04] they laugh at god's word and life at
[1:09:06] god's people let them life we'll get the
[1:09:08] last one
[1:09:12] notice he says my satan now becomes full
[1:09:16] king
[1:09:18] now this happens later on he's false
[1:09:20] prophet now
[1:09:22] he will become beast
[1:09:24] after a while
[1:09:26] when he breaks his covenant there with
[1:09:27] the jews you know how we've been through
[1:09:30] it
[1:09:30] now notice he says he will be given a
[1:09:33] heart
[1:09:34] of a beast
[1:09:36] at that time and satan will incarnate
[1:09:39] himself because when the church goes up
[1:09:42] satan's cast out it's done then
[1:09:46] all of his accusing
[1:09:48] is done
[1:09:52] as long as the intercessor
[1:09:55] this is so
[1:09:57] phenomenal to me
[1:09:59] as long
[1:10:01] as the intercessor
[1:10:03] is on the throne look who's on the
[1:10:05] throne
[1:10:06] not a judge
[1:10:08] the intercessor himself
[1:10:11] no wonder he kept standing there before
[1:10:14] him and said this is a rigged trial
[1:10:18] this is rigged
[1:10:19] the judge ain't on the throne it's the
[1:10:22] intercessor himself
[1:10:24] the eternity their eternity is almost
[1:10:27] all out of the world do you expect me to
[1:10:29] ever win this case is that i don't
[1:10:32] and i tell you right now you ain't gonna
[1:10:34] win i've already won them's my people i
[1:10:38] represent my people
[1:10:43] as long as the intercessor is on the
[1:10:45] throne
[1:10:46] listen to this
[1:10:48] satan can stand there
[1:10:51] and accuse
[1:10:54] as long as the intercessor why hey it
[1:10:57] tells him
[1:10:58] the bride ain't here yet
[1:11:01] the intercessors on the throne
[1:11:04] that when he changes his clothes
[1:11:06] and changes and puts on the crown on his
[1:11:08] head
[1:11:09] spiritual we'll put it on natural
[1:11:11] but when he steps out of that roy he'll
[1:11:13] die you're dead
[1:11:15] satan says oh my time's limited now
[1:11:18] he don't know exactly he don't know
[1:11:20] exactly when the lord's coming he don't
[1:11:22] know how long it's going to be it's he
[1:11:23] got a year yeah 2 five ten he don't know
[1:11:26] but he knows when this takes place he's
[1:11:28] only got three and a half left
[1:11:31] so when he sees zach he said oh my
[1:11:34] then their sister left the throne today
[1:11:37] is rapture day
[1:11:40] the intercessor left the throne what's
[1:11:42] fixing to happen those i'm accusing
[1:11:44] fixing to come up on the song
[1:11:47] so they no longer need an intercessor
[1:11:49] but they're meeting him as their lovely
[1:11:51] bridegroom
[1:11:54] praise god
[1:11:56] as long as the intercessor is still on
[1:11:58] the throne satan can stand there and
[1:12:00] accuse because he is the attorney
[1:12:05] on the other side
[1:12:08] he's the opponent
[1:12:10] of christ
[1:12:12] and christ is standing there
[1:12:14] i love this little illustration
[1:12:16] the opponent is standing there saying by
[1:12:19] the way
[1:12:21] adam fell
[1:12:22] right
[1:12:23] i'd have done this
[1:12:25] can you imagine
[1:12:26] he's still
[1:12:28] accusing adam
[1:12:33] my lord i didn't wonder that he can sign
[1:12:34] there all these thousands of years look
[1:12:36] at all the accusations he's got to bring
[1:12:37] against all the people of god
[1:12:40] so if he's still accusing adam you can
[1:12:43] imagine what he's saying about us well
[1:12:45] that bunch of dirt bags sorry low down
[1:12:46] rotten good for nothing so and so but
[1:12:48] you got an attorney you've got an
[1:12:50] attorney
[1:12:52] oh hallelujah
[1:12:54] oh glory by the way
[1:12:56] i don't fall
[1:12:58] i've done this i've conquered him i got
[1:13:00] his wife to believe a lie as all them
[1:13:02] sayings he just said the truth
[1:13:06] was that a lie toll
[1:13:08] they fabricate that truth truths truth
[1:13:13] people that tell you the devil can't
[1:13:15] tell the truth have not studied the
[1:13:17] message far enough
[1:13:19] the biggest lie there's ever told has 90
[1:13:21] some percent truth to it
[1:13:24] notice
[1:13:25] i got his wife to believe a lie you said
[1:13:28] should be damned by it and i got it
[1:13:31] but here's the mediator standing there
[1:13:33] brother man gets pretty excited himself
[1:13:35] he says amen the kinsman redeemer amen
[1:13:38] standing now with the blood that can
[1:13:41] take the vilest sinner's heart and
[1:13:43] change it listen to this a mediator
[1:13:47] is on the throne
[1:13:50] wow what what a position to have on the
[1:13:53] throne of god not a judge not a jury a
[1:13:58] mediator why it's testifying that is our
[1:14:01] need because you see how blind some of
[1:14:03] the brothers are when they try to say it
[1:14:05] past in 1963 it didn't pass in 63 73 83
[1:14:10] 93 23 20 and 13 he's still here
[1:14:14] he's still there and it will be till
[1:14:16] that last one comes in and when the last
[1:14:19] one comes in and it's finished we're
[1:14:21] gone i'm going back on he said get out
[1:14:24] of here devil
[1:14:26] oh hallelujah get out of here devil
[1:14:29] leave my house my wife is coming home oh
[1:14:33] praise god my wife is coming on get out
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:46] man my first time to see jesus
[1:14:49] i don't want that long tongue lying
[1:14:51] false accuser standing eating this
[1:14:53] hitting us said don't worry donnie i'm
[1:14:55] going to take care of it
[1:15:01] when you get up the accused will be gone
[1:15:04] come on sweetie
[1:15:06] come on
[1:15:10] a mediator is on the strong yes sir
[1:15:13] satan is sad
[1:15:15] but they're guilty
[1:15:16] jesus said
[1:15:24] they don't listen to that but i forgive
[1:15:26] them
[1:15:27] i took care of that
[1:15:29] a mediator
[1:15:30] on the throne
[1:15:31] [Applause]
[1:15:37] but when that transition is made
[1:15:42] no more mercy
[1:15:46] now remember roose
[1:15:48] had a sustaining portion
[1:15:50] that she had kept back
[1:15:53] and she brought home and gave it
[1:15:55] to naomi
[1:15:56] that which was
[1:15:58] reserved
[1:16:00] and even though the lamb will leave the
[1:16:02] mediatorial seat
[1:16:04] he has reserved enough holy ghost
[1:16:07] for 144 thousand
[1:16:11] the jews brought it to us the gentiles
[1:16:13] will take it back to them it's reserved
[1:16:15] under our covenant
[1:16:19] hallelujah to god
[1:16:21] what will happen then
[1:16:23] all hell
[1:16:25] brexits
[1:16:29] i hope and pray to god
[1:16:32] that there's no one under the sound of
[1:16:33] my voice
[1:16:35] no one that will hear this service
[1:16:39] will experience what we're about to see
[1:16:43] here before us
[1:16:46] notice this the noise of naught and the
[1:16:48] prophet says now watch the spirit
[1:16:50] following there will come a time in the
[1:16:52] name of the lord
[1:16:54] the people will go completely
[1:16:57] insane
[1:16:59] the bible says so they'll scream and
[1:17:02] holler
[1:17:03] great hideous things
[1:17:06] in their imaginary mind
[1:17:08] radios and things and television
[1:17:10] programs
[1:17:12] are producing it
[1:17:14] there'll be such things as ants
[1:17:17] raised up on the earth
[1:17:19] as high as 14 trees
[1:17:24] there will be a bird that will fly
[1:17:26] across the earth
[1:17:28] with wings four or five miles across
[1:17:33] and people will see them they'll scream
[1:17:37] and holler
[1:17:39] and cry for mercy
[1:17:41] but it will be
[1:17:43] the plagues
[1:17:47] where do i preach on those plagues
[1:17:50] opening that
[1:17:55] the only reason
[1:17:56] you and i are not experiencing these
[1:17:59] things tonight
[1:18:03] it's because we have a mediator
[1:18:06] on the throne
[1:18:09] they see the only reason the earth
[1:18:11] itself the people of the world that's
[1:18:12] not even saved
[1:18:14] aren't experiencing this tonight
[1:18:16] is because our mediator
[1:18:19] is there
[1:18:22] our kinsmen redeemer now they don't know
[1:18:25] it
[1:18:26] they never acknowledge it
[1:18:29] but it's because of our tithe to him
[1:18:34] and his relationship with us
[1:18:38] is what's keeping this from happening
[1:18:41] and it will never happen as long as
[1:18:43] she's here
[1:18:44] because this does not fit what he has in
[1:18:47] mind for her he don't even want her
[1:18:49] around
[1:18:50] he don't even want her here when this
[1:18:52] stuff is happening all glory to god
[1:18:54] he loves her so much that's why i know
[1:18:57] with each passing day as we're getting
[1:18:58] closer and closer and closer and i saw a
[1:19:00] picture today
[1:19:02] to where in certain cities in russia
[1:19:05] that they have put up billboards just in
[1:19:07] the last few weeks
[1:19:09] showing the pictures of alaska
[1:19:12] joined of course to the top of the
[1:19:15] united states
[1:19:16] and they are saying we want it back
[1:19:20] it belongs to us
[1:19:22] and we're going to take it
[1:19:26] oh my goodness now you wonder what does
[1:19:29] mr putin have in his mind
[1:19:32] i ain't going to lose no sleep over it
[1:19:33] i've got enough stuff to lose sleep over
[1:19:35] i sure lose it over him
[1:19:39] well praise the lord
[1:19:40] but they're making all of these threats
[1:19:43] saying all of these things as i told the
[1:19:45] young people here monday night and
[1:19:46] speaking to them that
[1:19:48] china and russia are the only ones that
[1:19:51] have hypersonic missiles
[1:19:54] we tried one of ours about two weeks ago
[1:19:57] and it fell miserably into the sea
[1:20:00] so we have supersonic but not hypersonic
[1:20:03] which can travel over 7 900 miles per
[1:20:07] hour
[1:20:09] we have nothing that can intercept them
[1:20:12] nothing that can stop them
[1:20:15] except feathers
[1:20:19] and if you're under the wings of the
[1:20:21] heavenly father
[1:20:23] you'll be out of here before they ever
[1:20:25] take off
[1:20:26] they can't move fast enough if they put
[1:20:29] a hyper on their hyper and put that
[1:20:31] hyper hopper on steroids and then put
[1:20:34] another hyper hyper it can't move as
[1:20:36] fast as the twinkling of an eye
[1:20:42] they think hyper missiles can move fast
[1:20:45] they ain't seen nothing yet until i get
[1:20:47] out of the bed one morning and i'm
[1:20:50] kidding everything boy my back sore and
[1:20:52] my feet sore and this is sore and all of
[1:20:55] a sudden i'll stand there and i'll see
[1:20:58] myself and i'll be an 18 year old man
[1:21:01] and that'll be my beautiful wife an 18
[1:21:04] year old woman and say to say wow it's
[1:21:07] on it's all
[1:21:09] [Applause]
[1:21:10] right
[1:21:11] i'm faster than a hypersonic missile we
[1:21:15] will be caught up together to meet the
[1:21:17] lord in the air
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:31] this is going to be a very paradoxical
[1:21:35] type of service tonight
[1:21:39] you're going to feel a little bit of
[1:21:40] hell
[1:21:41] and a whole lot of heaven
[1:21:44] or you're going to feel a whole lot of
[1:21:45] hell and a little bit of heaven just
[1:21:47] depending on who you are
[1:21:50] myself i'd like a whole lot of heaven
[1:21:52] stuff
[1:21:54] just let me hear enough about health and
[1:21:55] we'll kind of know what's there and all
[1:21:56] that sort of thing you know i'm gonna
[1:21:57] say i need my home i didn't come from
[1:21:59] hell i ain't going back to hell i don't
[1:22:01] want nothing to do with it jesus went to
[1:22:02] hell so i don't have to
[1:22:06] [Applause]
[1:22:12] anybody ever find a series where i
[1:22:13] preached on hell
[1:22:18] anybody
[1:22:19] a serious why i preached on hell
[1:22:20] [Music]
[1:22:22] and now we're preaching a series on
[1:22:26] why should i take a series on hell when
[1:22:28] we can go back to the future home and
[1:22:29] take another series on that
[1:22:37] notice revelation 15 5
[1:22:40] and after that i looked
[1:22:43] behold
[1:22:44] the temple
[1:22:47] of the tabernacle
[1:22:50] of the testimony in heaven
[1:22:54] was opened
[1:22:56] what peculiar phraseology
[1:22:59] that he chooses to say this with
[1:23:03] the temple
[1:23:04] of the tabernacle
[1:23:06] of the testimony
[1:23:08] in heaven
[1:23:11] the temple
[1:23:12] of the tabernacle of the testimony in
[1:23:14] heaven
[1:23:16] was opened
[1:23:18] and the seven angels came out
[1:23:21] of the temple
[1:23:23] having the seven plagues
[1:23:27] ah
[1:23:29] so what had been happening before this
[1:23:33] how come they didn't come before
[1:23:36] the attorney was on the mediatorial
[1:23:38] throne
[1:23:40] but see now him
[1:23:42] and the bride
[1:23:44] are at that great old big table
[1:23:48] some of y'all think you've had
[1:23:49] receptions and we've seen some nice ones
[1:23:51] around down here haven't we you ain't
[1:23:53] seen nothing yet
[1:23:55] oh
[1:23:56] praise god
[1:23:58] it's amazing because this is going on
[1:24:01] where we are
[1:24:03] in that new place
[1:24:06] and over here in the temple of the
[1:24:08] tabernacle of the testimony plagues
[1:24:12] are issuing forth from these seven
[1:24:14] angels
[1:24:15] and we're all just over here eating
[1:24:18] laughing
[1:24:19] rejoicing
[1:24:21] well not wonderful this week about the
[1:24:23] lord giving us that about laughing in
[1:24:24] heaven
[1:24:25] oh i thought that was so awesome i've
[1:24:27] been trying it out a little bit this
[1:24:29] week just see what it's going to be like
[1:24:31] can you imagine friend where there's a
[1:24:33] place nobody will ever frown
[1:24:36] there'll never be anybody with just a
[1:24:38] grim serious look on their face but
[1:24:41] everybody will be so happy it will be a
[1:24:43] degree of happiness that we have never
[1:24:46] known our sister brown my goodness if
[1:24:48] she could speak to us from the other
[1:24:50] side here tonight can you imagine she's
[1:24:52] done met the prophet she done met
[1:24:54] brother daniel nunley they probably
[1:24:56] shouted a little bit together her and
[1:24:57] brother jim bath they've done one of you
[1:25:00] know around and around through them
[1:25:01] green fields of blue grass my my hair
[1:25:04] and sister mary and on and on and on
[1:25:06] brother gene lehman and oh my we've had
[1:25:08] so many to go on we're getting more over
[1:25:10] there and we got left here it's getting
[1:25:12] about going home time i figure
[1:25:14] oh hallelujah
[1:25:17] hallelujah
[1:25:18] can you imagine right in that other
[1:25:20] dimension when the prophet was carried
[1:25:22] down beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:25:24] i looked right there in my body and it
[1:25:25] said it wasn't 20 foot from where it was
[1:25:28] right in another dimension not the way
[1:25:30] we'd measure it with the measuring tape
[1:25:32] that's dimensional travel that you move
[1:25:34] beyond see taste feel smell and hear and
[1:25:37] the prophet was in that sixth dimension
[1:25:39] looking back at his body on the bed and
[1:25:41] he said you mean i've got to go back
[1:25:43] into that think of it he was about 51
[1:25:45] years old 51 years old probably pretty
[1:25:47] healthy at the time what would he say
[1:25:49] about the age that we're in if he would
[1:25:51] call that body that oh no it surely is a
[1:25:54] past house is it not i can't wait i
[1:25:56] don't know about you i can't wait to get
[1:25:58] rid of these gray hairs
[1:26:00] i can't wait to get rid of these
[1:26:02] wrinkles i can't wait to get to the
[1:26:03] river this old age and get on a body
[1:26:06] that'll never change it'll never die it
[1:26:08] will never rot and it will never be
[1:26:10] corrupt why do you have that confidence
[1:26:12] because that quickening power lives in
[1:26:14] me tonight it has quickened me to the
[1:26:16] word and it's still quickening me to the
[1:26:18] world and if i do wrong my intercessor
[1:26:22] lives within me and he lets me know
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:40] and the seven angels came out of the
[1:26:42] temple
[1:26:45] having the seven plagues
[1:26:50] closed
[1:26:57] captioning not
[1:27:03] or a available or a measurement or a
[1:27:05] numeric number
[1:27:07] there's always a significance there
[1:27:10] so i want you to notice where the
[1:27:11] judgment
[1:27:12] is coming from
[1:27:14] the tabernacle
[1:27:16] the witness
[1:27:17] it's not being administered
[1:27:20] by gangs
[1:27:22] it's not being administered by the mafia
[1:27:25] it's not being administered by cartels
[1:27:29] but by the holy
[1:27:30] pure sinless angels
[1:27:34] of almighty god
[1:27:37] now this staggers people because they
[1:27:38] don't understand
[1:27:40] god's justice
[1:27:42] is pure
[1:27:44] unlike ours
[1:27:47] anybody in here ever want to get revenge
[1:27:49] on somebody i'll close my house soon
[1:27:54] but tom you're going to admit to that
[1:27:55] lord have mercy
[1:27:57] dear god help our poor brother
[1:28:03] how many's ever got revenge
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:11] and no doubt we bore that revengeful
[1:28:14] look
[1:28:15] and we felt happy
[1:28:17] before we felt so bad
[1:28:19] but notice how god despice the openers
[1:28:23] of these plagues
[1:28:26] they're not cartel they're not foul
[1:28:29] corrupt
[1:28:31] their attire represents their position
[1:28:35] and their purity as administering
[1:28:38] this justice to god now this is
[1:28:40] important to god that god would convey
[1:28:43] this about this administration because
[1:28:46] many people read this and look at it as
[1:28:48] mean and hateful it is not mean at
[1:28:54] all you see if god would have chosen to
[1:28:57] give me holy justice
[1:29:00] if i had not accept his holy pardon
[1:29:04] in reality i would have nothing to say
[1:29:07] because i deserved it but i accept his
[1:29:11] pardon and by accepting his pardon it
[1:29:14] canceled out the justice that was
[1:29:16] against me
[1:29:17] [Applause]
[1:29:18] amen
[1:29:20] now watch so they're clothed in pure and
[1:29:22] white linen
[1:29:24] having their breasts which is up this
[1:29:26] part of the body the torso up here
[1:29:28] higher rather
[1:29:30] and having their breasts girded with
[1:29:32] golden girdle so this is an ephod
[1:29:35] sort of like the high priest war so it
[1:29:38] was a symbolism and they would have it
[1:29:40] around them up high kind of right down
[1:29:43] under their arms and down to about their
[1:29:44] waist so their white garments are pure
[1:29:47] and white flax and i've told you before
[1:29:49] that about this time frame egyptian
[1:29:52] linen was worth more than gold
[1:29:54] it was so pure
[1:29:56] that they say it would glisten people
[1:29:58] who walked in this egyptian linen would
[1:30:01] come from the river nile and the sun
[1:30:03] would shine on it it's like their
[1:30:05] garments would glisten they were so
[1:30:07] white which is a great symbol of purity
[1:30:10] so they were tired in the manner of
[1:30:14] clothes that was fitting
[1:30:16] to their position
[1:30:19] and so is the bride
[1:30:22] now watch in verse seven and one of the
[1:30:24] four beasts
[1:30:25] now watch they've been four beasts which
[1:30:28] was the four powers administering down
[1:30:30] through the church ages
[1:30:32] and one of the four beasts
[1:30:36] gave unto the seven angels
[1:30:39] seven golden vials
[1:30:42] or bowls
[1:30:44] seven golden vials
[1:30:47] full
[1:30:48] of the wrath of god
[1:30:52] now these folks that's on the earth not
[1:30:54] only have the devil that's come down and
[1:30:56] he's pretty upset
[1:30:58] but they have god
[1:30:59] administering vials of judgment
[1:31:06] notice now they are full
[1:31:09] so imagine in your mind one angel one
[1:31:11] two three four five six seven so one of
[1:31:13] the four beasts hands each angel
[1:31:16] a vial
[1:31:17] or a plague to turn loose
[1:31:20] on the inhabitants
[1:31:22] on the earth
[1:31:24] and the temple
[1:31:26] was filled with smoke
[1:31:29] but notice what from
[1:31:31] not from the sacrifice
[1:31:34] but from the glory shechena
[1:31:38] the shekinas which said
[1:31:40] from the glory of god
[1:31:45] you understand that this does not convey
[1:31:47] a an image
[1:31:49] of a god that's like some mean angry
[1:31:52] hateful guy and then we measure god's
[1:31:54] wrath by ours and we think how we lose
[1:31:56] our temper whatever we do that's not the
[1:31:58] way god is at all
[1:32:00] god is the only being who has wrath
[1:32:03] that is so holy
[1:32:05] god don't have to repent after he gets
[1:32:07] done whooping somebody
[1:32:10] you see god never loses his temper in
[1:32:12] the sense of having to come out i'm so
[1:32:14] sorry i shouldn't have said that you
[1:32:15] know i mean i i've already just lost my
[1:32:16] cool god has never lost his school one
[1:32:18] time and he is mr cool himself
[1:32:20] so he's been around before anybody else
[1:32:22] was and yet he's punished people he's
[1:32:23] done all kinds of things but he's never
[1:32:25] had to come back and be able to offer
[1:32:26] sacrifice but here the god wants us to
[1:32:29] see through the revelator
[1:32:31] that this judgment of god is justly
[1:32:34] given
[1:32:38] lord god
[1:32:42] and the temple was filled with smoke
[1:32:44] from the glory of god
[1:32:45] and from his power
[1:32:48] and no man was able to enter into the
[1:32:50] temple
[1:32:53] now wait a minute
[1:32:54] so this stuff is going on in the temple
[1:32:58] and the bride
[1:33:00] is having this
[1:33:02] great celebration
[1:33:04] at the marriage supper of the
[1:33:06] lamb well you say how in the world is
[1:33:09] that even possible well let's just say

[1:37:59] just that human voice and that human
[1:38:03] touch
[1:38:04] of his shepherd
[1:38:06] helped bring him out of that place
[1:38:08] and that's just a man
[1:38:11] can you imagine what it'll be
[1:38:13] when the great master walks out brother
[1:38:15] joel

[1:38:29] i mean we're just so happy and we're so
[1:38:31] free and and we're just so pleasant and
[1:38:35] all hell's breaking news down here
[1:38:38] don't you see it all depends
[1:38:40] on who you are
[1:38:42] and where you're at
[1:38:50] can i have a few moments
[1:38:57] and i heard a great voice
[1:38:59] revelation 16 1
[1:39:02] out of the temple saying to the seven
[1:39:03] angels go your ways
[1:39:06] and pour out the vows of the wrath of
[1:39:09] god
[1:39:12] upon the earth
[1:39:15] and the first went
[1:39:17] and poured out his vial
[1:39:20] upon the earth and there fell annoys
[1:39:22] some
[1:39:24] and grievous sore
[1:39:28] upon the men
[1:39:30] which had the mark of the beast
[1:39:34] and upon them which worshipped his image
[1:39:43] i found this word
[1:39:45] overwhelming today
[1:39:47] worshiped
[1:39:51] to kiss
[1:39:53] like a dog licking
[1:39:55] his masters
[1:40:05] to kiss the hand towards one
[1:40:08] in token
[1:40:10] of reference
[1:40:12] holy father
[1:40:19] but instead of you kissing that hand
[1:40:23] god has let you kiss
[1:40:25] the son
[1:40:31] you see he said
[1:40:33] kiss the son in the book of psalms kiss
[1:40:35] the son
[1:40:36] lest
[1:40:37] he be angry
[1:40:39] with thee
[1:40:42] were it not for the grace of god brother
[1:40:43] larry
[1:40:44] we would be bowing down
[1:40:47] kissing
[1:40:48] the hat
[1:40:50] but instead
[1:40:52] we'll be bound down
[1:40:55] kissing
[1:40:56] the feet
[1:40:59] oh jesus
[1:41:02] oh jesus
[1:41:07] jesus
[1:41:10] i love you

[1:41:30] oh i knew your eyes would be wonderful
[1:41:35] i didn't know they would be that
[1:41:36] powerful
[1:41:38] your hair
[1:41:40] your feet your fingers
[1:41:44] thank you
[1:41:46] thank you for loving me
[1:41:50] and jesus might say donny
[1:41:53] thank you
[1:41:56] for loving me
[1:41:58] oh my
[1:42:04] thank you
[1:42:06] for giving me your life
[1:42:10] thank you for
[1:42:12] letting me use you
[1:42:16] i was saying
[1:42:18] you ain't got nothing to thank me for
[1:42:20] i'm just an unworthy servant he said but
[1:42:22] you see you and i
[1:42:25] are partners together
[1:42:28] i needed somebody
[1:42:30] to preach my word
[1:42:33] and you were living
[1:42:36] you were willing to forfeit
[1:42:38] whatever it took
[1:42:41] oh the lord
[1:42:42] lord honey don't look at me
[1:42:46] thank you
[1:42:48] i loved you donnie
[1:42:50] before you loved me
[1:42:54] i had you in my mind there's a little
[1:42:56] seed
[1:42:59] and i took a picture of you
[1:43:01] when you was at your best
[1:43:04] and while we're just
[1:43:06] enjoying all this
[1:43:08] the people on the earth are screaming
[1:43:11] hollering
[1:43:14] they're broke out and sores
[1:43:17] because
[1:43:19] they took on the mark of the beast
[1:43:23] catholicism
[1:43:25] and protestantism
[1:43:28] you see every person that's baptized in
[1:43:30] the titles of father son the holy ghost
[1:43:33] is baptized into the catholic church
[1:43:39] many of the protestants will never bow
[1:43:41] down to the pope's ring but they bowed
[1:43:43] down to the pope's doctrine
[1:43:45] i wish some of our protestant brothers
[1:43:47] would go back and just study a little
[1:43:49] bit historically and find out what some
[1:43:51] of these illegitimate popes
[1:43:54] have said down through the years about
[1:43:56] your bible
[1:44:00] they don't believe that a bible a bit
[1:44:01] more than you believe a funny book is
[1:44:03] the gospel then you'd take a cartoon
[1:44:05] book
[1:44:06] they do not believe god's word
[1:44:14] hallelujah
[1:44:17] notice let me
[1:44:18] close so they pour out the vial upon the
[1:44:21] earth and their fell annoys them which
[1:44:23] is wicked
[1:44:25] and grievous sore and where did this
[1:44:28] come from
[1:44:30] the tabernacle
[1:44:32] the temple and the tabernacle and the
[1:44:35] testimony
[1:44:38] having that come out of the house of god
[1:44:42] stored up wrath
[1:44:46] and why didn't that have your name on it
[1:44:49] because the container that come out of
[1:44:51] the house of god with your name on it
[1:44:54] salvation
[1:45:08] man which had the mark of the beast and
[1:45:10] upon them which worshipped
[1:45:12] his image the meaning of this word on
[1:45:14] down let's look at the rest of it before
[1:45:15] we close in the new testament
[1:45:18] by kneeling or prostration to do homage
[1:45:23] to one
[1:45:24] make obeisance
[1:45:26] whether in order to express
[1:45:28] respect or to make
[1:45:31] supplication
[1:45:34] years and years ago
[1:45:37] brother george smith and i was down in
[1:45:38] mexico
[1:45:43] had a service in a little old church
[1:45:46] they wanted prayer
[1:45:49] people started coming up
[1:45:51] one after another after another the lord
[1:45:53] doing great things among them
[1:45:55] and it started with one woman
[1:45:58] one woman came up
[1:46:00] and bowed on her knee
[1:46:03] and took me by the hand
[1:46:07] and i felt like somebody had poured cold
[1:46:10] water
[1:46:11] all over me
[1:46:15] and i told brother george i said brother
[1:46:16] george tell them to stop
[1:46:20] and he said it's just respect i said it
[1:46:22] may be respect but i don't think it
[1:46:24] pleases the lord
[1:46:26] another come up another i told him i
[1:46:28] said tell them to stop
[1:46:31] just walk up before us and let us pray
[1:46:36] i wonder how many people bow to a man in
[1:46:38] the message
[1:46:43] people feel allegiance to this man or
[1:46:45] that man and let this man or that man
[1:46:48] talk them out of the will of god
[1:46:50] because they love a man more than they
[1:46:52] love jesus christ
[1:46:55] we owe obeisance to no man
[1:46:59] no worship to no man
[1:47:01] god's word is first
[1:47:08] [Applause]
[1:47:15] we'll pick it up lord one next sunday
[1:47:17] night but verse 3 says and the second
[1:47:19] angel
[1:47:20] poured out his vial upon the sea
[1:47:23] and it became as the blood
[1:47:25] of a dead man
[1:47:27] and every living
[1:47:30] soul
[1:47:32] died
[1:47:33] in the sea now don't that word soul
[1:47:35] stumble you because it's the same word
[1:47:37] that is used in yesh
[1:47:38] the same word that is used for living
[1:47:40] being so it's the same word used as
[1:47:42] spirit
[1:47:44] so everything in the sea
[1:47:47] dies
[1:47:48] and the blood the sea
[1:47:50] turns into blood but not just blood with
[1:47:53] life
[1:47:55] but blood after the life has left it
[1:47:57] which is coagulated
[1:48:00] and turns black
[1:48:02] and it becomes clotted people here in
[1:48:04] the medical field no more better than i
[1:48:06] would
[1:48:07] but it's this blood
[1:48:09] representation
[1:48:11] of a dead man
[1:48:13] a dead earth
[1:48:15] a dead kingdom
[1:48:20] and while this is going on down here
[1:48:23] here you are still eating
[1:48:25] worshipping
[1:48:27] praising
[1:48:29] isn't it amazing
[1:48:31] but in one way when you think about it
[1:48:33] and you put it all together
[1:48:36] in a in a smaller way
[1:48:39] that's going on right now
[1:48:41] people have gathered on wednesday night
[1:48:43] for wednesday night service all
[1:48:45] different kinds of churches around here
[1:48:47] right
[1:48:48] some of them some of the women come to
[1:48:50] church and many skirts some of the men
[1:48:51] come to church and shorts and some of
[1:48:52] the women come to church and shorts and
[1:48:54] they come dressed like everything
[1:48:55] looking like everything no telling one
[1:48:57] little bit of something another that
[1:48:59] they'll get to try to sustain them
[1:49:01] and here we've come tonight and we've
[1:49:04] had a feast of god's word set right
[1:49:05] before us
[1:49:09] we've been called up for just a little
[1:49:10] bit out of our worries and our troubles
[1:49:13] and you know what i'm saying let me know
[1:49:14] i mean so we've just been called up for
[1:49:16] it for a little while into his presence
[1:49:19] and we feel like we can face any
[1:49:21] challenge we can do anything that lays
[1:49:23] before us
[1:49:24] this is only a pre-figure
[1:49:26] of what you're fixing to experience
[1:49:28] full time
[1:49:31] can you imagine full-time glory
[1:49:34] full-time presence
[1:49:36] full-time peace
[1:49:39] full-time anointing full-time shekinah
[1:49:43] won't that be us
[1:49:45] full time
[1:49:48] [Applause]
[1:49:56] think of it
[1:49:57] were it not for the grace of god to us
[1:50:01] when this vial is poured out
[1:50:03] we would be here
[1:50:05] the name on that sign down there could
[1:50:06] be whatever
[1:50:09] worship in the image
[1:50:10] it could be a catholic church
[1:50:12] i could be standing up here tonight as a
[1:50:14] priest
[1:50:17] whatever it is i said
[1:50:19] serving you the holy eucharist you can't
[1:50:21] imagine me it's a priest can you i can't
[1:50:23] either
[1:50:25] i can't imagine you as a catholic by the
[1:50:26] time you're way too noisy
[1:50:30] but why ain't we

[1:50:48] been a whole lot better off even though
[1:50:49] it wasn't abraham just stick around
[1:50:51] abraham you get some real good influence
[1:50:53] yeah
[1:50:56] you're better off to hang around and
[1:50:57] even if you know well if i don't believe
[1:50:58] about god i'm leaving i'm going out in
[1:51:00] the world i'd rather hang around abraham
[1:51:02] myself
[1:51:03] that way you might not might not wind up
[1:51:05] having incest with your two kids
[1:51:09] well praise the lord
[1:51:12] it's such a privilege just to hang
[1:51:14] around the people of god
[1:51:16] much less to be one
[1:51:19] henry wants to be ready
[1:51:22] with all of your heart
[1:51:25] praise the lord
[1:51:28] praise the lord
[1:51:31] lord jesus
[1:51:33] in humility
[1:51:35] and thanksgiving
[1:51:37] we bow our heads tonight in your
[1:51:38] presence
[1:51:41] thanking you
[1:51:44] praise god
[1:51:47] that what come out
[1:51:49] of the temple
[1:51:51] for us
[1:51:53] was not plagues
[1:51:56] bowls
[1:51:57] vials of wrath
[1:52:00] but a bloody lamb
[1:52:04] praise god
[1:52:06] brother branham said why john
[1:52:09] didn't see it because he had done look
[1:52:11] back in there
[1:52:12] but you were hit
[1:52:14] back in the eternities
[1:52:17] and john looked right at that great holy
[1:52:19] being sitting on the throne of god
[1:52:22] but christ the mystery of course was hid
[1:52:24] in the very heart of god
[1:52:27] and john looked when the elder said the
[1:52:30] line of the tribe of judah hath
[1:52:31] prevailed
[1:52:32] and here come walking this attribute
[1:52:36] and it left john puzzled he thought
[1:52:38] i've done a look through heaven i looked
[1:52:40] everywhere i looked around the throne
[1:52:42] how did i miss this
[1:52:44] but the heart of god opened up
[1:52:47] and you walked out
[1:52:50] praise god
[1:52:53] and when the heart of god opened up you
[1:52:55] walked out
[1:52:57] and we walked out with you
[1:53:00] for we are that love part of you
[1:53:04] oh jesus

[1:53:35] and we are so grateful
[1:53:38] spiritual death
[1:53:40] is in the land
[1:53:42] this natural death was the last plague
[1:53:44] that hit egypt
[1:53:46] so the prophet tells us spiritual death
[1:53:48] is the last plague
[1:53:50] that will hit the church
[1:53:52] and it's all around us
[1:53:55] lord god keep us alive i pray

[1:54:42] brown shoes and
[1:54:43] a black belt and you've got on blue
[1:54:46] jeans and blue shirt

[1:54:54] in another garment
[1:54:57] he took away your garment of
[1:54:59] condemnation
[1:55:00] and he gave you a garment of praise
[1:55:04] he took away your filthy garments
[1:55:08] zechariah
[1:55:10] and he's clothed you
[1:55:12] as a priest of god
[1:55:14] for as long as he stood there with him
[1:55:16] filthy garments on
[1:55:18] satan was able to accuse him
[1:55:21] but the voice spoke out of heaven and
[1:55:23] said
[1:55:24] change his garments
[1:55:26] remove his garments
[1:55:28] and when the garments was changed
[1:55:30] the accusation stopped
[1:55:34] hallelujah
[1:55:36] so let us not raise our hands here
[1:55:37] tonight as sinners
[1:55:40] let us not approach god tonight as

[1:55:48] we'll we'll pray with you and lead you
[1:55:49] to the lord
[1:55:51] but as children of god

[1:56:37] if we're so close that the angels

[1:56:44] a wonder long as the lamb of course is
[1:56:46] in there they cannot go in vows and
[1:56:50] mercy cannot be mixed
[1:56:52] but i wonder if it's so close
[1:56:55] they're standing near
[1:56:58] and that great power one of the four
[1:57:00] beasts
[1:57:02] were discharged to them the plagues to

[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:35] praise the lord
[2:03:40] you wonder just how close it is
[2:03:44] when your pastor starts preaching about
[2:03:46] it
[2:03:48] and you see the things that's happening
[2:03:50] upon the earth fulfilling the scriptures
[2:03:51] and them fulfilling
[2:03:53] that part to spoken of them then you
[2:03:56] know there's a people on the earth
[2:03:57] that's fulfilling this part that's
[2:03:59] spoken
[2:04:00] amen
[2:04:03] can you
[2:04:06] we'll have to have a body change
[2:04:09] can you imagine
[2:04:12] that it's more real than this
[2:04:15] but we look to the unseen things
[2:04:18] for we do not understand with the eyes
[2:04:20] of our head
[2:04:22] but we understand with the eyes of our
[2:04:24] heart
[2:04:27] amen
[2:04:28] there's just something
[2:04:30] about going home
[2:04:32] i don't care where you're at brother
[2:04:34] brother david some brothers used to
[2:04:36] laugh at me and when the meetings was
[2:04:37] over i'd be throwing my stuff in a
[2:04:38] suitcase because there's just something
[2:04:41] about going home
[2:04:45] i feel the pool don't you friends
[2:04:48] and you know when you think about it
[2:04:50] the things we heard tonight
[2:04:52] we're going to be one place or the other
[2:04:54] that's right
[2:04:56] and i don't think we're hearing about it
[2:04:58] because he's telling us we're going to
[2:04:59] be there but i
[2:05:01] i think he's telling us this is where
[2:05:02] you belong
[2:05:04] and young people don't let the devil lie
[2:05:05] to you
[2:05:07] don't let the devil tell you you've
[2:05:08] sinned away your day of grace or you've
[2:05:10] stumped your toe
[2:05:12] don't listen to that
[2:05:14] listen to your heart
[2:05:16] listen to the word that speaks to you it
