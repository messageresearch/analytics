he could not roll back the time child when you look back you're going to find there was never a [Music] time and child when you look back you're going to find there was never a Time [Applause] never a [Music] time how many can say Amen to that tonight there's been a lot of times I've been wondering where he was that which direction he went and that you'd like to hear from him even if it was just slap you up to side of the head but you know that he's always faithful he's always there to help us praise the Lord so GL see each one of you tonight grateful for the opportunity we can be gathered together on a Wednesday night to be able to Fellowship around the word and have fellowship with our brothers and sisters that we're going to spend eternity with let's turn to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 if you would Lord willing may be having U question answers again tomorrow night 1 Thessalonians 4:13 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope how sad for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord how could Paul presume to say this that he had the word of the Lord quite simple he knew he was a prophet now Peter never says this nor Matthew Mark Luke nor John Paul is the only one in the New Testament Lord willing I may not get to it tomorrow night but one of our youth had asked a question about prophets and how we believe that brother Brenham was a prophet and sent from God they wasn't debating it they just wanted to be able to explain it to other people but I had quite a time enjoyable time going all the way from the book of Genesis all the way through the Old Testament all the way through the new to the end of the book of Revelation looking at the word Prophet prophets prophesy prophesied the word of the Lord came to so and so the word of the Lord came to so and so I already believed it anyway but after I got done with that search I mean I really believed it but I imagine what people think honestly whenever they read stuff like this that don't believe in prophets and they think the law and the prophets were on to John and they quote that scripture and they think that means there are known prophets in the New Testament well if that is so Paul is a liar Ain none of us believe that are they why don't we believe that CU we believe he was a prophet a word Prophet this we say unto you by the word of the Lord now remember the word only comes to the prophet it can't come to me it can't come to brother Daryl and the rest of ministers here KN the rest of the ministers in the message the way it does a prophet that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout an order command specifically a stimulating cry a signal is given to men a commander with a loud summons a trumpet call for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up caught up catch up take up by force catch away to seize amen carry off by force claim for one's self eagerly to snatch out or away that's what we're waiting for to be snatched out that's right to be caught up praise the Lord then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words how many wants to be ready for that great hour let's pray together you have a need something that you're petition before the Lord tonight just hold it to in your heart oh our blessed father it is our hope your Prophet told us in question and answers 1964 that far back that many years ago the only hope for the church is the coming of the Lord Jesus if he were alive tonight what would he say he was Brokenhearted whenever he was here how dark that it had got over the Earth and in that prophetic Realm by Vision as far as he could see was 1977 so by that he predicted not prophesied predicted that the Rapture would come by then so if that be true and we believe that it is then we have been in a place of Darkness that was so dark that even a prophet couldn't find no rays of light so from 77 on to 2024 it has been so dark it's no wonder Lord we feel so alone sometimes in this crazy world that we're living people around us have lost their minds the world was groping in Insanity in 1965 what are they tonight we can pretty well tell by the way they drive by the way they act by the way they dress they're not sure if they're a man a woman or a boy or a girl they just don't know anymore Lord thank you for light thank you for Grace on our lives oh Jesus we're not here tonight to stick our noses up in the air as it were and say look at us but we're here to Bow our heads to the death of the earth and say thank you for Grace thank you for your grace on our lives speak to us tonight from your word father and we pray as you told us to pray pray you therefore always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man Grant it tonight father in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you Saints you may be seated 1 Corinthians 15:54 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory I know I commented on it last Wednesday night but it is so great I want to comment on it again that that scripture not being fulfilled completely in the days of the Lord Jesus himself whenever he raised and when all of those Saints of Matthew 27:53 were raised from the dead and yet this scripture will be fulfilled in its completion not even in the Millennium now remember the Millennium will begin with a great res Resurrection there will be millions of people that will be raised in the Millennium not in glorified bodies but in human bodies you may wonder sometimes where part of the aborted babies will be now remember they never had a chance to choose no doubt they will come up in the Millennium those who never had the opportunity to hear God kept them from hearing if you can understand that they will be given the opportunity to make their choice in the Millennium not under the dispensation of Son of God which is baptism of the Holy Ghost not under the dispensation of son of man which is prophetic but under the dispensation of the son of David they will be given the opportunity to make up their mind in the millenum I know it may may be nearly impossible for us to comprehend that anybody in the right mind would choose not to serve him people will no longer be dying people will be constantly renewing their youth people will be living for a thousand years people will be made of course not to war there will be no more battles no more fussing no more arguing no more fighting none of that sort of thing it'll be under the davidic reign of Jesus as the son of David and yet at the end of that Reign millions of people they may have subjected themselves under his Reign but at the end of that when Satan will be loosed out of his prison for a little season they will choose to follow the devil after living on the earth for a thousand years no one ever no one ever since the fall of Man man Adam lived to be 930 methusa 969 the oldest man we have recorded in history or in the Bible 969 years old no one ever Liv to be a thousand years but yet in the Millennium they will be given that opportunity and God will supernaturally raise them from the dead at the beginning of the Millennium and will sustain their Earthly bodies for a thousand years every day they will be living on the extended grace of God a reversal of old age they won't even be aging they won't be dying there'll be no hospitals there'll be no first aid there'll be nobody with a broken arm I mean those those things are just nonexistent the the the r the rivers that have been polluted have been poisoned will actually become alive whenever he stands upon the mount there and divides it from the hinder part and the lower part there will actually come a breaking forth of a stream which will run directly toward the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea will come alive the Dead Sea will have a resurrection the lowest place on the earth and Ezekiel even talks about the fish and going down there and they will pull fish from the Dead Sea any of you that's ever been there know no fish lives there so much salt content in the water that whenever you go there you can't drown you can't drown in the Red Sea when we were there several years ago many of the people that was there Carol different ones went down there well you can float like a bottle stopper on top of it because you can't go down the buoyancy that it gives you but they will exceed a resurrection of the Dead Sea they will see such phenomenal things every day of their life no Wars no no Mayors there ain't going to be no fussing and fighting no drunk drivers there'll be none of that sort of thing even existing and they'll see it every day they will be living in a place to where the word the weather will absolutely be perfect the temperature will be absolutely phenomenal and it will be the sun will B would be seven times brighter than it is right now according to the book of Isaiah and the the waters will become so pure all the inhabitants of the earth and the knowledge of the Lord will cover the face of the sea as the waters do and there will be such a Time on the earth and they will live under this jurisdiction of the son of man and at the end of it they will say I hate you Jesus I hate you I hate your kingdom I hate this miracle stuff I hate everything you've done I'm going over with the devil you think how in the world can people do that and it shows you that the blessings of God Alone will never change people's lives living for a thousand years will not change their perception of who he is and yet look at the contrast between them and you so you're born Immortal from the day you start your life you struggle some of you have struggled from day one when you become a Christian your family turned against you your your friends your loved ones you've been reproached you've been lied upon you've been ridiculed you've been called a cult you've been oh my the things that you've been through and serving the lord Jesus and you've got a greater determination to serve him than you've ever had in your life and he's not offering you a flowery bed of East he's not offering you a Garden of Eden he's not even telling you that all right I'm going to keep you you serve me and I'll keep you exempt from trouble from heartache from all that but he tells you if you serve me the world's going to hate you the devil's going to hate you when you get the Holy Ghost it's like a big Target gets put on your back and me knows what I'm talking about and it seem like everybody you talk to in the day and the hour that we're living they're just barely barely able to get over one trial and another one breaks loose and they get over one sickness and another one comes and they barely get over one trial till another one comes and yet the real children of God that are filled with the Holy Ghost they they know every day is bringing them closer to that coming or them getting ready to meet the Lord Jesus and look at these other people with that perfect setting an absolute Paradise on the earth that the world has never known and when it's said and done they'll turn their back on him and say away with you I don't want your Earth I don't want your kingdom I don't believe in you I don't love you Jesus I hate you well I'm personally glad I can't relate to that I don't mind telling you since day one when I give my heart to God I've had ups and downs and ins and outs and battles and difficulties I've had people to lie on me my my greatest hurt is from Christians my greatest hurt is from message people my greatest wounds are from preachers but you know what I'm not serving God so everybody will love me I'm not serving God so everybody will like me I'm serving God because I've got a desire in my heart to serve it if people turn their back on me well you know what that's their fault and they're missing the opportunity to have a great friend because I could be a great friends so that's up to them you know it's up to them I I've got a bunch of friends so you know what we it depends on our Outlook and what we're looking for I'm not looking for a flyy bed of East anybody with me tonight I'm not looking for the Lord Jesus to take all the stumbling blocks out in front of me and make it to where everybody will like me I'll tell you one thing if everybody like me I'd repent because I know I got a devil on me I wish somebody would help me preach tonight and you imagine living in a world like is fixing to come in that Millennium and people would turn away from me well to be honest with you I don't know how in the world people would turn away for him living in this world because if they ever have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and know the joy and the peace and the power that comes I I just can't say how they want to live for the devil one more day let me just remind you what the devil don't have to give you he don't have eternal life he don't have lasting Joy he don't have lasting peace he does not have a peace that passes understanding hey y'all come to have church tonight the devil ain't got nothing good to give you he ain't got nothing lasting to give you he ain't got a heaven to take you to he ain't got no crown for your head he ain't got no Water of Life no Tree of Life no bread of life well glory to God all he's got for you is hell every day and torment Hereafter but if you serve the Lord Jesus he said If any man will come after me let him take up his cross and follow me but then he turns right around and says the least that you if you do this unto me you've done them unto me I'll be your friend in trouble some time I'll be your burden Bearer I'll be the one that'll lift you when nobody else is there I'm the friend that sit closer than the brother I'll be your Alpha I'll be your Omega I'll be your middle I'll be the end I'll be your first I'll be your last I'll be there when oh Hallelujah I'll be there when everybody forsakes you what more could I ask for what why in the world would I'm going to trade the Lord Jesus for that line Low Down Rotten canive and sneaking cheating devil I don't want nothing to do with that Rascal anybody else here on the same side I'm on so just in case you're still wondering yes I am a fanatic for Jesus Christ I said I am a adct for Jesus Christ I gave him my heart and my life as you know many many years ago I have not regreted brother Donnie don't you regret I've never smoking don't you regret never getting drunk who told you I ain't never got drunk I've been drunk many a day I've been drunk many a Time the prophet said after he got the Holy Ghost he was drunk every day on the baptism of the Holy Ghost why you say brother Donnie you miss so much dancing what do you mean Miss dancing I still dance I dance come on somebody what yeah but you the da what about all the happiness happiness I've got more happiness than a bottle of vodka or tequila or or whatever all the rest of that stuff out there can ever give you and I don't get no hangover come on somebody I don't get up with a headache in the morning but I do get up wanting more because once you ever get a good drink of the Lord Jesus it's like the more you get the more you want the more you want the more you get and the more you get the more you want you follow me and the more you get the more you say Lord I've got to have more I need more of your peace more your joy oh Hallelujah I believe tonight as the bride of Christ we have got more to Rejoice for than we've ever had in our entire life praise the Lord who in the world was that for now notice in verse 55 oh death where where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ now we believe in a bodily Resurrection do we not but how exactly will that happen now remember there are some of the Old Testament saints that actually never raised in Matthew 27 as a matter of fact Adam and Eve were two of them brother Tony where did you get that the message Adam will reach over to Eve Eve will reach over to Abel Abel reach over to Seth so there will be nobody there is no body for Adam laying in the dust now maybe someone would have just had a funeral the day before the Rapture their body of course would still be there but Adam has been gone for so long you couldn't even find the dust so once the dust goes back to the Earth from when it came then it breaks back to acids and gases and then back to Spirit so where will Adam get his body where did he get it the first time now you see the problem that people have in trying to understand our Resurrection remember the resurrection of Matthew 27:53 was a needed visible Resurrection with multiple eyewitnesses so it could be written in the Bible it needed to be that type of Resurrection but our resurrection and Rapture does not need to be that type as a matter of fact it's going to be a total secret no one will know it for several days that it's been Global for some it'll be weeks now but we say well the graves will open symbolically yes mine's already opened spiritually I've come out from among the dead so my grave is already open praise the Lord but now what's the prophet when he breaks into this and God hiding in in Simplicity in Jeffersonville and he says that watch this when they say the graves will open how is the graves going to open I said I haven't got time to get into this I wanted to but I'm going to have to take it just to show you the Simplicity of God the calcium Poes everything when everything that's in you materials would only make a spoonful so a spoonful so when it would go through the cycle to where bones tissue whatever more would finally decompose and come back to the dust State you'd wind up being a teaspoon now some of you a little bit bigger maybe me and you might wind up being a tablespoon but that still ain't much to brag about is it so You' go back to that then after you would dissolve into that your house I mean then the dust would break up and it would become what it was before the Earth took on chemistry now there was a time that the Earth did not exist where was it though in the mind of God so the Earth was one of God's thoughts one of his attributes and then let's say that he started molding the Earth with the core and the cosmic lights and PES and petroleum and all those things that he wanted to make it out of so he started creating now the Earth is your mother in the sense of the body so God gave the Earth and it passes from one generation of the Earth this is why the Bible of course in the Book of Genesis says and these are the generations of the heavens and the Earth generations of the heavens and the Earth so the Earth was coming from one seed to another to another so it passed in stages and Moses called it as Generations so what was it it was in spirit it was invisible thought form then it come down maybe into a form that taken not a visible thing but it did not look like what we have now so it was a generation so we would say all right you take me and hay and then our father Harry and I is one generation Our Father's another generation his father's another generation his father another generation so then we come down from one to the other so the earth and the heavens was descending they were descending ending into the stage that they are now the generations of the heavens and the Earth and God was writing a story of you and I so the Stars passed in their genealogies from one generation to another and remember that God gave Abraham The Mystery of the stars and the Earth so he said look up there and he said count the stars that you see then he tells him go down the Sands and count that and that's your seed so from dust to Stars now it's written of course in the heavens and it's written on the earth then God brought the earth into its primeval state in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God said let there be light and there was light so in that stage the Earth something had happened in a cataclysmic State because according to Jeremiah that God when he made it he would have never left it in an uninhabited place in a state so God started molding and bringing to this state of what we are today same with our bodies so whenever we would go back say Adam Eve Abel Seth massusa all those that lived those thousands of years ago wh what would they be there wouldn't even be no dust left of their mortal remains so it would break back to acids and gases and then it would go back be on that it would go back to Spirit now notice that would be the Earth had God not sent a protected word you understand I took care the other day I said you know you realize that the earth and the inhabitants of the Earth have never been at the stage where they are now it has never been on the Earth where man had the power to totally annihilate his home it's never been to the spot to where man had the ability to totally annihilate his home and he would do it in this age but God has a protective word over this Earth this Earth is one of God's attributes and he will not allow it to be destroyed but it is in man's ability I heard it just a week or so ago that Iran was in a couple of weeks will have enough plutonium to make a nuclear warhead now remember it's not just the big ones that have it anymore the prophet said whenever he was here that many of those small Nations look at North Korea look at all these different nations and have it so they start sending them off if they do and it send it across the top from the from Russia across the top comes across Alaska we've only got so many minutes by the time it shows up on our radar they've got so many minutes from the White House now keep that in mind when our president has to go to bed at 8:00 at night because he's so wore out so hopefully Russia won't send it at 8:05 which it doesn't really matter to me anyway because I've got a first class ticket it don't matter what time it is so as a bride of Christ you can go down and sleep like a baby at night because you don't have to sit up and wait on that the way I look at it God's going to be up all night anyway there no need for both of us to stay up so if I can't trust him with that I sure can't trust him with My Soul but you think now that if God had not put a protective word over this Earth in this age man would annihilate same with you and I if God had not spoke a word about a bride in this age all the darkness all the sin all the everyday things that we deal in our life how many knows I'm talking about tonight just to keep your head above the water in the day that we're living you're an absolute walking Miracle right here tonight and Daniel prophesied and said it would be that way in this day that Satan would try to wear out the patience of the saints of God but God also spoke a word about you and that's why Satan will never stop you as a member of the body of Christ I'm glad for that tonight now I want you to think about that the Earth would be reversed and go back because Atomic power was released in the beginning when God said let there be and an atom bursted at the bursting of an atom the releasing of the atomic energy from the spoken word of God you see God is the only one that can be able to burst an atom and not produce nuclear fallout he knows what to do but man broke into his laboratory through Oppenheimer and all those men that broke into that but when they broke into it then they broke into the side of death they can't do with the same thing that God does and what would it do it would take this Earth Beyond dust it would take it back into gases and totally annihilate the whole thing but God said I refuse to let that happen I will redeem her she's the only planet whose name is written in the Book of Life show me the word Pluto in your Bible show me the word Mars in your Bible Saturn Uranus or any of the rest of them there's only one planet whose name is in the book of life and that is the Earth aren't you glad your name's written there too now sing so God knowed that in that first resurrection of Matthew 273 25753 there must be visible people come on the earth and sepes would open and they would raise and be Witnesses now watch he says God just speaks and the Rapture will come it ain't going to go out there and the angels come down and shovel the out the graves and get an old dead carcass here what is it it's born in sin but to begin with but it's a new one made in its rightness you know if we have this we'll die again nobody will say the graves will open the dead shall walk out that may be true but not open in the way you say open you see that's right it won't be like that it will be a secret because he said he had come like a SE and the night he's already told us this that the Rapture the judgments will strike sin plague sickness and everything and the people will cry for death to take them when the Judgment Lord why is this judgment upon us you said there'd be a Rapture he'll say it's already come and you didn't know it now why would they not know it they're listening to the wrong voices amen because the preachers that they're sitting under are telling them all you have to do is look to the cross and plead the blood of Jesus and he understands you can't live right he understands you've got to sin a little bit every day and he understands that the Holy Ghost was just for the apostles and we ain't got the Holy Ghost no more well you know if that's what you hear and that's what you believe then naturally you're not going to seek the Holy Ghost and you know what's even to me more sad than that is that we've got a few preachers around this message that are teaching their congregations that there will be people out of the Catholic church out of the Baptist Church out of the Methodist Church that are going the Rapture on Resurrection morning I want somebody to show me where that is the conclusive teaching of this message down through the year 1965 you can stand right now if you got your quotes in with you amen it will take a message that will bring rapturing face how can you be a bride of Christ and wear the mark of a denomination when the mark of a denomination is the mark of the Beast and you pray to Mary in your rosary and you're going in the Rapture and God make us tow the line God make us I mean you do one little saying wrong think one little bad thought and you can't hardly live that day till you make that thing right and God lets people drink alcohol smoke cigarettes commit adultery where many skirts and dressed like like like men even though they're women and vice versa on the other side come on children and they're bringing drag shows to their church and them people are going in the Rapture if that's what heaven's going to be full of I don't even want to go come on don't get quiet on me tonight don't you worry there won't be no drag in heaven and there won't be none that's actually like it down here on the earth well praise the Lord so you see under the ministers that they're set under all we're all going we're all going you know everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die as the old song says and it's not just so much dying natural but it is spiritually so they will not expect it because they're anticipating the Rapture will be for anybody that believes in Jesus anybody that says oh yeah he's my savior I accepted him 75 years ago you know and I live like the devil but that's all right you know he give me Grace for that and that's just the way that it is so they don't believe in the Holy Ghost they don't seek the Holy Ghost and they live under that so they're just going in the in the coming of the Lord whenever it comes so they're not looking for it to be a mystery at all and no doubt they passed by the cemeteries and they say yep yep I can see all the graves other they're still full of all the people that I've buried since I've been here I could go to the cemeteries in Mount Carmel I could go to the ones all over Johnson City and Kingsport I could go to where we laid the body of my daughter the old Coke her grave will not be open because she is not there praise the Lord Brother Calvin ain't there come on your your husband your wife your daughter they're not there friends that's just the old cult now notice God hiding himself in Simplicity all it's it's already happened and you know it not why don't Believers believe the simple signs of his coming now they asked the Prophet this question in 1964 do all going the bride have to live within 15 excuse me 100 miles of the Tabernacle I believe I had that again last Sunday now in this know the bride doesn't have to be in any certain place many of them will be in the dust of the earth that'd be around the Earth in the snow and the North in the dust of the tropical jungles all around the world but when the trumpet of God shall sound the dead and Christ shall arise waken and Come Out of the Dust of the earth notice Out of the Dust God never made Adam's Body out of the red clay 6 Ines down beneath dust level where is the dust right on top right on top so God reached down on top where does God reach for all these millions of bodies that are going to be called from the earth the dust so he speaks at one time and how many ever there will be beginning with Adam from Adam Eve Abel Seth on down to the very last bride member that pass the day before the morning of can you imagine there may be somebody passed away that morning and about 15 minutes later they're raised from the dead said boy that was quick praise God hallelujah short sleep was it man that wasn't even a nap but God will speak not shovels Not Angels going down it will be a secret yes sir well how are we going to know his voice what dust will respond to the call now you see it will depend on you and I whether or not we are part of that number how do we know brother Brandon when he was there and Acton Kentucky when he preached at the campground and he preached Jesus with dirty feet was the subject that he was dealing with in 1955 and sister Nelly and brother Charlie and sister Nelly was there and brother Charlie wasn't serving the lord yet sister Nelly wasn't either but boy in that service the Lord got a hold to them s Nelly went up and you know cried and prayed and really give a heart to the Lord and the Lord just really done a work in their heart I was there several years ago on a tent meeting actually that brother Charlie set up on that same uh same ground where brother brandom was but brother Charlie after that the Lord started dealing with him and deal he was working night night shift there in in a place in camville and the Lord started dealing with him real real hard one night and brother Charlie just kind of sneaked you know went off around behind away from the guys he's working with and just kind of settled it right there with the Lord and then the next Sunday he went to the Tabernacle and he he did the traditional thing and know G up front and went up and so brother Ram told him later he said Charlie he said you made peace with him that night seen him in a vision and he said I saw you you know whatever it was where you standing and he said one day that same voice that called you right there at that plant will call you in the resurrection of the Rapture now you see this is our link to deity this is our link to the supernatural which God wants us to have our entire life our deposit our part of God the prophet says it this way a soul of God that was in God so just put it this way that God is a great Dynamo of Soul so you if you are part of him you were a soul of God that was in God I hope y'all come to have church tonight a soul of God that was in God that was your deposit then one day that part of God in you heard that voice of God and started pulling on your heart now this be honest we was not searching for God or you might have went from one Church to another after another but it was really God searching after us the prophet said no man seeks God but God seeks after man so there was something there that began to hear what was it it wasn't necessarily my physical ears or yours but it was that part from God that recognized his voice now if that part laying inside of me or laying inside of you was able to respond to that call and no doubt for some of you the state that you were in you thought there's no way I'm in such a bad shape I'm so lost how in the world could I ever come to God I don't feel worthy of course we were not but something within you begin to match up with something that it hurt it overwhelmed you as a matter of fact because it was beyond your own power your own choice your own capability of doing it what was it the father calling to a son or daughter that is the part of you that never sinned in the first place that is the part of God that was inside of you oh glory to God I got in trouble years ago when I first come to Happy Valley for preaching predestination and I'm still preaching it and still getting in trouble but you know what I believe it the way the Bible and the way this message teaches us that whenever I was born and when you was born that was the seed of God went inside of us hallelujah many of you can fellowship with me on this thought he said there was something in you when you were a little child he said there was things that seemed like it didn't bother other kids but it bothered you what was it it was your representation by predestination oh my when the devil thought he had us and we were so blind and so lost and so wretched but little did the poor old dumb devil know father had projected something down inside of us well I didn't just take the breath of life I took my own bro Hallelujah I took my own predestinated seat like that when I took the breath of life it would lay there I was one year old two years old 3 years old at the age of 12 the spirit of God would start hovering over my heart I remember remember when it happened to me just like it was yesterday I was out at Mom's house my grandmother lived right by us in a house I don't know if I've ever told this public or not but I was out there in the yard and we were little old Reagans man we were redneck young ons I'm telling you what we didn't have high dollar toys we made toys we made our go-karts swung on grap Vines if you ever seen any heathens we was part of the Heathen Clan that's what we were but I'll never forget I was out there catching lightning bugs anybody know what lightning bugs are boy you kids don't know what you missed well you what let me tell you what you do you catch a lightning bug Firefly if you wish to call it that and you drop it down in a jar and then you keep them then what you try to do is get a little piece of thread and you tie around you know them little guys that June bug is a lot easier to tie around their leg but every now and then we'd try them little things you couldn't hardly do it so we got to where we just put them in a half pint clear jar and we draw drop them little lightning bugs down and through there and then we'd walk around on the outside at night and say we had a lantern oh my you kids think you're having fun on the computer all day you think you're having fun on video game you don't know what fun is till you're swinging on a grap fun you're about 10 12 feet high on a grap V and that thing turns loose from the top of the tree and you're really screaming like tarsam and you H the ground oh my and I remember being out there in front of mom's house I never was really afraid well until every now and then Daddy would scare us but I never was really afraid at night we' go out and play and run and carry on at night time like we would at day but I remember been right to her you remember right in front of mom's house and that little old driveway that pulled in and all of a sudden I felt this presence it was my first experience with him Hallelujah I just it's like I walked into something how many's ever experienced it before I just walked into something and and it scared me cuz I never found nothing like it before and it wasn't but a few days after that I started talking to my mama cuz she' went to Revival and got saved little did I know it was my daddy it was my father mother hallelujah oh I got saved in that trinitarian church got baptized and titles you've heard a lot of my story Little did I know what Journey he had for me but that same thing that touched me then I have felt him countless of times since oh my I cannot wait till I walk into his divine presence that day oh hallelujah how many knows what I'm talking about and your experience is just as real to you maybe he met you out in a bar somewhere out in a barn or out in a pig lot wherever it was but brother it was sacred grounds wherever it was cuz there you met God for your first time something has already it the other day and the prophet talking about when he saw that there was a god out somewhere he didn't even know how to pray so he wrote God a letter imagine a man that's fixing to be Elijah and he didn't even know how to pray and he tacked his letter on a tree and then he thought well no I know I've I've seen him come through there he said and then he thought no no I've seen people pray so he went in a little Co shed and he knelt down and he seen a picture and people was holding their hands a certain way and he said sir I I've come to talk to you I'm I'm an awful guy I'm an awful guy and he said sir I I've heard people say you you talk to them and they he said sir can't you understand my language he said well maybe I hold my hands different you imagine a man being so a young man being so blind and so ignorant not even knowing how to pray but he had one of God's seeds in him oh hallelujah it's not all the do gooders and it's not all the holier than thou that Jesus found I'll tell you one thing when we get into heaven we're going to set down by some of the lowest people that ever walked on the earth some of them have been married a half a dozen time some of was so mean nobody wanted to marry him in the first place some of them was so low down there's Bootleggers there's Liars there's adulterers some of them was Hypocrites and Liars come on somebody but the grace of God reached down and got a hold of them and he saved them and he Sanctified them and he filled them with the Holy Ghost and they heard that same voice of Jesus sake come on come up children oh I wish right now I was out in the woods by myself but since I ain't I'll behave and finish my sermon watch this when the trumpet of God shall sound the dead and Christ shall arise waken Come Out of the Dust of the earth Come Out of the Dust of the earth not six foot deep dust it's all he needs no matter where they are now in this the resurrection will be a universal everywhere every creature on the ball of the earth that's in Christ will come forth with him when he comes no matter where they are just think in the days of the early Martyrs when those Christians were thrown in into the lion's den and those lions kill the Christians and eat up their bodies and yet they were scattered their bodies in the wastage of the Lions across a face of theirs you're made up of a substance that's unseen made material unseen made material unseen become visible and God will give that substance back my holy ghost in my body is my Assurance that I'll have one and I'll see him in my flesh job said I'll stand on the last days and in my flesh I'll see God though the skin worms consume me now you take a cell and you break it down from a cell and it comes into a cell in a Cell into an atom and to a MCU wow this sounds like a scientist talking don't it don't you understand this is not from the mind of a Kian this is a man of called called by the spirit of God to break into the original creation of human life Hallelujah come from a cell then a cell and a cell and into an atom and a molecule and on down like that finally it ends up into the Unseen and it goes from a natural something you put your hands on to gases from gases into acids acids into gasses and gases and on back like that till it finally winds up in one little thing and that is spirit and this Spirit who occupied these gases now say you've got gases in your body now element of oxygen nitrogen hydrogen right what is what is water H2O hydrogen oxygen and the Earth itself would be destroyed if God would have allowed it to be so the Earth would have become like our bodies nothing but God stopped that process on the earth and said you can only go this far and the spirit that occupied these gases now listen to this it might not be the same gasing but the features here's what matters friends it don't have to be the same oxygen the same nitrogen calcium phosphorus phosphate on and on and on what matters is the image praise be to God but the features of what you are will be exactly what they are again the spirit has control that I actually had to come through physically Dawn and Betty Reagan I could not have been born into the Arrowwood family nothing against that family probably better family and what I come from maybe you could not have been born a Reagan you could not have been born a Smith or born a McGill cuty or whatever but God put so much brass and so much copper and so much iron in the making of the bell and you had all that had to come together so in the resurrection you're going to look like you did when you was a young man a young woman well you said Brother D you mean oh no don't tell I'm going to look at like a again I'm I was thinking more like a Marilyn Monroe type uh no I don't think you want to look like her I don't think you want to go where she is you see we'll look at things so different the pretty ugly all that sort of thing no it it won't be there no more now watch and in other words when you become a young man or a young woman wow God takes a picture of you Smile everybody so God snapped your picture no matter how old and wrinkled how disfigured whatever it may be it will run right on down through and that body may be destroyed disfigured burnt eat up by lines whatever it is but it was made up of gases 16 elements of the earth that was calcium potes petroleum Cosmic light and so forth all goes together to make up the body now no matter the whole Earth is filled with that but now this picture is the main thing now there's always been a book that father has guarded around his throne Satan was right next to him his right-and man to Fellowship he knew a lot of things head of the music department in heaven thy tablets and thy pipes were created in thee the D the day that thou was created so he loved music he still does but there was this this book and papa never would let him get close to it he's never yet to this day even seen page one Papa always guarded it and watched over it it was his family album so in his mind he went he's snapping a picture so where was it at where was it recorded in his mind so he saw every one of us every millions and millions of his elect he saw them oh glory to God can't you see the way he looks at death is so different than us what matters is the picture you see the picture becomes exposed the first light hits it the moment of our new birth it's like the light rays Break Forth from eternity on the seat of God and the exposure just and the image starts taking shape and form so what was it you didn't know I didn't know I still don't know exactly I'm I'm praying oh God help me to to be in your will we all are me Lord I want to be more than you will cuz we know sometimes it'll it'll change you know the Lord will change the direction the way he wants us to go so we're still we're still looking for that but the main thing is is this image this picture so this is why it does not have to be the same dust you see we we think the main thing is this dust oh this is what we touch this is what we love this is what we focused on this is we fellowshipped around and shook one another's hands and cried and prayed for one another and we think this is the main thing no this is not the main thing the main thing is the picture but now this picture is the main thing then in the resurrection those gases and things come right back into place and develops this picture again so for those who are already in the sixth Dimension and their theophany therefore what happens therefore if you've entered into theophany what happens you will bring your theophany to the Earth to pick up your redeemed body you will bring your theophany to the Earth and if you are still here you will take your body to meet your your the offering the resurrection and the Rapture is the developing of the pictures oh thank you Lord God the developing of the pictures that are being brought back into the realm of visibility praise be to God thank you Lord Jesus oh and if these things come right back into the place and develops this picture again now this picture was not taken when you was 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your best when was it taken before the foundation of the world and it was put in God's Great file now unlike Microsoft and Oracle and all these technologies that we've got in this day you've got a file saved over here and you've got a file saved the pictures over there and my you looked at it this morning and you go back to look at it tonight and it's gone and it says we cannot retrieve your file or your file has been corrupted you say oh no oh no that's years that's years of of of of pictures oh no oh no Satan cannot not corrupt these fils as we know what happened just a couple of weeks ago whenever a certain thing and all the mechanisms tied to Microsoft and all that and Delta could not fly American could not fly and You' heard about it why because somebody in the partnership of their fouls missed it all up so they couldn't do it oh I'll tell you one thing the devil thought he had it all messed up in the garden of Eden he started corrupting what he thought was the image but God kept a Master Copy he s oh Hallelujah he s there in the Garden of Eden boy I have messed up this whole program poor old dumb devil all he done was just work right in the permissive will of God and by every one of those children there will not be a one of them that will not be there that day come on children our our name our looks our identification has kept in the foul of the father there will not be one lost and when God releases those in the sixth Dimension and they come down to the Earth all of the sudden it's just like the instant Kodak pictures you remember them and they go right at the end of it and in a matter of seconds there's the image praise God but you see God knew better than to trust us with selfies so it wasn't me and you it was not me taking my picture or you taking yours he took it Oh Glory let me go a little bit farther can I listen this now the only thing it did was featured it self here for you to make your choice then you become a servant of God him for knowing it it makes him a redeemer as we've been through it then that picture is absolutely this is the negative the negative part of life is where you're living now and anything if there is a negative there's got to be a positive before there can be a negative therefore if this is a negative there's got to be a positive somewhere if this ain't the POS oh my the real thing this is only a foreshadow the real thing that is to come you got it you got it so I don't care what they would do with you they cannot destroy that profile that picture sir in God's Great Gallery up there thank you it cannot destroy it it's in heaven you could burn it up feed it to the liines do anyway you want to it'll come forth again just as sure as two twos is four just to sure as God spoke it it'll come forth so no matter where you are than and it will happen in a moment and a twinkling of an eye every ready tell you last Wednesday night a moment and a twinkling of an eye at most it's a measurement of time that is so small it cannot be divided quicker than you could do that you'll be changed and the positive will come down and merge into what was the negative and you will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye let me read this to you more close I found these words to today I thought it was so wonderful when God's people begins to get back together there's Unity there's power and whenever God's people get together completely I believe the resurrection will take place then there will be a rapturing time a rapturing Time when the Holy Spirit begins to gather it up it'll be in the minority of course but there will be a great Gathering now in this rapturing time like this there'll have to come a time now that the bride that rejects the head part of the Bride will have to suffer for her rejection now listen to this carefully this shows there will be a people who've been around the message of the hour but before the Rapture they will actually turn against the head part of the message there will come a time now this bride that rejects the head part of the Bride will have to suffer for her rejection don't you see these people out here that's never heard it how can they suffer for their rejection they never heard it there will be an element of people around this message that will come up so far and right before the changing time they will reject it they will polish it up and make the message more presentable they'll take off the prophet's rough edges and you know his vernacular and all that sort of thing and polish it up for the day not realizing that when they do so when they do so they'll stand before God for adding to and taking away from and they will be rejected in this briad time because the gospel wasn't made plain to them back there it's made plain to you today you see it's plain it's done all those years in examples the seals open Church ages laid out everything like that it's so plain you can't miss it then if you fully rejected there's only one thing to do suffer for it Lord children don't set you in this church don't set you under the hospices of the message of the hour and turn it down let's stand together he takes his little boy Joseph down to see the armus day parade and he relates the going home in a similarity to this parade one day there will come a blast From Heaven the dead in Christ shall rise first them Old Testament Saints back Yonder who are waiting Will Blast forth and come out of their first and go into the resurrection and will drop right in line going into the sky now notice the Old Testament Saints will come out first those not included Matthew 27:53 oh my what a time well drop right in line going into the sky these old Mortal bodies be changed made like unto his own glorious body what a parade that'll be when it starts heavenward and some of these days and that rapturing time that lays ahead oh proudly displaying the blood of Jesus Christ upon their chests the message of God in the hour that they lived in so tell me how can you take a Rapture and not be a part of the message of God for the day you lived in when the word become blood and the word bled for you so when people reject the word of this day they're not rejecting a quote they're not rejecting you know just a message of a prophet they're rejecting Christ Jesus he divided himself his word dispensation so when they rejected Luther's message that was Christ in Luther's day Wesley's message Christ in that day amen tongues gifts restoration and Pentecost that was Christ in that day now the fullness of the godhead bodily has come back under the administration of the son of man they're not rejecting me they're not rejecting you they're not rejecting William random they're rejecting Christ Jesus and his revealed word in this hour the very thing they reject is the very thing we will rise to meet him in ploud proudly displaying on our chest the blood of Jesus Christ the bloody bleeding word dripping blood to wash the briide in and we'll display that on our chest the message of God for the hour we lived him God bless you Saints may God you help each of us we can be ready for that day let's B it if you would oh Father Lord as we all look look back through pictures of ourselves and every now and then somebody will send me something that my sisters or my brother Jamie will put on Facebook and it'll be us as little Reagans and maybe some of our school picturers or whatever more sister lyia Swanson had sent one the other day to Carol it was Brother David and his youngest son Josiah standing there at a certain spot there in Canada 10 years later there both of them were standing Josiah had grown up now a married man brother Dave his hair had turned colors getting some age in his face what a difference 10 years makes but Lord we're so grateful that that real picture is in your gallery thank you Father oh Jesus May every one of us make preparation and plans while those that are turning away from this great word preachers that are polishing it up Lord God I pray that you'd help us to realize it's not the message that needs polishing it's us that needs polishing by the message it's not us that needs to polish it up and made it make it more presentable to the world all but I realize it's always been that way many want to use the message as a springboard for themsel I pray myself nor this church will never turn into such a thing may we preach this message in its Purity and its power Lord God where you can always be among us we know there's one way to keep your Dynamics among us and that is to keep our mechanics straight because if we get off of the mechanics part you will not bless a lie nor will you bless arrogance or Pride so the mechanics is part of what we must do and then you will strike our mechanics with your Dynamics we've been given a promise the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've only worked it in a small measure we're looking for it father we love you tonight Jesus oh Father how we worship you We Praise You Tonight Lord hallelujah can we just raise our hands in the presence of the Lord thank you Lord Lord Jesus we worship you children maybe you need strength tonight for your journey maybe you're fighting battles like never before whether physically spiritually
