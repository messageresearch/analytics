[30:35] unfolding I Heard a Voice like I have
[30:39] never

[36:20] earth
[36:22] earthy the first man is of the earth
[36:26] earthy
[36:27] the second man is the Lord From Heaven
[36:32] so we're speaking then about Adam and
[36:37] Jesus as is the
[36:40] earthy such are
[36:44] they such are they also that are
[36:50] earthy and as is the
[36:54] Heavenly such are they also
[36:57] that are
[37:00] Heavenly and as we have
[37:03] borne the image of the
[37:07] earthy born I love this word that Paul
[37:10] chose to use
[37:13] where to Bear
[37:16] constantly of clothing or
[37:20] garments so listen what he says now with
[37:23] that in mind as we have borne the image
[37:27] of the Earthly or look this
[37:36] way so it's a
[37:39] garment so what is this body that we
[37:42] live in it's an old
[37:46] coat right and what does death do simply
[37:51] takes the coat away from you and gives
[37:54] you a new one
[37:57] so you're not dead if you're a child of
[37:59] God you just changed
[38:04] coats as we have borne the image of the
[38:10] earthy we shall also
[38:13] bear the
[38:15] image of the
[38:18] Heavenly now this I say
[38:21] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[38:26] inherit the kingdom of
[38:29] God but if you notice Paul does not say
[38:33] Flesh and
[38:36] Bones cuz Jesus said a spirit has not
[38:39] Flesh and Bones as you see me have you
[38:43] see in the new body we will have no
[38:47] blood right Jesus didn't have blood and
[38:51] his resurrected body now this I say
[38:54] Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[38:58] inherit the kingdom of God neither does
[39:03] corruption
[39:04] inherit
[39:07] incorruption praise the Lord how many
[39:10] hand would like to be remembered as we
[39:11] pray tonight over the
[39:15] word Heavenly
[39:18] Father these words have
[39:20] inspired so many of your
[39:23] children for over 2,000 years now since
[39:27] it was
[39:28] written we thank you for Apostle
[39:33] Peter Apostle
[39:35] James we thank you for Luke the great
[39:38] physician the great
[39:40] writer we thank you for John the Beloved
[39:45] Apostle disciple and also a prophet but
[39:49] oh how we thank you for
[39:53] Paul because he wrote Things That No One
[39:56] Else in the New Testament
[39:59] wrote I see why Satan wants to Blind the
[40:03] people of this age to convince them they
[40:07] do not need the gift and the Insight of
[40:11] a prophet because a prophet has the
[40:14] ability to break into the word and see
[40:17] and understand things that no other
[40:20] office in the fivefold ministry does I
[40:23] pray that you'd speak to us tonight
[40:25] father teach us from your word Lord God
[40:29] you saw these needs dear Jesus we're
[40:31] asking that you'd be mindful I know Lord
[40:34] there's still some that are traveling
[40:36] even today coming back from vacation
[40:38] some traveling some going pray that
[40:41] you'd watch over the people fathers are
[40:43] out on the highways and flying and so on
[40:46] that youd bring them back home safely to
[40:48] us till we can all be ready for that
[40:51] great big vacation that we're all
[40:53] planning on bless the service tonight we
[40:56] pray in Jesus name
[40:58] amen God bless you you may be
[41:05] seated so Boaz takes Ruth and she
[41:09] becomes his
[41:11] wife and
[41:13] he comes in unto
[41:17] her and leads her to a body
[41:21] change so she seemed as if though she
[41:25] was dead
[41:28] she had no
[41:32] children which was a great reproach for
[41:35] a
[41:36] woman no
[41:38] child unlike today in the day that we're
[41:41] living so it wasn't come to find
[41:45] out it was not actually
[41:48] her it was the man she was
[41:51] with so there's nothing wrong with Ruth
[41:55] as far as being fertile
[41:58] but it was the union or the man that she
[42:01] was joined up with that could give her
[42:04] no
[42:06] child so with us that we had to have a
[42:11] death which would loose us from our
[42:13] first Union and then put us with the
[42:18] right man and we will bring forth a
[42:21] Christ child
[42:24] amen whenever we look at the parallel
[42:28] between the Book of Ruth and the many
[42:32] types and shadows that the Lord had in
[42:34] his mind of a gentile bride of how she
[42:37] would come into
[42:39] fruition and she would bring forth His
[42:43] Image only the Old Testament could make
[42:46] a mirror or a shadow or a type but it
[42:50] could not bring forth the real thing
[42:53] even in Solomon he was able to bring
[42:56] forth a type of the son of David a type
[43:01] of the Millennium but he could not bring
[43:03] forth the real millenum so and the
[43:07] different ones of Joshua and joshc and
[43:10] the different ones in the Old Testament
[43:12] habac and Nehemiah and they were able to
[43:16] pick up Jeremiah whenever he bought his
[43:19] cousin's property and he had Hann anel
[43:23] and he was able to seal up the document
[43:26] prophesying that there would be a breach
[43:29] and that there would also be a loosening
[43:31] of the seal and people would once again
[43:34] on property in Judah in Jerusalem and in
[43:38] Galilee all of those things were types
[43:42] and shadows but we know the shadow can
[43:45] be very vague you can't see it but my
[43:48] hand is making a shadow on this desk now
[43:52] the reason of it is of course is because
[43:54] the light is above me and the light
[43:56] cannot penet at and go through my hand
[43:59] because my hand is not translucent or
[44:02] transparent so as I move this finger the
[44:05] shadow moves on the desk I move this one
[44:08] that one I move my hand back and forth
[44:10] you can't sit but you take my word for
[44:12] it but it's still very very vague so all
[44:15] it is is just a dark image I can see my
[44:19] thumb I'm touching my thumb my first
[44:20] finger I can put my fingers like that
[44:23] and I can see it vaguely through the
[44:25] image and through the shadow there
[44:27] but I have no clue what color my skin is
[44:30] I don't know if I'm a white man if I'm
[44:32] an Asian or if I'm a Caucasian if I
[44:35] would be an africanamerican I can't
[44:37] really tell because it is a shadow so a
[44:41] shadow can be very very vade so once the
[44:44] shadow becomes the positive now what
[44:47] what happens as I lay my hand right down
[44:49] on top of the desk you know what just
[44:51] happened the Shadow on this desk
[44:55] disappeared so as I look down on this
[44:57] desk I no longer see the shadow I can
[45:01] tell you exactly a right there where the
[45:03] fox bit me whenever I was 11 years old
[45:07] the scar is still there the Stitch marks
[45:09] are still on my hand starts right here
[45:11] and runs all the way down to the bottom
[45:13] that was not visible in the shadow I see
[45:16] I've got these brown marks right here
[45:19] they tell me it's old age marks wow what
[45:22] in the world am I doing with them I've
[45:24] got hairs up here on my hands I've got
[45:26] different different thing scars and
[45:28] scratches got a big scar right here
[45:30] where I was trimming some Vines one day
[45:33] and laid my arm wide open about that
[45:35] long so it's amazing though the Shadows
[45:38] didn't reflect all that so whenever
[45:41] people look at the Old Testament and
[45:43] someone had made a complaint about me
[45:45] not long ago and said that guy's really
[45:48] really weird because he preaches from
[45:51] the Old Testament and the Old Testament
[45:53] don't he know that the Old Testament is
[45:56] already full feel so I told the person
[45:58] that told me that I said the next time
[46:00] you talk to that individual you tell
[46:02] them that there are prophecies in
[46:05] Zachariah in Malachi in Hagi even in
[46:10] Deuteronomy and Isaiah and habac which
[46:14] have not yet been fulfilled so there are
[46:18] things in the Old Testament that as of
[46:21] yet have not been fulfilled and so are
[46:24] their types and shadows that are still
[46:27] being fulfilled by a gentile bride today
[46:31] from the Old Testament so what we can
[46:33] see then is in the shadows many of those
[46:37] things were pretty vague but whenever
[46:40] the Shadows become more positive then it
[46:43] starts reflecting greater and greater as
[46:47] far as what the Lord wanted to do now
[46:50] read with me if you would in the Book of
[46:51] Luke
[46:53] 20:34 in the resurrection you can see
[46:57] why the Sadducees and the Pharisees had
[47:01] this debate now the Sadducees did not
[47:05] believe in a resurrection the Pharisees
[47:09] did but the Sadducees did not believe in
[47:12] a resurrection nor in angels nor in
[47:16] spirits no wonder they were sad you
[47:20] see uh I found out a few years ago
[47:24] there's some folks in the message that
[47:26] don't believe in a resurrection either
[47:29] they don't believe in the coming of the
[47:30] Lord as a matter of fact they believe
[47:32] the Lord come in 1963 I do too but I'm
[47:36] still looking for a Corporal coming
[47:39] that's right but I want you to notice
[47:41] now in the shadow of how that Ruth was
[47:45] raised in her position she was raised
[47:49] from a dead moabitas and also her womb
[47:54] would have been considered unfruitful
[47:57] she was also raised from that image that
[48:00] she brought forth uh a reflection of who
[48:04] Boaz really was and also Naomi was also
[48:08] raised from the dead considered that she
[48:12] would have been pass childbearing and
[48:14] she was but her daughter in the gospel
[48:18] of which she mothered in the types
[48:21] brought forth a son and she took that
[48:24] son to her bosom and officially legally
[48:28] adopted that son and then it was said
[48:31] about Naomi that this son became her
[48:35] Kinsman now not Boaz but this son and
[48:40] she became a nurse now she could not of
[48:43] course have have fed this child cuz she
[48:47] was too old but she took care of him and
[48:51] there was something about this child
[48:53] that renewed Naomi's use
[48:57] so he raised her also from the dead in a
[49:02] figurative form now the resurrection
[49:06] also includes the Gentile bride now for
[49:10] those of you T not that are in this
[49:11] place and those of you that are
[49:13] streaming that have received the token
[49:16] life you have spiritually already raised
[49:20] from the dead you were in dark
[49:25] denominationalism but you have raised
[49:27] from the dead because the son Christ
[49:31] Jesus has waved over your soul and you
[49:36] have passed from Death unto
[49:40] life now we know then that this token
[49:44] life that has been applied to our soul
[49:47] has
[49:49] regenerated us look at the word
[49:51] regenerate or regeneration look how it's
[49:55] spelled are e g e n e r a t e or r a t i
[50:03] o n re Gene arate regene
[50:08] aration so it is a reging or the
[50:13] quickening of the real Gene of who you
[50:17] are then what happened you raised from
[50:21] the dead so what are we waiting on then
[50:24] the prophet asked the question how can a
[50:27] person that this has happened to ever
[50:30] get sick again how could they ever die
[50:33] how could they ever go through
[50:35] tremendous battles and trials and of
[50:38] course the answer is that we have
[50:40] received the down payment or the earnest
[50:43] of our inheritance and we're waiting for
[50:45] the full payment inside of our body
[50:49] which has not yet been fully redeemed
[50:52] but ammy believes we're on our way now
[50:55] what's Jesus speak speaking about the
[50:58] resurrection now there was a debate
[51:00] among about the scribes and the
[51:02] Pharisees and they gave him this foolish
[51:04] Parable and Jesus is going to answer
[51:07] this Parable Luke 20:34 Jesus answering
[51:11] said unto them the children of this
[51:14] world marry and are given in marriage
[51:17] but they which shall be listen to these
[51:20] words they which shall be accounted
[51:25] Worthy
[51:26] to obtain the world that world and the
[51:31] resurrection from the dead neither
[51:35] marry oh my nor are given in
[51:40] marriage now I want you to notice this
[51:43] is the master of the
[51:47] Resurrection why would he couple these
[51:50] two words together and Associate it with
[51:54] the resurrection but they would shall be
[51:58] accounted
[52:01] worthy accounted
[52:04] worthy so each of us then have an
[52:09] account a
[52:11] Heavenly
[52:12] account and the only ones going in the
[52:16] resurrection and the
[52:18] Rapture are those that haven't been
[52:23] attributed to their account and on their
[52:26] account statement it will
[52:29] say
[52:33] worthy now for those who believe and are
[52:39] Christians and are
[52:42] saved and on their
[52:45] account will be this word
[52:49] written
[52:51] forgiven
[52:55] saved but the word
[52:58] Worthy on will be
[53:00] wanting now as I mentioned to you the
[53:02] other day all preachers are not men of
[53:07] God some preachers are just preachers
[53:09] they're just professional preachers like
[53:11] professional bankers and Woodworkers and
[53:13] whatever more so all preachers are not
[53:16] men of God all
[53:19] Christians are not
[53:24] Saints what is a saint
[53:26] a Sanctified one so Carol and I as of
[53:31] this week have been married for 51 years
[53:36] so I Sanctified
[53:39] myself unto
[53:41] her she Sanctified herself unto me and
[53:48] we have remained in that state for 51
[53:54] years now so you'll understand
[53:56] understand it I pledge to
[53:59] her I would want no other woman in my
[54:04] life and she would want no other man in
[54:08] her life so she Sanctified herself from
[54:13] all other
[54:16] men I Sanctified myself from all other
[54:20] women wil thou love her honor her keep
[54:24] thee only unto her
[54:27] so long as you both shall live I do so I
[54:34] Sanctified myself unto her she
[54:37] Sanctified herself unto me and by the
[54:40] grace of God we have kept that Covenant
[54:44] promise to each other for 51
[54:48] years so we're able to stand before you
[54:51] tonight as our
[54:52] church and say that we have been loyal
[54:56] we have been faithful to each
[54:59] other is that worth something I think it
[55:03] is I think it's notable I think it's
[55:05] outstanding by the grace of God and
[55:07] there some in here tonight could say it
[55:10] with even years longer than Carolyn I
[55:12] have I think it's a notable thing God
[55:14] bless you for doing that because in the
[55:17] age we're living you can't already find
[55:19] people that's Mar married that long
[55:20] anymore and yet you realize even
[55:23] Christians that some Christians have had
[55:26] not been faithful to their husband or
[55:28] their wife and they feel awful about it
[55:30] and then they feel terrible and they
[55:32] bear the reproach of it and it it's a
[55:34] terrible thing that they did but I want
[55:37] you to notice that one this is one thing
[55:39] that separates the bride from the church
[55:42] in that the church is saved but the
[55:45] church has other lovers in her love life
[55:52] so she loves sports more than God she
[55:56] loves activities she loves all kinds of
[55:59] things more than going to church on
[56:02] Wednesday night and it's sad to say on
[56:05] Sunday morning for some people so they
[56:08] love this and brother bam talked about
[56:10] it whenever he was here that people
[56:12] would stay home on Wednesday night and
[56:14] watch we love Susi that's what he called
[56:16] Lucy he might have been closer to the
[56:18] truth than what her mom and daddy called
[56:20] her we love Susi and he said if God is
[56:23] in your heart you can't wait for them
[56:25] Church doors to open well come on Saints
[56:30] so you realize that a lot of people that
[56:33] claim they are Christians and are saved
[56:36] and I'm not saying that they're not but
[56:38] I'm saying this only those who are
[56:42] accounted
[56:44] wory will go on the resurrection amen
[56:48] and the
[56:50] Rapture they will be set apart to the
[56:54] Lord Jesus for his
[56:58] will now notice this is the man himself
[57:01] saying this but they which shall be
[57:04] accounted worthy to obtain that world oh
[57:07] I'm so glad there's another world and
[57:10] the resurrection from the dead neither
[57:12] marry nor are given in marriage look
[57:15] again Luke 21:
[57:18] 36 now don't raise your hands but I
[57:21] wonder how many of you
[57:23] pray this scripture right here because
[57:25] the Lord Jesus Jesus told you
[57:28] to watch ye therefore and pray
[57:36] always that ye may be accounted
[57:42] worthy to
[57:44] escape all these things that shall come
[57:48] to
[57:49] pass and to stand before the son of man
[57:54] isn't it amazing he didn't say son of
[57:58] God or son of
[58:00] David wonder why would use the title son
[58:04] of
[58:05] man and relate standing before the son
[58:09] of man in a
[58:11] dispensation when the Great Escape will
[58:15] take place now notice the words of the
[58:18] Lord Jesus watch ye therefore and pray
[58:21] always again I'm not going to ask you to
[58:23] raise your hands but how many of you
[58:25] believe Believers sting here tonight
[58:28] pray always that you will be accounted
[58:31] worthy to escape all these things that's
[58:34] going to come to
[58:35] pass well if you don't you've just been
[58:38] added a new thing to pray for from
[58:42] tonight on watch ye therefore now watch
[58:47] now these are people this is the mindset
[58:52] this is the attitude of those going in
[58:56] the Rapture this is one of the
[58:59] requirements of the Bride the Lord Jesus
[59:02] said watch ye therefore all right now
[59:05] watch it's like this groom has a
[59:11] list by which he declares this is what I
[59:17] want my wife to
[59:19] be this is my Divine
[59:23] list so he predeter determined this list
[59:27] before he ever made a
[59:29] man he predetermined this list before he
[59:33] ever made a
[59:34] star and then before his list could ever
[59:38] come into existence man
[59:42] fell but God still kept the
[59:45] list so then everyone that was born
[59:49] thereafter was born without the
[59:53] ability to keep the list
[59:57] and then God knowing that man would do
[1:00:00] that he for ordained a people that would
[1:00:05] actually have the nature of the list
[1:00:09] inbred in their
[1:00:13] genos in their seed so if God wants it
[1:00:18] there's only one way for a people to
[1:00:21] ever meet the list so if every one of
[1:00:24] these terms has to met in order to be
[1:00:27] bride and that's the only way you're
[1:00:30] going so then he you so boy he's a
[1:00:33] pretty picky guy well he is he's very
[1:00:36] picky I'll tell you one thing you
[1:00:38] Brothers here tonight that's not married
[1:00:40] and you would just marry any woman I say
[1:00:42] shame on you you Brothers ought to be
[1:00:45] picky you young ladies ought to be picky
[1:00:47] over the man that you marry you ought to
[1:00:50] have a standard that you set let me tell
[1:00:53] you one thing ought to be your standard
[1:00:55] if that boy or that man that you're
[1:00:57] thinking about married ain't got the
[1:00:58] Holy Ghost I would not say I do or I
[1:01:02] will until he does it because he'll
[1:01:04] never be able to lead you the right way
[1:01:06] without the Holy Ghost amen well praise
[1:01:10] the Lord now you imagine the only way
[1:01:13] that God can ever do this is to write
[1:01:17] the list in the hearts of his children
[1:01:22] so when they come to the Earth and that
[1:01:25] predestinated seed Falls inside of them
[1:01:28] the contents of the list they don't even
[1:01:30] know there is a list they don't even
[1:01:32] know that there's a seed they know
[1:01:34] nothing about it but it's like whenever
[1:01:36] they hear it preached and something new
[1:01:39] we say is brought to them and they
[1:01:42] didn't even know it like some of you I
[1:01:44] saw it on your faces whenever I read it
[1:01:46] to you it clicked on some of your hearts
[1:01:48] some of you never knew and did you never
[1:01:51] known that the Lord Jesus said for you
[1:01:54] to pray it that way but I know by the
[1:01:56] look on some of your faces from this
[1:01:58] night on it will be taken care of you
[1:02:01] know why because the light on that
[1:02:04] promise quickened and aligned with the
[1:02:08] list inside of your own soul so then the
[1:02:12] connection him wanting the list to be
[1:02:15] kept I want this this this this this and
[1:02:18] a woman I want a clean woman I want a
[1:02:20] Sanctified woman I want a holy ghost
[1:02:22] filled woman I want a woman that will
[1:02:24] say Amen to my word I want a woman to
[1:02:26] live right and the more you go down that
[1:02:28] list the more you realize so many of the
[1:02:30] church people in this age cannot meet
[1:02:34] the requirements on the list and may I
[1:02:37] say you and I tonight could not make it
[1:02:40] either were it not for the grace of God
[1:02:45] we would fall short at the very best and
[1:02:47] no matter how much we desired it to be
[1:02:51] now watch Jesus said watch ye therefore
[1:02:53] and pray not just when you get
[1:02:56] saved but pray
[1:02:59] always this was one of my favorite
[1:03:01] scriptures when I was in Pentecost I
[1:03:05] never knew why because the church I went
[1:03:08] to they never even taught a Rapture my
[1:03:12] uncle har and them they never even
[1:03:13] believed in a Rapture so I wasn't taught
[1:03:17] a Rapture and I never understood till
[1:03:20] years later why did this scripture so
[1:03:24] ReSound in my soul but after I come to
[1:03:27] the message of the hour I realize it was
[1:03:31] part of the list that was manifesting
[1:03:34] itself in me even back
[1:03:36] C aren't you glad pray you therefore
[1:03:39] always that you may be accounted worthy
[1:03:43] now notice accounted worthy to escape
[1:03:48] notice the words now that he uses so the
[1:03:51] Great Escape is right on us look at the
[1:03:54] word that he go to use Escape so what
[1:03:58] what are we escaping from Leota
[1:04:01] blindness Darkness all types of sin all
[1:04:05] types of wickedness all types of
[1:04:07] religiosity all types of unbelief look
[1:04:10] friend the Rapture is an escape so if
[1:04:15] you were in a jail or you were in a
[1:04:17] house or you were put up somewhere don't
[1:04:20] you see why the Lord Jesus used this
[1:04:23] word pray you therefore always that you
[1:04:25] may may be accounted worthy to escape
[1:04:28] all these things that shall come to pass
[1:04:31] and stand before the son of man so it is
[1:04:35] an escape well in order to escape we've
[1:04:38] got to know the way out do we not so if
[1:04:42] you were in a prison you were in a jail
[1:04:45] you were in a building and the building
[1:04:47] caught on fire you're staying at a hotel
[1:04:49] I've stayed in hotels around the world
[1:04:52] you know one thing that I always want to
[1:04:54] do I want to find when I go in that room
[1:04:56] no matter what Flor they put me on I
[1:04:58] like to be the higher the better cuz I'm
[1:05:00] a light sleeper and it seemed like I get
[1:05:03] under the room if I get in the fifth
[1:05:05] floor and there's sixth floor I don't
[1:05:06] know how in the world but there's
[1:05:08] elephants that wind up in them room
[1:05:10] above me I don't care where I'm at I
[1:05:12] don't see how in the world they know
[1:05:14] exactly where I'm going they're up all
[1:05:16] night romping and jumping and carrying
[1:05:18] on and you know what one thing I do
[1:05:21] though I want to look which way is the
[1:05:24] exit y'all ever did that when you say at
[1:05:26] a hotel I want to know where the exit is
[1:05:30] now I've never had to leave because of a
[1:05:32] fire and I hope I don't ever do it but
[1:05:35] the way I look at is just a little bit
[1:05:37] of not you know having a little common
[1:05:40] sense and a little bit of insurance in
[1:05:42] case that thing goes off I don't know
[1:05:44] exactly where the exit that's exactly
[1:05:46] what's wrong with a lot of churches they
[1:05:48] don't know where the exit is I don't
[1:05:49] know how the how do I get out of here
[1:05:51] how do I get get out of ler see and know
[1:05:53] what the preachers tell them the
[1:05:54] preachers are given them false
[1:05:57] directions oh you don't have to live
[1:06:00] holy you don't have to dress right oh my
[1:06:02] goodness you know yet that you don't
[1:06:04] have to do all that stuff you know what
[1:06:05] they're doing they're giving them the
[1:06:08] wrong directions and they're going to
[1:06:10] wake up in the tribulation period and
[1:06:13] the exit door has already been shut and
[1:06:16] the Escape has reached the climax and
[1:06:19] they find themselves in the middle of
[1:06:21] the tribulation period we would not have
[1:06:24] realized the Escape roote ourself had
[1:06:28] not God by his grace opened our
[1:06:31] understanding and showed us the way out
[1:06:34] aren't you glad you know the way
[1:06:37] out notice that you may be accounted
[1:06:40] worthy to escape all these things that
[1:06:43] shall come to pass and stand before the
[1:06:46] son of man look at the Lord Jesus now
[1:06:48] again in Revelation 3:4 when we're
[1:06:50] talking about the Sardis Church age thou
[1:06:53] Hast a few names even in Sardis which
[1:06:58] have not defiled their garments and they
[1:07:01] shall walk with me in white for they are
[1:07:07] worthy notice this word how it keeps
[1:07:09] coming up over and over again worthy
[1:07:13] worthy so they have some worse about
[1:07:17] them and this worse is what puts them in
[1:07:20] the position where they are and it's the
[1:07:23] worst so where did they get this word
[1:07:26] they were born like everybody else lost
[1:07:28] without God so the only way to get worse
[1:07:32] then would be have to be given to us
[1:07:34] attributed to us from someone else who
[1:07:37] had the worst and then this wor by his
[1:07:40] righteousness of course it will begin to
[1:07:43] act out then when we get his
[1:07:46] righteousness we will start obeying what
[1:07:49] he says so we get this worse and then he
[1:07:51] says all right you're my bride you're my
[1:07:53] people I give you my righteousness and
[1:07:55] then he turns right around now and tells
[1:07:57] us in Luke 21:36 pray you therefore
[1:07:59] always that you may be accounted worthy
[1:08:01] to escape all these things so you see
[1:08:03] it's not just to give from him and then
[1:08:05] the rest of the time we s around and
[1:08:07] twiddle our PMS we don't pray we don't
[1:08:09] read our Bible we don't go to church we
[1:08:11] don't have to live right oh no if we
[1:08:13] have a worthy life it will reflect
[1:08:16] itself by the way we live and the church
[1:08:19] said amen notice these Saints now and
[1:08:22] Sardis I I love this that the way the
[1:08:25] Lord Jesus say this thou Hast a few
[1:08:28] names in Sardis isn't it amazing it
[1:08:31] didn't say you have a few
[1:08:34] people he didn't say you have a few
[1:08:36] people you've got a few church members
[1:08:39] but you've got a few
[1:08:41] names you've got a few
[1:08:44] names you've got a few names in Sardis
[1:08:49] which have not defiled their garments oh
[1:08:52] my so a name isn't a association with a
[1:08:57] behavior so you've got a few names in
[1:09:01] Sardis which have not defile their
[1:09:04] garments and they shall walk with me now
[1:09:08] here is the worthy
[1:09:10] one they shall walk with me in white for
[1:09:17] they
[1:09:19] they are
[1:09:21] worthy this is the only worthy one that
[1:09:24] could be
[1:09:26] I'm the only worthy one is turning back
[1:09:29] to people on the Earth and saying you
[1:09:32] all are worthy how could they be how in
[1:09:37] the world could they ever be worthy they
[1:09:39] shared of his righteousness in other
[1:09:42] words they found the identified word for
[1:09:45] the age they lived in and they were
[1:09:48] partakers of his
[1:09:51] list so his list of requirements for the
[1:09:55] arest age they met it and by meeting
[1:09:59] what was on the list for that age into
[1:10:02] their account was this Oh Glory was this
[1:10:07] title under their names that they were
[1:10:12] worthy now they wasn't just saved saved
[1:10:15] is not necessarily being worthy but they
[1:10:19] were worthy so they hadn't just got
[1:10:21] saved they moved on into a worthy state
[1:10:24] with him so it was only those that were
[1:10:28] worthy that would walk with him in white
[1:10:32] wonder what happened to the rest of
[1:10:34] them so there was other people there in
[1:10:38] Sardis that were saved but there was
[1:10:40] only a few
[1:10:43] names That'll Walk with him and white
[1:10:46] can't you see again the separation
[1:10:48] between the bride and the church notice
[1:10:51] again in Luke
[1:10:53] 20:36 now Jesus we'll go back to what
[1:10:56] he's talking about the resurrection
[1:10:57] neither can they die anymore for they
[1:10:59] are equal unto the angels and they are
[1:11:04] the children of God being the children
[1:11:07] of the Resurrection so as Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] was declared to be the Son of God by his
[1:11:13] resurrection from the dead so sons of
[1:11:17] men which are born by natural birth also
[1:11:21] have the declared title given to them
[1:11:24] that they are Children of the
[1:11:26] Resurrection whenever they experience
[1:11:29] this Resurrection in their bodies now
[1:11:32] Jesus said they will be like Angels now
[1:11:35] human beings are never turned into
[1:11:38] Angels you never were an angel and you
[1:11:42] never will be an angel now your angel
[1:11:45] beholds your father's face but you were
[1:11:50] always a man or a woman and you always
[1:11:53] will be right praise the Lord so watch
[1:11:57] what happens then these angels are
[1:12:01] Spirit beings and you know by reading
[1:12:03] your Bible of course that there never
[1:12:05] were any angels that were seen that look
[1:12:09] like women but they were always seen
[1:12:13] with the identification as men yet they
[1:12:16] don't have sexuality so it's not like a
[1:12:21] gender in the sense that we think of it
[1:12:24] because it's neither male nor female in
[1:12:26] that sense now notice again Jesus says
[1:12:29] neither can they die anymore for they
[1:12:31] are equal unto the angels and are the
[1:12:34] children of God being the children of
[1:12:37] the Resurrection so as he raised from
[1:12:40] the dead and was declared the son of the
[1:12:42] Living God so we being raised from the
[1:12:45] dead are declared the children of God by
[1:12:49] our Resurrection so it's already
[1:12:51] happened in our soul so we already have
[1:12:54] that deposit and it makes us live a
[1:12:58] worthy
[1:12:59] life well praise the Lord people oh it's
[1:13:02] just so hard to live a Christian Life
[1:13:04] it's not if you get the worthy one
[1:13:05] inside of you it's just as easy for a
[1:13:08] Christian to live a Christian Life as it
[1:13:10] is for a sinner to live their life in my
[1:13:12] view it's actually easier because at
[1:13:16] least our Master loves us and gave
[1:13:19] himself for us the devil don't love a
[1:13:21] one of his kids he has no heaven to take
[1:13:24] you to he has no healing when you get
[1:13:26] sick he has nothing he don't care if you
[1:13:29] cry he will never wipe your tears he'll
[1:13:31] never raise you up he'll never love you
[1:13:34] he'll never cuddle you in his arms the
[1:13:35] only time he cuddles you just to pull a
[1:13:37] knife out and stab you in the back but
[1:13:39] the Lord God loved you so much he come
[1:13:42] to this earth to die for you and set you
[1:13:45] free remember the devil cannot
[1:13:48] love he just simply can't do it now
[1:13:52] notice Jesus as he goes on boy these
[1:13:54] Sadducees by now they're fuming now that
[1:13:57] the dead are
[1:13:59] raised even Moses showed at the
[1:14:04] Bush when he
[1:14:06] cth the
[1:14:08] Lord the god of Abraham the god of
[1:14:12] Isaac and the god of Jacob God would
[1:14:16] have never called
[1:14:18] himself the god of Abraham If Abraham
[1:14:22] was non-existent
[1:14:25] come
[1:14:26] on that would be like God saying he was
[1:14:28] the god of the past so by God saying to
[1:14:33] Moses I am the god of Abraham the god of
[1:14:36] Isaac and the god of Jacob he was
[1:14:39] telling Moses Moses they're still alive
[1:14:43] cuz I can only be the god of the living
[1:14:48] amen hallelujah well if we could hear
[1:14:51] him speak back tonight he would say I am
[1:14:54] the the god of Jim bad I am the god of
[1:14:59] Homer Arnold on and on and on and on you
[1:15:03] would not hear him say that he's the god
[1:15:05] of any of those that died lost
[1:15:08] spiritually because he cannot be the god
[1:15:11] of the dead he is the god of the living
[1:15:15] that's why Elisha could say where is the
[1:15:18] Lord God of Elijah why because Elijah
[1:15:22] was not dead let me say to you tonight
[1:15:25] our friends our loved ones our family
[1:15:28] who have died in Christ Jesus he is just
[1:15:32] as much the god of Erica Parker tonight
[1:15:35] as he was when she was here in her
[1:15:38] Earthly body why because she is not
[1:15:43] dead praise the
[1:15:46] Lord
[1:15:47] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus notice
[1:15:51] Jesus goes on to say for he is not a god
[1:15:54] of the dead but of the living for all
[1:15:57] live unto him now let's go back to 1
[1:16:00] Corinthians 15: 40 there are also
[1:16:06] celestial bodies Heavenly in heaven
[1:16:11] existing in heaven of heavenly
[1:16:15] origin or
[1:16:18] nature there are also celestial bodies
[1:16:22] and bodies terrestrial
[1:16:25] t e r r e s
[1:16:29] t r
[1:16:32] i
[1:16:34] a
[1:16:36] l oh my goodness look at them last five
[1:16:41] letters t r i a l anybody in here relate
[1:16:48] to
[1:16:49] that so there is a Celestial which is of
[1:16:53] heavenly origin and Heavenly nature
[1:16:55] and there is a terrestrial but the glory
[1:16:59] of the celestial is one and the glory of
[1:17:02] the terrestrial is another so it's
[1:17:06] bodies on Earth the terrestrial bodies
[1:17:10] on Earth either animate or
[1:17:13] inanimate so humans animals life cells
[1:17:18] and so on now watch this some things
[1:17:20] that are to be now we find this life
[1:17:23] holds all kinds of evil so therefore the
[1:17:26] life that is to come won't have it this
[1:17:29] one has lust and sickness and death
[1:17:32] because what is it it's not the house
[1:17:36] that he's going to prepare this is a
[1:17:39] pest
[1:17:41] house how many knows what a pest house
[1:17:44] is congregation
[1:17:47] says sure well that's what you're living
[1:17:50] in BO we love us so pesto don't we man
[1:17:54] man alive we treat this thing like it's
[1:17:56] a House of Gold we treat this thing like
[1:17:59] it's a palace a castle boy we stand
[1:18:02] before the mirror and comb that hair and
[1:18:04] brush them teeth and clean them
[1:18:06] fingernails and man a lie we manicure
[1:18:09] and we work on this and that and the
[1:18:11] other it's courteous so the rest of us
[1:18:13] don't have to smell you when to come to
[1:18:14] church that's really nice but that's not
[1:18:16] the reason most of us do it we do it
[1:18:18] because of that vain Pride that we've
[1:18:20] got Amen Brother D I see from this point
[1:18:23] on I'm about to preaching Amen to but I
[1:18:25] can do that I've done it before but you
[1:18:26] see there's something about this that we
[1:18:30] when we look at it from a Heavenly
[1:18:32] perspective we are not gods and
[1:18:37] goddesses come on now Hollywood has made
[1:18:41] this out of this age and generation that
[1:18:44] we're in to where that people worship
[1:18:48] people they worship human
[1:18:52] beings oh my think of it but it's
[1:18:56] actually a pest house well he said a
[1:18:59] pest house is where they put all the
[1:19:03] diseased
[1:19:06] people so every one of us here tonight
[1:19:10] are pled that's
[1:19:13] right our body speaks the house we live
[1:19:18] in speaks that were
[1:19:21] afflicted by disease
[1:19:26] everybody remember how it was in the
[1:19:28] days of
[1:19:29] Co well I guess some days ain't really
[1:19:31] gone either they're still
[1:19:33] here and if anybody you'd be close to
[1:19:38] anybody and they had their mask on and
[1:19:40] they sneezed People Pumped to the cash
[1:19:43] register would take off running early I
[1:19:46] mean nobody wanted to be around nobody
[1:19:48] and then they finally proved all that
[1:19:50] whole thing was nothing but a big makeup
[1:19:53] and lie in the first place that's right
[1:19:55] yes sir well come on now and you realize
[1:20:00] that yet oh none of us wanted Co I
[1:20:02] didn't want it either I wound up getting
[1:20:04] it some of you wound up getting it was
[1:20:05] pretty bad but yet when you look at it
[1:20:08] even though we get over cold and flu and
[1:20:11] Co and all the rest of and you think I'm
[1:20:13] so better you're not better your house
[1:20:17] tells that you're still
[1:20:20] diseased right your house is a witness
[1:20:25] oh
[1:20:26] my listen this they wouldn't let anyone
[1:20:29] else come in the
[1:20:32] pestil because there's all kinds of
[1:20:34] germs flying around in there and the
[1:20:37] people will take these germs and be sick
[1:20:43] themselves and sin brought us into the
[1:20:48] devil's
[1:20:52] pastur oh but listen this
[1:20:56] oh but the other one is
[1:20:59] called my father's
[1:21:04] house now remember he's quoting St John
[1:21:08] 141 let not your heart be troubled you
[1:21:12] believe in God believe also in me for in
[1:21:15] my father's house are many
[1:21:18] mensions now he said it's not so much a
[1:21:21] house or a building it's a tabernacle in
[1:21:25] my father's kingdom are many
[1:21:29] Tabernacles amen many
[1:21:33] Tabernacles that's called my father's
[1:21:38] house so what happened to Erica
[1:21:42] Lance she moved out of the body that her
[1:21:48] father and her
[1:21:51] mother prepared for her
[1:21:57] she loved flowers so
[1:21:59] I built her a little flower bed and a
[1:22:02] couple things out on the
[1:22:04] side put her a canopy out on the back
[1:22:08] porch so she
[1:22:11] could sit out there and look at
[1:22:15] it I was down there yesterday
[1:22:19] morning and I looked around the corner
[1:22:21] of the
[1:22:22] house cuz I used to do it when she's
[1:22:24] still
[1:22:25] here and she'd be out there sitting on
[1:22:28] the porch and
[1:22:30] I'd way
[1:22:34] better but she wasn't there
[1:22:39] yesterday but I thought as her
[1:22:42] daddy I wanted to do that for
[1:22:46] her and then I had another
[1:22:49] thought if I would do that as her
[1:22:52] Earthly father yes sir what has her
[1:22:55] Heavenly Father
[1:22:56] prepared right here you
[1:22:58] go you see genetically I pass things to
[1:23:02] her genetically her mother passed things
[1:23:05] to her through our DNA and this and that
[1:23:07] and the other and also genetically her
[1:23:11] heavenly father passed things to
[1:23:14] her and that was when she prayed and
[1:23:17] believed and we prayed and believed and
[1:23:20] one of the last things Carol I was
[1:23:22] talking about it today one of the last
[1:23:24] things say she said to her daughter one
[1:23:26] of her daughters what a testimony it was
[1:23:30] when she said don't you ever forget it
[1:23:34] we
[1:23:35] serve a mighty
[1:23:39] God
[1:23:43] hallelujah I believe I helped mole that
[1:23:46] in her to say that I believe her mama
[1:23:48] helped mow that in her to say it but it
[1:23:51] was her heavenly father because that was

[1:29:06] were buried while there wasn't enough
[1:29:08] dust there and enough Ashes to fill a
[1:29:11] tablespoon and once it breaks down from
[1:29:13] a from ashes it goes back to acids and
[1:29:16] gases and finally disappears and there's
[1:29:19] absolutely nothing left but the Creator

[1:56:10] deacons trustees I hope all of us your
[1:56:13] pastor has both hands
[1:56:17] up Heavenly
[1:56:20] Father oh I've been wanting to bring
[1:56:22] this to him for a
[1:56:25] while it's been burning in My Heart
[1:56:30] Lord since I first heard about
[1:56:33] heaven so many years ago and it was so
[1:56:36] vague what I
[1:56:40] heard but after just hearing about it as
[1:56:44] a
[1:56:45] child I started having a longing and a
[1:56:48] craving to
[1:56:50] go I heard your pro Prophet saying the
[1:56:53] other day
[1:56:54] that you started dealing with his heart
[1:56:57] and he didn't even know how to
[1:57:00] pray so he said he wrote you a
[1:57:04] letter and tacked it on a tree in the
[1:57:08] woods and then he said he thought
[1:57:11] well I probably should try to speak to
[1:57:16] him so he knelt in that old
[1:57:19] shed and he said he didn't know what to
[1:57:21] say and didn't know how to pray but he
[1:57:23] said he seen a picture one time of
[1:57:26] somebody praying and they had their
[1:57:27] hands folded a certain
[1:57:29] way so he folded his hands that certain
[1:57:32] way and uh dear sir he said I I I I just
[1:57:37] I wanted to talk to you I wanted to
[1:57:39] speak to
[1:57:40] you and he said he you didn't say
[1:57:43] nothing back and he said
[1:57:46] sir uh I'm a terrible
[1:57:49] person I want to speak to you
[1:57:54] and he said a light appeared on the
[1:58:01] wall and it made a a
[1:58:05] noise and he said he said sir maybe you
[1:58:08] can't speak my
[1:58:10] language and I can't speak
[1:58:13] yours but if you've forgiven
[1:58:16] me would you let that light come back on
[1:58:18] the wall and he said there it appear
[1:58:20] again
[1:58:22] and as he said I headed out of that shed
[1:58:25] hooping and
[1:58:26] hollering he said oh if I'd only know
[1:58:29] how to dance in the spirit then he
[1:58:32] said and I thought you're was the
[1:58:35] prophet messenger of the age and when
[1:58:36] you found
[1:58:38] him he didn't even know how to
[1:58:41] pray he wrote you a
[1:58:44] letter he didn't know if you understood
[1:58:47] his language
[1:58:52] but he had the list embedded in his
[1:58:55] spiritual DNA all the time he just
[1:58:58] didn't know it was
[1:59:01] there so I heard Carol the other night
[1:59:03] telling the young people her
[1:59:07] testimony I saw the look on their
[1:59:10] faces whenever she told that she'd give
[1:59:12] her heart to you at the age of
[1:59:15] 16 she never heard the story of Daniel
[1:59:18] and the lion
[1:59:20] stand she never heard the story of David
[1:59:24] and
[1:59:25] Goliath she never heard it till after
[1:59:29] she was 16 years
[1:59:32] old she didn't know
[1:59:35] it but it was in her spiritual DNA
[1:59:39] embedded the
[1:59:41] list that she was called to be the bride
[1:59:44] of
[1:59:47] Christ and I believe with all of my
[1:59:49] heart she was called to be my bride as
[1:59:53] well we look back was talking about it

[2:07:58] them in our hearts it hurts and yet
[2:08:01] there's joy because we

[2:08:07] go as a brother preached they just
[2:08:10] changed their coats as the old song says
[2:08:13] I tell you the best thing I ever did do
[2:08:17] I took off this old coat and put on a
[2:08:19] new
[2:08:21] amen this old coat was
[2:08:24] tattered worn but Jesus gave me this new
[2:08:28] coat that's never been
[2:08:31] worn I'm so grateful for that aren't you
[2:08:35] friends Hallelujah and to know that
[2:08:38] that's more real than

[2:09:06] I'll ever see you if it is I'll be
[2:09:08] looking for you on the other side and if
[2:09:10] we get there that day we can say the
[2:09:12] only reason we're there friends is by
[2:09:14] his
[2:09:15] grace is that not true you look at your
[2:09:19] life and you think that when you was a
[2:09:20] young child

[2:09:24] remember when I was 21 year old and had
[2:09:28] just got out of the army and had all
[2:09:30] kinds of habits in my life and but I was
[2:09:33] down in an old building in Jonesboro and
[2:09:35] the Lord came into the room that day and
[2:09:38] I knew it was him because I felt him
[2:09:40] when I was a
[2:09:41] boy he wounded us and call us to himself
[2:09:44] we are to be the happiest people on
[2:09:46] earth when this world has gone totally
[2:09:48] insane that we have also lost our mind
[2:09:52] because we receed the mind of Christ to
[2:09:54] know what he wants done with the word
[2:09:56] for this hour what a privilege it is

[2:16:15] homesick for Arizona I said I just a
[2:16:18] longing to go to Arizona
[2:16:21] she said really why I said I don't know
[2:16:24] I said I can't believe someone born so
[2:16:26] far in the East would have such a long
[2:16:28] and to go west I said but I just
[2:16:32] homesick and about 2 minutes later the

[2:16:36] come at
[2:16:40] Arizona amen I believe that's the way
[2:16:43] this is you feel that longing just that

[2:17:24] to call you

[2:17:42] our spiritual DNA

[2:17:46] learned that 50% of her DNA comes from
[2:17:48] our mother and 50% comes from our father
[2:17:52] and that's why so many times people see
[2:17:55] our mother in us or they see our father
[2:17:56] in us because it's that DNA being
[2:18:00] expressed and then I was thinking lord
[2:18:02] of the spiritual and the spiritual DNA
[2:18:05] of God when the prophet of God said that
[2:18:07] we was birthed by the Breath of God and
