wonderful services for those of you that didn't get to stream I believe could be a real blessing to you if you go back and listen to brother Darrell services and and brother Mike's it's just outstanding just outstanding and the Lord just really wanted our brothers and just such a blessing I believe it'd be a blessing blessing to you the other guy you know about in many ways Ephesians chapter 3 verse 10 also want to mention to you then I want to certainly continue to pray for brother Doug Baker in his church and all that God would just work all this out forms first the church burning and didn't destroy the church but still get heaven heard what they're going to do is they'll tear it down remodel it got water damage more smoke damage than anything but we all God God works these things out for us but you can imagine if it was us if our church would have burned or would we be having church that they're not having it tonight because they're not yet sure where they're gonna go or what they're gonna do so we don't want to just you know be so positive that we overlook reality I'm positive I believe in been positive but don't believe in being foolish so for circumstances advanced insurance all kinds of things that has to be dealt with so let's just not remember them while the special meetings are going on but it's just pray for them that God will just work it out I believe we'll be able to advance and look forward and you know look at it and then say wow what God did sometimes it's just from here to here and going through all of that that we need one another brother Doug the kind of man he is he apologized to brother my brother Darrell myself and say I'm so sorry this happened you brothers us that what we're glad to be here with you we're glad to be here with you during this time to help carry part of this burden and this load that's what we're for we're the family of God and that right Amen well let's talk about that a little bit tonight Ephesians chapter 3 verse 10 we want to look again tonight at the church to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places Matt be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord so if he purposed it in Christ Jesus an eternity that lets me know Jesus is not Jesus Christ is not a created time being he is nothing less than Almighty God verse 20 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end or ages in eternity I hope you understand that that in eternity there will still be these things that will be unfolding and it will be made manifest by the church through Jesus Christ I'd like to be remembered tonight in prayer amen let's bow our heads if you would Heavenly Father we love you so much tonight thank you Lord for bringing Carolina back home safely but the Darrell was sister Cheryl thank you for the meetin's that you give us while we were gone Lord so appreciate the services here or there was really good services brother Wes and brother Joel we thank you for that father thank you for those that were ministered and now we come to another service we're asking you Lord for your help we know Lord Jesus any man that would be physically able would be able to read the word but it takes the presence of God to take the word and make it real to our hearts we believe that we're living in what your prophet turned to be the golden age great things are happening all around us and for that we are grateful Lord Jesus that we can see the light of the hour we pray that you speak to us tonight from your word minister to every heart the hands that were uplifted father be mindful of us tonight we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus amen god bless you Saints I'm sure all of you have heard today that Billy Graham has passed away ninety nine years of age we know that he had a place and in the gospel as far as ministering to a certain category of people probably not another man on the face of the earth that has ever lived in the Apostolic age or will ever live here after that addressed so many people as sparse speaking about Jesus Christ he was personal confidant of course to many u.s. presidents I'm sure most of you probably know even the Queen of England talked to him several times on different things and asks different types of opinions even though it was contrary to her church you know for a man to live the way that he did have the cop of recognition the type of publicity and all that and to be able to live a life that was not involved with women or involved with money involved with all kinds of things to me that's quite a life I said to me that's quite a life and we realized he did not see what we see but we know he was not called to that's right I'm convinced no doubt there would be many many people that will stand there that day and he will be be responsible for leading them as far as he did to me I thank God for a man that's lived that kind of a lie now because of that of course many people today and all have been asking oh my so what's going on he's he's gone does that mean we're in the Tribulation Period because those those two angels are gone hey you know what one of the best reasons you know that you're not in the tribulation period is because I'm still here and if you don't have that revelation for yourself I hope you get it before you leave tonight you're not basing it on me you're not basing it on your mama you're not basing on anybody else you're basing it because you know if there's a rapture I'd be part of that rapture that's right now remember when we're lead dealing with these two angels and all these types that's what they are we get in trouble when we try to take types and make everything excuse me about that time a reality when many times that's all it is is a type Oral Roberts was a type Billy Graham was a time Joseph in the Old Testament was a time Israel in the Old Testament was a time you can only run those types out so far when you try to make every point of a type answer to reality you're going to get into a mess of trouble so follow the types as far as they run and when the type stop stop and you'll be saved but if you go on with that then you get into error over the Donnie law what's all this mean look at all these nines look at all these fours look at all these sevens look trend I'm not a theologian I'm not a very great deep person I'm glad I'm not I'm just able to look at the simplicity of the word and not be tormented in mine because I don't have all the answers to a lot of ability a lot of this stuff that people try to make a bunch of junk out of it now brother branham was here no doubt he could tell us I see or know no profit in this age so therefore you're like me you're just a dummy and the sooner you recognize it the better off you'll be we know that the Word of God is being fulfilled and if we need to know anything about it well it'll already be written or it'll already be said so let's just go right on and live our lives and be ready for the rapture to come is that right now as the people of God we so thank God for all these great things and all the signs and all the symbols that God has given to us in his word but we realize that for the most of us it will not be that that we will mess up on for the most part it will probably not you misunderstanding something about or Roberts life or Billy Graham's life or maybe even a certain significance about brother branham's life that you specifically don't understand it will probably none of that that will get most of us in trouble it'll probably none of those things that will cause most of our greatest disobedience most of ours will be who ourself it will not be us misunderstand I understand something of that Billy Graham or all Roberts and what about this great man's position or that one in that mountain most of it ain't gonna be none of that it will be your own shortcoming in your day-to-day walk with God and to me that's where the significance should really lie do we not give hair in it hidden adherence rather to those things which are round a science and earthquakes and all those things that are happening absolutely but in all reality which one of those earthquakes has ever caused you to sin which one of the understandings or misunderstandings of the seven thunders has caused you to lust or to lie or to doubt hello am i speaking in a foreign language tonight now you know that that is the truth so which misunderstanding about the Son of Man or about sunset or Sabino Canyon or any of those things has ever caused you to fall short of the glory of God case you see why Satan wants us to emphasize that and not emphasize what we really need to emphasize praise the Lord now let's read this and God hiding himself in simplicity brother Andrew whoever sent me this quote about a week or so ago and I thought it was so good the church is Christ's body it's our individual amongst other individuals that is born in the kingdom of God that comes from the inside out and it's automatically lived a man the church is Christ's body it's an individual amongst other individuals that is born in the kingdom of God that comes from the inside out it's automatically live now as Israel in the Old Testament was the judgment are avenues by which God's judgment would be administered to other nations so is the church the New Testament church in the New Testament itself many of the tribes that are actually mentioned in the Old Testament many of the nationalities and many of the peoples of the Old Testament would only even be found and given a place in history by their relation to the chosen people of God either in a positive sense or a negative sense the only reason some people's name is even written in the Bible is because of something they did for or something they did against the chosen people of God now it's the same way in the New Testament that you find many people they would have no recognized sent by God himself because they're not recognizable attributes so the only way that they would actually their name even be found written in the Canon of Scripture is because they positively stood with the people of God or they negatively stood against the people of God may I belong to say a lot of those have been around this message and have left it and they have their limelight they have their time of Fame and popularity and publicity and the only way they would have ever even been known is because of their opposition to the message of the hour they would have never been known by nobody had it not been for this word so whether they want to acknowledge it or not their claim to fame is new right back again to the very message they hate how did Balaam get a place of notoriety because of standing against the people of God how did Noah how did a man how did many of those people in the Old Testament even find if it was one verse or several in the scripture it was because of their allegiance or their standing against the people of God then therefore God use the children of Israel as a measuring rod by which the judgment of God or the mercy of God would be meted out to these people look at Abimelech how do we find the Bimala finding his name written in the book of Genesis because of the way hallelujah because of the way that he treated Abraham or because of the way that his son treatise Isaac he would have not even been found hey in the Word of God I did not been for his association with the elect of God and because of that we understand this is why God places such emphasis on the body the mystical body which the New Testament terms is so much and calls it the church now notice this in first Timothy chapter 3 verse 14 these things write I unto thee hoping to come unto they shorten now watch this principle as we go into it how that God solidified the foundation of the church but what's the church itself is they columns of support of the truth not the other way around but if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God now at first looking at this one would think that Paul is giving them church order and how when they come into the church house how they ought to do now don't talk and don't run around and don't do this and that in the other that's not what Paul is addressing at all now notice this how it goes on and he says how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth now the house of God then is associated and identified as a building or as a tabernacle in a more permanent structure than the truth ever had in the Old Testament the truth of course was never actually embodied in the temple the truth was never actually fully embodied in the tabernacle it was only fully in came full embodiment when the Lord Jesus came upon the earth so you never find even though the Ten Commandments was laying on the Ark of the Covenant but yet the truth that was not all the truth and the truth never became embodied in the walls and the stone and the gold and the silver and the chapters and all those things it was never there because God never allocated his word to be made stone God wanted his word to be made flesh now what's Paul is going to give to us a very great perspective of the New Testament church and what a place said it helped a revelation of remember Paul himself identifies that he was one of the few in the New Testament about what's God had committed the mystery of the understanding of the body of Christ now it wasn't true the great mystery Peter struggle with it James struggle with it Peter even wrote about Paul and said he writes things it's really hard to be understood because God committed to Paul's understanding an understanding not only the Old Testament sacrifices the blood of the Lamb and all of that but a real perception of the New Testament bride how that that bride was to be the embodiment of the Godhead and that in that embodiment on the earth would be the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is deity then that church would become the very representation of God on the earth it would actually be the judgment seat of God how you would deal with that judgment seat would determine your eternal destination oh ma now what's this how that Paul brings us and alludes to something that the Hebrews of course would be able to identify with and that was paralleling it to the house of God or a temple by which they were going to to worship no he said if I Terry long that you may know how that thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God that is the church so it's it's an allusion to an edifice as it was called an edifice or a tabernacle or a place by which believers would come into and worship how thou may behaved ourselves on the house of God it is a spiritual house built up of lively stones now instead of the Old Testament courts that take Rock and they chisel it and chisel it and shills and bring it together but Paul is running a parallel to the Old Testament temple and how that God is now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost taking stones which is confessions and we confess that he is our Savior he is our Redeemer and that is a confession but the prophecy that is only confession that's as far as it goes what good does it do if you just pile up rocks so if we bring this he's my Savior well that's a rock he's my Savior that's another rock he's my Savior that's another rock but the Prophet said we don't just need to pile up a bunch of stones but we need stonemasons that'll take them stones and cut them and shape them and fit him into the house of God now look friends as much as you listen to the tapes and you ought to do it shame on you if you don't and is you read your Bible you still cannot shape yourself because you are not gifted and one of the fivefold gifts unless you're called to preach to be able to take that word and shape yourself into the body of God this is why God allocates and always has for 2,000 years under the apostolic dispensation gifts that would come and take the word and take the confession of men women boys and girls and be able to shape their lives by the gospel and able to positional help them find their place in the economy of God in that then it would be identified as a house of God being built up with lively stones under the Lord now we are built of course upon the foundation which is Jesus Christ himself and Jesus place many folds in this he is the foundation is also the door and is also the capstone to the entire building but yet the truths itself to what Paul is wanting to convey here to the believers is that they themselves are now the household or the economy of God that in them all together being baptized into the body of Christ they become the very mystical body of God and they're actually called the family I Amen the family of God and they're called by the name of Jesus Christ is that right now it's called the house of God it is called his house because it is him that is doing the building and as with any house when you live in that house that is temporary you know how it is in our house if we may try to beoh make them as you know as much maintenance-free as we can and we try to go with all brick and all paintable this and that in the other to minimize that work but if you live in it long enough and it's out on the elements or things you're gonna have to do you're got to paint every now and then and you know kind of giving it up lit it's the same way with the body of Christ how there because of out on the elements of Laodicea that our flesh and our spirit gets wore down and wore out and sometimes they have to be sanded off a little bit and we've got to have a new coat of paint not around your eyes now we got to be painted a little bit and then we've got to be kind of spiffed up a little our experience needs to be renewed and renovated why because this is a building of God and the Holy Ghost lives inside this Shimon temple so like on occasion the house needs to be repaired on occasion the house will need a restoration of experience of where you become renewed in the presence of God is there right now what's this how that Paul goes on to say that the house of God is the Church of the Living God so the house of God the edifice or the temple of God which is now being built upon the earth remember Timothy was this written around 62 or 63 ad something like that not just a couple of years before Paul is going to be killed so Paul is really opening up now part of the mystery of God and I want you to notice who is selling it to it's coming from a profit to a pasture so Paul is giving this writing to this other man of God and knowing that this man of God is gifted as well now other people will read this from Timothy of course in the hell for thousands of years but yet this man being gifted whenever he would hear it it would illuminate something to him about the body you imagine when Ibrahim is first time and he sat down and he began to read that all my the illumination that struck his heart I wonder how many times he read the same letter over and over again and yet God but make this more real to him and that more real to him that that he does us the same way don't know he says that the body that the house of God is actually the Church of the Living God now is actually contrasting in opposition to what was going on in the heathen Gentile world and that was that they would come to a temple they would come to a place in there they would worship and they would bring to these gods depending on which one it was many of them of course offered human sacrifice some of them would offer their children or virgin daughters they would offer go they would offer silver that offer all kinds of things and they would kneel down and they would pray this is of course Christianity versus idolatry 1961 and you'd find that get down and they bring a meat offering or something and they would get down there begin to pray and they like this image in front of them was not this god so much but an image about which this spirit would get inside of this God and as they would begin to pray and pray and they break into a trance and then lose the first consciousness and of course it was demons and those demons would come and get ahold to these people and they would actually some of them have out-of-body experiences they would convulse they would shake and jerk and have all kinds of emotional types of things and notice how Satan now impersonated the new verse by something that was so close oh my listen to the knell so Paul said no you don't have to do that you don't need to come and convulse and not saying that you don't get emotional now I think about what you want to become is you want to be the actual house of God itself now you're gonna have churches remember there was hardly any churches at all by the time this was written and what churches they were they were probably gathering in homes and in storefronts or whomever we looked at in the book of Acts with Nepal together there in the one place and the God let him come in as far as having a church like this a little bit almost unheard of have been one here and one down a brother bills and one dinette by the Richard Wilson's and one above the Thames and you know it was absolutely unheard of in this timeframe so they did not have in their mind when they read this about the church they did not have these four laws in their mind because they did not have a church but they was the church although they didn't have a church now we've got a church but are we the church if we're not careful we'll put more emphasis on the church than being the church oh ma it's important to come to the house of God behave yourself is it not why most of you brothers have never walk in that door back there with a head on your head if you did you'd feel so embarrassed and so ashamed and so humiliate you'd never think about stopping a Dairy Queen and bring it in on an ice cream or a sandwich and sending earring there's no way you'd do that there's no way as much as you love coffee or your drink whatever more that you'd ever think of bringing than your incentive and drinking a coffee while I'm preaching the Word of God you'd consider that to be so disrespectful and I agree with you a hundred percent but what about the same respect to the real house of God and the real house of God is just not your body but it may be that brother and sister that you don't get along with soil now God has brought to life the temple when Solomon completed this great building in the Old Testament God Himself come into this house with smoke and glory and Shekinah light but the building itself is just as dead after God come in as before God come in it did nothing to the building itself when God comes in your building he not only quickens your soul he quickens your mortal body into obedience to the word please be to God notice this now Paul says that you may know how that you ought to behave yourself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of truth now what you listen now don't let this stumble you the truth is not the pillar and the ground the church is I figured I'd get that response we are built upon truth this Bible these tapes these books cannot promote their self reservoir it was not the Bible that kept the Bible alive it was people who did it because it was not even necessarily printing presses it was people with a burden when the Bible was outlawed who was it that was the pillar and ground out the truth it was not the Bible the Bible didn't print the Bible the Bible did not risk his life because the Bible does not have life listen now the Bible is the word that it takes the Holy Ghost to quicken that word and make it live in the days of Luther when they begin to print the Bible it was not the Bible with a hand on the side ever cranking out another copy of itself the Bible was not going into the printing press the Bible did not load donkeys down with itself and the Bible lead the donkey with the Bible and the bag and the Bible handed out the Bible who was it it was those that were a part of the Church of the Living God because the church the church is the Grands and the teller of truth the church is the support work of truth well I'm gonna preach it with or without you oh you say bless God these tapes are live without the bride that shows how wrong you are that shows your understanding is a normative Antichrist spirit now if you preach that the tapes live of their self the Bible lives that itself the tapes built himself the Bible promotes herself you're contrary to the Word of God it is the Church of the Living God that preaches the truth to her it is the Church of the Living God that preserves the truth it is the Church of the Living God hallelujah that has the ability of spiritual multiplication what is it that's kept the truth alive the church what is it that keeps the truths growing to this day that's Hertz would it be much easier and much safer we'll just by 300 seats the Africa then delecia to China to France we'll buy tickets and we'll ticket them under a Tate name we'll buy one seat we'll call 2/3 Exodus another seat we'll call it gives Jesus Christ that's the name we'll put on the ticket will fill the entire plane with tapes and then when we get the plane wherever it's going what will happen then unless somebody comes on that plane and gets them tapes and there's something lesson the plane and the tapes both will set right there and rot come on church why cause in tapes ain't got no feets them tights ain't got no hands all come on at you what I'm talking about sign with your buyer but if we Silvan airplane up with bibles and we send over to indonesia wherever more unless some more will come on that brother there and open that door one say give me one give me one give me one I'm gonna take it out why because the support of the Word of God instead Church of the Living God it is not tape players it is not the internet it is not a microphone it is not a mechanical station of man it is the body of Jesus Christ it is you and you and you young people and you and you [Applause] the church preaches it the church preserves it the challenge transmits it from generation to generation notice in first Kings chapter 7 verse 21 Solomon is now in the building process of the house of God of the Old Testament the temple he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof yah him yah yo Keem je ya Yahweh yah him and he set up the left pillar and he called the name thereof Boaz so here are the structural supports of the house of God and they give them to men's names amen Boaz of course means sweetness or swiftly yo Keem is the twenty-first order of the Levitical priest under the reign of David also the 4th son of simeon so here he takes human names animal that is going to be the support of the entrance to the house of God why not call it Gabriel why not call it Michael one I'll color wormwood while I call it Mars or Jupiter these were great men in the building of the body of the Old Testament so they embody hallelujah the support and give them what not angelic names not divine names but names of men July can you're really gonna like this next on then Revelation chapter 3 verse 12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar and the temple of my god I'll make a pillar in the temple of my god don't you see what the overcomers are doing they are now pillars in the temple oh you are only reflecting in a minor way what you're going to after a while that's roots that you stand for who has it that will cause holiness to still be stood for in this hour the Church of the Living God who liveth in water baptism of the dáil in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the Church of the Living God who will defend marriage between one man and one woman the Church of the Living God will we convert everybody absolutely not it's not our place to convert innovati it's our place to stir and supply that's well brother don't you'll have less and less friends and people who like you'd lesson lesson it'll be more dangerous and all that I understand all of that but when he comes I'll still be like this people getting away from and they got nothing doing my position I'm a pillar let people do whatever they want to that has nothing to do with me him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my god in this amazing there is no temple in the new city you know the Bible says that John said I looked around and there was no temple but the Lord God and the lamb so here you are here you are identified you are the underlayment you're the one who bears the reproach and the weight all the weight of the word of being identified all we could have some out and not say this is don't preach on these things no more and nobody will know and we won't get in trouble that ain't what we'll call for he didn't call a piece of macaroni he calls sons and daughters of God to be pillars brother macaronis alright if you're making lasagna but if you're building a house of God you wanna rock you know piece of lasagna so you are actually part of the embodiment of the mystery of God in the eighth day I will make you part of who I am you held me up on the earth you was laughed at ridiculed I saw on the science of time or shifting I saw in things everywhere was going backwards you stood right there you never wavered you never stutter you never compromised you should come on come on I'll make you a pillar this thing just to preachers either this is to him and her that overcomes him that overcometh all i make a pillar of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god it won't be Hakeem or go as but a pillar has to be named over the God don't you say you get the name of the city the name of the king I will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem what's cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will ride upon him my new name friends the church are here don't get this now think of how many churches in all and Asiya that are supporting the standard of holiness from the Bible even many of us had come from the Pentecostal background we go back to those that we world you with years ago which they lord have mercy how they compromise how they fall in a life of what a little bit of truths I have so they're no longer supporting or substantiating it oh well you know I maybe we're just too legalistic maybe you don't matter about the women cutting their hand wearing lipstick and all that maybe it made that birdie don't matter no more I draw the Bible don't say that lifts it I agree it doesn't I've never found a scripture in the Bible which says wrong for you to lay with your daughter any you knuckleheads try that you're gonna get a knuckle sandwich I know all kinds of things that the Bible does not directly say but the Bible speaks it may not call lipstick it may not call Winston cigarettes it may not call Jim Beam but there is a character and nature of God that prohibits us from going contrary to God's nature I personally don't need a scripture that says it's wrong to smoke cigarettes cause my Bible tells me God will destroy him that defiles a temple of God [Applause] well praise the Lord [Applause] so if the time goes on will the the stability of truce and water baptism will it matter anymore if it's in the name of the Lord Jesus let's just look around our message if we have another 10 years added to the lord have mercy what's it going to be even around our own ranks who's going to hold up the standard of holiness me for one am I gonna send with him what about tinsel in the name of the Lord Jesus new birth baptism of the Holy Ghost not just believing God sent a prophet who's gonna hold up predestination before the foundation of the world who's going to hold up there's a difference between the bride and the church we are so what are we doing we are the columns under these truths God sent His Prophet to bring the truths right we couldn't support him other down until God sent a prophet to bring it now they've been brought and the emphasis has changed Oh y'all trying to take by the rent price absolutely not nobody will ever take his place he was the one to bring them or the one to supportable to God notice the word pillar means a column such as by which a building is supported a firm prop or support and the prop under truths is the church but you said always thought that the truth held up the church you're partially right but you need to get out of the ground you see the truth is foundation and the column is said on top of foundation and then on top of the column comes a reveal word for the hour what is it logos men day of the day and then we have the Rendell side of the word which comes and quickens that which is needful for the time we're living there so our foundation is the revelation of Jesus Christ built upon the principles of His divine person then he establishes the column on top of the foundation then he reveals the message of the day and puts that on top of the column and then he says now tackle the devil it's built on me I built he'll know me and I set me on top of her you're in a good place your sandwich is right between the word a couple of years ago brother Fred Mullins and his son brother Fred jr. was here we're standing right outside my office out there and somebody took a picture of me and then where's all laughing y'all probably maybe seen the picture but it's me and Fred jr. and Fred senior what were laughing about is I called us an Oreo dark white and dark but we made one good sandwich now don't you understand here's a revelation of the Lord then God didn't write a tape God didn't even lay the Bible the God like columns support work on this rock I will build my that's why any ministry that tries to work away from and apart from the church is Antichrist in principle case you see why this is first in our generation radio preachers TV preachers internet preachers that don't need no church same things coming right inside the message - well hallelujah I'm sorry friend aw no sorry that that is not apostolic it's contrary to the foundation the original sure I don't need the church we're all men if you don't need the church or an O Christ these pillars and the days of Caligula these pillars and the days of Demetrius in the days of Nero when they didn't even have a written Bible many of that first century Christians in the first generation live their entire life as a child of God and never even saw one book of the New Testament then purchase preached for nearly 30 years without a new Testament what did they preach the truth look friend it may come to a spot we have to remove our services from the internet the pressure make it so great on us before we leave here we may have to shut down a lot of avenues and outlets they may come in and take our books and tapes they may want our Bibles who knows exactly what it'll be but it won't stop us at all we'll go back to sending out CDs will meet in basements over here this Sunday we're making yours and next Sunday we'll meet over there next Sunday we'll meet and wrong Mountain Wednesday night we'll meet somewhere else they ain't stopping us from having Church why because we are the support of this word although and the difficult to guess brother Donny we should hide hide nothing if there was ever a time that we need to come out and let people know there is any truth in this land it is I I'm not talking about being foolish I'm not talking about looking to be martyrdom I'm talking about when the Holy Ghost gives you that unction stam brother what sustained it and the time the persecution when Nero so he did the Christians that he would wind them up and tar and rat calls around them and line his garden paths and set them on fire at nighttime so he could walk to his garden with their flesh burning off their bodies stench of human flesh rising through the streets of Rome what was it they kept it from falling wirless the columns was that a Bible was it a commentary was that a radio preacher was it a singing convention it was the true Church of the Living God you couldn't burn it out of him you can't drown that out of him you can't throw him in prison deep enough ha their city is calling out their destiny in time they are look friends if people on this earth are living like Hale there ought to be some people on the earth living life effort I'm talking about you just flying around through the clouds this is what I'm talking about if you are heavenly you will have a desire to support the truth now the truth except jesus knew how to build a church he didn't build it on purchase he didn't build it on paying ties he said on this rock revelation of who he is I will build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it the salt said would have come against the Church of the Living God had it been any other foundation other than the true church it would have tumbled into ruin decades ago it would have troubled into decay and rottenness and the devil thought he had done it to the dark ages but God started in a Reformation what was it one man understood a revelation of the just shall live the face God started raising of your team started resurrecting again a principle a pillar of truth by which the ports or the house of God must be raised but you can't build no ports on one post you gotta have more than one justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the whole ego hallelujah the holy ghost made way for the holy ghosts himself a very token life of God now the full support of the entire building is share oh four corners just forget safe let's back to the Holy Ghost restriction against the token life the entire structure can be held up under the auspices of this world that's why we'll live through these storms I believe the sign or don't believe the signer hiccup the sign or throw up the sign do whatever you want to do about it the church moves our Oh will destroy them you and her house so if this message had been committed to tape and books where would it be as I said several years ago in Tanzania brother Daryl's been there took them little brothers ebooks at the time and I saw brothers who had lived in holes in the ground and didn't wear clothes until they come to the message you tell me the message right you'll put the right clothes on me giving them them little cheapy book smile remember not what they even cost you or the thought I'd give them a wedge of cold go out among the must sign go out among some of them tribesmen that are still cannibals and witness this trois at a player cannot speak but tape player has no legs no hands no eyes look friends don't sit around just wait for me to do it all all over done great missionary work if God lays it on your heart to tell somebody about Jesus Christ and this word do it or if I'll just give them a Bible I'll give them a tract sometimes that's a lazy man's way out sometimes they need a God with some skin on it oh praise be to God I'm not encouraging you to get it overhead we don't you're talking about but we're not careful they get to a place we don't say nothing no more mother done and what if they're not bribed if they're not bribed the Holy Ghost so leads you don't it a lot far not Abraham far you'll go a lot fine that's as far as you'll feel to go but you might win that soul to Christ and then come up to the Tribulation Period their name will be associated with you for eternity it is the church's responsibility to defend the trust maintain it and fight for it if need be now this is tough on us because blessed are the peacemakers how can you be a blessed peacemaker and a blessed war monger most people that don't know me they don't think I like peace they think I like trouble I hate trouble I hate being controversial I hate getting attention some health centers smile on me right now say you don't know me but if God has called me to be brother Darrell if I'm no more than just a little ring on the bottom of the pillar if I'm one of them fluted columns that began in in Corinth many many many many hundreds and hundreds of years ago I found no more than a band by the west's on the bottom wherever God's placed me in the part of this living all God hallelujah this living world in the end time I want to give my support and strength if I'm one of them that's got to be hated in the spy in order to bear no reproach maybe God chose different ones to bear more than others if so that is so then let me find my part and let me do my part how many say Amen with me tonight to be a ring in the house of God to be if you're no more than a decorative piece on the column whatever God wants you to be for us to get under that column insane right there we'll go as Solomon there will stand between Laodicea well stand between worldliness and we'll post in the collapse why because that house will come down but we will stand the her praise be to God as part of the body of the Living God we will stand for purity we will stand and say we still need to pray we still need to read our Bible we still need revival we still need to pray for the signal come on church we still need to be on fire with God if not our church what a turn into ruin your rot rot in that pew or you set about God's grace not as long as I'm here and if I die and go by the way of the grave I pray to God God give you somebody they'll take the same stand but the preacher came standing alone you might be part of the food it pardon that that comes and gives support I'm not talking that your money I don't want your money you know that I want you don't want your so so and you're not an in holy wedlock to the eternal but this life this word this message of the hours not a bunch of doctrines to you it's who you are [Applause] praise God the people of the world feel no interest in defending the truth the majority the church is ready feel no interest everybody's in such a hush mode they don't have to be against the law to speak against certain things it's just against the law of social media then if you say something they post you on Facebook or post you on YouTube and whatever and you get some much backlash they make you crawl back on a hole somewhere and apologize well I'm sorry I'm sorry I should have had more wisdom I I wish I hadn't said that don't you see what you're doing they're backing down Christianity our nation's supposed to be a god-fearing nation bunch of liberals from the left taking shots right to hell come on church I want to take your guns I want to take your religious we're afraid them they want a bevel to assault youth I want to be able to make fun of you and if you cross what they believe they'll hang you up let me say there are some pillars of the living cause still left at America that are young man there are old me there are young girls they are men and women filled with the Holy Ghost and they are standing strong they will not compromise they will not let the devil take their freedom they will not let the devil take the Liberty on the Holy Ghost in some of the brothers brother Darrin brother Doug was talking nether that after one of the services there we say can you imagine in brother Panama well that would have been this service tonight been able to sit down you know brother man him himself never got to preach him me miss his churches got to preach in his own brother Perry started the one in Tucson wamba's and Nomar November the 25th I just heard it yesterday today where he starts the church there two or three to the churches actually message churches ever started you imagine a brother branham available to walk been able to walk here behind this pulpit and preach to us you imagine the Liberty that he'd been able to preach can you imagine what God would have said to us mostly his preaching was full gospel business many Pentecostals and Baptists and Methodists and well they let him go oh but don't you see what God God God come in at what is the message of been left and handed in Pentecostals what if they'd been left in the hand of them Full Gospel businessman now most of them totally turned away from the principles they heard taught years ago it was not left to them that was not left to the United States they would have voted it out it was not left to the government of France or Russia it was committed to the church God said there's not another entity on the earth that I can commit my truth to and know it will stand and my wife [Applause] the church if it's a citrus stabilizer it is not adulterated all but better Donny I know this certain certain preacher oh so do i I'm talking about certain certain I'm talking about yo Keem and Bullas I tell my friend Jack and John and Joe and whoever mold to build their own little columns up and they say I'm now the support get out of the way doughface get out of the way you compromised her come on their children now these preachers ain't nothin no more than a fat Pillsbury Doughboy that's all they are they're in it for them what they can get out of it oh my tickle there oh you're the greatest preacher in the world you're this and that and there ain't no bow as that ain't no yaki meeee no man a God's here to build his own kingdom on the earth he's here to give his support to the house of God the work of God the people of God the stability because the stability of the truth on the ass is totally the church living God it will be so secure from the foundation to the columns to the capstone that Jesus saw the whole building in visions when he said upon this rock I will build my church so he saw the columns he saw the capstone by the way he saw the whole thing and he said the gate said he'll not let me tell one thing friends if you got a low line building it's you know just a real low line thing that ain't too much danger of any much shaking going on but Jesus has got a great big old tall building with Credle big tall columns and a great big old tall hit office and the bigger it gets the more risky it gets but he ain't afraid he ain't one bit nervous Jesus don't even carry insurance on this building because he ain't gonna need it hey man we ain't got insurance we gotta surance and that assurances on this rock I'll build my church it's better than state fine it's better than Blue Cross and Blue Shield it was a Red Cross and a world seal upon this rock I'll build my church and I commit my truce to these fellers [Applause] when the storms blow and the earthquake shake she'll never move now you know right off I'm gonna tell Matt her flesh I'm telling Matt the god part you see this entire thing is built out of God parts the foundation god parts the pillars God parts the capstone God parts but stay preserved on earth unshaken why because the columns are preserved you see if God don't have a plan to preserve the columns than his committal of truths to weigh on those columns can break him down but he's so convinced because in his mind he remembers you you see when he wrote the Lamb's Book of Life and he put the Lambs name in there he spoke and wrote to your name at the same time when God slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world glory to God your sins were forgiven youth in all you had to do so right now here in time he said till the Holy Spirit would call you praise be to God but brother Darnell I feel so weak and I feel so shaky yeah sure that's the human part of you that's not the column Peter was not the column not Peter the man Peter the see it's not Donny the man don't put the Donny you're so strong you see me where's my sword God you ought to see me at terms you ought to see me at times when it's sheathed you ought to see me a few weeks ago when I was stealing or something couldn't eat lost several pounds of weight a lot of stuff going on I didn't lose my face no no but I felt humanly I hate feeling humanly as you felt divinely once human but just don't cut it no more I knew he would move I just knew you would but it didn't know how and he was silent I begged him for a word I begged him for one word just I'd hear a little something in a solemn and then I don't my scripture and care what's in the care I opened up my Bible this morning to look how I was going to read and look at what a soul praise the Lord praise the Lord but that's one more oh I guess I'm no no one's ever been that I'm sorry [Music] praise be to God o you see me goes through fights you see me goes through such things what a man I love peace I've always hated fightin I'm the oldest among seven by nature by that position I've always been a peacemaker you think God I got a sense to you but when I feel my Lords truths being challenged that's what you say I'm gonna put it back in I'll walk in there about 15 minutes after then don't leave me what does Satan I hope it wasn't nothing bad but I mean why would you share those things of this so you could realize you ain't got a God for a pastor you got a man so you can realize preachers deacons trustee we're human beings and God ain't building his church on the flash of Donny Reagan of the flesh and or the patron they go on and say god never built his church on the flesh of william branham he built it upon the revelation of himself with such confidence that they'd say the gates of imagine brother Darrell's he looked down through time he's selling here oh he's so Caligula he saw all that was an empress and so what they do he saw the here I stand he saw the days of Luther saw it all knew it knowing exactly what it I said yeah it'll be fine y'all Kim well children that angel didn't come of the songbook we didn't come with some kind of love letter out of Hollywood becoming a book in his hand and it wasn't the big book of life it was the little lamb's book of Thoth what's he calling pillars pillars praise God praise don't you love it aren't you glad you're part of the church the Church of the Living God let's bow our heads together thank you Lord Jesus Oh father it's almost more than our minds can comprehend you building such a spiritual edifice such a great majestic building such a thing that the angels of God desire to look into that the Angels stooped down and look was bewilderment and they wonder oh it wouldn't have been no great thing if you had a built or Church on Gabriel wormwood Michael they've never had a fault never even had a bad thought in their minds praise God but you chose to take men that were converted truly gonna hurt women that maybe was so full of the devil but Mary Magdalene men that used to be so sorry and rotten they'd spend their babies milk money to buy moonshine or whiskey or shoot up a dope but you saved them and filled them with the holy ghost and you gave them a portion of that truth and it's burning in their heart they can't preach they may not be able to already handle the word as far as doctrinally but they gotta tell somebody how the fire got lit they have a little deposit of truths on their shoulders Oh Lord Jesus help us I pray at our church we will never compromise I realize Lord God it's a scary thing when us as mortals come under opposition in our minds we wonder and we think what will happen which way will it call Lord Jesus it's not built upon our flesh and for that we are so thankful if it had been built on the flesh of the Apostles hitter never made it to Pentecost but it was built upon your promise praise God it looked like it was totally lost in Catholicism for the hundreds of years of dark ages but you didn't send out a new translation of the Bible you didn't send out a commentary but you got a hold of a man praise God all they had fanaticism how they went off and they had to have a counter-revolution to balance up what they started same in the days of Wesley but yet the full truths had not been restored yet then Lord God you got a hold of a little Kentuckian for his to be to God when you started restoring these truths that have been lost down through the ages once you took him from the earth then men around him start saying I'm the man I'm Elijah I'm Joshua I'm the 8-day messenger I'm Malachi four and a half and Samantha I'm Malachi four and five eighths and I'm Malachi four and three quarters problem that is we don't see no such things that in the Word of God all those men run to the end and many more will go the same way but there are men who are born of the Holy Ghost they are born of the new kingdom this is why they don't want to build a kingdom they want to support one praise God they've got enough sense to know it in all about them and how gifted they are how wonderful and they are and may dreams they have and how many songs they can sing and how great they can play the guitar they know if they can do anything there are only here as a support to the Church of the Living God the truths the true setting about us it ain't about happy validate about my ministry it's about the body the support work of the body help us and pray Lord God if we've been dilatory lord we've not been doing our part even the local assembly fathers there's some here and they look at their selves you know while I've not really got behind the church the way I could have I've not really got behind brother Darnell I've not been the support to that man of God but I could have been I've got lazy I'm not prayed for him sometimes I don't show up to church high for time I'm not really stood with that servant of God Lord God help me help me Father I know more than a chapter at the top of the pillar fun no more than a carve ruse if I'm no more than a band that's carved around it God I'm part of the support work oh jesus help us Father I pray we love you Lord God we love you not Jesus oh ma what a wonderful time awaits us on that morning of the Resurrection when all the building will get up praise God God there will be a resurrection of the building of God those of us that are alive we're going to be here and they'll be they'll come up first of course all glory to God the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain we shall be changed praise be to God and we'll get together with the rest of the group and the Prophet said think of it missing people they can't find you no more but you're getting together with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth so we're here but we're not here we're here but we're invisible and the devils are trying to find us but they came find us cause the house of God's getting together praise be to God we worship your Lord Jesus oh praise God how many would raise your hands and not just say Lord I want to be a part of the house of God Lord I'm just a house I've you said but Donny I I just cook and I raise my kids and try to take care of what in the world could I do sisters you can pray you can read your Bible be a witness to your little children be what God's called you to be God your brother Daryl leaving in the morning and heading over to France going all that distance to preach Saturday night to services on Sunday and fly back God may lay it on your heart 2/3 of caught in the morning but the Daryl gone just to wake you up in the middle of the night give you a burden for him you might not even know what he's going through in some foreign lands but the Spirit of God would incorporates you and his deliverance and add to your reward on the other side so God laid it on your heart oh praise God and maybe brother Daryl sent a pair that dance Lord I remember that night over in France yeah I wanted to let you know down this sister here that set behinds you three fused behind you there I woke her up through a comp in the morning laid it on her heart in order to pray for you that's journey through and you didn't know

message part of this church friends this is your church this Saint match are told by the darkness church it ain't brother Donny's Church I'm only just a shepherd that singer too kind of Li Jin feeds and all that this is your church what do you want your church to be if every person that come to this church is like you what would it be but it'd be filled with prayer warriors would it be filled
