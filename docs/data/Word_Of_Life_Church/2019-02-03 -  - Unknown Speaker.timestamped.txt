[37:52] him in my life be lost without him
[37:55] wouldn't you
[37:56] amen well it's certainly good to be back
[38:00] here with you this morning if you have
[38:02] your Bible we'll turn to the book of
[38:04] second Kings keep you standing you
[38:10] believe the Lord has something for you
[38:11] this morning the Bible says that he's a
[38:18] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[38:20] him and I know that if you need to touch
[38:25] from him this morning he can speak to
[38:27] you
[38:27] Lord's been heavy on my heart since last
[38:31] night for this sermon that I'm going to
[38:33] preach to you this morning and I pray
[38:36] that you just give me grace this morning
[38:38] give me some time
[38:40] amen I want to really deliver my heart
[38:43] the Lord has just a burden upon my heart
[38:45] and I believe it's for somebody this
[38:48] morning I'd like to preach to you on a
[38:51] sermon out I've titled a time when Kings
[38:54] go to battle a time when Kings go to
[38:58] battle
[38:59] verse one says and it came to pass after
[39:02] the year was expired at the time when
[39:05] Kings go forth to battle that David sent
[39:10] Joab and his servants with him and all
[39:13] Israel they destroyed the children of
[39:16] Amon and besieged Rabbah but David
[39:19] tarried still at Jerusalem this one
[39:24] mistake this one bad choice led to such
[39:29] calamity in this man's life verse 2 says
[39:34] it came to pass in an evening tide that
[39:37] David arose from off his bed and walked
[39:39] upon the roof of the king's house and
[39:41] from the roof he saw a woman washing
[39:44] herself
[39:45] and the woman was very beautiful to look
[39:47] upon and David sent and inquired after
[39:50] the woman and one said is not this
[39:53] Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam the wife
[39:56] of Uriah the Hittite David sent
[39:59] messengers and took her and she came in
[40:01] unto him and he lay with her verse 5 and
[40:04] the woman conceived and sent and told
[40:07] David and said I am with child and David
[40:10] sent to Joab saying send me Uriah of the
[40:13] hittite and Joab sent Uriah to David
[40:16] verse 15 and he wrote in the letter
[40:19] saying set you Uriah in the forefront of
[40:22] the hottest battle and retire you from
[40:25] him that he may be smitten and die and
[40:29] it came to pass when Joab observed the
[40:31] city that he assigned Uriah unto a place
[40:34] where he knew that valiant men were and
[40:37] the men of the city went out and fought
[40:39] with Joab and there fell some of the
[40:42] people of the servants of daiva David
[40:44] and Uriah the Hittite died also one more
[40:48] scripture will have you turn over to the
[40:50] book of Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes
[40:54] chapter 3
[41:06] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 and we'll
[41:10] read verse 8 verse 1 says to everything
[41:13] there is a season and a time to every
[41:19] purpose under the heaven verse 8 a time
[41:24] to love and a time to hate a time of war
[41:29] and a time of peace a time of war and a
[41:34] time of peace let's bow our heads
[41:36] Heavenly Father Lord my heart is heavy
[41:42] this morning Lord and that is stand here
[41:46] in your presence Lord and these people
[41:48] have came father we've all have
[41:52] expecting hearts this morning we're all
[41:54] thirsty hungry Lord for your word we
[41:57] pray God that your word would find its
[41:59] place in every avenue of our life Lord
[42:02] may every person in this building be
[42:05] sensitive to the relevance of the word
[42:07] and what area the Lord speaking to them
[42:09] knowing God that you'll speak in many
[42:11] different ways I pray God you would be
[42:14] with me Lord as I deliver tried my best
[42:17] to deliver this to these people I pray
[42:20] God we could learn something this
[42:22] morning from the life of a man that's so
[42:24] great so profound Lord and so alike ours
[42:29] I pray God that you would take hearing
[42:31] hearts speak to them this morning father
[42:34] may you plant a seed in someone's life
[42:37] we pray take control we ask in Jesus
[42:40] name amen you can be seated
[42:55] a time when Kings go to battle I'd like
[42:57] to say a few things if you keep your
[42:59] Bible handy we're going to use it a lot
[43:01] this morning keep your place there in
[43:03] second Kings chapter 11 we're going to
[43:05] be going back and forth but I'd like to
[43:08] say just a few things and to establish
[43:10] some principles that very often maybe
[43:13] can get overlooked or very often can be
[43:17] forgotten but I believe that they're
[43:19] relevant for you this morning you cannot
[43:23] hide from God you cannot hide from God
[43:28] you can hide from me you can hide from
[43:31] your pastor you can hide from your wife
[43:34] you could hide things from your husband
[43:36] you could hide things from your children
[43:38] but you can't hide from God God sees
[43:42] everything he knows the intention of
[43:44] your heart for every choice that you
[43:45] make every decision everything that you
[43:48] say in conversation God looks at one
[43:50] thing your heart and God the Bible says
[43:53] he who searches the heart and knows the
[43:56] mind so God knows us inside and out you
[43:59] cannot hide from God the Bible says in
[44:02] Ecclesiastes 8:11 because senate's
[44:05] against an evil work is not executed
[44:08] speedily therefore the heart of the sons
[44:11] of men is fully setting them to do evil
[44:13] another word Solomon says that just
[44:16] because we don't reap what we sow over
[44:19] night doesn't mean that we don't reap
[44:22] what we sow but the Bible says God will
[44:25] not be mocked whatsoever a person sews
[44:28] that person shall also reap
[44:31] but the Bible says because sin it's
[44:34] because that reaping doesn't always
[44:36] happen overnight you can live a life in
[44:39] sin for years thinking you're getting
[44:42] away with it you can live a life in
[44:44] secret sin for 10 years 15 years and
[44:47] think just because judgment has not been
[44:49] passed that somehow we've slipped by or
[44:52] somehow
[44:53] we've gotten by God but understand this
[44:56] you shall reap what you sow
[44:59] you know many times we could pray for
[45:01] children for years and not see anything
[45:04] in wonder if God's here in our prayer
[45:06] and then one day the appointed time
[45:08] comes and that seed that you've been
[45:10] watering for years and years and years
[45:13] comes to harvest we're told of a bamboo
[45:16] seed that the heart the farmer that
[45:18] plants a bamboo seed he has to plant
[45:20] that thing in faith because it's very
[45:22] different than other seeds you see
[45:25] usually a farmer and human nature is to
[45:28] work based upon what we see if we don't
[45:31] see results we give up and so a farmer
[45:34] under normal circumstances plant the
[45:37] seed puts it in the ground and begins to
[45:39] water it he begins to labor for that
[45:41] seed he begins to give it sunlight he
[45:44] begins to nourish it and address it and
[45:46] the next day he comes and maybe there's
[45:48] a sprout up and maybe there's a green
[45:50] leaf and he's told by that sign that my
[45:53] efforts are paying off but the farmer
[45:56] who plants a bamboo seed is very
[45:58] different because although he waters it
[46:00] although he dresses it although he
[46:03] nourishes it for days and I forget how
[46:05] long the process I think it's something
[46:07] like six months he sees absolutely no
[46:11] sign whatsoever that his efforts have
[46:14] done anything at all the only thing he
[46:17] can do is put faith in the process the
[46:21] only thing he could do is put faith in
[46:23] nature knowing that nature will run its
[46:26] course and after six months of just
[46:29] doing the same thing over it's much like
[46:31] when you pray over and over and over and
[46:34] over and you wonder is God ever gonna
[46:36] hear my prayer is anything ever gonna
[46:38] change am I ever gonna reap the harvest
[46:40] of what I've been sowing but after six
[46:44] months that tree that bamboo shoot'
[46:46] shoots up six feet tall in just a couple
[46:49] weeks you know this is the way it is
[46:54] with sin for many years we could sow the
[46:57] wrong seed and think that we don't see
[47:00] any result from it so it's okay and
[47:02] something starts so small in our heart
[47:05] your sin will find you out
[47:07] the Bible says in numbers 32:23 if you
[47:11] will not do so behold
[47:13] you have sinned against the Lord and be
[47:16] sure be sure your sin will find you out
[47:24] the Bible paints a very amazing picture
[47:28] of a man who thinks he's sinning and
[47:31] getting away much like a fugitive you
[47:34] know when a fugitive a person commits a
[47:36] sin person commits some heinous act and
[47:38] he goes on the run running from the
[47:40] police running from the government
[47:42] running from the law and that man thinks
[47:45] he can get away with an alibi I really
[47:47] pulled one over I really pulled one over
[47:49] no one's ever gonna know and I got away
[47:51] with it and now I got all this money or
[47:54] whatever the profit was but the part
[47:57] that you don't see is the man his entire
[48:00] life he's always looking behind his
[48:01] shoulder he's always miserable wondering
[48:04] if anybody's gonna find out and
[48:05] eventually that pressure will cause him
[48:08] to make a mistake and the law the whole
[48:11] time is chasing him looking for him
[48:13] watching for him watching they know
[48:15] eventually he'll make a mistake and this
[48:18] is the picture that the Bible paints for
[48:21] a man running from God and your sin
[48:25] literally follows you and haunts you and
[48:28] chases you you may move from church to
[48:31] church you may move from place to place
[48:34] but you can't outrun God you can't
[48:37] outrun the Spirit of God if you're a son
[48:41] of God he'll chase you he'll haunt you
[48:43] he'll bring you to justice
[48:49] and the Bible says the wages of sin what
[48:53] it pays its payment you know what it
[48:56] pays death pleasure for a season
[49:00] thinking that we've gotten away Isaiah
[49:03] 29 15 and 16 woolen - they'll wall unto
[49:06] them that seek deep to hide their
[49:09] counsel from the Lord and their works
[49:11] are in the dark and they say who sees us
[49:14] and who knoweth us no one's gonna find
[49:17] out this just happened once
[49:19] she'll never know he'll never know I can
[49:21] just cover it up and it'll be okay and
[49:22] I'll just move on and the pain that it
[49:24] would cost him for me to confess that
[49:26] would be
[49:26] greater than the reward you know who's
[49:29] talking to you the liar the father of
[49:33] lies are you here this morning
[49:39] woe unto them now listen job 34 21 says
[49:43] for his whose God's his eyes are upon
[49:48] the ways of man and he seeth all his
[49:53] goings there is no darkness nor shadow
[49:57] of death where the workers of iniquity
[49:59] may hide themselves human beings think
[50:05] they can hide from God and eventually
[50:07] this secret sin begins to drive us from
[50:11] the presence of God the first thing that
[50:14] Adam and Eve do after the Fallen nature
[50:16] comes in after that after the fall
[50:18] happens
[50:19] one of the first attributes is to hide
[50:22] to cover up to make a religion to ease
[50:27] the conscience to cover themselves and
[50:30] the first thing that a person a
[50:33] Christian will do after living a life of
[50:35] sin that no one knows about they'll
[50:38] begin to hide themselves Satan will 'you
[50:41] don't know what you don't want to know
[50:42] what the devil will do to you he'll push
[50:44] you away from church he'll push you away
[50:46] from fellowship he'll push you away from
[50:48] brothers and sisters you'll become
[50:51] reclusive as is not attributes of God
[50:55] the Bible says in him there is no
[50:58] darkness at all there is only light
[51:01] there is only exposure listen Christians
[51:05] should be the most transparent people on
[51:08] the face of the earth we have nothing to
[51:11] hide we have nothing to run from it is
[51:14] the devil who pushes you into a closet
[51:17] it is the devil who tells you don't
[51:20] confess don't make it right
[51:21] it is the devil who puts fear in your
[51:24] heart to stay under that religious cloak
[51:31] Kayne's unconfessed sin turns him into a
[51:35] vagabond a fugitive he begins to run and
[51:38] run and hide he never has a dwelling
[51:41] place don't you know this is exactly
[51:43] where the devil wants you don't you know
[51:46] this is exactly the first thing that
[51:48] happens after you sin is condemnation
[51:51] who do you think you are look at you
[51:53] you're nothing you're not a son of God
[51:55] you had all that victory was raised in
[51:57] your hands in church and now look at you
[52:02] you think that's God who's telling you
[52:04] that my Bible says in the book of
[52:07] Hebrews let us come boldly you know the
[52:12] reason why people don't take advantage
[52:14] of this Scripture is because we think
[52:17] that this is Paul is speaking of when we
[52:19] feel spiritual when we feel on the
[52:21] mountain when we feel like we've done
[52:23] something good and boy I'm feeling so
[52:25] good and I'm feeling so spiritual I
[52:28] could just march on into the presence of
[52:30] God but this is not the application that
[52:33] he's even referring to you want to know
[52:36] when he says to come boldly unto the
[52:38] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[52:46] [Applause]
[52:48] hallelujah and find help in the time of
[52:53] me listen the devil pushes you away and
[52:56] tells you stay away and you're no good
[52:58] and your rotten God says come unto me
[53:01] the Bible says you have a father who is
[53:05] faithful and just hallelujah to forgive
[53:09] your sins
[53:11] but the church say Amen this morning to
[53:14] forgive our sins and cleanse us from all
[53:18] unrighteousness aren't you glad that's
[53:22] the kind of God that we serve listen we
[53:25] don't have a father who kicks us when
[53:27] we're down and pushes us away but he
[53:29] says in all embrace you if you'll
[53:31] embrace me I'll clean you I'll wash your
[53:35] mind of the condemnation listen we're
[53:40] all failures
[53:43] we're all just a bunch of no good save
[53:49] by Amazing Grace His grace becomes more
[53:55] amazing the more you serving Satan
[53:59] because Sarris Cain becomes a wonderer
[54:01] listen sin will take you further than
[54:05] you want to go it'll cost you more than
[54:11] you're willing to pay and it'll keep you
[54:14] longer than you want to stay you say
[54:18] brother Matt why would you preach on sin
[54:20] this morning why would you take such a
[54:22] topic that's so simple because I believe
[54:26] we're living in the most sinfully
[54:29] deceptive age where sin is more
[54:32] accessible than it's ever been before
[54:34] everybody wants to be Revelator's
[54:36] everybody wants to get more knowledge
[54:38] and understanding but the problem is
[54:40] most people have never even really
[54:43] repented you find a person listen your
[54:47] level of victory is based upon your
[54:51] level of repentance and repentance is
[54:55] not a prayer repentance is an action
[55:03] Satyam them sorry cane becomes a wonder
[55:06] or satan pushes them Elena you noticed
[55:08] this a wonder or a person who have no
[55:11] direction in life they just sort of go
[55:13] in a cycle always up always down always
[55:15] in always out one week in one week out
[55:18] profit totem camp stars they go from one
[55:21] camp meeting to the next their spiritual
[55:24] there their shouting in church but on
[55:26] Monday victories gone they get on the
[55:30] sin cycle you know what that is sin
[55:32] confess commit the same sin confess
[55:36] commit the same sin confess commit the
[55:39] same sin confess around and around and
[55:42] around and never have with the prophet
[55:45] called a v-day a victory day listen I
[55:50] don't want to go in circles with God I
[55:52] want to have victory is that what this
[55:55] church once this morning I want victory
[55:58] in my family I want victory in my home I
[56:00] want to put my foot down once and for
[56:03] all once and for all and be finished
[56:06] with sin their conscience becomes seared
[56:13] as we said last night that searing
[56:15] process after you sin and you don't
[56:18] confess you think it's okay well it's no
[56:20] big deal you know just happen once and
[56:22] you know it's okay and I'll get over it
[56:24] and you know she doesn't need to know
[56:26] and he doesn't need to know and they
[56:27] don't need to find out and you know
[56:28] goodness the pain that would cause and
[56:30] he did you don't over the mat what would
[56:31] happen hell you know what your dude
[56:33] you're doing what Eve did your reasoning
[56:36] your reasoning listen there's only
[56:38] honesty Christ can only give you real
[56:42] victory in confession the Bible says
[56:45] confession is good for the soul
[56:48] confession is good for your soul it's
[56:51] good for your family it's good for your
[56:53] prayer life
[56:57] the conscience becomes seared when we
[57:01] repeatedly sin now notice this here in
[57:03] second Samuel we're gonna look at the
[57:05] sin with David and Bathsheba something
[57:07] that no doubt you've looked at many many
[57:09] many times before but I want you to
[57:11] notice and we're gonna we're going to
[57:13] show you a lot of things out of the
[57:15] scripture turn back to 2nd Samuel
[57:18] quickly if you could second Samuel
[57:20] chapter 11 the sin is not dealt with as
[57:27] the movie Hollywood puts out a film when
[57:29] David and Bathsheba and they focus on
[57:31] the sin the Bible doesn't the Bible
[57:35] mentions at one time and then it spends
[57:36] a lot of time telling you the
[57:38] consequences Bible never is sent to
[57:42] glorify sin but it says these things
[57:45] were written for our examples you
[57:48] believe that 2nd samuel evident came to
[57:52] pass after the year was expired this is
[57:54] Missy this is the beginning of months so
[57:57] we know what season it is and seasons
[57:59] very important this is not winter time
[58:02] you don't go to war a king doesn't start
[58:05] his campaign in the middle of the winter
[58:07] especially not in Tennessee where
[58:11] there's no fruit there's no vegetation
[58:12] it's all cold King doesn't go to wars in
[58:15] but you have to realize there was a
[58:17] certain season there was a certain time
[58:21] that takes place when a king prepares
[58:23] for battle he doesn't do it in the
[58:25] summer definitely not in South Carolina
[58:27] where there's gnats and mosquitoes and
[58:29] snakes and bugs and it's hot and humid
[58:33] you see it's very important notice for
[58:37] the King to discern the season that he's
[58:40] living in because if he fails to discern
[58:44] the season he won't realize when wars
[58:47] taking place and when there's a time of
[58:49] peace taking place notice this the year
[58:53] was expired teen Kings go forth to
[58:55] battle and David sent Joab his servant
[59:01] so David decides not to go that's what
[59:04] the Bible says he sent Joab and his
[59:08] servants with him in all Israel and they
[59:11] destroyed the children of Amon and
[59:13] besieged Rabbah but David carried still
[59:16] at Jerusalem so David decides to stay
[59:20] home he decides now you know y'all go on
[59:24] ahead y'all go on without me I know I've
[59:28] been there many other campaigns and
[59:30] we're just fighting Amon now it's very
[59:32] interesting the Bible says that they
[59:35] destroyed the children of Amon yet in
[59:37] chapter 10
[59:38] David's fighting Amon but he's there
[59:41] he's warring with Amon but now in
[59:45] chapter 11 the battles not over business
[59:49] is not finished and David decides I'll
[59:53] go on ahead I'll stay here no big deal
[59:57] you know just go on ahead without me and
[59:59] you know Yodas go ahead no it's amazing
[1:00:02] how much different listen it's amazing
[1:00:05] how much different this David is then
[1:00:07] the David we read about chapters and
[1:00:10] chapters before this is the same man who
[1:00:13] comes on a battlefield is a little
[1:00:15] shrimp and he looks at a big tall giant
[1:00:18] and says who is this that defies the
[1:00:23] armies of the Living God who is this
[1:00:27] uncircumcised Philistine David says
[1:00:30] today I'll cut your head off with my
[1:00:33] sword and I'll feed it to the birds
[1:00:36] you notice the courage in david you
[1:00:40] notice the vigor in david you notice the
[1:00:43] energy the seal that he has very
[1:00:46] different from this david that wants to
[1:00:48] stay in bed all morning and have
[1:00:51] somebody else go do the work
[1:00:53] you see david has such courage and he
[1:00:57] has such such a zeal to go forth in the
[1:01:00] battle but listen David was not firing
[1:01:02] from the hip David was not just speaking
[1:01:05] for you know just quick and and just
[1:01:07] being a smart aleck but David had a
[1:01:10] reality in his life and do you want to
[1:01:13] know where that reality came from I want
[1:01:15] to say a few things number one the Giant
[1:01:19] does not just show up when
[1:01:22] a in your life a giant doesn't just show
[1:01:26] up knocking on your door one day but
[1:01:29] there's a process that leads to Goliath
[1:01:32] there's a process that leads to the
[1:01:34] giant are you with me this morning
[1:01:37] there's a process that he moves to
[1:01:40] before he comes to Goliath now notice
[1:01:43] this principle Jesus says this when you
[1:01:46] pray be not like the hypocrite who goes
[1:01:48] into the city makes their arms in public
[1:01:51] but you enter your secret closet notice
[1:01:58] this principle enter your secret closet
[1:02:02] and shut the door shut the world out
[1:02:07] shut the atmosphere of Lady Asiya out
[1:02:10] and he says and pray in secret and what
[1:02:14] you have done in secret your father will
[1:02:20] reward you openly publicly so David's
[1:02:27] life does not happen upon one day he
[1:02:30] stumbles upon a giant and neither does
[1:02:33] the giant suddenly show up in your life
[1:02:35] and challenges your home and challenges
[1:02:38] your kids and challenges your job and
[1:02:40] challenges your marriage listen we have
[1:02:44] goliaths that we're facing today and
[1:02:46] they're challenging your home and
[1:02:49] they're challenging your job they're
[1:02:50] challenging your testimony they're
[1:02:54] challenging what you believe and what
[1:02:56] your convictions are the question is are
[1:03:00] you willing to fight but this giant
[1:03:05] doesn't just show up one day but notice
[1:03:08] when nobody's watching when nobody's
[1:03:12] there
[1:03:12] when nobody's with David when he's all
[1:03:16] alone an African lion comes out of the
[1:03:20] woods
[1:03:22] and the Bible says that David slays the
[1:03:25] lion and it says there was another time
[1:03:28] that a bear comes out and David says
[1:03:31] with my bare hands I slew this bear that
[1:03:35] was coming to attack God's sheep but
[1:03:38] notice nobody's there to watch nobody's
[1:03:44] there to pat him on the back nobody's
[1:03:46] there to pray for him nobody's there to
[1:03:48] encourage him no pastor or minister is
[1:03:51] around to give him advice but God has
[1:03:54] chosen this battle to be all by himself
[1:04:00] he's all alone nobody's there you
[1:04:05] imagine this was David as he comes
[1:04:08] before Saul and David says I was in the
[1:04:12] field one day Saul and he said in the
[1:04:14] lion came out to devour God's sheep and
[1:04:16] I slew the lion with my hands and there
[1:04:20] was another time in my life that a bear
[1:04:23] attacked and I fought with this bear you
[1:04:27] imagine if I came here this morning and
[1:04:29] brother Louis singing and singing and
[1:04:31] singing it turns out 30 40 50 minutes
[1:04:33] his brother Matt here is he here yet
[1:04:35] and I show up late and finally I come
[1:04:37] out of the door oh I'm so sorry for
[1:04:40] being so late Church now I apologize if
[1:04:43] y'all don't forgive me
[1:04:44] you'll never believe what happened I
[1:04:45] stopped over here at the gate the
[1:04:47] circle-k down here to get gas and a
[1:04:50] pumping gas on my way to church was
[1:04:52] gonna be there on time and all of the
[1:04:54] sudden out of nowhere a lion comes out
[1:04:59] and he was gonna attack my family and I
[1:05:02] grabbed him by the neck and and I broke
[1:05:03] his jaw and then then if that wasn't
[1:05:05] enough a bear a black bear comes out of
[1:05:08] the woods and I put him in a chokehold
[1:05:11] and I body slam me and I grabbed his
[1:05:13] jaws and snapped him
[1:05:16] and that's why I'm late you'll forgive
[1:05:19] me now turn to your Bible
[1:05:23] you always think two things I'm a liar
[1:05:26] an idiot or insane but you see God
[1:05:32] chooses this battleground when nobody's
[1:05:36] watching when nobody's there when it's
[1:05:39] all in private when nobody's there to
[1:05:41] pat him on the back when nobody's there
[1:05:43] to pray for him
[1:05:44] David is slaying lions in his private
[1:05:47] life because there's time in a day when
[1:05:50] Goliath is gonna challenge his public
[1:05:52] life you see private victory equals
[1:05:58] public reward private victory equals
[1:06:02] public success and David could say with
[1:06:05] faith the same God who delivered me out
[1:06:09] of the hand of the lion and the bear
[1:06:10] shall also deliver me out of the hands
[1:06:14] of this uncircumcised Philistine you see
[1:06:17] when your life has been going through a
[1:06:19] private life and private victory and
[1:06:22] private battles the lion comes first and
[1:06:25] the bear comes next and then comes
[1:06:29] Goliath you see private success equals
[1:06:35] public victory
[1:06:43] but I got bad news I got bad news just
[1:06:49] like private success equals public
[1:06:52] victory private defeat equals public
[1:06:58] disgrace you see a person doesn't fall
[1:07:05] too Goliath one day and you hear about
[1:07:07] him falling to sin some horrible thing
[1:07:10] you think my goodness sister
[1:07:12] such-and-such brother such-and-such how
[1:07:15] could such a thing happen you see what
[1:07:18] you didn't see was the line of lust that
[1:07:20] was consuming that man what you didn't
[1:07:25] see is the Lion of temptation and the
[1:07:27] bear of temptation that was feasting on
[1:07:31] his mind and now Goliath comes and wipes
[1:07:36] him out private defeat equals public
[1:07:41] disgrace David finds this out the hard
[1:07:46] way listen David comes to battle notice
[1:07:50] this in chat invert chapter 11 verse 2
[1:07:52] look in your Bible it came to pass in an
[1:07:55] evening tide that David will let's back
[1:07:58] up to verse 1 came to past year was
[1:08:00] expired at the time when Kings go forth
[1:08:01] to battle David sent Joab and his
[1:08:03] servants with him and all Israel and
[1:08:06] they destroyed the children of Amon it's
[1:08:08] so amazing to me that at the season of
[1:08:11] war not at the season of peace but at
[1:08:14] the time when a battle is taking place
[1:08:16] at a time when the enemy has rushed in
[1:08:20] like a flood at the time when the enemy
[1:08:22] is onslaught in attacking the home is
[1:08:26] the very time that the King says austell
[1:08:31] y'all go ahead without me I'm just going
[1:08:36] to stay here it amazes me and I wrote
[1:08:38] this down under inspiration at a time
[1:08:41] when dads go to battle at a time when
[1:08:46] moms go to battle at a time when a
[1:08:49] church goes to battle
[1:08:51] time when preachers go to battle at a
[1:08:54] time when Christians hold a standard in
[1:08:57] this world it's a time of battle friend
[1:09:01] listen it's so amazing to me that at the
[1:09:06] very time you watch a family and a
[1:09:08] family loves God it serves gods on fire
[1:09:11] for God when the kids are small but
[1:09:13] suddenly the kids become teenagers and
[1:09:15] now they need a king now they need a
[1:09:19] spiritual father now they need a strong
[1:09:22] man now they need a dad who will hold a
[1:09:25] conviction now they need a dad who won't
[1:09:29] bend and who won't bow to this pressure
[1:09:33] now they need a church that holds the
[1:09:35] banner of Jesus Christ it's this very
[1:09:39] time when usually mom and dad get
[1:09:42] schooled church gets cold we begin to
[1:09:46] get empathetic sympathetic to this world
[1:09:51] and at the very time that parents that
[1:09:54] children need a strong King listen a
[1:09:56] king is more important than just being
[1:09:58] there it's more than just the image but
[1:10:01] he's there to pray for his troops he's
[1:10:03] there to encourage them he's there to
[1:10:05] keep them around listen your children
[1:10:07] don't need a judge they don't need a
[1:10:11] critic are you here this morning
[1:10:13] they don't need criticism and skepticism
[1:10:16] they need a king a real man a real woman
[1:10:20] that will stand with them they don't say
[1:10:23] I'm praying for you the sadness is
[1:10:28] there's such a disconnect in the home
[1:10:30] children feel like they can't talk to
[1:10:31] the dad wife feels like she can't talk
[1:10:34] to the husband and the lion and bear
[1:10:38] waiting David decides to stay home
[1:10:43] listen he's not there to write Psalms
[1:10:51] David's not staying home to study the
[1:10:55] Holy Writ he's not there to get more
[1:10:59] spiritual you know what David's staying
[1:11:01] home for to sleep
[1:11:03] he's just downright lazy that's what
[1:11:09] your Bible says he stays home and stays
[1:11:13] in bed and it's so amazing to me this
[1:11:17] one mistake calls David so much do you
[1:11:22] want to know who pays for this mistake
[1:11:25] you want to know who pays when mom and
[1:11:28] dad earned at war when mom and dad are
[1:11:31] not on the battlefield you want to know
[1:11:33] who pays and suffers his children his
[1:11:43] children suffer at the hand of his own
[1:11:45] laziness and it's so amazing to me that
[1:11:50] David is fighting Eamon in chapter 10
[1:11:53] and we come to chapter 11 and he's still
[1:11:57] fighting Eamon because he doesn't finish
[1:12:00] Eamon off and now because of his failure
[1:12:03] to fight amon look at what happens to
[1:12:06] his kids and do you want to know
[1:12:08] something amazing you've heard of a God
[1:12:10] in the Bible and Amon is who made this
[1:12:13] God have a place because it was a man's
[1:12:16] God the god of Moloch Moloch the child
[1:12:24] killing God the family destroying God
[1:12:29] the child consuming Moloch they would
[1:12:32] take their firstborn and throw their
[1:12:34] baby to the flames and because David
[1:12:36] fells
[1:12:37] to battle the system to battle the lady
[1:12:41] of seeing atmosphere because David sells
[1:12:44] to pray for his kids because David fells
[1:12:47] to hold a standard in his home are you
[1:12:51] here this morning church
[1:12:53] because david fails to go to battle on
[1:12:56] behalf of his family now the god of Amon
[1:12:59] mullah look what happens he loses kids
[1:13:04] they look quiet now y'all are gonna be
[1:13:06] quite as a mouse when we get done notice
[1:13:12] this he doesn't stay there to meditate
[1:13:14] on the law of Moses he doesn't say there
[1:13:17] how many Psalms do you think David wrote
[1:13:19] from this penthouse Castle David only
[1:13:25] starts writing Psalms again after he
[1:13:27] falls and sees his own pride in
[1:13:29] arrogance
[1:13:30] that's when David starts right in Psalms
[1:13:32] again David's in this great castle he
[1:13:35] can see everything look at verse 2 came
[1:13:38] to pass in an evening tide that David
[1:13:40] arose from off his bed you know what you
[1:13:46] want to know when the Bible says an
[1:13:48] evening tide is about 3 a.m. about 3
[1:13:53] o'clock in the morning
[1:13:54] David's alarm a 3 a.m. hole perfect time
[1:14:06] to get out of bed when normal people are
[1:14:09] asleep
[1:14:10] listen I know God can wake you up at 3
[1:14:13] a.m. to pray have somebody on your heart
[1:14:15] maybe you're up because of circumstances
[1:14:17] but normal people are not up every night
[1:14:20] at 3 a.m. prophet of God says evil
[1:14:25] spirits come out late don't stay out
[1:14:28] late
[1:14:31] does this church still believe that
[1:14:36] david wakes up in the middle of the
[1:14:38] night he's getting up
[1:14:40] notice this habit in his life staying up
[1:14:44] til all hours of the night Bible says he
[1:14:50] woke up in an evening tide David arose
[1:14:52] walked upon the roof of the king's house
[1:14:54] and from the roof he saw a woman washing
[1:14:57] herself and the woman was very beautiful
[1:15:00] to look upon you'll notice we don't know
[1:15:01] what he's seen there's no sins taking
[1:15:03] place yet that we know of David could
[1:15:06] have accidentally seen something listen
[1:15:07] you can't only stop what you see but you
[1:15:10] can't turn your head prophet said you
[1:15:12] can't stop birds from flying over but
[1:15:14] you can sure stop them from building a
[1:15:16] nest before a man
[1:15:20] you can search stop them from stopping
[1:15:24] and the Bible says he sees a woman now
[1:15:28] notice this in verse 4 David sent
[1:15:30] message and I'm sorry verse 3 and David
[1:15:32] sent and inquired after the woman no
[1:15:33] notice nothing's wrong yet because in
[1:15:36] those days if she's eligible he can have
[1:15:38] her right the Bible says he took he sent
[1:15:43] servants and inquired and one said verse
[1:15:46] three is this not Bathsheba the daughter
[1:15:48] of Eliam
[1:15:49] the wife the wife of Uriah the Hittite
[1:15:57] it should have stopped there
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:04] you see there's always a temptation
[1:16:07] the Bible says he'll never tempt you
[1:16:08] above that which you can be tempted but
[1:16:10] with that temptation he makes a way of
[1:16:12] escape exit leave now run for your life
[1:16:21] but it doesn't stop there
[1:16:24] Bible says he took her and she laid with
[1:16:26] him verse 5 the woman conceived and sit
[1:16:28] and told David I am with child no notice
[1:16:31] this is so amazing how much different
[1:16:34] this life is than the David before this
[1:16:38] man David has riches he has everything
[1:16:42] he can need he doesn't worry about bills
[1:16:45] he doesn't worry about food he doesn't
[1:16:48] worry about a job no anxiety no stress
[1:16:51] no worry no pain best doctors best car
[1:16:54] best house and we say man I would like
[1:16:59] to be that David I'd like to be that man
[1:17:04] who just has everything notice
[1:17:06] prosperity often is very dangerous I'll
[1:17:13] ask you a question what David would you
[1:17:16] rather be the David that has no bills to
[1:17:19] worry about hey that sounds good can I
[1:17:22] get an amen anybody man never worry
[1:17:26] about bills again never worry about
[1:17:27] money really and not play the lottery I
[1:17:33] II mean I can get by with this all the
[1:17:36] prosperity and no worry no bills no
[1:17:40] anxiety oh how I wish I had no stress in
[1:17:43] my life it's amazing what we pray
[1:17:45] sometimes Oh God take away the stress
[1:17:47] Lord oh if I just had a piece oh if I
[1:17:49] could just get to the place where I had
[1:17:50] 10 grand in the bank didn't have to
[1:17:52] worry about nothing and no bills and all
[1:17:53] if I can just get to the place where I
[1:17:54] was always ahead had a little bit of
[1:17:55] extra money Oh mom I'm the only one I've
[1:17:58] ever prayed that huh
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:02] if I could ever get to that place David
[1:18:05] was at this place now would you pick
[1:18:06] that David or would you pick this David
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:12] have y'all seen so hey is anybody seen
[1:18:17] him I haven't got sleep for four nights
[1:18:21] I've been watching for him ducking and
[1:18:23] diving
[1:18:24] I've been fearful for my life hidin
[1:18:27] behind rocks sleeping in the woods
[1:18:29] stress anxiety worry waking up in the
[1:18:33] middle of the night how am I ever gonna
[1:18:34] get by where to get killed which David
[1:18:38] would you rather be but let me tell you
[1:18:42] something the most carnal corrupt sinful
[1:18:46] David was the David who lived in the
[1:18:49] castle and the most spiritual fervent
[1:18:53] zealous man was the man David who had
[1:18:56] stress and worry and pain listen your
[1:18:59] trials are sent for a reason God knows
[1:19:02] best
[1:19:03] he puts worrying trials and anxiety for
[1:19:06] a reason Church you should thank him and
[1:19:08] praise Him this morning this David
[1:19:13] listen when do you think he wrote Psalms
[1:19:16] the most blessed book and some of our
[1:19:18] favorite books in the Bible or the
[1:19:20] Psalms you think these Psalms were
[1:19:22] written when David was kicked back on a
[1:19:24] couch but these Psalms that we love so
[1:19:28] much were written out of the darkest
[1:19:30] hours
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:33] hallelujah Oh friend I don't know about
[1:19:36] you that gives me courage that gives me
[1:19:39] joy to know that my trouble is for a
[1:19:42] reason my pain is for a reason
[1:19:45] hallelujah the trials God sends my way
[1:19:48] the Bible says the trial of your faith
[1:19:50] is much more precious than that of gold
[1:19:55] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be his
[1:19:59] name
[1:20:00] David's trials his strength is found in
[1:20:04] his weakness but no one say when he is
[1:20:06] tempted I am tempted of God for God
[1:20:09] cannot be tempted nor does he tempt any
[1:20:11] man but when we are tempted listen when
[1:20:19] each one of us is tempted when he is
[1:20:21] carried away with his own lust and when
[1:20:30] lust has conceived it brings forth sin
[1:20:33] and sin brings forth death
[1:20:39] David sins snowballs David's sin gets to
[1:20:43] a place to where it starts out so small
[1:20:47] it starts out so little but a sin begins
[1:20:52] to snowballs and get out of control
[1:20:55] David find some place it finds to a
[1:20:57] place to where he killed Lee comes from
[1:21:00] adultery then it leads to murder because
[1:21:02] listen sin does not stay the same sin
[1:21:06] grows you tell a lie you'll tell a
[1:21:08] bigger lie you tell a bigger lie you'll
[1:21:10] tell a bigger lie if you start out with
[1:21:13] dishonesty you'll end up with more
[1:21:16] dishonesty
[1:21:18] I believe a Christian should be the most
[1:21:21] honest person I believe a Christian
[1:21:24] should be the most honest transparent
[1:21:26] open nothing to hide person the problem
[1:21:29] is as so many people's prides got in the
[1:21:32] way it's led them to the closet of sin
[1:21:35] we think we're something so we can't
[1:21:38] come up for prayer because we're a
[1:21:39] preacher we think we're something cuz
[1:21:46] we're a deacon or a Tsar that this side
[1:21:48] of the other musician or a song leader
[1:21:50] something in the church you see pride
[1:21:53] gets in the way the devil wants to do
[1:21:57] one thing to you it's to bury you in
[1:21:59] condemnation it's to bury you and guilt
[1:22:02] listen God has a job for you to do and
[1:22:05] you can't do the job when you're
[1:22:07] burdened with your own mistakes Christ
[1:22:10] came to set you free
[1:22:12] freedom hallelujah to free us from the
[1:22:16] guilt of sin hallelujah he came to give
[1:22:23] us liberty not condemnation and guilt if
[1:22:30] you're under the weight of sin this
[1:22:31] morning if you're under the weight of
[1:22:34] guilt this morning I'll give you a
[1:22:35] scripture he who the Sun sets free is
[1:22:38] free indeed he's free from everything
[1:22:44] he's free from the guilt of his past
[1:22:47] hallelujah he's free from the guilt of
[1:22:50] his consciousness David's sin begins to
[1:22:59] grow out of control notice this turn to
[1:23:02] psalms chapter 32 we won't be much
[1:23:04] longer
[1:23:04] sums chapter 32
[1:23:13] notice this this is David now listen
[1:23:16] from the outside everything seems normal
[1:23:20] David's conducting business he's moving
[1:23:23] about the city everything seems good
[1:23:25] everything seems fine
[1:23:26] he's meeting greeting shaking people's
[1:23:29] hands all brother David oh what a good
[1:23:32] brother little does everyone know
[1:23:35] David's about to tell you what was
[1:23:37] behind that smile David says in verse
[1:23:41] three when I kept silence in other words
[1:23:46] when I didn't confess when I didn't come
[1:23:50] clean what I didn't expose myself my
[1:23:55] bones he says my bones waxed old I was
[1:24:01] like an old man but a young man my bones
[1:24:04] hurt I ain't listen sin affects your
[1:24:07] health secret sin affects your health
[1:24:16] David says my bones waxed old through my
[1:24:19] roaring oh the day long my hand was
[1:24:25] heavy upon me he says for day and night
[1:24:28] my hand was heavy upon me my moisture my
[1:24:32] tears my sincerity my passion that I
[1:24:36] used to have and I used to cry and I
[1:24:38] used to raise my hands and tears would
[1:24:40] fall when I heard about Jesus and his
[1:24:43] amazing grace now my moisture is turning
[1:24:48] to the droughts of summer imagine this
[1:24:53] is the man who looks so good
[1:24:55] but down on the inside this empty what a
[1:25:00] miserable place to be in what a misery
[1:25:04] David had in his life he says I kept
[1:25:07] silent my bones waxed old through my
[1:25:10] roaring so David tells us very clearly
[1:25:12] sin hurts
[1:25:16] sin destroys sin breaks you captive
[1:25:24] it puts chains on your life chains in
[1:25:27] your mind you become eventually like
[1:25:30] that man legion eventually his sin
[1:25:33] pushed him to death
[1:25:36] eventually it pushed him to the
[1:25:38] graveyard David's sin begins to hurt him
[1:25:45] he's losing sleep he can't sleep he's
[1:25:49] losing weight he's pal
[1:25:51] all because of unconfessed sin all
[1:25:57] because he's failed to discern the
[1:26:00] season in an area of his life and now
[1:26:03] he's a casualty
[1:26:05] I hope so bad that you catch my pretty
[1:26:10] what I'm trying to preach to you this
[1:26:12] morning I'm trying to tell you you're
[1:26:14] not in the time of peace you're in the
[1:26:16] time of war and you better wake up and

[1:26:24] ready to fight this battle you better be
[1:26:26] ready not to lay down not to sleep not
[1:26:29] to get tired but to say bring me to this
[1:26:32] battle Lord teach my hands to war for my
[1:26:37] adversary it's like a lion seeking whom
[1:26:40] he may devour people are getting cold
[1:26:43] and falling asleep because they've not
[1:26:44] realized that you're in a vicious

[1:27:00] God's Word they can do anything for me
[1:27:05] for greater is He that's in me but he
[1:27:09] sits in the world
[1:27:11] hallelujah David comes to a place and
[1:27:17] his life is so far gone but you know
[1:27:20] what this man who is losing sleep this
[1:27:24] man who was broken this man who couldn't
[1:27:26] sing God's praises he couldn't lift his
[1:27:29] hands this outward appearance is the
[1:27:38] greatest sign of God's mercy
[1:27:44] you know humanly we look at that and we
[1:27:47] think how could God do that but this was
[1:27:50] the greatest gift of Mercy because God
[1:27:54] said those who I love I rebuke and
[1:28:00] chasten God loved him more God loved him
[1:28:09] so much he wouldn't let him get away
[1:28:14] hallelujah God's hand can reach further
[1:28:19] than your lowest mistake hallelujah he
[1:28:23] can run farther and faster and you can't
[1:28:26] get away from the merciful God you can't
[1:28:29] get away from the loving hand of
[1:28:31] Correction and I'm so thankful for that
[1:28:39] David's life is under the greatest hand
[1:28:42] of judgment but a great hand of mercy
[1:28:45] daddy's hands soft and kind when we done
[1:28:49] right daddy's hands hard as steel when
[1:28:53] we've done wrong listen God's
[1:28:59] tenderizing this man David little does
[1:29:02] anyone know God's tender mercy is upon
[1:29:06] his life and you know what God's
[1:29:07] tenderizing him for correction I didn't
[1:29:13] say yelling and screaming and
[1:29:15] condemnation
[1:29:17] you see correction isn't yelling and
[1:29:19] screaming and condemnation correction is
[1:29:22] to correct
[1:29:24] your way your life starts going this way
[1:29:28] God corrects it and turns it around and
[1:29:32] God's about to send a man and David's
[1:29:35] life a man who loved David a man who
[1:29:39] loved him had great respect for him had
[1:29:41] known him for years he was an employee
[1:29:44] of David's turned to second Samuel
[1:29:48] Chapter 12 quickly if we could don't you
[1:29:54] love God this morning 2nd Samuel 12
[1:29:58] notice this God since a man who loves
[1:30:03] David a man who's watched David for
[1:30:07] years a man who has respect a prophet of
[1:30:10] God a servant of God and God sends this
[1:30:16] man to David Nathan a real servant of
[1:30:22] God a real true vessel of God and no
[1:30:27] doubt when David when God reveals this
[1:30:29] to Nathan and he shows him everything
[1:30:32] that's happened no doubt Nathan's hearts
[1:30:34] broken no doubt he says David hello
[1:30:37] David how could you
[1:30:39] David how could you let your life get so
[1:30:42] out of control David how could you take
[1:30:45] such mercy and such grace that God's had
[1:30:48] owned you how could you allow this to
[1:30:50] happen it's what happens to me friend
[1:30:53] when I read about this man David and I
[1:30:55] say old David if he would have just gone
[1:30:58] to war David if you would have just
[1:31:02] fought for the sake of your family for
[1:31:05] the sake of your children man fight it's
[1:31:09] not a time to lay down it's a time to
[1:31:12] fight
[1:31:14] I hope I inspire you this morning it's
[1:31:18] not a time to lay down it's a time for
[1:31:20] preachers not to compromise it's a time
[1:31:25] to fight for the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:31:27] it's a time to take a strong conviction
[1:31:30] and strong stand in the Word of God
[1:31:34] everyone's caving in under the pressure
[1:31:37] oh that's me you know the message is a
[1:31:39] little bit hard it's a little bit harsh
[1:31:40] and maybe we should change this and edit
[1:31:42] this and change this and don't preach
[1:31:44] that too hard you know we can't preach
[1:31:45] that 2012 now and that was back then in
[1:31:47] the 80s and 90s that was good but you
[1:31:51] know just compromise all we don't need
[1:31:53] to preach so much about that and you
[1:31:54] know about how you live people are
[1:31:56] caving in over the pressure but I'm here
[1:31:58] to tell you this morning I'm here to
[1:32:00] stay at my post of duty I'm here to take
[1:32:02] a sword to saddle a horse and to go to
[1:32:05] war and charge how do you charge in the
[1:32:09] battle you should thank God for a
[1:32:14] ministry that stands and tells you the
[1:32:16] truth those who love you the most will
[1:32:21] tell you the most truth the false
[1:32:27] prophets one who tells you lies tells
[1:32:30] you what you want to hear Nathan no
[1:32:38] doubt shaking as he comes to church that
[1:32:43] mornin
[1:32:44] listen I don't believe for one minute
[1:32:46] that Nathan walked in there and said oh
[1:32:50] if there's my opportunity I got asked to
[1:32:53] preach tonight I'm gonna wear that I'm
[1:32:56] gonna beat him oh I can't wait I can't
[1:33:00] wait I'm gonna make the meanest face dr.
[1:33:03] mink you see a servant of God can have a
[1:33:10] hundred percent truth and 100 percent
[1:33:13] the wrong attitude and it helps nobody
[1:33:18] Oh trust me I'm not saying you don't
[1:33:24] raise your voice I'm not saying there is
[1:33:25] a spiritual indignation there is
[1:33:27] religious indignation and we should say
[1:33:30] it with with with passion we should say
[1:33:32] it with conviction but make sure you say
[1:33:35] it with love love is the only thing that
[1:33:38] God can operate through I don't believe
[1:33:44] he kicked the door down and said come
[1:33:46] here David but I believe a real servant
[1:33:50] of God when he sees the sins of the
[1:33:51] street the Bible says he sighs and crowd
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:56] you believe that church I believe
[1:34:00] Nathan's head was shaken as he turned
[1:34:04] the knob to go to church god help me oh
[1:34:07] lord help me well if I lose my job what
[1:34:11] if he never talks to me he came what if
[1:34:14] he doesn't want anything to do with me
[1:34:15] you see but you must understand
[1:34:17] something Nathan was a servant of God
[1:34:20] before a friend to David hallelujah he
[1:34:26] was faithful to God before he was
[1:34:29] faithful to a man a real servant of God
[1:34:36] cares only for one man's approval the
[1:34:38] man Christ Jesus
[1:34:42] hallelujah you think I wanted to come
[1:34:45] here to Happy Valley to this church and
[1:34:47] preach this out of all the things the
[1:34:51] Word of God can preach listen this word
[1:34:53] is good anything you could preach would
[1:34:55] be good but a real servant stays with
[1:34:58] what God tells him Nathan opens the door
[1:35:06] notice verse 1 of chapter 12 Nathan came
[1:35:10] to pass the God the Lord said Nathan
[1:35:13] unto David and he came unto him and said
[1:35:15] unto him notice this story he tells
[1:35:17] there were two men in one city the one
[1:35:20] rich and the other poor the rich man had
[1:35:22] exceeding many flocks and herds but the
[1:35:25] poor man had nothing notice what's in
[1:35:28] Nathan's mind he picks his story very
[1:35:31] carefully as he thinks of David and
[1:35:33] Bathsheba and Uriah the poor man had
[1:35:36] nothing save one little ewe lamb which
[1:35:39] said but he had bought and nourished up
[1:35:41] and it grew up together with him and
[1:35:45] with his children it did eat of his own
[1:35:47] meat and drank of his own cup and laying
[1:35:50] his bosom and was under him as a
[1:35:52] daughter what picture does Nate does
[1:35:57] Nathan paint David you didn't break up a
[1:36:00] home that was ready to be broke up but
[1:36:04] you took a family that was closely knit
[1:36:06] together and your sinful nature has
[1:36:12] destroyed and broken something so
[1:36:15] precious notice verse 4 and there came a
[1:36:21] traveller into the rich man and he
[1:36:22] spared to take of his own and of
[1:36:25] his own herd to dress for the wayfaring
[1:36:27] man that was come unto Him but took the
[1:36:29] poor man's lamb and dressed it for the
[1:36:32] man that was come to him and notice what
[1:36:34] happens to David as he's hearing this
[1:36:36] story and Davis anger was greatly
[1:36:38] kindled against the man and he said to
[1:36:40] Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that
[1:36:44] has done this thing shall surely die
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:52] it's amazing how fast we pass judgment
[1:36:56] and it's amazing how quick God will make
[1:36:59] you look so stupid is that true it's
[1:37:07] amazing how fast people with small
[1:37:09] children will criticize families with
[1:37:11] teenagers
[1:37:14] trust me I've kept my mouth zipped it's
[1:37:19] amazing how fast we criticize and we
[1:37:22] tear down hey yud amazing what people
[1:37:28] are posted on Facebook like brother
[1:37:29] Bernie Williams says it should be called
[1:37:31] to Facebook hey man
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:39] it's so fast how quickly we criticize
[1:37:43] we've watched a brother and maybe we
[1:37:45] hear about something that he's falling
[1:37:47] into her some sister some teenager how
[1:37:49] could they they ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:37:51] a and born-again pastor needs to preach
[1:37:54] on them it's so amazing to me how
[1:37:56] quickly we forget it I don't know about
[1:38:11] you friend but it took so much Grace and
[1:38:13] so much overlooking and so much
[1:38:16] long-suffering just reach me how could I
[1:38:23] criticize or tear down there's someone
[1:38:28] who's struggling how dare you how dare
[1:38:36] you criticize a person a young person at
[1:38:41] that I watch people say yeah young
[1:38:44] people and if you ask a young person to
[1:38:46] say they this and look at the lifes of
[1:38:47] the people and look at this yet they've
[1:38:48] never not once went to that young person
[1:38:52] to pray for them to encourage them to
[1:38:55] help them but they're the first to run
[1:38:58] their mouth whatsoever it's okay God
[1:39:06] won't be mocked whatsoever you sow you
[1:39:09] shall also reap for jesus said by thy
[1:39:13] words thou are justified or condemned
[1:39:15] and with what judgment you meet it shall
[1:39:19] also be meted unto you is that okay
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:29] amen David so quickly criticizes this
[1:39:36] man shall surely die
[1:39:38] notice this look at your Bible verse 5
[1:39:41] David's anger was greatly kindled he
[1:39:43] said underneath it as the Lord liveth
[1:39:44] the man that has done this thing shall
[1:39:46] surely die and he shall restore the lamb
[1:39:49] now notice David has no clue he's
[1:39:54] passing his own sentence
[1:39:59] he has no idea he's the judge in his own
[1:40:04] driver
[1:40:10] notice verse 6 and he shall restore the
[1:40:16] Lambs for David has no clue but it's
[1:40:29] going to cost him four Lambs he's gonna
[1:40:35] lose Absalom
[1:40:36] he's gonna lose Eamon he's gonna lose a
[1:40:39] donor's eye and Bathsheba's son who paid
[1:40:50] who suffered who bore the consequence of
[1:40:56] a father and mother who decide to stay
[1:41:00] at home who pays
[1:41:11] he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[1:41:17] because he has done this thing and
[1:41:19] because he had no pity Nathan said to
[1:41:21] David I know when you came to church and
[1:41:25] that preacher was preaching you thought
[1:41:27] it was him and him and her and her and
[1:41:29] Oh God had put it on him Lord let him
[1:41:32] hear Lord I know you had on your mind
[1:41:35] that person in that person and I know
[1:41:37] when you thought when he was preaching
[1:41:39] he was talking about this and that and
[1:41:41] human her but no it was sure it was you
[1:41:55] imagine how quickly David's anger
[1:41:58] settles me Lord it's me thou art the man
[1:42:11] thus saith the Lord God of Israel i
[1:42:14] anointed the king over Israel and
[1:42:16] delivered thee out of the hand of Saul
[1:42:18] and I gave thee thy masters house and
[1:42:21] thy masters wives on that bosom and gave
[1:42:23] me the house of Israel and of Judah and
[1:42:25] if that had been too little I would have
[1:42:27] moreover have given unto thee such and
[1:42:28] such things
[1:42:29] wherefore has now despised the
[1:42:32] commandment of the Lord to do evil in a
[1:42:33] site that was killed Uriah the Hittite
[1:42:40] hey wait a minute you mean he wasn't
[1:42:45] even an Israelite but he was actually a
[1:42:50] hittite a nation who God told the
[1:42:54] children of Israel to destroy you see he
[1:43:00] was a proselyte I hope you're hearing me
[1:43:06] this morning
[1:43:07] he wasn't even a part of the bloodline
[1:43:11] but yet God's attitude towards humanity
[1:43:15] it's so amazing how quick our arrogant
[1:43:18] elitist attitude has caused people to
[1:43:21] leave this message we criticize but what
[1:43:26] have you learned is that okay to say we
[1:43:33] judge but what have you learned you know
[1:43:38] people get disgusted because they hear
[1:43:40] so much about I I and how good I am they
[1:43:44] see the elitist attitude that comes in
[1:43:46] the message and the arrogance that we
[1:43:50] look down on other people all they go to
[1:43:53] this church over there and their two
[1:43:54] serpents eat yet God is going to judge
[1:43:58] David's entire house because he killed a
[1:44:02] knight you know what people leave you
[1:44:12] know what they're crying out for more of
[1:44:14] Christ because we've preached so much of
[1:44:19] doctrine without Christ people fail to
[1:44:23] realize the message is not doctrine and
[1:44:26] paints and books and teaching it's a
[1:44:29] person his name is Jesus Christ
[1:44:32] hallelujah
[1:44:36] he said if I be lifted up I'll draw all
[1:44:41] men unto me I want to lift up Christ
[1:44:45] hallelujah a message didn't change you
[1:44:49] books and tapes didn't change you the
[1:44:52] inspiration of Jesus Christ on letter
[1:44:54] form and book form and preaching form
[1:44:57] has transformed my life
[1:45:04] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:45:10] you have killed Uriah the Hittite with
[1:45:16] the sword notice this look in your Bible
[1:45:18] verse 9 and it's taken his wife to be
[1:45:20] thy wife and slaying them with the sword
[1:45:22] of the children of Amon now therefore
[1:45:23] the sword now therefore your bride and
[1:45:26] have a go for it it was wrong David but
[1:45:31] man come on please don't do that again
[1:45:33] just going just know what I'll find out
[1:45:36] is that God's attitude no because that
[1:45:43] was done this the sword shall never
[1:45:44] depart from thine house because that was
[1:45:48] despised me and taken the wife of Uriah
[1:45:50] the Hittite
[1:45:53] notice the emphasis Uriah the Hittite to
[1:45:57] be thy wife thus saith the Lord I will
[1:46:01] raise her people against me out of thine
[1:46:02] own house verse 12 notice our principle
[1:46:05] in verse 12 for thou did it say it again
[1:46:14] for thou did it secretly but private
[1:46:19] failure is going to equal public
[1:46:23] disgrace for thou did it secretly but I
[1:46:28] will do this thing before the whole
[1:46:30] church before all Israel and before the
[1:46:34] son you say that's so horrible now how
[1:46:39] could God a loving God ever do this
[1:46:44] you know how because God gave David a
[1:46:48] chance to repent he gives the woman in
[1:46:52] the harlot in the Book of Revelations I
[1:46:54] gave her a space a space to repent and
[1:46:59] she repented not
[1:47:03] notice friend God gave David a chance he
[1:47:07] gave him a chance to come clean he gave
[1:47:10] him a chance to expose his own self he
[1:47:13] gave him a chance to take his pride and
[1:47:16] lay it down but because David chose not
[1:47:21] to now God is going to humiliate him to
[1:47:27] Humble him David said unto Nathan I have
[1:47:33] sinned against the Lord Nathan said unto
[1:47:34] David the Lord also has put away thy sin
[1:47:37] thou shalt not die howbeit because by
[1:47:40] this deed thou has given great occasion
[1:47:42] to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme
[1:47:43] the child also that is born unto the
[1:47:46] easterly died so does three others his
[1:47:49] children suffers for his own lack of
[1:47:52] discerning the season he was in and
[1:47:56] people today are felling to discern
[1:47:59] they're not just meandering you're not
[1:48:02] just living life but invisibly through
[1:48:06] out eyes that you can maybe can't see
[1:48:08] yours you can't hear there is a war
[1:48:10] that's waging he wants your children he
[1:48:13] wants your mind he wants your home but
[1:48:16] the Bible says when the enemy comes
[1:48:17] rushing in like a flood the family of
[1:48:21] God raises up a wall they raise up a
[1:48:25] standard against you David's life I want
[1:48:30] to close here in just a minute can you
[1:48:32] give me about five or ten more minutes
[1:48:34] turn to Psalms 51 if you could quickly
[1:48:38] close on this here
[1:48:49] Psalms 51 I want you to think for just a
[1:48:53] minute if you were to be a fly on the
[1:48:55] wall and be there in the room that day
[1:48:58] when Nathan comes and confronts and
[1:49:01] exposes David watch David's attitude I'm
[1:49:04] about to show you what is so lacking in
[1:49:07] so many people's lives and what so many
[1:49:10] people have never came to it's real
[1:49:12] simple but it's foreign to us it's
[1:49:14] called repentance people question the
[1:49:19] word and they question the Holy Ghost
[1:49:21] because they come up and get prayed for
[1:49:23] sin or something out of their life only
[1:49:25] to go the next week and the fall and the
[1:49:27] same exact it and they begin to question
[1:49:29] Satan begins to get them to question God
[1:49:32] and His Word and the Holy Spirit listen
[1:49:34] that's not the problem the problem is
[1:49:37] most people have never repented notice
[1:49:42] this in Psalms 51
[1:49:43] this is the prayer David prays notice
[1:49:45] not arrogance he doesn't say how dare
[1:49:48] you expose me in front of all these
[1:49:51] people
[1:49:51] but notice David drops to his knees and
[1:49:54] then watch you're there on the room
[1:49:56] watch what David prays have mercy upon
[1:50:00] me O God according to thy
[1:50:05] loving-kindness according unto the
[1:50:08] multitude of thy tender mercies blot out
[1:50:11] my transgressions wash me thoroughly
[1:50:15] from my iniquity and cleanse me from my
[1:50:17] sin for I acknowledge my transgressions
[1:50:20] and my sin is ever before me against
[1:50:23] thee only have I sinned and done this
[1:50:25] evil in thy sight that thou mightest be
[1:50:27] justified when thou speakest and be
[1:50:29] clear when thou judgest behold I was
[1:50:31] shaped in iniquity and in sin did my
[1:50:34] mother conceive me behold thou desirest
[1:50:38] truth in the inward notice David doesn't
[1:50:49] say for thou desirest a dress code for
[1:50:53] thou desirous long dresses a long hair
[1:50:55] and no makeup no shorts and no smoking
[1:50:59] no drinking that's what you want Lord
[1:51:01] know that
[1:51:01] what God wants those attributes to be
[1:51:07] fueled from something that's happened he
[1:51:13] says fourth Alice
[1:51:15] and in the inward parts that will make
[1:51:20] me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop
[1:51:26] oh I don't have time to go through all
[1:51:27] these words he says purge me with hyssop
[1:51:31] that I may be clean says personally of
[1:51:34] hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and
[1:51:36] I will be whiter than snow make me to
[1:51:38] hear joy and gladness that the bones
[1:51:42] which thou has broken you see the
[1:51:50] greatest gift of mercy God could ever do
[1:51:52] to you is to break you break me yes for
[1:51:57] God to crush you under the hand of his
[1:52:02] mercy David says that I make her joy and
[1:52:07] gladness that the bones which thou has
[1:52:10] broken may rejoice notice this hide thy
[1:52:17] face for my sins and blot out mine
[1:52:19] iniquities create in me a clean heart
[1:52:22] you know what you realize when you read
[1:52:24] this whole Psalm David wasn't saying a
[1:52:26] poem he wasn't reciting the prayer
[1:52:29] listen repentance is not a prayer that
[1:52:31] you pray it's not coming up here that
[1:52:34] may be fine that may be what you need
[1:52:36] but repentance real real repentance is a
[1:52:41] cry of desperation
[1:52:45] and it's a heart that says I'm so sick
[1:52:48] of myself in an age that says men shall
[1:52:54] be lovers of their own self I say I hate
[1:52:57] myself
[1:52:58] wretched man am I who shall deliver me
[1:53:02] from the body but the bondage of this
[1:53:04] dead
[1:53:05] Paul says notice this prayer is not a
[1:53:09] poem it's a prayer and a cry I imagine
[1:53:13] if you were there David wouldn't be
[1:53:15] talking he'd be yelling create in me a
[1:53:20] clean heart Oh God notice the word that
[1:53:26] he chooses create in other words this is
[1:53:30] something I can't do hallelujah he says
[1:53:37] but the hell creator of heavens and
[1:53:39] earth you have to do this David reminds
[1:53:44] God I'm born in sin I'm shaped in
[1:53:46] iniquity so great creator create
[1:53:49] something that's not there create in me
[1:53:56] a clean heart and renew a right spirit
[1:54:03] can you be honest enough to say the
[1:54:07] spirit of head Lord he's not right he
[1:54:13] says renew the right spirit within me
[1:54:15] cast me not away what language is this
[1:54:21] then he uses cast me not away oh
[1:54:23] disconnect yourself from the song in the
[1:54:25] tradition focus on these words cast me
[1:54:28] not away from thy presence David is
[1:54:34] speaking out of fear and terror because
[1:54:38] David told us there's only one thing
[1:54:40] he's ever wanted in his life not money
[1:54:42] not jobs not popularity not fame there's
[1:54:45] only one thing I've asked of you God
[1:54:47] more than anything the deepest part of
[1:54:49] my heart is I want to dwell in the
[1:54:52] presence of God
[1:54:53] and now David realizes the very thing
[1:54:56] he's prayed for could be taken away and
[1:55:02] David's fearful cast me not away from
[1:55:05] that presence you know why because his
[1:55:08] David prays this prayer
[1:55:09] David suddenly awoke and he realizes
[1:55:14] here am i and I'm a king there's so
[1:55:19] there's there's the prophet Nathan a
[1:55:21] king of profit and this prophets coming
[1:55:24] to me for correction and Here I am and I
[1:55:27] remember watching another King and
[1:55:30] another prophet a king named Saul and a
[1:55:36] prophet named Samuel imagined his
[1:55:42] memories going back and he's remembering
[1:55:44] there was God and God sent Samuel time
[1:55:48] and time again was sermon after sermon
[1:55:51] after sermon and then saw sat in his
[1:55:54] seat folded his arms and said I'm sorry
[1:55:58] Lord forgive me Jesus Oh Lord forgive me
[1:56:02] of my sins oh the preacher said raise
[1:56:04] your hand if you want to reach out and
[1:56:05] and confess that this service is bless
[1:56:07] you today does raise your hands there's
[1:56:08] my hands Lord he watched Saul's
[1:56:13] half-hearted half-baked repentance as he
[1:56:22] watched Saul after he'd always say O
[1:56:25] Lord the people all the people me and
[1:56:29] Israel he'd never confess it for himself
[1:56:31] and he watched Saul's half-hearted
[1:56:34] repentance as correction came but change
[1:56:37] never arrived and he watched Saul
[1:56:42] continue and continue and continue in so
[1:56:46] much that finally God says I repent that
[1:56:49] I made this man King and David remembers
[1:56:53] there was so after he thought he could
[1:56:55] get away and now I remember her Saul
[1:56:58] before the Witch of Endor and saw makes
[1:56:59] a confession
[1:57:00] I prayed but the Lord doesn't hear me he
[1:57:03] has departed the Holy Spirit
[1:57:06] has departed and now you know why David
[1:57:09] prayed cast please don't do that to me
[1:57:16] Lord don't take your Holy Spirit David
[1:57:23] begins to realize if God did it to him
[1:57:25] he could do it to me and he says cast me
[1:57:31] not away from my presence take not thy
[1:57:33] Holy Spirit restore unto me the joy of
[1:57:37] restoration the joy of that salvation
[1:57:40] I'm here to tell you where there's real
[1:57:42] repentance there is restoration
[1:57:46] hallelujah where there's of genuine
[1:57:49] turning brother Branham said what do you
[1:57:51] do when you repent you turn around and
[1:57:54] you go the other way he says you go
[1:57:58] towards Calvary David says restore and
[1:58:02] tell me the joy of my salvation and he
[1:58:06] says and uphold me up another words Lord
[1:58:11] I'm falling I'm falling I can't hold
[1:58:16] myself up anymore
[1:58:17] you ever felt like that friend David
[1:58:21] says hold me Lord hold me with thy free
[1:58:24] spirit and he says uphold me then I will
[1:58:28] teach transgressors thy ways and sinners
[1:58:31] will be converted in other words I'm
[1:58:34] gonna take a life of many mistakes I'm
[1:58:37] gonna take a life of many failures and
[1:58:40] I'm not gonna glorify Satan I'm not
[1:58:42] gonna give him glory I'm not gonna stay
[1:58:44] down and stay depressed because of my
[1:58:46] deceit because of my pain of my failure
[1:58:49] but I'm gonna turn a failure into a
[1:58:52] great testimony hallelujah and sinners
[1:58:55] will repent because of you who because
[1:58:58] of the power of God
[1:59:01] hallelujah sinners will be converted
[1:59:06] because they seem God could take a man
[1:59:09] that made such mistakes but could still
[1:59:13] receive mercy this God is unfathomable
[1:59:20] is unsearchable Lord deliver me from
[1:59:29] blood-guiltiness O God thou God of my
[1:59:32] salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud
[1:59:34] of thy righteousness o Lord open thou my
[1:59:37] lips and my mouth shall show forth thy
[1:59:40] praise for thou desirous not sacrifice
[1:59:44] or I would have given it they'll delight
[1:59:47] us not in burnt offerings the sacrifices
[1:59:49] of God are not prayers and pretty
[1:59:54] prayers and oh I'm so sorry
[1:59:56] I know forgive me but the sacrifices of
[1:59:59] God are a broken spirit a contrite heart
[2:00:06] O God thou will not despise me let's
[2:00:11] stand to our feet this morning musicians
[2:00:20] can return this morning
[2:00:27] David finds what I fear so many people
[2:00:32] have never found David finds repentance
[2:00:39] brother branham says this such a
[2:00:43] wonderful quote he says David after he
[2:00:45] had taken your eye his wife the hittite
[2:00:47] the lovely Bathsheba was going to be the
[2:00:49] father of her child caused her gallant
[2:00:51] husband to be killed in battle but when
[2:00:53] the prophet Nathan come in and revealed
[2:00:54] his sins to him then David thought on
[2:00:56] his ways and he turned himself turned
[2:01:00] himself to repentance in sackcloth and
[2:01:04] ashes that's the way to turn God will
[2:01:09] God hurt him God will always hear a man
[2:01:11] a woman that'll turn their feet to his
[2:01:13] testimony it's amazing to me the prophet
[2:01:16] of God tells a lie and he goes to pray
[2:01:19] for someone and the Lord convicts him
[2:01:21] and says make that right just a little
[2:01:23] lie something so small prophet of God
[2:01:26] goes and makes it right you see most of
[2:01:28] us will do what he did
[2:01:29] we'll go and make it right but read the
[2:01:31] rest of the story brother Branham said
[2:01:34] after that I went to greens mill to my
[2:01:37] cave and fasted and pray for days you
[2:01:43] know why he was repenting you said
[2:01:48] brother Matt does that mean we need to
[2:01:49] do something great and oh my just feel
[2:01:51] all sad and again now turmoil for three
[2:01:53] weeks no that's not what I'm saying I'm
[2:01:55] simply saying this make sure your
[2:01:56] repentance is not a prayer but it's a
[2:02:00] turning it's a turning of self by your
[2:02:06] heads with me this morning play
[2:02:09] something for me brothers Jesus comes to
[2:02:12] a man and I'd like to tell you this
[2:02:14] story he comes to a man in the Bible at
[2:02:18] the Pool of Bethesda and Jesus comes to
[2:02:23] this man a man who had been there for
[2:02:26] thirty plus years he had came to this
[2:02:30] church with the same disease you want to
[2:02:34] know what put him there in that Matt on
[2:02:36] his Li on his back
[2:02:39] it wasn't unfortunate circumstances but
[2:02:41] the Bible tells us sin in his life had
[2:02:45] put him there
[2:02:46] for 30 years he laid on his bed and
[2:02:52] Jesus comes to him and says sir will
[2:02:57] thou be made whole every head bowed
[2:03:05] please every eye closed will thou be
[2:03:08] made whole man begins to tell us stories
[2:03:11] oh I've been here and every time an
[2:03:15] angel comes and stirs the waters I have
[2:03:17] no man to lift me to put me in the water
[2:03:19] oh I've been coming to this church for
[2:03:21] years and I've prayed and prayed and
[2:03:23] prayed and prayed and prayed it's not
[2:03:25] ever gonna hear my prayer it's not ever
[2:03:28] gonna hear me you notice God does not
[2:03:30] ask questions for nothing
[2:03:32] this man has been in this crippled state
[2:03:35] and Jesus asks him a question this is
[2:03:38] what he asked do you want to be made
[2:03:41] whole now of course the man could say of
[2:03:45] course what do you think you think I
[2:03:49] like being in this condition you think
[2:03:51] it pleases me to be on this floor on the
[2:03:53] hard concrete but Jesus ain't asking a
[2:03:57] senseless question
[2:04:00] you see Jesus doesn't care about the
[2:04:08] pain that sin has caused this man he
[2:04:14] doesn't care and he's not interested and
[2:04:16] all the hurt and all the wreckage and
[2:04:20] all the chaos that this man's sin we
[2:04:23] don't know what it was maybe alcohol
[2:04:24] pornography drugs adultery we don't know
[2:04:29] what it was you see most people cannot
[2:04:35] stand the pain that their sin causes
[2:04:39] them and they get sorrowful because of
[2:04:43] all the pain and they say all these
[2:04:46] drugs wrecked my home the alcohol messes
[2:04:48] me up
[2:04:51] all these pain from all the sin and most
[2:04:54] people have sorrow for the result of
[2:04:56] their sin and they think because they're
[2:04:58] sorrowful over the pain that somehow
[2:05:01] when they ask God to cleanse them that
[2:05:06] they've repented but you see God's not
[2:05:08] interested in the pain that it's causing
[2:05:10] you that's not why he transforms you God
[2:05:15] doesn't want to know do you hate the
[2:05:17] pain that sin causes God wants to know
[2:05:20] do you hate the sin because you live in
[2:05:25] an age that the Bible says men will be
[2:05:28] lovers of their own self they will want
[2:05:32] to please themselves and their own
[2:05:34] passions that want to please their own
[2:05:37] desires and so much that they'll pay any
[2:05:40] price to please number one and Jesus is
[2:05:45] asking you a question here this morning
[2:05:47] will you be made I want to ask you with
[2:05:56] every head bowed every eye closed as
[2:06:00] Jesus is here this morning we've
[2:06:03] preached a sermon about David so much
[2:06:06] more we could have said but we look at a
[2:06:09] man's life who made such a bad choice
[2:06:12] and cost him so much so much that I
[2:06:16] can't even say some of the things that
[2:06:18] happen he eventually gets kicked out of
[2:06:20] his own Kingdom rejected he's kicked out
[2:06:23] but David that's not that that's not the
[2:06:27] end of the story hallelujah David finds
[2:06:31] the place of real repentance real
[2:06:34] sorrowful Ness real sackcloth and ashes
[2:06:37] you know why they put sackcloth on it
[2:06:40] was made of goat's hair it hurt they
[2:06:42] would wear it for days and it would itch
[2:06:44] their body then they would take ashes
[2:06:46] and pour it all over their body you know
[2:06:48] why asked his represented total death of
[2:06:51] no resurrection and no return and that's
[2:06:55] what we need this morning we need to die
[2:06:57] so much to ourselves
[2:06:59] but we say Oh God don't never let me
[2:07:02] return and resurrect the old man but the
[2:07:06] Bible says he who walks after the spirit
[2:07:08] lives not after the things of the flesh
