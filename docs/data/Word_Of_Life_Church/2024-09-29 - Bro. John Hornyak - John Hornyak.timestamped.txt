[44:37] opportunity just help us to submit to
[44:40] you father we love you we thank you in
[44:43] Jesus name
[44:46] amen
[44:48] amen Matthew 19
[44:52] 16 starting with verse
[44:55] 16 says
[44:57] and behold one came and said unto him
[45:00] good
[45:01] Master what good things shall I do that
[45:04] I may have eternal life and he said unto
[45:08] him why callest thou me good there is
[45:11] none good but one that is God but if
[45:15] that will enter into a life keep
[45:17] Commandments there's the Baseline right
[45:21] that's where we got to start we got to
[45:22] keep the Commandments that's the
[45:24] Baseline
[45:27] I don't know it's
[45:29] whistling he said unto him which Jesus
[45:33] said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt
[45:35] not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal
[45:38] Thou shalt not bear F false witness
[45:40] honor thy father and thy mother Thou
[45:42] shalt love thy neighbor as theirself and
[45:45] the young man said unto him all these
[45:47] things have I kept from my youth
[45:51] up what lack I yet may the Lord add His
[45:55] blessings to the word may you be
[46:00] seated I'm going lose this
[46:03] quick
[46:10] maybe so we're looking at the Rich Young
[46:14] Ruler and I know this is very familiar
[46:16] but so here's a young man that comes up
[46:20] and we know that we've been taught that
[46:22] that he was raised in quote unquote the
[46:24] message he was taught the truth he kept
[46:26] the command Commandments he knew the the
[46:29] Baseline right you know he he knew all
[46:32] these things and
[46:36] yet he knew there was something
[46:38] missing right he said what lack I how do
[46:42] I gain eternal life I've kept all the
[46:45] Commandments but there's a hole there's
[46:47] something missing there's something
[46:49] that's not right
[46:50] there
[46:53] H sounds like a bunch of message keid
[46:57] kids grew up in the
[47:00] message
[47:01] know quotes know the Bible know how to
[47:07] live they've sat on these pews and heard
[47:10] sermon after sermon and not just a
[47:12] sermon there's a lot of people that hear
[47:15] sermon but they heard the anointed word
[47:17] the truth of the
[47:19] hour we've got one of the finest uh uh
[47:22] pastors if not the finest he is in my
[47:24] opinion that that stands behind this
[47:26] pulpit and we hear these things over and
[47:29] over again and it's not some dead letter
[47:31] it's something living yes we're seeing
[47:34] something take place we're seeing all
[47:36] these things and and the Miracles are
[47:38] being performed we see healings we see
[47:40] all these things happening right before
[47:43] us and we're we're educated and we know
[47:45] that but yet there's some out
[47:47] there that know the Baseline but they
[47:51] know that there's something
[47:54] lacking they know that there's a void
[47:58] somewhere where am I Lord I I I love you
[48:02] and I believe they love how could you
[48:04] not love a God that we serve how could
[48:06] you not love a God that we see perform
[48:08] Miracle after
[48:09] Miracle see how he's working in our
[48:12] lives how could you not love him yes sir
[48:15] yeah but what lackest
[48:19] thy now here comes the hard
[48:22] Choice here comes the thing that that he
[48:25] loved the most
[48:27] M come
[48:29] on Jesus approaches him with the thing
[48:32] that he loved the
[48:38] most Jesus said unto him if thou Wilt be
[48:43] perfect go and sell all that thou Hast
[48:47] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[48:48] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[48:54] me so this young man was at a cross
[48:56] Cross Roads yeah he could go on living a
[49:00] good life I know a lot of people that
[49:02] live good
[49:04] lives I know a lot of of of of message
[49:08] kids that grew up in the
[49:11] message and they're doing just fine but
[49:14] they're not in the message they're good
[49:16] good
[49:17] people even hold a lot of the standards
[49:20] you you hear of of of of people from
[49:23] outside dating these these people or or
[49:25] getting to know these
[49:27] these uh people that grew up in the
[49:30] message and they can tell there's a
[49:32] difference they have they still have
[49:34] that standard you know what I'm saying
[49:36] they might slip here and there and and
[49:38] and might not be serving the lord the
[49:39] way they're supposed to be and all those
[49:41] things that we've been taught and raised
[49:43] in and all those things but they still
[49:45] have something in the background there's
[49:46] something back there that they you've
[49:48] instilled raise up the child in the way
[49:50] that it should go and so they're holding
[49:53] on to part of it yeah
[49:57] right they've got some of
[49:59] it and there's a difference in in in a
[50:02] kid that's been uh a young person that's
[50:05] been raised up in this
[50:08] message and those that have just kind
[50:12] of it seems
[50:15] like they go crazy they go a little wild
[50:19] but there's always a
[50:21] tie right there's always something there
[50:25] when they get in trouble they know who
[50:26] to call
[50:27] right you understand what I'm
[50:32] saying but when this young man heard
[50:35] that saying he went away sorrowful for
[50:38] he had great
[50:40] possessions it might not be
[50:43] money for some of our
[50:45] youth or some of
[50:48] you and that not might not be the
[50:50] problem this was the Rich Young
[50:52] Ruler maybe this was the the pretty
[50:56] young
[50:57] girl she had the looks she was pretty
[51:00] she liked that attention do you
[51:03] understand what I'm saying maybe that
[51:05] was her wealth maybe maybe the the the
[51:09] Mr athlete or or Mr popular whatever it
[51:12] might be what are you selling yourself
[51:14] out
[51:15] for you're at a Crossroads you're in a
[51:18] circumstance where God has given you
[51:23] something we all have something that God
[51:27] has given
[51:30] us and sometimes he wants us to use it
[51:34] for him for him
[51:37] yeah sometimes he wants us to give it up
[51:40] for him
[51:42] yes and this young man was at a
[51:45] Crossroads he says I've got all the
[51:47] teaching I've got all the knowledge I
[51:49] know exactly the way I'm supposed to
[51:51] live
[51:56] God says but for
[51:58] you for
[52:02] you I want you to give up all your
[52:06] wealth and come follow me yes
[52:11] Lord had a Crossroads is at a place he
[52:14] was facing a
[52:18] circumstance that he didn't know what to
[52:20] do
[52:20] with we're all going to come into that
[52:24] place be it a talent or or whatever it
[52:27] might be on
[52:29] how you're going to serve God he puts us
[52:32] in circumstances to see how we trust him
[52:37] amen he puts us right in the middle of
[52:40] everything this this young man said good
[52:45] Master he knew that Jesus was was
[52:48] somebody of of
[52:51] note amen he was willing to approach him
[52:55] and and and and and say I need to know
[52:58] more of
[52:59] you tell me about it good
[53:05] master I imagine this Rich Young Ruler
[53:07] was probably hoping that Jesus would say
[53:10] hey you got a few hundred
[53:16] bucks could you donate to the cause and
[53:19] that guy would walk away happy with
[53:22] chest puffed
[53:23] out yeah I helped
[53:28] Jesus I supported the
[53:40] ministry brother Brown
[53:43] says and come follow me he says what an
[53:47] opportunity that could have been Peter
[53:50] James or John one of them see the kid
[53:53] had been trained and brought
[53:55] upright and and been presented to Christ
[53:58] to use him in all the potentials that he
[54:01] had in him he'd been presented to Christ
[54:04] and all the potentials that he had in
[54:07] him he was at a Crossroads he was set up
[54:10] with the right kind of circumstances to
[54:12] be something like Peter and James and
[54:15] John yeah we know him as a Rich Young
[54:19] Ruler but what's his
[54:23] name think about
[54:25] that
[54:33] H to youed probably educated Young Rich
[54:37] influenced where he could have presented
[54:40] the gospel and yet turned it down what a
[54:44] rash thing that was for that young boy
[54:48] see follow me now see he had to follow
[54:51] someone now he had to either follow the
[54:53] influence of the people that he was
[54:55] associated with
[54:56] the influence of some young lady some
[54:59] influence of a gang of boys that he was
[55:01] associated with his colleagues in school
[55:04] or follow Jesus
[55:06] Christ in all of his
[55:08] goodness yet he knew he didn't have
[55:12] eternal
[55:15] life now look at that boy tonight what
[55:19] he could have been and what he is and
[55:23] what he is tonight he's somewhere he's a
[55:26] man he's somewhere he's waiting for
[55:29] waiting the Judgment he's waiting to
[55:30] face that Judgment Day Day turning down
[55:34] the same opportunity is presented to you

[1:01:03] Genesis chapter
[1:01:08] 22
[1:01:16] circumstance sorry verse
[1:01:21] four this is kind of a lengthy scripture
[1:01:25] but I think it's
[1:01:28] says then on the third day Abram lifted
[1:01:30] Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:01:32] place far off and Abram Abraham said
[1:01:36] unto his young men abide here with the
[1:01:39] ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and
[1:01:43] worship and come again to you
[1:01:47] so God has spoke to Abraham and he told
[1:01:50] him take Isaac go sacrifice
[1:01:54] him something that you waited for for 25
[1:01:59] years after you were already an old
[1:02:03] man and your wife was too
[1:02:08] yes God likes to put
[1:02:12] us in
[1:02:16] circumstances did you ever sat down and
[1:02:19] thought God what are you
[1:02:23] doing what are you doing
[1:02:33] amen what are you doing I'm going to say
[1:02:36] it again I i' I've asked him so many
[1:02:38] times why am I in this
[1:02:43] spot why is this where I'm
[1:02:48] at what do you mean you want me to do
[1:02:53] this what are you doing
[1:02:58] every time I get called to preach what
[1:02:59] are you
[1:03:05] doing
[1:03:07] why come
[1:03:09] on he put you in the
[1:03:13] circumstances that's
[1:03:18] true and he
[1:03:21] says just do it
[1:03:24] yeah yeah
[1:03:29] what ah you're joshing me you got to be
[1:03:33] kidding just do
[1:03:37] it

[1:03:44] years plus the 75 before that to have
[1:03:48] this child wow to have this
[1:03:52] promise to be where I'm at yeah
[1:03:59] my wife
[1:04:03] laughed at
[1:04:09] God circumstance yeah Abraham wasn't
[1:04:13] doing anything
[1:04:15] wrong that's right he was living
[1:04:18] according to what God wanted him to do
[1:04:21] yes sir
[1:04:28] and God throws him in this
[1:04:34] circumstance brothers and sisters it's
[1:04:36] not
[1:04:37] wrong to ask why
[1:04:41] sometimes it's just wrong when you say
[1:04:44] why no that's when it's
[1:04:51] wrong it's okay to as long as you do it
[1:04:54] the right spirit the right attitude
[1:04:56] there's nothing wrong with
[1:05:00] it I believe brother brand uh when that
[1:05:04] that sister was I can't remember I think
[1:05:07] she
[1:05:10] drowned and got uh brother brand told
[1:05:13] God you owe me an
[1:05:15] explanation and after all that God
[1:05:18] said I would have told you if you would
[1:05:20] have asked right yeah right yeah it's
[1:05:24] all about our attitude
[1:05:26] we're human he knows we're human he's
[1:05:29] fully aware that we are human in case
[1:05:31] you don't know God knows that you are
[1:05:35] human and you're going to make mistakes
[1:05:37] and you're going to say some stupid
[1:05:40] stuff and you're going to do some stupid
[1:05:46] stuff we could go down a whole list of
[1:05:49] of stupid that we do
[1:05:56] Abraham was doing what he was supposed
[1:05:57] to do yes he's raising his son yes God
[1:06:02] said I want you to go sacrifice
[1:06:06] him
[1:06:11] God you're sure about this yeah yeah
[1:06:17] yeah I'm
[1:06:18] sure
[1:06:20] now mature Christians for the most part
[1:06:24] not all the time
[1:06:28] people that have been down the road a
[1:06:29] little bit with God know when he tells
[1:06:32] you to do
[1:06:33] something it's best you go ahead and do
[1:06:35] it
[1:06:39] yes Abraham was
[1:06:42] mature the problem is when we're
[1:06:44] spiritually
[1:06:48] immature that's when we get in trouble
[1:06:50] yeah it's the TR amen and the reason we
[1:06:54] get to become
[1:06:56] mature Christians is because we were
[1:06:58] immature at some
[1:07:00] time and we had to learn a hard way
[1:07:03] through the circumstances that we were
[1:07:05] put in hard way right so take it from
[1:07:09] some people who
[1:07:12] know just go ahead and listen it's a
[1:07:16] whole lot
[1:07:16] easier just go ahead and do what God's
[1:07:19] telling
[1:07:20] you now Lord I'm not setting myself up
[1:07:22] for anything I'm just letting you know
[1:07:25] I'm not saying I'm super
[1:07:32] mature so verse 5 it says abide here but
[1:07:35] the the ass and I and the lad will go Y
[1:07:37] and worship and come again to you he
[1:07:40] didn't know how it was going to happen
[1:07:41] he didn't know how the plan was going to
[1:07:43] come together he knew the
[1:07:45] promise right he knew the promise that's
[1:07:48] the key is knowing the promise if you
[1:07:51] don't know the promise if you have no uh
[1:07:54] idea how God works works or what he does
[1:07:56] or what he's promised that's why it's
[1:07:58] important to read your Bible yes sir and
[1:08:01] to listen to messages and listen to
[1:08:03] tapes that's why it's important because
[1:08:05] you got to know what the promise
[1:08:08] is because the promise is the ultimate
[1:08:10] end
[1:08:11] result amen not the circumstance the
[1:08:17] promise Abraham knew that he had a
[1:08:21] promise so he was able to say me and the
[1:08:24] lad are coming back back even though he
[1:08:26] had a knife in his
[1:08:30] pocket right if you're aware of what the
[1:08:33] promise is it's a whole lot easier to
[1:08:35] face the circumstance head on Amen and
[1:08:39] do exactly what God says cuz you know
[1:08:41] what the promise is brothers and sisters
[1:08:43] if you wake up in the morning and you're
[1:08:45] scared to
[1:08:47] death of what the day is going to bring
[1:08:51] yeah amen of what your circumstances are
[1:08:55] yeah
[1:08:56] of what your uh bank account
[1:08:59] is of what your health
[1:09:06] is you're not
[1:09:10] aware of the promise promise
[1:09:14] yes let me say that again CU I don't
[1:09:16] think you understood what I
[1:09:19] said if you're scared to death to wake
[1:09:22] up in the morning and face your
[1:09:24] circumstance
[1:09:27] yeah on you're not aware of what the
[1:09:31] promise is
[1:09:39] amen well brother John you don't know
[1:09:41] what I'm going through you don't know
[1:09:44] this no I I don't I don't know what
[1:09:47] you're going
[1:09:48] through but I am fully aware of what the
[1:09:50] promise is that's
[1:09:53] right now maybe it's
[1:09:56] you know what the promise is but you
[1:09:57] don't know who you
[1:10:04] are and that's a whole another ball of
[1:10:08] wax that's a whole another problem if
[1:10:11] you don't know who you are we got to
[1:10:13] start
[1:10:17] there Abraham knew who he was he was the
[1:10:21] father of many
[1:10:24] nations amen
[1:10:26] and it was okay when God said Abraham
[1:10:29] take your son up there
[1:10:31] and sacrifice
[1:10:33] him
[1:10:36] H that sounds psychotic honestly that's
[1:10:40] I mean
[1:10:43] really that's
[1:10:46] crazy go ahead and start spreading the
[1:10:49] rumor that you're going to take your son
[1:10:51] on a mountain and kill him see how far
[1:10:54] you get
[1:10:56] that's crazy that's not right
[1:11:00] yes that circumstances is out of the
[1:11:03] realm of our
[1:11:05] thinking
[1:11:15] yes and Isaac spoke unto Abraham his
[1:11:17] father verse 7 and said my
[1:11:20] father and he said here am I my son and
[1:11:24] he and he said behold the fire and the
[1:11:26] wood but where's the lamb for a burnt
[1:11:30] offering that's how you know Abraham was
[1:11:32] living
[1:11:34] R his son was aware of what was supposed
[1:11:38] to
[1:11:44] happen if your
[1:11:47] children don't know how to
[1:11:53] pray they're not aware
[1:12:01] yeah I'm just going
[1:12:06] to just just chew on that a little
[1:12:09] bit our children should
[1:12:12] know how we live right amen there
[1:12:16] shouldn't be
[1:12:18] questions on the basic things how do we
[1:12:22] dress
[1:12:26] is this apparel appropriate I need to
[1:12:29] stop that's not my it's not my job but
[1:12:32] we need do you understand what I'm
[1:12:34] saying Isaac knew how to he he was aware
[1:12:37] of of the whole process the whole thing
[1:12:51] yeah and they came to the pl place which
[1:12:54] God had told him of and Abraham built an
[1:12:58] altar there and he laid the wood in
[1:13:01] order and bound Isaac his son and laid
[1:13:04] him on the altar upon the
[1:13:06] wood now I want you to think about
[1:13:10] this Abraham
[1:13:14] is 100 years old thereabouts I didn't do
[1:13:17] the math I think uh Isaac was 13 and so
[1:13:22] you can do the math but he's an old man
[1:13:27] Isaac is a young
[1:13:32] man this is more confirmation that
[1:13:36] Isaac was raised
[1:13:41] right cuz I guarantee
[1:13:44] you if I tried to tie up my
[1:13:48] 13-year-old he's not a good example he's
[1:13:51] big uh but even still
[1:13:56] there ain't no way I can hold him down
[1:13:58] I'm
[1:13:59] sorry and and I'm not 50 years old
[1:14:05] yet but Isaac was submitted to his
[1:14:07] father yeah and Isaac
[1:14:11] understood that Abraham had faith in
[1:14:14] what God was doing
[1:14:19] yes cuz there ain't no 13-year-old boy
[1:14:22] that's just going to lay there and let
[1:14:23] him get tied up seeing a knife in his
[1:14:27] daddy's
[1:14:28] belt do you understand what I'm
[1:14:33] saying so this is the importance of of
[1:14:36] of showing not only being
[1:14:40] religious but living the life in front
[1:14:43] of our
[1:14:46] children God had a vision for what this
[1:14:49] was supposed to be
[1:14:56] and Isaac was a part of
[1:14:59] that he was in the scary side of
[1:15:04] it but yet there's this boy laying down
[1:15:08] allowing his daddy to tie him up and put
[1:15:10] him on the altar knowing what the altar
[1:15:12] was
[1:15:16] for Isaac showed so much Faith or
[1:15:19] Abraham showed so much faith in front of
[1:15:22] Isaac and brought him up and said God's
[1:15:25] going to do this God's got this he's
[1:15:27] going to take care of this over and over
[1:15:30] and over again that's all Isaac saw from
[1:15:32] Abraham was Faith yes he'd sit down and
[1:15:36] tell him say Isaac you know your mother
[1:15:39] and
[1:15:40] I were well past bearing a
[1:15:45] child in fact
[1:15:47] your half
[1:15:49] brother was your mother's idea cuz she
[1:15:52] didn't think she could do it but God God
[1:15:55] is faithful and true amen he is he every
[1:16:03] time he
[1:16:05] promises he comes through that's true
[1:16:08] yes sir sometimes it takes a
[1:16:12] while 25 years Isaac but he's faithful
[1:16:17] and
[1:16:18] true Isaac got so sick of hearing
[1:16:22] that but yet when it come time to
[1:16:27] test when it come to
[1:16:30] circumstances Isaac fell right in place
[1:16:36] why cuz he was taught he was
[1:16:40] showed it wasn't just we're going to
[1:16:42] church sit down and shut
[1:16:45] up daddy gets to church and he's
[1:16:48] worshiping there then he gets home and
[1:16:50] he's a totally different person no it
[1:16:53] was a life lived
[1:17:09] in Abraham verse 10 and Abram Abraham
[1:17:12] stretched forth his hand and took the
[1:17:14] knife to slay his son and the angel of
[1:17:16] the Lord called unto him out of heaven
[1:17:17] and said Abraham Abraham and he said
[1:17:19] here am I and he said lay not thine hand
[1:17:22] upon thy lad neither
[1:17:25] do thou anything unto
[1:17:28] him for now I know that thou fearest God
[1:17:33] seeing now I know that there fears God
[1:17:37] Abraham was doing everything right he
[1:17:40] was living his life right God had to put
[1:17:43] him in a
[1:17:45] circumstance he knew how Abraham would
[1:17:48] come out on the other side he's
[1:17:53] God do you think that was for
[1:17:56] God or for
[1:18:01] Abraham so we have an all knowing god
[1:18:04] and we're facing all kinds of
[1:18:06] circumstances yes and we're put in those
[1:18:11] positions is that for
[1:18:13] God or is that for
[1:18:18] us think about that God already knows Jo
[1:18:23] God wasn't like
[1:18:25] I don't know how Abraham's going to turn
[1:18:27] out boy I hope he gets through this one
[1:18:30] there's a lot of work getting that guy
[1:18:32] going God wasn't ringing his
[1:18:35] hands he knew exactly what how Abraham
[1:18:37] would respond but Abraham had to know
[1:18:40] how he would respond brothers and
[1:18:42] sisters when we're faced with
[1:18:45] circumstances God that's more
[1:18:48] confirmation for
[1:18:50] you where you are and who you are that's
[1:18:54] your confirmation
[1:18:55] why because we need those things we need
[1:18:57] to stockpile those things because we
[1:19:01] have to have faith to take a Rapture
[1:19:03] that's right we have to have faith when
[1:19:05] we're sick when it's really a dire
[1:19:07] situation so circumstance after
[1:19:10] circumstance is building up our faith
[1:19:12] building up our understanding of what
[1:19:14] God can do and how he wants to do it in
[1:19:17] us through us and who we are to
[1:19:22] him yes sir
[1:19:32] we often ask the question God why are
[1:19:34] you doing this to
[1:19:37] me the answer is for
[1:19:43] you God would you quit doing so much for
[1:19:46] me we all feel that way sometimes but
[1:19:49] he's doing that for
[1:19:51] us he's getting us Rapture Ready it's
[1:19:54] going to take Faith to get out of here
[1:19:58] yes that's why uh the scripture says
[1:20:02] that count it all
[1:20:05] joy yes count it all joy
[1:20:11] boy that's
[1:20:14] rough God you put me in this
[1:20:16] circumstance that I don't know what to
[1:20:18] do or how to do it count it all joy
[1:20:22] right rest right
[1:20:27] rest
[1:20:42] amen let's let's jump down
[1:20:46] and uh verse
[1:20:49] 13 and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[1:20:52] looked and behold behind him a Ram
[1:20:54] caught in the thicket by his horns and
[1:20:56] Abraham went and took the RAM and
[1:20:58] offered him up for an burnt offering in
[1:21:00] the stead of the sun God's going to
[1:21:05] provide and Abraham called the the name
[1:21:08] of that place Jehovah Gyra that is to
[1:21:11] say to this day in the Mount of of the
[1:21:15] Lord it shall be
[1:21:16] seen Jehovah
[1:21:20] Gyra my
[1:21:22] provider my provider
[1:21:25] the Lord in the midst of my
[1:21:27] circumstances when I am
[1:21:31] overwhelmed with what God is asking me
[1:21:33] to do what God is asking me to go
[1:21:36] through yes
[1:21:38] sir he's provided a lamb
[1:21:42] amen he's provided a lamb in the middle
[1:21:46] of it
[1:21:47] all Jehovah Gyra
[1:21:57] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:21:58] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[1:22:01] and

[1:23:21] obedient that's bride material thank you

[1:25:55] that you're predestinated
[1:25:59] amen you've got to know not God God does
[1:26:03] know you're predestinated but you're the

[1:26:20] circumstances and see if we obey he
[1:26:23] wants obedience
[1:26:34] in Abraham in 55 it
[1:26:38] says and about that time he heard
[1:26:40] something bleed and there was a little
[1:26:42] Ram hooked in the wilderness by his
[1:26:44] horns where did that Ram come from it
[1:26:47] was 100 miles from civilization and they
[1:26:50] was on up on top of the mountain and
[1:26:52] there was no water how did the ram get
[1:26:54] there God is still Jehovah Gyra no
[1:26:58] matter what the circumstance is he can
[1:27:02] provide the sacrifice at any time amen
[1:27:05] no matter what the circumstance is he is
[1:27:09] Jehovah Gyra amen no matter what the
[1:27:13] circumstance is no matter where you find
[1:27:17] yourself no matter what corner you get
[1:27:19] yourself backed into
[1:27:22] amen he's Jehovah Gyra
[1:27:25] [Music]
[1:27:26] amen Abraham was obedient and he found
[1:27:30] himself in some crazy
[1:27:32] circumstances yes sir just doing the
[1:27:35] what he's supposed to do that's where
[1:27:37] most of us live we we we live the best
[1:27:40] we can we're doing the best we can we
[1:27:42] might make mistakes but but overall I'm
[1:27:44] sure Abraham didn't wake up in a good
[1:27:46] mood every
[1:27:51] day but he was doing the best he could
[1:27:53] and and serving the lord the best he
[1:27:58] could God called on him to do something
[1:28:00] out of the ordinary presented him with a
[1:28:03] set of
[1:28:04] circumstances
[1:28:06] amen and he had to face him he had to be
[1:28:10] obedient true that's
[1:28:16] right let's turn to numbers
[1:28:24] actually let's go to Jonah I don't think
[1:28:26] I'm G to have
[1:28:28] time let's go to Jonah this
[1:28:31] is I love this little
[1:28:34] book I see myself in it so much I hate
[1:28:38] to say
[1:28:44] that there's things I don't want to
[1:28:48] do there's things I don't want to
[1:28:51] face now I've learned but this
[1:28:56] Jonah chapter 1 and we're going to read
[1:28:58] a lot of this because it
[1:29:01] it's really sets
[1:29:04] up now the word of the Lord came unto
[1:29:06] Jonah the son of
[1:29:08] amii saying arise and go to Nineveh that
[1:29:11] great City and cry against it for their
[1:29:13] wickedness has come up before me but
[1:29:15] Jonah rose up to flee to tarus from the
[1:29:18] presence of the Lord and went down to
[1:29:19] japa and he found a ship going to Tarsus
[1:29:22] so that he paid the fair thereof so
[1:29:24] here's we know all know the story but
[1:29:26] I'm going to go over it because that's
[1:29:28] the way I feel like I should
[1:29:30] go Jonah is
[1:29:34] paying to get into a
[1:29:40] circumstance he's paying for it come out
[1:29:43] of his own
[1:29:45] wallet he's paying for
[1:29:49] that I know nobody else has been through
[1:29:51] that
[1:29:54] but
[1:29:58] me he paid the fair thereof and went
[1:30:01] down into
[1:30:02] it to go with him to tares from the
[1:30:05] presence of the Lord now he's
[1:30:07] running he's running from the presence
[1:30:10] of the
[1:30:11] Lord this is the opposite of
[1:30:14] Abraham this is disobedience
[1:30:25] but the Lord sent out a great wind into
[1:30:27] the sea and there was a great Mighty
[1:30:29] Tempest in the sea so that the ship was
[1:30:31] like to be
[1:30:32] broken then the Mariners were afraid and
[1:30:34] cried every man unto his God and cast
[1:30:38] forth the Wares that were in the ship
[1:30:41] into the sea to lighten it of
[1:30:44] them so these are Mariners they're
[1:30:47] praying they religious people we run
[1:30:49] into those in the South I don't know
[1:30:52] there's a lot of religious people
[1:30:56] people and I
[1:31:00] hate there's going to be a whole lot
[1:31:02] more religious people after this
[1:31:04] flooding that we've had do you
[1:31:06] understand what I'm
[1:31:08] saying I mean I'm not disparaging
[1:31:10] anybody but everybody gets religious
[1:31:12] when catastrophe happens and it's a I'm
[1:31:15] not downplaying the catastrophe I don't
[1:31:17] don't think I'm doing
[1:31:18] that but everybody goes to seeking after
[1:31:22] God sure when catastrophe happened bad
[1:31:25] things happen which is not a bad thing
[1:31:26] to do I'm not saying it's a bad thing
[1:31:28] that they
[1:31:32] shouldn't but they start pitching their
[1:31:35] Wars God why' this come upon me is it
[1:31:38] because I had a drug
[1:31:40] problem well I'm going to quit drinking
[1:31:42] I'm going to quit you know what I'm
[1:31:45] saying is that fair
[1:31:54] but Jonah was gone down into the sides
[1:31:57] of the ship and he laid he lay and was
[1:32:00] fast
[1:32:02] asleep
[1:32:09] ah
[1:32:11] sleep what a nice
[1:32:15] Escape people are depressed they
[1:32:18] sleep right it's an
[1:32:22] Escape when they're worried if they can
[1:32:25] get their mind to sleep that's what the
[1:32:26] doctor said we just got to get you to
[1:32:28] sleep they want you to sleep rest
[1:32:32] rest Jonah is sewing all the
[1:32:37] signs that he's running from the
[1:32:39] presence of
[1:32:42] God so the shipmaster came unto him and
[1:32:45] said unto him what meanest thou Oh
[1:32:47] Sleeper arise call upon thy
[1:32:50] God if so be that God will think upon us
[1:32:54] that we perish not these guys are
[1:32:56] desperate saying okay
[1:33:01] look we don't know exactly what God to
[1:33:04] get a hold
[1:33:05] of we don't know exactly how God
[1:33:09] works we've got ours and maybe he'll
[1:33:12] work hopefully you have yours and if
[1:33:15] mine don't work maybe yours
[1:33:17] will right is that a fair statement just
[1:33:22] looking for some kind of God to do
[1:33:26] something there's only one
[1:33:31] God there's only one that can do
[1:33:34] anything about anything
[1:33:40] amen I appreciate their
[1:33:43] fervor and they said everyone to his
[1:33:46] fellow come and let us cast lots that we
[1:33:48] may know whose cause this evil is upon
[1:33:50] us so they CAU cast lots and the lot
[1:33:53] fell upon
[1:33:54] I've
[1:33:55] always we won't go there I ain't got
[1:34:00] time then then said they unto him tell
[1:34:04] us we pray thee for whose cause this
[1:34:06] evil is upon us what is thine occupation
[1:34:10] and whence comest thou and what is thy
[1:34:12] country and of what people art
[1:34:18] thou
[1:34:19] H and he said unto them I am a Hebrew I
[1:34:23] fear the lord
[1:34:24] Lord just not
[1:34:26] enough and the god of the god of Heaven
[1:34:30] which made the Sea and the dry
[1:34:33] land I'm a
[1:34:35] Hebrew I Fear
[1:34:37] God and my God made the Sea and the
[1:34:42] land
[1:34:47] amen then the the men were exceedingly
[1:34:50] afraid and said unto him why hast thou
[1:34:51] done this for the men knew that he had
[1:34:54] fled from the presence of the Lord
[1:34:55] because he had told
[1:35:00] them so here's Jonah now we're going to
[1:35:02] slow down just a little bit because I
[1:35:04] don't have a lot of time but we're going
[1:35:05] to slow down just a little bit and look
[1:35:07] at
[1:35:09] this
[1:35:11] Jonah knew who he was yeah knew who God
[1:35:16] was and knew what he was doing
[1:35:24] how many of
[1:35:26] you and me don't raise your
[1:35:30] hands have known those three
[1:35:34] things and still ran from the presence
[1:35:37] of
[1:35:44] God we've known those
[1:35:47] things and yet we're still
[1:35:50] running now what I find interesting
[1:35:54] is that Jonah is willing to admit
[1:36:01] this and he knows
[1:36:04] God it's not like he was in the middle
[1:36:07] of the storm and they're casting lots
[1:36:08] and he forgot all about God and he
[1:36:11] forgot all about Solomon's Prayer and he
[1:36:14] forgot all about the temple forgot all
[1:36:16] those
[1:36:20] things but he was in such a place in
[1:36:23] such a state of
[1:36:25] mind now pay
[1:36:28] attention he was at such a
[1:36:32] place that he didn't think he could get
[1:36:35] a hold of
[1:36:36] God
[1:36:38] yeah cuz the devil had put so much
[1:36:42] guilt yeah so many
[1:36:48] questions and he said this is my bed I'm
[1:36:51] going to lay in it yeah
[1:36:54] cuz he knew he was
[1:36:56] disobedient he knew he was in the
[1:37:00] wrong he knew who was he knew what he
[1:37:03] should
[1:37:04] do and he knew what he was doing
[1:37:13] yes we serve a merciful god
[1:37:18] amen we serve a God who is ready for
[1:37:21] repentance at the drop of a hat
[1:37:25] we serve a God who is ready to restore
[1:37:29] us we serve a god who's ready to bring
[1:37:32] us all the way back
[1:37:35] [Music]
[1:37:37] wow but we get in the middle of these
[1:37:40] circumstances that we've
[1:37:44] created and the devil starts whispering
[1:37:47] in our
[1:37:51] ears if Jonah
[1:37:54] could face Solomon temple in the belly
[1:37:58] of a
[1:38:02] whale
[1:38:03] surely
[1:38:05] surely he could have faced Solomon's
[1:38:08] Temple on a
[1:38:10] boat where he could
[1:38:13] see nowhere they were going at least see
[1:38:17] the stars or whatever it might be yeah
[1:38:19] do you understand what I'm saying yes
[1:38:22] sir but but here we are in the midst of
[1:38:25] these troubles in the midst of the
[1:38:26] trials and we're running from God and
[1:38:28] the devil's got such control over our
[1:38:31] mind and such control over of over who
[1:38:35] we think we
[1:38:40] are the whole story about the whale
[1:38:43] could have been totally
[1:38:45] avoided he had a space to repent right
[1:38:48] there on the boat
[1:38:57] right there and
[1:39:01] then why do we wait so
[1:39:06] long how do we listen so long to the
[1:39:09] devil that's telling us will never
[1:39:11] amount to anything how could you call
[1:39:14] yourself a
[1:39:17] Christian how could you how could you
[1:39:20] even call on God's name he's holy and
[1:39:22] look at you
[1:39:27] you look at what you've
[1:39:32] become look at what you've
[1:39:35] done look at your
[1:39:39] circumstance you have put all these
[1:39:41] Mariners all these people on this boat
[1:39:44] in danger shame on you you call yourself
[1:39:47] a Christian
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:57] he had a space to repent right
[1:40:02] there so many times when we feel
[1:40:05] ourselves getting pulled
[1:40:07] under that weight that's in our mind
[1:40:11] that mind
[1:40:15] battle we have a space to repent and
[1:40:18] calm the storm
[1:40:37] and they said unto him what shall we do
[1:40:39] unto thee that the sea may be calm unto
[1:40:42] us for the sea
[1:40:44] rought and was
[1:40:48] temptu God will move Heaven and Earth to
[1:40:51] get us Rapture Ready
[1:40:56] he will do whatever he has to do to get
[1:40:59] us Rapture Ready amen thank you
[1:41:05] Lord and it will affect the people
[1:41:07] around
[1:41:10] us it absolutely will affect people
[1:41:13] around
[1:41:16] us you mean it's my
[1:41:20] fault if you're one of his amen and he's
[1:41:24] got a
[1:41:25] plan he's willing to do whatever it
[1:41:28] takes to get you where you need to be
[1:41:31] amen the Rapture is going to happen yes
[1:41:33] sir and I can't say the Rapture is going
[1:41:36] to happen with or without you if you're
[1:41:38] one of his the Rapture is going to
[1:41:40] happen with
[1:41:43] you but you're going to be ready in
[1:41:46] order to get
[1:41:49] ready you're going to face some
[1:41:51] circumstance yes yes sir
[1:42:02] nevertheless the men rode hard to bring
[1:42:05] it to land but they could not they
[1:42:07] didn't want to throw Jonah
[1:42:09] overboard they were good moral
[1:42:14] people they didn't just want to make him
[1:42:16] fish
[1:42:18] food they they rode hard they pushed to
[1:42:21] get him to shore
[1:42:29] there's good people out there
[1:42:34] yeah they want to help you however they
[1:42:38] can but there's going to come a point
[1:42:41] where they're going to say sorry you're
[1:42:43] going in the
[1:42:45] drink because God has got to get us to
[1:42:49] that
[1:42:50] place yes sir again here's another face
[1:42:53] for Jonah to repent he didn't say wait a
[1:42:56] minute before you throw me over let me
[1:42:59] face Solomon's
[1:43:03] Temple I'm better off dead throw me
[1:43:08] in that's where he got
[1:43:12] to that was the
[1:43:14] mentality that's where the devil drives
[1:43:16] so many of us so long and that's why we
[1:43:19] stay in the slump and the stew that we
[1:43:22] get in
[1:43:24] we stay there because we choose to we
[1:43:26] don't look towards towards Jesus Christ
[1:43:29] God we're not worthy God why are you
[1:43:31] wasting time with
[1:43:33] me God I messed up over and over again
[1:43:36] why are you even spending time speaking
[1:43:38] to
[1:43:40] me I don't know why I go to
[1:43:45] church and we choose to stay there
[1:43:50] bless the truth the truth
[1:43:54] that's a trick of the
[1:43:57] devil right now I heard on a tape I
[1:44:01] think Shar seeds not air with a chook
[1:44:03] brother brandom said if you're out there
[1:44:05] right now I don't care if we're singing
[1:44:07] Whatever It Is come up to the altar
[1:44:09] we're here to get you to
[1:44:13] Christ that's the most important thing
[1:44:16] to get back to Christ amen get back to
[1:44:20] the promise I don't care what
[1:44:21] circumstance you're facing I don't care
[1:44:24] what what what you've been going through
[1:44:26] I mean I care but he really
[1:44:30] cares
[1:44:33] yes there's a space to repent there's a
[1:44:36] way to get
[1:44:39] back why put yourself through more and
[1:44:41] more and more
[1:44:54] so they took up Jonah and cast him forth
[1:44:56] into the sea and the Sea ceased from her
[1:44:59] raging
[1:45:01] what he went
[1:45:03] in Sea went
[1:45:08] calm that's called
[1:45:19] confirmation now the Lord had prepared a
[1:45:21] great fish to swallow up Jon
[1:45:24] and Jonah was in the belly of the fish
[1:45:26] for three days and three nights now
[1:45:30] maybe it's just
[1:45:31] me but in my mind I don't appreciate
[1:45:35] those three days and three
[1:45:38] nights Jonah was in the fish for three
[1:45:41] days and three
[1:45:46] nights he sat in his circumstances for
[1:45:49] three days and three nights
[1:45:57] three
[1:45:58] days and three
[1:46:00] nights amen and I don't know if it was
[1:46:03] the fact that he realized that he was
[1:46:05] still breathing that kind of woke him up
[1:46:07] to the fact that he was in the well the
[1:46:09] The Well of a
[1:46:15] baale the belly of a
[1:46:20] whale I mean that in itself is showing
[1:46:23] that God's got a
[1:46:24] plan if you're still
[1:46:32] breathing if you're still
[1:46:36] breathing
[1:46:38] God has a plan for
[1:46:42] you it is never too
[1:46:48] late amen
[1:46:56] chapter
[1:46:57] 2 three days and three nights and then
[1:47:00] Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out
[1:47:03] of the fish's
[1:47:05] belly and said I Cry by reason of my
[1:47:07] Affliction unto the Lord whose
[1:47:10] Affliction his
[1:47:12] Affliction who put him in that
[1:47:14] Affliction
[1:47:16] him yes
[1:47:18] sir it took him 3 days in a rough boat
[1:47:22] right
[1:47:27] yeah and he heard me out of the belly of
[1:47:31] Hell cried I and thou heardest my
[1:47:35] voice I got to
[1:47:38] hurry and he said I cries Cried by
[1:47:41] reason of my Affliction un the Lord and
[1:47:43] uh for thou Hast cast me into the deep
[1:47:46] in the midst of the Seas and the floods
[1:47:48] Compass about me all thy Billows and all
[1:47:51] thy waves are passed over me
[1:47:53] then said I I am cast out of thy
[1:47:56] sight
[1:47:58] yet will I look
[1:48:00] again unto thy Holy
[1:48:02] Temple he says I am cast out of thy
[1:48:08] sight was he cast out of God's
[1:48:15] sight sometimes turning back to
[1:48:18] God Amen is a process
[1:48:25] and you can tell what Jonah's going
[1:48:27] through
[1:48:28] here because I he says I was cast out of
[1:48:31] thy
[1:48:34] side that mind battle was still
[1:48:39] going the devil was still whispering in
[1:48:42] his ear the devil was still working on
[1:48:50] him it just sometimes it just takes a
[1:48:53] little stir just a little bit say oh God
[1:48:56] help me I know I'm not worthy God says
[1:49:00] you
[1:49:01] are he'll Whisper
[1:49:03] back you are thank you
[1:49:13] Jes for thou Hast cast me in the deep in
[1:49:16] the midst of the Sea and the floods
[1:49:18] Compass me about all thy Billows and the
[1:49:20] waves are passed over me
[1:49:24] then said I I said I am cast out of thy
[1:49:27] sight yet will I look again toward my
[1:49:29] Holy Temple and the waters can passed
[1:49:31] about me even to the
[1:49:34] soul and the dep closed me round about
[1:49:38] and the weeds were wrapped about my
[1:49:40] head symptoms circumstance symptoms and
[1:49:44] Circumstance
[1:49:49] yeah I went down to the bottom of the
[1:49:51] mountain the Earth with her bars was
[1:49:53] about me forever yet thou Hast brought
[1:49:57] up my life from corruption
[1:50:02] wow he's starting to
[1:50:07] recognize
[1:50:09] sometimes especially you learn this as
[1:50:12] you get older again but when you get
[1:50:15] down to
[1:50:17] pray it's like it's not going
[1:50:20] nowhere just just going
[1:50:23] nowhere and what the devil wants to
[1:50:26] do is get you up and doing something
[1:50:34] else that's what he wants to do
[1:50:37] because if you stay down
[1:50:41] there and you keep talking to him and
[1:50:45] you start getting sincere you go
[1:50:49] from I don't know who I am and I don't
[1:50:52] know why you'd even listen to
[1:50:54] me to talking lip to ear with
[1:50:57] God that's the jump but it's a
[1:51:01] process the devil's going to tell you
[1:51:03] all your circumstances he's going to
[1:51:05] tell you how worthless you are he's
[1:51:06] going to tell you that that God wants
[1:51:08] nothing to do with you that God's given
[1:51:10] up on you that God why would God love
[1:51:12] you why would God care yes sir and you
[1:51:15] start there but if you pursue pursue yes
[1:51:20] right after God
[1:51:24] sometimes he wants to be
[1:51:26] pursued he wants you to get serious he
[1:51:30] wants to see how much time you'll
[1:51:31] dedicate to him right sir how sincere
[1:51:35] you'll get with him amen amen how how
[1:51:39] hard you'll chase after him how bad you
[1:51:42] want to hear his voice right yes sir
[1:51:48] true if you stay there your language
[1:51:53] will
[1:51:54] change your thoughts will
[1:51:58] change your answers will come praise the
[1:52:02] Lord your peace will be
[1:52:05] restored hallelujah hallelujah because
[1:52:08] you pursued after
[1:52:10] God yes
[1:52:13] sir prayer is another
[1:52:16] circumstance you're
[1:52:19] tired you got 1,500 different things to
[1:52:22] do
[1:52:24] yeah but he wants you to pursue after
[1:52:27] him yes he
[1:52:32] does and he don't care what position
[1:52:35] you're in or where you're
[1:52:37] at
[1:52:40] amen I don't pray on my knees at night
[1:52:44] it's not not that that's not what I do
[1:52:47] you might do that that's
[1:52:50] okay yes I drive
[1:52:53] live and I talk to the Lord not with my
[1:52:55] eyes
[1:53:00] closed but I talk with the
[1:53:03] Lord yeah praise the
[1:53:07] Lord I'll be at work just start talking
[1:53:10] to
[1:53:14] him he doesn't care he just wants you to
[1:53:17] pursue after
[1:53:21] him don't
[1:53:24] stop if you find yourself falling asleep
[1:53:27] stand up walk around talk to him walking
[1:53:30] around yeah we've got too much form and
[1:53:33] fashion built into our mind that
[1:53:35] sometimes we miss out on
[1:53:39] God pursue after him
[1:53:43] yes
[1:53:46] than Jonah's in the belly of a whale do
[1:53:49] you think he was he was not I would get
[1:53:51] down and kneel but I would take for a to
[1:53:52] get back up so do you think his hands
[1:53:55] were
[1:53:58] folded oh Lord he's got seaweed wrapped
[1:54:02] around his
[1:54:05] head his circumstances were not the
[1:54:17] best when my soul fainted within me I
[1:54:19] remembered the Lord and my prayer came
[1:54:23] unto thee into thine Holy
[1:54:28] Temple they that
[1:54:30] observe lying
[1:54:34] vanities forsake their own Mercy that's
[1:54:38] right they that observe lying vanities
[1:54:42] forsake their own Mercy Jonah
