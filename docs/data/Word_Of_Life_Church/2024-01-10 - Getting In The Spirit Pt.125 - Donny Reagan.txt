before or sometimes it can be repetitive things that you faced but the grace of God will always be there won't he thank Lord he loves to get his children in such a spot sometimes that they don't know what to do which way they're going to turn brother B said he loves it it's strange you know you'd think a father would love that but he loves to get his children to such a difficult spot that your back is against the Red Sea and the Egyptian Army is behind you and there seems like there's absolutely no way out and here he comes and he loves to manifest himself that way praise the Lord aren't you happy to be a child of God serving a wonderful father like that tonight let's turn a few go to the Book of Matthew chap 16 ver 18 we'll read together there and also 1 Timothy chapter 3 we greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus what a wonderful opportunities given to us to represent our Lord and his kingdom I want you to think tonight as we look into the scripture that we are part of the government of God on the Earth We're part of a kingdom a great portion of that kingdom is invisible but there is a portion that is visible and we are part of that visible part but we're driven by the invisible Moses Moses had an experience with such a thing so many many years ago but the Bible says that he saw him who was invisible so that's kind of peculiar isn't it you're going to see somebody who is invisible but if you ever see him your life will be changed forever amen so hopefully we can see him tonight in our presence the invisible part as well as the visible part and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it how many believes that with all your heart the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now Paul in 1 Timothy chapter 3:14 giving the the position of the church the New Testament Church remember it hadn't been that long in the gospel now to where that this was written 1 Timothy let me see 2 Timothy 66 1 Timothy been around 6162 a something like that so about 30 years so the revelation of what God had been doing in the body had certainly become more clear but Paul wrote things about the body that the rest of the Apostles even Peter said he writes things it's hard to be understood this no doubt was one of them these things write I unto thee hoping to come un thee shortly but if i tar long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of the truth now listen to the adjectives that he uses to describe this body of Christ how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God so we're not just talking about how that when we come to this building here how we ought to behave ourselves that's important we know that's very important to God but how we ought to behave ourself in the house of God in the house of God each one of us is members in that house so your behavior can affect me my behavior can affect you so if we know how to behave oursel in the house of God and where do we get such teaching and training well we get it in this house of God we get it in this house here so that it will teach us how to behave oursel in the house of God which is he says the Church of the Living God we know this building isn't that one day it'll be destroyed totally annihilated so he's teaching us more than just the church house as we call it the the pillar and ground of the truth how many would say tonight Lord open my understanding have a prayer call here tonight from Sister Sandy bagot it's concerning her brother-in-law uh Dennis fleeman has a real rare form of cancer and they've been doing some tests and things on him I think they turn in actually maybe require prayer request and you Bou on Sunday so apparently they've got some of the results back and um it's a very serious situation so we'd like to uh pray for him tonight how many else has a need on your heart maybe a person or a thing or situation in your life let's just take it to the Lord right now Heavenly Father we know it's such a great privilege and opportunity that we can bow our heads to the dust of the earth to know that our father so many many years ago our Father Abraham when you were going to make known to him your Covenant and you told him first to look at the sand and you said if you can count the sand that will be the number of your seed then you raised him up and looked him up toward heaven and he lifted his eyes and said now look to the stars and if you can tell the Stars so the prophet picked that up and he used these words from dust to Stars so that's what we are here tonight from the dust of the earth we have been elevated by the new birth and our election becoming more clear and more plain every day so we're rising from dust to stars on our loved ones pass from us they go from dust into that Realm of the heavens not that they become a glistening star shining in the night sky but they move into that Realm of heavenly bodies when you were here Lord Jesus you said in my father's house are many mansions but we know it's not castles palaces but it's bodies Tabernacles we're so thankful that we have one but we know as we go through this life this old body here can certainly become Afflicted with anxiety and worry and sickness and disease and trouble so we bring these requests to you tonight father I pray for this request from Sister Sandy Lord you see the situation the diagnosis that they've given to Dennis and we're praying God for your mercy to him Lord you know the status of his soul has been some time since I've talked to him so I really don't know where he's at there but you do father so we're praying not only for his body but if there's anything lacking in that soul that you just deal with him Lord Lord we know what what a diagnosis like this can be to hear it from a doctor it can be heartbreaking but Lord God we believe that you're a God of Miracles a god of the supernatural so we're praying that you'd move for him for his family now Lord we all here tonight have a need we've assembled ourselves together that we could sing and pray and worship now we've come to the breaking of the bread of life and we need your help I need your help no doubt more than anyone here because I've studied I've prayed I've applied myself but yet it takes the anointing on me to help me to be able to convey what you put on my heart but they also need the anointing to be able to receive it so would you speak to us tonight father and then when the service is over we will say did not our hearts burn within us as he talked with us along the way granted I pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated you know the government of the Lord Jesus is something that certainly been misunderstood down Through the Ages the greatest misunderstanding probably has been brought by those that are in the so-called church and we know of course that in 325 ad whenever they wanted to form a government which was contrary to Apostolic Doctrine then they begin to change the shape and the ideology of the way that people would look at the word church from that point on so since 325 ad when it got worse and worse under the different um Emperors the Romans and then of course changed to to the pontificate or the popey himself then with the uh Wars that would go on under the great conquerors they would take over Jerusalem they would face the Moors they would come against the muhammadans they would kill them supposedly in the name of the Cross they would kill them in the name of the Christianity so-called they would have Christ on their Shields Christ on their ornaments and all that sort of thing and it began to change a mindset of what people thought about the church we know of course that that had nothing to do with the church that Jesus himself established is that right that's not what Jesus is even talking about yet to this day many of the Muslims still identify us as Christians with that and they say that's what the early Christians done there wasn't one one Holy Ghost filled child of God in that mess I can tell you that right now there wasn't one of them went around killing people and cutting their heads off killing their babies and doing all that nonsense is that right yet they done it in the name of a church and I agree with that but it was not in the name of this church that the Lord Jesus established then as we go along the denominations and from the mother they came down to become the daughters then the daughters would start accepting to their ideology what their government would be so each denomination would make its own government and they have their own government to this day and they have in their headquarters where it's in Cleveland Tennessee or wherever it is around the world and they will have their their order by which they do certain things they will also have their discipline Ary action by which if a minister and their denomination does not follow what they teach then they will discipline him and they will discipline that church so once the denomination of course if they build the building then they own that building so if you try to pull away from that building you can't really do much about it because the denomination itself funnels the money in which gives them great control of what goes on and then people think well that's God's government that has nothing to do with God at all it is a man-made system controlled many times by men which don't know a bit more about God than a rabbit would know about snowshoes they know nothing about God they quote his Bible but as far as knowing the person of God they know nothing about God and Satan did that first of all to deceive the multitudes and the masses down to the age but he also did it to be able to make a scarecrow so that then that would make those that are independent which we are that would make every independent child of God it would make them resent almost any form of government even gods because Satan took the false and made a scarecrow and it worked so well it scares Eagles now that's quite a scarecrow whenever you can take a scarecrow and scare Sons and Daughters of God can you imagine how Hell must laugh when sincere honest people are scared to death of scriptures and quotes because because they are so terrified of a scarecrow I imagine Satan that must be one of his greatest days in the regions of the lost when saved people are terrified to hear a servant of God read scripture read quotes and put together God's declaration himself and Satan and his demons watch the saints of God free up he watches them as they just sat there and they shudder and it just almost a terror comes over them why the Scarecrow the scarecrow has worked so effectively on them that they think oh my goodness I'll be glad when he gets done with this oh Lord Oh Lord where's he going where's he going straight in the scripture straight in the message of the hour but watch the scary about it it's the Scarecrow and the Scarecrow is so effective it even works on children of God now to me that is a sad scenario I see scarecrows should work on Crows but they should never work on eagles they should work on all that out there of course but it should have no fear tactic at all on a child of God and I hope tonight by the grace of God that we are going to be able to look into the scripture are you willing to take a walk with me in the word of God and we will be able to once we are done to look in and say okay I see I see why Satan has always wanted me to be afraid because of my past affiliation with this church or that church or this certain man that was nothing but a dictator now remember you don't have to belong to an organization to have a spirit of organization on you there's been many preachers around this message that have been as independent as they could be they were not controlled by headquarters they were not controlled by a bunch of men they were controlled by one man so whether you're controlled by one or 500 it's still the same Spirit of organization if it makes any man your head over Christ the word now that can even be your father or it can be your husband or it can be a businessman or it can be a preacher or it can be one pushy Deacon in a church that thinks he's got the upper hand and the say over everybody else well y'all are getting as quiet as a bunch of church house mouses already so you see people get their mind that it just has to be the preacher oh no I've known many many businessmen and this message that were just as controlling if not more so than any preacher I ever met you remember reading in your Bible there was a man that John began to write about doct tropies and he said that he would not even let the saints of God receive John sir now can you imagine what a control di atrophies had over the local assembly you know Di fees was not a preacher but he was a wealthy businessman and does had such control that John called his name and John said that he would not receive the men of God and he wouldn't even let the church receive him so here you had a man with a denominational Spirit on him and he was controlling the Assembly of God you know as I read that I've never understood for the life of me why the church would ever let that happen you think why in the world would the Church of the Living God ever allow a businessman to get such control in the assembly that they would not set that man down and say you sat down and shut your mouth I guarantee you some of you would do it to me you do it to me and you ain't got enough guts to to do it to a rich man I call you a panty waste [Music] coward well thank you Jesus praise the Lord but you see whether it's a preacher or whether it would be a man with so much money he don't know what to do with it well as far as God's concerned there ain't no difference between them money might say something to us but it sure don't say nothing to God is that right so God don't want the onean preacher God don't want the businessman God don't want a controlling Deacon or a controlling song leader whoever God doesn't want one person anywhere controlling the body the body is Sovereign within itself as you know you have the ability to vote me out you have the ability to vote in your deacons your trust sees all those offices but yet I don't have the ability to vote you out now boy we go to talking about Fair somehow or another that seemed like I got the short end of the stick on that deal but yet that's the way God set it up now he did that for a reason you believe that he knew that would be controlling men that would come in and take over so he allowed the apostles to be be able to write to us and give us an Apostolic Forum that would set it up for the ages that are to come and then the prophet picks it up the quote we read last Wednesday spoken words original C his shoulders is his body whereas the government on the Earth's act it's his body Saints shall judge the Earth is that right so not just preachers now but the Saints will actually judge Angels so Saints whenever they come into that glorified body God will make Fallen Angels walk before you right and you will judge them now Paul runs this parallel about the government being in the saints of God and some of the Corinthian folks were having arguments in the church and 1 Corinthians 6 I believe it is and he says what Would You all take one another to law don't you know that the saints of God will judge Angels so he said why would you take such matters then to to the law when it should be brought before the saints of God so Paul was bringing something to the assemblies that they would be able to recognize the government of God on the earth is actually in the church so I understand a lot of the message folks don't believe it that way I understand that the majority of Christendom does not believe it that way but I do cuz I'm a Bible believer amen I'm not just a Christian I'm a Bible believing Christian now you'd be surprised how few there are in the message cuz you show them the Bible and you show them the message they'll look right at it but I believe it this way well that shows you're not a Bible believing Christian you're only certain passages of the Bible well Hallelujah somehow I didn't think this is going going to go over this way tonight now watch the saint shall judge the Earth where's the government going to be upon upon the shoulders his body the government upon the shoulders that's a part of the body what is it his Earthly strength God's Earthly strength is his word made flesh in his body here on Earth bringing it to pass now now if people really believe that there's no way you're going to convince me that people would have the same idea about sitting at home and playing a tape on church service night they if they really believed what this Prophet just said right here they would know that every time according to what them tapes say if God is in your heart you cannot wait for them Church doors to come open now you understand why a lot of these people don't do that it's quite simple God is not in their heart it's just as simple as it can be it's not complex you know now notice this this is how that the administrative value of the body of the government of God on the earth will be orchestrated he never committed it now to a group of men that a group would come together at at this Council and that Council and they'll decide on this and that and the other God no God God don't trust that but God designated a way by which he would do it now he said you can only serve God as you and believe the servants that God sends you can only serve God on Earth see as God's servants that sent on Earth by divine inspiration interprets the word to you so it's not a group it's not somewhere at headquarters but God chooses and Seven Ages he chose the messengers of those ages is that right then God would anoint them being the eye and the horn and they would catch the message of God for that day now the reformers would go back to what was written but remember if God's got something something else that he wants to say which is not actually written in the pages of the Bible now I know that makes some folks that say they believe the message their nose get all wrinkled up but that's your nose and your problem because I look at the prophet of our day being in the same caliber as any of them of the Old Testament or any of them of the new now somehow some of y'all may look at our Prophet as being just a minor boy and one that really ain't got the authority well first of of all I'm not sure you understand what a prophet is a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the written word not only that but if God has something he wants to say he will convey that through his Prophet on the earth at that time God can't do that to me cuz I'm not a prophet praise the Lord God can't do that to any other Pastor any other teacher any other evangelist that can only happen to a word prophet and somebody said amen now God does it that way so watch he said he that heareth you heareth me and he that despises you despises me he that despises me despises him that sent me that proves that God speaks his message through his servants always has that's right no it's amazing how people look at Authority and subjection most people look at subjection as depriving them of authority but actually that's backwards you see when God designates a certain protocol in his body then every person in that order of protocol gets in their position and there they stay they are actually enabled with the spirit of God to give them the authority they need to carry out their particular office now when they step out of that position because they look at Authority above them and they resent that and they say oh no no no I I could never be under pasture I could never be under a prophet and you see that ain't just so with Ley but preachers get to the same place so preachers will get an idea of what they think in their mind and yet somebody will show them something in the message of the hour that's contrary and you know what they'll do now I know this firsthand because I've done it for decades to preachers you know and you hear a preacher say this or that or the other thing well maybe he don't know no different so you send him one quote and then another quote and then another quote then it becomes one page two page three page four page 40 pages 50 pages and then he comes right back and said well yeah I I know that but I still believe it this way well you see what that man just did he stepped out from under the protocol of God under the headship of a church a messenger everybody following me and instead of getting more Authority he lost more right why because we are empowered we are empowered as long as we stay in our position I I was meeting with some people last night and someone had a question about hair and as I begin to look at that in 1 Corinthians s chap 11 and I begin to show this family which is part of our church and I show them that what Paul is dealing with about the woman having long hair and the man cutting his hair and I went the verses above the hair verses and showed them the protocol of God and that was that Paul was dealing with authority submission subjection and so on so he said that the man his head is Christ and that the man was of course the head head over the woman and God the spirit the invisible was the head over Christ now Paul sets the order of the protocol so here we've got the invisible God then we have the Christ the anointed Humanity of God then we have the man and then we have the woman now each one of them have a head except for the Eternal one and he is the head then after you set that in order then Paul comes down and he goes to talking about a man having long hair now he said says nature itself would teach you that it's a shame for a man to do that so then a man that would come in here and a man would get up and pray with a hat on or a man would get up and pray with shoulder linked hair or long hair then we'd look at him and say hey buddy that ain't right you're not supposed to do that well why do we believe that because we believe when the man does that he brings a part of femininity over onto his own body and he changes his image I I hope you're going to understand this but way back in the 70s when the hippie move started it was the Forerunner of the transgender saying we're dealing with right now you see if this transgender thing if they would have started that in the 70s well a bunch of them old hiil and tennesseeans that'll run them out years ago and they'll whoop the fire at of them and there would been no transgenders in this day so that didn't go over but what they do Satan knows how to put it in just a little at a time he don't never show you the poison rotness that he wants to give you but he wants to give you just a little bit of bad covered over with a whole lot of good and then what he does little by little he takes away more good and gives you more bad giving you more more bad less good more bad less good and then he Springs this big major stuff and you're thinking Lord have mercy I can't believe that I never thought it'd be that way of course that's the way he does so Paul was showing them from man to have long hair that he's bringing femininity upon himself for the woman to have short hair or cut hair then she's taking away from her image of what God made her to have her long hair and she's bringing the masculine image upon herself by doing so she Rebels out from under her head so when a man then has long hair what is it a sign of his Rebellion against the image of God so so when a preacher then will refuse to line up with the word of God he's doing the same thing so in other words Jesus has a right to put that preacher away in spiritual divorcement right just like a man has a right to divorce his wife now it don't mean that he will and it don't mean that he has to but whenever a preacher Pastor H who he is will not come subject to the teaching of the word of the day then that man is walking on very very very dangerous ground because if he does not repent and line up under the headship of God for the age he will be put away in divorce oh my goodness friends this is serious things this is very serious but now do even a lot of the message people who say they believe every word that that that statement just about makes me sick in my stomach whenever I hear some of them saying it because they don't believe 100th of every word much less every word if they believed every word they would find a church and said Under A God Called pasture and they would associate with the family of God and they would be identified with the family of God and instead of staying home and pressing play tell me how can you fulfill the scripture in the book of Hebrews forsake not the assembling of yourselves to together as the manner of some is how can you do that and say you can be as good a Christian being home you're lying God's Prophet said you cannot do it amen so they don't believe what he said now watch first Thessalonians chapter 1 verse6 watch now Paul he wanted to assert his Apostolic position not that he could be a lord over God's people Peter even used that word he said that we would be be a lord over the heritage of God they never done that so that they would be a lord over the people of God but so that the people of God would be able to take their word as it was God's word himself so he must establish this Apostolic Authority so he said you become followers of us and of the Lord having received the word in much Affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost now watch Paul is identifying the real Believers of that age by the way they followed his teaching now the question is if you would have lived and this is 1 Thessalonians around 55 ad so if you would have lived in 55 ad brother Nathan instead of 2024 what would have been our attitude toward these books right here so these books were being passed around among the churches and the people were accepting them and saying that these were the words of God but yet we know that they were written by Paul and sometimes by Luke as Paul would dictate to Luke and yet others are some that that that ain't the word of God that's just the words of them men you mean you were going to take that that book of Thessalonians and put it on the same level as the Torah you're going to put Romans and Corinthians and Philippians and and Timothy and Titus and Hebrews you you you people are going to put that on the same basis as Genesis and exodus and Leviticus and numbers and Deuteronomy you're going to put that on the same basis that's God's Prophet Moses what would you have said yes we are praise the Lord yes we are now watch again in 1 Thessalonians 1:7 so that ye were amples to all that believe in Macedonia and aaya now watch how that followers produced in samples so they become followers of Paul and true followers not in word only but in deed and in spirit then they actually become the word that he preached in so much that he would say that ye are written Epistles read and known of all men so God a lot of people want to leave it now well just the prophet of the age just the prophet of the age and there are certain things that apply only to the prophet of the age we know that but if the examples of this message of the hour stop with brother brandom then it does not fulfill the apostolic fulfillment of the Bride being restored back to the apostolic Foundation because it did not stop with Paul it did not stop with Peter but the real Believers become an expression of Paul's message now they were not worshiping Paul they were not going around talking about Paul more than they talked about Jesus but I can imagine if you would have been sitting in them churches and yes they had churches and yes they went to church praise the Lord notice again in 1 Thessalonians chapter 2:14 for ye Brethren became followers of the churches of God now this is not the Cleveland the other Mountain assembly either and it's not the Church of God of Prophecy either there ain't no such a thing in the Bible but it was the real Church of the Living Gods I want you to notice now the brethren in thessalonica which was made up of many Gentiles you Brethren became followers of the churches of God so whenever the churches started following Paul then what was going on the Law of Spiritual reproduction was happening they then were affecting other people's lives by that word that they heard and they thought this is absolutely wonderful I want to be a Christian like that I want to walk that way I know they were not making Idols no doubt of these people and they were not assuming that they were higher than what they were but they were simply following their ample which God had given to Paul for ye Brethren became followers of the churches of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as have they of the Jews now notice where they were suffering it from the Jews so the Jews which were holding the law of Moses and they were righteous and this and that and they were some of the greatest persecutors there was of the real children of god notice chapter 5:14 now there has to be if there's going to be government if there's going to be a body and there's going to be regulations and Regulators then there has to be order and there has to be a way that we will deal with people that will step out of line on occasion now listen what they did in the New Testament now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly now listen warn them that are unruly friends don't get all bent out of shape don't get all nervous and all uptight I ain't fixing a call nobody's name notice we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly look at the meaning of the word disorderly out of ranks often so of soldiers irregular inordinate deviating from the prescribed order or Rule now Paul knew of course as well as Peter and the rest of the Apostles that there was going to be people that would come around and they would Buck against as we call it the order of God they knew they would so now Paul is not only going to tell them look what I'm writing to you is the Commandment of God that's settle right so then Paul must also tell them what to do when certain people wouldn't walk according to that order from God well praise the Lord notice I found another meaning of this word the word means careless out of line it was applied to a soldier who would not keep rank but insisted on marching his own way now Paul didn't say well just ignore them and just let it go nothing will come of it but Paul first said warn them now we exal you Brethren warn them that are unruly and I always find this amazing that the next thing he would say is Comfort the feeble-minded uhhuh I'll tell you why a lot of times we'll read another scripture here momentarily but it will be the feebleminded the weak on that will follow such people real scriptural trained people check every move they make by the word amen well praise the Lord now he says now exort your brethren warn them that are unruly so the the body of God is an army is it not so each of us then have a designated Rank by God and in that rank we will March at a certain place so this then is a person who is constantly breaking Rank and their rank is supposed to be at a certain position when they say no no no no no no no no no no I know I can do more than this I'm greater than this my potential is so much greater and they're all the time moving out of the rank and getting up and getting into things that they don't have the ability to take care of come on now now I know y'all know here that you only have one pastor but you actually have several hundred Associates okay cuz nearly everybody here has got an opinion how the church ought to be run come on and a lot of them tell me so now y'all's toes was crumpled up like this and your shoes now they went notice he says so warn warn warn which a lot of preachers don't do anymore they don't give out warnings why CU people don't want to hear them yeah right but Paul said warn them warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men 2 Thessalonians chapter 3: 6 now we uhoh we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Jesus Christ yes sir now we're moving into a different line here so we have a command from a prophet of God everybody going to do that you okay with that is that what you want you want you want to follow the commands now he said we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye withdraw yeah yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us wow now Paul is here not only telling the people of church in thessalonica but to us as well we believe that right so look at the meaning of this word withdraw to remove oneself withdraw oneself to depart to abstain from familiar fellowship with one but I wonder how many Christians do this and yet it's a command in God's word if you can't say Amen could you at least say ouch so I know you're still alive thank you now we command brethren in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother so we're not talking about now that the saints of God are hanging around drunks Liars you know I mean these people that don't even profess Christianity but this is from a man who is claiming to be a brother of course it can be a preacher it can be a deacon it can be a a a good man as people say amen well it's getting hot in here ain't it okay so we are supposed to withdraw ourself from every brother that walketh disorderly oh oh no don't tell me it's the same meaning the same same word attack Taos out of ranks often of soldiers irregular inordinate deviating from the prescribed order or Rule now why is Paul saying this he knew Satan would not stay from without the ranks of this great Army of God that's right he knows he's going to move in just like he did in the Garden of Eden so Paul is giving them a heads up on what to do when Satan come among them you know what's so sad about it with that warning a lot of them never even listened if they would have done this down Through the Ages a lot of the false preachers and false doctrines and false moves that has been since the very beginning up till now the saints of God would have had the ability to put a Hulk to it immediately but it's the saints that don't obey this now this is not to the Sinners the Christians are the ones that starts giving an ear to false teachers and false prophets on oh my praise the Lord now what they should do is take it right back to the word and check it by the word and say wait a minute wait a minute now wait a minute this brother here I'll tell you one thing he's not saying what the prophet said he is not he is not carrying it out he's skipping over this he's skipping over that I know somebody confronted him on that and he he said oh yeah yeah yeah right right right right but he still don't admit he was wrong a preacher that won't admit he's wrong and the word is right you better run from him big time cuz that man's going to lead you straight to the tribulation period look friends if you're bride God will never set you under a preacher that ain't preaching a rapturing message we need more than healing we need more than shouting and jumping and I believe in all of that don't you but I need a rapturing message as well oh my notice the power of this verse now can you imagine some of the people in thessalonica and Corin uh and some of the other cities that begin to get this book as it was shared around well really what in book for it been more like a script or a scroll and they would have read it oh brother Larry I'd say some of them got some mad that said who does he think he is who does he think he is who put him in charge Jesus right well praise the Lord as a matter of fact Jesus put him in charge of this disciplinary action that would be set down through the church ages Peter never even addresses it this way nor does James if Paul hadn't done it we wouldn't have had it in the entire scripture so Jesus put him in charge of it hope that don't choke you notice I we command you brethren in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition oh you see it's a common thing it must have been in that day as it is today one that people will say well I I'll take everything that brother random said was thus sayith the Lord but all the rest of it you know maybe just his opinion might be right might not be right but if now if it's thus sayith the Lord then I'll take it so Paul said you're not only responsible for thus sayeth the Lord that I teach but the Traditions good yes sir anybody need a drink to help get it down now friends why is this strange why is this strange scarecrows going all up everywhere Lord have mercy I'd say some people's done kicked off the internet their computer done blowed up my say oh Lord Oh Lord where brother Donnie going well where does it look like to you I'm going straight into the Bible your Bible your Bible that you should spend more time reading now notice what tradition means ordinance tradition by instruction the substance of the teaching so you understand it was not necessary that Paul include a thus sayth the Lord after every scripture have you looked in any of Paul's writings and took an account of how many times when Paul said now this is thus sayeth the Lord are them the only ones you're going to read well you see people don't look at the teaching of the message and the same way they do the New Testament it's like they don't understand the substance of the teaching yes thus sayeth the Lord exactly right but I also believe the teachings of the message I believe the traditions of of Paul and as a matter of fact if you don't you won't go in the Rapture you're excluded because you broke your rank and you said well I think and I now I'm asking you who put you in charge CU it sure wasn't Jesus I mean a bunch of us didn't even have enough sense to know if it's one God two Gods three Gods God's going to put you in charge come on we didn't even know our way out of Darkness we wouldn't even be saved today if it wasn't for the grace of God we didn't know how to worship God we didn't know how to pray we didn't know if there's one God two God three Gods many gods we didn't know but we needed a godsent leader we needed a prophet in this age and yes he would say thus sayith the Lord but he would also have sound solid teaching amen sir praise the Lord notice now in chapter 3: 7 for yourselves know how you ought to follow us verse n not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ample unto you to follow us now what's he doing this for he knows people are going to follow somebody everybody's going to follow somebody if it ain't nobody but your wife or your mother yeah amen it's in humanity it's in humanity to look up to people my goodness friend look at all these influencers they call them on YouTube and all the rest of this Social Media stuff I mean people out in the sticks people that look as weird as all get out and they can get s several million followers and they're influencers don't you understand the devil is copying what God does don't you understand what a prophet is he's a real influencer don't you understand what a real man of God is he's a real influencer every preacher that gets behind this Pulpit is trying to influence you in a right way to influence you to read your Bible pray get closer to God of course most of them preachers will get more dislikes than they get likes I sure ain't got no 2.9 Million followers oh my goodness notice in verse 14 and if any man obey not our word by this epistle then just act like everything is fine and don't nobody say anything and don't nobody you know just just act like everything is fine cuz we're covering it by love this ain't the kind of love I'm preaching about on Sunday that's the lay of seeing ooey gooey nonsense notice now what Paul says if any B obey not our word by this epistle our word a't it amazing brother a Paul didn't say God's word come on hello now listen what Believers are supposed to do note that man so if a man don't do Paul said what I'm teaching then you're supposed to note that man or Mark him put a check on him and then not him is part one part two is have no huh to mix together to keep company be intimate with one now you see this doesn't just apply to preachers it doesn't just apply to older people it can also apply to the youth all you needs one young boy or one young girl and gets in the youth group and they go I don't like this and I don't like that I don't like something else they go to complaining about this and complaining about that now don't sit there and look at me like you you young ones are a bunch of angels your mama and daddy sitting there looking at me like you are but you and I both know you ain't right and our church is like every other church and I hate this about us we're too clish we've got our own little three or four more no more shame on us we need to reach beyond our little cliff and reach beyond our little Clan come on somebody say [Applause] Amen thank you brother friend help us Lord so then a person that did not obey don't you understand friend why is Paul saying that is he trying to control the Saints he's trying to eliminate a lot of trouble in their lives and a lot of trouble in the church but wonder how many listen to them and yet we say we believe this word of God hallelujah I'll die for that Bible you might ought to read it first before you make that statement or you could say it this way I'll die for what I know all three verses Hallelujah I may change my mind after I know 15 but right now I'm firm on them tree that I know Hallelujah to God mama if any man now he didn't say excluding preachers excluding deacons excluding Sunday school teachers excluding old brother so and so and old sister so and so he put everybody in the same category said If any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him and this is the reason reason why that he may be ashamed now I wonder how much trouble down through the church ages would have totally been stopped by the government of the body so whenever the thing began to raise up about the nicians in the first church age it was already there the spirit was so the coldness and they didn't want the prophet said they begin to cry out them them you know fancy people come in and got saved and they didn't want no more of them jumping shouting screaming hollering people so they wanted to get away from that or what if the Church of the Living God would say hold [Music] it you're not saying what Paul said so therefore you sir are a liar come on I just quoted your a quote except for the word sir I did that I guarantee if we had more of that going on in this day we'd have a whole lot less junk to deal with in our lives somebody goes to come to you after church with the latest gossip let me tell you so who some of the worst gossipers I know preachers I'm telling you what some of the preachers around this message they worse than women oh Lord Jesus oh my you get around them boy they got to K up on this and catch up on that catch up on some something else my goodness Brother Don what in the world are you doing I'm preaching for a Revival you say Revival yeah don't you remember when brother B stood on the great one of the Great Lakes there and he said the water was coming up through there and all the trash is blown out he said what was happening he said that Lake Michigan was having a Revival there was one more drop of water than what had had when it started but all the tri was washed out on the B that's what we need a bunch of Tri washed out on the B brother sister then you talking about having Revival we'll have one and it won't last from Youth Camp to Youth Camp and banquet to banquet it'll last from now through eternity praise God notice again in Hebrews 6:12 that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith in patience and herit to promise now he's giv them Direction on who to follow follow again Hebrews 12:7 or 13:7 most people know the next verse I've heard very few quote the prior verse remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation isn't it amazing that we don't quote verse seven right along with verse 8 so you're pointing to Men of God that have led you thus far and the end of those men of God's conversation is Hebrews 138 so you see a man of God that that's not the end of his conversation run I mean run even in the cold weather run if I ever get to a spot at the end of my conversation it's not that he's the same yesterday today and forever have an election boot me out praise the Lord notice whose face follow praise the Lord considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever may it always be my theme may it be the end of my conversation oh how many wants it to be yours notice again now Romans chapter 16:1 17 now you see the government ain't fun is it can you imagine going to the State House in Nashville where they go to makeing legislature and a band gets up and said now we need to pass a bill up in Carter County I'll tell you one thing we need to do such and such and so and so and so and somebody's going to say what in the world we need that bill for in Carter County why we can't spell it ain't none of us even know what it even means what we need is more food stamps and more health and less tax and less biomics well you saying we need agronomics we ain't got no egg nomics we we need more money to pay our bills and they go back and forth and back and forth but there's got to be laws in the state of Tennessee there's got to be laws in the United States there's laws in the body of God there's laws in the house of God our church has laws if your family don't have them I feel sorry for you but you see we're living in such an age of Grace our children can come and go as they please we have no curfew we let them do whatever they want on their phone they can look at whatever they want new parents never even check them out they can be with whoever they want to be with if they want to Comm in it to 3:00 in the morning that's okay I'm giving them more liberty no you're ruing them preach brother Donnie now watch Romans chapter 16 verse1 17 I beseech you Brethren mark them why does he keep on with this he's giving them a key to eliminate a lot of problems you parents if you'll take these scriptures and apply them in your home and watch the friends that your kids associate with you might save them from getting addicted to marijuana you might save them from getting addicted pornography you might spare them of all types of things watch the behavior of your kids when they get a new friend and see if that new friend is affecting them in a negative way now I besee you brethren mark them which cause divisions now gy doesn't just limit this to a preacher so mark them but this is what many people tend to do they tend to shut their eyes yeah I I don't want to see it no no no no I don't want to hear it NOP NOP no no nope nope nope I don't want to see it I don't want to hear it I believe there's good in everybody you've been streaming the smiley preacher from down in Houston Too Much Ain't You yeah he can't even call Gay Sinners he thinks everybody's going to heaven sounds like you need to get off of his website come on somebody Sir Paul said now Brethren mark them which cause divisions so the divisions are those who cause divisions that may be surrendered to separate the people it can be into groups or it can be into clicks or little Clans you know those who calls different groups of people and it becomes a faction and then they will get their own little friends and their own little cliches and it'll happen in the church you know and they've got little certain little things that they do to one another and they'll do it in church I see them doing it sometimes and they'll do little things to one another and they'll sit there and giggle at one another I'll put up with it for a while but I'm warning you kids don't try my patience amen this is a house of God it is not a gym it is not a ballroom it's not a ballr it's not a place to play we come here to worship we don't come here to giggle we don't come here to tap one another in the side come on somebody we're not coming here to ride on your Notepad and let your girlfriend see it beside then she writes something else we're here to hear the word of God take heed take warning oh my notice Paul now I pray I know y'all are praying oh God help him help him help him talk fast now Lord talk fast isin't it amazing when I get on these good things how I slow down ain't it amazing it's just awesome the way that works ain't it now see your brother Mark which cause divisions so as I said it doesn't have to be a preacher of course so it will be those that will cause divisions in the body in the government in the government of the body and they will try to divide of course that's the way Satan always does so he said I beseech you Brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses now look at this word I don't if you ever looked at it or not but it's the Greek word scandalon it's where we get our English word Scandal Scandal that's what offenses are stumbling block thing that offense the movable stick or trigger of a trap so then a hunter would set a trap and he would set a stick and then whenever the animal would either come by it or he would get in and take the bait and a string would be attached to the bait and whenever he moves it the stick Falls and the door closes behind him and now he's caught do you understand that's what some people are they're the stick in a trap and they will do their best to coax you into their trap now look just try one little puff just try one little shot one little this or that the other it it'll make you feel so good oh it'll help you it'll do this and that and the other and that friend of yours is nothing but that stick in the door and they're trying to get you to come in and take the bait and then when you grab it the door shuts you ought to see them after I deal with them when they've been on alcohol and drugs and marijuana for years can't even walk can't even several words together you think they ever saw that in the Trap of course not now this is why Paul is saying this in the body not to be a boss not to be somebody all right I'm getting everybody under my thumb don't you understand why preaching like this is so needful for us all it's to spare us of a lot of Heartache it's to spare us of a lot of scandals in our lives I beseech you Brethren Mark Mark remember God put a mark on Cain he's the first one with the mark of the beast so here Paul is telling us mark them mark them why so other people can know that's a troublemaker that is a stick in the trapo I'm going tell you friend some of's going to disagree as far as days from not and I really don't care I think I wish sometimes that them Devils them social media people that come up with social media I wish they had have never done such a thing I believe it's been one of the greatest detriments to humanity that's ever been on the face of the earth I find it so amazing how many country western Stars how many Hollywood stars how many of these rich and famous people will not allow their own children to get on social media I heard of several this week and they said they were not I'm talking about Hollywood people that live and dress and act like Jezebels and everything else but they said they would not allow their children to get on social media because of the impact on their lives and I Lord have mercy and here we got Christians that don't even watch what their children feed on Amen y'all like to send me and Carol to Bora Bora somewhere for a month's vacation oh some of y'all want to send just to Bor Bor that's right across the road over here you know Bor Bor now beseech you Breen mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine not that thus sayith the Lords but the doctrine that ye have learned and this is what you're supposed to do to them what now the question is this do we believe this or do we not now so that'll make them be lost so that'll make them go to hell so they will be ashamed and hopefully repent look at the word avoid and we'll close and y'all say glory to God avoid to turn oneself away to turn away from to keep aloof from one Society oh yes read the last three this is God's government do we want it or not or do we want the soft leoan you will choose after tonight you see that's the thing that always breaks my heart when I have to preach certain elements of Truth Carol can tell you whenever I'm going to preach things or even if I'm going to have to meet with somebody and I've got to deal with them in in certain things of the scripture I get so tore up for days she said what's the matter and I'll tell her I know what I'm going to show them is going to be so straight from the scripture and the message and they'll do one of two things they'll embrace it or they'll walk away from it do you understand when we hear truths we will never be the same again we will embrace it and say thank God for the truth or we'll say I ain't doing it I don't care how much he says he can scream and holler and shout and spit and do whatever he wants to do I ain't doing it that's so sad let's stand together now notice Verse 18 for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly by good fair speaking smooth and plausible address which simulates goodness good words here you go that's what some of these good preachers preach words that are plausible and simulate goodness now listen what Paul says these people that cause offenses by good words and fair speeches blessing Bounty praise fine discourse polished language language art ful adapted to Captivate the hearer I may be known for a lot of things right that won't be one of [Laughter] them so this is what people will do they'll use good words and fair speeches now I want you to notice now who it will deceive and it'll deceive the hearts of the simple not those who really have depth and not those who really look into the word and search the word but the simple many times the simple think they know so much but they don't know enough to check it by the word my for they are such that serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple now I wonder how many if we would know the number from the time this was written in Romans around 55 ad and we bring it down to 2024 how many Christians how many churches how many moms and dads how many young Christians did not apply this in their life and they run across somebody that was telling them good words and telling them plausible words and Artful words that was put together in order to deceive them and pull them away from the teaching of their mom and dad pull them away from the teaching of a church and then when they got out into this depths of sin and they looked back and realized Lord God what am I doing here what happened to me but if they would have judged that friend by the word if they would have judged that preacher by the word or that Deacon or that whoever it is by the word and say they lost 10 15 years of their lives and then they're at the end of it and they're trying to pick up all the broken pieces and bring all the mess of their life listen friends the judgment will declare it You' not believe the people that I meet huh don't get in your mind that I only counsel with people from our church I counsel with people from all kinds of churches message churches and denominational churches and they come to you with the Clutter and the mess of their life and they don't know what to do and you try your best to tell them God have mercy one of the saddest parts of my job is I will sit there and tell them knowing they're not going to do it they will not do it they'll walk right out that door with their mind already made up you think how can people do it how can you do it how can I do it God gives us his government to protect us don't you thank God for youth leaders deacons ministers do you what about you you children don't you thank God for good Godly Parents oh you may disagree with them oh Mom and Daddy won't let me do this they won't let I've got to be in at a certain certain time I've got to do this and that and the other but if you don't now one day you'll grab a hold of your Mom and Daddy's neck and say thank you so much for what you taught me whenever Erica was little I had to set her down several times and tell her look Erica until you get the Holy Ghost I'm going to have to be yours and you ain't going to go along with what I'm going to say but you're going to do it whether you go along with it or not Harry was told by someone not long ago that used to come to our church he came andever was a little boy and there was a bully that came to our church and and this bully got after this little boy and he was throw bricks at him literal bricks and Erica was just a little B old thing she seen it one day

running out of my eyes remembering those words thank you Daddy for telling me the truth I say thank God for every man of God that's burned my heart thank God for every time I've ever got a whooping praise the Lord anybody else here with me thank God for divine government thank God for a prophet that would tell us the truth thank God for evangelists that'll come in here and not choose to preach hard but they'll follow the leading of the Holy Ghost and go right down an Avenue and me as a pastor no they do not even know what they're preaching and they'll uncover things and deal with things and I'll say thank you Lord why it's the government of God moving in his office don't you understand one day this whole body of government will be raptured praise the Lord and we're going to go up and enjoy that great marriage supper of the lamb and then the government of the kingdom of God will come back down on the earth and we will rule and Reign for a thousand years the government will be continued praise God don't you love him praise the Lord let's let's bow our heads if you would praise the Lord how many would say here tonight Lord if there's anything in me that Rebels against your government please take it out of me Lord Lord a deacon may speak to my child a preacher somebody a youth person leader might speak to my child and have to say a little something to them but Lord help me to realize they're doing that because they love them our pastor may have to preach hard the M ministers may have to preach things that really cut our hides Lord Jesus we approach you tonight father I know this is not a sermon that would make a shout we don't really feel like running around the building after a sermon like this but oh Lord God how grateful I am for your government I've watched some of these preachers that have turned and walked away from this great message I see what they become it's like to have no guide no leadership nothing is a boundary to say what's right and wrong and what they used to consider wrong they don't consider wrong anymore so sad oh Jesus I'm grateful tonight for the boundaries of your word I'm so grateful Lord to us we don't look at it as bondage we look at it as protection oh Hallelujah I know the world looks at us and church enti looks at us and says oh them people are so bound behind them walls we're up on top of these walls looking out and said oh we're so protected Behind These Walls and our youths are so protected from so many things behind these walls the door is wide open if we want to walk out we can walk out you don't hold your people with chains of slavery you hold us with bonds of love I could walk out at any time I could walk out it any day as far as my will why on Earth would I want to why on Earth would I want to walk away from this great protection I feel so protected in my little humble spot under the administration of this Prophet I'm not looking for a liberty where I can override what he taught I'm not looking for some uh education some PhD or whatever more that I can feel like I can straighten Paul out I just feel really protected walking in my little spot if I ain't nothing but a tater peeler Tater peelers are pretty important at supper time whatever you want me to be God is exactly what I want to be I do not want to break my ranks if I'm nothing but a tater Peter I don't want to get in my head I'm a general cuz I'll bring my own deaths and the deaths of those that'll follow me help each of us to find our place in the ranks every sister here Lord every brother help them to realize it is not a sign of weakness it is a sign of protection ction it's not a sign of weakness L I even know some preachers in this message and whenever people will ask some questions it's like they cannot hardly stand to say they don't know the answer it's like they have to give an answer whether it's right or wrong I'm so glad I'm just so dumb and so stupid that I can say sometimes I just don't know and I feel so protected Lord oh I know people look at me as an ignoramus that's okay they look M at me as an idiot that's okay let him say whatever oh he won't even say it if you can't find a quote he runs everything through the Bible runs everything through the message yeah they think they're throwing off on me but they're bragging on me to no end they just don't realize it I just feel so protected in behind this word than so was he until the serpent anointed by Satan himself began to raise a question and she didn't have the answer so she stepped out from behind the headship of her husband this is why we're dealing with all we're dealing with today help us Lord God I pray Grant it father thank you Lord thank you Lord oh don't you love him children thank you Lord thank you Lord we worship you
