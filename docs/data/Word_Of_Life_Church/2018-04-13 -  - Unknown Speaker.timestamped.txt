[0:00] you know you have these different views
[0:01] of history and how men look at them you
[0:03] have the first one which is called the
[0:05] cyclic and it's not important that you
[0:07] be able to read these it's okay today
[0:09] but you have this view of history called
[0:12] the cyclic or the cycle view and it's
[0:15] how men treats in philosophy to treat
[0:18] how they look at events or this line of
[0:20] time and how things have taken place and
[0:23] the cyclic view means history's really
[0:26] going nowhere you know it's just the
[0:30] cyclic view says history just goes
[0:32] around and around and around it's all
[0:34] just a big circle history just keeps
[0:36] repeating itself and some of these
[0:38] things are true but it's a Greek view of
[0:40] history to believe you know there's good
[0:42] times and then there's bad times and
[0:45] then there's war then there's peace and
[0:47] there's war then there's peace and good
[0:49] people and bad people then good leaders
[0:51] rays and then bad leaders raised up and
[0:54] and and time is just on this repeating
[0:56] ever ending round about you know life is
[0:59] almost just like a big cycle you just
[1:01] sort of step on the roundabout when
[1:03] you're born and you step off about the
[1:06] same place you stepped on and your life
[1:08] is just a big circle it just goes around
[1:10] and around and around and you know you
[1:12] wake up you're born here you go on that
[1:14] circle you get married and then you know
[1:17] you have children you get a career you
[1:20] get a job you go to college you become
[1:22] successful you build a house and after
[1:24] you build that house you better but you
[1:25] build what you build a bigger house you
[1:27] get a nice car then you get a nicer car
[1:28] than the kids grow up then you go home
[1:30] you go to work you wake up in the
[1:32] morning every single day you put on your
[1:34] work clothes you go to work you do your
[1:36] duties you get home you turn on the TV
[1:38] you turn on a movie you veg out on the
[1:39] entertainment or a ballgame of some kind
[1:41] you say good night to the kids you go to
[1:43] bed then you wake up the next day you
[1:45] put on your work clothes you go to work
[1:47] you can work all day you come home you
[1:48] say hi to the family you watch a movie
[1:50] you veg out on entertainment you watch a
[1:52] ballgame you say good night to the kids
[1:54] and then you go to bed then you wake up
[1:55] the next day you put on your work
[1:57] clothes you go to work you come home and
[1:59] you say hi to your kid you turn on the
[2:00] TV you watch entertainment you watch
[2:02] your ball game you say good night to the
[2:03] kids and then the next day
[2:06] and sane would love to just put you on
[2:09] this roundabout and circle and circle
[2:11] but God said I'm not intended for you to
[2:13] be on a circle but I've got a line of
[2:15] redemption and I want you to step off
[2:18] the roundabout and find your purpose in
[2:21] Jesus Christ there's a purpose while
[2:23] you're here
[2:24] there's a purpose you're a father
[2:25] there's a purpose you're a husband God
[2:27] puts you in this world at a specific
[2:29] time under a specific condition for you
[2:32] to play your part I want to say God
[2:39] don't let me on the roundabout I want to
[2:41] step on the line
[2:42] I'm for you
