[23:28] glad to be in the house of the Lord once
[23:30] again
[23:31] you can be seated this morning a couple
[23:33] of announcements uh first wanted the
[23:36] library wanted to announce for the uh
[23:39] assisted hearing if you needed the
[23:42] assisted hearing they now have these
[23:44] available just kind of like the old
[23:46] church they're a little bit different
[23:48] this is a lanyard that hangs around your
[23:50] neck
[23:51] has a
[23:53] well a little bit difficult has a power
[23:55] button on the very
[23:57] buttons on the side if you have a
[24:00] hearing aid with a t-coil
[24:02] technology
[24:04] this will transfer into your hearing aid
[24:07] so you don't have to wear an earpiece if
[24:09] you have a hearing aid with a t-coil
[24:11] technology now brother Michael Bailey
[24:13] said if you didn't have one he could
[24:15] sell you one for a little bit of a a
[24:17] profit for him there
[24:19] but so if you have that if you don't
[24:21] have the T cool hearing aid you can plug
[24:24] this earpiece into the top of the
[24:27] lanyard and then put the earpiece over
[24:29] your ear and it just covers one of your
[24:31] ears if you'd like both ears they said
[24:34] that you can purchase that separately
[24:35] and it'll come inside both ears but
[24:38] these will be back here in the first
[24:40] vestibule when you go out they're on a
[24:42] charging dock if you need one pick one
[24:44] up after you're done with it take it
[24:46] back set it back on the charging station
[24:47] for the next service when someone picks
[24:50] that up so if you would remember that if
[24:52] you need to you can see where the
[24:54] Michael Bailey after service about that

[1:02:06] this turns today is the Book of Numbers
[1:02:07] if you will
[1:02:09] Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 31 we greet you
[1:02:12] today in the name of the Lord
[1:02:14] it's a privilege for us to be together
[1:02:16] in the house of God and in the presence
[1:02:19] of God
[1:02:21] Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 31 will read
[1:02:25] down through verses 33.
[1:02:28] I'd like to speak to you today on
[1:02:31] whose report
[1:02:33] will you believe
[1:02:36] whose report will you believe
[1:02:40] but the men that went up was him said we
[1:02:43] be not able to go against the people of
[1:02:46] course this is the children of Israel
[1:02:47] that are at the brink of the land and
[1:02:50] God has promised them what he's going to
[1:02:52] do and Moses has sent some spies over
[1:02:55] some had one report some have another
[1:02:57] report listen at these men's report but
[1:03:01] the men that went up with him said we be
[1:03:04] not
[1:03:05] Abel
[1:03:07] to go up against the people
[1:03:10] for they are stronger than we
[1:03:14] and what does that have to do with it
[1:03:16] actually
[1:03:17] nothing does it if you look by faith
[1:03:20] for they are stronger than we and they
[1:03:24] brought up
[1:03:25] an evil report
[1:03:28] of the land which they had surged unto
[1:03:31] the children of Israel saying the lamb
[1:03:33] through which we have gone to search it
[1:03:37] is a land that eat us up the inhabitants
[1:03:41] thereof
[1:03:43] and all the men that we saw in it are
[1:03:47] men of great stature
[1:03:49] now this is not the truth
[1:03:53] this is not
[1:03:54] true
[1:03:56] it is lies
[1:04:01] God said this lamb is a landform of milk
[1:04:03] and honey
[1:04:05] but the way they saw it it looked like
[1:04:07] the lamb was devouring the people how
[1:04:10] foolish
[1:04:12] isn't it amazing how we look at things
[1:04:14] it's not even true
[1:04:16] and they said all the people they saw
[1:04:18] were giants that's not true either
[1:04:21] there was only a few Giants
[1:04:24] in this land
[1:04:25] I wonder how many of us have believed
[1:04:27] lies of the devil just like this and
[1:04:29] confessed it to
[1:04:31] it is a land that eat itself the
[1:04:33] inhabitants thereof and all the people
[1:04:35] that we saw in it are men of great
[1:04:37] stature
[1:04:38] and there we saw the Giants the sons of
[1:04:40] anak which come of the Giants
[1:04:43] we were in our own sight
[1:04:47] as grasshoppers
[1:04:49] and so we were in their sight another
[1:04:53] lie
[1:04:55] so what did they do go up and ask them
[1:04:59] so how do I look in your sight like a
[1:05:01] grasshopper right so they're speaking on
[1:05:03] behalf of the sons of anak and these big
[1:05:06] cowards for the most part probably never
[1:05:08] even spoke to one of them
[1:05:10] so here they are telling lies
[1:05:13] to the people of God
[1:05:16] about their inheritance
[1:05:19] oh my goodness
[1:05:21] how many lots of be remembered today as
[1:05:23] we pray
[1:05:24] God bless you Mrs power hits together
[1:05:28] and only father it's such a wonderful
[1:05:30] privilege to be together today in your
[1:05:33] presence
[1:05:34] knowing father that as a one-time we as
[1:05:38] Gentiles were not even allowed into your
[1:05:42] presence
[1:05:43] only the outer Court was as far as we
[1:05:47] could go
[1:05:48] but today by your grace and mercy we
[1:05:52] stand here and knowing the Living God
[1:05:56] inhabits our bodies and for that we are
[1:06:00] so thankful
[1:06:01] I pray you would help us today
[1:06:04] catch our attention catch our thoughts
[1:06:06] our spirit our soul
[1:06:09] Lord God speak to us from your word
[1:06:13] may we see today each of us must believe
[1:06:17] a report
[1:06:19] and whose report will it be I want to
[1:06:22] say before I preach this today
[1:06:25] I want to believe yours
[1:06:28] speak to his father as only you can do
[1:06:30] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:32] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:06:36] turn with me there if you'd like to read
[1:06:38] from your Bible or you can read it from
[1:06:40] the screen of life if you'd like to as
[1:06:41] well
[1:06:43] Numbers Chapter 14 verse 1. now let's
[1:06:47] look at the effect of this evil report
[1:06:49] so these men come back 10 of them and
[1:06:53] they have all these things to say
[1:06:56] and the people hear it and this is the
[1:06:59] effect
[1:07:00] of what these men had to say on the
[1:07:02] people
[1:07:03] and all the congregation lifted up their
[1:07:06] voice and cried
[1:07:08] and the people wept that night after
[1:07:11] what after what I just read to you
[1:07:14] and all the children of Israel all the
[1:07:18] children of Israel
[1:07:20] all the children of Israel murmured
[1:07:24] against Moses
[1:07:25] and against Aaron and the whole
[1:07:28] congregation said unto them would God we
[1:07:32] had died in the land of Egypt
[1:07:35] mama
[1:07:37] or would God we have died in this
[1:07:41] Wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord
[1:07:43] brought us unto this land
[1:07:46] to Fall by the sword
[1:07:49] that our wives and our children should
[1:07:52] be a prey
[1:07:54] were it not better for us to return to
[1:07:57] Egypt and they said one to another let
[1:08:00] us make a captain
[1:08:02] they were tired of a prophet
[1:08:05] so now they wanted a captain
[1:08:08] because they felt like a prophet had
[1:08:10] deceived them
[1:08:11] they felt like a prophet had led them
[1:08:14] into a place to where they're all going
[1:08:16] to lose their lives so they want what
[1:08:20] they want a captain well now they're
[1:08:22] going after the military might and said
[1:08:25] of the power of God and they said one to
[1:08:28] another let us make a captain and let us
[1:08:31] return into Egypt is this not the same
[1:08:35] land that they were beaten is this not
[1:08:38] the same land that they had no freedoms
[1:08:41] they had no rights and they're wanting
[1:08:44] to go back to that Land Based on what
[1:08:47] the evil report of ten Liars
[1:08:53] well praise the Lord ten Liars
[1:08:57] well I I'm out to get them today I've
[1:09:01] got an indictment for every liar that is
[1:09:06] lying to you about your family lying to
[1:09:09] you about your healing lying to you
[1:09:12] about your salvation lying to you about
[1:09:16] your marriage lying to you that you're
[1:09:19] not going in the Rapture I've got an
[1:09:21] indictment for him today and I'm going
[1:09:23] to expose their hide to you to let you
[1:09:27] know they are liars
[1:09:30] and there is no true Center
[1:09:33] now notice in verse 6 and Joshua the son
[1:09:37] of nun and Caleb the son of Jeff funny
[1:09:40] now I preached this to you years ago
[1:09:42] that the word Caleb actually means dog
[1:09:45] and Jeff funny was a killazite which was
[1:09:48] not even a Jew
[1:09:51] but God did not have a special tribe by
[1:09:55] which he would allow Gentiles a 13th
[1:09:59] tribe to join into but we find like this
[1:10:03] Caleb the son of jafani and Ruth the
[1:10:07] moibitis and difference of the Gentiles
[1:10:10] most of them wound up
[1:10:12] in the tribe of Judah Judah means praise
[1:10:17] that's a good tribe for a gentile to be
[1:10:20] into
[1:10:22] I want you to notice now Joshua the son
[1:10:24] of nun and Caleb the son of jafani which
[1:10:27] were of them that searched the land rent
[1:10:30] their clothes and they spake unto the
[1:10:34] company to the children of Israel saying
[1:10:36] the land which we pass through to search
[1:10:38] it is an exceeding good Land wait a
[1:10:42] minute wait a minute wait a minute now
[1:10:43] these other guys said that it was a land
[1:10:45] that ate up the inhabitants thereof in
[1:10:48] other words the people that were there
[1:10:50] were barely surviving they were barely
[1:10:54] hanging on they was just making it from
[1:10:57] one church service to another and just
[1:11:00] raking and scraping a little bite to eat
[1:11:03] that ain't what God Said God said it's a
[1:11:05] land flowing of milk and honey
[1:11:07] God said I'll give you the rain and due
[1:11:10] season God said I'll give you the Dew
[1:11:12] but the way they projected it well how
[1:11:14] is the difference these guys were seeing
[1:11:16] some of the exact same land it depends
[1:11:19] on which eyes you look at it with if you
[1:11:23] look at it through the eyes of the flesh
[1:11:25] you'll see a land that in that the
[1:11:27] inhabitants barely hang on but if you
[1:11:30] look at it through eyes of faith you'll
[1:11:32] see it's a land that flows with milk and
[1:11:34] honey every good thing that we have need
[1:11:37] of will be in this land so I ask you
[1:11:41] today how do you sit some of You
[1:11:44] original people that were here when I
[1:11:46] came here 35 years ago some of y'all
[1:11:49] might remember this sermon title because
[1:11:51] I took this same text over 35 years ago
[1:11:55] and I asked at that time Happy Valley
[1:11:59] Church
[1:12:00] able or not
[1:12:03] able or not well I want to ask you the
[1:12:06] same question today are we able to take
[1:12:10] this land or should we just reside and
[1:12:13] say well we're not powerful enough we
[1:12:16] can't do it we fought so many devils and
[1:12:18] we've lost strength and we've lost
[1:12:20] courage and we can't do it no more and
[1:12:23] we're about ready to get up we are about
[1:12:26] ready when you say we don't include me
[1:12:29] in your affirmation because I've got a
[1:12:33] greater desire this morning than I've
[1:12:34] ever had in my life anybody with me
[1:12:37] today I've got more determination I've
[1:12:40] got more Zeal I've got more spunk if you
[1:12:43] want to put it that way I've got more
[1:12:46] Revelation that I had 35 years ago I'm
[1:12:49] better equipped to meet every devil Out
[1:12:52] of Hell better than I was 35 years ago
[1:12:55] but brother Donnie you're 66 I don't
[1:12:58] make a bitter difference my wisdom my
[1:13:01] strength my anointing will make up for
[1:13:02] from a lack of strength because I
[1:13:06] believe that we are not on the verge of
[1:13:08] giving up I believe we're on the verge
[1:13:11] of going in we're on the verge of Donnie
[1:13:15] why is the devil fighting us so hard
[1:13:17] it's because he knows we're right on the
[1:13:20] verge of complete Victory will ride on
[1:13:23] the verge of getting everything that God
[1:13:26] has promised for us in his word anybody
[1:13:30] believe it today
[1:13:31] but it's up to you you see whose report
[1:13:35] are you going to believe
[1:13:37] now notice when they speak unto them
[1:13:40] they speak unto all the company their
[1:13:43] children of Israel saying the land which
[1:13:44] we pass through to search it it's an
[1:13:46] exceeding good land if the Lord Delight
[1:13:49] in us and I love the way that he says
[1:13:52] this because when you look at it in the
[1:13:53] Hebrew he says if the Lord continue to
[1:13:57] Delight in us the way he has already
[1:14:00] amen it's not like they're wondering
[1:14:03] well really or wanting but he said it's
[1:14:06] more than likely he's going to continue
[1:14:07] to the way that he has if the Lord
[1:14:10] continue to Delight in us then he will
[1:14:13] bring us into this land and give it to
[1:14:16] us a land which flowest with milk and
[1:14:19] honey only Rebel not ye against the Lord
[1:14:23] neither fear ye the people of the land
[1:14:26] for they are bred for us
[1:14:30] they are how is it that these people on
[1:14:34] the same Commission on the same Journey
[1:14:37] can cease things that are exact opposite
[1:14:39] it would make you think they are
[1:14:42] describing two different lands it's like
[1:14:45] they are describing two different
[1:14:47] locations but it wasn't exactly two
[1:14:50] different lands it was one land from two
[1:14:53] perspectives one land from two different
[1:14:56] sets of eyes well I want to lay the land
[1:14:59] before you today your promised land is
[1:15:02] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:15:05] the message of the hour that's why Satan
[1:15:08] in the last few years has had a bunch of
[1:15:11] spies that come in Among Us and they
[1:15:13] found out this land made them sick to
[1:15:16] their stomach so what did they do they
[1:15:18] left and started making YouTube videos
[1:15:21] and all kinds of Articles of this and
[1:15:24] that and the other why because it was
[1:15:26] too rich for them it was too good for
[1:15:29] them it was two powerful form they
[1:15:32] couldn't take it so it made them sick to
[1:15:35] their stomach I ain't going back no more
[1:15:37] because it made me sick they preached
[1:15:40] Holiness they preach one God they preach
[1:15:43] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:15:45] Jesus they preached an Apostolic Faith
[1:15:48] that's right that's the only kind I know
[1:15:50] I don't want a church entity I don't
[1:15:53] want churchism I want an Apostolic Faith
[1:15:56] that'll heal our sin that'll save our
[1:15:59] lost children that'll fill us with the
[1:16:02] Holy Ghost and will change our bodies
[1:16:04] when we need him
[1:16:07] oh how they must have felt that day
[1:16:10] their defense is departed from them you
[1:16:14] imagine their defense is departed from
[1:16:16] them and the Lord Is With Us fears them
[1:16:21] not
[1:16:22] so if you would have been there now
[1:16:24] thousands of years ago and you were
[1:16:27] sitting there well change the scenario
[1:16:29] it's not Donnie Reagan preaching to you
[1:16:31] this morning but it's the 10 spies on
[1:16:34] one side and Joshua and Caleb on the
[1:16:37] other side and they're putting to you
[1:16:40] the land so which report will you
[1:16:43] believe will you believe that it's
[1:16:45] laodicea it's so dark and so wretched
[1:16:49] nobody can live right in this day it is
[1:16:52] so dreary and we are so sad we're
[1:16:55] fighting more battles than we've ever
[1:16:57] fallen alive I can barely hold my hands
[1:17:00] up I can barely pray I can barely read
[1:17:03] my Bible I can barely have an affection
[1:17:06] when the song leader stands up to be
[1:17:08] able to clap my head I don't feel like
[1:17:11] going to church I don't feel like prayer
[1:17:13] I don't feel like reading my Bible I
[1:17:16] don't feel like saying amen it's all I
[1:17:19] can do to just get there or will you
[1:17:21] believe an another report we are closer
[1:17:24] to the resurrection than any generation
[1:17:27] that's ever walked on the face of the
[1:17:29] Earth as long as there's breaths in your
[1:17:31] son's body There's Hope as long as
[1:17:34] there's breasts in your wife's body
[1:17:36] There's Hope as long as there's breaths
[1:17:39] in your body There's Hope and let me say
[1:17:41] it this way even if they're laying dead
[1:17:43] there's still hope and if you don't
[1:17:45] believe me all you got to do is ask
[1:17:48] Lazarus he was a man that was dead and
[1:17:51] his nose had already fallen in and rigor
[1:17:54] mortis had start to set into his body
[1:17:56] but that didn't make no difference to
[1:17:58] Jesus because Jesus has power beyond
[1:18:02] death hell and the grave he has power
[1:18:05] beyond your doctor's diagnosis he has
[1:18:08] power beyond your MRI he has power
[1:18:12] beyond your CT scan and every other scam
[1:18:15] that you'll ever get I don't care what
[1:18:18] the doctor says there is no hope there
[1:18:21] is no way out that's his report that I
[1:18:25] want to tell you there's another report
[1:18:27] that my Bible tells me by his stripes ye
[1:18:32] are already healed my Bible tells me you
[1:18:36] are more than a conqueror Hallelujah my
[1:18:41] Bible tells me greater is he that is in
[1:18:44] you that he that is in the world who's
[1:18:48] reports
[1:18:50] will you believe
[1:19:00] now naturally I want you to believe this
[1:19:02] one
[1:19:04] but our enemy wants you to believe his
[1:19:09] I can't make you believe this report
[1:19:12] and this is the truth of the other side
[1:19:14] every devil in hell
[1:19:17] cannot make you believe theirs
[1:19:21] you choose to
[1:19:24] so the fault really ain't in the devil
[1:19:27] it's in US
[1:19:30] notice in verse 36
[1:19:33] and the man which Moses sent to search
[1:19:35] the land who returned
[1:19:37] and made all the congregation to murmur
[1:19:41] against him
[1:19:43] by bringing up a slander
[1:19:47] notice this word a slander
[1:19:50] upon the land look at this word slander
[1:19:53] it means Whispering defamation evil
[1:19:56] report
[1:19:58] unfavorable saying so they brought up a
[1:20:02] slander against this lamb even those men
[1:20:06] that did bring up an evil report upon
[1:20:08] the land died by the plague before the
[1:20:12] Lord but Joshua the son of none and
[1:20:15] Caleb the son of jafani which were of
[1:20:18] the men that went to search the land
[1:20:21] lived still well look around it
[1:20:24] spiritually friends those who have
[1:20:26] brought an evil report slander against
[1:20:29] the message slander against God's
[1:20:33] Prophet slander against the men of God
[1:20:36] standing for the truth they have died
[1:20:39] spiritually but you are still alive
[1:20:44] Hallelujah I'm not talking about just in
[1:20:47] your natural body the worst death that
[1:20:49] can ever be is the death of the soul to
[1:20:52] be annihilated from God's presence but
[1:20:54] let me just say this to you today I
[1:20:57] still believe the land is a land Floyd
[1:20:59] with milk and of it I believe I promised
[1:21:03] lamb the message of the our young people
[1:21:04] Satan will do everything he can to pull
[1:21:07] you out of your promised land to tell
[1:21:10] you what it's not for you it's too hard
[1:21:12] you can't live it that's just for old
[1:21:14] people no it ain't just for old people
[1:21:17] it's for teenagers it's for
[1:21:19] eight-year-olds it's for 10 year olds
[1:21:21] it's for everyone that come wants to
[1:21:24] come this way well I'm 80. well good
[1:21:26] that's the age Caleb was whenever he
[1:21:29] went back to obtain his promise so if
[1:21:31] you're good from 8 to 80 and maybe even
[1:21:34] 100 or better if you want to believe and
[1:21:36] trust the Lord God who promised this
[1:21:39] land you can have the benefits of it
[1:21:41] brother you can pack grapes submit
[1:21:43] they're that big around my don't take a
[1:21:46] whole bushel of them to make you enough
[1:21:47] wine to get stimulated all it takes is
[1:21:50] one of them good old Holy Ghost
[1:21:51] old-fashioned grapes and you go to
[1:21:53] squeezing that thing out real good and
[1:21:56] the stimulation of Revelation arises in
[1:21:58] your heart and you speak to that disease
[1:22:01] in your body and say leave me in the
[1:22:04] name of Jesus you speak to that
[1:22:07] addiction you speak to that habit and
[1:22:09] you say I do not belong to you I belong
[1:22:13] to the Lord God and this is my
[1:22:17] inheritance
[1:22:19] yeah
[1:22:22] whose report
[1:22:24] will you believe
[1:22:28] read what's me in first Samuel 17 42.
[1:22:32] and when the Philistine looked about and
[1:22:34] saw David
[1:22:35] he disdained him
[1:22:38] to despise
[1:22:40] holding contempt
[1:22:42] to be vile and worthless
[1:22:47] for he was but of use remember David was
[1:22:51] a teenager
[1:22:53] you mean giant Killers Don't Have To Be
[1:22:55] 50.
[1:22:57] giant Killers don't have to be 80 by
[1:22:59] them Jack they can be teenagers how many
[1:23:03] of you teenagers want to be giant
[1:23:04] Slayers
[1:23:06] amen you don't hide away well brother
[1:23:09] Donnie I'm gonna wait till I'm 40. why
[1:23:11] waste all them Years start swaying them
[1:23:13] now at 10. start slaying them now at 12
[1:23:16] and 13.
[1:23:18] Oh my he was about to use and ready and
[1:23:22] the word ready means red it's the same
[1:23:24] word that Adam comes from the word Adam
[1:23:27] means red so out of the Red Dirt God
[1:23:30] made the man so he was a ready looking
[1:23:34] guy and he was of a fair count in this
[1:23:37] word fair means handsome and beautiful
[1:23:40] so some of you sisters would have
[1:23:42] thought David was the cutest of those
[1:23:44] things you ever saw and you imagine no
[1:23:47] one ever Goliath saw him he was not
[1:23:49] looking for someone cute he wasn't
[1:23:51] looking for someone that was handsome
[1:23:54] but it looked even less inferior because
[1:23:57] he had no Battle Scars he had nothing on
[1:24:00] his hands nothing on his arms nothing
[1:24:02] anywhere else because he'd never quite
[1:24:05] fought a man of this size before now
[1:24:08] notice I'm the Philistine this is his
[1:24:11] affirmation this is the Philistines
[1:24:14] report and the Philistine said unto
[1:24:17] David and eye a dog which is the same
[1:24:21] word Caleb am I a Caleb that thou comest
[1:24:25] to me were staves and the Philistine
[1:24:28] curse David by his Gods poor fellow I
[1:24:31] was a trinitarian wasn't him so he
[1:24:34] cursed David by his gods and the
[1:24:37] Philistines said to David notice the
[1:24:40] report
[1:24:41] and he believes this brother die with
[1:24:43] everything that's in him the Philistine
[1:24:46] said to David come to me and I will give
[1:24:50] thy flesh
[1:24:52] um to the fowls of the air and to the
[1:24:55] Beast of the field this was Goliath's
[1:24:58] confession
[1:25:00] now David hears this confession and in
[1:25:04] reality it looks like it could very well
[1:25:07] happen
[1:25:08] this man stands according to the
[1:25:11] proportion of size they say around nine
[1:25:14] foot nine inches tall without one piece
[1:25:18] of armor on he would have weighed
[1:25:20] approximately
[1:25:22] 765 pounds with his mail on which was
[1:25:26] his mental part up here and his Grieves
[1:25:29] on it would have weighed on an average
[1:25:31] of another 120 pounds
[1:25:35] with his spear with his helmet with his
[1:25:39] shield with his sword he would have
[1:25:42] reigned around 900 pounds
[1:25:46] and David Wade won 10.
[1:25:51] but it's still not fair odds
[1:25:56] a 110 pound teenager against almost a
[1:26:00] thousand pound champion now this is what
[1:26:04] the Bible calls him a champion well I
[1:26:06] don't mind telling you today demons are
[1:26:09] champions but we're more than champions
[1:26:13] they've been fighting this battle my
[1:26:15] hell in the world can you and I uh 20 30
[1:26:17] 40 50 60 70 years old ever meet demons
[1:26:21] that have been doing this for thousands
[1:26:23] of years they have been fighting against
[1:26:26] humanity since the first human being
[1:26:28] come on the earth they are professional
[1:26:31] Liars professional deceivers they are
[1:26:33] professional wrestlers professional
[1:26:35] boxers the professional and everything
[1:26:38] they do and I'm certainly not a
[1:26:40] professional except I am a professional
[1:26:43] devil whipper Hallelujah that's exactly
[1:26:47] right all you say how can you do it you
[1:26:50] ain't old enough that's exactly right
[1:26:51] I'm not old enough but I have the great
[1:26:55] I deny living inside of me amen I have
[1:26:59] the Mighty God who is from eternity to
[1:27:03] Eternity and I'm not going to fight on
[1:27:05] my strength I'm not going to rely upon
[1:27:07] my reason I'm going to rely upon the
[1:27:10] strength of the Lord because David said
[1:27:13] the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not
[1:27:16] want he maketh need to lie down in green
[1:27:19] pasture he lead us me beside the Still
[1:27:22] Water it is him disguiding us today we
[1:27:25] are not on our own church we are not
[1:27:28] under the leadership of some carnal
[1:27:30] fellow that come from Kentucky 35 years
[1:27:33] ago we are under the leadership and the
[1:27:36] headship of the Holy Ghost the same holy
[1:27:39] ghost that baptized the church and Acts
[1:27:42] 2.
[1:27:43] together
[1:27:49] foreign
[1:27:51] then said David
[1:27:55] to the philistine
[1:27:57] thou cometh to me with a sword and with
[1:28:00] a spirit with a shield
[1:28:02] but I come to thee in the name of the
[1:28:04] Lord of hosts
[1:28:06] the god of the armies of Israel whom
[1:28:09] thou Hast
[1:28:11] defied
[1:28:13] I love this word hear of the name besham
[1:28:17] and it means the ineffable
[1:28:20] the ineffable name
[1:28:23] that it was so great
[1:28:25] it could not be pronounced
[1:28:29] I come to you in the name of besham
[1:28:34] the ineffable name
[1:28:36] so your trust is in your seal your trust
[1:28:39] is in your weapons and your armor but my
[1:28:43] trust is in the name
[1:28:46] and he had such confidence in that name
[1:28:48] that he couldn't even pronounce it it
[1:28:49] was so sacred what about you today that
[1:28:52] can say the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:55] Christ not only do you say it but you
[1:28:58] have that same name because you're part
[1:29:00] of him you are his wife and now your
[1:29:03] miserous Jesus watch this in the Paradox
[1:29:06] the prophet says because they seem the
[1:29:08] opposition so great they was afraid to
[1:29:10] meet the challenge of the boasting
[1:29:13] Goliath of the Philistines afraid to
[1:29:15] many another something about the way
[1:29:17] that he phrases this I love it because
[1:29:20] it reminds me of tests and trials and
[1:29:22] diseases and things sometimes that we go
[1:29:25] through and Yuri stands out there and he
[1:29:27] boasts and he brags and he boasts and he
[1:29:30] brag of what he's done and how big he is
[1:29:32] and how puny you are and how small you
[1:29:35] are have you ever noticed the devil when
[1:29:36] you go to messing up and you make a
[1:29:38] mistake and then you come back to God
[1:29:40] and that boasts and Philistine will
[1:29:42] stand right there against you again you
[1:29:45] messed up again didn't you yeah there
[1:29:47] ain't no mercy for you are there yeah
[1:29:49] how come on do you think God will put up
[1:29:51] with you well you might as well just
[1:29:53] turn your back what is that that's a
[1:29:55] boasting for listening trying to talk
[1:29:57] you out of repentance Roofing God wants
[1:29:59] us to walk right before him but even
[1:30:01] when we fall flat on our face it's up to
[1:30:05] you whose report you're going to believe
[1:30:07] the devil when you're falling fire on
[1:30:10] your face the devil will try to come and
[1:30:12] bring you a report there's no way
[1:30:15] there's no help there's no mercy but I
[1:30:17] hear my God say little children I write
[1:30:20] unto you that you're saying not but if
[1:30:22] any man sin we have an advocate with the
[1:30:25] Father which is Jesus Christ the
[1:30:27] righteous which is a perpetuation for
[1:30:29] our sins and not ours only but for the
[1:30:32] sins of the whole world there's Mercy
[1:30:34] for you when you fall there's Grace for
[1:30:37] you when you mess up there's Mercy for
[1:30:39] you to come back to God whose report
[1:30:42] will you believe will you stay on your
[1:30:45] face where you turn and go back to the
[1:30:48] slop of the world or will you come
[1:30:50] crawling back to the cross and say Lord
[1:30:53] God I'm sorry forgive me Lord help me to
[1:30:56] rise up and try one more time I will
[1:31:00] believe that report
[1:31:03] [Applause]
[1:31:10] notice this
[1:31:12] the prophet said there come a little
[1:31:14] stoop
[1:31:16] shouldered
[1:31:17] Ruddy looking fella his mama had baked
[1:31:22] some raisin pies
[1:31:24] and it brought him to give to his
[1:31:25] brothers and while he was Milling around
[1:31:29] now he wasn't over practicing
[1:31:31] swordsmanship he wasn't over by practice
[1:31:34] and how to polish armor he was just kind
[1:31:37] of Milling around
[1:31:38] minded his own business just delivering
[1:31:41] raisin pies the prophet said he was so
[1:31:44] small he was too little to even fight in
[1:31:48] the army
[1:31:50] oh yeah
[1:31:52] oh my hunting these brothers in the camp
[1:31:54] the Philistine walked out and made his
[1:31:57] boat said choose you a man and come over
[1:32:00] here and fight me we won't have any
[1:32:01] Bloodshed between the nation of course
[1:32:03] that's the way the enemy likes to break
[1:32:08] when he thinks he's got the edge on you
[1:32:11] how many has ever been there when he had
[1:32:12] the edge on you oh yeah
[1:32:15] bring him over here then we'll choose
[1:32:18] we'll fight and then if I'll kill him
[1:32:20] you serve us if he kills me we'll serve
[1:32:23] you notice this and watch his faith
[1:32:25] expressed that was Goliath on the other
[1:32:27] side and he stood out there and made his
[1:32:30] boasts many times bigger than David he
[1:32:33] had fingers 14 inches long
[1:32:38] my goodness he was a malmless big fella
[1:32:42] Philistine Giant and you almost David he
[1:32:45] was even too little to be in the army
[1:32:49] too much of a runt
[1:32:52] they couldn't even use him
[1:32:56] is there anything I could do uh maybe
[1:32:58] pack raisin cakes uh you couldn't even
[1:33:01] pack a five gallon bucket of water maybe
[1:33:03] you could bring us a quart at a time
[1:33:05] you're too little to do this and too
[1:33:07] little to that I guarantee one thing
[1:33:09] many of God's Mighty people have been
[1:33:11] looked down on others and called runs
[1:33:13] but yet God took that little run and
[1:33:16] done a great big thing with it amen I
[1:33:18] hope and pray to God there's some little
[1:33:20] runs sitting here today that the world
[1:33:22] say even some of the message folks were
[1:33:24] out here ain't been around long enough
[1:33:25] Hallelujah he can't do this on that and
[1:33:27] the other praise the Lord he's just a
[1:33:29] little bit of a run well I'd rather have
[1:33:31] her be a rent and have a great giant
[1:33:33] face than to be a giant in size and have
[1:33:36] a run face
[1:33:37] well praise the Lord if I've got to be a
[1:33:40] run I've always been run pretty much all
[1:33:42] my life but I'll tell you one thing when
[1:33:44] it comes to Faith I don't want to have
[1:33:46] run faith I'm going to have grunt Faith
[1:33:48] so whenever I start toward the devil he
[1:33:50] starts growing because he says oh no
[1:33:52] here he comes again here he comes again
[1:33:55] that's the kind of child of God that we
[1:33:57] want to produce share a Word of Life
[1:33:59] Church not people that are barely
[1:34:01] hanging on from Sunday to Wednesday and
[1:34:04] Wednesday to Sunday but people that love
[1:34:06] the Lord they pray when they don't feel
[1:34:08] like it they read their Bible when they
[1:34:10] don't feel like it they come to church
[1:34:12] when they don't feel like it why because
[1:34:15] they may look like a run but they've got
[1:34:17] grunt faith and when they speak Satan
[1:34:20] backs up
[1:34:24] all right
[1:34:28] but David now remember
[1:34:31] it was revealed
[1:34:35] to David
[1:34:37] hey so here's the armies of the Living
[1:34:39] God standing in their own land and
[1:34:41] there's a boast in uncircumcised
[1:34:43] Philistine out there

[1:34:48] cancer
[1:34:52] we'll call him paralytic
[1:34:55] oh

[1:35:24] him not with any kind of a weapon he was
[1:35:26] no match that man's shoulders probably
[1:35:29] 10 12 feet across
[1:35:32] whoa
[1:35:34] his shoulders 10 to 12 feet across

[1:35:45] foot long he could stand right here and
[1:35:47] just behead you all just
[1:35:53] the blade on it may be four foot across
[1:35:56] like a sheet of plywood
[1:36:00] and up comes a little curly headed ready

[1:36:51] uncircumcised for listing in my hand

[1:37:47] nothing but he knew the right person to
[1:37:49] know
[1:37:50] a little Hunchback of a fella he said
[1:37:53] notice the Giant on the other side he
[1:37:55] didn't believe it neither will the come
[1:37:59] just remember you're not trying to
[1:38:01] convince your lymphoma you're not trying
[1:38:03] to convince your concept you want to
[1:38:06] convince you
[1:38:07] and then whenever you stand on God's
[1:38:09] word and speak with the authority of the
[1:38:11] word of God that thing will obey your
[1:38:13] voice whether he believes you or not
[1:38:16] he laughed and said to my dog
[1:38:19] you sent a kid out here to fight me he
[1:38:22] said I'll pick you up on the end of my
[1:38:24] spirit and let the birds eat your flesh
[1:38:26] but you see that didn't shape David at
[1:38:29] all
[1:38:32] now you may not understanding looking at
[1:38:33] him that dude's head will be about this
[1:38:35] big around have eyeballs about like that
[1:38:38] oh my God you imagine it bad his eyes
[1:38:40] had his own personal ceiling fan
[1:38:42] he just cooled himself down just batting
[1:38:44] them eyelashes
[1:38:46] stand right up there with that big broad
[1:38:48] head on the end of that thing four foot
[1:38:49] long and he stood right there he was as
[1:38:52] confident as he could be he done said
[1:38:54] his affirmation I'll feed your body to
[1:38:57] the fowls of the air I'll destroy you
[1:39:00] but David didn't believe what goliath
[1:39:03] said David believed what David said
[1:39:07] I want you to notice it was not the Lord
[1:39:09] God that thundered this out of heaven
[1:39:11] and David is repeating it the Lord God
[1:39:14] gave David a revelation but it wasn't
[1:39:17] enough for the Lord to say it David had
[1:39:20] to say it and David needed to hear David
[1:39:24] say it
[1:39:26] Oh Glory
[1:39:32] so this is David's confession first
[1:39:34] Samuel 17 46.
[1:39:38] this day
[1:39:40] will the Lord deliver thee unto my hand
[1:39:43] and I will smite thee
[1:39:46] and take thine head from thee
[1:39:50] and I will give watch it David watch it
[1:39:53] and I don't get in the flesh I'll give
[1:39:56] the carcasses
[1:39:58] of the host
[1:40:00] Lord have mercy
[1:40:03] he's got beside himself now now it's not
[1:40:05] just challenging Goliath but he goes to
[1:40:08] stepfather and said not only you not
[1:40:10] only you I'll give the whole bunch of
[1:40:13] you
[1:40:16] wow all right
[1:40:18] you imagine I'm saying Mercy
[1:40:21] fat poor little guy
[1:40:23] man what it's it's child cruelty it's
[1:40:27] child cruelty for them to send that
[1:40:29] little fat out there look at him the
[1:40:32] poor little fellow look at him he is so
[1:40:33] he's caught up you imagine David but now
[1:40:36] he's glory to God hallelujah he's a
[1:40:40] probably a worshiping or jerking around
[1:40:41] there and wiping the sweating hallelujah
[1:40:44] thank you Lord God thank you Lord God I
[1:40:46] don't know I believe in words Lord I've
[1:40:48] slayed a whole bunch of them I'll say
[1:40:50] the whole bunch of them
[1:40:55] of course his brothers are oh dear God
[1:41:01] anybody know who's this guy is I've
[1:41:04] never seen the boy in my life
[1:41:06] I don't have a clue no doubt from some
[1:41:08] Holy Roller family some bunch of
[1:41:11] Pentecostals come into the message and
[1:41:12] won't believe nothing another oh my so
[1:41:15] disobedient don't even obey what we tell
[1:41:17] them to do who in the world would think
[1:41:20] this little fellow could stand out there
[1:41:21] but you imagine the Heavenly Host as a
[1:41:24] host of God's angels to standing there
[1:41:26] right on the edge of Eternity and they
[1:41:29] was looking down in the valley of elah
[1:41:31] and there they were this gigantic man
[1:41:34] and a little bitty shrimp of a fella
[1:41:36] scrawny little Hunchback bent over God
[1:41:38] but he was saying God's word he was
[1:41:41] saying what God had anointed him to say
[1:41:43] that was no Pastor there to encourage
[1:41:46] him there was no mama to encourage you
[1:41:48] there was no Deacon there was no use
[1:41:51] leader to encourage David but David had
[1:41:54] a revelation from God
[1:41:58] foreign
[1:42:04] are you gonna believe David
[1:42:09] I will give the carcasses of the host
[1:42:12] of the Philistines this day unto the
[1:42:14] fowls of the air yeah right
[1:42:18] and to the wild beast of the earth that
[1:42:20] all the ice
[1:42:22] may know
[1:42:24] not that I'm a great fella I'm a mighty
[1:42:26] warrior I'm this I'm that but that they
[1:42:29] may know there is a God in Israel
[1:42:33] and all this assembly shall know that
[1:42:35] the Lord saveth not with a sword of
[1:42:37] spear
[1:42:38] for the battle is the Lord's
[1:42:40] and he will give you
[1:42:43] into our hands
[1:42:46] speak that to your disease
[1:42:49] speak that to your blood pressure
[1:42:52] speak that to your your eyesight
[1:42:57] Hallelujah
[1:43:02] and it came to pass on the Philistine of
[1:43:04] rose
[1:43:05] came and Drew near do now to meet David
[1:43:09] that David hasted
[1:43:12] and ran
[1:43:14] you've got to be kidding me
[1:43:17] I mean here's this gigantic man that
[1:43:19] wasted nearly a ton a half a ton and
[1:43:21] he's got all this this equipment for him
[1:43:23] and David ain't just wait a minute wait
[1:43:25] a minute wait a minute let me have a
[1:43:27] little wisdom let me use a little wisdom
[1:43:28] I'll come back in about 13 years after
[1:43:31] I've learned a little more on how to
[1:43:32] handle the word I'll come back I need to
[1:43:34] fast and pray over this I'm sorry I I
[1:43:36] got ahead of myself I need a fast in
[1:43:38] prayer but instead of doing that David
[1:43:39] kind of girded up himself and said come
[1:43:41] on big boy you ready for it come on come
[1:43:43] on I can't wait to tear into you you
[1:43:47] imagine his brothers and all the rest of
[1:43:48] them said Lord God have mercy how could
[1:43:51] you ever take down a man like that and
[1:43:53] David said Lord God how could you ever
[1:43:55] miss a Target that big
[1:43:56] hallelujah how in the world can you not
[1:43:59] do it when you're anointed you imagine
[1:44:01] the host of eight
[1:44:03] were gathered around that teenager
[1:44:14] the prophet said that little old boy
[1:44:16] weighed about 110 pounds scrawny
[1:44:19] draw it in little fella
[1:44:22] maybe didn't get too much to eat on the
[1:44:24] back side of the desert but he stayed
[1:44:27] with God
[1:44:28] that's the main thing
[1:44:31] Here Come Little David just a bouncing
[1:44:34] in the spirit
[1:44:35] hahaha what a Holy Roller Victory
[1:44:38] already Hallelujah why place the name of
[1:44:42] the Lord God of Israel before him all
[1:44:44] devils in hell
[1:44:47] my friends he wasn't just facing the
[1:44:49] Army the first thing all the devils in
[1:44:53] hell
[1:44:54] against one teenager
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:45:00] all the devils in hell
[1:45:02] couldn't wait across that little David
[1:45:06] dancing in the spirit
[1:45:09] you mean dancing before the battles won
[1:45:15] my goodness dancing and worshiping he
[1:45:19] had even won the battle yet but faith
[1:45:21] says it's dead go ahead and dance a
[1:45:23] little bit
[1:45:24] oh David just a dancing in the spirit
[1:45:28] brother man gets pretty excited on this
[1:45:29] you haven't heard it all Glory
[1:45:31] Hallelujah
[1:45:33] David put his hand
[1:45:36] in his bag in this case
[1:45:45] you see this little Stone right here
[1:45:49] just happens to come from the same
[1:45:51] Valley
[1:45:52] that David was in
[1:45:54] the valley of elah
[1:45:58] I stood there a few years ago
[1:46:00] so I loaded up my little bag full
[1:46:05] just a smooth Stone
[1:46:08] washed coming from the rivers and the
[1:46:11] creeks and all you stand down in that
[1:46:12] place that's just a little dried up a
[1:46:14] branch of a thing where water comes
[1:46:16] whenever the water rains and comes off
[1:46:19] the mountains
[1:46:20] so David reaches down and he picks up f
[1:46:23] a i t h j e s u s g r a c e and he picks
[1:46:31] them up and puts him in his pocket and
[1:46:32] said just in case I Ever Need a Little
[1:46:35] Faith in Jesus to provide the grace I
[1:46:37] need to take the head off of a big giant
[1:46:40] I've got five right here but remember he
[1:46:43] was prophesying because Goliath had four
[1:46:46] more Brothers
[1:46:48] hallelujah hallelujah David wasn't just
[1:46:51] getting one for old Goliath but he's
[1:46:53] getting the rest of his brothers too you
[1:46:55] boys have crossed the wrong one now can
[1:46:57] you imagine this giant had stood down
[1:46:59] their day after day after day and made
[1:47:02] his boasts and they believed his report
[1:47:05] and they shook every time he got up but
[1:47:09] this time that brag fell on the ears of
[1:47:12] the right guy
[1:47:13] the wrong guy for Goliath but the right
[1:47:17] guy for Israel is there anybody in this
[1:47:20] place this morning that this message is
[1:47:23] going to fall on the right ears yes I
[1:47:26] claim my healing yes I claim my
[1:47:29] Deliverance
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:40] David put his hand
[1:47:43] don't get nervous now I ain't gonna hit
[1:47:44] nobody but this
[1:47:48] and took fence a stone
[1:47:51] and slightly
[1:48:00] and smote the Philistine and the
[1:48:02] forehead
[1:48:03] that the stone sunk
[1:48:08] into his forehead
[1:48:12] and he fell
[1:48:14] upon his
[1:48:17] face
[1:48:19] now wait a minute
[1:48:21] a stone
[1:48:23] moving a thousand miles
[1:48:26] per second
[1:48:29] there's no way
[1:48:31] he should fall forward
[1:48:34] your brother said huh no whenever you
[1:48:36] hit a hit an animal and you hit it good
[1:48:38] enough and it'll jump and sometimes
[1:48:40] it'll do this why it's a velocity coming
[1:48:42] out of that gun and whenever it releases
[1:48:45] that bullet according to the foot pounds
[1:48:46] that it has inside of that and the force
[1:48:49] of that just knocks that thing backwards
[1:48:51] that way how is it that a force like
[1:48:54] this hit him in the forehead and instead
[1:48:57] of him going like this what you would
[1:48:58] normally think instead of him going that
[1:49:01] way he goes this way
[1:49:05] huh
[1:49:06] why God wanted to make him bow
[1:49:14] God wanted to make all glory to God I
[1:49:19] can't wait for the time when gas vows to
[1:49:22] the bride I can't wait for the time when
[1:49:25] cancer and sickness and disease of
[1:49:28] people that we are praying for will bow
[1:49:31] and say there is a mighty God among them
[1:49:34] people there is a savior among them
[1:49:37] people God didn't want him to fall
[1:49:39] backwards but Face Forward
[1:49:45] foreign
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:56] the prophet sat there he went up there
[1:49:58] just dancing in the spirit
[1:50:00] as hard as he could Why by faith he saw
[1:50:03] the victory
[1:50:04] he saw the victory he took his little
[1:50:06] sling and one of these stones and
[1:50:10] give a dance
[1:50:13] so he dances a little bit foreign
[1:50:18] yes I'm in the spirit I'm anointed to
[1:50:21] preach
[1:50:22] he said Lord have mercy I'm scared I'll
[1:50:24] get in the flesh if I do that you're in
[1:50:26] the flesh when you get up of a morning
[1:50:27] you're in the flesh when you drink your
[1:50:29] coffee you're on the flesh when you eat
[1:50:31] your bacon and eggs what are you scared
[1:50:33] the desert I'm more concerned about
[1:50:34] getting out of the Flesh and I am in it
[1:50:37] some of y'all ain't moves about your
[1:50:39] spiritual joints and crack and pop up
[1:50:41] snap crackle pop it's been so long since
[1:50:43] you've worshiped much
[1:50:46] [Applause]
[1:50:53] he took this little old sling in there
[1:50:56] one of these Stones he'd give a dance
[1:50:58] and here he comes coming around oh I see
[1:51:00] Goliath saying ho ho ho
[1:51:06] but if goliathan knew what coming he'd
[1:51:08] been saying no no no no no no
[1:51:10] not ho ho ho ho but you see it depends
[1:51:14] on which report that you believe will it
[1:51:18] be no or will it be whole You've Got to
[1:51:21] Believe setting here this day whose
[1:51:25] report will you believe are we able to
[1:51:29] take this lamb are we able on God's word
[1:51:34] to stand are we able to say Victory by
[1:51:38] the mystery of God ordained in you and
[1:51:41] me
[1:51:44] Hallelujah are we able
[1:51:47] [Applause]
[1:51:58] left-handed Donnie
[1:52:02] he had five stones f-a-i-t-h
[1:52:05] in five fingers
[1:52:07] wrapped
[1:52:10] this string around j-e-s-u-s here he
[1:52:14] comes oh brother look out Goliath you
[1:52:17] got to fall
[1:52:18] and when he set that loose the Holy
[1:52:21] Ghost
[1:52:21] got a hold to that little Stone
[1:52:24] and picked up a speed of about a
[1:52:27] thousand miles
[1:52:34] my brother died
[1:52:36] surely you don't I do
[1:52:40] but there's no way
[1:52:43] scientifically possible that the
[1:52:45] velocity of it I'm interested in science
[1:52:48] I ain't interested in velocity when it
[1:52:51] comes to Faith if my God wants to take
[1:52:54] this one right here this morning and
[1:52:55] make it do the same thing he can do so
[1:52:57] don't you understand you quote the
[1:52:59] quotes you quote the scripture and you
[1:53:02] think they're so little they're in so
[1:53:03] insignificant all you need is the same
[1:53:06] power right here to get behind that
[1:53:09] scripture get behind that quote and look
[1:53:11] how devil here we come
[1:53:14] you ready
[1:53:15] it struck that giant right between the
[1:53:17] face and he fell forward hallelujah oh
[1:53:20] my look it goes on to say talking about
[1:53:22] David he danced up there jumped up on
[1:53:26] him
[1:53:28] I remember David didn't have a sword
[1:53:31] but David Yuri is still dancing whoa I
[1:53:34] believe the report of the Lord I believe
[1:53:38] the reporter of the Lord and he just
[1:53:41] gets right
[1:53:50] and I said it just so happened I ain't
[1:53:53] got no sword
[1:53:54] but Goliath's got a good
[1:53:58] so he reaches down
[1:54:10] in the name
[1:54:15] you cancer I cut your head off
[1:54:24] foreign
[1:54:26] [Applause]
[1:54:31] for the day when the Lord God will drop
[1:54:34] that sword and beheading
[1:54:36] into the hands of our brother Ron
[1:54:38] Spencer and he'll be able to climb up on
[1:54:41] the heads of that devil that devil that
[1:54:44] is tormented him and made him sit day in
[1:54:46] day out that Devil he's battled and be
[1:54:49] able to stand right up and say this day
[1:54:51] I will remove your head how long for the
[1:54:55] day when God will drop it in my little
[1:54:58] daughter's heart and she'll be able to
[1:55:00] climb upon that body of that cancer
[1:55:02] Hallelujah come upon the body of that
[1:55:05] concern say in the name of that Sim I
[1:55:09] beheads hell I'd be held excited
[1:55:15] Hallelujah
[1:55:16] [Applause]
[1:55:28] so David prevailed over the listing
[1:55:31] for The Sewing and with a stone and
[1:55:33] smoked
[1:55:35] the Philistine and slew him
[1:55:39] and everybody said and slew him
[1:55:46] but there was no sword in the hand of
[1:55:48] David
[1:55:49] therefore David ran and stood upon the
[1:55:53] philistine
[1:55:54] and took his sword and Drew it out of
[1:55:56] the sheath thereof
[1:55:58] and slew him
[1:56:00] oh
[1:56:03] I thought he already slew it
[1:56:05] some devils need double slayed
[1:56:15] Hallelujah
[1:56:19] took his sword his sword he said brother
[1:56:23] Tony why don't God always just heal
[1:56:24] people by Divine Healing and miracles
[1:56:26] and totally bypass all the scans and all
[1:56:29] the doctors and all the treatments and
[1:56:31] all that because there's some of these
[1:56:33] Devils God wants scientific pictures to
[1:56:35] prove it was there but it ain't there no
[1:56:38] more so he wants to kill the devil and
[1:56:40] then have a scientific record praise be
[1:56:43] to God well there ain't never been
[1:56:45] nothing like it before why he wants to
[1:56:47] double slam
[1:56:50] before
[1:56:55] cut his head off there with him when the
[1:56:57] Philistines Saul that their champion
[1:57:02] was dead
[1:57:04] they fled
[1:57:11] David believed
[1:57:14] the report
[1:57:16] of the Lord
[1:57:17] brother Josh
[1:57:19] whose report
[1:57:26] whose report
[1:57:28] Brother John
[1:57:29] Brother JD
[1:57:31] who's it for it
[1:57:35] Hallelujah
[1:57:37] Hallelujah
[1:57:39] but the doctor says and the doctor said
[1:57:41] brother Donnie are you going to believe
[1:57:43] that report
[1:57:44] are you going to believe the report by
[1:57:46] his stripes I am healed
[1:57:49] my brother Donna I've been dealing with
[1:57:50] the sadness of a departed loved one I'll
[1:57:52] never get over it I'll never get over to
[1:57:54] you you're going to believe that report
[1:57:55] or are you going to believe the report
[1:57:57] according to the book of Corinthians The
[1:57:59] God Who comforteth us and all of our
[1:58:01] troubles yes I know some of you are
[1:58:03] still dealing with sorrow and all
[1:58:05] because of loved ones has passed in the
[1:58:07] last couple of years but God don't want
[1:58:09] you to live in this life all down God
[1:58:12] don't want you being depressed young
[1:58:13] people God don't want you being sad God
[1:58:16] wants young people that's got joy
[1:58:17] unspeakable and full of Glory God wants
[1:58:20] teenagers God wants young men God wants
[1:58:23] young women that are so full of the
[1:58:25] power of God that when you work on your
[1:58:28] job the people say I don't know what
[1:58:30] they believe I know they're dressed
[1:58:32] funny but I ain't never been around a
[1:58:33] young girl like that in my life why
[1:58:36] God's looking for another David God's
[1:58:39] looking for somebody that'll believe his
[1:58:41] report
[1:58:42] [Applause]
[1:58:48] thank you
[1:58:50] can use another example
[1:58:52] read with me in Nehemiah chapter 4 verse
[1:58:55] 1.
[1:58:56] but it came to pass
[1:58:58] when sent belet heard that we builded
[1:59:00] the wall
[1:59:02] he was Ross and took great indignation
[1:59:05] and mocked the Jews
