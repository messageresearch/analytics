[51:27] that's not a dream that's not a Walt
[51:30] Disney
[51:31] story that's a
[51:34] reality and we'd like to be remembered
[51:36] today as we pray we've got about six
[51:39] prayer claws for a lot of different
[51:42] needs want you to remember them as well
[51:45] let's just talk to him right
[51:47] now Heavenly Father what a great
[51:49] privilege it is for us to be gathered
[51:52] together here again today in your
[51:55] awesome presence
[51:58] knowing that at one time we as
[52:00] Gentiles we were not allowed in the
[52:03] presence of God the outer court is as
[52:06] far as we could get to but today we
[52:10] stand in the presence of the almighty
[52:13] God not only that but many here in this
[52:16] building today have you in their soul
[52:20] and you have sealed their soul to the
[52:22] day of
[52:23] redemption we pray today father as we
[52:25] approach the word that you would help us
[52:29] I need help no doubt more than anyone
[52:32] here for to stand and to try to bring
[52:35] the word of God what an honor yet what a
[52:41] responsibility help me that I'd not say
[52:43] anything would cause anyone to stumble
[52:46] help me that I'd not say anything
[52:49] wrong and yet I
[52:51] know I've been preaching for almost 50
[52:54] years and I've never preached a perfect
[52:56] sermon they've all been flawed and all
[53:00] had their human
[53:02] mistakes but somehow you take those
[53:04] sermons and you change people's lives
[53:08] with
[53:08] them would you do the same today for us
[53:11] Lord
[53:12] Jesus when we leave this place it won't
[53:15] be that we'll give honor credit or
[53:17] praise to any man but we'll give it all
[53:20] to
[53:21] you these prayer calls that I hold in my
[53:24] hand today Father signify by many needs
[53:29] some in the body some in the soul lord
[53:31] you know them all we're just asking you
[53:34] today that you'd be mindful Lord as I
[53:37] stand under your anointing to preach the
[53:39] word May the presence of God go with
[53:42] these claw for those that are sick as
[53:43] soon as they touch their body May that
[53:46] evil leave them open our hearts today to
[53:49] your word
[53:50] father as your servant I'm reporting for
[53:53] duty but I'm not reporting alone
[53:57] an army stands here today and we're
[53:59] reporting together speak to us would you
[54:03] father or it's in the name of the Lord
[54:05] Jesus we ask it
[54:08] amen praise the lord it's awesome to be
[54:12] a child of God isn't it yes turn with me
[54:15] if you would in the Book of Revelation
[54:17] chapter 4 and while you're turning there
[54:19] I have an engagement announcement this
[54:21] morning brother Malachi Spencer and
[54:25] sister Khloe ball
[54:27] got engaged this week and they're
[54:30] planning on a November wedding and we
[54:33] wish to wish them congratulations and
[54:36] the blessings of the Lord on their
[54:44] lives brother Malachi Spencer is uh
[54:48] brother Mark Spencer's dad which makes
[54:50] him brother Ron Spencer's nephew so he's
[54:55] moved here to the church to be a part of
[54:57] our church family so we certainly
[54:59] welcome him on on that aspect too and
[55:01] we're also keeping our eye on him to
[55:03] make sure he takes care of our
[55:06] sister so whenever I met with them a
[55:08] couple weeks ago I told him I said I
[55:10] feel like she's one of my daughters you
[55:12] better take care of her so just a nice
[55:16] little warning that's all it is am
[55:20] amen God bless you let's let's read
[55:23] together Revelation chapter chapter 1:4
[55:27] John to the seven churches which are in
[55:29] Asia Grace be unto you and peace from
[55:34] him which is and which was and which is
[55:37] to come and from the seven spirits which
[55:40] are before his throne and from Jesus
[55:44] Christ who is the faithful witness and
[55:46] the first begotten of the dead and the
[55:49] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[55:54] him that loved us and walk washed us
[55:57] from our own sins in his own blood and
[56:01] has made us Kings and Priests unto God
[56:05] and his father to him be glory and
[56:08] Dominion forever and ever amen
[56:11] Revelation 5 verse
[56:15] 9 and they sung a new song saying Thou
[56:18] Art Worthy to take the book and to open
[56:21] the seals thereof for thou Hast redeemed
[56:25] us to God by thy blood out of every
[56:28] Kindred and tongue and people and nation
[56:33] and that's made us made us we not just
[56:37] invited you didn't come because you
[56:39] wanted to he has made us Kings and
[56:44] Priests and we shall reign on the earth
[56:48] and to the reading of the word the
[56:50] saints of God said amen God bless you
[56:53] you may be
[56:55] seated
[56:58] we have a right to a spiritual
[57:01] priesthood we don't get this right
[57:03] because we were naturally born into it
[57:06] we don't get it because that we live a
[57:08] certain kind of life and we give up this
[57:12] and we trade off sin for this and that
[57:15] but we get it because God himself gave
[57:18] it to us we are called to be a part of
[57:22] the family of God we're not called just
[57:24] to be a part of the saved only but we
[57:29] are called to be a part of a priesthood
[57:32] a priesthood which is given the solemn
[57:35] obligation and
[57:37] responsibility of presenting prayers and
[57:41] praise and sacrificial lives that come
[57:45] to the Lord that is something that every
[57:48] child of God that's filled with the Holy
[57:50] Ghost is called to do not just the
[57:54] preachers not just the ministry but
[57:56] every child of God in this great
[57:59] position of priesthood there are two
[58:02] aspects of things that we'd like to look
[58:03] at today one of them is worship and the
[58:07] other is praise I realize probably most
[58:10] church people um understand an element
[58:13] about worship and praise and they think
[58:15] it pretty much involves either raising
[58:18] their hands or saying certain religious
[58:22] terms and they think that's worship and
[58:24] they think in their mind that church is
[58:28] where worship is supposed to take place
[58:31] part of that is true church is the right
[58:34] place for worship to take place but if
[58:36] that's the only place you worship God
[58:39] you're failing it because worship is
[58:42] supposed to take place in your home
[58:44] worship is supposed to take place in
[58:47] your car on your job whenever you're
[58:50] doing your daytoday activities and if
[58:54] you understand that then you realize you
[58:57] can give him so much more worship and
[59:00] praise than you're doing it right now
[59:02] you think why would I want to well
[59:04] because you were made for that
[59:07] purpose it it it's it's I look at it and
[59:11] I look at it and I study it and I I
[59:12] still can't say that I comprehended that
[59:14] God would condescend himself to a level
[59:18] that he would put himself in need of
[59:22] anything from us I can understand why I
[59:26] need him every day I need him every hour
[59:29] to survive to live but why he would
[59:33] condem sin to such a level and put
[59:36] himself if I can say it this way in a
[59:39] state of
[59:40] vulnerability that if man does not meet
[59:43] God's needs they will not be met we were
[59:48] born that way we are we're totally
[59:51] dependent from the time that we're
[59:53] children the rest of our life we're
[59:56] dependent on others we're dependent on
[59:58] the government for a certain aspect of
[1:00:00] our life and dependent upon people we go
[1:00:03] to church with family members loved ones
[1:00:05] and so on but yet for God the great
[1:00:09] Eternal to condens send and bring
[1:00:12] himself to such a level that he would
[1:00:15] put himself on a basis that if human
[1:00:18] beings don't need these certain needs
[1:00:21] that God has they will not be met even
[1:00:24] cherubim and seraphim and Angelic beings
[1:00:28] can never meet it they praise him they
[1:00:31] love him they adore him they worship him
[1:00:34] but he designated a certain type of
[1:00:36] worship and a certain type of praise you
[1:00:40] understand that the type of Praise that
[1:00:42] we give to God is redemption praise it's
[1:00:46] Redemption worship Angels cannot praise
[1:00:50] God in that state only one who's been
[1:00:54] redeemed we give him saved worship we
[1:00:58] give him bride worship the Angels cannot
[1:01:02] do that those of you that are married
[1:01:04] you know that there is a love that is
[1:01:06] between a man and his wife that the man
[1:01:09] has for her the woman has for him that
[1:01:12] is unlike the love that you have for
[1:01:14] your children unlike the love that you
[1:01:16] have for your grandchildren and your
[1:01:18] mother your father people you go to
[1:01:20] church with it's love but yet it's a
[1:01:23] different type of love and if you have
[1:01:25] the right type of marriage there's
[1:01:27] things that you can share with your
[1:01:29] husband or wife that you cannot share
[1:01:31] with anyone else and there's a
[1:01:34] relationship a companionship a
[1:01:37] compatibility that you have with them
[1:01:39] that no one else has and it's the same
[1:01:42] thing with the Lord Jesus and his bride
[1:01:46] there's a relationship that angels have
[1:01:49] to him that I don't have and there is
[1:01:52] one that I have that Angels do not
[1:01:56] understand and we've done looked at it
[1:01:58] in the scripture in the book of Peter
[1:01:59] how that the Angels desire to look into
[1:02:02] which means to stand over and to peer
[1:02:06] and to look into it in a very suspicious
[1:02:09] and curious way because they simply do
[1:02:13] not understand it they watch how God
[1:02:15] looks at us and they watch his Mercy
[1:02:18] being extended to us day after day and
[1:02:21] they watch how little we give him back
[1:02:24] and they are so curious as to how his
[1:02:27] Mercy would continuously be extended to
[1:02:31] us even though they themselves know we
[1:02:34] are not even worthy of it we don't
[1:02:36] deserve it and he gives it to us day
[1:02:39] after day after day don't that make you
[1:02:42] feel pretty
[1:02:43] small notice that Paul in the book of
[1:02:46] Hebrews chap 13:1 15 says by him
[1:02:49] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[1:02:54] praise to God now listen how how
[1:02:56] frequently continually that is the fruit
[1:03:00] of our lips giving thanks to his name so
[1:03:04] this is one of the things that we are
[1:03:06] called to do now not just things when
[1:03:09] things are going good when your bills
[1:03:11] are paid as would say all your prayers
[1:03:13] are being answered but we're to praise
[1:03:15] God maybe when the bills have not been
[1:03:17] paid yet but you're praising him that
[1:03:20] they're going to be you're praising him
[1:03:22] not only when things are going good but
[1:03:24] when things are going bad and you've
[1:03:26] waited and you've prayed for an answer
[1:03:28] and it's not yet come but you're
[1:03:30] praising him that it's going to amen
[1:03:33] notice how the prophet picks this up in
[1:03:35] a message entitled ordination he said I
[1:03:38] think our Expressions that we should
[1:03:42] constantly long to be in worship I
[1:03:46] wonder how many of us feel this way
[1:03:48] today that we constantly long to be in
[1:03:53] worship or is there somehow a a
[1:03:57] separation that when we're not in church
[1:04:00] that we don't necessarily think about
[1:04:03] worshipping God because we relate to
[1:04:06] worship as being in a church building or
[1:04:10] a church facility or a church you know
[1:04:13] service whether it be in a pavilion down
[1:04:15] there or wherever it be and you
[1:04:17] automatically think of worship in that
[1:04:21] type of setting alone so when I read and
[1:04:24] study along these lines it helps me to
[1:04:27] realize that as the people of God we are
[1:04:30] missing so much of what we're called to
[1:04:33] be in our priesthood truly there's no
[1:04:37] other place that we can praise him like
[1:04:39] we can here together but on the
[1:04:41] retrospect of looking at that on the
[1:04:43] other side there's something about you
[1:04:46] praising God when there's no one there
[1:04:49] but you that you can love him in such a
[1:04:52] way and just tell him how you feel and
[1:04:55] you know even misunderstandings and
[1:04:57] misgivings that you have and when you
[1:04:59] don't know how to even pray we'll get to
[1:05:02] it but Lord willing I I'd like to to
[1:05:05] help you to understand that in the Book
[1:05:07] of Romans that Paul broke into an
[1:05:10] element even of prayer that was more
[1:05:14] than the articulation of saying words I
[1:05:17] don't know if you've ever been there or
[1:05:19] not but there is a place that you pray
[1:05:22] in God that you actually don't say
[1:05:27] anything now we think in our mind that
[1:05:29] we know how to pray and we know what
[1:05:32] should be said not always and Paul
[1:05:35] described that in the Book of Romans
[1:05:37] that there was times when we enter into
[1:05:40] prayer that we can't even utter what
[1:05:44] needs to be said yeah so if I can't
[1:05:47] speak it how can I know what to pray
[1:05:51] well Paul went on to describe this and
[1:05:53] he said it was with groaning
[1:05:56] that you cannot even talk about and that
[1:05:59] Greek word there is articulate which
[1:06:01] means you don't have the knowledge to be
[1:06:04] able to express the proper
[1:06:07] words so you go into it in prayer and
[1:06:10] then you find yourself moving deeper and
[1:06:13] deeper into the presence of God and
[1:06:16] before long you stop talking and you
[1:06:18] just
[1:06:20] groan
[1:06:22] oh
[1:06:24] oh
[1:06:28] oh why you said Brother Don that's crazy
[1:06:31] it's not crazy it's
[1:06:35] Bible and I can see from the looks on
[1:06:37] some of your faces you've never been
[1:06:41] there you've never been in that channel
[1:06:44] to where the spirit of God uses your
[1:06:48] mouths but not in words but you begin to
[1:06:52] grown you say well how can he understand
[1:06:54] he understand the groanings of the
[1:06:57] spirit for it's no longer you that's
[1:07:00] praying but the spirit of God inside of
[1:07:03] you anybody ever been there you know
[1:07:05] what I'm talking about some of you I
[1:07:06] know you do you're shaking your head and
[1:07:07] you've been there well you didn't even
[1:07:09] know how to pray and yet the spirit of
[1:07:11] God in you would start groaning without
[1:07:14] the articulation of words and it would
[1:07:17] groan in that realm and you understand
[1:07:20] what's being done your words and the
[1:07:22] intent of your heart is being masked ask
[1:07:26] from Satan and Satan and you understand
[1:07:28] when you get down to pray now God I'm
[1:07:30] going to church today and brother Donnie
[1:07:32] don't speak something that's going to
[1:07:33] help me I ain't going back no more you
[1:07:35] just set yourself a big trap for the
[1:07:38] Devil the devil's going to do everything
[1:07:40] he can to keep you from get anything out
[1:07:42] of that service that's why the prophet
[1:07:44] said even whenever he was praying they
[1:07:47] asked him the question you told us why
[1:07:48] you went to Tucson in the beginning now
[1:07:51] you've gone back again and you haven't
[1:07:53] told us and give us the explanation and
[1:07:54] said well it's a secret in my heart and
[1:07:57] he said as long as it's in my heart the
[1:07:59] devil don't know what it is but if I
[1:08:02] speak it Satan will hear it and try to
[1:08:05] mess up the plan of God there's
[1:08:07] sometimes when we pray we don't even
[1:08:09] need to tell exactly how we feel we need
[1:08:13] to get along with God and let the spirit
[1:08:16] in us go to praying out of us and you've
[1:08:18] got a direct line and the devil don't
[1:08:21] even understand what you're saying come
[1:08:24] on somebody now when you enter into that
[1:08:27] sphere also with that will come this
[1:08:30] element of worship and this element of
[1:08:33] Praise now we realize many many people
[1:08:35] have gathered in the Tri Cities today
[1:08:37] and no doubt they've praised and they've
[1:08:39] loved the Lord and do many of them love
[1:08:41] him yes they do they do love the Lord
[1:08:44] with everything they know to love with
[1:08:47] they will worship Him and they will give
[1:08:49] him will it be accepted brother Donnie
[1:08:52] well that's up to the Lord Jesus what he
[1:08:54] accepts at any up to me and it ain't up
[1:08:57] to you it's up to him to accept what he
[1:09:00] will but this helps me to see that as
[1:09:03] the prophet said I think our Expressions
[1:09:06] that we should constantly long to be in
[1:09:08] worship anywhere to Worship the Lord
[1:09:12] when we come together to worship Him
[1:09:14] worship Him at home worship him while
[1:09:17] you're driving our cars whenever
[1:09:21] wherever we are Worship the Lord just
[1:09:24] think that the Bible said let everything
[1:09:26] that has breath praise the Lord again he
[1:09:30] says Oh How He Loves to be
[1:09:34] worshiped I don't know if you've ever
[1:09:36] done a study in this way or not but if
[1:09:38] you do it through the Bible and do it
[1:09:40] through the message it's absolutely
[1:09:42] amazing whenever you go to Stud I'm
[1:09:44] going to warn you before I do it
[1:09:46] there'll be hundreds and hundreds of
[1:09:47] things you'll have to look at but to
[1:09:49] find the things that God actually loves
[1:09:53] now God's unlike us God doesn't love
[1:09:55] cars God doesn't love airplanes God
[1:09:58] doesn't love all kinds of things that we
[1:10:01] love and when you go to honing it down
[1:10:03] and really looking at it it's very very
[1:10:06] minimum that I begin to find personally
[1:10:08] of the things that God actually loves
[1:10:11] but what he does love he loves with such
[1:10:15] passion he loves with everything that he
[1:10:19] is now this is one of the things that
[1:10:22] God really loves he loves to to be
[1:10:25] worshiped but you understand what that
[1:10:27] does then when God loves this it brings
[1:10:31] him to that spot that I spoke about a
[1:10:33] while ago of vulnerability now in order
[1:10:36] to be worshiped you have to have
[1:10:39] something less than you you have to have
[1:10:42] something inferior to you to be able to
[1:10:46] worship you because a greater is
[1:10:49] certainly not going to be able to
[1:10:50] worship a greater so you have to have
[1:10:53] something less than the person or the
[1:10:56] being desired to be worshiped and they
[1:10:58] will come and bows and humble themselves
[1:11:02] into the presence of this Superior one
[1:11:04] and they will say I worship you I adore
[1:11:07] you I love you I give you my all so that
[1:11:10] means that God in order to be worshiped
[1:11:13] must bring himself to a level of
[1:11:16] condens to where he will depend upon
[1:11:20] beings that are so weak and so frail and
[1:11:25] so feeble that at times they're not sure
[1:11:28] that they can put one foot in front of
[1:11:30] the other and yet he lowers himself to
[1:11:34] that type of creatures depending on
[1:11:39] them for what he
[1:11:45] loves only
[1:11:47] God could do such a
[1:11:51] thing notice how he loves to be
[1:11:53] worshiped he loves loves you prais be
[1:11:57] his name you ought to believe him right
[1:11:59] now every one of you have faith and
[1:12:01] believe again he says oh my how people
[1:12:05] ought to worship him just give him
[1:12:07] praise and glory he
[1:12:10] loves to be worshiped now remember this
[1:12:14] is not something that he can do on his
[1:12:17] own so he wanted to expand himself he
[1:12:21] wanted to extend himself beyond the of
[1:12:26] Eternity and he thought of himself as
[1:12:28] being a human being he thought of
[1:12:32] himself of being in a tangible seeable
[1:12:36] form so he could do that and that was an
[1:12:39] act of condensation still is not
[1:12:42] dependent on anyone yet because then he
[1:12:45] could expand his Heavenly creation and
[1:12:48] start it bringing into molecules and
[1:12:50] light meters and things like that but he
[1:12:53] still not brought himself to where is
[1:12:55] dependent anybody understand what I'm
[1:12:57] saying this morning you know there's
[1:12:58] that element about each of us every one
[1:13:01] of our human relationships that are
[1:13:04] intertwined with other people with every
[1:13:07] person that you and I build a
[1:13:09] relationship a friendship whether it's
[1:13:12] people that you work with people you go
[1:13:13] to church with we become more vulnerable
[1:13:17] with each human being that we extend a
[1:13:20] relationship you follow me because the
[1:13:23] more we love them and the more we can
[1:13:25] defi in them and Trust in them the more
[1:13:27] vulnerable we become because you open
[1:13:30] yourself to people and you tell them
[1:13:32] secret things about yourself you're
[1:13:34] opening yourself up to the trust of that
[1:13:37] individual they may turn their back on
[1:13:39] you they may tell your deepest secrets
[1:13:41] and you are making yourself very
[1:13:43] vulnerable anybody here got hurt by
[1:13:46] doing that before of course we all have
[1:13:48] so we open oursel when you marry a man
[1:13:51] when you marry a woman you brothers and
[1:13:53] you sisters marry a man
[1:13:55] you you don't you don't have the ability
[1:13:57] to look into the future that man may
[1:13:59] love you for 20 years or 30 then he may
[1:14:01] turn against you he may hate you he may
[1:14:04] take another woman into his Embrace and
[1:14:07] absolutely destroy your life no way to
[1:14:10] know it no way for you parents to know
[1:14:12] the children that you're going to bring
[1:14:13] into the Earth that one day they may
[1:14:16] turn your world upside down you gave
[1:14:19] them so much and you sacrificed so much
[1:14:23] for your children and then they turn
[1:14:25] turn against you they turn against what
[1:14:27] you believe no way for you to know that
[1:14:30] unlike us God knew by making himself
[1:14:34] vulnerable he knew there would be many
[1:14:37] days and many nights he would long for
[1:14:41] worship and he knew many of those that
[1:14:44] he loves so much and those that he has
[1:14:48] redeemed they would go day in and day
[1:14:51] out they would praise him on Sunday
[1:14:53] morning they would praise him on
[1:14:55] Wednesday night but they never really
[1:14:57] even related to praising him on Monday
[1:15:00] or Tuesday and they didn't think about
[1:15:02] praising him on Wednesday morning they
[1:15:04] just more or less were programmed to do
[1:15:06] it on Wednesday night when they come and
[1:15:08] found their spot in the
[1:15:10] church he knew that they would get so
[1:15:13] many of blessings from his mighty hand
[1:15:15] and never even stopped to thank him I
[1:15:18] find it amazing that some Christians
[1:15:20] don't even bow their heads over their
[1:15:23] food and thank God for it I I don't
[1:15:25] understand that myself I just I I cannot
[1:15:28] relate to that I understand that some
[1:15:30] people and I told the young people here
[1:15:32] Thursday night that some people want to
[1:15:34] find the boundaries in God they want to
[1:15:37] find What God Says do they want the
[1:15:40] minimum requirement they want the MDR
[1:15:43] the minimum daily requirement of what it
[1:15:46] takes to be bride what it takes to be a
[1:15:48] Christian what it takes to go on the
[1:15:50] Rapture so they just tell me what I have
[1:15:52] to do to get in then they want to get as
[1:15:55] close as they can to walk on that MDR
[1:15:59] that minimum daily requirement and get
[1:16:01] as close to the world as they can and
[1:16:04] still yet be saved now I also want to
[1:16:07] know what I'm required to do but I don't
[1:16:10] want to know what I'm required to do so
[1:16:12] I can get as close to the world as I can
[1:16:15] I want to know what I'm required to do
[1:16:17] and then I want to do above it I don't
[1:16:20] want to do just what I'm required to do
[1:16:22] I want to do that but I want to do more
[1:16:25] I know y'all think I'm crazy and I admit
[1:16:27] that I am but I want to do what he wants
[1:16:29] me to do but then I want to do so much
[1:16:32] more of what he wants me to do that he's
[1:16:34] overwhelmed by how I feel about him now
[1:16:37] I know many many church people they say
[1:16:39] just tell me what I've got to do just to
[1:16:41] get it in minimize it don't complicate
[1:16:43] it for me give me a list a b CDE e f g h
[1:16:46] i j k don't tell me any more than that
[1:16:49] but I believe somebody that really loves
[1:16:51] him whose name is on that Lamb's Book of
[1:16:54] Life they don't want just the MDR but
[1:16:57] they want everything above and beyond if
[1:16:59] he wants me to praise him an hour a day
[1:17:02] I think I'll start out with an hour and
[1:17:03] a half and then work myself up to two
[1:17:06] and then up to three make it unlimited
[1:17:09] come on somebody if he wants me to love
[1:17:11] him if he wants me to praise him I want
[1:17:13] to do that but I want to give him more
[1:17:17] than he even wants me to give
[1:17:19] him why because God loves to be
[1:17:22] worshiped and when I worship him whether
[1:17:26] I'm at church or whether I'm diving down
[1:17:28] the road if I'm in Lowe's or Home Depot
[1:17:30] wherever I am I am actually making the
[1:17:33] Eternal
[1:17:35] happy
[1:17:38] wow it's an awesome thing to be able to
[1:17:40] make someone happy nearly impossible
[1:17:43] with some people of course but to think
[1:17:45] that you could actually make God happy
[1:17:48] and as we can relate to it this way and
[1:17:50] put a smile on his
[1:17:53] face and God would look back down to you
[1:17:57] and say thank
[1:18:00] you you made my
[1:18:05] day wouldn't that be awesome if every
[1:18:07] person under the sound of my voice today
[1:18:10] would leave this building and say by
[1:18:14] God's grace I make it my goal I will
[1:18:18] make him happier than I ever have in my
[1:18:21] life I'm going to praise him at home I'm
[1:18:24] going to praise him on the job I'm going
[1:18:26] to praise him when I'm driving my car
[1:18:28] I'll tell you what it benefit you and
[1:18:30] God a whole lot more if you'd spend more
[1:18:32] time doing that less time on Instagram
[1:18:36] less time on Tik Tok less time on your
[1:18:39] social media come on
[1:18:41] somebody notice now he says in the
[1:18:44] greater witness God is an
[1:18:48] object of worship now remember in the
[1:18:51] realm of Eternity he wasn't even
[1:18:56] God he was what the Jews call him the
[1:19:01] Eternal because God is an object of
[1:19:04] worship and there was nothing or
[1:19:08] anyone to worship him so he became God
[1:19:13] when he created angels now I know it's
[1:19:16] hard for us to imagine but think he was
[1:19:18] this great being before there was light
[1:19:21] molecules atoms time anything like that
[1:19:24] just a great Eternal but he thought
[1:19:27] himself as being
[1:19:30] God I want to be worshiped so then he
[1:19:35] started creating these beings by the
[1:19:39] myriads that he called
[1:19:42] Angels some
[1:19:44] elect some
[1:19:47] non-elect now don't look at me funny
[1:19:50] that's what Paul says Paul said the
[1:19:51] elect Angels so there's some angels that
[1:19:54] were created others rotated if I can say
[1:19:58] it that way off of the Eternal
[1:20:02] himself that was you in
[1:20:05] representation some angels were created
[1:20:07] where they could worship him for a long
[1:20:10] time and then they would make their
[1:20:12] choice to leave him they're what we know
[1:20:15] today as
[1:20:16] demons then they begin to worship and
[1:20:19] praise and I mean they had nothing else
[1:20:21] to do there was no humans on the earth
[1:20:23] the earth wasn't in existence so God
[1:20:26] created them before he created the Earth
[1:20:28] and they worshiped them constantly just
[1:20:31] constantly worshiping him then he wanted
[1:20:33] to expand his creation out into a
[1:20:37] universe as we know it so he started
[1:20:39] speaking let there be let there be now
[1:20:42] remember the Angels actually fell before
[1:20:45] the foundation of the world so Lucifer
[1:20:48] this bright shining Angel which was next
[1:20:51] to Michael Christ then he he decided he
[1:20:56] also wanted to be worshiped now there's
[1:20:59] many difference between him and the
[1:21:01] Eternal but one of the main ones is that
[1:21:04] Lucifer could not create he does not
[1:21:07] have the ability so he could only
[1:21:09] pervert what the Eternal created but he
[1:21:13] still loves worship now I can't
[1:21:15] understand to Satan's mind myself I
[1:21:19] cannot relate to a being that would want
[1:21:23] worship and attention so bad that he
[1:21:26] would take it under the name of another
[1:21:31] person so let me show you what I mean so
[1:21:33] I try to get done preaching today's
[1:21:35] sermon and you were blessed by the
[1:21:36] sermon and then you go up to Brother
[1:21:38] John John Horn and you say brother John
[1:21:41] thank you so much for that sermon today
[1:21:43] thank you so much for all the studying
[1:21:45] you done thank you brother I'm an out
[1:21:48] and people stand around you and you say
[1:21:50] this that are you nuts brother John did
[1:21:52] not Preach Today he prayed brother was
[1:21:54] the one that pray but you see that's
[1:21:56] just the way Satan will take worship now
[1:22:00] he knows that many people would never
[1:22:03] worship him directly most people
[1:22:05] absolutely scared to death if they'd
[1:22:07] walk into a church and see a pentagram
[1:22:09] on the floor they'd see a pentagram on
[1:22:12] one of these screens and they'd see a a
[1:22:13] goat with horns on top of oh Lord have
[1:22:16] mercy devil worship devil worship get
[1:22:18] out of here get out of here well the
[1:22:20] majority of the world is never caught up
[1:22:22] in such but Satan they worship the devil
[1:22:28] ignorantly thinking they're worshiping
[1:22:30] God why teaching for Doctrine the
[1:22:33] Commandments of men so whenever they
[1:22:36] teach for Doctrine the Commandments of
[1:22:38] men the Lord Jesus cannot receive that
[1:22:41] worship so that worship there's another
[1:22:44] being standing over here on the side and
[1:22:46] said I'll take it I'll take it I'll take
[1:22:49] it and Satan actually receives it even
[1:22:53] though they are standing there oh Jesus
[1:22:56] I love you I love you baptizing titles
[1:23:00] deny Malachi 4 or Ephesians 4 you know
[1:23:03] whatever it is that they deny and
[1:23:04] they're offering it up they think in the
[1:23:07] name of the Lord
[1:23:09] Jesus but if it don't come up by the
[1:23:12] Light of the hour and the word of the
[1:23:14] hour he cannot receive it so it goes to
[1:23:17] whom the
[1:23:20] goat I don't want my worship going there
[1:23:22] brother Paul do you anybody here want
[1:23:24] your worship going there I don't think
[1:23:26] so not if ver our right mine and yet
[1:23:29] Satan is the God of this evil age and
[1:23:34] before long he will be crowned by his
[1:23:38] bride right he is the worshiped
[1:23:43] person of this evil age it is him who is
[1:23:48] running the Nations it is him who is the
[1:23:52] god of America America it is him who is
[1:23:56] the god of Europe Asia India
[1:24:01] subcontinent of Africa it is him who is
[1:24:04] the greatest
[1:24:06] worshiped
[1:24:08] person I know it's staggering isn't it
[1:24:11] and God knew when he created this being
[1:24:15] what he would do he knew he would turn
[1:24:18] on God and stab him in the back as we
[1:24:21] would say he knew he would turn against
[1:24:24] him he also knew that he would pull this
[1:24:26] element of angels out from under the
[1:24:29] headship of the word and they would
[1:24:31] follow
[1:24:32] Lucifer so this bright shining Angel
[1:24:37] changed when he looked within himself
[1:24:40] and about himself and he saw his
[1:24:42] Brilliance and his magnificence which
[1:24:45] God gave the to him for God's glory and
[1:24:49] he twisted that in his heart you see
[1:24:52] that's where sin began in the heart
[1:24:55] of Lucifer sin did not begin on the
[1:24:57] earth sin began in heaven right when
[1:25:01] another being desired to be
[1:25:06] worshiped do you understand when you
[1:25:08] make an idol out of your
[1:25:12] body oh my y'all going to get quiet on
[1:25:15] me already if you get any quieter my
[1:25:16] goodness we'll hear a mouse traced
[1:25:18] across the floor won't we do you
[1:25:20] understand in the eight that we're
[1:25:21] living when people are worshiping their
[1:25:25] bodies their image their pride their
[1:25:28] arrogance they're
[1:25:30] worshiping
[1:25:32] themselves so they spend you know all
[1:25:34] this time trying to get rid of wrinkles
[1:25:36] and all this time trying to do this and
[1:25:38] trying to do that all my what that pay
[1:25:41] for a bottle of eternal life today what
[1:25:44] would it be worse why would a bottle of
[1:25:47] eternal life be worth what would a serum
[1:25:49] be worth this morning even some of our
[1:25:52] Christian sisters if they'd be able to
[1:25:54] it on their face and the wrinkles would
[1:25:57] disappear you and I both know a lot of
[1:25:59] that ain't nothing but snake
[1:26:01] oil but yet people spend millions of
[1:26:04] dollars every year on Cosmetics looking
[1:26:07] for as Pon Deon did years ago that
[1:26:10] Fountain of years well I found him I
[1:26:14] said I found him I can tell you where he
[1:26:15] is I can tell you what his name is but
[1:26:18] yet it's the Fallen unregenerate nature
[1:26:22] of man to make a god
[1:26:24] out of himself and then he turns his
[1:26:28] adoration and his love which God made to
[1:26:31] be received by him he turns it toward
[1:26:34] himself and makes an idol out of himself
[1:26:37] and you'll watch him it's it's amazing
[1:26:39] to watch people I'm a people Watcher and
[1:26:41] it's amazing to watch people when they
[1:26:43] get in front of a mirror it's absolutely
[1:26:46] amazing I mean you can watch you know
[1:26:48] you going to Lowe's and they've got
[1:26:49] mirrors for sale or you going to Target
[1:26:52] or wherever it is and you're just
[1:26:53] looking for a mirror for your house or
[1:26:55] whatever and it's amazing to watch
[1:26:57] people whenever they get in front of a
[1:26:59] mirror it's just amazing to watch what
[1:27:01] they do and how they look at thems and
[1:27:05] how they idolize thems you know I mean
[1:27:08] sure comb your hair and take a bath for
[1:27:10] the rest of us if for no other reason
[1:27:12] put on good clothes as you come to the
[1:27:14] house of God but you realize there's an
[1:27:17] element of people in this earth and they
[1:27:20] are worshiping thems and making Idols
[1:27:23] out of themselves
[1:27:24] which means they are devil
[1:27:28] worshippers because they are worshiping
[1:27:30] that which was born between Satan and
[1:27:34] Eve when you worship your body you are
[1:27:38] worshiping the progeny of Satan
[1:27:42] brother oh my goodness well praise the
[1:27:46] Lord now whatever we think then about
[1:27:49] worship God is an object of worship he
[1:27:51] said and God wants to be worshiped in Sp
[1:27:54] and in truth so God just don't want to
[1:27:56] be worshiped but he wants to be
[1:27:58] worshiped a certain way in spirit and in
[1:28:01] truth now the prophet of course told us
[1:28:03] over and over again some people worship
[1:28:05] in truth with no Spirit others Worship
[1:28:09] in spirit but no
[1:28:11] truths what do you all want in our
[1:28:15] church what
[1:28:18] both that's what I want because he won't
[1:28:22] receive it any other way we don't want
[1:28:25] it to be cold we don't want it to be
[1:28:29] formal neither do we want it to be where
[1:28:32] we just scream and holler and shout and
[1:28:35] all that is good it has its place but we
[1:28:38] do not have truth which relegates our
[1:28:41] worship into the presence of God and the
[1:28:45] church
[1:28:46] said now let's go this morning into this
[1:28:49] direction as far as Priests of God and
[1:28:52] remember that we have one high priest
[1:28:54] which is the Lord Jesus I am not a high
[1:28:56] priest no other preacher is a high
[1:28:58] priest we have one high priest all the
[1:29:00] rest of us stand on the same plane and
[1:29:03] level before God now of course we know
[1:29:06] that gifts and callings of God make a
[1:29:08] difference in a person's life but when
[1:29:09] it comes to been saved you're just as
[1:29:11] saved as I am you got just as much Holy
[1:29:13] Ghost as I've got you're just as well
[1:29:16] thought of and loved in heaven is the
[1:29:18] greatest preacher in the message is that
[1:29:20] right but then let me ask you this
[1:29:23] question today what position does Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ truly hold in your life is he
[1:29:33] first second third
[1:29:37] 10th
[1:29:39] 20th
[1:29:40] 25ths
[1:29:43] hundreds what position does he hold now
[1:29:47] what's the prophet and the unwelcome
[1:29:49] Christ he said what part has God has he
[1:29:52] got rather in your life today Christian
[1:29:55] has he got the best part or are you just
[1:29:58] giving him the attic now remember he's
[1:30:02] preaching about Jesus coming to Simon's
[1:30:06] house now remember Simon was a Pharisee
[1:30:10] and he was going to have a great feast
[1:30:12] one day and he invited the Lord
[1:30:16] Jesus he did not invite the
[1:30:20] disciples this is one
[1:30:22] onone public
[1:30:26] humiliation so he invites the Lord Jesus
[1:30:29] and before he gets there he tells his
[1:30:32] footwash
[1:30:34] flunky now that Nazarene preacher guy is
[1:30:38] invited but this is just between me and
[1:30:41] you I'm going to embarrass him today the
[1:30:45] whole invitation is this in mind I'm
[1:30:49] going to humiliate him I'm going to
[1:30:52] embarrass him I'm going to prove to his
[1:30:55] followers and the poor ignorant people
[1:30:57] out there that think he's some kind of
[1:30:59] special person I'm going to prove he is
[1:31:03] not even worthy to be
[1:31:05] acknowledged so when you see him walk in
[1:31:08] the door don't you anoint
[1:31:11] him forbid anyone to kiss him and don't
[1:31:16] you dare wash his
[1:31:19] feet now the ritual was that they would
[1:31:22] walk and they would come
[1:31:24] each one of them present their
[1:31:26] invitation to this
[1:31:28] Feast signed by the man himself the Lord
[1:31:32] Jesus comes gives his invitation then
[1:31:34] they would have couple of different
[1:31:37] people they would have one that would
[1:31:40] anoint you because the Palestinian sun
[1:31:43] was so hot and you were sweaty and you
[1:31:46] would walk and your perspiration your
[1:31:48] body order of course and then they you
[1:31:50] wouldn't feel welcome among the rest of
[1:31:53] the people so have someone to anoint you
[1:31:56] with a a mixture of Frankincense
[1:31:59] Sandalwood Merd some different things
[1:32:01] like that and everybody would smell the
[1:32:03] same they would anoint you and then they
[1:32:07] would take your old shoes off and they
[1:32:10] would have a footwash guy that would set
[1:32:13] there he's the lowest paid guy in the
[1:32:15] whole structure of the household he
[1:32:18] would set you down and they would have a
[1:32:20] room take your old dirty shoes off and
[1:32:24] put your feet down in this pan of water
[1:32:27] and then he would wash your feet so this
[1:32:29] is his job so he washes everybody's feet
[1:32:32] then they would give you according to
[1:32:34] the size of your foot they would give
[1:32:37] you a pair of really nice house shoes so
[1:32:42] then you were anointed and whenever they
[1:32:44] did that then you would stand up then it
[1:32:47] was a signal to the man throwing the
[1:32:49] party that you had come through this
[1:32:52] process then he would come and embrace
[1:32:55] you he would kiss you on one side of the
[1:32:57] neck turn kiss you on the other side of
[1:32:59] the neck then he would embrace you you
[1:33:01] would Embrace him and you were welcome
[1:33:05] then you could go in and start mangling
[1:33:08] around with some people hey there dror
[1:33:10] so and so brother so and so how are you
[1:33:12] and they would come up to you and they
[1:33:14] would smell of you and they would they
[1:33:16] knew that you would come to the
[1:33:20] process so Jesus walks in nobody greets
[1:33:26] him nobody kisses
[1:33:29] him nobody anoints
[1:33:33] him now remember Jesus was so much a man
[1:33:38] that Jesus could feel
[1:33:40] embarrassment yeah as a matter of fact
[1:33:42] the prophet said that on one occasion
[1:33:43] whenever they spoke to him that jesus'
[1:33:45] face actually turned red and it
[1:33:49] embarrassed him he had to understand how
[1:33:52] his bride is going to feel when she
[1:33:54] feels humiliated being laughed at
[1:33:57] because she dresses a certain way and
[1:33:59] acts a certain way so he didn't just
[1:34:02] bear your sin he bore
[1:34:06] embarrassment so he comes in and they
[1:34:09] just motion him through get on in there
[1:34:11] you sorry
[1:34:14] thing so Jesus didn't turn and walk
[1:34:18] out no doubt he already knew when he
[1:34:20] accepted the
[1:34:22] invitation how this church service was
[1:34:24] going to
[1:34:27] be so he goes in and he don't know where
[1:34:31] to set because nobody was kind to
[1:34:35] him nobody told him sir your seat is
[1:34:38] over here this this is reserve for you
[1:34:40] so he
[1:34:42] just kind of looking
[1:34:45] around where should I
[1:34:47] go so we say he just goes over here and
[1:34:51] he he's kind of feeling embarrassed and
[1:34:53] ashamed
[1:35:05] and anybody ever felt that
[1:35:08] way embarrassed
[1:35:11] ashamed maybe your clothes wasn't as
[1:35:14] nice as so and so and whatever more you
[1:35:16] didn't meet up to their standard and you
[1:35:20] just kind of look
[1:35:22] down you imag the disciples they're on
[1:35:25] the outside now they weren't
[1:35:27] invited so they're looking through and
[1:35:29] they say I imagine Peter saying I'll
[1:35:33] tell you one thing if I get in there
[1:35:36] I'll Mash their
[1:35:37] mouth John say Peter Peter Peter hold up
[1:35:41] you know Jesus wouldn't want you to they
[1:35:43] do our Lord that way out out Peter calm
[1:35:46] down calm
[1:35:47] down come on be honest most of us just
[1:35:50] still got a little bit of Peter left in
[1:35:52] US I'm talking about the ones that got
[1:35:54] the Holy Ghost the rest of you got a lot
[1:35:55] of Peter left in
[1:36:00] you brother Dave can you imagine how
[1:36:02] they felt in their
[1:36:04] heart as they said look at
[1:36:06] him why would they do that to our Lord I
[1:36:10] have the same
[1:36:13] question why would we invite Jesus
[1:36:15] Christ to come to this service today
[1:36:18] then if he would go to moveing on some
[1:36:20] of you you wouldn't even
[1:36:22] respond cuz your scared to death of what
[1:36:24] somebody would say about
[1:36:29] you the prophet said as he got the best
[1:36:31] part of you just giving him the
[1:36:35] attic you give him a little prayer now
[1:36:37] and then what about it what kind of
[1:36:39] place you given him there set Jesus
[1:36:41] sitting over by him and his disciples
[1:36:44] couldn't come in they wasn't invited all
[1:36:46] of them standing around looking on there
[1:36:49] sit Jesus over there very
[1:36:52] uncomfortable the smell of the road on
[1:36:56] him dirty
[1:36:59] feet imagine Jesus as
[1:37:04] he unnoticeable as it
[1:37:14] could but down at his
[1:37:17] feet dust up between his toes dust all
[1:37:21] up around his ankles
[1:37:25] them all stand
[1:37:27] over look at
[1:37:29] him that's the Son of God so they
[1:37:35] say you're going over to speak to him I
[1:37:37] ain't going over to speak to him he

[1:44:49] something else Jesus
[1:44:51] wants Jesus wants to to be
[1:44:54] worshiped he wants to be
[1:44:57] entertained now everybody in this
[1:44:59] building ought to be able to relate to
[1:45:01] this since we spend so much of our time
[1:45:03] being
[1:45:05] entertained movies music social media
[1:45:10] phones Amen brother Donnie Amen brother

[1:45:20] D apparently you all ain't going to
[1:45:23] worship him I reckon I might to preach
[1:45:24] and do that
[1:45:29] too so Jesus actually wants to be
[1:45:34] entertained now being a grandfather I
[1:45:37] have been entertained my girls entertain
[1:45:39] me too Ash Courtney whenever they was
[1:45:42] little they would entertain us whenever
[1:45:44] the Parker girls come along they would
[1:45:47] entertain us and they wanted the intro
[1:45:49] and me they wanted everything ladies and
[1:45:51] gentlemen I present to you Miss elliana
[1:45:54] Reagan Parker she's going to come out
[1:45:56] and do so and so buddy would they put on
[1:45:58] the dog because they was entertaining us
[1:46:01] but you know what they was doing that
[1:46:03] they wanted to be seen sure they was
[1:46:05] doing it because they loved us and Jesus
[1:46:07] comes to church and we think about
[1:46:10] ourselves the whole time well what about
[1:46:12] me Lord what am I getting look I've not
[1:46:15] come to entertain you today I have come
[1:46:17] to entertain him well come on somebody
[1:46:21] that's the way he wants every day of our
[1:46:22] my life to be every day ought to be a
[1:46:25] day of entertainment for the Lord
[1:46:29] Jesus now know this may seem strange to
[1:46:32] you to think that this is what he wants
[1:46:34] but listen he wants to be
[1:46:38] entertained how do you entertain
[1:46:42] Jesus say come Lord Jesus Come into my
[1:46:46] heart I love you
[1:46:48] Lord
[1:46:51] entertaining so what do you do when you
[1:46:54] entertain people you put them in a
[1:46:57] special spot you let them be seated and
[1:46:59] then you get up and do whatever it is
[1:47:01] you're going to do to entertain
[1:47:04] them is it amazing how we've got church
[1:47:06] backwards It's All About Us well the
[1:47:09] temperature wasn't right I thought they
[1:47:10] sung one song Too Many well I thought
[1:47:13] this one song I definitely did not like
[1:47:15] I I and you think it's all about you it
[1:47:17] is not all about you we've come here to
[1:47:20] entertain the King of Kings and the Lord
[1:47:23] of lords sure these singers sing to
[1:47:25] bless you but we're not here just to
[1:47:27] bless you we're here to bless God we're
[1:47:30] here to entertain
[1:47:33] God right listen what Webster says the
[1:47:36] word entertain
[1:47:38] means provide
[1:47:40] someone with
[1:47:42] amusement or
[1:47:45] enjoyment give attention or
[1:47:50] consideration to an idea
[1:47:53] suggestion or a
[1:47:55] feeling he goes on to say my brother
[1:47:58] sister the most important thing in your
[1:48:02] life is to
[1:48:06] entertain Jesus
[1:48:11] Christ praise God ah I saw it click over
[1:48:16] some of you praise God you finally got
[1:48:17] your purpose in life right there you
[1:48:19] just got it that's the main purpose of
[1:48:22] your life
[1:48:24] but think about it how much of our life
[1:48:26] is focused on us entertaining him it's
[1:48:29] us being
[1:48:31] entertained we go here we go there we do
[1:48:33] this we do that other how much of our
[1:48:35] life is spent on
[1:48:38] entertainment for us
[1:48:43] though oh my and then he asked a
[1:48:46] question I'm going to ask you you
[1:48:47] believe that now they responded and said
[1:48:51] amen I believe the most important thing

[1:48:57] Christ
[1:49:00] properly in the first place in your
[1:49:02] worship first place in your life first
[1:49:05] place in
[1:49:07] Everything Jesus Christ deserves that
[1:49:10] place amen I believe it with all of my
[1:49:12] heart but if you don't now
[1:49:16] listen if you don't want him to have
[1:49:18] first
[1:49:19] place listen how he is

[1:51:13] back I can't wait till they come back
[1:51:16] and talk to me a little
[1:51:21] bit

[1:51:49] family room and we're going to watch an
[1:51:51] x-rated movie
[1:51:53] now we know you're very religious and
[1:51:55] you're very strict so you just stay
[1:51:58] there while we go have us a little bit
[1:52:00] of
[1:52:04] entertainment don't you dare get up from
[1:52:07] that
[1:52:14] seat so it just sits there and his face
[1:52:16] gets a little bit red and he
[1:52:18] said that's my daughter I I love her
[1:52:23] that's my
[1:52:24] son hurts me so bad that do
[1:52:29] that you come up about 10:30 11:00
[1:52:32] whatever it
[1:52:35] is you looking there are you still
[1:52:38] there yeah I I I thought you invited me
[1:52:41] you you wanted to talk to me where did
[1:52:44] you get that
[1:52:45] idea I work hard I need a little bit of
[1:52:49] enjoyment in
[1:52:51] life I get give you my heart what more
[1:52:53] do you
[1:52:57] want well I actually wanted all of you
[1:53:02] all of you you mean you want everything
[1:53:03] about me you want to control my time you
[1:53:06] want to control my life you want to tell
[1:53:08] me where I can live you want to tell me
[1:53:09] what church to go to now you want to
[1:53:12] tell me I've got to go to this certain
[1:53:13] church that has a message of the hour I
[1:53:14] can't even be part of the Rapture you're
[1:53:16] you're a controlling God you know
[1:53:21] that
[1:53:24] so where would you like for me to
[1:53:28] go well we're fixing to go to bed and
[1:53:31] we're actually pretty tired and we do
[1:53:33] not have time to pray
[1:53:35] tonight so if you don't mind would you
[1:53:37] care to go down the
[1:53:40] basement
[1:53:42] sure I'll go in the
[1:53:45] basement which door is
[1:53:51] it and you could enter and you keep
[1:53:54] quiet we need our
[1:53:59] rest Lord God
[1:54:05] children we send him in the Attic we
[1:54:09] send him in the back bedroom we send him
[1:54:10] upstairs we send him in the
[1:54:14] basement and he wants to be right in the
[1:54:16] living room with
[1:54:17] us he wants to be sitting at the kitchen
[1:54:20] table when we're eating he wants to sit
[1:54:23] there at the table and eat with
[1:54:26] us and have fellowship with
[1:54:30] us now I don't mind telling
[1:54:33] you I've got a long ways to go in my
[1:54:36] Christianity he's still working on me so
[1:54:39] if you invited me to your
[1:54:41] house and you treated me the way I just
[1:54:43] described the way we treat
[1:54:46] Jesus I might come back the second time
[1:54:48] just thinking perhaps you were not at
[1:54:51] yourself you had a really bad day you
[1:54:53] know you're really stressed out I might
[1:54:56] go back the second time if you invited
[1:54:58] me again but I probably would never go
[1:55:01] back again if you treated me the same
[1:55:04] way
[1:55:06] right but Jesus comes back again and
[1:55:10] again and again how many churches is he
[1:55:14] visited today in the Tri Cities he's
[1:55:16] been there for years been there for
[1:55:19] decades and they keep turning him out
[1:55:21] but he keeps
[1:55:23] coming back to see if there's one there
[1:55:24] that would warn him one that he could
[1:55:27] get a hold to their heart and bur them
[1:55:30] and bring them to a true
[1:55:32] relationship with
[1:55:36] him my brother my sister the most
[1:55:39] important thing in your life is to
[1:55:40] entertain Jesus Christ you believe that
[1:55:43] I believe the most important thing in
[1:55:45] any life is to entertain Jesus Christ
[1:55:48] properly in first place in your worship
[1:55:51] first place in your life
[1:55:52] first place in Everything Jesus Christ
[1:55:55] deserves
[1:55:56] that but if you don't he'll take second
[1:56:00] place he'll go down in the basement with
[1:56:04] you so you take him down in the basement
[1:56:07] you say now Jesus we're having a party
[1:56:10] upstairs after church but it might get a
[1:56:12] little bit Rowdy you know and we we
[1:56:15] might actually tell a few jokes it's you
[1:56:16] know kind of off color a little bit we
[1:56:18] know that that you wouldn't want to be
[1:56:19] around that so you just St here but now
[1:56:22] don't get in your mind now that we don't
[1:56:23] that we we're running you off oh no no
[1:56:26] no we definitely want you as our savior
[1:56:29] absolutely and when we walk before the
[1:56:31] white Throne we want you there oh my we
[1:56:35] want you there so you'll stand before
[1:56:37] the great judgment seat of God on our
[1:56:39] behalf and say father forgive
[1:56:42] them but we just don't like you
[1:56:46] meddling in our
[1:56:51] lives but by
[1:56:54] now she's already
[1:56:58] late she wasn't
[1:57:01] invited so she goes down her creaky
[1:57:04] steps
[1:57:07] and something's off she can tell it
[1:57:09] because the streets
[1:57:10] aren't crowded that
[1:57:13] day times she walks out a little bit
[1:57:15] toward the city market and she can smell
[1:57:21] it that roasted lamb and those
[1:57:25] Mediterranean potatoes and the taziki
[1:57:29] and the bread and the wine and all of it
[1:57:34] she gets close and think oh wow what a
[1:57:39] meal what it must be like to be able to
[1:57:42] sit
[1:57:43] there she thought well but a one woman
[1:57:47] of my type can never have nothing like
[1:57:49] that so she thought maybe maybe I'll
[1:57:52] just walk down and see what's going
[1:57:54] on so she gets down and she sees this
[1:57:57] great big crowd around the Pharisees
[1:57:59] house and she kind of goes to pushing
[1:58:01] her way in and of course she's a woman
[1:58:04] of ill frame and bad reputation and all
[1:58:06] the church people natur don't want
[1:58:07] nothing to do with her so when they see
[1:58:09] her coming they all go to scattering you
[1:58:11] know just scattering
[1:58:14] scattering so she looks
[1:58:16] in and she sees
[1:58:19] him and say oh no
[1:58:23] look at
[1:58:24] him they've not anointed him they've not
[1:58:27] washed
[1:58:28] him he's still sitting
[1:58:30] there dear
[1:58:35] God forgive me
[1:58:38] Lord for every day I've done that to
[1:58:48] you you know the
[1:58:51] story she goes back and gets her money
[1:58:54] and comes back and said I want the best
[1:58:58] perfume you
[1:59:01] have she didn't run to Big Lots at the
[1:59:04] clearance table and buy two for the
[1:59:06] price of
[1:59:08] one but she said I want the best you've
[1:59:14] got you imagine as she heads
[1:59:18] back maybe she gets on forth in Main and
[1:59:22] she comes to herself and said what in
[1:59:23] the world is the matter with me that man
[1:59:25] is a prophet he'll know who I
[1:59:27] am he'll know what I've done he'll know
[1:59:30] where I got this money to buy
[1:59:32] this but I can't help
[1:59:35] it there's something about his look that
[1:59:38] Drew me to
[1:59:42] him here she comes she's in a
[1:59:46] frenzy it's a passion by now I don't
[1:59:50] even know what I'm doing
[1:59:53] he'll probably throw me out I'll never
[1:59:55] even get past the front door but if it's
[1:59:58] him calling me he'll make a way to
[2:00:00] accept
[2:00:02] me so here she comes in and they've got
[2:00:04] the guards of course the poor people are
[2:00:06] on the outside and they're all just
[2:00:08] smelling that wine and smelling the lamb
[2:00:11] and all the things that the kebabs and
[2:00:14] everything in the Mediterranean diet and
[2:00:16] they're just smelling it in their mouths
[2:00:17] are watering about that time she comes
[2:00:19] running through and bust through the
[2:00:21] door somebody grabbed her out of my way
[2:00:24] out of my way reminds me of that little
[2:00:26] Mexican woman down in Mexico years ago
[2:00:28] and her baby had died that morning but
[2:00:31] she heard that the God had sent a
[2:00:33] prophet in the land the doctor
[2:00:35] pronounced the baby dead she come up oh
[2:00:37] Hallelujah hundreds of users couldn't
[2:00:40] keep her back they God they tried to
[2:00:42] stop her she crawled between their legs
[2:00:44] she went over the top of their back so
[2:00:46] that dead baby and that blanket under
[2:00:48] her arm why she had to get to where God
[2:00:52] God would be able to move I guarantee
[2:00:54] you one thing if we would start coming
[2:00:56] to the house of God today with that
[2:00:58] attitude all the Devils would tremble
[2:01:01] they would shake when you and I come to
[2:01:04] the house of God because we've come to
[2:01:06] worship we've come to entertain we've
[2:01:09] come to bless we've come to
[2:01:12] magnify we would get our attention where
[2:01:15] it needs to be not just on
[2:01:20] us
[2:01:31] so she bursts in the
[2:01:35] door and then the Pharisee looks at
[2:01:40] you you filthy
[2:01:44] woman course there's probably some more
[2:01:46] of them other people in there said oh
[2:01:48] dear God she's going to tell I'm a
[2:01:50] client
[2:01:57] she ain't there for
[2:01:59] them now let's face
[2:02:01] reality she's not even there for
[2:02:06] herself she's there for
[2:02:10] him oh brother Steve if we could start
[2:02:12] coming to the house of God but that
[2:02:14] frame of mind I've got needs but I ain't
[2:02:16] going for myself today my family's got
[2:02:19] needs but I ain't going for them today
[2:02:21] I'm born for his needs I'm called to
[2:02:24] meet his needs I'm his wife I'm a part
[2:02:27] of the bride of Christ I'm here to
[2:02:30] benefit
[2:02:34] Jesus imagine as she gets sh I do it
[2:02:38] shall I do what should I do his eyes hit
[2:02:42] her and his eyes Lo onto hers and like a
[2:02:47] gigantic magnetic power of a million
[2:02:50] strong it knows her she's helpless she
[2:02:55] can't resist him oh
[2:02:58] Hallelujah here I go despite the
[2:03:01] consequences you're like

[2:03:35] you but I can't wait till I get there
[2:03:37] that
[2:03:41] day and I can fall at his
[2:03:44] feet and take his feet in my
[2:03:50] hands
[2:03:54] oh
[2:03:55] Jesus you walked that lonely path for
[2:04:00] me the aroma fills the room her
[2:04:05] tears the tears of a repentant
[2:04:08] sinner begins to fall upon his
[2:04:11] feet the prophet said Jesus never
[2:04:15] moved never flinched never moved a
[2:04:19] muscle what's going on Jesus is being

[2:08:03] while I'm preaching to you this word if
[2:08:05] you're a sinner your sins can be
[2:08:07] forgiven while you're sitting there
[2:08:08] you're a Christian today full of the
[2:08:10] Holy Ghost but yet you're hearing an
[2:08:12] element about worship that you fail to
[2:08:14] give the Lord Jesus aren't you some of
[2:08:16] you sitting now your hearts are smitten
[2:08:18] right there you feel like your heart's
[2:08:19] about to burst open well let me go ahead

[2:08:31] are
[2:08:32] forgiven
[2:08:34] hallelujah oh
[2:08:37] Hallelujah why because you've repented
[2:08:40] right there in your heart you don't have

[2:08:44] altar when you are sorry it strikes you
[2:08:49] right
[2:08:50] there
[2:08:52] let him roll the burden away
[2:08:56] Hallelujah let's let's
[2:09:05] pray Lord Jesus if there's a one of us
[2:09:08] here
[2:09:10] today that has not already repented
[2:09:14] father would you forgive us
[2:09:18] now we're so sorry Lord we're so sorry
[2:09:24] s that we've made Church all about us
[2:09:28] and all about what we want and all about
[2:09:30] what we think forgive
[2:09:34] us Lord may we never come into this
[2:09:36] building again the same
[2:09:39] way and we realize it's not about us
[2:09:41] being entertained and yet that's exactly
[2:09:43] what some people want they go to church
[2:09:46] to be entertained that's why a lot of
[2:09:47] the modern day preachers ain't nothing
[2:09:50] but entertain
[2:09:52] ERS they know the things to move the
[2:09:54] crowd they know the words to say so many
[2:09:57] jokes that they can say that's why many
[2:10:00] of the modern-day churches they want
[2:10:02] flashing lights they want rock and roll
[2:10:04] bands they want all kind of
[2:10:08] theatrics I don't know that I'll ever
[2:10:10] forget whenever these professional
[2:10:12] people come in to talk to us about what
[2:10:15] we wanted on the platform and the
[2:10:17] screens and the guy told me that he had
[2:10:19] just bought this gigantic screen to put
[2:10:21] up his church for
[2:10:24] theatrics while the preacher was
[2:10:26] preaching so it would make the sermon
[2:10:29] more
[2:10:31] interesting I said

[2:32:25] going to All Nations teaching and making

[2:32:34] neither did he say repeat these titles
[2:32:37] so Peter in Acts chapter 2 whenever they
[2:32:39] stood there men and Brethren what must
[2:32:40] we do to be saved repent and be baptized
[2:32:43] every one of you in the name of Jesus
