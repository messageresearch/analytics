[20:43] [Music]
[20:50] We are often tossed and driven on the
[20:53] restless sea of time. Somber skies and
[20:57] howling tempest officer
[21:02] perfect day. When the mists are rolled
[21:06] away, we will understand it better by
[21:10] and by.
[21:12] Wo by and by
[21:16] when the morning comes and all the
[21:20] saints of God are gathered home and we
[21:24] will tell the story oh how we've
[21:28] overcome for we'll understand it better
[21:32] by and by.
[21:35] There's a message in the evening that
[21:38] the world can't recognize, but it's
[21:42] calling out a people for a rapture in
[21:45] the sky. And we've heard the prophets
[21:49] cry, and we know the reason why. We will
[21:53] understand it better by and by.
[21:58] Wo! By and by,
[22:02] when the morning comes and all the
[22:06] saints of God are gathered home, and we
[22:10] will tell the story, oh, how we've
[22:14] overcome. For we'll understand it better
[22:18] by and by.
[22:21] Now the bride is making ready in the
[22:24] garments he designed. Not with creeds or
[22:28] man's ideas. Just the word that's pure
[22:31] in line. Every promise she believes and
[22:35] she's longing now to leave. For the
[22:39] trumpet soon shall call us to go home.
[22:43] Go by and by when the morning comes and
[22:50] all the saints of God are gathered home
[22:55] and we will tell the story. Oh, how
[22:59] we've overcome. For we'll understand it
[23:03] better by and by.
[23:06] Wo by and by
[23:10] when the morning comes and all the
[23:14] saints of God are gathered home and we
[23:18] will tell the story oh how we've
[23:23] overcome for we'll understand it better
[23:27] by and I
[23:30] [Music]
[23:32] [Applause]
[24:11] I want to say just a little bit about
[24:13] this song. This song that we're going to
[24:15] sing, you've sung it here many, many,
[24:17] many times. The chorus uh the song does
[24:21] have verses to it and the chorus of this
[24:24] song has probably been sung uh along
[24:27] with sister Gerald Deian songs, brother
[24:29] Lo songs just to name a few other people
[24:31] that have written songs around the
[24:33] world. There was an assembly in South
[24:36] Africa that kind of adopted this song
[24:40] and because they didn't have verses to
[24:42] it, they wrote verses. So, we're going
[24:44] to fulfill a promise that was made to
[24:47] some folks that visited here a long long
[24:49] time ago that uh we would sing this song
[24:53] and we'll include the verses so that
[24:55] they can learn it in in their own
[24:57] assembly. So, uh Sister Betty wrote this
[24:59] song how many years ago?
[25:01] &gt;&gt; 40.
[25:06] Should be 50. So, we want we want to
[25:09] sing this song. Can't you see why I'm
[25:11] happy? Are you happy tonight? Are you
[25:14] glad you're happy? Give the Lord a good
[25:17] hand clap of praise this this evening.
[25:19] Amen.
[25:28] I know
[25:30] that the end
[25:33] is nearing
[25:37] and time
[25:40] is growing
[25:42] so sure
[25:47] that God
[25:49] he promised
[25:52] a
[25:56] and promise
[25:58] his word to restore
[26:03] [Music]
[26:05] the reserve
[26:08] [Music]
[26:10] in progress.
[26:15] The bride
[26:17] is believing
[26:20] his word.
[26:24] Her heart
[26:26] has been turned to her father.
[26:34] The voice
[26:36] of God she
[26:39] has heard. Sing this chorus with us. Oh,
[26:43] can't you see
[26:46] why
[26:48] I'm so happy?
[26:52] I accepted
[26:55] the word
[26:57] of the Lord.
[27:02] I reveal
[27:05] a word
[27:07] that was so
[27:10] done
[27:12] by the prophet
[27:15] of
[27:17] God.
[27:22] This world
[27:24] is fighting
[27:27] his promise.
[27:32] The word
[27:34] they've already
[27:37] denied.
[27:42] But God
[27:44] has favored
[27:46] his choice.
[27:51] be elected.
[27:54] This message
[27:56] will find
[28:01] we're waiting
[28:05] for the rapture
[28:08] [Music]
[28:10] to be changed
[28:13] in we call
[28:16] it.
[28:20] will be called up
[28:23] to be
[28:25] our savior
[28:30] will be
[28:33] in this whole world goodbye. Sing with
[28:37] all your heart as you stand. Oh, can't
[28:40] you see
[28:43] why
[28:44] I'm so happy
[28:49] I accepted
[28:52] the word
[28:55] of the Lord
[29:05] that was
[29:10] by the prophet
[29:13] of Mel.
[29:16] Sing that verse again in the chorus.
[29:18] Sing it. Can't you see
[29:23] why
[29:25] I'm so happy? Hallelujah.
[29:30] I accepted
[29:32] the word

[30:03] word
[30:05] that was spoken
[30:10] by the prophet
[30:13] of Malachi

[30:33] [Applause]
[30:42] They done good to be old people, didn't
[30:44] they?
[30:48] Except for brother Eric. He's not that
[30:49] old yet.
[30:52] Praise the Lord.
[30:54] I don't know about you, I appreciate
[30:56] having folks that have given their life
[30:59] for the Lord.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Stable, strong, they do something for
[31:05] me.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; You think, Brother Donnie, you're old
[31:10] yourself. Yeah, I know. But there's
[31:11] people around me that's even older. I
[31:13] mean, look at Brother D,
[31:19] Brother Harvey, and Sister Shirley was
[31:22] in Brother Bram's meetings.
[31:25] That does something for me.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; We've got all these people attacking the
[31:29] message and trying to make the prophet
[31:32] false and make him this and that and the
[31:34] other. Try to convince them.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Try to convince them of what they saw.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Get some eyewitnesses of it. You think
[31:44] you'd ever be able to convince Peter,
[31:46] but Jesus wasn't real?
[31:50] One of the brothers here had sent me a
[31:51] little clip the other day of the world's
[31:55] smartest man as far as smart with the
[31:57] highest IQ
[32:00] in the world
[32:02] and scientifically he was taking and
[32:05] proving why the Jesus was still alive.
[32:08] So he took a lot of different things and
[32:10] he was talking about the apostles and
[32:12] how that they gave their life for him
[32:14] and all the different things that that
[32:17] happened. And the end of the equation
[32:19] was that Jesus still had to be alive.
[32:22] After he got into it for just a few
[32:24] minutes, it done lost me, which is
[32:25] apparent mine's pretty low anyway. But I
[32:28] thought, I'm so glad I don't have to
[32:31] have Jesus scientifically proven.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's been proven to you
[32:36] how? By faith.
[32:40] you yourself, hopefully you can see
[32:42] yourself a little plainer uh tonight.
[32:46] Let's read together. Genesis chapter 24
[32:49] verse 54.
[32:54] And they did eat and drink he and the
[32:56] men that were with him and tried all
[32:59] night. They rose up in the morning and
[33:03] he said, "Send me away unto my master."
[33:08] And her brother and her mother.
[33:13] Her brother and her mother. Maybe some
[33:17] of you've got a brother like this and a
[33:19] mother like this.
[33:21] her brother and her mother said,
[33:25] "Let the damsel
[33:27] abide with us a few days,
[33:30] at least at the least, at the least 10,
[33:37] and after that she shall go." So they're
[33:41] saying one thing, Elis are saying
[33:43] something else. And he said unto them,
[33:46] "Hinder me not.
[33:50] Seeing the Lord hath prospered my way,
[33:55] send me away that I may go
[33:59] to my master."
[34:02] Now, there's no way that they would have
[34:06] done this in verse 57
[34:09] if they would have known the conclusion
[34:13] because the conclusion
[34:16] did not give them what they wanted.
[34:20] So, they did not believe Rebecca would
[34:24] ever do what she's fixing to do.
[34:28] And they said, "Fine,
[34:31] we'll call her. We'll call the damsel."
[34:34] And inquired her mouth. And they just
[34:37] knew. Brother JD beyond a shadow of a
[34:39] doubt. To them, there was no question
[34:42] about it. She said going to say, "Well,
[34:45] this is a cult. I ain't following that
[34:48] man."
[34:49] Can you imagine one 16-year-old girl and
[34:54] her nurse Deborah and a few more women
[34:57] whistle and the rest of them men
[35:03] on a journey between 450 and 500 miles
[35:08] which would take them a month
[35:11] night after night.
[35:14] You're encompassed by men you don't even
[35:17] know. They were convinced. They were
[35:20] totally convinced.
[35:23] And they called Rebecca
[35:26] and said unto her, "Wilt thou go with
[35:29] this man?"
[35:35] &gt;&gt; And you said,
[35:40] &gt;&gt; "Praise the Lord."
[35:42] We could dismiss and say, "It's been
[35:44] good to be in church already."
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad there was something in
[35:49] you that responded the same way?
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister Heather Potter's asking for
[35:56] prayer. Got laded and dizzy and they had
[35:59] to leave the service. Let's uh let's
[36:02] remember them in prayer. And I'm sure
[36:04] others have needs tonight in your body,
[36:07] in your home, whatever it is. Let's just
[36:09] take him before the Lord now.
[36:12] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful for
[36:14] your word and we thank you, Lord Jesus,
[36:16] for all the mighty things that you've
[36:19] done for us. We thank you for the
[36:23] absoluteness of your word and the
[36:25] absoluteness of your character. And it
[36:28] gives us such confidence for us to see
[36:31] how you have dealt with our predecessors
[36:35] and what you've done through them and
[36:37] their lives. And it gives us faith to
[36:40] know that you will do your will in our
[36:43] lives as well. Father, as we endeavor to
[36:47] look further into this beautiful story
[36:50] of the scripture tonight, I pray that
[36:53] you would help us, Lord. You saw the
[36:55] uplifted hands signifying needs,
[36:58] desires, request. Lord, this request of
[37:01] Sister Heather having to take her
[37:02] daughter home tonight. And we pray in
[37:05] the name of Jesus that you just moved
[37:07] for Lord this dizziness may it leave her
[37:10] father we pray. Father, we pray for our
[37:13] sister Clipper tonight, also our brother
[37:16] Steve Newsome, others, Lord, with
[37:18] different needs and things that they're
[37:20] going through in life. And we're just
[37:22] believing you, Father, that you're going
[37:24] to move. And we know the word tells us
[37:27] if God be for us, who can be against us.
[37:32] Speak to us tonight from your word. In
[37:34] the name of the Lord Jesus, we pray.
[37:37] Amen. God bless you.
[37:40] You may be seated.
[37:44] You know, I find
[37:47] delay
[37:49] can be such a dangerous thing.
[37:53] But what's amazing
[37:55] about delay is
[37:58] that Satan will try to impersonate
[38:02] us waiting on God for a season and for a
[38:08] time.
[38:09] and he will mimic that.
[38:13] But it's actually him delaying us from
[38:17] something the Lord wants us to do. Now,
[38:21] this girl, I I I hope that the Lord will
[38:25] will let me break it down, maybe take a
[38:29] couple of services and show you that
[38:32] every move she is making, every word he
[38:36] said, every response, all of it is being
[38:40] brought in to show who Rebecca really
[38:45] is. Now, I find it amazing because what
[38:48] they're asking here is something that is
[38:51] out of broken continuity of everything
[38:56] that she has done thus far. What I like
[38:59] to see about people is their repetitive
[39:03] character. Now, every one of us have
[39:05] hiccups in our life and we have breaks
[39:08] in the pattern of our soul. By that I
[39:11] mean that we will go through spots in
[39:13] our life and maybe we're kind of low and
[39:15] we're just going through a spot
[39:17] sometimes you don't even know what it
[39:18] is. Anybody ever been there besides me
[39:20] and you don't even know why you're
[39:22] feeling the way you're feeling and
[39:24] you're just feeling kind of low and
[39:26] sometimes kind of sad and sometimes kind
[39:29] of weary and you can't really put your
[39:31] finger on this or that or the other. You
[39:34] can't really put your hand on nothing
[39:36] that you've done in your life. And yet
[39:39] somehow it just seems kind of odd to
[39:42] you. And during those times, you know,
[39:46] we we may not have the amount of joy
[39:49] that we normally would. And we may not
[39:51] have that smile quite on our face like
[39:53] would normally be there. But I'm so
[39:56] grateful that the Lord doesn't hold
[39:58] those low times against us. Aren't you?
[40:02] I'm glad that he looks at us during
[40:04] those times and and realizes, but that's
[40:07] not really who you are. You will rebound
[40:11] out of that place and you will be
[40:15] exactly what you are continuously over
[40:19] and over again. I imagine it would
[40:22] surprise us if we could have been around
[40:25] the Lord Jesus and saw him as a man that
[40:29] we would have seen sadness in his life.
[40:33] We would have seen oppression and
[40:36] sorrow. As a matter of fact, the Bible
[40:39] says about him in the prophetic
[40:41] utterance of Isaiah that he was a man of
[40:45] sorrow and acquainted with grief. So
[40:49] grief was an acquaintance. It wasn't
[40:53] somebody or something that he saw once
[40:56] every 3 years or once every six months,
[40:59] but it was one that was around him just
[41:03] like constantly there, acquainted with
[41:06] grief, a man of sorrow. Now you're
[41:09] talking about the Lord Jesus. Well, why
[41:11] didn't Isaiah call him a man of joy? a a
[41:15] man of bubbling, a static just rapture
[41:18] all the time. You mean to tell me the
[41:21] Lord Jesus was called a man of sorrows
[41:25] and acquainted with grief? Yeah, he sure
[41:28] was. And no doubt it would have been
[41:31] quite surprising for the people that had
[41:33] in their mind what the Messiah would be.
[41:36] Now, David, you know, we know that David
[41:39] himself was a man of great ecstatic joy.
[41:42] He was a shouter. He was a jumper. He
[41:44] was a dancer, no doubt. He had all types
[41:46] of emotion. He was a songwriter. A lot
[41:48] of times songwriters can be that way.
[41:50] They can be up and down just like this.
[41:52] So there's no medium place for them. And
[41:54] David, whenever he was up, I mean, he
[41:58] was high. Whenever he was riding on top
[42:00] of the mountains, them mountains, it
[42:02] just seemed like he skipped on top of
[42:04] one of another. But when that man got
[42:06] low, he got low. David asks more wise
[42:11] than any other author in the scripture.
[42:15] Study it sometime. Why this? Why that?
[42:18] Why do the people imagine a ma vain
[42:21] thing? Why does the heathen roar? Why
[42:23] this? Why that? Why does the wicked
[42:25] prosper like a green bay tree? Why this?
[42:28] And why that? How long, Lord, will you
[42:30] delay in answering me? A man that we
[42:33] would picture, and I'm afraid we've done
[42:35] it wrongly. a man that we think was
[42:38] constantly shouting, constantly enjoying
[42:41] the blessing of God. I'd say we'd be
[42:44] surprised if we would ever see the real
[42:48] true David.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; I imagine that people that we have made
[42:53] up in our mind and we have got
[42:56] fictitious characters of the way we
[43:00] think they were, but in reality they
[43:03] probably wasn't like that at all. Now,
[43:05] whenever you look at what God was fixing
[43:09] to do for her, now watch how this up to
[43:13] this point, Rebecca has been hastening
[43:17] in every response that she has made.
[43:21] Watch. Hastening this, hastening that,
[43:24] running here, running there, doing this
[43:28] at a rapid rate. And now they are
[43:31] wanting something contrary to what she
[43:34] has been doing all along in the response
[43:38] to this messenger. Now you know it it it
[43:41] has to make me wonder did this messenger
[43:46] did this message change something about
[43:49] her and they thought the methodical
[43:53] behavior that they had seen over and
[43:56] over again about her. Did they think
[43:59] that would be the predominant force that
[44:02] would fall back and this is what she
[44:05] would react by? Now, I want you to
[44:07] notice how that this message and this
[44:10] messenger had done something to her.
[44:13] Watch in in Genesis
[44:16] 24: 18. And she said, "Drink, my Lord."
[44:21] And she
[44:23] &gt;&gt; hasted and let down her picture upon her
[44:27] hand and gave him drink. And when she
[44:31] had done given him drink, she said, "I
[44:33] will draw water for thy camels also
[44:36] until they have done drinking." and she
[44:40] hasted and emptied her picture into the
[44:44] trough and
[44:46] &gt;&gt; and ran to the well to draw water and
[44:51] drew for all his camels. Notice in verse
[44:54] 28, and the damsel
[44:57] &gt;&gt; ran and told them of her mother's house
[45:02] these things. So notice what the message
[45:05] and the messenger had done to this
[45:08] woman. So it had hastened this, it had
[45:12] hastened that. There must have been a
[45:15] supernatural
[45:17] acceleration that was somewhat above her
[45:21] natural behavior. And then her mother
[45:24] and her brother, who it appears were the
[45:27] spokesman, they felt like they knew her.
[45:31] Well, they probably thought they did.
[45:34] But you see, something had happened to
[45:36] her because an angel had visited her and
[45:41] not them. And it had brought somewhat of
[45:45] a change into her. No doubt they felt
[45:49] like she was more stable than this. And
[45:52] they had brought her up this particular
[45:55] way and no way she was ever going to
[45:58] make a hasty decision. Now, this is a
[46:00] pretty hasty decision. No time to
[46:03] contemplate, no time to pray about it,
[46:06] no time to weigh it out, no time to
[46:08] Google it, as we said before, check all
[46:10] of it out. No way to do any of that at
[46:13] all. And that there's no way that they
[46:15] would have thought she would have
[46:17] responded in this way. But this had
[46:20] already began to develop in her by the
[46:24] supernatural influence of what God had
[46:27] done. I hope somebody's hearing me
[46:28] tonight. Can't you see why that your
[46:32] family and my family and the family of
[46:35] others whenever we begin to hear this
[46:38] word for those of us who were not born
[46:41] in it and raised up in it. And when we
[46:43] begin to hear it that it affected us in
[46:47] such a way that it alarmed our family
[46:52] and alarmed our loved ones and our
[46:54] friends and to them it made us very
[46:58] susceptible to being deceived. So they
[47:02] were quite overwhelmed because they saw
[47:06] us reacting in a way that was somewhat
[47:10] unfamiliar with what they had known us
[47:13] as before. Well, just to be honest with
[47:16] you, if it do if it didn't do that, then
[47:18] really it shouldn't be a message that we
[47:20] should leave one another and follow this
[47:23] one for. If this one don't do more for
[47:25] you than your Baptist church, just stay
[47:27] in your Baptist church. If this message
[47:30] don't do something more for you than the
[47:31] Pentecostal message was in, just stay in
[47:34] Pentecost. You'll be better off cuz
[47:36] you'll probably go back to it anyhow.
[47:38] Yes, sir.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; But notice there was something about the
[47:42] message and the messenger. Now, what was
[47:46] what was the sum of the message so far
[47:50] that she had heard? Now, it was not
[47:52] doctrine. It was not theology. It was
[47:55] not about many of those things, but it
[47:58] was about people. Listen now. It was
[48:01] about people. So this this servant now
[48:05] he started with the master of the house
[48:09] himself which in the anotype of course
[48:12] was Almighty God. And then he went on
[48:15] down and brought it from the expression
[48:17] of Abraham and typed by Almighty God.
[48:21] And he brings it on down to the
[48:23] expression of his son which was Jesus or
[48:28] in her case Isaac and wives as he be to
[48:31] expound the message and it wasn't dos
[48:34] and don'ts. Now we have no record that
[48:36] he mentions anything about now you got
[48:38] to do this and you got to do that and
[48:39] you got to do this and you got to do
[48:40] that and you can't go here and you can't
[48:41] go there and you can't do this and you
[48:43] can't do that. But if he could get her
[48:46] so attracted to the person of the
[48:50] message itself and let her fall in love
[48:54] with the messenger, then whatever he
[48:57] wanted her to do, there'd be no problem
[48:59] with it from that point on. I'm afraid
[49:02] sometimes that we failed to actually
[49:04] lead people to a place to where they
[49:07] fall so in love with the Lord Jesus that
[49:10] whatever he asks them to do, they just
[49:12] do it. Brother John because they love
[49:14] him.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Now whenever the messenger then begins
[49:19] to move and in this sequence of events
[49:22] remember it's unfolding supernaturally
[49:24] and we know that the Bible I love the
[49:26] way the prophet says this that that the
[49:28] Bible actually condenses its truths. So
[49:33] there can be so much compacted in three
[49:37] or four verses that categorically in
[49:39] history there would be so much that if
[49:42] it were all written and laid out it
[49:45] would be phenomenal how much would be
[49:46] there. But we know truly that the Bible
[49:49] does condense its truth. So was this
[49:52] everything that was said or did Moses
[49:55] just capture the highlights of the
[49:58] conversation? But no doubt the stream of
[50:02] what was going to be projected to her
[50:04] and the conjecture of what he wanted her
[50:07] to get was not about himself. So he
[50:10] never bragged about himself. I want you
[50:12] to see how much the master trusted me
[50:15] because I am the oldest of the master's
[50:17] servants and the master gave me this and
[50:20] the master gave me that and the master
[50:22] trusted me with this and trusted me with
[50:24] that. I imagine that certainly she
[50:26] wanted to know. But to her, I I I just
[50:30] can't keep from believing that that him
[50:32] being there was all of that that he had
[50:36] spoke well enough of his own character
[50:39] that she didn't need to hear a sermon
[50:42] every night on the messenger himself.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me. I I realize a
[50:48] lot of folks in the message, they'd
[50:49] rather hear the messenger preach than
[50:51] they would what the message is all
[50:53] about, the Lord Jesus. But I'm here to
[50:55] tell you tonight, this night's not going
[50:57] to be about your pastor. This night is
[50:59] not going to be just us focusing on
[51:02] God's prophet. It's not going to be
[51:04] focusing on Elijah or or Jeremiah. But I
[51:07] want to point you tonight to who this is
[51:10] really all about. It's about the Lord
[51:13] Jesus and you.
[51:15] Is that all right with you?
[51:19] &gt;&gt; So notice how the the methodical pattern
[51:23] of Rebecca is now running true to form.
[51:27] That doesn't say, of course, that she
[51:28] didn't have something about this before
[51:31] and it must have been something that was
[51:33] laying there. But you know from getting
[51:35] of the picture that we're able to even
[51:37] get about people like Noah, the prophet
[51:40] said that Noah was a man that had no
[51:43] certain desire, no certain ambition
[51:45] really to do anything. It wasn't like he
[51:48] wanted to be a great renowned
[51:50] worldshaking person and thinking I'm
[51:53] going to build a boat and I'm going to
[51:54] be the only man on the earth. I'm going
[51:55] to make history from this point on. I'm
[51:58] going to do this and I'm going to do
[51:59] that. He was just a farmer just raising
[52:01] his crops. Happy to be alive. Happy to
[52:04] be, you know, knowing what he did about
[52:06] God and the mercy of God. But God did
[52:09] something to Noah and raised something
[52:12] up out of Noah that was laying in him in
[52:15] seed form that had been hidden under the
[52:18] mass of a farmer's life. And God didn't
[52:22] even call him and said, "Now tell what I
[52:24] want you to do. I want you to raise
[52:25] these great big gigantic massive
[52:27] vegetables and I want you to climb up on
[52:30] top of a watermelon and you're going to
[52:32] sail the water on top of watermelon.
[52:33] Give a giraffe a cantaloupe and give
[52:36] everybody else a squash and green
[52:37] peppers and all that. God called the man
[52:40] totally out of his line of profession.
[52:43] And his vocation was not building. his
[52:46] vocation. We don't even know if the man
[52:48] could even hang a plum door or not until
[52:51] God called him and God changed him and
[52:54] absolutely went contrary to that which
[52:57] he felt comfortable in doing. That's a
[52:59] God called man. I said that's a God
[53:02] called man. You imagine he could have
[53:04] give all kinds of excuses. But yet think
[53:07] about it now that God can has the
[53:09] ability of bringing things out in people
[53:13] and it will totally shock and surprise
[53:16] those many times who knows it. Now those
[53:18] who have great capacities on their own
[53:21] and then the call of God what they think
[53:23] is the call of God and then they say
[53:25] here God I'll do it. I'll do it and then
[53:27] they want to present what they are so
[53:30] they've got a great mind and they can be
[53:32] able to take the scriptures and put it
[53:33] together. My really impressed people,
[53:35] nine times out of 10 that individual
[53:38] never has been called of God, never will
[53:40] be. But God will call somebody that
[53:43] looking at them and they'll say, "Nope,
[53:45] there ain't no man in the world. That
[53:46] fell never mount to hill of beans." That
[53:48] old boy, I'll tell you one thing, you
[53:50] know, he'll never amount to nothing. And
[53:52] God says, "That's my man." And the one
[53:54] that people say, "Now, Lord, pick this
[53:56] guy. Pick that guy. Pick that woman.
[53:58] Pick that woman there." that God will
[54:00] say, "Nope, I don't want nothing new as
[54:02] them because if I use them, all they're
[54:05] going to be is a stuffed shirt. That's
[54:07] all they're going to be, a stuffed
[54:09] shirt. I don't want to be a stuffed
[54:11] shirt, but I do want to have a stuffed
[54:13] heart. I want my heart to be stuffed
[54:15] full of the goodness and the mercy and
[54:17] the power of God."
[54:19] So, notice what they ask Rebecca now to
[54:22] do. So they're asking her to behave in a
[54:27] a way contrary to the way of what the
[54:30] message has done for her already. Now
[54:33] whether or not she acted like this
[54:34] before or not, we really don't know. But
[54:36] by them asking the question that they
[54:39] did, as I said, there's no way they
[54:41] would have believed her response would
[54:43] have been this way. They would have
[54:44] never asked her. They would have asked
[54:46] something in the way that they thought,
[54:48] well, she herself, we know her. if we
[54:50] look at her the right way, she's going
[54:52] to say no. Well, no doubt they both
[54:54] looked at her the right way and she
[54:56] didn't say no. So, whatever it was that
[54:59] they expected about her turned out
[55:01] totally different and the spirit of God
[55:04] had already moved upon her heart against
[55:08] all reasoning. Now, it would have seemed
[55:11] sensible. They're never going to see her
[55:13] again. Think of this now. They will
[55:15] never see her again. Her mother never
[55:18] saw her. Her brother never saw her. Her
[55:21] nieces, nephews, if they had any. Nobody
[55:24] of her family ever saw her again. So,
[55:28] she's met this man the day before and
[55:30] the next day she's heading out on a
[55:32] month-long journey to only God knows
[55:34] where if this man is even true and
[55:36] reputable or not. So, in one sense of
[55:39] the word, you could have see why they
[55:41] would have not been asking too much. But
[55:43] in another sense of the word, they were
[55:46] asking too much because what they asked
[55:49] for was simply contrary to what the
[55:53] messenger said. Now, had the messenger
[55:57] said, "Well, I'll tell you what. All
[55:59] right. Now, this has gone really good.
[56:01] So, what I'm going to do is we're just
[56:03] going to kind of hang around here for
[56:05] about a week, 10 days, something like
[56:07] that. We're going to let you go out and
[56:09] say goodbye to all the school kids that
[56:11] you knew. we're going to let you say
[56:13] goodbye to these and this and that and
[56:15] that and you can have, you know, two or
[56:17] three different gatherings together with
[56:19] your family. And we understand that. We
[56:21] we understand that. But somehow the
[56:24] messenger must have had an insight that
[56:28] delay would have actually affected the
[56:32] cause of God. Now had he said it's fine
[56:36] for us to delay and then they would have
[56:39] said delay that would have been no
[56:41] problem. Now her first trial comes
[56:45] whenever the messenger says one thing
[56:48] but her family says something different.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; It's amazing how many people around the
[56:55] message that's been around for 30 years
[56:57] still ain't learned what Rebecca learned
[57:00] after following the messenger only one
[57:02] day. But somehow another did she
[57:05] understand it? Now notice, I don't want
[57:06] us to make a superhuman woman out of
[57:10] Rebecca. There's no way that Rebecca had
[57:13] the faith of Abraham without her being
[57:16] tried in a similar way that Abraham was.
[57:19] So she could believe things that were
[57:21] not as though they were. So I believe
[57:24] myself that Rebecca was tried on this
[57:27] journey. I don't believe it was a
[57:30] pleasant journey. I don't believe that
[57:32] everything on the journey maybe went to
[57:35] her expectation. It would have been
[57:37] unlike the family she was going to marry
[57:40] into. For her to have had everything
[57:43] under her expectation on the journey
[57:46] would have been a great contrast to the
[57:48] way God dealt with Abraham and Isaac. So
[57:52] she is going to be a perfect match for
[57:55] the family of Abraham. Remember the
[57:58] requirement was to Eleazar, I want you
[58:01] to go find a bride for my son of my
[58:04] people. Now he's not just talking about
[58:07] his own flesh and blood. He is that. But
[58:09] he's wanting someone, a daughter that
[58:13] will be of his own kind, of his own
[58:16] nature. What? A daughter of faith. Not
[58:20] just a daughter of the same bloodline,
[58:22] but a daughter of faith. Now, whenever
[58:24] Eleazar has a month to make this
[58:28] journey, he's praying. He's thinking
[58:30] about it. God, give me the right
[58:32] questions. Give me the right things so
[58:34] I'm going to find the right bloodline.
[58:35] Yes, but Lord God, give me the right
[58:37] things to ask her so I can know she will
[58:40] be a perfect fit into the family of
[58:44] faith. Well, I don't mind telling you
[58:46] tonight there's all kinds of Christians
[58:48] around the world, but a lot of them do
[58:50] not fit in the real bride family of
[58:53] faith. They don't. They make good
[58:55] nominal Christians. They make good, you
[58:57] know, churchgoing people, and the Lord
[58:59] is the one to judge, all that sort of
[59:01] thing. But I'll tell you, it takes a
[59:04] really selected class, the better of
[59:07] their class like the Rebecca type that
[59:10] is able to answer in respond to the
[59:13] promised word. and they have something
[59:15] in them by the influence of the angels
[59:18] of God. I'm going to go ahead and tell
[59:20] you tonight, before you ever even knew
[59:23] about it, God made a deposit down inside
[59:25] of your soul. And there ain't enough
[59:27] devils out of hell to stop you from
[59:29] making that journey. I don't care what
[59:32] the devil does. I don't care what people
[59:34] do. You can be so hurt by preachers and
[59:37] hurt by people and everything else and
[59:39] it may tear your heart out of you. But
[59:41] I'll tell you what, it will never move
[59:43] that seed in your soul because it is an
[59:47] immovable part of the immovable almighty
[59:51] God. It ain't you. It ain't your
[59:54] determination. It ain't your desire.
[59:56] It's a deposit of himself that's given
[59:59] to his elect only. And the church said,
[1:00:05] Oh my. So, they're trying to do what?
[1:00:08] Delay.
[1:00:10] Oh, listen to me. Delay can be such a
[1:00:15] dangerous
[1:00:17] thing.
[1:00:19] When a person is being caught in the
[1:00:21] influence of an individual, whether it's
[1:00:24] a friend, whether it's a a a relative,
[1:00:27] whatever it is, and that influence is
[1:00:29] pulling them in a direction
[1:00:32] that they know is contrary to the word,
[1:00:35] and they keep putting it off and putting
[1:00:38] it off and putting it off to break away
[1:00:41] from that person.
[1:00:43] Look at the danger. Look at what they're
[1:00:46] flirting with.
[1:00:48] Now watch what the prophet said here in
[1:00:50] desperations. He said Rebecca the
[1:00:52] beautiful maid came and watered the
[1:00:54] camel and then said don't delay me in my
[1:00:58] way. She had to come to a time of
[1:01:01] decision whether she would go. She was a
[1:01:05] type of the bride. Notice Rebecca does
[1:01:08] not type the foolish virgin.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] So foolish virgin will never be able to
[1:01:15] relate to Rebecca type by type by type
[1:01:19] by type by type. They may pick certain
[1:01:22] things but only the bride can answer be
[1:01:25] the antitype of Rebecca. She was a type
[1:01:28] of the bride. Would she go and marry a
[1:01:31] man who she has never seen? Oh my. Now
[1:01:34] that's a great thing. Never even seen
[1:01:37] him. Yet she had only heard by his
[1:01:41] servant. Now look at the way God does
[1:01:43] this. That's the type of the bride.
[1:01:46] You've never seen Christ. Oh hallelujah.
[1:01:50] But you hear, notice now, but you hear
[1:01:54] by his servants what he is. So most of
[1:02:00] us have never seen the corporal body of
[1:02:02] the Lord Jesus. He personally never come
[1:02:05] put his arms around us and appeared to
[1:02:07] us in a vision and we saw him and we
[1:02:09] fell in love with him. But how did we
[1:02:12] start falling in love with him? By
[1:02:14] servants, people telling us. Some of you
[1:02:17] got started in a Baptist church, maybe
[1:02:19] some of you in a Methodist, some of you
[1:02:21] in a Pentecost, or some of you in a
[1:02:22] message. So, who knows where it was? But
[1:02:25] something moved upon your heart and you
[1:02:27] begin to hear about him and it started
[1:02:29] making a drawing power between you and
[1:02:32] him. And then the more you begin to hear
[1:02:35] about him, then you begin to fall more
[1:02:37] in love. Now, the more anointed the
[1:02:39] servant is and the greater gift in the
[1:02:41] servant's life, the more he can get out
[1:02:44] of the way, the more that he can project
[1:02:46] Jesus to you and it helps you fall in
[1:02:49] love with him more. And the church said,
[1:02:52] "That's the kind of preachers I like to
[1:02:53] listen to. I like to listen to them and
[1:02:56] they get so out of the way." You can
[1:02:58] still see the human element there, of
[1:03:00] course, but they get so much out of the
[1:03:02] way and they project the Lord Jesus as
[1:03:05] being so great that you just feel like
[1:03:07] you could reach out and touch him. A
[1:03:09] man's already done what he's supposed to
[1:03:10] do when he can do that. Now, notice what
[1:03:13] is it? You sell out everything. You
[1:03:15] leave your homes, everything else it
[1:03:18] takes to go find him. Now notice and she
[1:03:21] made the decision type of the bride
[1:03:24] letter left her denominational home. Oh
[1:03:28] my. Okay. So Laban and his mother and
[1:03:34] that system there that they were in were
[1:03:37] typified. The prophet of God types them
[1:03:39] like a denomination.
[1:03:42] Now, we remember years later whenever
[1:03:45] Jacob comes back and he's going to leave
[1:03:48] out and remember and one of his wives,
[1:03:50] Rachel goes and what does she do? She
[1:03:53] gets the gods out of her father's house,
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; this same Laban right here. So, he was a
[1:04:03] heathen,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; an idoltor.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; He believed in the trinity at least.
[1:04:11] So Rachel steals her father's gods. So
[1:04:16] Rebecca was delivered out of this
[1:04:20] denominational
[1:04:21] home. Then some of you tell me that
[1:04:24] God's given you a husband or a wife
[1:04:26] that's a denominational. I want to know
[1:04:28] where what are you people drinking?
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; What are you eating? You sure ain't
[1:04:34] hearing to what your pastor's preaching.
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:37] So God loved Harry out of a denomination
[1:04:40] and lead some of you back and you young
[1:04:42] men going into these denominational
[1:04:44] churches to find yourself a wife or you
[1:04:47] sister to find yourself a denominational
[1:04:49] man. What in the world's matter with
[1:04:52] you?
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Are you out of your mind?
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Boy, it's getting hot in here ain't it?
[1:05:02] Man, a lot.
[1:05:05] Now notice that God called her out of
[1:05:08] that denominational system. What's
[1:05:10] amazing is now that denominational
[1:05:13] system was her family.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Her family was the denominational
[1:05:20] system.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Donnie, preach it, Brother
[1:05:25] Donnie. I'm with you, Brother Donnie.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now look how dangerous
[1:05:33] it could have been. I I know you don't
[1:05:36] you stand there thinking well what
[1:05:37] difference would it have made? But you
[1:05:39] see if she would have delayed I I know
[1:05:42] it's phenomenal really how that the
[1:05:44] exposure of truth can counteract once
[1:05:48] you've walked into light. People they
[1:05:50] they don't make any sense out of it. But
[1:05:52] actually after she had been exposed to
[1:05:54] this truth and then had she delayed and
[1:05:58] waited and answered the wrong thing. I
[1:06:01] hope you understand where I'm going to
[1:06:02] go with this now. Had she said, "I will
[1:06:06] stay."
[1:06:08] Do you understand what Eleazar would
[1:06:11] have done?
[1:06:12] Left
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; and left her there.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; each answer, each response. Can you
[1:06:24] imagine? She could have done everything
[1:06:28] right up to the last answer.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; She could have quit cutting her hair as
[1:06:34] we say, and cleaned out her closet and
[1:06:36] done this and done that and done that.
[1:06:39] This This Oh, children, listen. This
[1:06:42] answer is the final decision.
[1:06:46] Rebecca, what are you going to say? Oh,
[1:06:49] if she would have said, "Oh, what? My
[1:06:51] mama wants me to stay here. I I'm stay.
[1:06:53] And if you ain't willing to stay, "Well,
[1:06:55] I guess I'm not willing to go with you."
[1:06:57] Then that would have let him know then
[1:06:59] you are not worthy of my master.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Happy Valley, Word of
[1:07:05] Life, Mendon Church, whatever your
[1:07:08] church is, if we are coming down and we
[1:07:11] serve him for 30 years and then he keeps
[1:07:14] asking questions and asking questions.
[1:07:17] Don't you see what he's doing? Do you
[1:07:19] still love me now? Are you still going
[1:07:21] to serve me? I took your husband. I took
[1:07:24] your wife. I took your son. I took your
[1:07:27] daughter. What are you going to do now,
[1:07:29] Lance? He's waiting for an answer. He's
[1:07:32] waits for an answer. Brother Jim, what
[1:07:34] will be our answer? Word of life. I will
[1:07:38] go.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will go. I'll have nothing to go
[1:07:44] back to.
[1:07:50] Can you imagine as he stands there
[1:07:53] nervously
[1:07:55] waiting
[1:08:00] and they ask the maid,
[1:08:03] "Will you go with this man?"
[1:08:07] No. How does in a derogatory tone this
[1:08:12] great messenger from God? Oh, no.
[1:08:14] Nothing complimentary like that. Will
[1:08:16] you go to your fame and fortune? Will
[1:08:19] you go to this great position of
[1:08:22] predestination?
[1:08:24] No. Notice what they done. They totally
[1:08:26] twisted it right back around now. Will
[1:08:29] you go with this man?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Rebecca,
[1:08:36] answer carefully.
[1:08:39] Your whole destiny
[1:08:42] lays on this.
[1:08:45] I will go
[1:08:48] or I won't go.
[1:08:56] Only one word difference.
[1:08:59] Will or won't.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Wow, that's close, ain't it?
[1:09:08] Now, delaying,
[1:09:10] as I said, isn't the same as waiting,
[1:09:14] but they can seem similar
[1:09:19] where people are directed by the Lord to
[1:09:23] wait and wait for an answer and wait
[1:09:28] patiently, sometimes for healing,
[1:09:30] sometimes for a move of God. Isaiah 40
[1:09:33] and verse 31. But they that wait upon
[1:09:37] the Lord shall renew their strength.
[1:09:42] But to apply this verse of scripture had
[1:09:44] it been written to her answer would have
[1:09:48] been misapplying the word and taking the
[1:09:51] word out of context.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:55] and caused her to miss the entire will
[1:09:57] of God by misquing scripture
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; and misplacing it.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; It's astounding statement that the
[1:10:07] prophet tells us the word of the Lord is
[1:10:09] not always always the will of the Lord
[1:10:12] because you have to place the word of
[1:10:13] the Lord in its right place
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; or it's not the will of God.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; So they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:10:21] renew their strength. They shall mount
[1:10:24] up as wings as eagles. They shall run
[1:10:26] and not be weary. They shall walk and
[1:10:30] not faint. But this was not the time to
[1:10:34] wait. Why, brother Donnie? Because the
[1:10:37] messenger never told her to wait. The
[1:10:39] messenger said, "It's urgent. The
[1:10:41] rapture's coming.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; The rapture's coming."
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, you say rapture? Yeah. She was
[1:10:48] fixing to be caught up on the back of a
[1:10:52] great big power.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; An animal in the Bible represented
[1:10:56] power. And she's fixing to be caught up.
[1:10:59] She may never rode a camel in her life,
[1:11:01] but she's fixing to be raised up into a
[1:11:05] higher place than she'd ever been
[1:11:07] before. And she's going to ride up in
[1:11:10] this higher place. Oh, glory to God.
[1:11:14] Until she meets her bridegroom. Praise
[1:11:17] the Lord. So, it's not the time to wait.
[1:11:21] It's the time to pack up.
[1:11:27] I want you to notice here the prophet
[1:11:29] again whenever he's referring to Saul,
[1:11:31] he said, "But then when Saul wouldn't
[1:11:33] wait on the Lord no more, Samuel turned
[1:11:37] right away from him." Listen how serious
[1:11:39] this is. Remember the first time, not
[1:11:42] the second time, but the first time that
[1:11:45] Saul took upon himself to take over the
[1:11:48] service of the Lord, Samuel turned his
[1:11:51] back on him and walked away from him.
[1:11:54] And the first time that the church lets
[1:11:58] their leaders
[1:12:00] take over to lead the people, the Holy
[1:12:03] Spirit gets right away from them. the
[1:12:07] first time the church lets their
[1:12:10] leaders. Can't you see friends why God
[1:12:12] is so against a denominational move? I
[1:12:14] ain't talking about the people inside of
[1:12:16] there. I'm talking about the hierarchy
[1:12:18] and what they do. God don't want men
[1:12:20] directing his church. Well, I now we
[1:12:22] know the Bible said that, but I this is
[1:12:24] what the board thinks and this is what
[1:12:26] they told me up at headquarter. God
[1:12:28] don't want his church run by that. He
[1:12:30] wants his church run by men filled with
[1:12:32] the Holy Ghost that will never leave
[1:12:34] that word.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. They would die before they
[1:12:37] would compromise in the word. Don't you
[1:12:40] see that very simple thing is the very
[1:12:42] reason God left every denomination when
[1:12:45] they voted and decided we're going to
[1:12:47] have a board here. We're going to call
[1:12:49] the church this and that and that and
[1:12:50] you can't do this and you can go there.
[1:12:52] As soon as they done it, God left them
[1:12:54] right there. They may have shouted and
[1:12:56] jumped for years and years, but the
[1:12:58] presence of God as far as his
[1:13:00] omnipotence pulled away from them, Lord
[1:13:02] God have mercy. Don't you understand?
[1:13:04] has done the same thing around the
[1:13:06] message moves. The message moves when
[1:13:08] they want to hear what a man's got to
[1:13:10] say. Well, brother so and so says this
[1:13:12] this way. And brother so and so, don't
[1:13:14] you understand the spirit of God does
[1:13:16] the same thing? I pray I hope and pray
[1:13:19] he never leaves our church. I hope and
[1:13:21] pray he's always welcome here because we
[1:13:24] want him to lead us and guide us. Not
[1:13:27] me, not the rest of these preacher
[1:13:29] brothers.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:32] Oh my.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; The very first time
[1:13:39] you go being led by man
[1:13:43] instead of God,
[1:13:46] the Holy Spirit will get away
[1:13:50] from you, too.
[1:13:54] Let the Holy Spirit lead. That's what we
[1:13:56] need as leadership. God gave us a leader
[1:14:00] and we don't hear it. Oh my. So what was
[1:14:05] Saul supposed to do? Wait on Samuel the
[1:14:07] prophet. And he waited and waited. And
[1:14:10] Samuel didn't come when he thought. What
[1:14:12] did he do? Run ahead of God instead of
[1:14:15] waiting on the Lord. But say, "Oh my
[1:14:17] goodness, Rebecca, maybe you should
[1:14:19] wait. Maybe you should wait." It wasn't
[1:14:22] time to wait.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; It was time to leave. Amen.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Notice again, he's trying to do God a
[1:14:28] service. I've been pretty rough this
[1:14:30] morning, but see, they that are are on
[1:14:32] the Lord wait on the Lord and they're
[1:14:34] waiting. And when they do, they see the
[1:14:36] promise of today being vindicated and it
[1:14:38] renews their faith. But see, this is
[1:14:40] what Satan tries to do. He's so tricky
[1:14:43] that he mimics God. And he will try to
[1:14:47] get us to delay. Oh my. and convincing
[1:14:51] us that we're waiting on the Lord.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I'm just I'm just waiting
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; on what? How long some of y'all been
[1:15:00] waiting for the Holy Ghost?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; What are you waiting on?
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Johnny, I'm waiting on God.
[1:15:06] And God's waiting on you.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; All I'm waiting on to get closer to God.
[1:15:12] I I'll tell you one thing. Sunday
[1:15:13] morning, boy, I'm going to get in
[1:15:14] service. I'm going to come in. I made up
[1:15:16] my mind. I'm going to get in. I'm going
[1:15:17] to clap my hand. But why wait till
[1:15:19] Sunday morning? This might be your last
[1:15:20] service.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; You're waiting and waiting and waiting
[1:15:23] on what? What's Satan doing? You're well
[1:15:25] just waiting on God. No, you're not. And
[1:15:27] many of these things you're delaying.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Some of you shed broke ties with some of
[1:15:32] the people that's waited you down for
[1:15:33] years and years and you're waiting till
[1:15:35] you feel led. Feel led. Nothing. Look at
[1:15:38] the attributes of what they're doing to
[1:15:40] you. And you're seeing what you're
[1:15:42] doing. You're not waiting on God. You're
[1:15:44] delaying.
[1:15:53] Moses delayed circumcising his son
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; and God went looking for him to kill
[1:16:02] him.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; God found him at the end and God would
[1:16:06] have killed him
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; because he committed adultery to
[1:16:10] somebody else's wife because he delayed
[1:16:13] circumcising his own son. So, it's a
[1:16:15] preacher preaching circumcision to
[1:16:16] everybody else and didn't circumcise his
[1:16:18] own son.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And the church said,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; "My my
[1:16:26] want to amen this part." You see, I'm
[1:16:28] called to preach the whole message.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; I remember the flood coming on. They
[1:16:35] rushed her out to the government depot
[1:16:38] out there for the hospital.
[1:16:41] That part of the night, it raining,
[1:16:42] twisting, blowing,
[1:16:45] always mine, God.
[1:16:48] No matter what it is,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; God says for you to do. And I tell you
[1:16:53] today that God in heaven who looks down
[1:16:55] upon me standing in this platform will
[1:16:58] forgive me. I know that many thousands
[1:17:01] of souls
[1:17:04] I will have to answer for it that day
[1:17:07] for listening to somebody else
[1:17:11] instead
[1:17:12] of God.
[1:17:17] Now I know people have said it for years
[1:17:19] and years. Say what the prophet said.
[1:17:20] Say what the tape say. Uhhuh. That's
[1:17:22] what I just said. How come some of y'all
[1:17:24] ain't saying amen?
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Why do people always get quiet when you
[1:17:28] read this? This is why I can follow this
[1:17:30] man right here cuz he told us this about
[1:17:32] himself.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; He tells us in another life story was
[1:17:37] the worst mistake he ever made in his
[1:17:39] life cuz he listened to his
[1:17:42] mother-in-law
[1:17:43] instead of listening to God.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; So he delayed
[1:17:50] delayed that delay cost him his wife.
[1:17:55] It cost him his baby.
[1:17:58] I got to be honest with you. I don't
[1:17:59] understand how all this works. Okay? He
[1:18:02] says that that day, Brother Dal, he's
[1:18:04] going to stand before God and answer for
[1:18:07] thousands of souls.
[1:18:11] How would you like to have that on your
[1:18:13] slate?
[1:18:17] But this is what I love about a man of
[1:18:19] God like this that can tell us his
[1:18:21] deepest faults and still rise above
[1:18:25] them. Oh, brother Josiah and say, "I
[1:18:28] will not let that keep me down."
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; How could you stand before people and
[1:18:34] preach to them and knowing
[1:18:38] that this you have to answer for?
[1:18:42] How would it not make you so low and so
[1:18:46] despondent that you think, "Why should I
[1:18:48] even try?"
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:18:55] Because God had his number.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And the same God's got yours.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he won't let go. Oh, you say,
[1:19:04] "I've got a hold of him." Baloney. You
[1:19:06] ain't got a hold of nothing. You've let
[1:19:08] go. I ain't no telling how many times.
[1:19:10] It wasn't that you had a hold to God.
[1:19:12] God got a hold to you.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus got a hold to my life and he
[1:19:16] won't let me go. There's probably been
[1:19:18] times we would have let go. and no doubt
[1:19:21] troubles and trials. We would have
[1:19:22] turned loose. But thank God when I would
[1:19:25] have turned loose, it wasn't me. My hand
[1:19:27] might have done this. But the great
[1:19:29] power is this. I had a hold of him. All
[1:19:31] right. But whenever I would have turned
[1:19:33] loose this way, he said, "I got you,
[1:19:35] Peter.
[1:19:37] I got you, Peter. You're going down, but
[1:19:39] I've got you. I've got you, Donnie. I've
[1:19:42] got you, J. D. I've got you, Carol. I've
[1:19:44] got you, Barbara. I've got you,
[1:19:46] children. I won't let you go.
[1:19:49] [Applause]
[1:19:57] Lord Jesus.
[1:20:00] I walked away and I went down and she
[1:20:02] looked at me. Hope did. And she said,
[1:20:04] "Bill,
[1:20:06] that's my mother,
[1:20:08] but I will go with you."
[1:20:11] And I said, God bless her heart. She
[1:20:14] said, "I will go with you." And I said,
[1:20:16] 'Honey, I I said, I I guess I'm carrying
[1:20:18] water on both shoulders and but I said,
[1:20:21] I I I don't want to hurt her feelings.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; And I said, what if something would
[1:20:27] happen to her and then you'd be worried
[1:20:29] all your life?
[1:20:33] You broke your mother's heart. And I
[1:20:34] said, "Maybe,
[1:20:40] maybe
[1:20:41] we'll just put it off
[1:20:44] a little while."
[1:20:48] So, Brother Brandham put off a little
[1:20:51] while
[1:20:53] going out on the field,
[1:20:56] preaching,
[1:20:58] reaching to the Pentecostals.
[1:21:01] put it off
[1:21:04] for a little while.
[1:21:07] Or you said, "But I'm bright. I'm I'm
[1:21:08] bright. I I'll be good. Even if I do
[1:21:10] mess up, God will fix it."
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; So that's what you think about election.
[1:21:20] That we could inadvertently walk right
[1:21:22] over the top of God's word and God will
[1:21:24] let you get by with it.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; God's prophet walked right over the top
[1:21:28] of it, but he did not get by with it. He
[1:21:31] paid a tremendous price.
[1:21:34] As a matter of fact, in Christ mystery
[1:21:35] of God revealed, when he come back in
[1:21:36] there, he said, "Every time I come back
[1:21:38] in the valley, talking about
[1:21:40] Jeffersonville, he said, "It gets
[1:21:41] sparred. It's just dark and spooky." And
[1:21:44] he said, "He still makes it tough on me,
[1:21:48] hard on me when I come back in here cuz
[1:21:52] I didn't go out the first time.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; He's still paying."
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; 30 something years later.
[1:22:03] Will you go, Rebecca?
[1:22:06] Or will you say, "Well, right now is
[1:22:10] actually not a good time for me.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Really? I you know, I mean, I I I
[1:22:15] definitely going, okay, don't don't
[1:22:17] write me off, God. I mean, I'm
[1:22:18] definitely going, but I've just got some
[1:22:20] things I need to take care of. I'm just,
[1:22:22] you know, I I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:22:24] win this man to the Lord and I'm trying
[1:22:26] to win this woman to the Lord. And I
[1:22:28] know I really shouldn't be as close
[1:22:30] friends as I am to some of these early
[1:22:32] kids that I am, but I'm trying to shine
[1:22:34] my light.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And how is that working for you?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; So, while you're shining your light,
[1:22:42] who's compromised? Them or you? That's
[1:22:45] what I find whenever believers go to
[1:22:46] Dayton or or court and whatever you want
[1:22:48] to call it, unbelievers. Well, the first
[1:22:50] one who compromised with that believer
[1:22:52] in the word compromise by going with
[1:22:54] somebody that don't even believe the
[1:22:56] promised word of the hour.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And who does the most compromising? They
[1:23:00] do.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; You know what the sad part about it is?
[1:23:03] Them denominational people and this that
[1:23:05] and the other, they don't really give up
[1:23:06] nothing of what they believe. They still
[1:23:08] believe the same thing did when you
[1:23:09] started fooling with them. But you're
[1:23:11] the one that give up this and that and
[1:23:13] the other. And the devil's laughing at
[1:23:14] you while you're doing it.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm right, brother Donnie. I'm
[1:23:19] bright. It'll be all right.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Maybe we'll just put it off
[1:23:28] a little while."
[1:23:30] And friends,
[1:23:33] there's where I made the worst step I
[1:23:37] ever made in my life. Right there. We
[1:23:43] put it off.
[1:23:48] About a few weeks after that, things
[1:23:50] begin to happen. The flood come on later
[1:23:52] from that. The first thing you know, my
[1:23:54] wife got sick. Billy got sick
[1:23:58] during that wrong. Right after that, the
[1:24:00] little girl just 11 months difference
[1:24:01] between Billy and his little sister,
[1:24:03] which was Sharon Rose.
[1:24:06] Notice in Zurich, Switzerland, telling
[1:24:08] the same story. Now, from here, listen,
[1:24:09] I I listen to my mother-in-law
[1:24:14] instead of God.
[1:24:18] and forsaken the church and went on back
[1:24:23] with the Baptist people.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; So you see, it wasn't brother Brandham's
[1:24:32] mother-in-law that compromised.
[1:24:35] It was brother Brandham.
[1:24:38] So he did it to keep from hurting her
[1:24:40] feelings.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, gentlemen. Don't get quiet on
[1:24:43] me.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; It's okay if I read these quotes, right?
[1:24:47] I mean, if we're going to press play,
[1:24:49] let's press this one, too.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; These quotes are here for a reason.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; They're here to teach us you can't do
[1:24:56] wrong and get by with it.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; So, God was calling Brother Brandham to
[1:25:05] move into the to the light of that day,
[1:25:08] which was the Pentecostal move.
[1:25:12] But of course, his mother-in-law called
[1:25:13] him all kinds of names and this and that
[1:25:15] and the other trash and whatever more.
[1:25:18] You know, it brother Ram doesn't say
[1:25:20] that he actually called them that. But
[1:25:23] when he's going down the river and
[1:25:24] heading toward the dam and his boat
[1:25:27] won't start. He's cranking and cranking
[1:25:29] and cranking. God have mercy. Don't let
[1:25:31] me go over that. And he said the spirit
[1:25:33] of God said to him, "What about them
[1:25:35] people you call trash?"
[1:25:38] I've never actually found where he said
[1:25:40] that he called him,
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; but his mother-in-law did and he
[1:25:44] compromised with her.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; So if people call your church a cult and
[1:25:51] you don't call it a church, but yeah,
[1:25:52] you compromise with them, I wonder if
[1:25:54] God identifies you in the same way going
[1:25:56] down the river.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:26:04] Woo! Oh my.
[1:26:09] Oh. And forsaken the church and went
[1:26:12] right on back with the Baptist people
[1:26:15] right away. Plagues
[1:26:19] hit my home.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; My wife took sick. My father died on my
[1:26:23] arm. My brother was killed. And
[1:26:25] everything happened just in a few days.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Children,
[1:26:34] don't delay.
[1:26:36] God's dealing with your heart with a
[1:26:38] closer walk. Don't you delay.
[1:26:42] God dealing with you. Separate yourself
[1:26:44] from this man, this woman, these kids,
[1:26:46] this this this.
[1:26:48] They're negatively affecting you. Oh,
[1:26:50] I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm delaying. I'm
[1:26:52] delaying. You better be careful.
[1:26:55] God dealing with your heart and you know
[1:26:57] within yourself that these people aren't
[1:26:59] productive for your life before God.
[1:27:01] There's preachers I've had to pull away
[1:27:02] from through the years.
[1:27:05] I don't want to do it. But if I've got
[1:27:08] to do it, I'll do it.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; I had to pull away from my own family.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; My mama, my daddy, most of my siblings.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; It's a very terrible feeling to have to
[1:27:22] be done that way.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; But I do it again. A I heard the cry
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; and my response was what was important.
[1:27:34] I will go.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My mama didn't go but I went
[1:27:41] anyhow. My daddy didn't go but I went
[1:27:44] anyhow. Amen. My cousins didn't go. My
[1:27:48] aunts, my uncles didn't go. They talked
[1:27:51] about me. They run me down and still do.
[1:27:54] that I made up my mind by the grace of
[1:27:57] God because I heard the message from a
[1:28:01] messenger and it did not make me fall in
[1:28:04] love with the messenger so much, but it
[1:28:07] presented Jesus Christ to me in a way
[1:28:10] that I'd never heard him before. I loved
[1:28:14] him, but I never loved him like I did
[1:28:16] after I heard the message about him.
[1:28:20] [Applause]
[1:28:24] Oh my.
[1:28:27] Notice this in this sermon.
[1:28:30] Look at the title here. 1959, a time of
[1:28:33] decision.
[1:28:35] Remember, she had to choose by faith.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; She had never seen the man. She had to
[1:28:40] choose by faith and the words of a
[1:28:43] servant.
[1:28:46] That's the same way you'll have to do
[1:28:47] cuz that's the only way there is to do
[1:28:50] it. God sends out his
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean it's not singular?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; they preach the word
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; and faith cometh by hearing. And what do
[1:29:06] you think about it? That's up to you to
[1:29:09] make your choice. I would advise you not
[1:29:14] to put it off. You say, "Well, I've
[1:29:16] always longed to receive the Holy
[1:29:18] Spirit. I better think it over. Don't
[1:29:21] think it over. This is the time.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. It's the truth. I
[1:29:28] believe that God would heal me someday.
[1:29:31] As long as you keep that in your mind,
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; you're a defeated person.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? I believe that God
[1:29:41] would heal me someday. And we'd hear
[1:29:43] people say that. We say, "Man, what a
[1:29:45] statement of faith." That ain't what
[1:29:46] Elijah called it. He said, "That
[1:29:49] person's defeated."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Think of it. Why? Because their faith is
[1:29:54] being delayed until someday. Oh, Brother
[1:29:58] Donnie, I prayed and I've come up time
[1:30:00] after time for the Holy Ghost, and it
[1:30:02] discourages me. Well, what am I supposed
[1:30:04] to do? You're supposed to believe God
[1:30:06] and take God at his word and remind him
[1:30:09] of his promises to you and your children
[1:30:12] and them that are far off. I don't have
[1:30:14] to wait till I get perfect, my Lord.
[1:30:16] Children, if you're going to wait till
[1:30:18] you get absolutely perfect, what in you
[1:30:20] need the Holy Ghost for? But you give
[1:30:22] God everything that you are, and he
[1:30:25] endus you with power from on high, and
[1:30:28] he will finish up what you can't do.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Some of you let the devil destroy you
[1:30:35] because you are delaying your progress
[1:30:38] with God.
[1:30:47] I believe that God would heal me
[1:30:49] someday. As long as you keep that in
[1:30:51] your mind, you're a defeated person. God
[1:30:54] healed you 1900 years ago.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now is the day of your decision.
[1:31:01] When you hear the message that Christ
[1:31:03] was wounded for your transgressions,
[1:31:05] with his stripes, you're healed. This is
[1:31:07] the time now
[1:31:10] to believe it. You have to make other
[1:31:13] decisions before you get married. You
[1:31:16] have to decide on what girl you're going
[1:31:18] to make your wife. You women have to
[1:31:20] decide on what man's going to be your
[1:31:22] husband. You better not put it off too
[1:31:24] long. He might change his mind.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Listen to this sad story.
[1:31:32] Like the woman was here some time ago
[1:31:34] and she had two men. They were both good
[1:31:38] men and she couldn't make up her mind
[1:31:41] which one she's going to marry and she
[1:31:44] lost them both.
[1:31:48] God wants
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; or brother Donnie, when's the next youth
[1:32:01] service? Because I'm waiting for the
[1:32:03] next youth service to get on fire with
[1:32:05] God.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; If I was you, I wouldn't wait another
[1:32:08] night.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you one thing, honey. If
[1:32:11] you want to come in here seven nights a
[1:32:12] week, I'll make sure these church doors
[1:32:14] is open and you can hit this altar right
[1:32:17] here and let the revival start inside of
[1:32:19] you. Don't wait for some youth preacher
[1:32:21] from Ohio, one from Louisiana, one from
[1:32:23] Mississippi, or here, there, or there.
[1:32:25] Why not waiting for a preacher with a
[1:32:27] briefcase? Why don't we just say, "God,
[1:32:29] let it start tonight, right now." Why
[1:32:31] wait till Sunday? Lord God, let it
[1:32:33] start. This is my time. I will go. I
[1:32:36] want a move of God. I want healing. I
[1:32:39] want deliverance. I want the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:41] I want a stirring God. Why do I have to
[1:32:43] wait till Sunday?
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; God wants immediate
[1:32:50] action. If you love him, throw
[1:32:52] everything else aside and take him. If
[1:32:54] you believe his word, cast everything
[1:32:57] else away and take his word. It's a time
[1:33:00] of decision.
[1:33:02] You have to make up your mind.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I thought this quote was astounding.
[1:33:08] and souls in prison.
[1:33:11] If you've got any darkness
[1:33:15] on your life,
[1:33:20] won't you come right here around the
[1:33:23] altar now
[1:33:27] while we continue to sing right now? Is
[1:33:29] there a worry?
[1:33:31] Is there a spot?
[1:33:34] Don't put it off
[1:33:37] any longer.
[1:33:40] Now, he's now making an altar call for
[1:33:41] the lost,
[1:33:44] but for Christians that have a darkness
[1:33:48] in their life or even a spot.
[1:33:53] A spot.
[1:33:56] A spot.
[1:33:58] Don't put it off any longer.
[1:34:02] Notice again Genesis 24:56. And we'll
[1:34:05] close him momentarily.
[1:34:07] And he said unto them, "Hender me not,
[1:34:11] seeing that the Lord," I want you to
[1:34:13] notice the word Lord here. It's not
[1:34:15] capital L and small O and small R and
[1:34:18] small D. It's capital L, capital O,
[1:34:22] capital R, capital D, and it's not
[1:34:25] plural.
[1:34:27] Wonder how this old boy knew this
[1:34:30] since he himself was a gentile.
[1:34:34] Remember, he was from Damascus,
[1:34:37] Syria.
[1:34:40] Hallelujah.
[1:34:41] And he said unto them, "Hender me not,
[1:34:43] seeing the Lord has prospered my way.
[1:34:46] Send me away that I may go to my
[1:34:49] master."
[1:34:51] And they said, "We will call the damsel
[1:34:54] and inquire
[1:34:56] at her mouth." No doubt they had all
[1:34:59] types of excuses and arguments of why
[1:35:03] she could not go and the longer she
[1:35:06] would have stayed around them as a human
[1:35:08] being. Don't make Rebecca now a
[1:35:10] superhum. You know what this shows me?
[1:35:13] It shows me even predestinated seed even
[1:35:17] elect of God can become influenced by
[1:35:20] your family or by your friends if you
[1:35:24] stay around them too long in a negative
[1:35:26] way. and they said, "Well, now pray
[1:35:28] about this and pray about this." You
[1:35:30] know, I heard somebody that got caught
[1:35:32] up in that random stuff and they run off
[1:35:34] and done this and that and the other and
[1:35:36] you know, you better be careful going
[1:35:37] over at that church. I've heard all
[1:35:39] kinds of things about them people. Well,
[1:35:41] you probably have, but that don't mean
[1:35:43] most of them is even the truth. But what
[1:35:45] do they do? They delay and they delay.
[1:35:47] Now, I'm warning you, honey, just be
[1:35:48] really careful. Just so little questions
[1:35:50] of doubt in their mind. You know, you
[1:35:52] got to be really careful and we have to
[1:35:54] really pray about this. just go on a
[1:35:55] 30-day fast and let's just wait about
[1:35:57] it. What did he say? We put it before
[1:35:59] the Lord and then we'll kind of see
[1:36:01] what's going. He said, "Don't you delay
[1:36:02] me. I need to get her and get out of
[1:36:04] here." And they can say, "Now, honey,
[1:36:06] that's the first sign of a cult. That's
[1:36:07] the first sign of a cult." Notice he's
[1:36:09] trying to separate you away from your
[1:36:11] family and they're they're already
[1:36:13] pulling you off now. We're noticing you.
[1:36:15] You're going over to their special
[1:36:16] Sunday evening things and you're getting
[1:36:18] away from us. Oh, darling, we're so
[1:36:20] worried about you. We're so concerned
[1:36:22] about you, honey. Do they drink red
[1:36:24] Kool-Aid? Well, no, but the preacher
[1:36:26] drinks red Gatorade and orange Gatorade
[1:36:28] and purple Gatorade. But I've noticed
[1:36:30] he's the only one drinking it. But it
[1:36:31] must be okay. Yeah, it is okay. Well,
[1:36:34] I'm I'm just concerned about you because
[1:36:36] they believe really strange things. We
[1:36:38] do. We believe there's only one God. And
[1:36:41] we believe we should be baptized in his
[1:36:43] name. We believe that one God came down
[1:36:46] upon the earth in the form of human
[1:36:48] flesh and gave his life to redeem us. We
[1:36:51] believe that one God ordained his people
[1:36:53] before the foundation of the world. We
[1:36:56] believe that one God has sent men on the
[1:36:58] earth called prophets. Come on,
[1:37:00] somebody. We don't believe hell is
[1:37:02] eternal, but we do believe that we are.
[1:37:05] Hallelujah. Oh, Brother Donnie. Oh my.
[1:37:08] That that's really messed up, Brother
[1:37:10] Donnie. Are are you saying that that you
[1:37:12] think you're the only one? No, I ain't
[1:37:15] saying I'm the only one, but I'm just
[1:37:17] part of the only one. Well, it sounds
[1:37:19] like you say only the message people is
[1:37:21] going up. Oh, that's exactly what I do
[1:37:24] believe. But I don't believe we're the
[1:37:26] only ones going to be on the finale of
[1:37:28] it all. But this is a wedding and this
[1:37:32] is a wedding procession and only those
[1:37:35] that are invited get to go.
[1:37:45] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Now, darling,
[1:37:50] please consider
[1:37:53] we just met this man yesterday.
[1:37:58] Now, does not the Bible say there'll be
[1:38:00] false prophets
[1:38:02] in the last day?
[1:38:05] Well, let me just tell you something
[1:38:07] right now.
[1:38:10] If William Bradam was a false prophet
[1:38:12] and more supernatural followed his
[1:38:14] ministry than any other prophets in the
[1:38:16] Bible
[1:38:17] and the devil had a greater false
[1:38:19] prophet than God had a true prophet,
[1:38:22] maybe we should switch sides.
[1:38:31] I heard of brother Random's name for
[1:38:32] years in Pentecost.
[1:38:35] Didn't know that much about him. I was
[1:38:36] sitting in a radio room one day making
[1:38:39] intros and promos
[1:38:43] for radio broadcasts.
[1:38:45] My voice was the beginning voice. Hello,
[1:38:48] we greet you here. Welcome to so and so
[1:38:50] and so and so. And then I would make
[1:38:52] announcements
[1:38:54] and then I would play 10 to 11 minute
[1:38:58] portion of a sermon. So that was the
[1:39:01] intro. Then I'd do the sermon part. Then
[1:39:02] I would do the outro.
[1:39:05] So one day when I was sitting in this
[1:39:07] radio room, I seen some books up here
[1:39:10] above my head on a bookshelf. So while
[1:39:13] the sermon was being recorded to send
[1:39:15] out to these radio stations, I just
[1:39:18] happened to reach up and pull one of
[1:39:20] them books down. Ah, sermon by the name
[1:39:25] of William Mary and Brandham. Well, it
[1:39:28] just so happened that the man that I was
[1:39:30] working with and working for at the
[1:39:32] time, his theme song was he was more
[1:39:36] than a man as he walked along the shores
[1:39:40] of Galilee.
[1:39:42] He healed the sick and he raised the
[1:39:45] dead and set all the captives free. Oh,
[1:39:49] I heard him preach it many a time. He
[1:39:51] was just a man till he stepped when he
[1:39:52] stepped up on the bow of the ship. He
[1:39:55] was a man when they woke him up. He was
[1:39:57] a man laying on the back of the ship as
[1:39:59] he rubbed his eyes. But when he spoke
[1:40:01] the word, he was more than a man. I
[1:40:03] thought, "Where in the world did he get
[1:40:04] that out?" I found out.
[1:40:07] I went and heard another man preach on
[1:40:09] the kinsman redeemer Ruth and Boaz. I
[1:40:12] sat there and slobbered like a horse
[1:40:14] eating clover and a new pastor. I
[1:40:16] thought, "Where in the world did they
[1:40:18] get that at?" I hear a man down in
[1:40:20] Kentucky preach this and preach that. I
[1:40:22] think, man alive, I read the same Bible
[1:40:24] they read. I don't get that. Oh, but I
[1:40:27] found out one day, brother Aaron, where
[1:40:29] they was getting all them little
[1:40:30] nuggets, it was bride food. Hallelujah.
[1:40:35] It was bride food. And boy, when I come
[1:40:38] to the message, all them preachers set a
[1:40:40] big distance between me and them because
[1:40:43] they knew I was going to tell where they
[1:40:45] got their stuff.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; They knew I was going to tell it. I
[1:40:50] didn't have any more sense but to get up
[1:40:52] and not only just hide it but you know
[1:40:55] just preach it and borrow a prophet's
[1:40:57] word but I got up and started reading it
[1:40:59] from where they got it from
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; but they all wanted his anointing.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Oh they all wanted his gift.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; And it's something how different we are
[1:41:16] from that. We don't want his anointing.
[1:41:20] We don't want his gift.
[1:41:22] We want his God.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:28] We want his God. That that's that's what
[1:41:30] I want. We want his God.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:36] It wasn't just a great depths of
[1:41:37] theology.
[1:41:39] But one thing that got me was the way he
[1:41:41] talked to the Lord Jesus in prayer
[1:41:45] and just the way he addressed him. I'd
[1:41:48] never heard anybody talk to him that
[1:41:50] way. And it just made me so hunger to
[1:41:55] know him in the same way that the
[1:41:58] messenger did, his master.
[1:42:03] Well, let me say this to you. I will
[1:42:06] never know him in the same way this
[1:42:08] prophet messenger knew him. But I sure
[1:42:11] know him a lot better than I did.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; And now I can relate to him in a way
[1:42:18] that I never did before.
[1:42:20] Why? The messenger and the message
[1:42:25] and my response.
[1:42:27] So the prophet and the spirit and the
[1:42:30] bride all saying the same thing.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Me and Brother Daryl was talking
[1:42:35] about before I come out, let me close.
[1:42:38] Brother Daryl said he noticed here the
[1:42:39] other night whenever I was preaching
[1:42:41] that Rebecca already had a voice.
[1:42:46] So Eleazar said his voice. Abraham gave
[1:42:49] his voice, Isaac gave his voice. And
[1:42:52] after she heard Eleazar's voice, her
[1:42:54] mother and brother had a voice.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Now it's Rebecca's time to have a voice.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. What' she say? I will go.
[1:43:04] Amen.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; All right, bride. The spirit and the
[1:43:07] bride say come. Let him that is the
[1:43:10] thirst say come. And the final voice to
[1:43:14] the final age will be who in the bride.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; And what are you going to say bride? I
[1:43:24] will go.
[1:43:26] If my mother don't go,
[1:43:30] won't hinder me.
[1:43:34] If my mother don't go, come on,
[1:43:37] brothers. Oh, won't hinder me.
[1:43:42] If my mother don't go,
[1:43:46] won't hinder me.
[1:43:50] I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my
[1:43:55] way.
[1:43:57] Well, I'm on my way
[1:44:01] to Isa.
[1:44:05] I'm on my way
[1:44:09] to Isaac 10.
[1:44:13] I'm on my way
[1:44:17] to Isaac,
[1:44:20] my Lord. I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm
[1:44:26] on my way.
[1:44:29] If my brother don't go,
[1:44:33] won't hinder me.
[1:44:37] If labor don't go,
[1:44:41] won't hinder me.
[1:44:45] If labor don't go,
[1:44:49] won't hinder me.
[1:44:52] Cuz I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm on my
[1:44:58] way. Everybody now. Oh. Are you on your
[1:45:02] way
[1:45:05] to Canaan's land?
[1:45:09] Are you on your way
[1:45:13] to Canaan's land?
[1:45:17] Well, I'm on my way.
[1:45:20] Yes, I am the Canaan land.
[1:45:24] Thank ain't God. Well, I'm on my way.
[1:45:27] Praise God. I'm on my way.
[1:45:33] Well, I won't turn back
[1:45:37] cuz I'm on my way.
[1:45:41] No, I won't turn back.
[1:45:45] Cuz I'm on my way.
[1:45:49] Well, I won't turn back
[1:45:53] cuz I'm on my way.
[1:45:56] Thank God I'm on my way. Praise God. I'm
[1:46:02] on my way. Notice now. Well, I won't
[1:46:06] delay
[1:46:09] cuz I'm on my way.
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:13] No, I won't delay. Getting the Holy
[1:46:16] Ghost or getting the healing. I'm on my
[1:46:18] way, glory. Oh, well, I won't be late
[1:46:25] cuz I'm on my way. Get out of my way.
[1:46:28] Devil, sickness, trouble, heartache,
[1:46:30] anxiety. Well, I'm on my way. Praise
[1:46:33] God. Yes, I am. Everybody all together
[1:46:36] now. Well, I'm on my way.
[1:46:42] Can
[1:46:43] Come on, children. Let's put our hands
[1:46:45] together. Let's just worship the Lord.
[1:46:48] Oh, praise God. I don't feel like it,
[1:46:50] Brother Donnie. I don't feel like it
[1:46:51] either, but I'm going to do it anyhow. I
[1:46:54] don't feel one lick of the spirit of
[1:46:56] God. I feel no anointing. I feel no
[1:46:59] chills, but I'm going to worship him.
[1:47:02] Hallelujah. Well, praise God. I'm on my
[1:47:06] way.
[1:47:09] If my family don't go,
[1:47:13] it won't hinder me.
[1:47:17] If my family don't go,
[1:47:21] it won't hinder me. Thank God. If the
[1:47:25] family don't go
[1:47:29] hinder me.
[1:47:32] Praise God. Is on my way.
[1:47:37] I'm on my way.
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:53] We love you, Lord Jesus.
[1:47:56] Praise be to God.
[1:47:59] Oh friends, how many people will wind up
[1:48:02] lost
[1:48:04] that never intended
[1:48:07] on going to hell?
[1:48:10] They had such great intentions.
[1:48:13] They was going to be saved. Oh yeah, I'm
[1:48:15] going to do it. Absolutely. That's my
[1:48:17] plans. I'm going to do it. I'm I'm not
[1:48:18] going to be lost. I'm not going going to
[1:48:20] hell. I I plan on going. Yes,
[1:48:22] absolutely. And they just wait and wait
[1:48:25] for what they think is the opportune
[1:48:27] time.
[1:48:29] and Satan tricks them and takes their
[1:48:31] life out before they ever get a chance.
[1:48:34] Or they get more deluded and deluded in
[1:48:37] darkness as they go and they finally get
[1:48:39] to a place they just send away their day
[1:48:41] of grace.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; And then they don't even want to be
[1:48:45] saved no more.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; But the question is, will you go?
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Now, let let me just set you straight
[1:48:55] tonight in case you're wondering. I
[1:48:57] don't think we're the only ones going,
[1:49:01] but I do think we're a part of a group
[1:49:05] that's going to go first.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; There'll be all kinds that'll come
[1:49:12] later.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But this group
[1:49:16] goes first.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the bridal party.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; The bridal party.
[1:49:27] Don't you love him?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Can we just bow our heads together?
[1:49:31] Let's just pray if you would
[1:49:34] like to be remembered tonight.
[1:49:37] You don't want nothing to hinder you.
[1:49:38] Men, women, boys, girls, adults,
[1:49:40] children, you don't want nothing to
[1:49:42] hinder your life.
[1:49:44] And if you've been slothful and lazy,
[1:49:47] can you imagine if Rebecca would have
[1:49:49] just sat there with her legs crossed and
[1:49:52] she wouldn't have said, "I'll get this
[1:49:54] and I'll do that and I'll do that." That
[1:49:56] would have totally disqualified her from
[1:49:59] being Isaac's wife. Every move
[1:50:04] was judging her character. our moves in
[1:50:07] church, our moves out of church.
[1:50:11] God's judging us, our character.
[1:50:15] We want our best, don't we? Every time
[1:50:17] we come to the house of God, we ought to
[1:50:20] give our very best to the Lord.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:50:27] Lord Jesus, as we have our heads bowed
[1:50:29] once again, Father,
[1:50:32] dear God, I pray that you'd begin with
[1:50:35] me and search my heart this very night,
[1:50:38] Lord.
[1:50:40] See if you see any delay in me in any
[1:50:45] way, Lord,
[1:50:47] that hinders my walk
[1:50:50] or hinders this church.
[1:50:54] I know there's such a delicate balance
[1:50:56] in waiting on you and delaying.
[1:51:01] And people who are procrastinators by
[1:51:04] nature,
[1:51:05] if they're not careful, they'll bring
[1:51:07] that same nature and they will try to
[1:51:10] serve God in that procrastinating
[1:51:14] nature.
[1:51:16] So they procrastinate and procrastinate
[1:51:19] and procrastinate.
[1:51:21] Then other people who are always speedy,
[1:51:24] hasty, rush, do this, do that. They'll
[1:51:26] try to bring their same nature and serve
[1:51:29] God with that. It ain't no wonder we get
[1:51:32] in such messes.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; When the truth of it is you want us to
[1:51:37] serve you according to your requirement,
[1:51:41] not according to our human nature.
[1:51:45] So in certain times you want us to wait
[1:51:48] and in certain times you don't want us
[1:51:50] to delay and it may never be the same
[1:51:53] thing and even the same day.
[1:51:56] So basically what you're asking for is a
[1:51:59] people who will follow you.
[1:52:03] So at certain times we will delay and at
[1:52:06] other times there's no time for delay.
[1:52:09] At certain times we will wait and wait
[1:52:12] and wait and we will renew our strength.
[1:52:14] At other times if we wait we will lose
[1:52:17] our strength, our joy. We will lose so
[1:52:20] much because we waited instead of
[1:52:25] moving.
[1:52:28] If Rebecca would have said one word
[1:52:33] different,
[1:52:35] I won't
[1:52:37] go.
[1:52:42] Her destiny would have been totally
[1:52:44] different.
[1:52:46] She would not have been the mother
[1:52:49] of millions.
[1:52:52] She would not have been one of the great
[1:52:55] women of the Bible.
[1:52:58] She would have faded back into
[1:53:01] Mesopotamian life,
[1:53:04] married some local farmer, whatever
[1:53:07] more, disappeared
[1:53:10] out of the pages of the Bible.
[1:53:14] But oh Lord, she said the right words
[1:53:18] just like Hetty Wright did that day.
[1:53:22] That ain't nothing but the truth.
[1:53:26] Help us Lord Jesus.
[1:53:30] Oh Jesus, we want to say the right words
[1:53:33] at the right time in the right season.
[1:53:36] Father,
[1:53:38] forgive us for our slothfulness and
[1:53:41] other times. Forgive us for our haste.
[1:53:45] We need you, Lord.
[1:53:47] We need you.
[1:53:49] Lord, I've been serving you all these
[1:53:51] years of my life, and I have to say, I
[1:53:54] need you more now than I've ever needed
[1:53:57] you
[1:53:59] cuz it seems like there's so much that
[1:54:01] the children of God are going through.
[1:54:04] Brother Daryl, talking out about it
[1:54:06] before we come out tonight, all the
[1:54:08] sickness and the trouble and the
[1:54:10] heartache and the anxiety and the stress
[1:54:11] and the worry and this and that and the
[1:54:14] other that the children of God are
[1:54:15] facing.
[1:54:17] Lord God, they need your help.
[1:54:20] Father, is one of those that you've
[1:54:22] called to help them along. I need your
[1:54:25] help like never before to know how to
[1:54:27] guide them. Lord, sometimes they look to
[1:54:30] me as their pastor for answers and I
[1:54:32] don't have the answers. I don't know
[1:54:34] what to say if you don't give me
[1:54:37] something to tell them. I look through
[1:54:39] the scripture. I look through the
[1:54:40] message and search and look for an
[1:54:42] answer. And sometimes I can't find it.
[1:54:45] And sometimes I have to tell them the
[1:54:46] same things over and over again.
[1:54:50] And you're trying me as you're trying
[1:54:53] them.
[1:54:55] But we want to be faithful on this
[1:54:57] desert journey, Lord.
[1:55:00] For I believe that's where we are right
[1:55:03] now on the back of this power
[1:55:07] that's taking us from one oasis to
[1:55:10] another, one mile after another. are
[1:55:15] facing
[1:55:16] unsettled questions, fears,
[1:55:20] all kinds of noises and sounds in the
[1:55:24] desert night. Things that we've never
[1:55:26] faced before. Lord, I imagine Rebecca
[1:55:30] faced all kinds of emotions and things
[1:55:33] that she had never experienced in her
[1:55:35] entire life.
[1:55:38] We don't want to rise her above her
[1:55:40] humanity in these next few services,
[1:55:42] Father. But help me, Lord God, to be
[1:55:44] able to bring her down as a real type of
[1:55:48] your bride in this journey.
[1:55:51] Hallelujah. In order to be of perfect
[1:55:54] fit in the family of Abraham, she had to
[1:55:57] be tried. She had to not understand
[1:56:00] everything and had to ponder and wonder
[1:56:03] about things.
[1:56:05] So do we.
[1:56:07] But Lord,
[1:56:09] we will say it initially, I will go.
[1:56:13] We don't have any record that he ever
[1:56:15] asked her again on the journey. You
[1:56:17] still want to go? You still want to go?
[1:56:20] You still want to go? No doubt she did
[1:56:23] need a little reassurance. She need a
[1:56:25] little bit of comfort of this and
[1:56:27] comfort of that.
[1:56:29] Reason I can say that is because we do.
[1:56:32] And she typed us.
[1:56:35] you did when you were on the earth after
[1:56:38] you had fasted and the devil come to you
[1:56:40] and tempted you and then he left you.
[1:56:43] The Bible says for a season and the
[1:56:46] angels of God came and ministered to
[1:56:50] you.
[1:56:51] It shows us that you had laid aside much
[1:56:54] of your great splendor and your
[1:56:57] resounding glory because when you were
[1:57:00] in heaven in the form of logos, you
[1:57:02] never needed angels to minister to you.
[1:57:06] But it shows what flesh does
[1:57:09] what it even did to the son of God. The
[1:57:12] son of God being the logos in heaven
[1:57:16] that created the worlds. Yet when the
[1:57:19] logos was put in a human body,
[1:57:22] it was so weakened down by humanity
[1:57:27] that the logos needed angels to
[1:57:30] minister.
[1:57:31] Lord God, would you come in this
[1:57:33] building tonight? Father, may the Holy
[1:57:36] Ghost pass up and down these rows
[1:57:38] tonight of these chairs. Father,
[1:57:41] minister to the young, minister to the
[1:57:44] single, to the married, to the sick, to
[1:57:47] the troubled, to the weary. Would you do
[1:57:49] it, Lord? Our human bodies, it weakens
[1:57:53] us, Father. It pulls us down.
[1:57:56] Oh, come by here, Lord God.
[1:58:01] Hallelujah, Jesus.
[1:58:03] We worship you tonight, Father.
[1:58:07] How many could just raise your hands up
[1:58:09] to the Lord? Lord, I need a little
[1:58:11] charge tonight.
[1:58:13] I need a little boost as it was. Father,
[1:58:17] come by here.
[1:58:20] Lord,
[1:58:24] come by here.
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:29] Come by here, Lord.

[1:58:43] here, Lord.
[1:58:47] Won't you come by here?
[1:58:53] Somebody
[1:58:55] needs you, Lord.
[1:58:59] Won't you come by?
[1:59:02] Whoever wants to just come up and stand
[1:59:04] around the altar, whatever your need is.
[1:59:06] Come on. Somebody needs you, Lord.
[1:59:11] Won't you come by here?

[2:04:05] [Applause]
[2:04:07] Somebody's praying. Lord,
[2:04:13] come by here.
[2:04:18] Oh
[2:04:20] Lord,
[2:04:24] come by here.
[2:04:30] Oh, I love you, Lord.
[2:04:36] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:04:42] All my days
[2:04:45] I've been held in your hands.
[2:04:50] From the moment that I wake up
[2:04:55] until I lay my hands,
[2:05:00] I will sing
[2:05:03] of the goodness
[2:05:05] of God.
[2:05:11] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:05:20] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:05:29] With every breath that I am able,
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:36] I will sing
[2:05:39] of the goodness
[2:05:41] of God.
[2:05:45] I love your voice.
[2:05:50] You have led me through the fire
[2:05:56] in darkest night.
[2:06:00] You are close like no other.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Like no other.
[2:06:05] Hallelujah.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; I've known you as a father.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; I've known you as my father.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; I've known and I've also known you as a
[2:06:13] friend of my closest friend. And I have
[2:06:17] hallelujah in the good.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Some of you be willing to come up and
[2:06:23] stand around these up around the altars.
[2:06:25] Just pray for them.
[2:06:27] All my life you have been faithful.
[2:06:32] Oh yes you have.
[2:06:34] Hallelujah.
[2:06:36] All my life you have been so good.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Lord God, you been so good.
[2:06:45] Every breath that I
[2:06:51] Oh, I will sing.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; I will sing our goodness.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Just pray
[2:07:00] for one another. Pray for one another.
[2:07:02] Bear your one burden. So the scripture
[2:07:05] tells us, "Oh, thank you, Father.
[2:07:08] Minister, Lord Jesus, to your children,
[2:07:10] Lord. Oh Lord, that they be a deck on
[2:07:13] this desert journey and they're weary,
[2:07:16] Lord, that feel downrodden and downcast.
[2:07:19] Oh Lord, lift your children tonight,
[2:07:21] Father. Bring healing, bring
[2:07:23] encouragement, Lord, whatever they have
[2:07:25] need of, Lord, in their walk tonight in
[2:07:27] their journey on this camel train. Grant
[2:07:30] it, Father, we pray.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we believe you
[2:07:35] have everything we have need of. Praise
[2:07:38] God.
[2:07:40] We worship you tonight, Father. We bless
[2:07:42] your name, Lord Jesus. Oh, thank you,
[2:07:45] Lord.
[2:07:47] Oh, praise the Lord.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; All my life,
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; all my life, you have been so so
[2:07:54] good.
[2:07:58] Every breath that I
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; I make
[2:08:05] I will
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to sing of the goodness
[2:08:10] of my God.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you Lord.
[2:08:16] Your goodness is running.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; It's running.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; It's running after us, Lord. Oh, let it
[2:08:23] chase us down. Jesus is running. You're
[2:08:27] healing. You encourage me, your
[2:08:28] deliverance, Lord, whatever we need.
[2:08:31] Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
[2:08:33] all the days of my life. And I will run
[2:08:36] in the house of the Lord forever.
[2:08:38] Everything everything.
[2:08:42] Your goodness is running after
[2:08:46] running after me.
[2:08:50] Praise God. Oh my hallelujah.
[2:08:55] We worship you tonight, Jesus. We bless
[2:08:58] your name, Father.
[2:09:00] Thank you. All my life, you have been
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; You have been so good, Lord.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; So good.
[2:09:10] Every breath that I make,
[2:09:16] I will sing. I'm going to sing the
[2:09:20] goodness
[2:09:22] of God.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Praise your holy name, Lord Jesus. We
[2:09:29] worship you, Lord. Let's just lift our
[2:09:31] hands together, can we? Oh, thank you,
[2:09:33] Lord. Or children, aren't you glad you
[2:09:36] responded and said the right thing? I
[2:09:38] will go.
[2:09:40] I will go. Now, we might need to update
[2:09:44] it a little bit. I'm still going and I'm
[2:09:47] keeping on going and I'll never turn
[2:09:50] back. There'll be no turning back.
[2:09:56] Be no turning back.
[2:10:00] Be no turning back.
[2:10:04] Be no turning back. I have decided to
[2:10:10] follow Jesus. I have decided to follow
[2:10:15] my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus.
[2:10:21] I have decided to follow my Lord. No
[2:10:25] turning.
[2:10:27] No turning back. Come on, help me sing
[2:10:29] it out.
[2:10:31] No turning back. No turning. Keep
[2:10:36] turning back.
[2:10:40] No turning back. The cross before me.
[2:10:44] The world behind me. The cross before
[2:10:48] me. The world behind me. The cross
[2:10:52] before me. The world behind me. The
[2:10:55] cross before me. The world behind me. No
[2:11:00] turning.
[2:11:01] No turning back.
[2:11:06] No turning back. Oh,
[2:11:10] no turning back.
[2:11:14] No turning back. I have decided to
[2:11:19] follow Jesus. I have decided to follow
[2:11:24] my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus.
[2:11:30] I have decided to follow my Lord. No
[2:11:34] turning.
[2:11:36] No turning back. No turning.
[2:11:41] [Music]
[2:11:42] He No turning.
[2:11:45] No turning back.
[2:11:49] No turning back.
[2:11:54] Now you white folks do a pretty good job
[2:11:57] singing that song. But let me just tell
[2:11:58] you something right now. And me and
[2:12:00] Carol stood in South Africa several
[2:12:02] years ago when I first heard that song.
[2:12:05] And black brothers and sisters there in
[2:12:07] South Africa, they can sing that song.
[2:12:10] Oh my. And this is one thing they do. Be
[2:12:14] no turning back. And they put their
[2:12:17] whole body into it. They do their hands
[2:12:19] like this. Be no turning back. Oh, I
[2:12:22] don't expect some of you white people to
[2:12:24] do it. You save all that for soccer. And
[2:12:27] you save all that for baseball and
[2:12:30] football and basketball.
[2:12:33] Amen.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all scream your lungs out at
[2:12:37] some kind of bunch of nonsense like that
[2:12:38] and come to church and stand there like
[2:12:40] a bump on a pickle. Shame on you.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus wants your emotions like he does
[2:12:47] your heart and your soul. He wants
[2:12:49] everything about you.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Will you say, "I'll go.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; You let him have your emotions.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; What about your tears?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; What about your excitement?" the pro.
[2:13:01] You say, "Now wait a minute, brother
[2:13:02] Don. You're going Pentecostal." So, no,
[2:13:04] I'm going to mighty God unveiled before
[2:13:07] us in Philadelphia 1964. Same kind of
[2:13:09] people with the same experience, with
[2:13:11] the same emotion, acting the same way
[2:13:14] they did on the day of Pentecost. I'm
[2:13:16] also going to shreport 1965 at Invisible
[2:13:19] Union. There's only one way them acts
[2:13:21] 238 youngans act, screaming, hollering,
[2:13:24] shouting.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Are we Acts 238 younganss?
[2:13:29] All right, let's sing it together now.
[2:13:31] One more time before we go, brother.
[2:13:34] Let's sing it one more time before we
[2:13:35] go, shall we? God bless you, Rebecca.
[2:13:38] Are you on your way?
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Are you happy you're gone or are you
[2:13:41] still looking back? Say, I wish I'd
[2:13:43] stayed at mama's house. Are you happy
[2:13:45] you're going?
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; I will go and I ain't turning back. Be
[2:13:50] no turning. Pick it up a little bit. Oh,
[2:13:53] be no turning back.
[2:13:57] No turning back.
[2:14:01] No turning back. I have decided to
[2:14:05] follow Jesus. I have decided to follow
[2:14:10] my Lord. I have decided to follow Jesus.
[2:14:15] I have decided to follow my Lord. No
[2:14:19] turning. Keep turning back.
[2:14:24] Ain't no turning back. Hallelujah.
[2:14:28] Ain't no turning back.
[2:14:32] No turning back. I have decided to
[2:14:36] follow the message. I have decided. It's
[2:14:40] Christ my Lord. I have decided to follow
[2:14:44] the message. I have decided. Reveals
[2:14:48] Christ my Lord. No turning.
[2:14:51] No turning back. I can't go back to
[2:14:54] Pentecost.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; You can't go back to Luther. You can't
[2:14:58] go back to Baptist. Christ is the word.
[2:15:03] Amen.
[2:15:05] I have decided to follow Jesus. I have
[2:15:10] decided to follow my Lord. I have
[2:15:14] decided to follow Jesus. I have decided
[2:15:19] to follow my Lord.

[2:15:31] Turning back.
[2:15:34] Keep turning back.
[2:15:47] And this is what made it possible.
[2:15:51] Amazing.
[2:15:55] [Music]
[2:15:58] Grace,
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:02] how sweet
[2:16:07] the sound
[2:16:11] that save
[2:16:16] a rich
[2:16:20] like
[2:16:21] me.
[2:16:30] I once
[2:16:34] was all
[2:16:37] [Music]
[2:16:39] but now
[2:16:43] I'm so found. So found, so found. Was
[2:16:49] blind,
[2:16:52] but now
[2:16:56] I
[2:16:59] see.
[2:17:08] Heavenly Father,
[2:17:10] we thank you for grace tonight.
[2:17:15] Rebecca, no doubt it was her first
[2:17:18] experience of grace on this measure.
[2:17:24] Something overwhelmed her.
[2:17:28] Something beyond her nature.
[2:17:31] Something beyond her learning.
[2:17:34] something beyond her heritage of her
[2:17:36] family,
[2:17:38] a supernatural presence from an angel of
[2:17:41] God
[2:17:43] that met her about 30 minutes before
[2:17:45] Eleaser got there and already prepared
[2:17:48] her heart.
[2:17:50] Lord Jesus, we thank you tonight. I
[2:17:54] believe that every bride member standing
[2:17:56] here present and the rest of those
[2:17:59] around the world have had a similar
[2:18:01] experience.
[2:18:03] It was more than just hearing some
[2:18:05] verses in the scriptures, more than
[2:18:07] hearing some miracles performed by a
[2:18:10] servant of God. It was a supernatural
[2:18:13] call.
[2:18:15] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:18:18] We are told that Solomon was out
[2:18:20] venturing into his kingdom one day and
[2:18:24] he had been to different parts of his
[2:18:25] kingdom, but he had never been to this
[2:18:27] particular part
[2:18:30] and Shunum.
[2:18:32] And when he went there, he saw this
[2:18:35] lovely little lady.
[2:18:39] She wasn't as beautiful maybe as some of
[2:18:42] the other women that he had in his court
[2:18:45] because she said she was black and she
[2:18:48] was clumly.
[2:18:50] As a matter of fact, we know that she
[2:18:52] had been mistreated in her family and
[2:18:55] left to take care of the sheep. It was a
[2:18:57] great great prize of the women of that
[2:18:59] day to be fairs skinned and liked. In
[2:19:02] order to do that, they would have to
[2:19:03] stay out of the sun.
[2:19:07] But this little lady had lots of days in
[2:19:10] the sun.
[2:19:12] So it had darkened her skin.
[2:19:15] But she stole Solomon's heart
[2:19:20] and he fell in love at first sight.
[2:19:24] Praise God.
[2:19:27] Oh Jesus,
[2:19:29] we're so glad that we also
[2:19:32] have got a son of man tan.
[2:19:35] We don't believe in stripping our
[2:19:37] clothes off and laying naked out on a
[2:19:39] beach like a lizard on a sand pile. But
[2:19:41] we do believe in laying in the presence
[2:19:44] of the sun till all the greenness is
[2:19:47] baked out of us.
[2:19:50] Oh, the world may consider us black or
[2:19:53] faulty or whatever they wish to say, but
[2:19:56] you look at us and say, "I loved you
[2:19:59] before the foundation of the world.
[2:20:03] And I gave you a part of me which would
[2:20:07] help you through your entire life's
[2:20:10] journey."
[2:20:12] Your prophet said, "Many of you can
[2:20:14] fellowship with me on this thought."
[2:20:17] There was something even in you when you
[2:20:20] were a child
[2:20:22] that made you long for God. Even when
[2:20:26] others would do this or that or go this
[2:20:28] way or that way, there's something about
[2:20:29] it. And he said that laid in you then.
[2:20:34] We did not become children when we
[2:20:37] received the word. We did not become
[2:20:40] children when we received the spirit. We
[2:20:43] were children was the reason we could
[2:20:46] receive the spirit.
[2:20:49] We love you, father.
[2:20:52] Go with us now tonight, Lord. Protect
[2:20:54] us. Watch over us. Bring us back again
[2:20:57] Sunday if it be pleasing to you.
[2:21:00] Go with us now in Jesus name.
[2:21:03] Praise the Lord.
[2:21:06] How many can say it's been good to be in
[2:21:08] the house of the Lord?
[2:21:11] Praise the Lord. And when the battle's
[2:21:15] over, we shall wear a crown.
[2:21:20] We shall wear a crown. Oh, we shall wear
[2:21:24] a crown, my brother. When the battle's
[2:21:28] over,
[2:21:29] we shall wear a crown. In that new
[2:21:34] Jerusalem,
[2:21:37] we'll wear a crown.
[2:21:40] We'll wear a crown.
[2:21:44] We're a bright and shining
[2:21:48] crown.
[2:21:51] And when the battle's over, we shall
[2:21:55] wear a crown in that new Jerusalem
[2:22:12] [Music]
[2:22:15] in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[2:22:22] in that new Jerusale
[2:22:31] [Music]
[2:22:36] and shining
[2:22:38] crown.
[2:22:41] And when the battle's over, we shall
[2:22:46] wear a crown in that new Jerusalem.
[2:22:53] We'll wear a crown.
[2:22:57] Wear a crown.
[2:23:00] Wear a bright and shining crown.
[2:23:06] And when the battle's over, we shall
[2:23:11] wear a crown in that new Jerusalem.
[2:23:18] We'll wear a crown.
[2:23:22] Wear a crown.
[2:23:25] We're bright and shining
[2:23:29] ground.
[2:23:32] And when the battle's over,
[2:23:35] we shall wear crown in that new J.
[2:23:43] We wear crown.
[2:23:47] Wear a crown.
[2:23:50] Wear a bright and shiny crown.
[2:23:57] And when the battle's over, we shall
[2:24:01] wear a crown in that new Jerusale.
