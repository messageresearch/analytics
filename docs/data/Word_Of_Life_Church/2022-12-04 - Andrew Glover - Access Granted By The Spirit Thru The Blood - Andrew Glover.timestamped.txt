[29:23] happy happy that we can be here
[29:26] in this place that we've set aside to be
[29:28] able to Worship the Lord I'm sure the
[29:31] Devils will be glad whenever we've got
[29:32] our own place because they're just
[29:34] trying to figure out what in the world
[29:35] is going on here on Holiday Inn well as
[29:38] long as we're here this is our place
[29:42] we're just thanking God for it but we're
[29:44] believing the Lord that he's going to
[29:46] help us to be able to get our new place
[29:47] done and we can have our own place back
[29:50] nothing like being at home are they
[29:53] we're so blessed today for brother
[29:54] Andrew to be with us and we just want to
[29:57] open our hearts I know all of you have
[29:58] needs Desires in your heart things you
[30:00] need from the Lord so we just want to
[30:03] ask him to help us
[30:04] speak to us no matter what you need it
[30:07] doesn't really matter you may look at
[30:09] your need compared to others you think
[30:11] it's so small but I'm so glad the Lord
[30:14] doesn't categorize things in that way
[30:16] heard from several last night and this
[30:18] morning that are dealing with sickness
[30:20] and flu and this and that and the other
[30:22] so we certainly want to remember
[30:23] different ones that can't be here today
[30:25] but we know that our Lord is so mindful
[30:29] for many of you that maybe haven't heard
[30:32] but eugenius back in the Hospice place
[30:35] over near in Bristol there near the
[30:37] Bristol Medical Center Lord willing with
[30:39] Andrew and I'll be going to see him
[30:40] today and if the Lord doesn't move for
[30:43] him this may be our brothers going home
[30:45] time
[30:49] the family as well that the Lord had
[30:51] just
[30:52] had just been comfortable he told me the
[30:54] other day when I went to see him he said
[30:57] I didn't really want to come here
[30:58] hospice he said I don't want nobody to
[31:01] think I've lost faith
[31:04] and I said brother Eugene I don't know
[31:07] of anyone
[31:08] that would think that about you you have
[31:11] been faithful you fought a good fight
[31:13] you've kept the faith that's what we
[31:16] believe in amen so if it is time for our
[31:19] brother to go home
[31:21] it'll be one of the happiest funerals
[31:23] that I've ever preached in my life
[31:26] yeah you know why
[31:29] because his battle his rage going on day
[31:33] after day hour after hour
[31:37] I laid my hand over on his knee the
[31:39] other night as I was standing by his bed
[31:42] and his knee was about the size of my
[31:44] elbow and my arm
[31:49] it looks so pitiful why could we not
[31:52] rejoice
[31:54] are just beyond this life is a body that
[31:57] he'll never be sick again never be weary
[32:00] never be tired it'll be a great
[32:03] homecoming I don't think it's going to
[32:05] be long we'll all be gathered together
[32:06] anyway
[32:08] so just remember them if you would let's
[32:10] just pray together we're going to ask
[32:12] for them to come out and just give us
[32:14] what the Lord's placed on his heart how
[32:16] many has the need to request from your
[32:17] heart today you'd like to be remembered
[32:19] God bless you
[32:21] heavenly father is we
[32:24] stand here on this side of the Veil
[32:27] the way we look at deaths and
[32:30] the resurrection and all that lays
[32:33] before us
[32:34] there's still an element of uncertainty
[32:36] to us
[32:37] and we don't know exactly what it's like
[32:41] someone asked me the other day is there
[32:43] pain in the Rapture will we hurt what
[32:47] will happen
[32:48] I couldn't rightly answer them because I
[32:51] don't know for sure myself
[32:53] but I know it'll be in a moment in a
[32:55] twinkling of an eye
[32:57] even for deaths when a child of God goes
[33:01] we know that you send someone down to
[33:03] the river Force
[33:05] so we're praying Lord that if this is
[33:07] our brother's time that you'll be
[33:08] mindful of him and
[33:10] Sister Janet his sons family church
[33:12] family
[33:13] Lord these other needs and requests as I
[33:16] mentioned hearing from several in the
[33:18] last couple of days some of the flu some
[33:20] with coveted some with after effects of
[33:22] this and that and the other but we pray
[33:24] that it should be mindful of us all
[33:26] today Jesus someone just telling me just
[33:28] a little bit ago that doctors are saying
[33:31] there's six different viruses that are
[33:33] going around right now that's besides
[33:34] flu and covid so certainly the devil's
[33:37] on a rampage but we believe in all hell
[33:40] goes to breaking loose all Heaven comes
[33:43] down
[33:44] so we're just believing you to manifest
[33:46] yourself and if we can look at it right
[33:48] these things we go through are
[33:51] opportunities of Faith by which the
[33:53] supernatural can manifest itself
[33:56] we've gathered here today Lord and we've
[33:58] come to worship to sing to pray to
[34:01] praise no doubt different needs maybe
[34:04] some are discouraged some are weary but
[34:06] whatever every person your needs today
[34:09] we believe that you are more than Able
[34:12] by now they've already met in Uganda all
[34:16] kinds of little churches all over the
[34:18] countries in the cities they've already
[34:20] met in Kenya they've met in Europe
[34:22] they've met in England they've met in
[34:24] Norway New Zealand Australia many of
[34:28] them have met around the world and part
[34:30] of them now are streaming us
[34:32] because we're several hours behind them
[34:35] so they've already testified that you
[34:37] was in their service today so Lord God
[34:40] We Believe on this one's over we'll be
[34:42] able to testify the same
[34:45] come today Father we ask that you would
[34:47] anoint our brother help him to get out
[34:49] of the way speak to us the words of life
[34:53] we love you today Jesus
[34:55] help us now fathers we open our hearts
[34:58] to the word of God
[35:01] and the Saints said amen let's sing
[35:03] together he touched me
[35:06] praise the Lord
[35:07] no matter whether you need a physical
[35:09] touch a spiritual touch whatever you
[35:12] need it all comes basically the same way
[35:14] I've been listening to a sermon preached
[35:17] in Chicago in 1961 called getting in the
[35:21] spirit
[35:22] and it's a wonderful message if you
[35:24] haven't heard it in a while and brother
[35:26] Brandon was talking about faith and our
[35:29] needs and the things that we have need
[35:31] of and he said many people tried to
[35:34] reach for orchid Faith Orchid Orchid the
[35:38] beautiful flower you know what an orchid
[35:39] is he said they try to reach for orchid
[35:43] faiths but he said the faith that you
[35:47] need is just the common everyday weed
[35:51] face
[35:52] because hyssop was a weed that growed
[35:56] out of the walls it growed out of rocks
[35:59] it just growed everywhere so we like and
[36:02] face to being like a weed he said the
[36:05] faith you need is the exact same face
[36:07] that you start your car with
[36:13] that you get in your car and you go
[36:16] somewhere so what do we all do after
[36:17] church we'll get our keys and maybe your
[36:20] car doesn't have even an ignition
[36:21] anymore a lot of them don't they just
[36:23] got a button but you still got to have
[36:24] your thing there with you and what do
[36:26] you do by face you reach and push the
[36:29] button or by faith you put the key and
[36:31] the ignition I thought how simple and he
[36:34] said people are trying to reach out for
[36:36] that when all you need is weed face
[36:41] isn't that wonderful
[36:43] but remember the devil's got his weed
[36:45] killer
[36:47] and he'll try to kill that faith of
[36:49] yours and make you think you ain't got
[36:51] it but you know the very same faith that
[36:54] helps you get up every day get you out
[36:56] of the bed start your car does this or
[36:59] that it's that common it's not some
[37:01] great something that I've got to reach
[37:03] way out yonder somewhere it's just
[37:05] common everyday phase
[37:08] so let's reach out to him today was the
[37:11] faith that is growing out of the cracks
[37:13] of your walls

[40:46] more for us than any doctor or
[40:49] psychologist or a lawyer Amen to be
[40:52] touched by him this morning would change
[40:54] everything
[40:55] amen we say God bless you all this
[40:57] morning I feel the spirit of the Lord
[40:59] here among us today don't you amen I
[41:02] believe he's brought us together for a
[41:03] purpose and that is to reveal himself to
[41:05] us and amen to manifest himself in our
[41:07] midst and we want to greet you all this
[41:09] morning in the name of the Lord and it's
[41:11] sure good to see everyone out this
[41:12] morning in the house of God I know
[41:13] there's a lot of sickness going around
[41:15] and things but Amen to see those of you
[41:18] that can be here this morning we amen
[41:20] have come under expectation amen and if
[41:22] you have your Bibles today we'll go
[41:24] straight to the word we want to read a
[41:26] few places in the New Testament we want
[41:28] to look in the Book of Romans
[41:29] the fifth chapter and while you're
[41:32] turning there this morning I want to
[41:33] greet you on behalf of our pastor
[41:35] brother Sean Martin and the Saints there
[41:37] at Faith Tabernacle in Blacksburg
[41:39] Virginia send their greetings to you I
[41:41] know uh brother Terry and brother Amos
[41:43] would want us to be sure and greet you
[41:44] all for them this morning so we say God
[41:47] bless you from them and we want to say
[41:48] we appreciate brother Donnie and his
[41:50] friendship and that's always an honor to
[41:52] be here and to come back home and to see
[41:55] all the folks here and to be with
[41:56] brother Donnie we say God bless you and
[41:58] appreciate you and you stand for this
[42:00] word and amen I know you all are under
[42:02] anticipation for that new building any
[42:04] day amen so but we just want to look
[42:07] here this morning in the Book of Romans
[42:09] the fifth chapter I want to look in the
[42:12] first verse
[42:14] Paul here writing says therefore
[42:17] being justified by faith
[42:19] we have peace with God through our Lord
[42:22] Jesus Christ
[42:24] but whom also we have access somebody
[42:27] say access
[42:28] by faith into this grace wherein we
[42:32] stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[42:34] glory of God
[42:36] now Paul uses a word there access that
[42:40] I've been looking at and if we could
[42:41] turn to Ephesians of the second chapter
[42:44] Ephesians the second chapter and I want
[42:47] to look there in the 18th verse of
[42:50] Ephesians 2 he'll use this same word
[42:54] again in Ephesians 2 and verse 18. he
[42:58] says
[42:58] for through him we both have access
[43:02] by one's Spirit now in Romans 5 he said
[43:05] we had access by faith now he says we
[43:07] have access by one Spirit unto the
[43:10] father and if we could look at one other
[43:13] chapter the third chapter in the 11th
[43:16] verse of Ephesians Paul again uses that
[43:19] word again of access and in the 11th
[43:22] verse he says according to the Eternal
[43:25] purpose how many is thankful to be
[43:26] called by the Eternal purpose which he
[43:29] has purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in
[43:33] whom we have boldness and access with
[43:37] confidence by the faith of him so now he
[43:41] has added boldness and confidence to
[43:44] this access amen let's just buy our
[43:46] hearts together I mean say Lord speak to
[43:49] me this morning
[43:50] amen Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our
[43:53] hearts before you this morning and
[43:55] humble our Spirits in your presence we
[43:57] are very well aware this morning that we
[44:00] are not here by ourselves
[44:01] but Lord there is a host of angels
[44:03] that's in this building today Lord there
[44:06] is an unseen force of the supernatural
[44:08] that his Lord assembled here is these
[44:10] Believers have assembled here now father
[44:13] as we join our faith together this
[44:15] morning and we have opened your word and
[44:17] Lord with physical strength we have
[44:18] turned the pages Lord with the natural
[44:21] ability of our eyes we've been able to
[44:23] read what the what the word says upon
[44:25] the page but father we're now inviting
[44:27] your spirit to come into this meeting
[44:29] Lord may you take Supreme control may
[44:32] you take preeminence among us today and
[44:34] Lord May the spiritual strength of God
[44:36] come into every heart and every life
[44:38] Lord that father you could open up what
[44:40] we're reading and it could be more than
[44:42] just a sermon it could be more than a
[44:44] few quotes and scriptures but Lord it
[44:46] could become Revelation it could become
[44:48] substance in the lives of these
[44:49] Believers now Lord I pray this morning
[44:51] you would send the spirit of Revelation
[44:53] to the meeting and Lord may you drive
[44:55] out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy
[44:57] Spirit Lord while the word is going
[44:58] forth May healing take place in bodies
[45:01] Lord why while the word has gone forth
[45:03] May Deliverance take place father for
[45:05] those that are at home this morning Lord
[45:07] sick in their bodies Lord even Lord
[45:09] those in our own family Lord my
[45:11] grandmother in other words I pray this
[45:12] morning that your grace as your word
[45:14] would go forth would just touch them
[45:16] Lord and he would raise him up father
[45:17] for Lord You're Still A Healer and Lord
[45:20] we'll be sure to give you all the praise
[45:22] all the honor and all the glory for it's
[45:24] in the wonderful name of our savior the
[45:26] Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[45:29] believer says
[45:30] amen and amen God bless you this morning
[45:33] as you can have your seats here this
[45:35] morning I want to by the help of the
[45:37] Lord to take care for a few moments and
[45:39] just share a few things and pray that
[45:41] the Lord will give us the ability to
[45:43] maybe draw you into the thoughts that
[45:45] have been upon our heart but I want to
[45:47] speak to you by the help of the Lord on
[45:48] access
[45:49] granted by the spirit through the blood
[45:53] access granted by the spirit through the
[45:56] blood I was listening to a tape the
[45:58] other day and the prophet of God says
[45:59] this in 1953 how the angel come to me he
[46:02] said our heavenly father we come tonight
[46:04] to worship thee how many has come to
[46:07] worship him today he said and we're
[46:09] thankful for the opportunity that we
[46:11] have of coming he said and through this
[46:13] channel of the Holy Spirit which has
[46:15] been bought by the blood of Jesus Christ
[46:18] that we have access to the throne of
[46:21] grace through the name of Jesus and
[46:23] we're so happy for it amen he said
[46:26] through this channel of the Holy Spirit
[46:27] which has been bought by the blood of
[46:30] Jesus Christ we have access to the
[46:33] throne of grace through the name of
[46:35] Jesus and we're so happy for it tonight
[46:37] I I truly believe that our access to God
[46:40] this morning amen is through the spirit
[46:43] and it comes by the blood of Jesus
[46:45] Christ now when you start looking at
[46:47] this word access Webster says it is a
[46:50] means of approaching or entering a place
[46:52] it is the right or the opportunity to
[46:55] use or to benefit from something it is
[46:57] the right or the opportunity to approach
[47:00] or to see someone so if you have access
[47:02] then you have benefits if you have
[47:04] access then you have rights if you have
[47:07] access then you actually are entitled
[47:09] Amen to go into what one is Desiring to
[47:12] go into and I find it amazing that in
[47:14] the age we're living in that people are
[47:16] always trying to find amen the easiest
[47:18] way to access something you know I'll
[47:21] say it to you like this the age that
[47:22] we're living in amen it has become
[47:24] easier than any other age to access
[47:26] certain things you know uh you think
[47:29] just maybe here on the natural side for
[47:31] a minute amen maybe 20 30 years ago if
[47:34] you wanted to see a movie or you wanted
[47:35] to see something you had to go to the
[47:37] movie theater had to go to the store had
[47:39] to amen but now amen to the advancement
[47:42] of Technology we're now carrying cell
[47:44] phones and then that access to these
[47:46] things have been made easier than ever
[47:48] before now amen I know that you've all
[47:50] heard it said we probably maybe even
[47:52] said it ourselves said our young people
[47:54] today have access to more sin and
[47:56] ungodliness and wickedness and amen
[47:58] corruption and things of perversion than
[48:00] any generation before and that is true
[48:02] because of the access that has been
[48:04] granted by technology they no longer
[48:06] have to go to the store to buy a dirty
[48:09] magazine but now on a little cell phone
[48:11] amen you can access ten times worse than
[48:14] what they were accessing 20 years ago
[48:16] Amen in a in a store but amen I'm not
[48:19] one that likes to leave things on the
[48:20] negative but let's bring that to the
[48:22] positive if this generation amen has
[48:25] more access to ungodliness and
[48:26] wickedness then I propose to you this
[48:28] morning amen that there is a group of
[48:30] young people on the face of the Earth
[48:32] that has more access to the things of
[48:34] God than any generation before them you
[48:37] say how can you say that because now
[48:39] according to what a prophet taught we
[48:41] now have access Amen to the full word in
[48:45] the Book of Revelation the 10th chapter
[48:46] the first verse you know what by heart
[48:48] it says I saw another Mighty Angel come
[48:51] down from heaven amen and he was clothed
[48:53] with a cloud out and a rainbow was up on
[48:55] his head and his face as it were the Sun
[48:57] and his feet his pillars of fire now you
[48:59] know Revelation 10 1 was none other than
[49:02] the mighty Angel Jesus Christ the angel
[49:04] of the Covenant you come to Revelation
[49:07] 10 7 and it says in the days of the
[49:09] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[49:12] begin to sound amen the mystery of God
[49:14] should be finished as he have declared
[49:16] to his servants the prophets so amen
[49:19] without Revelation 10 1 we do not have
[49:22] Revelation 10 7. amen because Revelation
[49:25] 10 1 the mighty Angel which was Christ
[49:27] amen was delivering to the seventh angel
[49:30] a message and that message amen was not
[49:33] a bunch of opinions it was not a bunch
[49:34] of Creeds it was not a bunch of dogmas
[49:36] it was not a furtherance a religious
[49:39] tradition amen but that message was the
[49:42] full word the prophet of God said the
[49:44] last message of the last Church age is
[49:46] not a reformer he is a prophet not a
[49:49] reformer amen because the word of the
[49:51] Lord comes to the prophet that that's
[49:53] the reason that they could continue on
[49:55] in baptism and father son Holy Ghost and
[49:58] all these other things because they were
[49:59] reformers and not prophets they were
[50:01] great men of God they saw the need of
[50:03] the day they lived in and got anointed
[50:05] them they sent out there and tore those
[50:07] thanks to Pieces but the full word of
[50:09] God never come to them because they was
[50:12] not prophets so without a prophet we
[50:15] don't have the full word I I know this
[50:17] morning that you all here are very well
[50:18] taught in the message but let me just
[50:20] let me just share my heart with you
[50:21] there has never been a time amen and I
[50:24] believe in all of time to say what a
[50:26] prophet said amending the time that
[50:28] we're living in right now listen our
[50:30] benefits are not coming because of what
[50:32] church we go to they're not coming
[50:34] because of what family line we come out
[50:36] of Amen but the benefits that we are
[50:38] partaking of this morning amen is coming
[50:41] from the message of the hour without
[50:43] this message we are a confused group of
[50:45] people without this message we have no
[50:47] promise of a rapture we have no promise
[50:49] of a resurrection amen but with this
[50:52] message this morning amen all things are
[50:54] possible to them that believe listen I
[50:56] know people say well sometimes amen you
[50:58] say too much about a prophet but let me
[51:00] say this amen if you see who a prophet
[51:02] is you'll see who you are amen if you
[51:05] see that he was Eliezer amen then you'll
[51:07] see that you're Rebecca and if you are
[51:09] Rebecca then you're on your way to me I
[51:11] say amen and if he's not Eliezer amen
[51:14] then you are not Rebecca and you have no
[51:16] hope of sin I say Amen but we are not
[51:19] here as a hopeless helpless amen
[51:21] confused generation this morning we have
[51:23] heard the voice of Eliezer and the voice
[51:26] of Eliezer has opened up the full word
[51:28] in this generation that we can be
[51:30] partakers of it listen this is not a
[51:33] Lutheran age remember Sid this is not a
[51:35] western age he said it's been the same
[51:37] even through this Pentecostal age but at
[51:39] the opening of those Seven Seals
[51:41] Revelation 10 amen the full word is to
[51:44] be born into manifestation again and
[51:47] Vindicated by the spirit of God in the
[51:50] full strength that it was when he was
[51:52] here on Earth manifest invested in the
[51:54] same way doing the same things that it
[51:56] did when it was here on Earth he says
[51:58] what is it it is Hebrews 13 8. it is
[52:00] Jesus Christ the same yesterday amen
[52:03] today and forever among Church what is
[52:06] this full word it is the Fulfillment of
[52:08] Luke 17 30 which set in the days when
[52:11] the son of man amen would be revealed
[52:13] from Heaven amen there would be a body
[52:16] of people upon the Earth that's a
[52:18] revelation of the son of man would be
[52:20] taken preeminence in their flesh listen
[52:22] I'll say it the way the prophet said he
[52:24] that believes not the full word of God
[52:25] is a sinner now what is a sinner a
[52:28] sinner amen is not a sinner because they
[52:30] smoke they are not a sinner because they
[52:32] drink but according to the prophet a
[52:34] sinner is a sinner amen because they
[52:37] disbelieve the word listen if you're
[52:39] going to overcome 200 000 000 Devils
[52:41] it's not going to come through Dr Dobson
[52:43] if you're going to overcome 200 000 000
[52:46] Devils it's not going to come from
[52:48] charismatic influence it's going to come
[52:50] from the full word that has been
[52:52] released in this generation Amen to give
[52:55] you Rapture and Faith to give you
[52:57] overcoming power to give you rapturing
[52:59] favor listen this morning we are not
[53:01] here gathered amen based upon man's
[53:04] ideas but according to Isaiah he said
[53:06] that precept must be upon precept Amen
[53:08] in line must be upon line and here a
[53:11] little and they're a little remember to
[53:12] say when a baby is conceding the womb of
[53:14] a mother when that one cell goes in the
[53:16] air another cell Builds on top of that
[53:18] it's not one cell of a human and the
[53:21] next of a dog and the next of a kind and
[53:23] the next is something else amen from the
[53:26] first sale to the last it's absolutely
[53:28] straight human being he said see and
[53:31] when a man is born of the spirit of God
[53:33] he don't inject anything into his life

[54:18] upon precept she is lying upon line she
[54:21] is weared upon word she is manifesting
[54:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:26] and forever now when I think about this

[54:54] the full word you've got healing and
[54:56] peace and deliverance
[54:58] he that believes not the full word is a
[55:01] sinner now when you look at this full
[55:03] word according to the prophet in the
[55:04] token he said the full obedience Amen to
[55:07] the full word of God is what entitles us
[55:10] to the Token no other way is there that
[55:13] you could ever be entitled to the Token
[55:15] until you fully obey the word you'll
[55:19] never be entitled to the Token until you
[55:22] fully obey the word fully obey what word
[55:25] the full word see not what somebody has
[55:28] put into it or added to it amen but what
[55:31] God has said about it do you realize
[55:33] when a Prophet come on the saying amen
[55:36] man had so injected so many ideas on the
[55:39] way into the things of God Amen they had
[55:41] people with joining churches signing
[55:43] cards putting their name on a church
[55:45] register amen but the full word said
[55:48] amen Jesus first Doctrine was ye must be
[55:51] born again amen all the way amen back in
[55:55] the Book of John the third chapter there
[55:57] was a man by Nicodemus and he said how
[55:59] can I go amen into the father how can I
[56:01] go he said a man must be born again is
[56:05] it okay to preach this morning a man
[56:07] must be born again amen let's say that
[56:09] together you must be born again amen I
[56:12] don't care how revelated we got that's
[56:13] still a principle amen we must be born
[56:16] again and I'll tell you what will fix a
[56:18] lot of our problems just some new births
[56:19] I tell you what'll fix a lot of troubles
[56:21] this new birth amen Creeds and
[56:23] reformations will never change a person
[56:25] amen but a new birth through the water
[56:27] and the blood and the spirit of Jesus
[56:30] Christ will take a sinner and make a Son
[56:32] of God out of him and those churches
[56:34] there's still power in the blood is
[56:36] there still power to take a drunk and
[56:38] make a preacher out of him is there
[56:40] still power to take a young man that is
[56:42] addicted to sin and the things of the
[56:45] world and set them free I say there's
[56:47] still power in the birth of Jesus Christ
[56:50] there's still Power in the Blood of
[56:52] Jesus Christ
[56:54] he said you must be born again that
[56:57] don't mean jump up and down at the altar
[56:59] that don't mean walk back there and
[57:01] shake hands with a pastor that don't
[57:02] mean all this foolishness that we've
[57:04] seen done it means putting it don't mean
[57:06] putting your name on a church book it
[57:08] means Death to Your First being and Life
[57:11] to your second being the new birth is
[57:14] death to the first man and it is life to
[57:16] the second being it means that the blood
[57:19] has been applied and you're identified
[57:22] by the life of Jesus Christ now when you
[57:25] look at this you realize this morning
[57:27] that God Amen has given his believing
[57:29] children amen the promise of access you
[57:33] say what is that promise of access I
[57:35] said to you like this it is that all
[57:37] things that are in Christ amen belong to
[57:40] you and you have access to them
[57:44] all things that are in Christ belong to
[57:47] you and you have access to them how many
[57:50] will agree that in Christ we have all
[57:53] things I love what Paul says he said we
[57:56] he that spared not his own son but
[57:58] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[58:00] not with him also freely amen give us
[58:03] all things then this morning church amen
[58:06] we are not earning all things we are not
[58:09] buying all things amen but Christ amen
[58:12] through his death at Calvary which was a
[58:15] propitiation for our sins amen through
[58:18] the blood we have access to All Things
[58:21] remember say when the word when the work
[58:23] is finished we have all things again
[58:25] what kind of all things he said we have
[58:28] all power we have eternal life we have
[58:31] eternal Health we have eternal youth we
[58:34] have eternal power he said oh we are
[58:36] just Eternal with eternal we are Eternal
[58:41] with the Eternal then this morning
[58:43] church we are not trying to gain access
[58:46] amen but by the shed blood amen every
[58:49] man woman boy and girl amen has got a
[58:52] right by the blood to come into the
[58:55] things of God
[58:57] well the prophet said he said all things
[58:59] are ours now watch this if all things
[59:01] are ours then we have access to all
[59:04] things he said we're not wanting you to
[59:06] join a church I'm asking you this one
[59:08] thing amen we have in common that is
[59:10] Jesus Christ he is in common with us we
[59:13] can all be Baptist so we can't all be
[59:15] methodists we can't all be wonders or
[59:17] threateness or whatever but there's one
[59:19] thing we have in common that is the
[59:21] pardoning offer of God Amen his son
[59:24] Jesus Christ we have all things in him
[59:27] see this morning the Christians he says
[59:30] does not realize amen what God has
[59:33] provided for them many people he said
[59:35] don't realize that the great and
[59:37] glorious Powers amen has been provided
[59:39] for them he said coming into Jesus is
[59:42] like walking the arcade down here at a
[59:44] great big department store if somebody
[59:46] give me a great department store in the
[59:48] arcade and told me this is all yours
[59:50] well the first thing I do I'm going to
[59:53] walk around in there and find out what I
[59:55] own because it was mine he he said and
[59:57] that's the way it is in Christ amen when
[1:00:01] you become a Christian amen walk around
[1:00:03] and find out what is yours what you own
[1:00:06] because all things are yours they are
[1:00:09] given to you freely I don't have I'm on
[1:00:12] church amen how long are some of y'all
[1:00:14] going to sit there and let other people

[1:00:18] blessings and walk around well we might
[1:00:20] as well preach it's Sunday morning amen
[1:00:22] how long you're going to sit there and
[1:00:24] let somebody else walk around in the
[1:00:26] Revelation and walk around in the
[1:00:28] understanding come on if you are a son
[1:00:30] of God if you are a daughter of God then
[1:00:32] your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:34] and by the authority of the word this
[1:00:37] morning you've got every right Amen to
[1:00:40] go in and possess amen when Christ died
[1:00:42] that you can have come on if he said we
[1:00:45] can have joy somebody start walking
[1:00:47] around in it if he say we can have peace
[1:00:50] amen somebody start walking around and
[1:00:52] they said we could have love somebody
[1:00:54] start walking around if they said we can
[1:00:57] have healing and miracles and signs and
[1:00:59] wonders and infallible proofs of his
[1:01:01] resurrection then don't you think it's
[1:01:04] time amen for the church the Living God
[1:01:06] Amen to put your walking shoes on and
[1:01:09] start walking in the blessings
[1:01:12] I'm on Church you know what a prophet's
[1:01:15] head he said footsteps means Possession
[1:01:17] come on footsteps means possession every
[1:01:21] place that the soul of your foot sets
[1:01:23] upon he says that have I given you as a
[1:01:26] possession well glory to God it's time
[1:01:30] to walk around it's time to see what's
[1:01:32] has freely been given to us everything
[1:01:34] that Christ died for is yours every one
[1:01:37] of you and you got a checkbook with
[1:01:39] Jesus name signed across there the
[1:01:42] problem is you're just scared to fill it
[1:01:44] out amen but can I tell you this morning
[1:01:46] there's never been one check amen
[1:01:49] bounced in the kingdom of God there's
[1:01:51] never been one check amen returned
[1:01:54] insufficient funds in the kingdom of God
[1:01:56] you gotta check for your healing you
[1:01:59] gotta check for your prodigals you gotta
[1:02:01] check for your joy you gotta check for
[1:02:03] your health how long are you going to
[1:02:05] sit there and say well someday somehow I
[1:02:08] say this morning I say this hour I say
[1:02:11] this day this time time has come upon
[1:02:14] you to move into the promises that God
[1:02:17] died for you to move into there is only
[1:02:20] one way that we have access and that is
[1:02:22] not by our works that is not by our
[1:02:25] church standing that is not by our
[1:02:26] social standing Paul said amen there is
[1:02:29] one body and there is one spirit and you
[1:02:32] are called in one hope of your calling I
[1:02:35] love what Birmingham says he said let
[1:02:37] that spirit that dominated his body and
[1:02:40] his mind controlled him come into us
[1:02:43] tonight and interpret the word and
[1:02:46] preach the word and give it to our
[1:02:48] Hungry Heart as we wait on him then what
[1:02:51] that tells me is you are the body and he
[1:02:54] is the spirit
[1:02:56] you are the body and he is the spirit
[1:02:59] then the spirit of God is superior to
[1:03:03] all other Spirits there is not one
[1:03:05] spirit that the spirit of God is
[1:03:07] inferior to the spirit of God is
[1:03:10] superior over Rebellion the spirit of
[1:03:13] God is superior over witchcraft the
[1:03:15] spirit of God is superior over cancer
[1:03:17] the spirit of God is superior over
[1:03:20] organization come on Church you know I'm
[1:03:22] telling you the truth amen the spirit of
[1:03:25] God Amen will never be defeated the
[1:03:27] spirit of God will never be overcome
[1:03:29] because that spirit is the spirit that
[1:03:32] was in his body has returned in this
[1:03:34] body and we are living in the age when
[1:03:37] the spirit of God has dominated a body
[1:03:40] and that body is controlled by the word
[1:03:42] and in the only way they go is by the
[1:03:45] word
[1:03:46] you got life this morning you got a body
[1:03:49] you got life in it listen then you're
[1:03:51] moved by a spirit now when you think
[1:03:53] about this we're living in a very odd
[1:03:55] time would you agree with me it's a time
[1:03:57] when the prophet of God said amen that
[1:04:00] men can achieve the greatest thing you
[1:04:02] know what the greatest thing to achieve
[1:04:03] is is life
[1:04:05] remember I said the greatest thing go
[1:04:07] over to Heaven talk to Father Abraham
[1:04:09] he'll tell you the greatest thing there
[1:04:11] is to achieve is life now I want you to
[1:04:13] catch something he says the greatest
[1:04:15] thing we can achieve is life then he
[1:04:17] turns around and says but people are so
[1:04:20] dissatisfied with life he said that they
[1:04:22] are trying to end their life think about
[1:04:25] that amen the very Fang amen that God
[1:04:28] through a prophet told this generation
[1:04:30] they could achieve amen was like and
[1:04:33] then he turns around and says but
[1:04:35] they're so dissatisfied amen with that
[1:04:37] life that they're trying to end their
[1:04:39] life you know I'm telling you the truth
[1:04:40] amen we got superheroes and Superstars
[1:04:43] and Hollywood idols and they've got
[1:04:45] millions up on top of millions up on top
[1:04:47] of billions of dollars and they're
[1:04:49] committing suicide and they're
[1:04:51] overdosing on pills amen they got life
[1:04:53] amen but it's a miserable life they got
[1:04:56] they got all this money they got all
[1:04:59] this wealth amen but in their soul it's
[1:05:02] a cavern that is crying amen for a
[1:05:04] satisfaction and the prophet said
[1:05:06] there's only one way that the human soul
[1:05:08] will ever be satisfied that is not by
[1:05:11] Creeds that is not by traditions and
[1:05:13] it's not by religion it is by the
[1:05:15] sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] the only thing that will ever satisfy
[1:05:23] the craving in a man's heart is the
[1:05:25] blood now when you look at this you
[1:05:27] realize that there's actually two types
[1:05:29] of Life there is a natural life and then
[1:05:32] there is a spiritual life you know how
[1:05:34] the Natural Life comes the Natural Life
[1:05:36] comes through amen what the prophet
[1:05:38] called this sexual blood now you say how
[1:05:41] does the spiritual life come remember
[1:05:43] said the spiritual life comes amen
[1:05:46] through the blood of God I love what
[1:05:48] Paul says he said if in this life only
[1:05:51] we have hope in Christ then we are of
[1:05:53] all men most miserable if in this life
[1:05:56] only thing we have amen is hope we are
[1:05:59] of all men most miserable but any man
[1:06:02] that is in Christ Jesus is a new
[1:06:04] creation he is a new creature amen and
[1:06:07] he's not just living with a natural life
[1:06:10] from a natural father and a natural
[1:06:12] mother oh God have mercy but he is
[1:06:14] living with a spiritual DNA of the
[1:06:17] almighty God oh God
[1:06:20] her own church you're not the Sons and
[1:06:22] Daughters of a pomper you are the sons
[1:06:24] and Ballers of God and your father owns
[1:06:27] the cattle on a thousand hills your
[1:06:30] father walks on water your father turns
[1:06:33] water into wine your father raises the
[1:06:35] dead your father heals cancer your
[1:06:38] father provides I'll tell you what David
[1:06:40] said David said I once was young amen
[1:06:43] but now I'm old and I've never seen the
[1:06:45] righteous forsaken or exceed bacon bread
[1:06:48] then quit living like pompers cause
[1:06:51] you're not one quit living like
[1:06:53] spiritual welfare people cause you're
[1:06:55] not on spiritual welfare you have got a
[1:06:57] God who has got sufficient funds he can
[1:07:00] satisfy whatever your right protect for
[1:07:05] there is no money there is no value in
[1:07:09] that sexual blood but through the blood
[1:07:10] of God are you hearing me the access
[1:07:13] then to eternal life that's not come
[1:07:16] through the sexual blood it does not
[1:07:18] come through the religious blood it
[1:07:21] comes through the perfect blood of
[1:07:23] almighty God when a man's born again it
[1:07:26] won't do any good and he can't be born
[1:07:28] again listen until life comes into him
[1:07:31] are you hearing me he cannot be born
[1:07:34] again until life comes into him now
[1:07:37] watch this I thought you had life I
[1:07:40] thought everybody had life they do but
[1:07:42] the life he's talking about is not the
[1:07:45] natural life it is the spiritual life it
[1:07:48] is the eternal life now he says it like
[1:07:50] this he said now look at how God planned
[1:07:53] that God is the male part that brought
[1:07:55] Jesus Christ here now God is a spirit so
[1:07:59] there couldn't be any sex there couldn't
[1:08:01] be any sexual desire because if it was
[1:08:03] then Jesus wasn't born a virgin birth he
[1:08:07] said so God is a spirit now come on I
[1:08:11] know we've got a lot of kind of preach I
[1:08:14] know we got a lot of religious people
[1:08:15] around us now these intellectuals they
[1:08:17] go around talking about how you can come
[1:08:18] into God and bypass the new birth I'll
[1:08:20] tell you what that is that's a doctrine
[1:08:22] of Cain that was originated in the guard
[1:08:24] of Eden and I've got the guests to take
[1:08:26] a sword to that devil amen because you
[1:08:28] want to put young people in prison tell
[1:08:29] them they can get to God apart from the
[1:08:31] blood you want to put them on a roller
[1:08:33] coaster every day tell them they can get
[1:08:35] in the bride apart from dying out the
[1:08:37] altar come on church I can tell you
[1:08:38] where the Prophet put it in and you show
[1:08:40] me where he took it out amen from 47 to
[1:08:43] 65 it was a new birth it was the blood
[1:08:46] it was a Sanctified and he comes in 1963
[1:08:50] and says now we've come through the
[1:08:52] water age we've come through the blood
[1:08:54] age but now we have come to the Token
[1:08:57] age where the token must be on this
[1:08:59] plane because when the token is on
[1:09:01] display then the Covenant blood comes
[1:09:03] into full effect
[1:09:05] listen I may be the craziest preacher
[1:09:07] you ever heard but I'm going to say it
[1:09:09] this morning without the blood we're on
[1:09:11] our way to Hell Without The Blood where
[1:09:13] everyone condemned without the blood we
[1:09:16] have no future but with the blood this
[1:09:19] morning
[1:09:20] with the blood this morning all things
[1:09:23] are possible
[1:09:25] I'm on now everyone you're sitting here
[1:09:27] this morning including myself
[1:09:29] well let's just say what the Bible said
[1:09:31] he said you got an evil you got a belly
[1:09:34] button and if you got a belly button you
[1:09:36] was born a renegade
[1:09:37] I don't care what family what church
[1:09:39] what Ministry I don't care what she's
[1:09:41] raised under if you was born with a
[1:09:43] belly button you was born a renegade
[1:09:46] well that's your truth anyhow you might
[1:09:48] as well say amen I don't care how much
[1:09:50] money he had in your bank account he was
[1:09:52] born a renegade now listen that sexual
[1:09:54] blood is what condemns us that sexual
[1:09:57] blood is what keeps us out of the things
[1:10:00] of God you know why because in that
[1:10:03] sexual blood amen come traits in that
[1:10:06] blood amen things it was in Generations
[1:10:08] amen 10 Generations ago has been passed
[1:10:11] down through that sexual blood and you
[1:10:14] amen through your first birth become a
[1:10:17] victim to what was in your family
[1:10:18] lineage for years now you know amen a
[1:10:21] few years ago they actually said that
[1:10:22] alcoholism amen was not an actual it was
[1:10:25] not an actual recreational problem it
[1:10:27] was actually a trait that had been
[1:10:29] passed down through generations because
[1:10:31] one grandfather then the next
[1:10:33] grandfather then the father then the son
[1:10:35] and that alcohol trait was passed down
[1:10:38] listen when you was born you come here
[1:10:40] according to a prophet without a
[1:10:43] Fighting Chance
[1:10:44] we everyone come here without a fighting
[1:10:48] chance so we were born amen victims to
[1:10:51] our bloodline we were born victims to
[1:10:54] whatever was in our family tree amen
[1:10:56] would come upon us and there wasn't one
[1:10:58] thing we could do about it we couldn't
[1:11:00] bargain with the doctor we couldn't
[1:11:02] bargain with her mother we couldn't
[1:11:03] bargain with our father amen because it
[1:11:06] was a blood amen it was automatically
[1:11:08] passed down
[1:11:10] now come on Church in that blood was a
[1:11:13] fallen nature and listen I don't care
[1:11:15] how beautiful that little baby is before
[1:11:18] long give it time that baby will display
[1:11:20] or he will manifest that Fallen nature
[1:11:23] because he was brought here amen through
[1:11:26] a blood which was a sexual blood which
[1:11:28] goes all the way back to Genesis which
[1:11:30] separated God and man right so that
[1:11:34] child will eventually he will eventually
[1:11:36] manifest that fall of nature now watch
[1:11:39] this when he gets older he'll begin to
[1:11:41] hear about the things of God they'll
[1:11:43] begin to they'll begin to get around the
[1:11:45] things of God and they'll say my I wish
[1:11:47] I could go into that I wish I could be a
[1:11:49] partaker then I wish I could access that
[1:11:52] I wish I could have that blessing are
[1:11:53] you with me amen amen and before long
[1:11:55] they'll begin to feel condemned amen
[1:11:58] because of what is heaped upon them amen
[1:12:01] through the sexual blood listen amen
[1:12:03] there's boys amen that are that are 15
[1:12:05] 16 years old and they go in a store and
[1:12:08] somebody treats them a different way you
[1:12:09] know why but because I know who that
[1:12:11] boy's daddy is and they're holding it
[1:12:13] against that boy because that boy is Of
[1:12:16] The Bloodline of his of his daddy but
[1:12:19] can I turn a corner now and say what a
[1:12:21] prophet said he said God is a spirit and
[1:12:24] he overshadowed this marriage and
[1:12:26] created and heard the blood cell that
[1:12:28] brought forth the Son of God and it's
[1:12:30] through his holy blood that we have
[1:12:33] access to life
[1:12:35] through the sexual blood we had access
[1:12:38] to a perverted life we had access to a
[1:12:41] natural life but through the blood of
[1:12:43] the almighty God which was a created
[1:12:45] blood which comes from a blood cell
[1:12:47] through that blood we have access to
[1:12:50] life are you ready for this and the
[1:12:52] prophet said in our sexual blood is
[1:12:55] dismissed
[1:12:57] well glory to God our sexual blood is
[1:13:01] dismissed come on church then this
[1:13:04] morning you don't have to stay out of
[1:13:06] the things of God by your sexual blood
[1:13:09] you can't come in by your first birth
[1:13:11] you can't come in but by the second
[1:13:14] birth
[1:13:15] glory to God by the second birth through
[1:13:18] the blood of God by the blood cell of
[1:13:20] God you have been given access into the
[1:13:24] promises of God into the Forgiveness of
[1:13:26] God oh my we have the blood of Jesus
[1:13:28] Christ that stands for an atonement for
[1:13:31] our sins that we are not saved he says
[1:13:34] by our sexual blood we are saved by the
[1:13:37] creative blood by God's own blood
[1:13:40] himself look what Paul says in Romans 5
[1:13:43] 10 for if when we were enemies we were
[1:13:46] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:13:49] son much more being reconciled we shall
[1:13:52] be saved by his life I'm on church where
[1:13:56] was that life coming from it was coming
[1:13:58] out of the blood and where was that
[1:14:00] blood coming from it was not coming from
[1:14:02] a Jew it was not coming from a gentile
[1:14:04] that blood was coming from God it was a
[1:14:07] creative blood
[1:14:09] I wish I was a preacher this morning it
[1:14:12] was a creative blood are you hearing me
[1:14:14] it was a blood that flew your first
[1:14:16] birth there was no way you could possess
[1:14:18] it I'm gonna feel your first birth you
[1:14:20] can come to church seven days a week and
[1:14:23] sit there condemned through your first
[1:14:24] birth you could come to the house of God
[1:14:26] and hear the word and never rise up and
[1:14:29] put a footstep on that promise and a
[1:14:32] footstep on that promise but what if I
[1:14:34] told you this morning that every one of
[1:14:36] you that's been born in the water and
[1:14:38] the blood and the spirit has got
[1:14:40] privileges you've got rights you've got
[1:14:43] access
[1:14:45] laughs and to the provisions of God by
[1:14:48] his life which shall be saved and not
[1:14:51] only so but we also joy in God through
[1:14:54] our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we now
[1:14:56] have received the atonement then the
[1:14:59] atonement did not come through the first
[1:15:01] Blood it did not come to the first birth
[1:15:04] but through the second birth through the
[1:15:06] second blood through the created blood
[1:15:08] we have received the atonement
[1:15:12] said he said how could there be a more
[1:15:15] perfect sacrifice than God himself
[1:15:16] becoming the atonement himself when God
[1:15:19] was made flesh in his own created blood
[1:15:21] only way that a life of God could ever
[1:15:23] come back because all of us were born by
[1:15:25] sex therefore the life that's in there
[1:15:28] is of the world and that life will not
[1:15:30] stand it's the thing that's already
[1:15:32] touched and condemned you can't patch it
[1:15:35] up you can't patch it up you can't
[1:15:37] smooth it out there's no way to make it
[1:15:39] better it's got to die I'm on Church
[1:15:43] what did Paul say in Romans 7. he see
[1:15:45] Brahman takes Romans 7 and preaches the
[1:15:48] invisible Union of the Heavenly
[1:15:50] bridegroom and the Earthly bride and
[1:15:52] what does he say he says your first
[1:15:54] husband must die he said not lay him
[1:15:57] aside put him in a closet he said
[1:15:59] there's got to be a death to the first
[1:16:01] man so that the new husband come on
[1:16:04] church can come into possession of this
[1:16:07] bride and listen this morning friends
[1:16:09] our first husband is not in a corner
[1:16:11] we're watching us waiting on us to fail
[1:16:13] but according to what a prophet said our
[1:16:16] first husband has died and we have been
[1:16:18] married to the new anointed word and by
[1:16:21] that word through the spirit and the
[1:16:23] blood we have access into all things
[1:16:26] that Christ died for
[1:16:28] what is it it's got to die that's the
[1:16:30] only requirement there is it's got to
[1:16:32] die now let me ask you this morning
[1:16:33] church what did Paul say he said by the
[1:16:36] access we have confidence and boldness
[1:16:39] can I ask you this morning where does
[1:16:41] your boldness come from
[1:16:43] where does your boldness come from does
[1:16:46] your boldness come from what church you
[1:16:48] go to that's your boldness come from
[1:16:50] what kind of clothes you're wearing does
[1:16:52] your boldness come by who your parents
[1:16:54] are and what businesses they own and
[1:16:56] what Society groups they're a part of
[1:16:58] I'll tell you what the Bible says our
[1:17:00] boldness comes by the blood see Paul
[1:17:03] said in Hebrews 10 19 having therefore
[1:17:06] Brethren boldness somebody say boldness
[1:17:08] what did he say boldness to enter into
[1:17:11] the holies amen of holies by the blood
[1:17:14] of Jesus then what does access mean it
[1:17:17] means to enter into something it means
[1:17:19] to approach something it means to become
[1:17:21] a part of something then by the blood
[1:17:24] this morning we have a right to go into
[1:17:27] the holiest of holies and by a New and
[1:17:30] Living Way which he hath consecrated for
[1:17:33] us amen through the veil that is to say
[1:17:36] his flesh now look at this word boldness
[1:17:38] it is a freedom in speaking it is an
[1:17:41] unreservedness in speech amen is free
[1:17:44] and fearless confidence it is a cheerful
[1:17:46] courage it is an assurance I love what
[1:17:49] Barham says he said we was Redeemed by
[1:17:51] the blood of God and now that blood cell
[1:17:54] that's what gives us boldness to stand
[1:17:57] on his word listen amen if you're if
[1:18:00] you're a coward this morning then the
[1:18:01] first question I'm going to ask you is
[1:18:03] by what Authority Are you standing if
[1:18:06] you're afraid to speak the word over the
[1:18:08] conditions of your life then by what
[1:18:10] Authority Are you standing by amen if
[1:18:12] you're standing by your first blood then
[1:18:14] you'll be a yalabat coward if you're
[1:18:16] standing by your first Blood you'll be
[1:18:18] asleep in church you'll be waiting on
[1:18:20] the preacher to close you'll be waiting
[1:18:22] to get out of here but if you're
[1:18:24] standing by the blood of almighty God
[1:18:26] then that blood has released the
[1:18:29] boldness upon you
[1:18:31] I'm on Church you say mother I'd say
[1:18:34] Amen but I'm afraid the devil will
[1:18:36] condemn me well the blood condemned the
[1:18:38] condemnery

[1:18:41] tell you this much you don't know my
[1:18:43] pastor you don't know what I've been
[1:18:44] involved here you don't know the place
[1:18:45] I've been I didn't ask you your past I
[1:18:48] didn't ask you what you've been involved
[1:18:49] in I told you there's a blood for you
[1:18:53] there's a blood this morning and that
[1:18:55] blood is a creative blood it is an
[1:18:58] authoritative blood it is a blood that
[1:19:00] releases a boldness to stand upon his
[1:19:02] word he said that's what gives us
[1:19:04] boldness Amen to walk in the face of
[1:19:06] demons and opposition because we know
[1:19:09] we're coming covered with the blood of
[1:19:12] the Lord Jesus which is in the Divine
[1:19:15] powers in the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:17] I'm not preaching to you by what I've

[1:19:26] I'm on Church let's just go ahead and
[1:19:28] kick that devil out of here these
[1:19:30] musicians they're not up here playing
[1:19:32] because they got fancy talents they're

[1:19:38] preaching to you because of who he is
[1:19:40] and what position he holds he's
[1:19:43] preaching to you because he's covered by
[1:19:45] the blood
[1:19:47] if I was standing here this morning by
[1:19:50] the blood of my first birth I would be
[1:19:52] of all men most miserable I would be a
[1:19:54] weak and Confused preacher but because
[1:19:56] Hallelujah because brother Jim I'm under
[1:20:00] the blood I've got an authority this

[1:20:09] authority to say house of Hell give way
[1:20:11] to the name of Jesus buy the blood I've
[1:20:14] got enough fire to lay my hands
[1:20:18] upon the sick and watch him recover the
[1:20:21] boldness is coming by the blood
[1:20:24] I'm on Church you say Melinda I wish I

[1:20:34] condemnation you can I wish I could get
[1:20:37] above this Guild you can I wish I could
[1:20:40] get above my first birth you can
[1:20:43] remember you don't know my situation you
[1:20:46] think a prophet of God sat down in 1964
[1:20:48] in the month of July and counseled with
[1:20:51] a lady named Georgia Bruce based upon
[1:20:53] the blood of Charles and Ella Branham
[1:20:57] come on now y'all know that
[1:20:59] I remember said my parents charged he
[1:21:02] said I was born to Branham born of a
[1:21:04] natural birth born of a sexual blood and
[1:21:07] God would raise that man up to go around
[1:21:09] the world seven times challenging devils
[1:21:12] witch doctors
[1:21:14] I'm on now you know it's the truth
[1:21:15] challenge in all kinds of spirits but he
[1:21:18] was standing there Brother Mac not with
[1:21:20] a confused look but with a boldness come
[1:21:22] on he said listen he said when God
[1:21:24] anoint you you're not made out of
[1:21:26] running material he said you're not
[1:21:27] anointed off the Rock Amen of Gibraltar
[1:21:30] you're anointed off the Rock of Ages
[1:21:32] then a prophet could stand there brother
[1:21:34] Jack night after night after night after
[1:21:36] night and face demons in opposition and
[1:21:39] criticism and false doctrines and
[1:21:41] spirits of intimidation and spiritual
[1:21:43] manipulation and never one time back up
[1:21:46] and say well we're going to close out
[1:21:47] tonight and come back and try again
[1:21:49] tomorrow night but he stood there night
[1:21:51] after night after night you know why
[1:21:54] because he was covered by the blood and
[1:21:56] brother John that same blood has been
[1:21:58] released upon the Church of the Living

[1:22:03] back up and say well maybe we'll try
[1:22:05] again Wednesday maybe we'll try again

[1:22:09] in the new building I see her right here
[1:22:11] this morning there is a blood and that
[1:22:13] blood is kind of voice and it's a voice
[1:22:15] of authority

[1:22:20] you're covered by the blood
[1:22:24] [Applause]

[1:22:36] Bruce if you stay in that condition
[1:22:38] you're going to live condemned
[1:22:40] Lonnie I thought about something the
[1:22:42] other day you imagine Georgia Bruce amen
[1:22:44] sitting there in the masterpiece
[1:22:48] before that private interview you
[1:22:51] imagine her sitting there brother Jackie
[1:22:53] imagine if she would have went in there
[1:22:54] sat down in that meeting without having
[1:22:57] that private interview and all the
[1:22:59] condemnation and all the pressure and
[1:23:02] all the guilt hanging over but God
[1:23:04] allowed a prophet to catch her before
[1:23:06] the service and record it on a tape and
[1:23:09] send it around the world and here's what
[1:23:11] he says he said Sister Jordan don't
[1:23:13] sister Georgia don't look at yourself
[1:23:15] sister Bruce don't look at yourself I'm
[1:23:18] fixing to pray for you I'm not worthy of
[1:23:20] that I think what would I do if Jesus
[1:23:23] Christ was sitting here now what would
[1:23:25] he do if he was sitting here he would
[1:23:27] lay his hands upon you and with his
[1:23:29] great face see you'd get well well I

[1:23:57] before God I'm not a sinner listen he
[1:24:01] didn't just leave it on a prophet he

[1:24:17] sinner saved by grace that's a good song
[1:24:19] to a Baptist but to the Bride of Jesus
[1:24:21] Christ before you as a sinner you as a
[1:24:24] son and daughter of God before you was
[1:24:27] trapped in humanity your name was on the
[1:24:30] Lamb's Book of Life

[1:24:34] church full of Sinners I'm preaching to
[1:24:36] some redeemed Holy Ghost Field fire

[1:25:31] but he sees the blood
[1:25:35] he hears our voice but he sees the blood
[1:25:39] he sees the blood of his own son it's
[1:25:43] our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:25:46] Christ that's talking through us
[1:25:49] oh God it's Christ talking through us to
[1:25:54] God

[1:26:00] voice has become the blood
[1:26:03] by the word I'm on church and the blood
[1:26:07] don't say I'm serpent seed and the blood
[1:26:09] don't say I guess it's going to fall
[1:26:10] apart and the blood don't say I'm never
[1:26:12] going to make it but the blood quotes
[1:26:14] the word and the word said greater is he
[1:26:16] that is in you that he that is in the
[1:26:19] world and the word and the blood and the
[1:26:21] family of God is all joined together
[1:26:22] under the authority of the token

[1:26:29] explode in here
[1:26:30] are you hearing me he's not hearing your
[1:26:33] voice he's hearing the blood when you

[1:26:42] his own son through the blood come on
[1:26:44] Church you're not under Abel's blood
[1:26:47] come on brother John I'm about to preach
[1:26:50] myself happy you're not under Abel's
[1:26:52] blood there's a difference in Abel's
[1:26:53] blood and the blood of Jesus Christ the
[1:26:56] blood of Abel cried come on the blood of
[1:26:59] Abel cried and the father God said when
[1:27:01] it was crying you couldn't understand
[1:27:02] what was being said and there was
[1:27:04] nothing in the blood of Abel to cover
[1:27:07] those sins he said but according to
[1:27:09] Hebrews 12 through Jesus Christ who is
[1:27:11] the Covenant of a New Covenant who is
[1:27:13] the mediator he said the blood don't cry
[1:27:16] the blood speaks
[1:27:21] the blood don't cry the blood speaks
[1:27:25] there is a difference in crying and
[1:27:27] speaking cried you can't understand
[1:27:30] what's being said cried you cannot
[1:27:32] articulate sounds but when something
[1:27:34] speaks
[1:27:37] when something speaks it is an
[1:27:40] articulate sound
[1:27:42] oh God I feel like shouting right now it
[1:27:45] is a clear sound it is a punctual sound
[1:27:48] and this morning church the blood is not
[1:27:50] crying over you the blood is speaking
[1:27:52] over you and you know what the blood's
[1:27:54] saying you've never even done it in the
[1:27:56] first place
[1:27:58] you know what the blood is saying your
[1:28:00] old man is dead and you can marry this
[1:28:03] new anointed where you know what the
[1:28:05] blood is saying your sins are in the sea
[1:28:08] of forgetfulness
[1:28:10] your iniquities I remember no more
[1:28:14] there's a blood it's a powerful blood
[1:28:17] it's a Holy Blood it's a perfect blood
[1:28:22] it's a creative blood
[1:28:26] [Applause]
[1:28:27] brother Michael by that blood I say I'm
[1:28:30] not a sinner
[1:28:32] and neither are you
[1:28:36] what are you saying I'm saying when a
[1:28:38] prophet told George Bruce your mistakes
[1:28:40] are not looked at and neither are they
[1:28:43] lauded to you
[1:28:44] sure
[1:28:45] I'm on now
[1:28:48] Brother David you imagine you imagine
[1:28:50] Georgia Bruce in that service Brother JD
[1:28:52] I bet she'd give the deacons a job that
[1:28:54] night I bet she I bet I bet the deacons
[1:28:57] had her hand their hands full of trying
[1:28:59] to control that woman because she has
[1:29:01] just heard the voice so they sent a man
[1:29:03] and it spoke to her through the blood
[1:29:05] and said Georgia you're not a sinner and
[1:29:08] neither am I and she comes into a
[1:29:10] meeting and here's a prophet preached
[1:29:11] the Masterpiece and goes all the way
[1:29:13] back to Eden and says she was smart and

[1:33:12] this building
[1:33:14] with a Pentecostal blessing listen when
[1:33:18] healing is supposed to be here it's now
[1:33:20] what about John when he says now we are
[1:33:22] the sons of God
[1:33:24] now I'll go I'll go a distance with you
[1:33:26] on that idea Robert Andrew you can't
[1:33:28] preach the present test now because the
[1:33:30] Bible says the Bible says we don't know
[1:33:32] what will be but we shall be like him
[1:33:34] well thank you you answered your
[1:33:35] question
[1:33:37] see I'm not educated
[1:33:39] I'm I'm
[1:33:41] just an old country boy from the hills
[1:33:43] of East Tennessee I'm not educated I
[1:33:44] don't know how to break this stuff down
[1:33:46] only thing I know how to say is what a
[1:33:47] prophet said and the prophet said we
[1:33:49] shall be like him then listen it's the
[1:33:52] devil come on church it's a devil to rob
[1:33:54] you of what's going on the present while
[1:33:57] looking at the future
[1:33:59] but the prophet said May the same
[1:34:01] anointing that brought down on Abraham
[1:34:03] drop in this building tonight and bring
[1:34:05] the people to a present knowledge that
[1:34:07] Jehovah of the Bible is in the midst of
[1:34:10] the church
[1:34:12] what are you saying I'm saying now
[1:34:14] somebody say now now Jesus Christ is
[1:34:18] here in the form of the Holy Ghost with
[1:34:20] all the Divine gifts in the body of
[1:34:23] Christ being made manifest men look back
[1:34:25] and see what God done look forward to
[1:34:27] what God's going to do he said well they
[1:34:29] do it they're looking back at Pentecost
[1:34:31] and they're looking forward to the
[1:34:33] Millennium he said but watch and they
[1:34:35] are ignoring this very being in the
[1:34:38] presence of his people making ready for
[1:34:40] that Millennium come on Church Luke 17
[1:34:44] 30 comes after the Son of God before the
[1:34:48] son of David and Son of Man returns in
[1:34:51] the age when the fullness of all things
[1:34:53] would come under a voice a restoration
[1:34:55] to prepare the people
[1:34:58] how about church they're looking for the
[1:35:00] Millennium and missing the preparation
[1:35:02] time
[1:35:05] oh the prophet the gun said right now is
[1:35:06] when he's preparing you for the
[1:35:07] millennium
[1:35:10] how can we break or can we preach this
[1:35:12] morning can we preach right now he's
[1:35:15] preparing you for the Millennium see oh
[1:35:18] my they ignore it it's just the nature
[1:35:20] of people to do that Satan gets among
[1:35:22] them to hide their eyes from the very
[1:35:25] thing that God has sent to them you go
[1:35:28] to church as much as you want to do
[1:35:30] whatever you wish to do but ignore the
[1:35:32] very things that God has sent to us
[1:35:37] what are you saying I'm saying this
[1:35:39] access can I have a few more minutes I'm
[1:35:41] saying this access I'm speaking of is a
[1:35:43] two-fold access it's an access amen
[1:35:46] where man wants to access God but at the
[1:35:49] same time God wants to access man see
[1:35:53] what the proud of God say he's pressing
[1:35:55] trying to get into you and to move you
[1:35:58] to move into you today now notice this
[1:36:01] look what David says look what David
[1:36:02] says in Psalm 65 4 he said blessed is
[1:36:06] the man whom now chooses and calls us to
[1:36:09] approach unto thee that he may dwell in
[1:36:11] thy courts we shall be satisfied with
[1:36:14] the goodness of my house even of thy
[1:36:16] Holy Temple
[1:36:18] there is a way then to approach all
[1:36:21] things and there's a way to approach god
[1:36:23] listen he says and we must find the way
[1:36:27] somebody say the way not a way but we
[1:36:30] must find the way to approach God see
[1:36:33] then Christ is not a way to approach God
[1:36:36] according to John 14 6 he said I am the
[1:36:40] way I am the life I am the truth and no
[1:36:45] man coming to the father but by me so
[1:36:47] what are you saying I'm saying it's not
[1:36:49] enough just to get in church
[1:36:52] hello now it's not enough just to get
[1:36:55] around the message we got an entire tape
[1:36:57] on in 1963 the token get under the token
[1:37:01] get beneath the token
[1:37:04] I'm on now you say what are you talking
[1:37:06] about brother said on the David Tolkien
[1:37:08] come into effect and Moses said go put
[1:37:11] the blood over the doors he said there
[1:37:13] were Jews downtown in the community
[1:37:15] stirring a pot of blood talking about
[1:37:17] how much they believed in Jehovah and
[1:37:20] ridiculing the token message he said see
[1:37:23] they had a knowledge of Jehovah but they
[1:37:25] were not displaying the revelation of
[1:37:27] Jehovah and there's an entire group of
[1:37:29] people glory to God might as well preach
[1:37:31] that now there's an entire group of
[1:37:33] people sitting around the ranks of this
[1:37:35] message right now saying well brother
[1:37:36] Andrew I'll tell you what we need we
[1:37:38] need emotion we need shouting we need
[1:37:40] worship we need praise and there's a
[1:37:41] whole other group it gets up and says
[1:37:43] well we don't need shouting we don't
[1:37:44] need praise we need the word we need we
[1:37:46] need intellectualism and then can I
[1:37:49] preach and then you get guys get up and
[1:37:51] say well you know what I'm gonna preach
[1:37:52] on I'm going to preach on emotionalism
[1:37:54] versus worked up or worked up
[1:37:56] emotionalism versus intellectualism well
[1:37:58] let me ask you something pray tell me
[1:38:00] where brother Brandon preached
[1:38:02] emotionalism versus into intellectualism
[1:38:05] I don't have a tape but I call that but
[1:38:07] I do have a tape called Christianity
[1:38:09] versus idolatry you know brother Brandon
[1:38:11] didn't make it a fight it's a bunch of
[1:38:13] intellectual backsling preachers that
[1:38:15] don't want to stand with a prophet that
[1:38:17] made it a fight they don't want no
[1:38:18] shouting they don't want no screaming
[1:38:20] they don't want no worship they don't
[1:38:22] want no messy births around the altar
[1:38:24] because they don't want to stay past two
[1:38:26] o'clock and praise somebody through the
[1:38:28] Holy Ghost amen but I tell you where
[1:38:29] that Doctrine comes from it comes from
[1:38:31] the pits of hell and there is no room in
[1:38:34] the Bride of Jesus Christ for
[1:38:36] intellectual conversions there is no
[1:38:39] room in the pride of Jesus Christ for a
[1:38:42] bunch of handshaking members we've had
[1:38:43] enough hybrid hot men amen aristocratic
[1:38:46] church members I'm ready to see some
[1:38:48] Messiahs I'm ready to see some young
[1:38:50] people on fire with the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:38:53] ready to see the word be preached and
[1:38:55] the authority back up that word
[1:38:58] I'm on Church don't you back up off of
[1:39:01] your praise don't you back off of your
[1:39:03] worship don't you back off the anointing
[1:39:05] for some cold formal intellectual
[1:39:08] backslid and refrigerating preacher
[1:39:12] well I gotta sort out this morning are
[1:39:16] you hearing me we're not coming anyway
[1:39:18] we're coming the way
[1:39:23] in the words of my good friend Ron
[1:39:25] Spencer refrigerated preachers produce
[1:39:27] ice cubes
[1:39:30] all right
[1:39:31] ice cubes and they don't like no fire
[1:39:34] you know why I would hug God when fire
[1:39:37] comes in the building fire melts through
[1:39:38] a rich Socratic identity fire melts
[1:39:41] their dignity fire melts oh oh they want
[1:39:43] somebody up in the pup head that they
[1:39:45] can bring somebody to church and he
[1:39:47] don't sweat he don't holler and he don't
[1:39:49] spit I tell you what they want they want
[1:39:50] a rich young ruler that can get up and
[1:39:52] say a few good points but listen good
[1:39:54] points ain't gonna put you in the
[1:39:56] Rapture but the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:58] coming in the church not by work to
[1:40:01] music not by emotion but by the
[1:40:04] preaching of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:40:08] foreign
[1:40:11] I think that devil got out here
[1:40:14] it's not enough to get in church you
[1:40:16] better get in Christ it's not enough
[1:40:19] just to carry a spoken word book you
[1:40:21] better get into the influence of what a
[1:40:22] prophet said remember that and I'll tell
[1:40:25] you what we got to be careful we got to
[1:40:27] be careful we're just getting people to
[1:40:28] church we're getting the message
[1:40:29] remember said see he said we're not come
[1:40:31] together to talk about the message the
[1:40:33] message is Christ he is the word
[1:40:36] we are to get into it
[1:40:40] come on Sir where does the shout come
[1:40:42] from it comes from
[1:40:46] it comes from the word where does the
[1:40:49] worship come from
[1:40:51] the word see then we are to get
[1:40:54] underneath it we already get beneath it
[1:40:56] see then that's Divine instruction from
[1:40:59] the seventh angel get into Christ you
[1:41:02] say how do I get into Christ by one
[1:41:04] Spirit we're all baptized then how does
[1:41:07] Christ get into the church Abraham says
[1:41:10] it like this he says he's got a
[1:41:12] threefold purpose it's Christ The
[1:41:14] Mystery of God revealed right he says
[1:41:17] watch he said the first fold is he
[1:41:19] reveals himself the second fold he takes
[1:41:22] preeminence in the body by the
[1:41:25] revelation of himself and the third fold
[1:41:28] is he leads the bright Body by the
[1:41:31] preeminent revelation of himself back to
[1:41:34] a Garden of Eden condition come on
[1:41:36] church we are not waiting for Christ to
[1:41:39] take possession of this church he has
[1:41:41] taken possession of this church through
[1:41:43] the sounding of seven Thunders which was
[1:41:45] revealing the mind of Christ
[1:41:48] what are you saying I'm saying you are
[1:41:51] back in dominion and Authority by the
[1:41:54] blood
[1:41:56] saying you got to write this morning to
[1:41:59] speak the word and go forward I'm saying
[1:42:02] you got to write this morning to stay
[1:42:04] awake in church
[1:42:08] oh I know I never say well you know I
[1:42:11] just I just I just can't stay awake if
[1:42:13] anything is they don't sleep at a ball
[1:42:14] game
[1:42:17] and the funny thing is listen I'm
[1:42:19] preaching the funny thing is they don't
[1:42:22] sleep at Dollywood
[1:42:24] and the funny thing is they don't sleep
[1:42:26] at Disney but they come in the house of
[1:42:28] God and barely stay awake you know why
[1:42:29] because they've just been around the
[1:42:31] message but if you ever get in it if you
[1:42:33] ever get underneath it
[1:42:36] if you get off of a bunch of nonsense in
[1:42:38] the middle of the week and get your head
[1:42:40] in this message it wouldn't be a foreign
[1:42:42] language when brother Donnie quotes a
[1:42:44] quote
[1:42:45] well glory to God it's a truth anyhow
[1:42:48] come on Church there ought to be some
[1:42:50] connections we got we got the books and
[1:42:53] the tapes it shouldn't be Sinners saying
[1:42:54] well wow where did he get that wow who
[1:42:56] said that wow no there ought to be some
[1:42:59] connection you know why because we're
[1:43:01] not just around it it's not just a
[1:43:03] social Gathering
[1:43:05] we're under the influence of the
[1:43:07] Revelation the full word come on and
[1:43:09] it's changing us
[1:43:11] it's changes come on church it's
[1:43:13] changing the way we talk it's changing

[1:43:52] church I think boys wearing shorts ought
[1:43:54] to be out of the church listen I'm just
[1:43:56] preaching are you hearing me it's the
[1:43:58] word or it's nothing and I refuse to
[1:44:00] back off of the Revelation that is
[1:44:03] penetrated this generation to bring a
[1:44:05] change in our conduct to bring a change
[1:44:08] well we might as well preach you know
[1:44:10] what I think it's time to do I think

[1:44:43] closing this morning you ain't got to
[1:44:45] back up
[1:44:46] you ain't got to turn around Christ by
[1:44:49] the revelation of his word coming from
[1:44:52] the spirit through the blood has taken
[1:44:55] possession
[1:44:57] what does revelation 3 20 say behold I
[1:45:00] stand at the door and knock and if any
[1:45:02] man knock If any man hear my voice and
[1:45:05] will open the door I will come into him
[1:45:08] and I will suffer them you know but them

[1:45:13] he said I'll come in and I'll reveal
[1:45:16] myself that I'm the same yesterday today
[1:45:19] and forever and that revelation will put
[1:45:23] a people God just go and tell you which
[1:45:24] are it'll put a people in position
[1:45:26] that'll cause hell to tremble

[1:45:52] somebody knocks they're trying to gain
[1:45:55] access and the prop come on now the
[1:45:58] prophet said Christ was put out of his
[1:46:01] own church he said he was standing at
[1:46:04] the door of the church knocking trying
[1:46:07] to gain access to me he was trying to
[1:46:09] gain access Into the Heart of Fallen

[1:46:29] is in the burning bush for the one who
[1:46:31] separated The Waters at the Red Sea for
[1:46:33] the one who spoke to Joshua and the son
[1:46:36] stood still for the one who formed the
[1:46:38] moon the stars got them in their sockets
[1:46:41] to shine for the one who said Lazarus
[1:46:43] come forth and a man dead four days in
[1:46:45] the grave come to life again for the one
[1:46:48] who in the lion stand with Daniel and
[1:46:50] protected him from the lines for the one
[1:46:52] who went in the fiery furnace with the
[1:46:53] three Hebrew children and fanned the
[1:46:55] fire from them for the one who stood and
[1:46:58] said I am the resurrection and I am the
[1:47:00] life and he that believeth in me though
[1:47:02] we were dead yet shall he live who shall
[1:47:04] we live with him believeth in me shall
[1:47:05] never die he stands at the door of
[1:47:09] Fallen Humanity knocking trying to gain
[1:47:12] access
[1:47:14] to the soul but we turn that great
[1:47:18] important person away
[1:47:19] you know why because lordship means
[1:47:22] ownership now you say what are you
[1:47:24] saying I'm saying he is the husbandman
[1:47:26] of the vine right I am the vine ye are
[1:47:30] the branches so the vine must have
[1:47:33] access to the branches but remember said
[1:47:36] like this he said it's the life of the
[1:47:39] vine manifesting itself through the
[1:47:42] branches

[1:49:17] Miracles there can't be so Satan that's
[1:49:19] a line devil from the pits of hell
[1:49:23] it's time to rise up and remember who
[1:49:26] you are
[1:49:29] a church where the Messiah rules a
[1:49:32] church where the word has feminence a
[1:49:34] church in position and Authority Under
[1:49:37] the spoken word which is the original
[1:49:39] seed to speak
[1:49:42] can I leave your face you're a church
[1:49:45] founded upon the word
[1:49:48] released by the blood
[1:49:53] saved through the death of Jesus Christ
[1:49:57] restored
[1:50:00] by the voice of Malachi 4.
[1:50:08] in position to speak
[1:50:14] in position
[1:50:16] to speak I mean those brother and
[1:50:19] preaches three messages called speak to
[1:50:21] the Rock
[1:50:22] then he preaches speak to the mountain
[1:50:25] then he preaches a sermon called why cry
[1:50:30] why
[1:50:34] the blood of Abel cries
[1:50:38] but the blood of Jesus
[1:50:45] the blood
[1:50:46] has put you in position
[1:50:48] to speak
[1:50:51] Moses you need water yes
[1:50:55] okay speak to the Rock
[1:50:58] Exodus 17 God told him to smile The Rock
[1:51:00] numbers 20 God told him to speak
[1:51:04] he smoked the rock the people stayed out
[1:51:07] of the land and God said Moses I never
[1:51:09] anointed you to Smite that rock the
[1:51:11] second time
[1:51:12] you broke the top but I didn't want you
[1:51:14] to speak
[1:51:16] then you go to Mark 11 and he says have
[1:51:19] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[1:51:21] that whosoever shall
[1:51:23] nod unto this mountain
[1:51:25] our wink editor give it a thumbs up or
[1:51:28] kind of wait
[1:51:30] whosoever shall say in this mountain be
[1:51:33] thou removed and be thou cast in the sea
[1:51:36] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:51:37] Shall Believe those things which you
[1:51:39] said shall come to pass he shall have
[1:51:40] whatsoever he noteth
[1:51:43] he said whatsoever he Winks at her you
[1:51:46] know just kind of slightly this brother
[1:51:47] don't know he's not asleep
[1:51:49] he shall have whatsoever he saith I'm
[1:51:53] gonna tell you what a prophet said
[1:51:54] you're a Christian you have a right to
[1:51:57] any Redemptive blessing that Jesus died
[1:51:59] for it's already yours
[1:52:02] it's already paid for you just have to
[1:52:05] believe it not imagine it but believe it
[1:52:08] and know that it's yours and you can
[1:52:11] possess it he knew Jesus what would
[1:52:13] happen before he could predict what
[1:52:15] would happen because he knowed it would
[1:52:17] happen and once every predicted come to
[1:52:19] pass now watch whatever God said
[1:52:22] whatever he said rather God honored
[1:52:24] whatever Jesus said God brought it to
[1:52:27] pass so he knowed his words were God's
[1:52:30] words and that same scripture
[1:52:33] huh comes right back into us
[1:52:38] Mark 11 is not just in a Bible this
[1:52:41] morning
[1:52:42] it's in the flesh
[1:52:44] speak to the Rock and God is the rock
[1:52:47] speak to the mountain and the mountain
[1:52:49] is the obstacle and before we can speak
[1:52:52] to the mountain we've got to be on
[1:52:53] speaking terms with the rock so it's
[1:52:55] good to know God get on speaking terms
[1:52:57] with him while there's nothing wrong on
[1:52:59] speaking terms means you're with you're
[1:53:00] with someone you are quite friendly with
[1:53:02] them and often talk to them and are
[1:53:05] acquainted with them and when you become
[1:53:06] Born Again a personality of God
[1:53:08] acquaintance comes into you and he knows
[1:53:12] goes from the ridiculous to the sublime
[1:53:15] what are you saying I'm saying Adam
[1:53:17] spoke to the Rock and The Rock was in
[1:53:19] Eden Noah spoke to the Rock Daniel spoke
[1:53:22] to the Rock Hebrew children spoke to the
[1:53:24] Rock Hagar spoke to the Rock Joshua
[1:53:26] spoke to the rock band barimea spoke to
[1:53:28] the Rock
[1:53:30] the woman at the whale spoke to the Rock
[1:53:32] Martha spoke to the Rock Jairus spoke to
[1:53:35] the Rock the disciples spoke to the Rock
[1:53:38] he said on the water that night because
[1:53:40] the rock walks on water
[1:53:45] can you speak to the Rock tonight
[1:53:49] are you on speaking terms with him

[2:03:11] God in the name of Jesus Christ I raise
[2:03:14] up this rock out of History this morning
[2:03:16] I raised this rock up out of the pages
[2:03:19] of this Bible and out of the voice of
[2:03:21] the seventh angel I raised this rock up
[2:03:23] in this place as Jesus Christ and I
[2:03:26] present this rock to a perishing person
[2:03:28] I present this rock to a sick body I
[2:03:32] present this rock to a defeated mind I
[2:03:35] present this rock to a bound spirit I
[2:03:38] present this rock to a dying loved one I
[2:03:41] re I present this rock oh God I present
[2:03:44] it to an empty vessel I present it to a
[2:03:46] filthy vessel I present this rock Jesus
[2:03:49] Christ and I encourage them this morning
[2:03:51] I implore them by the blood Lord to look
[2:03:54] away from their symptoms to look away
[2:03:55] from their conditions to look away from
[2:03:57] their circumstances to look away from
[2:03:59] their besetting sins look away from
[2:04:01] their habits look away from their
[2:04:03] strongholds because if they can just get
[2:04:05] their eyes on the Rock and they can make
[2:04:07] eye contact with a rock they can make a
[2:04:10] step towards the rock they can speak to
[2:04:12] the Rock then that Rock will begin to

[2:09:27] and if they're not contested in seven
[2:09:29] years they've got squatters right

[2:09:36] can continue to exist on that property
[2:09:39] even though it's not theirs
[2:09:41] even though they don't have a title to
[2:09:43] it even though they don't have an
