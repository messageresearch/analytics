oh come on we can do better than that I believe praise the Lord I just saw our brothers just did all three of them an outstanding job didn't you I Marvel at God's variety and how that God calls men and Gifts them different and they study different their approach is different and I just so appreciate men of God that's able to get themselves out of the way follow the leading of the Holy Ghost and see what the Lord will do each sermon was different every ministration but all was different and thought brother Daryl's is just perfect for having a prayer line you imagine Brother David I told Brother Daryl you imagine a brother David's sermon would have been preached on Saturday night you all were sitting her like me you're trying to figure out where in the world is he going on all this leprosy stuff and I thought if he don't get out of that putrification for long I'm going to be sick on a dog type of sermon you have to think about and contemplate you know what I'm saying Yet brother Daryl was just laying it right out there healing Deliverance what we have need of I don't how many things I've already heard backsliders come back to God people got healed people got delivered wonderful things absolutely wonderful things you know you can get some men of God that aren't in competition they're just there to obey the Lord and just be what God wants them to be and follow the leading of the Lord that's when we can have a meeting I'm just so grateful in my heart I know I've said it to you a lot since we've been in our new place here but I'm just so grateful that the Lord has let us have have a place where we can be able to host meetings like this I told you before we've been robbed for not being able to have them surely you understand what I'm saying you probably most of you already knew it anyway but it's such a blessing to be able to have meetings like this we're just so honored so tonight you're stuck with me again Revelation 5:7 we'll we'll read together down to verses 10 in praise the Lord I I wish to say again how grateful I am for all of those that was parking the cars and brothers I felt so sorry for them sitting out there sweating and driving vehicles and all that that was going on all the sisters all the work that they did and preparing the food my goodness I got hundreds and hundreds of portions worth of beans and you know this and that and the other to do all that don't you appreciate all of that that work all the Bacon Brothers there's so many parts that it takes to make it be able to flow together and I I don't want to leave anybody out I just want you to know for anything and everything that you did during that time may the Lord bless you whenever the great rewards are given out that day it won't just be um brother Matt and Brother David and and brother Daryl that'll be getting rewards for those of you that pray those of you that did what you did to be able to contribute your little part to that if there's one soul that will be saved one person that was healed and I already know there's several that's already healed a couple of backsliders that I know of that come back to God you were part of that you were part of that work so don't you never let the devil try to convince you that you're not doing nothing for the kingdom of God that is a lie amen praise the Lord now let's read about what made it all possible what we saw this this weekend um after the service on Sunday the ministers myself was back in the office talking about brother David's uh s subject matter and thought and um I've heard brother R say that my goodness thousands of times since I've been in the message about the bleach but I just never really looked at the word bleach wasn't that awesome but one of the brothers I don't remember brother Matt might have been brother Daryl but talking about that God allowed bleach to be created in our day now they believed in forgiveness of sins of course in the days of Luth days of West days of Pentecost but we're not just forgiven we're Justified as if though we never did it in the first place what I found was amazing was when brother brand brother Brandon would speak about it and some of the words that he mentioned about bleach and talked about the molecule and the color and all that and when Brother David brought the scientific meaning of that it paralleled beautifully with what brother brandham said is not awesome I love it when God ties it together that way Revelation 5:7 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 4 and20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying thou not the Saints now not the elders are worthy not the preachers are worthy but thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests Hallelujah and we shall reign on the Earth Earth how many has a request you'd like to make known to the Lord tonight just by raising your hand all right let's let's take it to him now in prayer father just standing here Lord thanking you and giving you praise for the awesome meeting that we had this weekend Lord all three of them together just so wonderful but yet here we stand tonight Lord no doubt every one of us could relate to it in the the natural sense that the very best meal that we've ever had whatever that we would identify that as being maybe a special restaurant that we were able to go to and we ordered our special whatever it was and it was just so outstanding and no matter how good it was everything might have been prepared just exactly the way we like it but what's amazing is after we would get done with that meal within a matter of hours we will find oursel hungry again now it doesn't mean that we'll be able to go back to our F favorite restaurant and get our favorite meal every day but it's kind of special to us so we like to go there maybe on special occasions that's why we have special meetings other people that our church come and different Believers are represented different ministers and we we were so blessed but here we are again on Wednesday night and I find myself hungry again I find myself hungry to be in your presence once more Lord I was so blessed just hearing the brothers Minister and watching the Saints be blessed and just being under your anointing and yet here I am tonight I want more maybe we prayed for hundreds and hundreds of people here Saturday night no doubt there's people here tonight that have needs and they might need to be prayed for tonight so no matter how good that we're fed and how wonderful and awesome your presence is on Sunday morning it's like we can never get enough oh Jesus we're here tonight for more and there's one thing we know about you for sure you certainly have more to give us your Prophet had the people multiple times he would ask them how many needs more of God and hundreds of people would raise their hand and he'd answer with a simple response that than say that shows there's more for you so you saw the needs that were signified by the uplifting of the hands and we're praying tonight that you would just take your word and speak to us once again father our needs are are made known to you of course but your word tells us that we're to make them known to you again so we bring them before you we're asking that you'd help us father would you heal the sick would you deliver the bound would you fill those that don't have the Holy Ghost tonight father whatever we have need of we just bring our needs and our requests to you tonight anoint me Father anoint the people may you move here among us we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus and the saints of God God said amen God bless you praise the Lord so Saints I ask you as you take your seats tonight where would we be in this end time of God had not given us of such an abundance of his Mercy to open his word in such a way that our hearts our minds Our Lives would be so illuminated by a light that has never been on the earth before this age now we know it's nothing to do with us it's not that we're any better than any other age it's not that the preachers in this age are any better there's been great men of God that have stood on the earth and preached under Dynamic I'm talking about Dynamic uh anointings but yet God chose us for this last day I count it a great honor and yet we know that it's because of his Mercy that he's allowed us to be able to stand in this end time and preach and believe under the end time anointing now we believe that we are truly redeemed those of us here tonight that have the token and we know with the token comes an Assurance so the token is the spirit identification that the chemistry of the blood has been applied to your life now remember the prophet taught us that it was thought to be the blood and those other ages it was thought to be the chemistry of the blood I realize there's preachers that still preach it today that is the chemistry but we are living in the age of the person personal life of Christ so it's not just the identification with the chemistry of the Blood Brother David expressed it so beautifully that it was not being covered by the blood our sins simply being painted over but our sins are annihilated they are totally out of the mind of God they don't even exist and then a person that would be in that kind of a state and and we would say but brother Donnie how how can that be that our sins are so forgiven that God doesn't even remember them at all anymore is that what we believe our sins are so far from us that God does not even remember them at all now we do of course but he doesn't and that's what matters and yet we can still get sick we can get weary we can be sad we can be a depressed we can deal with all kinds of anxieties and troubles in our life and you say how can a person that in their soul could stand there before God and God could look at them and not see one fault now listen to me if you are in Christ Jesus tonight you are as perfect in your soul as he is perfect in your flesh you're human you have mistakes and you always will but in your soul you are so Redeemed by the power of that cleansing blood that God no longer looks at you as being a sinner but he looks at you as being a son and daughter of God and sends back not only the blood as a chemistry to paint over the top of your sins but sends the personal life of the Lamb of God himself to to live in each of our redeemed Souls but yet how is it then that we could still have all of these other things that we do is anybody felt kind of sad since Sunday anybody been sick since Sunday anybody had any trouble since Sunday any anxiety since Sunday well of course because we're human beings and we think well how can we be redeemed well it's because of the cycle where we are in this stage of redemption now our souls are fully redeemed and then the display of the token life so when we pray now when I just prayed and when you join with me in prayer it was us making our petition known and us bringing from the sincerity of our hearts but our prayers were coming up through the blood of the Lord Jesus and you might have heard me but father heard Jesus Christ I might have heard you your wife might have heard you your husband might have heard you but when it comes up through the blood as somehow it is changed to where that it is our mediator that is actually bringing our petition to Father God you talking about miraculous and yet we believe that we're in this cycle of redemption to where that the lamb has not yet fully claimed his possession now the Redemption and claiming the redeemed subject is two different things so we know that we will always have troubles in this life we're always going to have problems I hate to be the bearer of bad news but yet we will always deal with this human element every one of us can you imagine brother brandom 3 months after preaching the seals that he stands in Jeffersonville and preaches the message standing in the Gap and talks about forgetting what God called him to do forgetting the burden of his people and God spoke to him and told him that you're like Moses you forgot what I called you for and you become like brother Roberson had in his dream and he tells us one human Frailty after another and he requests the people that they will pray for him that he will regain that love that he's lost in that complex now three months after he's preached the greatest thing that had been preached since Calvary and the raising of the Lord Jesus from the dead which was introducing the the ministry of the son of man now remember he told us as far back as 1958 that there was a difference between the appearing and the coming the appearing and the coming now even in 58 he said that for several years he has been appearing Among Us now it's two different words with two different meanings so what happened at the opening of the seals it was a further advancing of that appearing and yet 3 months after that he stands there with a confession that he has built a complex and that the people you know he had such an issue with people and them not loving him and all that sort of thing don't set look at me tonight there probably any person here that ain't got one kind of complex or another and that as human beings will always deal with this part and what we're waiting for is when the lamb will AB absolutely claim what he has redeemed now remember something can be redeemed but the cycle of claiming the Redemption of that is not the same thing as it being redeemed many of you struggle was that in your life and there's something in you that you're constantly longing for more and you're pulling for more and I pray for you time and time again as you will come up front and brother Donnie I want to be closer to God I'm just not sure I'm just not sure well you know for a lot of you it's not that you don't have the Holy Ghost it's not that the token is not already there but what you're crying for in that deep recess of your soul is the Redemption of your body when the lamb will finalize the claim you see he has redeemed us and we're in the work of redemption but he has not made the claim on his inheritance and until he does and he won't until the appointed time we're going to fight battles we're going to have misunderstandings we're going to have misgivings well even have misunderstandings among ourselves we will have misunderstandings maybe with other churches and other believers and yet it's not because we're trying to be different it's just our flesh how that it can Clash one from the other anybody hear me tonight notice this in the breach that he says Christ has redeemed us now we are now redeemed but he has not yet claimed his Poss session yet so here the timeline of Boaz as we've been looking at of the Redemption of rose and Boaz is before the elders at the gate but remember Ruth is not there Ruth was back at Naomi's house and she's waiting for him to claim her because she's uncertain is to going to be her husband or is Boaz going to be her husband she's not certain remember they had no means of communication the way we do today so it's not like as soon as it was done she got a text or a WhatsApp and and a phone call and okay okay everything's good she didn't know until Boaz himself or a messenger came with the message not only the message of redemption but the message of possession you see it's the same way with healing or with a Deliverance that you may need in your life the Lord Jesus has already redeemed that for you but it won't do you one bit of good until it is your personal possession and he's already paid the price that we could be healed delivered whatever more but yet until we are be are able to rise to that level to produce the faith needed and claim it as our own possession my it it's like he died in vain so whenever we're able to rise to that now watch so so he says he has not yet claimed his possession now we are his and he's identified himself with us and we're identified with him but he has not taken us as his wife yet in the material sense we are his bride right now but he's not yet claimed us now he said you may differ with that but just hold on a minute and he goes on to say he hasn't claimed it see if he took the book of Redemption everything that Adam had and everything that he lost Christ redeemed back he's already redeemed us but he hasn't took the possession yet so how can I how can you with a down payment of eternal life already in our soul Carol and I was talking to list on the phone yesterday and was talking about different people that had got healed and I I was talking to them and I told them I said you know every time that the Lord performs the divine healing or a miracle that is actually a deposit or a little bit of the body chain so a person walks up and they're sick and they're Afflicted prayer is offered the power of God comes down the spirit of God moves inside that person's body and Alters that sickness changes that pain changes whatever it is are going through you understand what that is that's a little reflection of what we're fixing to get in the body change so every time you see a person that is being healed or a miracle is perform it's a little bit of a down payment of what we're fixing to get in the Rapture so how could we get that and not hunger for so much more the closer I get to him I it's so strange because you'd think the well you you RVE to a certain spot and then you would you would get this great s satisfaction and you wouldn't actually want any more no friends I've been serving him and and well next week I guess it'll be Carol and I will be 68 years old I've been serving him since I was 12 46 years 56 years of my life serving the lord and yet getting closer and closer and finding out more and more and knowing more and more about him and yet I want more now than I did when I first got saved anybody feel that same way now there's some people in you have been saved longer than I have and yet my we just talking about the great services that we had but I hope you come back tonight expecting more and wanting more I'm talking about a a fountain that God has allowed us to break into that the closer we get the more that we want and the more we understand the more I want and whenever I hear preachers preach like I did this weekend I just heard some of those tapes that those Brothers quoted from I just went through the Harvest Time just not over a few weeks ago and listened to it about three times in a row listened to it again and again and again and yet some of the quotes they was reading was right out of harvest time and I said D where were you Donnie but do you understand what we broke into we have broke into eternity so it's not like that we will on this Earth that will ever arrive to this we call it the satisfying portion and it is it is a portion that is satisfies you that you'll never want no more of the world but it does not mean you want don't want no more of it it's like you become hope you understand when I said this way you become a addicted to it how manyan he understands that no don't look at me fun now Paul talks about in the New Testament about some saints of God that had addicted themselves to serving the lord so what a great thing to be addicted to in serving the lord and serving God's people so it's not like you you think my this is torment because the more I get the more I want no actually you're better off to feel that way than the people who go to church one time and they think they get everything they need so why do I even need to go back anymore I mean I go once a month whether I need it or not and I might go twice a month you know but aren't you glad there's something inside of you that the more you get the more you want how many of y'all been serving God for 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years 60 years look 50 60 years well those of you y'all still want more of God yeah you don't want no more of God you want more do you well that's good you see what I'm talking about so there's something in us what is it it's that down payment of this cycle of redemption and what are we waiting for why wouldn't we wait my every day we live in this world it's more hell on this Earth and before long our lord Jesus is going to say this place is no longer fit for my bride to live in that's the day I'm waiting for but until that day arrives I don't want to just sit around Twitter in my thumbs I want to do something for the kingdom of God don't you I want to reach out I want to love I want to be a witness I want to do everything I can notice again he said he hasn't claim to if he took the book of redemption everything that Adam had that he lost Christ redeems back he's already redeemed us but he hasn't took the possession yet he cannot on until the time appointed now what is that the time appointed well say well it's probably me it's probably me no it's not just you no doubt there's all types of things that fit into this allocation of the two words that he use time appointed well the Antichrist cannot be revealed to the time appointed Jesus Christ cannot come until the time appointed the resurrection cannot happen until the time time appointed the Rapture cannot take place until the time appointed we can't even see certain things in the word until the time appointed oh think of it I'm so glad it's not in my hands tonight I'd mess it up sure as a world I've been some of y'all's Pastor for a long time and I'm so glad that this resurrection and Rapture is not based on some of us cuz we'd never get out of here we would ever leave this world if it was based on us brother Nathan but it's based upon God's time clock not mine and yours because there'll always be an element about our old flesh it's lazy it will never be what it's supposed to be and you know the good thing about it God don't even expect it to be God is working on our soul and then he will make the body match our soul at the appointed time notice he says he cannot come until the time appointed then will come the resurrection and then the Earth will be renewed again and then he will take his possession his possession which he got when he redeemed us now that seems so odd don't it because whenever we go to Walmart or you go to Lowe's to buy tool or you go somewhere to buy a plant or or a car and you go there and you say well I I need a new r will be this or I need a new skill Sal I need this that that they go out turn and you pay for it you walk out with it but the Lord Jesus Paid for you but he didn't get to walk out fully with you until the appointed time why because his mediatorial work could not be completed until the last name is on the book so think about it that that Paul John Peter bolom ideus all the New Testament Saints none of them have seen the Lord Jesus yet in his Corporal body now remember when the prophet was carried beyond the curtain of time in the sixth Dimension he did not see Paul he did not see Luther he did not see Wesley he did not see any of those other ages he only saw his group so by that Vision that translation it would lead us to believe that apparently the sixth Dimension must be divided similar to the ages so Paul is there with his group and then uh Luther was his group and the rest of the church age Messengers so brother R didn't see Peter brother R didn't see Andrew he did not see none of the Apostles and whenever the lamb rises from the father's Throne then the cycle of possession will kick in it's Unbecoming for them to see him now notice he said then he will take his possession and his possession which he got when he redeemed us but will do it at the appointed time notice again he said he comes for what to take his claims now Oh my he comes to take his claims what he done the Kinsman work he come down become man died done the Kinsman work as Redeemer but had not as yet called for his claim it's not just based upon me and you it's not just based upon you know the demographics of our nation the demographics of the Nations around the world don't worry when it's exactly right all the pieces that go to fit together it'll work perfectly exactly like it's supposed to we're not going to be able to hasten it listen to me I don't think there's one person here tonight or one around the world that has the ability to stop that Rapture I don't think there's enough devils in hell to delay that Rapture almighty God has an appointed time if it's in the morning at 6:05 a.m. there ain't enough Devils there ain't enough people there ain't enough atomic bombs there ain't enough presidents and prime ministers to stop it from happen at the appointed time he will call for his bride amen he will make sure that she is ready well he'll definitely have to make sure for some of us cuz we're so slothful won't he but notice he said he comes on the scene to claim his rights now this is a delayed reaction in this cycle of redemption so he paid the Redemptive price because he had it scattered out over a period of 2,000 years in seven Church ages so he's going to allow it to come in different time now the church will go up it'll go down it'll go up it'll go out there'll be light the light will be put out there'll be another light it'll be put out another light it'll be put out until it comes to the end time then the fourth light will come remember there's four light rays inside of your body so when you get an x-ray that x-ray is not what produces the light actually your body produces it yourself now as you get older the prophet gives a time frame there when you get a certain age you lose your first light R then when you get another age you lose your second light Ray and then your third on down to your fourth now when you're getting that x-ray it's your light was in your own body there was four death Messengers that kill the church down through the church ages and he said there will be four life Messengers that will restore it so what is it the fourth messenger bringing the evening time is also the restoration of the forced light so as we lose our lights in our natural body it's like the spiritual so here come with those four life Messengers to bring restoration then at the end time will come the seventh angel which will introduce to the public the son of man now the seventh angel is not the son of man but he is revealing to the public the son of man so what will it do it will restore our forth light so instead of the Bride losing her lights now he's getting all four back what four a body change so as we get older we're losing one right and one light Ray another light Ray another light Ray that's the way it was by the four death Messengers and as they come to eat up and take away from the bride but God said I will restore sayith the Lord so God takes from the first and the second and the third and the fourth and remember the seventh Angel doesn't have a certain message so he would pull what was right from Luther he would pull what was right from wesle if you study brother brandham very close you'll find brother brandham said things that Adam Clark said you'll find that brother brandham said things that finest date would say that he said certain things that that different preachers down to the ages would say well of course that's what his ministry is it's to gather the Loose Ends but yet all of that with every one of them remember they did not have the fourth light and every one of them men that I just quoted to you were trinitarians why they were living in a light of another day come on somebody Clarence Larin if you listen to e God of this evil age Satan seen you'll get into Clarence larin's dispensational truths and look down through there you'll find some of that stuff in there word for word that brother randam said you know why Ken Larin had certain things right but like a lot of them other guys he didn't have baptism right he didn't have election right he didn't have predestination right he didn't have the godhead right why he was under the third light but God's going to restore the fourth light it will be in that light that the bride will have the ability to put out the proper x-ray because instead of losing losing losing she's regaining so what does the X-ray do it's able to go beyond the skin go beyond the bone marrow be able to go inside of you you know and realize that that it's shows pictures on the inside of you that you can't see with your natural eye so when the fourth light comes of the Gospel it discerns between the spirit and the soul and the body it's able to go inside of there and capture that c Gene of God and bring it to a birth which could not happen in the days of Luther that's how come they could smoke a pipe and drink beer and all that sort of thing you ain't going to catch no Holy Ghost filed child of God doing that today why because we're under the power and the influence of the force light which means we're on the final cycle of restoration you see he cannot claim his bride to come and set by him until the four life Messengers come and bring it back then when that cycle is completed the King can stand up and say come my queen the Rapture could not have happened in the days of luer can you imagine the Lord Jesus taking beer drinking pipe smoking people straight from this this world straight into heaven straight into the paradise of God you imagine him in the in the west whenever they shouted and that they thought that was the Holy Ghost you imagine the Pentecostal third light whenever they stood there talked in tongues and all that sort of thing and no doubt a move of God but that was not the power that would bring her back what is it Force life force life so with that life Messengers will come a restoration back to the word so there must be a people that will walk in such completion and Perfection that once The Headstone up at the top when that bride reaches that spot it will absolutely cause the resurrection of all of those that are behind us can you imagine there are millions of them beyond the curtain of time and they are waiting on us Oh Glory to God they are waiting for us to come to that Perfection remember they without us are not made perfect but they were part of the body as God was building it down Through the Ages so what were they a part of the Rob they were a part of the life a part of the life so the life was moving up to the stassel the stalk and all of that the life but what did the what died the denominational system behind them just like it will be in this message there will be a forming of denominational little tidbits of here and there they're already here in the message but yet the real bride is not identified with such stuff she's identified with the life so the life was what moved out of Luther the life was what moved out oh I wish somebody would hear me tonight it was the life that moved out of Pentecost and it's going to be the life that's going to move out of this world don't you understand it's been the life that's been moving in these four restoration messages and it's going to be the life and the light as they couple together that will bring our body change it will actually Force our body from within to be changed it's never been before the messages could never have come out of sequence you could not have put loer in this day God knew better God knew better than to put wesy in this day God knew not to put Pentecost in this day so then why would we want to stop with the Lutheran message why would we want to stop with the methods why would we want to stop with the restoration of gifts we want all of that do we believe in justification do we believe in sanctification do we believe in restoration of gifts but we're not stopping there we're going on you say where we're going to heaven it's the moving of the life as it comes up in the body amen so watch now he says it this way again in the breach and when the lamb comes forth not being a mediator between God and man he becomes becomes a lion when he becomes a lion he takes the book that's his rights God's held it the mystery but now the lamb comes nobody could take the book it's still in the hands of God oh my said no Pope priest whatever it might be they could take the book The Seven Seals hadn't been revealed and remember Paul never preach the seals Paul never even mentions them Paul doesn't even mention the seven Thunders amen praise the Lord Peter does not mention the Seven Seals Peter never mentioned the seven Thunders only John in the New Testament mentioned them and it laid there in the word of God for for Millennia of people trying to understand it and theologians probed at it and they tried to figure it out it was not the appointed time but at the appointed time my you think the least of the people that God would have picked would have been a Kentucky preacher that didn't even have good grammar praise the Lord that didn't graduate from high school never went to Bob Jones University or you know some other great University with a doctorate or degree but yet God called such a man and gave him a message that would actually start a worldwide Revival out of that one Commission of a worldwide Revival started and that's the way the Pentecostal still know him but they say at the end he got off wellever they say he got off we got on Amen look friends you look all over YouTube they're still making videos about brother brandom I saw one the other day of TL Osborne's daughter and she's talking about the great things she saw and the great things that her daddy and mama told her about one Pentecostal after another are still making videos and talking about what a great ministry that brother random had but not the doctrines it's not that that they're focusing on what they wanted was that ability to discern they wanted that ability for the Miracles and the Supernatural and the signs but they want the signs without the forth light you see we don't want to be that way I also want the signs and we have them by the grace of God praise the Lord but I don't want the signs and the miraculous without the accompanyment of the forc life because you can have signs and miss the Rapture you can have Miracles and miss the Rapture but if you've got signs with the force light it's the force light that's leading you the right way to your body change oh praise the Lord don't you love him tonight my notice he says on down here in paragraph or page 101 rather when he comes to take his bride amen now he comes as king he's looking for his Queen now you see as down through the church ages he's looking for redeemable attributes and also the other the category that's in the Book of Life not the Lamb's Book of Life and that is the whosoever will let him come and take of the Water of Life freely so he offers to them Grace his grace is so abundant that he goes beyond the Lamb's Book of Life which is his personal diary and it spills over into the book of life so he still offering salvation I'm grateful for that myself he's still offering salvation for in the Baptist or the Methodist or wherever more we're not the only ones that's saved tonight come on somebody we're not the only ones but yet we are partakers of the light which goes beyond salvation alone I don't know how to be saved I've been saved the majority of my life come on somebody tell me more about how to get out of this world I've done got saved I've done been baptized it took me a couple times before I found the right way but glory to God I finally found it so I've been baptized right I've been saved I've been Sanctified been Justified I spoke in tongues I I've laid hands on the sick I've watched God straighten out crooked eyes I've saw God remove tumors I've seen God do all kinds of things before I ever come to the message so it was not the Miracles that got my attention about this message it was what the messenger had to say I've done seen all kinds of Supernatural that's exactly right so it was not the moving of the supernatural that got my attention but it's when I begin to hear him say words that I had never heard any other preacher talk about and there was something about that voice oh Hallelujah it was not the voice of a Kentucky it had nothing to do with him being born about 35 miles from where I was born at had nothing to do with them squirrels being created about 60 mi from where I live had nothing to do with the little fish being resurrected about 40 mi from where I live I live the majority a big portion of my life before I come to the Lord right there in that little old spot in Kentucky never heard the name William brandham you know why cuz the time hadn't been appointed yet time hadn't been appointed and yet Brother brandom's house right down there in burksville Kentucky I've been there several times down to that little place I've been right there at Dale Hollow where the fish was resurrected been right there in them Hollows where the squirrels were created seen some squirrels that brother Charlie Cox had Frozen that that they had killed in 1958 Joe Frozen in a milk carton see some of the notes that the prophet would would set the doodle and write around on the table and hear all of that well how come that didn't happen to me when I was a boy there was a time appointed there was a time appointed and just as God appointed my time for the light to cross my path so God has appointed my time for me to leave this world so let me tell the devil tonight he ain't got enough drunks to run me over he ain't got enough enough pills he ain't got enough flu he ain't got enough whatever more he can't take me until God is done with me and that ain't just me that's you and you and you and every one of you the devil cannot take us until our purpose is finished on the earth and when that purpose is done I'm ready to Liv to fly out of here anyhow oh my notice he said the Seven Seals hasn't been revealed but when the mediator when his work is done as an intercessor he comes forth John the Elder said he's a lion and he comes forth watching he comes forth to take the book remember as Boaz leaves the gate he's going to bring Ruth the good news she's waiting she's nervous she's anxious maybe asking herself over and over whose wife will I be amen which man will come knocking on this door Hallelujah she may have had a deep deep down set or something you know oh I just got a feeling it's going to be boy somehow or another I just keep I just keep believing God put us together and somehow I just can't keep from believing but she didn't know yet exactly until he comes to claim his possession so he walks to the house knocks on the door you're imagine Ruth shouting over to the door Glory Hallelujah well I got news for some of you around the message that don't believe in shout God's Prophet said even when we get there to Heaven we're going to be shouting so for some of you dry hides that don't believe in shouting I don't know what you all going to do amen now notice he said he done all this now he comes to take his bride he comes now as king he's looking notice he's not looking to save somebody now he's not looking for somebody he can heal somebody he can redeem somebody he can touch he's looking for his Queen so here he comes not as mediator but he he comes as king he's looking for his Queen Amen in this book is the whole secret of it wrapped around Seven Seals he walks right up to the right hand of him remember Brother David de with that right hand and took the book out of his hand and claimed his rights I have died for them I am their kinsman redeemer I am the mediator now he comes from here at this last seal and what does Oh my he do if he's a king he has has to have subjects his subjects is them that he has redeemed and they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption now all the saints of God that have left our assembly our our husbands our wives our children our aunts our uncles our grandparents all of them none of them have have yet seen the Lord Jesus Remember When brother brand went beyond the curtain of time and he said where's Jesus where's Jesus I want to see him and whoever it was talking to him he said he's higher you can't see him now and brother Paul I find that so amazing because it was like those words gave him everything that he needed and it settled him and he never ask it again now we did ask other questions who are these who are them you know what's this this watch that watch's that but he never one more time asked where's Jesus where's Jesus so you imagine each one of them when my little girl crossed over she got in there where's Jesus he's a little bit higher you'll see him after a while that's all she needed to hear Brother Jim bab crossed over oh my all of our brothers and sisters G when they cross if they're still inquiring there's a deep settle something that resolves it see J and brother Junior crossed over he end up where where's Jesus where's Jesus I want to know where Jesus is no they cannot see him until we all see him together you see because they're going by the way of the grave and they will be Sons and Daughters of the Resurrection does not mean they're going straight into his presence it will be one Mass you're talking about millions millions of children of God all of us will look upon him at one instant you're imagine a personage that is so all inspiring that Millions times millions of people will be overwhelmed by the essence of one man his presence his his formidable character his greatness and when we all see him and we're standing there breathlessly Oh Glory to God they cannot come before him until he takes the rights of redemption I'm not taking the book in the sense open the Mysteries that's already happened that happened to us in March of 63 to take the book and loose the mysterious part of the seal but this taking of the book is the word made flesh you see Jesus ain't coming for the seal book he ain't coming for your Bible he didn't say behold I go away to prepare book racks in heaven and if I go away I will come again and receive your Bible unto myself that where I am there your Bible maybe also but behold I go away to prepare a place for you what word made flesh not word made intellect word made what you talking about brother Donnie you see the word is made flesh in an individual when by nature of the new births they live that word automatically out of their soul it's just like a regenerating Force inside of their soul and it is that if you're trying and struggling and I'm trying to be a Christian I'm trying to be a Christian a Christian don't have to try to be a Christian no more then a sinner has to try to be a sinner a sinner is a sinner because of his nature oh sure there'll be struggles that we'll have but when you truly get the baptism of the Holy Ghost my friend it is like a regeneration from within you it is a Dynamo of the Holy Ghost and he lives his life out of you out of you out of me Jesus is a Christian whether he's in your body or my body or brother Scott's body that same life lives the same Holy Ghost path Oh Glory he walks forth from a mediator where death put us in the grave he comes forth with his rights you see the the resurrection can't come until the Son of God remember when he when he raised up the dead he said Marvel not at this for it will come to pass that all that are in the graves will hear the voice of the Son of God and notice how he says that some to the resurrection of life and some to the resurrection of damnation so the Son of God will raise them all before the white throne but we are not going to a white Throne judgment we're going to rewards oh praise the Lord notice here he comes he leaves the throne as an intercessor as a slain lamb to become a lion king to bring the whole world into judgment our Kinsman redeem then is King over a he's got the title deed of redemption it all Lays within his hand I'm glad I know him he says aren't you then claims his inheritance that's the church the bride he claims it what does he do then he disposes of his contestant sat he throws him into a lake of fire with all of those who is inspired by Satan to reject his word of redemption amen now you see soon this is what we're waiting for he will rise from the father's Throne as a mediator we will never see him in a Corporal body as a lamb right notice this and Shepherd the Sheep F this is a beautiful quote sitting here in the Splendor of its beauty on the throne of God is the Lord Jesus Christ and a Corporal body that was raised from the dead as a memorial that someday we coming back to the Homeland praise the Lord never remember he was crucified on that great feast that great feast of the sacrificial land but then in so many days later after that remember the high priest would go out into the corner of the field the field that faced the brightest part of the Sun and they would cut down a sheath for whatever reason that'd always be one spot in the field that the grain would mature first and they would go out it had to be a pretty good siiz handful where a priest would be able to take both hands and gather it together and be something about maybe like this and they would go out there and they'd take the sickle and they'd strike the bottom of it and they'd take it they would take it up to the house of God then they would wave that sheath over the entire Congregation of the children of Israel that were gathered there on the feast day of the Lord and it's the feast of the in gathering and what were they doing this was the first one that come to maturity it was a sign that the whole field is going to come to maturity but this one come first so here was the Lord Jesus in the tide and father allowed him to be cut down and then he raised him up on the Mount of Ascension and he ra waved goodbye now what's he doing he's waving himself over the people not in a natural body but in a glorified body it was not a human Temple that had not been glorified that was raised and waved over the people but it was a resurrected oh I hope you're hearing me tonight A resurrected body was raised on the Mount of Ascension and he waved goodbye to the people what's that a sign of Brothers you all are coming to the Homeland too I'm going to the Homeland today but you and your brothers and your children and your loved ones they also are going to follow me but what kind of body was he in a glorified Temple a glorified Tabernacle remember what it was they see there on the Mount of Mount of Ascension it was the tabernacle of God and John said I looked into the holy city and I saw no Temple thereof for the Lord God and the lamb are the temple singular Lord God and the lamb are the temple thereof so the temple is the human body of the Lord Jesus and the Lord God is that great shech that will be shining all around him merg the father and the son together and you get the visible and the invisible in one great gigantic throne room so he was waved over the people as what a a little beaten body of a 33 year old man and and you know all crippled up and blood all over him no he was waved as a glorified Son of God I'm going to the homand brothers and I'm waving myself over you and I'm letting you know you're coming your day is coming your day is coming your day is coming and you understand when the token comes back and waves over your life it's your identification there ain't enough devils in hell to keep you from going oh glory to God thank you Jesus one day he will rise from that Throne yes his father's Throne he's not on his own Throne he's on the father's throne and he will come back and his throne is to take the Throne of David on Earth so the Lord Jesus has not yet received his own Throne don't you see it would not be becoming for his wife to see him in this position yet he don't have his throne he don't have his crown and he ain't got on his King the garments Glory to God so when he returns back gets up that's what I'm waiting for oh it was awesome when he got up on Resurrection morning this is the getting up time I'm waiting for praise God when he gets up he raises his robes drop around him mediatorial high priest robes they drop when he rises they drop around him and he comes back to the earth I tell you it's going to be a marvelous time you talking about people getting emotional and shouting just wait till that time oh glory to God people thinking there ain't going to be no emotion brother you ain't seen nothing yet till that Resurrection morning you talking about the body of Christ get most y'all think we're just going to raise from the dead and stand there like a bunch of zombies we think we are The Walking Dead the new generation we're just The Walking Dead we don't ever smile we don't ever raise our hand no you need to read a little further in the message you talking about an emotional time do you understand in your body in your new body you will still have emotions the Lord Jesus had did these things about him but remember they're of Eternal value and eternal quality don't think we're going to sat around in heaven all just big old long right what are you doing today nothing what you doing nothing now don't get them okay okay okay I I'm in heaven now we don't shout up here except for brother Donnie he's over word shouting I hear him man Pentecost you talking about an emotional time I don't know how in the world you could keep from getting emotional if your grandma walks in your bathroom I don't know how you going keep from getting emotional your mother walks in your bathroom I don't know how you're going to keep from getting emotional your daughter your son whoever it is walks in your room you oh my you talking about a time I looked at my feets and my Feats look new I looked at my hands and they did too won't it be a time Oh Glory now he said it's going to be a marvelous time you talking about people emotional and shouting just wait till that time just think of it that when we're coming back glory to God again in a preach he leaves the Throne of an intercessor as a slain lamb to be a lion king what's the transition so he moves from being lamb there's no need you will no longer need an intercessor why you get a New Soul you finally got saved you finally got the Holy Ghost no you finally got a human body that match the work of redemption in your soul so your eyes will be changed your mouth will be changed everything about your body will be changed and you'll look out your soul will look out now remember the three in the resurrection is you have the CG which is your germ from God a soul of God that was in God 1965 soul of God that was in God and then you have your theophany what is a theophany it's a word formed body that you bypass to come here we all know what a bypass is you're going around Atlanta you're going around all these different towns and they got 285 and 385 and 485 but yet the main rout down through there's what 85 so what's the bypass you're going around it supposedly it gets you more traffic which I don't understand since you top 16 times around that bypass so here we are we're on the bypass we should have come the straight regular line from the thought to the attribute straight to the flesh man but what do we do we byass the theophany in order to be tested don't you understand but why brother Dar because when it's all said and done we're going to sit around the Throne of God and out of Our Testimony through the ceaseless ages of Eternity it will bring honor and glory and magnification to our King oh can you imagine he could have spoke us into existence and said you and you and you and you and then he could have told us look children I I could have been a Healer I could have been a redeemer but if of course I spoke y'all into existence but instead of him telling us it'll be us telling him oh I hear the prophet said something like this in the adoption series will say oh papa God I was lost and you saved me Papa God I was this and that and you come down and be him telling me but I'll get to tell him praise be to God praise God when the lamb slang walked forward from eternity out of the father's strong thank you Jesus and took his rights it was a judgment seat you were so linked to Mercy and the blood that when you're taken from this Earth there will be no more Mercy for the Gentiles amen about you will pull him from his throne rightow that shouldn't Marvel you you pulled him from Glory I couldn't go to where he was that's right so he came to me Amen brother Paul neither can I go in a Rapture I can't jump high enough I can't there ain't nothing to world I can do so what you going to do meet me in the middle in between my home and his home and project to me a rapturing face once again I'll never be able to do it on my own I'll have to have rapturing Grace rapturing Grace and when The Headstone comes what's it going to be crying Miracles Miracles Miracles Mysteries Mysteries Mysteries you tell me what you're going to be crying Grace Grace Grace what is it unmar favor oh praise God let me find a place to stop he become not a lamb but a lion king and he calls for his Queen to come stand notice not kneel thank you oh oh God be merciful oh God oh God oh God oh God oh God the fourth light will restore you to such a place you'll go straight out of this hell into the presence of almighty God you will not have to kneel on your knees and have a prayer meeting first the word you're sitting under if you're under the fourth light will so prepare you you'll wake up one morning in the middle of lead DEA all hell going on all around you and the next thing you know you see your loved ones and you're changed and you're leaving this world walking right into the presence of God you woke up and lay at a sea and before lunchtime you're walking down streets of God praise be to God so you wake up going through McDonald's eating the MCG griddle and whatever more that you like and your favorite black coffee and you have lunch where at the marriage supper of the Lamb that table spread thousands of miles long you woke up in Le to seea you woke up at back problems you woke up with all kinds of things little did you know this was the Second Great day of your destiny your first one was once you met the Lord Jesus and become regenerated and you started your morning in Leia you turned on your radio you was trying to figure out who's going to be the next president and then you realize you don't even care no more it don't even matter no more because you move beyond the land of presidents you moved beyond the land of prime minister Hallelujah you have moved into the land of the Great King Hallelujah because you have been identified in his word you laid aside whatever he asked you to do if you had to lay aside Mama You' do it if you had to lay aside every friend you ever had you would do it oh brother sister it may seem like a lot in this life when you do it but I guarantee you it'll be worth everything you lay down it'll be worth every trial you go through on that great Resurrection morning when our bodies are [Applause] changed let me close he calls he calls he calls for his Queen to come stand by is said notice here he comes he leaves the throne as an intercessor as a slain lamb to become a lion king to bring the whole world into judgment the third seal will close with this Christ has been doing the kinsman redeemer work now all that understands that say amen he has been doing the work of the kinsman redeemer but there will come a time when the redeeming work will be over and when the redeeming work is over then he leaves the Throne of God where he's seated now but that's not his throne there has to be something to keep the Judgment of God off the Earth to keep it off of me and you so what's on the throne of God not a lion a lamb but when he rises and his robes his lamb robes fall at his feet and the angels look and say today is the day therefore if you have died and entered into the theophany what happened you bring the theophany right to meet the redeemed body amen and if you are here you take the body to meet the theophany don't you understand who's in control you notice how he says it whether you're in the sixth Dimension or these four here therefore if you've died an in into the theophany you bring the theophany you who you the seed the soul the Breath of God you bring the sophony glory to God to meet the redeemed body if you are here you take your body you who see Soul Gene of God you take your body to meet the theop how you doing boy I've been wanting to meet you for a long time and you imagine there you are the seed Gene of God inside of you forces the change from within your soul can don't you see why we have to have the Holy Ghost it ain't enough to have quotes it ain't enough to come to a good church you've got to have that quickening power within you your own Holy Ghost yes sir will hear the voice of the king as he calls the prophet said if you've got that quickening power within you tells us what 1961 that you will call your own body from the dust of the Earth from within you it will hear the voice of the bridegroom he said think of it missing people they can't find you no more more amen you come up together missing with those who's already raised from the dead and you come up missing on the earth I tell you one thing I can't wait for that day for several reasons the devil maybe been laying a big trap for you and boy he's going to spring it on this certain certain day and Jesus said that's great just happens to be the certain day I'm going to call him home and there you're stand there all of a sudden them demons sent up to your house to torment you over here they come contous and mean you know and they're fixing do this and this said

already know cuz he done been thrown down cuz him and the bride can't be up part at the same time now remember he has approached the Throne of God he has walked into that dimension of heaven but he ain't never said one of his dirty ft he ain't never oh Hallelujah to God he ain't never told one of his lies right there because the bride City ain't never been trampled by demons feet oh Hallelujah listen now there will come a time that when the redeeming work will be over and when the redeeming work is over then he leaves the Throne of God receded now but that's not his throne he that overcometh will set with me and my Throne as I have overcome and sat down with my father in his throne Oh Glory to God that is not his throne that belongs to Spirit God Spirit God Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him he he is the Incarnate God which is the same God made incarnate so the lamb is sitting on Spirit God's throne and when he rises and vacates that Throne amen then the dead in Christ shall rise first jump down your with me Brothers to chross the mystery paragraph 2011 Glory someday every knee will bow and every tongue will confess when he leaves the Throne of his father to come forth everybody will bear witness that he is the Son of God but it's too late then amen just exactly what Jesus done is sets at the right hand of God and when he leaves the throne the trumpets will sound every knee shall bow and conf confess to Jesus Christ the son of God oh praise the Lord can I read two more verses of scripture Luke 20:34 Jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but they which shall be accounted Worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither Mary nor are given in marriage now Jesus goes on to tell us in verse 36 neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God being the Children of the Resurrection well say Brother Don what about those of us that are alive and remain we also are children of the Resurrection for the resurrection has happened within our souls you see those that are alive in in Christ Jesus that have raised from the dead if the Lord God allows them to go by the way of the Grave the prophet says these words they are more privileged than we are do you understand those of us that are alive will not go into the sixth Dimension we go straight from these four to the seventh why should we go through the sixth that's the holding place this blessed holding place where our loved ones are but we will go straight from this into the presence of God and here comes all these millions myriads of angels Lord God and they ushering in all around us and the rewards are given out and then we all have supper together Lord God oh what a privilege behold I stand at the door knock and if any man will open unto me I will come in and sck with him or have supper I will have supper with him and he with me me don't you want to go let's B heads together if you would Lord Jesus Lord Jesus father how we thank you for this great privilege that you've given to us to live in this day we are so grateful Lord Jesus that we've heard this Mighty voice the prophet tells us in the Rapture message that your voice will come to this call in the last days a shout a voice a trumpet a message to get your people people together we have already heard the bridegroom call I know people struggle over it and they just they can't figure it out what what we're trying to say but in order to make the Rapture it's not enough to hear the bleeding of the lamb from the cross many have heard his groans and his cries they've opened their heart to accept him as Savior but the bride must know him in a deeper way than just being the Savior she must know him as her mate Brother David beautifully expressed this to here on Sunday of the dying mate the dead mate gives its blood and the living mate receives that blood and then it's turned loose and as it's flopping its wings about it's testifying of the Dead mate Hallelujah we will hear the bridegroom call through this word and we know it's through the revealing of the son of man that the son of man will come down and make his words so real it will unite him and the bride together she will not go to the marriage but to the marriage supper and then he says think of it she's already United Lord if there's one here tonight that is not United with you in this great way I pray you'd speak to their hearts it's phenomenal really that he would make those statements in August of 1964 then he would come to the invisible Union in 1965 and entitled his sermon to the invisible Union of the bride of Christ so by then a great uniting had already started taking place many of us weren't even alive then and some of us were just children at that time but one day we heard the same word and we also United Lord Jesus and we're waiting for you to rise from the mediatorial throne and when you do your changing of garments will be a sign that we're going to change ours and we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Hallelujah father I pray there'd not be a one of us missing here tonight Lord we have children that are backslid we have loved ones that are out of the Ark father in the name of Jesus move on their hearts Lord we know there will not be one child whose name is in that book left here in the time of the Rapture oh Jesus we worship you tonight father those of us that are in May these light rays restore our love our fellowship our forgiveness there's people standing right here in this building tonight Lord are holding grudges against people that done them wrong years ago I pray You' help us to realize we're never going to go any higher until we get to a place that we can forgive people being like you is not just laying hands on the sick but being like you is able to forgive those who have wronged us terribly and you didn't even wait for them to ask for forgiveness you forgave them already I pray Lord Jesus Your Grace would move across this audience tonight and those that are streaming maybe some's holding grudges and holding hard feelings may they realize really the one that's the most affected by that and the most hurt is themsel when we hold bitterness really we the one that's affected the greatest SP may we be able to love like you forgive like you walk like you I don't want to just heal the sick like you I don't want to just set people free like you did I want to love like you did Jesus and the prophet tells us that eternal life is living for others oh he said brother renom I can live for that brother he's a good man he said that's not eternal life but eternal life is living for that man that would kill you if he had the opportunity no doubt Lord a lot of us are still struggling with that help us tonight Jesus anybody honest enough in the building tonight to say brother Donnie I sure have to be honest I struggle with that part anybody honest enough to raise your hand to God oh you might could love me and you might could love your favorite people in the world but what about those that have lied on you those that have broken your heart those that may have even broken up part of your family took something from you maybe money or this or that and it's eat at you and eat at you I tell you right now you'll never get no closer to God until you lay that thing at the feet of Jesus so I'm waiting on them to make it right and while you're waiting on them you're losing ground you're losing ground oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus we worship you tonight father we worship you tonight father Oh Glory to God can we just raise our hands in the presence of the king children let us not just talk about this great truth let us not just rally in a building where it's preached let it be the very motivation of Our Lives let it so live out of us that others will see there's something different about us not just your hair sisters not just the length of your dress but may they sense there's something different about you supernaturally they may not know exactly what it is is but let it be your father let it be your father We Worship You Lord we magnify Your Name Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah would you just reach over and L hand on the person standing by you let's offer a word of prayer for one another just just touch the shoulder if you would father as we have our hands one upon the other now Lord I pray as a body that you would help us we're still dealing with our [Music] Humanity Lord Saturday night was such a display of that these Servants of God up here praying for the people and praying and praying The Virtue going out of us until we had to be carried back into the office and it's amazing Lord as I've seen it happen for years that sometimes when you get to that weakest spot as when you become the greatest conduit I don't know how to get there sooner I would it's just like you pray and you pray and you get weaker and it's like you reach that spot and then when you think I I I need to sit down I I need to stop but it's when the anointing is Flowing so wonderfully and you think oh but I can't stop now I've just arrived I've just got where I need to be to get myself out of the way oh Jesus help us father may you help each one of us tonight Lord that we would be able to lay ourselves on your altar as it were Lord God that your gospel can shine through us love Through Me Jesus heals through me forgive Through Me Lord God some preachers no doubt will be known by the great Supernatural that follows them some preachers will be made known their Fame as we could say it that way will be in the prayer lines how they was able to pray for people and great miraculous took place and others will be known by the great understanding of the word but also believe there'll be some preachers that'll be known because they were able to express the attribute of forgiveness maybe to such a degree that other preachers already struggle to but each of us are chose to reflect Your Glory I just say to you tonight use me for whatever you can use me for when you ordained me you didn't ordain that I would be a great gifted guy and a great guy to do this and that and the other whatever you could get Glory out of my life for father if it's not in the Limelight as it were if it's not to where people even know anything about it it doesn't matter to me take me Jesus Use Me Lord if you want a preacher that needs to be publicly humiliated laughed at ridiculed people call him a blasphemer and whatever more you need one like that Lord if that's what you want from me I'll go that way it might be a heavy position to car [Music] but if this is what you've chosen me for then you'll anoint me you'll help me maybe there's young people here tonight that you will Express Your Glory through them by allowing them to dance and run and shout and the Praises of God there may be others that will stand by and watch them and say oh I wish I could do that but maybe their way is crying and tears pouring out of their eyes for we know crying is an emotion as well oh Jesus whatever you want us to do place this father according to your wisdom let us be what you want us to be Jesus help us Lord oh Father we worship you tonight [Music] Lord we worship you Lord God I offer prayer father for many of our church Lord that's many of them's gone on vacation this week and gone here and there with their family and friends and we pray for them Lord may they go back and hear this

us father there may be ones in this church and we go to the same church and we we may not really like one another that much in the flesh but you've chosen for us to be worshippers together help us to realize one day that thing which strength us now will be laid aside and we truly will be the family of God the way it was intended to [Music] be we worship you now Jesus we worship you now Jesus if there's anyone here tonight that would like to just make a little trip up to the altar I'm not going to form a prayer line now for you but if you just want to come up and talk to the Lord maybe while we've been praying here he's brought something to your heart you just like to lay it at his feet I love the point that brother Daryl brought out about the blind man that the Bible said that he laid aside His Garment brother Daryl said in studying it he found that that was a garment that was given so you would be recognized as a beggar I thought my goodness what an awesome thing imagine what a hard thing it was for him to give that up that was his bread that was his living but he had to lay it aside to get to Jesus maybe you're holding on to your anger your temper a brother has offended you in a great way a sister has offended you but you've not been able to let it go bar a mess why don't you lay that garment aside lay your Grudge aside your unforgiving attitude lay it aside maybe you
