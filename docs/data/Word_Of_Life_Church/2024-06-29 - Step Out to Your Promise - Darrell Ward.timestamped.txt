[51:36] know wanting to have a prayer line if it
[51:39] should go that way and uh we just tried
[51:42] to be just just as concise and and as we
[51:47] can be and not be long at all uh not
[51:49] take much time so we'll just try to
[51:52] enter into the word of God as quick as
[51:53] we can and we trust that something will
[51:55] be said to encourage your faith
[51:57] because you're not healed by sensation
[51:59] you're not healed by emotion you're not
[52:01] healed by a prayer
[52:03] line you're not healed by someone laying
[52:05] hands on
[52:07] you you're healed by
[52:09] faith and if your faith can rise up to
[52:12] receive what he's already done for

[52:21] if you got high blood low blood or no
[52:23] blood God can do something for you
[52:26] tonight amen amen Mark chap 10 we want
[52:29] to start reading at verse
[52:33] 46 and the Bible says
[52:36] this and they came to Jericho and as
[52:39] they went out of Jericho with his
[52:40] disciples and a great number of people
[52:43] blind barus the son of Tas Sat by the
[52:45] highways side
[52:47] begging and when he had heard that it
[52:49] was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry
[52:51] out and say
[52:52] Jesus thou son of David have mercy mercy
[52:56] on
[52:57] me and many charged him that he should
[53:00] hold his
[53:02] peace so he just sat down and folded his
[53:05] arms and thought about something
[53:08] else they said hold your peace but he
[53:10] cried the more a great
[53:13] deal thou son of David have mercy on
[53:18] me and Jesus Stood Still and when Jesus
[53:23] stands still something Good's always
[53:25] going to happen
[53:28] and he commanded him to be called and
[53:30] they called the blind man saiding unto
[53:31] him be of good Comfort arise he calleth
[53:36] thee and he casting away His Garment
[53:38] Rose and came to
[53:41] Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto
[53:44] him what Willl thou that I should do
[53:48] unto
[53:49] thee and the Blind Men said unto him
[53:52] Lord that I may receive my sight
[53:58] and Jesus said unto him go thy
[54:02] way thy emotion thy
[54:05] sensation thy
[54:07] faith thy faith hath made thee whole and
[54:12] immediately he received his sight and
[54:15] followed Jesus in the
[54:18] way may the Lord add the blessing to the
[54:21] reading of his
[54:22] word SS of God what a blessing it is to
[54:25] know
[54:27] that the same Jesus that gave blind
[54:29] barus his
[54:32] sight is the same Jesus who gave Jessica
[54:36] her
[54:39] sight and that same Jesus is in the
[54:43] house
[54:45] tonight let us bow our
[54:47] heads I want to speak to you for just a
[54:50] few minutes as quick as we can on step

[55:08] Lord we thank you for the many blessings
[55:11] you have given
[55:14] us and Lord as we have gathered here
[55:16] this evening and set aside this service
[55:20] we ask Lord that you would come once
[55:22] more and confirm your word to the hearts
[55:25] of your ch
[55:27] children for oh God you're the
[55:30] same who gave the eyes to Blind B ofus
[55:34] you're the same one tonight that can
[55:36] open every eye in this building
[55:39] Lord and those that would be bound dear
[55:42] God by a chain of
[55:44] circumstance that those that would be
[55:46] afflicted by a disease or a report that
[55:49] there's nothing else that can be done
[55:52] you are The God Who changes situations
[55:56] for Lord I have seen you make the lame
[55:58] walk I have seen you open the eyes of
[56:01] the Blind and Cancers disappear there is
[56:04] nothing that you cannot do so Lord once
[56:07] more we look to you and ask God may your
[56:10] word become so
[56:12] real that our faith can rise up dear God
[56:16] and possess that Lord that's been given
[56:19] to us bless your children tonight Lord
[56:22] may they be great
[56:24] testimonies for Lord th know it's my
[56:27] heart if I could Lord
[56:30] myself I would heal
[56:33] everyone but I can't Lord I'm just a
[56:36] man but oh God you're God and you can do
[56:42] anything so Lord use these brothers
[56:44] tonight as we lay hands upon your
[56:47] children Lord may they go forth
[56:50] testifying of a God who cannot fail amen
[56:53] we commit this congregation the ministry
[56:56] of oursel into your hands For Your Glory
[56:59] for we ask these things in Jesus name
[57:02] and the bride says amen God bless you
[57:05] Saints you may be
[57:06] seated speak tonight on step out to your
[57:10] promise now notice I didn't say step out
[57:14] to a
[57:15] promise but I said step out to your
[57:18] promise for you see it must be a
[57:21] personal
[57:22] revelation for the Bible says the
[57:25] promise is unto you
[57:27] the promises unto you and to your
[57:29] children even as far off as many as the
[57:31] Lord Our God shall
[57:34] call and I was thinking of this thing of
[57:36] faith and fear and reminded me of
[57:39] something that the prophet of God said
[57:42] he said I thought tonight that I would
[57:43] talk on faith for a little while just to
[57:46] build up on Christian faith and I find
[57:50] that one of the greatest hindrances that
[57:52] the church has got today is their scared
[57:55] to death
[57:57] and what are you scared about but that's
[58:00] the hour that we're living in when
[58:01] everything is a fear now everything is a
[58:06] phobia I can't even spell
[58:09] phobia we never heard of such as that
[58:11] when I was a boy but now they have
[58:13] balloon phobias and lettuce phobias and
[58:15] Subway phobias and all kinds of phobias
[58:18] why we're living in the era when men's
[58:20] hearts are failing for
[58:22] fear but the prophet said what are you
[58:25] scared about
[58:27] amen one of the greatest hindrances of
[58:29] the church to God today is they're
[58:30] scared to death but what are you scared
[58:32] about that's what I'm wondering if
[58:34] you'll just only realize who you
[58:39] are you don't know who you are you don't
[58:42] know who that is sitting next to you you
[58:43] say yeah that's my neighbor I know him
[58:45] all right but he's a Son of God see
[58:48] adopted by Jesus Christ into the family
[58:51] that's a daughter of God sitting next to
[58:52] you and who are
[58:54] you if you're a Christian if you're a
[58:57] Believer you're a son and daughter of
[58:59] God then what are you scared about ain't
[59:02] no need of being scared this is his
[59:05] house he will take care of
[59:07] it amen as listen to this as long as the
[59:12] devil can keep you
[59:15] scared that's all he wants to
[59:19] do he's got you right
[59:24] then so then we find that
[59:27] Amnesia of not knowing who you are feeds
[59:33] fear think about that that's right what
[59:36] are you scared about it's because you
[59:37] don't know who you
[59:39] are so Amnesia not knowing who you are
[59:42] not knowing your surroundings will
[59:44] produce
[59:46] fear you know I lost my daddy few year
[59:50] ago to
[59:51] alzheimer's it's a terrible disease
[59:56] CA you lose thank you brother Donnie CA
[59:58] you lose them
[1:00:00] twice you lose them before you ever lose
[1:00:05] them so when my daddy got into the
[1:00:07] advanced stages of it we had to put him
[1:00:10] into a unit where they could take better
[1:00:12] care of
[1:00:13] you and they were having a little party
[1:00:16] and I took my daddy over to where the
[1:00:19] the room where they was having the party
[1:00:21] I wrode him in there
[1:00:27] and they were passing out
[1:00:30] gifts and they said James
[1:00:34] Ward but he never
[1:00:38] moved cuz he didn't know who he
[1:00:41] was and I said Daddy you better raise up
[1:00:44] here buddy they they've got a present
[1:00:46] for you it looks really
[1:00:49] good but he never
[1:00:51] moved cuz he didn't know who he was
[1:00:57] you said why do you say that because I
[1:00:59] want you to understand that God comes
[1:01:02] service after service and he speaks your
[1:01:06] name through his
[1:01:09] word but I want you to know that no
[1:01:11] matter how great the message would be no
[1:01:14] matter how wonderful the rich the
[1:01:16] anointing would be if you don't
[1:01:20] recognize that it's for you it will do
[1:01:24] you no good
[1:01:27] good you must recognize that every
[1:01:29] promise in this Bible is your personal
[1:01:34] promise
[1:01:36] hallelujah amen not knowing who you are
[1:01:40] feeds fear but knowing who you are
[1:01:43] produces perfect
[1:01:46] Faith oh come on how could you say that
[1:01:49] because the prophet said Jesus had
[1:01:52] perfect Faith because he knew who he was
[1:01:55] in the the
[1:01:57] word and when you know who you are and
[1:01:59] the Devil comes and says you can't make
[1:02:01] it and you might as well give up and you
[1:02:03] might as well turn back you can tell him
[1:02:05] I came from God I go back to God I've
[1:02:08] already made
[1:02:13] it
[1:02:16] Hallelujah brother bam used this
[1:02:18] illustration several times about a box
[1:02:21] of
[1:02:23] rattlesnakes and he said why does
[1:02:24] someone come up in the morning to your
[1:02:26] door an Express agent today we would say
[1:02:29] FedEx or prime you know but they come up
[1:02:32] with the box of rattles
[1:02:34] snakes and it's got your name on it and
[1:02:37] the Box is doing this because they're
[1:02:39] moving around and you
[1:02:43] hear they're there you see the
[1:02:46] rattlesnakes you hear the rattlesnakes
[1:02:49] you know that they're there just like
[1:02:52] your symptoms is there yeah
[1:02:57] but if you receive
[1:02:59] them they're yours come on now but you
[1:03:03] don't have to take them you can say I
[1:03:06] don't want them but the man can say but
[1:03:08] your name is on the box but I don't want
[1:03:12] them I won't have them and he will do
[1:03:15] everything he can to try to get you to
[1:03:18] take them look at the MRI look at the CT
[1:03:21] scan look at that rash look at that
[1:03:23] Twisted arm look at that Twisted foot
[1:03:25] he'll try everything in the world to get
[1:03:28] you to take
[1:03:33] them and in one sense they're
[1:03:37] yours because it's real
[1:03:41] pain in one sense they're yours in
[1:03:44] another sense they're
[1:03:46] not you might see all your symptoms the
[1:03:49] devil said here it is here's your cancer
[1:03:51] here's your heart trouble here's your
[1:03:53] condition here's your glycom
[1:03:55] here's your blindness but they're not
[1:03:57] yours until you sign for them now if you
[1:04:03] refuse to sign for them he has to take
[1:04:05] them back to the express agent he has to
[1:04:08] send them back to the one who sent
[1:04:12] them by you not accepting your symptoms
[1:04:15] they have to go back they have to go
[1:04:18] back to the one that said
[1:04:20] [Applause]
[1:04:21] them let the devil feel that pain for a
[1:04:24] while all right
[1:04:27] he can stand there and argue as much as
[1:04:28] he wants to but until you take them and
[1:04:31] sign for them they belong to the express
[1:04:34] company until you sign for
[1:04:37] them don't sign
[1:04:41] nothing the devil brings
[1:04:45] you that we're all guilty I am
[1:04:50] too amen I know you're human we're all
[1:04:53] human many times we've signed for stuff
[1:04:56] well I'm getting a
[1:05:01] cold
[1:05:03] amen don't sign for nothing that the
[1:05:05] devil brings
[1:05:07] you I refuse to have it if you won't
[1:05:10] testify that you've got
[1:05:15] it if you won't testify that you got it
[1:05:18] when you testify you still have your
[1:05:20] sickness then the devil keeps it with
[1:05:22] you but if you to testify that you've
[1:05:25] got it he can't give it to you amen
[1:05:28] refuse to testify say I won't have it no
[1:05:31] sir if you receive them you're yours but
[1:05:34] you don't have to take
[1:05:36] them well your name's on it I don't want
[1:05:39] them I don't have to have them but if
[1:05:41] you sign for them and receive them they
[1:05:44] are yours and as long as you testify of
[1:05:47] it the devil will keep it with
[1:05:51] you if that's true for a box of
[1:05:54] rattlesnakes
[1:05:55] Oh Glory to God I got to thinking if
[1:05:58] that's true for a box of rattlesnakes
[1:06:00] would it not be true if an angent from
[1:06:04] Heaven comes and offers you a box and in
[1:06:07] this box is healing it's Joy it's peace
[1:06:11] is a Revival it's Deliverance it's
[1:06:13] Redemption it's got your name on it it's
[1:06:15] for you it's to
[1:06:18] you but if you don't accept it if you
[1:06:21] won't receive it it goes back to the one
[1:06:23] that's in it but if you accept it and
[1:06:26] believe it and confess
[1:06:28] it you can have everything you can have
[1:06:32] everything that's in the
[1:06:34] [Applause]
[1:06:36] Box it's a personal
[1:06:40] possession glory to God the prophet said
[1:06:44] God can only bless
[1:06:47] you as you confess that he's done it for
[1:06:49] you see he's the high priest of our

[1:09:50] that caused him to go blind then after
[1:09:54] all these years of blindness he had took
[1:09:57] on the name of blind barus the beggar
[1:10:02] everyone around him never thought he
[1:10:06] would ever see
[1:10:07] again his very name testified of what
[1:10:11] they believed about it blind barus they
[1:10:15] didn't say blind barus
[1:10:17] until they said blind barus the beggar
[1:10:22] and after all those years people just

[1:10:44] begging for
[1:10:47] coins go with me now as we I just want
[1:10:50] to recreate this for just a wee bit it
[1:10:52] must have been a cold October morning
[1:10:56] that blind b m was getting to the gate
[1:10:59] late and the reason he was late because
[1:11:02] he had dreamed all night
[1:11:05] long that he could see
[1:11:08] again and all the businessmen had done g
[1:11:10] into the City and there was very few
[1:11:12] tourists in them days so what could he
[1:11:15] do he had got to the gate late he
[1:11:17] wouldn't get a
[1:11:18] coin how would he get something to eat
[1:11:21] he listened he could hear no

[1:11:25] was looking
[1:11:28] bad the day had gotten off to a bad
[1:11:32] start it wasn't looking
[1:11:35] good but little did he know oh glory to
[1:11:39] God this would be the last day he would
[1:11:42] have to beg for a coin because of
[1:11:44] blindness this would be the day of his
[1:11:49] Deliverance maybe you woke up this

[1:12:16] deliverance
[1:12:19] Hallelujah so blus took his place by the
[1:12:22] side of the gate he fell around him
[1:12:26] until he found a big Stone and he sat
[1:12:29] down he began to think you know this
[1:12:33] Stone this very Stone I'm sitting on
[1:12:35] right now the power of God shook it off
[1:12:39] the top wall of Jericho and broke that
[1:12:44] wall

[1:13:57] Jesus
[1:14:00] Hallelujah setting in the warm sunshine
[1:14:03] warming himself from the cold morning he
[1:14:06] began to think of what he was dreaming
[1:14:10] the night
[1:14:14] before Oh What a wonderful
[1:14:17] dream I dreamed I could
[1:14:21] see it was so real the dream dream was
[1:14:26] so
[1:14:29] real what made me dream
[1:14:32] that I haven't thought about Sin for
[1:14:37] years I
[1:14:39] wonder is there a
[1:14:42] possibility I could see
[1:14:45] again and maybe you're wondering is
[1:14:47] there a possibility that I won't need
[1:14:49] this cane anymore is there a possibility
[1:14:52] that that painful arthritis will leave
[1:14:54] my joy
[1:14:55] joints listen to me tonight every
[1:14:58] believer in
[1:15:01] here every believer in here ought to
[1:15:03] take the word impossible out of your
[1:15:07] vocabulary for the Bible says in Mark
[1:15:10] 9:23 all things are possible to him that
[1:15:16] believe every believer we don't even
[1:15:18] have a right to say impossible there is
[1:15:21] nothing that's impossible with God and
[1:15:24] his people
[1:15:26] oh
[1:15:31] hallelujah amen the dream was so real it
[1:15:35] changed his thinking of forever being
[1:15:38] blind to a
[1:15:40] possibility of
[1:15:44] sin and if thinking on the dream can do
[1:15:48] that what can thinking on a promise from
[1:15:51] the word of God do knowing that word can
[1:15:55] not
[1:15:57] fail we spend so many time thinking of
[1:16:00] our problems thinking of our fears
[1:16:01] thinking of our afflictions come on
[1:16:04] somebody but what if we thought of the
[1:16:06] possibility we serve a God who can
[1:16:08] change
[1:16:10] that a god whose word cannot fail
[1:16:13] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[1:16:15] word shall never pass
[1:16:18] away Philippians says finally Brethren
[1:16:20] whatsoever things are true whatsoever
[1:16:22] things are honest whatsoever things are
[1:16:24] just what whatever things are pure
[1:16:26] whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever
[1:16:27] things are of a good report if there be
[1:16:29] any virtue if there be any
[1:16:31] praise Lord he didn't say leave them in
[1:16:34] your Bible he said think on these
[1:16:39] things you ought to be thinking theight
[1:16:41] of your healing you ought to be I tell
[1:16:42] you what I'm thinking in the morning I'm
[1:16:44] just going to run about three miles on
[1:16:45] these bad legs cuz it ain't going to be
[1:16:47] bad no more you need to start thinking
[1:16:49] that God's going to do something for you
[1:16:52] think on these things
[1:16:58] so we find blind Barda setting on a rock
[1:17:01] off the walls of Jericho warming
[1:17:04] himself in the sun trying to get a few
[1:17:13] pities he was all
[1:17:16] alone thinking he got to thinking about
[1:17:21] his
[1:17:22] life I remember
[1:17:25] sometimes it's good to slow down and
[1:17:29] remember what good things God have done
[1:17:32] for
[1:17:33] you he never brought us this far to
[1:17:35] leave us he never built a home in us to
[1:17:38] move away he never taught us to swim to
[1:17:41] let us drown and he never lifted us up
[1:17:44] to let us down
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:47] amen you need to remember the god you
[1:17:50] serve he said I remember I used to come
[1:17:54] here with my lamb
[1:17:55] and I I had these Turtle does that would
[1:17:57] that would do tricks to and they would
[1:17:59] help get the attention of the people to
[1:18:01] help me get a few coins what happened to
[1:18:04] those
[1:18:05] doves what
[1:18:08] happened and as The Story Goes they
[1:18:11] begin to remember I
[1:18:14] remember my wife got sick and the
[1:18:18] doctors didn't know what to do and blind
[1:18:21] Barz went behind the house to pray he
[1:18:23] said Lord

[1:18:58] take these two t does and I'll offer
[1:19:00] them to you for a
[1:19:02] sacrifice and he got well she got well

[1:19:15] only little
[1:19:19] girl she got sick with a fever and he
[1:19:23] slipped out found his way out to the
[1:19:25] back of the house and he lifted up those
[1:19:27] blinded
[1:19:28] eyes he said

[1:19:37] dying oh god I've been
[1:19:41] there I need her
[1:19:43] Lord I see the world through her eyes

[1:19:56] I need her Lord she brings me such
[1:20:01] joy and I don't have nothing left but my
[1:20:04] lamb but if you let my baby live I

[1:24:06] him screaming and crying and singing and
[1:24:08] shouting and carrying on there's no way

[1:24:51] to you tonight a person Revelation a
[1:24:55] personal experience let me tell you
[1:24:57] something young people that's all that
[1:24:58] will ever hold you in this hour if
[1:25:00] someone talked you into this message
[1:25:02] someone will talk you out of it but if
[1:25:03] you've got
[1:25:05] the you not long ago I was out in the
[1:25:08] back field praying and I was praying for
[1:25:09] the young people I had a burden for him
[1:25:11] and I was praying for him and I said oh
[1:25:13] God I said are we just getting them to
[1:25:14] shout or are we getting them to Christ
[1:25:17] and while I was praying something spoke
[1:25:18] to my heart and said go ask them go ask
[1:25:21] them are you in the message or is the
[1:25:23] message in in you you see if you're just

[1:25:58] decision just like everyone in this
[1:26:00] building is left with the same decision

[1:26:07] or get up and come to Jesus he was 150
[1:26:11] yards away from Jesus he's totally blind

[1:26:24] devil seen you just ready to receive it
[1:26:28] and the devil said I'll put a little
[1:26:29] damper on her and brother B makes a

[1:26:33] a little bit you know to kind of cool
[1:26:35] her down a little
[1:26:36] bit see but oh my oh my when the devil
[1:26:41] tries to dampen you down or cool you

[1:28:09] you're totally blind just sit still
[1:28:13] it'll be over in a little
[1:28:15] bit just sit still but you see it was
[1:28:20] his moment with Jesus he had an audience
[1:28:23] with the master he couldn't let the
[1:28:25] opportunity pass by like that woman with
[1:28:28] the bloody shoe she saw Jesus was
[1:28:30] passing by her window of opportunity was
[1:28:32] closing she couldn't get over the crowd
[1:28:34] or through the crowd so what did she do
[1:28:36] she went under the
[1:28:37] crowd she never touched his back she
[1:28:40] never touched his arm she never shook
[1:28:42] his hand but she climbed under the
[1:28:44] people and reached out and touched the H
[1:28:47] of His Garment and when she touched the
[1:28:49] him of His Garment the issue of blood
[1:28:51] stopped
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:57] Hallelujah so blind B steps out of

[1:29:19] standing all those were just valid
[1:29:22] reasons of why he shouldn't go while he
[1:29:26] should just sit still reasoning will
[1:29:31] have you to sit
[1:29:34] still but Faith goes into action this is

[1:33:28] right is that not
[1:33:31] true sometimes your doctor is 100% And
[1:33:34] I'm not against doctors friends I worked
[1:33:35] in surgery for years thousands of
[1:33:39] operations I've been on I believe in
[1:33:41] medicine I believe in I've seen people
[1:33:43] at Walmart that I worked
[1:33:45] on I know medicine works but when the
[1:33:49] doctor says he can do nothing for you I
[1:33:52] know someone who can
[1:34:00] amen they told me they said Mr Ward
[1:34:03] there's nothing we can do for your
[1:34:04] little girl I said I know someone who
[1:34:12] can
[1:34:14] amen somebody's words
[1:34:17] right it's either what you're looking at
[1:34:19] or what God says but you see what you're
[1:34:21] looking at it may be right but it it may
[1:34:23] be wrong but if you look at this it's
[1:34:26] always
[1:34:27] right Mark 10:50 I'll hurry he Cast Away
[1:34:30] His Garment and he rose and came to
[1:34:32] Jesus now this beggar garment why is
[1:34:34] this so significant why is it written in
[1:34:36] the scriptures that he rose up and Cast
[1:34:39] Away His Garment this coat because I was
[1:34:42] doing a little bit of research and I
[1:34:43] found that this coat was a government
[1:34:45] issue coat that gave them permission or
[1:34:48] a license to beg it was the evidence
[1:34:51] that he could beg on
[1:34:54] so he needed you see if he threw that
[1:34:56] robe down and he couldn't see he'd have
[1:35:00] to either get somebody to get it for him
[1:35:01] or try to find it himself so for him to
[1:35:04] cast that away he must have been
[1:35:05] thinking of something
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:13] else see him leaving it on the ground it
[1:35:16] indicates how much he believed that
[1:35:18] Jesus said he would restore his
[1:35:21] sight oh brother sister tonight can you
[1:35:24] leave that depression robe can you cast
[1:35:26] that besetting sin robe can you cast
[1:35:28] that arthritis robe can you cast that
[1:35:31] cane robe that eye trouble that fear Ro
[1:35:33] can you leave it on the ground and step
[1:35:35] out toward your
[1:35:38] promise amen cast off that condemnation
[1:35:41] robe if you ask God to forgive you he is
[1:35:44] just to forgive you you've got to accept
[1:35:47] it and believe it and confess it with
[1:35:50] let the devil condemn you
[1:35:54] amen step toward your promise cast it
[1:35:57] off
[1:35:58] tonight he cast off His Garment and he
[1:36:01] went to
[1:36:03] Jesus and Jesus answered and said to him
[1:36:06] what do you want me to
[1:36:11] do you come here tonight for a healing
[1:36:13] service what do you want him to
[1:36:18] do what do you
[1:36:20] want what would you that I should do
[1:36:22] unto thee
[1:36:24] what you want me to
[1:36:27] do said how many of you sick tonight or
[1:36:30] have a need who wants to be healed or
[1:36:32] helped B said he wants to heal you
[1:36:35] tonight he wants to heal you a thousand
[1:36:39] times more than you want to be
[1:36:43] healed so I wonder is it Jesus or
[1:36:51] us hey be
[1:36:54] see and the blind man said to the
[1:36:59] Lord that I might receive my
[1:37:03] sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way
[1:37:07] thy faith ha made thee whole and
[1:37:09] immediately he received his sight and
[1:37:13] followed Jesus in the
[1:37:15] way be of good chair he call it for
[1:37:19] thee he's calling
[1:37:22] you he called him out from the crowd he
[1:37:25] had to step out of the crowd and he's
[1:37:28] doing the same thing right now you have

[1:37:47] when he called him when he called him he
[1:37:50] gave him back his sight when he comes
[1:37:54] don't be afraid to step out and when he
[1:37:57] calls for you he's got something for you
