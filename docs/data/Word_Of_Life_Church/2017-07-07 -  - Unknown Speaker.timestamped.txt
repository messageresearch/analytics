[35:12] lives Lord we know that you're mindful
[35:14] of us would you come by this way to not
[35:17] Lord Jesus
[35:18] whereas bartimaeus was so many many
[35:21] years ago Oh son of David don't pass us
[35:24] by we called upon you not under the name
[35:27] of son of David but under our true
[35:30] dispensation or linked to you and that
[35:32] is our husband our blessed Redeemer with
[35:36] predators speak to us than that father
[35:38] from your word I want to yield myself
[35:42] that you can be able to take this human
[35:44] instrumentality and speak through me to
[35:47] the glory of God in Jesus name and the
[35:51] Saint said God bless you you may be
[35:53] seated
[35:58] her journey is about two thousand years
[36:06] or excuse me two days
[36:12] this has been in the making for a long
[36:15] long time she's been through many
[36:19] dangers toils and snares got delivered
[36:24] of so many habits set free of so many
[36:29] terrible terrible sins he's washed her
[36:34] in his blood
[36:35] rooster from the Adamic nature that she
[36:39] was born with set her free from so many
[36:43] things that she was bound by in sin and
[36:48] yet here she is in this chariot as it's
[36:54] called of cedar the pilasters of silver
[36:59] covered with purple on the top and she's
[37:03] fighting the greatest battle that she's
[37:07] ever felt and that is the battle in her
[37:11] mind she's no longer a southern Galilean
[37:16] girl she's no longer under the control
[37:20] or the dominance of her brothers that
[37:24] can make her go here and go there and do
[37:26] this and that she's free from that she's
[37:30] free from the burning Sun of which she
[37:33] said I am black but comely
[37:36] and the word is in hebrew tanned by the
[37:39] sun which she had many long hours she
[37:42] said I kept my my family she but it did
[37:47] not tend to my own garden because of
[37:50] neglect she's free from that she's no
[37:54] longer subject to these overlords that
[37:57] would try to control her why would she
[38:01] still be fighting battles there she's
[38:05] free from the Lions and the caves that
[38:09] are near the mountain region which she
[38:12] was from near Lebanon she no longer
[38:16] fears the leopards lions and the sayings
[38:19] that was in her home stretch of land
[38:22] where she was from why she still
[38:25] fighting these battles and why does it
[38:29] seem as though these battles in one way
[38:32] are more difficult than even getting
[38:36] saved it makes no sense it would seem
[38:41] the hold of sin would certainly be the
[38:45] most difficult battle anymore - whatever
[38:48] fight to be loosened from that will
[38:52] truly bring the greatest Liberty that a
[38:55] person would ever known in what other
[38:57] battle could even compare to being
[39:00] loosed from sin but you see my brother
[39:04] Adam
[39:04] preached in 1962 and entitled the
[39:08] message the greatest battle ever fought
[39:11] he never said that being a sinner and
[39:14] being loosed from sin was the greatest
[39:18] battle he never said that being loosed
[39:21] from alcohol or cigarettes or
[39:24] pornography or profanity was the
[39:28] greatest battle ever fault but he
[39:32] brought it down to basically when you
[39:34] listened to that sermon down to the
[39:37] Christians the believers that are
[39:42] fighting the greatest battle ever fought
[39:44] not getting saved after you are saved
[39:48] not coming to God but after you come to
[39:52] God learning how to surrender to God
[39:56] knowing then that the sinner coming to
[40:01] God is certainly not the greatest battle
[40:04] a person that would be bound with such
[40:07] filth and decrepid nice of sin yet that
[40:11] but in itself is not the greatest battle
[40:14] that mortal will ever fight in one sense
[40:18] of the word when they come to Christ in
[40:20] the simplicity of believing he is the
[40:24] one taking upon himself their battle of
[40:27] darkness and liberating them from sin
[40:31] but after they become set free then they
[40:35] are the ones that enter into
[40:37] very great battle now let me let me go
[40:41] this direction for just a little bit I
[40:43] know a lot of folks don't like it when
[40:46] you go in this direction dealing with
[40:48] brother branham but I've never been one
[40:50] to really kind of cater to people anyway
[40:52] I want to follow the leading to the Lord
[40:54] that's the most important thing other
[40:57] bam tells us in 19 and 60 the biggest
[41:01] enemy that I've got is William Branham
[41:06] can Happy Valley say amen to that
[41:09] he's always in my way now there's a
[41:16] couple of questions now that I want to
[41:18] ask so brother branham's greatest enemy
[41:22] is William Branham William Branham and
[41:27] brother Branham is not the same person
[41:30] just not brother Donnie and Donnie ain't
[41:36] the same person that brother David and
[41:39] David in you and you and you and you you
[41:42] understand now I know message folks go
[41:45] to get all tore all nervous that ain't
[41:47] that complicated just listen that's the
[41:49] biggest enemy that I've got is William
[41:52] Branham not brother William Branham but
[41:56] William Branham notice now how he severs
[42:00] himself from William Branham the
[42:04] greatest enemy ah God well my question
[42:07] is who's I now you can't say that I is
[42:13] William Branham so I must be somebody
[42:17] different than William Branham the
[42:20] greatest enemy I got is William Branham
[42:23] he's always in listen out some of the
[42:26] persons way so I and my is on the same
[42:31] side and William branham's on the other
[42:33] side
[42:34] ah am I is on warm side and darkness on
[42:39] the other side
[42:41] and go ahead and say man cuz you're the
[42:43] same way now notice he's always in my
[42:46] way he's always in God's way I will say
[42:52] he's always gets in God's way he's too
[42:57] tired he don't want to do this he don't
[43:01] wanna do that if I can just crucify that
[43:05] guy God can use it so the urea is a
[43:11] william branham that is in god's way and
[43:14] here is a william branham that is in
[43:17] brother branham's way and here is a
[43:20] william branham that brother william
[43:22] branham must crucify in order for God to
[43:25] use him oh praise the Lord I said if I
[43:30] can just crucify that guy God can use it
[43:34] God can use this and God can use this
[43:37] body use this microphone now notice how
[43:43] that he likens and you can search us if
[43:45] you like but he uses these terms very
[43:47] very over and over again repetitively in
[43:50] the message that he was simply like a
[43:52] microphone he says that ministers are
[43:54] like a microphone and the microphone is
[43:56] mute and the microphone does not have
[43:58] the ability to speak its own words and
[44:00] he said that he was like a microphone
[44:02] now the problem is that many folks are
[44:05] making him the microphone God you can't
[44:08] make the microphone God because the
[44:10] microphone is mute would it be done to
[44:12] call this Donny Reagan now Donny
[44:15] Reagan's used it ever since it was
[44:17] bought new as a matter of fact it has my
[44:19] name on the body pad right but the Louie
[44:22] has his name on his the visiting
[44:25] Minister had their own it's called
[44:27] vision Minister others has called the
[44:29] pale each one of them are named this one
[44:32] has my name on it nobody uses it but me
[44:35] it's set for me for the travel for the
[44:38] mid range for the mid treble for the
[44:40] bass exactly in the way that I like it
[44:43] so it's set for my voice but no matter
[44:46] how much my name is on the pack
[44:49] I'll tell what you do now next Saturday
[44:51] night when I'm in Switzerland take this
[44:53] microphone and laid upon the pulpit and
[44:55] turn it on and see if it will repeat my
[44:58] words see if it will say what I say
[45:02] tonight praise the Lord it cannot it
[45:05] will not and if it does run that's
[45:09] exactly right
[45:10] now it's the same of any true minister
[45:12] of God so to make brother branham's
[45:15] voice the literal voice of God it's
[45:18] contrary to what he taught my voice no
[45:21] other preachers voice is the literal
[45:23] voice of God there's only been one of
[45:25] those and his name is the Lord Jesus
[45:27] Christ that's right so brother Branham
[45:31] became a microphone now notice this you
[45:34] know I'm looking at this how that he
[45:37] brings us in God can use this body use
[45:41] this microphone it's a mute till I speak
[45:44] in it or somebody else speaks in it but
[45:47] it can't speak itself
[45:49] now what's this battle that we are
[45:52] engaging again it says in perfect change
[45:54] of perfect weakness I've often said the
[45:56] greatest enemy I got is William Branham
[46:00] he is the one that gets in God's way
[46:03] he gets lazy praise the Lord I know
[46:08] friends I know this is not popular but I
[46:10] as I said I really don't care it's the
[46:12] truth we need to hear it so that we can
[46:16] learn if we're going to overcome how
[46:17] many of us overcome well there's only
[46:19] one way we can overcome we've gotta know
[46:22] who our enemy is I mean if you think
[46:25] that tree is your enemy you pull the
[46:27] leaves off of it and you kick it and
[46:28] turning over and turn it upside down all
[46:31] you're going to do is get hot and sweats
[46:33] going to run down your face and your
[46:35] fragrance is going to be tore all the
[46:36] pieces and when you get down you still
[46:38] got your enemy if you think that
[46:41] Gatorades your enemy when you get done
[46:43] you know what you ain't you ain't done
[46:44] that's it but if you can identify who
[46:47] your enemy is and learn how to fight
[46:50] your enemy it will change your entire
[46:52] world
[46:53] that's right notice he's the one that
[46:56] gets in God's Way
[46:58] he gets lazy he's the one that gets to a
[47:01] place sometimes he thinks he can do
[47:04] something about it now notice this
[47:06] William Branham so this William Branham
[47:09] sometimes get to a place that he's lazy
[47:12] there's other times that William Branham
[47:15] would get to a place and he thought he
[47:17] could do something about it now this is
[47:20] you I'm talking about even though you're
[47:22] named a William Branham but this is a
[47:24] very epitome of us all we're never all
[47:27] exactly the same on the same day or in
[47:29] the same aisle really we can change from
[47:32] one thing to another so sometimes we're
[47:34] lazy and then other times we think we've
[47:36] got the answer and other times are not
[47:39] really sure so we just go back and forth
[47:41] and back and forth and that's what gets
[47:44] in God's Way rather Brennaman who said
[47:47] that he was exactly the same way by the
[47:49] RAM got lazy in you Christians ever get
[47:53] lazy brother Ram got lazy then there
[47:56] will be times he said he thinks he can
[47:58] do something about it and what he does
[48:00] that shoves God right out of the picture
[48:04] but when I can get rid of that guy when
[48:08] I can get to a place that is out of the
[48:10] way then God can come over and do things
[48:14] that william branham knows nothing about
[48:18] can happy valley say amen to that God
[48:21] can do it in a way that william branham
[48:24] knows nothing about it that's when God
[48:26] can use you that's what he can use any
[48:28] of you he can use anybody when we get
[48:31] out of the way but as long as we got
[48:33] ourselves in the way then we cannot now
[48:36] this is the battle you see when you as a
[48:39] sinner it was not you battling trying to
[48:42] get yourself out of the way you cut him
[48:43] God didn't ask you to get yourself out
[48:46] of the way when you was a sinner he
[48:47] simply asked you to take his atonement
[48:50] for your sin that imply the blood and
[48:52] bring you into the work of
[48:53] reconciliation but now that you're a
[48:55] child of God it is a day to
[48:58] a battle and this is why Paul said that
[49:00] I die daily here talking about the sin
[49:03] nature the sin nature god when he got
[49:05] born again it is the human makeup it is
[49:08] your makeup or your human nature that we
[49:11] deal with every day oh my
[49:15] notice this again he says improving his
[49:17] word 1964 William Branham is the
[49:20] greatest enemy I got now watch again
[49:24] he's separating William Branham from I
[49:28] now wonder how God feels and I wonder
[49:31] how brother Brandon would feel when
[49:33] people make an idol out of brother
[49:36] branham's greatest enemy according to
[49:41] him his greatest enemy was his flesh and
[49:44] yet people idolized brother branham's
[49:47] greatest enemy oh now don't sit don't
[49:54] judge them too bad because most of us
[49:56] did the same thing to ourselves now you
[50:00] see if we really believe that we are our
[50:03] greatest enemy I think we would attack
[50:06] ourselves in a much more aggressive way
[50:09] and we would attack others in a less
[50:12] aggressively because we would know
[50:15] really we are our enemy anyway it's not
[50:18] your husband your wife your pastor the
[50:20] Deacons and so on but it is yourself now
[50:23] we say we believe that and we say Amen
[50:25] to it but by our actions it is evident
[50:28] we do not believe it the way he believed
[50:30] it about himself now he really believed
[50:33] that William Branham was his enemy
[50:35] praise the Lord
[50:36] now if we believe the same thing then
[50:39] will not we take the same mindset toward
[50:42] him not notice he said William Branham
[50:44] is the greatest enemy our God see but
[50:46] when I can get him out of the way then
[50:48] Jesus Christ can use the body so there
[50:51] no doubt if brother branham's greatest
[50:53] enemy was William Branham then our
[50:56] greatest enemy will be us you agree with
[50:58] me so far now once again he says I used
[51:01] to preach over the Baptist Church a
[51:03] little sermon I called it let loose and
[51:05] let God that's I just let loose and that
[51:07] God as always you've got yourself into
[51:09] it there
[51:10] no way don't you love him theological
[51:12] terms there ain't no way you know who
[51:15] the biggest enemy I gots william branham
[51:17] he's always in god's way if I could just
[51:21] get him out of the way then God can go
[51:24] to work that's your worst enemy is
[51:27] yourself I'm going to say it again
[51:32] that's your worse enemy it is yourself
[51:36] I'm going to say it again that is your
[51:38] worst enemy it is yourself that's better
[51:42] make it that you are sending me it as
[51:44] yourself just get yourself out of the
[51:47] way then God can go to work now be
[51:50] careful of your associates when you get
[51:53] out there and get among the people this
[51:55] one begin to tell you this and this one
[51:57] back then you get yourself all mixed up
[51:59] and you don't know what you do believe
[52:02] now why is this very important because
[52:04] the type of things we feed on type of
[52:07] preachers we listen to has a great
[52:09] impact upon our stand on the gospel
[52:11] notice again now this is a very peculiar
[52:14] quote you have to really listen to it
[52:15] several times give me give time to the
[52:18] old fashioned heartfelt pouring out of
[52:20] the Lord Jesus Christ until the Holy
[52:23] Ghost pours down upon your soul you'll
[52:27] get besides yourself
[52:30] now listen you'll get massaged yourself
[52:34] maybe you can get with Jesus if you get
[52:39] away from yourself once notice how you
[52:43] can't be with yourself and Jesus you
[52:47] find out you're the biggest enemy you
[52:50] got now listen you can't be with
[52:54] yourself and Jesus so what you want to
[52:57] do is get besides yourself now in the
[53:01] sense I'm not talking about just a
[53:02] static warship and jumping up and down
[53:04] and all that but get besides yourself
[53:07] get yourself where it needs to be not in
[53:10] the control tower of you but beside you
[53:13] so you can get with Jesus now what we're
[53:16] trying to different well all the
[53:18] Christianity in this a is merging you
[53:20] and Jesus and your nature on the same
[53:22] thing just put it all one big bow and
[53:24] let God work it out it'll never work
[53:26] you've got to get yourself out of the
[53:28] way and get you your soul in with Jesus
[53:31] but if you try to take them three and
[53:33] mix it together you're gonna have a mess
[53:35] you try to take your human makeup all
[53:37] your fears your complexes your
[53:39] inferiority and all that together let
[53:41] that dominate you know now Satan will
[53:45] try to convince us that our dearest
[53:48] closest friends is after all who do you
[53:56] talk to more than anybody else who do
[53:59] you trust more than anybody else who do
[54:02] you love more thinking about oh my
[54:06] goodness here we go in reality most of
[54:11] us subconsciously would consider
[54:14] ourselves our closest dearest
[54:18] trustworthy friend oh Jesus help us but
[54:29] there put me to more services and you'll
[54:31] have a break I'll be gone for a while
[54:32] now notice this he says a man never
[54:37] knows what it is to live a victorious
[54:40] life until he's completely over God and
[54:43] then he asked the question who himself
[54:46] that's the biggest enemy you got is your
[54:51] self but if you believe yourself is your
[54:56] friend will you try to overcome yourself
[55:00] or will you try to subdue yourself or
[55:05] will you not cater to yourself so if
[55:07] yourself tells you brother Donnie don't
[55:09] like you or the church don't like you or
[55:12] God don't love you what most people will
[55:14] believe who their closest friend so then
[55:18] they set there and they hear me preach
[55:20] or other ministers briefs and they will
[55:23] hear that word through what their
[55:25] closest friends interpretation so when
[55:29] they get a text
[55:30] they read that text through their
[55:32] closest friends interpretation which is
[55:35] complexes and fears and in very Ortiz
[55:37] and Oh Lord the further I go the Quadra
[55:40] y'all will get why because our friend
[55:43] our dearest closest personal friend is
[55:47] the one that we give the most credence
[55:50] to oh thank you Jesus
[55:56] notice instant reproach for the cause of
[55:59] the word brother Mercedes praying father
[56:01] he goes on he says in this prayer it's
[56:03] really touching to hear him say but he
[56:05] said heal the sick afflicted that's
[56:07] among us bind up the brokenhearted Lord
[56:09] we went through so much my heart's got
[56:13] so many scars on it Lord from hard
[56:17] battles I'm a tall veteran help me Lord
[56:20] I need your help help me Lord I need
[56:28] your help now remember we're in the
[56:30] greatest battle that's ever been fought
[56:32] and when you listen to this in 1962
[56:34] you'll hear brother Branham said the
[56:35] greatest battle that's ever been fought
[56:37] is right in the future fixing to happen
[56:39] when him going on a 62 he said it's
[56:42] fixing to take place and soldiers truly
[56:44] we are in that battle right now now
[56:48] because of all that we are in the
[56:51] natural sense of see taste feel smell
[56:53] hear love imagination conscience memory
[56:55] and all the aspects of the gates of the
[56:57] flesh and the spirit and the main one of
[56:59] course to the sola supreme moral agency
[57:01] then satan has ten gates by which he
[57:04] tries to reach us and that is to the
[57:06] outer realm and then the spirit realm
[57:08] and on the inside is exactly where the
[57:10] seat of life ways but yet satan doesn't
[57:13] even have to have direct access to the
[57:16] soul in order to rob us a peace joy
[57:19] victory and all of that because when we
[57:21] become converted we are a new creation
[57:23] in the same old temple so we are born
[57:26] again added breath of God the seed of
[57:29] God inside of us
[57:30] it's quickened but the human element is
[57:32] still there and Satan can still
[57:35] aggravate is he can make a sick
[57:37] put sickness afflictions and we get in
[57:39] our mind this person no lock us in that
[57:41] one don't like us and God don't care if
[57:43] I ever die you know whatever more that
[57:45] we go through and if that is our closest
[57:48] dearest friend then when we go to
[57:50] talking to our self then if that's who
[57:53] we have the confidence in no matter what
[57:56] anybody else tells us they can come up
[57:58] and say look brother I love you I love
[57:59] you but if your dearest friend tells you
[58:02] they don't love you that's the gospel
[58:04] because that's the one that we paid the
[58:08] most attention to oh mama
[58:12] now why is that though it's because the
[58:15] two outer elements would still remain
[58:17] unconverted and this is the greatest
[58:19] battle that's ever been fought God is
[58:21] calling for every seed of Abraham to
[58:24] separate themselves from ck's fields now
[58:26] here imagination conscious memory reason
[58:29] and affection you imagine God is calling
[58:31] you to separate yourself from yourself
[58:35] this is a lot of friends yes as those
[58:38] it's going to take the rapture and only
[58:40] those what's this in standing in the gap
[58:43] he says I become an old man an old
[58:46] veteran preacher and had a lot of hard
[58:49] battles oh my and maybe I'm scarred all
[58:53] cut out on the inside from fights
[58:56] because my Lord the Lord gave me was not
[59:00] to back to kiss the babies and marry the
[59:02] young and bury the dead but it was to
[59:04] hold a two-handed sword at the
[59:05] battlefront against the wiles of
[59:08] paganism and demonology and the powers
[59:11] of darkness inside it were the Word of
[59:12] God till I seen the enemy defeated I've
[59:15] been cut deep many times I remember just
[59:18] because you are a man of Valor because
[59:22] you are a great soldier even a great
[59:24] general as he was does not mean that you
[59:27] will leave the battle without being
[59:29] wounded and many times better animals
[59:31] greatly wounded he was wounded by
[59:33] enemies he was wounded by friends he was
[59:36] wounded no doubt my family and those of
[59:38] us around him as we all have been now
[59:41] every one of us said in here tonight
[59:42] that if you've been a Christian very
[59:44] long no doubt you have been wounded
[59:46] I prayed to God if I've ever wounded you
[59:48] forgive me now if the word has wounded
[59:51] ship I refuse to apologize for that
[59:53] but if I wounded you as a man I beg your
[59:56] forgiveness because you have enough
[59:58] wounds the way it is about me adding
[1:00:00] more but I figure as long as I'm your
[1:00:02] pastor I'm going to keep on wounding as
[1:00:05] far as the word so I'll go ahead and let
[1:00:07] you know that but whatever we see now
[1:00:11] that the human being because of the the
[1:00:15] way that were designed these things
[1:00:18] certainly can affect us how well your
[1:00:20] brother branham from his very heart
[1:00:21] saying that he's wounded am i this
[1:00:24] reproach for the word 1962 and then
[1:00:26] about six months or so later he's saying
[1:00:28] it a little bit more now the scars are
[1:00:30] coming out so it is the scars from war
[1:00:33] not because the sin didn't run around
[1:00:35] with other people's wives trying to
[1:00:37] steal money or any that sort of thing
[1:00:39] but it was because of the particular
[1:00:41] call that God had given him he was not a
[1:00:44] James as we've been looking on the book
[1:00:45] of Acts that James are so loved and
[1:00:47] respected by the Jews and James is not a
[1:00:50] controversial sort of guy Peter could go
[1:00:52] and preach among the Jews they didn't
[1:00:53] hang him up I've get one or two Paul but
[1:00:55] God has got different men in different
[1:00:57] positions and it's very tough on men
[1:01:00] like Paul right brother Branham who have
[1:01:01] a very difficult role and because of
[1:01:04] that brother Branham had got wounded
[1:01:06] many many times he held his scars very
[1:01:09] well he was able to hide them very very
[1:01:12] well but yet he come to a spot to where
[1:01:15] that they begin to leech out of him as
[1:01:17] it was and begin to affect his heart and
[1:01:20] his conduct and his behavior toward
[1:01:23] those that he was sent to personal come
[1:01:25] on go get quad on me you know this is
[1:01:26] true he said I'm all scarred and cut up
[1:01:29] on the inside now he says this is what
[1:01:32] God called him to be and the last 5-6
[1:01:34] Verwoerd's there he says I've been cut
[1:01:36] deep many times now Satan of course
[1:01:39] knowing this and he's been dealing with
[1:01:41] human beings for six thousand years now
[1:01:43] so as he learns unlike you and I Satan
[1:01:47] no doubt has as we would say in a sense
[1:01:49] of perfect recall of remembering all the
[1:01:51] battles all the weaknesses all the
[1:01:53] frailties of dealing with human beings
[1:01:55] so whenever he
[1:01:56] learn something he can apply that to the
[1:01:58] next one the next one the next one and
[1:02:00] when he finds your repetitive pattern he
[1:02:02] knows exactly what to do against you and
[1:02:04] I in order to try to defeat us well he'd
[1:02:07] found that brother branham was quiet all
[1:02:09] night he was quite a soldier quite a
[1:02:11] general quite a man al valor but he also
[1:02:14] found he was silly human me autocad race
[1:02:18] you are I don't care what prophet pastor
[1:02:20] singer whatever you are you're still a
[1:02:22] human being now in this brother enemies
[1:02:25] reached the place to where that he's
[1:02:27] fighting this this war that's going on
[1:02:29] was in himself
[1:02:31] you remember standing in the gap it's
[1:02:32] not one probably the lot of message
[1:02:34] folks deliver player in their church
[1:02:35] because it displaces humanity a brother
[1:02:39] branham but I can follow a man like this
[1:02:41] I can follow a man that admit he was
[1:02:44] wrong
[1:02:44] come on I know some of you don't like it
[1:02:47] because you're going to idolize his
[1:02:48] flesh huh huh you want to worship
[1:02:50] William Brown I'll worship in the Lord
[1:02:52] Jesus I want to identify this man that
[1:02:56] William Branham said was his enemy
[1:02:58] because it will help me identify my
[1:03:01] enemy my enemy is not William Branham
[1:03:04] it's not Jim Bob it's not David Siler
[1:03:06] it's Donny Reagan will the true Donny
[1:03:09] Reagan please stand up now I'm standing
[1:03:17] you see this guy right here he wants to
[1:03:19] cook my lady that country shut your
[1:03:20] mouth get Elaine to real Tommy Reagan
[1:03:27] what's now standing of the gap paragraph
[1:03:29] 122 I let the sick lay I want the Lord
[1:03:37] to tell me where to go and not to and
[1:03:39] that's wrong I've built myself a complex
[1:03:44] because the people didn't hear my
[1:03:46] message everybody okay to this now we're
[1:03:54] talking about friends Elijah the
[1:03:57] greatest man as far as ministry next to
[1:04:01] the Lord Jesus but it was a man with a
[1:04:05] ministry and as long as the man is there
[1:04:08] this can happen now for you all your
[1:04:12] brother doesn't do it may no but run the
[1:04:15] parallel in your own life what we're
[1:04:18] fixing to find is a prophet of God that
[1:04:20] is called to minister to the sick
[1:04:22] Minister the message of the word they
[1:04:24] get a loss of feeling for the people
[1:04:26] another can become so stressed with her
[1:04:30] children a father can become so stressed
[1:04:34] with work and with family and with this
[1:04:37] and that another never enough time never
[1:04:39] enough money never enough this never
[1:04:41] enough set and yet he's still in the
[1:04:43] role of father a mother still in the
[1:04:45] role of mother a deacon can still be in
[1:04:47] the role of deacon but yet we lose
[1:04:49] something in our heart now watch this is
[1:04:56] the very heart now this man that we see
[1:04:59] I let the sick way I built myself a
[1:05:02] complex because the people didn't hear
[1:05:05] my message and God forbid that I try to
[1:05:07] compare the life like Moses but that's
[1:05:09] exactly what Moses did the people
[1:05:12] wouldn't listen to him and when he come
[1:05:13] to deliver them so he just left him
[1:05:16] alone and went into the wilderness but
[1:05:19] God turned him around he long forgot the
[1:05:25] suffering people
[1:05:28] Moses forgot how in the world could you
[1:05:30] forget the suffering people because your
[1:05:34] best friend you see the longer we listen
[1:05:38] to
[1:05:39] our best friend the worse we get I hate
[1:05:46] to tell you all tonight the child's best
[1:05:48] friend's a two-faced liar ain't nothing
[1:05:52] but a hypocrite he'll lie to you on
[1:05:54] Monday he'll lie to you through Sunday
[1:05:56] he'll lie 24/7 come on I'm talking about
[1:06:02] your feelings I'm talking about your
[1:06:03] imagination I'm talking about your
[1:06:06] memory don't you understand for many of
[1:06:08] us the person that we have made as our
[1:06:10] best friend
[1:06:12] our closest confidant is a liar if I
[1:06:21] lied to you folks half as much as you
[1:06:24] lie to yourself you would have tarred
[1:06:27] and feathered me and yet you will lie to
[1:06:31] yourself and believe yourself daily
[1:06:35] yourself or say you ain't saved you
[1:06:38] don't feel I say you can while I even
[1:06:39] read the Bible you do get now the Bible

[1:06:43] another wife and go to church you don't
[1:06:45] get nothing out of shirt he's a liar you
[1:06:47] do get something if you come at a
[1:06:49] halfway attitude you able to leave
[1:06:52] you're not without something out of the
[1:06:54] service but you're listening to your
[1:06:56] lying South Omaha
[1:07:05] he says Moses lost the feeling of his
[1:07:08] people because they wouldn't listen to
[1:07:09] him brother Roy and I remember in this
[1:07:12] story here in Roy Roberts inhabit a
[1:07:13] dream about brother randomly seen
[1:07:15] brother Branham carried up to a certain
[1:07:16] place and seen brother bedroom changed
[1:07:18] now brother Raymond's going to relate to
[1:07:19] this remember brother Roy in your dream
[1:07:21] and now I cannot go with a ministry like
[1:07:23] that until I feel different in my heart
[1:07:25] about it no matter if God did tell me
[1:07:28] whoa
[1:07:32] okay so God told him to go back I say I
[1:07:34] can't do it God I'm sorry
[1:07:36] oh dude chief
[1:07:41] where the gym is my life insurance paid
[1:07:43] that Betty I'm not needed after this
[1:07:45] service notice no matter of God did tell
[1:07:50] me but that is to change the scene in
[1:07:52] the dream role robertson saw brother
[1:07:54] Branham changed what was it his heart
[1:07:57] his attitude why his best friend been
[1:08:01] lying to him
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:06] the William Branham that his heavens
[1:08:08] greatest enemy that William branham's
[1:08:10] got a big mouth oh Jesus he's been lying
[1:08:15] come on go children don't recollect or
[1:08:17] by saying I know by steam he was a
[1:08:19] sinner he needed to be saved like you
[1:08:22] needed to be saying he had to have the
[1:08:23] Holy Ghost he had to bring William
[1:08:25] Branham subject don't idolize that man's
[1:08:27] flesh you'll make yourself on a dollar
[1:08:30] to your Brice same the Holy Ghost notice
[1:08:40] he said something's got to change me
[1:08:45] because I'm a heart if I go out there
[1:08:47] feeling the way I do now I still feel
[1:08:50] that they also heard that message and
[1:08:52] they also done it I don't have the
[1:08:53] feeling for the people that I should
[1:08:55] have as I said I can follow up man like
[1:08:58] this to me this is a big man it ain't a
[1:09:04] big man that has his faults and has
[1:09:07] everything about income on children
[1:09:09] that's nothing but a coward a lot of
[1:09:11] preachers want you to think they never
[1:09:12] go through no battles he's a liar
[1:09:14] preachers fight hell they get
[1:09:16] discouraged they get down you get down
[1:09:18] brother don't I do get down I did weary
[1:09:21] I think what what's the use even go to
[1:09:23] church anymore and preach people come
[1:09:25] and they won't - don't come they don't
[1:09:26] want to what differences in math I'm
[1:09:28] gonna preach it in head
[1:09:30] to do my best for God it's up to you
[1:09:32] what you do with it oh I've gotta keep
[1:09:34] driving over the David I'm waiting on
[1:09:36] you to encourage me I appreciate it when
[1:09:38] you do but there's times I've got to
[1:09:41] encourage myself and I've got to say
[1:09:43] Johnny you're up on the wall and you're
[1:09:46] doing a good work and you are not coming
[1:09:48] down and my friend Donny will say I'm
[1:09:51] tired of this I'm weary of this and the
[1:09:54] seat of God will say shut your mouth you
[1:09:57] are not my friend you are a liar get
[1:10:00] behind me Oh notice he said I don't have
[1:10:11] the feeling for the people but I should
[1:10:16] have until I can get that feeling
[1:10:21] there's no need of me going because I'd
[1:10:25] be a hypocrite so his brother branham
[1:10:31] back slid his brother branham lost the
[1:10:34] Holy Ghost where's the problem lies in
[1:10:40] the realm of feeling all these years
[1:10:49] I've tried to serve him with a true
[1:10:50] heart and I won't go out there being a
[1:10:52] hypocrite I'd go to I got a feel that
[1:10:56] that isn't Ricky and Rick Adam and
[1:10:57] remember the Lord rebuked him for that
[1:10:59] and it isn't that virtuous god's
[1:11:01] children that's in bondage and I must go
[1:11:03] to them until I can feel that way oh
[1:11:06] gotta be kidding me until I can feel
[1:11:13] that way oh Jesus there's no need to be
[1:11:17] gone I'd be ahead today guys go tell us
[1:11:19] the remedy most
[1:11:26] you can say while friends a lot of the
[1:11:28] idol worshipers can't listen to this
[1:11:30] tape it totally destroys their God image
[1:11:36] don't destroy my god image because I
[1:11:38] don't have a God image of other enim
[1:11:40] I've got a God image of Jesus Christ
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:46] can't you say this is the william
[1:11:49] branham that was his enemy if you'll see
[1:11:54] him you'll see yourself if you don't see
[1:11:57] brother Brennan rot you'll never see
[1:11:59] yourself right if you don't see me
[1:12:01] Roddy's your posture you'll never see
[1:12:03] yourself right if you put me in this
[1:12:05] holy image old brother Donnie is always
[1:12:07] so strong he's always so good he'll
[1:12:09] always be here well ah make no man no
[1:12:18] man your ultimate example but Jesus
[1:12:22] Christ on the throne and leave in there
[1:12:24] no preacher no deacon nobody else right
[1:12:31] mama notices he says I'll just have to
[1:12:35] loaf around preach some conventions and
[1:12:39] things but wait dis loaf are you still
[1:12:46] going to get a salary
[1:12:49] you didn't say that it what what's going
[1:12:56] on they had been saved got rid of a
[1:12:59] temper
[1:13:00] been delivered of so many things but now
[1:13:04] the greatest battle ever false going on
[1:13:06] to William Branham against brother
[1:13:08] Branham so it's William Branham against
[1:13:13] brother William Branham there's only one
[1:13:14] word difference rather on the word word
[1:13:18] one word difference swing you and
[1:13:20] yourself and that's brother or sister
[1:13:21] god so they all need to sever your
[1:13:26] friendship to not face up Jordan seven
[1:13:30] just tell your closest friend move out
[1:13:34] from this point on I refuse to listen to
[1:13:38] your life if you say one more lie to me
[1:13:40] almost smacked you in the mouth well
[1:13:47] praise the Lord
[1:13:50] you talk about something to me listen
[1:13:53] fish and pretty girl for 73 would you do
[1:13:56] this one favor for me now both hearing
[1:14:00] on the tapes also you brethren pray that
[1:14:04] God will place into my heart that's
[1:14:09] something that I lost out there that
[1:14:14] complex it's so easy to build a complex
[1:14:21] now remember complex has nothing to do
[1:14:22] so you don't get complexes from the
[1:14:25] blood of Jesus you don't get complexes
[1:14:28] from the baptism the Holy Ghost you get
[1:14:30] them from yourself sometimes it comes
[1:14:33] from other people sometimes are
[1:14:35] inherited but it's basically the outer
[1:14:36] two realms I had an interview the other
[1:14:39] day with my brother way sitting here
[1:14:41] Sammy here in front a good man but built
[1:14:44] himself around the complex another kind
[1:14:47] of a complex did the same thing but the
[1:14:52] way you can so easy so easily do it
[1:14:55] it's just Allison how easy it is to
[1:14:57] build a complex you can so easy good
[1:15:00] you just get a little something no oh
[1:15:06] you mean we feel complexes from the mind
[1:15:09] out more children you get a little
[1:15:15] something in your mind and keep thinking
[1:15:18] that way now those of you that are
[1:15:26] familiar with the service right here
[1:15:27] when quoting from brother Wei is
[1:15:30] standing right here in front of brother
[1:15:31] Brennan pretty close up to the pulpit
[1:15:33] area his wife is a nurse brother Wei
[1:15:37] resents what brother Branham says and he
[1:15:42] dies in a heart attack okay they're in
[1:15:53] enough ambulances in Carter County in
[1:15:54] Washington County so for your own health
[1:15:58] don't resent what's been said tonight
[1:16:02] [Music]
[1:16:02] [Applause]
[1:16:06] now this is serious friend this is not
[1:16:09] playing now you remember that brother
[1:16:13] Brennaman by God's grace was able to
[1:16:15] pray over this man and raise him back up
[1:16:16] and I hear he talks about this
[1:16:18] occurrence happening in dimensions in
[1:16:20] Chicago a few three weeks ago while I
[1:16:22] was speaking a man standing before sees
[1:16:24] an Englishman's wife is Norwegian very
[1:16:26] fine nurse him a very fine man and so
[1:16:28] the man I was speaking of complexes and
[1:16:30] the man kind of resented it when I said
[1:16:34] it I told him a couple years ago when I
[1:16:36] first met him that he was bothered with
[1:16:37] a murmur in his heart he hardly didn't
[1:16:40] want to believe that I think at first
[1:16:41] and then finally the doctor told him
[1:16:42] that he had the murmur his art and that
[1:16:44] morning he had kind of bent a little
[1:16:46] Torah and when I said that he resented
[1:16:50] it and quickly dropped dead right on the
[1:16:54] for oh my fell out on the floor and his
[1:16:57] wife got down to examine him and he was
[1:17:00] gone now look at what this man which is
[1:17:04] very unusual for brother Brennan to do
[1:17:05] at this wedding I've never found myself
[1:17:07] anyplace else what he quite did it this
[1:17:09] way that he would you know expose a
[1:17:10] person in one sense like
[1:17:12] and the man it calls him to go in to
[1:17:14] resemble what you might do any of us the
[1:17:16] same way so here he calls it out and
[1:17:18] then the man dies and brother BAM goes
[1:17:20] and by the grace of God is to say he was
[1:17:21] able to bring the men back to life again
[1:17:23] but what do receive in this man now had
[1:17:26] the complex built from listening to all
[1:17:29] these things whatever it was that the
[1:17:31] man was troubled about hearing it
[1:17:33] exposed publicly caused such a rise
[1:17:36] inside of this and now it becomes so
[1:17:39] great and he becomes so resentful toward
[1:17:42] the prophet of God
[1:17:44] that his life is cut off momentarily oh
[1:17:47] god help us from that now you imagine
[1:17:50] then when we go to believing if yourself
[1:17:54] is your best friend then when we accept
[1:17:57] ourselves as our best friend we go to
[1:17:59] evaluating everything through the filter
[1:18:02] of that best friend so we will evaluate
[1:18:05] people we will evaluate situations we
[1:18:09] will evaluate sermons we will evaluate
[1:18:12] the way the preacher looks at you if he
[1:18:14] says a certain thing and then you will
[1:18:17] evaluate that in your mind now basically
[1:18:19] your best friend is your filter so
[1:18:21] you're pulling the word through that
[1:18:23] filter then you are pulling services and
[1:18:25] texts and emails and phone calls and so
[1:18:28] on and so on so you are hearing that as
[1:18:30] that best friend is interpreting under
[1:18:33] here see he's on that radix eulogy
[1:18:35] notice the way he said that about Judas
[1:18:37] he looked right at you look you know I
[1:18:38] got to look somewhere and I'll say Judas
[1:18:39] unless y'all want me to do this I'm not
[1:18:41] sure how safe that would be I'm afraid
[1:18:43] I'll fall and hurt oneself bad so you
[1:18:45] just got to realize and I'll talk about
[1:18:46] Judas you've got to have enough faith to
[1:18:48] say he told about me
[1:18:49] I'm Judas I don't belong to the Judas
[1:18:52] much I belong to the Jesus much when it
[1:18:54] talks about Farrell why because you've
[1:18:56] got a different interpreter in your
[1:18:59] heart you refuse to allow your best
[1:19:02] friend just said well that was you and
[1:19:04] that was you and that was you and you
[1:19:06] might as well leave you might as well
[1:19:07] get out this message it ain't for you in
[1:19:09] the first place and your best friend is
[1:19:11] trying to lead you to hell are you going
[1:19:14] to let your so-called best friend lead
[1:19:16] you to hell
[1:19:18] oh ma so we'll make your brother branham
[1:19:23] then we will put the filter of our best
[1:19:26] friend
[1:19:26] why our fears our inferiority Tsar
[1:19:29] complexes and we are also complex don't
[1:19:33] show us them one reason why we need to
[1:19:35] change it ain't just to make you young
[1:19:39] let may be open and honest and frank
[1:19:41] with you tonight there probably ain't
[1:19:44] but about maybe a dozen people that I'd
[1:19:51] want to spend eternity with like we
[1:19:55] currently are and I probably wouldn't
[1:20:03] make your dozen less now think of it
[1:20:07] really would you want to spend eternity
[1:20:10] was people the way we are now husbands
[1:20:14] don't don't move don't move husbands you
[1:20:17] wives don't you even flutter my lord
[1:20:23] some of you wouldn't want to spend
[1:20:24] seventy thousand years with your kids
[1:20:26] what's less eternity don't you see we
[1:20:29] all have to be changed our nature's
[1:20:32] already been change what's left the
[1:20:34] human make up with all of our scars and
[1:20:37] all of our hurts and all of our
[1:20:39] peculiarities I read this see last
[1:20:46] weekend but I thought it was so fitting
[1:20:48] I want to read it to you again
[1:20:49] Roy Graham says you just imagine
[1:20:51] somebody hates you once and they don't
[1:20:53] hate you but you imagine they do and you
[1:20:57] just keep thinking they don't like me
[1:21:00] and the first thing you'll be shunning
[1:21:02] that person when they haven't done
[1:21:04] nothing to you after a while it becomes
[1:21:06] so reality to you you'll actually
[1:21:09] believe that person doesn't like you now
[1:21:11] where are you getting this your best
[1:21:15] friend
[1:21:18] right your best friend is telling you
[1:21:22] this and that other person may tell you
[1:21:26] over and over and over again there's
[1:21:29] nothing between me and your brother
[1:21:30] sister I love you with all my heart but
[1:21:32] going to heaven you know we're going to
[1:21:33] shout down the streets of gold one day
[1:21:35] but the best friend will come back say
[1:21:37] huh sure right now you don't believe
[1:21:41] that you know we innovated it's a truce
[1:21:51] Boetticher this is what you need to do
[1:21:56] in my mouth
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:02] if my brother tells me there's nothing
[1:22:06] there I'm gonna believe him over you but
[1:22:12] you see most of us will do that well
[1:22:14] they'll believe our best friend cuz
[1:22:20] after all he's been with me all my life
[1:22:24] he stuck with me through second he's
[1:22:28] been with me when I had no friends he's
[1:22:30] probably one reason you ain't got many
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:22:37] because he's telling you it's everybody
[1:22:39] else he won't be honest and tell you
[1:22:41] part of the problem is yourself
[1:22:42] whichever I'm a preacher Lord put this
[1:22:45] on my heart I'm a priest
[1:22:48] god help us why but we believe it and we
[1:22:53] make it so realest and how brother brems
[1:22:55] brings it you actually believe that that
[1:22:57] person doesn't like you who like you who
[1:23:02] which would wanna who you who you are
[1:23:05] you each one the best friend of course
[1:23:11] the soul ain't gonna believe no lies
[1:23:15] it's born again man and your body
[1:23:20] believes all kinds of stuff that's right
[1:23:24] so I've got to be changed
[1:23:25] now you might ballin out or say
[1:23:28] something telling for instance your wife
[1:23:29] or your husband or some neighbor someone
[1:23:31] that when the person is absolutely
[1:23:33] innocent of any you'll see and it's
[1:23:38] because that oh why do you have to use
[1:23:44] that little three-letter word that's
[1:23:49] your best friend
[1:23:51] you just imagined it so and where is
[1:23:56] your imagination in your spirit till it
[1:24:01] become very hot to you and then your
[1:24:09] best friend says see okay you ever
[1:24:12] invite you for a Big Mac y'all ever go
[1:24:17] to Dunkin Donuts for a cup of coffee
[1:24:20] don't invite me for coffee I don't walk
[1:24:22] off see what am i telling you what am i
[1:24:28] telling you but you see friends it's
[1:24:31] because our closest friend feels no
[1:24:35] threat from most of us he knows we just
[1:24:39] set right now he can lie to us he can
[1:24:42] spin the yarn and we'll set that we'll
[1:24:45] never questioned never asked him for
[1:24:47] proof never asked him for facts it was
[1:24:51] set right there and swallow down
[1:24:57] but I hope after tonight some things
[1:25:00] won't change
[1:25:02] I'm Patrick tonight by at least the time
[1:25:05] I get back from Switzerland that some of
[1:25:08] your old selves is so torn up around 14
[1:25:13] xanax a day now physically now but your
[1:25:17] spiritual self is so nervous that
[1:25:19] yourself is afraid to open its mouth
[1:25:23] because you have set down and had a talk
[1:25:26] with yourself
[1:25:28] y'all ever do that well you need to
[1:25:32] sometimes me and me you sit down and
[1:25:35] have a talk cuz sometimes I get out of
[1:25:39] hand no I don't want to drink I don't
[1:25:40] want to run around I don't want to know
[1:25:41] that cell I just get wore out was
[1:25:43] preaching it wore out was studying and
[1:25:46] wore out you know just Dean with all
[1:25:47] that sort of thing and Donnie says look
[1:25:50] man you're 60 years old how many
[1:25:54] pictures do you know that preach three
[1:25:55] times a week and the message you're too
[1:25:59] old for this brother Graham said he was
[1:26:01] a veteran preacher you know how he was
[1:26:04] when he said that he was 53 I'm 60 so
[1:26:10] I'm older than he was OMA so you say my
[1:26:18] god but you need to set on say listen
[1:26:21] here you need to shut your mouth all
[1:26:25] could preach them and God says for me to
[1:26:27] quit preaching either that or they vote
[1:26:29] me out whichever comes first
[1:26:30] come on children do you ever just a
[1:26:33] dance and look here it's time for me and
[1:26:35] you to have a talk and I'm doing the
[1:26:37] talking and you're doing a listen you
[1:26:41] can speak when I give you permission let
[1:26:44] me start so high and the seed of God my
[1:26:47] name is on the Lamb's Book before the
[1:26:49] foundation of the world I was before you
[1:26:51] was
[1:26:52] and I'm going to lead you to a body
[1:26:55] change so set out and shout out I'm
[1:26:57] fixing to preach you or for our sermon
[1:26:59] I'm a child of God

[1:27:05] Valley I'm a part of the bride of Jesus
[1:27:07] Christ and you're going to follow what
[1:27:09] I'll say and you're gonna like it do you
[1:27:12] understand yes sir yes so whatever you
[1:27:14] say so there you go yeah we're in
[1:27:17] harmony
[1:27:19] [Applause]
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:26] what's this in perfect faith brother
[1:27:30] Aaron said I get spells twos you know I
[1:27:33] get moody I get to a spot what gets me
[1:27:36] is when these spells I get all
[1:27:37] overworked and Satan comes telling me
[1:27:40] listen this nobody cares for you you
[1:27:47] really haven't got a friend in the world
[1:27:56] now if this was not believable for the
[1:27:59] film I would say never told him but
[1:28:04] somehow brother blames feelings or his
[1:28:06] emotions or you're not keeping relate to
[1:28:08] it every time people come to him most of
[1:28:10] the time that's always wanting something
[1:28:12] prayer for their daughter prayer for the
[1:28:14] son they lost her keys and he dis that
[1:28:16] need that you wonder how many people
[1:28:17] just come to him and want it to be his
[1:28:19] friend but try to coughs tell me
[1:28:21] whenever they'd come there and the visit
[1:28:23] said he'd never try to push him never
[1:28:25] try to ask all kinds of questions just
[1:28:27] let him come and just let him run and
[1:28:29] brother Ben would sit down the table and
[1:28:30] draw all kinds of spiritual things but
[1:28:32] they'd never pull on it just let him
[1:28:34] relax and let him rest and let him life
[1:28:37] oh oh wow some of you couldn't handle
[1:28:40] that milk it has to be walking around
[1:28:41] all the time of the pen and paper in his
[1:28:43] hand but he was a human being he needed
[1:28:46] to break away from that yes he did and I
[1:28:49] thank God there was people that was able
[1:28:51] to recognize it or drove him insane but
[1:28:54] you imagine he got to this spot where he
[1:28:56] was so Moody and
[1:28:57] overwork and Satan were telling you
[1:29:01] really ain't got a friend and yet was
[1:29:06] known around the world by millions just
[1:29:10] cause people know your name
[1:29:12] don't mean they're your friend remember
[1:29:20] I'm not immune to that temptation see I
[1:29:22] got over OMA I've got to overcome why
[1:29:28] don't you sing drinking doesn't run
[1:29:30] around with women dissing smoking so
[1:29:31] he's got to overcome that who is it
[1:29:38] William random talkin to brother room
[1:29:41] I've got to overcome that then when I
[1:29:44] look back and see something like this
[1:29:46] now what is relating here to the people
[1:29:47] is that he won one after and seen the
[1:29:49] license plates from the different states
[1:29:50] and all that people had stayed over from
[1:29:52] the morning service to the Sunday night
[1:29:54] service some of them will be driving 6
[1:29:56] hours 8 hours 10 hours and they've you
[1:29:59] know they're going to be senators it
[1:30:00] whenever I see that I get in these moods
[1:30:02] and I get all that nobody really loves
[1:30:04] me nobody cares for me and then it
[1:30:06] amazing church attendance with what
[1:30:10] helping to overcome you don't know what
[1:30:13] it feels like would you spend hours and
[1:30:16] hours and sometimes days preparing a
[1:30:18] meal and half the church don't even show
[1:30:21] up how many times that your sister's put
[1:30:25] up to that and your supper praise the
[1:30:29] Lord
[1:30:29] oh I'm sorry y'all didn't realize then
[1:30:32] huh now this is what was going to over
[1:30:35] help brother branham to overcome listen
[1:30:36] to this and then amazing and I'm gonna
[1:30:38] take that word hallelujah I'm gonna use
[1:30:40] that scripture I'm going to quote that
[1:30:42] word oh no what he's going to do is
[1:30:46] remind Satan I remember a few Sunday
[1:30:48] nights ago when then people stayed over
[1:30:51] and drove six hours and eight hours to
[1:30:54] be in service on Sunday night here you
[1:30:56] go Dell
[1:30:58] you mean he's going to use that to
[1:31:00] combat the devil why preacher and his
[1:31:04] his flock and sheep are so tied
[1:31:06] together all sure friends every times
[1:31:09] you can't be at the house of God but
[1:31:11] when you're more busy vacation and going
[1:31:13] here in their livin you are the house of
[1:31:14] God you don't know how many times your
[1:31:16] pastor and the preachers that preacher
[1:31:18] leaves so down because you decided you
[1:31:22] didn't want to come just stay home and
[1:31:24] stream and one of these days and you
[1:31:27] stand before God you're going to be held
[1:31:28] responsible you're going to be held
[1:31:30] responsible
[1:31:31] oh ma notice is that I look back and see
[1:31:37] something like this notice what he said
[1:31:39] I put it right back in his face and say
[1:31:43] what about that what about that oh ma or
[1:31:49] the devil tells me I'm wasting my time
[1:31:51] and somebody stands up to preach it
[1:31:53] rather well with you oh you think well I
[1:31:55] shouldn't even done and I'm glad you
[1:31:57] done it because I want to take your face

[1:32:03] the devil's face and say see the devil

[1:32:20] complexity of us as human beings
[1:32:24] now what's your trouble you've had an
[1:32:26] accident and that accident you were
[1:32:29] gassed with carbon monoxide gas that's
[1:32:31] true poisoned you poisoned your liver
[1:32:34] and you had trouble with that had
[1:32:35] troubled your stomach the brother says
[1:32:37] right you had trouble in your heart
[1:32:39] right so this is a false prophet it's
[1:32:42] this man's opportunity you're telling me

[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:58] Oh Lord so here we go on the palak wind
[1:40:08] of the king the men of valour are all
[1:40:13] around us they're fighting their own
[1:40:15] battles we've got everything we have
[1:40:19] native and yet we're still raging in our
[1:40:23] minds for some of you it's your past
[1:40:30] some of you have complexes because of
[1:40:33] your looks I understand that I'm not
[1:40:40] saying it to be funny I think I'm just
[1:40:43] about one of the ugliest preachers
[1:40:44] you'll ever see
[1:40:45] I have complexes about the way I preach
[1:40:49] I hate the way I preach hate it with a
[1:40:52] passion I think my style my mannerism
[1:40:58] there's one thing I like about my
[1:41:00] preaching that's when I walk out the
[1:41:02] door all the rest of it you can have it
[1:41:08] and Satan will always be sure to send
[1:41:11] people around you who say you preach
[1:41:14] like a Pentecostal you preach awful you
[1:41:17] preach that you preset why cuz Satan
[1:41:20] knows us and then your best friend is
[1:41:23] taking notes why he wants to talk to you
[1:41:30] later about it
[1:41:33] praise the Lord some of you may have
[1:41:37] complexes because of your financial
[1:41:39] situation or your family some of you
[1:41:43] have complexes because you've been
[1:41:44] married more than once Satan wants try
[1:41:47] to make you feel like a second-class
[1:41:48] citizen all the divorce folks up in
[1:41:51] heaven live over in the debt certain
[1:41:54] side of town and some of you make them
[1:41:58] feel that like shame on you lord have
[1:42:03] mercy
[1:42:03] there's many hundreds of people that
[1:42:05] there are here and many more that's here
[1:42:07] in the service
[1:42:08] it would probably overwhelming if we
[1:42:10] knew the complexes the fears and fiora
[1:42:13] teas I heard it twice this week exit
[1:42:15] from sisters in our church about always
[1:42:20] feeling inferior never really feeling
[1:42:23] loved feeling like they were apart you'd
[1:42:26] be surprised if the people who come up
[1:42:28] here and told me and asked me for prayer
[1:42:30] and say that they have a hard time
[1:42:32] relating to God
[1:42:33] loving them the way I preach it because
[1:42:37] her daddy didn't love him that way or
[1:42:40] the mother and they pulled that through
[1:42:44] themselves and when they hear love
[1:42:46] preached that God loves us so much they
[1:42:49] have a hard time processing it because
[1:42:52] the best friend is constantly telling
[1:42:54] them how long work for you he may love
[1:42:57] somebody I saw that but he don't love
[1:42:59] you doctor why it's the way we're made
[1:43:05] but won't it be wonderful wouldn't it be
[1:43:08] wonderful when the body change sweeps
[1:43:10] over on the earth all over there's all
[1:43:13] around the world some that were raised
[1:43:16] without a father some that were raised
[1:43:18] without a mother in the home some the
[1:43:21] commander divorce families and all just
[1:43:23] horrible horrible situations and still
[1:43:24] pack that in them and all of a sudden
[1:43:28] will be changed back to young men and
[1:43:30] young women and that part of us them
[1:43:33] complexes and all that would totally
[1:43:36] disappear and maybe people in our church
[1:43:39] or people in the message that you love
[1:43:41] them as far as loving them in the Lord
[1:43:43] but you've never really been compatible
[1:43:45] with them or never really been able to
[1:43:48] get close to them because of differences
[1:43:50] in this but if that day you imagine when
[1:43:55] we see him you'll start smiling and
[1:43:58] they'll start smiling and you'll know
[1:44:00] it's over we'll be more barrier of
[1:44:05] language no barrier of nationality or
[1:44:08] peculiarities that we clash Jim some say
[1:44:12] as it doesn't make us weird and
[1:44:14] demon-possessed we create an atmosphere
[1:44:17] by the way we are what we think about it
[1:44:20] what we feed on and sometimes our
[1:44:21] atmospheres clash one with another
[1:44:23] there's preachers of our class with I
[1:44:25] hate to I hate I don't intention Christ
[1:44:28] but just see might you just you just
[1:44:30] can't you know you just can't be chummy
[1:44:33] buddy pally frenzy when Z we gooey stuff
[1:44:37] you love them and they love you and
[1:44:39] they'd come to your rescue and I go to
[1:44:41] theirs myself maybe I'm weird I long for
[1:44:45] the day when you look upon millions and
[1:44:49] millions of people and they'll never be
[1:44:52] nothing there you know oddity no
[1:44:55] peculiarity you know what everyone

[1:46:27] gave it to the people and brother

[1:46:31] gospel to preachers and then the
[1:46:34] preachers turn back and give it to the
[1:46:36] people and then they send another quote
[1:46:39] along with it that when you broke the
[1:46:42] bread and more bread grew back and you
[1:46:43] broke that and more grew back you broke
[1:46:45] that and more grew back brother Brent
