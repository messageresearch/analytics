amen amen we're so so grateful that we can have confidence in this and his promise today greet you today in the name of the lord it's an honor for us to be able to be gathered together here so appreciate all that the Lord is doing um I want to say that we're supposed to get our final inspection on Thursday so we just pray everything goes well let God give us favor and inside of all these people that are coming in and as soon as we can get everything finished up we'll be moving Moving Day I want to say how much I appreciate so many brothers that have come it's just incredible all that they've done sisters haven't come yet because we haven't made it ready to start cleaning but don't worry sisters you're gonna get your time but just so many of what they've done is just overwhelming and I want to say it how much we appreciate it today let's turn to the Book of Proverbs if you would chapter 31. we're returning also Carolyn I'd like to thank you for all the Christmas cards and chocolate and gift cards and chocolate cookies and did I say chocolate I did say chocolate okay thank you thank you that no one sent me broccoli although I did get a t-shirt from someone from Canada that had a picture of a broccoli head on it said Brock Lee l-e-e broccoli so we certainly appreciate all that thank you so much it's kind of you to do so anyone has any extra diet pills left just see me after church Proverbs 31 10. who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband to safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil wow what a woman yeah what a woman this is one thing to me that makes us so profound is we've been looking at is that the Jewish historians rabbis and many different teachers say this proverbs 31 was written about Bathsheba Bathsheba a woman placed in the genealogy of our Lord and yet one that we probably wouldn't think too highly of notice what verse 11 says the heart of her husband does safely trusts in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life I may like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you Licious Bower heads together and hold our requests in our hearts Lord Jesus it's with gratitude and Thanksgiving that we are able to come together again today in this place only been rented for us and only temporarily and hopefully before long we'll be able to have our own place back again but we have been grateful that we've had this place and we're thankful that each and every time you've showed up with us and we're so thankful that you have today Lord we are at the beginning of our new year and we certainly want to look forward to what great things you're going to do for us I hope it's all on my heart this is the year of the going away the year of the rapture if it's not then it will be the year of fighting the year that we will make hell pay it will be the year of us overcoming the year of us standing like we've never stood before so father we approach this new year today with your grace and your mercy we don't come today with a hangover where we'll be drunk last night and drunk the hill you're out and the new one in no doubt a lot of people did they're going to wake up to Dave feeling pretty bad but we've come into the house of God feeling really good amen because the Lord is on our side help us today as we look into your word father help me to get out of the way break the bread of life to us in your manner we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated I'd like to read to you something that brother Anna mentions about David and Bathsheba he said David was worthy of dying he pronounced his own deaths but Nathan said surely you'll not die for he knowed David knew God and knew that he had done wrong he had defiled his brother's wife so it was not Bathsheba that was playing the Harlot was not Bathsheba that was being the temptress but actually King David defiled her in the message of Grace he says God revealed it to the prophet he said David there was a rich man on this side of the road he had a whole lot of sheep very rich and a man lived on this side of the road and he was very poor he only had one land he treated it like a daughter and he fed it out of the same spoon that he himself ate out of he slept with this lamb it was just like a daughter and one day a visitor came so instead of this man taking one of his own sheep and making a feast for the visitor he went and took the poor man's land now listen how brother Branham says this by force he took the lamb and slayed it and made a feast he took it by force and slayed it and made it a feast so again brother Branham is not blaming Bathsheba as being the temptress or the seductress but actually the victim he goes on to say now that was David's Passions now the stranger that came to David's house was his passions or lust and instead of David going listen how he continues this he had 500 wives but when he seen uriah's wife instead of taking one of his 500 wives to appease or satisfy his Passions he went and took this other man's wife then he killed Uriah when she become a mother why oh he said David no notice he didn't know what he was doing he's talking about pronouncing judgment on himself David was ready to pronounce this judgment and that's the way we are we can always judge the other fella but when it comes to us oh it's so different you know when I look at Bathsheba I see a woman that was introduced into the Palace of the king and the Very adverse conditions she was defiled the king forced himself honor she really couldn't have done much by the law of Moses the Torah she was supposed to have at least cried out the Bible doesn't really say if she did or didn't but I can imagine for her there was so much trauma and so much fear and anxiety now remember whenever Matthew and Luke both go to putting together the genealogy of the Lord Jesus and Matthew goes toward the genealogy of of Joseph but Luke goes toward the genealogy of Mary bringing Jesus as being the son of David but we see that these Gentile women which were in the makeup of producing this lineage for the Lord Jesus there was Ruth's and there was Rahab and there was Tamar and Bathsheba and of course the last Being Mary all the other four Were Somehow tainted and one way or another in a bad way and yet the Lord allowed them to make up the coming of the births of the Lord Jesus to me it's more than just the natural genealogy that God wanted us to see but there's something that each of these Gentile women project into the spiritual making of the body of God the female part of God because there is a counterpart in the Old Testament from The Book of Genesis chapter 3 we can see that God began to project a female counterpart into the part of redemption and God even says to the serpent he does not say that man would be the one that would be able to be the Redeemer not Adam but he says that there would be enmity between The Serpent and the woman or why didn't he say the man how come he didn't say now Adam you're the strong one it will be Moses and it will be Zephaniah Zechariah Malachi Abacus how come he didn't say that why did he say a woman because there was a female counterpart in God's attributes that would be used to bring forth Redemption so he says that there will be enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and I know the woman don't even have a seed and he says that he shall bruise your head and you will bruise his heel but you notice he didn't say both of his heels only one so he showed that there would be a battle that would be from that time all the way to the end and we're still ensued in that battle of course to this day but when we look at it God already had this plan of redemption in mind and it involved more than men it involved women whenever I look at Bathsheba I look and see a woman that was as Solomon described her a woman of Great Value a woman that was so after God's Own Heart as her husband but initially we don't find that this love between her and David was quite reciprocating she was not there because she chose to be there she was actually forced by a man that was greater than her a man who had Authority a man well looked at by the well you know sort of people the people no doubt adore David and he was a man after God's Own Heart but not perfect but yet her introduction into the passage of scripture we know nothing about her before this scene well what a time for your life to be introduced into the scope of God's prophetic word and it's your introduced in a passage and a time of life to where your introduction into the Holy scripture is adultery well I say that there's some here today that were introduced into the grace of God at the same time or even worse you know I don't think that we still fully comprehend how much that we are as humans still affects us after the New Birth I'm reminded of what brother round tells us that when you make yourself when you were young and much of what you will become in life is when you are a young child that is showing the positive it is so in the negative and we know the new birth certainly changes our soul and quickens the seed of God that's down inside of us but the new birth does not destroy many of the human attributes in the human nature and you've heard me said over and over again and other brothers as well that we don't need in the body chains to just to go back to being young people but we actually need to be young different people because if I went back to being 18 and you were 18 and you were 18 can you imagine what heaven would be like in about three weeks time if we were all just young again we don't need to just be young we need to be changed because in our human makeup and our mortality we bring to God all of this baggage all of these hurts and complexes and disappointments that we all have and I know sometimes that people think well it's just the poor people and the uneducated and the people that aren't very privileged in life are the ones that have the most of the complexes but it shows me you haven't studied the message very well or you'd find out that your Prophet said one of the two times that he uses the word complexes that he identifies it with the more educated class when he said that people become so educated and they have complexes against one another because of their education so you see it's not the poor it's not the indifferent it's not the weak it's not just those who have complexes but every human being that comes on the earth is subject to fear and Trauma and complexes and scars of life and yet the new birth does not take that all away it's amazing because we see from our own Prophet is we're able to look into his life three months after the seals are open and when he preaches the sermon to us and he opens up himself in a way that he never had done before and that is standing in the Gap June the 28th I think it is 1963 and we see a view into brother branham's use and if you and to brother branham's Journey as he's growing up as a young man then as he comes into the early state of his ministry and he gives us a view inside look of himself and he helps us also to see where he was at that time three months after the seals are open one of the greatest events that had ever happened on the earth and brother random shows us a view about himself that he was fixing to come off the field he was going to basically deceive his wife talk her are into going to the North country and he was going to become a guide and the Lord told him if you get her up there she will leave you and God had to give him a dream that he knew would never happen but he had to scare brother Branham you remember the stories right you remember the tape if you haven't listened to it a while or do you good to listen to it and we see that you're as a man that not only is Born Again of course has the new birth but a man who is the prophet to the Gentiles a man who's been given an honor to be able to talk to the angels of God and see countless numbers of visions and to be the leader of a Revival that would spearhead that Revival and Lead it around the world and still a man that was still left with fears and complexes and things within his human makeup that his prophetic office did not take away the new birth did not take away anybody going to hear me this morning so what I see about Tamar what I see about Rahab what I see about Bathsheba even what I see about Mary and Mary is totally different now the other four were tainted in one way or another and Mary was not tainted in a sexual manner or anything like that but Mary is going to be greatly affected by the reproach that she will bear as an 18 year old girl of being assumed that she is pregnant out of wedlock no doubt it was a great honor and a great glory to the kingdom of God to be able to become this woman that the Bible spoke of but I wonder how much that she boy reproached in herself of being rejected and despised and people whispering about her and saying things about her and yet some of what they said seem to be true some of what they said no doubt they thought was exactly right because she was not married to Joseph yet and she was from this poor town in Nazareth which would be oh my just a terrible place to be from had an awful reputation and we look at it and we see the glory side of Mary being the Virgin but I wonder if we take into consideration The Human Side of Mary being the chosen one and when we look at Bathsheba we see a woman that was pulled away from her husband now it was not that David had fallen in love with her here the prophet picks it up exactly as Nathan did and we looked at it before how that David was given this Parable and Bathsheba was considered to be a you lamb even when the prophet Nathan gave the parable to David he did not project Bathsheba as being Australian lamb that had actually left the flock where she was supposed to be he did not project her as one that was out Meandering around and looking here and there and that is the nature of sheep sometimes sheep will do it sheep that love God and love the Lord and yet they will find themselves going here and going there and getting caught up in this or that or the other even getting caught up behind the wrong leader because it's in them to be led but yet Nathan does not project Bathsheba to be this type of you land but he projects that David was the strong dominant force and David was the one that was moved upon and by what it was his passion it was his lust and instead of David going in the proper way to be able to take care of that David saw her he did not love her he did not fall in love with her this is why that the prophet does the contrast between Uriah and David how that Uriah loved her and and Uriah had brought her up and remember Uriah was older than her and he had some children that was at home and she would had become their stepmother so there's several things about it that the prophet conveys that David did not have at all so David basically lusted after her he wanted her not because he loved her and more than like likely had she not become pregnant the story wouldn't even have went the way that it did but once he found out she was with child now he's forced to do something different and of course he winds up taking your eyes alive and yet here comes this woman now she's going to be brought into the Palace of the king I don't imagine that she just fell in love with David overnight can you imagine falling in love with a man who's murdered your husband and according to the way that Nathan conveys this it was a relationship which was not just one-sided that Nathan loved her but she also loved him so she's taken from her husband she's taken from her step-children and she's placed into a position that she was not even groomed for now she's not a king's daughter she's not a Magistrate's daughter her her grandfather was a hit the fail which was a military man her father was also one of David's chosen 30 men personal bodyguards her husband Uriah was one of those 30 men so she had a military background in her family so they were not necessary politicians they were not men that would know how to pick up a cup and pick how to pick up a spoon and a fork and and how to do all the proper curtsies and so on and so forth but no doubt they were a common type of people a type of people that knew Warfare and new pain a new anxiety and Trauma and stuff like that so she was not reared in a place to wear that she would have felt very comfortable in being right where the King was himself her clothes were would have been taken from her the clothes she would have been comfortable wearing as you know probably not even a middle class type of person her home that she would have been comfortably been raised up in and she was pulled out of that and thrown into a palace the lifestyle she was used to should totally been separated from that lifestyle no doubt she had friends friends of her own category friends of her own class and she was pulled from all of that by whom a man of authority that lusted after her now I do believe as I said to you a couple weeks ago I do believe that God had it in his program that both David and Bathsheba would have come together in time and it could have been possible that Uriah would have been killed in the exact same battle that he died in because if it was his time to go he was going to go anyway is that right but yet he would have not have went by the hand of David and God would have no doubt brung them together maybe it have been more like when Solomon would have been in the Norse country and he saw the shulamite woman and he fell in love with her but Solomon gave her time now you wonder in your mind why did Solomon when he beckoned upon the shulamite and she was a very poor girl but yet a very beautiful girl and when he saw her he did not take her immediately he did not pull her from what was her Norm but he sends people after her and gives her some time wonder why wonder why wonder if it was not from listening to his mother tell him over and over again of the trauma that she had and of the difficulty that she had in making this transition from being just an average person to be coming and some of you wonder why the grace of God is so slow dealing with us sometimes he knows what he's doing some of us may look at other people and say well why don't they do this and why don't they do that look I've learned something I ain't too smart but I've learned if God progresses people in the way he reveals himself to them I'm going to give them how much ever grace they need because God knows exactly what they're what they need and what he's doing and whether or not you understand this statement it is quite a progression to come from being an absolute wretched sinner in the world of darkness and chaos and walking into bright light immediately and making that transition overnight and sometimes it takes an element of time for people to transition and go from their friends to making new friends and going from the vocabulary change and everything about them is entering into a world they've never been before and now what is it about Solomon that he mentions the law of his mother over and over again the term mother mentioned what is it 14 times something like that in the Book of Proverbs now if this woman would have been a woman that would have been you know somebody that would look at a red light woman or something like that would say and she would have constantly been telling Solomon look son I was the wrong one I I addressed in such a way that was indecent and ungodly there's no way in the world this man could have had this love and respect for his mother I mean no even whenever she begins to ask a petition for adonaija that Solomon bounds he gets up and he bows down before his mother and he calls for a throne to be brought in and sat at his own right hand now she was the wife of David but she was the only Queen Mother and the only Queen Mother you'll find in the Old Testament that actually was given a position like she was so Solomon must have really loved and respected and honor his mother but I dare say she was not a woman without her scars I'd say in the in our congregation today of those that are present and those that are hearing the service every man woman boy and girl if you've lived very long in this life you're already bearing scars and bearing things brought on by human beings that are around you I myself a person never been tore up too bad by dogs too many cats never have offended me too many hippopotamuses now granted I've not been around that many but I have been around a few hippopotamuses and a few rhinoceroses and a few elephants and I guarantee you they can do you bad damage but like you most of my hurt has been from humans and the sad part about it is Christians Christian humans I mean it's God I've been hurt by Christians well of course we all have and yet somehow we tend to think well Christians shouldn't hurt one another wow where do you get that at Christians are human beings just like other human beings and people tend to put Christians up on a pedestal and think that Christians are free from hurting you and offending you that is simply not the truth now we do all believe that David King David was the seed of God to be not he was the seed of God he was a man after God's Own Heart done taking his life and proved to you that God used King David even after this terrible mistake as the example of kings and God was still doing for David's sake things to the kingdom of Judah even after David had been dead buried and his bones had gone back to the dust of the earth and God was still quoting for David my servant's sake so David yet was the one who inflicted all the this pain and all this trauma and God even showing David's position that David had made such a terrible mistake that he had cast a stumbling block before the enemy so natural When leaders make a mistake it's going to be more detrimental than it will be just a layperson and probably every one of us here today not only bear the the scars and the things of complexes and Trauma about others but probably if we've lived very long we'd probably call some herself oh my goodness wasn't near as many amens I I I think probably most of us have wound up offending other people now I'm not talking about offending him for the word sake my goodness I've offended all kinds of people for the word sake but I do want to say this morning if I've offended or ever heard anyone in any way or cause anyone a complex in any way me the man Donnie Reagan then I pray you would forgive me anyone around the world anyone in my family anyone that I've ever met because I myself also know that pain and God knows that it would never be my desire to hurt I want to try to help and heal if I can isn't that your desire now how is it then that Bathsheba was able to become from all of this to where she was brought into the kingdom this way and still maintain the ability to be a woman that was so renowned that she would have this influence upon her son now remember whenever we read this that Solomon whenever he wrote about this he said this was to the King Lemuel King Lemuel this was the prophecy which was talked to him by his mother so here she actually Bathsheba is actually allowed to enter in and not just be the wife of a king and the queen mother but she's actually allowed to enter into a prophetic state of the word and when you read these first few words that she said to Solomon and these are words that he pinned down that she said to him she was actually prophesying and warning Solomon ahead of time of what was going to happen to him now remember brother Branham like and Solomon to the first church age which was the Ephesian churches I don't know if you know this or not but there were actually seven ages seven Church ages in the Old Testament so according to the prophet so there were seven churches just in the Old Testament and they began there with Solomon so Solomon was the Ephesian age because it was a new era it was a new time and Solomon was the man that built the house of God but those of you that know your Bible know that the same man that built the house of God some years later he married an Egyptian princess which was the daughter of one of the Pharaohs and then he married another daughter of another king and the daughter of another king and the daughter of another king and of course these were mainly for political Alliance by which he and Israel will be safe instead of trusting in the Lord and whenever he would do that these women were not converts they were not like Roots they were not like Tamar they were not like Bathsheba but they still maintain their ideology and they were Idol worshipers so the same man that built the beautiful house of God wound up building a house for kimas wound up building a temple for the ammonites a house here and there and there and the very same man that built the house of God built these and what was he a type of the New Testament Ephesian Church age that he got away from his first love God loved him so much that he renamed him from the name of Solomon and he called him Jedediah the Beloved of the Lord and Lemuel King Lemuel the beloved one or the one that is loved by God so here he Bears this name and he got away from the first love and his mother inspired by the spirit of God able to move Beyond her fears able to move Beyond feeling uncomfortable in such a place but you know how we are as humans oh my God may be calling us to do a work for him and we really don't like it it don't feel comfortable to us you imagine it was comfortable for brother Branham leaving what he was comfortable with moving to Arizona you imagine it was comfortable for the prophets when they had to walk into the courts of the the king and indict those kings and all of their Courts for the the rebellion and Disobedience imagine it was comfortable you think it was comfortable for the Lord Jesus and they stripped him naked and whipped him and beat him until the strips of mate hanged down from his back no my friend it was not comfortable at all so the Lord truly calls us sometimes out of our comfort zone into doing things for him he will call you to be reproached for his word he will call you to Bear a burden sometime that you wish was not yours so for those who are looking for a Christianity that allows you to remain in your comfort zone well let me just say this to you this morning you're probably in the wrong church here today because we preach the cross and not just the Cross of Christ we preach ours you see nearly every Christian Church preaches the Cross of Christ and they think they'll be saved by preaching his cross but Jesus talked about your cross more than he talked about his own so I don't want to just preach his cross but I'm going to preach about yours and I want to preach about mine and not only do I want to preach about it but I want us to be able to Bear it until one day God will set us free from that cross now remember that Bathsheba bringing all of this baggage if I can say it that way into this position a position she never asked for a position she never wanted and you can imagine now she's married to King David and she doesn't really love him she's still in love with her dead husband so she's trying to be nice to this man because as he brought her in he can also throw her out so how do you fall in love with some man who has killed your husband how do you fall in love with a man who's taken you away from your step children how do you fall in love with a man who's totally removed you from everything that you were used to and everything that was comfortable to you but yet no doubt she felt that it was something that moved within her now unlike David our lord Jesus he did kill our first husband amen he did kill our first chosen when we agreed to let him go and remember your first husband the prophet said was your nature which had the rule over you and by spiritual deaths laying on the altar of God the holy fart of God come down and consumed him and released us from the marriage of that first husband and remember had he done that before you were willing you would have been a captive as well but once he wooed upon your soul and got your soul to agree with his word than you and the old Hallelujah your soul your desire inside of you agreed with God's word and you gave God permission to annihilate that old nature of yours and you were released then from the marriage of that first husband but it's still new to us and the thing of it is many of us have been serving the lord for many many years many of you been serving for 30 40 50 60 years and yet as far as your Humanity you're still dealing with it this morning just like it was the day after you got saved anybody's be honest and say Amen brother Donnie that's the truth now will you say when will I ever get rid of it in the morning of the body change that's when we will all lay aside all the depths of our Humanity well you say why Carol and I was talking another day about this and she said wouldn't it have been wonderful if God would have just took all of our human element away and just done away with it all of us again one sense of the word it would have been but it wouldn't have been his program and we would not have overcome and the greatest thing you know people say if I could get rid of this smoking if I could get rid of this drinking if I could get rid of this or that you said that's my problem no it's not your problem is yourself you are your greatest enemy will anybody say Amen to that again you imagine brother Branham saying his greatest enemy was William Branham how many believes that was the truth well if his greatest sin and he was himself then what do you figure yours in my wife brother Donnie my husband brother Donnie it's you brother Donnie nope all three guesses are wrong it's yourself so the reason today we're not any closer to God is whose fault is it my fault what if it's my fault please forgive me if it's your wife's fault I pray you'd forgive her but if it's your fault you're going to forgive yourself or what are you going to do with yourself or are you going to admit it well I might as well just admit it it's me why is it I don't read the Bible more it's me why don't I listen to tapes more it's me why don't I love more why don't I shut my mouth on Facebook instead of airing out our family's Dirty Laundry well come on church Preach with me now I think folks have gone crazy in the last day they're they're posting things out there you think what in the world is the matter with people they're totally insane well of course I know it's got to come to that way but I want you to see that God when he saves us and he eradicates that nature that we're born with that God does not go into the human makeup and change the human makeup and automatically set the nature of God in the human makeup so in brother random's family run this thing of a temper now when brother Brandon was a little boy and this man had killed his dog you remember the story and brother random got the 22 rifle and he was going to go kill this man well Hallelujah is this right I know a lot of the message people don't like to hear stuff like this but you know what God called me to preach the message all of it not just pet quotes all of it I thank God Brethren said those things it allows us to see a side of him and yet God used him look at David God did not throw David out of the economy of God because of his mistakes so we see this strain that ran in the Branham family while was it it was a temper and he said he's eaten many a meal out of a straw now why because he had a temper and he would come back and fight and say that is that right oh my goodness friends I didn't blaspheme the Holy Ghost I'm just saying what he said that's what you all want me to say and he all want me to say what he said or not well but did that stop God from using the man of course not and do we see that still raising up in him from time to time we do and God looking at this about brother random knowing that he was a man but yet God still had a great great plan for his life and I think that Bathsheba and and what she was able to display in the genealogy being great great great grace so on grandmother of the Lord Jesus that it shows to us that a person can bring all of their baggage as you will and they're able to let God take all that they are and mold them and shape them into something that is far beyond what they thought they could ever be or Bathsheba could have been the type of woman well I don't like King David I don't like this house I don't like this food I don't like this I don't like that no doubt she had a lot of things to dislike about being called in this situation she didn't want to be an adulteress it was not her desire yet she became him and adulteress to the power of an overpowering man a man that projected his will over her and forced her into becoming an adulteress and for many of you that have read the Bible Decades of your life until the last few weeks you have looked down on this woman many of you just like myself have thought very little of this woman and we were accusing a woman that was innocent herself and yet probably some of you saw when I get to heaven and I run into Bathsheba I'm turning going the other way I don't want to shake her hand I don't want nothing to do with her but it wasn't that Bathsheba was wrong it was our sinking that was wrong well that kind of makes me wonder about maybe people we go to church with and people around the message or even sometimes our own family members if we don't get them wrong in our mind and we imagine this and that and the other now don't sit there and look at me like a bunch of sinless saints with no no Faults and no shortcoming y'all are just as low down and rotten and stinking and no good in your flesh as David was and me and anybody else if it wasn't for the grace of God that wouldn't be one of us saved today but thank God for Grace but Bathsheba is her contribution to me and looking at this is what a person can bring into the economy of God not with a perfect scenario and the perfect background and the perfect with everything working together what did I bring to God oh my goodness I brought complexes I brought fears I brought this that the other what did many of you bring many of you brought memories in your mind of being molested or or being defiled as the prophet said that Bathsheba was by King David you brought into it that no trust at all no trust at all for a man there's women in this message that have absolutely no trust whatsoever for any man I'm talking about their husband their father their uncle and they just about don't even trust God because God is a man and what brought that on because of things in their life and maybe instances by which which they were so innocent and I know for some of you this is painful for me to even bring this about Bathsheba and the time of woman she was because some of you did not have such a mother I know that and it hurts me for you to have to bring this to you but the thing I'm saying is this we can take all of these things that we are and we can feel sorry for ourselves and pull ourselves away from their body and away from the economy of God and just be an island and well nobody needs man I don't need nobody I'm not sure exactly where you got that at but your own body testifies that you believe a lie now what if your heart done that your heart decided I'm sick and tired of you kidneys I'm sick and tired of you bladder I'm sick and tired of you this and that and the other I'm walking out of your body today I hope and pray to God it don't cause I'll be burying you on Tuesday well what if your kidneys does the same thing what if your brain does the same thing but God put them there together so say you've got high blood pressure and your heart's good well your heart said this is such a strain on me and your brain says this ain't fair this ain't right it's your kidneys it's calling that blood pressure it's because you're eating too much salt that's what it is and it's this not another and you're making it hard on every one of the rest of us members it ain't my fault the eye would say it ain't my fault the ear would say but you get up with high blood and what do you do when you get up with high blood the tips of your ears which was what I am and you caused me to be red and everybody's looking to me and say want to what's the matter with hell want to watch the matter with her and it's not the tips of your ears fault it's something else's fault well should the ear sink because of that I'm leaving you I'm divorcing you I'll no more be your ear you're not taking care of your blood pressure you're humiliating me you're embarrassing me when you get to your your temper under control and you get this under control let me know and I'll come back and be attached I wonder how many earless people they'd be sending you this morning I wonder how many of us if all of our organs except for our tongue say you constantly are getting me in trouble and the thing that's done it is that big fat long tongue stuck in your mouth and that tongue of yours talks me in and out of one mess and another please brother Dominique well what if every one of your members left and all you had was a tongue or some of you'd probably be happy since you use that remember more than anything else oh my but what do they do each one relies upon the other so you see when God put the Kaleidoscope of the Gentile matriarchs blending together what was it that Ray had to could contribute being Ohana and what could Tamar contribute and what now can Bathsheba contribute to the making together of not only just the Lord Jesus body the first time but also the prophecy of a gentile bride you see when we get there that day I imagine we are going to be so overwhelmed of the people that we know in this life and we get there and they were up and down and had such difficulties in life and the things they went through and you're saying poor saying you know they had this trauma and that trauma I dare say for him if every one of us went to some psychologists and psychiatrists somewhere that have every one of us in therapy tomorrow beginning with me and people think therapy is the answer for everything well I'll tell you what's the answer for everything that is God's word now am I against therapy I'm not against therapy as long as the therapy don't go contrary to the word of God but let me tell you something there is no greater thing that can reach to us than the preaching and the hearing of God's word so it helps us instead of making an excuse for being the way that we are well I'm this way and I was raised this way and I can't help it and a lot of times it becomes one excuse after another I wonder who proverbs 31 would be written about if Bathsheba would have took that attitude to the Palace if she would have come in and said I don't want to be here I don't like David I don't like the meals to eat I don't like the clothes I've got to dress up every day she probably just remember dressing up going to parties and going to this that another now she's got to dress up and she's got to walk around crucified and she's got a curtsy and she's got to do this and that another it changed her it changed her you see this is one thing that God demands of the Bride that the church world will never have to do they can go ahead and dress however they want to they I call they want to they can live any way they want to but not you because you are the bride and you are invited to a powerless life you have to talk the way they do in the palace you have to eat Palace food you have to all glory to God you have to dwell the clothes they wear in the palace we are not like the world we are not of the world we don't talk like them act like them behave like them we are called to powerless life oh so let's read this now again Psalms 31 10 Proverbs rather who can find a virtuous woman her prize is far above rubies and this is Bathsheba verse 11 of the heart of our husband does safely trust in it this could not be said about an adulteress where did Solomon get this input no doubt his mother told him over and over again now son me and your father were not joined right but God in his Mercy called us to himself and God ordains you to be here you see many folks they come to the Lord they're married to three times in the world they're all messed up with this and that and the other and they come to God and they live under that past their whole life and they have this thing within them it's like everybody is looking at them and the truth of it is 85 percent of the church don't even know what they're doing and they don't really care because they've got just as bad a past themselves but where is the problem at it lays within that individual and they think everybody's looking at them they think everybody knows this and that and the other about it's one of the reasons some of you all ain't never shouted is because you're so scared of what people will say [Music] well the reasons some of y'all are so calm and so collective in church and this is some of y'all you're Wild on a buck in the house of God when you go you're beside yourself calm down calm down and what hinders us what people think I hope to God we get to a place before the Rapture when we're not so much concerned about what mother Joneses say I don't care what the Joneses or the Smiths or the balls or the Weber's or the Reagans or the anybody else's say if the Holy Ghost moves on men anoints my feet guess what's going to happen I'm going to dance before the Lord I'm going to clap my hands I'm going to raise my voice why I'm living Palace life and we dance in the palace with the King Hallelujah we eat all Hallelujah we eat what the king sets before us we worship we adore the king I ain't worried about the Joneses I also see in Proverbs 31. not just Bathsheba but the bride of Christ who can find a virtuous woman her price is for above rubies the heart of her husband doth safely Trust in her Jesus Christ had confidence in you by allowing you to live in this age well if you can understand me today his heart does trust in you that shall come through laodicea unscathed will you be hurt will you be let down when you've been disappointed you will but you refuse like Bathsheba to light your past dictate your future you see even the things that happen to brother random as a little boy whenever he was made fun of and ridiculed and his father of course if the moon shines still and by the random scent to get water and what a strange appearance of the Lord to come down and a bush or in the trees rather that time in the trees and he heard the wind and it was the voice of a supernatural being and him on a journey to get water for a moonshine still God can pick some of the strangest places to visit these people can he and yet brother Brown being rejected and brother Branham being laughed at him made fun of and all of that and yet he did not let that control him did it bother him sure it still bothered him as as a man that was now up in his ears in his 50s in 1963 and yet it was something that he dealt with but it never controlled him remember that Sheba was scarred and my goodness the prophet said whenever he got to Heaven he wanted to walk down them streets I read it again last night and take a hold of uriah's hand and shake his head and thank him because he was such a strength to him in this life's journey well I'd say praise the Lord for Uriah and I'm going to walk up and grab a hold of the hand of bathsheb and say God bless you sis I need you to forgive me I preached you as a bad woman I've done this and that in other words you know what I've seen the light God bless you Sister well praise the Lord don't sit there and look at me some of y'all's going to be right behind me it'll be the whole Happy Valley Word of Life we are now it'll be the whole group of a sister by Hashima God bless you forgive me since Sebastian but forgive me God bless you she's going to say what in the world happened to that and the Lord's going to save us that David series done he preached but then we can look at these people and we say how great how wonderful I wonder were they so great I wonder if they were not people just like you know people with failures you imagine the embarrassment and the shame when David would take a hold of her hand and she become his favorite wife grabbing her by the hand and said come and walk with me to the window no David no I feel so ashamed I feel please don't make me do that I can't do it Bathsheba you're my wife but they'll all remember what I was they'll all remember how I became your wife I I I I I I keep doing please David don't you are my wife come with me and stand at the window you imagine as the people but yay David May the King live forever God bless our King and the few said God bless our Queen sorry outfit low down a rotten woman terrified David wouldn't have never done that if she hadn't done what she done um I wonder sometimes in our self-righteousness so we sit around in size people up on what Scholars he's got I wonder what he's got you ever noticed him he's kind of weird she's kind of strange they may think you're weird and then we read in the Bible of these great characters and we just oh my oh when I get to heaven I'm gonna walk up to David I I'm gonna man you wait till I see exit you wait till I see Jehoshaphat you wait till I see do you understand you were going to church with some of the same type if there was a book of Acts written some of the people that you go to church with would be those people's names do you understand some of the preachers that we're privileged to hear and privileged to know are some of the modern day heroes they are the men that are warring against Satan oh my goodness the men of God that have stood for decades and shepherded the flock and saints of God that have prayed in people that have done so much for the economy of God and we're looking way back here for a hero and looking way over here for a hero and sitting right by but our fears and our complexes I know I know I know I know what it's like when a preacher will pick you up at the airport and you get in the car with him to ride and you watch every move his hand makes I know what that's like I know what it's like whenever you pull up to a drive-through or in a restaurant or anywhere else and I see people looking at me for very long and my face goes to getting red I was sitting at a hunting lodge in Illinois a couple years ago the guy at the end of the table he was eating supper they said what do you guys do well they started telling Daniel ball you know I'm in metals and this and that and the other I said what do you do I say I'm a preacher got the end of the table that kept eyeing me said I've seen that guy I've seen that guy on TV brother Daniel started to staring the conversation another way brother Daryl started telling Tales they started going this and that and the other why they could see my my face turning red I could feel my ears a few my ears wanted to leave too you all know what I'm talking about don't y'all maybe not in that way but each of you have your thing so what do I do what's your advice therapist shall I find a cave should I find a hope and stay there till all this passes should you find a hole somewhere or should you go out on the well and say so I didn't hurt my Christians I mind them just trashing the whole thing so you're gonna throw the baby away with some bath water so advise me advise me therapist don't let on lie to me you all don't practice therapy in your home many of you have diagnosed many people some of you probably diagnose me you said well brother Donnie's got this and brother Donnie's got that before I take your diagnosis I want to see your license well this is what I'm going to do and Hope I'm going to carry right on I'm going to keep on preaching I'm going to keep on living for Jesus I'm going to keep on preaching the word of God and saying it for the truth oh brother Donnie when you're going to get past all this when I get a new body Hallelujah when I won't remember none of the stuff that haunts me now when will you do it when you get past your own human mortality don't you understand the body of God is being completed in the New Testament now we are contributing we are contributing to the Gentile body of God Rahab Ruth Bathsheba Tamar they contributed to making the genealogy of Jesus what a woman she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life I love this quote your sisters Look Away to Jesus the prophet says talking about his wife he said she always sent my clothes to the cleaners and washed my shirts had everything ready for me to go into a meeting and then she wonders how she can serve God you women as you serve your husband you serve God wow my brother I've been doing that already I know and you know the sad part about it is you've been waiting to arrive at your place your adoption is a daughter of God when one way one day you're going to do whatever it is you think you're going to do and you've already been doing it some of your brothers are waiting until you'll step out one day and control the elements now here's the ones God wants you to control I've told you enough hunting stories to know that I've tried to control the wind the wind tornadoes and storms and all that now I just head for the truck as fast as I can [Laughter] I figure if I can control this 16 right here I'll be doing pretty good by the grace of God I'll leave the lightning and the Thunder to the Lord let me just bring Donnie subject to the word you know Fran we're looking for some Utopia we're looking for something way out yonder I hope God helps us to see in 23 that it ain't something way out yonder it's right here in front of us right now if you can leave this place today knowing by God's grace I'm gonna bring me under control and I'm going to realize I'm going to serve my husband if I'm married I'm going to live from my family if I'm a father I'm going to be a good Christian I'm going to do what God wants me to do I'm not going to wait till 40 years down the road I'm doing it this morning I'm doing it this morning I'm going to serve God's purpose [Applause] oh no brother man said you women as you serve your husband you serve God and then I come in all tired and wore out people coming from everywhere and I have to go out somewhere on a fishing trip or a hunting trip why many women would have blown up at that what'd she do got in the hunting clothes ready for me to go and let me go and yes sister media was not the one that stood on the platform and discerned and the angel came to I don't mind telling you I long for the day to be able to see her reward she's going to have a great reward God calls Preachers Wives are going to have a great reward oh you see the preacher when he's in Victory she deals with him when he's down in the valley of the shadow of death whenever he feels like nobody loves him and nobody cares for him and you're just so happy and you're rejoicing because you were so hell oh thank God for preacherous wives that stand behind her don't you thank God for your wife Brothers don't you thank God for a good Godly mother you young men and young ladies don't you thank God for a mother that loves you aren't you glad you've got a mother that don't sell your body out to the world aren't she glad your mothers didn't make sex slaves out of you and turn you over to the darkness of this world and you're looking for a woman of proverbs 31 let me tell you something we've got them sitting here today from this side all the way around to this side women of character women of virtue women that are invaluable we've got them all around this world and this message produced says this type of women [Applause] notice verse 13 let me find a pleasure to stop she seeketh War and flax and work us willingly with her hands now what I find amazing is the way that Solomon projects about his mother never remember she's a queen but it ain't like she just sitting around and ding ding ding [Music] could you bring me this could you bring me that could you dress me I read the other day where the king of England ah the King of England couldn't even put his own britches on he couldn't even put toothpaste on his toothbrush and I said well I'm just so glad I ain't royal you imagine you can't even put your socks on you can't even put toothpaste on your toothbrush and that's what it is to be royal brother sister that's what a lot of folks think Christianity is you know the Lord they as soon as they pray God's supposed to answer as soon as they ask why God's supposed to tell them why you're in the wrong loyalty you belong in England in this royalty you're Royal because of the bloodline amen you have to fight your way you've got to press when you don't feel I press it and that's the difference between Earthly royalty and Heavenly royalty you believe him even when he doesn't answer your prayer you call upon his name and it seems like he turns to death here but you serve him anyhow [Applause] oh notice there's not a reluctance there so shishika's wall in flags and workers willingly in her hands so this Priceless woman is a worker well that's sowing or cooking or mending oh Jesus sowing and cooking ugh well she's Faithfully doing her share it's not a matter of compulsion but a matter of compassion going to church today I reckon shoot if I know there's going to be this and I swearing with the Dollywood but I guess I'll go to church you know the deacons all they'll call us if we miss three or four times and then they turn the big dog loose on us and he'll call us he don't want to know who we are well we do that because we love you are you going to live right today I've been thinking about it I'm sleeping on it but the bride says oh Lord what can I do for you today oh Jesus how can I reflect your light in a little greater way I've just found it so amazing that all the different workers that have been over at our place working and you know you run into all kinds of different people they find out that I'm the preacher and then when they wake up from passing out because some preachers do actually work which they just can't hardly believe then that so you you the future you're the master said yep I've had I don't know how many of them to tell me I'm looking for a church I ain't satisfied where I'm going you know does that mean they're all bright no but what it shows me is there's even a hunger among people I hear that's not bride and they don't know where to go so they're looking at this church and looking at that church and looking at another church and yet here we are by the grace of God setting around the truths of the hour and becomes so dilatory sometimes oh my it should not be compulsory that we worship God all right let's have everybody praise God now it should be a compassion inside of our heart it should not be a compulsion that we're going to church that we're going to do right it should be such a desire the prophet said if God is in your heart you can't wait till them doors open to get there it should not be the deacons Society of the pasture is after you it's a compassion for almighty God because you are a woman affect you this woman loves her husband so much she seeks to please him let me just read a couple more verses and we'll pick it up next time she is like the Merchant's ships she brings her food from afar so she acts like a merchant if she buys anything for the household it's like she Imports and she exports so she don't stand around give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me give me but she's willing to put forth an effort she's willing to be like a ship so the bride is like a merchant ship so she brings preachers in from Zimbabwe she brings them in from Virginia she brings them in from here and from there she Imports and she also exports so she don't just calm as something on her mind what can you do for me how can you help me today how can you help me but it's brother what can we do for you what can we do for the body today what can you do for this church what can you contribute she arises while it is yet night and give us meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she consider us a field and bias it with the fruit of her hands she planteth a Vineyard and we're talking about a queen wow God help us how many wants to be a virtuous bride to our lord Jesus the spirits together righteous God so we have our heads bowed to the dust of the Earth from whence we were taken we stand here today flawed like every other human being that's ever lived on the earth except for yourself and Adam before his fall Lord I pray you would help each of us too take the life of this woman it's amazing that you were not ashamed to have the heart at Rahab Linked In Your human genealogy Timar slay with her father-in-law oh God ruse or moabitus Bathsheba on a forced adulteress oh Lord God to be there's such a picture there that you want us to see today we can waste so much of our years of Our Lives saying well if my father hadn't done this to me and if my mother hadn't done that and if I'd been more loved at home and if I'd have been more appreciated and if I hadn't been so hurt by this preacher and if I hadn't been so let down by that preacher and this person we can spend all of our time focusing on that or we can be like Bathsheba we can be a bride type of a woman of great virtue we've all been hurt we've all been disappointed let down in people but Lord God the question is what are we going to do after our disappointment what are we going to do with our lives all we can gather them all together and take all the pieces to this therapist and then that therapist and another therapist and then we find out some of them therapists are having therapy themselves so we think and then we've got people like that trying to advise us are they any better off than we are so Lord we're the only one you know of that don't need no therapy Hallelujah so today we'd like to bring All We Are into your presence oh I wish I could erase memories of my failures I wish I could erase memories of hurts just like some of these people no doubt do and we know many many more that will stream this service as I've already been hearing from them around the world as Carolyn and I said not so many years ago in our study and heard the story of a sister in our assembly what she had went through what she had suffered I was totally overwhelmed Carolyn and I talked about it for days afterwards and we still talk about it even though it's been years ago that we heard the story because the sister was the type of a woman that should never pick it up on her that she'd been through all of this and that and the other it's the type of story that Hollywood would love to make a movie out of was so much danger and so much trauma stuff that was unbelievable and I wept as I heard the story but then I rejoiced as I seen the grace of God and what it had done for that sister that she had not let it dominate her life praise be to God help us Jesus would you come by this way today really I don't think there's a better way for us to begin the new year Lord may you take our hurts and our past Lord and I hear some of our people how they talking they're so down on themselves and so negative about themself it's evident it's evident they've been fed that maybe since a child maybe parents that didn't love them parents that rejected them whatever more and their evaluation of themself is so low [Music] Lord God I pray you would help each of us today oh we're not preaching arrogance and nothing that we can be proud of in ourself but help us to realize we have another life other than what our father gave us we have another life other than what our mother printed Upon Us Lord God it's your life Lord Jesus oh I have Bathsheba would have come in the economy of God and her husband would have died and her and David would have met at some great Kings banquet he would have politely asked her to dance with him and she would have listened to him sing a song and they would have carried on a romance of a year or so everything would have been all up front my how loving they'd had a big royal wedding she would have been able to walk into the palace and hold her head up high but instead it was shadowy it was sinful it must have took Grace every time she stepped up there to hold her head up and know that God had forgiven her husband Hallelujah unlike her today Lord God we don't need for our husband to be forgiven it's simply us oh Jesus we worship you this morning Father we bring our baggage we bring all that we are her hurts her pains our scars Lord God we bring them before you today Jesus do we have regrets so many many but Lord we don't want our regrets to dictate the type of life we're going to live neither do we want our our past to dictate it but may we be like Bathsheba that we refuse to let our past dictate our future and also our present although maybe there's some here today who need forgiveness for something they've done something they've participated in that was not pleasing to you may this spirit of God wrap them in your arms today Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh Lord God we know many times it's much easier to accept your forgiveness than it is for us to forgive ourselves but Lord God it's time that we arise as the people of God this is our time Hallelujah we are the actors on the scene as it were I don't believe there is another generation I believe with all of my heart no doubt Moses and Elijah are on the Earth today no doubt the Antichrist the false prophet the Beast that power is already here and Lord we're the last ones oh Jesus May our history Fade Out like Bathsheba now we jump ahead a few years King David is laying on his bed his oldest son Idol Niger has now said that he's King the prophet comes to who Bathsheba the prophet comes to Bathsheba and tells Bathsheba go to David Hallelujah so now here is this Outcast of a woman [Music] what is she her words are linked glory to God to the reign of King Solomon and Bathsheba walks into Kings David rule did not you my Lord say that my son would be yes yes I said that well even now I don't know is saying that he's going to be the king immediately Nathan the prophet comes in and says the same thing so the bride and the prophet was saying the same thing and what was it about the coming Kingdom Hallelujah Hallelujah the prophet comes in and David is so moved it's the last thing that he does on his deathbed Hallelujah at the bidding of who his Queen Bathsheba Queen who found honor who'd found respect Who Am I who am I who should I go in there but somehow it had come to her she was God's chosen one in her words lay the power of life and David called for Solomon and said by my decree Solomon is King of Israel oh Lord Jesus help us as your people we believe our weddings suffer that we will go away in that three and a half years we will rise from that supper and we will come back in the battle of Armageddon and then what's going to happen our presence with you at that battle declares it's time for the son of David to reign praise the Lord praise the Lord you don't bring Angels you don't blame cherubims you don't bring seraphims but who do you bring your wife and your wife will Crown you King of Kings and Lord of lords as it was bathsheb according to the Song of Solomon it was Bathsheba who made the crown and put on Solomon's head Hallelujah you're crowned by his mother oh Jesus may we lay our faults our failures our mistakes Lord God not only that but may we lay our judgmental spirits of one another oh how many times have we misjudged your people how many times have we misjudged David misjudged Bathsheba misjudge this and that and the other forgive us Lord may we render proper judgment Lord God I pray oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord God we worship you Jesus can we just raise our hands to to his great name this morning friends not out of compulsory that you're compulsed it well brother Donnie wants me to do it no but out of compassion and love in your heart for the Lord Jesus oh sure he was a liar he was a drunk he was a heartache you was whatever more but you've been called into the court of the king Hallelujah and he identifies you in his victory praise God we are the proof that Calvary was a success thank you Lord Jesus remember Solomon was the very one who wrote and said that this type of a woman is a crown to her husband the bride is the crown to our Lord Jesus Christ oh blessed God you say brother Donnie or crown yeah I swear to rubies come from out of the Earth where do me these great Treasures come from out of the earth and you've got to dig around all the dirt and all the trash and all the scrap and then you take it and let someone cut it and
