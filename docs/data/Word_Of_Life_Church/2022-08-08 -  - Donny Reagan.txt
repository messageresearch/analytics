gonna live what we're here what we're hearing open up the [Music] pages and i hear the preacher preach the sermon i want to become what i've heard in front of me i see christ living image that's what i'm walking towards your desire [Applause] for my life is to have the life of christ live in me not my life and yours but yours and yours alone father let your kingdom [Music] lord you're calling me

be done [Music] [Applause] beautiful i don't remember hearing that before did y'all hear that before i must not have been here when he sung it amen don't you appreciate when the lord gives words and they inspire and they carry a message hallelujah let's turn today to the book of philippians chapter four if you would philippians chapter 4 verse 4. i want to speak to you today on the power of thought the power of thought rejoice in the lord whenever you're feeling good when all things are going well now how many of us do this so we all need help from the first portion of this verse wow if i didn't know better i'd think this place was a hospital for sick folks and folks that are crippled and folks that needs all kinds of help but there's one thing i know about this place it's not an old folks retirement home okay i'm not preaching you all a message for a retirement center we're to get out of this place rejoice in the lord alway and again i say if once wasn't enough he's going to come back and burn us again again i say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds notice now the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep and the word your keep means protect by a military guard to keep with a garrison [Music] so the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep was a military guard or with a garrison your hearts and minds now let me ask you something if we didn't need a garrison why would he send one if all you needed was one guy marching out over the gun back and forth in front of your heart in front of your mind while waste all the rest of the soldiers but if god sent me a garrison for my heart and my mind i guarantee you i need it the peace of god that passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through jesus christ finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things let's pray together truly lord jesus we are just blessed to be able to read this word and know it's the truth but somehow father i want to be further blessed i know that it's truth and i believe it's true but i want to have it i want to have it in its fullness i want it to be living in me in a more persuasive way that i can be able to convince others by its positive effect on my life that they too will want it as their own lord may you take your word today and speak to us we stand here as a people with many needs in our lives and many desires i pray that you would help us today that we can find ourselves in the pages of the word of god that no matter what we're facing and what we're dealing with we can have confidence in you to know that you are mindful of us today speak to us heavenly father we ask in jesus name and the saint said god bless you may be seated today friends as we started out the service last night the one thought that i would like to remind you of today is that there are two great forces in the world that we live and both of them are endeavoring to control our mind even though our soul would be sealed by the holy ghost for those who are truly born again and your soul would belong to god sealed into the day of your redemption satan can never get it he can never even touch it he can never even affect it from that day on but he is sensible enough and he knows his position well enough to know that even though your soul would be sealed your mind isn't so your mind is still a very great part of you which is accessible by satan so evil thoughts demons all kinds of wrongdoing can be able to penetrate your mind so when you look at that then it makes it so much easier to understand why that every day of our life absolutely every day of our life that we're under a constant onslaught to be able to control our minds so it's in the books that we read it's in the social media it's on your phone it's in movies it's in the music that you listen to it's everywhere we go now to many people it's in a subliminal way that satan is trying to affect them they don't even they don't even know they don't understand that when they go to an auto parts store to walmart wherever it is and the rock and roll is going in the background they have no idea that that is reaching out to prepare them for armageddon now you and i do the reason we know that is because we have influence from a superior mind who has led us in on this secret now if it was not for that we wouldn't know it either we'd be sitting there singing them songs and thinking wow this summer i remember not too many years ago when i came to this church it was eat up with rock and roll and country music and many of you folks listen to it in your car and listen to it and you're home and yet coming right here to church and feeling like you was all right with god you know what happened you needed your mind changed you needed something to be able to intervene and help you to see you can't listen to that and be in harmony with god of where you need to be at the same time you can't it's impossible but satan knows that the mind even though the mind has been funneled in a direction by which the spirit of god can now deal with that mind and keep in mind when we're talking about the mind of christ in the mind of a human being that the mind of christ really all it is is the supernatural helmet comes into you by the new birth which gives you the ability and the potential to receive from god the fullness of his word then your left was a human mind it's not actually your brain but it's an ability to be able to understand and it's it's part of the intellect it's part of the spirit culminated together in order to make you a complete human being but we know we do not actually sink with our brain we sync with our spirit so a person could be out of their mind and be nothing wrong with their brain they could be out of their mind and yet they could do a brain scan they could do all kinds of things in the brain and the doctor said we can't find us wrong why because their spirit is roaming so it's more than their brain your mind is more than your brain it's something that you get from your makeup now once we become converted then there's an element of us that is still left the unconverted part the unregenerate part that is the part that satan still has a claim on it is there that he sows the enmity that he started out in genesis 3. the enmity that was sown in the beginning started out in a seed form in a man for cain was a man but as the enmity grown and progressed down through the ages it is not that we would look around today and try to find a natural literal serpent seed that it would be a certain race of people on a certain continent and there they would still be it's not that way today but we know that the enmity has grown from a particular seed or a particular race until now all human beings are plagued with this enmity and the enmity is a carnal mind now the enmity as paul calls about in the book of romans that to be carnal minded is enmity against god so here's the very thing that started out in the book of genesis in seed form but now it's not in a race in a certain color of people but it's in every human being so whether you're black white red yellow african indonesian whatever you are every person now is contaminated with this enmity which is in their mind even after you're born again the spirit of god does not eliminate the enmity which is still left in the human being so it sets to two seed lions both cain and abel are warring or struggling within you and i every day it's jacob it's esau it's the whole thing again so in that then we have the ability by the new birth to be able to perceive to understand to receive divine projections from god which gives us the ability to know that he's real and to be able to look beyond our senses and believe something that science cannot declare i read an article this week where three-fifths of the scientists around the world do not believe there is a god they believe that science at the progression of sciences go on all their scientific proofs and this and the other proves without a shadow of a doubt there is no god and it's mere foolishness to believe in deity well i turn that right back around when i read it and i said ever want to use fools because the fool has said in his heart there is no god but my faith will declare what their test tube won't declare if you can just look at nature i don't know how in the world you can't believe that there's a god if you just look at how it all correlates and how it all works together and then believe that somewhere out of a big bang it just happened oh no it wasn't a big bang yes my father had a bang that's what it was he had a bang out of doing all this yes sir you imagine now here we look at it then no wonder they'll never be able to understand because a carnal mind is enmity against god the more educated the carnal mind gets the farther away it gets from god i always knew there's a blessing of being a dummy you know you understand that even that in the sense of the word the more theology you know the more intellect you know the more religious you know sometimes how hard it is to simply believe god because satan will take all you know about the word and he'll wear you out with it that's exactly right so in that there is a great power just in the power of thought without being a christian just being a human being there is a great power that can be released in the power of thought now of course that power was given to us as we even though we fell from the projected image of the mind of god still we maintained an element of that imagery of god even after the fall was there this is why brother ben said a man could take and concentrate on a glass and concentrate hard enough and long enough and actually cause that that glass to explode so it would be the power of the mind and the power of concentration but in that it also works in a religious way that the power of the mind can be able to endue you with great wonderful things or the power of your own mind has the ability to deceive you into a state that you are totally convinced you are right with god and your mind is the one who has deceived you not the devil but your own mind itself now let's read a few scriptures if you don't mind in matthew chapter 24 verse 44 what's jesus he says therefore be also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh now look at the power of saul here there will be many many people in the last day who are not thinking in the cycle of the coming of the lord now because they're not thinking in that cycle their thought process will delay their preparation for the rapture now notice how he links their thinking to the readiness of the coming of the lord you see if satan can be able to convince you well it's not in your lifetime people have said this for thousands of years you'll probably live to be an old man it'll never be in your generation well what is that the power of saul so depending on how you relate to the coming of the lord will relate in your life in your readiness for that coming so if you think well it's probably not going to be in five years or six months or maybe it may not even be in 10 years or 20 years or 100 years so through the power of that thought it will put you into a law it will actually put you in a spiritual paralysis that you're saying well probably not in my generation what are you doing you are subjecting then your life your behavior your conduct your character to the power of a thought so jesus notice how it says that therefore be you also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man coming so those who are not thinking in the cycle of the coming of the lord they cannot be ready so we are prepared by the right thoughts or we are delayed preparation by the wrong thoughts amen very simple isn't it yet powerful saint john chapter 5 verse 39 search the scriptures for in them ye think you have eternal life and there they would testify of me now jesus was being questioned now by the religious people of that day and he told them that you better search the scriptures for ye think that in the volume of the scriptures it's where you have eternal life and yet the scriptures is what's testifying of me so you think that by your stand in the word that you have eternal life and yet you're denying the very word made flesh in your day you better rethink your position but now they were thinking because they were jews they were pharisees they were sadducees whatever more so the power of thought had so pulled them into this great thing they just because they were in the messages would say just because they followed the prophet of god moses just because they'd been circumcised they kept all the feasts and all the orders and this and that and the other and in the power of thought they thought they were ready but they were not and yet the power have thought i deceived them oh my saint john 16 2 they shall put you out of the synagogue yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he does god service so where do they get this thought that they would actually kill people and they did many many thousands and thousands millions of them down to the ages that they killed the people of god and they thought they were actually doing god a service look at the power of thought so then all that's necessary is for a strong one to be able to project a thought into those who are of weaker perception people always look for a leader now whenever the stronger one is able to project to them a certain thought whether it's true or not it doesn't really matter as long as they believe it's true and then they project that thought to them of such magnetism and such an ability that those hear that thought and then they take that thought and they actually become that thought and they acted out into action then they would be able to kill people and actually think god wants me to do this you imagine in the inquisitions down through time whether it was the catholic church whether it's in the spanish inquisition of all the inquisitions that have been of the people of god they actually thought they were doing god of service by heating up pokers of hot iron and poking in the eyes of our brothers and sisters until they burn them out they would take and strip the flesh off of their bodies they gave them no anesthesia they would take hot arms they would punish them in every way possible and no doubt they would get done from their day's work with the smell of burning flesh all over them the saints of god blood splattered all over them and they would walk out from them and think i've done a glory unto god today because they thought thoughts are powerful aren't they romans chapter 12 verse 1 paul says i beseech you brethren therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your what's the mind that's to do have been transformed so you mean actually my stage of transformation will bring the mind into play as well you mean even though my soul has been changed my mind must fall asleep in order to be completely transformed that's what the bible says that you may prove what is a good and acceptable and perfect will of god for notices for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly soberly which is to exercise self-control why why should not i as a minister or you as an individual think more highly of yourself than what has been divinely allocated to me by the presence of god what harm can that do it can destroy me it can destroy you now for you to look at yourself and think of yourself above the divine measure that god has given to you will lead to your utter destruction oh my you folks have cried on me today the power of thought not nobody else thinks that maybe nobody else in your family nobody in the church that's not what it takes all it takes is you to think that of yourself i'm more spiritual i'm this i'm that i'm that i'm that i'm that and when you doing that you're going down a road of self-annihilation through the power of what thought notice this he says every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith again he says in first corinthians 4 6 and these things brethren i have been a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think now he brings it over on the people not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another so now it comes from the individual that the ministry now is referring to that the people should not puff up the ministry one above another the power of salt galatians chapter 6 verse 3 for if a man think himself to be something now look at the power of thought a man can actually begin to think about himself to such a degree that he transcends in his mind what he is in fact and reality and moves into a world that does not exist so a man begins to think himself notice how paul said you talk about powerful words friend a man begins to think himself he actually projects himself into this non-existent world by his own mind by the power of thought it'd probably scare us to death if we knew how many folks in the message are right here in this verse of scripture they think they are so spiritual they think they're so elevated they think this and that and the other about themselves and they think themselves nothing something when in reality they are nothing and how do they do it through the power of thought and they'll send writing her sermon like today trying to bring them down to that spot it'll go in this ear and out the other or vice versa they'll get up and walk out because they have transcend themself they have transcended fact they have transcended reality that they have created by the power of thought a world which is non-existent and they live in that world by themselves no one else is there with them because no one else has that view of them but they do [Applause] i kind of had a feeling this morning when the lord give me this y'all to be looking at me this way today i don't thought i knew which way i was going to go today but the lord wouldn't let me sleep very good last night so about 3 30 this morning something like that this stuff kind of started coming together whenever i finally got up i started putting it all down and i don't mind telling you i was absolutely overwhelmed and i began to see it i hope it overwhelmed you with me for if a man think himself to be something when he is [Music] and the word nothing is no more than anyone else now we know all the redeemed or something so paul didn't tell me that you're not redeemed that you're not but whenever you say you're above others of the same class i mean is there elite bride above regular bride or is there low bride middle bride and upper bride or or is it just bride [Applause] now watch how powerful that thought can be if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he not the devil not demons not fallen angels he deceive us himself now it's amazing the word that paul uses here for deceiveth it is deceived one's minds the idea of subjecting fanciful dreams it's something that does not exist but the man when he subjects himself and he believes he projects himself into this non-existent world and he moves into that wow the power of fault what if negative thoughts and wrong thoughts can do that what can good thoughts do oh glory now let's watch this in law in chicago 1955. i know you're familiar with it but let's read it again today now it's a strange thing that is so much thought of people say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're talking his language right then oh i thought the devil cursed the devil on cuss he ain't that low down he'll get you to sell them filthy words but he won't say it some of the devil's favorite words are scriptures that's first on his priority seconds quotes at least he's got enough sense to know which one fits where rory oh he don't say all these foul mouths bad words he uses god's words because he wants to be like god god don't curse so when people say i'm not a very good christian i'm weak i'm this that's what the devil wants you to say listen to this you mustn't never never say that how many of us say it rescue hours i'm going to cast that devil out of you right now why what difference does it make if i say i'm not a good christian when in reality i'm living a life by the word what difference is amazing i've i've never done nothing for god i'm never accumulating on this and that i ain't no good i'm but god probably don't even know me when my own life says the exact opposite notice this you mustn't never say that amen don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time now if a man through the power of thought can project his image into a world that is non-existent only in his mind that he's above other folks at happy valley or superior to folks in the message he has a special eliteness about him more gifted more talented whatever more and a man to the power of assault is able to project himself into that realm and he will actually live in that world he will have that all about him he'll have that mannerism about it because he actually believes this about himself if he can do that what about the mouse of a christian a born-again christian who has power in their words i love the way it says this let don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time it's going to tell you how to make a positive testimony i'm saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all of my heart do you believe in divine healing with all of my heart oh my let your testimony always and your thoughts everything now listen never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it now there's times you can help it in times that you can but even if you can't help it and you don't catch him on round one catch him on round two now notice never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it when it starts it don't entertain it now this is where we get in trouble a lot of times satan has access to your mind and put all these things in there because of the power of suggestion through the power of thought and then we take it in and we entertain that thought y'all know what entertainment is don't you so you're going to have some folks over at your house this evening and say well we're going to have a few folks for fellowship sister i'll fix a little you know little something other heat and some drinks and whatever more you come in you all sit down you go to talk and eat a little bit you don't share things together you're entertaining them satan brings them bad thoughts our evil thoughts you're not a christian like this how the other go ahead and take a chair have fellowship with me you ain't no good i know it did you ever notice you got a j in your name that could be judas [Laughter] but if you're fellowshipping with jesus you'll say no it ain't judas it's j for jesus you got a d in your name that could be devil but if you're fellowshipping with jesus he said no don't stand for devil it stands for deity but you'll entertain and entertain and entertain and by the time that thought gets done so i enjoyed our fellowship see you next time that thought gets his coat on walks up goes outside and you're about ready to get your gun blow your brains out why you entertained that deceiving down oh my that spirit and it got all over you [Applause] and what did he do it projected you into a non-existent world now you are a christian a child of god filled with the holy ghost and loves the lord with all of your heart but you are living in a non-existent world of your thoughts that now you're separated from god now you're not going to heaven you're not brides you don't love the lord at all and god says that's a lie that's not where you're living west that's not where you're living look at my grace look at my grace on your life that should tell you where you are and if you're not careful you'll talk yourself right out of fellowship with god oh my notice this never permit a negative thought to come into your mind if you can help it when it starts don't entertain it well you say i can't help the thoughts from coming well i love these theological terms that brother branham uses when most of us theologians can so relate to it it'll be like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but it sure stopped them from roosting now he said that's a good thing you see you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't don't don't entertain them just pass it on glory to god so in dad's house come say hey i heard this having a few folks over and i slammed the door in his face you're not invited you go back at you in your car and go straight back to hell and tell the devil i ain't signing for no rattlesnakes today i thought just having our fellowship we are with whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are loving whatsoever things are the good report whatsoever things of virtue and praise that's what we're fellowshipping around all glory to god [Applause] praise the lord oh my no sir notice this jesus christ is my savior all things are mine by god i'm going to keep them i'm going to testify god can only bless you as you confess he's done it for you so if he confesses in heaven you're saved you're confessing on earth you're lost you stop the confession right there he confesses i loved you before the world began and you say i'm not sure that stops the confession right there he says by my stripes your heel he said i don't know that stops the confession right there lord jesus help us notice god can only bless you as you confess that he's done it for you see he's a high priest of our confession is that right hebrews 3 he said that he's a high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it i love this combined barnabas when you begin thinking about divine healing and you get to thinking about christ keep them on your mind if there'll be any praise there'll be any virtue the bible says think on these things if any thought comes by well maybe it couldn't be so get it off of your mind right quick think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through don't let it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your thoughts positive calling jesus [Applause] don't think sitting there in a wheelchair that you're hopeless and helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind that's right but you don't have to let it stop the old farmer story again like the old farmer said i can't keep the bears from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun there are certain times a rifle is more fitting there are certain times a single barrel is more fitting or an over and under but in this case you want a double barrel whoa here it is it's the 66 side by side [Applause] 66 books full of divine promises for the children of god oh glory said don't let them loose my mouth let them pass right on truth here's the shotgun to use both new and old testament it's a double barrel [Applause] so when the devil comes to you set out your own peril big boy cause i'm loaded and i'm ready i've got 66 barrels my goodness what a shotgun you know why the devil ain't scared of most of us we use peace shooters and the devil's overholding his son oh that's that's the one thing i love about the message people they're dumber than colbert man they're so convinced they're so relevant you know revel in all they know so much about god and fight with peashooters you imagine how the devil feels when a saint of god goes over to his gun safe satan says oh no right run for your life i've dealt with this guy he knows how to use this thing [Applause] oh glory to god notice this here's the shotgun to use both new and old testament a double barrel a very good one too i'll tell you it keeps them all away so you know what let's just lets me know friends you and i are using our shotgun we let these thoughts dominate our minds pull us into a non-existent world through the power of thought and we've got everything we need to blow them to smithereens well let's now them stop them from coming back they'll be right back after you get done blowing it out but don't worry you got plenty of ammunition notice this on this report he said you know when you think about god when you keep your mind you sit in church and you think about everything else but god um how you're going to do your washing what you're going to do at the office tomorrow how are you going to do this that the other keep your mind off of that and think on god you don't have to raise your hands we're all guilty i wonder how many of you have thought about washing sisters bacon fixing a tractor brothers going out to here and there and there after church i've been guilty not working on a tractor but working on something else best if it's a preacher that's born you to death or putting you to sleep or it's a long-winded i'm wore out i got to think about fixing something to stay awake just being honest just being honest how many times has our minds roam here and there and there and that's not something the holy ghost will do that's something we have to discipline ourselves and get out that shotgun nobody's even knowing what's going on because you're going oh god he's clearing suicide incoming suicide i'm blowing them birds out of my brain i'm blowing them all salts out of my head so i can receive the word but if we sat down we think about this i wonder how many of you have really settled a lot of problems when you're sitting in church some of your brothers probably fixed several lawn mowers chainsaws all kinds of things while you're sitting here in church you know why why satan knows here's the battlefield the power of thought oh can you imagine when god when god takes his word and makes it so real and satan says oh no if they see that they'll be transformed they'll be powerhouses so you don't say a word let you go ahead and come to church you come in singing everything goes you sit down preacher starts the thought comes through you're just sitting there looking at me and saying i wonder what he's going to preach today i announced my thought wow interesting my goodness all of a sudden here it comes you didn't turn off your curling iron [Music] or you begin to think the coffee pot and you slip your husband a note trying to hide it so the dickens won't see you did you turn off the coffee pot and he took turn around and looked at you with that deer in the headlight look now we're all laughing do you understand how serious this is though you understand what's going on this is war fast and you'll be a good disciplined christian if you can sit there the rest of that service and get something out of it without thinking your house is burning down because you're saying oh my goodness the curtain are in the coffee pot did you feed the dogs that you left the hat the cat out i mean all these things and you say why does that have to happen and you get home and guess what you find out that steak and curling horn was unplugged and all that worry and all that threat no the coffee pot but why the power of thought captured you through the entire service and whenever i do this you're going out that door so we ain't going to eat i'm going to check my hair rollers because the power of thought subjected you and brought you into a world that was non-existent and you can imagine your house burnt to ashes when you get home and there it's standing then you get mad on a hornet you think you rotten devils don't you know if we would calm ourselves the spirit of god could say don't worry you unplugged it [Applause] if you can put a pocket knife in a prophet's pocket he can tell you the curtain aren't unplugged but we have more confidence in the negative part than we do the positive because we're so elevated by the power of fault and there we get caught in a non-existent world it's not even real but it's real to you wow the power of salt oh my now let's look if you would in philippians chapter 4 verse 8. we looked at this last night but today i'd like to give you meanings of all these words hopefully it won't bore you and put you to sleep finally brethren whatsoever sings are true loving the truth speaking the truth truthful whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest august venerable reverend to be venerated for character honorable of persons and of deeds now this is what i'm supposed to think on and you're supposed to think on instead of garbage gossip junk trash i know some of you sitting around and you're thinking this is totally impossible it's not impossible or god would have never had it written his word we can attain to it but the question is do we want to or not or better be a battle shall be a battle but it'll be worth the victory and can you imagine every day of our life we're constantly under an onslaught there's not one given day friend in my life that i'm not under an onslaught of people dying with diabetes or dying with cancer or dying my doctor look my burden is more than just you at the church i get emails and things from folks around the world around the world daily daily and if i did not find a place somehow a shabbat a world to move into by the power of thought i would be so overwhelmed i would know what to do because there's so much sickness and trouble now if you're a preacher and you don't care for people ain't gonna bother you no way but if you love god's people and you care for and you see this and that and the other and heartaches and divorce and little babies and so on and so on and so on every day of your life but there has to be a way by the gem that this word still works in laodicea do we believe this word works today or was it just good for paul finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just righteous righteous judgment upright virtuous innocent faultless guilt notice guiltless but yet if we're not careful day to day our activities will be filled with have you heard this have you heard that so-and-so is doing this and so-and-so has done that have you read the latest on facebook i'm more concerned about name book oh brother is that a new website no it's actually been around for a long time i'm trying to find my name in this book people fill their minds with all this stuff all this nonsense when the bible tells us to think on the things that are pure and holy and righteous free from fault but you understand you know people as well as i do some folks cannot live in a stream of purity because they're not pure themselves they're like a maggot you ever seen a maggot on a fresh cut steak i'm gonna try my best not to ruin your dinner but a maggot does not like prime sirloin prime rib big old piece of fresh salmon or fresh tilapia maggot likes it when it's rotten and he wiggles in and out when all the juices is running out when it smells so bad you can't even hardly get near it but that maggot says this is home i love this [Music] friends i don't want to be rude but i'm afraid we've got a lot of maggot christians [Music] they wiggle in and out of one mess and another and over a dead crump of meat over here and something's stinking and rotten over there they cannot live in a pure stream to live in this scripture that's not even their nature in the first place to think holy to think righteous why it's not in them i don't think there's a child of god sitting here today that would not desire this more than anything in your life to live every day of your life with all that you deal with but at the end of the day it's consummated by these things flowing through you oh notice paul when he says this about jess let me read this other part of the meaning of this word righteous righteous judgment upright virtuous innocent faultless guiltless used of him whose way of thinking feeling and acting is wholly conformed to the will of god finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure you ever heard of me pure gossip what about pure negativity where people are not ready gospel and they just have nothing positive to say well lord i i missed you i thought that's what you want me to preach today they're all looking at me like i should have preached something else [Applause] look at this whatsoever things are pure chaste clear free of maggot juice i love this next one exciting reverence wow what a word exciting reverend say no but you're reverent but you're so excited about it you're about to tire the bench down but you're afraid you'll miss something so it's excited reverence lord and mercy what kind of christians would we be on this hill if every one of you made up your mind after this day by god's grace i'm going to attain to that verse of scripture in the bible glory to god exciting reverence venerable sacred pure from carnality modest immaculate whoa is that what happened to jesus the immaculate conception immaculate clean so could you be pure and be mad at the same time could you be spouting off with the mouth man i mean got a temper mean enough to fight a bus on say i'm so pure y'all don't know it but i'm preaching rapture and faith this [Applause] morning all right speaking especially instead of every time you come around you're known by your words you're always negative you never have nothing good to say about god or nobody else that's not a good report christian [Applause] amen if there be any virtue praise a virtuous course of notice how many of these meanings are bringing in thought and thinking a virtuous course of thought so if you and i think like this and we would live under the influence of the power of these thoughts you know what's going to happen this is going to pour out of you onto other people oh glory is there anybody here wants this besides me good praise a virtuous course of thought feeling an action moral goodness any particular moral excellence as modesty purity so if there be any virtue if there be any praise oh which is approbation commendation to praise one you know what we're so easy to criticize we're so easy to nitpick you husbands pick on your wives wives pick on your husbands parents pick on your kids tell them all the time of all they do this wrong do you ever praise them children what about you husbands do you praise your wife your wives do you praise your husband well i don't see nothing in him to praise him for is it has he got a girlfriend other than you see work all week go out and spend the money on the weekend on whiskey you can't find us in the praise of your mouth see me after church i'll give you a few pages your brothers ain't got nothing to praise your wife about you got a daughter of god that wants to live for the lord filled with the holy ghost raise your children and you have nothing to praise her about but you see the power of thought we become negative on one aspect of our lives and our life is so multi-channel that negativity will grow from the one channel and flood over into the other channel and then the other channel then before long the whole streams of your life is plagued with negativity sarcasm bad attitude nothing's right anymore nothing's going wrong you ain't got praise for nothing or nobody you're still trying to make up your mind whether you even like god or not [Applause] priest brother donnie i'm with you ah but why is it so easy for us to look and pick on the negative parts why it's the power of thought satan is slowly but gradually pulling you into this world that is non-existent but to you it's so real and the way you're looking at it you're exactly right and everybody that differs with you is exactly wrong because to you this is a real world it's a real world it's a fantasy it's a world of dreams it's a world that is non-existent but it's very real to you that's why i can pour out of your being sarcasm and false fine this is never right that's never right you're looking for the perfect church well i'll tell you there is not one some of you looking for a perfect pastor if you let me know if you find one let me know where he is we'll all move there of course i'd hate to do it twin because if we all went we'd ruin it [Applause] i was thinking about it one day this week if you lived in the first church age and you was looking for the perfect church in the first church age which one would you chose the church at ephesus when they were deep in predestination but didn't know how to love their wives would you chose the church at corinth there was real spiritual so-called but didn't know how to operate gifts would you chose a church at philippi read the new testament church and see what kind of problems they had and you'll find out they're much like our churches today but it really depends upon the power of the world of thought that you live in you see if that's your power of thought that you've created this thing around you i'm looking for the perfect church so you go here and you go there and you go there and you go there and then you never find you never father but if you create a world by thought to know it's not this church itself is perfect but this is only part of a mystical move of what god's doing how many is here i have no idea you don't either so don't suppose to judge it only god knows that but you live and the powers talk i'm not going to find a perfect church i'm going to hear the word i'm going to worship i'm going to receive from god i'm gonna be frank and honestly i don't expect everybody here at this church to be perfect i don't expect anybody to do what i'm telling them i don't expect everybody to live up to what i preach the bride will who that is i don't have no idea but a long time ago i moved my expectation from a perfect people to a perfect god by the way i'm never disappointed but what if we would think on lovely things pure things things of good report things of virtue things of praise now paul consummates it all now rather than whichever things are true whatsoever things are honest whichever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think think on these things now look it's more than letting them pass through your mind we looked at this last night but let's look at it again for the sake of those it wasn't here to reckon count compute metaphorically to pass to one's account to impute a thing is reckoned as or to be something to consider to take into account so as you think on those things that are pure and lovely and honest and of good report you're adding this to your account in heaven you don't need in heaven heaven consists of this now is where i need to draw from it so what if i think the opposite of these things if i think hatefulness and contrariness and nobody's right but me i'm also adding those to my account and i guarantee you i will draw from my account [Applause] you're going to live from your spiritual checking account whatever you put in it if it's bitterness and envy and strife and hatred you'll write check after check after check i have to check from that account but if you think on whatsoever things are good and faithful all my virtue and praise you can write check after check after check after check well friends i've come to realize what a lot of folks never have too many kind words to say they don't have many saved up why is it so much easier to criticize than it is to praise that's their largest account their largest account is criticism they have so little bit of praise for anybody they've got it in a special savings account and it's in a special safe locked up and locked up and locked up and locked up and the only one they use it on mostly is them [Applause] boy they rock and check you sorry low down good for nothing aggravating check after check after check after check i don't want to hurt your feelings but i don't want your jacks that's a challenge because i get some negative checks all the time you shouldn't have said that you should preach this this way you idiot let me say something you did not believe some of the emails and things i've got over the years been in the message people in this message will treat you worse than any pentecostal i ever dealt with i've been treated way worse by these folks and i have pentecostal folks oh yeah that's part of it that's part if there's more truth here i expect that and i can subject myself and come underneath them bad checks and start opening me up another account donnie reagan the down donny reagan the defeated donny reagan the no good donnie reagan the lousy larry elliott the sorry dale orndorff the scum of the ass or you can return to sender insufficient funds we're going to charge you 25 for writing us that cold check [Applause] and instead you can open you up another count and another account and another account let me see what i can title this one i'm going to title this account donny reagan the blessed oh i like that donny reagan the happy i like that one too donny reagan the revelation yes sir donnie reagan the son of god donnie reagan the heel johnny reagan the delivery donny reagan the regime donated reagan the bribe [Applause] praise the lord how by the power of salt and it won't be god's thought and it won't be yours it'll be mine this world that i live in will be my world which i create according to how much i believe this word and the more i submit the more my world can be covered with this blessing and the more i retain to myself and refuse to give up the more i'll be bound i'll be a christian i'll be saved but my joy will be so limited my praise will be so little the purity that i see don't you understand why people have such a hard time seeing purity they don't have it in themselves to the pure all things are pure the reason is that because they are so filled with purity themselves they're co-looking from within how can a merciful person be unmerciful they can't blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy how can a happy person constantly put off sadness they can't let's stand [Applause] now the lord will look at this next weekend but the contrast of this is romans chapter 8 verse 5. very next scripture there brother daniel for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh and the word their mind is aspire to something what drives you a force a desire which makes you want to achieve a certain goal so either we will mine the flesh or we will mine the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the spirit but they that are the flesh rather but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit i realize i put a lot out to you today but may god help us we can have a goal set before us say god i want to become are you talking about a miracle brother jim you know i'm talking about a miracle that we're exposed to so much down stuff in this day so much trouble so much sickness you realize that the media there's a lot of it you pick up your newspaper five thousand died here 500 died here 600 killed in a typhoon in the philippines and now it's turning right back around and going right back to it again we read those things and never shed it here well years ago it take how many years for that news to even get around the philippines that had a typhoon to come to the united states come by boat come across the pacific it might be years before that news that ever gets here but to you and i as soon as something happens to get it on our smartphone and by that it's desensitizing us all the trauma all the heartache all the sorrow all the rape all the things that's going on and it's desensitizing us as humans and yet in that world god tells us take on things that are good that's right amen latest breaking news fox news 7.2 earthquake hits tokyo i ain't interested in that and in that type of a world you aunt got cancer this family has shed cancer your uncle had diabetes your daughter's fixing getting a divorce this has happened and that's how you say oh god oh god i can't take no more don't you understand what's going on someone is wanting to control your mind [Music] he'd give up on your soul a long time ago if you're sealed but he still wants your mind for whoever controls your mind controls you now you can be filled with the holy ghost and come here to this church and be so sad never have one smile on your face never have nothing to live for no joy permeates out of you you're telling me under control of the holy ghost there ain't no way there's another force and it's so powerful in your emotions you can't even worship you can't even praise you understand friends where many folks are they're in this dead feeling of emotionalism toward god towards humanity many people can cry no more they can't laugh no more they can't rejoice no more it's like we're in a world of non-feeling so people just said look at you oh god help me to never get like that i'm gonna cry when it's time to cry harry i want to laugh when it's time to laugh i want to rejoice when it's time to rejoice but i won't get it from out here because that's the way they are their past feeling but i want to draw from my accounts well there's still tears there's still tears in my account there's still joy in my account there's forgiveness and my kind of mercy and my god may god help me but i by the word of god can create a world and it's a non-existence not non-existent it is a real existent place a land of promises land of fulfillment land of purity in the midst of darkness and hell yet i can live and you can live as if though we were in a cocoon and within our souls heartache on every hand i sent brother jeff the text of the day and told him brother jeff we certainly rejoice and our brother lonnie has finished his journey in life but we certainly certainly feel for you and your family and your church it's amazing is it for a child of god when they go beyond the other world into that other world you have two extreme emotional feelings you are so happy for them that you're so sad for the ones that leave behind and said for yourself that it wasn't you how in the world can we be such extreme that shows you what kind of person you are you are such an extreme person who contacts both worlds oh god may god help us we love him with all your hearts you think this is attainable have i preached something to you today that is walt disney is it another princess story is it a fairy land of fantasy somewhere is it attainable tell me church do you believe us all your heart this is attainable from the word of god even now in this day glory to god do you hear that father they believe it lord hallelujah hallelujah let's pray together if you would heavenly father i know lord have given a lot to think about and me as well lord jesus i pray you'd help us father god i want to become this lord as harry song open this for us i want to be lord when i'm here and preach because this preaching is to me as well lord jesus please help me help me god i know it'll be a real challenge for me because i'm exposed to so much difficulty and sorrow church troubles and lord having to counsel pastors from all over the world oh god sometimes i just get so weary of it all and i wish so many times you'd have left me down in kentucky lord pastor in that little church and i'd never had to come here never had to have an internet and a website and all that stuff where people would hear about us and oh how many times i wish i could have just been left alone yet lord i believe this was your plan so forgive me for thinking that lord you see our desires no doubt many of them think they wish they could just go back and live in the wilderness no wonder brother ben said if we had that faith have access to it we'd create our own private world and go live a profit life on it it was a man of great experience speaking what he would do himself help us lord it's been carol was talking about it last night and then this morning when i couldn't sleep lord i thought about it in my mind am i crazy and my nuts as i lay down and turned and tossed outside and i thought donny you're going crazy do you really think people can live this thing but god it's not what i said it's not my word it's yours i pray lord you'll help each of us father i have my hand on this prayer cloth for brother frank lord you see these needs in his body i pray in the name of jesus may your healing virtue go to our brother lord maybe others share in the building today lord they're sick they're suffering may the presence of god help them i'm sure all of us can say today lord we need help in our minds to the power of thought granted lord jesus if a man who is nothing can receive a thought from satan and convince him that he's something he can transcend a world of fact and reality and begin to believe he is something when in reality he's nothing that thought will change his attitude his behavior toward others that thought will change the way he treats other people and he's living in a world that is non-existent and he has deceived himself if that through the power of the negative thought can do that what about a child of god taking the word and shooting down all these other thoughts with that double barrel shotgun lord jesus what could it do for us the possibilities that lay before us when astronauts can transcend the gravitational pull of the earth when brother branham was here they went out and flew around the earth and made so many passes and come back but now they've excelled beyond that now they go out and live on the space station and they're there for months and over a year and there they live in that realm they're still in touch with the earth they have radio frequencies they get their meals from there still but for the most part gravitational pull doesn't affect them no more because they're living in a spiritual space station i'm talking about the spiritual astronaut now is it possible lord that we as your children could still live in this world and sure we'll think about bacon and eggs and think about going on picnics with their families these brothers that like to hunt they'll still plan on hunting trips and they like to fish or golf or these sisters like to get together and talk about new recipes they'll still do that but they're a spiritual astronaut in their soul they revert back at the end of the day during the middle of the day when they feel overwhelmed they write checks on their accounts of purity the accounts of honesty of a good report granted lord god help us out pray father oh lord jesus thank you lord how many believes it today with all your heart [Music] hallelujah thank you lord jesus i've got to need my body i want to make known to you today i want you to pray for me i hate to trouble you but a few weeks ago i had something to happen in my eye and it was an arc of light about like this right above my eye and i would see it at certain times for sorry for a couple of days something like that and then the light itself disappeared but then i got this floater they call them right in the middle of my eye and uh there's a big one here small one here and small and there and i went to a doctor and the doctor looked at it dilated my eyes and i have what is called a posterior vitreous separation all of you know what that is i'm sure yeah right about like i did the eye contains 99.4 water and liquid type of things in your eye it has a contents that's kind of jelly-like substance of atreus humor it's called which attaches itself to the back of the eye near the retina as you get older i don't show what happened to me but as you get older then your eye begins to age as the rest of your body does the vitreous humor on the back part of your eye can begin to pull away from your eye and when it does it can tear the retina it can be a partial tear or it can actually tear the retina completely loose from the eyeball and mine was a partial tear that was the circle of light that i was seeing the ark of light and then the floaters that's remained in my eye and the doctor was concerned that he wants to watch it because of a tree of schumer once it pulls off it's more weighty and more heavy than the retina so it can actually tear the retina loose from the back of the eyeball if it does you only have a matter of hours to get it reattached or you go blind because as the retina is tore loose from the eye it loses oxygen it loses blood flow so you go blind don't do at all because that ain't what i'm signing for i'm believing god for his grace but it is a serious type of situation and he said probably it's your age your 50s he said uh the left eye may do exactly the same thing well that's what he thought but i didn't sign for that either uh really nothing that they can do as far as for the floaters to turn the eye there is a laser procedure but yet not really much they can do if the retina does detach then they can go in by surgical procedure and and reattach it but for several weeks actually whenever i was going hunting in illinois and indiana that tormented me to death because looking in the trees looking in the fields and all that is constantly before my eye constantly moving right in the center of my eye whenever i set and study it just about drives me crazy because i'm sitting and looking at the computer i have to move my eye to one side up and down probably most of you got floaters so you know what i'm talking about but this one is just so huge but i believe in the power of prayer and i have confidence in faith in your prayers i believe you believe somebody sick who is it gracie lord jesus we pray for our little sister right now lord god in the name of jesus father may you move forward satan i rebuke you in the name of jesus
