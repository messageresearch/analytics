able to know that he's a living God not an idol not some form of religion but a real living person we're blessed we're blessed to be able to have this place where we can come and have church we're blessed to be able to have friends we're blessed to be able to have people that can pray for us time of trouble stand with us we're blessed that we're talked about ah my goodness it was amazing how few amens I got on that come on just be honest we all like praise more than criticism don't we well God's good any amen amen the street tonight for the Book of Revelation if you would chapter 18 verse 4. I'd like to um request your prayers if you would Lance and Erica I went today down to Nashville and Eric will be starting the a new treatment tomorrow it's called glutathara it's a radioactive type of stuff it's about a four hour procedure tomorrow and and show and she'll be coming on tomorrow night and then she'll have to get a shot that they require to take also be getting that on Friday but our God's been faithful it's true and he's he's going to be mindful of us through this with all these things of course there comes a whole list of side effects which is pretty discouraging if you read them but there was also a whole list of side effects with the y90 the one that she took and she hardly had any of them right that's what I'm talking about that's our God I've been serving him a long time and I've found out a long time ago he don't he don't take orders good from us we all still like to give them to him but I've learned through my hard-headedness and my stubbornness no doubt I'm the only one here in the room tonight that's been that way but I've learned that his way is so different from my way and he don't really need my input or my advice but what he wants is my trust and I love you amen so whatever we Face we just know that his his grace will be with us and he'll help us and I firmly believe God has our life in his hands and Satan cannot cannot take us and God is done with us This Is How firm I believe it if you're on a 747-400 you left Los Angeles at 8 pm you're on your way to Auckland New Zealand somewhere out in the Pacific the first engine goes out the second then the third then the fourth but then you realize you're in big trouble the plane starts down it crashes hits the water at 500 miles an hour but it just so happens it's not your time to go there ain't no way the devil can take you if I didn't believe that I'd quit preaching and I'd quit serving the lord Jesus if he cannot take care of me and you well friends you think the devil let one of us be alive if it was at his power to take us there ain't no way he can do that our life is in his hands amen so if you'd remember some in prayer during that situation and we'll certainly keep you posted hope you don't mind us giving you updates and prayer requests and things like that amen Revelation chapter 18 verse 4. and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people so that tells me that God can have people that are in a mess whether it's sin or in this state of denominational mess come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled feel to her double now you know this already you and I can't do this and if there's anything about us that wants a vengeful Spirit on people that do us wrong we need to repent ask the Lord to forgive us but there is a measure by which this can be done which actually is righteous I hope this don't stagger you tonight but this is actually righteousness being handed out in a just measure now most humans cannot do this because we think so and so got me I'll get them if it's the last thing I do no that's not what we're talking about this is righteousness carried out not Revenge not human revenge and eventual attitude how many lots of people remember tonight as we pray Heavenly Father we love you so much we're so thankful Lord Jesus that we could have this place where we could be able to assemble ourselves together Lord we realize that No Doubt it's very unusual things that are being said for the staff employees whoevermore that would walk by the doors and hear and see things they've never heard and seen before but we believe we're here for a reason father maybe there's a little seed of God walking around out here and they've been looking their whole life you've got us here for one so we don't know but we know father God we believe our lives are divinely orchestrated by you Lord as we approach your word tonight we're asking for your help we know father that there's so much sickness going on flu viruses all different kinds of things Lord we know many are sick and can't be here tonight we're praying for them that you would just move for them Lord Jesus you see our needs spiritually father we need you to come by this way tonight open our understanding your ways are so much different than ours help us not to process what we're going to hear tonight by mental conception but May It Be by divine intervention speak to us from your word father we love you father God before we partake of this Meal which you have prepared for us tonight we give you thanks make it sustenance to our soul as we bow our heads before we pray over our natural breakfast lunch and supper so now we with gratitude and Thanksgiving in our hearts thank you for this word that you're going to feed us on tonight may it give us all kinds of nutrients and vitamins and things that will mold in us more of the image of the Lord Jesus for it's in his name we ask it amen amen God bless you you may be seated let's read continue on if you would in verse 7. how much she has glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I set a queen and am no Widow and shall see no sorrow now I want you to listen to this self-evaluation of whoever this is now most of you of course know who it is but whoever this is representing she views her status in a place of such security she's boastful she's vain she's proud she's arrogant she glorified herself now whoever this is apparently cannot receive correction from God's word she looks at herself with such an evaluation of who she thinks she is I would imagine most of us have dealt with this attitude where we look at ourselves our understanding our perception of God our perception of his people our perception of our understanding no doubt we've evaluated ourselves higher sometimes than what we really were and no doubt we've evaluated ourselves in some instances where we were actually evaluating ourselves lower than we really were it takes God to help us in this evaluation to be able to see it properly there's been times I've needed my evaluation to be lifted higher and there's been other times I've needed it to be brought down a little bit lower no doubt I'm the only one here tonight so I'll go ahead and preach to myself on that I'll just go ahead and amen myself Amen brother Donnie that's right you've been there but you see the difference between us and this woman is that if she heard this she was never able to re-evaluate herself in the light of God's word no doubt she was reproved rebuked she was chastened by ministers down to the ages but it was basically like pulling water off of a duck's back it just run right off she paid no attention and she would always come back to this self evaluation I am a queen I am a great entity to God and to humanity the world needs me the world cannot operate properly without me I hope nobody here tonight thinks that you know I don't care who you are and what your position is every one of us are replaceable but the truth of it is nobody can take Jesus please if time terries long enough I'll go to the way of the grave and you all will get another Pastor if time tarries long enough Harry will go by the way of the Grave Brother Louis will all these singers all these musicians and go and face the facts all of you with us and the church will go right on but I won't go right on with it and neither will you but yet this entity had come to a spot that John said how much she has glorified herself and this glorification brought this other adjective which John used by the spirit of God to describe her and that was she had lived deliciously what a strange way to describe an entity that had been so destructive an entity that had been interwoven and intertwined with the kings of the Earth as a matter of fact she delegated herself in her position and her Authority as higher than the empress the Kings and the dictators of the earth even higher than God's word and she had no problem making the Declaration that God's word was just a Bible that's all it was full of mistakes and errors but the absolute was her Pope well I'll tell you one thing I'm glad he ain't my absolute aren't you now notice how God is going to regulate the Judgment that will be given to this entity so John says how much she's glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her now most of us will never do this in the magnitude that this church did but you don't have to be in this magnitude all you got to do is have this same attitude as an individual well I'll tell you one thing if this is what you get back for it I want nothing to do with it I don't want to glorify myself do you we don't want to glorify our church we don't want to glorify us as individuals we want to glorify the Lord Jesus because self-glorification ends up in this type of Destiny so whether it's preachers singers songwriters musicians or a global entity like this city church that we are looking at and all leads to the same reward oh my so much torment and sorrow give her for she sayeth in her heart I sit a queen now this is the way that she has the self-evaluation she looks at herself as the Queen of Heaven the wife of God she is not divorceable she cannot die she cannot be put away this is why she looks at this in such an arrogant tenor and such a tone of voice that she looks at herself in the spot of eternal security God cannot put her away God cannot divorce her well you know what this reminds me and lets me know then if there is an entity like this that is saying this she must be impersonating someone who can say it truthfully praise the Lord that truly can say I said as a queen but because of his Mercy not because of anything I've done and as brother random said it well he can put us away any time he wants to but dare any of us try to put him away but she because of her arrogance looks at herself and evaluates herself and yet she says I said a queen and am no little I am married to El shadiah I am married to the eternal I am no Widow and I can be no Widow I'll set a queen and I will see no sorrow I am God's voice on the earth I am his mouthpiece if the pope acquires there is a Purgatory then there is one although the Bible says so or not the Bible don't have to say it well if the Pope says the streets of Glory are peanut butter and jelly does that make it so well I guess if you're a true Catholic it does I guess if you're died in the world and you're part of this move then you say yeah and don't condemn them too hard because as many folks that said unto the influence of message preachers and if that preacher gets up and says it's this way that way that way and that way and you show them one quote after another and scripture after another and they will not be corrected by that in reality they are spiritual Catholics and they just made their Pastor their Pope well praise the lord well the prophet said well we know the prophet said it that way but God led me this way then you're just as bad as wrong well we're going to have church tonight or what now notice the word that John used there she has glorified herself and the word means to boast she she boasted of her greatness you know you get around people like that and their favorite subject is what themself it's not the weather it's not how good their vegetable garden done their maiders their taters or beans you know it's about them and then you know myself I get tired there's very few people that I love spending on our list and 57 and a half minutes is about them now the Lord Jesus I can take the whole hour and he can talk to me about his greatness and all amen till I'm hoarse and I love to hear him talk that way but I don't know any other Mortal that I do now look I love you all okay I love you all but I I don't like caring about you all for an hour and a half at a time because I know you all too well and you all know me well enough to know there ain't enough in me good enough to talk about but let's talk about something that's good let's talk about something that's holy and something that's righteous and and sure we got our position in the kingdom of God but really in reality there's none of us that have a whole lot to boast about thousands of souls to Christ praise the Lord but you have nothing to boast about yourself God gave you the ability to do that well I pray for so-and-so and I've done this wonderful thank God for that but only God's grace will give you that not your Merit it doesn't make you better than the man that's only prayed for one person and they got better God is the one who gives those gifts out all praise all credit all all exaltation goes to him not to us [Applause] um but you see this entity this city church this city state she is so arrogant and proud and she exalts herself above God's word exalts herself above Kings above Emperors she's been in this position for many many centuries she outlived Napoleon she outlived Constantine she outlived Herodotus she outlived Pope Boniface and all down through there this entity has lived for thousands of years ongoing and still today has a greater influence than any King on the Earth our president is a novice compared to the power of this entity which is Rome well praise the Lord come on now you'll realize that God God never trusts any mortal with this type of power man it's just not in him to be trusted with such a position no matter how great the kings were in the Old Testament but look at it Lord willing on Sunday and even one as great as David was but yet David when he got to a place to where the kingdom was established and David got to trust him too much in himself and David made a horrible horrible mistake and you remembered but the sin was Bathsheba and God never intended for man to be placed in such a position because this is what follows with many of them and God says about this city church that she lived deliciously in a luxurian type of manner and yet many of her parishioners that she claims as her own they will come and have to sacrifice and buy a candle and buy this and that and the other novenas and pray to get someone out of purgatory and many of them have to take a big portion of their living to do so and bring it into what a which is given them damn damnation to their soul now come on don't sit there and look at me funny and yet this is what God says about them now remember this was prophecy 2 000 years ago but I believe with all of my heart we are the generation living on the earth tonight that are going to see the consummation of these things right here so God says because of that attitude and what you've done so much torment and sorrow give her by pulling down her Pride by bringing her arrogance to a spot to where she will realize she is absolutely nothing God will take away her control and her power she will who will boast of being the longest ruling entity that the world has ever known but been withstood by Kings and Emperors and potentates and dictators and yet not been able to destroy her and yet God will humiliate her in one hour she will be annihilating oh my God thank God for his Mercy to help us to see our pride and our arrogance or we would be annihilated just like she would God will destroy her with what fire atomic fire she saith in her heart I set a queen now again as I said this is a self-estimate you find this also of course in Revelation 3 when the laodicee in church says I am rich I am increased with goods and I have need of nothing that's their evaluation but God reevaluates her case and said you don't know it but you're wretched you're blind you're naked you're miserable and what makes it so bad is you don't even know that you are now we might not have been Catholics but we were all layout of sins so that's the case we were in we were wretched we were blind we were naked we were miserable well why aren't we that way tonight Amazing Grace how sweet to Sam now notice the authority that she claims and this claim is actually very much true that's your house authority over the kings of the earth she also has a spiritual jurisdiction by which she Reigns through apostasy now what is apostasy it's the word that Paul used writing in the New Testament and he said there would come in the last days that the Lord could not come until there came a falling away now that Greek word those apostille apostasia and it is the word the English word is the apostasy so it's a falling away from something that was right declared to be a truce and yet people turn away from that and they go away so she is holding the people her constituents of her Believers by a face which is an apostasy do they have to have faith yes they have to believe that what they're doing is it's sad it is there's no doubt many sincere people oh brother Donnie I've got somebody in that move keep praying for them that God will bring them out remember as long as they're in her they're still Mercy for them until she goes into him now remember when the bride goes up and the Devil comes down the transition is made from the church itself then Satan will become the headship on the earth then the church everything about it will move into him and the prophet said if your name is found on that stalk book you will die with her so while there's still breaths in their body while Mercy is still there while the blood is still on The Mercy Seat oh I've got a son I've got a daughter I've got a husband and a wife or pray for him little Esther it might be your prayer that God will hear and turn them around you may think I'm crazy tonight I'd rather have a loved one if they was taken off the Earth than to be spared of going through that tribulation period if they wasn't Blood come on now I'd much rather the Lord but take them off the Earth and let him be judged for what they know than to live through this time because we know many will come out and they will withstand this move and the prophet said they will be hunted down like dogs and they will give their lives for what they knew oh but I'm so glad I'm not going to be hunted down like no dog I ain't no dog in the first place I'm going to be carried away into a body change and enjoying the marriage supper of the Lamb with you my brothers and sisters oh praise the Lord thank you Lord Jesus and she says she will see no sorrow now sorrow of course can be expressed in many different ways I will see no loss of my children I will see no loss in my constituency I will see no loss of my power of my position everything that's involved in all of the Proclamation of who she thinks she is God will strip her from that in a moment of time and it will be totally gone he will humiliate her before the world all had us blessed Rock of Ages uh that this book of History I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it or not but it was a man by the name of tornb t-o-y-n-b-e-e and his history wrote a book on the great world's history and according to the chronological order of tornba's History all the great world civilizations they all crumble when they reach the heights of their power now whether it was the macedonians whether it was the Greeks or the Romans parthians whichever ones that it was don't you understand why that America is absolutely on her way down I hope you're able to see it we have reached the Pinnacle of our power look around we've been going downhill for years oh I know they want to make America great again will never do it I don't care who gets in the white house I don't care who vote who you vote in it'll never return she's on her way down look at our society look at our civilization come on you're probably ready today our Senate want to now make sure that they make it a law to where that the gays can keep their rights oh of course and it won't be but a matter of time that they'll want to jail preachers like me to preach against it well come on say Amen but will we compromise we will not compromise we'll stand for God's word because if we stand for him now he will stand for us amen he will stand for US Open by the Donnie it may get scary it may get scary but he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you oh my notice in verse 8. therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judges her death and she thought she'd never die she was God's mouthpiece so she said and she's told this life for so long I believe she believes it you see the dangerous part of a reprobate is that God before an individual ever gets to the state of being reprobated God will deal with him and deal with him two times three times five times who knows how many times but eventually God will stop dealing with them and he allows them to go to that spot to where they're turned over to reprobate mind that they will believe a lie and be damned by the lie that they believe but you see God is Not unjust to make people do that he gives them Mercy but they choose to believe that lie and turn down the truth and she honestly believes the self-evaluation I'm a queen I'm the voice of God I have the representation of God if the Pope says this or this or this he's God's man on the earth he has the ability to decree such a thing and they believe it was all of their hearts but yet God says this is what I will do I will bring her Mourning I will bring her morning instead of her feasting I will bring her destruction and I will bring the seat of the Beast to Total Annihilation and humility before the kings of the earth now notice God is not going to let this happen at the battle of Armageddon God is actually going to destroy this entity of this world power before the end of the tribulation period he will destroy her before the end of the tribulation period that she may be humbled why she humbled his people on earth she was the power that dragged many of them in the Spanish Inquisition she was the power that dragged many not only Christians but Jews all around the world and had them killed and in her is the blood of the prophets and the blood of the martyrs and the blood of the Saints and she did it in public forms she did it in public trials and bought false Witnesses and paved them to stand up and lie against the people of God and God said I will not let her go out in the rest of the Flames of Armageddon I will annihilate her before the entire world I will let them see her be destroyed and no doubt on YouTube on all types of social media it will be accepted around the world and they'll look at all know they'll cry they'll weep they'll moan they'll lament and they'll look and say how could this be because great is the Lord God who judges her and thank God that friends if God had not given us mercy and then we responded to that Mercy we would be one of them left on the earth and instead of being in the mercy of God we will be under the wrath of God oh I'm so glad to know that I've accepted his love and his Mercy in his forgiveness out and if you want to call me whatever you want to but oh I'm so glad that I received that Mercy many many years ago and not only did I when I first got saved I receive it every day of my life amen it's renewed every day that I live Hallelujah oh Hallelujah notice this I quote this to your last the Wednesday night that I dealt with this this is from The Mark of the Beast remember I say this that's God's prophet the Russian Empire not USSR the Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican City and destroy it in one hour I'm sure you've been hearing the news and the bomb or whatever it was that happened in Poland and they're trying to figure out did that come from Russia where did it come from why Poland is a NATO a NATO member so if it was dropped by the Russians on there a bomb dropped on them is the same equivalent to a bomb dropped on us now it becomes more scary oh brother Donnie oh man what are we going to do we're fixing to leave that's what we're fixing to do before one bomb will ever drop we will leave this world friends be ready I know some of you have heard this for years and years and years but you're living in the generation that this is going to happen hallelujah oh let's get ready to leave this world the Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican City and destroy it in one hour thus saith the Lord and the Bible said that God took them cruel-hearted men and put them in the hands and they were instruments in his hands to fulfill his will men like Putin I don't know if Putin's a man or not but you know what if he ain't it maybe somebody behind him you're saying why would they do that to Ukraine what in the world is going on there's always been that type of people on the Earth if one man one man can cause a destruction our brothers and sisters I would send a video the other day of some of our brothers and sisters in Ukraine and they blowed a lot of their power stations down they had no electricity and they was there holding a candle the song leader holding a candle little saints back to there with flashlights and and their phones are shining on the words and they were singing a song and worshiping God all right in the middle of a war I thought yeah that's the real people of God that's the real people of God no electricity bundled up and cold you know cold in the in the building having on coats and a little flashlight and they came go but they didn't stop their worship they didn't stop them from preaching and didn't stop them from going to the house of God my goodness we get a little sniffle and we stay at the house and stream there they were right in the middle of a war but they said you know what it's Church time let's go to church we got no electricity let's go to church we ain't got no heat but let's go to church anyhow amen no real believer has that desire to get together with the people of God oh my oh when this happens look at verse 9. and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lay of deliciously now she lived deliciously in verse 8. now these kings are identified with the same adjective that John uses to describe that church so you see being a partaker in people's sins identifies you with the same adjectives or adverbs oh my God so she lived deliciously and they are also identified in the same way live deliciously with her shalt be wailed her now notice this is not the end the end of the Armageddon God will allow many of these Kings potentates dictators and rulers and they will see her destroyed and they will weep and cry and lament oh such fearful what are we going to do what are we going to do who's going to press out of purgatory now there ain't no Pope on the earth there ain't no Bishop I'm here I've got my rosary out and ain't nobody to even tell me I need to confess my sins I'm so glad I don't have to wait for No priest on that ain't you I'll tell you one thing they're going to be in a mess and they're all Blow from here to Kingdom Come they ain't going to be a priest left on the earth well come on now there ain't going to be no Pope left on the earth there ain't going to be one diocese going to be left on the earth who are you going to pray to then I'm glad I don't have to go to the pope himself I'm going to have to go to some Bishop somewhere I've done got a high priest living inside my soul tonight amen praise the Lord the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall be weld her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning so CNN ABC whoever more sending over their drones you imagine all this radioactivity coming out of Italy and all this that's going on and yet they'll lament and they'll cry and they'll weep reckon that'll happen when the bride goes I found out them bunch of Holy Rosary says I said hallelujah hallelujah they're gone man alive I'm so glad them people's gone they've been a thorn in my side ever since I've worked with them they wouldn't cut here you know they wouldn't do this she wouldn't cut her hair she wouldn't wear makeup she wouldn't wear britches and that boy I'll tell you what he wouldn't smoke he wouldn't tell no dirty jokes around the rest of it I'm so glad I imagine it'll be similar like it was in the land of Egypt one Pharaoh said no I ain't letting you go God said oh yeah you will said no I ain't going to do it he said yeah you will and you'll be glad to let him go and they were so glad by the time they got ready to leave they said take my gold take my silver take my Platinum here's my converter out here's my credit card here's my debit card just get out of here just get out of here and leave us alone oh Hallelujah happy day happy day when the bride goes out of here the devil says I'm glad you all are gone and we'll look back down and said so are we devil and so are we no more trouble no more devil no more hurting no more anxiety [Applause] I know some of y'all think I'm just about the craziest preacher you ever seen in your life but believe it or not I'm preaching you a body changing message [Applause] when they shall see imagine how strange this must have been when the prophecy come out of John's mouth how on the way was that even possible at that time it wasn't possible in the natural sense so the kings of the Earth not just the kings of Rome Sicily but the kings of the Earth how is that even possible in that day it wasn't possible brother Josh but it's prophetic so God could speak it as if though it had already happened even though the Scientific Technology wasn't even available until that all the kings of the earth see it at one time God's word don't lie France oh notice this when God begins to enter into his judgment the church's enemies oh Lord that trusted in the arm of Flesh and use their civic and ecclesiastical and political power to persecute the church I don't want to be in their shoes myself you see the strongest man the wealthiest man the man with the most power or influence you're talking about a terrifying time hide us Lord Jesus not only do the merchants now I've read to you already some of the business things that they are involved in but not only are the merchants of the Earth going to lament but the Kings the rulers one day when the books are open and we all stand before him at the white Throne I would say we'll be surprised how much involves that she's been in the government of the world we're finding out more and more what a bigger part she had in World War II with the trying to exterminate the Jews notice in verse 10. standing afar off for the fear of her torment what is it nuclear Fallout they see what happened to her they see the destruction and they're standing author how are they able to see this then if they're standing afar off science drones TV cameras YouTube well don't look for me on YouTube then because all my videos will be gone standing will fall off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great City Babylon that Mighty City know this this is not a country it is not a nation a city a city so it's not an Empire in the sense of being over Spain over Europe over the Americas it is a city a city-state we know that Mighty City for in one hour is not judgment come alas alas that great City that Mighty City look at their admiration for her what is wrong with these people can't they see what just happened to this and they still stand there with this admiration in their hearts oh no oh no I can't believe it I keep believing look what's happened to her you see even these that are left on the Earth are still missing that Divine Touch of the supernatural to be able to help them see when God abandons something and stands against it you either stand against it or you're identified with it you see we're living in such a compromising age people don't want to know where right and wrong is they want to know where the middle is so they can kind of walk that treacherous path you know well what does everybody want me to say well you know what the advertisers want me to say you know the woke and the left deal and all that they're all just compromises and you've got to go with lgbq2yozo3050 whatever it is and you've got to find well what's the world want me to say what's the world want me to say well whatever they want me to say that means I ain't going to say it because if they're wanting me to say it no doubt it's wrong because they're the world but that's the way the order of the world Cosmos is going to do come on children my goodness we see many of our churches and they're compromising I'm sure you've heard about the Methodist Church they've had a big split why because of them open and voting in a gay Bishop want to lose a matter with them don't you know that it was the sodomites knocking on the door of Lot's house it was them perverts that was coming down their wall was locked down in the land of Sodom you don't find them perverse knocking on Abraham's oak tree do you Abraham wouldn't put up with such stuff as I come on now somebody Oh my he might not make them live right but he could stand and say that ain't right it's over the devil amen because he was not a compromiser but the worldly Church look at him oh we love everybody and they're flying their gay flags and putting out the rainbows I ain't the same rainbow the Lord God posted over the Earth why would they take that Covenant sign nothing but blasphemy oh but I say they are the people under the rainbow Covenant on the Earth well if I get killed y'all remember I love you the merchants of the Earth shall weep and mourn over her they just don't get it do they they just don't get it the destructive power that lays in her and they're still crying because the money for no man biased their merchandise anymore verse 16 is saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen ah and purple ah remember the prophet warned us of three curtains right three curtains but he said don't worry about communism don't worry about the red curtain but it's that purple when you better watch um scarred and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls now these articles aren't so much to be personalized that it's an individual woman but it's showing her her wealth and her power and her control notice in verse 17 4 and one hour so great riches has come to naught and every shipmaster and all the company and ships and sailors and as many as trayed by the sea stood afar off I mean this entity affected merchandise and selling and buying I'm glad the only thing we specialize is is the gospel we don't trade in stocks come on the Church of the Living God that's not no our money is not tied up in that I'll tell you what a lot of your money's tied up in for over 35 years since I've been here as you Pastor you have helped build churches around this entire Earth as a matter of fact there's 44. 44. 44. in Uganda that they're waiting for me to come and dedicate now that you built you see some message people don't believe the scripture that whatever you sow thou so you'll also reap so you know what you've done you have sowed church buildings for years and then people get mad when God rewards you back for what you've done I believe that scripture the way I believe Malachi 4. and if God don't honor that one how can I trust him for the Rapture scripture well come on you have built them around the world now we could have hoarded it and we could have done this and that and the other but that was not what God put on my heart to do and I am so glad because there's churches that didn't have a building to Worship in and they've got one now they didn't have a roof over their head but they've got one now amen and what has God done God's going to turn right around and give you all want where you can start having special meetings that we ain't had in years because Lynn had room to have them we're going to be able to get together and eat and have Fellowship together because we ain't been able to do it and people want to get mad let them get mad let him get mad if they want to but we'll shout right through that new place we'll sit there and have fellowship and we'll have meetings and Shout right on end of the body chain then when we get done they can have it hey it's fine with me if the Lord comes and we don't get to have the first service amen that's exactly right that's the way I feel about it ain't you and they cried when they saw the smoke of her burning you talking about a bunch of reprobates instead of it terrifying them and them saying Oh God have mercy on me have mercy on me God I'm so sorry but instead of being sorry they're sorry they ain't gonna get no more money who's gonna buy all these rosaries in the priest who's gonna buy all this oh no no no how am I going to make my money your money won't be worth anything left to have the mark in your hand or your forehead and they cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city what city is likened to this great City and they cast dust on their heads and cry weeping and wailing single last all I ask now you see if they would have weeped and wailed down on an altar of repentance they wouldn't have been in the tribulation period hey you're going to weep and wail one way or another let me do it on this side oh my wherein we were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of our costliness for in one hour as she made desolate ah but now we hear another voice so the scene changes and the echo is not now coming from those merchants on the Earth but we'll hear another voice sing something totally different this voice says rejoice over her thou heaven and ye Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on her crying lamenting sadness they're so tore up they're throwing dust all over theirself oh man they're just squalling and screaming and hollering and carrying on and they get so beside themselves they just get down on the ground and just talk to them they'll say oh oh no oh no and the device comes out of Heaven says Rich eyes but I want you to notice where the instruction goes to for them to Rejoice from Aaron didn't tell him these crying babies this they won't rejoice know-how but there's got to be a special people and apparently they were in heaven notice this Rejoice over her thou Heaven amen why there ain't none of the election done on the earth to cry in lament whale Rejoice over her thou heaven and your Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on her you see there's three times that heaven is told to Rejoice three times that heaven is told to Rejoice Revelation chapter 12 verse 12 whenever Satan is cast out Heaven is told to Rejoice I hope you don't think this is strange but it's amazing how the correlation of things in the heavens and the Earth and sometimes it'll match and it'll be identical but this is opposites of course that now the Vatican has been destroyed and God lets them lament and well and unless John in the vision sin and John's pinning down what he's seeing and John is seeing all types of people around the world different cultures colors and so on and he's writing it all down Us by the vision he sees him in India he sees them in Europe he sees them all over everywhere and they're weeping and they're crying under lamenting and John's just rotting it down in the vision and then John hears a voice apparently coming out of heaven and that voice says Rejoice heaven Rejoice you heavens and rejoice you apostles and Prophets where were the apostles in heaven where are the prophets in heaven Oh Glory notice on the first time that the heavens is told to Rejoice is when Satan is cast out oh glory to God when literal Babylon is destroyed as we just read in Revelation 18 20 and when the marriage of the Lamb has come which is revelation 19 7. in these three instances which are all-time signs of the end time that when Satan is kicked out the bride goes up and the Devil comes down and Heaven starts shouting and praising God all glory to God the redeemed of all the ages are coming home so what do they do in Heaven Must say well glory to God here comes the bride well Hallelujah she's finally making her home the Lord God is so excited himself and he's so tore up he said go ahead and Shout y'all go ahead and start rejoicing here comes my sweetheart here comes the real Queen of Heaven here comes the real one that will not be a widow here's one that'll not get the atomic bomb she got the Holy Ghost by Supernatural atomics and he changed her soul it changed her attitude it changed her dress it changed her behavior it changed her and now it has changed her body so Heavens rejoice can you imagine from one side of Heaven to the other the heavens start rejoicing because the bride's coming home praise God oh you see the men of the Earth the unregenerate men the men that are not in touch with God from the inner man of the Soul they will always have a different Viewpoint than God and this is where we as the people of God must be so careful you see Satan being cast out of heaven Heaven rejoice but the Earth mourned Heaven's rejoicing and the Earth is mourning Babylon is destroyed the city Babylon is destroyed again Heaven is rejoicing and the Earth is Mourning oh my goodness you see the Judgment of God is the Vindication of righteousness ah I didn't figure I'd get no amens on that the Judgment of God is the Vindication of righteousness you see the voice that speaks out of heaven gives them a Direction You Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath Avenged you on her notice in Revelation 18 24 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the Earth you see there's another reason for her destruction despite the luxury and the wealth it's because she's guilty of killing the people of God oh my God now blood is given for her to drink Lord Jesus I'll say friends myself I don't desire to have any laid to my account or my record that I have hindered or made it harder or increase the burden or the difficulty for one of the least of God's children God forbid that my life or yours would be crowned and saying that you made it so hard for the people of God you inflicted such hardship and caused such difficulty I want to do the opposite myself don't you I don't want to increase people's burdens I I don't want to make it harder on the people of God I want to make it easier if I can notice now we move from revelation 18. to Revelation 19 1. um and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying hallelujah salvation and Glory and honor and Power unto the Lord our God Hallelujah Hallelujah I find this so amazing the use of this word hallelujah it's used in the Old Testament mainly in the Book of Psalms use nowhere in the New Testament except the Book of Revelation and the Jews say that the Psalms are divided into ten different types of songs but the word hallelujah is the perfect unification of the name yah along with praise so in the Old Testament one of us said Hallelujah it was praise yah remember David was the first one to write that whenever he said he is known by his name yah j a h remember reading that in the Book of Psalms so here then when David would use the word hallelujah he's bringing in together praise yah Matthew never mentioned it Mark Paul never mentioned it John never mentioned it until right now hey man so right at the very end after the bride is taken up for great hallelujahs are going to be expressed case you understand Heaven has been awaiting this hour I know we look at it every day we say yes it's awful it's a terrible day to live it it is but the heavens have been waiting for this time God has been waiting for this time to come on the earth and he reserved those four hallelujahs right for the time of the Rapture and The Time Of Satan coming down and the bride going up and the body change it is a great Memorial event in heaven oh praise the Lord how the heavens are under anticipation remember the prophet dentists in the church age book that the gates of pearl had already been hung the streets of gold had already been created now you can imagine when Jesus said there's Saint John 14 open don't lose you here but the heaven the bride is going to had not yet been created when the Lord Jesus was here remember the heavens that existed Satan had been able to go into the nether parts of those Heavens but the place that the bride is going to live there ain't been one devil footprint ever been on them streets and Jesus did not say I'm going back to the city I prepared but I'm going away to prepare a place for you your home was non-existent when he was here Oh Glory to God that's why when the prophet preached the future home it was so astounding to him because God began to show him things that Paul was not allowed to preach Peter was not allowed to preach and he said the gates had already been hung the streets of gold had already been created Jesus has been there he said for many thousands of years creating that City and he tells us on the church Saints book that the angels are sending their breathlessly wow waiting for the inhabitants of that City to throng those streets no wonder they had a spell they've been holding their breath a long time [Laughter] oh you think that you long to see him what if you was in his shoes as we'd say and from before the foundation of the world you had these thoughts I wanted people there will be like me they will love me they will serve me they will choose me over evil and Rome there'll be a tribe people and what if you would long for that type of people if we could measure time say billions of years ago you had this and it was your desire and you started speaking and said let there be let there be but you didn't make them first you started making a home from the living and you started laying out your program and you thought it all through from the very beginning because you're this being that's called The Eternal and you've never had a new salt I don't know about you I can't relate to that I'm always undoing or redoing stuff that I've done before are you all and then you do something you say well I wish I thought of that yesterday that saved me so much time that'd been so much easier if I've done this I thought God ain't never had a new thought God said you know what I think I'll do this and look back and say man a lot I wish I'd done that yesterday because God had never had a new salt but he's been waiting for those thoughts to be made manifest and whenever the heaven starts saying this happen the heavens start having a holy ghost Revival I mean they just go to Hallelujah and praising God what in the world is going on the inhabitants of the city are moving in oh my goodness can you imagine the anticipation some of y'all when you build a new house and you've been made this decision and that decision I hate decisions I've had to make thousands of them in our new facility and all that I'll be so glad when the last one is made and we can move in and say praise the Lord this is our home I'm so excited about it but can you imagine Angelic beings that have been there for a hundred million years and they saw this out of him and they see with the anticipation when he come back up to heaven and they said watch Angels I'm making my wife a new place to live and they stood there and all because they were the only remember the prophet said the first thing that he made was Angels so the Angels stood there as they saw the spin-off of the universe always somebody preached with me right now they stood there and they watched them as time come into existence and they saw across the horrors on a rainbow and across a cycle of light and God spoke and said let there be let there be let there be let there be and they stood there and awe but they hadn't seen him create for millennia until he went back to his Earthly visited and he said I'm going to be on a building program glory to God A New Earth a new star a new city on that blue dot that little speck of dust that I just came back from that's what I want to spend rest om with my little virgin and when the heavens and the angels see all this coming they say she's here so they see him get up from the father's throne and he's got on this Priestly garment it says where and the same stand their father forgive them for they don't know what to do father forgives them for they don't know what to do and our sins coming up as a word hitting him in the faith father forgive them they don't know what to do but they hear the Silence of the Lamb and he's not saying no more father forgives them and they seem step back behind the curtain as it was and he takes off the priesthood garment and he comes out in his robes and he has to die dim in his hand I missed it today's the day it's going home to her they're moving in they're moving in don't call U-Haul but call you you amen you will take your body to meet your theophany they're true and original U-Haul hallelujah hallelujah you may have to haul your body to church you may have to make yourself do things sometimes but brother sister one day you are going to take your body to meet your theophany welcome [Applause] Oh Glory and after these things oh I'd like to take a text from that sometime after these things the gym after our tests and our trials our valleys all the things we go through after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Allelujah salvation and Glory and honor and Power unto the Lord our God you notice these folks wasn't trinitarians and said the Lord our gods imagine the trinitarian folks there'll be some of them that'll make sure they will you imagine whenever they get there and they go looking around and said where's the other two if you read the book of Revelation John give you a little extra after that he said I saw a throne he never says nothing about Sin 3. I saw Ace wrong and one that said on that Throne I preached that years ago down in Texas oh my goodness they throwed me out because I told him just a little some symbol some other says there's another God in heaven he's sitting on the floor if he's other than Jesus because John only saw one God and one throne well it didn't take long for the elders and all of them together and the back doesn't have a little meeting they put me out that's all I'd have been thought about better places oh can you imagine Saints they said the Lord God the Lord our God Hallelujah salvation and honor and Power while they're praising him the merchants on the Earth who's gonna buy my pumpkins now who's gonna buy my converters who's going to buy my gold let's go God has annihilated this entity and they're still weeping and crying and if it weren't for the grace of God one of them people Might Have Been Me oh yeah but God opened our eyes now saying all this tonight we don't hate any of those people if you hate anybody in that system you've not yet entered into the King's life we love them we pray for them that God will help him and open their eyes but I'm so glad when this world is rocking and shaking will we praise in the Lord for myself this is one reason why I don't want to wait to get to heaven I don't have to go into a practice room to start practicing saying hallelujah about 35 years well I can come out I won't be good at it I love to praise him right now I love to say hallelujah and salvation is of our God and he's the almighty the omnipotent I'm going to be ready I'm going to step right out of this Dimension into another I'm going to have my praise shoes on you think I shout now you wait till there man brother Tim was going to grab one another arm and arm those of you that sent him and brother Ron last year down to down at the Youth Camp brother on him grab an arm and arm here though went right across the platform dancing and shouting brother Tim's little bitty old feet bless his heart had so many surgeries on his feet and can't hardly walk oh he'll walk one day amen we'll grab one another by the arm and shout down the streets of gold some of y'all gonna never shouted I probably shouts in oh some of you they said well I have a hard time expressing myself don't worry about it when you get there you won't have no hard time you'll be saying hallelujah salvation Power Glory and Honor under our King he is worthy thou alone are worthy O Lord Lord Jesus thank you to not for your word thank you Father Lord It's not that we are betters there anything about us it's any better than any other Mortal It's Your Grace show Mercy to us Heavenly Father we love you tonight thank you for your truth Lord as the prophet said it years ago when he was here it was three minutes to midnight I wonder how close we are to that Lord I'm so glad I took care of there that I am so glad I'm not looking to politics I'm so glad I'm not looking to our pentagon I'm so glad that I'm not looking at our nuclear achievements because Russia and China boasts both have successfully built Hypersonic missiles that we have absolutely nothing to shoot them down with that can travel so fast that could be right on us and would never even know it but thank you Lord Jesus we are hitting you praise the Lord I'm so grateful Heavenly Father that we have rallied around and with the true Queen so therefore we will not be left wailing and mourning and crying when the queen of the earth is killed and destroyed and annihilated the merchants the Kings the rulers the dictators will be weeping and crime because we have been called by the spirit of God to be identified with sobriety the true Queen the true Esther as her cousin Mordecai told her who is to say that you were called for such a Time as this we O Lord God have been called No Doubt for such a time as this had we lived in the days of Noah would have helped built the ark had with them in the days of Luther we would have been with him Wesley but for some reason you chose for us to live in the last stage may we be faithful may we be true may we be identified with your word Lord so when you're a queen leaves this world we will leave with her oh Hallelujah come Lord Jesus come take us away father politics is rotten the churches are rotten going to the dogs going to Sodom come Lord Jesus maybe there's a Soul over an African gone and Nigeria Poland we don't know where they are bring them in Lord bring them to maturity yes so we can leave this place father Grant it Lord Jesus it's perfectly fine with us if we never get to have one service in our new place if our last service is the Holiday Inn and we move out of the Holiday Inn Oh Glory to God into the greatest place it's ever built we know Lord that the bride has got an invitation to the largest use meeting that's ever been on the Earth or in heaven only young people can go and then we're going to live in a gated community praise God those big Gates hung with pearl and the saints of God living all up and down that City Chihuahua's 216 feet tall build on that angle of descent ascent and descent where it's just like a slight incline in the Water of Life running over out of our yards and trickling down in our neighbor's yard and on down on down on down until it recirculates back to the top of that Great Pyramid Mountain 1500 miles high then Lord our burdens our troubles our sorrows Oh They'll roll away they'll seem as nothing encourage her children tonight Lord Heal the sick father left those that are down and weary we love you tonight Jesus We Worship You Lord God don't you love him tonight Saints don't you just want to love him and thank him for his Mercy to you think we'll be beating up brother Lou if it wasn't for the grace of God if it wasn't for the grace of the Lord to call me no doubt I'd still be out there in Pentecost Brother Louie brother Larry brother Harry these other brothers musicians may be playing for
