[6:35] Jesus on the inside, working on the

[6:52] outside. Oh, what a change in my life.
[6:59] Oh, what a change
[7:05] in
[7:06] my life.
[7:10] For the knockout, if you come and open
[7:11] us up in prayer,
[7:21] let's just bow our heads. Dear Lord, we
[7:23] thank you for this day, Lord, and what a
[7:25] change you did make in our life. And we
[7:27] thank you for continue to work on us,
[7:29] Lord. And Lord, thank you for forgiving
[7:31] us, Lord. When we come up short, may you
[7:33] just help us, Lord. And tonight, I pray
[7:35] that you will just come and use the
[7:36] minister in a mighty way to speak the
[7:38] word, Lord, as we have questions on our
[7:40] heart. May you just use them to to speak
[7:42] uh answers to us, Lord. And and may we
[7:45] have more understanding, more knowledge
[7:46] of your word. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[7:48] name. Amen.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[7:54] Um, I was actually listening to a tape
[7:56] this morning and and uh heard a quote
[7:58] that I just felt and then they asked me
[8:00] to lead songs. So, I just thought I'd
[8:02] read it. So, it says, "But the Bible
[8:03] said he's the same yesterday, today, and
[8:05] forever. Just the same Jesus." Then, if
[8:08] that seems to be a question to you and
[8:10] you ponder over it, you can't make it
[8:12] out and you see the thing happen and you
[8:14] wonder about it, then the angel of the
[8:16] Lord in some way, if you'll be sincere,
[8:18] will reveal it to you. Then it's no more
[8:21] a question. It's the truth. and then
[8:23] then you can stream and shout, "Oh, I'm
[8:25] so thankful." We just pray that the Lord
[8:28] will deal with us on our questions like
[8:30] that tonight. Um,
[8:34] in the morning
[8:37] when I rise,
[8:42] in the morning
[8:45] when I rise,

[9:20] all this world,
[9:24] but give me Jesus.
[9:28] [Music]
[9:32] Oh, and when I am alone.
[9:39] Oh, when I am

[14:19] promise keeper, light in the darkness.
[14:23] My God, that is who you are.
[14:28] [Music]
[14:29] for the Donnie if you come.
[14:32] [Music]
[14:47] I'm glad that's who he is.
[14:52] I announced yesterday
[14:55] we were going to do a question interest
[14:56] tonight.
[14:58] But all day today,
[15:01] the Lord has been dealing with me in a
[15:03] total different direction.
[15:06] So the thing I've learned through the
[15:08] years is
[15:09] follow his direction.
[15:12] Let's read together if you would in 1
[15:14] John 4:3.
[15:18] I want to speak to you for just a little
[15:19] while tonight on born to overcome.
[15:25] 1 John chapter 4 verse three.
[15:29] And every spirit that confesseth not
[15:32] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[15:36] is not of God.
[15:38] And this is that spirit of antichrist
[15:40] where have you heard that it should come
[15:44] even now already? Now remember this is
[15:47] around 90 AD something like that and the
[15:50] spirit of antichrist was already there
[15:52] in the first church age. Even now
[15:55] already is it in the world. Ye are of
[15:59] God little children
[16:03] and have overcome them
[16:06] because greater is he that is in you
[16:10] than he
[16:12] that is in the world.
[16:14] So John is telling them that they are of
[16:17] a more noble descent,
[16:21] a more excellent pedigree. They've been
[16:24] born of something totally different than
[16:26] just flesh. Now let's read 1 John
[16:29] chapter 5 verse 4.
[16:34] And John says it this way. For
[16:36] whatsoever is born of God
[16:40] overcometh the world. And this is the
[16:44] victory that overcometh the world, even
[16:49] our faith. So being born of God, it
[16:51] endus us with the power from on high
[16:55] that helps us to overcome the world. In
[16:58] verse five, he says, "Who is he that
[17:03] overcometh the world? But he that
[17:05] believeth
[17:07] that Jesus is the son of God." So there
[17:11] must be more to this verse than just
[17:14] what modern Christians believe. So by
[17:17] believing that he is the son of God for
[17:19] many of them in the mental aspect they
[17:20] think that makes you an automatic
[17:22] overcomer. But we know enough of those
[17:25] type of people to know that it actually
[17:27] doesn't. So it's more than just
[17:30] knowledge this way. To the to the Jews
[17:32] to the Greeks it was different. To the
[17:35] Greeks knowledge is one thing. To the
[17:37] Jews it was another. To Greeks, it was
[17:39] to be able to know the thesis, the
[17:40] anti-thesis, the approach, the, you
[17:42] know, the different words, the
[17:44] vernacular of it. To the Jews, it was to
[17:47] not only be able to quote the word or
[17:49] the vernacular, but to be able to have
[17:51] the real true meaning. So, I want to
[17:54] speak to you tonight on born to
[17:57] overcome. Can we just bow our heads? How
[17:59] many like to be remembered tonight as we
[18:01] as we pray? I'd certainly appreciate if
[18:03] you would remember me as well.
[18:07] Lord Jesus, as we bow our heads in your
[18:09] presence tonight, Father, I want to
[18:12] thank you, Lord, that each and every one
[18:14] of these young people that have come
[18:16] together tonight, I know their schedule
[18:19] is like the rest of us in this age that
[18:21] we're living. They've got all kinds of
[18:23] things going on in their life, and it's
[18:25] it's a very busy time for us. But I'm so
[18:29] thankful that they took time and set
[18:32] this time apart even after having
[18:34] service yesterday. and then they would
[18:36] want to come back again tonight, Lord,
[18:38] to be able to meet together like this
[18:41] and see what you would speak to us. I
[18:43] pray that you'd help me to get out of
[18:45] the way, Father, that I can be able to
[18:48] speak what you've placed upon my heart
[18:50] today. Dear God, I believe that you know
[18:53] exactly what we need. And I am asking
[18:56] you that you'd help each of us that we
[18:58] can pull on the gift of God and receive
[19:01] what we have need of in the name of the
[19:03] Lord Jesus. Amen. God bless you. Thank
[19:06] you for coming tonight. You may be
[19:08] seated. I know you're all so busy and
[19:09] you got so much going on in your life
[19:11] and all of that, but I want to thank you
[19:13] for taking time to be able to to us for
[19:17] us to assemble together like this. I'd
[19:19] like to read to you for just a little
[19:20] bit to get a foundation on this tonight
[19:22] from the message that Brother Brandon
[19:24] preached and he entitled it, How Can I
[19:27] Overcome? Now, I watch not only just
[19:29] what he says and the content of the
[19:31] message whenever he preaches these
[19:33] messages, but I like to look at the
[19:35] title itself because to me, there's
[19:38] volumes within the title and just
[19:40] sometimes the very first preface of a
[19:42] paragraph or two or a page or two and
[19:44] you'll get so much of the direction of
[19:46] what he's going to go. Now a lot of
[19:48] people would think about overcoming and
[19:51] they would go more toward of not just
[19:54] how but what
[19:57] can I overcome or what do I need to
[20:00] overcome this and then do I apply the
[20:02] same principle to that and that and that
[20:05] or do I apply a different principle to a
[20:09] different thing that I'm want to
[20:10] overcome. Now, I'm going to be honest
[20:12] with you tonight as your pastor. I
[20:14] cannot imagine uh all the things that
[20:17] you all in your generation, what you go
[20:20] through and what you face. And I know
[20:22] what I went through as a young person,
[20:24] and you've heard me tell a little bit
[20:26] about the things that I went through as
[20:27] a Christian going to school and all of
[20:30] that, but all that would be so minor in
[20:33] comparison to what you go through in
[20:35] this day and age. But if we do not
[20:38] believe that our Lord Jesus has the same
[20:40] ability and power to help you overcome
[20:44] in your generation as he did brother Rob
[20:46] and his generation, Brother Joe, me and
[20:49] then Brother Daryl and an older
[20:50] generation, then how could we ever serve
[20:53] a God that would lose his power because
[20:56] evil would get more evil and more
[20:58] drastic and that Satan's devices would
[21:01] become more cunning. And we know that
[21:04] he's he's very sharp at what he does. So
[21:07] he's been laying these traps for many
[21:09] many millennia now. And he's got so many
[21:13] many people down through the ages. And
[21:15] so you'd think that the question would
[21:17] be and the prophet addresses it this way
[21:19] in the church age book that people would
[21:21] think that the question would be what
[21:24] can I overcome? But he said actually the
[21:26] question is how do we overcome? Then if
[21:30] we can learn how to overcome, then the
[21:33] principle should apply apply that no
[21:36] matter what it would be that you're
[21:38] facing. So if I would stop right here
[21:40] now and I would begin here with brother
[21:42] Joe and we go down up and down each one
[21:44] of these rows and we would ask each one
[21:46] of you, so what do you deal with in
[21:49] life? Well, it probably depend on what
[21:50] day of the week it is, right? And if
[21:53] it's Monday, it's always worse. you
[21:54] know, if your Mondays like my Mondays
[21:56] and it would be different according to
[21:57] this and that and the other, the mood,
[21:59] the humor you're in. And Satan knows how
[22:02] to to fit exactly the temptation and
[22:05] what he's wanting to bother us with
[22:07] according to our frame of mind and what
[22:09] we're going through. There's certain
[22:11] things naturally that we all gravitate
[22:14] toward because of our human makeup, but
[22:16] he doesn't always use those. Sometimes
[22:19] just spring a new one on us, something
[22:21] that we never even thought about before.
[22:23] So he knows exactly what he's doing, but
[22:26] that's only one side of the battle. So
[22:29] does our God also know what he's doing.
[22:32] And as a matter of fact, he knows
[22:33] exactly what to give us to help us
[22:36] overcome. So I I imagine that every one
[22:39] of you tonight, wouldn't that be one of
[22:41] the greatest desires that you would have
[22:43] as young people, as Christians who are
[22:45] interested in the kingdom of God, in
[22:47] serving the Lord? Could I see the
[22:49] uplifting of your hand to be able to
[22:51] overcome? So whether you're a teenager
[22:54] in your 20s like brother Rob of course
[22:56] younger than I, brother Joe younger than
[22:58] I, brother Daryl we're closer to age. So
[23:01] here we are up in our 60s but still the
[23:04] question would be the same. Would it be
[23:06] your greatest desire, brother Donnie? It
[23:08] would be. So if that would be one of my
[23:10] greatest desires to be able to overcome,
[23:13] what would be one of my greatest
[23:15] disappointments in this life as a
[23:18] Christian? It would be to feel like that
[23:21] I have failed him in not overcoming. Is
[23:24] that yours?
[23:25] &gt;&gt; So Satan knows exactly what to do and
[23:29] how to lay the trap and ensnare us and
[23:31] get us into something. And and really to
[23:34] be honest, one of the things that it
[23:36] gets us in is things that reoccur over
[23:38] and over again. So that's why Paul wrote
[23:40] in the book of Hebrews and said, "Let us
[23:42] lay aside every weight and every sin
[23:45] which does so easily beset us." Now look
[23:48] at that word easily. So it shows us then
[23:51] that there would be certain things that
[23:53] Satan would put in front of us and we
[23:55] are more easily successful than those
[23:58] things than we would be other things.
[24:01] So, if we've got an emergency here
[24:02] tonight, God forbid that we would. So,
[24:04] we've got several exit doors. They're
[24:07] all lit up by red signs. So, there's one
[24:10] there, there, there, there, there. Uh
[24:12] there's one here, but we don't have a
[24:14] sign there. That's mainly for me. So,
[24:16] we've got several access doors. Now, I
[24:18] want you to look back here at this this
[24:20] door, and you can see how thick that
[24:23] wall is. Everybody take a look. Turn
[24:25] your head that way. Now, we've got a
[24:26] metal shell on the outside of this
[24:29] building. But now, I wanted this wall
[24:32] right here super super quiet. So, they
[24:35] come in here and they sprayed my entire
[24:37] study with spray foam. Once I realized
[24:41] how quiet that made my office, I wanted
[24:44] them to spray this entire wall with
[24:47] spray foam. Now, that wall, as you can
[24:50] look and see, probably 18 in thick. So
[24:53] if we had an emergency, we would all be
[24:56] out of our minds to try to tear holes
[25:00] through that wall and go through that
[25:02] all that solid foam and try to tear out
[25:05] on the outside of the metal when there's
[25:08] an emergency exit. Another one, another
[25:10] one, another one, and another one. And
[25:13] it's exactly the way that Satan tries to
[25:16] tackle us. Because all of us have strong
[25:19] points in our life and all of us have
[25:22] weak points. The weak points in our life
[25:25] are sort of like the exit signs and the
[25:28] entrance signs to demon powers. So why
[25:32] would they waste their time on your
[25:35] solid wall that's so strong? Now it cost
[25:39] an extra $5,000
[25:41] to spray that wall right there. But you
[25:43] know what? The way I looked at it, it
[25:46] was a $5,000 that was well spent. And I
[25:50] believe it was because the traffic going
[25:52] up and down that road. And there's
[25:54] points in your life that's just like
[25:56] that wall. And Satan would try to come
[25:59] against you with certain things and
[26:00] you'd say, "Are you kidding me, devil?
[26:02] Come on. Surely you got one better than
[26:04] that." Well, you know what? He's not
[26:06] going to waste his time on those things
[26:08] anyway. But all of us have these weak
[26:11] spots. Now, I've I've traveled by the
[26:14] grace of God and been privileged to
[26:15] travel in different parts of the world
[26:17] and I've seen the the old city of
[26:20] Jerusalem and a few years ago we was
[26:22] able to go into France and go into
[26:24] Switzerland. Carol was out there was
[26:26] there again in Easter of this year and
[26:28] we were able to go to some old castles
[26:31] that were built back in the medieval
[26:33] times and they're still standing there
[26:35] for you to be able to tour and visit. So
[26:37] the some of their walls we actually had
[26:40] had lunch up in a turret and the windows
[26:42] was about this wide maybe and it was
[26:44] octagon shaped like this original you
[26:46] know original built probably in the
[26:48] 1400s something like that and they were
[26:51] there some of the original stone the
[26:53] original uh things that was there and
[26:56] yet the the enemy would never try to
[26:59] tear through those walls cuz some of
[27:01] them were three foot thick three foot
[27:04] thick and they would have one massive
[27:07] stone right on top of the other. But you
[27:09] know where the most vulnerable place was
[27:12] in those castles? The gates. So in time
[27:16] they would try to modify their gates and
[27:19] Jerusalem's gates now believe it or not.
[27:21] But they still drive cars, real tiny
[27:25] tiny cars through the gates of Jerusalem
[27:28] that were rebuilt hundreds and hundreds
[27:31] of years ago. Now, the walls were told
[27:33] down, but under the one of the Arab
[27:35] sultans, they rebuilt the wall and they
[27:38] use the stones that was in the original
[27:40] building. So, they've got real tiny
[27:42] gates. So, one comes in like this and
[27:45] then it's got a sharp sharp turn that
[27:48] goes like this. So, with a little tiny
[27:50] car, you can actually come through and
[27:53] back up and go forward and back up and
[27:55] go forward and back up and go forward
[27:57] and you can pull a car through that tiny
[28:00] gate. Ain't that right, Carol? So we saw
[28:02] that now because the gates was the most
[28:05] vulnerable parts. What they would do,
[28:08] they would cut a slot right in the top,
[28:11] right above where you'd come in the
[28:13] gate. Now that was for hot boiling oil.
[28:19] Cuz if you got through the first gate,
[28:22] it meant there was another wooden gate
[28:24] there as well. So they figured by the
[28:27] time you were delayed getting through
[28:30] this gate, you're going to be standing
[28:32] right in a good scorching zone. So
[28:35] they're going to have hot oil ready and
[28:38] they're going to fry you like a piece of
[28:40] chicken.
[28:41] Now why? Because their gates was the
[28:45] most vulnerable parts. Now they would
[28:48] try to make ramp parts and they would
[28:50] try to make different things, but you
[28:52] know what? They'd build a ladder and
[28:54] they'd have great big strong guys and
[28:56] them strong guys' wait till you got
[28:58] nearly to the top and they'd get the
[29:00] ladder full then they would push the
[29:02] ladder over and there went that plan. So
[29:06] they realized and every time they would
[29:09] do it then they would learn something by
[29:11] the weakness of the gate and they would
[29:14] try to strengthen that gate and they
[29:17] would remodify constantly redoing. Why?
[29:20] because that was their most vulnerable
[29:23] parts and they were trying to overcome.
[29:25] Now the next time they would attack the
[29:27] same city. You know Jerusalem has been
[29:30] captured over 40 times. 40 times
[29:35] of all the cities in the world. It's
[29:38] been captured more than any of them.
[29:41] Why? It's a sought out prize. Well, let
[29:45] me tell you something, young people. You
[29:47] are more of a prize than Jerusalem or
[29:50] Paris or Los Angeles or Washington DC.
[29:54] The demons out of hell, they want you.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; And one way you ought to be honored
[30:01] because they've already got the majority
[30:04] of the youth of this age. But which one
[30:07] would have the most trophy value? One of
[30:11] you or one that doesn't really even
[30:14] believe the word? don't even believe in
[30:16] God, son of Or if they go to a church
[30:18] and not really taught the power of God,
[30:20] would that really be a trophy that the
[30:22] devil would want on his wall like one of
[30:24] you? Oh, no. No, he would not. You see,
[30:27] he wants to get preachers in
[30:28] denominations. He wants to get preachers
[30:31] in systems and all that. But which do
[30:33] you think would be the most valuable to
[30:36] the devil? Brother Daryl or a
[30:39] denominational preacher that don't even
[30:42] believe that he's the same yesterday,
[30:43] today, and forever.
[30:47] Which would be the most value to Satan?
[30:50] One of our young brothers here or one of
[30:53] these young men out here that's already
[30:55] smoking dope and shooting their veins
[30:57] full of this and that and the other to
[30:59] try to find a piece that they'll never
[31:01] find in a needle.
[31:04] You know that yourself.
[31:06] So what do we do then? I want you to
[31:09] listen to this and how can I overcome?
[31:11] And brother Brandon was quite a simple
[31:13] man, but God dealt with him in this
[31:15] simplicity. He was down in Kentucky
[31:18] hunting with brother Charlie Cox. Now
[31:20] this was August the 25th when he
[31:23] preaches this. So squirrel season had
[31:25] begun early August. So he said, "I was
[31:29] crossing an old log the other day down a
[31:32] wash what is called a hollow and I
[31:35] jumped up on this log and on the outside
[31:38] it looked good like a a big old beach
[31:41] log." Anybody know what a beach tree is?
[31:43] What it looks like, Brother Paul? All
[31:45] right. Now, beach is a very hard wood,
[31:49] but beach doesn't have pretty grain.
[31:53] It's very straight grains, not very
[31:56] pretty. It's not used for furniture like
[31:58] walnut, hickory, red oak, you know,
[32:02] white oak. It's just not a very pretty
[32:05] wood, excuse me, at all. But what they
[32:07] do is they will take beach and make
[32:11] different things to turn out of it. So
[32:14] they will make spindles and different
[32:16] things, something like this, so that the
[32:19] grain is not very important anyway. And
[32:22] then they found that they can take beach
[32:25] and take a 32th of an inch out of a
[32:29] piece of walnut veneer. Now this is
[32:31] solid walnut. But they will take walnut
[32:34] and slice it like this into a 32nth of
[32:38] an inch. Some even go 164 of an inch.
[32:42] And they will take and lay that over the
[32:44] top of beach. Now, that gives it a real
[32:48] hard core, but it gives it a very, very
[32:52] shallow, beautiful surface.
[32:56] And a little tiny knife from a child or
[33:00] a little ding on that can make that
[33:03] veneer damaged permanently. Why? Because
[33:08] the outer shell is so thin.
[33:12] I don't want to be that kind of
[33:14] Christian. Do any of you all want to be
[33:15] that kind of Christian? I don't want to
[33:17] be a veneer Christian. I want to be a
[33:21] real one from the heart out. So, I want
[33:24] to be able to endure hardships and
[33:26] troubles and difficulties. I want you to
[33:29] notice because these words are are
[33:31] important in the way that he's going to
[33:33] lay this out about how can I overcome.
[33:36] So, I jumped up on the log on the
[33:38] outside. It looked good like a big old
[33:40] beach log. And when I jumped on it, a
[33:44] great chunk of it fell off. It was real
[33:48] rotten and dirty. And I said, "That's
[33:52] the way Christians are becoming. They've
[33:56] been dead in sin and trespasses so long
[33:59] till they become dirty. They can hold no
[34:03] weight at all. They don't know what the
[34:06] overcoming means." And I begin to think
[34:10] of this text. then overcome keep life in
[34:15] you. Now what I find amazing about this
[34:18] beach tree was that no doubt that beach
[34:21] tree must have stood there for many
[34:23] years. Most hardwoods are kind of slow
[34:25] growing. So it may have had 30 40 rings
[34:29] around that tree where it stood there
[34:31] for 30 years. Apparently the taproots,
[34:35] some which go down, some which spread
[34:36] out, must have been near where this
[34:39] branch of water was. So since a little
[34:43] sapling and it took roots in this good
[34:47] fertile soil and it had this taproot
[34:50] which reached toward the water and it
[34:52] was drinking and drinking and growing
[34:55] and growing. Now apparently the prophet
[34:58] didn't know exactly what it was, whether
[35:00] it was a disease. Could it have been a
[35:03] parasite? Could it have been a bug of
[35:05] something that come through? He didn't
[35:07] know exactly what it was, but the log
[35:10] was laying there. Could it been that a
[35:12] that a logger came through and cut part
[35:15] of it out and took the best part of it
[35:18] and left part of it laying? He didn't
[35:19] really know. All he knew was that he
[35:22] jumped up on that big thing. And when he
[35:24] did, a big chunk of that log fell off.
[35:29] Now, what it was supposed to been for
[35:32] was support to give him the ability to
[35:35] move across that beach log to go from
[35:38] point A to point B. Now, looking at it,
[35:42] he thought, "Oh, it'll be fine. I've
[35:44] done that many times myself and then
[35:46] hunting and things and you jump up on
[35:48] something to take you across a branch of
[35:50] water or creek or something that way."
[35:52] And yet, you don't know many times if
[35:55] it's rotten or whatever's on the inside.
[35:57] So when he stepped up and when he did
[35:59] and he put his weight on it, there it
[36:02] went. Now you know we find that same
[36:05] thing in and around our message. We find
[36:08] it in other Christian churches and
[36:11] people that you think are people that
[36:13] can really help you and you can, you
[36:15] know, you can put confidence and
[36:17] strength and they'll be they'll be real
[36:19] stable Christians. And then when you
[36:22] think you really need them and you go to
[36:24] them and you find out they're having a
[36:26] harder time than you are
[36:28] &gt;&gt; and then you think, "Oh my goodness, if
[36:31] they're having a hard time, how in the
[36:33] world can I ever do it?" Well, let me
[36:34] just give you a little bit of advice
[36:36] tonight. Don't look at any man, any
[36:38] woman, any boy and girl and think that
[36:42] they themselves are strong within
[36:46] themsel because every one of us,
[36:49] including our pastor, including every
[36:51] minister in the church, our youth
[36:53] leaders, including our prophet, we're
[36:56] all human beings and we all have to
[36:58] overcome things in our life. Is that
[37:01] right? As I said yesterday, every one of
[37:04] you Christians here tonight, you've got
[37:06] this spiritual sign on you. I am still
[37:09] under construction, but I'm glad I'm
[37:11] still under construction. Now, I want
[37:13] you to notice he says, "Overcome, keep
[37:16] life in you." So, when the life went
[37:18] out, that's what brought that log to
[37:21] that condition. And it made it worse
[37:24] than ever when it laid in the branch
[37:28] where the water was. Now, this thing had
[37:30] no doubt lived on the supply of this
[37:33] water for years and drunk in and drunk
[37:36] in and it got bigger and bigger and
[37:38] massive. My those beach trees in
[37:41] Kentucky and there's big ones there in
[37:43] East Tennessee, too. I've seen them.
[37:44] They can become so massive you cannot
[37:48] reach your arms around them. Mighty
[37:51] winds will come through and blow and
[37:54] blow and them things will stand there.
[37:56] all they can endure such violent storms.
[37:59] It's incredible. I've been out hunting
[38:01] before and get caught in storms and and
[38:03] actually stand underneath the beach tree
[38:06] because other little dog woods will be
[38:08] falling pines will be snapping off, but
[38:10] a beach tree, I mean, you can just about
[38:13] bet on it. It's going to be there. But
[38:15] something had happened to the beach.
[38:18] Now, notice how how he he types this
[38:20] about Christians and their lives. So
[38:23] something had happened and the beach had
[38:25] died. Something the life, what was it?
[38:28] The life had gone out. So apparently
[38:30] part of the bark was still there. More
[38:32] than likely, brother Brandon would never
[38:34] have jumped up on that tree, brother
[38:36] Daryl, if it would have been like some
[38:38] of the trees you and I have seen. And
[38:40] you could see visibly that it was
[38:42] rotten. You see, but it was rotten from
[38:46] the inside. But it looked like, well,
[38:49] he's a hunter. He he was he was a great
[38:51] sportsman in the woods. No sportsman is
[38:54] going to climb up on that thing thinking
[38:56] it's it can support you whenever you
[38:58] know by looking at it this thing is
[39:00] rotten and it might fall with me and I'd
[39:03] break a leg. What am I going to do out
[39:04] here by myself? So it must have looked
[39:07] like that you know it was down but it
[39:10] was not rotten. When did he find out it
[39:13] was rotten? weight pressure that
[39:16] revealed it and it made it worse than
[39:19] ever when it laid in the branch where
[39:21] the water was. So now what what was it
[39:24] then? It wasn't water alone, the spirit
[39:27] as we'd liken the water to. It wasn't
[39:30] just the tree being around water spirit
[39:33] that made it grow. But it was actually
[39:37] life in the tree. Life in the tree. Now,
[39:41] it tapped into the water and as long as
[39:45] life was there, then the water would
[39:47] make it grow and strong and put out
[39:50] leaves and it go through the cycles of
[39:53] life and it would stand there and
[39:54] endured many a season, no doubt. But
[39:58] once the life left it, then what
[40:01] happens? The same water that made it
[40:04] grow turned it into a dirty mess.
[40:10] Oh, how sad.
[40:14] How sad.
[40:16] And it made it worse than ever when it
[40:18] laid in the branch where the water was
[40:20] was. Then there you take a Christian
[40:24] that's supposed to be a Christian, let
[40:27] the life of God go from him and the
[40:30] experience, the joy of serving Christ.
[40:35] How many has to battle that in the day
[40:37] we're living? You can be honest. I'm
[40:39] going to have put my hands up so I can
[40:41] encourage you to. I deal with so much
[40:43] sadness, friends. I deal with so much
[40:46] death. I deal with so many hospital
[40:50] visits and psychiatric visits and one
[40:53] thing after another. Sad news, terrible
[40:56] news, divorce, separation, all kinds of
[41:00] things. I have to fight to keep my joy.
[41:04] It's not that I don't have joy in Jesus.
[41:07] I do. But the weight that I bear as a
[41:11] servant of God, just in having this
[41:13] church, the size of our church and the
[41:16] hundreds of people here that call me
[41:18] their pastor, that within itself weighs
[41:21] so heavy on me. But because we have
[41:23] streamers around the world that don't
[41:25] have a church to go to and they look to
[41:28] me as their pastors and you know what,
[41:29] they get in trouble, they want a phone
[41:31] call, they want a text, they want an
[41:33] email, they want this, that, the other.
[41:35] and I try my best to try to help them if
[41:38] I can. And then you've got all of that
[41:40] that goes on, then all of this that goes
[41:43] on around the world. And we see that.
[41:45] But it takes the spirit of God to help
[41:47] us to realize that we can become so
[41:50] burdened with our work, we let the devil
[41:54] rob us of our personal walk with God
[41:57] itself. Anybody knows what I'm talking
[42:00] about?
[42:01] But you know who's the only one that can
[42:03] stop that? Now you may hear that tonight
[42:06] and you say, "Oh my goodness, I'm going
[42:08] to pray for brother Donnie Moore." Well,
[42:10] I hope you do. I thank you for that if
[42:13] you do. But you within yourself cannot
[42:16] put a stop to that. My wife Carol, oh,
[42:19] what a what a great queen I have from
[42:22] the Lord there to help me and lift me up
[42:25] and pick me up. Everything that she can
[42:27] do, she does it. But she cannot be able
[42:31] to turn that corner in my life to where
[42:34] I draw the line and say, "Now wait a
[42:36] minute, devil, you have trespassed. You
[42:39] have trespassed." You understand that?
[42:42] For preachers, especially in the age now
[42:44] that we're living, they can be so
[42:46] consumed with their own work and the
[42:49] burden of the work. I mentioned to you
[42:51] Moses yesterday. Moses got so caught up
[42:54] in his work with the people that Moses
[42:58] himself didn't even circumcise his own
[43:00] son. Now, can you imagine the work was
[43:03] so great and so large that he left off a
[43:07] part of his own personal commitment to
[43:10] God and his commitment to his family
[43:14] because of the great work. Was that
[43:16] pleasing to the Lord? No way. I could be
[43:19] so worried about you all and study
[43:22] constantly for you all and pray
[43:24] constantly for you all and be labored
[43:27] for people in Tanzania and Zimbabwe and
[43:30] Kenya and in Iceland and in Africa and
[43:32] in Greenland and all over everywhere
[43:35] else and be absolutely so sad and so low
[43:40] in my own life with God. And what good
[43:42] am I to anybody when I get that way?
[43:47] So what good are you
[43:50] &gt;&gt; if you get that way? Now watch what he
[43:53] says. Oh my. And the joy of serving
[43:57] Christ and living in a church where such
[44:02] is going on. Now watch. He's describing
[44:05] a beach tree Christian.
[44:10] So the life, the joy, the experience,
[44:13] the joy of just coming to church, the
[44:17] joy of oh my singing, clapping your
[44:19] hands, worshiping the Lord, the joy of
[44:22] being able to come to a youth service on
[44:24] Monday night. Praise God. We get to have
[44:27] church again. Thank the Lord. We get to
[44:29] go to hell. We're going to have good
[44:31] food. We're going to have a good time
[44:33] with the rest of brothers and sister.
[44:34] We're going to have question answers, or
[44:36] so you thought. and we're going to have
[44:38] a few songs and brother Paul's going to
[44:39] sing and the brothers are going to Oh,
[44:41] it's going to be so good.
[44:44] Or do you just come in and say, "Okay,
[44:45] well, I'm going to go. Mom will get on
[44:47] me if I don't go. Brother Donnie will
[44:49] probably call the deacons and they'll
[44:50] get on me if I don't go." No, that what
[44:53] God wants it to be. God wants it to be
[44:55] joy. Oh, hallelujah. Joy unspeakable.
[44:59] Now, listen. What happens then to a
[45:01] person though that doesn't have that
[45:03] life in there? The joy of serving Christ
[45:05] living in a church where such is going
[45:08] on, he rottens
[45:12] twice as quick.
[45:15] Do you understand? In the environment
[45:17] that the Lord Jesus has given us at our
[45:20] church, there's life, there's healing,
[45:23] there's miracles, they're supernatural.
[45:26] But here's the dangerous part about our
[45:28] church. People who don't have life in
[45:31] them and don't keep the joy of the Lord
[45:34] going in their heart, they will rotten
[45:37] twice as quick as a Baptist,
[45:42] a Methodist,
[45:43] a Presbyterian.
[45:46] Why? They might get a drop every now and
[45:49] then, but you get river service after
[45:53] service. Young people, you all have seen
[45:57] so many miracles in your life. Did you
[46:02] hear the testimony about Sister Phoebe's
[46:04] brother who had that limp mode and took
[46:06] the prayer cloth and put on him and the
[46:08] doctor went to do the surgery on him?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; No surgery needed. That's only a small
[46:14] thing compared to the things that you
[46:16] have heard and seen in your lifetime. Do
[46:20] you understand? There's people that live
[46:22] in this area right here that's 75, 80,
[46:25] 85 years old and have never seen one
[46:28] miracle in their life. And you have seen
[46:32] one after another after another. You're
[46:35] blessed, young people. You're blessed to
[46:38] see the mighty hand of God. Can you say
[46:41] amen to that? But it's our
[46:43] responsibility then to overcome. Now
[46:46] you, oh, brother Donnie, why why do we
[46:48] feel that death? Well, they asked the
[46:50] prophet the question and question answer
[46:52] 64. You know, brother Brandon, why can't
[46:54] we pray and and have revival? He said,
[46:57] "Well, brother, sister, the reason is is
[46:59] because the revival is over." Now,
[47:02] remember, that does not mean that we
[47:04] just come to church and just hang out,
[47:06] you know, just barely endure. But the
[47:09] point is, revival for the world is over.
[47:14] Revival for our nation is over. That
[47:17] don't mean our church can't have
[47:19] revival. And that don't mean that you as
[47:21] an individual can't have revival. And
[47:24] that don't mean that your family can't
[47:26] have revival. As a matter of fact, a
[47:28] revival might start in this church by
[47:30] Levi and then it gets a hold of his mama
[47:33] and gets a hold of his sister and gets a
[47:34] hold of his daddy and then he they're so
[47:37] set on fire. Then they go to talking to
[47:39] this one and that one and that one. Oh,
[47:40] you say, "Well, won't it come from the
[47:42] pastor?" Who says it has to come from
[47:44] the pastor? It might come from one of
[47:46] you sisters. It might come from one of
[47:48] you brothers. But I'll tell you the way
[47:50] I feel about it. I want to be on fire
[47:53] for God. I want revival to be inside of
[47:55] me. I ain't going to be no rotten beach
[47:58] tree because I never know who's going to
[48:00] call me at 3:00 in the morning and
[48:03] they're in a car wreck. I never know
[48:05] when I'm going to get a phone call and
[48:07] they're old brother Donnie, my husband's
[48:09] in the hospital in the ER and he's had a
[48:11] heart attack. Believe me, I've been
[48:13] there before. I've walked into the ER
[48:16] and catch one of our brothers in the
[48:18] middle of a heart attack, lay hands on
[48:20] him by the grace of God, and watch God
[48:23] Almighty stop that heart attack and
[48:26] catch the doctor so by surprise they
[48:28] didn't know what to do. That's the God
[48:30] I'm talking about. I don't want to get
[48:32] dirty. I mean, knows what I'm saying.
[48:34] So, you see, as the people of God, we've
[48:37] got to overcome. And don't think because
[48:40] you're battling that there's something
[48:42] wrong with you. That's a great sign that
[48:45] the devil hasn't got you. Are you going
[48:47] to fall flat? Sometimes you are. But my
[48:50] question to you is this. What you going
[48:52] to do when you fall flat? You going to
[48:55] lay there and wallow in self-pity and
[48:57] say, "Poor little me, poor little that."
[48:59] Or are you going to get up and wipe your
[49:01] clothes off and wipe your face off and
[49:03] straighten out your clothes and say,
[49:05] "Devil, you got me down, but you ain't
[49:07] going to keep me down by the grace of
[49:09] God. I'm going to learn by this mistake.
[49:12] When I fall fat on my face, I don't want
[49:14] to just get up and say, "Well, forgive
[49:16] me, Lord, but I'm going to go back and
[49:18] say, "How did I let that happen to me?
[49:21] By the grace of God, I don't want to
[49:23] happen again."
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; And the young people said,
[49:27] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Notice he rottens twice as
[49:30] quick, right? Living right under. So,
[49:33] we're trying to follow the message of
[49:35] the hour or at least this part of the
[49:38] message. We should live constantly in
[49:42] the life of Christ. See, cuz if you
[49:45] don't, you lay around and you know that
[49:48] these things you're supposed to do and
[49:50] you don't do it. He's he that knoweth to
[49:52] do good. Now, this is where we'll get in
[49:54] trouble. He that knoweth to do good and
[49:57] doeth it not to him at sin. Then you
[49:59] become dirty, rotten when you're
[50:02] separated from the life of God. So
[50:05] strive with all that's in you to stay in
[50:09] the life of Christ that you be
[50:12] fruitbearing.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Anybody here ever failed and you feel so
[50:17] ashamed going toward God
[50:20] you don't feel like you can even pray
[50:23] and you just feel like getting in his
[50:25] presence that you feel so embarrassed
[50:29] and so ashamed
[50:31] because you fell short of the glory of
[50:33] God.
[50:34] Why do we do that? Because heaven has
[50:38] touched our lives. Heaven has touched
[50:42] our souls and made us conscience of his
[50:45] presence. And for us to feel like that
[50:48] we're failing him and falling short of
[50:50] his glory, oh my, it's one of the
[50:53] heaviest burdens that a child of God can
[50:56] labor against is that feeling like that
[50:58] we're falling short of the glory of God.
[51:01] But we must learn and trust God to help
[51:04] us to give us the strength and the power
[51:08] no matter what you're facing. Now, if
[51:10] I'd start with brother Joe tonight and
[51:12] we'll start across the front and then
[51:13] we'll start all the way back through
[51:14] there and then each of you would stand
[51:16] your opportunity would be well this
[51:18] bothers me and that bothers me. Well, I
[51:21] figure by the time we start with brother
[51:22] Joe, the church would be empty because
[51:24] everybody else would be done gone.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; It'd be a bathroom pit stop, wouldn't
[51:28] it? Everybody's gone to the bathroom at
[51:30] one time and then they got to go get a
[51:32] drink of water and then they need a
[51:33] little sugar cuz they got to have a
[51:34] dessert and they got to have a drink of
[51:36] water and then I just go ahead and
[51:37] dismiss cuz I figure y'all wasn't coming
[51:39] back. Because most of us would not want
[51:42] most everybody to know the things we go
[51:46] through. Why? Because we have a stigma
[51:49] about Christianity. And I find it so
[51:52] difficult around the message of the hour
[51:54] that people want to think as if though
[51:56] oh I'd never let nobody know that I'm a
[51:58] human. Really? We know you are anyway.
[52:01] We know you are. Whether or not you tell
[52:03] us you stink like we do. Your breath
[52:06] sinks just like mine does. And you get
[52:07] up morning and if you don't take a
[52:10] shower, you know, especially in this hot
[52:11] weather, your old body's going to stink.
[52:13] Come on, somebody. You're human like we
[52:16] are, you're going to fall short of the
[52:17] glory of God. Every one of us in this
[52:20] building, including the man preaching to
[52:22] you, needs the grace of God, the mercy
[52:24] of God, the peace of God, the strength
[52:26] of God. Without it, I would be afraid to
[52:29] walk out that door and live another day,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; sir. Amen.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, but brother Donnie, yeah, but you're
[52:34] the preacher. Why you don't make no
[52:36] mistakes? Oh, yes, I do. I'm a human
[52:38] just like you are. And does, Brother
[52:40] Joe, you still make mistakes, brother?
[52:42] Really, Brother Rob? Oh, no. Brother
[52:44] Daryl, not you. No, no, no. Brother
[52:47] Daryl, don't tell me. Look at him. He's
[52:49] back there shaking his head. Even
[52:51] brother Daryl still makes mistake. I
[52:53] tell what you do. Go home and ask your
[52:55] mom and dad tonight after church if they
[52:57] do.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[52:59] On second thought, maybe that one. Of
[53:02] course they do. Why? Because we're
[53:05] humans. Our humanization does not take
[53:09] away from what God has done in our soul.
[53:12] But he wants us to be overcomers in this
[53:16] age. This is who he's coming for. Oh,
[53:18] you know, in every age, John wrote to a
[53:21] certain group in every church age. The
[53:24] name of the church age was different.
[53:26] The reward was different. The battle was
[53:28] a little different, but there was one
[53:30] word which was a common thread through
[53:33] the entirety of over 2,000 years, and
[53:36] that was this word, blessed is he that
[53:39] overcomes.
[53:41] There was one thing, brother Jonathan,
[53:43] they had in common, and that was to be
[53:46] an overcomer. You know who's going in
[53:48] the resurrection? Overcomers. You know
[53:50] who's going in the rapture alive?
[53:52] Overcomers. You know who's going to be
[53:55] granted to sit with him on his throne?
[53:57] Overcomers. Had nothing to do with rich,
[53:59] fat, pretty, ugly, skinny. Has nothing
[54:02] to do with any of that. Sing like a
[54:04] mocking bird or can't carry a tune in a
[54:06] fivegallon lord bucket. But there's one
[54:09] thing every one of them have in common.
[54:11] Every one of them, hallelujah, is
[54:13] overcomers. Men, women, boys, girls,
[54:16] black, white, red, yellow, there's
[54:18] something every one of them's got in
[54:20] common. And I'd like the devil to know
[54:22] tonight that out of word of life church,
[54:26] there's not only going to be 70 year old
[54:28] overcomers and 80year-old overcomers.
[54:31] There's going to be boys in their teens.
[54:34] There's going to be girls in their teens
[54:36] and in their 20s and in their 30s. I
[54:38] want the devil to know tonight that we
[54:41] have got his number and we're not
[54:44] meeting him on our own. We're meeting
[54:46] him in the power of our resurrected Lord
[54:49] Jesus. We've got brothers in our church
[54:52] that's going to overcome pornography.
[54:54] They're going to put it under their
[54:56] feet. We've got sisters that's going to
[54:58] overcome pride and arrogance and
[55:00] whatever more. Whatever Satan throws at
[55:03] you by the grace of God, our father is
[55:06] greater than them all. If he could
[55:08] overcome death, if he could overcome
[55:11] hell, if he could overcome the grave,
[55:13] what is you and I and our trouble that
[55:16] he can't overcome?
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel that preaching. Thank
[55:20] you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[55:27] Oh my. You know, anytime we look at
[55:30] something like this, it's always the law
[55:33] of contrast. And preaching is built on
[55:37] this this contrast. So there'll be
[55:40] positive examples that you'll use and
[55:43] many times there'll be negative ones
[55:45] that you will use. And the prophet did
[55:48] this in the sermon, how can overcome?
[55:51] and he refers to Lot's wife.
[55:54] Even Jesus himself in Luke 17
[55:58] said, "Remember Lot's wife." Which is
[56:02] absolutely phenomenal to me because he
[56:04] never did say, "Remember Sarah
[56:07] or remember Rebecca or remember Deborah,
[56:10] which was Rebecca's nurse, which is a
[56:12] great notable woman, or remember this
[56:15] woman or that woman or remember Ruth, or
[56:18] remember Esther?" Why would Jesus say
[56:22] remember Lot's wife? And it's within the
[56:26] proximity of just a couple of verses of
[56:29] when he gives one of the great prophetic
[56:31] scriptures of the end time, the coming
[56:33] of the son of man.
[56:37] So he tells people in that age of the
[56:41] revealing of the son of man. Remember
[56:44] Lot's wife? Why? She's going to type
[56:50] some of the people in this age. Oh,
[56:51] brother Donnie, that scares me. That
[56:53] scares me. Don't let it scare you.
[56:56] You've got to find your place somewhere
[56:58] in the word. Don't let fear make you a
[57:01] Lot's wife. Let faith make you an
[57:04] Abraham's wife,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; an Isaac's wife. You got to find
[57:08] yourself somewhere. All right.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Notice he says, "In the days of Lot,"
[57:12] Jesus referred to it, "and there were
[57:14] only three that overcome." Lot and his
[57:19] two daughters, not even his wife didn't
[57:21] overcome. She started out. She's
[57:25] a type. Wish we had time. My 30 minutes
[57:29] is up now. He said, "She done all right.
[57:33] She left." Now, I've got to give this to
[57:36] you just a moment. many of you has left
[57:38] too. Now remember, he's not preaching
[57:40] this in a denominational church. He's
[57:43] preaching this in his own church. So now
[57:46] watch him type some of the people that
[57:49] are sitting there around the message.
[57:53] Many of you has left too. Many of you
[57:58] has left these things to take your stand
[58:02] after you search through the scripture
[58:04] and find it's right.
[58:07] My goodness, you've seen the vindication
[58:09] of Almighty God. Now watch, he's
[58:11] addressing some of his congregants there
[58:14] and telling them what they've seen, what
[58:17] they've experienced. They've seen
[58:18] Almighty God. They've seen God do this
[58:20] and do that.
[58:22] And he said, not by what somebody said
[58:25] was a vindication, but what the Bible
[58:27] said would be here it is doing it. You
[58:29] saw it was the truth. So, you've set out
[58:33] to leave Sodom,
[58:37] leave the denomination, leave the things
[58:40] that bind you to a creed and to follow
[58:43] Christ by the Holy Spirit vindicating
[58:45] himself by the written word. Other
[58:47] words, you took the Bible instead of the
[58:50] creed. You've set out to follow. Well,
[58:55] Lot's wife
[58:59] did the same thing.
[59:03] Now, this is what is so frightening. Do
[59:06] you realize I've been here at the church
[59:08] now 37 years? I think, Carol, that's
[59:12] what it is.
[59:14] There's been enough people come through
[59:16] our church in that amount of time that
[59:20] if they were all still here, I ain't
[59:22] talking about people now that's passed
[59:23] and gone on or, you know, maybe relocate
[59:25] because of a job or something like that
[59:27] and still serving the Lord. I'm just
[59:29] talking about people that have come to
[59:30] God, backslid, got away from the Lord.
[59:34] We would have to have a church building
[59:36] probably one and a half times bigger
[59:38] than the one we've got.
[59:40] And they've see God move. Many of them
[59:43] be healed. Many of them be delivered.
[59:46] Many of them be touched by the power of
[59:48] God. I run into them from time to time.
[59:52] They look like, "Oh my goodness, you
[59:54] just can't imagine." act like the world,
[59:56] talk like the world.
[59:59] Yet, they left Sodom at one time and
[1:00:02] embraced this word and said, "Oh, what a
[1:00:04] message. What a church. This is exactly
[1:00:08] what I'm looking for."
[1:00:11] But I guess they found out it wasn't
[1:00:12] exactly what they was looking for.
[1:00:16] And so did Lot's wife.
[1:00:21] Now, he said, "She done all right. She
[1:00:23] left." Oh, yeah. She'd done all this
[1:00:25] stuff and I noticed he said, "Well,
[1:00:27] Lot's wife did the same thing. You know,
[1:00:29] she set out to go with Lot, follow her
[1:00:31] husband, her children, her loved ones."
[1:00:34] But it wasn't in her heart. She still
[1:00:36] loved the world. So, it's possible you
[1:00:40] can make a start and still be the world
[1:00:45] in you. See, she never overcome even
[1:00:50] though she was well on the road.
[1:00:54] Now you imagine angels of God
[1:00:59] walked into their home.
[1:01:02] Angels of God which come down from
[1:01:05] heaven walked into their home and took
[1:01:09] them literally by the hand. Angels from
[1:01:13] the presence of God
[1:01:16] and led them out of Sodom and gave them
[1:01:19] a simple simple command.
[1:01:22] Don't look back.
[1:01:25] Now, can you imagine nothing said about
[1:01:27] her hair, nothing about the length of
[1:01:30] her dress, nothing about all kinds of
[1:01:32] dos and don'ts and dos and don'ts and
[1:01:34] dos and don'ts. Only one little simple
[1:01:37] thing was given her not to do
[1:01:41] and she could not follow that through.
[1:01:45] Don't you look back.
[1:01:49] Now, we know
[1:01:52] that they had some
[1:01:55] family that was still left back there.
[1:01:57] As a matter of fact, the prophet said
[1:02:00] that she heard her grandchildren
[1:02:03] crying and screaming.
[1:02:07] So, you imagine they go out of Sodom and
[1:02:10] fire and brimstone comes down out of
[1:02:13] heaven. And this this land was a land of
[1:02:16] Bituman.
[1:02:18] Betuman.
[1:02:20] It's asphalt pitch tar t a r. So they
[1:02:25] had pits that they'd come and dig out
[1:02:29] through there. We stood there several
[1:02:30] years ago and there's a big rock there
[1:02:33] that they call Lot's wife, which looks
[1:02:35] like the shape and the image of a woman.
[1:02:41] So when the fire come down out of
[1:02:43] heaven, it would have been one explosion
[1:02:46] after another after another and one
[1:02:50] fireball hit the city and another and
[1:02:52] another and another. Oh, it must have
[1:02:55] got thousands of degrees hot.
[1:02:59] And Lot, the Bible said whenever he
[1:03:02] began to warn his sons-in-law,
[1:03:04] he becomes one that malt to them. Why?
[1:03:08] because he didn't have no testimony.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; He had followed the message formerly,
[1:03:15] but he had pulled away from the
[1:03:17] messenger
[1:03:19] and kind of went out on his own, you
[1:03:22] know, just to get away from the
[1:03:23] messenger.
[1:03:25] And he become the mayor. So he said at
[1:03:27] the gate, at the gate was where they
[1:03:29] done all the business, the transactions,
[1:03:31] deeds, titles, so on. So he becomes a
[1:03:34] man of esteem and no doubt his wife was
[1:03:37] a woman of esteem. She was looked up to
[1:03:39] and my she had such reproach to bear you
[1:03:42] know under the tent of Abraham and oh he
[1:03:44] he run things tight around his place.
[1:03:47] But there's one thing about it. They run
[1:03:48] it tight but they had the visit of
[1:03:50] Elohim. Give me that any day out of the
[1:03:52] week.
[1:03:54] But you imagine hearing your
[1:03:56] grandchildren or friends or someone that
[1:04:00] you knew and loved and you recognize
[1:04:03] their voice and the fires coming out of
[1:04:06] heaven and they scream and you simply
[1:04:10] turn your head.
[1:04:13] What was it?
[1:04:15] Sundown
[1:04:17] in Sodom.
[1:04:20] And when sundown came, it brought an
[1:04:22] angelic visitation in the evening time.
[1:04:26] But with the breaking of a new day, it
[1:04:29] was destruction.
[1:04:32] So she simply just turns back
[1:04:36] from behind him,
[1:04:39] her husband,
[1:04:41] and what happens to her?
[1:04:44] She gets a body change.
[1:04:48] So in the days of Sodom,
[1:04:52] people were getting body changes,
[1:04:56] not for a rapture,
[1:04:59] but out of the ordinary.
[1:05:01] H we see it all around us today, too,
[1:05:05] don't we, Sodom? Boys been changed into
[1:05:07] girls, girls being changed into boys,
[1:05:09] and you know, tattoos here and this and
[1:05:12] that and the other. What is it about the
[1:05:14] age that we're living that people are
[1:05:16] wanting to modify and change and do all
[1:05:20] this stuff to their bodies? What is it?
[1:05:24] God gave her a body change. All right.
[1:05:27] But it's one I don't want. Anybody here
[1:05:30] want a body change like that? I didn't
[1:05:32] think so.
[1:05:34] But she could have asked her in
[1:05:36] different stages of the journey. Miss
[1:05:38] Lot, how you doing? Glory to God. I
[1:05:41] thank God for the message of the hour.
[1:05:43] Oh, where would we be if it was not for
[1:05:46] the message of the hour? But of course,
[1:05:49] after she left Abraham, she probably
[1:05:51] wanted to put a YouTube video up, you
[1:05:53] know, say, "Oh, I got set free from that
[1:05:55] cult I was in. Oh, it was so much
[1:05:58] bondage. I've got so much freedom now.
[1:06:01] I'm I'm so happy and I've got so much
[1:06:03] freedom." And my you know as we was up
[1:06:06] there Abraham never would let none of
[1:06:08] them camel trains come down through
[1:06:09] there from Egypt and they had all them
[1:06:11] worldly clothes but now they ever one
[1:06:14] come right through the middle of Sodom.
[1:06:16] Well, I've got access to all the worldly
[1:06:18] goods and this and that.
[1:06:23] I wonder if we could go with Lot and ask
[1:06:26] him, Mr. Lot,
[1:06:29] would you tell us? Would you do that
[1:06:32] again?
[1:06:34] Would you pull away from the messenger
[1:06:37] of the hour? Mr. Lot, your first mistake
[1:06:40] was when the messenger told you, "If you
[1:06:44] go to the left, I'll go to the right.
[1:06:45] You go to the right, I'll go to the
[1:06:47] left." You choose yourself. And Mr. Lot,
[1:06:50] you probably know it by now, but we want
[1:06:52] to remind you, your first mistake was
[1:06:56] you didn't counsel God's messenger.
[1:07:00] You didn't ask him, "Oh, prophet of God,
[1:07:04] what should I do? Tell me, give me
[1:07:10] direction."
[1:07:12] Young people, don't make that same
[1:07:14] mistake.
[1:07:16] There's one way for us to overcome in
[1:07:18] this age that we're living. We must keep
[1:07:20] God's word before us. Your vocation in
[1:07:23] life is not just your choice. God gifts
[1:07:26] you and God enables you to do certain
[1:07:28] things and you'll save yourself and God
[1:07:30] a lot of trouble if you go to him and
[1:07:32] ask him, "Lord, lead me. Lead me as to
[1:07:35] what I should be. Lead me as to what I
[1:07:37] should do." You keep him before you in
[1:07:39] all things. It'll make your life so much
[1:07:42] easier.
[1:07:44] Oh, I wonder as Lot. Now, you imagine
[1:07:47] hearing your wife scream and something
[1:07:49] go on, but yet you can't look back.
[1:07:54] You can't look back yourself cuz if you
[1:07:57] do, you'll become what she has become.
[1:08:01] So now you and your daughters have to
[1:08:04] press toward the city zor
[1:08:08] little one
[1:08:09] and you have to leave your wife standing
[1:08:12] there as a pillar of salt
[1:08:15] because she didn't overcome.
[1:08:21] How sad.
[1:08:25] Notice he says,
[1:08:27] "Oh Lord God,
[1:08:30] so it's possible you can make a start
[1:08:32] and still the world be in you." She
[1:08:35] never overcome. And even though she was
[1:08:37] well on the road, it finally overthrowed
[1:08:40] her. And she had to take that one big
[1:08:44] long last
[1:08:47] look.
[1:08:49] What's wrong in just looking?
[1:08:54] Now, your brother's not those of you
[1:08:56] that are just present, but those of you
[1:08:57] that'll hear this.
[1:09:00] You wonder what what's wrong in looking
[1:09:03] on your phone at images that's not
[1:09:06] becoming for a son of God. You say,
[1:09:08] "What? What? What does one look do?"
[1:09:13] I wonder if we could beckon Miss Lot's
[1:09:15] wife tonight and say, "Miss Lot, we're
[1:09:20] going to give you a few minutes to
[1:09:22] testify.
[1:09:24] Miss Lot, what would you say to these
[1:09:26] daughters of God here?
[1:09:28] What would you say to these young men?
[1:09:32] What would you tell them not to do, Miss
[1:09:34] Lot?"
[1:09:36] I would tell them never take that long
[1:09:40] look
[1:09:41] toward the world.
[1:09:44] Tell them boys to never even start
[1:09:47] looking at them websites
[1:09:49] that's not becoming to them
[1:09:52] because all it takes is one long look
[1:09:59] and then it forms and starts from there.
[1:10:03] That was the last thing we could hear
[1:10:05] her say that I remember.
[1:10:09] I just simply turned and looked. I
[1:10:12] didn't even say anything.
[1:10:15] I never even harad and hooray for the
[1:10:18] Sodommites. I never even said, "I agree
[1:10:21] with you, Sodom. I agree. Amen. I
[1:10:25] agree." All I've done was looked.
[1:10:31] I just simply
[1:10:33] looked,
[1:10:36] Lord Jesus.
[1:10:42] Oh my. The prophet said she finally had
[1:10:44] to take that one big long last look.
[1:10:47] That's where she got caught.
[1:10:50] Don't even look
[1:10:53] back.
[1:10:55] Don't have no desires.
[1:10:58] Keep going.
[1:11:00] Put your mind on Calvary.
[1:11:03] Keep moving towards Christ.
[1:11:07] She started out as an overcomer. But she
[1:11:11] never did overcome her. Oh, she left the
[1:11:12] denomination. She did. She walked out of
[1:11:14] Sodom with Lot, but she wanted to go
[1:11:16] back and have her haircut. You know what
[1:11:18] I mean? She had to go back. She couldn't
[1:11:20] stand the test. She had to look back
[1:11:23] again to see what the rest of them was
[1:11:29] doing.
[1:11:31] So it wasn't like she took off running.
[1:11:33] Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. Wait for
[1:11:35] me.
[1:11:37] And she got burned up. She never got
[1:11:39] burned up in the fires of Sodom.
[1:11:43] But she becomes so hard
[1:11:47] and changed
[1:11:50] from a mortal which could make a choice
[1:11:53] into a hardened substance
[1:11:56] of rock.
[1:12:00] Oh young people,
[1:12:03] no wonder that the scripture tells us
[1:12:05] while it is today,
[1:12:08] be not as those who turn down their
[1:12:10] opportunity. Harden not your heart as it
[1:12:14] was in the days of the provocation.
[1:12:18] My my
[1:12:20] Don't you want to overcome?
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; No matter how many things you face and
[1:12:26] what you deal with and what you go
[1:12:28] through, don't let Satan defeat you
[1:12:32] because you're dealing with things and
[1:12:33] with issues and you think, "Brother
[1:12:35] Donnie, I'm just so ashamed. I can't
[1:12:37] even come to church anymore just because
[1:12:39] I, you know, this is bothering me.
[1:12:41] That's bothering me. Well, let me tell
[1:12:43] you, you keep right on coming. There's
[1:12:46] people in our church that smoke
[1:12:47] cigarettes.
[1:12:49] And I preach against smoking cigarettes.
[1:12:52] I sent word to someone not long ago to
[1:12:56] tell their loved one because I knew they
[1:12:58] smoke cigarettes and I knew it
[1:13:00] discouraged them whenever I or Brother
[1:13:02] Joe or anybody else would say something
[1:13:04] about it. So, I sent word to their loved
[1:13:07] one cuz I'd missed seeing them. And I
[1:13:10] told them, I said, "I want you to tell
[1:13:12] so and so that I said, "Come back to
[1:13:16] church. I know they smoke. The Lord
[1:13:19] knows they smoke and the devil knows
[1:13:22] they smoke,
[1:13:24] but I figure their chance of getting
[1:13:26] delivered is better in the house of God
[1:13:28] than it is staying out."
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; So, young people, I don't care what
[1:13:32] you're dealing with. come back to the
[1:13:35] house of God. I don't care what you're
[1:13:38] fighting. I don't care the battles that
[1:13:40] you're dealing with. And you may be so
[1:13:42] ashamed that you can't even hardly look
[1:13:44] me in the face, but that's all right.
[1:13:46] Just if you have to, turn your head and
[1:13:48] I'll walk by. That's all right. Oh, but
[1:13:51] come show that devil, devil, I ain't
[1:13:54] where I want to be and I ain't where I'm
[1:13:56] going to be, but I'll tell you one
[1:13:58] thing. I'm still loving God and I'm
[1:14:00] pressing. I may not be exactly what I
[1:14:03] was 6 months ago or 6 weeks ago, but 6
[1:14:07] weeks from now, I don't plan on being
[1:14:09] what I am now either. And this is one of
[1:14:11] the best places I know of to get changed
[1:14:14] by the power of God. Don't you let the
[1:14:17] devil discourage you and keep you from
[1:14:20] coming to youth services and coming to
[1:14:22] Sunday school and coming to everything
[1:14:25] we have for you. That's why we've got
[1:14:27] church is to be able to help one
[1:14:30] another. Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And the young people said,
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Listen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:14:44] How many loves him tonight with all your
[1:14:46] heart?
[1:14:48] Praise the Lord Jesus. Let me jump over
[1:14:51] here. There's a little something that I
[1:14:53] wanted to wanted to read to you if I can
[1:14:56] find it. It's
[1:14:58] I I believe it'll be a blessing and a
[1:15:00] help to you.
[1:15:02] The prophet's talking about the Lord
[1:15:04] Jesus and he said, "Look, temptation was
[1:15:08] for him." You know that the Bible said
[1:15:11] way in the back, brothers, it's uh
[1:15:13] actually how can overcome paragraph 104.
[1:15:17] He was tempted by women.
[1:15:21] He was tempted by drinking.
[1:15:23] He was tempted by women.
[1:15:26] He was tempted by everything that we
[1:15:29] could be tempted by. He was tempted by
[1:15:32] everything that we are. He was a man.
[1:15:37] And yet you couldn't put a mark on him.
[1:15:40] Well, you say, "Brother Donnie, how in
[1:15:42] the world could he be tempted by
[1:15:44] everything we are?" They didn't have
[1:15:46] marijuana in them days. They didn't have
[1:15:48] cigarettes in them days. They didn't
[1:15:50] have cocaine and meth and all that in
[1:15:53] them days. You're right. They didn't.
[1:15:57] But see, you're still looking at what?
[1:16:00] I'm looking at how.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; There's only three ways that all of us
[1:16:06] are tempted. The lust of the flesh, the
[1:16:10] lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.
[1:16:14] That's the way all temptations, one of
[1:16:17] the three, or it can be two, or it can
[1:16:19] be all three at one time. That's the
[1:16:22] means that Satan uses to tempt us. Jesus
[1:16:26] didn't have to be tempted by watching
[1:16:28] R-rated movies. They didn't have movies
[1:16:30] in that day. They didn't have any any of
[1:16:32] the the technology, you know, that we
[1:16:34] do. That's right. But it's exactly the
[1:16:37] same way that Satan will try to get you
[1:16:40] and I. Lust of the flesh, lust of the
[1:16:43] eyes of the pride of life. And Jesus
[1:16:46] overcome all three. And he told us in
[1:16:50] the book of John, "Be of good cheer. I
[1:16:54] have overcome the world." Which I find
[1:16:57] absolutely amazing. His blood had not
[1:17:00] been shed. He had not been beat. He had
[1:17:03] not been crucified. He had he had not
[1:17:05] died yet nor raised from the dead. But
[1:17:08] he had already overcome the world as a
[1:17:12] living testimony.
[1:17:14] Why? He had faced all of these three
[1:17:16] avenues. lust of the flesh, lust of the
[1:17:19] eyes, and the pride of life. And he had
[1:17:22] already overcome them, not as a risen
[1:17:25] savior, but as a man filled with the
[1:17:29] Holy Ghost. Praise be to God. Aren't you
[1:17:32] glad that's our key, brother Daryl? If
[1:17:34] he would have said that after he raised
[1:17:35] from the dead, it would still be unfair
[1:17:38] to us. So, a resurrected being says, "Be
[1:17:41] of good cheer. I've overcome the world."
[1:17:43] Well, sure you have. You've raised from
[1:17:44] the dead. But he let us know before I'm
[1:17:48] even going to Calvary to die for you,
[1:17:50] I've already overcome. And when you get
[1:17:53] my life in you, you can overcome the
[1:17:56] same way.
[1:17:58] Oh, young people, I want to stand there
[1:18:00] with you when we walk before the Lord
[1:18:01] that day. I hope I'm alive.
[1:18:06] I hope I'm alive when it comes and I'll
[1:18:08] be able to stand back there and see all
[1:18:10] of you coming. Praise God. We'll stand
[1:18:13] there together. Yes, Lord.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Don't you want to be there?
[1:18:17] By the grace of God, I want to look back
[1:18:19] there and see you, you and your mommies,
[1:18:21] your daddies, you know, your brothers,
[1:18:22] your sisters, all that sort of thing,
[1:18:24] just standing there together. And I can
[1:18:26] turn around and say, "Lord, Lord, here
[1:18:28] here's what here's what you gave me."
[1:18:30] We'll stand there with the prophet of
[1:18:32] God. And all the pastors, all the
[1:18:34] ministers will stand right up there, and
[1:18:36] the prophet will present the bride of
[1:18:37] this age. And there'll be the little
[1:18:39] subsidiary groups and, you know, the
[1:18:41] different churches from all over the
[1:18:42] world. And there they'll stand. And you
[1:18:44] want to stand there. And there will be
[1:18:47] John. And there will be Mark. And
[1:18:48] there'll be Luke. And there'll be
[1:18:49] Bartholomew and Timothy. And there'll be
[1:18:51] those saints that were beheaded in their
[1:18:53] day. And you'll walk up. And them
[1:18:55] children of God will look at you. And
[1:18:57] you'll run and grab them. And they'll
[1:18:59] grab you. Praise be to God. What an
[1:19:03] hour. What a time. It'll be worth
[1:19:07] everything we've gone through.
[1:19:09] Everything you've give up. Oh, that
[1:19:12] might seem so hard now. It'll be so
[1:19:15] trivial when we get there that day.
[1:19:19] Can we bow our heads?
[1:19:22] Would you mind
[1:19:24] laying your hand over on that person
[1:19:25] standing by you?
[1:19:29] I I know you face a lot of things, young
[1:19:32] people. I know you go through so much in
[1:19:34] life.
[1:19:36] Be encouraged tonight. The Lord Jesus is
[1:19:39] mindful of you.
[1:19:41] I believe with all of my heart he put
[1:19:43] this on my heart today. I I just
[1:19:46] couldn't couldn't get away from it. It
[1:19:48] just bearing on me and bearing on me. I
[1:19:50] thought, Lord, I'm just going to follow
[1:19:51] you. Now, you're not going to pray for
[1:19:54] yourself, but you're going to pray for
[1:19:55] them. Now, it might be your best friend
[1:19:58] and maybe you're knowing what they're
[1:19:59] going through and then it might be that
[1:20:01] they don't even tell you that deep
[1:20:03] secret in their heart.
[1:20:06] But we're going to pray for one another
[1:20:07] that God will help us.
[1:20:11] Lord Jesus,
[1:20:13] thank you for your word tonight. Lord,
[1:20:16] thank you for your presence that we
[1:20:19] sense is near us tonight, Lord Jesus.
[1:20:23] I pray for these young people, Father.
[1:20:26] Lord God, I'm sure that
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; if they would just open up to me and to
[1:20:31] Brother Rob, to Brother Joe, and share
[1:20:34] with us the different things that that
[1:20:35] they go through, Lord, it would be
[1:20:38] heart-wrenching for us. But Lord, as
[1:20:41] their leaders, we desire to do
[1:20:43] everything we can to help them. We're
[1:20:46] here, Father, to make a difference in
[1:20:48] their life. Lord God, we don't want them
[1:20:51] to feel, Lord, that they could never
[1:20:53] come to us or that they would be so
[1:20:56] embarrassed. Lord, I always want to be a
[1:20:58] a pastor that they would feel
[1:21:00] comfortable to come and talk to. Help
[1:21:03] me, Lord Jesus, that I can be able to be
[1:21:06] the kind of man, Lord, that they know if
[1:21:08] they come that their secret will never
[1:21:11] go any farther. Lord, oh Jesus, now they
[1:21:14] have their hands one upon the other.
[1:21:17] young men, young women, some of them
[1:21:19] married, Lord, but we're praying for
[1:21:21] each other tonight. Maybe that young man
[1:21:24] that's battling something so difficult,
[1:21:27] Lord, he's fallen to it many times, but
[1:21:30] he's standing here tonight, Lord, and
[1:21:32] he's sick of it. Lord God, he wants to
[1:21:35] be delivered. That young sister, father
[1:21:38] that's failed so many times to whatever
[1:21:40] it is in her life. Lord God, I know I've
[1:21:43] preached to more than just a small group
[1:21:46] of young people. It will reverberate
[1:21:48] around the world. Father, I pray for
[1:21:51] every man, woman, boy, and girl. Lord,
[1:21:53] no matter what they're going through,
[1:21:55] dear God, if they're at home, if they're
[1:21:57] streaming, wherever they are in the name
[1:22:00] of Jesus, may the spirit of God come in
[1:22:03] their living room, come in their car
[1:22:05] right now. Father, we agree together on
[1:22:08] the promise of your word. Lord, we don't
[1:22:11] want to just be theological Christians.
[1:22:13] We don't want to just be Christians that
[1:22:16] can talk about the mysteries of the word
[1:22:18] and the great things that the prophet of
[1:22:20] God brought. But we want to be
[1:22:22] Christians that have victory in our
[1:22:25] lives. Father, victory over besetting
[1:22:28] sins, victory over things that Satan
[1:22:31] wants to bring us down with. Lord, we
[1:22:33] don't want to be the type of Christians
[1:22:35] that has to hang our head in shame, but
[1:22:37] we want to be able to look at the things
[1:22:39] that we face in life and by the grace of
[1:22:42] God, put them under our feet. Oh God, I
[1:22:46] pray for them tonight. Father, I pray
[1:22:48] for every man, woman, boy, and girl,
[1:22:51] Lord Jesus, in our assembly and those,
[1:22:54] Lord God, that look to this place as
[1:22:56] their home church. Father, I pray for
[1:22:59] them, Lord, in the name of Jesus. The
[1:23:01] men, the women, the married couples,
[1:23:04] Lord, whoever they are, in Jesus
[1:23:06] Christ's name. May the spirit of God
[1:23:09] just move and minister to every one of
[1:23:11] them, Lord. Oh, what a day of victory
[1:23:14] it'll be on that resurrection morning
[1:23:16] when the saints of God would have
[1:23:18] achieved that ultimate of goals, and
[1:23:20] that is that our bodies will be changed.
[1:23:24] And the prophet Paul said, "In that day
[1:23:27] that the saying shall be brought to
[1:23:29] pass, death is swallowed up in victory."
[1:23:33] We first laid aside smoking and we laid
[1:23:35] aside this and we laid aside that. And
[1:23:38] we kept laying aside until we come to
[1:23:41] the ultimate victory and that was old
[1:23:44] age, mortality, pain, sickness, disease.
[1:23:49] And in a moment, in a twinkling of an
[1:23:51] eye, the same power of God that changed
[1:23:54] us to a new creature will change our
[1:23:57] bodies. And we'll all become young in a
[1:24:01] moment, Lord God. Oh Jesus. It'll be
[1:24:04] that same power that helps us overcome
[1:24:07] now. It'll only be a multiplication of
[1:24:10] that same power that'll change our
[1:24:12] bodies on that resurrection morning.
[1:24:15] Would you grant it, Lord? We love you
[1:24:18] tonight, Father. We worship you, Lord
[1:24:22] Jesus. We worship you, Lord Jesus.
[1:24:26] Thank you for your word tonight, Lord.
[1:24:29] Thank you for your presence, Lord. I
[1:24:32] want to be more of an overcomer, Father,
[1:24:35] in my life. Oh Jesus, we've been made
[1:24:39] more than conquerors,
[1:24:42] overcomers in this life. We've been made
[1:24:45] victorious through the blood of Jesus
[1:24:48] Christ. Oh, most of us will never stand
[1:24:50] and say, "Well, I donated $100,000 for
[1:24:54] this. I gave 50,000. I bought 2700
[1:24:58] Bibles. I done this and that." Most of
[1:25:00] us will never be able to say that. But
[1:25:02] oh God, we want to be able to stand that
[1:25:05] day and say, "By the grace of God, I was
[1:25:07] an overcomer. My lot in life was little
[1:25:10] compared to this man and that man, but I
[1:25:13] stood for what God wanted me to stand. I
[1:25:16] know when I stand there that day, Lord,
[1:25:18] I'll stand there and watch great men
[1:25:20] walk up there and get their rewards.
[1:25:22] I've been so privileged to rub shoulders
[1:25:24] with some of the greatest men of God in
[1:25:26] this age. I thank you for giving me that
[1:25:28] honor. I'll never be what they are, but
[1:25:31] Lord, I only want to be what you've made
[1:25:33] me to be. But this one thing I do ask
[1:25:35] you to let me be. Let me be an
[1:25:37] overcomer. Let me be an overcomer in the
[1:25:40] little patch of territory that's mine.
[1:25:43] Let me overcome, Father. All the
[1:25:45] Philistines, all the Hittites, all the
[1:25:47] Amorites, come against me, Lord God. Let
[1:25:50] me take up my ox goat as it was. Lord, I
[1:25:54] may never be a Samson. I may never be a
[1:25:56] great victor like them. There may not be
[1:25:58] but one story wrote about my life like
[1:26:01] it was some of the heroes in the Bible.
[1:26:03] But if I ain't got nothing but an ox
[1:26:05] goat in my hand, let me take that ox
[1:26:07] goat and one battle. Let let it be
[1:26:10] written about my life that I slayed 600
[1:26:13] Philistines. Then Lord God, let me be an
[1:26:16] overcomer. Granted, Lord Jesus, I've
[1:26:19] never asked you for money. I've never
[1:26:21] asked you for fame, fortune. I've never
[1:26:24] asked you for a big position in the
[1:26:26] message, but I will ask you for this
[1:26:29] tonight. Let me be an overcomer.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; An overcomer in this life, Lord God. I
[1:26:36] would rather have that than fame. I
[1:26:38] would rather have that than fortune. I
[1:26:40] would rather have that than money. I
[1:26:42] would rather have that than notoriety.
[1:26:44] Lord God, let me overcome whatever I go
[1:26:47] through in life. Father, make us
[1:26:50] overcomers, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:53] Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:59] Amen.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord Jesus.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's worship him tonight.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Overcomers in this life.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Let's worship him together. Brother Paul
[1:27:13] leads us now.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; You've been made.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Oh father, let that be our testimony
[1:27:22] of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everybody now with all your
[1:27:27] heart just sing it. We've been made more
[1:27:30] than conqueror conquer conquerors.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Overcomers
[1:27:38] in this life.

[1:34:19] [Applause]
[1:34:23] Wonderful. How wonderful. Well, God
[1:34:25] bless you all. Hope you enjoyed that
[1:34:26] tonight. I certainly did. Uh, one thing
[1:34:28] that I picked out and I'm so thankful
[1:34:30] for that maybe you didn't recognize is
[1:34:31] when when brother Donnie goes a full
[1:34:34] different direction. That's not human
[1:34:35] nature. Human nature is to f to follow
[1:34:39] what you have planned. So, the sons of
[1:34:42] God are led by the spirit of God. That
[1:34:44] is unique. That's not something I've
[1:34:46] seen in life. Okay. to actually come out
[1:34:49] before a number of people and go a
[1:34:51] totally different direction is not
[1:34:52] comfortable for us. So that's something
[1:34:55] very special and it's for a lot of
[1:34:56] people and I just enjoy it so much.
[1:34:59] Overcoming we all need to and what it is
[1:35:01] that as youth leaders or as the pastor
[1:35:03] would say of of course we're here to
[1:35:05] serve you
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; and it's something that strengthens us
[1:35:08] helps us to overcome and one thing that
[1:35:10] helps me overcome is when I love him
[1:35:12] more I find it a whole lot easier to
[1:35:13] overcome.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. And when I love you, I
[1:35:16] find it a whole lot easier to overcome,
[1:35:18] too. And what we want to see in a
[1:35:20] celebratory way is that when you love
[1:35:22] each other, that's when we know we are
[1:35:25] on it is when you have one love one for
[1:35:27] another, right? And fulfill that. Let's
[1:35:29] pray. Dear Lord, thank you for your
[1:35:31] grace. Thank you so much for this
[1:35:32] opportunity. Have us to recognize these
[1:35:35] are the good old days.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; It's not something down the road. It is
[1:35:39] today. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:35:42] today, this day, and forever. Thank you
[1:35:44] so much for your revelation. Lord, give
[1:35:46] us more and more revelation. Revelation
[1:35:49] of all the things that we have need of,
[1:35:51] Lord. You know what we have need of and
[1:35:53] we are your sheep. We follow your
[1:35:55] leading. We thank you, Lord, for the
[1:35:56] grace of God. We thank you for the
[1:35:58] understanding of your word and we thank
[1:35:59] you, Lord, for the journey home. And we
[1:36:02] pray in Jesus Christ's name. We love
[1:36:04] you. Amen.
[1:36:07] Sing more than conquerors again. We've
[1:36:10] been made more than coner.
[1:36:14] Sing it as you go.
[1:36:17] More overcomeers in this life.
[1:36:24] We've been made
[1:36:27] victorious
[1:36:32] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:39] We've been made more than coner,
[1:36:47] overcomeers
[1:36:48] in this life.
[1:36:54] We've been made
[1:36:57] victorious
[1:37:02] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
