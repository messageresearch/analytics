[42:58] pray father
[42:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[43:01] amen
[43:03] God bless you may be seated
[43:11] considering
[43:13] that this is wrote about a woman
[43:18] like Bathsheba
[43:20] which is not very well thought of
[43:22] amongst Many religious ranks
[43:25] it makes it quite
[43:27] outstanding
[43:28] that
[43:29] Solomon would write such words
[43:32] about his mother
[43:35] a woman with a lot of trouble
[43:38] a woman with a lot of issues that she
[43:41] had to deal with no doubt in our life
[43:45] as I was studying this week my mind went
[43:49] back to this
[43:51] quote been a while since I'd read it
[43:54] I think it sets forth the epitome
[43:57] really the summation of a lot of Our
[44:00] Lives
[44:02] so when the world falling apart
[44:04] the prophet said we want everything just
[44:07] so
[44:08] we can take it easy
[44:11] and retire
[44:13] and take life easy
[44:17] life
[44:19] was an intended
[44:22] to be easy
[44:25] and I don't know about most of you but
[44:34] easy
[44:36] apparently the PA system ain't meant to
[44:38] be easy to operate either as a
[44:42] so life wasn't intended to be easy
[44:47] life
[44:48] is a struggle
[44:50] anything that's got life he said is
[44:55] struggling look at the trees how they
[44:58] struggle look at everything that's got
[45:01] life
[45:02] it's a struggle
[45:05] but why is it that we want it easy or
[45:07] something about us don't we how many
[45:09] mothers much rather have life easier
[45:11] easier every day me too I mean I put up
[45:14] both legs if I could stand
[45:16] I I wish things about my life was easier
[45:19] I wish things about your life I wish
[45:21] things about just about life in general
[45:23] was easier but yet
[45:26] we have a Vindicated Prophet telling us
[45:28] that it was not intended
[45:30] to be easy so when I look at this I
[45:33] realize there's a portion of me
[45:35] that is longing for when life will be
[45:39] easy
[45:41] but it won't be now
[45:44] but when I look at this and I think
[45:47] it's no wonder that God would allow
[45:51] trouble and difficulty and hardships and
[45:54] things to come our way because you know
[45:57] how it is with most of us probably we go
[46:00] through one thing of life and we get it
[46:02] taken care of and thing is pretty good
[46:05] and then we don't get to enjoy that
[46:08] hardly a day or so that something else
[46:10] comes up
[46:11] and sometimes it can be even worse than
[46:13] what you today and with the day before
[46:15] disappointments and Sadness and Sorrow
[46:18] and sickness and trouble it's just
[46:19] seemed like it's one thing after another
[46:22] anybody that way besides me well praise
[46:24] the Lord I don't feel so strange then
[46:26] and yet when you look at this you
[46:28] realize that life then was not intended
[46:31] to be easy now I want you to listen to
[46:34] what he goes on to say when we try to
[46:37] get some type of a system
[46:39] that takes it easy
[46:42] then we are wrong
[46:47] wow I guarantee one thing I'm probably
[46:50] wrong about a lot of things but I ain't
[46:52] wrong about this
[46:54] because I've never found a system myself
[46:57] to where life was easy
[47:00] he says whenever we try to get some kind
[47:03] of a system that takes it easy then
[47:04] we're wrong and we know there's
[47:08] something wrong
[47:10] so if life was not intended to be easy
[47:14] then I wonder when God allows difficult
[47:17] times to come our way
[47:19] we know truly they must be for a reason
[47:23] and a purpose
[47:24] doesn't mean we enjoy it doesn't mean we
[47:27] like it doesn't mean that we look
[47:30] forward to it
[47:31] but yet God is able to take things that
[47:34] happen in our lives that can seem
[47:37] absolutely so destructive and so
[47:40] devastating that we will never get over
[47:43] it I'm sure there's people sitting here
[47:45] today and people under the sound of my
[47:47] voice in different parts of the world
[47:49] and you face things in your life and you
[47:51] saw there is no way I'll ever be able to
[47:55] get over this I'll never be the same
[47:58] this has scarred me this has hindered me
[48:01] for the rest of my life and yet you look
[48:04] back today and you think well I thought
[48:06] it did but actually it didn't so how did
[48:09] that turn out well God helped you with
[48:11] that situation
[48:13] but we realize that many people don't do
[48:16] so good with life's problems you know if
[48:21] you've ever studied much about serial
[48:23] killers and you've studied about those
[48:25] that come to a place to where they can
[48:27] take human life and not feel any remorse
[48:32] they don't feel any sadness they can lie
[48:34] they can cheat they can steal they can
[48:36] do all kinds of things and it's not to
[48:38] have no conscience at all and we truly
[48:41] believe we're living in a time when
[48:43] people's conscience is being seared with
[48:45] a hot iron as the scripture tells us
[48:47] that it would be and yet they will get
[48:50] to a place where they could take one
[48:52] life and another and another and then
[48:54] they become what is identified as a
[48:56] serial killer then they study these type
[48:59] of people and what I've found in looking
[49:01] at some of them myself is that things
[49:04] happen to them early on in life and
[49:07] maybe they were very awkward in society
[49:11] a lot of them the predominant ones that
[49:14] are serial killers are males 25 to 45.
[49:18] many of them drive a certain type of
[49:20] vehicle I'm going to tell you what kind
[49:22] it is they drive a certain type of
[49:24] vehicle and they there's certain traits
[49:27] about them now I find that I find that
[49:30] amazing to see that they live in
[49:33] different parts of the world and yet
[49:35] there's a certain demagogue about them
[49:38] and a certain mannerism about them most
[49:42] of them that will kill women they had a
[49:45] very hard time ever getting a girlfriend
[49:47] they had a very hard time ever being
[49:50] able to speak to women feel very
[49:52] comfortable being around them and it's
[49:54] like they're taking revenge on every
[49:58] woman that they kill and it's something
[50:01] that happened within them those of you
[50:03] that have been following the four
[50:05] murders out in Idaho and the suspect
[50:09] that they have in jail and all that and
[50:11] they begin to look at the man's life and
[50:14] they saw this same pattern that I just
[50:16] described to you he was never able to
[50:18] talk to girls he was always
[50:21] strange as some of them identified him
[50:24] and and did not fit in society and they
[50:26] begin to shape something in the mind and
[50:30] the life of that individual now there's
[50:33] no doubt in my mind there's people
[50:35] sitting here this morning were it not
[50:37] for the grace of God by some of the
[50:39] things that we've been through we would
[50:41] be worse shape than some of them people
[50:43] you read about in the newspaper but what
[50:46] makes the difference the Lord got a hold
[50:48] of Our Lives
[50:50] because you see Satan knew once he broke
[50:53] into the human race all he would need to
[50:55] do is start defiling the first few
[50:58] people on the Earth then they would
[51:00] continue to hand down that sort of
[51:03] saying now if you've ever really looked
[51:04] at it or not but I've looked at it
[51:06] myself quite a bit in those that molest
[51:10] kids and the way that it starts and it's
[51:12] very it's very traumatic and it can be
[51:15] so devastating but what I've found out
[51:18] for many of them a great percentage of
[51:20] those who will molest kids were also
[51:23] molested themselves and then you look
[51:25] back so that one who molested them was
[51:28] also molested so it's like it's an
[51:30] unending cycle that Satan started so
[51:34] many many years ago and all he has to do
[51:37] he doesn't have to come up and send his
[51:39] demons every year every month to start
[51:42] reinstigating all this evil in the human
[51:45] race but he starts it way back Yonder
[51:48] thousands of years ago and P people get
[51:51] in that cycle then they live out what
[51:53] happened to them and what's peculiar
[51:56] about it is most of them absolutely hate
[51:58] it they hate what happened to them they
[52:03] so despise it it wrecked their life it
[52:06] totally turned their life upside down
[52:08] and yet they turn around and become the
[52:13] very thing they hate I don't sit there
[52:15] and look at me strange but as being a
[52:18] pastor and counseling lots of people
[52:20] down through the years decades of my
[52:23] life that I've give to the gospel here
[52:26] and around the world and I've found that
[52:28] many people if they're not careful they
[52:31] will become if it's a man and he had a
[52:34] father that was a certain certain way
[52:35] what's amazing is that many of those men
[52:38] that they despise those certain traits
[52:41] about their father they turn right
[52:43] around become the same thing and a woman
[52:46] will do exactly the same thing though
[52:48] they hate it but it it's like it's
[52:51] something ingrained in them it's like
[52:54] they are groomed by their DNA they are
[52:57] groomed by the mythology and they come
[53:00] down and it's a method that it's over
[53:02] and over again and we repeat ourself and
[53:05] we know as human beings that we are
[53:07] creatures of habit and much of what we
[53:10] will become years later in our life we
[53:14] gain that influence when we are very
[53:16] very young so it takes something to
[53:20] break that cycle so some of you you may
[53:23] look around say well I wish I could see
[53:25] a miracle if you brushed your teeth this
[53:27] morning looked in the mirror you saw one
[53:30] because no telling what's in your family
[53:32] tree and what all kinds of strains are
[53:35] in your family and yet you set here
[53:37] today differ
[53:39] thank God I'm glad that I'm not what
[53:42] runs in my family on both sides come on
[53:45] they don't sit there and look at me like
[53:46] y'all come from a bunch of angels you
[53:48] did the kind that ride motorcycles
[53:52] not but the one with wings on their
[53:54] backs but they wore leather jackets and
[53:56] you know all them type of helmet types
[53:58] of things but yet we look and see that
[54:01] God is able to take people like us
[54:05] people like this that we look at like
[54:09] Bathsheba that was brought to the Palace
[54:12] against her will she appears in the
[54:15] first pages of scripture that we find
[54:17] her name and it's not with a great
[54:20] introduction to the king it's not with a
[54:23] great party this went to with her
[54:26] husband and she was met in some
[54:28] political Affair but she was met in an
[54:32] adulterous relationship with King David
[54:35] her husband is killed she's separated
[54:38] from her stepchildren she's forced to
[54:42] marry a man that she does not love David
[54:46] does not love her as a man should love a
[54:50] woman when he marries her but David just
[54:53] after her beauty no doubt he would have
[54:55] left her alone that should not come up
[54:58] with a child then David has to come up
[55:01] with a conniving evil Wicked plan to
[55:05] kill her husband so she loses her
[55:08] husband she loses her stepchildren she
[55:11] loses her way of life she loses all of
[55:15] this because one of God's Great Men fell
[55:19] into sin
[55:22] praise the Lord but remember God had
[55:25] already made an Everlasting Covenant
[55:27] with David and he said from the fruit of
[55:30] thy body well I set upon thy Throne so
[55:35] David's sin could never even break that
[55:38] Covenant but God made I'm glad God's got
[55:41] one like that with a bride too
[55:43] but it doesn't mean that David doing
[55:46] wrong he did not reap greatly and he
[55:49] would for the rest of his life and so
[55:52] did Bathsheba but before we go into her
[55:55] a little bit more let's look into a
[55:57] another woman in the Bible that we're
[56:00] all very familiar with we don't know her
[56:02] name apparently it's not significant but
[56:05] she was the woman at the well and we all
[56:09] know that this woman was a very famous
[56:12] woman Jesus spoke things to her he
[56:15] hadn't even spoken to his disciples he
[56:18] shared things about himself to this
[56:21] woman and she was the first one to even
[56:24] know about it and their meeting was
[56:26] quite unusual it's a connecting time
[56:30] Saint John 4 chapter 6 verse 6 rather
[56:34] now Jacob's Well was there and Jesus
[56:37] therefore being wearied with his journey
[56:40] set thus on the well and it was about
[56:43] the the sixth hour and there was come a
[56:46] woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus
[56:49] saith unto her give me to drain now to
[56:52] save time will jump down to verse 15.
[56:54] the woman saith unto him sir give me
[56:57] this water that I thirst not neither
[57:00] come hitherto draw Jesus saith unto her
[57:03] go call thy husband
[57:06] and come hither now notice go call thy
[57:10] husband the woman answered and said I
[57:14] have no husband Jesus said unto her
[57:17] thouest well said I have no husband thou
[57:20] Hast had five husbands and he whom thou
[57:25] has thou Hast is not thy husband so
[57:29] she's living with a man most of us will
[57:33] not even speak to this woman
[57:36] we wouldn't want our great reputation to
[57:39] be tainted
[57:40] but Jesus reputation is made among this
[57:44] type of people I hope we never get so
[57:46] goody goody that we can't reach out to
[57:49] this type of people
[57:51] now notice in verse 19 then the woman
[57:54] says unto him sir I perceive that thou
[57:59] art a prophet now myself reading the
[58:02] Bible since a little boy I never
[58:05] understood this scripture I never
[58:07] understood why Jesus said what he said
[58:11] and I never understood why I went the
[58:13] direction that he went until I came to
[58:16] the message and then one which was a
[58:20] window into the realm of the
[58:22] supernatural actually opened to us for
[58:26] the first time what Jesus actually did
[58:29] Paul never mentioned what Jesus was
[58:31] doing Peter never mentioned it none of
[58:35] the rest of the New Testament writers
[58:36] have I ever found ever actually
[58:39] mentioned what Jesus did but what Jesus
[58:43] was doing was contacting This Woman's
[58:47] Spirit not her soul not her body now
[58:50] listen what the prophet says about this
[58:53] when you go to a person that's when the
[58:56] vision starts and you contact their
[58:59] Spirit like Jesus talking to the woman
[59:01] at the well he contacted her spirit and
[59:05] then the vision takes place again he
[59:08] says she said well our fathers Worship
[59:11] in this mountain and you say in
[59:12] Jerusalem and the conversation went on
[59:15] at length now he says now you have to
[59:18] take my word for this right here or this
[59:20] part he was contacting her spirit the
[59:25] father had sent him there but he didn't
[59:28] know yet what was going to take place
[59:30] so Jesus goes by the leading of the
[59:34] father living in his body but the father
[59:37] did not tell him what he's going to do
[59:39] so Jesus is just led by the spirit and
[59:43] he goes up to the Wilderness or to the
[59:45] water rather and he comes out of the
[59:47] Wilderness and comes up to the Samaria
[59:49] which the disciples were totally
[59:51] uncomfortable even going to because they
[59:53] had no dealings with one another so he's
[59:56] there and he's just kind of waiting
[59:58] around now can you imagine the Lord
[59:59] Jesus not even knowing for sure what yet
[1:00:02] to do so he waits and he waits and the
[1:00:06] woman comes out and he figures it must
[1:00:08] be something to do with her so he starts
[1:00:10] talking to her now as he talks he's
[1:00:14] trying to contact the communication
[1:00:17] channel of her being now think of it why
[1:00:21] didn't he contact her soul you realize
[1:00:25] your soul has no memory
[1:00:28] your soul has no conscience your soul is
[1:00:34] not the contact Communication channel by
[1:00:38] which your faults and your past can be
[1:00:41] found
[1:00:42] the soul of a child of God that has once
[1:00:46] been redeemed no longer holds the memory
[1:00:50] of your past oh that'll make us all
[1:00:54] happy
[1:00:54] so the prophet if a person would come up
[1:00:58] and contact their soul the soul would
[1:01:01] have no information to disclose about
[1:01:05] the scars of the past you follow me so
[1:01:08] far so the Lord Jesus now he doesn't
[1:01:11] know what to do and he knows that he's
[1:01:14] been sent there for a purpose so he
[1:01:15] starts talking to the woman and uh you
[1:01:18] know uh bring me a train let's start
[1:01:21] time I'm a little bit thirsty so would
[1:01:22] you would you care to bring me a drink
[1:01:24] oh I'm terrible looking at you you're a
[1:01:26] Jew y'all don't have no demons with us
[1:01:27] we're Samaritans and since then he goes
[1:01:29] on like that and he says okay well go
[1:01:33] get your husband and we'll we'll talk
[1:01:35] about him well I don't have a husband
[1:01:37] but by now he has contacted her channel
[1:01:41] of communication now the spirit has
[1:01:44] imagination conscience memory reason and
[1:01:49] affection so he's contacted the
[1:01:52] communication channel of her being why
[1:01:55] does he need that for he needs to find
[1:01:58] what's stored in her past
[1:02:02] he needs to find what hurts are stored
[1:02:07] and where are they stored in her spirit
[1:02:11] you see I hope you understand I'm not
[1:02:14] trying to belittle anyone any any
[1:02:17] brothers uh in the message that mainly
[1:02:20] emphasize Divine Healing of the body I'm
[1:02:23] not trying to even downplay those that
[1:02:25] don't really believe in prayer lines you
[1:02:27] say we've got people in the message that
[1:02:28] don't we do yeah we do
[1:02:31] but I also think that there's that other
[1:02:34] realm that Realm of the spirit now let
[1:02:38] me say this I I'm not a prophet uh we're
[1:02:41] not looking for another Prophet myself
[1:02:43] I'm not sure you all are I'm not looking
[1:02:45] for another Gentile Prophet because
[1:02:47] there's no promise in the scripture for
[1:02:49] one and I don't believe that we need a
[1:02:53] prophet to be able to come and discern
[1:02:55] this and that and the other in our
[1:02:57] spirit but I still believe that the word
[1:03:00] is a discerner and the word can be able
[1:03:05] to go in and divide and separate the
[1:03:08] soul from the spirit and even the spirit
[1:03:11] from the body to be able to get people
[1:03:14] into the light of God the to microscope
[1:03:17] of God can fall upon their wounded part
[1:03:21] and help them get healing shouldn't we
[1:03:23] all want that for for ourselves and for
[1:03:24] each other well whenever Jesus then
[1:03:27] contacts this woman he contacts the
[1:03:31] communication channel of her being now
[1:03:33] the prophet said that he contacted her
[1:03:36] spirit and when he finally contacted the
[1:03:39] woman's Spirit he went right straight to
[1:03:42] her trouble
[1:03:43] so her trouble even though her body was
[1:03:47] acting out this lifestyle her body was
[1:03:52] acting out all these different husbands
[1:03:54] and she was a very Wicked Woman when it
[1:03:56] come to sexual impurity but yet the
[1:03:59] trouble was not actually in her body now
[1:04:03] listen to me but the trouble laid of
[1:04:07] course in the soul and the Soul controls
[1:04:10] the spirit and the spirit controls the
[1:04:14] body but the soul Jesus didn't contact
[1:04:17] it because the soul does not contain
[1:04:21] memory so the soul does not contain
[1:04:26] imagination thank God for the human
[1:04:28] Spirit do you understand when people go
[1:04:29] out of their mind you know what happens
[1:04:31] to them now sometimes it can be brain
[1:04:33] cells it can be brain matter it can be
[1:04:35] the dark matter can be different things
[1:04:36] and the mind itself it's if it's a
[1:04:38] physical thing but if a person goes
[1:04:40] insane and it is a spiritual Insanity
[1:04:44] something happens in their Spirit
[1:04:46] remember the twin girls and the prophet
[1:04:48] talked about one of them could take the
[1:04:50] stress and the trouble of life and the
[1:04:52] other one couldn't and she lost her mind
[1:04:54] so he goes to talk to her goes into the
[1:04:56] insane place and when he goes in there
[1:04:58] he gives another example of another lady
[1:05:00] as well very similar and whenever he
[1:05:02] goes in there he talks to the girl and
[1:05:04] he says you know you wanted to be a
[1:05:06] preacher's wife you want it and a smile
[1:05:08] come on her face it broke change their
[1:05:10] spirit so he said he had to go out and
[1:05:13] bring that girl's Spirit back into her
[1:05:17] body she didn't know who she was she
[1:05:19] didn't know who her parents was so her
[1:05:22] soul was there it was not because
[1:05:24] something had happened into her mind
[1:05:26] that she had a stroke and something that
[1:05:28] damaged her brain but she was insane
[1:05:31] because her spirit had took a journey
[1:05:34] into another world
[1:05:36] so the prophet goes out and catches that
[1:05:39] spirit and brings it back once her human
[1:05:42] Spirit come back into her body why of
[1:05:45] course she would remember who she was
[1:05:47] why because memory lays in the spirit
[1:05:51] you understand why the world that the
[1:05:54] prophet would declare the world is going
[1:05:55] insane so they don't know what is right
[1:05:58] and wrong well word is rhymed in wrong
[1:06:01] way the ability to know that in your
[1:06:04] conscience which is in your spirit so if
[1:06:08] the world goes crazy insane and their
[1:06:12] Spirit roaming out there in the Nether
[1:06:14] world wherever it is will they not come
[1:06:17] to a spot they will not know what right
[1:06:20] is what wrong is they won't know who's a
[1:06:23] man who's a Woman They want no black
[1:06:25] white red yellow they will know anything
[1:06:28] so then for us to talk to them and they
[1:06:32] will have no wrong as I read the other
[1:06:35] day this suspect as I mentioned to you
[1:06:37] about a while ago that the man looking
[1:06:39] back at some of the posts that the man
[1:06:41] had said about himself that he could do
[1:06:43] anything and could say anything and felt
[1:06:48] no wrong felt no shame whatever he said
[1:06:52] whatever he did well that shows you that
[1:06:55] there's something not just physically
[1:06:58] wrong with that individual but the
[1:07:01] spirit itself is roaming out there
[1:07:04] somewhere because the conscience is no
[1:07:07] longer there if you've got a good
[1:07:08] conscious day you ought to be thanking
[1:07:10] God if you say something wrong and it
[1:07:12] bothers you you ought to thank God if
[1:07:15] you do something wrong even think
[1:07:16] something wrong it bothers you that
[1:07:18] means you still got a spirit don't send
[1:07:20] it away
[1:07:22] now noticing that this woman she's a
[1:07:26] very famous character of course in the
[1:07:28] Bible I love the way the prophet says as
[1:07:30] he finally contacted the woman's spirit
[1:07:32] and he went straight to her trouble so
[1:07:35] by contacting her human Spirit now he
[1:07:37] has access to all these five gates which
[1:07:41] the spirit is made of so you got
[1:07:43] imagination conscience memory reason and
[1:07:46] affection and this is why when we
[1:07:49] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:51] that our soul is what is sealed to the
[1:07:54] day of redemption Satan still has access
[1:07:57] to our spirit because our spirit is not
[1:08:01] sealed our spirit can receive blessings
[1:08:05] from the Holy Ghost and the spirit can
[1:08:07] get so anointed we could see Visions or
[1:08:10] prophesy or we could feel the Holy Ghost
[1:08:12] all over us but in our spirit it would
[1:08:15] come and go come and go the spirit is
[1:08:18] not sealed the body is not sealed the
[1:08:22] soul is what SEALs so when the soul is
[1:08:25] sealed then the body can still remember
[1:08:28] how can it do that through your spirit
[1:08:30] your past how many of y'all still
[1:08:32] remember things you've done that you
[1:08:34] wish you'd never done in your life you
[1:08:36] can remember things we say does that
[1:08:37] mean I'm not forgiven no it simply means
[1:08:40] your spirit still has that access to
[1:08:43] memory and you know you can recall
[1:08:45] things that happen to you decades ago
[1:08:47] how is that because the human Spirit has
[1:08:51] that ability and you can imagine then
[1:08:54] each of us as we said here today and we
[1:08:57] recall those things and the Soul
[1:08:59] forgiven the soul Justified and the Soul
[1:09:01] born again and sealed by the presence of
[1:09:04] God oh you say one when we get an end of
[1:09:06] it when God replaces the human spirit
[1:09:09] with your theophany you'll see often is
[1:09:13] what you should have had in the
[1:09:14] beginning that's why the prophet tells
[1:09:16] us that the spirit breaks up when it
[1:09:17] dies so you'll no longer need memory can
[1:09:21] you imagine when you get your yourself
[1:09:22] and you will no longer ever remember one
[1:09:25] bad thing you've ever done because it
[1:09:28] will be taken out of that channel and
[1:09:30] you'll no longer have the capability of
[1:09:33] going down memory lane there is no such
[1:09:36] a thing and it's theophany
[1:09:39] so I guess I would think okay so what
[1:09:43] what made this woman be like this now
[1:09:46] watch you know brother Branham whenever
[1:09:48] he was here he would do exactly the same
[1:09:51] thing and this is one thing that
[1:09:52] separated him from the rest of the
[1:09:55] discerners so-called a lot of them was
[1:09:57] guessing Okay you know uh somebody here
[1:10:00] today has got a pain who don't
[1:10:05] uh somebody's I I feel somebody here in
[1:10:08] the building today is under a lot of
[1:10:10] stress I'll raise my hand first let's
[1:10:12] begin here uh you know and it is more of
[1:10:15] that general term but what made brother
[1:10:17] branham's gifts so unique was that he
[1:10:20] would be able to go into the realm of
[1:10:22] the fourth dimension and be able to see
[1:10:24] things in people's past years and years
[1:10:27] ago and be able to go ahead in time and
[1:10:29] see their future and be able to see
[1:10:32] their present all at the same time just
[1:10:34] in a matter of Split Second to go from
[1:10:35] one to the other to the other and this
[1:10:37] is why the Pentecostal people that love
[1:10:40] gifts they absolutely wanted that gift
[1:10:42] more than anything else but there's only
[1:10:44] one to a generation and the prophet of
[1:10:46] God said your pastor won't do this at
[1:10:49] least if what the angel of the Lord told
[1:10:51] me is true and I believe the angel of
[1:10:53] the Lord told him truth
[1:10:56] well come on no Saturn look at me found
[1:10:58] it now so if God is going to allow the
[1:11:01] ministry of the son of man now there's a
[1:11:05] difference in what brother Branham did
[1:11:06] and what God would show men does God
[1:11:10] show me things yes he does but I'll tell
[1:11:12] you one reason why I don't make a lot of
[1:11:14] the things that God shows me public this
[1:11:16] is the reason because if I do it will
[1:11:20] cause people to gravitate to me
[1:11:23] well don't sit there and look at me
[1:11:25] Google that that's exactly what it does
[1:11:28] it would cause people so God shows me
[1:11:30] things and I deal with it in a more how
[1:11:33] can I say it in a more quiet way that I
[1:11:36] will go to this individual tell them
[1:11:37] this that and the other or talk to them
[1:11:40] and watch and and then do it that way
[1:11:41] instead of doing it on public display
[1:11:44] because I saw all of that in Pentecost
[1:11:46] and I saw what it produces for among
[1:11:48] them A bunch of people well come on
[1:11:50] don't get quiet now Peter was not a
[1:11:53] prophet yet when ananias walks up to
[1:11:56] Peter what does Peter do Peter tells him
[1:11:59] something that him and his wife had
[1:12:01] secretly done you remember the story
[1:12:03] ananas and so far so whenever he did
[1:12:06] that now Peter was not Discerning but
[1:12:08] the spirit of God showed him something
[1:12:10] and yet we don't have any record that
[1:12:13] Peter went on and on and done that again
[1:12:16] and again and again so the Holy Ghost
[1:12:18] can use an individual one time two times
[1:12:21] three times five times but it doesn't
[1:12:23] mean that they are to do that over and
[1:12:26] over again you see that's where that a
[1:12:28] lot of the people got into a rut and
[1:12:31] they felt like once God used them and
[1:12:33] one time in that way they had to
[1:12:35] continuously do it and eventually
[1:12:37] they'll get in the flesh unless it's a
[1:12:40] perfect gift
[1:12:41] so that's what brings such a reproach on
[1:12:44] gifts in the first place well what in
[1:12:47] the world are we doing here this morning
[1:12:48] I was going to preach on gifts but you
[1:12:51] see when when brother Branham came it
[1:12:53] was not just that he had a a little dose
[1:12:57] of what Peter had well the Lord told him
[1:12:59] this no it was the ministry of the son
[1:13:02] of man
[1:13:03] which is Christ himself which is not the
[1:13:07] same thing as discernment now I know
[1:13:10] you'll believe me you don't think I'd
[1:13:12] lie to you but I've said in my study and
[1:13:14] talked to people as I did just this past
[1:13:16] week and as I sit there feeling the
[1:13:18] unction of the Holy Ghost and I sat
[1:13:20] there and talked to some people and when
[1:13:22] I did the Lord led me right down their
[1:13:24] life and I've seen them talking to one
[1:13:26] another and punching one another I knew
[1:13:28] I was writing the channel but I am not
[1:13:31] no prophet and don't expect me to get up
[1:13:33] and start doing that today does he show
[1:13:35] you that he does yes he does but I'm not
[1:13:38] here to draw your attention to me I
[1:13:41] wanted all your attention to Christ the
[1:13:43] word
[1:13:44] so don't get in your mind that God's
[1:13:47] servants are a bunch of ignoramuses and
[1:13:49] God don't lead them yes God leads them
[1:13:51] but they want to make sure what they're
[1:13:53] doing with what gives them well God
[1:13:55] gives them is the right way and brings
[1:13:57] glory to God and not their own flesh
[1:14:00] so brother Bantam was totally different
[1:14:02] now same with the Lord Jesus the Lord
[1:14:04] Jesus he was here as the minister of the
[1:14:06] son of man so it was a Ministry that was
[1:14:09] put on display so that the public would
[1:14:12] be able to see it same with the prophet
[1:14:14] himself so naturally if it's going to be
[1:14:17] the repeat of the son of man it would be
[1:14:19] the same thing then it wouldn't be Jesus
[1:14:21] said uh
[1:14:23] um
[1:14:24] let's see here um you've got a problem
[1:14:27] let me see if I can find it here now
[1:14:30] um uh let's say one minute well you
[1:14:31] you've got an issue um let me see here
[1:14:34] um you're rejected by people that's what
[1:14:36] it is you're rejected by people you
[1:14:38] wouldn't have to be very smart I would
[1:14:40] have to know their Customs if she come
[1:14:42] out to draw water by herself she's
[1:14:44] rejected of all the rest of people
[1:14:47] now watch but when the son of man would
[1:14:51] stand there and wait for the vision the
[1:14:53] vision would unveil what the
[1:14:55] communication channel of this woman now
[1:14:57] watch the same thing in the prophet you
[1:14:59] have a Christian Spirit that's right you
[1:15:01] could have been an Atheist or an Infidel
[1:15:03] but as soon as you walked up and I
[1:15:06] contacted your spirit I seen you as a
[1:15:11] Christian
[1:15:12] isn't it amazing it didn't drag out a
[1:15:14] measure and take measure the length of
[1:15:16] her skirt or he didn't measure the
[1:15:18] length of her hair or you know how often
[1:15:20] do you pray or how many times do you
[1:15:22] read your Bible during the day but what
[1:15:24] was it that witnessed that this was a
[1:15:27] child of God it was her spirit the
[1:15:30] communication channel of this woman now
[1:15:33] every one of us do the same thing that's
[1:15:36] why sometimes you get around people that
[1:15:38] claim to be Christians and you feel
[1:15:40] really really strange how many has ever
[1:15:44] been there and done that you just feel
[1:15:46] really really weird they ain't never
[1:15:47] said nothing yet but you just feel so
[1:15:50] different why the spirit in you clashes
[1:15:53] with the spirit in them now that don't
[1:15:55] mean you're supposed to go around
[1:15:56] Discerning everybody but God's just
[1:15:58] probably letting you know that so you'll
[1:16:00] be good and careful but there's
[1:16:03] something about children of God that
[1:16:05] there is a welcoming because the Holy
[1:16:07] Ghost in you should recognize the Holy
[1:16:10] Ghost In Me our problem is not your Holy
[1:16:13] Ghost not like in my Holy Ghost the
[1:16:15] problem is your flesh don't like mine
[1:16:16] and mine don't like yours
[1:16:18] well praise the Lord
[1:16:20] now watch this again he said the reason
[1:16:22] I talk to you is to merely contact your
[1:16:25] spirit so you understand that the
[1:16:28] microphone is alive you see now what
[1:16:30] she's speaking into the mic and I've got
[1:16:32] to contact your spirit first before I
[1:16:36] can see what's happened
[1:16:39] in your life
[1:16:42] so you imagine when a man would walk up
[1:16:44] into this it would have been a treasure
[1:16:47] Trove of past it would have been a
[1:16:50] treasure Trove of past failures memories
[1:16:54] accomplishments whatever more that God
[1:16:56] would allow because she would lay open
[1:16:59] the life of that individual every bit of
[1:17:01] it stored right there in that human
[1:17:03] spirit and no doubt there were
[1:17:04] predominant things that was there so
[1:17:06] we'd see low spots and he'd see spots
[1:17:08] that really didn't have a major
[1:17:09] significance so he would pull out those
[1:17:12] things that God would show him I see you
[1:17:14] coming home from school you're dressed
[1:17:16] in a yellow check address I see you
[1:17:18] running you fall upon the porch a dog
[1:17:20] gets out to you fall through the door
[1:17:22] you've been had fear all of your whole
[1:17:24] life so what was this a predominant
[1:17:27] something there and it opened up where
[1:17:29] was that story not in This Woman's Soul
[1:17:32] not so much in her body remember the
[1:17:34] woman crossing the railroad track and
[1:17:35] she'd had an affair and the prophet was
[1:17:38] stood down told her what it was she said
[1:17:39] don't say that don't say that I told
[1:17:42] really forgot that ah
[1:17:45] what had happened was the spirit had
[1:17:47] separated that memory from the cells in
[1:17:49] her brain but the spirit still contained
[1:17:52] that channel
[1:17:53] the spirit still contained that channel
[1:17:55] and when the prophet contacted her
[1:17:58] spirit he opened her spirit and went
[1:18:00] straight in that'd been Plum scary if
[1:18:02] he'd had all kind of garbage in there
[1:18:03] wouldn't it
[1:18:04] wow
[1:18:06] but you can't hide it you understand
[1:18:08] it's the way you communicate oh my what
[1:18:13] in the world am I doing here but
[1:18:14] whatever whatever we break into the
[1:18:17] realm of Supernatural I hope you
[1:18:20] understand that right here in this
[1:18:21] building today demons and angels are
[1:18:25] here in this service they're in the
[1:18:27] world every day that we live and we are
[1:18:30] communicating either to light or to
[1:18:33] Darkness from where not just our mouths
[1:18:36] because sometimes our mouths will say
[1:18:37] one thing and our soul our spirit will
[1:18:40] say something else but we are pulsating
[1:18:43] either light or darkness and them demons
[1:18:46] know who you are they don't care how
[1:18:48] much you jump they don't care how high
[1:18:50] you high jump up and down and scream and
[1:18:52] holler and quote the Bible if you don't
[1:18:54] live right they're not afraid of you at
[1:18:56] all but from you as a child of God and
[1:18:59] you've heard the prophet do it over and
[1:19:01] over again that Darkness would follow
[1:19:03] some people like but follow others the
[1:19:05] darkness could follow a person from
[1:19:07] their soul a dark shadow would follow
[1:19:09] another person not from their soul but
[1:19:11] from their flesh and yet he would see
[1:19:14] you are a Christian because I see light
[1:19:16] coming from you and then he tells us of
[1:19:19] course and souls are not souls in prison
[1:19:21] a power prisoner that we are shadows of
[1:19:23] light so when we are born again then
[1:19:26] from our soul emanates what the light
[1:19:28] from the pillar of fire it is that
[1:19:31] portion of God which you are which is
[1:19:33] light meters now in you comes this
[1:19:37] spiritual light as well as the natural
[1:19:39] light that's what makes the x-rays in
[1:19:40] your body and Satan that's what he looks
[1:19:43] at that's what makes him back off you
[1:19:46] say the devil's afraid of me you'll say
[1:19:48] the devil's afraid of mother Daryl Ward
[1:19:50] any other human being you think the
[1:19:52] devil's scared of any of us no matter
[1:19:54] how much we scream it ain't that that
[1:19:56] they look at it's when we speak and they
[1:19:59] see something coming out of our mouth
[1:20:01] that's other than us and they see a lie
[1:20:04] coming out of a child of God
[1:20:06] now watch when the prophet would contact
[1:20:09] him he would contact their spirit and
[1:20:12] then the mystery of the life would
[1:20:15] unfold so he's communicating with this
[1:20:18] channel which is the spirit so looking
[1:20:21] at this woman at the well
[1:20:23] we see that she very very important
[1:20:26] figure in the Bible nameless but very
[1:20:29] important what was it that made her the
[1:20:33] way she was now was she a bad woman
[1:20:36] sexually immoral that choice that she
[1:20:40] simply said I want to live this way I
[1:20:44] want to have one husband and another one
[1:20:46] and another one I don't want no peace in
[1:20:49] life I don't want no home I don't want
[1:20:52] no family I want to be mean mean mean
[1:20:55] mean
[1:21:00] no
[1:21:02] she actually never chose that
[1:21:08] listen to this the prophet says
[1:21:10] probably her parents
[1:21:13] were the delinquent kind
[1:21:16] that let her go poor little girl
[1:21:19] earned her living by a moral living you
[1:21:22] know what I mean
[1:21:23] it's the way she had him making a
[1:21:26] livelihood
[1:21:27] we know it was horrible
[1:21:29] but we're going to think that she was
[1:21:32] turned into that
[1:21:35] because there was something good
[1:21:38] behind the woman
[1:21:41] it proved it
[1:21:43] so she becomes something
[1:21:46] that had more to do with circumstance
[1:21:50] than it had to do choice
[1:21:54] does that make sense to you why because
[1:21:57] when when her channel of communication
[1:22:01] was open and the Lord Jesus shine light
[1:22:03] upon her it helped her to see what she
[1:22:07] really wanted to be
[1:22:10] huh
[1:22:12] notice again poor child
[1:22:14] Maybe by bad parents let out on the
[1:22:18] street and she become a prostitute
[1:22:21] let me tell you there's a lot of bad
[1:22:22] women we know that but you can't have a
[1:22:25] bad woman without them being a bad man
[1:22:28] so there has to be somebody to make
[1:22:32] her bad wow somebody to make her bad and
[1:22:39] sometimes them kids are turned out by a
[1:22:42] bad Mammy
[1:22:44] I mean knows what a mammy is
[1:22:47] some of you don't know what what in the
[1:22:48] world you call your mother
[1:22:51] okay it's Southern for Mama everybody
[1:22:54] with me now so a bad man why is brother
[1:22:57] Branham laying the blame on the parents
[1:23:01] because that's where a lot of it lays
[1:23:04] Y'all Gonna preach to me this morning
[1:23:07] notice this sometimes him kids are
[1:23:09] turned up by a bad Mammy well she runs
[1:23:12] into the bar rooms again he says he come
[1:23:16] to the city in psychar and he sent his
[1:23:19] disciples away to buy videos and the
[1:23:21] little woman came out probably a pretty
[1:23:23] little woman maybe the child was turned
[1:23:26] out on the street by her parents and let
[1:23:30] her go any way about like today they
[1:23:34] talk about juvenile delinquency it's
[1:23:37] parent delinquency that's exactly what
[1:23:40] it is and maybe this child had the same
[1:23:43] thing her mother let her do anything
[1:23:47] and she turned out to be
[1:23:50] an ill-famed woman
[1:23:52] now what does this do to us then about
[1:23:55] our perception of this woman it helps us
[1:23:58] to realize that much of what she had
[1:24:00] become was not just by her being
[1:24:03] stubborn hard-headed but much of what
[1:24:06] she had received as a child uh this one
[1:24:10] Yuri doesn't mention the woman at the
[1:24:12] well but it was so good pertaining to
[1:24:13] the same thing I thought the devil might
[1:24:15] need just a little bit more scorching in
[1:24:18] this so I thought I'd go and Scorch him
[1:24:19] with it we have such juvenile crime wave
[1:24:23] Across the Nation but I really think it
[1:24:27] started in the home what in the world
[1:24:29] would he say about today
[1:24:31] what would he say about a six-year-old
[1:24:33] boy shooting his school teacher what
[1:24:35] would he say about a 12 year old girl
[1:24:37] stabbing her nine-year-old brother what
[1:24:39] would he say about all the crimes that
[1:24:41] even the prosecuting attorneys the
[1:24:43] district attorneys and many of our
[1:24:45] illegal people I saw one the other day
[1:24:48] on YouTube and he was talking about the
[1:24:49] six-year-old boy that shot the teacher
[1:24:51] said we've never even had such a thing
[1:24:53] before in Virginia we don't know where
[1:24:55] to put them we don't know where to put
[1:24:57] them with adults with the juveniles
[1:24:58] Virginia law will not let them try them
[1:25:01] as an adult he said we frankly don't
[1:25:03] know what to do and who's in charge of
[1:25:06] it all people say well they need more
[1:25:08] education well a lot of them is more
[1:25:10] educated than you was and their parents
[1:25:12] lost education will not educate the
[1:25:15] devil out of you
[1:25:17] as a matter of fact sometimes I want to
[1:25:18] put some more educated devil in you so
[1:25:21] what do they need they need a good Mama
[1:25:24] and a good daddy
[1:25:26] well praise the Lord notice the prophet
[1:25:29] said I don't say it would be all over if
[1:25:31] they had that a child raised up in a
[1:25:34] good old-fashioned Godly home but it
[1:25:36] certainly would give that child the
[1:25:38] right kind of influence I think many
[1:25:41] times that the children the homes have
[1:25:43] been brought up they're turned loose on
[1:25:45] the street and live for themselves while
[1:25:47] the mothers in the bar room they don't
[1:25:50] take care of the child another thing
[1:25:52] they don't love it and they don't give
[1:25:55] it affection to take it up it's young
[1:25:58] you've got to teach it to love
[1:26:04] well isn't that automatic
[1:26:06] apparently not you've got to teach it to
[1:26:11] love and listen to this other word and
[1:26:13] respect
[1:26:15] and to read the Bible
[1:26:20] so you're this woman the channel when
[1:26:23] Jesus contacts and that's why brother
[1:26:25] Amanda tell them over and over again you
[1:26:27] couldn't hide your life right now for
[1:26:29] nothing
[1:26:31] it would have been a scary feeling would
[1:26:32] it honor me if you had something to hide
[1:26:34] you're saying said oh my God is Mama
[1:26:35] here is Daddy here is my wife here is
[1:26:38] the husband here do I brought there it
[1:26:40] is your life is laid right open because
[1:26:43] you imagine all that laid inside of
[1:26:45] there how delicate this is why only a
[1:26:48] prophet could be trusted with such a
[1:26:50] gift of this caliber because you say the
[1:26:53] wrong thing when you're under that
[1:26:54] anointing you've just caused a divorce
[1:26:57] you've caused a breakup in the home oh
[1:26:59] you understand me because you see things
[1:27:02] sometimes that you're not even supposed
[1:27:03] to share see things yeah I've
[1:27:06] experienced this with God that's only
[1:27:08] meant for you and the Lord You're not to
[1:27:10] tell everything you go through you're
[1:27:11] not to tell every experience you have
[1:27:13] with God some of those things are for
[1:27:15] you and the Lord only but yet my the
[1:27:17] Lord fine has a hard time trying to find
[1:27:20] anybody that he can deal with that they
[1:27:22] don't want to tell everything and
[1:27:24] anything that he tells them I'll say
[1:27:25] shame on us I'll say one of the reasons
[1:27:28] we don't have more experiences than what
[1:27:29] we do is that we go around bragging to
[1:27:31] everybody we want everybody to know well
[1:27:33] the Lord said this and the Lord said
[1:27:35] that brother Darryl said one time I see
[1:27:37] why the Lord ain't got no time to talk
[1:27:38] to me he's talking to this brother 24 7.
[1:27:41] and he tells this man this and that may
[1:27:43] he ain't got no time my goodness here
[1:27:47] oh
[1:27:49] God wants to find people he can trust
[1:27:54] so this woman had been hurt as a child
[1:28:00] she wasn't taught love that would bear
[1:28:03] record in the amount of time she was
[1:28:05] married
[1:28:07] may seem strange to you but what I've
[1:28:08] found as a pastor counseling many times
[1:28:10] women that have been married and you
[1:28:12] watch them as they'll marry an older man
[1:28:14] many times the age of their father
[1:28:17] and you look at that what in the world
[1:28:19] would that young woman marry that for
[1:28:20] uh-huh look back in their life a little
[1:28:22] bit and you find she's looking for a
[1:28:25] fatherly image
[1:28:26] I've seen it many many times and yet why
[1:28:30] why would it be because something was
[1:28:33] missing and the communication channel of
[1:28:36] that individual is reaching out in the
[1:28:38] channel of what affection
[1:28:41] affection so it was not met many of you
[1:28:45] understand you've had families that way
[1:28:46] and members that you know yourself and
[1:28:49] they come that very same way
[1:28:51] so we look at that Sheba and most of us
[1:28:54] will never be heard in the way that she
[1:28:55] was but yet all of us come to the Earth
[1:28:58] and as we go through our journey we get
[1:29:00] hurt
[1:29:02] one of the most painful hurts is hurt by
[1:29:05] friends
[1:29:06] anybody ever been hurt by friends
[1:29:09] I found the solution
[1:29:11] to never be hurt by friends
[1:29:15] you want the answer
[1:29:16] don't have any
[1:29:21] oh
[1:29:23] but myself I can't live that way
[1:29:28] I can't live without friends and love
[1:29:30] maybe you can maybe you can go back in
[1:29:33] the cave and live it like a Hermit I
[1:29:34] can't I have to be loved and I have to
[1:29:37] love
[1:29:38] I have to have friends and I have to
[1:29:40] show friendship how many understands
[1:29:42] what I'm saying so then when we have
[1:29:44] friends it comes with a risk that one or
[1:29:49] both or all of your friends eventually
[1:29:52] may hurt you and then you're saying I
[1:29:55] wish I'd have never even had them as my
[1:29:57] friend now I'm sure nobody here has ever
[1:29:59] been heard by friends of course except
[1:30:01] for me but yet I'll go ahead and preach
[1:30:03] it for some of these sorry people that
[1:30:05] stream these Services maybe we get to
[1:30:07] the new church all them people that's
[1:30:09] got so many faults will quit streaming
[1:30:11] us so we can just preach about Heavenly
[1:30:13] angels and oh my Great Divine things
[1:30:17] of course and none of y'all wouldn't get
[1:30:19] to come
[1:30:20] and I wouldn't get your boots to you
[1:30:22] because I know I don't live there either
[1:30:25] so when we get hurt by friends or family
[1:30:29] my can be some of the deepest scars that
[1:30:33] we bear
[1:30:34] and our lord Jesus understands that hurt
[1:30:39] in Zechariah 13 6 prophecy speaking of
[1:30:42] him and one shall say unto him what are
[1:30:46] these wounds
[1:30:48] in thy hints
[1:30:50] then he shall answer
[1:30:52] those with which
[1:30:54] I was wounded
[1:30:57] in the house
[1:30:59] of my friends
[1:31:03] imagine the Lord Jesus allowing himself
[1:31:05] to be hurt by friends
[1:31:08] so when you young people would get hurt
[1:31:09] by friends and cry and get your heart
[1:31:12] broke
[1:31:13] you could go to the Lord Jesus and he'd
[1:31:15] say I understand
[1:31:18] I mean he's ever been hurt by friends
[1:31:22] you know David was also hurt by friends
[1:31:27] the thing is when we get hurt what will
[1:31:31] we do with the hurt for many people they
[1:31:34] turn in by that I mean they turn in on
[1:31:38] themselves and they bring their feelings
[1:31:41] their trust the scripture says a brother
[1:31:44] offended is harder to be one than a
[1:31:47] strong City and their contention are
[1:31:50] like the bars of a castle
[1:31:53] so if we ever get hurt deeply what most
[1:31:56] people tend to do is build a wall around
[1:32:00] that part of us and we'll never let
[1:32:03] anybody else ever come that close you
[1:32:06] ever be around people like that and it's
[1:32:08] like you can get so close and they'll
[1:32:10] never let you get any closer well no
[1:32:13] doubt they've been hurt by someone and
[1:32:15] hurt deeply and what you're bumping up
[1:32:17] against is that wall that they have
[1:32:20] around themselves and they think they
[1:32:23] will protect themselves but actually
[1:32:24] they're letting the devil Rob them
[1:32:27] because until that wall comes down
[1:32:30] you'll never be able to love right
[1:32:32] you'll never be able to to be able to
[1:32:34] really relate to others this may
[1:32:36] surprise you but even to God until that
[1:32:40] thing is broken away from your life
[1:32:43] I want you to notice that David had come
[1:32:46] to this trying time in his life after
[1:32:49] the situation with Bathsheba now he's
[1:32:51] been married to her for some time and
[1:32:55] the scripture that we want to read is
[1:32:57] second Samuel 15 2 and it is Absalom and
[1:33:00] you know Absalom is one of David's
[1:33:02] favorite sons and Absalom Rosa pearlian
[1:33:05] Stood Beside the way of the gate and it
[1:33:07] was so that when any man that had a
[1:33:09] controversy came to the king for
[1:33:11] judgment then Absalom called unto him
[1:33:14] and said of what City Art Thou and he
[1:33:17] said thy servant is one of the tribes of
[1:33:19] Israel now watch Absalom was one of the
[1:33:22] king's Sons so he was a prince but yet
[1:33:25] he was not ordained or not anointed by
[1:33:28] God to ever become king you see God did
[1:33:32] not let the children of Israel vote for
[1:33:34] who their king would be as we do in
[1:33:36] politics but God would send the prophet
[1:33:39] and the prophet would anoint him but
[1:33:42] Absalom had this something about him and
[1:33:44] you can read his history course and find
[1:33:46] out there must have been very difficult
[1:33:48] having all these women and having all
[1:33:50] these higher brothers and half-sisters
[1:33:52] and Lord Jesus I'm glad we don't believe
[1:33:54] in polygamy
[1:33:56] now noticing so Absalom has this desire
[1:34:00] in him even though he's not anointed to
[1:34:04] be king and prophetically no Prophet
[1:34:06] ever went to him but he wanted to be
[1:34:10] king
[1:34:11] he wanted to be king
[1:34:14] now watch what he would do so when
[1:34:16] people would come in for the Judgment uh
[1:34:18] this is actually he's been reinstated
[1:34:20] into David's Fellowship after killing
[1:34:23] his brother amnon
[1:34:24] then he starts to stand outside
[1:34:28] near The City Gate
[1:34:30] when a person would come in and say what
[1:34:32] were you from I'm from Elizabethton um
[1:34:35] I'm from Johnson City I'm from Gray
[1:34:38] and he would say and Absalom said unto
[1:34:40] him see thy matters are good and right
[1:34:44] but there is no man deputed which means
[1:34:47] set up in position of deputed of the
[1:34:52] king to heresy now watch what he's doing
[1:34:55] and Absalom said moreover all that I
[1:35:00] were made judge in the land now watch
[1:35:03] what he's going to do
[1:35:05] oh that our May judge in the land that
[1:35:10] every man which hath a suit or a cause
[1:35:13] might come to me and I would do him
[1:35:17] Justice
[1:35:20] yeah he's running for president
[1:35:22] that's a politician right there if I
[1:35:24] ever heard one now what does he do he
[1:35:27] appeals to that part of that Humanity
[1:35:31] which wants to be recognized personally
[1:35:34] by leaders
[1:35:37] that's something in humanity that wants
[1:35:41] that something to be identified so
[1:35:43] here's Prince Absalom and he's standing
[1:35:46] out there at the gate now more than
[1:35:48] likely you didn't see David how tall
[1:35:49] because David was so busy and had so
[1:35:51] much going so here Absalom saw this
[1:35:54] window that was open I remember still
[1:35:56] dealing with a lot of pain a lot of
[1:35:58] anxiety David was from all that he went
[1:36:00] through so whenever he would come
[1:36:03] through he said oh I wish that I could
[1:36:05] be a judge oh I'll tell you one thing if
[1:36:08] I could be that boy how I would help
[1:36:10] God's people
[1:36:12] I'm telling you what I I would just do
[1:36:15] such great things and I would do him
[1:36:17] Justice now watch verse five and it was
[1:36:20] so that when any man came now to him to
[1:36:22] do obeisance so this is the prince now
[1:36:25] so this is what you do you would come up
[1:36:27] and you would do obeisance to the prince
[1:36:29] but watch what Prince Charming does
[1:36:33] he put forth his hand and took him
[1:36:37] and kissed him
[1:36:39] so now here they are they're coming up
[1:36:41] to the prince to bow to the prince but
[1:36:44] the prince grabs them by hand so brother
[1:36:46] Johnson comes up and he grabs him and
[1:36:48] and instead of him allowing him to Bow
[1:36:51] oh no Absalom reaches and grabs him and
[1:36:54] says come here my brother
[1:36:56] encase him on the side of the face
[1:36:58] wow can you imagine going home telling
[1:37:01] your mama can you imagine going back to
[1:37:04] your little insignificant Village you've
[1:37:07] never even shook David's hand your whole
[1:37:09] life you've never even have a personal
[1:37:11] talk with David but here Absalom shook
[1:37:15] your hand and wouldn't even let you bow
[1:37:17] before him and stopped you oh my
[1:37:21] that appeals to this right here
[1:37:26] and all you dear little angels that are
[1:37:28] with us today you pardon me while I'll
[1:37:29] speak to some of these sorry outfits of
[1:37:31] streaming that's probably some of them
[1:37:34] down in South Africa and over in
[1:37:35] Switzerland and you know some of them
[1:37:37] portal things over there they're not
[1:37:39] Blessed Like Us Americans with so much
[1:37:41] humility
[1:37:46] now notice what the Bible says and on
[1:37:48] this manner did Absalom to all Israel
[1:37:54] that came to the king for judgment
[1:37:57] so Absalom
[1:37:59] stole
[1:38:01] stole
[1:38:03] stole
[1:38:05] the hearts
[1:38:07] of the men of Israel now let me just
[1:38:09] make sure that you understand
[1:38:11] Absalom is not just a preacher type
[1:38:15] Absalom can be one in your own family
[1:38:19] Absalom can be just about anybody
[1:38:22] but they begin to speak words smooth as
[1:38:25] butter
[1:38:26] David said
[1:38:28] how many of our girls have been polluted
[1:38:30] by some sorry outfit boy that didn't
[1:38:33] even want to live right and didn't want
[1:38:34] to come to church well go ahead and
[1:38:35] preach brother Donnie Amazon long enough
[1:38:38] to get him married and then wound up
[1:38:39] pulling them out of church
[1:38:43] now notice what he does and Absalom sent
[1:38:47] for
[1:38:49] a hither verse 12.
[1:38:52] the gilanite David's counselor
[1:38:55] from his City even from guylo where he
[1:38:59] offered sacrifices and the conspiracy
[1:39:02] was strong
[1:39:05] for the people increased continually
[1:39:09] with Absalom
[1:39:11] this never ceases to amaze me how dumb
[1:39:16] people can be
[1:39:21] you got to be kidding me
[1:39:24] man had not been anointed this man had
[1:39:27] not been approved by God
[1:39:31] and yet this is growing and growing and
[1:39:34] growing
[1:39:36] and then we find this man by the name of
[1:39:40] the hisophile
[1:39:42] anybody remember who he is
[1:39:46] bathsheba's grandfather
[1:39:49] oh
[1:39:52] now you wonder if he's got an agenda
[1:39:57] personal something
[1:39:59] against
[1:40:02] I was laying on the bed this morning a
[1:40:04] few minutes after three and unable to go
[1:40:06] back to sleep
[1:40:07] and I began to think about bathsheb and
[1:40:09] I thought my goodness poor woman here
[1:40:11] she goes again back into this other
[1:40:14] stage of trauma in her life
[1:40:18] that her husband is now going to be
[1:40:20] driven from Jerusalem
[1:40:23] this Rebellion got so great started with
[1:40:27] the northern tribes
[1:40:28] and it got so great against God's
[1:40:31] anointed king
[1:40:33] now watch David A True True man that
[1:40:37] loved God and loved his people now this
[1:40:39] is after his mistake remember
[1:40:41] that David said instead of causing
[1:40:45] Israel to fight
[1:40:47] and defied the Kingdom of Israel
[1:40:50] I'll just leave
[1:40:54] that's a real man
[1:40:56] I'll just leave so David gets his
[1:40:59] counselors that he gets his soldiers
[1:41:01] those that are personal bodyguards his
[1:41:03] mercenaries and he gets those and he
[1:41:06] gets his families wives and David starts
[1:41:08] to leave in order to keep peace and keep
[1:41:12] people from dying
[1:41:17] so here goes poor Bathsheba
[1:41:21] now she hears her grandfather
[1:41:24] has joined with Absalom
[1:41:30] oh my goodness so here she goes again
[1:41:33] now another part and some of you all
[1:41:35] thought you all had the most drama in
[1:41:37] your life
[1:41:41] notice what the Bible says then
[1:41:44] the hearts of the men of Israel are
[1:41:46] after Absalom so there comes a messenger
[1:41:49] in verse 13 and tells David the hearts
[1:41:52] of the men of Israel are after Absalom
[1:41:56] verse 31 and one told David
[1:42:02] saying I hit the fell
[1:42:05] is among the conspirators
[1:42:09] was Absalom
[1:42:12] now if it wasn't bad enough
[1:42:16] that David's own son
[1:42:19] is causing this revolt
[1:42:22] one of David's closest friends
[1:42:25] one of David's closest advisors
[1:42:30] joins in the Rebellion
[1:42:34] which is his wife's
[1:42:36] grandfather
[1:42:39] so how are you going to go home at night
[1:42:41] and talk about that
[1:42:46] now if your wife is your best friend you
[1:42:47] talk to her just about everything don't
[1:42:49] you well you got to have somebody to
[1:42:51] talk about cramps about
[1:42:54] so you imagine how David David don't get
[1:42:57] me going don't get me now you know I
[1:42:59] love him and you know that I think so
[1:43:00] much of him but you have to wonder what
[1:43:03] his agenda was this man was a powerful
[1:43:08] influence and sway over the children of
[1:43:11] Israel
[1:43:13] an Absalom sent for him
[1:43:20] can it go on
[1:43:23] I'm glad you said that because I was
[1:43:24] going to anyway but it's just not sure
[1:43:26] when y'all
[1:43:29] now watch all my children
[1:43:33] and one told David saying a hissa fell
[1:43:36] is among the conspirators with Absalom
[1:43:40] how do you and I respond
[1:43:45] if such things would happen to us
[1:43:48] pray after this service
[1:43:51] we'll respond this way
[1:43:53] and David said that's sorry dog I'll
[1:43:57] hang him I'll do this and that and the
[1:43:59] other I'll never let him live it I'll
[1:44:01] tell you one thing go get him somebody
[1:44:03] go get him
[1:44:06] and David said oh Lord
[1:44:10] I pray you see
[1:44:13] turn the Council of a hit the fell
[1:44:17] into
[1:44:18] foolishness now this news comes notice
[1:44:22] how it's synchronized
[1:44:24] the greatest trial
[1:44:26] of his life
[1:44:29] David has already lost an element of his
[1:44:31] Prestige his honor his respect because
[1:44:34] of his adultery
[1:44:38] now his own son
[1:44:40] is Raising in revolt against him
[1:44:44] have you ever noticed when it rains
[1:44:48] it pours
[1:44:51] so you get one bit of bad news and you
[1:44:54] think well I'm glad that's over there
[1:44:56] whoops here comes more and there's
[1:44:58] another you imagine David is so
[1:45:00] distraught and he said God what have I
[1:45:03] done Lord will I never pay will this
[1:45:06] never stop please help me
[1:45:09] and then somebody comes and tells him oh
[1:45:12] yes I fell
[1:45:14] John Lewis
[1:45:16] oh no not him
[1:45:20] he was one of my dearest
[1:45:23] closest
[1:45:25] friends
[1:45:31] what I find so amazing about this is
[1:45:34] David's reaction to this
[1:45:38] was divine
[1:45:40] so it's a reaction to the bad news
[1:45:46] now this prayer to you may sound very
[1:45:48] selfish but David is thinking not so
[1:45:51] much about himself
[1:45:53] as he is the kingdom he then sees what
[1:45:55] pain what reproach he's brought upon the
[1:45:58] body
[1:45:59] he don't want to be the cause again
[1:46:00] Harry
[1:46:01] for more to come God may his counsel
[1:46:05] turn to foolishness
[1:46:07] listen to the contents of that prayer
[1:46:09] this is the exact opposite of what this
[1:46:12] man was famous for
[1:46:14] this man was known
[1:46:16] for his counsel it was so precise so
[1:46:21] perfect
[1:46:23] albeit God answered
[1:46:26] his prayer
[1:46:30] I figure most of us would be a whole lot
[1:46:32] better off
[1:46:33] if we'd spend less time on Facebook
[1:46:36] and spend more time with our face in the
[1:46:38] book
[1:46:43] praying for our enemies pray for them
[1:46:45] that despitefully use us turn the other
[1:46:47] cheek if they sue you for your coat give
[1:46:49] them your shirt give me britches if they
[1:46:51] want them just be sure you got some more
[1:46:52] to put off they want you serious go
[1:46:54] ahead and give them your Colossus at the
[1:46:56] same time but instead if we're not
[1:46:58] careful we think of resent and revenge
[1:47:01] on how we can get even with them well
[1:47:04] I'm gonna go ahead and preach amen this
[1:47:05] is really helpful but
[1:47:07] now you know it's amazing because the
[1:47:10] people for whom remember David had
[1:47:13] fought for these people
[1:47:15] how many times had David risked his life
[1:47:18] in battle for these people and they
[1:47:21] turned from David
[1:47:23] and go to this egotistical leader
[1:47:27] which God has never approved
[1:47:33] oh my goodness
[1:47:37] notice oh my
[1:47:41] his prayer God turn his counsel
[1:47:44] into foolishness
[1:47:47] in others heard
[1:47:50] by the Queen of Scotland I found this I
[1:47:54] thought it's so interesting I want to
[1:47:55] read it to you
[1:47:56] that she feared more feared
[1:48:00] the prayers of John Knox
[1:48:03] which was a preacher
[1:48:06] of the Presbyterian move
[1:48:08] she feared the prayers of John Knox
[1:48:13] more than any army she had ever faced
[1:48:20] [Laughter]
[1:48:22] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:48:25] righteous man
[1:48:28] availeth much
[1:48:30] can have a few more minutes
[1:48:33] I don't know if you're aware of this or
[1:48:34] not but Psalms 41 9 turn that we'll read
[1:48:39] there
[1:48:40] also Psalms 55 12
[1:48:44] are written
[1:48:46] along this same Avenue
[1:48:49] speaking of a hitherfell
[1:48:53] notices Psalm 41 9. now both of these
[1:48:57] also have a compound meaning or a double
[1:49:00] fulfillment in that they was fulfilled
[1:49:03] in David but also in the Lord Jesus this
[1:49:07] is a Messianic Psalm here verse 9 41 9.
[1:49:12] yay my own familiar friend
[1:49:16] in whom I trusted which did eat of my
[1:49:20] bread
[1:49:22] hath lifted up his heel against me of
[1:49:24] course speaking of a hysterophile but
[1:49:27] also speaking
[1:49:28] of Judas
[1:49:30] and I dare say probably speaking of some
[1:49:33] of you
[1:49:35] someone or more than one someone that
[1:49:37] you've loved and fellowshipped
[1:49:40] and maybe you confide it in
[1:49:42] and shared things that you thought was a
[1:49:45] dear friend
[1:49:46] and come to find out they told that
[1:49:48] secret of yours
[1:49:50] and it devastated you
[1:49:52] left you to worry you're not even sure
[1:49:54] you can trust anybody anymore
[1:49:58] well I'll tell you depends on what you
[1:50:01] do with these hurts
[1:50:02] and these scars
[1:50:04] you can let them control you
[1:50:07] or you by the spirit of God can control
[1:50:09] them and tell them they are not your
[1:50:12] master
[1:50:14] they are not your God they are not your
[1:50:16] lord nor your king
[1:50:19] notice again same context different
[1:50:21] verse chapter and verse Psalm 55 12. for
[1:50:25] it was not an enemy that reproached me
[1:50:29] then I could have borne it
[1:50:32] Now watch how David deals with the
[1:50:34] contrast if it would have been a moabite
[1:50:38] or a Philistine such as Goliath that
[1:50:41] would have cursed me by his gods
[1:50:44] if it would have been a mower by a
[1:50:46] person if it had been an ammonite if it
[1:50:49] had been somebody like that he said if
[1:50:51] it was not an enemy that reproached me
[1:50:53] then could I have borne it neither was
[1:50:56] it he that hated me
[1:50:59] that didn't magnify himself against me I
[1:51:03] would have hid myself from him
[1:51:07] you see that's exactly what David had
[1:51:09] done when Saul come against him he hid
[1:51:12] himself because all that made him an
[1:51:15] enemy David
[1:51:17] when the Lord Jesus in The Book of John
[1:51:19] when the Pharisees had come to get the
[1:51:22] Lord Jesus and what did he do the Bible
[1:51:24] says Jesus just walked right among them
[1:51:27] somehow it disappeared or put a veil
[1:51:29] over them well they couldn't see him and
[1:51:31] he walked right among them right through
[1:51:33] them and they never even knew he was
[1:51:34] there and David said had it been
[1:51:36] somebody like that I would have just
[1:51:38] simply hid myself
[1:51:40] and if it didn't matter scribe or a
[1:51:43] Pharisee or in a scene the Lord Jesus
[1:51:45] could have hit himself but how do you
[1:51:48] hide from one who knows where you pray
[1:51:58] but do you ever find Jesus on the throne
[1:52:01] or in the book of Acts
[1:52:03] going through all of this about how sad
[1:52:06] he was and how depressed he was and how
[1:52:09] down he was because Judas betrayed him
[1:52:15] it's amazing when you said to this if
[1:52:17] you'd like to read it sometimes in
[1:52:18] Psalms 52. David's presence and knob
[1:52:22] had been disclosed to Saul by doing the
[1:52:26] Edomite in Psalm 54 David had been
[1:52:30] betrayed by the people of zip z-i-p-h
[1:52:34] by his own countrymen
[1:52:37] so what we're leading up to is Psalm 52
[1:52:39] Psalm 54 and then we come to the
[1:52:42] ultimate betrayal which is Psalm 55
[1:52:45] which is the Betrayal of an intimate
[1:52:49] friend look friend whenever you and I
[1:52:52] look at this today we have to realize we
[1:52:55] are all subject to such things as this
[1:52:58] the question is will it happen it's when
[1:53:02] will it happen
[1:53:04] and what will we do about it when it
[1:53:07] does
[1:53:10] I wish my Lord in life
[1:53:13] was not to be a preacher
[1:53:16] I wish my lot and life
[1:53:19] if I had to be a preacher
[1:53:21] would have been one like some of my
[1:53:24] brothers
[1:53:26] where you could preach
[1:53:28] all kinds of sermons and wind up not
[1:53:31] making too many people mad I really
[1:53:33] don't understand that feeling
[1:53:35] must be blissful must be very happy
[1:53:39] my lot in life
[1:53:41] as a preacher I was given a big long
[1:53:46] sharp sword
[1:53:48] sharp on both sides
[1:53:50] so it cuts you and me at the same time
[1:53:54] I was given a lot in life which was not
[1:53:57] one desired
[1:53:59] but one controversial
[1:54:04] I've been hurt I've been run down I've
[1:54:06] been cast out by my friends
[1:54:09] I've stood at times in this message what
[1:54:12] if it wasn't for the local Brothers of
[1:54:14] our church or their preacher would even
[1:54:16] speak to me preachers wouldn't even call
[1:54:18] me from meetings ain't been that many
[1:54:20] years ago that they all quit calling me
[1:54:22] for meetings huh
[1:54:25] so how many of them do you hate today
[1:54:27] brother Donnie
[1:54:29] none
[1:54:31] why I refused for that to control me
[1:54:36] come on children
[1:54:37] I refuse for what people do to me to let
[1:54:41] me control that I am going to control it
[1:54:44] as a Son of God Amen
[1:54:47] I'm not standing you're telling you
[1:54:49] something today that is an impossibility
[1:54:50] I'm sending you to telling you something
[1:54:53] that is a personal victory for me over
[1:54:55] and over and over again
[1:54:59] oh my can you imagine as David walks
[1:55:03] into this watch this
[1:55:05] he writes about the same situation with
[1:55:08] a hippophil I'm down in verse 20. he
[1:55:11] hath put forth his hands against such as
[1:55:13] be at peace with him
[1:55:16] my friend has put forth I was at peace
[1:55:19] with him I had no no war with him and
[1:55:22] David said you know look what he's done
[1:55:24] with me
[1:55:25] he's broken his Covenant
[1:55:28] the words of his mouth were smoother
[1:55:31] than butter
[1:55:32] but war was in his heart his words were
[1:55:36] softer than oil
[1:55:38] this old boy made a good politician
[1:55:40] wouldn't he yeah they were drawn swords
[1:55:44] boy boy isn't that amazing it takes the
[1:55:46] Holy Ghost to help us whenever a peoples
[1:55:48] better in their words and all in their
[1:55:50] words and the spirit of God lets you
[1:55:52] hear as he goes
[1:55:54] say I don't think olive oil does that I
[1:55:57] don't think butter does that whenever
[1:55:58] you go to drawing it from the stick does
[1:56:00] it but this man's words
[1:56:02] so smooth
[1:56:05] it has a fail
[1:56:07] such were the words
[1:56:09] of a hisfl such were the words of Judas
[1:56:13] when he comes and grabs the door to
[1:56:16] heaven and says hail master
[1:56:20] and kiss the door
[1:56:22] to heaven
[1:56:24] and went to hell
[1:56:31] verse 12. we'll wind up here just
[1:56:34] momentary
[1:56:35] for it was not an enemy that reproached
[1:56:37] me
[1:56:38] then I could have borne it neither was
[1:56:40] it he that hated me
[1:56:43] that didn't magnify himself against me
[1:56:46] then I would have hid myself from him
[1:56:51] but it was thou
[1:56:53] a man mind equal
[1:56:58] my guide the Hebrew word there is aloof
[1:57:02] which means my intimate friend
[1:57:06] my guide
[1:57:08] mine acquaintance
[1:57:11] we took sweet counsel together
[1:57:15] we walked into the house of God I mean
[1:57:18] this is somebody you went to church with
[1:57:20] he's like if you could trust anybody you
[1:57:22] could trust her
[1:57:23] she was a good sister she loved the Lord
[1:57:25] and yet look how she hurts you
[1:57:29] this young man always a fine Christian
[1:57:31] often asked him up to pray and oh he
[1:57:33] wind up hurting you so deeply and you
[1:57:35] went to church together and you sang
[1:57:37] together in the youth choir
[1:57:40] how could he do that
[1:57:44] we took sweet counsel together and
[1:57:47] walked into the house of God
[1:57:49] in company
[1:57:52] oh David
[1:57:54] what are you going to do
[1:57:57] any all remember the end of athel
[1:58:01] now this story goes on
[1:58:04] you see for those who joined in this
[1:58:08] Rebellion
[1:58:09] their end
[1:58:11] was not good
[1:58:13] because they were standing against God's
[1:58:16] anointed king now maybe Absalom said my
[1:58:19] daddy come out of the Daughtry glory to
[1:58:20] God it ain't right
[1:58:21] maybe hisself got up and he took his
[1:58:24] text I'd like to preach tonight on an
[1:58:26] adulterous King and I want to tell you
[1:58:29] God don't go along and okay can I get to
[1:58:31] it amen somebody say amen glory to God I
[1:58:35] never did like David no hell I'll tell
[1:58:37] you one thing is too big for his
[1:58:39] britches he's King this and King died he
[1:58:41] can sing he can shout he can jump he can
[1:58:44] do all them thinking man after God's Own
[1:58:46] Heart yeah right
[1:58:52] so there was another counselor called
[1:58:54] who shy
[1:58:56] who shy came to David and bowed before
[1:58:58] him and said oh my king let me go with
[1:59:00] you he said who shall I will you serve
[1:59:02] the King was all in my heart my
[1:59:05] allegiance belongs to you
[1:59:07] he said then I want you to go back to
[1:59:09] the court of Absalom
[1:59:12] and be one of his counselors oh great
[1:59:14] king no no I cannot do that I cannot do
[1:59:17] that you will be my counselor
[1:59:20] and you will confound what is it God
[1:59:24] setting up the answer to David's prayer
[1:59:29] so ahithophel gives advice
[1:59:31] who shy comes back with opposite advice
[1:59:34] and the hitherphale realizes his days
[1:59:42] remember the end
[1:59:44] remember the end
[1:59:46] he hangs himself
[1:59:54] what a terrible way to die
[1:59:56] your legacy right
[1:59:59] down through history
[2:00:01] he's been preached as this betrayer
[2:00:06] and taken his life
[2:00:08] couldn't forgive
[2:00:10] couldn't forgive David for his wrong
[2:00:13] held a grudge held an alt
[2:00:18] but look at David
[2:00:20] prays
[2:00:22] there's one thing about David he had
[2:00:24] plenty of mistakes but you got to admit
[2:00:25] it that God knew how to repent
[2:00:29] don't you want to know how to repent
[2:00:42] [Applause]
[2:00:49] thank you brother Terry
[2:00:56] now friends the question is this
[2:00:58] all of that being said to come to this
[2:01:02] what will you do
[2:01:04] but the Lord what will you do
[2:01:07] what will you do brother Matthew
[2:01:09] what will your sisters do
[2:01:12] when people hurt you
[2:01:13] turn against you
[2:01:16] run you down say things is not even true
[2:01:20] will you pray for him like David did
[2:01:22] will you pray are you more concerned
[2:01:24] about the message body and the church
[2:01:27] body are you concerned about your own
[2:01:29] agenda
[2:01:33] oh may God help us
[2:01:36] wounded in the house
[2:01:39] of our friends
[2:01:42] can you imagine as David whenever the
[2:01:44] news comes to him a Runner comes
[2:01:48] it winds up in a war
[2:01:50] division comes the tribes divide
[2:01:53] David is out of Jerusalem now Absalom
[2:01:56] goes into the concubines lays with the
[2:01:58] concubines
[2:01:59] then they rally and they start a war
[2:02:02] remember it was Absalom that started the
[2:02:05] war against David
[2:02:08] not wise
[2:02:10] you don't attack an anointed servant of
[2:02:13] God
[2:02:14] think you'll ever get ahead
[2:02:17] you are cutting your own throat
[2:02:20] touch not mine anointed
[2:02:24] and do my prophets no harm
[2:02:27] but somehow Absalom thinks he can do it
[2:02:32] remember they send them out
[2:02:34] joab Abner here comes all the Army
[2:02:37] coming out and David says watch the
[2:02:38] young man watch single men be careful be
[2:02:40] careful don't Spanish life
[2:02:44] to remember he got had real thick bushy
[2:02:47] hair
[2:02:49] and went riding on the back of his mule
[2:02:52] and he got his hair hung in the branches
[2:02:55] of the oak
[2:02:57] when they come up they find him hanging
[2:02:59] there by his hair
[2:03:03] they don't come and spare him
[2:03:06] they don't come and give him Grace
[2:03:08] but each one of them take their sword
[2:03:10] and RAM it
[2:03:13] in him till his blood gushes out and
[2:03:15] covers the ground
[2:03:17] what a terrible thing
[2:03:21] here comes a runner telling David David
[2:03:24] how goes the battle how what about the
[2:03:26] young man absent what about the other I
[2:03:28] don't know I don't know I left and
[2:03:29] they're still fighting another one
[2:03:30] coming what about absolute oh may all
[2:03:32] the enemies of my Lord the king
[2:03:40] David Goes to the gate
[2:03:43] starts weeping
[2:03:44] howling
[2:03:46] Absalom Absalom my son
[2:03:50] my son
[2:03:52] what to God I died for thee
[2:03:58] yeah
[2:03:59] you see even when he'd done wrong
[2:04:02] and the wrath of God turned on him David
[2:04:05] wasn't dancing God I got rid of that
[2:04:08] devil
[2:04:10] his heart
[2:04:12] is broken
[2:04:18] I love it when we Rejoice I love it when
[2:04:20] we cry
[2:04:21] I love it when we shout and run
[2:04:24] but this right here will be my favorite
[2:04:26] time
[2:04:27] when Word of Life Church
[2:04:29] can come to a spot
[2:04:31] that we will not rejoice when our
[2:04:33] enemies fall
[2:04:36] no matter if they've stole money from
[2:04:37] you they've called you alive or whatever
[2:04:39] it is they've done but you will feel
[2:04:41] like David
[2:04:42] you'll say I hope they made peace
[2:04:45] with God
[2:04:47] then you know what friends is your
[2:04:48] pastor
[2:04:49] I'll say Lord that's how to serve an
[2:04:51] apartment peace I believe it's time for
[2:04:52] me to sit down
[2:04:53] I believe I can retire not alive I'm 66
[2:04:56] years old how long do I have to preach
[2:04:58] you know what they say they do to old
[2:05:00] old preachers don't you they put them
[2:05:01] out to Pastor
[2:05:04] no pun intended
[2:05:08] oh no we're getting close to a body
[2:05:10] change when we can love our enemies we
[2:05:14] can pray for them that keep us awake
[2:05:20] and we don't pray for wraths inventions
[2:05:24] what we'll do will you do with your
[2:05:26] scars
[2:05:27] woman at the well
[2:05:30] what will you do with your scars Little
[2:05:32] David
[2:05:34] this valerians together
[2:05:40] help us Lord
[2:05:44] have a lot to be remembered today before
[2:05:46] the Lord God bless your hearts
[2:05:52] look friends I know
[2:05:55] it can be so tough
[2:05:57] people run you down talk about you you
[2:05:59] just don't understand why they do I know
[2:06:01] it can be tough
[2:06:03] but whatever you do don't let that thing
[2:06:05] destroy you
[2:06:06] people don't treat you right
[2:06:09] it's just amazing to me how Christians
[2:06:11] will take your say and repeat it
[2:06:14] and don't even go to the person that's
[2:06:16] being accused and ask them the truth of
[2:06:17] it
[2:06:18] it's unbelievable the lies that people
[2:06:20] have told on me through the years and
[2:06:22] very few people have had enough respect
[2:06:24] for you to even ask you theirself
[2:06:28] do you understand as you respect God's
[2:06:30] servants so your Prophet said
[2:06:32] as you respect God's servant that's the
[2:06:35] way you respect God
[2:06:39] so if you receive a lie against the
[2:06:40] servant of God you're receiving one
[2:06:42] against God
[2:06:44] not just preachers but let's bring it on
[2:06:46] down to the body men women boys girls
[2:06:50] no wonder James said be swift to hear
[2:06:52] slow to speak
[2:06:55] slow to Wrath
[2:06:57] oh Hallelujah
[2:07:01] thank you Lord
[2:07:04] thank you Lord
[2:07:07] thank you Lord Jesus
[2:07:10] Heavenly Father
[2:07:14] I'm sure if
[2:07:17] our Spirits have been opened today by
[2:07:19] the great discerner
[2:07:22] we don't need Psychology to try to
[2:07:25] sit down and open us up and we know
[2:07:27] that's what psychologists do they use
[2:07:30] the psyche the psyche is the mind the
[2:07:33] prophet tells us
[2:07:35] so they open up things about us and they
[2:07:37] want to figure out this and that and the
[2:07:39] other
[2:07:40] that's what therapists will do they'll
[2:07:43] try to figure out where do we get these
[2:07:45] scars and why do you have that
[2:07:46] resentment of this and that and the
[2:07:48] other
[2:07:49] and for some it only makes it worse
[2:07:51] because they open it up and then they
[2:07:53] ain't got the answer to help cure it
[2:07:56] so for some of our sisters if I've heard
[2:07:58] it before who went to some of these and
[2:08:01] they're going to ask them why do you
[2:08:02] wear them dresses
[2:08:03] why do you go about that long hair
[2:08:06] some of these therapists here in Johnson
[2:08:08] City have told some of them they need to
[2:08:10] cut their hair
[2:08:11] and get rid of them dresses and get them
[2:08:13] some pants
[2:08:15] and they don't need to obey their
[2:08:17] husbands no more
[2:08:19] but Lord God we don't want to open
[2:08:21] spirits today and give psychology
[2:08:25] or intellectual speeches
[2:08:27] but may the Holy Ghost go down in each
[2:08:30] wounded hurt person today Father
[2:08:34] bring healing to his Jesus
[2:08:38] oh Lord God I pray father
[2:08:42] how many emails and texts
[2:08:45] have I got in the last few weeks
[2:08:48] of people from different parts of the
[2:08:50] world who've been carrying things for 10
[2:08:53] 15 20 years
[2:08:57] and the word has set them free
[2:09:00] oh Jesus
[2:09:03] contact my spirit Lord
[2:09:06] contact the spirit of your bride today
[2:09:10] heal us Lord
[2:09:13] heal us of our desires to get even with
[2:09:17] people or revenge or
[2:09:19] jealousy or hatred
[2:09:23] help us father I pray
[2:09:26] oh Lord some of these in life if they
[2:09:28] would have had a choice
[2:09:30] they would have no doubt chosen easier
[2:09:33] past than what they walked
[2:09:36] some of them have been abused
[2:09:38] or just physically maybe mentally
[2:09:40] psychologically verbally
[2:09:44] oh Lord God may you touch everheart
[2:09:46] today I pray
[2:09:49] Jesus we know that we'll always remember
[2:09:51] these things that's been done to us
[2:09:55] but we believe you can so heal us
[2:09:58] father that it'll no longer stir up
[2:10:01] anger
[2:10:04] Lord when we were just little kids and
[2:10:07] mama had packed us a little picnic to go
[2:10:11] out behind the house
[2:10:13] for a picnic in the woods
[2:10:16] we'd been through those woods many times
[2:10:18] but little did we know we would
[2:10:20] encounter a stranger there that day
[2:10:23] that would change our lives
[2:10:26] that stranger was a four-legged stranger
[2:10:29] a rabid Fox
[2:10:31] as it started running up and down the
[2:10:33] hills and
[2:10:35] knocked him out in Harry's little sister
[2:10:37] down Kim
[2:10:39] started nibbling on her arms
[2:10:43] and Lord me being the oldest I felt it
[2:10:46] was my
[2:10:47] responsibility to protect her saw
[2:10:50] grabbed a little pocket knife out of my
[2:10:52] pocket and
[2:10:54] started after that fox
[2:10:57] and he grabbed me by the hand and laid
[2:11:00] my hand wide open
[2:11:02] my hands started pouring the blood and
[2:11:05] my hand went numb
[2:11:07] my siblings took off running and
[2:11:10] I'll come up behind the last one because
[2:11:13] the fox was still there running around
[2:11:16] terrified scared to death
[2:11:20] but yet Lord
[2:11:22] I still have that right hand today that
[2:11:24] that fox bit so many years ago
[2:11:27] but I'm so glad that wound has not been
[2:11:29] open
[2:11:31] all those years since I was 10 or 11
[2:11:33] years old something like that nobody
[2:11:36] would want to be around me if that was
[2:11:38] an open wound
[2:11:40] I told my mom and dad as we were going
[2:11:42] to the doctor that day
[2:11:45] if I go mad mama
[2:11:47] please don't let me bite none of the
[2:11:49] kids
[2:11:51] because our grandmother mom had told me
[2:11:53] a story Harry remembers it well
[2:11:56] about a person that had rabies
[2:12:00] and they had to chain the individual to
[2:12:02] a bed
[2:12:03] because they went out of their mind
[2:12:06] so that formed a fear in me
[2:12:10] so here I am the little boy bit by rabid
[2:12:13] Fox
[2:12:15] I know they wouldn't be able to relate
[2:12:16] to it maybe but something similar I
[2:12:19] could see myself
[2:12:21] chained to a bed with a chained
[2:12:25] and I asked my mom and dad please don't
[2:12:27] let me bite the kids because I was
[2:12:29] afraid I was going mad
[2:12:32] So Stories affect us
[2:12:35] things we hear things we learn things we
[2:12:37] go through
[2:12:39] but now Lord as I have my left hand
[2:12:43] stroking across that part of my right
[2:12:45] hand
[2:12:46] what I feel is not blood
[2:12:49] what I feel is not an open gash
[2:12:52] what I feel is a scar
[2:12:55] that Dr mccarg sewed up years and years
[2:12:58] ago
[2:13:01] and I remember seeing that doctor a very
[2:13:03] Gruff type of a man
[2:13:06] as he sewed up my hand the tears
[2:13:09] trickled out of his eyes and fell down
[2:13:11] on my hand
[2:13:14] we had to go to his house every day for
[2:13:16] 14 days to get shots in our stomach
[2:13:19] to keep us from going mad
[2:13:23] oh Dr Jesus
[2:13:26] we want to bring our scars up to you
[2:13:29] today
[2:13:30] wounds from Friends wounds from families
[2:13:34] we don't want to go mad as it were
[2:13:37] we see what Satan's doing to the world
[2:13:41] we don't want to be changed
[2:13:44] with chains of Darkness
[2:13:48] Dr Jesus
[2:13:51] we're coming to your house
[2:13:55] hey didn't get bit so they thought Harry
[2:13:57] was okay so the doctor began to ask was
[2:13:59] anybody else a bit we said no no
[2:14:02] said did anybody else have an open wound
[2:14:04] and Harry Had A sower on his body
[2:14:07] and the doctor said have somebody to
[2:14:09] bring you up excuse me
[2:14:12] for if he would get just the saliva of
[2:14:15] that fox in that wound
[2:14:18] he could contact rabies
[2:14:20] that's how contagious sin is
[2:14:25] maybe some of them haven't been bit this
[2:14:27] hard
[2:14:28] but they've got an open wound and just a
[2:14:30] little bit of saliva of that mad devil
[2:14:33] Fox
[2:14:35] just for good measure we're going to
[2:14:38] bring them too
[2:14:40] all of us beginning with the preachers
[2:14:44] down to the deacons the trustees our
[2:14:47] elders here in the church all of us
[2:14:50] we just want to make a trip up to Papa's
[2:14:53] house
[2:14:55] and ask you to help us Lord
[2:15:00] that day Lord God later in the day the
[2:15:02] fox Hunters around that country about
[2:15:03] their dogs
[2:15:05] they started hunting that fox
[2:15:09] my uncle finally shot it
[2:15:11] my daddy's brother
[2:15:14] out of a tree does anybody here knows
[2:15:16] foxes don't even climb trees
[2:15:19] that fox was so out of its mind
[2:15:24] for years you remember Lord
[2:15:28] I was terrified of foxes
[2:15:32] scared to death even see one on the side
[2:15:34] of the road
[2:15:35] but now I've got 10 or 12 of them
[2:15:37] probably mounted taxidermies all
[2:15:40] different colors all different breeds
[2:15:43] wow
[2:15:44] my fear is gone
[2:15:47] my fear is gone
[2:15:50] we used to fear death
[2:15:53] we used to fear so much
[2:15:55] but the new birth
[2:15:57] is taking the fear of dying away from us
[2:16:01] now may you help us with the fear of our
[2:16:03] tomatoes
[2:16:05] the fear well this friend will do this
[2:16:07] and this ought to do that
[2:16:09] help us Jesus
[2:16:12] oh Lord God
[2:16:14] put your minister to us today Father
[2:16:18] it would go to our physician tomorrow
[2:16:20] and say dog I need a vaccine for my
[2:16:23] spirit

[2:16:27] think this person is mentally deranged
[2:16:31] but I wonder if they only knew a lot of
