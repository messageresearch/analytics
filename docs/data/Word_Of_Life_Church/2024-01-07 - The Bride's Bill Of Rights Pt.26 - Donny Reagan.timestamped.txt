[30:19] tears the
[30:21] long
[30:24] a the many ways
[30:29] a
[30:30] heart can
[30:34] break but you were at the center of it
[30:42] all to free from the prison of the
[30:50] Fall there was no
[30:53] heill to s for me to
[30:59] climb no roll too
[31:02] long or hard to make you
[31:09] mine I gave all I had to
[31:14] give it was worth the
[31:19] cost to say I love you from an Old
[31:25] Rugged Cross
[31:28] [Music]
[31:29] I took your
[31:32] guilt I
[31:34] bore your
[31:37] shame
[31:38] child I would
[31:41] do it
[31:43] all
[31:45] again my Open
[31:50] Arms reached out in
[31:54] grace to p P you
[31:58] in to loves and
[32:03] prce it's been spoken in a
[32:08] thousand different
[32:13] ways but the cross said more than words
[32:17] could ever
[32:20] say there was no
[32:24] heel to steep for me to
[32:29] climb no road too long or hard to make
[32:36] you
[32:39] mine I gave all I had to
[32:44] give it was worth the
[32:49] cost to say I love you from an Old
[32:54] Rugged
[32:56] Cross
[32:59] oh can you hear The Echoes from that
[33:06] [Music]
[33:07] here I Loved You Then and child I love
[33:12] you
[33:14] still there was no
[33:17] heal to Ste for me to
[33:23] climb no road too long long or hard to
[33:29] make you
[33:33] mine I gave all I had to
[33:38] give it was worth the
[33:42] cost it was worth it
[33:47] all to say I love
[33:55] you to tell you I love
[34:03] you from an Old Rugged
[34:22] Cross praise the
[34:25] Lord what
[34:29] of the law was given on the basis of the
[34:33] way
[34:34] that the measure of love that God would
[34:37] use to be able to judge the people that
[34:39] kept the law and they the way they would
[34:43] be able to express it to others it was
[34:45] built upon this principle love thy
[34:49] neighbor as
[34:51] thyself and actually their neighbor
[34:55] would have not been the Philistines the
[34:56] am amorites the Hittites the jebusites
[34:59] it would have been Jewish neighbors so
[35:02] they all kind of lived in a tribal order
[35:04] in a communal thing so that was the
[35:07] basis of the law this is where God
[35:10] founded it but in the New Testament
[35:13] Jesus says I write you or bring you a
[35:17] new
[35:19] commandment which is not based upon love
[35:21] your neighbor as you love
[35:24] yourself but love them more than
[35:26] yourself
[35:30] that's why this is totally
[35:33] unattainable completely
[35:36] unattainable by any
[35:38] person other than God
[35:41] himself human beings cannot love like
[35:44] that or people can be able to reach out
[35:46] and give a little something to somebody
[35:48] that they don't know you know is a
[35:49] Christmas time all the people stand
[35:51] around jingling their little bells and
[35:53] will you help the poort and will you do
[35:55] this that and the other I don't want to
[35:56] see see it a week before Christmas I
[35:58] want to see it 3 weeks
[36:02] after the Lord wants to see it every day
[36:05] of our life that we live like him in
[36:09] that awesome love God bless you hope
[36:12] youall are doing well
[36:13] today what a beautiful time it is for us
[36:17] to be together here in this January I
[36:20] say we take advantage of it every time
[36:22] that we have the opportunity don't
[36:24] you we know before long snow and I start
[36:26] moving through and it's going to cancel
[36:28] us and this that and other and I hate it
[36:29] so bad I can hardly stand it but we'll
[36:31] have church as much as we can and just
[36:34] be mindful of that 1 John 4 verse 16 I
[36:38] greet you today in the name of the Lord
[36:40] Jesus and trust the Lord will help us
[36:43] today as we Endeavor to look into his
[36:46] word and we have known and believed the
[36:50] love that God hath to us
[36:54] God is love and remember Satan
[36:59] cannot
[37:00] love people who serve him he doesn't
[37:03] love them he hates them it's the
[37:06] foundation of his kingdom can you
[37:08] imagine the turmoil in hell every day
[37:12] his kingdom is built upon Rebellion
[37:15] against God's word it must be awful in
[37:18] hell every day the prophet told us the
[37:20] reason that there's Wars against Nations
[37:22] all this going on between um Israel and
[37:25] you know Hamas and Hezbollah and all
[37:28] that sort of stuff you understand what
[37:30] does all that demons over these nations
[37:33] are fussing and arguing and fighting
[37:36] with one another and they take people as
[37:40] their instrumentality to raise up all
[37:42] this war it must be awful down in hell
[37:45] every
[37:46] day notice John says in the love that
[37:49] God ha to us God is love he that
[37:53] dwelleth in love if you notice John
[37:56] doesn't say he that's got a little bit
[37:57] of
[37:59] love dwelleth in God but he that
[38:02] dwelleth in love I love the meaning of
[38:06] this word
[38:07] abide remain continue to remain not to
[38:12] depart to continue to be present not to
[38:15] become another or different so actually
[38:19] love is where you
[38:21] live that's where you live at your
[38:24] residence he that dwelleth in love
[38:27] dwelleth in God and God in him so God is
[38:34] love and then to live in fellowship with
[38:37] him is to live in his love he or she who
[38:42] is
[38:43] full of God's love and their love toward
[38:46] God and their lord their love toward one
[38:48] another is
[38:50] full of
[38:54] God why would I want just a little bit
[38:56] of him if I could be totally full of him
[39:00] is that what you want with all your
[39:02] heart how many lets of be remember today
[39:04] as we pray God bless you each of you
[39:07] let's just bow our
[39:09] heads heavenly father as we've gathered
[39:11] here today Lord that we could worship
[39:14] and sing and how moving songs are Lord
[39:19] we thank you for the songs today in the
[39:21] worship Lord Jesus when you come to this
[39:24] earth there was no Hill that was too
[39:28] hard for you to
[39:29] climb there was no reproach so low that
[39:33] you wouldn't deal with it for us we
[39:36] thank you for that Lord God we desire to
[39:39] be the type of people you'd want us to
[39:42] be where we can love in that same depth
[39:45] and degree of love and as I said it's
[39:48] inhuman it is not human at all to love
[39:53] this way to love this deeply but we need
[39:57] your help Lord you saw the needs of your
[39:59] people that were signified but uplifting
[40:01] their hand I pray that you'd be mindful
[40:03] of us today help me to get out of the
[40:05] way father I need you so much Lord I
[40:08] pray father that you'd be mindful of
[40:11] those families who've lost loved ones in
[40:13] the last little bit Lord sister Sam's
[40:16] passing over I pray that you'd be
[40:18] mindful of her family and help them Lord
[40:20] and Lord Brother Calvin slipping out and
[40:24] also now father brother Jee Littleton we
[40:26] pray that you'd be mindful the Lord of
[40:28] their family that's left behind and we
[40:31] ask dear God that you would help each of
[40:33] us that we can make preparation to meet
[40:35] him we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:38] and the Saints said amen God bless you
[40:41] you may be
[40:43] seated let's read if you would there in
[40:46] verse
[40:48] 17 John goes on to say here in is our
[40:52] love made
[40:55] perfect so so actually what we received
[40:58] when we come to the process of the new
[41:00] birth and we were justified by faith
[41:03] Sanctified cleansed and then filled with
[41:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost what we
[41:09] received was not complete but it was a
[41:14] little button we know that the word here
[41:17] perfect does not mean sinless or without
[41:20] fault or flawed but it's growing to a
[41:25] state of maturity to reach its height of
[41:29] what God wants it to be John uses the
[41:33] word here in as our love made perfect so
[41:37] when you got it it wasn't in its perfect
[41:40] form I believe I got saved whenever I
[41:43] was a 12year old boy sometime later they
[41:46] begin to talk about the Holy Ghost so I
[41:49] went back to the altar they started
[41:51] praying for me again they was beating me
[41:54] on the back you know pray praying for me
[41:56] and praying for me one or two of them
[41:59] took their hands
[42:01] and you know sort of like that that's
[42:04] probably the way they thought this
[42:05] helping me get the Holy Ghost but all I
[42:07] done was bit my tongue several times as
[42:09] that was going on but I do believe I got
[42:13] something like some of you that that
[42:15] come out of Pentecost you believe you
[42:16] had something I believe that I got
[42:19] something but I don't believe I could
[42:22] have got the fullness of the token life
[42:25] under a Pentecostal message I don't
[42:28] believe you can get it there I don't
[42:29] believe you can get it in any other
[42:31] denominational system because it's
[42:32] controlled by man but it must come under
[42:36] an even in time message to will we
[42:38] receive that fullness now that fullness
[42:41] does not come in just an instant but it
[42:44] grows it matures even the character of
[42:47] our Lord Jesus had to be developed
[42:50] that's how far he condescended when he
[42:52] stepped down you imagine moving from
[42:55] that Realm of the logos moving from that
[42:58] realm Where Angels loved him praised him
[43:01] adored him nobody ever hated him or
[43:04] despised him to come from that to come
[43:06] down here to where people called him
[43:08] bbub laughed at him ridiculed him mocked
[43:11] at him why was he doing that in order to
[43:14] allow his human character God never had
[43:17] a human character until Christ come on
[43:20] the earth so God wanted a human
[43:23] character ain't that strange all of our
[43:25] life we want to become something other
[43:27] than human and for millions and maybe
[43:30] billions of years he wanted to become
[43:32] something other than God but it couldn't
[43:35] be nothing any greater so he wanted to
[43:37] become something less so he could take
[43:40] us in our fallen State and make us
[43:43] bigger than who we were that's real love
[43:45] brother sister now whenever we receive
[43:48] that is it is it that real genuine love
[43:51] it is but it's in seed form and it's so
[43:53] small and then John says herein is our
[43:56] our love made perfect so it grows and it
[43:59] matures that we may have boldness in the
[44:01] day of judgment because as he is so are
[44:05] we in this world so perfect then is
[44:09] complete and it's grown up so our love
[44:12] still today I don't know about yours I
[44:14] think if You' be honest you'd say with
[44:16] me that my love is still in development
[44:19] how many would say yours is still
[44:21] growing you're learning to love more
[44:23] you're learning how to forgive and
[44:25] learning how to put up with people my
[44:27] main problem in life is not with donkeys
[44:30] I've never had too many problems with
[44:31] donkeys had a few problems with dogs not
[44:34] many really U never have I had a run in
[44:36] with an elephant I got scared by one
[44:38] real one really bad one time in Africa U
[44:41] and whenever I was there and a big
[44:43] elephant big tusker as they call him got
[44:45] after us and and the guy that was there
[44:47] he had been there and done that before
[44:48] so all he' done was got his weapon up
[44:50] and went just like that soon as that
[44:53] elephant heard it it stopped turned and
[44:55] went the other way way I've never had
[44:56] too many problems with elephants zebras
[44:59] any of that sort of thing most of my
[45:00] problems in life is yeah you've guessed
[45:03] it been with human beings is that where
[45:05] most of yours have laid most of my
[45:07] problems has been with uh you know with
[45:09] people and and that's the way of course
[45:11] that it's going to be and i' I've found
[45:13] out a long time ago that my character is
[45:15] going to reach a greater height of where
[45:17] God wants it to be by dealing with
[45:20] people and some people probably say the
[45:22] same thing about me brother Donnie put
[45:25] me here in life life so I would be a
[45:27] better man well God bless you I'm glad
[45:29] I'm good for something so each of us no
[45:32] doubt have found people that just seem
[45:34] to push our buttons and it's just
[45:37] something about them that they don't you
[45:39] know they don't even really try maybe
[45:42] sometimes but there just something about
[45:44] them that just irritates us and just
[45:46] really bothers us and there's other
[45:48] people you just can never be around them
[45:51] enough you just so enjoy being around
[45:54] them and they put out this great
[45:55] atmosphere spere and you just think it's
[45:57] awesome but yet we know those type of
[46:00] people generally aren't the ones that
[46:02] allowed us to be Tried by and it was the
[46:05] same with the Lord Jesus had he been
[46:07] totally surrounded by everybody that
[46:09] loved him everybody that praised him
[46:11] then part of his human character would
[46:13] have never reached that state of
[46:15] development that it needed to be and you
[46:18] and I are going to be exactly the same
[46:20] way so our love then must reach a spot
[46:23] to where that it can be the same type of
[46:26] love that he had himself so where we at
[46:29] then we're in the stages of development
[46:32] because remember I keep saying it but
[46:34] love is like every other Grace that God
[46:37] gives us love must be developed unlike
[46:41] gifts now gifts come gifts can hit they
[46:44] can miss they can be right they can be
[46:46] wrong believe me I saw my share of them
[46:48] in Pentecost wherever You' see one and
[46:50] it would be right on I mean exactly and
[46:54] the very next person say that that
[46:56] they'd call out miss it a million miles
[46:59] and then you say how in the world can
[47:01] that be well that's the way gifts can
[47:03] operate but when it comes to love it's
[47:06] not that it hits and misses the thing
[47:08] that with love is it's the depth of the
[47:11] intensity that we have and if you're
[47:13] thinking today in your mind well I've
[47:16] got to love people more I've got to love
[47:17] people more it's not just loving people
[47:20] more it's loving him more you see the
[47:23] key is the more we fall in love with him
[47:26] the more we will find it's automatic the
[47:29] more we love people around us that's the
[47:33] way it was with him so John 3:16 of
[47:35] course we all know by heart for God so
[47:37] loved the world that he gave his only
[47:38] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[47:40] him should not perish but have
[47:42] everlasting life for God sent not his
[47:44] son into the world to condemn the world
[47:46] but that the world through him might be
[47:48] saved great love is that right
[47:50] phenomenal love and then 1 John 3:16
[47:54] turns right around to become the
[47:56] manifestation of that love in the human
[47:58] heart now Jesus says then in St John
[48:01] 13:34 read it with me a new commandment
[48:04] I give to you that you love one another
[48:08] now that's not new because the Old
[48:10] Testament the Torah told them that so
[48:13] they're supposed to love their neighbor
[48:16] as they love their themselves so this is
[48:18] the standard this is the foundation of
[48:21] the way the Torah is going to do now if
[48:22] you love your neighbor as yourself and
[48:24] you treat them right then all of the law
[48:26] is consummated in that because all the
[48:29] rest of them will fill for their place
[48:31] because they couldn't even do that
[48:33] without the right love for God you see
[48:35] we get it in in in its order but we get
[48:38] the order misarranged sometime we that
[48:40] well I've got to love everybody okay
[48:41] okay okay I've got all that what do I
[48:43] have to do to do it Fallen more in love
[48:45] with him you see if they loved him and
[48:48] they worshiped him and there was no
[48:49] other God before him and they loved him
[48:52] right then that would help them in turn
[48:54] love their neighbor nebor right and they
[48:56] would treat one another right so notice
[48:59] Jesus says a new commandment I given to
[49:01] you that you love one another that's not
[49:04] new here's the new part as I have loved
[49:09] you that ye also love one another now
[49:12] notice this so what makes his
[49:13] commandment different is it's based upon
[49:17] a new standard a new standard altogether
[49:21] so the new standard is that we don't
[49:23] love one another as we love ourself but
[49:27] we love one another as he loves
[49:31] us and how is that come on does Jesus
[49:35] love us when we're
[49:38] wrong does Jesus forgive us when we ask
[49:42] him
[49:43] to does Jesus care for those who hate
[49:47] him this is the standard so the standard
[49:51] then is not okay well I love those that
[49:53] love me and I'm good to those that are
[49:56] good to me and those that treat me nice
[49:59] I'll treat them nice bad you're no more
[50:01] than a sinner if that's all the love you
[50:03] have but the new standard is that we can
[50:06] love people on the basis of Jesus loving
[50:10] us so he said well no it's all based on
[50:13] Merit it's all based on what they do no
[50:15] it's not it's not based on any of that
[50:18] at all Brother Don you mean to tell me
[50:20] that you're telling us that we've got to
[50:22] love people that would absolutely hate
[50:24] us or kill us absolutely right you see
[50:27] that's the kind of love he had and
[50:29] that's the way he loved his own not only
[50:32] his own that he loved the world the
[50:35] cosmos so John 3:16 is not just
[50:38] primarily to the elect of God the bride
[50:40] seek God so Lov the world well that's
[50:42] Cosmos that's world order but he loved
[50:45] the elect before the foundation of the
[50:48] world so he didn't wasn't even
[50:49] necessarily referring to you as cosmos
[50:53] but you were part of him before there
[50:55] was ever a devil you were part of him
[50:57] before there's ever any sin on the earth
[50:59] is that right so now he says I want you
[51:02] all to love one another as I have loved
[51:08] you oh my goodness so should I stop now
[51:12] we have make an alter
[51:14] call as I have loved you so the context
[51:18] in points to the laying of the
[51:21] foundation of one another's lives for
[51:24] someone else
[51:26] so Jesus then became the ambassador of
[51:29] this new kind of love now he didn't just
[51:32] come with a book under his arm and said
[51:34] here I'm going to hand out this book and
[51:36] this is what y'all are supposed to do
[51:38] but he actually did it first himself if
[51:41] you can get in your mind he was the
[51:44] first human being that ever expressed
[51:47] this kind of love it had never been
[51:49] expressed before Adam had a no doubt a
[51:53] great great Fountain of of love I honest
[51:56] with you I don't know exactly what Adam
[51:58] did have in the Garden of Eden because
[52:00] whatever he had he could backslide from
[52:03] he could fall from people say well I I
[52:06] want to go back to Adam well I don't I
[52:08] want to go farther back to where Adam
[52:10] was because whatever Adam had he lost it
[52:13] but I want something that I'll never
[52:14] lose don't you so no doubt it was great
[52:17] it was Paramount whatever it was that he
[52:19] had but he was never able to experience
[52:22] any when that image of God left him than
[52:24] the very woman that he gave his kingdom
[52:26] for he turned right around and said God
[52:29] the woman you gave me she's the cause of
[52:31] all this anyway so whatever it was he
[52:34] lost it he left it so this is going to
[52:37] be the Paramount sign of every True
[52:41] Believer I find this to be absolutely
[52:43] astonishing because as Jesus was the
[52:46] embodiment of God's love then the elect
[52:50] of God are to be the embodiment of
[52:53] Christ's love now don't get in your mind
[52:54] I'm talk talking about this Le to seeing
[52:57] you know lovey doy ooey gooey type of
[53:01] stuff that everybody's going to heaven
[53:03] and we we love everybody and we accept
[53:05] them the way they are no God wants to
[53:07] change people but we love them while
[53:10] they're in the process of being changed
[53:13] is that right now the modern day they
[53:15] talk about love love of and it's easy to
[53:18] see they don't even know what kind of
[53:19] love they're talking about because they
[53:21] think that you can live any way you want
[53:22] to live and everybody's still wind up
[53:24] going to Heaven there's only one way to
[53:26] heaven and that person's name is Jesus
[53:29] Christ and if you love him then you will
[53:32] do what he says do it's just that simple
[53:34] so the Lord Jesus is showing them then
[53:38] this is going to be the sign wherein
[53:42] people will know that you are my
[53:45] disciples now self-love is the highest
[53:48] love that we are born with we can't help
[53:51] it it's just that that we inherited by
[53:54] the Fall so the new commandment then
[53:57] will go absolutely contrary to selflove
[54:00] because self- Lov if somebody does
[54:02] something to us it's just in our human
[54:04] nature we're going to get them back it
[54:06] may take us a month it may take us two
[54:08] it may take us five or six years but
[54:10] it's not we hold that inside of us and
[54:13] we'll get them back if it's the last
[54:16] thing we do that's why we got to be born
[54:18] again so then we learn to live and learn
[54:22] to love in a standard of love that as
[54:26] was our lord Jesus was himself which is
[54:29] self
[54:31] abandoning self denying love so Jesus
[54:34] says that you can't even be saved unless
[54:38] you deny yourself and take up your cross
[54:41] and follow me I've said it many times
[54:43] before I'll say it again that the Lord
[54:45] Jesus spoke more about your cross than
[54:48] he spoke about his so it must be pretty
[54:51] important is that right now notice with
[54:53] me in verse 35 now remember these are
[54:55] not the words of a theologian they're
[54:57] not the words of a Preacher they're the
[54:59] words of the Lord Jesus by
[55:02] this shall all men
[55:07] know that ye are my
[55:10] disciples I want you to notice he does
[55:12] not mention speaking in
[55:15] tongues he does not mention healing
[55:19] miracles
[55:22] signs Jesus don't speak contrary to his
[55:24] word word he could not say this here in
[55:27] St John 13 and then go to Matthew 24:24
[55:31] and said they be anointed ones in the
[55:32] last days and they'll have signs and
[55:34] wonders so if that is the sign of a True
[55:36] Believer there cannot be any false
[55:38] anointed ones isn't it amazing that
[55:41] Jesus does not say because you all shout
[55:45] this will be the one inevitable sign
[55:48] that people will know you are mine
[55:51] because you lay hands on the sick this
[55:53] is the one sign do you understand the
[55:56] sign he gave cannot be impersonated
[56:00] right miracles signs wonders can be
[56:04] impersonated as a matter of fact Harvest
[56:06] Time December 2764 the prophet tells us
[56:09] Satan can hand out them Supernatural
[56:12] gifts by the
[56:13] handfuls but he can't do
[56:16] this oh my so you mean there's one sign
[56:21] in all of Christianity that is a dead
[56:24] giveaway way that you had pass from
[56:27] deaths unto life well according to the
[56:29] Lord Jesus notice by this shall all men
[56:33] know now people want the evidence of the
[56:35] Holy Ghost and and people want to know
[56:37] how how can I know how can I be sure
[56:39] well here's the man who gave the Holy
[56:41] Ghost I reckon he would know so by this
[56:44] shall all men know that ye are my
[56:48] disciples if you have love one to
[56:52] another but yet it can't be the kind of
[56:55] love that Lea specializes in oh we love
[56:58] everybody we love everybody yeah they
[57:00] they say that until you give them a
[57:02] little bit about the word and you cross
[57:04] them a little bit let me tell you
[57:06] something friends as a pastor just take
[57:08] my word for this I will know folks in a
[57:11] way you don't even know them because
[57:13] when I cross them I see the real them oh
[57:17] my oh my yeah then you go to see all
[57:20] kinds of feathers getting ruffled and
[57:22] you're not sure if they're Buzzard
[57:24] feathers if scavenger feathers they're
[57:26] saying they're eagle feathers but the
[57:28] temper but sure don't match it now I
[57:30] want you to notice that in the first
[57:32] century on up to the second century that
[57:35] the historians of the day they noticed
[57:39] great things about the children of God
[57:42] now there was great signs and wonders of
[57:43] course that the early church did but it
[57:46] was not that that distinguish the
[57:49] Christians apart from other things now
[57:52] they did make note of course of the
[57:55] signs and the Wonders and the Miracles
[57:57] but down through the annals of History
[57:59] it was not just the the miraculous and
[58:02] the supernatural that they noted about
[58:05] these Christians that was so great this
[58:08] is one of the ones I'd like to read to
[58:09] you today that the Heathen would say it
[58:12] this way they love one another they are
[58:16] ready to lay down their lives for each
[58:20] other now this was a common saying among
[58:24] the he even then that they would say
[58:27] about Christians now it wasn't brother
[58:29] Joel that they said boy have you seen
[58:31] how when you go to their meetings how
[58:32] they shout boy have you noticed in
[58:34] women's hair how long it is have you
[58:36] noticed in men how they don't dress like
[58:38] women and all have you noticed all of
[58:40] that but what stood out to them the most
[58:44] the most outstanding thing was how they
[58:47] loved one another and they were willing
[58:50] to die for each other no wonder when the
[58:54] prophet went there on the curtain of
[58:55] time and he said lay aside everything
[58:59] until you get perfect
[59:02] love now how this has changed in
[59:06] Christianity down through the years so
[59:09] what are Christians known by
[59:14] now well for many of them well I go to
[59:16] this church I belong to this I belong to
[59:19] that that's not what I'm asking you how
[59:21] are you
[59:23] known well I brother Donnie I'm a woman
[59:25] I got long hair I've known many women
[59:27] with long hair got a big old long tongue
[59:29] about that long to match it too well
[59:32] praise the Lord I got to be honest with
[59:34] you some men's worse gossipers than
[59:35] women are well thank you
[59:38] Jesus you see it it was a rabinal way
[59:44] that rabbis
[59:46] rabbis they they chose their
[59:50] followers the people never chose to
[59:53] follow a rabbi
[59:55] but rabbis chose their followers and
[59:59] each Rabbi would have his own little
[1:00:02] special doctrinal view about this and
[1:00:05] that and the other most of the of the
[1:00:07] disciples were Pharisees so they were
[1:00:09] under a Pharisee teaching and the rabbis
[1:00:12] of the Pharisees but yet each Rabbi then
[1:00:15] would have his own little
[1:00:17] identification of the way his disciples
[1:00:21] would dress and do and behave so God had
[1:00:25] told them that they would take a a
[1:00:26] ribband r i BB A and D a rib band of
[1:00:29] blue and they would wear that on the
[1:00:31] bottom of their garments so when you saw
[1:00:34] a man or woman that had this little bit
[1:00:36] of blue on the bottom you knew
[1:00:38] immediately that they were a Jew but
[1:00:40] certain rabbis then would enlarge that
[1:00:43] border and say some of them would make
[1:00:45] it the hand breaths and then others
[1:00:47] would make it a cubid which would be
[1:00:48] around 18 in so you knew when you saw
[1:00:52] that individual that they belong belong
[1:00:54] to this Rabbi now those of you that have
[1:00:57] ever seen Jews if you've been to New
[1:00:59] York City or you've been to Israel or
[1:01:01] any place where you got a conglomeration
[1:01:03] of a bunch of Jews gathered together and
[1:01:05] you'll see some men that wear a big hat
[1:01:09] about this big and it's made out of long
[1:01:11] wool it'll be about this tall something
[1:01:13] like that and it sits down on top of
[1:01:16] their head real shimmery and shiny and
[1:01:18] it looks sort of like a bear's coat is
[1:01:20] sort of what it looks like and then you
[1:01:23] know when you see that they belong to a
[1:01:26] certain uh teaching from Europe most of
[1:01:29] them come from the Ukraine but they come
[1:01:32] from under the teaching of a certain
[1:01:34] Rabbi then you will see others they will
[1:01:37] have a total different hat and then
[1:01:40] others will have the little curly cues
[1:01:42] that come down on the side of their face
[1:01:44] now that is an identification that when
[1:01:47] you look at them you know oh they belong
[1:01:49] to Rabbi so and so and they belong to
[1:01:52] Rabbi so and so so they follow his
[1:01:54] teaching
[1:01:55] well here the Lord Jesus and they did
[1:01:57] call him Rabbi the Lord Jesus said you
[1:02:00] have not chosen me but I have chosen you
[1:02:03] now that was the way rabbis did but he
[1:02:05] said I'm going to give you all an
[1:02:09] identification that is different than
[1:02:11] Pharisee sadducee seen uh zeelot I'm
[1:02:15] going to give you one that's going to be
[1:02:17] so different that you were going to
[1:02:19] stick out so much now having been there
[1:02:21] in Israel a few years ago and you would
[1:02:23] see the Orthodox and you would see the
[1:02:26] ultra Orthodox and you we was able to go
[1:02:29] in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem near
[1:02:31] where they were so you see all these
[1:02:33] Jews coming and going and many of the
[1:02:35] women you see them with long dresses
[1:02:37] just like our sisters wear but one thing
[1:02:39] that you'll notice about some of them
[1:02:41] according to the rabbi they come from
[1:02:42] under is that the women will shave their
[1:02:45] hair and they wear wigs now that's under
[1:02:47] the teaching of a particular Rabbi or a
[1:02:50] particular teaching so they are known by
[1:02:53] what they put on on the outside so the
[1:02:56] men will dress in black and they will go
[1:02:58] to the when they go to the Wailing Wall
[1:03:00] which we were there the men on the left
[1:03:02] hand side the women on the right hand
[1:03:04] side and I was able to go back into the
[1:03:07] ancient part of it still sitting there
[1:03:09] and there was those Jews there was the
[1:03:11] young and old and the Herod and the
[1:03:13] different ones and they're sitting there
[1:03:15] and as they're reading the Psalms
[1:03:17] they're sitting there like this because
[1:03:19] they think you cannot read the word
[1:03:21] without being
[1:03:23] stimulated well if an Old Testament does
[1:03:26] that what off the New Testament do to us
[1:03:29] so and it's amazing because me being a
[1:03:31] gentile they would not let me and the
[1:03:33] other brothers that I were with they
[1:03:35] would not let us walk down to the
[1:03:37] Wailing Wall unless we put a little cap
[1:03:39] over the top of our head now we're on
[1:03:41] their Turf so if we're going to come in
[1:03:43] to their place then we've got to put
[1:03:45] that on our head now for others that
[1:03:47] would not be enough they would rather I
[1:03:50] would have one of them woolly hairs on
[1:03:51] I've got enough wool on the top of my
[1:03:53] head anyway I don't need another one but
[1:03:55] each one of them so you look and there
[1:03:57] was a little group over here and they
[1:03:59] had one hat on here's another little
[1:04:01] group and they'd never have another hat
[1:04:03] but they knew each other by the way they
[1:04:05] look now Jesus said this is what I'm
[1:04:07] going to do to you all I as your Rabbi I
[1:04:11] am going to give you an identification
[1:04:14] which has never been given to any other
[1:04:17] disciples since the fall of Man it won't
[1:04:20] just be the length of your dress it
[1:04:22] won't just be the church that you go to
[1:04:25] but it will be a mannerism and a way
[1:04:28] about you which is So Divine that even
[1:04:32] Sinners will be able to know there's
[1:04:34] something different about you they may
[1:04:37] not agree with you and they may not
[1:04:39] understand you but by this Jesus said
[1:04:42] all men will know so they're not
[1:04:44] guessing so it makes me wonder friends
[1:04:47] how far we've missed the real sign of
[1:04:50] what God wants us to be amen I want you
[1:04:53] to notice says then that the followers
[1:04:55] of the great teachers would have this
[1:04:58] distinctive Mark notice what Jerome the
[1:05:02] historian said Jerome refers to the
[1:05:04] well-known saying of St John at Ephesus
[1:05:09] now this was John say this is the Lord's
[1:05:13] commandment if you love one another it
[1:05:17] is
[1:05:19] enough wow boy that sure wouldn't be
[1:05:22] enough for us would it I mean we got so
[1:05:25] many doctrines and we split hairs and
[1:05:27] divide the hairs and then we split the
[1:05:29] splits off the splits of the hairs and
[1:05:31] we divide the splits off the splits off
[1:05:33] the divides man alive you know we get
[1:05:35] down there but so it makes me wonder how
[1:05:38] much of our hearts has been turned back
[1:05:40] to the teaching of our Apostolic
[1:05:44] fathers well praise the Lord so it was
[1:05:47] such an outstanding love and here's
[1:05:50] Jerome quoting John that John said at
[1:05:54] Eis remember that's where he was from
[1:05:55] there this is the Lord's commandment if
[1:05:58] you love one another it is enough you
[1:06:00] said that sounds so simple but it's much
[1:06:03] harder to do than it
[1:06:04] sounds so you see following in divine
[1:06:07] order you cannot love one another the
[1:06:09] way you're supposed to until you love
[1:06:12] God the way you're supposed to love him
[1:06:14] and if you love him the way you're
[1:06:16] supposed to love him then all the dos
[1:06:18] and the don'ts and thou shalt and thou
[1:06:20] shalt not that comes right with it too
[1:06:24] but a lot of people try to keep the Thou
[1:06:26] shalt and thou shalt not and thou shalt
[1:06:28] and thou shalt not and dos and the
[1:06:30] don'ts and they try to keep all of that
[1:06:32] without loving him right and then after
[1:06:35] a while they just get wor out with all
[1:06:37] the dos and the don'ts well I don't want
[1:06:39] to do it no more I don't blame you I
[1:06:41] wouldn't want to do it without him
[1:06:42] either but if you love him right then
[1:06:45] the dos and the don'ts it ain't a burden
[1:06:48] it ain't torment my goodness I'm glad I
[1:06:51] live the way that I live I'm glad what
[1:06:54] about you I'm glad that I live a
[1:06:56] separated life from the world it's not
[1:06:59] this burden oh my brother Donnie can
[1:07:01] only have one wife well was the one I've
[1:07:04] got why would I want another one why in
[1:07:07] the world would I want to have three or
[1:07:08] four wives or or a wife and a girlfriend
[1:07:11] I want to stand here today and tell you
[1:07:14] my wife is my girlfriend and has been
[1:07:17] for 50 years and I love her now more
[1:07:19] than i' I've ever loved her why because
[1:07:22] of law because I'm afraid go to hell no
[1:07:25] because she's such a great woman she's a
[1:07:27] Godly woman and our love is getting
[1:07:30] stronger and stronger that's the way I
[1:07:32] feel about the Lord Jesus well I I'd
[1:07:35] love to live for him but it's just so
[1:07:37] hard I got to quit this and I got to
[1:07:39] give up that you're looking at it in the
[1:07:41] wrong way if you fall in love with him
[1:07:44] you realize the devil ain't got nothing
[1:07:47] out here that is greater than the love
[1:07:50] Jesus can give you and what Jesus can
[1:07:54] and wants to do for
[1:07:59] you notice this historian called tholu t
[1:08:03] h o l l u c
[1:08:06] k refers to
[1:08:09] tertian declaration now this was an
[1:08:12] early century
[1:08:14] preacher they
[1:08:17] love before they know each
[1:08:22] other but human love is we have to know
[1:08:26] each other and then the more we know
[1:08:29] about each other the less we do
[1:08:33] love because said boy I didn't know she
[1:08:35] was that way I didn't know he was that
[1:08:37] way i' never got involved with him you
[1:08:39] know how human relationships are
[1:08:42] right but yet this was what stuck out to
[1:08:46] the historians in so much that this
[1:08:48] historian would write this of tertian
[1:08:50] and say they love before they know know
[1:08:54] each
[1:08:56] other
[1:08:57] Lucian tell by the name he was a Roman
[1:09:00] historian and Lucien this notice what
[1:09:03] Lucien said about our brothers and
[1:09:06] sisters our founding
[1:09:08] Church their
[1:09:11] Master makes them
[1:09:14] believe they are
[1:09:19] brothers I believe we still got the same
[1:09:22] master notice how the outsider now would
[1:09:26] would look at it and and they they
[1:09:29] couldn't understand this up cuz remember
[1:09:31] in the first second third fourth Century
[1:09:32] we're talking about under the Roman
[1:09:34] Empire it was an age of so so much
[1:09:38] self-indulgence whatever felt good
[1:09:40] whatever thought you wanted to do do it
[1:09:42] well just do it oh they were so liberal
[1:09:44] because it was emerging together of
[1:09:46] course of the Greek Empire before that
[1:09:48] wind up in the Roman Empire every Empire
[1:09:50] has totally annihilated itself from
[1:09:52] within which is why our nation's where
[1:09:54] she's at now that's why there's no hope
[1:09:57] for our nation as a whole because it is
[1:09:59] rotten from the very core we don't have
[1:10:02] to worry about the Japanese we don't
[1:10:04] have to worry about Hamas coming over
[1:10:05] here and taking us over we have been
[1:10:07] annihilated from within our own
[1:10:10] ranks may God help us it don't happen to
[1:10:13] us in the
[1:10:14] message notice in so Luci and looking at
[1:10:17] it as an outsider you can tell this guy
[1:10:20] did not understand the Holy Ghost he did
[1:10:22] not understand now he's looking at it
[1:10:25] from just a mind perspective and what he
[1:10:27] had heard no doubt the man had heard him
[1:10:29] talk about love and and heard him talk
[1:10:31] about loving one another and the way he
[1:10:33] looked at it it was so strange and he
[1:10:35] identified the Lord Jesus as their
[1:10:38] Master their Master makes them believe
[1:10:41] they are brothers so as long as this
[1:10:45] type of love was prevalent in the first
[1:10:47] church age they were totally Unstoppable
[1:10:51] there was not enough lines that could
[1:10:53] kill kill it there wasn't enough fire
[1:10:55] that could stop it there was not enough
[1:10:57] Nero there was not enough hadrians there
[1:11:00] was not enough Emperors on the earth to
[1:11:03] stop
[1:11:04] it so Satan knew he had to attack
[1:11:09] something it was their
[1:11:17] love Revelation
[1:11:19] 2:4 nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:11:22] thee the complaint of God of God against
[1:11:25] the Ephesian Church age because thou
[1:11:31] Hast now many many people quote this
[1:11:34] wrong they say
[1:11:36] lost that's not what the Bible
[1:11:39] says the Bible says
[1:11:42] left if you lose something you may or
[1:11:45] may not find it and you may or may not
[1:11:47] know where it
[1:11:48] is but if you left something
[1:11:52] intentionally and you left left it on
[1:11:54] your table or you left it in your
[1:11:56] bedroom then you know how you're going
[1:11:58] to get it back you're going to have to
[1:12:00] go back to your bedroom back to your
[1:12:02] table back to the
[1:12:04] altar to be able to find where you left
[1:12:08] it now this age had run oh my so
[1:12:12] beautifully for so many years for about
[1:12:14] 20 years or so they were the alpha bride
[1:12:18] the type of the seed which was going to
[1:12:20] be sewn in the beginning in the alpha
[1:12:22] stage and would be harvested in the
[1:12:24] Omega stage in the end time for 20 years
[1:12:28] they had a world shaking Revival is it
[1:12:32] were the very deity of God was among
[1:12:35] them they healed the sick like Jesus
[1:12:38] they raised the Dead Like Jesus they
[1:12:40] cast out devils like
[1:12:42] Jesus but yet they done
[1:12:45] greater they love the way he
[1:12:48] loved so from within their human Temple
[1:12:53] proce ceeded Divine love which was God's
[1:12:57] Own love
[1:12:59] himself and Satan must have hated them
[1:13:03] how they got along and they would settle
[1:13:05] their differences and they loved one
[1:13:07] another and they would forgive one
[1:13:09] another they would reach out to the lost
[1:13:11] and they would do everything that they
[1:13:13] did was on the basis not of Personality
[1:13:17] it was not based on well this man or
[1:13:19] that man it was one basis of their
[1:13:21] foundation and that was Divine love and
[1:13:24] Satan said I hate this stuff I hate
[1:13:31] it so his goal was if I can get them
[1:13:35] away from loving God
[1:13:40] right the church will lose its
[1:13:43] power they won't have as many miracles
[1:13:46] and signs you said what he wants us to
[1:13:48] do he wants us to focus on getting the
[1:13:50] signs back first we got the cart before
[1:13:54] the
[1:13:55] horse Let's Fall In Love with him first
[1:13:59] and then true gifts will manifest
[1:14:01] theirself and it won't be based upon
[1:14:03] selfishness or this great man and that
[1:14:05] great man and this great church there
[1:14:07] ain't no great ones Among Us only one
[1:14:10] and that's the Lord
[1:14:12] Jesus
[1:14:15] Hallelujah nevertheless I have somewhat
[1:14:17] against thee because thou H has left thy
[1:14:21] First Love Now please keep this in mind
[1:14:24] such love is not
[1:14:28] human you cannot do this I cannot do it
[1:14:31] it's totally
[1:14:35] impossible my mother and father could
[1:14:37] not hand this down to
[1:14:39] me it's impossible for a human to love
[1:14:43] with Divine love unless Divine love from
[1:14:46] God comes within their
[1:14:49] soul so as we love God who we don't see
[1:14:54] that unseen power develops in us a
[1:14:58] perfect love to help those that we do
[1:15:03] see how many of y'all's ever seen
[1:15:06] God have you ever seen his
[1:15:09] face his hand his
[1:15:13] foot none of you and yet you love a
[1:15:16] being that you've never even
[1:15:19] seen right how many wants to love him
[1:15:22] more
[1:15:23] well why you going to love his
[1:15:25] eyes is it his feet you're going to love
[1:15:28] more what do we want to love more about
[1:15:31] him his nature his character what he is
[1:15:36] what he does what he says that's who he
[1:15:39] is so we don't love him then and we
[1:15:42] don't judge him and we don't base our
[1:15:44] love upon what we see but
[1:15:47] yet that's the way we love
[1:15:51] others come on well did you see her the
[1:15:54] way she done me did you see him the way
[1:15:55] he done me did you see so and so they
[1:15:58] never even spoke to me so you love God
[1:16:00] in the realm of the
[1:16:02] Unseen but we base our love for one
[1:16:04] another totally on the realm of the seen
[1:16:08] the felt the touched
[1:16:12] sir whether or not you like it everybody
[1:16:15] you go to church with is
[1:16:17] flawed and that's why you're so welcome
[1:16:19] here cuz you're just like all the rest
[1:16:21] of
[1:16:22] us now I also have said last Sunday if
[1:16:24] you do find a perfect Church please
[1:16:25] don't go there because you'll mess it up
[1:16:28] and they won't want me as a pastor cuz
[1:16:30] I'm not perfect and I sure mess it up
[1:16:33] but isn't it amazing how that we give
[1:16:35] everything we give absolutely everything
[1:16:38] to an unseen
[1:16:42] being now would have bothered some of
[1:16:44] you if Jesus would have been
[1:16:47] black on would it bothered some of Y all
[1:16:50] Jesus would have been a Chinese come on
[1:16:52] now
[1:16:54] what if you're a racist it would yes sir
[1:16:56] oh Lord I oh dear God I could have never
[1:16:58] search Jesus if he been black I wouldn't
[1:17:01] care if it's pink or purple I'm not
[1:17:04] going by what I seen I love him because
[1:17:06] of who he is and what he done and what
[1:17:10] he done for me and you get the Holy
[1:17:12] Ghost all this race stuff will fly out
[1:17:15] the window oh my come on somebody then
[1:17:18] if you're a white man you can grab a
[1:17:20] hold of a black man or a black brother
[1:17:23] and you can hug his neck because you got
[1:17:25] the spirit of God inside of you come on
[1:17:28] somebody it don't make no difference if
[1:17:31] you're an Asian a Chinese a Japanese or
[1:17:34] whatever more you are we have the same
[1:17:36] love of God in our hearts for one
[1:17:45] another you see this kind of love can
[1:17:47] only be depart given to us imparted by
[1:17:50] the Holy Ghost therefore where love
[1:17:53] rules it looses us from under the law of
[1:17:57] condemnation and this is why the the
[1:18:00] word inside of us becomes the very law
[1:18:03] or nature that we're Guided by then we
[1:18:06] are become partakers According to second
[1:18:08] Peter chapter 1 ver4 we are become
[1:18:10] partakers of the divine
[1:18:13] nature so we can love as he loves we can
[1:18:16] forgive as he forgives oh praise the
[1:18:19] Lord now notice as as an app tree will
[1:18:24] bring forth
[1:18:29] oranges and a preach tree will bring
[1:18:32] forth
[1:18:35] pumpkins oh you made a mistake brother
[1:18:37] Donnie no I said that
[1:18:39] intentionally but that's the way some
[1:18:41] Christians
[1:18:43] are they're a peach tree they say and
[1:18:46] yet they bring forth pumpkin
[1:18:50] attitudes they come to church and they
[1:18:52] act like a big old fat pumpkin sitting
[1:18:53] on the chair they don't ever clap their
[1:18:55] hands they don't ever praise the Lord
[1:18:57] they don't ever worship god well it was
[1:19:00] too hot in there I understand I'm about
[1:19:02] to burn up right now myself but you
[1:19:03] think I'm going to stop preaching
[1:19:05] because it's hot you think I'm going to
[1:19:06] stop preaching because it ain't going
[1:19:08] good this might be my last opportunity
[1:19:11] to come to the house of God I'm going to
[1:19:13] give it everything I got oh praise the
[1:19:16] Lord I I don't know when it'll be my
[1:19:18] last time to come to the house of God
[1:19:20] brother Joel I'm going to worship I'm
[1:19:22] I'm going to sing I'm going to pray oh
[1:19:25] Hallelujah you feel the same way why
[1:19:28] because I want an attitude that matches
[1:19:31] my god I've not come to worship the
[1:19:34] thermostat I've not come looking for a
[1:19:36] perfect temperature I've come to be
[1:19:39] encouraged I've come to be healed I've
[1:19:42] come to be uplifted by the power of God
[1:19:45] so I refuse I refuse to let time and
[1:19:50] people control me
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:59] praise the
[1:20:01] Lord
[1:20:02] amen watch this you know as I go on in
[1:20:05] time I'm beginning to realize why a lot
[1:20:06] of
[1:20:07] folks have turned away from this message
[1:20:10] that we so love and why they just don't
[1:20:13] want
[1:20:14] it the bottom line is they can't live
[1:20:17] it this message brings the simple truths
[1:20:21] of the Bible in such an everyday way and
[1:20:25] scope of life that if you're not even a
[1:20:29] theologian you'd be able to understand
[1:20:31] it that is if you want to notice this
[1:20:35] let me tell you today my dear friends
[1:20:36] the greatest thing there is this side of
[1:20:41] heaven and he spells it l o v e Divine
[1:20:47] love the greatest thing this side of
[1:20:51] Heaven Again the Lamb's Book of life now
[1:20:53] the fruit of the holy spirit is love joy
[1:20:55] peace longsuffering goodness gentleness
[1:20:58] patience meekness that's the fruit of
[1:21:00] the spirit and that fruit that's the
[1:21:02] mark of the Holy Spirit showing that
[1:21:04] Divine love has anchored in the heart
[1:21:08] and the things of the world is dead so
[1:21:10] you see the thought of the more love you
[1:21:12] get the more you can do in the world is
[1:21:15] totally opposite of the truth fall in
[1:21:18] love with him and the things of the
[1:21:20] world will just fall off automatically
[1:21:22] why because your priorities change and
[1:21:25] you realize what what I Oh I thought I
[1:21:27] could never give this up I could never
[1:21:28] give that up but he gives you something
[1:21:31] so much greater than what Satan give you
[1:21:33] say my goodness this is absolutely
[1:21:35] nothing his word is so wonderful his
[1:21:38] presence is so awesome why in the world
[1:21:40] would I've always wanted to serve him
[1:21:43] notice again he said if you've still got
[1:21:45] malice and envy and strife you might run
[1:21:48] dance spoke in tongue shouted preach the
[1:21:51] gospel or anything
[1:21:53] but you're
[1:21:55] lost Lord have mercy until that blood
[1:21:58] has cleansed you and set in a Divine
[1:22:01] love of the Lord Jesus not
[1:22:05] for but of the Lord Jesus Christ in your
[1:22:09] heart in your life it speaks of Christ
[1:22:13] behind
[1:22:15] you well brother D I've got to pray more
[1:22:18] I've got to read more I've got to go to
[1:22:19] church more got to read my Bible so I I
[1:22:21] I'll be able to get this kind of love no
[1:22:24] he gives it to us then he molds us and
[1:22:28] he shapes us and he lets that love in it
[1:22:30] start growing and you love beyond your
[1:22:33] boundary you you actually start loving
[1:22:35] beyond your expectation you start loving
[1:22:39] beyond your comprehension of what love
[1:22:42] even is and then you start living in
[1:22:44] this land of love and dwelling in that
[1:22:46] and you saying I would have never
[1:22:48] thought I could have forgive that
[1:22:50] brother I would have never thought I
[1:22:53] could have forgiv that sister will you
[1:22:54] find what it is you're growing in the
[1:22:58] image of
[1:22:59] god notice oh my where there's trums
[1:23:04] they shall cease where there's prophecy
[1:23:05] it shall fail where there's knowledge it
[1:23:07] shall be vanished and when that which is
[1:23:09] perfect has come that which is part has
[1:23:12] done away you Christians always be
[1:23:15] willing to land a hand to do something
[1:23:17] to help somebody to make it more
[1:23:20] pleasant for them you said well I don't
[1:23:22] have any gift of healing you don't have
[1:23:24] to have at least offer something yeah
[1:23:28] offer a prayer do something make them
[1:23:32] feel do the best you can never turn a
[1:23:35] brother from India sent me this quote
[1:23:37] yesterday and I just shared it all over
[1:23:39] the world I thought it was so wonderful
[1:23:42] never turn a shoulder a
[1:23:46] cold shoulder
[1:23:49] right now maybe I need to walk off the
[1:23:51] platform and finish this
[1:23:53] this never turn a cold shoulder to
[1:23:57] anyone no matter what it is even if
[1:24:00] they've mistreated
[1:24:02] you do it
[1:24:05] anyhow now don't raise your hands but I
[1:24:07] wonder how many of us are pretty good at
[1:24:10] that cold shoulder
[1:24:15] thing but you know that's really
[1:24:18] sad because that's not a
[1:24:21] disciple
[1:24:24] sign so if Jesus would have said now I'm
[1:24:26] I'm your Rabbi now this is what I want
[1:24:28] you to do whenever people don't treat
[1:24:30] you good I want you
[1:24:34] to now that's the way people will know
[1:24:37] that you're following me see just get
[1:24:39] really good
[1:24:49] at to me it's so sad that we're really
[1:24:52] good at something that's so
[1:25:00] bad anybody besides me in here ever give
[1:25:03] anybody a cold shoulder yes sir 1 2 3 4
[1:25:06] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
[1:25:09] 13 well you sisters that didn't raise
[1:25:11] your hand and your brothers y'all come
[1:25:12] up here and take my notes and go and
[1:25:13] finish this sermon then I'm not worthy
[1:25:16] to said among
[1:25:20] you wow but why would we give anyone a
[1:25:23] coold shoulder cuz it's in our
[1:25:28] nature I listen he said even if they
[1:25:31] mistreated you do it anyhow if you can't
[1:25:34] do it from your
[1:25:37] heart and you ought to come to the Altar
[1:25:41] and stay till that Spirit comes in you
[1:25:44] that from your heart you can love
[1:25:49] those who doesn't love you
[1:25:53] amen and everybody said Lord help
[1:26:00] me listen friend that's when
[1:26:06] God will answer your
[1:26:11] prayer for as long as there's anything
[1:26:13] in your heart if I conceive iniquity in
[1:26:16] my heart then God will not hear me
[1:26:17] that's what David
[1:26:19] said and that's true
[1:26:22] he won't hear
[1:26:27] you
[1:26:29] wow some brother dnie will I get it by
[1:26:31] fasting will I get it by reading my
[1:26:34] Bible Well will I get it by praying more
[1:26:37] it may be a combination of all those
[1:26:39] things if that's what God deals with you
[1:26:40] about but what you want to focus on is
[1:26:42] not getting more gifts and more emotion
[1:26:47] that comes with it but you want to focus
[1:26:50] on getting more of The Giver
[1:26:56] himself and the more of The Giver that
[1:26:58] we get inside of our Lives it's like he
[1:27:03] pushes his virtue and nature out of
[1:27:06] us and goes to touching
[1:27:10] people that you meet every
[1:27:13] day this is your
[1:27:15] badge of a true
[1:27:19] disciple someone told me the other day
[1:27:21] of
[1:27:23] someone that embraced the message and
[1:27:25] come to the message and they left a
[1:27:26] denomination and they been around for a
[1:27:29] bit and they started getting on social
[1:27:31] media and what they started finding was
[1:27:34] people of the message that was fussing
[1:27:36] and arguing and fighting and debating
[1:27:38] and just back and forth and back and
[1:27:41] forth and these people come to the
[1:27:43] pastor of the church or they'd went to
[1:27:45] and said we don't
[1:27:48] understand that's exactly the way they'
[1:27:50] done in the church we come out of
[1:27:54] we thought you all had
[1:27:57] love testing 1 two 3 testing one
[1:28:02] to oh
[1:28:06] my notice I probably goes on to say now
[1:28:09] what is the church is liking is divine
[1:28:11] love I don't mean affectionate
[1:28:15] love this is what the lean preachers
[1:28:18] specialize in when they're preaching
[1:28:19] love they're not preaching Divine love
[1:28:21] at all
[1:28:22] they're preaching affectionate love so
[1:28:26] just touching everybody and rubbing
[1:28:28] everybody oh God bless you God bless
[1:28:31] you and they think that's
[1:28:34] love so they welcome everybody to their
[1:28:36] church that they do anything and
[1:28:38] everything and they don't preach the
[1:28:39] truths how can you love anybody and you
[1:28:41] see them going down a river and the boat
[1:28:43] they're in is going over the falls and
[1:28:45] you say you love them and you stand
[1:28:47] there and wave at them as they go down
[1:28:49] that ain't love Real Love Is is
[1:28:52] corrective but affectionate love will
[1:28:55] hold back truths Divine love will always
[1:28:59] put truth first with wisdom
[1:29:02] yes so you see we don't want to just
[1:29:04] love with human affection people don't
[1:29:08] understand
[1:29:09] compassion they think compassion is
[1:29:12] human
[1:29:14] sympathy the Lord Jesus you believe he
[1:29:17] had compassion yet he walked among a
[1:29:20] crowd of people one day and the Bible
[1:29:22] says there was many laying there halted
[1:29:24] blind and the Lord Jesus walks
[1:29:28] to a man that is called
[1:29:31] impotent which had an Affliction for 38
[1:29:34] years it wasn't going to kill him it had
[1:29:36] it all this time it wasn't near as major
[1:29:39] as many other people that were there but
[1:29:42] he walks straight to that man and brings
[1:29:44] healing to that man and walks straight
[1:29:46] out of that crowd of people and doesn't
[1:29:48] heal another
[1:29:50] individual
[1:29:52] our modern day theologians to look at
[1:29:54] that and saywell that ain't love that
[1:29:55] ain't love you know why they say that
[1:29:57] because they don't understand love love
[1:29:59] with compassion Godly compassion is
[1:30:02] doing the will of God
[1:30:06] yeah notice this he said I don't mean
[1:30:09] affectional love I mean agapo love The
[1:30:11] Godly love and have it so richly in your
[1:30:14] heart so you just love the Lord and
[1:30:16] everything you just take his word for it
[1:30:20] and you don't miss M trust
[1:30:25] him again he says we love thee with
[1:30:28] unchangeable love 25 years ago you
[1:30:31] placed that Divine Love in My Heart Lord
[1:30:33] Jesus notice now it grows sweeter praise
[1:30:38] the Lord it grows sweeter every day I'm
[1:30:41] so happy that we grow in the
[1:30:45] Lord amen till we become in the full
[1:30:49] statue the measure the statue of Christ
[1:30:54] you say I love the Lord but can you
[1:30:56] trust him with a doctor shakes his head
[1:30:59] can you trust him when everything else
[1:31:02] is gone you need an overflowing baptism
[1:31:07] of
[1:31:08] love and going be honest and raise your
[1:31:10] hand before God and say God I already
[1:31:12] believe that's what I need I need a
[1:31:15] baptism of Love isn't it amazing though
[1:31:18] Mo most why is it that so many would
[1:31:20] want a baptism of power a baptism of the
[1:31:23] anointing to lay hands on the sick I
[1:31:24] believe in that too children we've got
[1:31:26] so many sick among us I believe in that
[1:31:29] but if we can get our divine love right
[1:31:31] I'll guarantee you you mark it down if
[1:31:34] we get our love right in this church we
[1:31:37] will see more healings more miracles
[1:31:39] than we've ever seen in our life but it
[1:31:42] will not be on the basis of us seeking
[1:31:45] gifts first but it will be on the basis
[1:31:48] of us seeking the giver and being able
[1:31:50] to be a true disciple and people can say
[1:31:53] I don't understand what they believe I
[1:31:55] don't understand the way they dress but
[1:31:57] I'll tell you one thing I ain't never
[1:31:58] seen a people but such Godly love in my
[1:32:00] life let that be my badge as a disciple
[1:32:04] Let It Be My identification that when I
[1:32:07] get around people they can feel the love
[1:32:09] of God oozing out of me may they be able
[1:32:13] to censor something different I what you
[1:32:15] want as a Believer every child of God
[1:32:18] here today that ought to be the very
[1:32:20] thing we want more than than anything
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:26] else oh my let me quose of this and
[1:32:30] handwriting on the
[1:32:31] wall if I had every gift in the
[1:32:35] Bible and could exchange it for
[1:32:40] love I'd never wink an
[1:32:44] eye I'd take it right
[1:32:48] now let me feel the blessings of the
[1:32:50] Lord Jesus his Divine love in my heart
[1:32:53] that's shed abroad by the Holy Ghost
[1:32:55] I'll exchange any gift in the
[1:32:59] Bible for
[1:33:04] that and the church said
[1:33:07] amen or you say I've spoken tongues that
[1:33:10] don't have nothing to do with that I've
[1:33:11] shouted that's still don't have nothing
[1:33:13] to do with it Paul said I could speak in
[1:33:15] tongues like men and angels and still be
[1:33:19] lost do we believe that friends am still
[1:33:23] be lost I could have faith to move
[1:33:26] mountains and still be
[1:33:29] lost and in it if the Divine love of God
[1:33:32] isn't in your heart to take everything
[1:33:34] of the world out notice the Divine love
[1:33:38] of God will take everything of the world
[1:33:41] out it don't allow you to keep
[1:33:44] everything the Divine love of God itself
[1:33:48] will drive it
[1:33:50] out
[1:33:53] Hallelujah that's
[1:33:55] right listen this if the Divine love of
[1:33:59] God isn't in your heart to take
[1:34:01] everything of the world out you're
[1:34:04] lost the devil's only deceiving
[1:34:07] you Paul said whether there's tongues
[1:34:09] they'll cease whether there's prophecies
[1:34:11] it'll fail whether there's all these
[1:34:13] signs the
[1:34:15] Antichrist can produce any
[1:34:20] sign that's it in the
[1:34:23] Bible but listen what you can do that
[1:34:27] the Antichrist
[1:34:28] can't but he
[1:34:32] cannot
[1:34:37] love so you say I lay hands on the sick
[1:34:39] and they recover the Antichrist can do
[1:34:41] the same
[1:34:42] thing I have Miracles the Antichrist can
[1:34:45] do the same
[1:34:48] thing but he can't
[1:34:50] love
[1:34:52] let's stand
[1:34:55] together he cannot love there's nothing
[1:34:58] about him to love agapo love is divine
[1:35:01] love and when the Divine love is in your
[1:35:03] heart there is a difference in your life
[1:35:07] and
[1:35:08] everybody knows it that's right you live
[1:35:12] like a Christian act like a Christian
[1:35:14] walk like a Christian and your whole
[1:35:17] system is
[1:35:20] timed to
[1:35:22] God's
[1:35:25] Bible oh hallelujah how many loves him
[1:35:28] with all your heart that what you want I
[1:35:31] quote this to you Wednesday night but
[1:35:33] let me read it to you this morning after
[1:35:35] this morning the holy spirit so
[1:35:36] beautifully coming down and bathing us
[1:35:39] listen to these terms bathing Us in his
[1:35:44] great
[1:35:45] Beauty bathing Us in his great Beauty oh
[1:35:51] oh my I was just inspired to speak them
[1:35:55] words and say that some glorious day all
[1:35:57] the gifts that's in the church will be
[1:36:00] set aside on the mantle as it was and
[1:36:02] the Holy Spirit
[1:36:05] himself will just take the church and
[1:36:08] such a
[1:36:10] control of divine
[1:36:13] love until the sick will be
[1:36:17] healed the blind will see the lame will
[1:36:22] walk now what I find amazing is there's
[1:36:24] an element of Brothers in the message
[1:36:26] that will try to take some of these
[1:36:28] quotes and say Well when Divine love
[1:36:30] comes in We Ain't Got No more healing
[1:36:32] you need to read this one along with
[1:36:33] that one you're
[1:36:34] reading he don't do away with
[1:36:37] healing come on Divine Healing is a down
[1:36:40] payment of the
[1:36:43] Resurrection oh my the Holy Spirit
[1:36:47] himself don't you understand the
[1:36:49] difference a gift is him taking that
[1:36:52] gift and using it but what he wants is
[1:36:56] this that he
[1:36:58] himself does
[1:37:01] it cuz you know how we are if this
[1:37:04] certain preacher prays for us it's
[1:37:07] nearly impossible for us to keep from
[1:37:10] thinking very highly of that man right
[1:37:13] and then if we're not careful the next
[1:37:14] time we get sick we'll want that same
[1:37:16] man to pray for us again and again and
[1:37:18] again and
[1:37:20] again
[1:37:21] that's just the way we are as
[1:37:23] humans but can you imagine if the Holy
[1:37:26] Ghost can so get inside of our church
[1:37:29] not just
[1:37:30] ours but everyone that wants
[1:37:33] this will take such control of divine
[1:37:36] love until the sick will be healed the
[1:37:39] blind will
[1:37:40] see the lame will
[1:37:44] walk without being
[1:37:46] hands laid on
[1:37:49] them it'll just be be one
[1:37:52] great
[1:37:55] Unity praise
[1:37:57] God wouldn't that be something wouldn't
[1:38:01] that be
[1:38:02] awesome sort of reminds me of that 20
[1:38:05] year or so Span in the early church when
[1:38:09] the Holy Ghost was so moving among them
[1:38:12] it was not no big great preachers and
[1:38:13] this great person and that great person
[1:38:16] it was the anointing of the lion himself
[1:38:19] the person of Jesus anointing and they
[1:38:22] were the extension of his body so what's
[1:38:25] this message come to do anyway just
[1:38:27] bring us a bunch of doctrines make us
[1:38:29] dress
[1:38:31] different just make us act a little
[1:38:33] different have strange ideas of what the
[1:38:34] people say is that all it's for it's to
[1:38:38] replicate that original
[1:38:42] church amen I've got one more can I have
[1:38:45] your permission to read
[1:38:47] it I was going to do it without it
[1:38:49] anyway but it's just nice when y'all
[1:38:50] smile and say I
[1:38:52] can oh if the Pentecostal Church would
[1:38:56] only satisfy thirsting God instead of
[1:38:58] trying to follow some
[1:39:00] evangelist or some emotion or some
[1:39:03] little ISM a little
[1:39:05] sensation how much better off that'd be
[1:39:08] you'd follow the holy spirit in Divine
[1:39:11] love instead of Sensations and little
[1:39:14] gifts and things like that how much
[1:39:16] better off you'd be God don't want you
[1:39:19] to run after gift
[1:39:24] he wants you
[1:39:26] thirst after
[1:39:32] him praise the
[1:39:34] Lord praise the Lord you see if you get
[1:39:39] him you get all the
[1:39:41] gifts your sisters meet a fine young man
[1:39:45] you go to datton him and he buys you
[1:39:46] chocolates and roses and carnations and
[1:39:50] daff deals and all kind they said oh
[1:39:52] don't never stop that please bring on
[1:39:55] the flowers sis get him and you'll keep
[1:39:58] getting flowers oh no brother Donna they
[1:40:01] stopped doing that I still open the car
[1:40:03] door for my wife after 50 years if you
[1:40:06] Brothers don't do it you need to fall in
[1:40:08] love with her again same with the Lord
[1:40:11] Jesus if we get him and he says Lord you
[1:40:14] going to stop the chocolate he said
[1:40:16] goodness no I've got more now that I
[1:40:17] want to give you you're going to stop
[1:40:19] the supernatural Lord You're going to
[1:40:21] stop the blessing we've been taught Lord
[1:40:22] if we get Divine love you're going to
[1:40:24] stop gifts he said whoever told you that
[1:40:25] lied to you I'm want to do more than
[1:40:27] I've ever done I want healing to be so
[1:40:30] great it'll be so phenomenal and so
[1:40:33] great the very next step will be you
[1:40:35] simply stepping into a new
[1:40:38] body hallelujah hallelujah you simply
[1:40:41] stepping into a new body not stop Divine
[1:40:44] Healing not stop the supernatural not
[1:40:47] stop
[1:40:48] Miracles amen amen it's bar
[1:40:55] it
[1:40:59] Hallelujah Lord Jesus I pray you'd
[1:41:01] forgive us
[1:41:04] preachers if we focus more on the gifts
[1:41:07] and we have the
[1:41:09] giver if we focus more on emotion and
[1:41:12] stirring the people
[1:41:16] somehow Lord I believe with many many
[1:41:19] men they want Revival so bad among their
[1:41:23] people and among the message
[1:41:26] folks we don't want to see them dead and
[1:41:29] dry spirit of God not moving Among
[1:41:33] Us help us to keep the balance Lord to
[1:41:36] realize if if it's not based upon your
[1:41:39] word and real Divine love it won't
[1:41:46] last someone asked Moody one
[1:41:49] time how long revivals last and do they
[1:41:52] last he said yes they do last the
[1:41:57] individual said well how come you have
[1:41:58] to keep on habit them he said did you
[1:42:01] take a bath before you come to church
[1:42:03] the man said yes he said well you have
[1:42:04] to take another one he said yes he said
[1:42:07] question
[1:42:08] answered so Lord revivals come and then
[1:42:11] they'll tend to wne a little bit and
[1:42:13] then they'll die and what for so we can
[1:42:16] have another one and another one and
[1:42:18] another one but if we can get Divine
[1:42:22] love and keep falling in love with you
[1:42:24] more every day of our life and falling
[1:42:27] in love with one another and even if the
[1:42:29] church is going through a little bit of
[1:42:31] a
[1:42:32] lull we're not ready to quit and walk
[1:42:34] away and backside and go back to the
[1:42:36] world because our love for you is just
[1:42:39] as great as it was when everybody was
[1:42:40] hanging from the chandeliers as we'
[1:42:43] say because our walk with you isn't just
[1:42:46] based upon a Revival coming and going
[1:42:49] it's based upon our love for you you
[1:42:51] your love for us and our love for one
[1:42:55] another I pray for this church today
[1:42:58] father I pray You' help me as the
[1:43:01] pastor help me that I can
[1:43:04] display Divine love help me that I can
[1:43:08] be the kind of preacher Lord God that no
[1:43:11] matter where I'm at that people can
[1:43:13] sense something
[1:43:17] different I don't care whether they
[1:43:18] think I'm a great preacher or not
[1:43:20] whether I'm a Theologian or not I ain't
[1:43:22] whether they think I'm this or that or
[1:43:24] the other if they can just sense you my
[1:43:28] life will not have been lived in
[1:43:31] vain but that don't just apply to the
[1:43:33] preacher it applies to each of us every
[1:43:37] man every woman every boy every
[1:43:41] girl would you pass by this way today
[1:43:44] Lord and give us a great
[1:43:47] baptism of Love Yes Lord
[1:43:51] to where we'll just fall in love with
[1:43:53] you more than ever
[1:43:56] before praise
[1:43:59] God I'm wondering how many here today
[1:44:02] would just raise your hand and just say
[1:44:05] it to him Lord that's what I
[1:44:08] want would you that's what you want in
[1:44:10] your heart today Lord that's what I want
[1:44:13] more love more

[1:44:39] just a few minutes in his
[1:44:41] presence let his holy presence just move
[1:44:46] Among Us
[1:44:48] Now Hallelujah
[1:44:51] father in the name of
[1:44:54] Jesus Lord some of the Saints I look at
[1:44:56] them they've been serving you for
[1:44:59] decades but I'd say if they'd be
[1:45:02] honest that she'll like to have more and
[1:45:06] more
[1:45:08] Hallelujah Lord God we want to live in
[1:45:11] such a
[1:45:12] way that if death goes to moving in our

[1:45:21] brother Darren telling me how that he
[1:45:22] left his family there with him most of
[1:45:25] them went home and brother Darren there
[1:45:26] and but they all spent time with him
[1:45:29] crying around him telling him how much
[1:45:30] they loved him brother Darren laid down
[1:45:33] to rest a little bit brother Jean just
[1:45:36] slipped
[1:45:38] away facing man's greatest
[1:45:42] fear and he faced it with
[1:45:46] peace that's what we want Lord
[1:45:49] God
[1:45:51] but Lord God I don't want to just have
[1:45:52] peace when I'm dying I want it now Lord

[1:46:27] say a little something to try to lift
