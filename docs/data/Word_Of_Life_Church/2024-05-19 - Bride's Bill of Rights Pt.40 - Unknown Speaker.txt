thank God for the privilege where we can be together today I want to speak to you on the right to be married to God Amen the right to be married to God Romans chapter 7 remember Lord will in June the 1st be having um Saturday night service communion service be starting about 6 o' brother darl be speaking for us of course everyone is welcome and looking forward to a great time in the Lord June the 1st Saturday night 6: p.m. Romans chapter 7 verse one know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth I watch you changes from verse one to verse Two for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband now we're not talking about the Mosaic law but the law of her husband the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are be come dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead so by the body of Christ we are married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God how many you'd like to be we remember today as we as we pray got some prayer claws here today and also a tie that a brother wants me to pray over and um if you have a need you just hold it there in your heart as we approach the lord lord Jesus our beloved husband how we love you today we are so thankful that you took drunks Liars whoremongers some were religious some were filled with all kinds of unbelief and sin and because of what you did for us we were loosed from the law of our first husband and because of you we have been remarried we are grateful today Lord Jesus we're asking you that you'd be mindful of us as we look into your word help me today father that I can get out of the way take my human instrumentality father and move it aside and use that portion of yourself which is a gift in a man's life anoint that Lord you saw the needs of the people signified by the uplifting of a hand these prayer re calls Lord Jesus that I have here these requests pray that you'd be mindful of them Lord help me father that I I can be able to submit myself to you shut my mouth to anything that would be displeasing to you may we hear from heaven today as we've gathered together here in the house of God in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated truly what a wonderful thing that Mary is if it's carried out according to God's provision and his word the oldest institution in the world God himself was the first one to perform it of course in the Garden of Eden a me for it to be sacred and to Believers it still is Satan has certainly made a sham out of a lot of it and all that people are doing with marriage today but it doesn't take away the sacredness from us as children of God whenever brother brandham was here and he was supposed to been on a hunting trip in 1965 November brother Jack Moore called him and wanted him to come and hold some series of meetings for him in spport Louisiana so when brother brandham preaches is the first night of that service he that series of services he preaches this sermon called The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ and he reads the scripture that we just read here in Romans 7 verse 1 now he says that this scripture is very seldom preached on he said because it uh pertained to marriage and divorce and that a lot of people basically just stayed away from it because marriage and divorce is such a controversial subject but unlike myself and unlike other ministers in the five-fold ministry a prophet has an Insight that someone like me just does not have I'm not called to have it nor is any other aspect of the ministry because a prophet is a sear so when he reads this and he made this statement in paragraph 35 Paul here is giving an illustration in our scripture about the law and Grace an illustrating it like marriage and divorce this passage is very seldom preached on because it's more or less pertains to like marriage and divorce but this is what stuck out to me whenever I heard this but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce so it doesn't just pertain then to a man and a woman but it also pertains to a greater portion of marriage and divorce how that he's trying to set in order that we as a church now I believe also it's to my belief that it unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy so there's a greater portion of marriage and divorce in Romans 7 and then also in Romans 7 there is a great mystery of Prophecy again a prophet having the ability to look into the word u unlike myself and other ministers that love God with all of our hearts but we're just not given that ability to do it so Prophet would be able to look at it and see things in there and rightly divide that word and to be able to place it in such a way that be more enlightening for us to see so he saw in this now I find this amazing because as many times as brother brandham dealt with marriage and divorce down through the years this sermon right here things that he says inside of this sermon was never said before or after this sermon and yet he was supposed to have been on a hunting trip boy am I so glad he didn't go now it shows you how God orchestrates things now he said he was standing with a pair of white trousers on in Indian moccasins whenever brother Jack Moore calls him and he schedules this meeting and it must have been so profound in Heaven's Divine orchestration that these things be said because if you haven't listened to it in a while do you good to listen to it but there's so many things that are made clear that the message thus far up to this time now remember this is 11 2565 and he's going to be gone a little over a month from that time so it would have never been said but God divinely orchestrated this because it had to be uttered as a prophetic utterance so what I want to do by the help of the Lord today let us start out by looking at our first Union so if it pertains seem to a greater portion of marriage and divorce now I'm not here today to preach about your marriages and you you should have done this and shouldn't have done that but what I am here today to preach about is the marriage that each one of us had which was wrong that is the marriage to our natural nature and your first husband that had the rule over you was your nature amen so you were were joined into that nature by an act between a man and a woman your mother and father and that set you in line then for this shotgun wedding if you wish to call it that so then we were forced into this Union which was a perverted union now watch he said our natural life here that we have is just a perversion it really should have been the right life to begin with but it's per converted how by the natural birth the first life or your first Union you were joined at Birth by Nature a natural act you were joined to it by Nature at your birth by a natural act a natural human being associated man and woman together Associated together in sexual Affair which brought your first life here that's associated with sin and death how can you miss seeing the serpent see now watch it goes on to say in paragraph 212 now it was nature associated with death your first husband that had the rule over you was your Nature by natural birth so then when we were born we did not express it probably most of us what was going to be there for maybe many years some of you might have start expressing a little bit of it when you were smaller if you had a strong dominating nature about you but maybe for a lot of us it might have been several years before we started displaying that deceitful conniving type of nature or lying or temper or whatever it was but it began to come out the older that we got and our mother and father might watch us and look at us and think where did they get that at they didn't get that from me they didn't get that from you where did they get that at now they're trying to understand it and you yourself of course didn't know because it was natural for you to act that way so if you were shy timid and quiet you don't have to put that on that's your natural nature so if you were buoyant you were loud you were the life of the party so to speak that was natural to you as well so if you was high-tempered high strung whatever it was and that was the husband that you were actually married to so your husband was your first nature and it ruled you as the man is the head of the home as Christ is the head of the body right that's the way God has the order of protocol and headship so then the natural nature that every one of us were born with that was our first husband which had the rule over us so it wasn't that he sat down and talked with us and said now look I'm stubborn I'm hard-headed I'm dominating I'm this this and this and I want your hands I want your eyes I want your nose I want your mouth I want your temperament so that I can be able to display myself and then you said no no no I don't like that I don't want to be that way no you did actually because that was your husband so you were married to that Husband by conception of your mother conceiving from your father then you receive this natural makeup now can't you see why the new births must replace that it must change it this is why it's not enough to just become a church member now that's sad to say but that's where much of Christianity is left today that they actually do get saved but they never go any farther now you can be saved and your first husband still dominating your life let me say it again you can be saved and your first husband dominating your life because you're saved individual but you're not remarried yet now what you said your Nature by natural birth natural you love the world because you are the world and you're part of the world that's right and he said your desires was by nature to love the world which you're a part of you're a part of nature so that's not odd that's not unusual for the people that are without the Holy Ghost to love the world it's not it's not you know something really strange and odd because that was the nature we all receive we were born of that is it unusual for a bear to act like a bear wouldn't it be really odd if you pull up in the parking lot today and and sitting over beside you in a car was sitting a black bear sitting behind the steering wheel and that black bear drove the car to church and the black bear gets out and it's got on a three-piece suit like mine and got on black shoes like mine with a tie on and you're saying my lord I can't believe this that that bear drove that car to church that bear is dressed up my that that bear surely that bears not going to church wouldn't that really be odd wouldn't that really be strange why it's against its nature but what would it be you saw that bear killing you know a baby calf eating on that calf that's not really odd that's what they do so that bear would smell you and be gone and you you'd see by Nature it's only acting out what it is so when we see Sinners really we should not in that sense really condemn them for what they are doing like nature they're Hogs they live like Hogs they wallow in the marrow like Hogs is that right because it's their nature but what we ought to be ashamed of is people who claim to be Christians and claim to be born again and they're wallowing out there like a pig and acting like a pig and eating what pigs eat and then they claim to have the Holy Ghost no there's something wrong somewhere it's like a bear sitting and driving a car and putting a suit on that's not the way that it works so whenever we're born into this and then we are married to that it's not that God actually condemns The Sinner because the sinner smokes and The Sinner drinks and The Sinner lies and The Sinner cheats God don't condemn the Sinners because they do that he does he condemns them because they refuse to be changed and make them where they don't have to do that anymore right so it's not even the sinner that sins now listen Sinners don't sin Christians do right Sinners are Sinners by Nature so when God looks at them it's not like oh I condemn you because you smoke I condemn you because you drink I condemn you because you look at pornography no no God condemns them because they're a sinner but if Christians socalled do those very things same things then God condemns us and that's why he has Ministry that will come and preach the gospel and say it's wrong for you to do that it's wrong for you to do that and you see with Sinners they're condemned because categorically they're place in that state of being a sinner but God will have men of God to preach individually to Christians and name their individual sins you understand now once you by desire was by nature to love the world with you're a part of you are a part of nature you believe that the people say amen there and that's your natural thing that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate now notice what has to happen to you you have to die to that first husband now remember that first husband is not the devil per se it's not Satan or demons per se it is the act between a that took place in the beginning before Adam ever got to his wife in between Satan and Eve and then this has every human being with this type of Fallen nature now remember Satan don't have to do it again and again and again and again all he had to do was do it one time then when the seed Li Minds become mixed in Genesis chapter 6 then every person born is going to have this type of nature now watch he says then we're married to this first nature you have to die to that first husband you can't live with it you can't say well I'll divorce him you can't divorce the first nature I'll divorce him and hang him up till the occasion no sir no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every Speck of him has to die and you have to be reunited again with another nature now notice then so your first husband was your first nature so in order to truly be born again your first nature SL husband has to die but you can't remain without a nature natur so you've got to have a new nature and that new nature will actually be your new husband so that new nature is not what I quit drinking and I quit smoking and I quit no no no no you're do you're doing wrong you're looking at it wrong you're looking well i' done this and I'd done that your new nature is not what you do it's him it's him then he comes in you with his own life he is actually reborn in you every time a person gets the Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus is born in another life praise God every spec of him has to die and you have to be reunited again now remember you are a trinity a tri you being in that you have a soul you have a spirit and you have a body so God cannot kill this sinful nature and leave you without a husband it's mandatory you've got to be married again because without a husband slash nature you would not be the full manifestation of a human being but he will not divorce that one and say well I'll tell you what we'll give him a writing of divorcement and we'll just move him out of the house and then the Lord Jesus say I I I'll move in I'll just move in the house and and mean you have a a wedding ceremony and and this old nature he'll be he'll be down the street you know he'll be down the street you you'll pass by and see him every now and then and he'll pass by and see you every now and then well we know how through social media that many people have met Old Flames and old boyfriends and old girlfriends and they connect on Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok and flipflop a lot of other stuff like that well come on don't sit there and look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about and they go to getting reunited with that old flame they call it God don't want you and I reunited with that old flame so God's going to take care of that God said that old boy has got to be dead and there's only one way he can die you have to submit your nature and say God kill him kill him every Speck of him I don't want moving down the street and I'll pass by and going to work I'll pass by and going to church I'll pass by and going to Walmart and no the first thing you know it be S out there waving at you go as you go by and then you'll get your email address as we say then he'll get your text and then he'll get this and that and the other and that old nature would go to contacting you and then before you know it all the churches backslid again because their Old Flame has finally got their attention one more time but God says I am going to make this so secure that once they come into my way of a new birst they will never again Fall Away now listen to me you can be saved and later lose your salvation the disciples were saved before Pentecost and every one of them denied the Lord Jesus Judas was saved but went to hell so you can lose salvation but you can't lose the Holy Ghost praise be to God now what you had to be reunited again with another nature which is the husband your name of your first nature was born now listen what the name of your husband was your name of your first nature was born and put in a Book of Life all your Deeds were wrote in it too everything you done under that nature so whenever you were born then Mom and Daddy gave that nature a name so in my case July the 9th 1956 8 or 9:00 something like that in the morning whenever I was born my nature was given the name Donald Lee Reagan Jr that was my nature's name then God recorded that name in a book called The Book of Life then when I got old enough and I started doing wrong it started being recorded under what that name now I was joined to that I wasn't too awful Wicked but I was lost I've done a few mean things in my life but that nature dominated me and even some of the things I do I would think how come me to do that I don't understand why I did and y'all ever do that you ever wonder why in the world did I do that I mean you know some things that people do even their conscience if they have one would tell them that it's not right for them to do but why do we do it it's our husband he rules over us with such a domain that we just submit to him praise be to God now notice and so your name of your first nature was born and put in the book of life and all your Deeds was wrote in that too everything you done under that nature was put in a book called The Book of Life now but when you were separated from that Union notice how he's typing it now with marriage with your husband and your nature when you were separated from that Union by spiritual deaths your natural desire to cut your hair your natural desire to wear shorts paint your face your natural desire to be intellectual smart men to know something better than the other that's what Eve wanted that's the very thing she wanted so it was it was natural for us to do whatever our husband said I want to drink and that's what some of you all did because your natural nature thirsted for alcohol a stimulus of something that would help you maybe you've got a a nature that kind of leans toward depression and you don't have a lot of interior happiness or exterior happiness and you find a stimulant maybe when you're young and you begin to become addicted to that and it releases of course the endorphins in your brain and gives you that Feelgood feeling and once you ever do then it's so much easier to go back to a needle or a pill or a bottle to be able to help you feel good again so what was that that was that husband that you were married to and even though you might hear teaching now don't do that that's wrong that's wrong yes yes I know that's wrong I've got to quit doing this and you want to with all of your heart and you make up your mind you might even go to church and you might get saved but you can be saved sitting in a church Pew you could be baptized in water and start doing all types of good religious deeds and that old husband of yours still alive and well inside of your soul and he'll leave you alone for a while but it's only for a while because he's got to be in control he's got to be in charge now God's way then is to bring us if it was the natural birth that married us to the Natural Union and there was a name a book a nature a name a book a nature and that name and that book and that nature was our former identification then God also must give a new name a new book and a new nature now notice so there has to be a new name and there has to be a new book now this is where your name once you're truly born again there is a transfer a transfer now it's not actually that your name is you know literally written over here and then God blots it out and he transfers it over here but it's in a symbolism of you to be able to see but the prophet says you say my old name is actually my name has been transferred what he said it's no longer identified in the old book but you're identified living under a new nature in the new book which what is this book called the Lamb's Book of Life and then he goes on to call this Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate now I perform many weddings as you folks know and once I do that then the license given to me in two types of papers they are given to me and it is my responsibility to take them to the courthouse I performed a wedding last night and Lord willing tomorrow I will will take that marriage certificate to the courthouse I had to fill it out I had to date it I had to verify was it religious or civil what the time was so on and so on brother JD was a witness of it and then it is my responsibility within three days to return this to the courthouse whenever I go to the courthouse I will go in and I will hand it to them did you perform this yes I did your name Donnie Reagan yes okay do you want to take their copy yes I do sometimes I'll take their copy and give it to them it cannot be carried in by the witness it cannot be carried in by some of you that were there it is my responsibility I'm actually hell liable if I do not return it you see there's something about the man performing the ceremony that has a responsibility well the Lord God was not going to give give this up to anybody else he's going to have to have men that are responsible that will be able to stand on the earth and join him and his bride together so it ain't everybody that goes to Seminary and ain't ever preacher that goes to Bible school it's God called God ordained Holy Ghost filled men that God will use to bring him and his bride together under the administration of the son of man now listen to this so your name then is in under that category when you're first born notice the prophet goes on to saying now when you were separated from that Union by spiritual debt your natural desire will die so what happens to that look with me if you would in 1 Peter chap 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who according to His abundant Mercy has begot gotten us again now remember the Lord Jesus was the first one in John 3:16 that begin to say these words you know that God so Lov the world that he gave his only begotten son now at the time that the Lord Jesus says this he is the only begotten Son of God but he's not today because there's other Sons and Daughters of God that are begotten by the Holy Ghost amen well that's what your Bible ible says to the Abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead now watch how Peter takes what what Paul said in Romans 7 so we then have begotten and given a lively hope how by joining the church shaking the preacher's hand though but by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus in verse four to an inheritance Incorruptible and unde defiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you now Peter goes a little bit further in verse 23 being born again notice born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever now notice what God does by truth God communicates a living principle to the soul that receives his seed word which is the Sperma that's the Greek word he Sperma now I'm not talking about now people getting just saved here's the issue friends a lot of folks get saved and they think they're born again they think they got everything they need when they got saved but remember as I told you before the disciples were saved but they were not converted read with me in Matthew 18:2 Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them and said verily I say unto you except ye be converted so the Lord Jesus is talking to the 12 preachers now they were arguing about who's going to be the greatest and the kingdom and that's what a lot of the preacher problem is around the message a lot of the preachers ain't got the Holy Ghost yet they ever get it ain't no time what in the world they'll do but and oh my we're waiting on them to get it because they're still arguing who's got the biggest Ministry and who's got the biggest church and who's got more Revelation about this so Jesus Took a child and he said look boys unless you guys become converted it what an embarrassing thing to say to your 12 men that you personally called yourself and you wind up telling them 12 men that you have called you boys ain't converted yet now they had accepted Jesus as their savior they had been baptized in Water by Jesus himself amen but they had not been baptized in the spirit by Jesus himself now watch what he goes on to tell him in verse three and he said surely I say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children so they were disciples but they were not converted they were disciples and preachers casting out Devils Healing The Sick raising the Dead doing the same signs the Lord Jesus did but they had not yet been quickened to a new husband to have this humble nature that children have so they were doing signs wers Miracles and it made them proud and arrogant why first husman was alive and well notice whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven so his disciples had not yet entered into the kingdom of heaven but they were saved working signs wonders Miracles when they returned back after Jesus sent them out 2 by two in Matthew 10 Jesus said I saw Satan as Lightning cast down out of Heaven they were rejoicing God we saw the lame W walk we saw this we saw that he said don't Rejoice because that happens to you but but rather Rejoice that your names are written now watch the Lord Jesus Luke 22:32 speaks person now to Peter I have prayed for thee that thy face fail not when thou art read ited so you mean Peter is not yet converted either yet he had the keys to the kingdom Healing The Sick casting out Devils so on and so on and Peter turned out to be a cussing preacher well praise the Lord but Peter was saved but he didn't have the Holy Ghost so Peter was still married to his first husband which had the rule over him well y'all are Qui today notice in Mark 16:16 he that belith and is baptized shall be saved but notice Jesus does not say now that when you're saved saved and getting the Holy Ghost is the same thing that's the church that read that into the Bible not the original Apostles it is not Apostolic doctrine that when you get saved you get the Holy Ghost at the same time well come on somebody say Amen if you can't say Amen say ouch or ow me or something so I know you're here with me now remember these are the words of the Lord Jesus not me not some other preacher he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved look at what the word saved means Soo the Greek word Soo so it's the exact same word that is whenever Jesus would tell many of them that uh you are healed by your faith so it means Soo means that you are saved spiritually or saved physically from your sickness so people can be saved from cancer and come back again and die with it later people people could be saved look at what the word saved means to rescue from danger or destruction to save or rescue and this is where friends many people think because they get saved they have eternal life don't you see what preachers have done they have taken scriptures which apply only to those who are truly born again and they apply them straight across the board to anybody then that is saved has eternal life and eternal security that is damnable Doctrine praise the lord it's warm in here this morning it is just me watch Acts chapter 2 verse 21 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be rescued from danger but just because you're rescued does not mean you're rescued to a place of Eternity as a matter of fact you can turn right back around and go to the very same spot that you were in and lose your rescue or your salvation acts 16:30 and brought them out and said sir now remember this is the Philippian Jailer so whenever Paul and Silas are beaten of course and then taken to Jail the Lord shook the jail house down then the Jailer comes and asks them what must I do to be saved and they said Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be filled with the Holy Ghost read your Bible the way it says it Thou shalt be saved and thy house not filled with the Holy Ghost now remember Judas es scariot was saved he was a preacher had great anointing is that right lived a Godly life Judas was the treasure of Jesus ministry so anybody that give tithes and offerings to the Lord Jesus Judas packed it around in his pocket so he must have been a trustworthy sort of a character so he was saved but later lost his salvation second Peter 2 ver 20 for if after they have escaped or been saved the pollut s of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ they are again in Tangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning so people then can be delivered from sin and delivered from so many things and turn right back around and go right back into it is that what the Bible says and the latter end of those people was actually worse than what it was before how was that even possible that a person could be delivered and turn and go back and become worse their husband never died you see if that nature ever dies once there is no Resurrection for that nature this is why God so designed the new birth it is absolute eternal security there's nothing else for you to go back to there is no old husband you did not divorce him but if people come out of darkness and out of sin and whatever more and then they turn and go right back to you know as well as I do we've seen many of them and they become worse than they were before they ever even come to the Lord is that right why because that husband of theirs he comes out with a rage you will not do me that way again don't you ever think about doing me that way oh my here he come I'm telling you what woman you're going to do what I tell you to do I am your rid do you understand you drunk beer before next time you're drinking vodka you you smoke marijuana the next time you're smok and cry and they get worse and worse and how many have we seen because that husband raises with such a Vengeance amen notice Peter in verse 21 says I want you to listen friends what this man is saying it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness then after they have known it to turn turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them I don't mind telling you this morning some of the folks that's been around our ranks that' been better off to stay in their denominational chicken house then to have come under the truth and set under the ministry of the word of this hour and then turn and go back to that listen what the Bible says about it it has happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog the dog not a sheep but the dog has turned to his own vomit again so you mean they were saved they were delivered they were helped they were ministered to and the whole time they were still a dog oh Lord God help us and the style that was washed to her wallowing in the m so when she was sitting in the Pew she was still a s when she got saved brother John she was still how brother Donnie how is that possible that old husband was still alive Jew says it this way in verse 5 I will therefore put you in remembrance though you once knew this how the Lord Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not so you mean God saved them and give them a Salvation in the Old Testament and later destroyed some of the same ones he he sa because they refused to go on a so-called message preacher made this statement sometime back there are going to be people inside the Catholic Church who've given their heart to God who love the Lord who read the scripture who follow Jesus Christ who will be saved who will be in the bride who will go in the Rapture how is that possible when you're praying to Joseph and praying to Mary and praying to St Cecilia if that is true why do we even need the Holy Ghost why do we even need a message come on don't get quiet on me now his statement goes on to say because they may be in the Catholic church but the Catholic Church isn't in them who ever heard of such nonsense now does that line up with the scripture and the message you ought to have enough sense to know this is what the spirit of God said in the Book of Revelation 18:4 I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues come out of her my [Applause] people and this same message invisible union now he said so do every one of us know the whole rank of denomination Pentecostal and all are dead that is to the born again Christian of the message you see many people even around our ranks do not even understand the terminology of a word Birth by Malachi 4 turn with me to Acts chapter 19 verse1 let's look at some real Christians real disciples and it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul having passed to the upper Coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples now notice what Luke calls these group of people disciples and he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed oh my goodness you mean the Holy Ghost is different from believing now I want you to notice here have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I want you to look at this word believed you're talking about powerful it's from a Greek root word which is used in many different forms in the New Testament of pistus p i s t i s this is pisu pistu and it means to commit one's trust to to think to be true so notice what Paul's asking them have you all received the Holy Ghost since you committed your trust to Jesus Christ you gave him your heart as would say you're trusting him for salvation you are a disciple look at the meaning of the words that goes on you is in the New Testament of the conviction and Trust to which a man is impelled by a certain inner and higher prerogative of the law of the soul to trust in Jesus as able to Aid either in obtaining or in doing something Saving Face wow I just described to you the majority of modern Christendom you mean to tell me that Paul would ask them have you all got the Holy Ghost after they've done reach this well isn't the cross enough well apparently Paul did not feel like them accepting his death on the cross and them accepting him as their savior was enough that's Apostolic Doctrine that's the doctrine of the Bible your Bible amen now Paul been some of the modern preachers and said I understand you folks are believers yes we've accepted Jesus Christ we've committed our soul to him we love him with all of our hearts we are completely trusting him and him alone we're not looking to anything we do we're not no works this this is Paul said glory to God Brothers hallelujah amen boy you all have got her but Paul was saying uh y'all just got started y'all just got started have y'all got the holy ghost wonder where we need the Holy Ghost for we've done committed to Christ but you know what they were christless Christians now listen at these people and they said unto him we've not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost wow and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said un John's baptism there several dispensations behind then Paul said John verily baptized with a baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on Christ Jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep which is the only way that you'll find in the scripture that was ever recorded ain't one person in the Bible that was ever baptized in titles you show me and I'll eat the whole book you show me in history for the first 300 years I can take it from one to another to another of historian but what did the devil want to do he wanted to blot out the name of the bridegroom so that when you come to Christianity you'd be married up to titles instead of the name oh Hallelujah which one of you women here today when you would get married would want to be married to your husband hband and just call him son or brother or uncle or nephew and he may be all of them but what did you take on is I performed the wedding yesterday and I introduced that couple as who not Mr and Miss John Doe Mr and Miss son of the father of the grandfather of the great grandfather but I introduce that couple in the name of the bridegroom remember there must be a new name and a new book and a new nature Hallelujah in order to go in the [Applause] Rapture and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus now for those false preachers that have taught that the Holy Ghost is only for the 12 apostles this is several years after Acts 2 and these people here wasn't even preachers now I want you to listen what happened to them after they finally got baptized right well glory to God when Paul laid his hands upon them and the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesy amen well praise the Lord that sounds like an oh ho Holy Ghost oldfashioned Sanctified by my Dynamic power of God Revival movement they were already saved they were already trusting the Lord Jesus they had already earned the title of disciples but they did not have Christ Jesus living in their soul they were not married yet and reunited to another nature so they went down and baptism him in his name what's going on the marriage ceremony do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife do you promise to love to cherish to care for her as long as you both shall live I do do you bride of Christ take him to be your husband will you love him will you obey him will you cherish him will you forsake all others as long as you both shall live I do and then by the power invested in me I pronounce you are man and wife in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you may kiss your bride hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah Romans 10:1 Brethren my heart desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they a might be saved you see that's the way salvation is you might or you might not but election has no mights on W oh I tell you the Lord give me that ear this morning I about had a holy ghost fit that's all right salvation whosoever will y that might and might not but brother when it comes down to election there in't one of them children of God whose names is on that Lamb's Book of Life there ain't enough powers in Hell there ain't enough Darkness to keep them away from him not mik and might not they shall they will Hallelujah because they are part of him the [Applause] husband Romans 10:9 that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Shall Believe in thine heart that God ha raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved with a heart man believeth into righteousness with a mouse confession is made unto salvation how easy it is to quote this and leave out Acts 19 you see well a lot of preachers and a lot of churches are leading the modern-day Christians do you understand where they're going to take them the tribulation period God help me God help us preachers here at this church so people today can be saved and lose their salvation John 3:17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him ah Here We Go Again might might might but let's read Ephesians 1:12 that we should be to the pra of his glory who first trusted in Christ Paul's talking about himself now watch he it brings on down to this is the church that he's birthed through the word and whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and the church said amen but let's not stop there so notice what it happened they had trusted after they heard and the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed so they trusted they heard and they believed and they still wouldn't sealed well and after that Ye beli Ye were Oh you mean they wouldn't see when they believed they except that Christ as their personal savior they trust in him yes that's what he said but he didn't stop he went on they actually were not sealed when they trusted they were not sealed when they believed they were sealed when they received the Holy Ghost according to the Bible how many believes the Bible and whom you also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believed you were sealed all right let's see what the meaning of this word is Mark with a seal for security from Satan Oh Glory to God amen Mark with a seal for security from Satan not when you believe you are sealed not when you heard you are sealed not when you join the church you are sealed but once you receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost you are sealed with a mark from God for a sign of security from the devil and the Devil comes back and say whoa I can only get so close to her I can only get so close to him how do you know he's done married again she got married Oh Glory they have the Seal of authenticity upon their [Applause] soul now friends how many preachers in our modern pull pits preach this from their Bible not ours how many of them is going to stand before God and be held accountable because they never preached this come on Saints watch what the meaning of the word goes on to say Mark with the seal for security from Satan hence to confirm authenticate Place Beyond doubt to prove one's testimony to a person that he is what he professes to be to prove one's testimony to a person that he is what he professes to be thank God for the Holy Ghost thank God for believing thank God for the cross thank God for the blood but it is not the cross that seals you it is not salvation that seals you it is a new nature don't you understand what the Holy Ghost say it's the Lord Jesus in the form of the Holy Spirit coming inside of you reincarnating himself in your [Applause] body verse 14 which is the of our inheritance unto the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory 1 Timothy 2:3 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men to be saved God don't want nobody to be lost but notice it didn't say have all men to receive the Holy Ghost Titus 35 not by works of righteousness which we have done but ACC according to his Mercy he saved us aren't you glad he saved you by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost 2 Peter 3:9 the Lord is not slight concerning his promise as some men count slightness but his longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance God don't want nobody to be lost even though they're not elect right God loved Cain and went after him Revelation 21:22 and I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb of the temple thereof and the city had no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine in it notice it doesn't say the Earth outside the city the light in the city will be sun generated s o n not Su n now I want you to notice it doesn't say on the earth cuz the Earth is going to be inhabited there'll be Kings and Nations and rulers and so on outside the city but I he said I saw no Temple therein for the Lord God Almighty in the lamb or the temple not temples plurals if there's two of them and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them which are ah shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the not the kings of the city the kings of the earth to bring their Glory and Honor so the saved look friends it's all brother Donnie but I work some really good people and they're really nice people sure there's millions of people that are saved people yes John said he saw a multitude who are these John didn't know who they were they were Gentiles John looked and he didn't recognize them brother Jim he said who are these here he said these are they that come out of Great Tribulation yes sir watchh the robes and made them white of the blood of the lamb but notice he don't said they had the Holy Ghost so they were saved people oh come on some don't sit there and look at me but notice when it comes to the elect of God in James 1:18 of his own will begat he Us boy the Free Will Baptist have a hard time with this scripture don't they this is their main split from whatever happened years ago you know pre preil war time whenever they got into that spot one of the things when the main Baptist convention was Free Will Baptist because some of them started to believe in predestination and I said oh no glory to God I'll tell you one thing I made up my mind Hallelujah I'm holding on to my free will my free will is what's got me in so much trouble you might as well say Amen to your old stubborn Free Will is what's got you in so much trouble it' been a whole lot easier on all the rest of us if we have died d our will a long time ago I did not choose to be born again are you going to sit there and tell me that you decided to be born you decided to tell your Earthly father father I want to be born is that okay with you and then you told your mother mother I want you to carry me N9 months will you do you mind doing that come on don't be an idiot it was not you that chose to be born naturally it was not you well I glory to God I done this and that and the other the Bible says of his own will begat he us with the word of Truth why because we were his children before the foundation of the world and he said I will I will that my children be saved I will and then he comes and says because I have so much Mercy in so much love I'm going to open it up for everybody so whosoever will let him come and take of the Water of Life freely can I have a few more minutes before we close John 1:1 he came into his own and his own received him not but to as many as received him them gave he exusia power to become the sons of God become be made come to pass be fulfilled don't you understand you are a prophecy your new birth brought you to pass you came oh children to become you came to pass when you were born of the spirit of God because you're a word a thought that come from God's presence and you staggered right in the darkness and the things of the world and didn't know what no world to look for but just like a promise say of Isaiah 7:14 you believe that's a promise of God a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son we we know the scripture very familiar with it and it laid there for hundreds and hundreds of years but one day that word come to pass all your name was wrote there not the name of your first husband he knew what that name would be but he also o wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world your first book The Book of Life was not wrote before the foundation of the world it's only temporary and it only needs a slot of time do you understand every one of you today that are truly Born Again of the spirit of God you have no more Book of Life you do not have a book of life you are living under the new husband the new nature the Lamb's Book [Applause] but as many as received and to them gave you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of Galatians 4:19 and I'll close my little children of whom I travail in birth until Christ be formed in you just as the formless embryo by degrees starts changing and taking on a form when it's first in the conception the few moments formless for days however long before it starts looking like a human being Paul catches this and he says my little children of whom I travail in burst look at the responsibility on a servant of God until I travail and burst until Christ be formed in you now he's calling them already his children so they Children of the gospel and he's warning them he's wanting them to mature but remember legalism had attacked the church it had delayed the stage of their growth and every time you and I get a setback you may Wonder sometime why is brother Donnie going back and preaching this and this and why why is brother Daryl preaching on that if you only had a little bit of spiritual Insight you'd know that the spirit of God is looking at the embryonic stage of some of those that's under the ministry and seeing that they went back under this sort of legalism or they've leaned too much toward Grace and they're leaning here and Paul said I travail again oh children how many times have you sent me in travail again I'm not here to preach for a living I'm not here to preach for a reputation I'm sent here to try to preach you into a body change I'm sent here to try to preach if you go by the way of the Grave that you will leave this Mortal body and in less than a second you'll step into the sixth dimension in another body I'm not here to preach for my health I'm not here to preach to pry to please you I want to preach unto Christ is formed [Applause] so the Christian by degrees takes on the likeness of Christ Jesus this is why Satan sends things your way and my way to try to stop the image from becoming more clear as our mother packed us many of you in this modern day of course when they've got it to where they can do the scans and so on on the mother I saw one just the other day of somebody here in the church at Carol had showed it to me little T9 and her mama packing it around and his little bitty thumb stuck in its mouth oh Hallelujah it had moved from that embryonic stage where there was no image don't you understand even when we receive the Holy Ghost and the presence of God comes upon us where there in that embryonic stage but who was it Christ Jesus you understand whenever a real child of God receives the Holy Ghost even though they may be so weak and so immature they've already got the potential of the Christ man they've already got the potential of the Christ man being formed inside of them this is wild fridge we pick up we go on we lay aside our mistakes we lay aside our shortcomings Lord men of God don't give up on me men of God don't give up on me keep travailing keep laboring I'm coming I'm on my way I may be behind some of you here today you may be ahead of me don't give up on me don't give up on me keep travailing until the image becomes more defined and more defined till at last the Christian reaches the stature of a perfect man Paul long for these Believers to be transformed in the into the Greek word that he called Moro in Philippians 2:6 it's morphe but here it's a different form of that he wanted them to be formed that Christ would be formed in them oh Hallelujah let's Stand Together can I share another quote with you here before we close the resurrection in 1953 I believe this great commotion that's going across the world now that's called heresy says the people has lost their mind this bunch of people that sold out to the world burned every bridge behind them serving God believing in signs and wonders and miracles and the big formal church is saying they're crazy I believe it's Jesus Christ reincarnated in the human church here on Earth doing signs and wonders every new birth not just accepting salvation but every new birth is a death to that old husband and Christ starts being formed in the soul of that individual their name is transferred they're no longer identified in living under the old book I hope you understand tonight my old book as a sinner is no longer in existence when I make mistakes and fall short of the glory of God that is not going under my old nature of Donald Lee Reagan Jr that book no longer exist he knows I'm a son and when I make a mistake there ain't no need writing it down cuz I'm going to fix it amen why you need to keep a record when it comes to a son or daughter of God you know what I'm saying don't every one of you feel that way as Sons and Daughters of God when you the Lord Smite your heart to convict you you're going to fix it it's inevitable you are going to fix it there ain't no need rid it down again he says if Jesus is risen from the dead living among us tonight then he's reincarnating himself again in his church then he will produce the same thing that he did back there so the fact is God the new birth will be the Lord Jesus reincarnated again in Africa in China Japan huras I don't know about you I want to put out the atmosphere don't you an air as a child of God yes sir Carol and I was in Sams on Friday or Thursday Carol need to go to the bathroom there so we pushed the buggy back there and there's an old lady standing back there and she come to me and she said sir would you please help me I said sure ma' what what's the problem she said I'm wearing a heart monster she said I feel like I'm about to pass out I said all right ma' what you want me to do so she said help help me to sit down there's a little bench of a thing over there and Sams and I help her get seated there and she said would you get my buggy so there was your buggy with a purse and all that so I got her over there got her sit down and said you okay man pat on the shoulder she said no I don't fear either don't fear right she said would you pray for [Music] me how did she even know I believed in prayer you know me I laid hands on her right there in Sams and pray for her I said you all right she said why I'm feeling with better she said my husbands are in resting will you go get him I said yes ma'am I'll go get him so I'm and found him and told him then I come out a few minutes later and Carol was over patting her on the shoulder you know him oh thank you thank you thank you thank you for coming to get me Carol said they're waiting on the wheelchair to come and get her and they're going to have to scir her out and take her to her car so we stayed there a few minutes I said y'all okay and said yeah that old man he said have a good day but I know you will and a few minutes later man Carol was checking out here they come pushing the buggy him and her both walking out no wheelchair needed that's what I'm talking about the Lord Jesus not me not you not you the Lord Jesus Hallelujah don't we want to be that type of Christian where people just know there's something about us and it ain't really us it's our husband we got married we got a new name new book new nature thank you Lord God let's B it together thank you Lord God all friend the prophet says it wasn't so from the beginning every man that's has got to be born again and the sinful nature killed in him and a new man born in him which is Christ Jesus the son of God about your old man patched up somehow the new man is not you fixed it's not you and I repaired it's the son of God Lord Jesus we humbly bow our heads in your presence today we are so blessed to hear such things much less to have it in our possession help us father we don't want to just be church members Lord and we believe that we ought to have a church that we attend yes we believe that Lord we don't want to just do good deeds we believe we should do that too Lord Jesus we want that old man dead Hallelujah not hung up for the occasion we've seen it down Through the Ages that's what's happened to so many people they hung that old man up for the occasion and they run across something they couldn't believe something they couldn't understand and they go right back to that same old husband and they lose their salvation the prophet tells the Salvation is like healing it will hold as long as your faith holds but he sure don't teach us that when it comes to the Seal of God the Seal of God keeps us even when we may feel our flesh wavering and teetering Hallelujah the Seal of god holds us we don't hold it amen oh Jesus come by this way today Lord would you would you pass by this way like you did in the upper coast of Ephesus that day Lord Jesus maybe there's some good disciples here in the building today maybe some stream in the service and they love you they're Christians they love you maybe they've never yet received that new husband that new nature they struggle with this and that and the other and they try and they fall short and they get up and they struggle and they go back and forth back and forth May today be the day Lord God that the Holy Ghost will sweep in this building we know when it happened there in the upper coast of Ephesus there wasn't hundreds of people sitting there like there are here today but there was 12 12 people and the apostolic way of receiving the Holy Ghost was for Paul to lay hands on them and they got their new marriage certificate oh Jesus would you pass this way maybe began on this Pulpit if you would Lord if there's any brother here maybe start here with us and then move toward the back Lord don't leave the sisters out in the nurseries or any brothers that would have their children back there father don't leave anybody out Lord God that would be streaming in France or Switzerland or Norway their service is already gone and they clicked in to be in church with us today may Jesus pass through the upper coast of Norway may Jesus pass to the southern coast of France may Jesus hallelujah hallelujah may you call Lord for that last name Lord oh Jesus so every one of us can be filled so filled that every fiber of our being can be filled with the presence of God oh Jesus we adore you we magnify you mighty God Hallelujah we love you Lord we worship you we adore you blessed God don't you love him children yes maybe if there's anybody here today that's uncertain with no one looking around you just say Brother D I'm just not sure I I want to be sure but I'm just not sure sometimes I think that that old man is dead and then other times I think I don't know just raise your hand to the Lord not so much to me just Lord be mindful of me today friends the seal is what gives you the Assurance your faith your human faith will waver failures will test it falling short of the glory of God will make you question but that seal of the Living God it gives you that trust and that confidence and that assurance that if there ain't but one leaving out a Word of Life Church you'd look me in the face and say brother Donnie you better move somewhere else cuz that one is me that's when we know we've passed from Death unto life Hallelujah we love our brothers oh yes we love them we make differ as far as human makeup and this and that but we love them with a God love and we have an assurance Lord we worship you Jesus sing up here can we just worship him now a little bit won't you just open your heart now maybe some of you need healing maybe some of you need Deliverance of whatever it is we believe remember the same word that applies to Salvation also applies to Healing Soo so it's Deliverance Deliverance of sin rescuing of high blood pressure rescuing you from a temper rescuing you from some type of mental thing that you're dealing with whatever it is praise the Lord oh I'm so glad the old man is dead I'm living under a new name you all know me by Donnie my legal name of course is Donal I really don't like to be called Donald I I prefer to be called Donnie but but that's not even the way the Lord reckons my first and true name I want my nature and my soul to be living under whatever my new name is one day I'll I'll know what it is but I believe I'm living under the influence of that new name that new book and that new nature Right Now Praise the Lord don't you love him children let's worship him together you see before you let's just worship him together now may look a lot the same may look a lot to same how may wear the same clothes some of the same clothes if they're
