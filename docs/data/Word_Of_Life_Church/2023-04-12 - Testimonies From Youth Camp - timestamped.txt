[44:42] foreign
[44:43] [Music]
[44:58] [Music]
[45:13] let's read the scripture together
[45:15] tonight
[45:16] Mark chapter 16.
[45:19] verse 15.
[45:22] and he said unto them
[45:25] go ye into all the world
[45:30] and
[45:33] what preach
[45:37] wow
[45:39] now who is this saying this
[45:42] Jesus the founder of the church
[45:45] the builder of the church
[45:47] this is the way he started it
[45:50] now remember when the prophet was
[45:52] looking for the
[45:53] symbols to be able to type who the
[45:56] church AIDS Messengers would be down
[45:57] Through the Ages God revealed to him a
[46:01] very simple principle
[46:03] it was that God
[46:05] never changes
[46:09] so on that principle he was able to find
[46:12] out who the first church age messenger
[46:14] was and then everyone thereafter by that
[46:17] very same principle it shouldn't be a
[46:20] surprise to us that Satan will want to
[46:22] change that principle
[46:24] in this last day
[46:26] but for myself I can only speak for me
[46:29] of course I ain't going to let him do it
[46:33] if our God is not the same yesterday and
[46:35] forever we are in a mess of trouble
[46:39] now listen what he said
[46:41] go into all the world and preach the
[46:44] gospel to Every Creature he that
[46:48] Believers and is baptized
[46:51] shall be saved shall not be bride
[46:55] but shall be saved
[46:57] but he that believeth not shall be
[47:01] damned now that's pretty simple is it
[47:03] not
[47:04] and these signs might
[47:08] possibly ever now and then
[47:11] these signs shall follow them that
[47:16] believe
[47:18] in my name they shall cast out devils
[47:23] they shall speak with new tongues they
[47:26] shall take up serpents if they drink any
[47:29] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[47:32] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[47:36] shall recover
[47:39] may the Lord bless his words you can be
[47:41] seated we're going to do something a
[47:42] little bit different here tonight you
[47:44] figured that already didn't you
[47:49] the Lord blessed us in such a wonderful
[47:51] way down at um at the youth camp and I'm
[47:56] sure some of you probably
[47:58] streamed it and brother Ron Brother
[48:01] Andrew just did an outstanding job
[48:04] morning services and not services and
[48:07] what the Lord did and I thought tonight
[48:10] that it might be a good thing
[48:12] if we would let some of these young
[48:14] people who have experienced the power of
[48:16] God
[48:17] and some of the things that the Lord has
[48:20] done for them if they would be able to
[48:22] share with you their testimony
[48:26] now you may not know it but there are
[48:28] every year when it comes around the
[48:30] spring camp time there will be preachers
[48:32] that'll start preaching against it and
[48:35] Blasting it don't want their kids to go
[48:37] and all that sort of thing
[48:40] but myself seeing what what has happened
[48:45] at that camp
[48:46] let me give you just a little bit of a
[48:48] background of the camp in Louisiana the
[48:51] first one was in 1987.
[48:54] brother John LaFontaine preached it it
[48:57] was not at the current location where
[48:58] it's been since most of you all have
[49:00] been there but it was at a very small
[49:03] place
[49:04] the second year there was a hillbilly
[49:07] boy that preached it from Kentucky
[49:11] 1988.
[49:13] and thereafter I preached it for many
[49:15] years
[49:16] and it was about probably 89 me and
[49:18] Carol was trying to think about either
[49:19] 89 or 90 that we started taking a
[49:23] busload sometimes two bus loads of our
[49:26] kids down there
[49:28] now I've not done this because I feel
[49:30] that it's the political correct thing to
[49:33] do
[49:34] I've done it because I have with my own
[49:37] eyes
[49:39] seen what the Lord God has done
[49:41] and change people's lives forever
[49:45] absolutely forever people that's gotten
[49:48] saved people's got filled the Holy Ghost
[49:50] people that's gotten healed just
[49:53] phenomenal things that's happened and
[49:56] let me say this if I ever felt like that
[49:59] this Camp got to a spot to where it was
[50:01] not worth our support I would be the
[50:03] first one to withdraw from it I mean if
[50:05] you don't have one thing to worry about
[50:06] on that but as long as it goes in the
[50:09] direction of the message of the hour and
[50:11] the spirit of God moving in that
[50:13] direction I want to get behind him with
[50:15] all of my heart
[50:17] I think brother Tim is feeling sorry for
[50:19] me since I'm getting so old and can't
[50:21] hardly get around and all that stuff no
[50:23] more so he wanted to give me a couple
[50:25] more times to preach before I uh retire
[50:28] I guess you know but I'll have to say in
[50:31] the last couple years it's just been
[50:32] such a a wonderful experience and to see
[50:36] the lives of the kids that have been
[50:38] changed there and it makes it quite
[50:40] difficult for some of them because they
[50:42] come there and they feel the presence of
[50:44] God in a way that they've never felt it
[50:47] before and sad to say some of them go
[50:49] back to their home church and then they
[50:52] hear emotion hammered and they hear all
[50:54] this and that and the other hammered you
[50:56] ought to be so grateful that you attend
[50:58] a church that believes the scripture
[51:00] that we just read here
[51:08] I personally don't think that God wants
[51:10] to move one time a year and limit it to
[51:13] Dry Creek Louisiana
[51:15] I think he wants to move among us every
[51:17] time we come together myself don't you
[51:20] the only reason he doesn't move in a
[51:22] greater way I believe is because our
[51:24] expectation is not any higher I don't
[51:27] think any of us could ever go beyond
[51:29] what God wants to do Among Us great
[51:33] Supernatural phenomenal things many of
[51:36] you saw the ones that was prayed for of
[51:39] course the prayer line a couple hours
[51:40] long I don't even know how many people
[51:41] prayed for several hundred seem like
[51:43] some of them come through five or six
[51:45] times to me
[51:46] but naturally I was in the thick of it
[51:48] so it might seemed that way but the Lord
[51:52] did wonderful absolutely wonderful
[51:54] things I've already heard so many
[51:56] wonderful things that God did
[51:58] one one lady was there I heard about it
[52:01] today of a report from brother Timothy
[52:04] and the message was new relatively new
[52:07] to her and hadn't been married that long
[52:10] and she looked up on the platform and
[52:13] she nudged her husband and said you see
[52:16] them two angels standing up there
[52:18] and there was one on one side of brother
[52:20] Ron and one on the other side and they
[52:23] were kind of supporting him as he was
[52:25] preaching
[52:29] praise the Lord
[52:34] Hallelujah for those of you that were
[52:36] there and knew that there was a
[52:37] supernatural special something there but
[52:41] don't just limit it to Louisiana now
[52:42] because it ain't been that long ago one
[52:44] of the young sisters from our church saw
[52:46] an angel of the Lord stand on the
[52:48] platform
[52:50] in our church why shouldn't it be
[52:53] brother Branham said if you live close
[52:55] to God and you have the right type of
[52:56] homes the angels will visit your homes
[53:00] it don't have to be a church house it
[53:02] could be your house
[53:05] amen
[53:08] I believe myself that we
[53:11] are living
[53:13] in a great time
[53:16] amen I believe the Lord is going to
[53:20] manifest himself
[53:22] in a way that we've longed to see for a
[53:24] long long time
[53:26] I believe that with our young people
[53:29] that they should not be and I mentioned
[53:32] that to them in Louisiana they are not
[53:34] just the Church of tomorrow they're the
[53:36] Church of right now
[53:37] I love to see him sing don't you I love
[53:40] to see him play in musical instruments
[53:42] and clapping their hands and I love to
[53:44] see them sitting up here in the front I
[53:46] don't mind some of you Old-Timers
[53:47] setting up there with them but
[53:49] I love to see these young people up
[53:52] there in the front and worship in the
[53:53] Lord and praising the Lord I'm so
[53:56] grateful for that aren't you parents
[53:58] aren't your grandparents
[54:03] William Bachelor they're seeing them
[54:04] here than out shooting up in some kind
[54:06] of dope and drunk and and all that sort
[54:09] of thing huh I want to see him drunk all
[54:11] right but drunk on the Holy Ghost
[54:13] that's right so why should we as the
[54:16] older generation around this message why
[54:18] should we not want our children to have
[54:21] an ax to experience with God why should
[54:24] we not want them to see that he's the
[54:27] same yesterday today and forever that
[54:30] what he said in his word that he still
[54:32] does that
[54:34] as long as I'm your pastor here that's
[54:36] the way I'm going to preach it because
[54:37] that's the way I believe that the
[54:40] message come to restore our hearts back
[54:42] to the face of the original Apostolic
[54:45] fathers how many believe is it tonight
[54:47] with all your heart
[54:49] brother Rob
[54:51] brother Rob's gonna
[54:53] kind of help some of the youth here some
[54:55] of them didn't want to get up and
[54:57] testify they're a little bit nervous so
[55:00] I guess I've been nervous eliminate you
[55:02] from doing it I don't have to preach no
[55:03] more to them
[55:05] but I told Brother Rob if they felt
[55:07] nervous and didn't feel comfortable in
[55:08] doing it that maybe brother Rob could
[55:10] just read it for you but there's a few
[55:12] that I think wanted to maybe be able to
[55:15] do it but let me just tell you know we
[55:17] don't believe in women preachers so your
[55:19] sisters now you just keep it keep it
[55:21] keep it light you know so
[55:24] but I'm so grateful for what I see the
[55:28] Lord doing Among Us Friday morning Carol
[55:30] and I we stayed in DeRidder Louisiana at
[55:33] a hotel there so who he was coming out
[55:35] going to the service on Friday morning
[55:37] and I saw the bus setting over Todd
[55:40] Lowe's written on the side of it said
[55:41] gray on the address so I figured it's
[55:43] probably the one that brought our kids
[55:45] down
[55:46] so I walked over there and the bus
[55:47] driver started the bus and opened the
[55:49] door so I walked over to where he was
[55:51] and I said hey morning are you morning
[55:55] and he said y'all going to the camp of
[55:58] course he'd done seen my wife there long
[56:00] hair dress you know I said yes sir we
[56:03] are he said I brought a whole bus load
[56:06] of them kids down from Johnson City
[56:10] I said yes sir I know I'm their pastor
[56:14] he said I'm gonna tell you one thing
[56:15] them kids had Church
[56:22] praise the Lord
[56:27] I didn't tell him but I was thinking if
[56:30] you think they had it coming down you're
[56:32] in for it when they come back
[56:35] he said I've took groups all over
[56:37] everywhere I've drove all kinds of
[56:39] people to different things I have never
[56:41] enjoyed taking a group of people
[56:44] anywhere any better than I joined
[56:47] breaking them kids to Louisiana
[56:57] that makes me proud of you as your
[57:00] pastor not only that your conduct is
[57:02] good but that whether you're on a bus
[57:04] whether you're in Cracker Barrel or
[57:06] wherever you are that you're able to let
[57:09] your light shine from what I understand
[57:11] some of the people at Cracker Barrel
[57:13] they found out y'all was going to a camp
[57:15] so they want y'all to stop as you come
[57:16] back you stopped at Bucky's going down
[57:19] they wanted you to stop at Bucky's
[57:21] coming back
[57:23] you see you may think I'll never preach
[57:26] I may never prophesy but your light is
[57:29] shining
[57:30] how long does it take well how long does
[57:32] it take to turn a light on and it
[57:34] dispelled the darkness does it take a
[57:36] lot 48 hours to eliminate your bedroom
[57:38] your bathroom no as soon as you flip the
[57:41] switch whether or not you know it
[57:43] angels of the Lord
[57:46] are with God's people
[57:48] we're around it so much if we're not
[57:51] careful it'll become so common to us and
[57:54] we don't realize how blessed we are to
[57:57] be walking in the light
[57:59] amen let's just give them a nice hand
[58:01] tonight
[58:02] [Applause]
[58:17] all right everyone hello hello your
[58:20] hello
[58:21] all right this is one that she's not
[58:23] here today because she's not feeling
[58:25] well but she wanted to send this to send
[58:27] in this testimony
[58:34] this is uh Sister Chloe Dixon
[58:37] Friday I went up for prayer telling
[58:39] brother Timothy
[58:40] that Satan kept telling me I would never
[58:43] get the Holy Ghost and it was just
[58:45] impossible for someone like me
[58:47] Saturday night God revealed to me that I
[58:50] had the Holy Ghost I came home and my
[58:53] parents told me that I had no more fear
[58:55] or worry in my eyes
[58:57] okay
[59:06] I'm uh I'm sick right now because
[59:08] apparently Satan thinks that he can stop
[59:10] me but I know it just means he's mad
[59:13] because he knows he doesn't have power
[59:15] over me anymore
[59:17] praise the Lord Sister Chloe Dixon
[59:22] and uh so I want to I want to tell you
[59:25] this as far as on the camp it's
[59:26] something that brother Tony and first of
[59:28] all I want to thank all the the
[59:29] chaperones brother Tony and sister
[59:31] Jennifer brother uh hornyak John hornyak
[59:35] of course was wonderful uh sister Heidi
[59:37] don't know what we've done without you
[59:39] uh brother Jason that was great the
[59:41] gumbo was fantastic wherever he is
[59:44] um
[59:44] we had a wonderful time we've always had
[59:47] a wonderful time but brother we started
[59:49] uh talking and brother Tony mentioned to
[59:51] me he's like why do you do this
[59:53] and I had to think about it why do I do
[59:55] this
[59:56] and what came to me was the fact that I
[59:58] it's easy to love the children that is
[1:00:01] in me to love children and to want to
[1:00:04] spend time with and be with them and I
[1:00:06] recognize it as a massive privilege okay
[1:00:08] it is a privilege there was another
[1:00:10] brother as the prayer line was coming
[1:00:11] out there were brothers and sisters
[1:00:13] young brothers and sisters coming out
[1:00:14] and it's like I looked at him and I it
[1:00:16] struck me I get to be here I get to
[1:00:18] witness some of these things that are
[1:00:20] happening with God's people and I get to
[1:00:22] be part of it that that is such an
[1:00:24] awesome thing so I have enjoyed four
[1:00:27] years because I never had it as a child
[1:00:29] I've enjoyed for so many years being
[1:00:31] able to go to camp and spend these times
[1:00:33] and watch things these things happen
[1:00:35] some of the strongest experiences with
[1:00:37] the Lord that I have ever had and I
[1:00:39] think a lot of it is because of
[1:00:40] expectation you don't have to work and
[1:00:42] you go and you just dedicate that time
[1:00:44] to the Lord but I'm looking forward to
[1:00:46] tonight that we've not done this before
[1:00:47] because one of the things in my heart
[1:00:49] was that if they could only share with
[1:00:51] you what their experience is to share it
[1:00:53] with the rest of the body to encourage
[1:00:54] the body and let you know what it is
[1:00:56] that I have seen for years
[1:00:58] the the trip on being on the bus
[1:01:00] physically is tough I slept for I think
[1:01:02] three days and I'm still not caught up
[1:01:03] but
[1:01:05] it's worth it it is worth it and to get
[1:01:08] them tonight to be able to share some of
[1:01:10] their their thoughts and their
[1:01:12] experiences with you today is a joy to
[1:01:14] me to share that as I had a little boy
[1:01:16] in my in my dorm and we all went around
[1:01:19] we said where we were from and he I had
[1:01:21] the 14 year olds which was tougher than
[1:01:22] the 18 year olds but 14 year olds and
[1:01:24] and we asked I made them say well what
[1:01:26] their name was where were they from how
[1:01:27] many camps they've been to and who was
[1:01:29] their pastor and it came to me and I
[1:01:31] said in brother Donny's my pastor and we
[1:01:33] had the first night had opened up and it
[1:01:35] was just wide open the spirit was so
[1:01:37] strong it was wonderful if you got to
[1:01:38] check that service out and that little
[1:01:39] 14 year old said brother Donnie is your
[1:01:42] pastor
[1:01:43] and I'm like yeah
[1:01:45] because he had experienced the power of
[1:01:47] God go through that camp like he had
[1:01:48] never known anything before so I pray
[1:01:50] that it doesn't become common to you
[1:01:51] right that it should not ever be common
[1:01:54] okay
[1:01:59] okay
[1:02:01] now to the young people
[1:02:03] as I told you on the bus I know all of
[1:02:05] you have a testimony
[1:02:07] all of you have a testimony okay and I
[1:02:09] love you and you can stick your foot on
[1:02:11] the devil's neck as I told you and and
[1:02:14] really hit him in the in the nose and
[1:02:16] and punch him out by doing a testified
[1:02:18] experience here what you received in
[1:02:20] Camp but if you don't and you're not
[1:02:22] ready for that I love you anyway
[1:02:25] okay and it's a button you feed your
[1:02:27] experience so that's what we're looking
[1:02:28] to do all right so who's ready
[1:02:35] who's ready to give their testimony come
[1:02:37] on up
[1:02:38] come on up
[1:02:41] now here as she's coming up
[1:02:43] you all of you children are in a very
[1:02:45] safe place these people are filled with
[1:02:47] people that love you and this is your
[1:02:48] church family
[1:02:50] okay
[1:02:55] so I just want to start off by saying
[1:02:57] excuse the voice it's all from camp and
[1:03:00] also I just want to thank you brother
[1:03:01] Donnie for making us a way to go and
[1:03:04] brother Robin Sister Sarah and all the
[1:03:06] counselors
[1:03:07] but I'm just going
[1:03:09] to be honest here before I came to this
[1:03:11] Camp I was just struggling and I just
[1:03:13] felt like giving up at all
[1:03:15] the Lord brought me into a higher spot
[1:03:17] this past weekend and one thing God
[1:03:19] really spoke to me Saturday night was
[1:03:20] when brother Ron said to say out loud
[1:03:22] that you told that devil can't you tell
[1:03:25] that devil don't come back home they say
[1:03:27] it out loud your body obeys your
[1:03:29] confession like what brother Donnie has
[1:03:31] been preaching on and that whole service
[1:03:33] I felt from the beginning Satan was
[1:03:34] trying to take over and telling me I'm
[1:03:36] not gonna get any fit anything from this
[1:03:38] service
[1:03:39] but from just saying that confession out
[1:03:41] loud I felt a total peace and that thing
[1:03:43] totally left me the Satan was trying to
[1:03:46] bring on me and another thing God did
[1:03:48] for me was when I was in that prayer
[1:03:50] line the sister tells another sister
[1:03:52] that just start thanking God for
[1:03:53] everything before you even walk through
[1:03:55] it and that just helped me so much and I
[1:03:57] just started thanking the Lord for
[1:03:59] everything because Satan was trying to
[1:04:01] come back again trying to tell me you're
[1:04:02] not going to get anything from this
[1:04:04] prayer line but I just kept on singing
[1:04:06] to the Lord and thanking him because I
[1:04:07] knew I was going to get a breakthrough
[1:04:09] because Satan was telling me that and as
[1:04:11] I was walking through the prayer line
[1:04:13] they were singing the song Stay
[1:04:15] and I told the Lord please Lord stay I
[1:04:18] know you'll never leave me nor forsake
[1:04:20] me but just stay in my heart don't let
[1:04:22] it just be a camp experience and I was
[1:04:24] going through brothers were just saying
[1:04:26] bless her Lord and I was like Lord I
[1:04:28] just need something more than that some
[1:04:30] brother to just speak to my heart and I
[1:04:32] can't remember all the words brother
[1:04:33] Matthew McGarry said to me but something
[1:04:36] just came over me and I couldn't contain
[1:04:38] myself and I just started thanking the
[1:04:40] lord and like brother Donnie said in one
[1:04:42] of the services this past weekend that I
[1:04:44] got more at that campaign I got more at
[1:04:47] that camp more than just emotion but
[1:04:49] power and I believe that with my whole
[1:04:51] heart I did amen
[1:05:03] if you have a testimony why don't you
[1:05:05] come over here and sit in the front if
[1:05:07] you want to do that
[1:05:11] so
[1:05:13] just to testify
[1:05:16] before Louisiana can't Satan and try to
[1:05:19] bind me with
[1:05:20] a major complex in my life
[1:05:23] and as brother Donnie has taught us many
[1:05:25] times before when the devil lies to you
[1:05:27] sometimes you just need to open up your
[1:05:29] mouth and talk right back to him
[1:05:32] in the day before when we were leaving
[1:05:34] for Camp before I left to go to the bus
[1:05:38] the devil had been lying to me that
[1:05:40] whole time
[1:05:41] because those were shackles that I
[1:05:43] couldn't break on my own
[1:05:45] but I serve a God who has a promise that
[1:05:47] he will deliver me out of every trouble
[1:05:49] even complexes
[1:05:52] and so when he was saying all those
[1:05:55] things
[1:05:56] I took the time to go outside and I put
[1:05:59] him in his place and I said devil it
[1:06:01] don't matter what you say what matters
[1:06:03] is God's word is true and I will get the
[1:06:06] victory over you this weekend and I will
[1:06:09] not leave that camp with those same
[1:06:12] complexes
[1:06:14] and so I went in faith to that camp
[1:06:16] believing that God was going to touch me
[1:06:19] and Saturday
[1:06:21] the devil had been
[1:06:24] telling me that I wasn't going to get
[1:06:25] anything in that prayer line
[1:06:28] and I was going to walk through that
[1:06:30] platform and what nothing was going to
[1:06:32] happen and that I wasn't I was going to
[1:06:34] have those same complexes and I was just
[1:06:37] just give up just live with it
[1:06:39] but there was another report
[1:06:42] [Applause]
[1:06:43] and God said
[1:06:46] that he was going to do something
[1:06:47] amazing for me in that prayer line
[1:06:50] and that I was going to walk off that
[1:06:52] platform completely free
[1:06:54] and I believe that report
[1:06:56] and I walked through the prayer line
[1:06:58] just sincere and trusting the Lord and
[1:07:00] what he had promised
[1:07:02] and all of a sudden
[1:07:07] that dumb complex
[1:07:10] left my body and I know that I know that
[1:07:13] I know
[1:07:14] that is not coming back
[1:07:17] it's not welcomed in my heart anymore
[1:07:19] and the next thing that I knew God was I
[1:07:21] was slain in the spirit and just
[1:07:22] thanking God and I was carried into the
[1:07:24] back room
[1:07:26] foreign
[1:07:28] complex can't come back anymore I am a
[1:07:31] free woman
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:40] praise the Lord
[1:07:44] not really sure what to say but I just
[1:07:46] want to give praise to the Lord last
[1:07:48] year I was really struggling in my
[1:07:50] Christian Mock and felt like Satan was
[1:07:53] really trying to grab a hold of my life
[1:07:55] and I felt like the Lord did a lot of
[1:07:58] good things for me I felt like the Lord
[1:08:00] filled me with the Holy Ghost last year
[1:08:02] and since that time things happened and
[1:08:06] found myself struggling again and
[1:08:10] beginning to doubt Lord did you really
[1:08:13] do for me what I thought you did
[1:08:15] and it's simple but all I have to say is
[1:08:19] I went to this camp and I was delivered
[1:08:23] from that
[1:08:24] and no matter what doubts that the devil
[1:08:27] may bring my way I know that I know that
[1:08:30] I know I have the Holy Ghost
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:36] [Applause]
[1:08:40] I just want to thank all the staff and
[1:08:42] the Lord for being there for me during
[1:08:44] Camp it has been an amazing opportunity
[1:08:47] it is my first Camp so it was kind of
[1:08:50] new to me to talk to the people and to
[1:08:53] Fellowship as much as I did I have been
[1:08:55] struggling with anxiety and depression
[1:08:57] and suicidal thoughts for as long as I
[1:09:00] can remember I have shut my family out
[1:09:03] my church family I've shut God out and
[1:09:08] oh and I went to Camp I really believed
[1:09:11] that something was going to happen there
[1:09:13] that I was going to change
[1:09:15] thou I was going to hear God
[1:09:17] Saturday night was so special to me I
[1:09:19] went to that prayer line believing that
[1:09:22] I wasn't good enough believing that
[1:09:24] nothing was going to happen so something
[1:09:27] did
[1:09:28] God spoke to me for the first time he
[1:09:31] told me that I was good enough he told
[1:09:33] me that I am worth fighting for and I
[1:09:36] believe that I am good enough now I
[1:09:39] believe I'm worth fighting for and I
[1:09:41] know that he is greater than anxiety he
[1:09:43] is stronger than my fears and I am here
[1:09:45] today to testify to that I just want to
[1:09:48] thank him and praise him for everything
[1:09:50] that he's done for me thank you thank
[1:09:53] you
[1:10:00] [Applause]
[1:10:04] um so like Chloe I don't have much of a
[1:10:06] voice from Camp so just bear with me
[1:10:09] um my testimony starts actually the week
[1:10:11] before Camp when brother Aaron Oglesby
[1:10:13] was here
[1:10:14] that weekend all of his Services were
[1:10:16] just amazing and Saturday night in
[1:10:18] particular it spoke to me he'd been
[1:10:20] talking about clearing everything out of
[1:10:22] your life that was sin and I could hide
[1:10:24] it from everyone else but God would
[1:10:25] still know it was there
[1:10:27] at that point I knew it was in my life
[1:10:29] and what needed out
[1:10:31] so that night after the service I went
[1:10:33] up for prayer the desire for me the
[1:10:35] desire for it left me right then I knew
[1:10:37] I was free of it a couple days later it
[1:10:39] was time to go to camp and you know when
[1:10:43] you're surrounded by people that it's
[1:10:44] not as hard to fight the devil because
[1:10:46] they're all fighting with you and you're
[1:10:48] just you're not really thinking about it
[1:10:50] but that weekend at Camp the devil kept
[1:10:53] telling me that like you're not free
[1:10:54] you're gonna go home with that same
[1:10:56] thing and you're gonna fall right back
[1:10:58] into that sin
[1:10:59] well Friday afternoon they had a skit
[1:11:02] and then it forever changed my life it
[1:11:05] was about holding on the baggage and on
[1:11:07] the worldly peanuts
[1:11:09] you can't go into heaven with baggage
[1:11:12] one of the sisters played a role of a
[1:11:14] person that
[1:11:16] knew they were wrong and what what was
[1:11:18] in their life but they wasn't ready to
[1:11:19] give it up yet and when the time came to
[1:11:22] go into the Rapture she was still
[1:11:23] holding on to it the Rapture takes no
[1:11:25] baggage and she was left behind
[1:11:28] so the next night was the prayer line
[1:11:30] and the service from a few weeks ago
[1:11:32] that brother Donnie had preached came
[1:11:33] into my mind the service where he was
[1:11:35] talking about double slaying devils
[1:11:37] so I told the devil I said you're done
[1:11:39] right here tonight you was done last
[1:11:41] weekend but tonight is the night your
[1:11:43] head gets cut off
[1:11:44] I walked through that prayer line and
[1:11:46] I've never felt such an amount of
[1:11:47] freedom
[1:11:48] I came home and I've not had the desire
[1:11:50] for it since overall the Lord just took
[1:11:53] me and asked this question what in this
[1:11:55] world is worth being left behind
[1:11:58] and let me tell you there's nothing
[1:11:59] absolutely nothing
[1:12:01] I may have to fight to keep my ground
[1:12:03] but the freedom and joy and altogether
[1:12:06] assurance that I have is worth every
[1:12:09] battle so just thank you Lord amen
[1:12:19] so this was my first year and I was
[1:12:24] expecting a lot to happen
[1:12:27] so after the skit that they had it
[1:12:31] really touched me so when I was at the
[1:12:34] altar I was praying for the Holy Ghost
[1:12:37] to enter me after a few minutes of
[1:12:41] praying I felt something hit my heart
[1:12:44] and it was
[1:12:45] probably the best feeling I've ever had
[1:12:47] in my life
[1:12:50] and after that night I knew I was free
[1:12:55] Frozen
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:04] so this year Camp the lord gave me one
[1:13:07] of the best experiences in my life and
[1:13:09] I'm never going to forget it
[1:13:11] uh Friday night
[1:13:14] god Set Me Free he changed my life I
[1:13:18] felt like a new person
[1:13:20] Saturday night I went through the prayer
[1:13:23] line and I remember
[1:13:25] very clearly
[1:13:28] brother Tim saying he sees your desire
[1:13:32] I fell in the floor and they had to
[1:13:34] carry me to a chair and I'm sitting
[1:13:36] there for a little bit and a couple
[1:13:38] people were praying for me and so then I
[1:13:42] start to get up and go back to my seat
[1:13:43] and that's the thing I know I'm running
[1:13:46] around the building uh
[1:13:49] and now I can say without a doubt the
[1:13:53] lord gave me my desire and he filled me
[1:13:55] with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:06] I'm sitting on the back row and he
[1:14:08] almost hit me
[1:14:11] I thought I had something short but
[1:14:13] after all these that's in the typing I
[1:14:15] kept doing so it's a little bit longer
[1:14:16] but
[1:14:18] um I just really really appreciate being
[1:14:20] able to to do this and to testify and I
[1:14:23] think it helps me
[1:14:24] just thinking about it and instead of
[1:14:27] thinking in vague terms instead of like
[1:14:28] well yeah God moved or a lot you know
[1:14:31] it's just great I can think about really
[1:14:33] what God's done for us specifically so
[1:14:37] um so I've been to camp seven or eight
[1:14:39] times probably I think for to Louisiana
[1:14:40] camp but uh I just noticed and it
[1:14:43] impressed on me this year how unified it
[1:14:47] seemed like it was more than ever
[1:14:49] whether it was the counselors or the
[1:14:51] deacons or the first year Campers or
[1:14:53] everybody it was just much more it
[1:14:56] seemed even though everybody's you know
[1:14:57] it's always young everyone seemed mature
[1:15:00] and that was kind of the general
[1:15:01] attitude
[1:15:03] so one one night I don't remember which
[1:15:05] year which night it was brother Daryl
[1:15:07] Baxter and brother Tim Winters prayed
[1:15:08] with me and uh and I believe I was
[1:15:11] delivered of some some doubts and fears
[1:15:12] that I had
[1:15:14] um and then in the prayer line this year
[1:15:16] like I said I wanted to be specific and
[1:15:18] I'd heard on on tapes before where you
[1:15:20] know
[1:15:21] um
[1:15:22] brother Branham said you know tell God
[1:15:24] why you want to be healed or or or to
[1:15:26] speak like that so uh so I I asked God
[1:15:30] for a refilling of the Holy Ghost and a
[1:15:32] greater experience with God so that I
[1:15:35] could tell my family especially one or
[1:15:38] two specific people
[1:15:39] um what God's done for me
[1:15:42] um so God granted that request a lot of
[1:15:44] my family's hearing it right now but I
[1:15:46] may have to go out of my way for the
[1:15:47] rest
[1:15:48] um
[1:15:49] so uh both are both during the prayer
[1:15:52] line and Sunday morning are received a
[1:15:55] Special Touch from from God's presence
[1:15:57] and uh while Andrew Spencer was
[1:15:59] preaching on Sunday morning he looked at
[1:16:00] me and said come on brother Airwood
[1:16:02] God's on your side so I don't I really
[1:16:06] don't know I think it's about 50 50 on
[1:16:07] whether or not he knows my name
[1:16:09] so even if he actually even if he does
[1:16:12] know my name I still believe it was was
[1:16:14] God's leading for him to speak to me and
[1:16:17] that he has a plan and is on my side
[1:16:20] so even though I'm not as old as some
[1:16:22] people that went to camp and definitely
[1:16:24] not more mature I definitely got a
[1:16:26] blessing out of seeing the Lord work in
[1:16:29] every one pretty much every one of our
[1:16:31] kids uh Hearts this year you know so and
[1:16:35] I also wanted to say that I mean even if
[1:16:37] there's only
[1:16:38] five or six or seven that that say
[1:16:40] something right here I I think that
[1:16:43] everybody else should take notice to to
[1:16:45] everyone's lives later on and if you if
[1:16:49] you want to know ask somebody and I
[1:16:51] think they'd be willing to tell you
[1:16:52] because you know shyness is a lot of it
[1:16:54] and I don't think anybody anybody that
[1:16:57] went to camp and got something is
[1:16:59] ashamed they just you know just have
[1:17:01] different personalities so
[1:17:04] praise the Lord
[1:17:06] and I wanna I wanna thank you Paul for
[1:17:08] helping me on this trip Paul was a great
[1:17:11] assistance to me and he Brit role for
[1:17:12] everybody to make sure everybody got
[1:17:13] back on the bus we didn't leave anybody
[1:17:15] behind and you made it very easy on me
[1:17:17] and I thank you for that very very much
[1:17:19] uh all right is there any other
[1:17:22] testimonies that I missed
[1:17:25] absolutely
[1:17:29] well I went to this camp with um very
[1:17:32] high expectations and I knew exactly
[1:17:35] what I was going I was going for
[1:17:38] and um Satan you know I I went a day
[1:17:41] late but you know uh Satan kept trying
[1:17:44] and trying to hold me back and until you
[1:17:47] know tell me you're not going to get
[1:17:48] there you're not going to get there
[1:17:49] because I mean there were so many things
[1:17:51] that went on that
[1:17:52] you know just kept delaying and delaying
[1:17:56] me getting there but um
[1:17:58] I I uh I knew that I was going to get
[1:18:01] there and so if he was fighting me that
[1:18:04] hard I knew there was something in store
[1:18:06] um Saturday night the devil throughout
[1:18:09] the whole service just tried telling me
[1:18:11] um don't go through that prayer line
[1:18:13] there's no need there's no need I mean
[1:18:15] you don't need to go through it and um
[1:18:18] but right before the prayer line started
[1:18:20] brother Ron he said something he said
[1:18:22] young people come I'm getting into this
[1:18:25] line later when he said that
[1:18:30] I do
[1:18:32] I needed to go through that
[1:18:40] that's good
[1:18:46] but when I walked through that prayer
[1:18:48] line
[1:18:48] oh yeah
[1:18:51] someone pray the brothers started
[1:18:53] praying
[1:18:54] and uh
[1:18:56] and one Minister exactly prayed exactly
[1:18:59] when I was when I when I went through
[1:19:01] when I when I wanted and uh
[1:19:04] and right after that Lord I just I just
[1:19:08] felt something the Lord dropped the Holy
[1:19:10] Ghost into my heart
[1:19:15] I'll never be the same
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:21] praise the Lord
[1:19:22] [Applause]
[1:19:32] God bless y'all I try to be quick
[1:19:35] um so for myself my own personal
[1:19:37] testimony the first year I went was in
[1:19:40] 2018
[1:19:41] and
[1:19:43] you know I was just 12 turning 13 don't
[1:19:46] know
[1:19:47] I know Jesus loves me but beyond that
[1:19:49] and I didn't really read my Bible or
[1:19:51] maybe some Sunday school stuff but
[1:19:55] um it was there at the camp I was uh
[1:19:58] I was thinking uh you know heard about
[1:20:01] getting baptized it sounds kind of fun
[1:20:03] there's a pool if I do it mom might like
[1:20:06] me a bit more you know
[1:20:09] and it was during the skit of that year
[1:20:12] I was sitting in the back of the church
[1:20:15] and it was called choosing Barabbas
[1:20:19] and the Lord just that was the first
[1:20:21] time he spoke to my heart
[1:20:22] and
[1:20:24] it was then and there at that camp as I
[1:20:26] wanted to be saved I fell in love with
[1:20:29] my Lord Jesus and I just said Lord
[1:20:31] I'm yours and from that year on here I
[1:20:35] still am you know no matter what's come
[1:20:39] they have already stopped me yet so
[1:20:41] I don't think he's going to
[1:20:43] but for uh for this year
[1:20:46] um
[1:20:47] I just uh was very had a very specific
[1:20:50] need in my heart for uh the prayer line
[1:20:53] and
[1:20:55] um
[1:20:56] you know sometimes uh if the devil can't
[1:20:59] get you one way then he wants to get
[1:21:02] your surroundings attack your family or
[1:21:04] just make sickness come whatever it be
[1:21:07] and we just spend
[1:21:10] going through some stuff as a family
[1:21:12] struggling and helping each other out
[1:21:14] and you know it's just tension builds
[1:21:17] and such and
[1:21:19] I went through that line and I said Lord
[1:21:22] you know you gave me the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:21:25] so grateful for it but I want my I want
[1:21:27] my brother and my sister to get it
[1:21:30] and I've been praying you know I see
[1:21:32] these young sisters come up here and
[1:21:34] they'll dance before they were in the
[1:21:36] worship I said I want my sister up there
[1:21:37] too
[1:21:40] and
[1:21:42] you know brother Donnie was talking
[1:21:43] about it doesn't have to be at a youth
[1:21:46] camp it doesn't have to be in a church
[1:21:48] it can be at your home if you invite him
[1:21:50] there it was 2 p.m this morning we were
[1:21:54] all gathered together at the kitchen
[1:21:55] table
[1:21:56] you know wasn't expecting this but I
[1:22:00] guess today was the day so we were just
[1:22:03] talking and
[1:22:05] praying and something real sweet came in
[1:22:07] my heart and I turned to my sister and
[1:22:11] I said
[1:22:13] are you saved she said yes the Lord's My
[1:22:17] Savior all right filled with the Holy
[1:22:19] Ghost
[1:22:20] she just starts breaking and the tears
[1:22:22] start trickling down and she's says no
[1:22:26] do you want it she says
[1:22:28] I want it I want it we all just as a
[1:22:32] family stood up and laid our hands on
[1:22:34] her and she she received it today and we
[1:22:36] testify of that
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:39] [Applause]
[1:22:43] so it doesn't have to be in a church it
[1:22:47] doesn't have to be in a conventional
[1:22:48] setting you know if you call him on the
[1:22:51] scene he'll come
[1:22:52] some real that same sweet feeling just
[1:22:55] started feeling all of us I turned to my
[1:22:57] brother I said Joseph you want it to
[1:23:03] you he's starting to cry over there he
[1:23:04] that's what he was dead he rose up his
[1:23:06] head and said yes I want it too so I
[1:23:08] just want to say
[1:23:09] uh we have this uh plastered in our wall
[1:23:12] in the house as for me and my family we
[1:23:15] will serve the Lord and this day that
[1:23:17] scripture is fulfilled for our family
[1:23:18] God bless you

[1:27:00] some of the kids you know you
[1:27:02] I hate to say it
[1:27:04] but you you say well
[1:27:07] this one man that one's looking for a
[1:27:09] boyfriend or looking for a girlfriend
[1:27:11] there was none of that I didn't get any
[1:27:13] kind of uh
[1:27:16] entertainment or whatever vibe from any
[1:27:19] of the kids they had one mind
[1:27:24] and they went on that bus
[1:27:27] they went to camp
[1:27:29] and our church joined up with brother
[1:27:32] Tim's church and brother uh
[1:27:35] brother Bennett's church and all these
[1:27:37] other little little groups and we joined
[1:27:39] together one mind
[1:27:43] and I'm telling you if you haven't
[1:27:45] watched those Services if you haven't
[1:27:46] streamed those services
[1:27:48] you're going to see that that one mind
[1:27:51] come together
[1:27:53] and God come down it was absolutely
[1:27:56] phenomenal
[1:27:57] I've been in a lot of services I've been
[1:28:00] in prayer lines before
[1:28:03] man
[1:28:06] just wow I'm Josiah wow
[1:28:10] wow
[1:28:12] I would ride 19 hours in a little bitty
[1:28:16] seat
[1:28:21] now to some of you it's not little bitty
[1:28:24] but to me it's a little bitty seat
[1:28:31] sleep
[1:28:34] on a itty bitty teeny weeny little
[1:28:38] mattress
[1:28:44] Council I think I had 15 16 year olds
[1:28:50] that have a lot of spirit
[1:28:52] but they were all good kids only had to
[1:28:54] threaten one or two of them
[1:28:59] I would do it all over again for just
[1:29:02] one of those services
[1:29:07] but I'm saying right now
[1:29:10] I don't have to go that far
[1:29:14] it can happen right here
[1:29:15] right now
[1:29:19] Pentecost is he
[1:29:23] praise the Lord
[1:29:25] it's wonderful
[1:29:27] anybody else
[1:29:31] all good
[1:29:32] all right
[1:29:33] I got two things to share
[1:29:36] if you remember we didn't have a bus
[1:29:39] okay the bus
[1:29:41] line that was going to has taken us for
[1:29:43] years no longer was going to take us so
[1:29:46] we were at the point we did not have a
[1:29:47] bus and I mentioned we need to pray
[1:29:49] about having a bus and the next day
[1:29:51] brother JD had some options
[1:29:53] so thank you for that because I'm not
[1:29:54] sure what we would have done
[1:29:56] about that
[1:29:58] it
[1:30:00] it turned out that the the gut the bus
[1:30:03] was the owner was a Christian and his
[1:30:05] bus drivers were Christians and in the
[1:30:08] first leg of the bus the owner of the
[1:30:09] bus was telling me about the Lord and I
[1:30:11] thought well this is going to be good
[1:30:12] okay so that was that was a huge
[1:30:15] blessing to us to be able to have a bust
[1:30:17] and to have Christian men that were
[1:30:18] taking us
[1:30:20] um myself on the prayer line I uh I
[1:30:23] wanted to go through the prayer line to
[1:30:24] go through quickly so that I could pray
[1:30:26] for kids as they were coming through and
[1:30:28] I put my arm I've been struggling my arm
[1:30:30] for uh since December I had heard it
[1:30:32] doing more than I should and working out
[1:30:35] and for some reason it just took he I
[1:30:37] don't know what happened but both of my
[1:30:38] arms went straight up like almost
[1:30:40] unnaturally straight up like pulled up
[1:30:42] and I came out of that and I feel great
[1:30:44] so that was months and months and months
[1:30:47] so I'm feeling good
[1:30:51] thank God for that and uh and there were
[1:30:54] many uh many children also that maybe
[1:30:57] didn't want to come up tonight that had
[1:31:00] mentioned on the bus how they'd received
[1:31:01] the Holy Ghost that was that was
[1:31:04] tremendous to hear one after another it
[1:31:06] was a multitude of children saying that
[1:31:08] they had received the Holy Ghost and one
[1:31:10] after another after another after
[1:31:11] another because the expectation was so
[1:31:13] strong in their peers when and they
[1:31:16] respond they know how to worship they
[1:31:17] get up and I was as we're sitting in the
[1:31:20] back they had the adults sit in the back
[1:31:21] and we watched the kids and I was like
[1:31:22] oh I know that kid and I know that kid
[1:31:24] and I know that kid it's our kids
[1:31:26] not that others don't have kids that are
[1:31:28] wonderful as well but it was something
[1:31:29] really to watch them and that's the
[1:31:31] privilege and the last thing that I
[1:31:32] thought and it came out during the
[1:31:34] services is to recognize the fact that
[1:31:38] um our children
[1:31:40] are part of the Queen of Heaven
[1:31:43] and that they are the final voice to
[1:31:45] this age and they are maturing that's
[1:31:47] take account of that they are maturing
[1:31:50] fast as the scripture declares that they
[1:31:52] must to get to where they need to be
[1:31:54] that we all can go home God bless you
[1:31:56] all
[1:32:02] thank you
[1:32:09] I wonder
[1:32:11] what the first century Christians
[1:32:15] they had young people too brother John
[1:32:18] imagine how they would gather together
[1:32:21] several share today brother Ken ball on
[1:32:24] different ones it's been around for a
[1:32:26] long long time brother Byron Palmer and
[1:32:28] for the Harvey Lunsford different ones
[1:32:31] that probably never even got to attend a
[1:32:34] youth service
[1:32:36] myself the first youth service I ever
[1:32:39] attended I preached it
[1:32:42] I never had a use later
[1:32:44] never had one never went to a gift Camp
[1:32:47] never had a youth service at all
[1:32:51] but I know that there's one thing I
[1:32:54] think all of us desire for our children
[1:32:57] and that is that they can meet the Lord
[1:32:58] Jesus
[1:33:00] in such a real way that no matter what
[1:33:03] they ever face in life
[1:33:05] they'll be able to face it with him
[1:33:08] let me just say this for those of you
[1:33:10] that God did something for you you know
[1:33:12] already
[1:33:13] Satan will do his best to take it from
[1:33:16] you
[1:33:17] if you stood up and you testified you
[1:33:19] already know he's going to attack you
[1:33:21] but that's all right you just attack him
[1:33:23] back you just stand your ground
[1:33:33] as his brother Ron preached it on
[1:33:34] Saturday night we are warriors
[1:33:37] we are not on a picnic we're here in a
[1:33:40] war and we are going to win this war
[1:33:44] by the grace of God let's bow our heads
[1:33:46] together if you would
[1:33:50] heavenly father thank you for this
[1:33:52] tonight Lord
[1:33:54] mother Rob told me today that several of
[1:33:57] the kids was testifying on the bus
[1:33:58] coming back
[1:34:00] that they'd received the Holy Ghost I
[1:34:02] thought Lord
[1:34:04] what a wonderful thing
[1:34:07] to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:11] the whole trip the whole Camp all the
[1:34:14] preparation
[1:34:16] all the effort that was put forth
[1:34:18] would be worse to do it all for one
[1:34:22] much less for multiple and this is just
[1:34:25] our church tonight so how many have went
[1:34:28] to Arizona and back to Ohio to Indiana
[1:34:31] and all different parts
[1:34:34] and they're sharing what you've done for
[1:34:36] them
[1:34:37] we thank you for it father
[1:34:39] I pray for brother Tim Lord in this
[1:34:41] church I know it's been a big sacrifice
[1:34:44] for them for all these years
[1:34:46] I thank you for putting it on their
[1:34:48] hearts years ago to be able to do this
[1:34:51] I'm sure he didn't have a clue how it
[1:34:54] would be and how that it would touch so
[1:34:56] many kids around the world
[1:34:58] father we're just asking in the name of
[1:35:00] Jesus
[1:35:01] if there's one of ours here that could
[1:35:04] not go
[1:35:05] I know some wanted to and they were sick
[1:35:07] different things happened they couldn't
[1:35:08] go
[1:35:10] but may the same Holy Ghost
[1:35:12] come by this way tonight father
[1:35:16] we don't have to we don't want to have
[1:35:18] to wait till Camp next year we may not
[1:35:20] even be here next year
[1:35:22] but may the spirit of God come by this
[1:35:25] way Lord
[1:35:26] fill every Hungry Heart to this place
[1:35:29] we know Lord It's not that we have to be
[1:35:32] in Louisiana we don't have to be in
[1:35:33] Washington DC here we don't have to be
[1:35:35] in Jeffersonville
[1:35:36] the thing of it is our hearts have to be
[1:35:39] in the right position
[1:35:41] Lord Jesus I send you heal so many that
[1:35:45] are Saturday night your presence so
[1:35:47] wonderful
[1:35:49] but we got sick for cure tonight
[1:35:51] I pray Lord God In The Name of Jesus
[1:35:54] while we're praying May the angels of
[1:35:56] the Lord go amongst your children right
[1:35:59] now
[1:36:00] you delivered those of discouragement
[1:36:02] sadness and depression well there's
[1:36:05] people here tonight that may be feeling
[1:36:07] the same way but we believe you're the
[1:36:10] same yesterday today and forever
[1:36:13] we love you father we bring our needs
[1:36:16] before you now God
[1:36:18] and we ask you that you would help us
[1:36:20] Lord
[1:36:21] can we stand our feet
[1:36:25] and he has a need and you're allowed to
[1:36:27] be remembered tonight before the Lord
[1:36:28] God bless you yes
[1:36:31] thank you so much for praying for Erica
[1:36:33] we're so appreciated I'm sure most of
[1:36:34] you know that she contacted shingles
[1:36:36] this past week everything else she was
[1:36:39] dealing with she sure didn't need that
[1:36:40] but the Lord's been merciful to her and
[1:36:42] helped her and she's feeling better
[1:36:44] today and we're sorry to thank you for
[1:36:45] praying for her but she still needs a
[1:36:47] touch from the Lord she still hasn't got
[1:36:49] her appetite back she's down to about
[1:36:51] 101 pounds something like that and
[1:36:54] certainly needs to to be able to get
[1:36:56] that back and he believes with us that
[1:36:58] God's going to take care of that how
[1:37:00] many of you have a need in your body
[1:37:02] your home your life whatever it is
[1:37:04] would you just lay your hand on that
[1:37:06] person standing by you

[1:37:11] and brother John testify of some of the
[1:37:14] things that they did

[1:37:18] some of the ones they witnessed to and
[1:37:20] we out and already know what our God can
