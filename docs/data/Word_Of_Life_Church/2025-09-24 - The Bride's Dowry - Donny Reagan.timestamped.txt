[2:50] How you care
[2:53] For your preious
[2:56] blood, I felt pardoned.
[3:01] And my sins
[3:03] are washed.
[3:05] They're all washed away. All my sins
[3:11] are washed
[3:13] away. Singing out. Oh, I'm amazed
[3:20] that you love me.
[3:24] I'm amazed

[3:39] And my sins
[3:42] they're washed. They're all washed away.

[3:54] [Music]
[3:55] No one knew how long I was feeling.
[4:03] And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[4:08] hide.
[4:10] Though I laugh and said my life was fine
[4:15] without you.
[4:18] I was covering up the secret tears I
[4:24] cried. Thank you, Lord. Then one day,
[4:27] thank you, Lord. Someone told me of your
[4:31] mercy.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; And the love you showed on a hill called
[4:38] Calary.
[4:40] Glory. There you die
[4:44] and purchase my salvation
[4:49] when your spirit
[4:53] made me free.
[4:55] Oh, I'm amazed
[5:01] that you love me. That you love me. I'm
[5:04] so amazed
[5:06] [Applause]
[5:08] how much you really care.
[5:13] preious
[5:14] blood.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad about it tonight,
[5:19] church?
[5:20] &gt;&gt; And my sins,
[5:21] &gt;&gt; my sins, they're washed.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; They're washed. All washed away.
[5:27] All my sins
[5:30] are washed
[5:32] away. Sing that chorus again. I'm amazed
[5:37] I'm amazed
[5:39] how you love me that you love me. I'm so
[5:43] amazed
[5:47] that you came
[5:50] through your preious
[5:53] blood I found.
[5:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, and my sins,
[6:00] &gt;&gt; they're washed.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; They're washed. They're all washed away.
[6:05] All my sins
[6:08] are washed
[6:10] away.
[6:14] Oh, somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[6:17] Give him a good hand clap of praise
[6:19] tonight if you love him.
[6:22] Amen. Ain't it good to be back in the
[6:24] house of God? Praise the Lord. So glad
[6:26] you're here tonight. If we have any
[6:28] visitors with us, we want to welcome you
[6:30] to the service. trust you'll just
[6:32] receive a real good blessing here
[6:34] tonight being with us and also all of
[6:36] our streamers locally and around the
[6:37] world. We want to say that we welcome
[6:39] them to this service. Could we give all
[6:41] those folks a good hand tonight if you
[6:43] will.
[6:44] Praise the Lord. We want to look at her
[6:48] our prayer requests tonight. Sister Judy
[6:50] Davis asking for prayer. Abdominal
[6:53] abdominal pain uh very severe. She's
[6:56] just asking that we would remember her
[6:58] as we pray tonight. Brother Kirk Sacker
[7:00] says to please pray for a neighbor of
[7:02] ours who is suffering from head to toe
[7:05] with severe pain. Area physicians cannot
[7:08] find the cause. They sent him to
[7:10] Vanderbilt for further tests last
[7:12] Friday. He is waiting for the results
[7:14] from those tests. So they're asking that
[7:16] we would remember that prayer request
[7:18] tonight. Then we have a testimony from
[7:20] Sister Wanda Bman. Says, "In April of
[7:22] this year, I had gone to the eye doctor
[7:24] to get new glasses. During the visit, I
[7:26] was told that I had cataracts. The
[7:29] doctor said to come back in one year and
[7:31] discuss surgery to remove them. In
[7:34] August, my vision changed again and the
[7:36] eye doctor referred me to a eye clinic
[7:38] for cataract surgery. This past
[7:40] Wednesday night, I went up for prayer to
[7:42] ask the Lord to remove the cataracts. On
[7:45] Thursday morning, I woke up and the
[7:47] cataracts were gone. All praise and
[7:49] honor to the Lord Jesus for his grace
[7:51] and mercy. Amen. Praise the Lord. You
[7:56] had a good testimony tonight. Amen.
[7:58] Urgent prayer requests for Sister Mary
[8:00] Beth Holloway. The Lord knows all about
[8:03] that need. We just committed unto the
[8:04] Lord. Sister Janet Paynees asking that
[8:06] we would uh pray for two of her
[8:09] grandsons who lost their coworker to
[8:12] suicide and the family uh has really
[8:15] been hit hard and pray for all that's
[8:18] concerned in that. So, we want to
[8:19] remember that prayer request tonight
[8:21] that the Lord would be mindful. Brother
[8:23] Greg Robbins is going to have surgery to
[8:25] remove his eye on Friday. He's been in a
[8:28] lot of pain due to his eye. Please pray
[8:30] that everything goes well. Please
[8:32] remember Sister Shirley in prayer as
[8:34] well. So, we certainly want to pray for
[8:36] those folks tonight. Brother Smith and
[8:38] Sister Diana Ward are not feeling well,
[8:40] unable to be in service. I want to pray
[8:42] for them tonight. Brother Tyler and
[8:44] Sister Caitlyn Gagnan uh sent in a
[8:47] prayer request. She's having some
[8:49] difficulty with her pregnancy and
[8:50] they're just asking without going into a
[8:52] lot of detail, they're just asking that
[8:54] God would be mindful and let everything
[8:56] work out to her good. So, we just commit
[8:58] all that unto the Lord tonight. He's
[9:00] more than able to meet every need among
[9:03] us. Do you believe that tonight with all
[9:05] your heart? And then brother Bisc
[9:08] will be on this coming Sunday. I don't
[9:10] know exact the hour or the time or
[9:12] anything like that, but I I do know that
[9:14] it will be Sunday. So, we certainly want
[9:16] to pray for that family, that church
[9:18] family, that the Lord would just be
[9:20] mindful of all of those folks. And uh,
[9:23] Brother Bisco was a was a great hero of
[9:25] the faith. I believe that with all of my
[9:27] heart. So, we want to just remember all
[9:29] those folks in prayer. Uh, brother
[9:31] Michael says, "If you want to help with
[9:32] the fall festival, signup sheets are in
[9:35] the library." So, remember that. And
[9:37] personal and business changes to the
[9:39] directory will be accepted in the
[9:41] library until Wednesday, October the
[9:44] 15th. So remember that all those
[9:46] announcements tonight. You have an
[9:47] unspoken prayer request tonight you'd
[9:49] like for this group to pray about. Could
[9:51] we stand to our feet? Let's sing that
[9:53] again. The course of that. I'm amazed
[9:56] that you love me. Are you amazed his
[9:58] love for you tonight? Somebody say it's
[10:00] the truth. Anyway, give him one more
[10:03] good hand clap of praise tonight if you
[10:04] love me with all your heart.
[10:08] I'm amazed
[10:11] that you love me.
[10:15] I'm so amazed
[10:19] how you care.
[10:23] Your precious
[10:26] blood I found pardon me. And my sins,
[10:33] &gt;&gt; they're washed.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; They're washed. They're all washed away.
[10:38] All my sins
[10:41] are washed
[10:43] away. One more time with all your heart.
[10:46] I'm amazed
[10:50] that you love me. That you love me. I'm
[10:53] so amazed.
[10:58] how you came
[11:01] through your precious
[11:04] blood.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; Pardon.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, and my sins.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; They're washed.
[11:13] They're all washed away. All my sins.
[11:20] They're washed away.
[11:25] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Brother
[11:28] Fred, come tonight if you would pray
[11:29] over these deeds. We'll just commit all
[11:31] these things unto the Lord. Sure.
[11:33] Appreciate Brother Fred Perry, don't we?
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Good brother. Amen. Dave. Amen.
[11:39] Appreciate you.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; It's so wonderful to be in the house of
[11:44] the Lord. No greater place to be than
[11:47] right here at this time. We could have
[11:50] been anywhere, but the Lord chose us and
[11:53] destinated us to be right here. So let's
[11:56] bow our heads and go to him in prayer.
[11:59] Our gracious heavenly father, we once
[12:02] again we've been given the opportunity
[12:05] to come and sit in the house of God.
[12:10] Oh, it thrills my heart, Lord, to just
[12:13] to be able to say that I could come and
[12:15] sit in the house of God in this day and
[12:18] the hour that we live when such things
[12:21] going on around the world. We can say
[12:24] that we have a king that knelt before a
[12:28] cross in humility,
[12:32] but the father lifted him up in honor.
[12:35] And Lord, we want to do that tonight. We
[12:38] want to lift our hearts to you. Oh, that
[12:41] you could cleanse us, Lord, and help us,
[12:44] Lord, in these times that we have, Lord,
[12:47] our sicknesses and and pains and uh just
[12:50] the way human life is, Lord.
[12:54] But we know we are inheritors of
[12:57] miracles. We've heard one tonight, Lord.
[13:01] And we are inheritors of faith. We are
[13:04] the inheritors of all things only
[13:07] because you went down in humility and
[13:12] raised in honor. And we give you the
[13:15] glory and the power, Lord. We give you
[13:18] our lives, Lord. All things belong to
[13:21] you. And we're not here to fight for
[13:24] anything else. But what we want to fight
[13:26] for, Lord, is our surrender. That we
[13:29] could surrender our hearts and surrender
[13:31] our lives totally for you, Lord. Now,
[13:36] bless the service tonight, Lord. Bless
[13:39] the man of God as he comes. Let wisdom
[13:42] flow from his lips, Lord, that feeds our
[13:45] hearts, Lord, and gives us that
[13:47] uplifting power, Lord, that we need.
[13:50] fill us tonight, Lord. Whatever need we
[13:53] have, Lord, we know that we could come
[13:55] before you and you would answer those
[13:58] things, Lord. We have faith in you,
[14:00] Lord. Now, bless us, Lord, and help us,
[14:03] Lord, as we honor you tonight, Lord,
[14:05] with singing and praise. And let our
[14:07] lips be full of worship and the fruits
[14:11] of our lips be honored before you, Lord.
[14:14] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[14:21] Amen. Amen. Ushers, if you want to come
[14:24] tonight, receive the evening offering,
[14:25] you give us unto the Lord. Once again,
[14:27] if you're a vist, God bless you. Now,
[14:30] what if you knew that tonight was your
[14:31] last night that you ever get to be in
[14:33] church and you'd ever get this
[14:35] opportunity to worship?
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Would you make it a good one?
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Well, how do you know it ain't?
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Let's sing with everything we got
[14:44] tonight. We want to worship the Lord in
[14:46] spirit and in truth, right? Somebody
[14:48] say, "Praise the Lord." Give him one
[14:50] more good hand clap of praise tonight.

[28:36] Here's
[28:51] another song that uh Sister Betty wrote
[28:54] a long time ago. It seemed like the only
[28:56] people that request us to sing is other
[28:59] old people.
[29:02] I just don't get that. But
[29:05] that's the way it is.
[29:07] As long as you old people want to hear
[29:09] us sing, I guess we'll try to sing for
[29:11] you. Hope this song will bless you. It
[29:13] says, "I'll soon be gone." Amen.
[29:17] [Music]
[29:23] When the darkness of this life is filled
[29:28] with sadness
[29:31] and our hearts are often troubled deep
[29:36] within.
[29:39] I stop and think of how our God looked
[29:44] down upon us.
[29:48] And by faith, he's lifted up where I can
[29:53] see.
[29:55] I'll soon be
[29:57] &gt;&gt; I'll soon be gone. It won't be long
[30:04] till I fly till I home in the sky.
[30:11] There'll be no fears.
[30:15] He'll dry my tears.
[30:20] One of these days with faith so strong,
[30:24] I'll soon be.
[30:30] [Music]
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; I know the light of his presence is now
[30:41] with us.
[30:44] I have seen the amber light so bright
[30:49] and strong.
[30:52] It's brightest ray out shines the light
[30:56] of morning sunshine.
[31:00] I know is God assuring me I'll soon be
[31:06] gone.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; I'll soon
[31:10] I'll soon be gone. It won't be long
[31:17] till I fly to my home in the sky.
[31:24] There will be no fear.
[31:29] He'll dry my tears.
[31:33] One of these days with faith so strong,
[31:37] I'll soon be gone.
[31:41] One of these days with faith so strong
[31:45] I'll soon be gone.
[31:53] [Applause]
[32:16] I love to hear them sing.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; It's awesome to, you know, I grew up in
[32:20] Kentucky, a little bitty single wide
[32:23] trailer church, and I heard all these
[32:24] songs.
[32:26] Sister Geraldine,
[32:28] Sister Jackie, or Sister Betty. And you
[32:32] know, you you you hear the songs, but
[32:35] when you get to meet the person, you
[32:38] really see the life that made that song.
[32:40] It's just it's it's incredible. I love
[32:43] it.
[32:45] I pray this is a blessing.
[32:51] [Music]
[33:05] It's easy to bless you
[33:10] when the valleyies behind me.
[33:17] It's easy to trust you
[33:21] when my world is not unwinding.
[33:27] But this is the darkest midnight
[33:31] that I have ever seen.
[33:35] So I will stand my ground, lift my hands
[33:39] to you and sing.
[33:44] Before the prayer is answered.
[33:48] Before the battle's won.
[33:52] Before this trial is over.
[33:56] Before the healing comes.
[34:00] I will choose to trust you.
[34:04] I will bless you, Lord. I won't wait to
[34:08] praise you after.
[34:11] I will praise
[34:14] you
[34:15] before
[34:22] in the lonely days of silence.
[34:26] [Music]
[34:29] When the waiting gets old,
[34:33] [Music]
[34:34] I've found a flame of worship.
[34:38] [Music]
[34:40] Keeps my heart from growing cold.
[34:46] You've always been so faithful
[34:50] when I can't do my part.
[34:54] Even in my worn out weakness,
[34:57] nothing changes who you are.
[35:02] Before the prayer is answered,
[35:06] before the battle's won,
[35:09] before this trial is over,
[35:13] before the healing comes,
[35:17] I will choose to trust you.
[35:21] I will bless you, Lord. Lord, I won't
[35:25] wait to praise you after.
[35:28] I will praise
[35:31] you
[35:32] before you ever for me. You knew I'd be
[35:37] here on my knees.
[35:40] You're the one who's fighting for me.
[35:44] And you know where this will lead.
[35:52] Before the prayer is answered,
[35:56] before the battle's won,
[36:00] before this trial is over,
[36:04] before the healing comes,
[36:08] I will choose to trust you.
[36:12] I will bless you Lord. I will praise you
[36:17] after.
[36:19] I will praise
[36:21] you
[36:23] before.
[36:24] [Music]
[36:30] No, I won't wait to praise you after.
[36:34] I will praise
[36:37] you before.
[36:41] [Music]
[36:46] [Applause]
[36:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of praise we want to
[36:57] have, isn't it?
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Not just wait till the prayer is even
[37:00] answered, but give him praise before it
[37:02] ever gets answered.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read tonight Genesis 24
[37:07] verse 58. Trust everybody's doing well.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Fighting the devil.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Winning.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; Not near as many of you winning. Are you
[37:16] winning?
[37:18] &gt;&gt; All right. Praise the Lord. That's what
[37:19] we want to hear. Let's read together.
[37:22] And they called Rebecca and said unto
[37:24] her, "Will thou go with this man?" And
[37:27] she said, "I will go." And they sent
[37:30] away Rebecca, their sister, and her
[37:33] nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his
[37:37] men. Won't you notice the order?
[37:40] Who came first?
[37:43] [Music]
[37:45] &gt;&gt; What?
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Rebecca. Ah. And they sent away Rebecca,
[37:51] their sister, and her nurse, and
[37:54] Abraham's servant, and his men.
[37:58] So you see the going away
[38:00] is not brother Brandham going to have a
[38:02] private resurrection
[38:05] and then brother Brandham's going to
[38:06] raise all the dead and we're going to
[38:08] have a tent meeting
[38:10] &gt;&gt; and people's going to get the Holy Ghost
[38:12] and
[38:14] &gt;&gt; that's contrary to the word.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Who is the final voice of the final age?
[38:20] &gt;&gt; The bride is.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that what he said?
[38:24] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. And they blessed
[38:26] Rebecca and said unto her, "Thou art our
[38:29] sister. Be thou the mother of thousands
[38:33] of millions,
[38:35] and let thy seed possess the gate of
[38:38] those which hate them." And Rebecca
[38:40] arose and her damsels, and they rode
[38:42] upon the camels, and followed the man.
[38:45] And the servant took Rebecca, and went
[38:49] his way. I want to speak to you tonight
[38:53] on the bride's
[38:55] dowy. How many like to be remembered as
[38:57] we go before the Lord? Aren't you glad
[39:00] that our God,
[39:04] if there would be millions of people
[39:06] praying at this very instant,
[39:11] some need healing, some need financial
[39:13] blessing, some need a job, some need
[39:15] this, this, this. He could hear all of
[39:18] them at one time.
[39:21] and be sure and get your name on your
[39:24] package
[39:26] and then your neighbor wouldn't have to
[39:27] bring you a package because they
[39:29] delivered your package at their door and
[39:30] you got their package.
[39:32] But our God is so mighty and so
[39:34] wonderful that he can hear all of that
[39:37] at once and send each answer right
[39:40] directly on time to the right
[39:43] individual.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together.
[39:48] Father, we so so love you tonight. We're
[39:51] just so thankful for everything that you
[39:54] mean to us, Lord. Oh God, as we gather
[39:57] here, Lord, it's not to magnify man,
[40:01] magnify a system, magnify some
[40:05] brotherhood, but we are here to worship
[40:08] and magnify you, Father. And we realize
[40:12] the more that we learn to do that, the
[40:14] more you will pull us into yourself. I
[40:17] find it to be phenomenal that the more
[40:20] we give to you, the more of yourself you
[40:23] give to us. I'm so grateful for that.
[40:26] It's no wonder to me that Satan has so
[40:29] many of the preachers out in religious
[40:33] worlds today just focusing constantly on
[40:35] the people, the people, the people, the
[40:37] people, the people. Because the devil
[40:40] knows if they ever magnify you and ever
[40:43] see who you are, what a thing it does.
[40:47] So I pray we would not be guilty of
[40:49] that. Lord, open our eyes tonight. That
[40:51] we can see you and the magnitude of your
[40:55] love by the gifts and the great
[40:58] treasures that you bestow upon your
[41:00] people. You saw all the hands are
[41:02] uplifted. We're just asking you that
[41:05] you'd be mindful of us tonight, Father,
[41:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus. And the
[41:09] saints said,
[41:10] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[41:11] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated.
[41:14] The word
[41:17] sill you him.
[41:20] Sill you him.
[41:23] That's a Hebrew word for dowry. For us
[41:27] as westerners, the dowy doesn't really
[41:30] mean much of anything. But let me read
[41:32] it to you so you'll understand it. The
[41:34] dowy was given to the bride by her
[41:38] father to equip her for her new life.
[41:44] It's also part of her inheritance. Let
[41:48] me read it to you again. Given to the
[41:50] bride by her father to equip her for her
[41:54] new life, part of her inheritance. Now
[42:00] the dowy, the Bible here in Genesis of
[42:04] course doesn't mention it, but Rebecca
[42:06] actually would have been given a dowy
[42:09] not from Abraham, not from Isaac, but
[42:13] from her paternal and maternal parents,
[42:16] of course. And it would have included
[42:19] part of the fortune as far as what they
[42:22] had. It may have included things old and
[42:26] things new. Things that were more of a
[42:30] family inheritance, things that would
[42:33] have been a treasure to them and them
[42:35] only. Other people would look at and
[42:37] say, "I wouldn't have that piece of
[42:38] junk. I don't know what that even is."
[42:40] But to that family, it would have been
[42:43] something very special. Now, she's going
[42:46] to leave with this man and depart. Never
[42:49] come back. Actually, never see them
[42:50] again. And yet they want to give her
[42:53] something from her parents that will be
[42:57] able to identify her in that lineage
[43:00] even though she will be so very far
[43:04] away. So the dowy was very very
[43:06] important. Now it's not just something
[43:08] in the past for some some marriages and
[43:10] some cultures and so on. They still do
[43:12] the same thing today. So they would give
[43:15] that then to the daughter because the
[43:17] daughter did not receive a divided
[43:20] portion of the inheritance when it come
[43:22] to land, cattle, sheep, oxen and so on.
[43:24] It was divided among the sons. And you
[43:26] remember one of the men in the Old
[43:28] Testament whenever Moses was there that
[43:30] they had to have a special hearing
[43:32] because the man had no sons. And then
[43:35] they went to God and God said, "Well,
[43:36] because there is no sons, let the
[43:38] daughters have a part of it." But that
[43:40] was not the norm. The norm was that the
[43:43] sons would get it and the eldest son
[43:45] would get a double portion. So if you
[43:47] had seven sons, the inheritance was
[43:50] divided by eight, which meant the eldest
[43:53] son got two parts. But here now the dowy
[43:57] was something totally for the female
[44:01] only. No bridegroom got a dowy. That was
[44:05] not his. It was for the bride only. You
[44:09] know, as I begin to look at this, I've
[44:11] realized that the bride of Christ also
[44:15] has a dowy, something given to her from
[44:20] who? Not from her husband, but from her
[44:24] father. Now, we're in a very strange
[44:27] relationship as far as when it comes to
[44:30] our relation to deity. Now, let me
[44:33] explain it to you this way. Actually,
[44:36] our father had a son. Now that son was
[44:40] only a human embodiment or a human
[44:44] tabernacle by which the father could get
[44:48] into and create a blood and shed that
[44:52] blood so that he could redeem his
[44:54] people. Now that father is that great
[44:57] being of course that is light and his
[45:00] spirit and he was not a man but he gave
[45:03] to the world. He gave also to us of
[45:06] course his only begotten son. Now
[45:09] remember only begotten at that time. So
[45:12] he was the only begotten son at that
[45:15] time. And what was that? It was a human
[45:18] temple by which the father could dwell
[45:22] in in order to redeem and pay the price
[45:26] to bring us back. So here he plays two
[45:29] parts. So spirit God is our father and
[45:34] then the father himself gives birth to a
[45:38] son when before the foundation of the
[45:40] world but at that time he wasn't even a
[45:43] human he was the logos. So then he
[45:46] condescends from being the logos to
[45:50] becoming a human being. Now but we still
[45:53] have this wonderful relationship with
[45:56] spirit God which is our father. Now
[45:59] remember the body the human body of the
[46:01] Lord Jesus is not your father.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; The human body of the Lord Jesus is not
[46:08] your father. As a matter of fact he
[46:10] wasn't his own father. The human body
[46:13] was a body of time that God created and
[46:17] it was his own body and he called it
[46:21] sunship. Now watch in though believers
[46:24] then are given gifts by the father to
[46:28] equip them for their new life and for
[46:32] their journey as they're heading to be
[46:35] able to meet their bridegroom. Read with
[46:37] me in Matthew 7 11. If ye then being
[46:42] evil know how to give good gifts unto
[46:45] your children, how much more shall your
[46:48] father, now notice the position from
[46:51] which these gifts are coming from? They
[46:54] say, "What difference does it make?" Oh,
[46:55] it makes all the difference in the
[46:57] world. You see, or if you were here and
[46:59] you were a gentile and you would have
[47:02] called out, "Son of David, son of David,
[47:05] have mercy on me." You know what? you
[47:07] would have got absolutely nothing
[47:10] &gt;&gt; because you were claiming the wrong
[47:12] dispensational title.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; So you could only get from God and
[47:18] remember the word interpreted is the
[47:21] manifestation of the name of God. So
[47:24] that's why they can scream the name of
[47:26] Jesus in the day we're living in and
[47:29] hardly get nothing out of it. But it
[47:31] will be revealed in what he said the
[47:35] thunders. So when the voice of God makes
[47:37] his message known in every day, it will
[47:40] be the word interpreted for the age that
[47:43] the elect of God live in, they will be
[47:46] caught by that word. The others will
[47:48] pass right on by, join church, join
[47:51] religion, become religious, all that
[47:53] sort of thing, and miss it a million
[47:55] miles. But we don't want to do that, do
[47:57] we?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Now notice then where the source of
[48:00] these great gifts come from. How much
[48:02] more shall your father which is in
[48:05] heaven give good things to them that ask
[48:09] him? How many like to know tonight what
[48:11] your dowy a little bit of it includes?
[48:13] Well, if it's yours, wouldn't you want
[48:15] to know your sisters whenever you got
[48:17] married? Now, if your father would have
[48:18] said, "Now, honey, whenever you get
[48:20] married, daddy's got something for you."
[48:22] I'll tell you what, daddy is going to
[48:24] give you a a surprise. It's going to be
[48:27] a gift. And your daddy was a wealthy man
[48:29] and you know, a man that was equipped to
[48:31] do it. And you'd be anxious, of course,
[48:33] thinking, "Oh my, what's daddy going to
[48:35] give me? Is he going to give us a house?
[48:36] Is he going to give us $1,000, $10,000?
[48:39] What's dad going to give you?" Well, let
[48:41] me just share with you tonight what our
[48:42] heavenly father has already given to us.
[48:45] It ain't going to be $1,000. It ain't
[48:47] going to be $10,000. As a matter of
[48:49] fact, it will be riches that you can't
[48:51] even think about without God helping you
[48:54] to do it. There will be so much of it
[48:57] that God will give to us just in this
[49:00] life. If this life contains so many
[49:03] beneficial blessings and great things of
[49:06] what he wants us to do, I cannot imagine
[49:09] what the world that is to come is going
[49:11] to be like. Now, let's look at and we'll
[49:14] start from the basic foundation of where
[49:16] we come to him. And let's look at being
[49:19] forgiven. Oh, aren't you glad you're
[49:21] forgiven tonight? Romans 4:7 saying,
[49:24] "Blessed are they whose iniquities are
[49:28] forgiven, whose sins are covered, whose
[49:33] iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are
[49:37] covered." Now, think of that old life
[49:40] that you used to live. Now, the downside
[49:42] is that us of human beings that we can
[49:45] still remember the wrongs that we've
[49:46] done. We can remember how bad they were,
[49:49] how terrible they were, how awful we
[49:51] felt when we done them. But there's one
[49:53] great thing I know. Our God remembers
[49:55] none of them against us. Thank God.
[49:58] Ephesians 4:32.
[50:01] And be ye kind one to another,
[50:04] tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
[50:06] even as God for Christ sake hath
[50:11] forgiven you. Now, this is why we are
[50:14] forgiven. It's not because we deserve
[50:17] it. It's not because we held our hands a
[50:20] certain way or we said certain words
[50:22] when we pray. God forgave you for
[50:25] Christ's sake.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; And the church said
[50:29] &gt;&gt; as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
[50:32] you. Colossians 2:13. And you being dead
[50:36] in your sins and the uncircumcision of
[50:39] your hearts, has he quickened together
[50:43] not apart from him, but with him? Has he
[50:47] quickened together with him? You mean to
[50:50] tell me that I was already quickened
[50:54] before I was ever even born?
[50:57] You was already identified in the
[51:00] quickening power of God before you ever
[51:03] draw one breast in your human body. How
[51:07] can that be? What if Adam lost my
[51:10] inheritance before I was born? The
[51:12] second Adam regained my inheritance
[51:14] before I was born. Come on, somebody.
[51:18] Now, you realize it's the work of God
[51:20] and the grace of God that's done it. And
[51:23] you being dead in your sins and the
[51:25] uncircumcision of your flesh, has he
[51:28] quickened together with him, having
[51:30] forgiven you all, oh, praise God, all
[51:35] trespasses.
[51:37] Colossians 2:14, blotting out the
[51:41] handwriting
[51:43] of ordinances that was against us. Now,
[51:47] I want you to listen to this. I was so
[51:49] curious about these words. So, I've done
[51:51] a little research and got to looking at
[51:52] it and I found the meanings of this
[51:54] verse. I thought it's so awesome. I
[51:56] wanted to share it with you. The
[51:57] burdens, some requirements of the law
[52:00] have been abolished. And of course, it's
[52:03] superseded by the death of our Lord
[52:06] Jesus. But what it leads up to is the
[52:09] word handwriting signifies an
[52:12] acknowledgment signed by us that we owe
[52:17] a certain amount. Now the handwriting
[52:21] that was against us, we actually had to
[52:25] acknowledge it ourself. So here was all
[52:29] this debt. Here was all this that we've
[52:31] done and we had to acknowledge it and we
[52:35] had to take our own handwriting as it
[52:37] were and acknowledge I am guilty of this
[52:41] and this and this and this and this and
[52:44] God in that sense made us acknowledge
[52:46] it. You say, "When, Brother Donnie, when
[52:48] did that happen?" When you come to an
[52:50] altar and you begin to acknowledge,
[52:53] "Lord God, I'm a low down rotten sinner.
[52:56] I've drunk. I've lied. I've stole. I've
[52:58] cheated. I've done this. Don't you
[53:00] understand what you was doing?" Your own
[53:03] personal handwriting will say, "I'm a
[53:05] sinner. I'm no good. I'm no count. If
[53:07] God don't help me, there ain't no hope
[53:09] for me." And God said, "All right, now
[53:11] that you've signed it and you admit the
[53:14] bill is too large for you, this is what
[53:17] I am going to do for you in exchange."
[53:20] Blotting out the handwriting of
[53:23] ordinances that was against us, which
[53:27] was contrary to us, and took it out of
[53:32] the way, nailing it to the cross. So he
[53:37] took all that we did by our personal
[53:40] acknowledgment and he took it from us
[53:44] and he took that oh glory to God that
[53:48] agreement that we said yep I deserve it
[53:50] I ain't no good I ain't worth even
[53:53] living oh my and he said I'll tell you
[53:55] what I'm going to do now I'm going to
[53:57] take that and I'm going to nail it to
[54:00] the cross what a peculiar way to say
[54:03] that remember it was the Lord for Jesus
[54:06] who was nailed to the cross and yet your
[54:10] sins being identified as being lost and
[54:13] wretched and he took that and nailed it
[54:16] to the cross. Why? Paul says in 2
[54:19] Corinthians 5, he who knew no sin became
[54:23] sin that we might become the very
[54:26] righteousness of God in him. Listen
[54:28] little bride, this is part of your
[54:31] gallery. This is something that even
[54:34] after you get saved, it gives you hope
[54:37] because guess what? You're still going
[54:38] to fall flat on your face. You're still
[54:40] going to make mistakes. You're still
[54:42] going to mess up.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; But can't that same God who buried, oh,
[54:47] hallelujah, that died and buried and
[54:50] rose again? Cannot that same God that
[54:53] took that handwriting that was against
[54:55] you forgive you now to your sons and
[54:58] daughters of God?
[55:01] Oh, praise be to God. So, here is this
[55:04] massive sum on the bill that I owed all
[55:08] of this debt. My body, my soul, my
[55:11] temperament, my character, everything
[55:12] that I was was absolutely obligated to
[55:16] that. So, it brought me under the state
[55:18] of condemnation. The only thing he
[55:20] wanted me to do was acknowledge it. Just
[55:22] acknowledge it that you're lost, that
[55:25] you're wretched, that you cannot do it
[55:27] without me. And I will take it for you.
[55:30] I become that for you. But it will not
[55:33] do you any good until you acknowledge
[55:36] that you need a savior. Oh, no matter
[55:38] how great he is, how wonderful he is, he
[55:41] can only save you if you'll let him. He
[55:44] can only heal you tonight if you'll let
[55:46] him. He can only encourage you tonight.
[55:49] I wish somebody would preach with me. He
[55:51] can only encourage you. He can only lift
[55:54] you up. He can only be your peace, your
[55:57] joy, your satisfaction if you'll receive
[56:00] it from him. But if you won't let him,
[56:02] he can't do it. All of heaven,
[56:04] hallelujah, is at your disposal there.
[56:07] If you'll call upon his name and say,
[56:09] "Lord, I am a member of your bride. It's
[56:13] part of my dowy." A dowry is not for you
[56:16] in the millennium. It's not for you at
[56:18] the marriage supper of the lamb. It's
[56:20] given to you for your journey from here
[56:23] to there.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Having spoiled principalities
[56:34] and powers. Oh, I love this. He made a
[56:37] show of them openly triumphing over them
[56:43] in it. Triumphing over them in it. Right
[56:48] in the middle of it. He triumphed over
[56:50] hell. 1 John 2:12, I wrote unto you,
[56:54] little children, because your sins are
[56:59] forgiven you for his name's sake. Do you
[57:04] understand that? It brings glory to his
[57:07] name for every sinner that will accept
[57:10] him as their savior. Praise the Lord.
[57:14] Now, remember, of course, friends, that
[57:15] many folks will be saved that will not
[57:18] be bribed. Oh, of course there will.
[57:19] There'll be all kinds of people that'll
[57:21] be saved because they're trusting Jesus
[57:23] as their savior. I don't want him just
[57:25] to be my savior. I want him to be my
[57:28] Lord.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people, oh yes, oh Lord,
[57:31] please save me. Save me from hell. But
[57:33] Lord, don't you tell me what I can live
[57:35] now. Don't you tell me what I can wear
[57:37] and I can't wear and I can't go here and
[57:38] I can't go there and now. Lord, don't
[57:40] tell me that. Well, you say they want
[57:42] him as savior, but they don't want him
[57:44] as Lord, but the bride wants him as
[57:46] Lord. I said the bride wants him as her
[57:49] Lord.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Notice another gift now that the
[57:54] father wanted to impart to his children
[57:58] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh
[58:01] my, how we appreciate the baptism of the
[58:03] Holy Ghost. Now, I'm not talking about
[58:05] being baptized in your spirit, but I'm
[58:08] talking about your soul becoming
[58:10] illuminated by the very breath of God.
[58:13] The same breath of God that breathed
[58:14] into Adam was the very same breath of
[58:16] God that told the disciples and St. John
[58:19] receive ye the Holy Ghost and he
[58:21] breathed on them and a few days later
[58:24] the breast come into the upper room.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; So it was a delayed reaction but they
[58:29] caught up with it. Now the same Lord
[58:32] Jesus notice what he says in St. John
[58:35] 14:16. I will pray the father. I here's
[58:40] our Isaac now. I will pray to the
[58:43] father. Abraham in the type. I will pray
[58:46] to the father and he will give you
[58:49] another comforter that he may abide with
[58:52] you forever. Now remember the disciples
[58:55] were hearing some of these things for
[58:56] their first time. And they were hearing
[58:58] talking about leaving and going away.
[59:00] I'm not sure they didn't want him to go
[59:02] away. But Jesus tells them here in St.
[59:04] John 14, it is expedient for you that I
[59:08] go away because if I don't go away, the
[59:11] comforter cannot come. What is it
[59:13] another person of the Godhead? No, it's
[59:16] actually the same person of the Godhead
[59:18] but in a different manifestation. One
[59:20] that the church could receive. We could
[59:23] not receive the corporal body of Jesus
[59:25] in our body.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Well, if I got the corporal body of
[59:28] Jesus in my body, then none the rest you
[59:30] ain't got the Holy Ghost. or if you got
[59:32] it, I ain't got the Holy Ghost. But
[59:34] what's he going to do? Change himself.
[59:37] Now God is a spirit and God gave birth
[59:40] to a spirit son, which is the baptism of
[59:44] the Holy Ghost. Now notice Jesus saying
[59:46] that I will pray the father and the
[59:49] father will give you a comforter. Notice
[59:52] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[59:56] cannot receive. So a person that comes
[59:58] up to receive salvation, they cannot
[1:00:01] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; According to Jesus,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; I guess he knew more about it than
[1:00:07] preachers. What do you think?
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; The world cannot receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:00:12] but the world can receive salvation.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; But not the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is for a vessel that has
[1:00:22] come through a process. A sinner comes
[1:00:26] straight from the world. They come to
[1:00:28] the Lord Jesus, receive him as their
[1:00:30] savior. The process starts and many of
[1:00:33] them never go any further than being
[1:00:36] saved.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. So, the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:41] not just for saved people. It's for
[1:00:45] people who are saved and sanctified
[1:00:49] and they're cleansed and they're ready
[1:00:51] to receive a filling on the inside. So
[1:00:55] God don't bring a sinner up to the altar
[1:00:57] and that sinner smoking, drinking,
[1:00:59] lying, committing adultery, got all them
[1:01:02] demons inside their body and God filled
[1:01:04] that person with the Holy Ghost. Are you
[1:01:06] kidding me? God sharing that soul with
[1:01:09] demons.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; No way. So that person has to go through
[1:01:14] a purging, a cleansing, a sanctification
[1:01:18] process to receive the Holy Ghost. And
[1:01:21] who's Jesus speaking this to? to men who
[1:01:24] are finalizing their stage of
[1:01:27] sanctification,
[1:01:29] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:01:32] cannot receive because it seeth him
[1:01:36] ought not and knowice. Now notice so you
[1:01:39] mean you can't receive him if you don't
[1:01:43] know who he is.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; So what if you're taught he's a third
[1:01:48] person?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Well, that ain't who he is.
[1:01:53] And if you don't see him as he is,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; oh, brother Tony, what about you? What
[1:02:00] about you? I turned Pentecost. Did you
[1:02:02] have the Holy Ghost? Oh, yeah. I had a
[1:02:04] baptism,
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; but I didn't have the person.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; I shouted. I run. I jumped. I spoke in
[1:02:11] tongues. I preached. I prayed for sick
[1:02:13] and watch them get well. All kinds of
[1:02:15] things. And still preach false doctrine.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz I was ignorant to it. I wasn't
[1:02:22] intentionally doing it. I was blind.
[1:02:24] Well, if I'd had the Holy Ghost in my
[1:02:26] soul according to Jesus, wouldn't that
[1:02:29] spirit of truth led me to the truth?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Even the spirit of truth whom the
[1:02:38] world cannot receive, because it seeth
[1:02:41] him not, neither knoweth him, but ye
[1:02:44] know him. For he dwelleth with you and
[1:02:50] shall be in you.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Who's he talking about? The Lord Jesus
[1:02:55] himself, not his body, the pillar of
[1:02:59] fire coming back to break itself up.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you one thing, it's quite
[1:03:03] awesome. If you look in question answers
[1:03:05] 64, and you'll find the prophet of God
[1:03:07] saying, "The same pillar of fire is on
[1:03:09] the earth today anointing sons of God to
[1:03:12] bring the word to the bride." It's
[1:03:14] absolutely phenomenal quote.
[1:03:16] Notice in St. John 14:18, I will not
[1:03:20] leave you comfortless.
[1:03:23] I
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; will come to you.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; So you mean it's Jesus?
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost in the upper room was
[1:03:32] Jesus.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. But the Bible said
[1:03:35] that they saw tongues of fire. They
[1:03:38] didn't see the corporal body.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; What was it? spirit son.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:49] Notice little bride. Oh, let's open our
[1:03:52] little diary package tonight and see
[1:03:54] what's on the inside. What do you say?
[1:03:56] Here's another little thing that God
[1:03:59] wanted to give to to his daughter, the
[1:04:02] bride, who's going to be married to his
[1:04:06] son, the word. You see, the whole family
[1:04:09] is a word family. And God can designate
[1:04:13] what portion of the word that he wants
[1:04:16] the son to fulfill. He designates what
[1:04:19] portion of the word that he wants the
[1:04:21] bride to fulfill. And then he also
[1:04:23] designates the portion of the word that
[1:04:25] he himself will fulfill as father god.
[1:04:29] As father god's spirit form he could not
[1:04:32] die for us because the spirit cannot
[1:04:34] die. As father god he had no blood. So
[1:04:37] what did he do? He took that portion of
[1:04:40] the word and created a son and lived
[1:04:43] inside that son, that human body.
[1:04:46] Hallelujah. In order to pay the price,
[1:04:50] oh that we could be set free.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Notice St. John again 14:27. Peace I
[1:04:57] leave with you.
[1:05:00] My peace
[1:05:03] I give
[1:05:05] unto you.
[1:05:09] How many of you all tonight will be
[1:05:11] honest and say you need more peace in
[1:05:14] your life?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; I understand we're living in a troubled
[1:05:20] world, are we not?
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; We're living in a world when people will
[1:05:26] not even disagree politically or on, you
[1:05:29] know, different values of this and that
[1:05:31] and the other without trying to kill
[1:05:33] you. I'm sure you heard again today
[1:05:35] there was another uh sniper and they uh
[1:05:37] had shot at some ICE agents and it's
[1:05:40] it's the time that we're living at.
[1:05:42] Well, brother Darn, you think about
[1:05:43] that? Of course I do. My own life's been
[1:05:46] threatened many times. Do I think about
[1:05:48] it? Sure I think about it. But you know
[1:05:50] what I told Carol the other day? We
[1:05:52] can't live under the spirit of fear and
[1:05:54] thinking all, you know, oh my goodness,
[1:05:56] I can't get out. I can't go here. I
[1:05:58] can't go there. I will not live that
[1:06:00] way. God does not want me to live that
[1:06:03] way. How can I not live that way? Peace.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Peace. I believe he brought me on the
[1:06:11] earth to serve his purpose. There ain't
[1:06:13] enough devils in hell. There ain't
[1:06:15] enough 30 odd sixes, 270s, whether
[1:06:18] they're Remington or whether be Magnum.
[1:06:20] There ain't enough cannons. There ain't
[1:06:22] enough whatever more to take me out of
[1:06:25] here until God is done with me. Come on,
[1:06:28] somebody. If I didn't believe that, I'd
[1:06:31] be mighty discouraged tonight. The way I
[1:06:33] look at it, if I'm flying on a 747 or
[1:06:36] whatever and that thing crashes, if it
[1:06:39] ain't the will of God for me to go, I'll
[1:06:41] be the only survivor out in the middle
[1:06:42] of the Himalayan mountains or wherever
[1:06:44] it is. And they're thinking, "How in the
[1:06:46] world did that man live? I'll tell you
[1:06:48] how he lived because God wasn't done
[1:06:50] with him yet." And you and I need to get
[1:06:53] away from the fear that the devil
[1:06:55] controls our life and the devil numbers
[1:06:58] our days. No, he don't. He didn't bring
[1:07:01] me on the earth. He can't take me off
[1:07:03] the earth until God's done. Hallelujah.
[1:07:06] I am God almighty son and you are his
[1:07:10] child, his son or daughter. And the
[1:07:12] devil has to back off because God is the
[1:07:16] one who's in control of our lives.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Y'all forgive me tonight. I'm feeling a
[1:07:26] little Church of Christy. Amen.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; My peace I give unto you. Not as the
[1:07:36] world giveth give I unto you. Let not
[1:07:40] your heart be troubled.
[1:07:43] Neither let it be afraid.
[1:07:47] So you mean you and I have some control
[1:07:52] over our heart being troubled
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; and being afraid. Yeah.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Romans 1:7.
[1:08:00] To all that be in Rome, beloved of God,
[1:08:04] called to be saints, grace to you and
[1:08:09] peace
[1:08:10] from both Abraham and Isaac,
[1:08:14] from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
[1:08:18] Christ, to all that be in Rome. I I met
[1:08:22] a brother, let me share this with you. I
[1:08:23] met a brother in Switzerland and he come
[1:08:25] up to me. He couldn't speak English very
[1:08:27] well, but he had a younger guy there. He
[1:08:29] spoke English really well and he said,
[1:08:30] "This is my this is my pastor and he he
[1:08:33] wants to invite you to Rome." So, I got
[1:08:35] a church in Rome. So, this this pastor,
[1:08:38] big tall guy, he told him, he said,
[1:08:39] "Tell him to come and preach where Paul
[1:08:42] preached
[1:08:45] Rome." Well, I may never go to Rome to
[1:08:48] preach, but this scripture right here,
[1:08:51] even though I'm not a Roman, it's got my
[1:08:53] name wrote all over it.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; What about us? Some of you Indiana
[1:08:56] people, Tennessee people, Arkansas
[1:08:58] people, is this scripture just good for
[1:09:00] the Roman brothers and sisters, or is it
[1:09:03] good for us as a people of God? to all
[1:09:06] that be in Rome. Notice how he directs
[1:09:08] to beloved.
[1:09:11] Beloved of God, not just loved, not just
[1:09:15] love. Beloved is a higher degree of
[1:09:19] love, special one who is worthy of
[1:09:23] grace. Chew on that a while. Oh my.
[1:09:28] Beloved of God, called
[1:09:31] to be saints. You're not just called to
[1:09:34] be saved. You're not just called to come
[1:09:37] up through the tribulation period.
[1:09:39] You're called to be saints of the most
[1:09:41] high God.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Grace to you and peace from God our
[1:09:46] father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans
[1:09:49] chapter 5 verse one. Therefore, being
[1:09:52] justified by faith, we have peace, amen,
[1:09:57] with God
[1:09:59] through our Lord Jesus Christ. Not peace
[1:10:03] from God now in this application, but
[1:10:06] peace with God. Why would he say it that
[1:10:08] way? Cuz we were born at war with God.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; We were born at war. Oh my. Aren't you
[1:10:18] glad you ain't at war with God no more?
[1:10:21] Oh my. I'd rather be at war with this
[1:10:23] world. I'd rather be at war with the
[1:10:26] devil. I'd rather be at war with demons
[1:10:28] every day of my life than to be at war
[1:10:31] with God. At one time, I was at war with
[1:10:33] God. All of you were too. You might as
[1:10:35] well say, "Amen." But how in the world
[1:10:37] did I ever make peace? It was not me
[1:10:40] that made peace. It was my Isaac. It was
[1:10:44] my Isaac that paid the price. And he
[1:10:47] said, "You don't have to no longer be at
[1:10:49] war with my father. I will make and tear
[1:10:52] down the middle wall of petition. And I
[1:10:55] will bring you both together, Father God
[1:10:58] and man.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; And I will be your shalom."
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[1:11:14] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:11:18] Jesus Christ. Romans 15:13. Now the God
[1:11:22] of hope fill you with all joy and peace
[1:11:29] in believing.
[1:11:31] Wow. Fill you with all joy and peace.
[1:11:36] I'm a believer. I'm a believer.
[1:11:39] Well, do you have joy and peace and
[1:11:42] you're believing?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm the happiest person in the
[1:11:48] world. Well, let your face know about
[1:11:50] it. Rest of us, too. Okay. Oh, I'm so
[1:11:53] glad I'm saved.
[1:11:56] Thank God. I hope I die today. I'm so
[1:11:58] sick of this life. I'm so sick of it.
[1:12:00] And you got all joy and peace. You sorry
[1:12:02] dog. You ain't telling the truth. The
[1:12:05] devil's robbed you. Your diary is sat
[1:12:08] there. I mean, you got gold and riches
[1:12:10] and treasures and saffron and you've got
[1:12:12] needles of purple and blue and all kinds
[1:12:14] of things piling out of your diary
[1:12:16] chest. And you're sitting there all
[1:12:17] puffed up like a bullfog eating
[1:12:19] buckshot. And you're sitting there sad
[1:12:21] and down and depressed and weary. It's
[1:12:23] time that we rise up pride and say, "I'm
[1:12:26] sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[1:12:29] I'm sick of the devil stealing my joy.
[1:12:32] I'm sick of the devil stealing my
[1:12:34] children. I'm sick of the devil
[1:12:36] interrupting our home. Oh, hallelujah. I
[1:12:39] am grateful tonight that we have peace
[1:12:41] with God.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Now, the God of hope fill you with all
[1:12:51] joy and peace in believing.
[1:12:56] Brother Mike, I just seen you.
[1:13:00] That's the sneakiness preacher right
[1:13:02] there I've ever seen in my life.
[1:13:06] that you may abound
[1:13:09] in hope through the power of the Holy
[1:13:14] Ghost.
[1:13:16] Oh, Philippians 4:7.
[1:13:19] And the peace of God which passes all
[1:13:23] understanding
[1:13:25] shall keep your hearts and minds
[1:13:30] through Christ Jesus.
[1:13:33] The peace of God which passeth all
[1:13:36] understanding. Notice what's going to
[1:13:38] keep your hearts and your mind. The
[1:13:41] peace of God, brother Malca. That's your
[1:13:45] ability to quote scripture. Well, I I
[1:13:47] pay my tithes and and I go to church and
[1:13:49] and I pray for brother Donnie once every
[1:13:51] every now and then whenever I think
[1:13:52] about it and and I do kind deeds and I
[1:13:54] do this and no Lord, I ain't got no
[1:13:56] peace. That's not what that's not what
[1:13:57] does it. It's the power of God. And the
[1:14:00] peace of God which passes all
[1:14:03] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:14:06] minds through Christ Jesus. Colossians
[1:14:10] 3:15.
[1:14:12] And let the peace of God
[1:14:15] rule
[1:14:18] in your hearts. Look at the meaning of
[1:14:22] this word
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; to be an umpire.
[1:14:30] to decide,
[1:14:32] determine,
[1:14:33] direct,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; control.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; You mean peace?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Peace. The peace of God can be like an
[1:14:44] umpire. All right. So, the picture gets
[1:14:47] ready.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; He's doing them finger and all that
[1:14:49] whatever they do back there. Boy, he
[1:14:51] ready on. He whining her up. He's
[1:14:53] getting ready on. Boy, he sold that
[1:14:56] thing today. He boy
[1:14:58] said bow
[1:15:01] and the devil I I mean the pitcher said
[1:15:03] why he he struck out I that old boy it
[1:15:06] ain't in him to to hit a home run. Oh
[1:15:09] but it is. You see it's in us to hit a
[1:15:12] home run. Every member of the bride has
[1:15:15] a built-in mechanism to have a home run.
[1:15:18] Why? We come from home and we're going
[1:15:20] back and we're running on the way back.
[1:15:23] So we are doing a home run. We're not
[1:15:25] squatting. We're not sitting. We're not
[1:15:27] going to be pushed in a wheelchair. And
[1:15:29] they ain't going to roll us in on a
[1:15:30] stretcher somewhere. But the bride's
[1:15:32] doing a home run. So get out of our way,
[1:15:34] devil. And the peace of God is going to
[1:15:37] be the umpire in my heart. I may feel
[1:15:39] down, but the umpire says it's joy
[1:15:42] unspeakable and full of glory,
[1:15:47] but I don't feel it.
[1:15:49] You sure it wasn't a strike? I mean, I'm
[1:15:52] going to sit down if you want me to. I
[1:15:53] think I struck out. I think I I think I
[1:15:56] struck out. He said, "You knucklehead
[1:15:58] you didn't ain't had but one throw at
[1:15:59] you. I don't know where you figured you
[1:16:01] struck out."
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; So the devil winds up another one.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Boy, here comes that ball at 100,
[1:16:10] whatever it is. And you just know for
[1:16:13] get I'm struck out. I'm struck out
[1:16:16] now.
[1:16:20] And you're saying, "Wow, you mean I'm
[1:16:23] still saved? Thank you, Jesus.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; I wish we could let the umpire rule in
[1:16:33] our hearts."
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; So, you get up in the morning and you
[1:16:37] check your phone, you go look at all the
[1:16:38] texts and all the emails and, you know,
[1:16:40] all this and that and other all filled
[1:16:42] with all that negative stuff. Sometimes
[1:16:43] I wish uh some of us didn't even have a
[1:16:46] smartphone cuz it sure don't make us too
[1:16:47] much smarter, does it? Before we ever
[1:16:49] leave the house, we're so down and wore
[1:16:51] out and depressed and so much going on
[1:16:52] in this crazy world that we're living in
[1:16:54] and we let our phone control our hearts
[1:16:56] instead of the peace of God. You let
[1:16:58] your phone be your umpire. You let Fox
[1:17:00] News be your umpire. You let CNN be your
[1:17:03] umpire. I'll tell you one thing, you're
[1:17:05] letting the devil rob you, friends. Let
[1:17:07] the peace of God be your umpire. And
[1:17:10] listen to what he's saying. If he says
[1:17:12] walk, walk.
[1:17:14] [Applause]
[1:17:20] Well, the umpire is truthful. And the
[1:17:21] truth of it is tonight, he's telling us,
[1:17:23] some of us, that we're close to striking
[1:17:26] out.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Some of you done struck twice. You
[1:17:33] better listen to what the umpire is
[1:17:34] saying. He said, "Boy, you better let me
[1:17:36] have control of your life. You better
[1:17:38] let me have control of your emotions.
[1:17:40] You better let me have control of your
[1:17:42] life. And let me be the umpire. I'll
[1:17:45] make the calls for you. And it's not dry
[1:17:47] calls. It's calls with power.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; If he says you're happy, well, I guess
[1:17:52] you ought to act like it.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Let the peace of God rule
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; in your hearts to the which also ye are
[1:18:04] called in one body.
[1:18:08] And be ye
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; sad and depressed.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:18:15] What?
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Thankful.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Thankful.
[1:18:19] Ain't that awesome?
[1:18:21] Now, if that wasn't enough,
[1:18:24] well, let me look over there. What is
[1:18:26] that? Oh my goodness.
[1:18:30] Let me reach down in there and pull out
[1:18:32] of that dowy box.
[1:18:37] Oh my goodness.
[1:18:39] Can that be true?
[1:18:42] Yeah. This little this little item in
[1:18:44] your diary is called we are his
[1:18:48] workmanship.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:10,
[1:18:56] for we
[1:18:58] are his workmanship.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe God makes
[1:19:04] junk?
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Does God specialize in trash?
[1:19:12] Does God specialize in good for
[1:19:15] nothings?
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; All of us are known by our works.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; A sister that can bake and cook and you
[1:19:22] know, no matter what, if it's a country
[1:19:24] cook or whatever it is, she know that.
[1:19:26] Oh yeah, we're having a dinner. Be sure
[1:19:28] now and get sister so and so's beans.
[1:19:30] I'm telling you what, them beans are to
[1:19:32] die for. If Sister Angel Smith makes
[1:19:35] that chocolate cake, you stand right
[1:19:36] there in line. You get your cake.
[1:19:38] Somebody's going to bring that delish
[1:19:40] stuff and this and that and the other.
[1:19:42] Why? You're identified. If Sister
[1:19:44] Barbara brings some of them black
[1:19:46] cookies, oh man, alive. Them no bakes. I
[1:19:49] mean, get up there and get it. Boy,
[1:19:51] whenever we go to heaven, our fall
[1:19:52] festival here in a little bit. And some
[1:19:54] of y'all get in line. Boy, I'm going
[1:19:55] here. I'm going there. Oh yeah, brother
[1:19:57] so and so does that. They make them deer
[1:19:59] nuggets and they cut that up and they
[1:20:02] wrap that in that bacon. I'll tell you
[1:20:03] what, I'm slobbering right now thinking
[1:20:05] about it. Why? Because the worst. Now,
[1:20:07] what if it tasted like tar? What if it
[1:20:09] tasted like tarpentine with a little bit
[1:20:11] of sulfur and a little bit of apples,
[1:20:13] you know, asphalt on the side and you
[1:20:15] dip it over an oil? You know, you'd say,
[1:20:17] "Don't never go to that booth. That
[1:20:19] stuff will make you sicker than a dog."
[1:20:21] You're identified by your works. You're
[1:20:23] identified by what you put out. Almighty
[1:20:26] God's reputation.
[1:20:28] If he does not produce a bride that is
[1:20:32] like himself,
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; he is an absolute liar and failure.
[1:20:39] But I ain't worried about that
[1:20:40] happening. Are you?
[1:20:43] My God don't make no junk. He don't make
[1:20:46] no trash. He don't make hallelujah
[1:20:48] something that he cannot trust. My God
[1:20:51] will complete his work.
[1:20:54] [Applause]
[1:21:00] You see that stone column right there?
[1:21:04] That's my workmanship.
[1:21:07] You see this one? That's brother Dave
[1:21:09] Swanson's workmanship.
[1:21:12] Now, you study the way they're laid
[1:21:15] and you'll see I've got a style and he
[1:21:17] has a style. The sign out on the road,
[1:21:20] my style. Simon in the in the the
[1:21:23] fireplace over there, mine and his
[1:21:25] together.
[1:21:27] So you see, God is identified by his
[1:21:30] workmanship.
[1:21:32] So on the day of Pentecost, the great
[1:21:34] contractor come down himself and he
[1:21:37] said, "Boy, I'm tell you one thing. Now
[1:21:38] these old boys,
[1:21:40] they're they're something. These boys
[1:21:42] are something, but just wait till I get
[1:21:44] done with them. Just wait till I get
[1:21:47] work done working on Peter. He is going
[1:21:49] to make me a fire brand like the devil
[1:21:51] ain't never heard nothing about it
[1:21:52] before. You wait till John gets the Holy
[1:21:55] Ghost. Him and James. I mean, they're
[1:21:57] the sons of thunder. I named them that.
[1:21:59] But boy, wait till they get the Holy
[1:22:00] Ghost. It'll turn John from a son of
[1:22:03] thunder into love itself. It'll totally
[1:22:06] transform John. It'll change Thaddius.
[1:22:08] It'll even change Mary. It'll change
[1:22:11] them all. Why? Because they are going to
[1:22:13] Lord have mercy. They're going to be my
[1:22:15] workmanship. And when I get done with
[1:22:17] them, even the angels of God will circle
[1:22:20] the earth with their heads bowed
[1:22:23] as they look at my work.
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:33] So the astronomers say
[1:22:38] that there's over
[1:22:42] one setillion stars
[1:22:46] in the visible universe.
[1:22:50] So that's a one with 21 zeros.
[1:22:57] That's quite impressive, isn't it?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; I mean, I know y'all know the word
[1:23:01] septanian all the time. That's how much
[1:23:02] money you've got, right?
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; If you're playing Monopoly, maybe.
[1:23:10] But that was not the height of his
[1:23:12] creation.
[1:23:15] The height was when he said, "Let us
[1:23:19] make man in our image."
[1:23:24] And the prophet tells us that God wanted
[1:23:27] a world
[1:23:29] filled with sons and daughters.
[1:23:36] Now, he knew when he made this little
[1:23:38] blue dot
[1:23:40] and put it out in this
[1:23:43] Milky Way,
[1:23:46] and he knew that it would be one of the
[1:23:48] smallest.
[1:23:50] Had it been just a bit closer to the
[1:23:52] sun, it been too hot for life to
[1:23:55] survive.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Had it been just a little farther away,
[1:24:00] it would have been too cold.
[1:24:02] But he placed it right in what they call
[1:24:05] the habitable zone.
[1:24:09] Habitable zone. So, they're spending all
[1:24:11] kinds of money trying to find another
[1:24:13] planet like this one. I I'll go ahead
[1:24:16] and tell them. I mean, NASA won't listen
[1:24:18] to me anyway, you know, but they're not
[1:24:20] going to find one.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; The Earth is the only planet whose name
[1:24:26] is in the book of life,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; which is the Bible. Jupiter, Neptune,
[1:24:32] Mars, Saturn, none of them are there.
[1:24:36] Why don't God throw this earth away and
[1:24:38] make another one? He cannot.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Because this earth is his attribute.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; And remember, he come on the earth and
[1:24:48] took his own body out of the 16 elements
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; of this earth. And the Lord God never
[1:24:57] had a permanent flesh body until Jesus.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Now that body sits at the right hand of
[1:25:04] the spirit thrown universe there to make
[1:25:07] intercession for us. For we are his
[1:25:12] workmanship
[1:25:14] created.
[1:25:17] I was at the stone yard Monday getting
[1:25:20] some stone for a little bit of
[1:25:21] landscaping I've been doing over here at
[1:25:23] the church.
[1:25:25] And the guy there that he knows me and I
[1:25:28] bought quite a bit from him and he said,
[1:25:30] ' Do you know this man? I said, 'N no.
[1:25:33] And I I was over there picking up rocks
[1:25:36] one at a time.
[1:25:38] So this guy, they picked up a pallet and
[1:25:42] scooted it through on his truck and
[1:25:44] loaded it on the truck. Well, the guy
[1:25:46] that owned that truck, he come over to
[1:25:47] me and he said, "I was going to tell you
[1:25:50] they do load them up.
[1:25:55] I said, "Yeah, sir." And I was going to
[1:25:57] ask you, "Was you holding your breath
[1:25:58] the whole time that's loading them up in
[1:26:00] the back of that brand new Ford truck of
[1:26:02] yours?"
[1:26:04] And then the guy suddenly has said, "Oh,
[1:26:06] he comes here all the time talking about
[1:26:08] me." He said, "He's one picky fell. He
[1:26:11] goes out there in that yard and he picks
[1:26:13] them up one at a time and looks at him."
[1:26:19] Well, you see, I have something in my
[1:26:22] mind
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; that I want it to look like. So, I
[1:26:25] finished most of it for the most part
[1:26:27] today. So, I was up here taking pictures
[1:26:29] of it and sending it to Carol. So, I get
[1:26:31] my phone down like this. I get as people
[1:26:33] pass by and said, "That's the preacher."
[1:26:37] You imagine how the people are that go
[1:26:38] to church there. He's out there taking
[1:26:41] pictures of dirt.
[1:26:45] So this one had little green specks and
[1:26:47] that one had little silver and this one
[1:26:49] had this and that one had that. And I
[1:26:50] sent Carol a little caption down at the
[1:26:52] bottom of it. Handpicked rocks. And she
[1:26:54] answered back, "That's the best kind."
[1:26:57] So you see that is a mirror of my work.
[1:27:02] That's my workmanship. Each of you are
[1:27:05] known by your word. Then how would we
[1:27:08] ever believe that God would have to
[1:27:11] settle for a faulty, flawed church that
[1:27:15] barely makes it to church once every now
[1:27:17] and then, and they can't quit overcoming
[1:27:19] sin and lying and all kinds of filthy
[1:27:22] habits. And the great creator has to
[1:27:25] settle for that. Well, I guess I just
[1:27:27] have to settle for that.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:27:35] For we are his workmanship,
[1:27:40] created
[1:27:42] in Christ Jesus
[1:27:48] unto good works. We are his making. And
[1:27:53] these virtues that we've been talking
[1:27:54] about for several several weeks, that's
[1:27:57] the creation unfolding in our lives.
[1:28:00] You see, we are his making. We are
[1:28:04] created by him and for him. Now, it's
[1:28:08] more than just the general sense of
[1:28:10] rocks and trees and cattle and all that
[1:28:13] sort of thing. But this is a new
[1:28:16] creation. Now, look at the word created.
[1:28:18] I about had a spell when I looked at
[1:28:19] this. We're created in Christ Jesus. And
[1:28:22] it means to make
[1:28:25] habitable.
[1:28:28] habitable
[1:28:31] to people, a place, a region, an island.
[1:28:37] Hence to found a city, a colony, a
[1:28:41] state, to form, shape, to completely
[1:28:46] change
[1:28:48] or transform.
[1:28:50] For we are his workmanship, created in
[1:28:55] Christ Jesus
[1:28:57] for what?
[1:28:59] What?
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Good works.
[1:29:03] You see, this is why a person that
[1:29:05] really has the Holy Ghost, it's it's
[1:29:08] just as easy for them to do good works
[1:29:11] as it is an an evil person to do bad
[1:29:14] works.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; That's just their nature. Because their
[1:29:18] old nature has been annihilated and the
[1:29:21] workmanship of the almighty God has been
[1:29:24] recreated in their soul. You're quite
[1:29:26] something. You know that if you are born
[1:29:29] again, you are quite something.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; For we are his workmanship, created in
[1:29:36] Christ Jesus unto good works, which God
[1:29:40] hath before ordained
[1:29:43] that we should walk in them. Oh my. God
[1:29:47] ordained you and I to live a holy life.
[1:29:49] And the church said God ordained us to
[1:29:52] live a life of holiness
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; and purity and separation.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Now the word here that that Paul used to
[1:30:01] means to prepare beforehand is to
[1:30:04] predestinate or to appoint before it. It
[1:30:08] includes the idea of a previous
[1:30:11] determination
[1:30:13] or an arrangement beforehand for
[1:30:17] securing a certain result.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Ah, so if you want a certain result and
[1:30:27] you're dealing with old dirt bags, you
[1:30:30] better predetermine.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; There ain't no telling what you'll come
[1:30:34] out if you don't. So God said, "Now this
[1:30:36] is going to be the greatness and the
[1:30:38] height of my creation. I will put my
[1:30:41] sons and daughters in mortal flesh. I
[1:30:44] will put them in that oil. I I I will
[1:30:47] put them in that and I will predestinate
[1:30:50] them. It is in my being. It is in my
[1:30:53] being to give me a purpose, a reason
[1:30:58] to be."
[1:31:02] I'll let you think on that for a minute.
[1:31:06] The previous preparation
[1:31:08] of the divine intention. You see, and
[1:31:12] Paul said that we should walk in them.
[1:31:15] Watch again. Ephesians chapter 2:1.
[1:31:18] Wherefore remember that ye being in time
[1:31:21] past, Gentiles in the flesh, who are
[1:31:25] called uncircumcision by that which is
[1:31:27] called the circumcision, that at that
[1:31:30] time ye were without Christ. Oh my,
[1:31:33] remember that. I don't ever want to go
[1:31:34] back to that again.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Being aliens
[1:31:39] from the commonwealth of Israel. Oh my.
[1:31:42] and strangers from the covenants of
[1:31:45] promise, having no hope
[1:31:48] and without God
[1:31:50] in the world.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to preach to you sometime
[1:31:54] on these two words, but now that's what
[1:31:59] I was, but now. But now in Christ Jesus,
[1:32:04] ye who sometimes were a far off are made
[1:32:09] nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is
[1:32:14] our peace,
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; who has made both one Jew and Gentile,
[1:32:21] and has broken down the middle wall of
[1:32:24] partition between us. He is our peace.
[1:32:27] So the Lord Jesus died for both Jew and
[1:32:30] Gentile to make in them one new man. The
[1:32:33] new man, the new creation is what? The
[1:32:36] church. They could never do it under the
[1:32:38] Abrahamic covenant of the flesh. They
[1:32:40] could never do it under the covenant
[1:32:41] with Isaac, the covenant of Jacob. So it
[1:32:44] had to be a new covenant. A star would
[1:32:47] arise out of Jacob. A star would arise
[1:32:50] out of Jacob. not a man, not that would
[1:32:53] come down through Isaac's lineage, but a
[1:32:55] star from heaven would arise out of
[1:32:57] Jacob and he would have the scepter cuz
[1:33:00] the scepter would come and it would be
[1:33:02] whatever he would bring forth. Oh, glory
[1:33:04] to God. And he would come forth from
[1:33:05] between the feet. And what would he do?
[1:33:08] He would make in one new man. One new
[1:33:11] man called what? Jew, Gentile, the
[1:33:14] church.
[1:33:16] Oh Jesus became our shalom
[1:33:22] who has made both one form one church
[1:33:26] out of two different types of people
[1:33:28] Jews and Gentiles by abolishing the law
[1:33:33] of the covenant that was given by Moses
[1:33:35] which is only temporary only to last for
[1:33:37] a while. Notice in verse 15, chapter 2,
[1:33:40] having abolished in his flesh the
[1:33:42] enmity, even the law of commandments
[1:33:45] contained in ordinances, for to make in
[1:33:49] himself of twain one new man.
[1:33:54] So here he comes to take within himself
[1:33:58] the Jewish law, the Jews take within
[1:34:01] himself and merge the Gentiles in
[1:34:04] himself. And then once they come in him,
[1:34:07] the product out of that the two become
[1:34:11] one
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; called what? The church.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. For to make it himself of twain
[1:34:20] one new man, so making peace, that he
[1:34:24] might reconcile both unto God in the one
[1:34:28] body by the cross, having slain the
[1:34:31] enmity thereby, and came and preached
[1:34:34] peace to you who were a far off, and to
[1:34:38] them that were nigh, Jew and Gentile.
[1:34:41] And through him we both have access.
[1:34:45] Here you go, little bride. Here are some
[1:34:48] more of your little dowy. Access the act
[1:34:53] of bringing to approach to God. That
[1:34:57] relationship with God whereby we are
[1:35:00] acceptable to him and have assurance
[1:35:04] that he is favorably disposed
[1:35:08] towards him,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; permitted to approach God through his
[1:35:14] name. Aren't you glad tonight? So here
[1:35:18] the Greek word here relates the word
[1:35:20] that Paul chose to use was someone
[1:35:22] seeking an audience of a great personage
[1:35:27] and an officer would go between the
[1:35:30] person seeking the audience and the one
[1:35:33] they're seeking the audience from. It
[1:35:35] was a person that was greatly trusted
[1:35:38] and one that had authority. And this
[1:35:41] deputy, this magistrate, this person
[1:35:44] mediator in our state would go between
[1:35:47] them and say, "Sir, he wants to see you.
[1:35:50] He wants to see you." And I I want to
[1:35:52] sue you and say that I I think that you
[1:35:54] should see him. I think you should take
[1:35:56] time with him or with her and to help
[1:35:58] him that I I think that that they are
[1:35:59] worthy of it. They are worthy of it. Oh,
[1:36:02] children,
[1:36:04] they are worthy of it.
[1:36:07] They are worthy of it.
[1:36:09] You imagine the book of Revelation, the
[1:36:11] worthy one saying to the church, "For ye
[1:36:15] will walk with me in white, for ye are
[1:36:19] worthy."
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; So here we come to the approach,
[1:36:28] not to a stern, angry God.
[1:36:33] And you've heard me tell it before when
[1:36:34] I was a trinitarian and I didn't know
[1:36:36] how to pray. And I'd pray to the father
[1:36:39] and I'd pray to the son. I'd pray to the
[1:36:40] holy ghost. And I go back, forget which
[1:36:42] one I'd prayed to.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; You think, "Well, that's pretty far
[1:36:45] out." Well, brother Brandham said he
[1:36:46] used to think that God hated him and
[1:36:48] Jesus loved him.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; He said till he found out that's the
[1:36:51] same person.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; So the wrath of God was swallowed up in
[1:36:55] the heart of the Lord Jesus. And he
[1:36:57] settled my account.
[1:37:00] My signature was on there. I said I was
[1:37:03] guilty. I agreed. I lied. I agreed. I'd
[1:37:05] done wrong. I agreed. I validated it
[1:37:08] with my own signature. He said, "Sign
[1:37:10] it, Donnie, and let me have it."
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:17] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Ephesians 2:19.
[1:37:20] Now, therefore, ye are no more
[1:37:22] strangers,
[1:37:24] alien from a person or a thing, without
[1:37:26] the knowledge of, without a share in, oh
[1:37:31] no. Oh my. Unheard of. One who receives
[1:37:35] and entertains,
[1:37:37] another hospitably, and who stays or
[1:37:41] lodges.
[1:37:44] You're no longer strangers and
[1:37:46] foreigners. One who lives in a place
[1:37:48] without the right of citizenship. That
[1:37:51] was me. Metaphorically without
[1:37:53] citizenship in God's kingdom. one who
[1:37:56] lives on earth as a stranger, a
[1:37:58] souljourer on earth of Christians whose
[1:38:02] fatherland is in heaven.
[1:38:05] You were strangers and foreigners, but
[1:38:09] now fellow citizens
[1:38:12] possessing the same citizenship with
[1:38:16] others. A fellow citizen of Gentiles is
[1:38:19] received into the communion of the
[1:38:21] saints of the people consecrated
[1:38:25] to God.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:38:31] Notice this. fellow citizens with the
[1:38:35] saints and the household of God and are
[1:38:39] built upon the foundation of the
[1:38:42] apostles and the prophets, Jesus Christ
[1:38:45] himself being the chief cornerstone, and
[1:38:48] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:38:51] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[1:38:54] the Lord. Fitly framed together was a
[1:38:57] carpenter term. It meant to join
[1:39:00] together as a carpenter would join
[1:39:02] together the framework of a building.
[1:39:07] Oh, praise God. So, the materials are
[1:39:10] exactly cut by whom? God himself. So, we
[1:39:15] have some of the church that'll be like
[1:39:16] this. We'll have some preachers that'll
[1:39:18] preach this way, some that are preached
[1:39:19] that way, some that are preached the
[1:39:21] other way. Thank God for it. He knows
[1:39:23] exactly what to make. Is that right? So
[1:39:25] he does the same in your life as a lay
[1:39:27] person and God will take that and bring
[1:39:30] it all together. And what Paul
[1:39:33] identified in whom all the building
[1:39:35] fitly framed together groweth. Wow. What
[1:39:39] a strange building. This building is a
[1:39:43] growing building.
[1:39:47] growing high
[1:39:49] in faith and virtue and knowledge.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Whoa. As far as number wise and all that
[1:39:57] close we get to the end, we ain't going
[1:39:59] to grow so much in number. I figure
[1:40:01] we're going to get smaller and smaller.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; There'll be more and more that'll turn
[1:40:05] away. Not only that, we're getting more
[1:40:07] on the other side than we got left here.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; But the building is growing. growing in
[1:40:14] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:40:16] together groweth unto a holy temple
[1:40:23] in the Lord.
[1:40:27] The growth of the church is not measured
[1:40:29] by how many new people you get.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; I mean, go out and knock on people's
[1:40:34] doors and try to bring them to the
[1:40:36] message. We try to hand out, you know,
[1:40:39] doctrinal things and this and that. No,
[1:40:42] this this growth here, it's not so much
[1:40:44] the natural. In whom also ye are builded
[1:40:47] together for a habitation of God through
[1:40:51] the spirit. In the book of Genesis, God
[1:40:55] walked with his people. But in Exodus,
[1:40:59] he decided to dwell with his people.
[1:41:03] Exodus 25:8
[1:41:06] in the tabernacle also chapter 40:34
[1:41:10] until Israel's sin caused the glory of
[1:41:13] God to leave the tabernacle. But then
[1:41:17] once again God appears on the earth in
[1:41:20] the body of Jesus, his own personal
[1:41:24] human temple, that the spirit of God
[1:41:28] could dwell in that structure. Let's
[1:41:31] read and I'll close your just
[1:41:32] momentarily. Ephesians 3:1, "For this
[1:41:35] cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus
[1:41:38] Christ for you Gentiles, if ye have
[1:41:40] heard of the dispensation of the grace
[1:41:43] of God, which is given me to youward,
[1:41:46] how that by revelation he made known
[1:41:49] unto me the mystery, as I wrote a four
[1:41:52] and few words, whereby that when you
[1:41:55] reach you may understand my knowledge in
[1:41:58] the mystery of Christ, which in other
[1:42:01] ages was not made known
[1:42:05] unto the sons of men. Now, no doubt
[1:42:07] there were Christians in that day that
[1:42:10] was not concerned about the mystery of
[1:42:12] Christ. They just wanted to be saved,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; saved from hell, go to church, you know,
[1:42:19] do a little bit of this, a little bit of
[1:42:20] that. Now, we know that had to be there
[1:42:22] because that church had already started
[1:42:24] riding. The white horse rider had
[1:42:25] already started riding and made a twin
[1:42:28] to the real identified church. So, they
[1:42:29] just thought, "All you got to do is
[1:42:30] believe. You just believe and you accept
[1:42:32] it and that's it. But Paul said, "Oh,
[1:42:35] no, no, no. There's much, much more.
[1:42:37] There's many mysteries here that if
[1:42:40] you're part of that elect, you'll enter
[1:42:43] into that great place with God, which in
[1:42:46] other ages was not made known unto the
[1:42:48] sons of men. It is now revealed unto his
[1:42:52] holy apostles and prophets by the
[1:42:54] spirit, that the Gentiles
[1:42:57] should be fellows
[1:42:59] of the same body." Can you imagine now
[1:43:01] some of them Jews sitting there?
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Now Paul wrote this to the church in
[1:43:08] Ephesus which is mainly Gentiles.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; You imagine some of them Jews struggling
[1:43:14] but they ain't them. They ain't fit to
[1:43:17] sit with us. Wow. They men ain't even
[1:43:19] circumcised.
[1:43:21] Somebody told me they seen them eating
[1:43:23] barbecue pork. Lord have mercy. They eat
[1:43:27] eggs. Ah, I I can't believe they they
[1:43:31] they say they got the same thing we do.
[1:43:34] You imagine some of them had the office
[1:43:36] time ever was. And you hear Paul telling
[1:43:38] them, "Look, brothers, they're heirs
[1:43:39] just like you are." Oh, don't you tell
[1:43:42] me that God spoke to Moses and God spoke
[1:43:45] to Abraham and God said, "This is an
[1:43:48] everlasting covenant. How you going to
[1:43:49] break an everlasting covenant, Paul?
[1:43:51] You're a false prophet."
[1:43:54] He said, "I'm telling you, brothers,
[1:43:55] it's a mystery. Will you show me where
[1:43:58] Moses said them Gentiles would come in?
[1:44:00] Paul,
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; come on, brother.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Let's take Paul to the Torah.
[1:44:08] Now, Paul, I want you to show me one
[1:44:10] scripture in the Torah that said he'd
[1:44:13] have a gentile bride and divorce Israel.
[1:44:19] Now, what would you done? You're first
[1:44:21] century believers.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Some of you Jews, some of you Gentiles.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; And y'all come to Word of Life Church.
[1:44:30] And I stand up here to preach and I'm
[1:44:33] reading from Paul's books.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; And putting it up on the screen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; But now remember in that day to a lot of
[1:44:45] those people, they did not consider
[1:44:48] those books scripture.
[1:44:50] or sacred.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; But some of them did.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; They saw it and they realized Paul had
[1:45:00] things that Peter couldn't touch.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; And word of life said,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Paul preached things James didn't
[1:45:09] understand one thing about.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Why? It was given to a prophet of God.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; So has it been in this day, and I thank
[1:45:18] God for it. Amen.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Praise
[1:45:22] be to God. Wherefore I was made a
[1:45:25] minister according to the gift of grace
[1:45:27] of God given unto me by the effectual
[1:45:30] working of his power unto me who am less
[1:45:34] than the least of all saints. In this
[1:45:38] grace given that I should preach among
[1:45:42] the Gentiles
[1:45:44] the unarchable
[1:45:48] riches
[1:45:50] of Christ.
[1:45:53] This word uncarchable means astonishing
[1:45:58] and boundless
[1:46:02] treasures of grace
[1:46:05] which God has given to us
[1:46:09] and to make all men see what is the
[1:46:11] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[1:46:14] beginning of the world hath been hid in
[1:46:17] God who created all things by Jesus
[1:46:22] Christ. So in the heart of God was this
[1:46:25] secret counsel to make a people like
[1:46:29] himself.
[1:46:32] Don't you love him?
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; How many is grateful for your dowy?
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[1:46:43] Praise God.
[1:46:46] He is our peace. PE
[1:46:51] who has broken down every
[1:46:55] wall.
[1:46:59] Here
[1:47:01] our peace.
[1:47:05] His
[1:47:08] peace.
[1:47:11] He is
[1:47:13] our peace.
[1:47:16] who has broken down every wall.
[1:47:23] He is
[1:47:26] our peace.
[1:47:28] [Music]
[1:47:29] He is
[1:47:32] our peace.
[1:47:34] Let's sing it together now. Cast all
[1:47:36] your cares. Cast all your cares
[1:47:41] on him
[1:47:44] for he cares for you.
[1:47:51] He is our peace. Do you believe this
[1:47:56] tonight, children? He is our peace.
[1:48:02] Yes, he is.
[1:48:05] Cast all your cares on him
[1:48:11] for he cares for you.
[1:48:16] [Music]
[1:48:18] He is our peace.
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:24] Check.
[1:48:25] He is our peace.
[1:48:31] Oh, he is our peace.
[1:48:36] who has broken down. Can we stand our
[1:48:39] feet now as we worship him together?
[1:48:42] Oh, thank you, Lord. He is
[1:48:47] our peace.
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:51] He is
[1:48:53] our peace.
[1:48:57] Oh, he is our peace.
[1:49:02] who has broken down
[1:49:06] every wall.
[1:49:10] He is
[1:49:14] our Jesus.
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:28] Whatever you need tonight, children,
[1:49:30] cast your cares on him.
[1:49:33] You're sick, you're weary, you're
[1:49:36] oppressed. Cast it on him. He bore it.
[1:49:40] He bore it for you.
[1:49:44] He is our king.
[1:49:48] Oh,
[1:49:50] cast all your cares on him.
[1:49:56] Lord, he cares
[1:49:59] for you.
[1:50:01] Oh,
[1:50:03] is
[1:50:05] our peace.
[1:50:08] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:50:11] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just close
[1:50:14] our eyes now. Can we just raise our
[1:50:16] hands? Play it, brothers. Let's just
[1:50:18] worship him now in your own way.
[1:50:21] Remember, you were one time without the
[1:50:23] Commonwealths of Israel. You were at war
[1:50:27] against God.
[1:50:29] Oh, but now not only are you just saved,
[1:50:33] but your bride called by him, chosen by
[1:50:38] him.
[1:50:39] You got a treasure box of a dowy filled
[1:50:43] with all kinds of good things. Gifts to
[1:50:47] encourage you along your way.
[1:50:50] Healing when you're sick. Oh, it's not
[1:50:53] little dime store trinkets that you'll
[1:50:56] pull out of there. He didn't go to big
[1:50:57] lots and catch it on special, but it
[1:51:01] cost him so much. Oh, hallelujah. Along
[1:51:04] your way this journey. Oh, cast all your
[1:51:09] cares on him.
[1:51:13] I know he cares
[1:51:16] for you.
[1:51:18] [Applause]
[1:51:20] He is our peace.
[1:51:26] My Lord, you are our king.
[1:51:31] [Applause]
[1:51:32] Oh,
[1:51:34] cast all your cares on him
[1:51:39] for he cares for you.
[1:51:46] He is
[1:51:49] our peace.
[1:51:53] He is
[1:51:55] our peace.
[1:52:00] I wonder how many you are tonight sick,
[1:52:02] got a need in your body, maybe a
[1:52:04] sickness, an affliction, something
[1:52:05] you're dealing with as believers,
[1:52:09] you're commissioned by God to lay hands
[1:52:11] on one another. Was down in the meetings
[1:52:14] in Kentucky with Brother Larry Hara this
[1:52:16] past weekend. Brother John Andy's did a
[1:52:19] great job.
[1:52:20] had some singing and a brother from
[1:52:22] India also there and I spoke a couple of
[1:52:24] services and at the end of the service I
[1:52:27] had the saints of God to lay their hands
[1:52:29] on one another. The anointing of God
[1:52:31] swept in that place. It was just
[1:52:33] wonderful what the Lord did. Brother Le
[1:52:35] calling me yesterday telling me of this
[1:52:37] one that was delivered. This one was
[1:52:39] healed. That one was delivered. Not not
[1:52:42] a preacher come up run them through a
[1:52:43] prayer line. Well, this famous preacher
[1:52:45] prayed for me. But saints of God lay
[1:52:47] their hand on one another. He said,
[1:52:49] "Brother Donnie, I believe that's just
[1:52:50] going to be the the beginning of great
[1:52:52] things we're going to hear that our
[1:52:53] God's doing." You know what? You get
[1:52:55] what you expect.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; So, if you expect a Wednesday night
[1:52:58] service, well, we ain't going to do
[1:53:00] much. I guess we'll just kind of go to
[1:53:01] church and hang out a little bit. You
[1:53:03] can hang out if you want to. I come here
[1:53:05] to worship God.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; And where my God is, supernatural is
[1:53:09] always made manifest.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; So, I want you to lay hands on one
[1:53:13] another right now, would you?
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:19] Now, these are his words. These signs
[1:53:22] shall follow them that believe.
[1:53:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:30] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:53:33] Brother Daryl, come up here and pray for
[1:53:36] the people.
[1:53:39] Hallelujah.
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:44] Lord God, we believe you, Father.
[1:53:48] Hallelujah Jesus.
[1:53:51] It's in your dowy children.
[1:53:55] You can take it to the bank as we say.
[1:53:58] It will not bounce.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:54:06] Hallelujah.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; this is who we are.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we lay hands up on one another
[1:54:15] tonight, God, We exercise our God-given
[1:54:18] rights as believers, Lord. Believing,
[1:54:20] dear God, that heavens and earth will
[1:54:22] pass away, yet your word shall never
[1:54:23] fail, Lord. And Father God, it's
[1:54:25] written, they shall lay hands upon the
[1:54:27] sick and they shall recover. And
[1:54:28] tonight, as sons and daughters of God,
[1:54:30] Lord, we exercise this right, God, to
[1:54:33] lay hands upon our brothers and upon our
[1:54:34] sisters, God. And we pray, God, in the
[1:54:37] name of Jesus, oh lamb of God, by that
[1:54:39] anointing that raised my Lord, from the
[1:54:41] grave. Hallelujah. And may it move, dear
[1:54:43] God, upon every need, upon every
[1:54:45] situation, God. Lord, may back trouble
[1:54:48] leave, may anxiety leave, may fear
[1:54:50] leave, may depression leave tonight in
[1:54:52] the name of Jesus Christ. May every
[1:54:54] sickness leave the people tonight. For
[1:54:56] you are our portion, dear God. You are
[1:54:58] our healer, God. You are our sustainer
[1:55:00] tonight. And we receive it, dear God.
[1:55:02] The ABCs of our healing is to accept it
[1:55:05] and to believe it and confess it. And we
[1:55:07] confess tonight, you are our healer,
[1:55:09] Satan, by the authority given to us as
[1:55:11] sons and daughters of God. We rebuke you
[1:55:14] tonight. Come out of the people. You're
[1:55:16] defeated in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[1:55:19] cast you down tonight by the power of
[1:55:21] the Holy Ghost that dwells within the
[1:55:24] hearts of the believers tonight. We
[1:55:26] receive it tonight. We accept it
[1:55:28] tonight. We confess it tonight. We are
[1:55:30] overcomers. We are the bride of Jesus
[1:55:33] Christ. We are sons and daughters of
[1:55:35] God. And every devil, every demon,
[1:55:38] sickness, death, hell itself is under
[1:55:41] the feet of the believer. And we triumph
[1:55:43] with Christ tonight in the name of Jesus
[1:55:46] Christ. We are free. The blood of the
[1:55:48] lamb of God has made us free. I accept
[1:55:51] it tonight in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:55:54] for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Boy,
[1:55:57] if you believe it tonight, raise your
[1:55:59] hand and accept it tonight. Raise your
[1:56:01] hand and reach. I challenge you to
[1:56:03] believe it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:56:06] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:10] Hallelujah.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.

[1:56:45] name in his book before the foundation
[1:56:47] of the world. His report says we are the

[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Daryl, I don't feel one
[2:01:03] thing. He never said, "Did you feel it?"
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Did you believe it?" Yeah.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; If thou can believe,
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad tonight?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; What an hour he's been given to us
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; to be sons and daughters of God.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:27] Amen. We've seen it so much, friends.
[2:01:30] We've seen it so much. You've seen God.
[2:01:35] You know, Jessica came through the house
[2:01:37] one time. She's about six years old.
[2:01:40] She got that feeding tube scar in her
[2:01:43] stomach and always told her she's
[2:01:45] special cuz she looks like a belly
[2:01:47] button. She has two belly buttons. I
[2:01:48] said, "You're special. You got two belly
[2:01:50] buttons."
[2:01:54] And she went on through the house
[2:01:55] playing, just playing, you know, just
[2:01:57] six-year-old, something like that. And I
[2:01:59] was sitting at the table praying and
[2:02:01] studying Genesis 24.
[2:02:04] And I said, 'Lord,
[2:02:06] if you've done so much for her, it would
[2:02:09] be a sin for me to doubt that you
[2:02:11] couldn't take that scar off of her body.
[2:02:14] And friends, he has done so much for us,
[2:02:17] this body of believers. Is that not
[2:02:18] true?
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; It would be a sin for us to doubt that
[2:02:21] God couldn't touch something in my life.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; I said, I know you could take that scar
[2:02:26] from her. And this anointing, just this
[2:02:28] warm feeling come over me. voice spoke
[2:02:30] to my heart said, "I could take that
[2:02:32] scar from her, but I left it so that
[2:02:36] every time you see it, it'll remind you
[2:02:39] of where I brought her from."
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad where he's brought
[2:02:46] us from tonight, friends?
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; He don't remember that you ever done it,
[2:02:49] but you remember. But I wonder sometimes
[2:02:52] if we don't remember,
[2:02:54] is that to remind us of where he brought
[2:02:56] us from?
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Have you enjoyed the
[2:02:59] word of God tonight?
[2:03:02] Amen.
[2:03:04] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:08] Me and Sher's leaving in the morning for
[2:03:10] Galina, Missouri for some meetings
[2:03:12] starting out there tomorrow night and
[2:03:13] have to be at the airport at 5:00. So,
[2:03:16] we desire your prayers, the Lord, just
[2:03:17] give us traveling grace and bless the
[2:03:19] meetings. We'll have a prayer line, I
[2:03:20] think, on Saturday night. So, we
[2:03:21] certainly appreciate your your prayers
[2:03:23] and we certainly appreciate brother
[2:03:25] Donnie, don't we? What a wonderful,
[2:03:27] wonderful, wonderful man of God. Amen.
[2:03:34] Let's just bow our heads.
[2:03:40] Heavenly Father,
[2:03:43] Lord, as we come to
[2:03:46] the close of a another service, Lord,
[2:03:51] once again, oh God, have you come, Lord,
[2:03:54] and stirred our hearts.
[2:03:57] Once again, Lord, have you anointed your
[2:03:59] servant, Brother Donnie, to bring us
[2:04:01] precious words of life.
[2:04:04] And we are so grateful and we are so
[2:04:06] thankful. And Lord, tonight as a body of
[2:04:09] believers, we laid hands upon one
[2:04:12] another.
[2:04:13] And Father, I'm reminded of what your
[2:04:15] prophet told us, Lord, that if angels
[2:04:18] laid hands upon us, it would do us no
[2:04:21] good unless we accepted it. Accepted
[2:04:25] what you done. And Lord, tonight in the
[2:04:27] name of Jesus, we accept dear God
[2:04:31] that this means
[2:04:33] the way Lord of your anointing to flow
[2:04:36] from one to the other as believers
[2:04:38] laying hands. And Father, we accept that
[2:04:40] tonight as your word, Lord, and you said
[2:04:43] your word will not fail. So Lord, we
[2:04:46] accept tonight as our brothers and our
[2:04:47] sisters laid hands up on us that it was
[2:04:50] thy will being done in our lives, Lord.
[2:04:52] and we accept that which we have need of
[2:04:55] in the name of Jesus. Lord, go with your
[2:04:58] people now. Give them traveling grace
[2:04:59] and be with us tomorrow as we travel,
[2:05:01] Lord, and keep our family safe at home
[2:05:04] till we return. And we love you, Lord.
[2:05:07] We thank you once again for all that
[2:05:10] you've done for us, Lord. Be people now,
[2:05:13] Father. Renew the strength of Brother
[2:05:14] Donnie. We pray
[2:05:17] others, Lord, who was streaming tonight,
[2:05:19] not here. We pray, oh God, may the
[2:05:20] anointing go just where they're at right
[2:05:22] now, Lord, and lift that affliction off
[2:05:24] of them in the name of Jesus. That Lord,
[2:05:26] by the rising of three sons, may they
[2:05:28] know that they have been in your
[2:05:30] presence, that you have done that work
[2:05:32] in their life. Grant it, Lord, we pray
[2:05:35] as we commit these things into your
[2:05:37] hands for your glory in Jesus name.
[2:05:41] Amen. God bless you saints. You're
[2:05:43] dismissing the fear of the Lord.
[2:05:44] Remember the service this weekend. Sing
[2:05:47] us happy, brother Harry.

[2:13:16] I'll never
[2:13:19] know
[2:13:21] how much it cost
[2:13:25] to see my sin
[2:13:29] upon
[2:13:31] that cross.
[2:13:34] [Music]
[2:13:36] But here I am to worship.
[2:13:40] Here I am to bow down. Here I am the
[2:13:47] same.
[2:13:48] You are my God. Oh, you're all together
[2:13:55] now.
[2:13:57] All together
[2:13:59] worthy.
[2:14:04] You're wonderful
[2:14:06] to me.
[2:14:10] Here I am to worship.
[2:14:14] And here I am to bow out. Here I am to
[2:14:20] say that you're my God.
