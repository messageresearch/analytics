then you're released from that amen and then we come under the message of the hour and find out it's as though we never done it to begin with sir that make you want to shout right there aren't you glad to be a Christian friends where would we be without this message I was looking you know yesterday you I know you all seen the news and all the things that's happened and I was thinking how sad it is that what a nation becomes when it turns away from its God but I'm so glad that even though we live in a nation that no longer trusts in God they don't want God in the government they don't want him in our schools they wanton don't want him in our lives but I'm so glad this morning that I'm gathered here with a group of people that we still want him we still need him aren't you glad this morning amen if you have your Bibles turn with us to the Book of Psalms I want to read from Psalms 150: 6 we have just a simple little thought this morning but we trust it to be a blessing to you and uh we got two or three baptisms after service this morning so we thank the Lord for that and just looking for a great day in the Lord do you love him this morning do you enjoy this thinging wasn't it wonderful Wonder God's so good to us thank you Lord Psalms 150: 6 very familiar scripture to us all the Bible says this says let everything that hath breath praise the Lord Praise ye the Lord amen let's bow our heads you say that's not much scripture but I think it's enough yeah Heavenly Father we just come before you today and we are so grateful in our hearts Lord for all that you've done for us and given us Lord we thank you dear God for this opportunity that we can gather here under the shelter of your wings Lord knowing that you have all things in control you never leave us nor forsake us and as the songs have said this morning Lord that no matter what trials we face in Life or what difficulties or situations none them's greater than you Lord so father we just put our trust in you you see the needs today lord of the prayer request God those that we've got on our phone all around the world I pray Lord in the name of Jesus may your spirit move for each need Lord each one on our prayer list dear God I pray Lord may you just do something wonderful for them bless those that are traveling today down in the meetings at brother David's the back to school meetings the different ones we traveling we ask God you'd be with them bring them safely back home bless this service today Lord receive honor Glory unto thyself that that when we leave this building may we say did not our hearts burn within us because you met with us Lord and we know according to the Bible that you are a consuming fire so Lord we commit these things into your hands this morning for your glory for we ask it in Jesus name and the bride says amen amen God bless you you may be seated now you know the word praise is mentioned 265 times in the Bible and the definition for praise it says praise refers to lifting God up it is a joyful recounting of what God has done for us praise and thanksgiving go hand in hand as thank God and offer appreciation for who he is praise is acknowledgement of all the wonderful righteous Deeds of God he is worthy of Our Praise amen amen and I say this morning that's true friends we don't serve a dead God we don't serve a god of wood we don't serve a god of someone's imagination but we serve the Living God today amen who can do all things who can do great things who has never forgot one promise that he's made and the prophet of God said he can't make a promise that he's not able to keep this morning that's the god that we serve today no matter what the world does no matter the condition of the world no matter what Satan tries to do we serve a God who can not fail amen amen the Bible says this or the prophet says this in the message of pma's vision he said have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of the things that are in the world they go to their ball games their sporting events and their dances they dinner they enter into the spirit of it they don't sit there like a Wallflower or old dried up sticks they enter right into the fill of things and become a part of things and let me say this morning that's my desire I just don't want to come to church and be a a spectator but I want to come and be a participator I just don't want to come and see what's happening I want to come because I am what's happening is that all right this morning I want to come and get into the spirit of things I want to be a part of things that when I leave here I can say I sweated as much as the preacher I Ain mad as much as the preacher I got involved as much as the preacher because I want to be a part of it amen like the men that come to church one time he was deaf and and he was Dumb and they asked him in Braille he was blind and he he couldn't hear they said why do you even come to church why do you even bring your Bible and he answered back he said because I want the devil to know whose side that I'm on and when I leave this building this morning I want the devil to know whose side that I am on Amen I want even to know that I lift my voice to praise my God to let my God know I thank you for healing me I thank you for saving me I thank you for all that you've done for me amen the world goes to ball games they scream and they shout and they jump and they beat each other on the head and they do c wheels and it's sad to say but Christians It Go the ball games will act the same way and then come to church and set like they're dead but I say if you can do it at a ball game you really ought to be able to do it in church amen amen amen they enter right into the fill of things and they became a part of it oh God let me become a part of it he said but oh how they hate the Christians think of that for getting into the Spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics Holy Rollers there is nothing that they won't do to show their disapproval right their hatred and there's nothing that they won't do to show their hatred and their disapproval so you know we're living in a time of political correctness when everybody wants to be politically correct so you know if us getting into the spirit of worship and US praising God and us lifting up our voices and and that offends them maybe we should just settle down just look at one another and Nod our head every once in a while and so they'll still know we're alive sir you think that's what we are to do well here's what the prophet said to do okay when they show their hatred and their disapproval here's what the prophet said to do he said ignore it ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from on so what are we supposed to do just go on and get into the spirit of worship our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its pleasure both Christians and the world are human both have emotions amen oh yes you do amen you may sit dead in church but you hit your big toe going to bed you do have emotions oh yeah you do I know that's true amen both have emotions the difference is the Christian's heart and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh that's right and let me say that's what I I'm I'm talking about this morning I'm not talking about something that satisfies the flesh I'm not talking about something that'll goore of the flesh I'm not talking about something that just works on my emotions you say well what are you talking about I'm talking about just loving to love God just to thank him and love him and rejoice because there is no God like our god oh you say let me tell you the devil's going to try to tell you that you're going to get into the flesh but listen to me I ain't worried about getting in the flesh I want to get out of it amen oh you know you're just going to get into the flesh you're just going to get caught up you're just going to be a fanatic or if you praise God before there's one sign of healing then you're lying because you're really still sick Bo let me tell the devil this morning he's the liar and whether I have a symptom or whether I don't have a symptom it has nothing to do with my healing I'm not healed because I feel like it I'm not saved because I feel like it come on somebody but I am saved according to God's word this morning amen well if you testify if you praise God for your healing you still got symptoms you're lying no that's just the devil trying to dampen down your spirit that's trying the devil just trying to cool you off but I say just go on and get into the spirit of worship just start praising God for all that he's done for you oh let me be like Joshua who March through on the walls of Jericho before one rock ever fell out of that wall they were shouting the victory shouting the victory why because he was looking at the Unseen it was a promise that God made am well the wall was so thick and the wall was so high it don't matter how thick it is it don't matter how high it is if God has promised the victory you get the victory amen he wasn't looking at the walls he was looking at the promise that God made oh I say this morning how much can you walk around a wheelchair how much can you walk around a can how much can you walk around cancer how much can you walk around diabetes come on somebody how much can you walk around that besetting sin shouting the victory without one evidence but solely based upon the word of God Amen walking around shouting the victory because God gave the promise and his promise cannot fail amen when you see him who is invisible when that pulsating comes into your heart and it begins to pulsate I am the Lord who heals all thy diseases how many diseases how many then when the doctor says it's incurable who's right who's wrong God's always right amen I'm the Lord who heals all thy diseases when you can see that not with the eyes of your head but with the eyes of your heart when you look with the eyes of your heart everything else just weakens away but you've got to get into the spirit of the word if you don't get into the spirit of the word you don't see nothing you'll see your symptoms you'll see your problems but if if you can get into the spirit of the word the spirit that wrote that word if you can get into that Spirit it will reveal that word that's wrote to you Elijah the prophet said he couldn't see something till he got into the spirit amen he said play me a minstral and they played him a minstral and he got into the spirit and he began to prophesy tomorrow about this time the valley will be full of water amen amen he was seeing Through The Eyes of a spirit he got into the spirit and he be to prophesy and what happened the next day they dug the ditches the valley was full of water just like the prophecy said amen you have to get into the spirit before you can see it blind barus was physically blind yet he seen his healing before he ever got to Jesus think about that he was physically blind yet he saw his healing before he ever got to Jesus the Bible said rais it up he cast off his robe and went to Jesus before he could ever see with his physical eyes but he was already seeing with Hallelujah with the eyes of his heart that was saying he's the Lamb of God he's the one to open your eyes Hallelujah when you get into the spirit of the word you don't see the storm you just see the sun amen I can rejoice in my healing because the word says I'm Healed I can rejoice in my Deliverance because the word says I'm delivered I can rejoice in the Rapture oh God because the word says I already have am amen amen well brother darl this is some kind of new religion this a Brides Revival they've been talking about the last year or so and all the shouting and screaming oh no friend oh no this woman said one time to brother Brandon said Billy I understand you got some kind of new religion he said what kind is that she said you know them people that shout and go on like that I said a new kind I said well that's the only kind that's the oldest religion there is she said why we never used to hear about that depends on what you're listening to I guess I said uh what about God spoke to job one day he said job where was you when I laid the foundations of the world tell me what they were fasting on to said when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy a 100 million years before the world was ever formed they had a shouting religion amen then you talk about something new well it's the oldest there is the only kind there really is yeah it's the oldfashioned heartfelt sky blue s skin sin killing religion oh it don't white wash you it washes you white From the Inside Out yes it does it makes you do things you don't ever think you would ever do Oh Glory to God look at Mary she didn't wait till she was positive she was going to have this child she didn't wait till she felt the baby kick before she said thing about it she started testifying right away amen telling people she's going to have this baby when there's no sign yet but H say this morning God give us some marriage like that God give us some people like that without one evidence they'll stand and begin to give God praise they'll begin to thank you for I'm telling you when you begin to do that mountains begin to move rocks begin to roll off of M us God will honor Hallelujah God will come to receive your praise amen hallelujah take God as his word start rejoicing it's going to happen it's going to happen it's going to happen it's going to happen how do you know God said so amen amen amen I believe if every patient in this building right now would accept it upon the grounds of God's word and believe it and start testifying and praising God for your healing the meeting wouldn't close with one crippled person in here thank you Lord amen what a powerful quote amen if every person would just start believing start testifying and start praising God Amen the prophet said I believe there wouldn't be one feeble person Among Us when this meeting come to a close why because God is under obligation to answer his word hallelujah and I say to you this morning why not us why not now somebody's going to fulfill this quote somebody's going to live this message I say why not us are we Believers are we the children of God did he give us the promise then what are we worried about well the doctor said this and the doctor said that but they can't be wrong but God's word is always right why not us why not now David was anointed by a great prophet Samuel to be king God sent a prophet with a message to David to tell David who he was and what he was going to do don't that sound kind of familiar God sent a prophet messenger with the message to tell David who he was and what he was going to do oh God now David I was looking I never realized I just got to thinking I was looking but most Scholars say David was between the ages of 10 and 15 year old when Samuel anointed him it was just a kid now this kid David as brother Jeremy sang about a youth a boy stands before a Giant Goliath who is 9 foot 9 in tall and Saul tells David he said you're just a youth his own is old leadership trying to discourage him from standing on what God told him on sa said look look look just calm down you you're just a youth you're you're a kid and this man here he's been a warrior since do you see his [Music] trophies he's a champion he ain't just a fighter he's a champion he's got trophies and he's been a warrior since his Youth and you are just a youth but the giant that stood before David didn't see the god that stood behind him if he did if he did Goliath would have been on his knees for God do said to David you would reign as king and David said how can I die by the hand of a giant as a boy and still reign as a king right it's impossible you can't do both so what did David do he didn't look at the fear he didn't look at the size he didn't look at the ability he didn't look at the warrior he didn't look at the situation he looked at God's word that God sent a prophet with a message to tell me I would reign as king and God has sent a prophet with a message to tell you you are the bride of Christ oh God how simple but how great amen so what did David do he took God at his word as far as the word was concerned Goliath was defeated before the battle ever started David said the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him I am help therefore my heart greatly rejoice and with my song and with my song I will praise Him David also said I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies I will call upon my God who is worthy Hallelujah to be praised and so shall I be saved from my enemies amen well I tell you brother darl if I was wealthy I'd praise God if I had no worries I'd praise God if I was healthy I'd praise God well those are all good things to praise God for I'm sure amen every one of those is a good reason to give God praise but the only problem with that is the Bible says let everything that hath breath praise you the Lord then what does that tell me let the sad man yes sir let the happy man let the poor man well it get too many amens out of that let the rich man let the sick man let the Healthy Man let the man on the mountain let the man in the valley let everything young and old male and female let everything that have breath regardless of the condition you find yourself in let everything praise ye the [Applause] Lord Brother darl is there any scripture in the Bible that gives me a right not to praise God well I'm glad you asked that because there is if you want an excuse not to praise God there is a scripture for it you believe me so if you don't want to praise God I do have an excuse for you you'll find it in Psalms 115 verse 17 and the Bible says the dead praise not the Lord okay neither do any that go down in silence amen so if you ain't breathing this morning you're excused but if you're breathing right and you want to obey God I don't feel he never said did you feel it if you've got breath the Bible said praise ye the Lord let me tell you this morning I've come for one purpose I ain't come to complain I didn't come to find fault I didn't come to sleep I didn't come to sit on the Pew but I come for one purpose this morning like those mag who said they traveled over two years they went over mountains they went through valleys they took the chance of being robbed but they said we have seen his star and we have come to worship Him and I've come for one purpose this morning not to be seen not to be heard but to give my God praise Hallelujah I don't know what you came to do this morning but I came to praise the Lord the Bible says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord all the Earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praises whatever State you find yourself in right now just start worshiping God just give him praise amen what do you reckon will happen why don't you try and see think about it how can we scream and shout one surface and set dead the next when it's the same God bringing the same word just to a different vessel there's something wrong with that I'm sorry because it don't matter where I'm at if the word is the word I can amen it if the word is come on somebody I can get into the spirit of Praise I can get into the spirit of worship no matter you your her brother Dar if you had you don't know my troubles you don't know my P you don't know what I'm

I know when I speak the name of Jesus I am speaking an excellent name and when I speak the name of Jesus over you it's an excellent name for At The Mention Of that great name the Dead live the blind SE the lost her fath and the bound are set free the Bible said let everything that have breath praise ye the Lord he said brother brother darl but I'm sick I've got this problem look listen I'm not belittle your problem don't misunderstand me we have real problems we do real pain I Mayan not know a lot in life but I do know what pain is I know what back pain is it's terrible when you have to pray to get out of the car to pump gas it hurts and I'm not belittling that you said Brother D I'm sick I've got this problem and I'm not belittle that but I want you to understand that every sick Christian while sick yet we have a thousand times more to be happy about over the most cheerful sinner you see they can have they can have Ferraris they can have Mansions they can have all kinds of money they can have a summer home and a winter home they can have all that and you may be poor and you may have pain and you may have sorrow and you may have trouble but there's one thing we've got that they don't have we've got a [Applause] future Hallelujah this is not my home I'm just passing through amen amen we serve the God of all power I may have pay I may have sorrow I may have trials I may have trouble but I've got a God that's greater I got a God who loves me who saved me he predestinated me he wrote my name in his book before the foundation of the world and promis me brother Jackie he promised us he'd never leave us nor would he forsake us he didn't say I'll just be with you when you're young and you're on fire and you're traveling all over the world preaching brother Jackie God didn't just say I'll be with with you then but he said when you get old and you can't go as much as you used to he said I'll still be with you brother [Applause] Jackie hallelujah hallelujah Jeremiah says Heal Me Oh Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise amen amen if I'm going to use my breath let me use it to praise him not talk about my problems but let me use it to exalt him to lift up his name for the Bible said praise ye the Lord I will praise the Lord with my whole heart in the Assembly of the upright and in the congregation I will praise the Lord amen listen I don't care how you feeling right now just shout hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God glory to God there is no God like our God there is no God God hallelujah hallelujah amen violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but Thou shalt call thy City walls of Salvation and thy Gates praise Gates of Praise You See Gates do two things Gates let things in and Gates keep things out and he said your Gates shall be called Praise so what is g it's an entrance it's an entrance when it seems you're all alone just praise His name when you feel you can't go on just raise your hands and say greater is he that's in me that's right than he that's in the world and you can praise you're heard away if you'll just praise His name let your praise be an entrance into his presence for the Bible said he inhabits the praise of Israel God inhabits the praise of his people and when we begin to praise him it is a gate in into his presence Hallelujah with your backs against the wall and it seems there's no way through and Satan's got you cut off I want you to know this morning you've got a gate yes a gate of praise and you can hang that gate and step through into his presence amen amen it's getting into the spirit that's like sometimes you know people they'll pray almost to their breakthrough and then they stop but if you'll just press on and get into the spirit it becomes so different when you pray amen a lot of times I put on soft music because it creates an atmosphere and it's all about getting into to that atmosphere it's a gate that you can step through amen amen you say you got look at Paul and Silas they were in prison they were cold hungry sore beaten blooded chained amen come on and Silas might have said pa what are we going to do and Paul you know he looked around he might have said something you know this looks like a good place to have church because you see whether you're on a mountain or whether you're in a prison a Son of God can worship God anywhere the Bible says to appoint unto them that mourn and Zion to give them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called the Trees of Righteousness that the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified a Garment of Praise for heaviness and here they are cold hungry beaten blooded and Paul might have said give me a seed for Christ I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them about three cells down you know some prisoner with the Grumps that hey don't you know we're in prison don't you know we've got problems cut that out yeah we got to be sorrowful a little bit we got to be moreful a little bit s m said my goodness Bo we offended that guy what do you think we ought to do Paul probably said sing louder how one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm and God up in heaven looking over the banister of time said wormwood come here here look right down there you see that where with s what is that God said that's Paul and that's Silas and one would say what are they doing God said look they're cold they're hungry they're beaten they're blooded they're bruised they're rejected they're in jail and they're chained would said my God what are they doing and God said they're having church now there's just something about family Harmony I mean that's what they tell me I don't even know what Harmony is but that's what they tell me and so you know Silas being a little whiny come on he probably saying tener Paul being the church age messenger you know he probably sang Lead and worwood said to God what are you going to do and God said you know I'm enjoying that so much I think I'll just go down sing Bas and God came down God came down to receive their praise and that great thunderous voice it began to shake and the chain came off and the doors came come on somebody they begin to praise God oh Hallelujah in prison change and bleeding Stripes Paul and let prayed that night and in their pain begin to sing their chains were loosed and they were free I bless your name I bless your name I give you honor I give you praise you are the life the truth the way I bless your name I bless your name some Midnight Hour if you should find you're in a prison in your mind Reach Out In Praise defy those chainsen and they will fall in Jesus name we bless your name we bless your name several year ago I was in a meeting as a young girl was a cutter she had scars all over her arms was in this meeting and she wanted to worship God the spirit of God was moving in the congregation I believe it was a youth camp if I remember right and she said Lord I Want To Worship you but I'm ashamed of these scars and she said a voice spoke to her and said raise your arms and give me praised and the sister testified that when she raised her arms to worship God the scars came off of her arms that's the God we Ser you may be sitting here with scars in your life but praise to our God it can erase the Scars come on somebody there is nothing that our God Can Do Not only is a gate for entrance it is also a gate of Defense it keeps things out out ain't that something that praise can actually keep things out so wouldn't it make sense if praise could keep the devil out that he would try to discourage you from praising God come on and how many times do we fall for that come on now but a gate of Praise is actually a gate of Defense now listen to this I know you think I'm crazy but listen to this let's say thanks be to God you believe you believe me to be a servant You Must Believe now Sister cuz you realize your condition you've got cancer and you're not going to live long unless God touches you isn't that right come here my sister kind heavenly father let thy mercies be shown un the woman may she go from here ton not normally and well I condemn this enemy with this church and these believing people in the name of Jesus Christ may it leave her amen amen then he says this yes God bless you Sister go happy now rejoicing thanking God just believe it's gone from you now it's gone from you now but when it goes out it'll come back again but if you just keep thanking the lord if you just keep saying Thank You Lord if you just keep on rejoicing it can't come back then you see you're giving God praise it'll go out but it will try to come back but if it finds you thanking God if it finds you giving God praise it can't come back then so your praise is a defense gate that'll keep the enemy from coming back thank you Lord your your praise to God is a defense against s and think about it how it must please God that while we are yet in trouble we begin to give him praise the Bible said oh let not the oppressed return to shame let the poor and the needy praise thy name not wait till we're fully recovered not wait till we're fully delivered why we're yet poor why we're yet in need we can still call on his name we can still exalt him we can still give God praise we can praise him in the morning we can Praise Him in the noon time we can Praise Him in the evening time we can Praise Him in the car we can Praise Him in the closet we can Praise Him in church we can praise him at work come on [Applause] somebody think about it just praise him well I want to wait till the condition's just right why just start praising him listen what what is Satan going to do to a man that every time he afflicts him that man Praises God that much more Satan hits you with a punch and knocks you into the second row and you get up and start praising Jesus he said this man's lost his mind he has he's got the mind of God think about that every time he hits you with trouble you praise God that much more oh God don't look at your symptoms look to your god look to God if you look at your symptoms that's all you'll ever see if you look to the CT scan that's all you'll ever see but just look to God just look to God just start praising him he'll bring that child in just start praising he'll bring that wife in just start praising him but Satan so wants us to see the symptoms and I'm telling you they can be really real yes they can but I think about symptoms Jonah comes to my mind now if there's anybody that ever had symptoms it was Jonah this man was swallowed by a fish anybody here ever been swallowed by a fish Jonah was swallowed by fish and can you imagine here he is in the belly of a great fish first of all can you imagine the smell and second of all the prophet said when a fish eats and its belly's full it goes right to the bottom of the ocean and lays there so here was a man who was thrown overboard by the men he was on the boat with into the ocean in a storm and a fish swallows him and goes to the bottom of the ocean thought woo well that's pretty good I wouldn't mind having another one of them can you imagine the smell and not only that everywhere he looked was Well's belly he didn't even have a cell phone Amen in the belly of a great fish but did he quit did he collapse in despair no Jonah said I cried by reason of my Affliction unto the Lord amen I wonder sometimes if God don't allow things to come so we'll cry out to him I Cried unto the Lord by the reason of my afflictions and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou heardest my voice if God can hear Jonah cry out of the belly of a well in the bottom of the ocean can't he hear your cry seting in the house of God but you see the symptoms never silenced Jonah's voice right in the midst of his trial he started praising God Jonah said in 2:9 I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord right in the midst of the greatest difficult or trial of his life Jonah began to lift his voice to God he begin to cry out to God he begin to acknowledge the god of Salvation he begin to acknowledge God in his praise yes sir and that great fish at the bottom of the ocean with a belly full of a 6' 200 lb man just said there there floating along you know oh man that was so good I wouldn't have another one of them man I am so full and Jonah begins to cry out to God and when Jonah begins to cry out to God all of a sudden that that great fish just sitting there just a Jonah begins to cry out w f said oh my god I've swallowed a Holy [Applause] Roller I got to get rid of this guy I got to get that we don't want none of that shouting tongue talking around the ear I got to get rid of [Laughter] him Hallelujah and the Bible said that God calls that great fish to vomit Jonah up on dry ground amen hallelujah if praise can deliver you from the belly of a great fish cannot it deliver you from gloom and doom if praise can deliver a man from the belly of a fish in the bottom of the ocean cannot it take care of that fear and that Gloom and that doom and that oppression and that depression and that awful yucky feeling what am I going just hang your gate of Praise B said just go on the road rejoicing just start praising God and saying thank you dear God and all that gloomy feeling will be gone just go on the road just start praising God just start thanking God and all that gloomy feeling will be gone amen God likes to be worshiped and when you worship Him it isn't just actually singing a song you know when people sing I like someone that sings under the anointing don't you people's got beautiful voices but they're you know they're they're performers and you hear what I'm saying someone that gets you I don't care if they can't carry a tun in a bucket they can bring God on the scene because they're not singing for entertainment they're singing from their soul they're singing to their God and God likes to be worshiped it isn't exactly singing a song as we do but it's singing in the spirit of worship then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back God likes to be worshiped by his children the prophet did you want scripture the people are supposed to come to the house of God for one purpose that's to worship and to sing songs and to worship God that's the way God expects it he doesn't expect us to come into the house of God to talk about something else or talk about one another or talk about what we got to do through the week he expects us to come to worship him it is a house of worship and he expects us to come and worship him but listen I'm not talking so much about this beautiful house I'm talking about this house amen God wants this house God wants this house God expects this house to worship Him amen amen is this okay Brothers come to the instrument the Bible says this praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name and dance let them sing praises un him with timberl and harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouth and the two-edged sword in their hand God says Just Praise me while you cut that devil Hallelujah take the sword cut the devil and give me praise while you're doing it amen hallelujah let the high praises of God be in their mouth and the two-edged sword in their hand praise ye the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary Praise Him in the firment of his power praise him for his mighty acts Praise Him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the Sutter in heart praise him with the timble in dance praise him with string instruments and organs Praise Him upon the loud symbols Praise Him upon the high sounding symbols let everything let

unto the Lord as long as I live I will sing praise to my God while I have my being Hallelujah that be my testimony let that be my testimony that as long as I've got breath the rocks will never cryed as long as I'm in this beinged God will know praise the Lord and I love him and I appreciate him for all he's done for me Amen in the good times in the bad times in the happy times in the sad times listen friends I've seen God do great things and I've been through great trials I've been the times when I didn't know what to do I've been in times in a hospital room when I've laid my head against the wall and cried out to God because I didn't know what to do and I've been on a mountain when I've seen him Open the Eyes of my daughter and caused her to get out of a wheelchair I've seen my god do great things but whether I was in the hospital room or whether I was seeing God do a great thing he was still my God stand your feet Prophet says this I thought this was so good the prophet says hallelujah he says Praise Him raise your hand hands forget where you're at just know that you're around him and his goodness and His glory and his power and his Mercy endures forever [Music] amen just forget where you're at just know that you're around him and really ain't that all that matters is that he's here he's here and just acknowledge his presence and start accepting it and believing it and testifying and praising God I believe there wouldn't be a feeble one Among Us for God is obligated to answer his word amen God will keep his promise yes he will amen oh bless the name of the Lord bless the name of the Lord his Mercy endures forever amen do you love him this morning you love him this morning oh isn't it wonderful that we're not worshiping a dead God or a dumb God or a God that we made with their hands but we worship The God Who made us with his hands aren't you glad this morning the Bible said you are fearfully and wonderfully made amen many year ago I don't think I've ever shared this before when I first come a Christian I got into a battle of whether there was a God or not you say that's silly well I know it is but at the time it was real it was a real battle I wrestled for days I wept till I couldn't hardly weep anymore because this voice was telling me that it was no God that I didn't get anything it just my imagination and I opened a window about the third day I opened the window and you know what I heard I heard a bird singing and a voice spoke to me he said who is that bird singing to amen and I fell on my knees and I said there is a God let
