[35:56] What a great great privilege it is to be
[36:01] word believers.
[36:04] Not just doctrinal believers and
[36:06] theological believers, but word
[36:09] believers.
[36:11] Because remember, it wasn't a doctrine
[36:12] that died for
[36:15] you. It was not theology that died for
[36:19] you. It was a person.
[36:22] A doctrine isn't coming for you. The
[36:25] rapture is not a doctrine. It's more
[36:27] than a
[36:29] doctrine. He's a
[36:31] person. Praise God. Trust y'all are
[36:34] doing well tonight.
[36:36] Happy to be in the house of the Lord.
[36:39] Amen. It's a great privilege for us to
[36:40] be gathered together, isn't it? Thank
[36:43] God. Had some good meetings down at
[36:45] brother David's. And brother Daryl did
[36:46] an awesome job. And that other guy,
[36:49] y'all know what I think about him. So,
[36:51] brother Daryl really good. The presence
[36:53] of the Lord was there. So wonderful. And
[36:56] saints from different places and pulling
[36:58] on and just had a wonderful time
[37:01] together. Let's turn tonight if you
[37:03] would to um Genesis 24:21.
[37:09] to a story that is thousands of years
[37:12] old, but it's being
[37:15] relived right here
[37:18] tonight. Genesis
[37:21] 24:21. It's being relived all over the
[37:24] world. People are hearing a
[37:27] call. Some will
[37:30] accept, some will
[37:32] reject. Some will say, "I will
[37:36] go." Others will
[37:38] say I want to think about it and others
[37:42] will say I'm definitely not going. I am
[37:47] not part of
[37:49] that. So I guess it boils down to which
[37:52] category are we?
[37:55] Which category are you? As for me in my
[37:58] house, I will go.
[38:01] I will
[38:02] go. Genesis
[38:05] 24:21. And the man wondering at her held
[38:08] his peace to what whether the Lord had
[38:11] made his journey prosperous or
[38:14] not. And it came to pass as the camels
[38:17] had done drinking. And the man had took
[38:20] a golden earring and half his shekele
[38:23] weight and two bracelets for her hands
[38:26] of 10 shekels weight of gold. Now I'll
[38:29] remind you that in bestowing the
[38:32] jewelry, Elizer claimed to Rebecc
[38:34] Rebecca for
[38:36] Isaac. In accepting the jewelry,
[38:41] allowing him to touch
[38:45] her. He touched her wrist and her face.
[38:50] Then she was sending the message to him.
[38:52] She was willing to
[38:55] proceed. Then he proceeded. Verse
[38:58] 23. And said, "Whose daughter art thou?
[39:01] Tell me, I pray thee. Is there a room in
[39:03] thy father's house for us to lodge in?"
[39:05] And she said unto him, "I am the
[39:07] daughter of Bethule, the son of Mila,
[39:10] which she bare unto
[39:12] Nahor." She said, "Moreover, unto him,
[39:15] we have both straw and proender enough,
[39:18] and room to lodge in." And the man bowed
[39:22] down his head and worshiped the Lord.
[39:27] How many to be remembered tonight as we
[39:29] pray? Myself as
[39:31] well. Lord Jesus, we count it such a
[39:34] great honor and a privilege once again,
[39:36] Lord, that we could be gathered together
[39:38] here in this place that we have built
[39:42] and dedicated and consecrated to you.
[39:45] And Lord, we'll have to say there's not
[39:48] one time so far in the couple of years,
[39:51] a little over two years now that we've
[39:53] been meeting here. There's not one time
[39:57] that you have not met with us. Whether
[40:00] it was for a Wednesday night service or
[40:02] a Sunday morning or question answers for
[40:05] the youth or if it was a funeral and
[40:08] we've had multiple of those as well. And
[40:11] there's not been one time that you have
[40:14] not come. So, Father, it leads us to
[40:17] believe that tonight will not be an
[40:20] exception because we know that you've
[40:23] told us if we're gathered together in
[40:25] your name, if there be two or three of
[40:28] us, then you will be in our midst. So,
[40:32] Father, we come with
[40:34] expectation believing that you would.
[40:36] It's not just another Wednesday night
[40:37] service and we'll sing a little and
[40:40] we'll see how the preaching goes. But
[40:42] Lord, to me, this is another opportunity
[40:44] for you to change lives, for you to heal
[40:48] the sick, for you to encourage those
[40:50] that are down, filled with the Holy
[40:52] Ghost. Whatever you do, Lord, we know
[40:55] it'll be great, marvelous. So, we open
[40:58] our hearts to you tonight, Father, and
[41:00] we ask you in the name of Jesus that
[41:02] you'd take the service, speak through me
[41:04] tonight to your children. And I pray in
[41:07] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you saints.
[41:10] You may be seated.
[41:17] Now, unlike you and I, whenever we get
[41:20] ready to take a journey between
[41:24] 450 and 500
[41:27] miles, we either fly, we will take our
[41:31] vehicle, or if it's from one train city
[41:34] to another train city, you might take a
[41:36] train. Eleaser did not have a car.
[41:41] He did not fly in and out. He did not
[41:44] have a fastm moving train or a bus. He
[41:49] had a camel train. So, he's had plenty
[41:53] of time on this journey to be praying,
[41:57] seeking God. But now, remember, he's got
[42:00] to turn right back around now and go
[42:02] back the same way that he came from to
[42:06] find his master. Now hopefully he's
[42:11] believing that God is going to give him
[42:14] an answer not only to his prayers but
[42:17] also to the request of his master
[42:20] Abraham and of course for his son Isaac.
[42:24] So the man is pondering again we'll look
[42:27] at verse 21. And the man wondering at
[42:30] her, not at God, not at the angels, am I
[42:34] at the right well? Am I in the right
[42:37] city? Am I in the right country? He's
[42:40] focusing on her. Now, he's looking to
[42:44] see, is she the proper one for my master
[42:49] Isaac? Now, this is an awesome
[42:51] responsibility for a father that has
[42:54] daughters, especially in that in that
[42:57] situation, more so than a father having
[42:59] a son. But when a father is asked by a
[43:02] young man, can I marry your daughter?
[43:06] And that father wants to pray, he wants
[43:08] to be so right before God before he
[43:12] says, yes, yes, you you can have her to
[43:15] be your wife. because he like many of us
[43:19] no doubt has seen girls that would marry
[43:22] a boy, maybe even be in church and would
[43:25] be there for a while and turn out to be
[43:27] totally different than what he appeared
[43:30] to be when he asked to marry that that
[43:32] father's daughter. So the father enters
[43:35] into it with a great awesome
[43:38] responsibility. But here we have not a
[43:41] blood tie. We have not a blood relation.
[43:45] So it's not a father looking toward his
[43:48] son's wife or a father looking toward
[43:51] the right type of bride. It is a
[43:54] servant. A servant which his entire
[43:58] reputation he's been faithful to Abraham
[44:01] all of these years. You're talking about
[44:04] a rapport that this man had. There is
[44:07] not one mark that I have ever found in
[44:11] the old or new testament or in any
[44:15] history that I have searched about this
[44:18] man. I have not found one thing about
[44:22] this man that he was a ladies man, that
[44:26] he was out for riches, that he was out
[44:29] for fame, that he was all all about
[44:33] people making over him and thinking he
[44:35] was so great. I've not found one thing
[44:38] about this man. Are you talking about
[44:41] quite a reputation for a man to have,
[44:44] especially a man in the Old Testament
[44:46] without the Holy Ghost? So this man had
[44:49] quite a reputation. So whenever he's
[44:53] watching every move now, he himself
[44:55] praying, feeling to go certain ways,
[44:58] feeling to ask certain things, and then
[45:00] let her respond accordingly. So, as the
[45:03] camels had done drinking, verse 22, the
[45:06] man took the golden earring, half a
[45:08] shekele, and then he put it on her. Now,
[45:10] I want you to notice then each step that
[45:13] he does, he's waiting for her response
[45:16] or her reply or sometimes even an action
[45:20] that it can be an action, a reaction to
[45:24] an action. So then he asks, well, whose
[45:26] daughter are you? Now, that within
[45:28] itself is going to be important. She's
[45:31] going to reply, "Well, I'm a church of
[45:33] God. I'm a Baptist. I'm a Methodist. I'm
[45:35] a Presbyterian." What's she going to
[45:37] say? Who's her mother? Who's her father?
[45:40] Verse 25. Then she also identifies that
[45:44] her family is a family that has sub
[45:49] substantial position in the community
[45:52] that they have a place by which they can
[45:55] put him up. All of this is important.
[45:57] When you read the Bible, don't read it
[46:00] with a western understanding. Whenever
[46:02] you uh understand about how it was
[46:05] written, that's why I like to read you
[46:06] sometimes the meanings of the words
[46:08] because it helps you to understand so
[46:10] much of the way that it was written and
[46:12] it was so different. Now in presenting
[46:16] the jewelry, Eleazar is claiming her,
[46:20] but also what he's doing is making known
[46:23] to her the presence of the betroal. P R
[46:28] E S E N Ts, not P R S E N C E. So it is
[46:33] the presence of the betroal. So for a
[46:37] marriage to be arranged, the groom's
[46:41] family must provide a bride price. Now
[46:46] the bride's family will give her also
[46:49] something, but it's not the bride's
[46:52] price. The father will give his daughter
[46:54] something. Some of them chose to keep
[46:57] the price in case the man would divorce
[47:00] her and she would have something that
[47:02] she could fall back on. It was called
[47:04] the bride's dowy. But now Eleazar has
[47:09] brought to her a bride price. Now who's
[47:13] that bride price from? It is from the
[47:16] family of the groom. Now keep in mind
[47:19] that we're talking about the bride of
[47:21] Christ. Now, if we believe that God has
[47:24] sent to us a messenger and a message in
[47:28] the last days, I want to see and judge
[47:32] whether this man was the man sent from
[47:35] God or not by the presence that he gives
[47:39] to us as his followers. And then let us
[47:43] also judge any other men who would say
[47:47] they are the same because we know the
[47:51] man that we follow and believe is God's
[47:53] prophet is certainly not the only man on
[47:56] the earth who would like for us to
[47:58] follow him. For the truth of the matter
[48:01] is there are many, many men that would
[48:04] love your loyalty. They would love for
[48:08] you to be as submissive to them as you
[48:12] are to God's word. And they would love
[48:15] to have your dedication, your
[48:18] consecration to them and what they
[48:21] believe and what they promote as much so
[48:24] as you give to the revealed word of the
[48:27] hour. As a matter of fact, the devil
[48:29] would love to have you on his side.
[48:31] That's right. But I'll just have to tell
[48:33] him he'll have to weep and weep and weep
[48:35] cuz he ain't getting us. We've already
[48:37] been paid for. So notice the bride's
[48:41] family will present to her a dowy.
[48:45] Silver, gold, and also objects that are
[48:50] presented which will have a great value
[48:53] and a great family treasure. And it
[48:57] might not be so much something worth to
[48:59] anybody else, but it will be just a
[49:02] present among the family that'll have a
[49:06] great declared value. Now listen
[49:08] carefully to me tonight. So the number
[49:11] of Abraham's household, the presence
[49:14] given to also not only to Rebecca but
[49:19] also from Abraham's household would come
[49:23] presence to the mother, the father, the
[49:27] brothers and so on. So it's not just the
[49:30] bride that is going to benefit from the
[49:34] gifts of the messenger. Amen. You see,
[49:39] there will be other people that will
[49:42] benefit from the gifts of the messenger,
[49:46] though they will not go back with the
[49:49] messenger to be a part of the bride, but
[49:53] they will benefit such as the assemblies
[49:57] of God who received over a million
[50:01] converts coming out from under the last
[50:03] day ministry of our Eleaser.
[50:08] The church of God of prophecy, the
[50:10] assembly of God, the apostolic, the
[50:14] oneness, many of them benefited by our
[50:19] Eleer coming to the earth. As a matter
[50:23] of fact, revival fires were burning on
[50:26] every hill from the one commission of
[50:29] that one church age
[50:31] messenger. But now watch what God is
[50:35] going to do in a type. it'll be greater
[50:38] in the anotri anotype. So if the
[50:41] messenger comes and he comes with a very
[50:45] limited amount of gifts. So he comes to
[50:49] Rebecca and he gives her a ring from Big
[50:52] Lots and then he he picks up on his
[50:55] journey. He gives her a a little bit of
[50:58] basket of something and it it's got
[51:00] still got the target price on it and it
[51:02] was on sale at that. And then you know
[51:05] then he comes to Laban and he gives him
[51:07] a little and well there's that other big
[51:10] lot thing and come to found out it was
[51:12] BOGO you know buy one get one free. So
[51:15] you know that within itself is speaking
[51:18] the gifts is speaking to the family.
[51:21] They also are reading into this. Do we
[51:25] want our daughter married into this? So
[51:29] if this guy his gifts are only guessing.
[51:32] Somebody stands up and says, "Well, you
[51:35] know what? The Lord shows me here
[51:37] tonight that there's somebody here with
[51:39] a burden on their heart." Yeah. How many
[51:41] of people here they are? That's how many
[51:43] folks, no doubts got burdens on their
[51:45] heart. Well, there's people here tonight
[51:47] that's got problems in their bodies.
[51:49] Yeah, you could about count that from
[51:51] six-month old babies in the age we're
[51:53] living in now. But we are going to be
[51:56] able to judge the wealths of the one who
[52:00] sent him. Now, if you listen to me
[52:02] carefully tonight, you'll be able to
[52:04] judge false prophets from this sermon on
[52:09] in a way that you've never judged them
[52:12] before. Because every true servant of
[52:15] God is a scribe. And he will come and
[52:20] bring from his treasuries things that
[52:23] are old and things that are new. He will
[52:26] be able to withdraw from the antiquities
[52:30] of the divine mercies of God. He will be
[52:33] able to preach about the grace of God,
[52:36] the mercy of God. He will have the
[52:38] supernatural if you send from God. He
[52:41] will have such an assortment of all of
[52:44] these things because those men are
[52:48] representing the wealths of the master
[52:51] that sent them. So, if I was you, now
[52:54] it's just I'm just saying if I was you,
[52:57] I wouldn't I wouldn't pay too much
[52:59] attention to a man that does not have
[53:02] healing, uh, signs, miracles,
[53:05] supernatural, right, discerning the
[53:08] word. I wouldn't follow a man that don't
[53:10] have very much respect for a prophet of
[53:12] God. As a matter of fact, that will have
[53:15] so little respect for him that he would
[53:17] preach his message and never let people
[53:20] know where he come from.
[53:22] Well, come on now. So, you realize that
[53:25] when when true men of God are sent that
[53:28] they are not representing themsel and
[53:31] they're not representing what treasures
[53:34] they have on their own, but they are
[53:37] representing a part of the economy that
[53:40] they say they are ambassadors of. So
[53:44] whenever Eleazar drag out the bracelets
[53:47] and he be to put them on and then he
[53:50] would put the piece upon her forehead
[53:52] and when Laban saw them, remember we
[53:55] looked at it the last time we dealt with
[53:57] this, it was so
[53:59] overwhelming that Laban saw them by his
[54:03] eyes and it so moved Laban because to
[54:08] him it was a great sign of wealth and
[54:13] standing.
[54:14] So, Laban also wanted his portion. Oh
[54:18] yeah, that's Laban for you. So, the
[54:21] presence given to the brother and given
[54:24] to the mother. Now, I'm sure if you I'm
[54:26] sure if you've been reading this in the
[54:28] in the passage of scripture that you've
[54:30] already noted that the father is not
[54:33] mentioned in this situation. So, the
[54:36] gifts, the way they look at them, and
[54:39] they're going to evaluate the engraving
[54:42] on the bracelets, and they're going to
[54:44] be able to know by the times of the day
[54:46] they were living in. So, they would
[54:48] judge them by the hour they were in, and
[54:51] they would be able to look at that and
[54:53] know that the wells that the bride is
[54:57] going to have on is going to typify the
[55:01] master that wants her. Now, that's why
[55:04] that's just one of the many reasons why
[55:07] that the real elect of God, the devil
[55:10] does not have enough wealth to even
[55:14] dress her up in because she deserves
[55:18] gold, silver, jewels, all kinds of
[55:22] beautiful things. The brideg is the type
[55:24] of lady that is deserving of peace that
[55:29] is so phenomenal that it is beyond
[55:32] understanding. She is so uh fulfilling
[55:37] for mercy and of a grace that is so
[55:41] profound and the devil don't have enough
[55:44] riches to even do it. Now, I'm talking
[55:47] about a bride that is so redeemed by the
[55:50] power of God that the Lord Jesus, the
[55:53] only worthy one, looked in the Pergamian
[55:56] church age and said, "You will walk with
[55:59] me in white, for you are worthy." And I
[56:02] hear the prophet say, "The only worthy
[56:04] one was looking at human beings and
[56:08] telling them that they were worthy."
[56:11] Well, I can tell you right now, the
[56:14] devil ain't got enough riches in hell or
[56:17] in anywhere else to ever redeem one of
[56:20] us, much less all of us.
[56:23] The devil ain't rich enough. The devil
[56:26] ain't good enough. He ain't got enough
[56:29] to even Oh my to be able to even answer
[56:33] to what the bride is accumulative of.
[56:37] But the devil does have gifts. Now
[56:40] listen, remember the prophet tells us in
[56:43] harvest time that Satan can hand out
[56:45] gifts by the handfuls. Now remember, he
[56:48] also tells us in the church age book
[56:50] that there will be those in the last
[56:52] days that will come and they will
[56:54] operate gifts with a margin of error in
[56:59] them. A margin of error. Most of the
[57:02] ones that I've dealt with like that when
[57:05] they have the margin of error, most of
[57:07] them will never take correction when you
[57:09] try to tell them, "Brother, you miss
[57:12] this and you miss that and you miss
[57:14] that." They will not do it. Which shows
[57:16] you right there, there's something wrong
[57:19] with their gift. The prophet tells us
[57:21] Christ's spirit. Remember now, Christ
[57:24] spirit is always subject to Christ's
[57:27] teaching. So, anything that makes us
[57:31] rebel against Christ's teaching,
[57:33] remember, is not the Holy Ghost. And the
[57:37] church said, "Well, if you can't say
[57:39] amen, say ouch." Now, notice the spirit
[57:42] of God in me and you will always agree
[57:45] and punctuate that the word is right. So
[57:49] Abraham would not have sent this servant
[57:52] and sent him out into the treasure house
[57:55] and wherever he would have had it in a
[57:57] bank of that day or whatever more and
[57:59] said, "I'll tell you what now. I want
[58:00] you to just get just get pennies. Just
[58:03] get the penny stuff. Don't get that gold
[58:05] stuff and that silver stuff, man. That's
[58:06] high dollar stuff. That cost me a lot of
[58:08] money to get all of that, you know. Just
[58:10] get sticks and brambles and thorns and
[58:12] briars and see maybe y'all can make a
[58:15] little crafts along the way. It's going
[58:16] to be several week journey. So y'all
[58:18] just take a little bit of Elmer's glue
[58:20] and just put a little stuff together.
[58:22] Get a little moss on the side of the
[58:23] tree and and get a little bark and you
[58:25] know just make her some type of country
[58:27] crafts and take a tour and tell her now
[58:29] that these are your gifts. And you ever
[58:31] imagine Rebecca looking at that so what
[58:32] is this man a caveman? What is this guy?
[58:36] So the gifts that the ambassador brings
[58:40] represents the future kingdom of where
[58:43] the bride is going into. Now that's why
[58:46] God does not identify himself by sending
[58:51] false prophets to invite people to his
[58:54] kingdom. Because a false prophet can
[58:57] never declare the riches, nor the
[59:00] depths, nor the mercy, nor the
[59:02] understanding, nor the revelation of God
[59:05] that it requires to be an ambassador
[59:08] from heaven. I wish somebody would say
[59:10] amen tonight. It's the same way with a
[59:13] preacher that just wants to hang around
[59:15] the message and all and he don't want to
[59:17] be a full-blood denomination. He don't
[59:19] want to, you know, belong totally to
[59:21] them, but he don't want to really come
[59:23] into the message either. You know what?
[59:24] Just forget it. That ain't an ambassador
[59:26] from heaven because a real ambassador
[59:29] wants to let you know who he represents.
[59:33] So, he's not ashamed of heaven. He's not
[59:36] ashamed of the cross. He's not ashamed
[59:38] of the gospel. And as Paul told Timothy,
[59:41] "Be thou not ashamed of me, his
[59:43] prisoner." Our church is established
[59:46] upon the facts of the cross, the blood,
[59:49] the mercy, water baptism, baptism in the
[59:52] name of Jesus Christ, baptism of the
[59:55] Holy Ghost, but we're also established
[59:57] upon the fact that we believe God center
[59:59] prophet, and his name is not a secret to
[1:00:02] us.
[1:00:06] Amen.
[1:00:08] Now this is going to portray that the
[1:00:12] identification of this bridegroom. The
[1:00:15] gifts will reflect and create a
[1:00:19] desiraability for this young woman to
[1:00:22] marry him because she hasn't seen his
[1:00:25] face. Now remember, he did not have a
[1:00:28] telegram account. He did not have a a
[1:00:31] Facebook where I where he's going to
[1:00:33] send. Now here's his picture right here.
[1:00:35] Here's his photo. I bought a life size
[1:00:37] and send up a life size there. Here he
[1:00:39] is. His arms is that big. His hands are
[1:00:41] that big. She had no idea what he looked
[1:00:43] like. She didn't know nothing about his
[1:00:45] wealth. But the messenger that was sent
[1:00:48] on his behalf would give her a pretty
[1:00:51] good idea of what the groom was going to
[1:00:54] be like. Now notice again in Genesis
[1:00:58] 24:28. And the damsa ran and told them
[1:01:02] of her mother's house. Notice again the
[1:01:05] father's not mentioned of her mother's
[1:01:07] house these things. And Rebecca had a
[1:01:10] brother and his name was Laban. And
[1:01:13] Laban ran out unto the man unto the
[1:01:16] well. And it came to pass when he saw
[1:01:20] the earrings and the bracelets upon his
[1:01:24] sister's hands. Now notice Rebecca moved
[1:01:27] and acted before she ever saw either of
[1:01:31] those. Notice the difference between her
[1:01:35] and Laban. You see, Rebecca is a faith
[1:01:39] daughter of God. Laban is a sight
[1:01:43] foolish virgin. He is one that goes by
[1:01:47] sight. And that's why a lot of them will
[1:01:49] never give up the way they live. They'll
[1:01:51] never give up the things around them in
[1:01:54] the world because appearances mean so
[1:01:57] much to them. that'd never be able to
[1:02:00] dress the way God's word requires it. To
[1:02:02] me, choosing between a miniskirt in
[1:02:05] hell. I mean, to me, there's no choice
[1:02:07] there really, as are you all. Uh there's
[1:02:09] no there's no choice between a man
[1:02:11] looking like a woman and a wing woman
[1:02:13] looking like a man, and you're choosing
[1:02:15] that over hell. I It don't make no sense
[1:02:18] to me. Whatever my master requires of
[1:02:21] me, I'll do cuz that's the way you feel.
[1:02:24] Now it came to pass when he saw the
[1:02:26] earring and bracelets upon his sister's
[1:02:30] hands, when he heard the words of
[1:02:33] Rebecca his sister, saying, "Thus spake
[1:02:36] the man unto me." Then he came unto the
[1:02:39] man, and behold, he stood by the camels
[1:02:42] at the well. Now, total different, total
[1:02:46] different, complete different scenario
[1:02:48] altogether. And no doubt he's a trained
[1:02:51] man, well trained. and he he was a
[1:02:53] steward in his master's house. So he was
[1:02:57] given money by which he would be able to
[1:02:59] go to the market sort of like Joseph was
[1:03:02] in the Old Testament and he would be
[1:03:04] able to trade and buy and sell. So no
[1:03:06] doubt he had dealt with many crafty
[1:03:08] people and Laban was a very crafty man.
[1:03:11] You don't believe me? Ask Jacob. So he
[1:03:13] was a very crafty uh stealing, sneaking,
[1:03:17] conniving message. I I mean I mean a a
[1:03:20] businessman uh though that's the way
[1:03:22] some of my mares message you know and no
[1:03:24] doubt he picked up on him just like that
[1:03:27] as soon as he spoke and he listened to
[1:03:30] his words as well and he come back and
[1:03:32] boy here he come with a big old long
[1:03:34] stick of butter about that long and a
[1:03:36] big old long butter knife metaphorically
[1:03:39] I'm speaking and he's going to come now
[1:03:41] and butter up this guy because he knows
[1:03:43] what these gifts mean they mean that he
[1:03:48] wants to take his sister back. So what
[1:03:51] he's interested in is the bride price.
[1:03:55] How much can I get out of her? Come on,
[1:03:57] brother. Oh my. Now watch then in verse
[1:04:01] 53. And the servant brought forth
[1:04:05] jewels of silver and jewels of gold and
[1:04:11] raignment and gave them to Rebecca. Now
[1:04:16] notice this is different than what he
[1:04:19] gave her at the well. This is when
[1:04:22] they're now back at her house. He is now
[1:04:25] giving to her the matan. M a t a n. So
[1:04:32] Ezer gave Rebecca special gifts from the
[1:04:36] groom to the bride. Now this is from the
[1:04:40] groom. This is specifically only for
[1:04:43] her. Laban cannot get this. Now, he can
[1:04:47] speak in tongues and he can shout. He
[1:04:49] can run and jump and so on and so on.
[1:04:51] But the bride has certain gifts that
[1:04:53] nobody else has. One of them is
[1:04:56] revelation.
[1:04:58] One of them is understanding. Oh, aren't
[1:05:01] you glad for them special gifts? I tell
[1:05:04] you one thing, I'd rather have that any
[1:05:06] day of the week than all the gifts that
[1:05:09] Pentecost got. Thank God for all them
[1:05:11] gifts. Oh yes. But you know the prophet
[1:05:14] told us we do not take the rapture by
[1:05:17] gifts or by discernment or by prophecy.
[1:05:20] We take the rapture by the word. Yes.
[1:05:24] And and does not the word speak about
[1:05:26] gifts, brother Donnie? It does. But I
[1:05:29] like to go back to what the prophet of
[1:05:31] God taught it because I'm still a
[1:05:32] repeater. I I'm a repeater of the
[1:05:35] message of the hour. I personally don't
[1:05:37] think that we're above and beyond what
[1:05:39] God's prophet taught. I know I'm a
[1:05:41] little behind, you know, for for some
[1:05:43] brothers and all of that, but I am
[1:05:45] behind and and I don't care to admit it.
[1:05:48] I am behind tonight. I'm behind the man
[1:05:52] that God sent. So now, if you want to
[1:05:55] classify me as being behind, but the
[1:05:58] reality is what some of these preachers
[1:06:00] are wanting. They're wanting you and I
[1:06:02] to get from behind the messenger that
[1:06:04] God sent and get behind them. Hey, I
[1:06:08] love Brother Daryl. I love these other
[1:06:10] brothers sharing our church, but I ain't
[1:06:12] going to swallow something down just
[1:06:13] because they get up and say it. And I
[1:06:15] don't want them to do me that way
[1:06:17] either. I don't want you to do me that
[1:06:19] way. Sure. Study the word. Absolutely
[1:06:22] right. I believe I can be proved by the
[1:06:24] word. I can be tested by the word. Come
[1:06:26] on, somebody. And if you can't do that,
[1:06:29] then there's something wrong with where
[1:06:30] you stand. I am behind the messenger of
[1:06:35] Malachi 4. I just happen to believe he
[1:06:38] had been in the presence of Abraham and
[1:06:41] Isaac. He's been to that sixth dimension
[1:06:44] and I haven't. That's right. And I don't
[1:06:46] know anybody here that has. I don't know
[1:06:48] any the rest of the preachers that have.
[1:06:50] Now notice I I found this amazing
[1:06:52] because the very first time the word
[1:06:57] jewels is mentioned in the
[1:07:02] Bible. It's when a man that has a
[1:07:05] message has been sent to get a bride for
[1:07:09] his master. You just read it with me in
[1:07:12] Genesis 24:53.
[1:07:14] So the first time the word jewels is
[1:07:17] mentioned is mentioned when a bride to
[1:07:20] be is getting jewels from a messenger
[1:07:25] with a message.
[1:07:27] Now remember she had no Google. She had
[1:07:31] no way to check out this man's story. So
[1:07:36] one day she down at the well and this
[1:07:38] guy shows up. She has no
[1:07:42] way to trace back his phone to be able
[1:07:46] to see where did he come from. Did he
[1:07:49] even come from the country that he say
[1:07:51] he's from? Did he come from Abraham?
[1:07:54] Now, he knows the name, but how do we
[1:07:56] know that he didn't run into somebody at
[1:07:58] the market somewhere? And they started
[1:08:01] talking about how did she know how? What
[1:08:04] proof?
[1:08:07] This man has a message that is so
[1:08:12] far-fetched and by some what could be
[1:08:14] considered to be hearsay. That's right.
[1:08:18] And she had no way of proving that 16
[1:08:22] men fell off the bridge.
[1:08:25] But she just simply believed if he said
[1:08:28] they fell off, they fell off.
[1:08:33] The children of Israel had no way of
[1:08:35] proving that God came down on the
[1:08:38] mountain and with his finger wrote the
[1:08:41] law of God. But if Moses said he wrote
[1:08:44] it, they believed he wrote it. Come on,
[1:08:47] somebody. So you see, there was
[1:08:50] something about her. She was truly a
[1:08:54] faith daughter of God.
[1:08:57] Now, Eloser now gives Rebecca the
[1:09:01] special gifts from the groom. Now,
[1:09:03] remember, he's only a carrier. He's only
[1:09:06] a carrier. So, he gives her the first
[1:09:09] two ones from the very initiation. Now,
[1:09:12] he unloads to her a special delivery
[1:09:17] package which was toted only by him.
[1:09:21] Now, there were men with him. There was
[1:09:23] no doubt a bunch of men that were with
[1:09:25] him because you would not want to head
[1:09:27] out with all this gold and silver and
[1:09:28] all these jewels and one man by himself.
[1:09:31] Are you kidding me? They would be
[1:09:33] overwhelmed. So there was other foes.
[1:09:38] There was other
[1:09:39] foes of the ministry that were with him.
[1:09:43] Come on, somebody.
[1:09:45] As a matter of fact, I can hear Ellie
[1:09:48] Eer as someone asked him a question.
[1:09:51] Brother Brandham, are you the only one
[1:09:53] that's to preach? Why, brother, sister,
[1:09:56] ever? Who told you that? I'd be a poor
[1:10:00] representative to try to carry that out.
[1:10:02] Every man that's called of God needs to
[1:10:06] get in the pull pit and preach.
[1:10:14] But yet, we are being told you're out of
[1:10:16] the will of God if you don't press play.
[1:10:21] Wow. And where was it? Brother Brandham
[1:10:24] said that because I've searched and
[1:10:26] searched and searched and I cannot find
[1:10:29] that quote. Now, there's a brother
[1:10:31] Brandham saying it, but it's not brother
[1:10:34] William.
[1:10:37] [Applause]
[1:10:38] Come on, time friends. Time to be plain.
[1:10:41] Time to be plain.
[1:10:45] Come on, somebody. So you realize that
[1:10:48] this man has a message that cannot be
[1:10:52] scientifically proven. It cannot be
[1:10:56] proven by the government or the FBI or
[1:10:59] the CIA or whoever else should try to
[1:11:02] prove it by. How was it a
[1:11:05] 16-year-old girl would be able to
[1:11:08] believe this with all of her heart?
[1:11:12] The first time she had ever met this
[1:11:14] man, he didn't stay with him for 40 days
[1:11:17] and 40 nights. And she watched him to
[1:11:20] see how he went was around women or how
[1:11:23] he does this. Did he steal from her her
[1:11:25] mother? Did he steal from her brother?
[1:11:27] What kind of behavior? Let's go to town
[1:11:29] with a guy. Let's see what he does. But
[1:11:31] there was something about his message.
[1:11:36] Notice the Bible doesn't mention his
[1:11:39] appearance. So it must not have been his
[1:11:41] appearance. She wasn't worried about his
[1:11:42] parents anyway cuz she wasn't marrying
[1:11:44] him. Well, praise the Lord. I don't know
[1:11:47] about you, I ain't marrying no preacher
[1:11:49] in this message. I'm marrying Jesus
[1:11:51] Christ.
[1:11:53] So, he delivers to her now the matan.
[1:11:58] So, the matan could be cash, I'm reading
[1:12:02] this to you now from history, or
[1:12:04] property or something of a personal
[1:12:08] nature.
[1:12:12] Ah, so it could be money or it could be
[1:12:16] property or it could be something from
[1:12:20] the bridegroom which was of his own
[1:12:24] personal
[1:12:26] nature you know something like a token
[1:12:29] or something.
[1:12:32] Glory hallelujah. Why in the world
[1:12:35] friends would we want to settle for
[1:12:36] tongues been the evidence of the Holy
[1:12:38] Ghost when the matan the bridegroom is
[1:12:40] wanting to give to the bride is his own
[1:12:43] personal nature. Can't you see that's
[1:12:46] what makes you bride is your nature
[1:12:49] matches his. I mentioned that in brother
[1:12:51] David this week that whatever type of
[1:12:53] woman that the Lord Jesus takes out of
[1:12:55] this world in a rapture proves what kind
[1:12:58] of God he really is. What if he takes a
[1:13:01] woman that's a liar, an adulterer, a
[1:13:04] whoreonger, a denomination or whatever
[1:13:06] more? That proves he is a compromiser.
[1:13:10] He cannot be trusted. So he demands us
[1:13:14] to just tow the line and live right. We
[1:13:17] can't cut our hair. We can't do this. We
[1:13:19] can't do that. And he's going to let
[1:13:21] people that are Catholics go in the
[1:13:24] rapture who pray to Mary.
[1:13:28] And if I step out of line one little
[1:13:31] bit, he takes his belt off to me and
[1:13:33] wears me out. That's right. You do you
[1:13:36] the same way. If he don't, I feel sorry
[1:13:38] for you. Or you say, "God never corrects
[1:13:41] me." I'd run to this altar right now. I
[1:13:43] wouldn't even wait for an altar call.
[1:13:44] You get that old bastard spirit off of
[1:13:46] you. If you belong to God, God corrects
[1:13:50] you. Why? Cuz he loves you. You're his
[1:13:53] own. Now watch. whatever this man
[1:13:57] brings. What a responsibility. Now, so
[1:14:00] the the groom then will convey his gift
[1:14:04] and it's in the message. So it's it's
[1:14:07] molded together as it was with the
[1:14:10] delivery of the gift that he brings. So
[1:14:13] whenever God would send a messenger,
[1:14:15] what he would leave the bride, would it
[1:14:17] be a university? Maybe a university and
[1:14:21] we'll name a university after that
[1:14:23] messenger. Or maybe a bridge. We'll name
[1:14:25] a bridge after him. Or what about a
[1:14:28] highway? Or what about our favorite
[1:14:30] drink? Or we'll have Dunkin' Donuts and
[1:14:33] make a donut in memory of the
[1:14:36] messenger? What will the messenger
[1:14:40] convey? If you'll read the preface of
[1:14:42] the church age book, you'll find out.
[1:14:45] For he said it was his desire. Don't
[1:14:47] think for a minute that he wanted people
[1:14:49] to follow him. He said, but he wanted
[1:14:52] people to get a closer relationship to
[1:14:55] Jesus Christ. There you go. That's
[1:14:58] right. And the church said,
[1:15:01] so you see the matan was a
[1:15:06] voluntary
[1:15:08] assurance of the groom's personal
[1:15:11] interest in his bride. So whenever this
[1:15:16] man would bring this, he would be able
[1:15:19] to tell him, "Now my lady, this is from
[1:15:22] Isaac
[1:15:24] himself. This is not from me. This is
[1:15:27] not from Abraham. This is not from
[1:15:29] anyone else. This is personally from the
[1:15:32] very heart. And Isaac himself gave me
[1:15:36] this for you." Now he wanted me to
[1:15:40] convey to you this is a deposit,
[1:15:46] a down payment.
[1:15:48] Now my lady, it is wonderful and it is
[1:15:52] awesome. But I'm going to tell you right
[1:15:54] now, when you get this down payment,
[1:15:57] don't think this down payment will be
[1:16:00] all you'll ever want. Because once you
[1:16:03] get this down payment, it will open up a
[1:16:06] realm and a sphere to you that the more
[1:16:09] you get, the more you will want. As a
[1:16:12] matter of fact, my lady, there may be
[1:16:15] times that you'll even wonder if you've
[1:16:17] even received the assurance because you
[1:16:20] want so much more. I hope somebody's
[1:16:23] hearing me tonight. You see, many people
[1:16:26] even around the message and they feel
[1:16:28] like, Lord, I I don't have the Holy
[1:16:30] Ghost. I I couldn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:32] because I'm hungering so much. I want
[1:16:34] more all the time and I'm thirsting more
[1:16:36] all the time. And they think by that it
[1:16:39] means they don't have it. Well, if
[1:16:40] that's so, then I don't have it either.
[1:16:44] Cuz I want more than I've ever had.
[1:16:47] Anybody else feel the same way? I want
[1:16:49] more than I've ever had of God. I'm
[1:16:51] hungry. You imagine the prophet of God
[1:16:54] saying it in the last few weeks of his
[1:16:57] life that he longed for those
[1:17:00] mountaintop experiences. How to feel
[1:17:03] like he did when he first got
[1:17:07] saved a month before brother Brandham
[1:17:10] left the earth and he was thinking about
[1:17:14] those mountaintop experiences and how to
[1:17:17] feel like he did when he first got
[1:17:19] saved. Why? Because the hard battles of
[1:17:22] life can desensitize us to one another
[1:17:25] and desensitize us to the spirit of God.
[1:17:29] And we deal with so much stress and
[1:17:31] pressure and so much difficulty in the
[1:17:34] age we live in. Anybody hear me tonight?
[1:17:37] Anybody know what I'm talking about? And
[1:17:39] what does all you say? Oh, for the days
[1:17:41] when it was so much easier, but yet
[1:17:44] would you really want to revert back to
[1:17:47] being a baby in Christ? I wouldn't. Was
[1:17:50] it easier when I first got saved? Sure
[1:17:52] it was. Was it easier when I first come
[1:17:54] to the message? Sure it was. But would I
[1:17:56] want to go back? No way. I can see the
[1:18:00] lights of home. We're that close. I
[1:18:03] believe with all my heart it's harder,
[1:18:05] Harry. But we're closer to home. We're
[1:18:08] almost there, saints.
[1:18:10] [Applause]
[1:18:12] Oh
[1:18:14] my. Can you imagine? Now
[1:18:18] Isaac, if we could say in this day,
[1:18:21] Isaac would have been like a
[1:18:24] multi-millionaire. His father had sheep,
[1:18:28] dramadaries, camels,
[1:18:31] shies, silver, gold. I mean, they had so
[1:18:34] much stuff that he had. Can you imagine
[1:18:38] what her matan was?
[1:18:48] Devil, if you don't mind, I'd like to
[1:18:50] embarrass you. Well, yeah. Actually, if
[1:18:53] you do mind, I hope you don't mind. I'd
[1:18:55] like for you to lay your matan up here
[1:18:57] on this altar rail here.
[1:19:02] I want you to show these people why they
[1:19:05] need to leave the Lord Jesus and follow
[1:19:08] you.
[1:19:10] Cuz that's what you do. You try to tell
[1:19:12] them you don't love them. You try to
[1:19:14] discourage them. You try to get them
[1:19:15] down. And you try to tell them they need
[1:19:17] to serve you. So what I want to do, I'm
[1:19:18] going to give you just a couple minutes.
[1:19:19] It shouldn't take but a few seconds more
[1:19:21] than you have. But I want you to lay out
[1:19:23] for us here what you have.
[1:19:26] Contention, division, adultery,
[1:19:29] fornication, lying, idolatry,
[1:19:34] perverseness. You ain't got no heaven.
[1:19:37] You ain't got no divine healing. You
[1:19:40] ain't got no supernatural power. You
[1:19:42] can't raise the dead. You can't heal the
[1:19:45] sick. You can't men the bro. Oh,
[1:19:47] hallelujah to God. You can't men the
[1:19:49] brokenhearted.
[1:19:51] That's right. Amen. And you want us
[1:19:56] to leave all of this wealth and follow
[1:19:59] you. Poor old devil.
[1:20:06] Poor old devil.
[1:20:10] Oh
[1:20:12] my. Let's just let's just look
[1:20:16] now. So
[1:20:21] maybe and the servants go out and here
[1:20:24] they
[1:20:24] come and they bring in these
[1:20:28] tapestries woven maybe from
[1:20:31] Persia and they go to laying it out.
[1:20:35] There's gold,
[1:20:37] silver,
[1:20:39] sapphires, onyx,
[1:20:45] chalidany. Y'all need to get used to
[1:20:47] that because the foundation in your
[1:20:50] city, amethyst, jasper,
[1:20:54] sardics. Oh, I'd love to bring them
[1:20:56] colors to you sometime and show them to
[1:20:58] you on these screens right here. What's
[1:21:00] the Lord Jesus doing? What? I wonder why
[1:21:04] this message that he allowed this
[1:21:06] messenger to bring in to break into the
[1:21:08] truest riches of God and no other
[1:21:12] messenger Paul all the rest of the
[1:21:14] brothers and they preached for the light
[1:21:15] of their day brother Daryl but yet this
[1:21:17] prophet was allowed to preach sermons
[1:21:20] that had never been preached since the
[1:21:22] gospel started being preached 2,000
[1:21:24] years ago. Why? What's he doing? He's
[1:21:27] laying out the tapestry woven up of the
[1:21:30] gospel and laying out the treasures
[1:21:32] before the bride. There was never
[1:21:34] another man that was allowed to preach
[1:21:37] the future home of the heavenly
[1:21:39] bridegroom and the earthly bride and be
[1:21:42] able to go into the depths and the
[1:21:45] riches and the treasure. Oh my. Luther
[1:21:48] was not allowed to go beyond the curtain
[1:21:51] of time. Wesley was not allowed.
[1:21:53] Pentecost and all their gifts was not
[1:21:56] allowed to go beyond the curtain of
[1:21:58] time. But God told his messenger, "I
[1:22:01] want you to go there and I want you to
[1:22:03] remember things. I want you to see
[1:22:05] things and I want you to take them back
[1:22:07] down to my bride. It's my personal gift
[1:22:11] to her. They're going to lose husbands
[1:22:14] and fathers and daughters and babies.
[1:22:17] And I want you to bring it to them in
[1:22:19] such a way that it will comfort their
[1:22:22] hearts. It will make them so homesick
[1:22:25] for heaven. They can't wait to be in
[1:22:27] that paradise of God. Lay it out to
[1:22:30] them, Elizer. Lay it out to them how
[1:22:34] much I love him. Lay it out to him how
[1:22:36] great I am. Lay it out to them what I
[1:22:39] heaven store.
[1:22:49] Gold,
[1:22:52] silver,
[1:22:54] purple,
[1:22:57] blue,
[1:22:59] exquisite
[1:23:04] jewelry. Oh, I can see her. She picks at
[1:23:07] me and says, "What's that?"
[1:23:10] said, "Rebecca, that was a wedding band
[1:23:13] of unmmerited predestinated grace. He
[1:23:17] slid on your finger before the
[1:23:19] foundation of the world. And you mean
[1:23:21] that's mine? It's yours. Have you got
[1:23:24] enough faith in the promise to claim
[1:23:25] it?"
[1:23:30] Oh, embroidered fabrics and not just
[1:23:33] plain old, you know, I mean, how you
[1:23:35] know what I guess really this is a great
[1:23:37] example right here. You couldn't get no
[1:23:39] planer than a plain old white
[1:23:41] handkerchief,
[1:23:42] right? Made in China, our favorite place
[1:23:45] in all the world. And they last for so
[1:23:47] long and then you have to throw them
[1:23:50] away. You imagine her. She stood there
[1:23:52] and said, "What should I do, sir?" Oh,
[1:23:56] that's up to you. This is yours.
[1:24:02] You mean all of this is mine? This all
[1:24:05] came from my
[1:24:08] master. You see, he's a he's a man of
[1:24:10] such mercy and kindness. And I'm telling
[1:24:13] you right now, you talking about a man
[1:24:16] of your
[1:24:18] dreams. Some of you women married a man
[1:24:20] you thought was of your dreams, but he
[1:24:22] turned out to be a man of your
[1:24:24] nightmares. Woo! Preach it, Brother
[1:24:27] Donnie. That's what we found in some of
[1:24:29] the churches we was in, too. Some of the
[1:24:31] preachers that we've set under our life.
[1:24:33] Oh, praise God. The church of my dream
[1:24:36] and the pastor of my dreams and he
[1:24:38] turned out to be a werewolf and a
[1:24:40] nightmare. Oh, glory to God. But you
[1:24:43] imagine, oh, Elijah could stand there
[1:24:44] and said, "I'm telling you, my lady,
[1:24:46] I've been around him. I ain't never seen
[1:24:49] nobody quite like him. He's got
[1:24:51] tempers." And you know, Isaac was a
[1:24:53] total different man than Abraham was. He
[1:24:57] was a more of a a guy that meditated and
[1:25:00] quiet. And Isaac was known by whales.
[1:25:04] Abraham was known by faith. But Isaac
[1:25:07] was known. Now remember both of them
[1:25:08] merged together are expression of the
[1:25:10] Godhead which is God the father and the
[1:25:13] the father God manifested in humanity
[1:25:16] and the son. So here both of them have
[1:25:18] great attributes that must be expressed.
[1:25:20] But Isaac was known by what? Oh, he had
[1:25:23] faith in God's promise. Yes. But he was
[1:25:25] identified more with whales. What comes
[1:25:27] out of whales? Water.
[1:25:31] refreshing water.
[1:25:35] And whenever she sees him the first
[1:25:38] time, you know what he's doing? He's out
[1:25:40] in the field
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:47] meditating.
[1:25:53] Oh, I love you all night.
[1:26:00] She didn't say, "Good Lord, who in the
[1:26:02] world is that holy roller?"
[1:26:06] But you imagine when she sees him for
[1:26:09] the first time
[1:26:12] and he's meditating.
[1:26:14] Now, he's not living in the home place
[1:26:16] of his father, but he's moved into the
[1:26:19] Southland. So, he left his home to meet
[1:26:23] her in between her home and his home.
[1:26:26] Yeah, I Isaac has sent jewels to his
[1:26:31] bride. Song of Solomon
[1:26:35] 1:9. I have compared thee, oh my love,
[1:26:40] to a company of
[1:26:42] horses and Pharaoh's chariots. Our
[1:26:45] brothers, please don't tell your wife
[1:26:48] this.
[1:26:50] your girlfriend, your brothers is dating
[1:26:52] a girl or court the girl, whatever term
[1:26:54] you want to call it. And after church,
[1:26:55] you text her and say, "Sweetheart, you
[1:26:58] remind me of a company of Pharaoh's
[1:27:02] chariots." You'll get an emoji at the
[1:27:04] end of it. We're done. We're
[1:27:07] finished. But you have to catch this in
[1:27:10] the setting. What is it about horses?
[1:27:14] They are some of the most beautiful of
[1:27:17] all of God's creation. Amen. And they
[1:27:20] can stand out in the field without
[1:27:22] anybody ever brushing them or anything
[1:27:24] and just stand there and the sun hit
[1:27:26] their coat. To me, they could just be
[1:27:28] absolutely breathtaking. I know some of
[1:27:29] y'all like dogs and cats. And bless your
[1:27:34] hearts. But if you'll notice, he didn't
[1:27:37] say she looked like a bunch of cats or
[1:27:40] she didn't look like a bunch of dogs.
[1:27:43] I have compelled thee, oh my love, to a
[1:27:46] company of horses and pharaoh's
[1:27:51] chariots. Thy
[1:27:53] cheeks are comely with
[1:27:57] rows of
[1:27:59] jewels.
[1:28:01] Ah, so her personal
[1:28:04] matand
[1:28:06] became she found what to do with
[1:28:09] them. Dress herself in them.
[1:28:13] [Laughter]
[1:28:15] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Notice
[1:28:19] they were not just piled up on there
[1:28:21] with a hot glue stick, but they were in
[1:28:24] rose
[1:28:26] order. God loves divine order, not man's
[1:28:29] order now, divine order. So, here the
[1:28:32] bride and he said, "Oh, I I I beheld you
[1:28:35] and you can imagine the horses that
[1:28:37] Pharaoh would have had." He could have
[1:28:39] had the finest, most pristine horses
[1:28:42] absolutely known to man in the world.
[1:28:45] Nothing quite like them. And Solomon had
[1:28:48] seen them and no doubt he would look at
[1:28:51] them and they would come and they would
[1:28:53] be so black and so brilliant and so
[1:28:56] shiny or white or whatever the color
[1:28:57] they were and they would have been
[1:28:59] breathtaking because horses were not
[1:29:01] introduced into the land of Israel.
[1:29:04] remembers more so into the solommonic
[1:29:06] time than it was in the Davidic time.
[1:29:09] And here he looked at her with
[1:29:11] admiration and said,
[1:29:14] "You, oh my
[1:29:17] love, you're like a
[1:29:19] company of Pharaoh's horses in Pharaoh's
[1:29:24] chariots.
[1:29:25] Your cheeks are comely with rows of
[1:29:29] jewels, thy neck with
[1:29:33] chains of
[1:29:35] gold. Now look at what he's seeing.
[1:29:38] Well, now wait a minute. This girl was a
[1:29:40] poor girl.
[1:29:43] Remember the
[1:29:44] Schulamite from the north country? Poor
[1:29:46] girl.
[1:29:48] So where'd she get jewels?
[1:29:51] Where'd she get
[1:29:52] gold? The man bragging on her gave her
[1:29:55] the gold for her to wear.
[1:29:59] That's how our Lord Jesus is. Oh, glory
[1:30:02] to God. You can't you friend, you can't
[1:30:04] wait. You think till you be able to go
[1:30:05] see him. Let me just turn the ride
[1:30:06] around on you. He's been waiting for
[1:30:08] thousands of years to see you and I. You
[1:30:10] imagine brother Daryl when he reaches
[1:30:12] down and takes us by the hand and say,
[1:30:13] "Come on, children. Take a walk with
[1:30:15] me." And you we go in the paradise of
[1:30:17] God and us poor mortals that was lost
[1:30:19] without his mercy at one time. And what
[1:30:21] does he do? He saves us, sanctifies us,
[1:30:24] fills us with the Holy Ghost, he gives
[1:30:25] us jewels. What do we do with them?
[1:30:27] Let's not be like, you know, Ezekiel 16
[1:30:30] whenever he talks about Israel in the
[1:30:31] Old Testament and God said, "I found you
[1:30:33] in your blood." And I said, "Yay, live.
[1:30:35] Lay thy live." And he said, "You was not
[1:30:37] salted when you were born, neither did
[1:30:39] anyone cut your navl, but when I found
[1:30:41] you, I looked upon you, and it was a
[1:30:43] time of love, and I spread my skirt over
[1:30:45] you. And what did God do? God gave her
[1:30:48] gold. God gave her silver. and she took
[1:30:50] thou all of those things that God gave
[1:30:52] her and turned herself into a
[1:30:56] Let us not take God's gifts. Let us not
[1:31:00] take God's blessings even financially
[1:31:03] and turn ourselves into something God
[1:31:06] entrusted us with it.
[1:31:10] Oh
[1:31:11] my.
[1:31:13] Hallelujah. Notice this in chapter 7
[1:31:16] verse one. How
[1:31:18] beautiful are thy feet with
[1:31:22] shoes, oh prince's
[1:31:25] daughter. The joints of thy thighs are
[1:31:28] like
[1:31:29] jewels. The work of the hands of a
[1:31:33] cunning workman. Isaiah 61:10, "I will
[1:31:37] greatly rejoice in the Lord. My soul
[1:31:40] shall be joyful in my God, for he hath
[1:31:45] clothed me with the garments of
[1:31:49] salvation. He hath covered me with a
[1:31:53] robe of
[1:31:55] righteousness, as a bridegroom deck
[1:31:58] himself with ornaments, as a bride
[1:32:01] adornneth herself with her jewels. And
[1:32:04] where did you get them?
[1:32:08] Your husband sent them to you. Amen. In
[1:32:12] what form of his scripture and in the
[1:32:16] last days, an
[1:32:17] enlightenment specially needed and
[1:32:20] required for the Leodysian bride in
[1:32:24] order for her to be meticulously dressed
[1:32:27] to meet her husband. So, can you imagine
[1:32:30] then our husband, the Lord Jesus, will
[1:32:32] appear in a glorified body. He will
[1:32:35] appear in all of his majesty and then we
[1:32:38] appear in rags.
[1:32:41] We come out of Leodysia and we're our
[1:32:43] our clothes are tattered and torn. There
[1:32:45] we stand in 57 year old bodies and 68
[1:32:48] year old bodies and 75 year old bodies.
[1:32:52] And we're going to meet him like that.
[1:32:56] No, I'll tell you how we're going to
[1:32:57] meet him. Like young men and young
[1:33:00] women.
[1:33:01] And when you stand there, the type of
[1:33:03] body you stand in expresses your
[1:33:07] destiny.
[1:33:09] You see, when those that go in the
[1:33:11] tribulation period, question answer 62,
[1:33:13] where are the foolish virgin in the
[1:33:15] tribulation? It said in the grave. When
[1:33:17] they raise in the white throne judgment,
[1:33:19] their own body testifies they miss the
[1:33:22] fullness of redemption. But when you and
[1:33:25] I go before him, we will be clothed in
[1:33:28] his righteousness.
[1:33:30] But we will not just have on a garment
[1:33:32] of righteousness. We will have meekness.
[1:33:35] We will have kindness. We will have
[1:33:37] love. We will have obedience. And
[1:33:39] friends, we're not going to wait till we
[1:33:40] get there. The bride has already given
[1:33:43] us some batan right now called the
[1:33:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he's gi
[1:33:47] us the virtues. Don't you understand
[1:33:48] what I've been preaching out on the
[1:33:50] virtues? The virtues to the bride are
[1:33:53] part of those treasures. Faith, virtue,
[1:33:57] knowledge. What is that? That's part of
[1:33:59] the treasures that he wants you to put
[1:34:01] them
[1:34:02] on. This is what the bride is decked in.
[1:34:05] Not pride and arrogance and wealth and
[1:34:08] look at all of our cars and look at all
[1:34:10] of our houses and boy I can do this and
[1:34:12] I can do that. Oh my no sir. Faith,
[1:34:17] virtue, knowledge, temperance.
[1:34:21] Oh, as a bride adornneth
[1:34:25] herself with her jewels. Malachi
[1:34:30] 3:17, "And they shall be mine, saith the
[1:34:33] Lord of
[1:34:35] hosts, in that
[1:34:37] day when I make
[1:34:40] up my
[1:34:45] jewels." So he gives you something, you
[1:34:48] use it, apply it, and it changes you
[1:34:53] into the gift he gave you.
[1:34:57] Amen. Yes, sir. Do you understand what
[1:35:01] you are? Do you understand the
[1:35:03] leadership of eternal life? The last
[1:35:06] sermons that he actually preaches,
[1:35:08] follow
[1:35:10] me, and leadership. And he says it over
[1:35:13] and over again, the leadership of
[1:35:16] eternal life. It's evident. Some folks
[1:35:19] follow the message, but they have no
[1:35:21] idea about the leadership of eternal
[1:35:23] life. That's right. cuz they make this
[1:35:26] agenda and that agenda and that agenda
[1:35:28] and this kingdom and that kingdom. The
[1:35:30] eternal life will not lead you to the
[1:35:32] kingdom of a man, the kingdom of a
[1:35:34] church, the kingdom of a preacher. No
[1:35:36] sir, eternal life knows that's only
[1:35:38] temporal. But the leadership of eternal
[1:35:41] life will lead you to the person of life
[1:35:43] himself. And it will so transform you as
[1:35:47] you put it on. The robe of
[1:35:49] righteousness, the nature of Christ, the
[1:35:52] very matan of the Lord Jesus, the token
[1:35:54] of his assurance that you die and he
[1:35:59] becomes alive in you. Amen. Then
[1:36:03] literally you become Miss Jesus Christ
[1:36:10] and you are him. Can anybody say amen to
[1:36:14] that? Amen.
[1:36:16] And they shall be mine, saith the Lord
[1:36:18] of hosts, in that day when I will make
[1:36:21] up my jewels. So the rapture is
[1:36:24] gathering the jewels from one state out
[1:36:27] of another, from one country out of
[1:36:28] another to bring them in to the
[1:36:31] bridegroom's treasure house.
[1:36:35] and I will spare
[1:36:37] them as a man
[1:36:41] spareth his own
[1:36:44] son. Notice Isaiah 6:13. to appoint unto
[1:36:48] them that mourn in Zion, and to give
[1:36:52] unto them
[1:36:53] beauty for ashes, and the oil of joy for
[1:36:59] mourning, the garment of
[1:37:02] praise for the spirit of heaviness.
[1:37:07] I think some of y'all forgot that one
[1:37:10] tonight. You come to
[1:37:12] church with your spirit of heaviness.
[1:37:15] You forgot to change clothes. Instead of
[1:37:18] coming to church with your garment of
[1:37:20] praise, you come and say, "All right,
[1:37:22] brother Donnie, bless me if you
[1:37:25] can. Bless me, song leader. Bless me.
[1:37:28] You special singing people. I've went
[1:37:31] through hell today." You think the song
[1:37:33] leader ain't went through hell. You
[1:37:35] think the musicians ain't went through
[1:37:36] hell. You think the preacher ain't went
[1:37:38] through hell. But I refuse to wear my
[1:37:41] old spirit of heaviness to church. I
[1:37:44] want to put on my garment of praise.
[1:37:46] Every come I come to the house of God.
[1:37:49] Come on, somebody. Anybody else here
[1:37:51] want to wear your garment of praise to
[1:37:53] the house of God? I don't want to just
[1:37:55] wear it twice a week. I want to wear it
[1:37:57] every day.
[1:38:00] Oh my. That they might be called
[1:38:05] trees of
[1:38:07] righteousness, the planting of the
[1:38:10] Lord, that he might be glorified. So it
[1:38:13] started with the tree in the garden of
[1:38:14] Eden. It ends up the trees in the last
[1:38:17] days. Revelation 3:4, "Thou hast a few
[1:38:20] names even in Sardis, which have not
[1:38:22] defiled the garments, and they shall
[1:38:24] walk with me in white, for they are
[1:38:27] worthy. He that overcomemeth the same
[1:38:29] shall be clothed in white raignnt, and I
[1:38:32] will not blot out his name out of the
[1:38:36] book of life. But I will confess his
[1:38:38] name before my father and before his
[1:38:44] angels. Friends, can you imagine one day
[1:38:46] we're going to walk before that great
[1:38:48] throne?
[1:38:53] I don't know about you, but I want to
[1:38:54] stand in my proper
[1:38:58] place. God's grace, mercy, call me to be
[1:39:00] a
[1:39:01] preacher. Therefore, I will give an
[1:39:03] account with the people I've preached to
[1:39:06] as a pastor, people I've tried to lead.
[1:39:09] We will be a little subgroup there under
[1:39:12] the ministry of Malachi 4. And he will
[1:39:15] turn and present the entire Leodysian
[1:39:19] bride. Then each individually we will
[1:39:23] come up before the Lord
[1:39:25] Jesus and you get your first glimpse at
[1:39:28] him and he will
[1:39:32] speak your name.
[1:39:35] I'm telling you, you don't want to walk
[1:39:37] up there by yourself.
[1:39:40] You don't want to walk up there at odds
[1:39:43] against the very messenger that was sent
[1:39:45] to lead you.
[1:39:47] You don't want to walk up there at odds
[1:39:49] against the very pastor that God gave
[1:39:51] you a pastor after his own heart or
[1:39:55] evangelist or teacher. And the church
[1:39:58] said, "You want all of those
[1:40:02] ambassadors speaking on your behalf?"
[1:40:10] Oh my. Can we read a few more
[1:40:11] scriptures?
[1:40:14] Now let me
[1:40:15] just address
[1:40:20] you, oh daughter of the
[1:40:23] king. Psalm 45:10. Hearken, oh daughter,
[1:40:28] and consider and cry in thine ear.
[1:40:32] Forget not also thine own people and thy
[1:40:34] father's house.
[1:40:36] So shall the
[1:40:38] king greatly
[1:40:40] desire thy
[1:40:42] beauty, for he is thy
[1:40:45] lord, and worship thou him. And the
[1:40:48] daughter of
[1:40:49] Tyrie shall be there with a gift. Even
[1:40:53] the rich among the people shall entreat
[1:40:56] thy favor.
[1:40:59] The king's
[1:41:01] daughter is all glorious
[1:41:04] within. Her clothing is of wrought
[1:41:10] gold. Her
[1:41:12] clothing is of wrought
[1:41:15] gold. Now you talking about
[1:41:18] wells. So they would take gold and beat
[1:41:22] it so small it would become
[1:41:25] threadlike. And then they would take the
[1:41:28] fine flax
[1:41:30] linen and they would put it together,
[1:41:33] the threads of gold and the threads of
[1:41:37] linen. And they say that that the flax
[1:41:41] grows in Egypt and the linen would be as
[1:41:45] worth as much as an ounce of gold. And
[1:41:50] when the sun would hit that linen, it
[1:41:53] was so brilliant that it would almost be
[1:41:56] blinding to your
[1:41:58] eyes. So you imagine a garment that is
[1:42:02] interwoven was white and gold together.
[1:42:05] And he said, "Oh, king's
[1:42:08] daughter."
[1:42:10] Hallelujah. Her clothing is of raw gold.
[1:42:15] She shall be
[1:42:16] brought unto the king in
[1:42:20] reignment of needle
[1:42:22] work. The
[1:42:24] virgins, notice
[1:42:26] now Matthew
[1:42:30] 25, the parable of the 10
[1:42:33] virgins. Jesus never says them virgins
[1:42:36] are bride. Right.
[1:42:41] They're the bridal
[1:42:43] party, not bride. Now, I know we mix the
[1:42:46] types and say we're like the wise
[1:42:47] virgins and we want the oil. I'm good
[1:42:49] with that. But Jesus is sharing with us
[1:42:52] the Mediterranean wedding
[1:42:55] ceremony. Now, notice what he says about
[1:42:59] them. her
[1:43:01] companions, the
[1:43:03] virgins, her companions that follow her
[1:43:06] shall be brought unto thee. With
[1:43:09] gladness and rejoicing shall they be
[1:43:12] brought. Why? To come into the
[1:43:15] presence of the king's daughter.
[1:43:19] Now I hope you understand this that
[1:43:22] God in the
[1:43:24] beginning created the king's
[1:43:28] son and he named him
[1:43:31] Adam English
[1:43:34] Adam. Then God brought into
[1:43:37] existence the king's
[1:43:40] daughter and the king's
[1:43:43] son was going to marry the king's
[1:43:46] daughter.
[1:43:49] Do you understand why he's not ashamed
[1:43:53] to call us
[1:43:57] siblings? The king's
[1:44:01] son will
[1:44:03] marry the king's daughter.
[1:44:07] Amen. Oh, my sister,
[1:44:11] my
[1:44:13] spouse, my beloved.
[1:44:17] Oh, glory to God.
[1:44:21] With gladness and rejoicing shall they
[1:44:23] be brought. They shall enter into the
[1:44:25] king's palace instead of thy father
[1:44:28] shall be thy children whom thou makest
[1:44:30] my princes in all the
[1:44:32] earth. I will make thy name to be
[1:44:35] remembered in all
[1:44:39] generations. Therefore shall the people
[1:44:41] praise thee forever.
[1:44:46] and
[1:44:48] ever. Can you imagine them inhabitants
[1:44:51] that live outside the city when they
[1:44:54] come in and they break off a leaf off
[1:44:56] the tree of life and they hand it to one
[1:44:59] another and they walk them through the
[1:45:02] streets and how they've been
[1:45:05] allowed into the inner sanctum of the
[1:45:09] city which is where you
[1:45:13] live. They come in from Arabia. They
[1:45:15] come in from the United States as we
[1:45:17] know it. It'll be different then. Of
[1:45:19] course, they'll come from all over the
[1:45:21] earth from different seasons and
[1:45:23] times. You imagine as they come in and
[1:45:26] they see you. Hey, how are you, ma'am?
[1:45:30] How are you? Oh, good king. You imagine
[1:45:35] talking to one another. Can you imagine
[1:45:37] what it must be like to live here every
[1:45:44] day? And they just talk back and forth.
[1:45:46] Say, "It must be
[1:45:49] awesome. They tell me they've been here
[1:45:51] for a hundred million
[1:45:54] years. You mean they've been here that
[1:45:56] long?" Yeah. Wow. They say, "Wow, they
[1:45:59] ain't one of them was over 18."
[1:46:03] They tell me that their youth is
[1:46:06] constantly renewed.
[1:46:09] And they just follow him wherever he
[1:46:12] goes.
[1:46:14] And there's no more sorrow and deaths
[1:46:16] and tears. And you know what they tell
[1:46:19] me? There's no need of the sun here in
[1:46:22] the
[1:46:23] city. John didn't say outside,
[1:46:27] but he said in the city.
[1:46:30] Don't you understand what the king sent
[1:46:32] his messenger to bring
[1:46:34] us is only a small little down
[1:46:38] payment of what we're going to get after
[1:46:40] a while. To me, it was so fitting that
[1:46:42] the very very man who brought us such
[1:46:44] understanding was the very man that God
[1:46:46] chose to preach to us about our future
[1:46:49] home.
[1:46:51] And even in 1965 before he left told us
[1:46:54] the state of construction.
[1:46:58] That's right.
[1:47:00] And remember the friend of the brag had
[1:47:02] a special honor and he had a special
[1:47:04] place. And let me remind you where the
[1:47:07] seven friends and the seven church ages
[1:47:10] were in relation to the
[1:47:15] bridegroom and his right
[1:47:19] hand. Brother Tim Puit wasn't there.
[1:47:23] Brother
[1:47:25] Daryl, brother Joel Brown, Brother John,
[1:47:28] and the rest of our brothers here. No
[1:47:30] other preachers in this church age, me
[1:47:33] included. That's right.
[1:47:36] I don't have that place of honor.
[1:47:40] Come on, somebody. That's right. I'm
[1:47:42] just honored to be part of the company.
[1:47:49] Praise God.
[1:47:52] And the servant brought forth jewels of
[1:47:57] silver, jewels of
[1:48:00] gold, and
[1:48:02] raignment, and gave them to
[1:48:07] Rebecca. And he gave also to her
[1:48:12] brother and to her
[1:48:16] mother precious
[1:48:19] things. Few healings, few
[1:48:23] miracles. Some folks got saved. Hey,
[1:48:25] that's precious.
[1:48:27] Notice the difference in the value of
[1:48:30] the
[1:48:31] gifts. No gold, no silver, no jewels, no
[1:48:36] matan, no personal, no personal
[1:48:40] something from the bridegroom
[1:48:42] specifically with their name on it.
[1:48:48] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:48:51] Oh Lord,
[1:48:56] let's stand.
[1:49:00] So now because the
[1:49:02] talks had went favorable so
[1:49:05] far, Eleer presents the Mohar.
[1:49:12] M O H A
[1:49:14] R A gift from the family of the
[1:49:18] bridegroom to the
[1:49:21] parents and the
[1:49:24] relatives of the
[1:49:27] bride. So you see it wasn't just us that
[1:49:30] was benefiting. All you got to do,
[1:49:32] friends, is go on
[1:49:34] YouTube. You'll find Tail Osburn. You'll
[1:49:37] find Tail Osburn's daughter. You'll find
[1:49:41] different men by different names,
[1:49:43] Pentecostal,
[1:49:45] charismatic. You'll talk about them
[1:49:47] going to Eluser's
[1:49:50] meetings and benefiting and they saw
[1:49:54] such faith. As a matter of fact, one of
[1:49:56] the sisters here at the church had put
[1:49:57] it up on Instagram, I think it was, and
[1:49:59] Carol had pulled it up this week and it
[1:50:02] was a man
[1:50:04] testifying about our
[1:50:06] Eleaser. And he said that somebody had
[1:50:08] come to the meeting and they dressed up
[1:50:11] and put on, you know, like old ragged
[1:50:13] looking clothes and had a stick and
[1:50:16] glasses like sunglasses or something
[1:50:18] like they were
[1:50:19] blind and they were going to try to
[1:50:22] trick
[1:50:26] Eleaser. So he prayed for people and
[1:50:29] then they come up or prayer card was
[1:50:31] called or whatever it was and whenever
[1:50:33] they called Eleazar turned and said you
[1:50:37] sought to deceive the spirit of
[1:50:40] God but because you thought to deceive
[1:50:43] the spirit of God the very thing you
[1:50:45] acted like you now
[1:50:52] have. So the same messenger could either
[1:50:57] give you sight or blind you.
[1:51:06] You understand? That's where we are.
[1:51:08] The message is opening the eyes
[1:51:12] of people around the world and it's
[1:51:15] blinding the eyes of others.
[1:51:20] And the sad part about it is there's
[1:51:21] some around the message that look at it
[1:51:23] and it's making them go t totally blind
[1:51:29] because they can't separate a son of man
[1:51:32] from the son of man. That's right. But
[1:51:36] see Rebecca that's from your personal
[1:51:39] matan from the gift of Isaac himself.
[1:51:43] It's the ability to be able to separate
[1:51:46] the seventh angel from Christ. We're
[1:51:50] blessed, brother.
[1:51:52] Remember that serpent bite was so strong
[1:51:56] that it came after the prophet himself.
[1:52:00] But the blood was so rich,
[1:52:04] it didn't take effect on him. I've got
[1:52:07] the same type of blood. Amen. Yours got
[1:52:10] the same type of blood. It's family
[1:52:12] blood. It's not brand blood. It's God
[1:52:15] blood. It's God blood. We can look right
[1:52:17] at it. The prophet said some people
[1:52:19] could look at the sun, go totally blind.
[1:52:21] Others could look at it and come out of
[1:52:22] there and guide him, lead them here to
[1:52:24] do this, that and the other. That's part
[1:52:26] of your gift, little
[1:52:28] Rebecca. You imagine her going home that
[1:52:32] night and sitting down thinking, "What
[1:52:36] has happened?
[1:52:39] What has happened to me this
[1:52:43] day? This was a day of
[1:52:46] destiny when her life would never be the
[1:52:49] same. I wonder I just wonder if she was
[1:52:54] raised up around that little country
[1:52:55] there and maybe thought, you know what,
[1:52:58] I'll probably just marry old Sam down
[1:53:00] there at the market or I'll marry uh you
[1:53:02] know, maybe Jebster over here and he
[1:53:04] he's he's a sheep guy and I'll marry
[1:53:07] this guy over here and I know there's
[1:53:09] several guys interested in me. they'll
[1:53:10] probably come and talk daddy for long
[1:53:12] and you know and and and and I I I'll
[1:53:14] just wind up being a a sheepers's wife
[1:53:17] or maybe a a farmer's wife. God said,
[1:53:21] "No, you
[1:53:25] won't." The decision she made that day
[1:53:29] changed her
[1:53:31] life forever.
[1:53:36] The decision she made gave her the right
[1:53:38] and the authority to leave her mother's
[1:53:42] house and go to Isaac's mother's
[1:53:47] tent and become his
[1:53:53] wife. Praise God.
[1:53:56] between 450 and 500 miles away, several
[1:54:02] weeks journey. But my friends,
[1:54:06] yours is not but about 20
[1:54:10] ft from where we're standing right
[1:54:15] now. Don't you love him with all your
[1:54:17] heart?
[1:54:20] Oh, I pray you go home tonight and
[1:54:23] tomorrow and the next day and the next
[1:54:26] day and just take your little your
[1:54:30] tapestry
[1:54:31] roll and lay it out on your little
[1:54:33] table. You know, I'm speaking
[1:54:35] metaphorically
[1:54:37] now. Ju just kind of lay it out and say,
[1:54:41] "Oh my goodness, look at that. This is
[1:54:45] my personal matan. This is not mine and
[1:54:48] brother Dony's. This is mine. I'm
[1:54:51] redeemed. Silver spoke of redemption.
[1:54:54] Gold spoke of deity. Blue spoke of
[1:54:58] heavenly. Purple spoke of royal. The
[1:55:03] sockets, all the different colors, all
[1:55:05] the different materials, each of them
[1:55:07] with a significance. When God gives you
[1:55:09] gifts, they have a
[1:55:11] significance. Oh, praise God. May we
[1:55:15] leave this place tonight and take our
[1:55:17] little treasure and say, "Hallelujah. I
[1:55:19] didn't know I was so rich. I'm the
[1:55:22] king's daughter.
[1:55:24] He will make my name last forever and
[1:55:28] ever."
[1:55:33] Lord Jesus, as we bow our
[1:55:35] heads in your great presence
[1:55:41] tonight, kind of makes me feel ashamed,
[1:55:46] Lord, that we don't praise you more than
[1:55:49] we do
[1:55:50] actually, why
[1:55:52] we will spend so much time about the
[1:55:55] negative things around us and the
[1:55:58] difficulties and the burdens and the
[1:56:00] trials.
[1:56:01] And instead of getting out our matan and
[1:56:05] looking at all the good things you've
[1:56:06] given
[1:56:07] us, all the things you've
[1:56:11] done, Lord Jesus, we were lost
[1:56:15] and wretched and blind and miserable and
[1:56:19] naked. Now here we stand tonight
[1:56:23] clothed. We've got silver. We've got
[1:56:26] gold. We've got blue. We've got
[1:56:28] purple. We've got
[1:56:31] frankincense. We've got all the great
[1:56:33] things of
[1:56:34] God. And Lord Jesus, we live in the very
[1:56:37] age and time frame of the
[1:56:41] rapture. Praise God. I could be looking
[1:56:45] tonight and preaching to people that
[1:56:48] will never
[1:56:50] die. I believe we are that close.
[1:56:55] Lord, just yesterday, another one of
[1:56:57] ours passed beyond the curtain of
[1:57:01] time. As I went to her
[1:57:03] bedside on Monday evening and took her
[1:57:07] by the hand and begin to pray with her
[1:57:09] and talk to her and tell her, "Sister
[1:57:12] Marilyn, you're a winner either
[1:57:15] way. The devil can't take you till God's
[1:57:18] done with you. And if he's done with
[1:57:20] you, what awaits you on the other side."
[1:57:23] Little did I know in less than 24 hours
[1:57:26] she'd be
[1:57:28] gone. Oh, but Jesus, if we could see her
[1:57:33] tonight, glory to God. No doubt her
[1:57:37] husband, that handsome young man, was
[1:57:41] down there to meet her when she stepped
[1:57:43] out of the boat.
[1:57:45] different saints and loved ones. Praise
[1:57:49] God. They've already started a
[1:57:52] gathering. Hallelujah. And a homecoming
[1:57:55] there in that sixth
[1:57:57] dimension. Lord, one by one, they're
[1:58:01] crossing. We're getting more over there
[1:58:03] than we've got left
[1:58:05] here. Each one of them that leaves,
[1:58:08] Lord, makes me more homesick.
[1:58:12] Lord, my heart is pulled to go
[1:58:15] there, but I know it's of more a benefit
[1:58:18] to your people if I stay here until the
[1:58:21] appointed time. May I serve you
[1:58:24] faithfully, Lord
[1:58:26] God. May I never try to build anything
[1:58:29] for myself. May we as your children
[1:58:31] never get our eyes on us or anything
[1:58:34] about us, but all about you, Lord.
[1:58:38] Maybe there's someone yet that's never
[1:58:40] heard of these things and we're called
[1:58:43] to share
[1:58:44] it. Help us, Lord
[1:58:48] Jesus. We worship you tonight,
[1:58:51] Father. Oh Lord God, maybe there's some
[1:58:55] that's come in this place of the spirit
[1:58:57] of heaviness on them. Lord, I pray in
[1:59:00] the name of Jesus, may they lay that
[1:59:02] aside, Father. May they be able to put
[1:59:05] on a garment of
[1:59:07] praise. Some sick in their bodies, some
[1:59:10] weary, some facing time of question and
[1:59:14] time of decision. Lord, in the name of
[1:59:16] Jesus, would you just minister to the
[1:59:19] needs of your children tonight, Lord, we
[1:59:22] love you, Father, with all of our
[1:59:24] hearts. Oh, we worship you,
[1:59:28] Jesus. We worship you tonight, Lord God.
[1:59:32] If there's any without the assurance of
[1:59:34] the Holy Ghost, I pray you'd make it
[1:59:37] known to them. I know there's some that
[1:59:40] are, Father, because several have talked
[1:59:42] to me in the last few
[1:59:44] months. Just wondering if they have the
[1:59:46] Holy Ghost. Some come up for prayer.
[1:59:49] Even some of our young people, Lord,
[1:59:51] they want to be sure. They want to know.
[1:59:55] Father, oh, I believe in our personal
[1:59:59] matan. That is one of the gifts that's
[2:00:02] there for us is an assurance that we
[2:00:05] have passed from death unto
[2:00:08] life. Lord Jesus, if there's any here
[2:00:11] tonight or that's listening to this or
[2:00:13] will stream it later and dear God, I
[2:00:16] pray you'd make it known. No doubt there
[2:00:18] are people just like the sister that the
[2:00:21] prophet told us about and he said that
[2:00:24] she truly had it. But because of her
[2:00:27] nature, he prayed that you would let her
[2:00:31] either speak in tongues or prophesy
[2:00:33] because of the birth path that she was
[2:00:36] born under. No doubt there's people like
[2:00:38] that today, Lord. But Jesus, I pray
[2:00:41] whatever they need, you'd resolve that
[2:00:44] question,
[2:00:45] Father. Young men, young women, maybe
[2:00:48] older ones, Lord, as well. May the
[2:00:50] spirit of God help
[2:00:52] us, Lord Jesus. May they look in their
[2:00:55] tapestry tonight and as they look may
[2:01:00] the revelation strike their heart
[2:01:02] whether they do or whether they don't.
[2:01:04] If they do it can be resolved they have
[2:01:07] it. If they don't it can be resolved
[2:01:10] they need it. They open up their soul.
[2:01:12] You move into that soul and then there
[2:01:15] it is. It can be just that simple right
[2:01:18] here tonight.
[2:01:19] Lord, we worship you Jesus.
[2:01:23] I want to thank you for all my
[2:01:25] gifts. Oh, I don't tongues and maybe
[2:01:29] discernment and prophecy and what people
[2:01:32] would think are great gifts like that.
[2:01:35] But I have salvation. I have
[2:01:38] sanctification. I have the baptism of
[2:01:40] the Holy Ghost. Oh, hallelujah. I have
[2:01:44] revelation. I have understanding. Thank
[2:01:47] you, Lord Jesus. I have faith, virtue,
[2:01:51] knowledge, temperance. Oh God, you've
[2:01:54] done so much for us. I just want to take
[2:01:57] a little time tonight and say thank you,
[2:01:59] Lord. Thank you, Lord, for all that
[2:02:02] you've done for us, Father. Oh, we
[2:02:05] worship you tonight, Lord. Can we just
[2:02:08] raise our hands for just a few minutes
[2:02:10] before we
[2:02:11] go? Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:02:16] Brother Justin Reagan wanted us to pray
[2:02:19] for him. He started feeling feverish in
[2:02:22] the service tonight. Dear God, we ask
[2:02:24] you right now in the name of Jesus that
[2:02:27] you'd move for Justin. Father, may you
[2:02:30] help him, Lord. May you touch him right
[2:02:32] now. Father, in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:02:35] Lord, Lance also called me this evening.
[2:02:38] They sent him home from work. Father,
[2:02:40] sick, vomiting multiple times. I pray
[2:02:43] that you'd touch his body also, Lord.
[2:02:46] Maybe others that are sick and not
[2:02:48] feeling well, couldn't be in service.
[2:02:50] Maybe some are here tonight and they
[2:02:52] pressed on and they're here. Father,
[2:02:54] whatever their need is, would you
[2:02:56] minister to everyone tonight, Lord?
[2:02:59] Grant, we pray. Father, now before we
[2:03:02] leave, Lord Jesus, we'd like to minister
[2:03:05] back to
[2:03:06] you. We worship you, Lord.
[2:03:10] We've come to praise you, Lord
[2:03:13] Jesus. As the king's daughter, we've
[2:03:16] come to worship the King's
[2:03:19] son. We've come to
[2:03:21] magnify our mate. And truly, there's
[2:03:26] only one in the earth today that could
[2:03:29] be the identified mate of the immaculate
[2:03:33] one, and that would be his own sister of
[2:03:38] the created bloodline of
[2:03:40] God, my sister, my
[2:03:44] spouse. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:48] Because those who are sanctified and he
[2:03:51] who
[2:03:51] sanctified are all of one. Oh Lord
[2:03:56] Jesus, we worship you today.
[2:03:59] Father, we magnify you now. Lord, can we
[2:04:02] just raise our hands? I know you're
[2:04:04] probably tired. You've worked today and
[2:04:05] all that, but I guarantee you if you'll
[2:04:07] give him a little bit of sacrifice and a
[2:04:09] little bit of loving right now, he'll
[2:04:11] definitely make it worth your time.
[2:04:13] Praise the Lord Jesus. Can we whatever's
[2:04:17] on your heart? Hey. Oh,
[2:04:20] hallelujah. We worship you, Lord
[2:04:23] Jesus. We bless your holy name, Father.
[2:04:27] I don't want to wait till I get to
[2:04:29] heaven to scream and holler and shout
[2:04:31] and glorify God. I want to praise you
[2:04:34] right now while I'm in this mortal
[2:04:37] tabernacle. Oh Jesus, I thank you for
[2:04:41] what you mean to me, Lord. I thank you
[2:04:44] for all that you've done. I thank you
[2:04:45] for the work of redemption. I thank you,
[2:04:48] Lord. I worship you tonight,
[2:04:51] Father. We love you, Lord Jesus. Falling
[2:04:55] in love. Hallelujah.
[2:04:57] We love you, Lord Jesus. Jesus.
