hopeless case an empty place if not for Grace oh whole hopeless case an empty place if not for [Music] Grace praise the Lord how many knows that is so true tonight if it wasn't for Gra gra let's um turn to the book of 1 Corinthians if you would chapter 12 verse 12 let's look at a little bit about this grace shall we 1 Corinthians 12:12 for as the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ now I don't want to shock you just coming out of the gate but I want you to look at this with me and so also those four words so also is Christ if you notice Paul doesn't say so also is Jesus but Christ in this verse he's talking about the body of course and he's talking about the body being with many members and also talking about the mystical body and as strange as it may seem to you Paul is actually calling the true Church Christ you see why that stumbles people is because they're identifying the humanity of the Lord Jesus as being Christ but Christos actually means the anointed one so when he went up into heaven then his church became his anointed one so he says he says being many are one body so also is Christ which is the mystical Christ the church he is the savior of his own body look with me in Ephesians 5:23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body the savior of the body he actually accounts himself as not being complete without his church I think you're doing good think think with me he accounts himself as not being complete without his church Ephesians 1:23 which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so the fullness of him the way he looks at it is the church the fullness of him that filth all and all because you see she is the continued revelation of his Divine Life in human form the continued revelation of his Divine Life in human form look at this quote with me before we pray so you see if you were in the forn knowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God and the only way you can be a Son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you praise God has to be that's right because there's only one only one resource of eternal life and that is God and in him alone has eternal life that you were a part of him in so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking at the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives you that little that little tug towards in him that's what has to be quickened don't you see what God did God quickened your tug praise God thank you Lord praise God it gives that little tug towards him and that's what has to be quickened and we'd like to be remembered tonight as we pray me too Lord Jesus these are astounding words to think that there are people standing in this place tonight not only just here but different parts of the world that are in Christ Jesus and they are considered to be part of the mystical Body of Christ himself dear father we struggle to try to look beyond our humanity and our failures and our weaknesses they're with us every day and we know that that we need to be quickened to look beyond our Humanity to be able to see that Divine part that lives in us would you speak to us tonight father remove the veil from our eyes Lord Open the Eyes of our understanding that we can have a greater picture of Grace won't you grant it father in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen God bless you you may be seated the teaching of Paul on this great mystery of God coming into the church is one of the greatest Mysteries of the New Testament it was kept hid down through the ages to the even the sages and the prophets of what God allowed them to see occasionally they would catch a little array of light a little Glimpse and the shadows and the types you have to keep in mind that when God had his word written part of it was going to be written out in Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges Ruth so on and so on but much of it was written in the lives of people and God hid the mystery of much of what he was going to do in the lives of people and they themselves didn't even know that they were doing that and God didn't make an announcement uh this is an announcement to the world Joseph is going down the land of Egypt he'll be a type of me he's going to marry a gentile which would be a type of my bride God never said none of that must have seemed very unusual and very strange neither did God say that in the life of Esther again would be a written the type of his bride because it would seem as if though the Book of Esther wasn't really even that great of a religious book to some of them the Book of Ruth the same way so God chose to write part of what he was going to do in the lives of individual uals but if he chose to write it that way then it convinces me that he's going to reveal that part in the same way so it would be written in the Bible of course it would be written in the message so people would be able to pick it up and read it but those who look for the manifested word to be only in book form or tape form or Bible form will miss so much of what God is doing because he writes it there so we can see it but many times he will reveal it in flesh form the word oh how we love the word don't we we love our Bibles we love the word of God we love to read it but many people do that and they know it by memory and they have studied it for years and years and still Overlook many of the Great Things notice in 1 Corinthians chapter 12: 13 Paul says for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body now remember this word we've looked at it for years and years it is baptismal and this is where John got the name John the Baptist and it was not that his mom and daddy called him that but actually the people did and it was because John was known by the actions that he was doing so he was taking people down in water and baptizing them so they called him John the Baptist but this word also the further meaning of it is that we looked at it years ago I'm sure you've remembered that it goes from changing a cucumber to a pickle so it is baptized into a solution but it doesn't go down for a dip and then come back up but it's actually back baptized into this solution and there it stays until it is changed then it is pulled from the vat a changed being so a cucumber is stuck into this solution left there long enough it transformed from a cucumber to a pickle and it will never go back to being a cucumber again now many people get baptized they get dipped into water and some of them actually get dipped into the spirit of God but what they do is they go down and they get a little dip and then they come back up and they go ahead and live the way they did before now that's the way Elvis was because Elvis had the baptism of the Holy Ghost so in other words Elvis got a dip into the spirit of God and come back up and took his shouting that he learned at the Assemblies of God onto the Rock and Roll concert stage that's where he learned to shake his legs so he did not stay there in the vat and get sealed by the presence of God and change from a cucumber to a pickle I don't know about you I don't want to remain a cc I want to be changed don't you I want to stay in that vet until I am so thoroughly changed that whenever I come out I will be different than what I was when I went in notice how Paul Likens this for he says for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit how unusual this must have been for the Jews to try to comprehend that the Greeks which Corinth was a a pretty large Greek church that the Jews and the Gentiles were now the same no difference they must have really really struggled so Paul is trying to get them to understand once the Gentiles have been dipped into the Vet of the mercy of God they come out of that vet just as righteous before God as Abraham did and more so because the vet took them back before they ever sinned in the first place and then Paul brings it from Just baptism notice how he Likens it for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether it be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been made to drink into two one spirit so what we're doing now is we're actually drinking the baptism solution so you're not just dip down into it and then dry yourself off and then you're just like you were before but actually you're drinking the solution which is keeping you constantly Changed by the grace of God so you see we're still being changed how many knows we're still a work can progress so when we reach the end and we say well I can go no further well I feel sorry for you cuz the only people I know that can go no farther as those that's already passed from this life into the next life but those of us that are still alive we're still drinking of the same solution that changed us when we got the new births and then Paul Likens that that we're drinking he says in to this one spirit so now Paul is trying to break down and show not only to the Jews but of course to the Gentiles knowing that this would be read for many many years thereafter one of the most important teachings that would ever be revealed to the human race of what God actually did so it is more than just God saving a people from their sins but God is going to immerse them into this mystical body called the body of Christ and God is going to change them from John and Jane Doe to where they will no longer just be a sinner out there that's trying to be a better person and live a better life and they're they're reading all types of self-help books and they're getting all types of you know web things and they're learning and learning and they're trying to discipline their s but God is going to take them and dip them into Christ and they will come up a new person now whenever this happens to them he is going to totally transform them from John Doe and Jane Doe and whoever they are until they will actually become one of the anointed ones for the cause of Christ in the last day so they will no longer be a person then that is trying to do good deeds and trying their best to be a righteous person but they will lose their old identity and actually become the anointed one you see all the elect members that are baptized into this mystical Body of Christ now remember the body of the Lord Jesus is is there on the throne of God that was the flesh which was glorified but the Christos remember Jesus body never come back into your soul when you receive the Holy Ghost the body of Jesus is not divided in the sense that I've got a little part of his flesh you got a little part of his flesh people in India have a part look he was only a small man there was not enough physical corporate Al flesh for us to take of that when he gave the symbolism except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life it wasn't talking about his Corporal body he was talking about partaking of the sharing of the life and the opening of the mystery don't you see what happened on the cross it was the opening of The Book of the revealed word the Son of God hanging on the cross God opened up the mystery of the book of redemption of the Lord Jesus and the bride came out so there was not enough Humanity not enough flesh to tear off the peace and give to every one of us that we do in symbolism by taking communion but the Christos the Christ the anointing every child of God around the earth tonight that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost has a portion of the spirit of God if there were 95 billion Christians on the face of the Earth tonight and 95 billion people have the Holy Ghost it would not deplete the spirit of Christ at all now that could not be said about the human body of the Lord Jesus Remember When the human body raised from the dead he could only be at one spot at one time by his Corporal presence You Follow Me by his Corporal presence yet by his omnipotence and his omnipresence by that for knowledge he knew all things at one time but by the Corporal body he could only be there with the disciples he would walk through a wall and then he would disappear well they did no longer see him where was he well he was somewhere else and then he would go somewhere else and then he appeared again in a few days and there he was again so when that Corporal body ascended then the angel said this same Jesus that you see going away will come again in like manner so what are we looking for at the coming of the Lord Jesus that Corporal body is that right but what's here with us tonight Christ the son of God the Holy Spirit but the body the human Temple the Tabernacle that God glorified you see God said this is my part of the earth and from this part I will redeem the rest of it so this was God's own part of the earth that become human and tangible then God hid inside of that body use that body as a veil tore the veil open and release Zoe God's eternal life then the Holy Ghost comes back on the day of Pentecost and starts baptizing individuals into the new form of Christ not the new form of Jesus but the new form of Christ which is the mystical body now the mystical body is in a dimensional world to where our eyes cannot just see it we'll say it this way that every person here tonight that has the Holy Ghost every person in Indiana Ohio Guatemala Honduras India New Zealand Africa all over the world every one of them are baptized into one body yet many of them we will never know we will never see them we'll never Shake our hand but they're baptized into a spiritual realm and it's only one body and yet all of us identified with the atonement I want you to notice now that body is not actually identified as Word of Life or even like Tabernacle or you know whatever that the church name would be it's not identified as Word of Life evening light it's not identified as brandom Tabernacle some other Tabernacle it's identified actually as Christ you see this is why he's so selective of who he will baptize into the juice cuz if they stay in there long enough they are his and they are sealed so if they've got lying and rotness and adultery and filth and whatever more and he leaves them in that vat that is sealed in them and will be in them in heaven so it's not everybody that says Lord Lord not even everybody that can do wonders and miracles because they can have a dip into the spirit of God and have even gifts and still not have their soul immersed in changed to a pickle so he's very selective and very precautious of whom he will give this seal too but all of those that get it are baptized into Christ himself so when them Believers come before God In Prayer God is not so much hearing their voice but the voice of the Lamb of God amen cuz your prayers are coming up through the blood of the Lord Jesus so notice in the elect of God being members in that mystical body called Christ are actually identified as Christ body and therefore they are partaking of perfect righteousness so it's not that God takes an element of righteousness out of the Lord Jesus and gives you a little bit and you a little bit and you a little bit me a little bit you brothers and you sisters and those of you that are streaming the service we got that backwards it's not that he's taking a little bit out and giving you a little part what he's doing is taking you out of the world and actually immersing you into the body of righteousness itself which is Christ Jesus that's the only way that we could be sinless enough to be able to go into a Rapture in him we are identified as as blameless because if it's just a deposit put in us then if we had a bad week or a couple of bad weeks and we had one mistake after another another mess up after another before long our righteousness is going to be pretty much watered down don't you think unless he takes your soul and immerses your soul into this great Fountain of ocean of righteousness itself then it's not your little part pulled out from the mystical body you are actually immersed into the body and when God looks at the body he sees what Christ Jesus and God sees the Son of God himself so God actually saves people by transferring them into Christ this is the kind of eternal security I believe in wo so when God Saves them sanctifies them fills them with a holy ghost seals them into the presence of God he releases them from their former identity and transfers them actually into the mystical Body of Christ and from there There Is No Escape and they don't want to anyway and he identifies them as Christ and making them in fact to be Christ that don't get in your mind Jesus now remember that's the human body what is Christ the anointed one so it makes them of a Heavenly nature and this great Heavenly plan man must become truly righteous before God so how in the world can we be standing here on the day of the Rapture and we we got Sinners all around us we got our Humanity we've got failures our mistakes tell me what can God ever do that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye take us out of a place as filthy and rotten as this world is and immediately transfer us into a new body and transfer us into heaven and one minute you're walking down south rone and there's drunks over here and there's homeless over there and there's Liars over there and everywhere around you sin everywhere and then the next step you take you're right there in the presence of of the Lord Jesus how in the world could how in the world could he ever get us all mistake free for five seconds around the whole world at one time in order to say okay I've got everybody perfect angels hold your breath hold your breath one of us would mess up the whole program sure as there's a God in heaven and if it wasn't you all it be me but I imagine some of you would be just as bad as I would don't sit there and look at me like a bu the Holy Angels now but what if God could immerse and dip us into the Vet of Christ himself then in that he does not look at our mistake but brother Bram I have so many things about me that I'm know not right but sister Georgie that's why he died so your mistakes would not be lotted to you he SE your heart and he knows don't you understand if you're sinking you're ever going to get to a spot that you're human flesh you're going to perfect it forget it the word of God nor the message of the hour does not teach human Perfection of your flesh it is your enemy it is an animal it is against the word of God come on somebody you'll never get good enough you'll never stay clean enough you'll never be holy enough on the outside but the key is for God to transfer your being and your identity out of mortality and place you in the mystical body and hide you so deep in Christ the devil can't even find [Music] [Applause] you so by this plan God changes you from being John Doe to becoming Christ everybody still alive you okay okay all right watch this remember remember he became you that you might become he became a sinner separated from the father when he screamed my God why H has Thou forsaken me he was separated from God in his death that you in your deaths might have God's presence isn't that awesome what a loving savior what Grace has been given to us so he died alone out of the presence of God and become a curse a serpent hanging on the pole out of the presence of God angels turning their backs on him the spirit of God could not even behold him because he could not look upon sin and he become a sinner Prophet said the worst sinner that ever lived on the earth I remember it was not because of what he did how was this how was this even possible he never said one thing wrong he never did one thing wrong but he became me that was all he had to do to become a bad sinner was become me then you add me and you and you and you and you and everybody else on top of that so it wasn't what he did it's what he become oh I hope and pray that God will drop that Revelation inside of your heart tonight don't you understand that he did that Hallelujah because he loved us it was not what he did it's what he became when are you and I ever going to understand it's not what we do it's what we become what do we become the very righteousness of God in him oh okay brother Donnie so I can do whatever I want to yep I drink all I want to drink I lie all I want to lie I commit adultery all I want to commit adultery I just don't want to do those things why because I have been changed by the power of God and if Jesus is inside of me and inside of you Jesus don't want to Comm at adulter Jesus don't want to lie Jesus don't want to cheat Jesus believes his [Applause] word listen to these next words he become a child of sin your sins not his own yours that you might become a child of obedience a't that awesome there's no way we could be children of obedience we were born after the fall in the Garden of Eden it comes by nature for us to disobey God it's just in our flesh we cannot help that and he knew that so he must come to change us the law could never do it the prophets could never do it the reading of the law and memorizing them could never do it there must be a nature change every lamb in the Old Testament they could be able to lay their hands on the lamb and The Sinner would maybe go up to the altar with the lamb and put his hands over on it knowing that it signified a transferring of his sins upon the lamb and they'd take the knife and cut the Lamb's throat the hot blood would spew out and the worshipper would have the blood on his hands and he would walk out of there maybe the same day do the very same sin he' got forgiveness of that morning and God knew them Lambs could never replace the Fallen nature of man so what did God do God bottled up this great Hallelujah this great power of forgiveness and mercy and righteousness and God put it in this vat called Jesus Christ and God opened it up Hallelujah and said then if you'll come to me and be baptized into me and drink drink I will transform you from a church member into a holy ghost filled son or daughter of God just drink when do I stop brother Donnie don't never stop keep on drinking keep on drinking of the good Holy Ghost how many knows we need a good drink oh then what does God do then God places us into the mystical body and we are ready for our position in Christ Jesus I know a lot of folks in the message are waiting for the adoption time to come and some of the things they're looking for is actually going to be in the Millennium forget controlling the clouds forget controlling the storms forget all that stuff I'm more focused on control this 16 elements right here than I am the clouds yes sir I don't like riding in clouds and I'm flying of course I don't like storms any of that sort of thing but really it ain't them things that get me in that much trouble it's this old boy right here I figure if I could get to a spot I can control this right here I'll be in pretty good shape and I believe by the grace of God that's what he wants to happen in our lives by the word now you see once we're baptized in into the mystical body then God also places Us by his grace in a a local assembly to where we can find also our position in that assembly oh aren't you glad that it doesn't just start in the Supernatural realm now that's why a lot of folks tell well I'm in Christ and now I'm in there I don't have to do anything I don't have to put forth no effort I don't really have to go to church or anything like that where in the words you get that at you don't find that in the Bible and you sure don't find the message of the hour but God places Us in the body that we can minister to others and that we also can be ministered too look friend I don't care how great the preacher is you and preachers need to be ministered to as well you understand that sometimes when brother Brandon would be at home in his own Tabernacle that he would let brother Neville preach he actually even let brother Lee Vale preach and he would let other brothers preach and brother Bram I mean time after time when brother Neville would preach he said I certainly enjoyed that this morning I felt led to have brother Neville to preach I got so many sermons out of what our brother said oh my goodness you mean brother Brandon needed to hear from another preacher yeah you know there's a lot of angelist in their message and they say they have a home church but they're never home at their Church they're constantly gone here gone there they never hear nobody else preach but themselves but I tell you one thing they must like hearing their s a whole lot more than I enjoy hearing me I need to be preached to myself I ain't talking about just from tapes I need to hear other men of God preach to me come on somebody why because I also need to receive as well as give you give and give and give but you've also got to have an intake from the presence of God and that's the thing I'm afraid there's so many Miss well you know I don't know I don't feel apart well why don't you feel apart why don't you feel apart find an assembly somewhere where God positionally places you under a Ministry of the hour that's really preaching the word that'll give you a body change and find what God want wants you to do but brother Donnie I can't sing I ain't never spoke in tongues I don't ever prophesy well maybe God wants you to pray for them that do sing and God wants you to pray for them that do prophesy and God wants you to pray for them preachers that's out on the field everybody has something they can do to minister to the body and everybody said watch now in verse 14 for the body is not one member but many now can you imagine here tonight if I was a six foot nose no fingers no eyes no toes no legs just one gigantic nose Lord have mercy the nostrils would be that big around wouldn't he my nose is big and ugly enough the way it is I can't imagine being a six- foot nose but that's the way some folks have it oh I don't need to go to church I don't need this I don't need that how you doing remember the nose so you're just a 5 foot portly little uh little nose huh or or you're you're a big eyeball or you're you're just one you're one finger you're six foot one finger and you know I I really don't need anybody I'm not sure where you get that concept because that's not from the Bible Paul never said that it's just one member only but it's a whole mystical body but has all types of different members that are everyone essential to the other for the body is it's not one member but many so the different parts are needed in the body for it to be a body to be able to exist so no believer should ever look ATS and the gift that God gave them as being inferior to another remember our gifts our abilities and what God has given to us they're not d by us they're not even asked for okay God I'd like to have this I want that I want to make a multiple choice I go down through and I'll check all the boxes of the things I want that's not the way it happens God gives them to us so whenever we say well I'm useless I'm of no value do you know what you're doing you are saying God don't know what he was doing when he placed you in the body so does God make mistakes anybody believe that anybody believe that God makes mistakes well why should we accuse him and say well you know I'm just not important ain't hard even nobody knows me by name and I don't never sing I don't ever get up before everybody I I don't know I I I guess I just ain't nobody don't never say that if God placed you as part of us and God placed you as part of this end time message it was him that placed you not yourself so your gift your position is not inferior Hallelujah to another and therefore we should not even be jealous if people would look at it in the right way it would eliminate jealousy there'd be no need for jeal why are people jealous they're jealous of other singers or other musicians or other preachers but if they could just be satisfied that God made them to be a little pinky oh don't you love that little fell oh man ain't he a good little thing to have now can you imagine if your thumb was out there if you had two thumbs wouldn't that really be weird wouldn't it be really strange if your longest finger was right there wouldn't it be really weird if your toe was up here and your this finger right here was down when your foot goes you talking about some of y'all crippling to come to church so what's the matter brother doy what in the world's going on it's that little finger on the foot you say your little finger on your foot well that's the way some people try to do spiritually they want to manipulate the body of god let's just leave it the way God made it it'll work just fine your shoes will fit fine your imagine you go to put on a pair of gloves and you got five big toes on one hand you going into a glove store you go to mahomies you go to targets you go to Walmart I'm looking for a special pair of gloves okay so what do you need I need a pair of gloves that has five big toes on one hand and then I need another glove on the other side that has five noses on one hand because I rearranged myself so I did not like my toes bend down there're hidden do you understand my toes are hidden almost all the time I don't go barefooted NOP I don't wear sandals I don't own a pair of them things I tell car it's a good thing I didn't live in the days of Jesus cuz I don't never got around nowhere having to wear sandals this Cowboy don't wear sandals so you imagine taking them toes and say you know what I think my toes are so pretty I I'm going to go to the doctor and I'm going to say sir I want you to rearrange me I want I want you to transfer these fingers down here to my foot and I'm getting tired of these here toes you see these toes right here I'm sick a tired of going to church ain't nobody ever sees my toe except the brother that washes my feet every now and then when we have foot washing it Ain it ain't right it just ain't right people don't even know if I've got one toe two toe three toe five toe they don't even know my toes are never even seen I'm sick and tired of my gallbladder being hid in my body I want to have my ear tuck off and my gall better stuck on the side of my head well I do hope if you do that you set in the back cuz even the preacher is going to have a hard time keep from staring at you with that bouncy thing hanging on the side of your head makes a lot of sense don't well you laugh at it naturally but we do it spiritually amen yes sir God don't have hazly pour out his gifts you see if we would seek to please God half as much as we would want to please ourself I guarantee you we'd be a whole lot better off wouldn't we now see I knew if y'all knew that we was going into this part when that other good deep part was up I knew y'all really be rejoicing you'd really be pulling if you knew what was following I knew the Lord was just pulling you all in so he could pull you in really good and kiss you on the forehead and then smack you he does that sometimes only oh my notice 1 Corinthians 12:19 if they were all one member where were the body now remember this setting is the Corinthian Church and the Christians at Corinth had received an abundance of spiritual gifts but they were lacking in spiritual Graces gifts and graces are not the same thing the kind of Christian character that the holy ghost wanted them to have now boy you talking about gifted these folks were gifted oh yeah but the spirit of God kept wanting for them to come on up a little higher in their character and I imagine some of them you know when they got the letter there from Paul in Corinth about speaking in tongues maybe prophecy and all that no don't you imagine as your be as them Corinthians were they was some of them said I'll tell you one thing I I I don't like that I don't like that old church order stuff I think maybe our church in Corinth is kind of sovereign on its own I believe Paul's a prophet all right but I don't think we have to do all that sort of stuff why who in the world ever heard of limiting speaking in tongues and all that sort of thing but two no more than three in one Ser who ever heard of such a thing why in the world would you limit the spirit of God what do you think church what do you think Corinthian Believers don't you think that we're a sovereign body and we will pick out of this letter even though it's got our name wrote on it but we will pick out what we St Paul when he was under the anointing we'll go through them verses and we'll pick out what he was under the anointing and then the other verses we'll just say well we're we're Sovereign in our church and uh we we we just don't think we need it we're not going to operate here in our church that way you see the folks in the message who do the message that way they would have done the same thing in the days of Paul cuz the prophet of God said whenever he did all of that he said that's exactly the way they did it in the scripture and that's exactly the way Paul did it come on now well that's what he said now they had this m they were so gifted and I honestly can't say that I understand how gifts and that sort of thing work in that God will let the gifts be poured out upon a people whose character doesn't quite match it you know in my thinking I would do something totally different I'd wait till everybody's perfect which means nobody ever have any right but notice what he said there in verse 20 but now are they many members get one body so you see when the members can recognize that they themselves actually promote pray for and desire a Unity not only in the mystical body but a unity in the local assembly and will it be a struggle to have yep and not only that a greater struggle to keep because they realize their dependence on the other people they go to church with you see those who don't think they need that they miss this from the scripture and from the message so it's like they gained this Independence and they're you know they're totally separated from the rest of the body they don't need nobody they don't need to go to church they don't need to sing well I I I I just take my gift of singing and I sing to me on the Lord in the shower well that's good I mean does the shower clap its hands and everything and just rejoice when you're singing there to it and really so who are you blessing besides you who are you benefiting who are you ministering to besides yourself well go ahead and say it nobody so you're going to answer to God for an unused gift because you refuse to get into a church somewhere and benefit the body somebody said but those who realize the dependence the dependence that they need one another they look at it totally different they don't look at going to church and trying to find you know oh I'll tell you one thing our church has got so many people and that's got flaws of course they do that's why you're so welcome here honey come on now don't sit there and look at me like a little bunch of angels I go to C and you been one of them kind that rides in motorcycles but real true mystical members of the body promote the dependence of one another listen to me Church there is no church that is complete on its own without even having other fellowship with other churches and other ministers am you become isolated you become so self centered everything becomes about you and you watch a preacher that pulls people off just to himself you mark my word and remember it he's leaving God's word God never does such a thing what but happen to an organ in your body if it did that now most of you of course are aware of Auto and immune diseases are you not and there's over a hundred of them that they have identified by name and symptoms and so on and of course most of them will attack the body itself so they begin from within something something triggers something within the body and the body will go to attacking itself and it goes to releasing these soldiers and they somehow they miscommunicate a message inside the body and the body begins to see something inside the body and it begins to say that's an enemy that's an enemy and the body will go to attacking itself that ain't just so in the Natural Body it's happened for 2,000 years in God's spiritual body as well so then members of the body will go to attacking the body itself and then the body will turn against itself sometimes it's a rash sometimes it's it's the organ it can be so many different things and they've got to find a medication they've got to find something that'll reprogram that attack because you have quite a defense system built inside of you and there ain't nobody can attack you like a message preacher believe me I know I've been attacked for years I actually think that's part of my call I think God has to have preachers that can be hated run down lied on and being able to forgive granted Lord if that's what you want me for I'm here reporting for Duty some of you saying well God only wants people to walk on water raise the dead and heal the sick well maybe that's your call there's other people that's going to display the Forgiveness of the Lord Lord Jesus the way some miracle workers have no clue some great shouters that can shout their shoels off that's the way the Corinthian folks folks were man they were so gifted but they had such problems with divisions I'm a Paul I'm a cus I'm of this I'm of that oh my well I'll tell you one thing amen it's about like Ken's teeth tonight Ain they brother Fred would you please say man I'll give you a nickel Life Church if you will so you see diversity in the body is evidence displayed of the wisdom of God so every singer every person that preaches every Deacon every trustee all of that shows the diversity of God in the body and it displays his wisdom let me have just a little bit more time before we St can we now notice in verse 21 and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee so look here now my eyes looking at this orange Clementine body armor my brain is telling me I'm sweating I'm thirsty now my hands are limited because my eye has said to my hands I don't need you oh my so let's see my eye pick it up you get the story now my mouth can pick it up but I can't drink it or I could do this and this is really deep everybody with me here we go I'm going to release these long fingers my eye sees it now but my eyes says lips I don't need you no no no no you big fat lip thing you don't don't you dare pull it how stupid don't you see when God puts us together he puts us together to accomplish so many things and how much more could be done if these worked together or I could be all Al that's why some folks are the only aspect of the minist they want are the eyes the prophet they don't want no Pastor they don't want no teacher no evangelist come on somebody then you've got other folks in the message all they want is just their Pastor own it they don't want no that well if brother Donnie ain't going it's another Dollywood weekend we're going out of town they're just as bad as the eye people are but you know what if God put teachers in the church I'd say we need them if God put evangelists in the church I say we need them if God gave me a hand I need it God gave me an eye I need it come on somebody if God placed you in a body you are important and nobody can take your place the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of Thee the higher cannot dispense of the Lord now are there members in our body naturally and in our body spiritually that vary in degree of course they are notice Paul says in verse 22 nay much more those members of the body which we seem to be more feeble are necessary look at that word more needful what one cannot do without so they seem to be more feeble than others so they're not they don't consist of a bony material so you look at your heart how many bones are in it how many is in your brain or some of you been called bone head before but actually there ain't no bones in your brain look how vulnerable your brain is what if God only surrounded it with fatty tissue down here like your belly is what did God do with that brain the control s Center he put it inside of a skull why it's so vulnerable yet you can't breathe you can't blink you can't think you can't operate without it and itself is so vulnerable God had to put it inside this sheath called a skull don't you understand no matter how great the preacher is how great a Ministry any man's got he still has an element of vulnerability about him and God may choose some of you to try to get around that man and try to pray for him and nudge him along if there's anybody that's going to be discouraged I'll tell you one thing it's going to be a preacher especially a pastor I left here Sunday and I told girl I hope I hope I'll be able before too long to be able to sit down and quit preaching and quit dealing with people's problems and people's issues and people's complaints she said you think that'll ever happen I said no but I can hope all L some of you skulls help me some of you bone head so you see God doesn't put everything in behind the skull but some things he takes a tissue a muscle a senu and he wraps around it oh my and yet these are necessary look at your main torso look at at your heart in order to do open heart surgery what do they do they take a saw and cut you right here and open that up pull that rib cage apart in order to get to your heart CA your heart the pump but if God would have put your heart down here with no bones no caves to protect it anybody come up and hit you right in the belly and boy your heart but stop and yet it's so important and yet so vulnerable I hope somebody is hearing me tonight I know some of y'all sitting there right now trying to figure out if you're a large intestine or a small intestine or if you're trying to figure out what in the world am I don't make yourself sick now let's just let's just go on to the spiritual side remember if God placed you in the body of Christ that there is no one that can take your place I'm going to drive that home tonight and you may get sick of hearing me say it but there ain't nobody in this church can take your place you may never climb up on this platform and sing a song you may never stand up here and testify but if God plac you Among Us my brother sister you are needed and nobody will ever take your place not only here but walking down streets of gold he has got a place for you he's got a mention for you a body waiting and you are important to God and if you're important to God you're important to [Applause] us actually there's parts of our body we can live if they were removed so if something happen happened to my arm and I had to have it amputated from here down I wouldn't like it but I could live without it right you ever had or heard of anybody having their brain amputated as many of few folks I've talked to that I have wondered that before I mean I'm just kidding can you imagine having your heart amputated you can have toes removed you can have legs removed I saw a picture of the other day of a man who had the world's first head transplant the whole head you ever see the picture of the man who got the first face transplant so there's things you could live without but there's things about us that we cannot survive without let me ask you this who do we pray the most for the sick or the well huh that's why some of y'all don't pray for me no more you you think I'm well all the time you think I'm up on the mountain all the time you ought to come live with me for four or five days you'd realize I ain't on the mountain all the time you'd realize a little bit of the burden that Carol and I pack you'd pray for us a whole lot more fervent than you do but you're thinking oh brother Donnie has breakfast with angels I don't even like breakfast oh he must just soar in Heavenly places I do do that but you not believe the devil's out of hell that I have to fight when I come down either you know what I'm talking about you all do the same thing except I just do it in a different degree that's all it's the same thing and yet we think well brother boy brother Daryl he must be man alive these preacher Brothers a must just be up on the mountain all the time if you only knew so we tend to pray for those that would say well poor brother so and so you know he's got this bad lumbago and got this that other a lot of folks that's not just their lomago it's their attitude and that's they're always down the bot you know always down on the bottom never nothing nothing nothing ever good everything is always so bad and we take that person how are you brother glory to God Hallelujah I'm more than a conqueror I'm an overcomer in Christ Jesus say well I don't need to pray for that guy he's on the mountain every time I see don't you understand whenever you see an actor don't you understand whenever you're running into somebody whose confession is more powerful than the negativity that they're in and we will take that but sometimes God ever put it on your heart to pray for somebody that you think is so strong and you think why in the world am I praying for that person they are so strong well God knows that strong person needs a whole lot of extra prayer at the time notice Paul said those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor to place around to set about to put on a garment or to put or bind a thing around another so those which we consider to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and honor uncomely Parts have more abundant comeliness huh so in other words we put clothes on parts of our body that we consider uncomely and not supposed to be seen in public uhhuh uhhuh now it's easy to see but the L to say AIDS apparently they don't consider much of their body uncomely cuz theyve just about took everything off but you see those who s modest and if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you are modest but you realize that parts of your body are to be covered why because of the uncomn but when you look at it in the right way you put more abundant Honor on those parts by putting clothing on it amen so you pay $150 for a suit you brothers are $29.95 for slacks oh I'm sorry I need to update that sh they because of inflation now $21 slacks have come from China four years ago now it's worth $75 and they're they're less quality uh and because of that then you put that $75 pair of pants or dress whatever it is sister and you will cover up that part which you consider uncomely which should not be seen in public and you put and people say what a pretty dress well brother that is the nicest suit I really like that shirt that tie looks so nice anybody ever tell you what nice skin you've got on your finger that is some of the prettiest skin I believe I ever seen in my life but watch what'll happen in the winter time and say you find your a real pretty black pair of gloves sisters and they got them little fancy pearls on the side of it and and sisters will see you out there at the door you come in and say them the Prest gloves well they didn't say nothing about your hands what is what's it doing so whenever we put it on there what's it for it's we are hiding because of modesty something that we know feel like needs to be covered up and then when we do that it actually brings more honor upon the uncom part if folks can only get that right about dressing right and dressing Godly and dressing holy don't you understand when you do that look how God looks at it my daughters are doing exactly what I want them to do and I will give them more glory and more honor praise the Lord oh Hallelujah so you see by doing that we make it that way now remember of course this is the first century whenever this is being written and the Pagan world was awful absolutely awful especially in the sports Arenas now Rome was famous of course and I've stood in some of those Arenas around the world built by the ancient Romans and when they would wrestle many times they would take off every Stitch of their clothes because it was heathenism to do it in public hello testing one two testing one to so you imagine then how that some of these were former Gentiles these Corinthians and Paul is telling them about dressing and hair and so on and they're thinking what in the world this was so different than in the way they were raised because they were raised so they would go to a Roman Coliseum and many of those Gladiators and so on I mean they be Stark naked out there wrestling and carrying on why heathenism it was part of the entertainment must be some Romans in Hollywood well praise the Lord my goodness friends you know what I'm talking about you can't even hard to walk up to a Walmart cash you know to be able to pay out in the cash register without nudity to being expressed on the magazine don't sit there and look at me like you don't what I'm talking about why it's everywhere it's all around us everywhere why a billboard there's only one way you can look up where you don't see and that's up this way why because people don't see it they just don't understand there's no modesty there's no difference between right and wrong and being able to to see it you're so blessed if you do verse 24 and we'll close for our comely Parts have no need huh so our comely Parts have no need so what do you think said I start coming out like this I tell Carol all the time I've told her years ago I need me a mask so whenever I go out I don't get seen by everybody you don't know what it's like to go through a drive-thru and people say I've seen you before my face is ugly okay but it's the only one I've got I'm not handsome like some of you brothers so I'm just stuck with what I have so you pray for my wife for that cause of course but apparently there's no immodesty about me showing this thing and you're wondering how not how could you not be but because of that I do not need to cover it I know the government said that we should wear them mask and they done proved it over and over again it's like a bumblebee flying through a woen wire fence come to find out all it done was smothered us all and choked us down real bad but our Comm Parts have no need for God hath tempered the body together having give more abundant honor to that which lacked look at the word tempered to mix together cingle unite call several parts to combine into an organic structure which is the body to unite one thing to another wow so God calls us the great the mighty and those which don't seem very important at all God co- mingles them together and puts them in one unit called the ministry God does the same thing in the church God does many times the same thing in a family look at Abraham great Abraham patriarchal face look at Isaac son of a great man father of a great man but Isaac not so much right so here is a man that we hardly have enough you ever notice that there's no no Hollywood don't even make movies about Isaac himself there's not much to say about him it'd be about a 15minute movie it' be about all this but look at Abraham one after another after another Jacob Joseph look at all them but you know what God has Isaac's slid in between Abraham's and Jacob's but was Isaac necessary yet God wrote The Mystery of his life about him and the bride was Isaac and Rebecca praise be to God and you may look at yourself and say well I'm not a great person I no but you might be the mother or the father of a great person or the grand mother of a grandfather something like that of a great person and yet God tied you right in that seed line oh I've never really done much for God but you might be the very one that would testify to somebody about the message of the hour and that one man would come to God and he' be called to preach and maybe lead 10,000 to Jesus Christ and when he stands there that day guess who's going to stand by you are because you packed the word to him and you God used you to help open his eyes and God would incorporate your name with those 10,000 that were saved somebody that was seemingly unnecessary overlooked not really important in the body if God put you in the body you are important let me read one more verse I didn't say I was done I just told you to stand up that's all for our commy parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked verse 25 that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care for one another look at this powerful powerful word Schism division a rent metaphorically it's a division or A dissension H how does that work exactly why would God why would Paul write that after saying that about the body because if you got people in the body they feel like they're not being used and they're don't don't amount to much they become Restless then an opportunist will try to get among them and offer them a position don't necessarily mean it's a god position but just a position I've seen it for years people will walk away from the word of God from a church that's preaching the word and preaching rapturing message and will trade off to get a position in a church that will not get them 6 Ines off the ground but position to many people is Everything Jesus didn't say man shall live by position but man shall not live by bread but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now for me I'd rather go to church if I was in the will of God and I sat there and nobody hard even knew my name I wouldn't hardly recognized by the Deacon board the trustee board or no other board but that's where God put me and I clapped my hands and I sang and I did everything maybe I couldn't even be a special singer CU I was off key half the time but I'd rather be that than to be in the biggest church and the preacher calling my name and me his best best buddy and best pal to be where God wants me to be what's it worth my friends what's it worse don't you love him tonight again Romans 16:17 Paul said I beseech you Brethren mark them which caus divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which he have learned a lot of people have never learned these last three words and avoid them you mean that were already starting then that actually started before Paul ever wrote This Book of Romans around 63 ad so it had started 30 years prior to that already and Satan is still doing the same thing today he'll try to do it in your home he'll try to do it in your job he loves division you notice how it is maybe one person in in the section where you're working and they just constantly have got something going all the time you get that settled and they do something else some people never live in peace I've got the answer why because they do not have peace within themselves and you watch trouble people troubled people have one thing in common whether red white black yellow pink purple polka doted or green and white striped they all have one thing in common troubled people cause trouble they generate it I'm not talking about a person that gets into trouble and gets out and learns by it but troubled people constantly generate trouble and you get one thing fixed and they call something else if you get that fixed they call something else it's just like they're a Dynamo of trouble Jesus said blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called children of God you ever find a beatitude where He blesses troublemakers whether it's in a family or a church or a shop or whatever it is you never find a beatitude for the troublemakers wouldn't you love for that to be your identity blessed are the peacemakers he never did say blessed are the handsome blessed are the pretty blessed are the wealthy but blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God to me you couldn't be called nothing no greater oh don't you love him tonight let bow our it together oh Father how we love you we thank you Lord for your spirit how you've pulled us into the body and made us part of that great Union the mystical Christ then Lord we don't want to just focus on that alone but we also want to find out our position in the local body in the local assembly May every person here tonight and those that have streamed the service may they be able to accept and realize you have always had degrees and your Prophet tells us there will be degrees in heaven it won't bother people then because the part that bothers us now will be absent there so there will be people that will be recognized as more beneficial on the earth we know whenever the rewards are given out it will reflect that diversity Lord I pray you'd help each of us that we can find our spot in the body and be happy with it Lord Oh Lord God I I ask for every man woman boy and girl that we can be used by you Lord not for our purpose for our desire but for the economy of God I think Lord if we could all just fall more in love with you a lot of these things would disappear anyway because we would just love you so much your Prophet tells us in the church book Church age book that you may appoint some to death you appoint others to suffer and go through so much stuff but that is your prerogative to do so there are some that will go through such suffering in this life some will pray and believe and expect miracles but instead you'll take them out of this life with the sickness or the disease that they dealt with for years others they'll be prayed for you'll grant them healing but there's got to be somebody that can be able to express that attribute that you expressed when you come to the Earth your character was perfected by suffering not by Miracles not by signs not by screaming running and we believe in all of that but your character was perfected by suffering help us Lord God that we can find that place you want us to be and may we stay so in the Divine solution of God that we don't just get a little dip and we go down a dry cucumber and come up a wet one but we go down a dry cucumber and come up a pickle forever changed by the power of God we love you Jesus we wor worship you father praise the Lord how many would say with me tonight Lord I just want to be what you want me to be it don't matter whether it's big or little or small or significant or insignificant Hallelujah We Worship You Lord we praise you Jesus we praise you Jesus thank you thank you Lord can we just raise our hands at his presence start that song for Harry that one tell me his name again they tell me of Love Sweet old [Music] story
