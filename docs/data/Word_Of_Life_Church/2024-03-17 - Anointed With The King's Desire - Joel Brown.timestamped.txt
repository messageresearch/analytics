[36:49] make it act and do like it did before so
[36:52] you have a job to do this word will be
[36:55] dormant will be lifeless and you are
[36:58] inspired by
[37:00] it is that true amen praise the Lord
[37:05] amen my it's just a lot to bring this
[37:08] morning a lot to say and and I don't
[37:11] even know how to say it but I'll just
[37:12] say it the way that I'm able and you all
[37:15] receive it the way that you receive it
[37:18] and then if it catches in you you'll be
[37:20] resoundingly saying amen amen praise the
[37:23] Lord I believe God's going to do
[37:24] something special today for some someone
[37:28] maybe it's you maybe it's me but I'm
[37:31] under
[37:32] expectation amen while you're standing
[37:34] if you will turn with me to 2 Samuel and
[37:37] I'm always forgetting something when I
[37:39] go out and and and Minister I forgot my
[37:41] reading glasses uh once again so uh but
[37:44] I believe I believe I'll be able to see
[37:46] sufficient enough but um you would think
[37:48] I'd be able to see already I have two
[37:50] pair of contacts in so that should be
[37:52] magnification enough but sometimes the
[37:55] devil likes to work in ways that
[37:58] caus us to pack on a little more amen 2
[38:01] Samuel 23 and 13 beginning at
[38:07] 13 and while I'm here and thinking about
[38:10] it I'll just go and get this out the way
[38:12] I'll look at my watch for those of you
[38:14] who think I'm worried about it okay I'll
[38:17] just go ah and say this in
[38:20] closing it's done all right I'm I'm
[38:23] closing right now so so you won't be
[38:26] worried about it 2 Samuel
[38:29] 23:13 and three of the 30 Chief went
[38:32] down and came to David in the Harvest
[38:34] Time unto the cave of adulam and the
[38:37] troop of the Philistines pitched in the
[38:39] valley of
[38:40] reim verse 14 and David was then in an
[38:44] hold and the Garrison of the Philistines
[38:46] was then in Bethlehem verse 15 and David
[38:50] loded longed and said oh that one would
[38:53] give me drink of the water of The Well
[38:57] of Beth Bethlehem which is by the gate
[39:01] verse 16 and the three Mighty Men break
[39:03] through the host of the Philistines and
[39:06] Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem
[39:08] that was by the gate and took it and
[39:11] brought it to David nevertheless he
[39:13] would not drink thereof but poured it up
[39:15] out unto the Lord let us pray Heavenly
[39:18] Father we thank you dear God for your
[39:21] many wonderful blessings and we thank
[39:24] you for your word we thank you for the
[39:28] anointing that rests within us we thank
[39:32] you for the anointing that rests upon
[39:34] your word and father as I was just
[39:36] referring to the quote father we thank
[39:38] you for inspiration because sometimes we
[39:41] come to the house of God Church the
[39:44] Tabernacle where Living Waters are
[39:46] flowing and we've got so much going on
[39:49] and we've we we've got so much traveling
[39:51] through our brains that it's hard to be
[39:54] inspired but father God I pray that you
[39:57] take each and every individual that's in
[40:00] this place today those that are
[40:02] listening in by way of the internet
[40:04] father those that will pick it up later
[40:06] father maybe they're down maybe they're
[40:08] low maybe they're they're burdened down
[40:10] with a besetting sin or something that's
[40:13] in their life that's troubling them in
[40:14] such a way that they take more
[40:17] identification in what they've done and
[40:20] what people have said about them than
[40:21] what your very word tells them that they
[40:24] really who they really are so Lord they
[40:26] can't break through through into that
[40:27] inspiration but father I pray that you
[40:30] would just anoint us oh God to receive
[40:34] that inspiration from on high to receive
[40:36] something in this word that will cause
[40:39] us to be inspired to go out and live
[40:42] this word in such a way that we would
[40:44] illuminate a path of someone that has no
[40:47] idea that they have a genan seed of God
[40:50] within them God we love you and we thank
[40:53] you for this opportunity we thank you
[40:55] for our space in the building and father
[40:57] we've created a place now may you come
[41:00] and fill it with your presence and it's
[41:03] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[41:06] amen you may have your
[41:09] seats it's quiet in
[41:12] here we got to stir something up amen
[41:16] amen do you love him amen do you love
[41:19] his word are you going with him has he
[41:22] done something for
[41:25] you amen I want to to take our thoughts
[41:28] if we can just for a moment while we're
[41:31] here
[41:33] and God has called you to be my audience
[41:41] today and it's up to me to be earnestly
[41:47] sincere got a quote for
[41:50] that it's not me being bold or anything
[41:53] so therefore and with that being so it's
[41:56] up to you to be earnestly sincere to
[41:58] receive this
[42:00] word many times people want to place all
[42:02] the obligation and responsibility in
[42:04] this spot right
[42:06] here but actually it's more so the
[42:09] responsibility out there because you all
[42:11] are the ones that operate the
[42:14] gift it's the man's job to just simply
[42:17] get out the
[42:18] way
[42:20] sir but if we can just take a little bit
[42:23] of time as we were reading this this
[42:25] scripture just as a point of reference
[42:27] as a as a as a as a point of inspiration
[42:30] Anointed with the king's
[42:34] desire now we hear a lot about these
[42:36] these three Mighty Men and and and what
[42:39] they did these Warriors that that stood
[42:41] there with David and and and quite
[42:43] frankly they were three of 30 that that
[42:46] were Mighty but they just happened to be
[42:48] there on that day and you just happen to
[42:51] be here this day on this this day to
[42:54] receive this word to hear what God has
[42:56] for for this day because you are one of
[42:59] those Mighty
[43:01] Warriors ready to hear what's on the
[43:04] heart of the king you ready to hear what
[43:07] is the desire of God himself and have
[43:12] the opportunity to respond or sit like
[43:15] that bump on the pickle that our brother
[43:17] talks about so much so it's up to you
[43:20] what you're going to do with this
[43:21] service today it's up to you what you're
[43:23] going to
[43:24] [Music]
[43:25] receive but Anointed with the king's
[43:30] desire now as this unfolds we find out
[43:33] that David begins to make this utterance
[43:36] and he he begins to speak about
[43:38] something that that he's familiar with
[43:40] something that that that that's attached
[43:42] to him that that he knew about from his
[43:45] his years when he was younger and it it
[43:48] was a whale and it was a source of
[43:50] course a whale is a source of water but
[43:52] it wasn't just any well it had to be the
[43:55] well by the gate
[43:58] the water can't come from just anywhere
[44:00] it has to come by the well that's by
[44:02] there at the gate because time and time
[44:06] again no doubt David had drank from this
[44:08] well and he knew how it would satisfy
[44:12] that
[44:13] thirst and there was something specific
[44:16] that David wanted it was from a specific
[44:19] place and maybe you've come here today
[44:21] with something in your going on in your
[44:23] life and you need something specific for
[44:26] God and you already cried out and you
[44:28] said God you know exactly what I need
[44:31] and from where I need
[44:34] it amen Anointed with the king's desire
[44:39] so here we we find this man he was
[44:42] hiding in a cave he was down he was low
[44:47] and it was hot because it was the time
[44:49] of the
[44:50] Harvest and here he was he he was in a
[44:54] weakened condition and he was so
[44:59] weary because he was being
[45:03] pursued the devil's after
[45:08] you so David STS watch what he does in
[45:11] his low time in his weary time when the
[45:15] enemy is pursuing him and the desire of
[45:18] the enemy is to take his life watch what
[45:20] David does he begins his thoughts begin
[45:24] turn turning toward home
[45:29] you get down you get weary and you don't
[45:32] even
[45:33] pray you won't even call anybody that
[45:36] that that's got some strength that's got
[45:38] some ability to strengthen and to Hold
[45:40] Your Hand during this time think on
[45:43] things toward home don't allow the devil
[45:45] to trap you so so much that you stay in
[45:48] that
[45:50] cave Anointed with the king's
[45:54] desire David's thoughts began to turn to
[45:56] Ward home and he wasn't so consumed in
[46:00] self that he isolated himself and
[46:03] withdrew hear
[46:06] me so isolated that he
[46:09] withdrew withdrew away from Mama with
[46:12] Daddy from from Dad from friends from
[46:15] those that love them from those that
[46:16] care for them begin to isolate yourself
[46:19] because of the weariness and where you
[46:21] are trapped in that condition we're
[46:24] talking about being Anointed with the
[46:26] king's desire not with the devil's
[46:30] desire he knew how as I was saying time
[46:33] and time again the water from that well
[46:36] had quenched his
[46:38] thirst so many so if you would just
[46:41] pause for a moment weary Pilgrim where
[46:43] you are today and just think about the
[46:46] times that you used to sit and you would
[46:48] read your word you would come to the
[46:49] house of God and how you would just
[46:51] begin to get livened up the weariness
[46:54] would somehow just begin to just Fade
[46:56] All Away
[46:58] H the times that you used to read your
[47:00] Bible the times that you used to come to
[47:02] the house of God now you're trapped in a
[47:05] cave and the enemy is trying to destroy
[47:08] you but we have to be anointed by the
[47:11] desire of the
[47:13] king we have to turn our thoughts toward
[47:17] home and not stay stuck down where we
[47:19] are begin to isolate ourselves and pull
[47:22] ourselves away well I'll just stay in my
[47:24] room I I'll just stay at the house I
[47:26] won't I wanton no no no come out your
[47:29] room maybe your Daddy needs to take the
[47:32] hinges off the
[47:36] door young man what are you
[47:40] doing you're supposed to be Anointed
[47:42] with the king's desire not the desire of
[47:45] the
[47:47] devil young lady what are you doing
[47:49] where are you
[47:50] going Anointed with the king's
[47:53] desire but he began to speak words that
[47:56] were for familiar to him and he refused
[47:59] listen he refused to allow where he was
[48:03] and what was going on around him to
[48:05] cause him to forget about home he
[48:08] refused to allow his condition to cause
[48:12] him to forget about the good things of
[48:15] God even though maybe he was so low he
[48:18] couldn't pray maybe you've gotten so
[48:19] down maybe right now you're in that
[48:21] condition where I I'm just so weary I
[48:23] don't even know how to pray anymore
[48:25] don't allow yourself to get so low that
[48:27] you can't think about the good things of
[48:29] God that you can't turn your heart
[48:31] toward home and begin to think about
[48:34] that well that's there by the
[48:37] gate the times that you had in God the
[48:40] times that you would be out dancing
[48:42] under the spirit of God where is your
[48:45] dance now where is your
[48:49] joy get back under the anointing and the
[48:52] desire of the
[48:54] king God's calling you back
[48:58] home those words of home they begin to
[49:01] stir something within these
[49:03] Warriors simply because of what a man
[49:06] was saying his desire affected someone
[49:11] else and they knew that David himself
[49:13] could not come out from where he was so
[49:16] they went and did something for him that
[49:19] would give him the ability to have some
[49:20] strength to rise up on his own
[49:23] feet and to face that devil square in
[49:25] the eye
[49:27] cuz sometimes you don't need daddy to
[49:29] fight for you you don't need Mama to
[49:31] fight you need to fight
[49:37] yourself under the desire of the king
[49:41] being affected by the desire the words
[49:44] of a king the the the the words of
[49:46] someone that's speaking about home
[49:48] there's something about the word of God
[49:52] that even when we're down even when
[49:53] we're low it'll begin to stir something
[49:55] within us because that is our
[49:57] identification that is who we really
[50:01] are thinking of the old song the old
[50:03] Pentecostal song in the word of God I've
[50:07] got a hiding
[50:08] place I can hide in that
[50:12] word and the devil won't know what to do
[50:14] with me these words of Home begin to
[50:18] stir Within These old boys that picked
[50:20] up the message
[50:21] hello they picked up the inspiration of
[50:24] the message for their hour for their
[50:26] time where they were at that moment and
[50:29] they felt the tug of that attribute and
[50:32] it put them into
[50:34] action they could not sit still they
[50:37] could not stay where they were they
[50:39] could no longer hang out in that
[50:40] condition where they were because why
[50:43] they were under the anointing of the
[50:45] king they had received that
[50:48] inspiration and it put them into action
[50:51] 2 Samuel
[50:53] 23:16
[50:55] amen second 2 Samuel 23:16 and the three
[50:59] Mighty Men watch what they did they
[51:01] break through the host of the
[51:05] Philistines H watch in verse 13 let's go
[51:09] back up 2 Samuel 23 and 13 and the troop
[51:13] of the Philistines pitched in the valley
[51:16] of
[51:17] reim now that word reim the the
[51:20] definition is old race of giants so this
[51:24] is something that they had gone through
[51:26] before
[51:27] four they were very well aware of these
[51:30] Giants they were very well aware of what
[51:33] happened to Goliath but yet there was a
[51:36] circumstance standing at that moment in
[51:39] their life where they had to go back
[51:41] through that devil
[51:44] again but because they were Anointed
[51:47] with the desire of the king they didn't
[51:49] worry about because they knew God had
[51:52] and they knew God
[51:55] would Anointed with a desire the king's
[51:59] desire the message why little Bethlehem
[52:01] now his
[52:03] Warriors could not interpret his
[52:05] thinking watch this but brother they
[52:08] loved him with all that was in them they
[52:12] love their King they love this man and
[52:16] the least of his desires was a command
[52:20] to
[52:21] them so the least of what God desires
[52:25] for this bride for you for me today is a
[52:29] command to
[52:31] us and three of his Mighty Warriors
[52:34] pulled their swords they didn't stay at
[52:37] home they pulled their swords watch what
[52:40] the prophet says and they slipped off
[52:41] from the camp and they cut their way 25
[52:48] miles they didn't have some little just
[52:50] little Clippers going through they they
[52:52] they slung that sword you say well I
[52:54] thought the sword was for the men of God
[52:56] for the no it's for you this this word
[52:58] of God is a sword take it in your hand
[53:02] and go cutting your way through that
[53:04] situation that condition that thing
[53:06] that's clouding your mind to where you
[53:08] can't even think
[53:11] right we're to be Anointed with the
[53:13] desire of the king because we're
[53:16] warriors and they slipped off from the
[53:19] camp and they cut their way 25 miles
[53:21] David in their going no doubt wondered
[53:23] where are they at what have they done
[53:26] where did they go did they know they're
[53:28] jeopardizing their
[53:31] life where are they they're right in the
[53:34] jaws of death through a 25 mile line
[53:38] laying in Ambush everywhere and the
[53:40] swords are flickering and the shields of
[53:42] blasting but their men their brother
[53:44] that they believed that would be king
[53:47] desired a
[53:48] drink all because the king desired they
[53:52] fell under the inspiration of that
[53:54] desire and they hazarded their very
[53:56] lives for that
[53:59] purpose God's wanting you to go witness
[54:01] to a family member God's wanting you to
[54:03] go witness to someone on your job you
[54:05] have to fight your way through that
[54:09] thing maybe it's the woman sitting
[54:11] beside you in your chair today your wife
[54:14] I don't know what y'all be
[54:18] into but maybe you got to cut your way
[54:21] through that thing H Anointed with the
[54:25] king's desire
[54:27] they cannot interpret his thinking but
[54:29] brother they loved him with all that was
[54:31] within them and the least of his desires
[54:33] was a command to them the least of his
[54:37] desires was a command do you think about
[54:40] something Mighty in that does just take
[54:42] a simple word that would be bring such
[54:45] inspiration to you maybe something here
[54:47] today that you will hear from the Throne
[54:49] of God that would be inspiration that
[54:51] will allow you to cut your way through a
[54:54] host of Philistines in your life
[54:57] because you are a mighty
[55:01] warrior whoever I'm talking to now some
[55:03] of you sitting here looking at me think
[55:04] I don't know what he's talking about I'm
[55:06] not talking to
[55:08] you I'm talking about these Warriors
[55:10] that can be stirred by the word of
[55:14] God I'm not here to tell you who you are
[55:18] you have to receive that for yourself
[55:20] but the moment you know who you are you
[55:22] can stand and you can be that Invincible
[55:25] Army you can take what the prophet has
[55:27] said and apply it to your life not just
[55:31] read it because it's in a book not just
[55:32] listen to it because it's on a tape but
[55:34] you can take that in your life and allow
[55:37] that word to live out of
[55:40] you because while we're Anointed with
[55:42] the king's desire what did they do they
[55:45] fought their way through until they got
[55:48] to that well they fought their way
[55:51] through this is not some flowery bed of
[55:55] ease we're not on a
[55:57] picnic this is a war this is a battle
[56:00] you got to fight for your children
[56:02] you've got to fight for that sick loved
[56:06] one you got to stand in your position
[56:09] and as the song says watch The
[56:11] Miraculous come into action watch the
[56:13] supernatural unfold in your life what
[56:15] does God do he takes his superness and
[56:18] takes your naturalness and blends them
[56:21] together and that's the supernatural
[56:23] it's not all God he takes our natur
[56:26] he takes these old frail frangible Dusty
[56:30] frames in which we
[56:31] live and he sends an anointing down on
[56:34] that
[56:35] frame then we begin to do things that we
[56:38] thought were
[56:41] impossible cuz after all this is the
[56:44] message of Malachi 4 is it
[56:47] not is it not and you've heard me say it
[56:50] before he identified me before he even
[56:53] identified the prophet of the age that's
[56:56] right
[56:57] he got my attention before he even says
[57:00] anything about Malachi before what does
[57:02] he say behold I send
[57:06] you so God is concerned about you
[57:10] receiving what he's doing in this
[57:14] age many people they they'll say that
[57:17] well that was John John fulfilled all
[57:19] that no John didn't do all of that
[57:21] scripture in Malachi 4 and5 there was a
[57:23] part that he played but then there was a
[57:24] second part to that right our hearts
[57:27] have been
[57:28] [Applause]
[57:30] turned what did they do they fought
[57:33] their way through until they got to that
[57:34] well they dipped the bucket of water out
[57:38] see even after they got there there was
[57:40] still something for them to do they
[57:42] couldn't just go to the well and come
[57:43] back to David and say well David I went
[57:45] we saw it it was there but what did they
[57:47] do they brought back the evidence they
[57:49] brought back proof of where they
[57:52] were there was something about their
[57:54] life that was changed when they came
[57:56] back before David and they weren't all
[57:58] clean and pristine they had some blood
[58:01] on them they had some wounds they had
[58:02] some
[58:04] bruises why because they were under the
[58:07] anointing of the king they were under
[58:09] the anointing of the desire of the king
[58:12] what does God want done with this word
[58:14] this bride stands up and says I know
[58:17] father I know what you want
[58:20] done now are you going to submit to that
[58:24] are you going to do that God's giving
[58:27] you inspiration God's putting a burden
[58:29] on your
[58:31] heart and while we're here thinking
[58:33] about just the burden brother Donnie
[58:34] mentioned many of you know about it and
[58:35] have asked me about it it's still in the
[58:37] workings I'm not one to get in a hurry
[58:40] to do about anything I wait I'm a very
[58:44] patient person well I'm a patient
[58:47] person I have to watch that very
[58:49] sometimes cuz these kids have a way
[58:54] of I blame it on the
[58:57] kids but falling under that inspiration
[59:00] don't worry about what people are
[59:02] thinking people are not going to
[59:04] understand what you're doing it's not
[59:06] for them to understand you just go and
[59:09] you just do it get on the phone pick up
[59:11] the phone call somebody the Lord's laid
[59:13] that person on your
[59:15] heart well I can't do that brother Joel
[59:17] they're going to think I'm up in their
[59:18] business well maybe their business needs
[59:20] to be got up
[59:21] in maybe that's what will awaken them to
[59:24] to where they realize somebody really
[59:26] does care that I haven't been to church
[59:29] in a while somebody really does care
[59:32] that I'm not seeing that I'm not around
[59:35] somebody really has a heart for me God I
[59:37] believe I'll go back to
[59:41] church why because we are under the
[59:44] anointing of the desire of the
[59:47] king they dipped the bucket of water out
[59:50] and here they come
[59:52] back they went through the the host the
[59:55] 25 miles going and so when they got the
[59:58] evidence they had to go back through
[1:00:01] those giants through those troubles
[1:00:04] through that
[1:00:05] weariness but at the end result was
[1:00:08] going to be fulfilling the desire of the
[1:00:11] king because they bore that anointing
[1:00:14] here they come back fighting they fight
[1:00:16] coming and going sometimes you think
[1:00:18] Lord what in the world is why do I have
[1:00:20] to do all this the the the the King has
[1:00:22] anointed you with a desire he's trying
[1:00:25] to get you to fulfill his purpose in
[1:00:28] your life that's why you have to fight
[1:00:31] that's why you have to struggle so much
[1:00:33] here they come back fighting cutting
[1:00:34] their way right to right to left and
[1:00:36] they're coming to the presence of David
[1:00:39] listen to that they're coming to the
[1:00:40] presence of David they're coming into
[1:00:43] the presence of the king I'm wounded I'm
[1:00:46] weary I've got some bruises I'm scarred
[1:00:48] but I'm coming into the presence of the
[1:00:51] king it doesn't matter what mama says
[1:00:53] what daddy says I'm under the anointing
[1:00:55] of the
[1:00:56] king you played around under the
[1:00:59] anointing of the devil long
[1:01:01] enough wake up Saints wake up young man
[1:01:06] wake up young girl get out from under
[1:01:08] that anointing of the
[1:01:11] devil and get under the anointing of the
[1:01:14] king and here they come back fighting
[1:01:16] cutting their way from right to left and
[1:01:18] they're coming to the presence of David
[1:01:20] said here you are my Lord father I lay
[1:01:24] it all down at your feet
[1:01:26] father I'm coming I give my life I give
[1:01:29] everything that I am I lay it all down I
[1:01:31] don't care what the people behind me are
[1:01:33] thinking the people behind me know what
[1:01:35] I've been through they probably know why
[1:01:37] I'm up here they know I've talked to
[1:01:39] some of them they know why I'm here it
[1:01:42] doesn't matter what the people are
[1:01:43] thinking you're in the presence of the
[1:01:48] king you're not under the anointing of
[1:01:50] Youth
[1:01:54] Camp
[1:01:56] you're under the anointing
[1:01:59] today God may not even spare your life
[1:02:02] for you to take one step upon on that
[1:02:06] bus here just recently I had a a a great
[1:02:09] niece of mine 22 years old
[1:02:13] died
[1:02:18] 22 it's it's real had no clue it's just
[1:02:23] a weird feeling an odd feeling to think
[1:02:25] that that somebody that once was a part
[1:02:27] of the family is no
[1:02:30] longer
[1:02:32] 22 here I saying today today would have
[1:02:35] been mom's 93rd
[1:02:38] birthday we don't know we don't know
[1:02:41] when will be our last time so fall under
[1:02:44] the anointing of the desire of the King
[1:02:49] today don't you dare leave this
[1:02:52] building without responding to that call
[1:02:56] amen here they come back David said here
[1:02:59] you are here you are my Lord they said
[1:03:01] oh my what a man that was disgraced a
[1:03:04] man that was hated by the church a man
[1:03:07] that was hated by the
[1:03:10] king a man that was hated by the
[1:03:12] Philistines a man that was hated
[1:03:15] everywhere nearly but a little group
[1:03:17] that followed him they knew that he was
[1:03:20] the coming
[1:03:23] King there's just something about the
[1:03:25] name Jesus
[1:03:28] Christ begin to speak that name don't be
[1:03:30] afraid to speak that name don't be
[1:03:32] afraid to allow that name to escape your
[1:03:38] mouth we sit around and we wowy wowy woo
[1:03:41] all the
[1:03:42] time so why can't we give God praise why
[1:03:45] can't we glorify God in those times you
[1:03:48] say brother Joel I'm hurting that may be
[1:03:50] true but praise the Lord God inhabits
[1:03:53] the Praises of his people
[1:04:01] we're we're we're taught we're
[1:04:03] instructed that being dead in Christ
[1:04:06] being dead in Christ we take on
[1:04:08] Abraham's
[1:04:09] seed making us Heirs of the promise in
[1:04:12] Genesis 22 this unfolds that as God
[1:04:16] spoke to Abraham then back then as he
[1:04:19] was speaking to Abraham he speaks to us
[1:04:21] now today why because we are that Royal
[1:04:25] seed of Abraham we are the Fulfillment
[1:04:28] we are the evidence of what God promised
[1:04:31] would take place because what did he
[1:04:33] tell Abraham he says thy seed shall
[1:04:36] possess the Gate of his enemy not Mama's
[1:04:39] enemy not daddy's enemy not little
[1:04:41] brother's enemy but his enemy your enemy
[1:04:44] you have the power I know this is all
[1:04:46] simple if you receive it it'll awaken
[1:04:48] something in your life but if we would
[1:04:51] receive the reality that we are a part
[1:04:53] of that promise that we can possess the
[1:04:57] Gate of our enemies Genesis 22 And1 and
[1:05:01] it came to pass after these things that
[1:05:03] God did tempt
[1:05:06] Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he
[1:05:09] said behold here I am now you watch this
[1:05:12] son of God and roll back to the Garden
[1:05:14] where the Son of God was being called by
[1:05:16] God what did he do he
[1:05:19] ran hearing the word of God will either
[1:05:22] make you run and hide because of what
[1:05:24] you're doing or you'll say Lord I know
[1:05:27] what I'm doing but here I am anyway amen
[1:05:30] you just got have to take me as I am and
[1:05:32] do with me what you must but I don't
[1:05:34] want to run and hide when Papa comes
[1:05:36] into my garden When papa comes into
[1:05:38] where I am and he begins to call my name
[1:05:41] even though I may have to hang my head
[1:05:42] in shame I still want to say God here I
[1:05:48] am I don't want to be trapped up in the
[1:05:51] in what I became or what I allowed the
[1:05:54] devil to put on me some name that he put
[1:05:56] on you don't shake yourself from that
[1:05:59] thing the presence of God is here and
[1:06:02] he's calling your
[1:06:04] name your identification is in that
[1:06:08] voice
[1:06:10] God your very identity is in the voice
[1:06:14] of God and it's ringing out calling you
[1:06:17] and it came to pass after these things
[1:06:18] that God did tempt Abraham that word
[1:06:21] simply means to test I thought Abraham
[1:06:24] had already been tested
[1:06:26] waited 25 years for this child to come
[1:06:28] on the scene and here God's bringing
[1:06:30] another
[1:06:31] test
[1:06:33] absolutely absolutely God's putting you
[1:06:36] through where you are right now don't
[1:06:38] question it receive it and say God
[1:06:41] whatever this is for here I
[1:06:44] am here I am to test and the test came
[1:06:48] after he believed God for the original
[1:06:51] promise after he believed God after he
[1:06:55] received the word After the Promise was
[1:06:57] even
[1:06:58] fulfilled God still brought a test to
[1:07:02] Abraham you've been living for the Lord
[1:07:05] 30 years 40 years 10 years 50 years
[1:07:08] you're still going through
[1:07:12] tests in verse
[1:07:15] two he tells them take now thy son thine
[1:07:18] only son Isaac whom thou lovest thine
[1:07:22] only that solitary thing that one thing
[1:07:28] that unique
[1:07:29] thing that one thing that's unique to
[1:07:32] you God wants
[1:07:35] it what is that one thing that you're
[1:07:38] not giving up surrendering completely to
[1:07:40] God maybe it's your
[1:07:44] temper maybe it's hatred
[1:07:48] Envy maybe it's Disobedience and you're
[1:07:50] hanging on to that thing God says I want
[1:07:54] it okay
[1:07:58] am so the best thing for you to do today
[1:08:00] is surrender it just give it over to him
[1:08:03] because why you're under the anointing
[1:08:05] of the desire of the G that's what God
[1:08:07] desires is for you to give it to him
[1:08:10] that one unique thing the angel of the
[1:08:12] Lord tells him in verse 16 because you
[1:08:14] have done this one thing this one thing
[1:08:18] you take you took this one thing that I
[1:08:20] gave you and you're giving that one
[1:08:21] thing back because you did this one
[1:08:24] thing the one single solitary thing
[1:08:27] sometimes God doesn't ask you to do a
[1:08:29] lot he's just wanting you to do one
[1:08:30] thing one I know your schedule's tight I
[1:08:34] know you're busy I know the kids all
[1:08:36] this running and going but God wants you
[1:08:38] to do one thing today what is that one
[1:08:40] thing that you're not willing to give up
[1:08:42] fall under the anointing of the king his
[1:08:44] desire and surrender that one thing
[1:08:46] because the the angel of the Lord tells
[1:08:48] him because you have done this one thing
[1:08:51] you will receive multiplied blessings
[1:08:54] right not just a blessing here and there
[1:08:56] but blessings that will be multiplied
[1:08:59] time and time and time and time and time
[1:09:01] again because and in that multiplication
[1:09:04] in that blessing in the Fulfillment of
[1:09:06] This Promise the the the gates will be
[1:09:10] possessed by a gate possessing
[1:09:15] seed now again I'm not here to tell you
[1:09:17] that you're one of those you will have
[1:09:20] to find that out on your own but I'm
[1:09:21] here to say it that God's children who
[1:09:24] receive his word and surrender that one
[1:09:26] thing they become gate possessing
[1:09:33] seed the very Gates that the that the
[1:09:36] enemy tries to set up and says you can't
[1:09:37] come in and you definitely not getting
[1:09:39] out once I've got you here trapped
[1:09:42] you're not getting out but the Bible
[1:09:43] tells us that as Abraham did so shall we
[1:09:47] we can possess that
[1:09:49] gate and it's not going to be an easy
[1:09:51] thing where to fight coming and going so
[1:09:55] take out your sword when you're at home
[1:09:57] in your room by yourself take out this
[1:09:59] sword don't tuck yourself away in in
[1:10:02] your room on your device looking at some
[1:10:04] movie that you shouldn't be looking
[1:10:08] at my I'm not here to medal but I'm here
[1:10:13] to stir you up to remind you you are no
[1:10:16] match for the devil I'm no match for the
[1:10:19] devil fall under the anointing of the
[1:10:22] king get his
[1:10:24] desire right huh it's easy to follow the
[1:10:27] devil because the devil makes this thing
[1:10:29] right here feel
[1:10:33] good every time you will find a good
[1:10:35] feeling when the devil moves in on
[1:10:38] you well I better go with it cuz it felt
[1:10:42] great
[1:10:44] what you're supposed to be dead in
[1:10:47] Christ dead things don't feel
[1:10:52] anything when you're dead in him you're
[1:10:55] not going to feel these pulsations from
[1:10:57] the pits of
[1:11:02] hell I've touched the many dead corpse
[1:11:06] they don't move back they don't open
[1:11:08] their eyes and look at me who touched me
[1:11:10] they're
[1:11:14] dead my some of those Old Testament folk
[1:11:17] will get me for that you ain't supposed
[1:11:18] to touch dead people y'all have at it do
[1:11:21] what you want to with
[1:11:22] it but the the gate possesses seed
[1:11:25] Saints that's
[1:11:27] you a gate possessing seed tabernacling
[1:11:31] deity in you that's that's you you
[1:11:34] that's that's the evidence of what
[1:11:36] Abraham said amen to and here we are in
[1:11:39] 2024 receiving some same words and just
[1:11:43] as Abraham said amen Here I Am the the
[1:11:46] the requirement for us today is to say
[1:11:49] amen and say Yes Lord here I
[1:11:52] am that's you that's me that's a body of
[1:11:55] upon the Earth today a body Anointed
[1:11:58] with the king's
[1:12:00] desire H at Thy word 1948 after you
[1:12:04] prayed for watch this tomorrow talking
[1:12:07] about possessing the the the gates of
[1:12:09] the enemy and these things and and we
[1:12:10] come up for prayer and we think well
[1:12:12] maybe I didn't get my healing but after
[1:12:14] you're prayed for tomorrow the next day
[1:12:16] is going to come the
[1:12:18] test maybe prayer for salvation maybe
[1:12:21] prayer for healing in your body or or
[1:12:22] Deliverance or whatever besetting sin
[1:12:24] all of these things the test is going to
[1:12:27] come don't you worry the prophet
[1:12:29] encourages us he says everybody in here
[1:12:32] that ever received the Holy Ghost a few
[1:12:35] days afterwards come the test I can say
[1:12:38] Amen to that I can say brother Brown a
[1:12:42] few years afterwards there was still
[1:12:44] tests
[1:12:46] coming is that right he says now watch
[1:12:49] what he how he works with this when
[1:12:51] you're healed that demon in there the
[1:12:54] body of begins to die out the body the
[1:12:59] body now what is a body doing in this
[1:13:02] body H you are no match for the devil
[1:13:06] when you're healed that demon in there
[1:13:09] the body of it begins to die out the
[1:13:10] test is coming Satan's going to try to
[1:13:13] return back when the unclean spirit's
[1:13:14] gone out of a man he walketh in dry
[1:13:16] places he returns back and brings seven
[1:13:18] other Devils worse than he was is that
[1:13:21] right notice Let the house be garnished
[1:13:23] and swept and ready at that hour so the
[1:13:25] prophet words it he and he says it this
[1:13:28] way that body begins to die
[1:13:31] out that body so a being takes resonance
[1:13:35] in your
[1:13:38] body but I thought we were supposed to
[1:13:40] be the Tabernacle of the most high and
[1:13:42] living God a demon takes residence in
[1:13:45] your
[1:13:46] mind a demon a body you take it up with
[1:13:50] the prophet that body begins to die out
[1:13:52] and that being takes resonance in in
[1:13:54] your body begins to attaching itself to
[1:13:56] you in order to make you its host it's
[1:13:59] feeding do you not realize it's feeding
[1:14:01] off of you that's why the Devil Wants
[1:14:03] You isolated that's why the Devil Wants
[1:14:05] You by himself because he knows that
[1:14:08] when he that if you're around someone
[1:14:10] and they see you going down they see
[1:14:12] that you're not just right they're going
[1:14:13] to call you back to life the devil's
[1:14:16] objective is to take you out of
[1:14:20] here because that being that that being
[1:14:23] has attached itself to you and you
[1:14:25] become its host you are the a a
[1:14:28] sustenance for the
[1:14:30] devil giving the devil life giving the
[1:14:33] devil ability to do what he came to do
[1:14:36] your body gives strength and nourishment
[1:14:39] to the
[1:14:41] devil the prophet says that body begins
[1:14:44] to die out a tabernacle of the devil's
[1:14:49] desire but he says begins to
[1:14:52] die so here we become host for this body
[1:14:57] and it's beginning to die and we
[1:14:59] continue to do those things that's
[1:15:01] giving it life what are we doing we are
[1:15:04] becoming demonic life
[1:15:09] supporters giving that thing life it's
[1:15:12] supposed to be dead we're supposed to
[1:15:14] kill these things why because we have
[1:15:16] the sword in our hands and it cuts
[1:15:18] coming and going and we got to fight
[1:15:21] don't give
[1:15:23] up don't get weary in your
[1:15:28] wello don't be a demonic life
[1:15:36] supporter we the the this church is a
[1:15:40] hospital it's not a Hospice place we
[1:15:43] bring Hospice in when someone's about to
[1:15:44] die and we make them what comfortable
[1:15:47] until they die I don't want the devil to
[1:15:49] be
[1:15:52] comfortable I don't want to give him
[1:15:54] life support I don't want to pump him
[1:15:55] with something that's going to keep him
[1:15:56] going just a little longer oh we want to
[1:15:58] keep him here just a little longer oh
[1:16:00] mama mama daddy oh my
[1:16:03] no when my mama said oh wow she was
[1:16:06] ready to
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:09] go H she was seeing something Beyond
[1:16:12] this
[1:16:14] Dimension she wasn't afraid of that that
[1:16:17] she was seeing so that gave me hope that
[1:16:20] gave me confidence that gave me Zeal
[1:16:22] that gave me determination to know that
[1:16:24] if she saw it I can see it too if she
[1:16:27] can go then so can
[1:16:33] I we look in Daniel chapter 3 we're not
[1:16:35] going to read it but but just as a point
[1:16:37] of reference we we find out uh Daniel
[1:16:39] and the three Hebrew boys in the finary
[1:16:41] furnace taking uh talk on the word 1953
[1:16:45] they fed him this stuff for 10 days we
[1:16:47] know the story I won't go back into it
[1:16:49] little old pot of peas orever what it
[1:16:51] was nothing in it at all to make you fat
[1:16:54] some of the sister would say I need some
[1:16:55] of
[1:16:57] that ain't going to make you fat I'll
[1:16:59] eat
[1:17:00] it I know some of the brothers
[1:17:04] too eating all these Pudge
[1:17:06] points first thing you know they brought
[1:17:09] Daniel up and the rest of them and they
[1:17:11] looked all the boys over the devil's
[1:17:14] looking you
[1:17:16] over they looking you up and down huh
[1:17:21] they're scoping you out when they
[1:17:23] brought old brother Daniel up his cheeks
[1:17:25] was Rosy he was just as round and fat as
[1:17:28] he could be Hallelujah said say I
[1:17:31] believe every time they set that little
[1:17:32] p of peas down before Daniel that God
[1:17:35] just reached over and got the vitamin
[1:17:37] bottle and poured the whole thing into
[1:17:40] them so what's happening today in this
[1:17:43] service for you God is taking his little
[1:17:46] spiritual vitamin bottle and he's
[1:17:47] pouring the whole thing into you today
[1:17:51] just one person maybe two maybe three
[1:17:53] maybe 10 maybe 20 whoever it is God
[1:17:56] wants you to be pumped so full of
[1:17:58] vitamins that here in this whole crazy
[1:18:00] age in which we live we can still be
[1:18:02] plumped fat and Rosy cheek and ready to
[1:18:04] take on the
[1:18:07] devil and not bow down to anything that
[1:18:11] this old strange King decrees I'm not
[1:18:14] falling under the inspiration of the
[1:18:16] devil I'm under the anointing of the
[1:18:19] king
[1:18:20] amen I know my redeemer liveth it was
[1:18:23] the purpose of God to show that he had
[1:18:26] power over the wild beasts of the field
[1:18:28] and they put some lions in a cave one
[1:18:30] time they had starved them until they
[1:18:31] were so hungry that they could have tore
[1:18:34] a person to Pieces Just at one great
[1:18:36] grab and the talking about Daniel seal
[1:18:38] and the devil thought surely I'll be
[1:18:39] able to destroy this Prophet Daniel but
[1:18:41] Daniel had purpose in his heart to do
[1:18:45] the purpose of God so Daniel had a
[1:18:47] purpose because God had a purpose and
[1:18:49] Daniel picked up the anointing Daniel
[1:18:51] picked up the inspiration of the purpose
[1:18:53] of God and he said I refuse to defile
[1:18:58] myself Angel of the Lord come and speak
[1:19:00] to the prophet of God he said don't
[1:19:02] smoke Don't drink don't defile your
[1:19:06] body now that's in the message young men
[1:19:08] let me tell you something don't smoke
[1:19:11] Don't drink don't defile your
[1:19:15] body because as you walk on through life
[1:19:18] and you keep that sanctification you
[1:19:20] keep that position in Christ God's got a
[1:19:22] little Queen for you to walk by your
[1:19:25] side you may be a little knucklehead now
[1:19:27] but God's doing something in your life
[1:19:29] to take all of that
[1:19:31] [Applause]
[1:19:32] out don't smoke Don't drink don't defile
[1:19:35] your body why are we not hearing this
[1:19:37] preach around around the message of the
[1:19:39] hour today people are afraid because
[1:19:41] they think well I don't want to say
[1:19:42] anything to be inappropriate let me tell
[1:19:44] you something these kids these older
[1:19:46] people they're doing things that are
[1:19:47] inappropriate so it's time for the word
[1:19:50] to call out all this
[1:19:53] inappropriateness
[1:19:55] you'll find yourself strung out on drugs
[1:19:57] and you'll find yourself following some
[1:19:58] little Floy that she ain't worth two
[1:20:01] cents she has no identification of the
[1:20:04] word in her young man get away from
[1:20:07] her young lady you stand up in the
[1:20:10] character that God has called you and
[1:20:12] said I will not defile myself I have a
[1:20:15] purpose from God and I've fallen under
[1:20:18] the anointing of The King and I want to
[1:20:20] do the desire of the
[1:20:23] king you keep your yourself pure you
[1:20:25] keep yourself chased you keep yourself
[1:20:28] whole hear me young
[1:20:32] people don't try why my goodness don't
[1:20:35] go off in that boy's
[1:20:40] room where are my a
[1:20:43] maners y'all supposed to be helping me
[1:20:46] out mama daddy you got some kids doing
[1:20:50] this you better be saying amen because
[1:20:52] the test is coming
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:00] my my he say well that's just you
[1:21:02] brother Joel that's fine it might just
[1:21:04] be me but it's going to awaken
[1:21:06] you it's going to be something to get
[1:21:09] your
[1:21:10] attention you don't think a man of God
[1:21:12] as he's standing up here maybe he knows
[1:21:14] so I think about the pastor so much our
[1:21:16] pastor not excluded from this certainly
[1:21:18] not but the things that he knows in the
[1:21:19] counsel and the things he's standing
[1:21:21] here bringing the word and God's
[1:21:23] dropping these things into his heart and
[1:21:24] he's beginning to speak and it says I
[1:21:26] can't say that because I know such and
[1:21:27] such is done all these things having to
[1:21:29] go through all of this but the word of
[1:21:31] God is here to cut out all of these
[1:21:33] things because chances are you didn't
[1:21:35] listen back there in the office and God
[1:21:37] is trying to bring it to your attention
[1:21:46] again and the devil thought surely I'll
[1:21:48] be able to destroy this Prophet Daniel
[1:21:50] but Daniel had purpose in his heart to
[1:21:52] do the purpose of God and God had placed
[1:21:54] that in his
[1:21:56] heart so where did this purpose come
[1:21:58] from God had put it there you don't
[1:22:01] think the devil's trying to put so many
[1:22:03] things into that heart too but what did
[1:22:06] he do when it came he just
[1:22:08] slowly knocked it off to the side
[1:22:10] cutting coming and going in the midst of
[1:22:13] his test before Daniel could have had
[1:22:15] this desire there had to be something to
[1:22:17] create that desire before he could have
[1:22:19] that faith that Faith Daniel had that
[1:22:21] Faith there had to be something to tell
[1:22:24] him that there was a God that could
[1:22:27] deliver you sitting here looking at me
[1:22:29] today and you're thinking well maybe God
[1:22:31] wants me to come back maybe God wants me
[1:22:33] to surrender no that's not a maybe
[1:22:35] that's so God's desire God's anointing
[1:22:39] is for you to submit your life to him
[1:22:41] and to be filled with the anointing of
[1:22:43] God to be filled with that precious
[1:22:45] spirit of God to become a new creature
[1:22:48] to take on another identity I know my
[1:22:49] redeemer Liv is contining thought I know
[1:22:52] how that coincides this morning with the
[1:22:54] faith The Living Faith of the Living God
[1:22:56] in his church there's something in our
[1:22:58] heart that speaks that there is a land
[1:23:00] beyond the river I cannot put my finger
[1:23:02] on it neither can any man but there's
[1:23:04] something within
[1:23:06] us there's something within us that
[1:23:10] tells us that the grave is not its goal
[1:23:14] even there that day as my mom was
[1:23:15] leaving this Dimension she was talking
[1:23:18] and sharing her testimony talking about
[1:23:20] how when God began to move on her heart
[1:23:22] and she surrendered her life to him and
[1:23:24] her words were I just had no more desire
[1:23:27] I didn't want to live that way anymore
[1:23:29] and here she was 90 years old still
[1:23:31] identifying with that original work and
[1:23:34] that thing that struck her over 50 60
[1:23:37] years ago whatever it was was still real
[1:23:39] was still holding her to the point when
[1:23:42] death came with its obedient knock she
[1:23:45] was there saying oh wow come on in I'm
[1:23:47] ready to
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:51] go because why there was something on
[1:23:54] the inside of her it's there's another
[1:23:57] life there's another world greater than
[1:23:59] this
[1:24:01] one H don't get trapped here a fire
[1:24:05] that's a burning a light that's been lit
[1:24:07] by God and no breezes can blow it out
[1:24:10] there's no cold spells in the church
[1:24:12] there's no indifference amongst the
[1:24:14] people there is not one thing young
[1:24:16] people listen there's not one thing that
[1:24:18] one of those little knucklehead young
[1:24:20] people that's in the young people's
[1:24:21] group that can say to you that should
[1:24:23] discourage you
[1:24:25] because while you have God you have the
[1:24:27] anointing of God in
[1:24:31] you oh
[1:24:33] well adults be quiet a minute young
[1:24:36] people let me hear you say amen amen let
[1:24:39] me hear it
[1:24:40] again okay it's in you
[1:24:43] too stand up in your position in your
[1:24:47] calling in what God has called you to do
[1:24:50] God's purpose that his torch light of
[1:24:52] Freedom will burn until the coming of
[1:24:53] the Lord and no powers can blow it out
[1:24:55] they will only make it burn brighter as
[1:24:57] they
[1:24:58] blow we know how it is when we were
[1:25:00] trying to start a fire some the Zion and
[1:25:03] and Jonas was trying to start a fire
[1:25:05] last night and and and Roman and they
[1:25:07] were they were just
[1:25:08] blowing they blowing too
[1:25:11] hard it wouldn't ignite it wouldn't
[1:25:14] catch I was trying to study I was I a
[1:25:18] got time to do
[1:25:21] this smelling like smoke but sometimes
[1:25:25] we blow too hard that's what that's my
[1:25:27] point that's what I'm trying to get at
[1:25:29] sometimes you just got to you you you
[1:25:30] the Devil comes in
[1:25:33] just that's the Breath of God you need
[1:25:37] to blow and huff and huff and get all
[1:25:38] laded and and the devil still standing
[1:25:40] there laughing at you in your face but
[1:25:42] stand in the calling that God has given
[1:25:45] you and it's been proving Through the
[1:25:47] Ages that persecution strengthens the
[1:25:49] church and Daniel not knowing how God
[1:25:52] was going to do it and not knowing
[1:25:54] whether God was going to do it but
[1:25:56] knowing that he was able to do it and
[1:25:58] knowing that something down in him told
[1:26:00] him
[1:26:01] so the trial that you're in the
[1:26:04] circumstance that surrounded and has
[1:26:05] attached itself to your life you think
[1:26:08] maybe God won't do it but there's
[1:26:11] something on the inside of you that
[1:26:12] tells you no that's the devil's thinking
[1:26:15] God can do it because he's done it
[1:26:18] before if he done it for this one I know
[1:26:21] he can do it for me why because it's God
[1:26:24] Daniel was down in Babylon away from
[1:26:26] home and all that was familiar to him he
[1:26:28] had become a slave and no matter what
[1:26:31] they did to him he had purpose in his
[1:26:33] heart that he was not going to defile
[1:26:36] himself with the Babylonian way of life
[1:26:39] he was not going to defile himself with
[1:26:44] sin he was going to come out of that
[1:26:46] condition come out of that that that
[1:26:48] that place of isolation and he was going
[1:26:50] to be a better young man he was going to
[1:26:52] be a better young lady or she was going
[1:26:54] to be a better young
[1:26:56] woman transform the atmosphere I
[1:26:58] challenge you transform the atmosphere
[1:27:01] in your
[1:27:03] home cuz sometimes daddy acts like a
[1:27:06] knucklehead
[1:27:10] too Micah Josiah Zion don't you
[1:27:13] dare say
[1:27:16] Amen sometimes Mama acts up huh gets a
[1:27:21] spirit stirring in the house you be the
[1:27:23] one to change that atmosphere in the
[1:27:26] home don't wait for Daddy to do it
[1:27:30] huh is that okay does that deserve an
[1:27:33] amen amen because see sometimes I think
[1:27:37] the young people young young men
[1:27:39] especially when when there's Rules and
[1:27:42] Things that that that are given and
[1:27:43] sometimes the the young girls Buck
[1:27:45] against it too it's just the the the
[1:27:47] spirit that's on them but but rules
[1:27:49] covered with
[1:27:51] relationship gives way to love and
[1:27:53] obedience
[1:27:54] cuz sometimes you can bring the rule the
[1:27:57] the law the law you got to
[1:27:59] do I'm Alpha
[1:28:03] dad but you got to do it in love because
[1:28:07] when you do it when rules are covered
[1:28:09] with relationship that it's more likely
[1:28:12] for that listen dad's listen Mom it's
[1:28:14] more likely for that young man that
[1:28:16] young girl to to to to give into those
[1:28:19] rules because they're familiar with with
[1:28:21] the care they're familiar with the love
[1:28:23] they know that there's love there they
[1:28:25] know that there's Comfort they know that
[1:28:26] there's encouragement so sometimes you
[1:28:28] need to back up from your position and
[1:28:31] love that child through that season
[1:28:33] where they
[1:28:35] are because they're getting older
[1:28:37] they're not the little tot that they
[1:28:39] used to
[1:28:43] be that's just how I try to do
[1:28:46] mine do they listen
[1:28:50] no do we keep coming back to the mom and
[1:28:52] I keep coming back to the same thing
[1:28:55] yes H take out the garbage make your bed
[1:28:59] clean your room pick up all these things
[1:29:02] but it's consistency and you do it in
[1:29:04] love why am I talking about all these
[1:29:06] things because love has to be following
[1:29:09] those rules and regulations love your
[1:29:12] child through it don't dismiss your
[1:29:13] child don't discredit your child don't
[1:29:15] write your son off your daughter off
[1:29:17] love them through that season where they
[1:29:19] are Daniel was down in Babylon he become
[1:29:22] this slave and nothing can harm her the
[1:29:24] prophet tells us this in spoken words of
[1:29:26] the Original Seed nothing can harm her
[1:29:28] not even death there Daniel was staring
[1:29:31] death in the face for if the seed be
[1:29:33] planted the water will raise it up
[1:29:36] again a seed is being planted today the
[1:29:40] water will raise it up again you stay in
[1:29:43] this word you water that seed that's
[1:29:45] been planted today and you water it with
[1:29:47] this word water with the anointing of
[1:29:49] God Amen the prophet goes on to say the
[1:29:52] water will raise it up again here is the
[1:29:54] secret the word is in the bride and the
[1:29:57] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:29:59] done with the word and she does it in
[1:30:02] his
[1:30:06] name maybe he's not acting right that
[1:30:08] young boy maybe she's not acting right
[1:30:11] that young lady whatever you instruct
[1:30:13] them to do you do it in the name of
[1:30:15] Jesus even go lay hands on that little
[1:30:19] rascal don't be afraid to take position
[1:30:22] in your own home that's a Spirit that's
[1:30:24] creeping
[1:30:26] in and sometimes I've watched it even in
[1:30:28] my own home it'll come right after my
[1:30:30] wife things will begin to stir up
[1:30:34] H y'all don't believe
[1:30:38] this I'll move on spoken word is the
[1:30:41] Original Seed but she knows what God
[1:30:44] wants done with the word why because she
[1:30:46] is falling under the anointing of the
[1:30:48] king and she has his desire faith is our
[1:30:50] Victory oh if we had more Gallant men
[1:30:52] like that that would purpose in their
[1:30:54] heart if I am a Christian I'm going to
[1:30:56] find out every divine blessing that
[1:30:58] belongs to me and claim it every divine
[1:31:01] blessing that belongs to me every divine
[1:31:03] blessing that belongs to you as an
[1:31:05] individual every divine blessing that
[1:31:08] belongs to
[1:31:10] you we've heard it Pastor say time and
[1:31:13] time again I don't want to fulfill
[1:31:14] everything that's in this word because
[1:31:16] everything in this word is not for me
[1:31:18] but everything that is for me I want to
[1:31:20] fulfill
[1:31:22] that and that's sometimes is where the
[1:31:25] interference comes in we're trying to be
[1:31:27] like brother Donnie we're trying to be
[1:31:29] like sister
[1:31:32] Carol I'm not Donnie Reagan
[1:31:36] hello he's from Kentucky I'm from
[1:31:38] Virginia better
[1:31:43] place edit that out I don't want him to
[1:31:46] hear
[1:31:46] that but you understand what I'm saying
[1:31:49] I can't be anything but what God has
[1:31:51] called me to be so if you come looking
[1:31:53] for something to be said in a familiar
[1:31:55] way you've come to the wrong service
[1:31:57] today wait till your pastor gets back
[1:31:59] then it'll be exactly where you want it
[1:32:02] but if you don't receive this word today
[1:32:05] because it's coming from the Throne of
[1:32:06] God if you don't receive it you're going
[1:32:08] to miss something and when it comes time
[1:32:10] for your
[1:32:13] test you'll continue in that condition
[1:32:16] oh well nobody cares about me ain't
[1:32:19] nobody called me in weeks I don't want
[1:32:21] to call you like that
[1:32:26] nobody wants to be around
[1:32:28] you we're supposed to be under the
[1:32:30] anointing of the
[1:32:32] king and claim it if the Bible teaches
[1:32:34] that I can receive the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:32:36] going to stay on my knees till God gives
[1:32:39] me the Holy Spirit and just not
[1:32:43] drift waiting for this Youth Camp after
[1:32:46] this Youth Camp there's spirits that
[1:32:48] travel around these youth
[1:32:52] camps come on H
[1:32:55] huh
[1:32:57] wow you better go with the purpose of
[1:33:00] getting something from God that's going
[1:33:01] to stabilize
[1:33:03] you I don't care how cute he is I don't
[1:33:06] care how fine she
[1:33:09] is if you don't have the Holy Ghost you
[1:33:12] better leave him alone if you don't have
[1:33:14] the Holy Ghost you better leave her
[1:33:16] alone because there's been many many
[1:33:18] many occasions where message boys have
[1:33:22] defiled message girls
[1:33:24] and message girls have messed up lives
[1:33:26] of message boys in the
[1:33:30] church now the cute folk don't believe
[1:33:33] that not my
[1:33:34] baby yes
[1:33:39] ma'am you do it oh Lord have
[1:33:44] mercy maybe I should have preached the
[1:33:46] message I
[1:33:48] digress but here this this this his
[1:33:51] faith stood good in the face of hungry
[1:33:53] lions with Daniel his faith stood good
[1:33:55] in the face of an intensely hot furnace
[1:33:58] the three Hebrew boys their faith their
[1:34:01] faith the faith of God stood firm stood
[1:34:04] good the purpose of his heart that thing
[1:34:07] that God had pulsated into that young
[1:34:10] boy the pul that pulsated into those
[1:34:12] three Hebrew boys and and countless
[1:34:14] others we could this the scriptures
[1:34:16] littered with people who fell under this
[1:34:18] anointing but that purpose that was in
[1:34:20] their heart that was their victory that
[1:34:23] that faith that rested within them
[1:34:26] that's how you can receive the victory
[1:34:28] that's how you can overcome is to get
[1:34:30] the faith of
[1:34:31] God not Mama's faith not daddy's Faith
[1:34:35] but the faith of God why because you're
[1:34:38] under the anointing of the king oh the
[1:34:40] depths of these attributes of God that
[1:34:42] are pulsating from eternity imagine God
[1:34:45] is pulsating pulsating attributes he's
[1:34:48] wanting to to receive it more than you
[1:34:50] even want to have
[1:34:52] it he's projecting just about one time
[1:34:55] but he's pulsating all of these things
[1:34:57] back toward his seed and God desires
[1:35:00] more than we will ever know to give them
[1:35:02] to us he wants you to have eternal life
[1:35:05] he wants you to have salvation he wants
[1:35:07] you to be an overcomer he wants you to
[1:35:09] set this beside by setting sin aside he
[1:35:12] wants you to you yourself to eradicate
[1:35:15] these things to kill these devils not
[1:35:17] give them life support unplug the
[1:35:20] machine take the vial of drugs out of
[1:35:22] his arm that's giving life that's giving
[1:35:24] him makinging him com I don't want the
[1:35:26] devil
[1:35:28] comfortable because he's just a host in
[1:35:31] my mind he's a host in my body we don't
[1:35:34] want these things unplug it
[1:35:36] all and raise up off that bed of
[1:35:38] Affliction raise up off that bed of
[1:35:40] discouragement that bed of of of of
[1:35:43] weariness and gloominess and suicide all
[1:35:45] of these things raise up off of that
[1:35:47] thing in the new life of Jesus

[1:43:15] his
[1:43:18] resurrection and what is a resurrection

[1:47:37] all to
[1:47:39] you that's what it's about that's what

[1:59:11] pastor Lord before you praying that you
[1:59:14] keep him balance keep him humble Lord
[1:59:17] all of these spiritists permeating
[1:59:20] throughout the land today Lord even he's
[1:59:23] susceptible to these things so I pray
[1:59:24] that you put a shield and guard around
[1:59:26] and put a shield and guard around us as
[1:59:29] the Sheep of this fold oh God and may we
[1:59:32] stand as a beacon of light in this
[1:59:35] age we've been called under the the
[1:59:38] message of Malachi 4 to take your word
[1:59:42] and do with it what we know you want
[1:59:44] done so father may we be obedient to
[1:59:47] that very thing touch those who are sick
[1:59:50] maybe those who are weary those who are
[1:59:52] are grieving still yet oh God touch that
[1:59:55] Heart Lord when that brother's there at
[1:59:57] home by himself Lord he's missing her so
[2:00:01] much when she's there at home and
[2:00:03] everything's quiet and hear the ticking
[2:00:05] of the clock oh God may you just settle
[2:00:08] in on that room father wherever she may
[2:00:10] be Lord maybe that young man that young
[2:00:13] girl has barricaded himself in their
[2:00:15] room Lord and they're feeding on things
[2:00:18] that they ought not to feed on Lord I
[2:00:20] pray that even there you will make
[2:00:23] yourself known may you just begin to
[2:00:26] cause the pressure in the atmosphere in
[2:00:27] the room to change and Lord maybe it
[2:00:30] would be even an audible voice oh God or
[2:00:34] maybe it's there they reading their
[2:00:35] Bible or maybe them falling asleep and
[2:00:38] you make yourself known I'll never
[2:00:41] forget father there I was about 14 15
[2:00:45] years old that light came into the room
[2:00:48] there where I was just that Amber glow
[2:00:51] that soft yellow light Lord to this day
[2:00:55] Lord I don't understand completely what
[2:00:57] that meant but Lord I'm longing for that
[2:01:00] to return cuz Lord I'll be more mindful
[2:01:04] I'll be in a better posture Lord to to
[2:01:07] be more obedient to to to to listen so
[2:01:11] father may you do things among us that's
[2:01:14] going to cause us to get in Step CU
[2:01:16] that's what this message that's how it
[2:01:18] ended up as that bride walk in that
[2:01:21] narrow way in the Prophet calling us to
[2:01:23] get back in Step so Lord forgive us
[2:01:25] where we haven't forgive us where we we
[2:01:27] don't write us father God put us back on
[2:01:31] that straight and narrow way we love you
[2:01:33] and we thank you and it's in Jesus
[2:01:35] Christ's name we pray amen isn't he
[2:01:38] wonderful amen amen God bless you thank
[2:01:41] you for your time your patience your
[2:01:44] love and I do ask you to continue to to
[2:01:47] pray for me in my Endeavor back home and
[2:01:49] it's it's just something again I'm just
[2:01:52] the burden's been there for years but um
[2:01:54] I don't want to get ahead of the Lord
[2:01:55] and I definitely don't want to lag too
[2:01:57] far behind but just um my preference
[2:02:00] I'll just go ahead and share this my
[2:02:01] preference is not to have it in a a
[2:02:02] church building proper but to just have
[2:02:05] another space somewhere because I don't
[2:02:07] want it to be such where someone may be
[2:02:09] indifferent to that church or
[2:02:11] Something's Happened Lord that maybe
[2:02:14] that they they don't want to you know
[2:02:15] maybe the people that go there but if
[2:02:17] it's a neutral space so just be praying
[2:02:20] with me about that I'm just um and just
[2:02:22] my time that I can float back into Gaya
[2:02:24] and and do some of the boot boots on the
[2:02:26] ground type of stuff and just the
[2:02:28] witnessing and and all all of these
[2:02:30] things just getting the feel for things
[2:02:31] and the these things take the leadership
[2:02:33] of the Lord and I'm I'll be counting on
[2:02:35] you all to pray for me and and I know
[2:02:36] you have been some some have and but I
[2:02:39] know others thought maybe I that my
[2:02:41] family and I were moving and and all
[2:02:43] that that's that's not it I'm not
[2:02:44] Desiring to start a church or anything
[2:02:46] like that I just my heart's desire is to
[2:02:49] find that
[2:02:50] one and sometimes that's birthed out of
[2:02:52] a burden you know and and to to just
[2:02:55] Captivate a soul and and ignite a fire
[2:02:58] within that one and they they take it
[2:03:00] and and go with it and that that'll be
[2:03:02] great with me but we have to be doing
[2:03:04] something for the Lord don't sit on your
[2:03:06] hands don't just wait for Wednesday
[2:03:09] night to come do something tomorrow do
[2:03:10] something this afternoon for God do
[2:03:12] something on Tuesday do something on
[2:03:14] Wednesday that'll be a testimony to
[2:03:15] share with the body of Christ on
