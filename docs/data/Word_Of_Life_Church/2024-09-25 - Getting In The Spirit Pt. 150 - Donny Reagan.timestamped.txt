[26:17] [Music]
[26:23] seated while I try to turn this on
[26:28] permissible for just a moment the last
[26:31] couple of weeks have been incredible and
[26:33] I feel like I have to give it glory to
[26:35] the
[26:36] Lord song I sang often many years ago
[26:42] there's lines in it that says all my
[26:44] days are filled with Sunshine not a
[26:46] cloud or darkened my
[26:48] mind on my way up here today and I got a
[26:52] chance to hear that awesome sermon
[26:55] Sunday needless to say I've been brother
[26:57] a for a long time and I'm sure there's
[27:00] others here but I look over the last few
[27:04] years and seven years ago the Lord
[27:06] brought me this way and the leadership
[27:09] my precious brother Reagan has helped me
[27:11] so much God blessed me to cross the path
[27:14] of brother Ron and I learned more about
[27:17] predestination one the experience that
[27:19] many of you heard about but today on the
[27:22] way here listening to that as of message
[27:25] and those glooms I realized why I can
[27:28] sing this song The Devil jumped on my
[27:30] shoulders you can't sing this song all
[27:32] your days aren't filled with Sunshine
[27:34] not a cloud darkens your mind I see you
[27:37] when you're moaning and you're groaning
[27:38] and all the things you've been through
[27:40] and the scars and
[27:42] this as I heard brother Daryl say after
[27:46] that sermon that Cloud's beyond that
[27:47] Sun's Beyond those clouds and I just
[27:49] want to give the Lord the glory for how
[27:52] much he's reached down and touched me
[27:53] through the ministry over the recent
[27:55] weeks
[28:00] [Music]
[28:09] there was a
[28:11] time I thought that I could
[28:15] conquer

[28:24] try oh and blind it to
[28:30] disaster my world kept spinning
[28:35] faster till I felt the very soul of me
[28:39] would

[38:38] by Praise the
[38:40] Lord I'm glad we believe it's just that
[38:43] simple
[38:45] tonight no matter what you have need of
[38:48] what you brought to church with you your
[38:50] burdens might be so heavy and it feels
[38:53] like it's that rain on that roof that
[38:55] it's waiting you down and you think you
[38:57] cannot put one foot in front of the
[39:00] other but just remember the Lord Jesus
[39:03] is mindful of everything we have need
[39:07] of I'd answered an email today from a a
[39:12] foreign country of someone
[39:14] who wanted to had ask a question and
[39:19] this person said that this question was
[39:21] hindering them from serving God that
[39:25] they could not serve God but because
[39:27] they did not understand the answer to
[39:30] this question and the question was why
[39:33] is it that God allows sickness and
[39:35] trouble and difficulty to come against
[39:40] people and sometimes they feel like they
[39:41] just can't take it anymore and that
[39:45] question was hindering them from serving
[39:49] God of course I could have sent them all
[39:51] kinds of scriptures and quotes but one
[39:54] of the ones that came to my heart was
[39:56] from the Church age book where the
[39:58] Prophet tells us that why does he stand
[40:00] by why does he stand by and watch his
[40:03] children suffer it's for our good
[40:07] because he wants to teach us things he
[40:10] wants to help us you know in the world
[40:13] that we're living many people have that
[40:15] question I'm sure that you know it
[40:17] already but some of the Jews after the
[40:21] Holocaust they turned to be total
[40:25] infidels because they said there could
[40:27] be be no such a thing as God that would
[40:30] allow his chosen people to suffer but to
[40:33] me that's one of the things that makes
[40:34] me love him CU I realize he loves us so
[40:38] much and he wants such a character out
[40:42] of our lives that he will hurt
[40:46] himself to put us through what we need
[40:49] to go through do you actually think he
[40:52] lets you go through the things you're
[40:54] going through and he sits there in
[40:57] heaven
[40:58] and he's so
[41:00] separate from what's killing
[41:03] you that he just looks down and laughs
[41:06] and say wow this is great this is
[41:09] absolutely
[41:11] awesome that's not my
[41:14] father he was touched by the feelings of
[41:16] our infirmities when he was
[41:19] here I wonder what all that we go
[41:22] through and how is our high priest it
[41:25] still affects him
[41:27] I couldn't serve a god any other way
[41:29] could you I couldn't serve the devil
[41:32] myself cuz he just outright mean to his
[41:35] people he don't love his children he
[41:38] torments them puts them through hell
[41:40] bankrupts them lies to them robs them
[41:42] steals from them and they going to take
[41:44] them to hell when it's all said and done
[41:46] and they love him some of them love him
[41:48] just as much as you love God and what in
[41:51] the world is he doing for them
[41:54] absolutely nothing and the Lord Jesus
[41:57] not only promises us a world that is to
[42:00] come but he says no matter what you go
[42:02] through in life I promise I'll be with
[42:05] you I promise I'll be with you am I'm
[42:09] glad I know him that way tonight isin it
[42:12] a privilege to be gather together here
[42:13] in the house of God tonight well praise
[42:16] the Lord we're going to preach again
[42:17] tonight on the latter rain all right I
[42:20] figured some of y'all would have a hard
[42:21] time smiling whenever I was going to
[42:23] read them a text so I thought I'd go and
[42:24] tell you yes it's pouring outside and
[42:26] it's been pouring and going to pour for
[42:28] the next 24 hours or so and I hope that
[42:31] it does the same way on the inside and
[42:34] then our walks with God and our life
[42:36] with God because as our state has went
[42:39] through a dry spell the whole Southeast
[42:41] basically a lot of crops are burn up uh
[42:44] down at the nursery down in Hampton
[42:46] where we got some of our plants from the
[42:47] church they told me down there that this
[42:49] summer they'd had a really difficult
[42:51] time trying to keep the plants healthy
[42:54] because it's stressed
[42:57] the plants the trees the bushes the
[43:00] flowers and I thought wow if it can
[43:03] stress a tree what about a servant of
[43:05] God or a son of God or a daughter of God
[43:08] whenever we go through things they
[43:10] talking about what they had to do to
[43:11] them and telling me what that they had
[43:13] to do you know to try to their best to
[43:15] keep them healthy and if they do that
[43:18] just with a nursery well I guess that's
[43:20] what church is
[43:22] really a
[43:24] nursery I guess we could take that two
[43:27] ways
[43:28] right amen a nurse where where we got
[43:31] plants and then a nurse where we got
[43:34] babies well Hallelujah praise the
[43:38] Lord I guess you'll just have to
[43:40] identify which one you are friend I
[43:42] ain't going to tell
[43:43] you but I pray God would just pour out
[43:46] his blessings on
[43:48] us I'm telling you what that service
[43:50] Sunday I have heard from all over this
[43:55] great big wide world
[43:59] wow our God is
[44:03] mindful how many has a need a request
[44:05] tonight on your heart talked to brother
[44:07] Frank Williams today and he was just
[44:10] expressing him and sister Jackie's
[44:12] desire to be in church and brother
[44:14] Frank's dealing with several things in
[44:15] his body and uh he's real prone to fall
[44:19] and things like that and he just wanted
[44:20] us to be remembered him we know we have
[44:23] several several needs among us tonight s
[44:27] needs in our church family let's just
[44:29] take it to the Lord before we read his
[44:33] word Lord Jesus we want to thank you
[44:37] tonight for the natural rain that we're
[44:39] getting on the outside we certainly
[44:42] needed it it's been dry and really hot
[44:45] and we can see the stress that it's
[44:48] caused on plants and trees and so
[44:51] on I look around the nature and I can
[44:54] see a parallel of what dry spells do to
[44:58] the church what dry spells do to a
[45:01] family to individuals and their walk
[45:04] with you it can become so hot and dry
[45:08] and seem like that been a while since
[45:10] we've had a good drenching rain but oh
[45:13] Lord how we rejoice when you send down
[45:16] the presence from the Holy Ghost and
[45:19] then we look around and it will be
[45:21] absolutely amazing after these rains
[45:24] that we get and what it will do to the
[45:27] grass and the trees and oh it's just
[45:30] remarkable I've been out here watering
[45:32] them like crazy and the city waterers
[45:35] kept them alive but there're just
[45:37] something about that water falling down
[45:39] out of Heaven it just does something to
[45:42] us we can come to church and sometimes
[45:45] we feel like we got our city water on we
[45:47] got to make oursel clap our hands we got
[45:49] to make oursel raise our hands and
[45:51] worship God and that might just sustain
[45:54] us a little bit until the Heavenly rain
[45:56] comes down
[45:57] Lord I just pray that you'd speak to us
[45:59] tonight from your word father we have so
[46:02] many needs among us but we're not
[46:05] discouraged by these needs as a matter
[46:07] of fact we're looking at these needs as
[46:10] opportunities of the supernatural amen
[46:13] opportunities by which you can manifest
[46:16] yourself Lord among us and we see you
[46:19] doing great things and we're looking for
[46:22] even greater would you help us tonight
[46:25] father be mindful of us help me to get
[46:28] out of the way shut my mouth to anything
[46:30] that would displease you Lord anoint me
[46:33] dear God and anoint the people that we
[46:35] can be able to receive from you tonight
[46:37] we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[46:40] ask it amen praise the Lord God bless
[46:45] you so happy to be together tonight we
[46:47] was able to um have the youth service
[46:51] the other night and our brother and
[46:53] sister white was able to come and share
[46:56] their testimony of some of the things
[46:58] that the Lord had done for them and has
[47:00] done my heart good bunch of the young
[47:03] people there and um you young people
[47:05] that were there did you really enjoy
[47:06] that it was some really good things that
[47:09] they shared with us and we so so
[47:11] appreciated as I was there thinking
[47:12] about it what it's going to be that day
[47:15] when we all gather together we go to
[47:17] sharing different testimonies things
[47:19] that God's done for us where he's
[47:22] brought us through and where he's
[47:23] brought us from won't that be a
[47:25] time let turn tonight if you would to
[47:27] Jeremiah chap 5 verse 24 we'll be
[47:32] reading the scriptures again about the
[47:33] former and the latter
[47:36] rain I truly believe that we're living
[47:38] in the season when God is wanting to
[47:42] bring a greater fulfillment to his word
[47:46] Jeremiah 5: 24 neither say they in their
[47:50] heart let us now fear the lord Our God
[47:53] that giveth reain both the former and
[47:57] the latter in his season he reserve us
[48:00] unto us the appointed weeks of the
[48:04] Harvest Hosea
[48:07] 6:3 then shall we know if notice now
[48:12] then shall we know if we follow on to
[48:17] know the Lord now you see a great
[48:21] portion of the people who come to the
[48:23] Lord Jesus as their savior they never go
[48:27] on to know him greater than just that
[48:31] he's a Son of God that died for their
[48:33] sins went to the Cross to set them free
[48:36] from sin and that's as far as they go
[48:39] but I don't want to stop there I want
[48:41] the rest of this verse then shall we
[48:44] know if we follow on to know the Lord
[48:47] his going forth is prepared as the
[48:50] morning and he shall come unto us notice
[48:54] not gifts not signs not wonders Miracles
[48:57] healings all that's part of it but a
[49:00] personal
[49:02] presence of the Lord himself for he
[49:05] shall come unto us as the rain as the
[49:11] latter and former rain unto the earth
[49:15] now we need healing we know that we need
[49:17] Miracles we need Supernatural there's
[49:20] several people in our church that need a
[49:21] miracle from God and we're believing
[49:23] that but we also not only want the gifts
[49:27] we want the giver yeah and I'll tell you
[49:30] what if I get the giver in the right
[49:32] perception and the right ability I've
[49:35] got access to every gift of the spirit
[49:37] of God and the church said that's right
[49:41] and he shall come unto us as the rain as
[49:44] the latter and the former Reign unto the
[49:46] Earth Joel chap 2 verse 23 be glad them
[49:51] ye children of Zion and rejoice in the
[49:53] Lord your God for he hath given listen
[49:57] he has given unto you the former Reign
[50:02] moderately so the former Reign came in a
[50:06] moderate Temperance now notice how it's
[50:08] going to come he's given it to you in a
[50:11] measure what was the measure it was a
[50:15] moderate measure for he has given unto
[50:18] you the former Reign moderately and he
[50:21] will cause to come down for you the rain
[50:25] the former rain rain and the latter rain
[50:29] in the first months may the Lord add the
[50:32] blessing to the reading of his word and
[50:33] the church said amen amen God bless you
[50:38] as we've been looking at it that truly
[50:41] as the people of God we are a prophetic
[50:43] class of people we are a people that
[50:46] believes that God utters things
[50:49] sometimes that are quite plain and
[50:50] simple in his word other times he gives
[50:54] things out in a symbolic form
[50:57] other times he gives it out in the form
[51:00] of a prophecy and it may lay in his
[51:02] written word for thousands of years
[51:05] until the hour arrives for that prophecy
[51:08] to come to pass sometimes that prophecy
[51:11] will be veiled in symbols and then if it
[51:14] is it will take a profit to take that
[51:17] symbol and to be able to take the Twist
[51:20] and the turns out of it to make it
[51:23] simple where we can understand it now
[51:25] sometimes God will prophesy things in
[51:28] such a way that it doesn't take a
[51:30] prophet to be able to interpret it but
[51:32] other times he gives it in a way you
[51:35] take Isaiah 7:14 unto us a child is born
[51:38] a son is given a virgin shall conceive
[51:41] bring forth the son that really didn't
[51:43] need an interpretation because of the
[51:45] way that God sent it yet there were many
[51:48] other prophecies giving about the Advent
[51:51] of the coming of the Lord Jesus that
[51:53] took a prophetic understanding and
[51:55] that's why God sent a prophet to forerun
[51:58] his first coming that he could prepare
[52:01] the hearts of the people for the coming
[52:03] of the Lord and that's why we believe
[52:06] that the Advent of a prophet in the last
[52:09] days is absolutely essential in order to
[52:13] prepare a people to be able to meet the
[52:16] Lord Jesus in the body change if it was
[52:20] not absolutely essential at his first
[52:22] Advent why did he ever sent John the
[52:25] Baptist because he wind up getting
[52:26] getting his head cut off because of it
[52:28] so it must have been of Great Value to
[52:31] the economy of God to send a prophet
[52:35] like that so what was he doing he had a
[52:38] preparation message in order to prepare
[52:41] a people that they would be able to
[52:44] accept what was coming after John the
[52:47] same way with the Elijah of our day that
[52:50] God would have never sent him had it not
[52:53] been of a great essential necess
[52:56] necessity now naturally Satan is going
[52:58] to do what he can to block that if he
[53:02] cannot block it from coming that after
[53:05] it comes he will try to devalue that
[53:09] message and what's the sad thing about
[53:11] it is he will do that devaluing many
[53:14] times from those who were formerly
[53:16] identified with it or even those who sit
[53:19] among it and said well yeah yeah we we
[53:22] can see that you know I I I'll take the
[53:25] message when it's thus sayth the Lords
[53:27] but the rest of it I ain't got no use
[53:29] for it I I don't understand that type of
[53:32] mentality so who do the preachers who
[53:34] would say such a thing think that they
[53:37] are that they would under undervalue a
[53:40] prophet of God that according to the
[53:43] symbolism that God gave John on the
[53:45] aisle of patmas that our Prophet
[53:47] messenger was in the right hand of Jesus
[53:49] let me just update you on that John
[53:52] didn't see me in there John didn't see
[53:54] brother Tim PR in there he did not see
[53:57] brother Ron Spencer in the right hand of
[53:59] Jesus he didn't see none of the brothers
[54:02] ministering Brothers here but he saw our
[54:05] church age messenger now to me that
[54:08] gives him more value than it does me and
[54:12] whether you like it or not it gives him
[54:14] more value than it does you so God give
[54:17] him then a special hidden Mana by which
[54:21] he would have to feed on that hidden
[54:23] Mana first and then once he fed on the
[54:26] hidden Mana he would bring that message
[54:28] to us and remember it'll only be a
[54:31] hundreds of a percent that will ever
[54:33] even hear what he's got to say and then
[54:37] there'll be an even smaller percentage
[54:39] of that that do hear that will stay with
[54:43] what he has to say because all of those
[54:46] who go out don't always remember how
[54:49] important it is to say only what the
[54:52] messenger has spoken they will begin to
[54:55] add here
[54:56] and take away there and no and the word
[54:59] is no longer pure and the Revival dies
[55:03] is that right now friends we're living
[55:05] in that day when it is happening right
[55:09] before our eyes it's amazing some of the
[55:12] ministers in the message that have gone
[55:15] through certain doctrines that the
[55:17] prophet taught well you know what we
[55:19] don't need that one no more and that was
[55:21] just a a southern thing and and and that
[55:24] was during the time of the 50s and the
[55:26] 60s that brother brandham was cheering
[55:28] we really don't need that and then other
[55:30] said well you know the gift thing that
[55:32] was only for the brandham Tabernacle you
[55:34] might need to study a little bit farther
[55:36] and you'll find out that it wasn't just
[55:38] for the brandom Tabernacle and others
[55:40] said well we don't need that we don't
[55:42] need that so you know who are we
[55:44] supposed to believe we supposed to
[55:46] believe the one that God sent or the men
[55:49] that are here to supposedly update what
[55:52] God had that Prophet to say and tell us
[55:54] well we don't need this no more we don't
[55:56] need that no more but what if they take
[56:00] something away from us and it just so
[56:03] happens we do need it for the
[56:07] Rapture are you really are we really
[56:11] going to let men do that to us well I
[56:15] can answer for myself tonight no I am
[56:19] not anybody with me no I don't care how
[56:23] close a friend they are to me I don't
[56:25] care how many years I've known them and
[56:27] what camaraderie that re that we have
[56:29] when it comes to that word I'll stand on
[56:32] it by myself if I have to come on
[56:35] somebody I don't believe I'll have to
[56:36] cuz God's got a people around the world
[56:39] but my point is this that we want to
[56:42] make sure what we're feeding on what
[56:44] we're listening to what we're taking in
[56:47] that men aren't spicing and slicing out
[56:50] and taking this and we don't need that
[56:53] why in the world do we need that in this
[56:54] end time we do not but but Satan has
[56:57] always done that to the people of God
[56:59] remember he started in the Garden of
[57:01] Eden was Eve well yeah God has said that
[57:04] but God does know why you why in the day
[57:06] you eat thereof you shall be as Gods you
[57:09] will not surely die all he had to do is
[57:13] make her question that one thing and we
[57:16] realize we are here today because of
[57:18] what she did in the Garden of Eden is
[57:21] that right now Satan knows then by
[57:24] sewing the original seed word with just
[57:28] a little bit of Doubt then it produced a
[57:31] crop which was what king which was a
[57:35] mongrel or a hybrid serpent seed so it
[57:39] was the mixing of Eve with the serpent
[57:43] now remember Cain in one sense of the
[57:45] word had two fathers he had a father of
[57:49] his body which was The Serpent and he
[57:52] had another Father which was the father
[57:55] of his nature and that was the
[57:59] devil well don't look at me too Qui cuz
[58:02] you're the same way when before you're
[58:04] born again you had a natural daddy which
[58:07] SED you in your mother's womb and then
[58:10] your daddy also might have handed you a
[58:13] a human patronage but you had another
[58:16] nature the one who was to who was the
[58:19] closest kin to you and every one of us
[58:21] come to this Earth with the nature of
[58:23] the devil in US amen well well praise
[58:26] the Lord that's exactly right oh my and
[58:29] Satan's been sewing the hybridized seed
[58:33] since the very beginning so in every age
[58:36] it's like that God swed the seed word
[58:38] and then God would take the messenger
[58:40] from the earth and men after that
[58:43] messenger would leave would start vying
[58:45] for position and they wanted to move in
[58:48] to be the big guy this that and the
[58:50] other and then one would pull this way
[58:53] one would pull that way one would pull
[58:55] that way and would make their own little
[58:57] branches of what Luther said or of what
[59:00] Wesley said or of what Pentecost said
[59:03] and the message is exactly the same way
[59:06] many of the men that you hear brother
[59:08] randam talk about on tape hardly any of
[59:11] them hardly any of them that he mentions
[59:15] on tape even many of them that he
[59:17] ordained to preach when he come right
[59:19] down to the very end of their walk with
[59:21] God stayed true to that word thank God
[59:25] there were some but many of them only
[59:28] use the message as a platform to
[59:31] introduce their C now part of the seeds
[59:34] that we are reaping right now and in
[59:37] 2024 were seeds that have been
[59:40] previously sown back in the 70s ' 80s
[59:44] 90s early 2000s now they are coming up
[59:48] because the Harvest rain is Begin to
[59:51] Fall in the end time so you know it
[59:54] started out the tape thing where we have
[59:56] it now to where they don't really even
[59:58] believe in going to church anymore and
[1:00:00] and they're saying that their homes are
[1:00:03] actually their churches so that's their
[1:00:05] home Church woo a't that nice
[1:00:12] Antichrist you can call it nice if you
[1:00:13] want to it's Antichrist it's against
[1:00:16] Christ
[1:00:17] teaching well praise the Lord but now
[1:00:20] that started out years ago very gently
[1:00:23] very easy you know from some of the
[1:00:25] folks around the Tabernacle and just
[1:00:27] well we'll play a tape for this meeting
[1:00:29] and a tape for that one and little by
[1:00:31] little start easing out the god call
[1:00:34] Ministry now what's it doing so now in
[1:00:37] order to take communion then you have a
[1:00:39] driveby spot so you got to drive by spot
[1:00:43] to where that you pick up your communion
[1:00:46] wi and then they want to tell you what
[1:00:48] time to have
[1:00:50] it oh oh okay now somebody I'm open for
[1:00:54] correction here tonight so stand up put
[1:00:57] your finger on the Bible page or the
[1:00:59] message page or the prophet said it and
[1:01:01] I'll retract my former statements but
[1:01:03] until you do I'm going to keep on with
[1:01:05] it so where did that come from seeds
[1:01:08] that were started years ago now people
[1:01:11] would have never thought it would have
[1:01:13] ever gotten to the spot that it is now
[1:01:15] to word that the brandom Tabernacle sits
[1:01:18] there empty musty and molded and the
[1:01:21] only thing you can do in the brandom
[1:01:23] Tabernacle even if you go in in there to
[1:01:26] this day is have silent
[1:01:30] prayer all you got to do is go to the
[1:01:32] website and look at it just ready this
[1:01:34] evening silent
[1:01:38] prayer silent
[1:01:42] prayer so that's what we're doing so
[1:01:44] where did this seed come from years and
[1:01:47] years
[1:01:48] ago so you see as we now here we are
[1:01:52] believers in this day so if it goes on
[1:01:54] another year 5 years 10 years whatever
[1:01:57] more we also are sewing seeds too every
[1:02:02] Ministry especially those that have a
[1:02:03] worldwide effect they are globally
[1:02:06] sewing seeds every young man every older
[1:02:10] man every all all the brothers that have
[1:02:13] an effect upon the people of God they
[1:02:15] are sewing seeds now those seeds whether
[1:02:17] it's at a youth camp whether it's at a
[1:02:19] family camp or a convention and then
[1:02:22] Brothers will come in and they'll seow
[1:02:23] their seed well for some it's going
[1:02:25] going to be seed of intellectualism for
[1:02:28] some it will be more of the emotional
[1:02:31] side and for some it will be those that
[1:02:35] desire to strike a balance between the
[1:02:38] intellectual part and the emotional part
[1:02:41] because they know they need a certain
[1:02:43] amount of their faith to believe God
[1:02:46] it'd be nice if God would believe for me
[1:02:48] every day but he don't there's times
[1:02:50] that God strikes our heart with his face
[1:02:53] but that's not the way it's going to
[1:02:55] happen every day how many knows that's
[1:02:56] right so I need an element of my faith
[1:03:01] that at times that's what I will have to
[1:03:03] believe with but I also need emotion I
[1:03:07] need to be able to worship I need to
[1:03:10] praise I myself need to assemble myself
[1:03:14] together with the rest of the children
[1:03:17] of God in our
[1:03:19] assembly well praise the Lord there's
[1:03:22] something to me about coming to church
[1:03:24] now you know I I realize that people of
[1:03:27] God Is So spiritual that you can stay
[1:03:28] home and you don't really need to go to
[1:03:30] church and you see the problem is they
[1:03:33] don't believe the very Prophet that they
[1:03:35] say they do they want to make him
[1:03:37] infallible but I call them
[1:03:40] Liars over the internet and I'll call
[1:03:43] them Liars to their face because God's
[1:03:46] Prophet said if God is in your heart you
[1:03:49] can't wait for them doors to open to get
[1:03:51] to the house of God now why don't you
[1:03:53] press play on that because you're a
[1:03:56] deceiver and a hypocrite that's why on
[1:03:59] well Glory the Bible says in the book of
[1:04:02] Hebrews forsaking not the assembling of
[1:04:06] ourselves together not you staying at
[1:04:08] home at your house and pushing play and
[1:04:11] sitting there to eating a bowl of ice
[1:04:12] cream and a piece of chocolate cake and
[1:04:14] some Southern sweet tea that is
[1:04:19] blasphemy and say you're replacing God's
[1:04:22] people coming together in the house of
[1:04:24] God or if you want some quotes email me
[1:04:27] I'll blow you away what what the prophet
[1:04:30] said some of them are actually fearful
[1:04:33] I'd like to take one night here and just
[1:04:36] go through it and show you what God's
[1:04:38] Prophet said about going to church it
[1:04:40] will show you how much unbelievers we
[1:04:43] have around this message well glory to
[1:04:49] God there's something about us gathering
[1:04:52] together you with your lick of fire and
[1:04:54] you and you and you and we all get
[1:04:57] together come on somebody there's
[1:04:59] something about special meetings and we
[1:05:01] get more of the saints of God gathered
[1:05:04] together and all and they're just it's
[1:05:06] an awesome thing isn't it but you
[1:05:08] realize Satan started sewing some of
[1:05:10] these seeds now years ago and they were
[1:05:13] sewn so slightly and so subtle and they
[1:05:18] never even thought my years ago whenever
[1:05:20] I was preaching against some of this
[1:05:22] stuff and some of my closest friends
[1:05:25] said I do wish brother Donnie would shut
[1:05:28] his mouth on some of this stuff he's
[1:05:31] preaching we don't need that that's not
[1:05:33] even needful for us it's not even
[1:05:36] needful it don't bother us oh my of
[1:05:39] course now they realize it does bother
[1:05:42] us now they do realize the Holy Ghost
[1:05:46] had that answer years and years ago
[1:05:50] before it ever arrived to where it is
[1:05:52] now you see the Holy Ghost knew it was
[1:05:55] coming coming to this well amen the Holy
[1:05:59] Ghost knew it was coming to the end time
[1:06:02] to where the seeds are going to be
[1:06:05] manifest and he always has men of God
[1:06:08] that he can Inspire with inspiration and
[1:06:11] sometimes they'll preach things years
[1:06:14] before it ever even happens and we
[1:06:17] realize that's the way it's always been
[1:06:19] so here we are then the seed time and
[1:06:22] the Harvest is here now remember I your
[1:06:24] brother R and preached that our sermon
[1:06:26] called the spoken Lord's Original Seed
[1:06:28] he goes to tiffon Georgia and he
[1:06:30] preaches in time seed sign in time seed
[1:06:36] sign they had two services at
[1:06:38] Jeffersonville he drives Down to Georgia
[1:06:40] and he preaches there on on Monday night
[1:06:42] so he kind of brings it all together so
[1:06:45] if you're listening to end time seed
[1:06:46] sign go ahead and listen to the the
[1:06:49] spoken words original seat and he'll
[1:06:51] follow up with that and brings the
[1:06:52] highlights in there and he's showing us
[1:06:55] that in every age you have exactly the
[1:06:57] same thing that God will send a
[1:06:59] messenger and that Messenger will seow
[1:07:01] the seed and Satan then will come in and
[1:07:04] had a little bit of this and a little
[1:07:06] bit of that now what he wants to do is
[1:07:08] hybridize that seed and get it in the
[1:07:11] ground as soon as possible now get it in
[1:07:15] the ground it don't do no good to keep
[1:07:17] it just in the minds and in the hearts
[1:07:20] of some of these so-called message
[1:07:22] preachers but he wants to get it into
[1:07:24] the ground where's the ground your
[1:07:27] hearts your hearts right there that's
[1:07:30] why that preachers have to have a
[1:07:34] following you ever see a preacher with a
[1:07:37] church full of
[1:07:38] cows what about goats well maybe I mean
[1:07:42] I'm talking about the four Le ones or
[1:07:44] are a church full of jack rabbits say a
[1:07:45] church full of squirrels what does most
[1:07:48] preachers want they don't want jack
[1:07:49] rabbits they don't want squirrels they
[1:07:51] want people they want people so when
[1:07:55] they get to we the seed within
[1:07:57] themselves you understand that a
[1:07:58] preacher a perverted preacher starts
[1:08:01] conceiving whatever this is that he's
[1:08:04] ordained I hope you understand men have
[1:08:06] are ordained of God they are ordained of
[1:08:09] God to come in this message that will
[1:08:12] never be born again ordained of old the
[1:08:16] Bible says orain of old to this
[1:08:21] condemnation so there's men that have
[1:08:23] come in they've said under the quietness
[1:08:25] of the spirit and they will get a little
[1:08:27] bit of influence here and a little bit
[1:08:29] of influence there and then when they
[1:08:31] arrive to the place that they feel the
[1:08:33] motivation to make their move then they
[1:08:36] will start you know this clicker Clan
[1:08:38] whatever it is and they they they
[1:08:40] themselves first started conceiving this
[1:08:43] questionable form of the message of the
[1:08:46] hour I don't know about that now I don't
[1:08:48] know about that I'll say with brother
[1:08:49] brandom as long as he's in the word are
[1:08:51] you kidding me you're going to say that
[1:08:53] about a word prophet a Vindicated
[1:08:56] Prophet as if though we would know more
[1:08:58] about it than a Vindicated Prophet would
[1:09:00] yeah it's hard to believe but there's
[1:09:02] been all kinds of them and there'll be
[1:09:03] more so the man conceives this within
[1:09:06] himself then it starts coming up from
[1:09:09] within his being and it start that's all
[1:09:12] he can see that oh my it's all he can
[1:09:14] see what's the seven Thunders the parara
[1:09:17] or whatever Doctrine it is you know
[1:09:18] where brother R's wrong here and I take
[1:09:20] this and I take that and I take this and
[1:09:22] I take that then he starts putting his
[1:09:24] ideology together it conceives within
[1:09:27] his own soul then it's like he becomes
[1:09:29] pregnated with what he feels like is the
[1:09:32] word and now the baby's growing within
[1:09:35] him the seed word he thinks is oh my oh
[1:09:38] W I can no longer stay around these
[1:09:41] brothers you know cuz they're I mean you
[1:09:43] know they're just making too much out of
[1:09:44] brother Brandon what in the world will
[1:09:46] they stand up and read quotes about
[1:09:47] brother brandom well I guess that's
[1:09:49] because that's the way they're done in
[1:09:50] the Old Testament whenever Daniel read
[1:09:53] quotes from Jeremiah and then titim must
[1:09:55] have read quotes from Paul and and the
[1:09:57] church agents that that exactly the same
[1:10:00] thing is that right honestly don't
[1:10:02] understand the preachers that don't read
[1:10:03] quotes
[1:10:05] myself well praise the Lord but you see
[1:10:07] they get heavy with this child then they
[1:10:10] will start pulling off and the first
[1:10:13] thing they want to do is start sewing
[1:10:14] the seed now I couldn't say it while I
[1:10:16] was there under brother Tim I couldn't
[1:10:18] say it while I was Hing to brother Ron I
[1:10:21] couldn't say it when I was with this
[1:10:22] brother that brother oh I've been
[1:10:24] holding this in my heart all this time
[1:10:26] oh my I want to share it with you I want
[1:10:28] to share it with you and I want to share
[1:10:30] it with you and then there it starts now
[1:10:32] we got another crop now they're still
[1:10:35] identified generally as message
[1:10:37] followers but before long you notice
[1:10:40] them that they believe that he's already
[1:10:42] come which is the Peruan Doctrine so
[1:10:44] they believe he's already come so then
[1:10:47] they no longer take communion and if
[1:10:49] he's already come then there's no need
[1:10:52] to pray for Revival because the book's
[1:10:54] already Clos and if he already come then
[1:10:58] we don't really have to live Holiness
[1:11:00] anymore so it don't matter what you look
[1:11:03] like it don't matter what you dress like
[1:11:05] because he's already here and we've
[1:11:08] arrived well you know if they go that
[1:11:10] way then there they go they start
[1:11:11] pulling off pulling off pulling off
[1:11:14] pulling off then they get their own
[1:11:15] field and they get their own farm and
[1:11:17] they get their own Farmers preachers and
[1:11:20] then they start sewing the same seat out
[1:11:22] from under the headship boy I wish
[1:11:24] somebody hear me tonight
[1:11:25] under the headship of this one man and
[1:11:28] all these things always point back to
[1:11:31] one
[1:11:33] man I feel sorry for these one
[1:11:36] men they're going to stand before God at
[1:11:39] the day of judgment and give an account
[1:11:42] for every soul that they have led
[1:11:46] astray they will stand before God I'm
[1:11:49] talking about if they don't repent they
[1:11:51] will stand before God and give an
[1:11:53] account for sewing Discord in the body
[1:11:57] now watch so it started happening years
[1:11:59] ago now it went to the intellectual side
[1:12:01] around the message for years and years
[1:12:03] boy if you believed in shouting and
[1:12:05] stuff worshiping God and just hardly
[1:12:07] having any emotion at all he was
[1:12:09] considered to be a Pentecostal I've been
[1:12:11] considered that for years and years uh
[1:12:13] you know but I I really never did take
[1:12:15] it really as a slam in my face I was
[1:12:17] always proud to be identified with
[1:12:19] Pentecost not so much as ze's treat but
[1:12:22] Acts chapter 2 but you realize then that
[1:12:25] some will say well now wait a minute
[1:12:26] wait a minut we we've got to have a move
[1:12:27] of God here because our young people are
[1:12:30] backsliding our young people can't be
[1:12:32] kept young people cannot be kept with
[1:12:34] just an intellectual conception they
[1:12:37] need to know a true and a living God let
[1:12:40] me tell you something it ain't just
[1:12:41] young people that know that need to know
[1:12:43] that it's us old people
[1:12:46] too so what did Sayan do he started
[1:12:48] hybridizing then in the form of farmer
[1:12:51] preachers farmer preachers started
[1:12:53] sewing the seeds with all types of
[1:12:55] different thing so we had this click
[1:12:57] that click that click that click that
[1:12:58] click we got them all over the world and
[1:13:01] many of them now thank God have
[1:13:03] collapsed because many of them initial
[1:13:06] leaders that started founding all of
[1:13:08] these moves many years ago many of them
[1:13:11] have gone on now of course the clicks
[1:13:13] are divided and and we know that the sth
[1:13:15] under thing and this and that there's
[1:13:17] still a few of them that are around and
[1:13:19] one of their main guys right now says
[1:13:20] he's the Holy Ghost so that like lets
[1:13:23] you kind of know where they are
[1:13:25] I don't know how in the world an idiot
[1:13:27] could stand in the ppit and claim to be
[1:13:31] such a thing brother Donnie that's crude
[1:13:33] speaking I figure you understand it
[1:13:35] don't you you me to use some great big
[1:13:38] four barrel word about that long that
[1:13:39] you don't understand and I'm saying the
[1:13:42] same thing
[1:13:44] idiot ain't got enough sense to get in
[1:13:46] out of the
[1:13:48] rain well they're getting in out of the
[1:13:50] ladder rain all right because they're so
[1:13:52] in their heart and their soul full of
[1:13:55] Discord and Seed of the
[1:13:58] serpent oh thank you Jesus thank you
[1:14:02] Jesus but on down through this time
[1:14:05] there were true Servants of God and they
[1:14:08] just kept Desiring to preach the word
[1:14:11] preach the word now remember years ago
[1:14:13] we must give them credit for this time
[1:14:15] frame that in the late 60s after the
[1:14:18] prophet left 70s 80s uh there was there
[1:14:20] was many sincere brothers that were
[1:14:22] preaching the message and the message
[1:14:24] was not available on computer there was
[1:14:27] no software to be able to cross
[1:14:29] reference what the prophet had said to
[1:14:31] pull up the quotes concerning a certain
[1:14:33] subject and they might get a few quotes
[1:14:35] and they might make a little pet idea
[1:14:37] out of it but they were not doing it
[1:14:40] trying to deceive anybody or so Discord
[1:14:43] they just don't not have availability of
[1:14:45] the message but a preacher has no excuse
[1:14:48] now if he lives where he can afford a
[1:14:51] computer if he can afford to get one
[1:14:54] I'll tell you what it is is now they
[1:14:56] know them other quotes are there but it
[1:14:58] would be able to blow their narrative
[1:15:00] out of the water so they're not going to
[1:15:02] read them well come on now now it makes
[1:15:05] it more damnable for the preachers when
[1:15:08] they're studying on whatever it is and
[1:15:11] they see this quote that one that one
[1:15:13] and that one which would absolutely go
[1:15:16] contrary to what they're trying to
[1:15:18] project so what do they do just simply
[1:15:20] leave them out now you're getting into
[1:15:24] willful sinning because what Satan wants
[1:15:27] to do is every man you think Satan don't
[1:15:30] want me to do that you think Satan don't
[1:15:33] want brother Dar to do that all these
[1:15:35] different men that have an influence of
[1:15:37] speaking around the world because no
[1:15:39] matter what you preach and who you are
[1:15:42] if God calls you God gives you favor
[1:15:44] with people you can't get that on your
[1:15:47] own and once God gives you that favor
[1:15:50] that's why people say well how in the
[1:15:52] world could people follow men when they
[1:15:54] get off when they get so far off the
[1:15:57] word well they look at him and they love
[1:15:59] him and they trust him you shouldn't
[1:16:01] follow a man because you love him you
[1:16:04] shouldn't follow a man because you trust
[1:16:06] him you should follow him because he
[1:16:08] stays true to the word and if he ever
[1:16:11] leaves the word you leave
[1:16:16] him is that what the prophet
[1:16:19] Tau well praise the Lord now what God
[1:16:23] did was whenever he first started this
[1:16:25] church and Jesus was the first one to
[1:16:28] mention this word church and he said
[1:16:30] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[1:16:32] and never been uttered before it never
[1:16:34] been spoken so it was new imagine the
[1:16:37] first time the devil heard he thought
[1:16:38] what in the world is church now we know
[1:16:41] the devil knows all the languages of
[1:16:42] course and he knew the Greek word of
[1:16:44] what church meant Ecclesia that it was a
[1:16:47] people called out from their
[1:16:50] homes called out from their
[1:16:52] homes to meet and a certain place and
[1:16:56] Satan thought wow this is absolutely
[1:16:59] brilliant this is genius but he still
[1:17:02] didn't know what it was yet cuz Jesus
[1:17:03] hadn't form one and they were just
[1:17:05] following Jesus around from capernium to
[1:17:07] Galilee here and there and there so
[1:17:09] Jesus actually never got to preach a
[1:17:12] sermon in a church well let me reate
[1:17:15] that he didn't until after the Holy
[1:17:17] Ghost come on the day Pentecost because
[1:17:20] they didn't stay in one place and Jesus
[1:17:22] didn't have a church in capernium he
[1:17:24] didn't have one in the upper coast of
[1:17:26] Galilee he didn't have one in any of the
[1:17:28] places there but they were just
[1:17:29] following around and wherever Jesus
[1:17:31] would go the people would come where he
[1:17:33] is same thing today when Jesus shows up
[1:17:37] people somehow find out where Jesus is
[1:17:40] amen they find out where he's Healing
[1:17:42] The Sick they find out where the truth
[1:17:44] is they find out where he's delivering
[1:17:47] people and you know what they do they
[1:17:49] show up where he
[1:17:50] is but can you imagine now whenever they
[1:17:53] first start and they formulate then a
[1:17:56] church so they started gathering
[1:17:58] together and they go to doing it and it
[1:18:00] wasn't no time at all in Acts 1 ver8
[1:18:04] that Paul or Galatians rather that Paul
[1:18:07] begin to tell them oh what what happened
[1:18:10] what happened to you at one time you
[1:18:12] would have pulled your eyes out and
[1:18:14] given them to me have I become your
[1:18:16] enemy because I've told you the truth
[1:18:19] and the judaizers from Jerusalem what
[1:18:21] did they do they come down and they was
[1:18:23] going to try to convert the Gentiles and
[1:18:26] so on they said you cannot be saved if
[1:18:29] you're not circumcised what was they
[1:18:31] doing taking the message of the Cross
[1:18:33] trying to cross hybridize it with
[1:18:37] circumcision now Satan knew don't deny
[1:18:40] the cross don't deny water baptism
[1:18:42] that's okay that's okay and people think
[1:18:44] the devil is just a total denial of
[1:18:47] everything no the biggest lie that was
[1:18:49] ever told had over 90% truth to it so
[1:18:54] Satan did didn't mind them preaching the
[1:18:55] cross he didn't mind them preaching
[1:18:57] water baptism but just hybridized it
[1:19:01] with circumcision now accept the blood
[1:19:04] of the Lord Jesus that's okay I'm all
[1:19:06] right with that accept water baptism I'm
[1:19:08] okay with that but just believe that
[1:19:11] you've got to do this and you've got to
[1:19:14] do that and you've got to do that or
[1:19:16] you're not saved and when you believe
[1:19:18] that you're taking away from the power
[1:19:21] of the Cross so what was he doing hybrid
[1:19:24] iing I know that them judaizers didn't
[1:19:27] say initially now you know what that
[1:19:29] Paul's a false prophet I'll tell you
[1:19:31] what that man talking to a pillar of
[1:19:33] fire and a light while whoever heard of
[1:19:34] such a thing and they may have started
[1:19:36] out real gentle now look Brethren we're
[1:19:41] not trying to do away with the cross
[1:19:44] we're not trying to do away with water
[1:19:46] baptism oh thank God for dealing with
[1:19:49] you all we're grateful but you just need
[1:19:52] to pick up Paul is leaving out
[1:19:55] circumcision he's leaving out worship on
[1:19:57] the Sabbath day he's leaving out the
[1:20:00] levitical order he's leaving out the
[1:20:02] Feast of the trumpets A Feast of
[1:20:04] Tabernacle he's leaving out all this
[1:20:06] stuff and brethren we are just trying to
[1:20:09] go back to the
[1:20:12] Bible
[1:20:15] uhuh it never ceases to amaze
[1:20:18] me how some of these message
[1:20:22] preachers when they run across a dark
[1:20:25] that the prophet
[1:20:27] taught and they always go this way well
[1:20:31] I can't find well the Bible says it that
[1:20:35] way oh my and yet every one of them same
[1:20:39] preachers will say well each church is
[1:20:42] Sovereign I'd like for you to show me
[1:20:44] the scripture where it says
[1:20:48] that so you know what they do hybridize
[1:20:51] so they use that each church is
[1:20:54] sovereign so if we want to do this and
[1:20:56] that and the other in our church we can
[1:20:57] you know we don't have to exactly comply
[1:21:00] to the teaching of the message cuz our
[1:21:01] church is sov and where did you get that
[1:21:04] statement out yes Acts Corinthians
[1:21:08] Philippians Ephesians fimon John Jude
[1:21:11] Hebrews
[1:21:13] James so what do they do
[1:21:16] hybiz so they mix quotes scriptures
[1:21:21] theology then they get books from Amazon
[1:21:27] and a few little things from the Houston
[1:21:37] guy I hope that man can get
[1:21:41] straight I
[1:21:44] do because if he don't when he stands
[1:21:46] before God the tens of thousands of
[1:21:49] souls that will be damned to hell
[1:21:54] because of his
[1:21:55] teaching and he will stand before
[1:21:58] almighty God with the
[1:22:00] blood of countless of
[1:22:03] souls on his hands I don't know about
[1:22:06] you I don't want to see nobody
[1:22:09] lost
[1:22:12] nobody what it do in the days of Luther
[1:22:15] same thing days of Wesley same thing
[1:22:18] whenever brother Seymour out in a Zeus
[1:22:21] Street in California a black man blind
[1:22:24] in one eye and whenever he began to
[1:22:27] receive the understanding about the
[1:22:29] gifts of the Spirit and that there was
[1:22:31] to be a restoration and the gifts were
[1:22:34] supposed to come back in the body again
[1:22:37] well it started out initially seemingly
[1:22:39] good and the spirit of God started
[1:22:41] falling in Ireland it started falling in
[1:22:44] whales it started falling all over the
[1:22:46] world it was a supernatural move of God
[1:22:48] it was not a manmade move and the spirit
[1:22:50] of God started moving then did what
[1:22:52] happened
[1:22:54] Satan got some farmer preachers together
[1:22:58] and they said hey
[1:23:00] brothers you know what we need you do we
[1:23:03] need to make the initial
[1:23:06] evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in
[1:23:11] tongues and the prophet said when they
[1:23:13] done it they organized right then now
[1:23:17] they never mention
[1:23:20] organization look at them early fathers
[1:23:23] I've read some of their statements it
[1:23:25] was never brother Joe their desire to
[1:23:28] make an organization but they felt like
[1:23:31] who was it the same serpent that talked
[1:23:35] to Eve in the Garden of
[1:23:37] Eden but before long in another
[1:23:40] generation if you didn't speak in
[1:23:42] tongues you didn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:23:45] now I know many of our message people
[1:23:46] have ever been through that and you've
[1:23:48] never seen it but unless you have seen
[1:23:50] it you don't realize what an absolute
[1:23:52] error that is that if they beat you on
[1:23:55] the back
[1:23:58] they are you done bite your tongue
[1:24:02] that's all you got and many of them said
[1:24:03] they have the Holy Ghost and they didn't
[1:24:05] have no Holy Ghost come on and yet they
[1:24:07] go right back out and backside and get
[1:24:09] away from the Lord and Satan knew all
[1:24:13] alone if I can
[1:24:17] hariz it'll make Pentecost to where they
[1:24:20] don't speak in tongues they ain't got it
[1:24:23] yeah
[1:24:26] do you honestly think he's going to let
[1:24:29] the greatest
[1:24:30] truth that's ever been on the earth a
[1:24:33] Comm that's culminated in the end time
[1:24:37] without getting right inside of that
[1:24:40] truth and splitting it every way from
[1:24:43] this
[1:24:46] Sunday and be able to walk Before the
[1:24:49] Throne of God and say hey
[1:24:51] God like to call your attention down to
[1:24:54] the
[1:24:56] message or he might say it critically
[1:24:59] like this the
[1:25:04] message look at them
[1:25:07] God they're divided they're split they
[1:25:11] fuss they fight they
[1:25:16] argue how many brid's revivals if we had
[1:25:19] in the
[1:25:21] message you know what we do when we do
[1:25:23] that making another spiritual
[1:25:29] organization that okay this is a r of
[1:25:31] Revival so we all get to the place and
[1:25:34] where it's a seven Thunder and if you
[1:25:35] ain't got seven Thunder
[1:25:38] blood on your
[1:25:45] alter there is no such a thing that's
[1:25:49] right it was the blood of
[1:25:52] Jesus come on
[1:25:54] somebody and people stand in the mirror
[1:25:57] and try to pronounce the word
[1:26:00] perusia watch their
[1:26:05] lips and that's the evidence of being
[1:26:08] bride well the evidence of being bride
[1:26:10] now is jumping running shouting
[1:26:14] hollering the evidence of being bride is
[1:26:16] you say Amen to every
[1:26:19] word and it don't just come from your
[1:26:22] mouth it comes from your life
[1:26:24] and let me just say this I preached
[1:26:26] about the fourth light a few weeks ago
[1:26:28] the fourth light is not a repeating or a
[1:26:33] repetition of the
[1:26:36] third the third light was the
[1:26:38] restoration of gifts the fourth light is
[1:26:41] not the third
[1:26:43] light it is the culmination of all four
[1:26:47] Satan by fourth death Messengers cut
[1:26:50] down the tree and it seemed like he
[1:26:52] absolutely wiped it out but God said I
[1:26:55] will restore sayeth the Lord and God
[1:26:58] started it back in the days of Luther
[1:27:00] and He restored it and yet look at all
[1:27:02] the fanaticism that followed Luther's
[1:27:05] Revival the prophet said it was no great
[1:27:07] thing that Luther could withstand the
[1:27:09] Catholic church and get by with it but
[1:27:11] he could hold his head above the
[1:27:13] fanaticism that followed his Revival
[1:27:16] same with Wesley same with Pentecost let
[1:27:19] me go ahead and say it same with the
[1:27:20] message of the hour can we hold our head
[1:27:24] above the fanaticism that follows this
[1:27:27] revival I say yes we can yes we do yes
[1:27:34] we will we will not let fanaticism
[1:27:38] dictate who we
[1:27:40] [Applause]
[1:27:41] are well brother Don if there's Wildfire
[1:27:44] I'd not know I'd rather not have any
[1:27:46] that's exact opposite of what prophet
[1:27:48] said he said he'd rather have a little
[1:27:49] bit of wildfire no fire at all if we get
[1:27:52] a little bit of wildfire don't worry
[1:27:54] about it we know how to tame Wildfire
[1:27:56] ain't none of you was any wilder than I
[1:27:58] was I got tamed down pretty good I
[1:28:00] reckon some of you think Lord have mercy
[1:28:03] I ain't never seen such wild stuff you
[1:28:04] ought to seen me back in Pentecost I
[1:28:06] would have scared you te totally out of
[1:28:08] your mind and God got a hold to me and
[1:28:10] tame me down I'd rather have people a
[1:28:12] little bit extreme emotional than some
[1:28:14] of you dry High Church of Christ that
[1:28:16] don't ever even move you don't even nod
[1:28:19] your head you don't even worship God at
[1:28:21] all come on somebody I wish somebody
[1:28:24] around here would want to serve God and
[1:28:27] worship God in spite of the fanaticism
[1:28:31] in spite of the other side let's find
[1:28:33] the middle of the road and let's go home
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:47] church now I'm going to be honest with
[1:28:49] you I ate some of Carol's cooking today
[1:28:51] and she might have slipped some that
[1:28:52] gunpowder in on me again
[1:28:59] I've got several emails and texts from
[1:29:01] people saying please don't stop the

[1:29:25] cucumber start with a
[1:29:29] cucumber if you want a
[1:29:33] church start with the word of
[1:29:37] God so what do preachers want then when
[1:29:40] they start with a portion of the word
[1:29:42] plus their idea plus this book from
[1:29:44] Amazon Plus this book from the smiley
[1:29:46] preacher and this book from this guy and
[1:29:48] that guy and that guy and they lay it
[1:29:50] all out and they go to putting it all
[1:29:51] together what do they want they don't
[1:29:53] want a Church of the Living in God they
[1:29:55] want a church of their own making so
[1:29:57] their name can always be identified with
[1:30:00] it I started this I started this this is
[1:30:06] what I done this is what I started I
[1:30:09] don't want to own that thing

[1:38:34] and take all that out and before long
[1:38:36] they're sitting our feet and constantly
[1:38:38] on him and the next thing you know the
[1:38:40] message is not being preached at all not

[1:39:20] talking about socialism communism
[1:39:24] quoting principles of Communism in their
[1:39:27] political speeches and the American
[1:39:29] people screaming and hollering yes
[1:39:33] yes and you think are you all out of
[1:39:36] your
[1:39:37] mind I'll answer that question yes they
[1:39:45] are I wouldn't be a bit surprised if
[1:39:48] they don't make one of the horriblest
[1:39:49] mistakes they'll ever make in their
[1:39:50] entire life
[1:39:54] notice this spoken words Original Seed
[1:39:57] page

[1:40:13] word say it with
[1:40:17] me a just like he
[1:40:21] did h just like he did
[1:40:26] C he was the
[1:40:28] word friends don't you understand why
[1:40:30] people can back out away from this
[1:40:32] message the message is something
[1:40:34] supplemental to their intellect it's
[1:40:37] something supplemental that they hear it
[1:40:39] and they they like it for a while and
[1:40:40] they enjoy it for a season but the
[1:40:42] reason they can part with it is because
[1:40:44] it was never part of who they
[1:40:47] are but if this word is you you would
[1:40:51] give up your life before you would give
[1:40:53] up this word but if it's not it's just a
[1:40:56] supplemental thing and it's just
[1:40:58] something that you take someone had sent
[1:41:00] me a clip not long ago the Young Smart
[1:41:01] elic message preacher and he was talking
[1:41:03] about oh how great it was just to
[1:41:05] realize that the message is just like a
[1:41:06] book you know setting up on the shelf
[1:41:08] and you just take it down and use it and
[1:41:10] use whatever part you want and then you
[1:41:12] just put it back up I thought yeah
[1:41:13] that's exactly where we are that's the
[1:41:16] kind of seeds that's being s You' got
[1:41:18] young people sitting there that's what
[1:41:20] they hear you've got old people sitting

[1:42:08] way listen this and when
[1:42:13] so the Bible is manifested
[1:42:17] again like in the early
[1:42:20] days of the disciples

[1:43:10] goodness you are a predestinated
[1:43:16] seed just
[1:43:19] like Christ was
[1:43:23] yes and of course Christ was a
[1:43:25] predestinated seed I guess because God
[1:43:28] saw before the foundation of the world
[1:43:31] that he he wanted to be and then God
[1:43:34] predestinated him based on his forn
[1:43:37] knowledge of what he saw he wanted him
[1:43:39] to to
[1:43:42] be it's amazing how many message
[1:43:44] preachers preach

[1:49:28] when I was putting that dry fertilizer
[1:49:30] on it I just spread it out just a
[1:49:32] singing as I was going cuz I knew when

[1:49:36] of that ground it's going to come
[1:49:37] busting up there them Roots it's going
[1:49:39] to pull that phosphorus down there that
[1:49:41] ammonium and that nitrate it's going to

[1:49:47] I've got to grow I've got to go I'm
[1:49:49] getting out of here but it's the same
[1:49:52] with the Bride s the mechanics s the
[1:49:55] mechanics s the mechanics and we're
[1:49:57] waiting for the light of rain to fall
[1:49:59] when it does the bride
[1:50:04] Say Goodbye World goodbye
[1:50:23] Billy gr struck the
[1:50:25] world the Pentecostal struck the world
[1:50:29] the
[1:50:30] word has struck the world now what's the
[1:50:32] matter
[1:50:34] now she's waiting for the latter
[1:50:38] rain that's when she
[1:50:41] produces her
[1:50:45] fruits then the kind of seeds you have
[1:50:48] planted in your
[1:50:50] field will be the kind of crop
[1:50:54] that you
[1:50:55] reap
[1:50:56] yes so let me repeat it again to you now
[1:51:00] so in the small minuscule form that it
[1:51:02] was soed years and years ago questioning
[1:51:05] about brother brandom are you the only
[1:51:07] one to
[1:51:09] preach you see that Spirit was already
[1:51:12] around the
[1:51:14] Tabernacle it was already around the
[1:51:16] message
[1:51:18] people ain't that amazing you don't find
[1:51:21] that in Pentecostal churches
[1:51:23] or Baptist Churches or Presbyterian or
[1:51:26] Lutheran what's the main move that don't
[1:51:28] believe in Preachers
[1:51:32] Catholicism
[1:51:35] priests priest and one great holy man
[1:51:38] that's above everybody
[1:51:41] else you don't see Catholics going out
[1:51:44] casting out devils and evangelists and
[1:51:45] you know pastors and all that sort of
[1:51:47] thing but it's priests that intercede
[1:51:49] for you and pray for your prayer request
[1:51:52] pray for this that and the
[1:51:54] other uhhuh see where they're going back
[1:51:56] don't you oh mother
[1:52:02] so now many of the grandchildren
[1:52:06] of those who sewed those seeds ridicule
[1:52:09] laugh make fun of you
[1:52:13] all cuz you go to
[1:52:16] church and because you think you need a
[1:52:20] pastor and they ridicu you and people
[1:52:23] just like you around the world and their
[1:52:26] goal is for every preacher to sit
[1:52:29] down and start playing the same tape
[1:52:32] they play from
[1:52:33] Jeffersonville cuz that's the
[1:52:37] headquarters I agree with that it is the
[1:52:39] headquarters for that type of
[1:52:42] people but my headquarters ain't in
[1:52:45] Jeffersonville or been in
[1:52:48] Louisiana or up in Virginia in the Hill
[1:52:50] Country my headquarters ain't even in
[1:52:53] Johnson City my headquarters is up this
[1:52:57] way and the head of my quarter says go
[1:53:00] to
[1:53:06] church oh
[1:53:08] my look children seed of being
[1:53:12] sown you young people you're not
[1:53:15] ignorant you go to some of these youth
[1:53:17] meetings and you hear things being said
[1:53:20] you're seeing things happening it's
[1:53:21] causing
[1:53:23] questions I had to deal with some of
[1:53:25] them and are question
[1:53:26] answers cuz it's raising up questions
[1:53:29] what about this and I don't understand
[1:53:30] that and did Brother BM said that that's
[1:53:31] not the way Brother Don is saying well
[1:53:33] what's going on again seed
[1:53:37] time seed are being swn in the message
[1:53:40] sir seed are being sown in youth camps
[1:53:43] seed are being swn on the internet yes
[1:53:46] sir you know what I find amazing is how
[1:53:49] many of the message preachers absolutely
[1:53:51] blasted me for years years for straming
[1:53:53] our services and then whenever Co hit
[1:53:56] they they ever preaching the message on
[1:53:57] the
[1:53:59] internet I reckon they must have
[1:54:01] Sanctified it now so once they went on
[1:54:02] it they got it all cleaned
[1:54:05] up now I'm not against you listening to
[1:54:07] preachers on the internet as long as you
[1:54:09] got that filter of the Holy Ghost I
[1:54:10] ain't talking about me as your filter
[1:54:12] I'm talking about the Holy Ghost cuz
[1:54:14] every
[1:54:15] preacher has a narrative of some sort
[1:54:19] he's got an agenda he's got something
[1:54:20] he's trying to promote I do
[1:54:23] oh yeah I do I've got an agenda my
[1:54:25] agenda is a
[1:54:27] person but it ain't this
[1:54:29] person it's a risen savior my agenda is
[1:54:33] not to make our church a bunch of
[1:54:35] William
[1:54:36] brandom's Donnie Reagan darl WS no other
[1:54:39] man it's Sons and Daughters of
[1:54:42] God that become the Living
[1:54:46] Word you are the Bible living itself out
[1:54:52] is that what you want if it isn't then
[1:54:55] if I was you I'd go somewhere else
[1:54:57] because I am not going to change okay
[1:55:00] let me just let you know up front I am
[1:55:02] not going to change to where I want to
[1:55:05] have this this agenda that agenda no I'm
[1:55:08] not pushing gifts I'm pushing the
[1:55:13] giver praise the Lord I'm not pointing
[1:55:15] everybody in the message to this one man
[1:55:17] or that one man or that one man look
[1:55:18] friends I preach youth different youth
[1:55:20] conventions and camps around the world
[1:55:22] world now tell what it's
[1:55:23] heartbreaking I stood him one several
[1:55:25] years ago and Carol was there with me
[1:55:27] and there was some youth there from a
[1:55:29] certain move around this
[1:55:31] message you could tell every one of them
[1:55:35] they had a spirit about them they had an
[1:55:36] attitude about them the brother want me
[1:55:38] to have questions and answers I said
[1:55:40] brother I don't like doing that off the
[1:55:42] cuff he said oh brother Donnie you know
[1:55:44] please they want to do it they want to
[1:55:46] do
[1:55:47] it I said I'd rather study be able to
[1:55:49] have the answers I I know you but you
[1:55:51] don't have time you don't have time I
[1:55:52] felt so funny about
[1:55:55] it I said all right all right I'll do it
[1:55:58] well there were some of them they're
[1:56:01] just let me just be honest with you they
[1:56:02] were denominational message youth every
[1:56:05] one of them had this certain question
[1:56:07] about their Doctrine their certain
[1:56:10] terminology the Holy Ghost is moving
[1:56:12] people being healed people being
[1:56:13] delivered people being filled with the
[1:56:14] Holy Ghost and they was just sitting
[1:56:16] there cuz I never said their certain
[1:56:19] words and they were sitting there
[1:56:21] waiting for me to say seven
[1:56:25] Thunder and I didn't say it and they
[1:56:27] just could not understand how could God
[1:56:30] be moving when I never said their magic
[1:56:34] words cuz God don't move by magic
[1:56:38] words God moves by
[1:56:40] faith it was pitiful them young people
[1:56:44] that ask one question after another
[1:56:46] after another every one of them what
[1:56:48] about the Holy Ghost what about
[1:56:50] salvation Carol remembers it
[1:56:53] it was about their theology their
[1:56:57] Doctrine that's why I kept feeling that
[1:56:59] funny
[1:57:00] feeling but I've never been in them
[1:57:02] times types of situations when my back
[1:57:05] wasn't against the wall that I found out
[1:57:07] there somebody between me and the
[1:57:10] wall and he come and help me and off the
[1:57:13] top of my head and from down in my
[1:57:14] spirit and wherever all that stuff come
[1:57:16] from man alive I was still rejoicing
[1:57:19] Carol remembers that I mean the Lord
[1:57:21] took care of that real quick now that's
[1:57:24] been years ago you imagine now some of
[1:57:26] them guys are preachers married so
[1:57:30] wonder what now they've
[1:57:32] hybridized and some of the people in
[1:57:34] that move deacons stealing offerings
[1:57:38] hiring
[1:57:40] prostitutes molesting grandchildren
[1:57:43] horrible
[1:57:45] stuff but as long as they could shout
[1:57:48] and jump and
[1:57:50] run is that what we
[1:57:53] want is that what we want our church to
[1:57:56] turn into a bunch of
[1:57:59] perets Thieves
[1:58:03] Liars
[1:58:05] no we want genuine
[1:58:10] Christians how many wants
[1:58:13] that men women
[1:58:16] boys
[1:58:20] girls let's bury it together if you
[1:58:25] would oh
[1:58:30] Jesus sometimes I wish I could
[1:58:33] just get them together Lord
[1:58:35] and turn the internet off
[1:58:39] and just talk to him from my heart about
[1:58:41] some of the things I've
[1:58:43] seen and my years of travel around the
[1:58:46] world I think they'd understand a little
[1:58:48] better why I preached so hard against
[1:58:51] some of this know
[1:58:54] sense I wish some of the adults could
[1:58:56] have heard our brother and sister
[1:58:58] White's testimony the other night about
[1:59:00] what they had been
[1:59:02] through their experience of being
[1:59:06] identified around some of the same sort
[1:59:09] of people that I've preached about
[1:59:12] tonight oh the pain that it brings the
[1:59:16] scars Lord Jesus help
[1:59:19] us I pray forever God call me
[1:59:23] man Lord help us
[1:59:26] Jesus may we preach the
[1:59:31] word without fear without favor without
[1:59:36] compromise Lord I'm an old man
[1:59:39] now years ago when I first started
[1:59:41] preaching this message in my 30s I guess
[1:59:44] it
[1:59:45] was oh dear
[1:59:48] God I don't know how many more days of
[1:59:50] God how many more settings of the son
[1:59:52] I'll
[1:59:53] see but if time goes on there'll be
[1:59:56] someone that'll come and have to step
[1:59:58] here behind this pulpit and take the
[2:00:02] church Lord God what will it
[2:00:06] become I wonder what brother brandham
[2:00:08] would
[2:00:09] say if he could drive by brandham
[2:00:12] Tabernacle on Wednesday
[2:00:14] night drive by it on Sunday morning and
[2:00:17] Sunday
[2:00:18] night no church no church
[2:00:24] there's a preacher friend of mine I
[2:00:25] heard him say that he'd went there and
[2:00:27] just a tour it been years since he was
[2:00:29] there and he went in to see
[2:00:31] it smelled molded and
[2:00:35] musty I thought how
[2:00:38] sad some of the greatest sermons that
[2:00:41] was ever preached on the earth brought
[2:00:43] forth from that little
[2:00:45] Tabernacle and now shut
[2:00:49] down so what does the future hold for
[2:00:52] Word of
[2:00:54] Life maybe if I get a bit older and I
[2:00:57] can't preach no more and then devote
[2:00:58] some young guy in here that comes in
[2:01:04] they think he's on the
[2:01:05] word and they figure out he's got an
[2:01:09] agenda little by little he starts
[2:01:11] pulling them away from the message it
[2:01:12] quits referring to the prophet quits
[2:01:14] reading quotes and they notice for about
[2:01:17] two years that he don't even put a quote
[2:01:20] on his Facebook
[2:01:22] post but they think he's just trying to
[2:01:25] use
[2:01:26] wisdom and trying to bring people
[2:01:32] in Lord God I pray in the name of
[2:01:36] Jesus may you touch each heart it'll not
[2:01:39] just be us old people that'll keep the
[2:01:42] church
[2:01:44] strong the future of this church if
[2:01:47] there is a future ladies and the young
[2:01:50] people who come here there may be a
[2:01:52] young man standing here tonight that
[2:01:54] doesn't even know it but he might be the
[2:01:57] future pastor of this church of time
[2:02:00] teres what will he be an
[2:02:05] intellectual will he be sa he's
[2:02:07] preaching the fourth light when the
[2:02:08] whole time he actually emphasizing the
[2:02:12] third well he used the message as simply
[2:02:15] a a platform to launch his own
[2:02:20] version each one will bring
[2:02:22] forth each pastor each evangelist each
[2:02:27] teacher help me Lord God when I stand
[2:02:30] before you I know I've made many
[2:02:33] mistakes
[2:02:35] Lord but help me Jesus to stay
[2:02:38] true it's cost me many a
[2:02:42] friend no doubt I'll lose more before
[2:02:44] it's said and
[2:02:46] done Lord if I lose everyone this people
[2:02:49] here turns against me
[2:02:52] and they want nothing to do with me
[2:02:55] anymore then Lord as long as I've got
[2:02:58] you on my
[2:02:59] side you and I will be the majority but
[2:03:02] I believe there's people here who love
[2:03:04] you and love your
[2:03:06] word Lord God we're standing in great
[2:03:09] need tonight we've got Saints in our
[2:03:12] assembly that need Miracles
[2:03:15] Lord you don't vindicate lies you
[2:03:18] vindicate
[2:03:20] truth I want to preach a gospel that
[2:03:22] when my people get sick I can show them
[2:03:26] a Jesus that still heals amen and still
[2:03:30] delivers we love you father we worship
[2:03:34] you tonight Lord
[2:03:37] God thank you
[2:03:39] Father thank you
[2:03:42] Father Can we just raise our hands in
[2:03:44] the presence of the Lord may
[2:03:48] you look inside your own heart there for
[2:03:50] a few moments
[2:03:59] if you got anger
[2:04:02] resentment
[2:04:03] bitterness just something there in your
[2:04:05] heart that's not like the
[2:04:08] Lord remember when the
[2:04:10] rainfalls it'll produce whatever your
[2:04:13] garden is holding in seed
[2:04:16] form so let's
[2:04:18] love let's forgive
[2:04:21] let's be like
[2:04:23] Jesus that way when the latter rain
[2:04:26] falls what will it produce a mega do of
[2:04:31] Jesus
[2:04:32] Christ don't you see Word of Life Church
[2:04:35] what the Rapture is going to be the
[2:04:37] latter
[2:04:38] rain will be the power of God the
[2:04:41] rapturing
[2:04:42] faith that will produce in the bride
[2:04:46] such a Measure of Faith like she's never
[2:04:49] experienced before
[2:04:51] and it will change her body in a moment
[2:04:53] in the twinkling of an eye and it will
[2:04:56] come to such a power on the earth it
[2:05:01] will cause the
[2:05:04] resurrection and the Deads that's been
[2:05:06] dead for many
[2:05:08] hundreds and some of them for thousands
[2:05:10] of
[2:05:11] years will come
[2:05:14] out and will enter in with them to go
[2:05:17] meet our lord
[2:05:19] Jesus remember this is what the rapture
[2:05:21] faith
[2:05:22] is Mount Zion
[2:05:27] Showdown What a Sad thing it's going to
[2:05:29] be see for these hybridizing
[2:05:32] preachers and oh yeah they preach the
[2:05:34] message they say they do anyway they
[2:05:36] preach a
[2:05:37] Rapture but they're mixing a concoction
[2:05:40] of a conglomeration of all this mess and
[2:05:44] on the Rapture morning them and their
[2:05:46] people will be
[2:05:49] left cuz the preacher has has conceived
[2:05:52] hybrid seed within himself
[2:05:55] first then he has sown that seed in the
[2:05:58] hearts of his
[2:06:01] congregants so they take so much of the
[2:06:03] message so much of the Bible so much of
[2:06:05] this so much of that so much of
[2:06:06] something else and the mix it all
[2:06:08] together under the leadership of that
[2:06:10] preacher then when the latter rain falls
[2:06:14] it sends them straight to their Destiny
[2:06:17] the tribulation
[2:06:19] period and there'll be some men of God
[2:06:21] on the earth that have labored under the
[2:06:23] truth under their
[2:06:25] Ministries the bride of Christ will come
[2:06:28] to that place of rapturing faith and
[2:06:31] it'll sweep the world in a moment of
[2:06:34] time and our bodies will be changed the
[2:06:36] dead will be raised will get together
[2:06:39] with the rest of the group and come up
[2:06:42] missing on the
[2:06:44] earth and then the Mount Zion Showdown
[2:06:47] will be Jesus proving which one is bride
[2:06:53] yes now why would you have to prove that
[2:06:55] if you've only got one group of people
[2:06:57] claiming to be
[2:06:59] bride if the bride was the only one
[2:07:02] claiming to be bride her own claim would
[2:07:04] be enough but there's going to be all
[2:07:06] kinds of them claiming to be bride amen
[2:07:09] so it's up to Jesus to prove who is
[2:07:14] bride yes sir praise
[2:07:18] God oh how many wants to be so full of
[2:07:21] of the Holy
[2:07:23] Ghost would you just with me there
[2:07:25] tonight just raise your hands there Lord
[2:07:27] just tell him Lord if there's anything
[2:07:28] in my heart if there's anything in my

[2:07:32] got any bitterness any anger anything at
[2:07:35] all Lord God if I've got one Speck of my
