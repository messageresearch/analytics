[9:09] your name.
[9:13] If you love you, give a good hand clap
[9:15] of praise this morning. Thank you, Lord.
[9:20] Amen. Ain't it good to be in the house
[9:21] of the Lord this Sunday morning?
[9:23] Look at your neighbor and tell them
[9:25] you're glad to see him. Praise the Lord.
[9:27] What a privilege it is to be in the in
[9:30] the sanctuary of the Lord to we come to
[9:32] worship and to praise the name of the
[9:34] Lord and give him honor, respect him.
[9:37] This is a sacred place, right? And we
[9:40] want to treat it as such. If you're
[9:41] visiting with us today, we want to
[9:43] welcome you to our service. So glad to
[9:45] have each and every one of you. All of
[9:47] our streamers locally and around the
[9:48] world. We want to say God bless those
[9:50] folks as well. trust they'll receive
[9:52] from this service today. Let's give all
[9:55] those folks a good hand if you would
[9:56] this morning. [applause]
[10:00] Praise the Lord. We're going to look at
[10:02] our prayer request uh at this time.
[10:04] Sister Ruth Louise Jax is asking for
[10:06] prayer for the Nixon family that lives
[10:09] near her. She is also asking that the
[10:11] Lord gives her understanding and peace.
[10:13] So, let's remember that prayer request
[10:15] as we pray today. Sister Shirley Robbins
[10:18] is asking that we pray for brother Greg.
[10:20] He was in the hospital from Thursday
[10:22] through Saturday due to low sugar and a
[10:25] very low heart rate. He is at home now
[10:27] and waiting for more answers from the
[10:29] doctors. Well, let's just pray that the
[10:32] doctor Jesus will go by and pay him a
[10:34] visit. We know he's more than able,
[10:36] right?
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Sister April Weisner wants to uh
[10:43] remember her sister Brandy in prayer.
[10:46] She has an inflammation in her back. So,
[10:49] we want to pray for her today. As we
[10:51] pray all the unspoken prayer requests, I
[10:53] know there's many needs in our group,
[10:55] but we'll just commit all these things
[10:57] unto the Lord. Let me make a few
[10:58] announcements before we pray today.
[11:00] Brother John, if you get ready to lead
[11:02] us to the Lord, the library will be
[11:04] closed on Wednesday, November the 26th.
[11:07] So, remember that if you would like to
[11:09] fill a shoe box, you can still bring it
[11:12] back this evening or before 11:00 a.m.
[11:14] tomorrow morning. And there will be no
[11:16] service this coming Wednesday night. So
[11:20] remember that. Want to wish at this
[11:22] time. We'll take this opportunity to
[11:24] wish all of you a very very happy
[11:26] Thanksgiving as you uh travel and and
[11:30] and and host friends and family in your
[11:33] homes. We just pray that uh God will
[11:35] bless you with a real good time. Nothing
[11:38] like family. You know that.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; Well, some of you don't even appreciate
[11:42] your family.
[11:44] I said, "There's nothing like good
[11:45] family." Right?
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Look at
[11:49] your neighbor and ask him, "Are you
[11:50] awake?
[11:53] I'm awake." All right, everybody's
[11:55] awake. Let's Let's stand this morning if
[11:58] you would. We're going to pray. Commit
[11:59] all these things unto the Lord. Just so
[12:01] happy to have each and every one of you.
[12:02] We had a great time here Wednesday
[12:04] night, didn't we? How many of you
[12:05] appreciate the word of the Lord? Don't
[12:07] it get better all the time? Give the
[12:09] Lord one more good hand clap of praise
[12:11] this morning. [applause]
[12:15] We love this guy right here, though.
[12:17] He's just about half the man he used to
[12:19] be.
[12:21] Right.
[12:23] Amen. God bless you. We certainly do
[12:26] love you. We appreciate your prayers. Um
[12:29] I want to something just came to my
[12:31] heart, you know, was I was sitting there
[12:35] thinking about the troubles and trials
[12:37] that we go through and the things. And
[12:39] brother Bham got to talking about that
[12:41] lady who said that she never had
[12:43] anything negative to say
[12:46] and and she said the devil's a good
[12:47] adversary.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; But the thing about a good adversary is
[12:51] if you're smart
[12:53] that adversary will make you think about
[12:55] your tactics,
[12:57] right?
[12:58] &gt;&gt; So that's what our trials are for. Let's
[13:01] think about our tactics. Let's look at
[13:03] how we live. Amen. I'm sorry. That is
[13:07] &gt;&gt; that's what's on my heart. So let's go
[13:09] to the Lord in prayer.
[13:11] Heavenly Father,
[13:14] we certainly love you, Lord.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[13:18] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[13:22] they say that you don't know what you're
[13:24] missing till you don't have it anymore,
[13:26] Lord.
[13:29] Lord, it's been
[13:32] circumstances have kept me out of church
[13:34] for a while, Lord. And Lord, I miss it
[13:37] so bad.
[13:41] I'm so grateful
[13:44] I could be here today.
[13:48] And Lord, it's not that you don't meet
[13:49] me out there, Lord.
[13:51] It's not that we don't have fellowship
[13:53] out there, Lord.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, but Father, there's something about
[13:57] [laughter]
[13:59] being in your presence with saints of
[14:02] like precious faith. Lord, we're so
[14:04] thankful for our brothers and sisters.
[14:07] We're thankful, Lord, that we can come
[14:09] together. We're thankful, Lord Jesus,
[14:11] that you're so mindful of us.
[14:15] That Lord, no matter what we're going
[14:17] through,
[14:19] we know that on the other side, we're
[14:22] going to come out better Christians.
[14:24] Lord, we're so thankful, Father. And
[14:28] Lord Jesus, these prayer requests that I
[14:31] hold in my hand, Father, they represent
[14:33] a need. But Lord Jesus, inside of my
[14:36] heart, I represent the answer, Father.
[14:39] Each one of these people here,
[14:42] Lord, we're we're
[14:45] emissaries, Lord. We're we're people
[14:46] that represent you. And we come to you,
[14:49] Father, and we say by your stripes,
[14:52] they're healed. And and every need is
[14:55] met, Father, under that name, in the
[14:57] name of Jesus. We bring them before you,
[15:00] Lord. We love you. We thank you for it.
[15:03] We thank you, Lord, that
[15:06] we get to hear more about you. We thank
[15:09] you, Father, that we're going to grow
[15:10] closer to you. And I I pray, Father,
[15:12] that we would be able to put aside every
[15:14] weight, every measure, everything that's
[15:15] in our mind, Father, that would hinder
[15:17] us from getting closer to you.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; We love you. We thank you for it, Lord
[15:21] Jesus. Be with us now each and every
[15:23] part of the service. We ask it in your
[15:25] name. Amen.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, John. God bless you.
[15:29] users, if you want to come at this time,
[15:31] we'll receive the morning tithe and
[15:33] offering you give us unto the Lord.
[15:34] Let's sing an old song that we sung for
[15:36] years, but I I still like it because I
[15:38] believe it's the truth. We're rising up.
[15:41] We're not drying up. We're rising up.
[15:44] Amen. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[15:47] Give him one more good hand clap of
[15:49] praise this morning. [applause]

[25:02] [music]
[25:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[25:16] [music]
[25:16] &gt;&gt; If you would have known me way back then
[25:20] and how I used to [singing] live,
[25:24] it would [music] be easy to see it was
[25:27] all about me. I had [music and singing]
[25:29] nothing to give.
[25:32] But I remember [music] the day [singing]
[25:35] I found grace and a hole in my heart was
[25:40] filled.
[25:41] Now [music] I'm a brand [singing] new
[25:43] man because of nail pierced hands
[25:46] hanging on Calary's hill.
[25:49] [music and singing]
[25:51] I'm just a sign of the cross.
[25:56] [music] Not perfect, just reading.
[26:01] You see, I once was lost,
[26:05] but God's [music] blood was shed for me.
[26:10] Nothing [music] I done, it's all
[26:12] [singing] God's son hanging on Calvary
[26:16] Street. Jesus paid my cost.
[26:21] [music] I'm just a sign of [singing] the
[26:22] cross.
[26:26] [music]
[26:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[26:39] &gt;&gt; It's easy to see [music] I'm a simple
[26:43] man that fits the glove
[26:48] [music] of a [singing] wondering soul
[26:50] that just didn't know about [music]
[26:53] God's love.
[26:56] But now I've seen the light [singing]
[26:58] because he's opened my eyes from the
[27:01] darkness. [music] I've been set free.
[27:05] Now for the rest of my days, I just

[27:10] [singing] my Savior's feet.
[27:15] I'm just a sign of the cross.
[27:20] [music] Not perfect, just redeemed.
[27:24] You see, I once was lost,
[27:28] [music] but God's blood was shed for me.
[27:33] Nothing I done, [singing] it's all God's
[27:36] son hanging on [music] Calvary Street.
[27:40] Jesus paid my cost.
[27:44] I'm [music] just a sign of the cross.
[27:50] Nothing [music] I done, it's all God's

[33:06] [music] But morning,
[33:09] new mercies [singing]
[33:12] I see.
[33:15] All I have needed,
[33:21] your hand has
[33:24] provided. [singing]
[33:26] Great is thy faithfulness, [singing]
[33:31] [music]
[33:32] Lord, unto
[33:35] me. [music]
[33:38] Lord, [singing] all I have needed,
[33:44] your [singing] hand has
[33:47] provided.
[33:49] Great is thy [singing] faithfulness.
[33:56] Great is [singing] thy faithfulness.
[34:03] Great is thy faithfulness.
[34:10] [screaming]
[34:14] Lord
[34:16] on [singing]
[34:18] to
[34:22] me.
[34:24] [music]
[34:32] [applause and music]
[34:37] How many can say amen to that? Amen.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; I've not been so faithful to him at
[34:44] times.
[34:46] I probably could venture to say the same
[34:48] for everybody else here today.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Times that we've questioned and wondered
[34:55] and
[34:56] tried to understand and think, Lord,
[35:00] your way is so obscure.
[35:03] the will of God is so obscure sometimes
[35:07] to try to find it. But aren't you glad
[35:09] he keeps us even through that obscurity?
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's happy to be in the
[35:14] house of the Lord today?
[35:17] &gt;&gt; I look so forward to church.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; I know it's the same. I realize it's the
[35:23] same as it's always been as far as days
[35:25] and hours and the days and all that, but
[35:28] from Wednesday to Sunday seems like it's
[35:31] so far to be able to come back to the
[35:34] house of God. I know I'm weird, you
[35:36] know, I admit it. When God saved me, he
[35:39] saved me to go to church. I love going
[35:43] to church. Some folks love to go to a
[35:45] ball game. I'm not saying that they're
[35:46] wrong for doing that, unless they love
[35:48] it more than they love going to church.
[35:51] Some people love doing this, doing that
[35:52] and the other. But to me, my greatest
[35:55] time of refreshment is not, as brother
[35:58] John said earlier, not just being in the
[36:00] presence of God, but being in the
[36:02] presence of the saints of God.
[36:06] So you think when we all get to heaven,
[36:09] there'll be no work as we know it in
[36:11] this life. There'll be no recreation
[36:15] as we know it in this life.
[36:18] What in the world are we going to do for
[36:21] eternity?
[36:23] There'll be no basketball. I'm sorry.
[36:26] No football, no volleyball, you know,
[36:29] none of that sort of thing. No, no golf,
[36:31] your brothers, hang up your clubs.
[36:35] Hang up your guns, hang up your bows,
[36:36] your fishing rods,
[36:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[36:39] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do? What are we
[36:42] going to do to keep from being so bored?
[36:46] Because the age we're living in, people
[36:48] cannot stand it. Entertainment has
[36:51] become such an addiction
[36:53] &gt;&gt; in people's life.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; You watch it out on the restaurant,
[36:56] Carol, and I was out eating some lunch
[36:58] yesterday at this barbecue place down
[36:59] the road here and you sitting there were
[37:01] very few people in there, but you s look
[37:03] at them. Man was on his phone, woman's
[37:05] on her phone, or the man was looking out
[37:07] that window and she's looking out that
[37:09] window. You think people, many of them
[37:11] have lost the art of communication.
[37:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. to be able to talk. So,
[37:16] what do y'all do? Text your wife when
[37:18] you're sitting at the table? Text your
[37:20] husband? Text your children. Hey kids,
[37:22] straighten up.
[37:24] But you think of what really God wants
[37:27] us to be. He wants us to communicate
[37:31] with him and with each other. It's sad.
[37:35] A doctor told Caroline not long ago, he
[37:37] said, "I know for you all, he's not a
[37:38] religious man." He said, "I know for you
[37:40] all, but y'all talk." He said, "But
[37:42] you'd be surprised what I hear." in this
[37:44] office of people that no longer talk.
[37:47] They no longer communicate. They no
[37:50] longer have the ability.
[37:52] You imagine some of our school kids
[37:55] don't even know how to sign a check.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Some don't know how to write a letter.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; And if they're mailing a bill,
[38:09] they don't know where the stamp goes.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Don't laugh at me. I know what I'm
[38:13] talking about. I just heard this the
[38:14] other day.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; But yet, we're in the age of greater
[38:19] education.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; We can go to the moon and do good to get
[38:23] to the post office and back safely.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; My my long for the simple life,
[38:33] &gt;&gt; don't you?
[38:35] Who was that for?
[38:37] &gt;&gt; It was for you, Carol. Okay. Well, y'all
[38:39] blame Carol for that. She just said, she
[38:41] said pointed to her that it was for her.
[38:43] So, God bless you, sister.
[38:47] Amen.
[38:49] Let's turn together to second Peter
[38:50] chapter 1 verse verse two.
[38:56] I hope you don't mind me reading these
[38:57] same verses. I absolutely love them.
[38:59] They're just
[39:01] such awesome verses in God's word.
[39:05] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[39:08] through the knowledge of God and of
[39:10] Jesus our Lord
[39:12] according as his divine power hath given
[39:14] unto us
[39:16] all things that pertain unto life
[39:20] and godliness. So he's given us all
[39:23] things that pertain unto life. Now
[39:24] remember this is essentials. This is not
[39:27] wants. all things that pertain unto life
[39:30] and godliness through the knowledge of
[39:32] him that has called us
[39:36] unto glory and virtue,
[39:39] whereby given unto us exceeding great
[39:41] and precious promises, that by these you
[39:45] might be partakers
[39:47] of the divine nature, having escaped the
[39:50] corruption that is in the world through
[39:52] lust, and beside this, giving all
[39:54] diligence, add to your faith virtue, and
[39:57] to virtue virtue knowledge and to
[40:01] knowledge. Notice now add to your faith
[40:05] virtue and to virtue knowledge
[40:10] and to knowledge temperance. So you're
[40:13] building one top of the other top of the
[40:16] other. to temperance, patience, and to
[40:19] patience, godliness,
[40:22] and to godliness, brotherly kindness.
[40:26] And to brotherly kindness,
[40:28] charity.
[40:31] May God hasten the day that every
[40:34] believer around the world can look at
[40:37] that top and say, "I have arrived."
[40:43] &gt;&gt; We'll go home.
[40:47] and may like to be remembered today as
[40:48] we pray. You have a need or request on
[40:50] your heart. All right, let's just bow
[40:52] our heads together.
[40:54] Lord Jesus, what a great privilege it is
[40:57] for us, Father, once again to be
[40:58] gathered in your house. And we thank
[41:01] you, Lord God. It's not that this carpet
[41:04] is special, Lord.
[41:06] These walnut boards that I have my hands
[41:09] on that made this pulpit, this altar
[41:12] area.
[41:13] These particular seats could have wound
[41:15] up in a coliseum, an auditorium.
[41:19] The sheetrock could have wound up in a
[41:21] bar. The paint on the walls could have
[41:24] painted school rooms, offices.
[41:29] But yet, it's not the place where they
[41:31] came from that's made it special. It's
[41:34] your presence and the presence of your
[41:37] children. We consider this to be a
[41:40] sacred place.
[41:43] Father, we know that when we come here,
[41:45] we will meet with you and with each
[41:47] other. You saw the hands of your
[41:49] children that were uplifted. Father, you
[41:51] say I have this handkerchief in my hand
[41:54] today as a prayer cloth. Lord, Sister
[41:57] Ruth Garland's great great grandson. You
[42:00] see, Lord, this situation the little
[42:01] fella's in. his mama having to lay flat
[42:05] of her back in the hospital for nine
[42:07] weeks before he was born and just one
[42:09] complication after another. So we pray
[42:12] that you'd be merciful, dear God, in the
[42:15] name of Jesus. This is your enemy that
[42:19] has done this to this child. May the
[42:21] spirit of God move. Heavenly Father, we
[42:24] know that we have many folks among us
[42:27] that have needs, some of them very
[42:29] serious, and we're praying that you'd be
[42:31] mindful of each one of them. Today,
[42:33] we've come together that we might feast
[42:36] at your table, that we might hear more
[42:38] of your principles of what you expect of
[42:41] us as your children. Help us today,
[42:44] Father. Help me to get out of the way.
[42:46] Anoint me with your presence. I pray in
[42:49] the name of Jesus. And the saints said,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn around and shake hands with
[42:55] somebody before you're seated and tell
[42:57] them it's good to be in the house of the
[42:58] Lord.
[43:00] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you.
[43:03] You may be seated.
[43:08] So, we've been looking at it for a
[43:09] couple of um couple of Sundays
[43:14] about godliness
[43:16] to be like God
[43:19] in the sense of what God loves and what
[43:22] God hates.
[43:24] I know that we don't hear much in the
[43:27] age especially that we're living in that
[43:30] God hates much of anything
[43:33] &gt;&gt; because people when they get done with
[43:36] God and they whitewash him and do all
[43:40] that they figure they need to do to uh
[43:43] complement his character, they make him
[43:46] to where that he loves everything
[43:49] and [snorts] detest nothing.
[43:52] There's no more sin in his eyes, no more
[43:54] abomination in his eyes, no more things
[43:57] that bothers him or troubles him. And
[44:00] people can do whatever they want, live
[44:02] any way they want, and he's going to
[44:04] wind up taking us all to heaven after
[44:07] all anyway.
[44:09] But that's not my God.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; I trust that's not your God. That's not
[44:14] the God of the Bible. And truly we are
[44:17] grateful that we know that the Bible
[44:20] tells us that God is love. The Bible
[44:22] does not say that God is hate. But it
[44:28] does say God is love. And we're grateful
[44:30] that he is love. But we also know to be
[44:34] God, there are certain things that God
[44:37] hates. There's things that he dislikes.
[44:40] And then there are things that he
[44:43] actually hates. to be godly. Then you
[44:46] and I want to love what he loves. We
[44:50] want to like what he likes. And we want
[44:54] to hate what he hates. Now, in that,
[44:57] it's a little bit hard because he hates
[45:00] with a godly hatred. And if we're not
[45:03] careful, we will hate with human hatred
[45:08] disguised
[45:09] under what we want people to believe is
[45:12] godly hatred. But godly hatred can only
[45:16] come from a pure regenerated heart that
[45:21] is housing the presence of divinity
[45:24] deity. Now if we try to hate and do it
[45:29] under the guise of it being God, well I
[45:31] hate this. I'll tell you one thing. I'm
[45:33] against this and that. And we know we've
[45:35] had people that's been that way, of
[45:36] course. And they want to hide it behind
[45:38] God. But you always notice the
[45:40] attributes of it, what comes out of it.
[45:42] And it's not too hard to tell that it's
[45:45] not godly. And yet down through the
[45:47] ages, God has hated various things. Now
[45:51] notice and listen to me carefully that
[45:53] God hates the sin that the sinner does.
[45:57] But God does not hate the sinner. God
[46:00] loves the United States of America, but
[46:04] he hates the United States of America's
[46:07] sins.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; God loves every person in this church.
[46:12] this morning. But God hates every sin
[46:16] that every one of us have in our life if
[46:18] we do.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; You see, God's able to separate between
[46:22] the two, knowing then that as long as
[46:25] the blood is still shed, and we know
[46:26] according to the vision that God allowed
[46:28] his prophet to see years and years ago
[46:30] at that little restaurant in Ohio, and
[46:33] he was condemning the woman and the man
[46:35] and all the different ones that was
[46:37] there. And the Lord called him aside and
[46:40] let him see the earth. and the earth was
[46:42] covered over with blood. And he saw his
[46:45] sins, not the sin of the woman, the
[46:47] police officer, the other people that
[46:48] were there, but he saw his sins as they
[46:51] were coming up and hitting the Lord
[46:53] Jesus in the face. And he'd say,
[46:56] "Father, forgive him. He don't know what
[46:58] he's doing." And brother Brandham then
[47:00] realized that he himself also was
[47:04] underneath that canopy of the blood. And
[47:07] had not the blood been there, he himself
[47:09] would have been without mercy. So that's
[47:12] the way that God is able to look at us.
[47:14] And as long as there's life, we know
[47:16] there is hope. But God is ultimately
[47:19] going to bring all of those who continue
[47:22] on in their sin and their unbelief to
[47:25] judgment, which is one place I never
[47:27] want to stand myself because I I've read
[47:31] a little bit about it. Maybe not much as
[47:33] some of you all have, but from what I've
[47:35] read, I do not desire ever to stand
[47:38] before the white throne judgment of God.
[47:41] So, if there's things that God hates,
[47:44] and I desire to be godly, then I want to
[47:47] hate those things. Notice I keep saying
[47:50] that things, not people. Things that
[47:54] people do, things that people get
[47:57] involved in, things that people become a
[48:00] part of. Now you you parents that have
[48:02] had children and whenever your children
[48:05] are young, you can kind of make them do
[48:07] what you want them to do. And as they
[48:10] get older, you try that same thing and
[48:12] well, you know how it is. They're going
[48:14] to do what they want to do. And and yet
[48:16] you you hear and you know they're
[48:18] getting involved in this and that and
[48:20] the other. It breaks your heart. You
[48:22] think, "How could you do that to us?
[48:24] We've taught you better than that." And
[48:26] what are you wanting? You're wanting
[48:29] them to love what you love and hate what
[48:31] you hate. And yet, some of your children
[48:33] have wound up doing some of the things
[48:35] that you hate. So, do you hate your
[48:38] child because they're doing something
[48:40] wrong? Do you still love your child even
[48:42] when they do things wrong? Well, of
[48:44] course you do. If you have real love,
[48:45] well, that's the same way that God is.
[48:47] And yet you detest some of the things
[48:50] that you hear they're doing or some of
[48:52] the things maybe that the youth of our
[48:54] church, you know, this one's doing this
[48:56] and this one's doing that and it breaks
[48:58] your heart and you absolutely hate that.
[49:01] Yet if you would see them, you would not
[49:03] look at them and say, "I hate you. I
[49:05] hate you because you're falling short of
[49:07] the glory of God and I hate you." Well,
[49:09] we know that'll ever help them nor help
[49:12] you. There's only one thing that will do
[49:14] that and that is love. And it takes the
[49:16] spirit of God to be able to help us.
[49:19] Read with me if you would in Revelation
[49:21] 2:6. Uh we read this last week. But this
[49:24] thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of
[49:28] the nicicoatans which I also hate. Now
[49:32] God is here complimenting
[49:34] this first church age because of
[49:37] something that they have. Now watch what
[49:39] God says about it. This thou hast. So
[49:43] God is going to compliment something
[49:46] that they have and what they have is
[49:49] hate.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; How unusual. Now we think love, joy,
[49:54] peace, mercy, longsuffering, gentleness,
[49:56] kindness and God compliments that and he
[49:59] wants us to have it. But here, God is
[50:01] actually complimenting his people for
[50:05] something else that they have. And it's
[50:07] a hatred for what he identified as the
[50:11] deeds of the nickelans. Now, if you read
[50:14] that right, you'll note that God did did
[50:17] not say, "You all hate the nickelans
[50:21] because I hate them."
[50:24] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; God never said he hated them. God never
[50:28] complimented the Ephesian church for
[50:31] hating nickelans.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; God complimented them for hating their
[50:37] deeds.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice how that when
[50:41] God hates something in a church age, the
[50:45] elect must hate the same thing or
[50:49] they're not yet godly where they need to
[50:51] be.
[50:52] But this thou hast that thou hatest the
[50:56] deeds of the nicicoatans which I also
[51:01] hate. And word of life said
[51:05] &gt;&gt; now watch in the Ephesians church aids
[51:07] the prophet picks this up and he says
[51:09] but this thou hast that thou hatest the
[51:11] deeds of the nicicoatans which I also
[51:14] hate. The true vine hated the formal
[51:19] deeds of the nickelans. Now remember
[51:22] what this was doing. They wanted to do
[51:25] away with a spiritfilled church. They
[51:28] wanted to do away with a Holy Ghost
[51:31] move. They wanted to do away with some
[51:34] people that scream and holler and shout
[51:38] and worship God. Is that right? That's
[51:41] what they wanted to do away with. Now
[51:43] God said, "I hate that." Why? Because
[51:47] God wanted his children screaming,
[51:49] hollering and shouting, worshiping God,
[51:52] praising God. He wanted them alive. Is
[51:55] that right? Now, the Ephesian Christians
[51:57] looked at that and they said, "We are
[52:00] not for going to church and setting
[52:03] their dead, lifeless, dry, no worship,
[52:06] no praise, nobody clapping their hands."
[52:09] I wonder how many of our message people
[52:12] hate that to this day.
[52:14] Or is it becoming an accepted norm
[52:19] that actually instead of hating the
[52:21] deeds of a nickelanism, we hate anything
[52:24] with emotion. We hate anybody that cries
[52:28] and anybody that says amen real loud or
[52:31] a preacher that gets real fiery and
[52:33] preaches. Well, we ought to be hating
[52:35] the other thing, not the real genuine
[52:38] thing. The true vine hated the formal
[52:41] deeds of the nickelotans. So did God.
[52:47] But now we find in the third church age,
[52:50] which is the Perameian church age,
[52:52] Revelation 2:15, so hast thou,
[52:57] now notice he uses some of the same
[52:59] words in addressing the Ephesian church
[53:01] age. And he compliments for what they
[53:04] had, which was hate for the wrong thing.
[53:09] error doctrines leading his church to
[53:12] formality.
[53:13] But now God says, "You no longer hate
[53:16] what I hate." But you've actually got
[53:20] some of them people among you.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Before they had hatred for it, but now
[53:26] they've let down the bar.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; Now there's people among them
[53:32] &gt;&gt; that actually are holding the doctrine.
[53:36] Now watch what has happened. Satan has
[53:39] been able to inner work and come in and
[53:43] intertwine the real vine and try to get
[53:47] them to compromise
[53:49] &gt;&gt; now. Let's love them. Oh, let's love
[53:52] them. And you know, they don't see what
[53:53] we see, but but maybe we'll just we'll
[53:56] quit preaching on this and quit
[53:57] preaching on that and and and we won't
[54:00] let them, you know, we'll let them know
[54:01] that we love them. And we'll have the
[54:03] preachers to quit preaching on holiness.
[54:05] And and we'll have to quit preaching on
[54:07] on altar calls. And we'll just let them
[54:09] sit at their seat and accept Christ as
[54:12] their savior. And and we we'll quit
[54:14] crying and we'll we'll quit worshiping
[54:16] and still clamping our hands, we we'll
[54:18] just all stand there and smile and and
[54:21] instead of saying amen, we'll become the
[54:23] nodding church. So we'll just sit there
[54:26] and nod our head. And if we don't like
[54:28] what's said, we'll do this. And if we
[54:29] do, we'll nod. Aren't you glad? that
[54:32] Hadty Wright didn't nod.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you, Hadty Wright was glad
[54:36] she had the right thing to say back to
[54:38] God. Remember, God's prophet said,
[54:40] "God's waiting to hear what you've got
[54:43] to say."
[54:45] &gt;&gt; God don't want your thumbs up. God don't
[54:47] want your nod. God wants your voice.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; He wants to hear you say, "Amen."
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Now watch. Now, something had happened
[54:57] then. So, Satan has already started
[55:00] moving. Now, and he said, "So thou also
[55:03] them that hold the doctrine of the
[55:06] nicicoatans, which thing I hate. God is
[55:09] not complimentary at all." Even though
[55:12] there were electaban
[55:14] church age, they had started getting
[55:17] cold. They started getting different.
[55:19] And now they were no longer rebuking
[55:22] that and making them feel uncomfortable.
[55:24] But they could actually come to church
[55:26] now and hold these doctrines and sit
[55:30] there comfortably because the preachers
[55:32] in the pull pit had apparently come to a
[55:35] compromising state.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; So God hated both their deeds and their
[55:42] doctrine. Now watch this. And his
[55:45] wonders to perform the prophet said God
[55:47] hates sin but he loves the sinner. He
[55:51] loves you so much that he gave his only
[55:54] begotten son that he might drink the
[55:57] bitter cup for you. Remember, he became
[56:00] you that you might become him. I want
[56:04] you to listen to these words, friends.
[56:06] He become a sinner, separated from the
[56:09] father when he screamed, "My God, why
[56:13] hast thou forsaken me?"
[56:15] He was separated from God in his death
[56:19] that you in your death might have God's
[56:23] presence.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; He become a child of sin.
[56:30] He become a child of sin. Your sins, not
[56:35] his own, yours. That you might become a
[56:40] child of obedience. Oh, I love those
[56:44] words. A child of obedience, not a child
[56:48] of threats, not a child of fear, not a
[56:53] child of something that's held over you
[56:55] all the time, but a child that wants to
[56:58] obey God's word. Don't Ain't that what
[57:01] you want in your heart? That you want to
[57:03] be a child of obedience? Well, we we do
[57:06] this and we do that and we can't do this
[57:08] and we can't do that. But we don't do it
[57:11] on the basis of it being a law. We don't
[57:14] do it on the basis of it being legalism.
[57:16] We do it because we want to obey his
[57:19] word. Our obedience not only brings
[57:23] great pleasure to our heavenly father,
[57:26] but our obedience brings great pleasure
[57:29] to us. You see, that's the mystery that
[57:33] the worldly church will never comprehend
[57:37] because they look at the bride the way
[57:39] she's formed and shaped by God's
[57:41] immutable counsel. And they look and
[57:43] think them people must be miserable. We
[57:45] are not miserable. We are some of the
[57:48] happiest people you'll ever meet in your
[57:50] life. Why? They can't go here. They
[57:52] can't drink. They can't smoke. They
[57:55] can't take dope. They can't do this that
[57:57] and the other. Oh, no. We could do all
[57:59] of that, but we simply don't want to.
[58:01] First, we don't want the cancer that
[58:03] comes with it. We We don't want our
[58:04] minds all muddled up by all those things
[58:07] of the world. But first and foremost, we
[58:10] want to keep his word because we love to
[58:13] please our father because we are
[58:16] children of obedience.
[58:19] He took your place as a time creature.
[58:24] Listen, he took your place as a time
[58:28] creature that you might take his place
[58:31] as an eternal son and daughter of God.
[58:36] That ought to make somebody feel like
[58:38] worshiping the Lord. He took your place
[58:40] as a time creature. Amen. That you might
[58:45] take his place as an eternal son and
[58:49] daughter of God. That's how God loved
[58:53] the sinner but hated the sin. So he come
[58:57] on the basis that the sinner might be
[59:01] changed. Will they all? They will not.
[59:03] This is why the judgment will be so
[59:06] horrible for every sinner. Even though
[59:08] they're not bride, EVEN THOUGH MILLIONS
[59:12] ARE NOT BRIDE, God offers them the
[59:14] opportunity to be saved. And they even
[59:17] turn that down. You can see why the
[59:20] judgment will be so horrific for that
[59:23] type of people. God be on the lamb's
[59:26] book of life over into the book of life,
[59:29] spilled his mercy and his grace and
[59:31] said, "Whosoever will, let him come and
[59:33] take of the water of life freely." If
[59:36] God would have went by the lamb's book
[59:38] of life, he would have called his
[59:40] elected name only, and that would have
[59:42] been the only one saved. But God said,
[59:45] "I feel so sorry for all the rest of
[59:48] humanity. I'll make a way for them to be
[59:51] saved, too, if they want it. Because
[59:54] it's not his will that any should
[59:56] perish, but that all should come to
[59:58] repentance." Will they? Of course they
[1:00:01] won't. And then he'll judge them for not
[1:00:03] doing it. But for you and I, by the
[1:00:05] grace of God, aren't you glad we've
[1:00:07] accepted it? Now, let's look at
[1:00:09] something else that God hates. And I
[1:00:11] want you to think of this. that if our
[1:00:13] father hates these attributes and we
[1:00:17] love them and find ourselves partaking
[1:00:20] of them, we need to re re-evaluate the
[1:00:24] stature of godliness in our life. God
[1:00:28] hates discord.
[1:00:30] Watch this. Amongst a lot of people we
[1:00:33] find where emotions and so forth, there
[1:00:35] becomes tattlings and backbitings and
[1:00:39] all kinds of ungodly things. Brother,
[1:00:42] that's a sulfuric acid in the church.
[1:00:46] It's demon power.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen now. Men, women,
[1:00:51] boys, girls, deacons, trustees,
[1:00:52] preachers, all of us together. Now,
[1:00:55] amongst a lot of people, we find where
[1:00:57] emotions and so forth, there becomes
[1:00:59] tattlings, backbitings, and all kinds of
[1:01:02] ungodly things. You mean backbiting is
[1:01:05] ungodly?
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Tattling is ungodly. And the church
[1:01:10] said,
[1:01:11] titlings and backbitings and all kind of
[1:01:14] ungodly things. Brother, that sulfuric
[1:01:17] acid in the church, it's demon power. Oh
[1:01:21] my goodness. You mean demons get on
[1:01:23] people and go to causing them to
[1:01:25] tattlele and backbite and sew discord.
[1:01:28] Yes, that is not the spirit of God. It
[1:01:31] is demons.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Now, it's tough when it's on the leoty.
[1:01:35] But I'll tell you what's even worse.
[1:01:37] It's when it's on the preacher. And if
[1:01:39] it's on the pastor of the church, oh my
[1:01:42] goodness. And the pastor stirs up more
[1:01:44] trouble than anybody in the church, that
[1:01:47] is a bad deal. Because preachers can't
[1:01:49] hardly be corrected knowhow. They won't
[1:01:51] take nothing from nobody. Hardly any of
[1:01:53] them will anyway. So you imagine if the
[1:01:55] if this kind of a demon can get on a
[1:01:58] pastor, he keeps his church in total
[1:02:00] uproar. He keeps that church tore all
[1:02:03] two pieces and it ain't wrapped up in
[1:02:06] nothing but him and his flaws and his
[1:02:09] shortcomings. Oh my preach, brother
[1:02:11] Donnie. And what is it? Demon power. I
[1:02:15] don't care how much he's preached. I
[1:02:17] preached for 40 years. I don't care if
[1:02:18] you preached for 440 years. Men of God
[1:02:22] are not to be under the influence of
[1:02:25] demons.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Children of God are not to be under the
[1:02:28] influence of demons.
[1:02:31] Notice this. HE SAID, "GOD HATES DISCORD
[1:02:33] among the brethren. Be reverent. BE
[1:02:36] HOLY. LOVE GOD. Stand by him. And as
[1:02:40] long as you know your life is divying
[1:02:43] with the Bible, with purity of heart,
[1:02:46] purity of thought, love towards my, your
[1:02:50] brother, trying your best to upill the
[1:02:53] kingdom of God and doing those things,
[1:02:55] dressing right, living right, talking
[1:02:58] right." Look friends, as we go ON IN
[1:03:00] TIME, I realize why some of the folks
[1:03:02] have left the message and they want to
[1:03:04] say, "Well, Brother Brandon was a liar.
[1:03:05] He was an exaggerator. He's this, that,
[1:03:07] and the other." But the bottom line, I
[1:03:09] found out, is a lot of this stuff right
[1:03:11] here, they cannot live this word. They
[1:03:14] cannot live it. So, what did they do?
[1:03:16] They find them a church. It's exactly
[1:03:18] the appetite of what they want so they
[1:03:20] can live, you know, the way the church
[1:03:22] preaches and the way the preachers does.
[1:03:24] So, you got preachers in the pull pit
[1:03:25] with smoking problems, lust problems.
[1:03:27] They got problems in their marriage.
[1:03:29] They've been married two and three and
[1:03:30] four times. Preach, brother Donnie. And
[1:03:33] what do people look? They want a man
[1:03:35] like that. They don't want a man of God
[1:03:36] that lives above them. They want a man
[1:03:38] of God that lives where they are. Well,
[1:03:41] come on, somebody talk to me. They don't
[1:03:43] want a man of God that's full of the
[1:03:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And when he
[1:03:46] looks at him sometime, it looks like
[1:03:48] blazes of fire coming out of his eyes.
[1:03:51] They'd rather have a man that's get up
[1:03:52] and say, "Well, y'all pray for me. I'm
[1:03:54] lusting after women. Y'all pray for me.
[1:03:56] them having a problem, you know, getting
[1:03:58] away from drinking. As somebody told one
[1:04:00] of the brothers at our church not long
[1:04:02] ago, sitting in one of the local big
[1:04:04] churches here in Johnson City, they
[1:04:06] finally had to get rid of their pastor
[1:04:08] because he was showing up at all the
[1:04:09] weddings and all the receptions and all
[1:04:12] the different things. They was having
[1:04:14] drinking and he got drunk at one of them
[1:04:16] and they finally decided they going to
[1:04:18] have to let him go. Well, I don't mind
[1:04:20] telling you. I hope that I get drunk
[1:04:21] right here today. But it ain't going to
[1:04:23] be on old Crow or or Jim this that and
[1:04:26] the other on the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:29] Ghost. And I hope I ain't the only one.
[1:04:31] I hope there's some of our young people
[1:04:33] get so drunk on the Holy Ghost and some
[1:04:36] of you mamas and daddies and the prophet
[1:04:38] said you get so drunk that you don't
[1:04:40] know what your name is. Oh hallelujah.
[1:04:44] And we can LEAVE THIS PLACE SET ON FIRE
[1:04:46] OF THE BAPTISM OF THE Holy Ghost, hating
[1:04:49] discord, HATING SIN, HATING THE
[1:04:52] ABOMINATION OF the world, but loving
[1:04:54] Jesus, LOVING OUR BROTHER, LOVING
[1:04:57] WORSHIP, LOVING CHURCH, LOVING
[1:04:59] GODLINESS, loving heaven.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Notice this. HE SAYS, "UP BUILD THE
[1:05:09] KINGDOM OF GOD, doing those things,
[1:05:11] dressing right, living right, talking
[1:05:13] right, going to the right places, then
[1:05:16] you can have all the emotions you want
[1:05:18] to, and everybody will believe it." But
[1:05:21] you know what? If you've got a bunch of
[1:05:23] emotions and they know you live a
[1:05:25] different life, who wants to see anybody
[1:05:27] like that shout? I don't. Come on,
[1:05:29] somebody. I don't want to see somebody
[1:05:31] that's all full of emotion and they
[1:05:33] ain't got enough of the spirit of God to
[1:05:35] live right and overcome the devil. Oh
[1:05:37] my. Every day they're addicted to porn
[1:05:39] on their phone and they want to scream
[1:05:41] and run and shout. I ain't got no
[1:05:43] confidence IN THAT. I WISH SOMEBODY
[1:05:45] would preach WITH ME THIS MORNING. OH
[1:05:47] MY. GIVE US PEOPLE YOUR WORD OF LIFE
[1:05:49] THAT LIVE RIGHT, talk right, walk right,
[1:05:52] ABSOLUTELY WHOLE BEFORE GOD. THEN
[1:05:54] BROTHER, YOU WANT TO SHOUT, COME ON,
[1:05:56] I'LL SHOUT WITH YOU. YOU SISTERS WANT TO
[1:05:58] JUMP HIGH, COME ON, I'LL JUMP WITH YOU.
[1:06:00] THEN WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO JUMP ABOUT
[1:06:03] BECAUSE GOD'S LIVING INSIDE OF US A
[1:06:06] VICTORIOUS LIFE. WE ARE LIVING NOT IN
[1:06:08] PARADISE BUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of
[1:06:10] hell. EVERYWHERE WE LOOK, WE'VE GOT SIN,
[1:06:13] UNBELIEF, UNGODLINESS. BUT IN SPITE OF
[1:06:16] ALL OF THAT, I'M LIKE AN ASTRONAUT. WHEN
[1:06:19] THE ASTRONAUT GOES UP IN SPACE, THERE
[1:06:21] AIN'T NO OXYGEN UP THERE. THERE AIN'T NO
[1:06:24] FOOD UP THERE. THERE AIN'T NO WATER UP
[1:06:26] THERE. BUT WHAT DOES HE DO? HE PACKS HIS
[1:06:28] OWN WITH HIM. SO, HE'S GOT A SPECIAL
[1:06:31] SUIT ON. I'VE GONE ON A SPECIAL SUIT
[1:06:33] THIS MORNING. IT'S A HELMET. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:36] I'VE gone on a SHIELD AND A BREASTPLATE
[1:06:38] OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. MY FEET ARE SHAW WITH
[1:06:41] THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE.
[1:06:44] I GOT JOY. I GOT PEACE. I GOT HAPPINESS.
[1:06:47] I GOT SATISFACTION. AMEN. I AIN'T
[1:06:50] LOOKING FOR ANOTHER MESSAGE. I AIN'T
[1:06:52] LOOKING FOR ANOTHER MESSIAH. I'M LOOKING
[1:06:55] TO GET OUT OF THIS WORLD. I SAID, "I'M
[1:06:57] LOOKING TO GET OUT OF THIS WORLD. AND I
[1:07:00] WANT TO TAKE AS MANY AS YOU THAT WANTS
[1:07:02] TO GO WITH ME. I DON'T WANT TO GO FOR
[1:07:05] MYSELF. I DON'T WANT IT TO BE JUST ME
[1:07:07] AND MY FOR NO MORE. I WANT TO REACH
[1:07:10] EVERY SINNER I CAN. EVERY DEAD COLD
[1:07:13] CHURCH MEMBER, EVERY MEMBER THAT NEEDS
[1:07:15] TO BE ON FIRE OF THE HOLY GHOST. I WANT
[1:07:18] TO REACH YOU AND SAY, "COME ON,
[1:07:20] CHILDREN. LET'S GO.
[1:07:24] Listen [applause]
[1:07:29] the way God feels about our nation
[1:07:31] today.
[1:07:33] God hates sin and loves the sinner. He
[1:07:36] hates the sin.
[1:07:39] He loves America,
[1:07:42] but he hates her sin. That's right.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; He loves his church,
[1:07:49] but he hates the sin
[1:07:53] in the church.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; God loves his church,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; but he hates the sin in the church. And
[1:08:06] it hasn't changed. Spirits don't die.
[1:08:08] Same spirits that was in them people was
[1:08:10] talking about the ages before. And those
[1:08:12] people today, the devil takes his man
[1:08:14] but never his spirit. God takes his man
[1:08:16] but never his spirit.
[1:08:19] NOTICE HE SAYS ONE THING GOD hates is
[1:08:23] sowing discord
[1:08:25] among brethren. I ain't just talking
[1:08:27] about a church now. I'm talking about in
[1:08:29] your family.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; And them organizations is what does it
[1:08:33] sows discord among brethren. We should
[1:08:37] be standing in the breach and saying we
[1:08:39] are brothers.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We are not divided.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Now in this day, of course, there were
[1:08:45] no message churches hardly.
[1:08:48] So, Brother Brand was preaching the
[1:08:49] divisions that the denominations have
[1:08:51] made. Let's apply it the same way inside
[1:08:53] the ranks of the message.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Here's this certain doctrine over here
[1:08:57] and this certain bunch of people. They
[1:08:58] got their own man-made title. And if you
[1:09:00] ain't with them, you ain't the bride.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, children.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; So, we got this and they're leaning this
[1:09:07] way. This group's leaning that way. That
[1:09:09] group's leaning that way. And the
[1:09:10] farther we go, we just keep narrowing it
[1:09:12] down, narrowing it down, narrowing it
[1:09:14] down. Well, is there anybody right
[1:09:15] besides us there? Our attitude ain't
[1:09:17] right about that.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, somebody. Let's say amen.
[1:09:21] I agree. It makes it difficult to know
[1:09:23] where to stand on certain things and not
[1:09:26] feel like a compromiser. But I want you
[1:09:27] to listen. The way God's prophet dealt
[1:09:30] with this in the days of denominations,
[1:09:33] them organizations is what does this
[1:09:35] shows discord among the brethren. We
[1:09:37] should be standing in the breach saying,
[1:09:38] "We are brothers. We are not divided.
[1:09:41] All one body, one in hope and doctrine.
[1:09:44] The doctrine of the Bible, one in
[1:09:45] charity. I like that song. Onward,
[1:09:48] Christian soldiers. Yes, sir. Now, I
[1:09:51] want you to notice there's some unusual
[1:09:53] things that maybe to our thinking that
[1:09:55] he would mention that God hates.
[1:09:56] Anything that I despise, he says, is a
[1:09:59] hypocrite. And God hates the same thing.
[1:10:02] Wow. So, God hates a hypocrite. It would
[1:10:06] be better. Listen to this. What an
[1:10:08] outstanding statement. It'd be better
[1:10:10] for an infidel.
[1:10:15] A better chance of getting to heaven
[1:10:19] than a hypocrite.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Now you know that's the truth. AN
[1:10:26] INFIDEL SINCERE heart
[1:10:31] and couldn't see it.
[1:10:34] SO IF AN INFIDEL WAS JUST TOTALLY BLIND,
[1:10:37] COULDN'T see it, but a hypocrite sees it
[1:10:40] and said, "Well, I don't want to do it.
[1:10:42] I'm putting it off next year, next
[1:10:44] month, six months from now."
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; My
[1:10:48] notice again, HE SAID, "WE'LL never
[1:10:50] conquer as long as we're selfish."
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; God hates sin.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Wow. Why in the world would he use the
[1:10:57] word sin after the word selfish?
[1:11:01] Because selfishness to the degree that
[1:11:03] God looks at it in this type is sin.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; And he will not let it triumph OVER
[1:11:09] WRONG. THEY'RE SELLING THEIR BIRTH
[1:11:11] RIGHTS for a mess of pottage, A MESS OF
[1:11:14] DENOMINATION, A MESS of organization
[1:11:17] that God hates. JUST REMEMBER, YOU SAY
[1:11:20] ORGANIZATION, God hates it. It's a thing
[1:11:24] that separated brothers and broke down.
[1:11:27] Now remember, not the people. MANY OF
[1:11:31] YOU KNOW AND WORK WITH GOOD PEOPLE THAT
[1:11:34] GO TO denominational churches right in
[1:11:36] our area right here. As a matter of
[1:11:38] fact, some of them might be kinder to
[1:11:39] you to message people.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; I don't mind. I'm telling you, I've been
[1:11:43] treated way worse by message people than
[1:11:45] I ever was in Pentecost.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I've been lied to way worse
[1:11:50] with message preachers. I've been
[1:11:52] treated way worse by message people and
[1:11:55] and and message preachers than I ever
[1:11:57] was the years that I was in Pentecost.
[1:11:59] And to me, that again proves this
[1:12:02] message is the truth. So where do you
[1:12:05] find the most sticks when you're in an
[1:12:07] apple orchard under the best tree? SO
[1:12:10] YOU'VE GOT ALL THIS DAMAGE AND ALL THIS
[1:12:12] AND THAT AND THE OTHER. And people try
[1:12:14] to use that to say, "Well, to me it
[1:12:15] proves it's wrong." Well, I look at it
[1:12:17] totally different. To me, it proves it's
[1:12:19] even more right than I thought it was
[1:12:21] because Satan's trying to use all them
[1:12:23] to scare me away from the tree. It ain't
[1:12:25] scaring me away from this tree. Amen.
[1:12:29] AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING
[1:12:31] ABOUT. And it's hard to rise above the
[1:12:33] hurts. The church people will hurt you.
[1:12:35] ministers will hurt you and say, "Well,
[1:12:37] my goodness, if anybody ought to love
[1:12:39] me." And remember, preachers, I don't
[1:12:41] care how godly, how holy, how high they
[1:12:44] fly. They are still human beings. And
[1:12:46] every one of them are flawed and every
[1:12:48] one of them are a work in progress just
[1:12:51] like you. So don't have mercy just on
[1:12:54] the leoty. Have mercy on the preachers.
[1:12:56] God knows they need it.
[1:13:02] [applause]
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Oh my.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Notice they'll pay the priests and he'll
[1:13:08] pay them out of hell. Now he's talking
[1:13:10] about purgatory or Catholicism and it's
[1:13:12] nicotin and GOD SAID I HATE THAT.
[1:13:17] Let me see and say God said he hated it.
[1:13:21] LET'S SEE. THOU SITH THAT hatest the
[1:13:23] DEEDS OF THE NICKEL. GOD hates
[1:13:27] an organization.
[1:13:30] God hates
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; an organization
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; whether it's Baptist, Methodist, Church
[1:13:37] of God, Church of Christ.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Fuia,
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Seven Thunder, Tape Only.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Don't you understand what it's doing?
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; It's organizing people under a certain
[1:13:52] thing
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; all around the message is being
[1:13:55] organized. And if you don't come to our
[1:13:56] group, then you're not part of us. Then
[1:13:58] you're not going. They're doing exactly
[1:13:59] the same thing
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; of what the prophet stood against and
[1:14:03] said God hated. Well, how can we love it
[1:14:05] then?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; How is how can we as message people love
[1:14:09] it to where we just keep going out going
[1:14:11] out separating separating separate
[1:14:13] nobody but I'm not sure if there's
[1:14:14] anybody preaching the truth or brother
[1:14:16] Donnie if you got that on you today you
[1:14:18] need to repent and ask God to forgive
[1:14:19] you.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; God's got men of God all over the world.
[1:14:22] Would we all sit down and agree
[1:14:24] together? We would not. I am not God's
[1:14:27] standard. Word of life is not God's
[1:14:30] standard. God's word is God's standard.
[1:14:33] And there ARE BROTHERS THAT WE DISAGREE
[1:14:35] WITH, CHURCHES THAT WE DISAGREE. BUT MY
[1:14:37] GOODNESS, FRIENDS, THERE'S SO FEW OF US
[1:14:40] LEFT. WE NEED one another. We don't NEED
[1:14:43] TO GO AROUND DIVIDE AND SEPARATE. WELL,
[1:14:45] we won't preach for them and they won't
[1:14:47] preach FOR US. IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL,
[1:14:48] WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE NOBODY LEFT.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to know I'm not now and never
[1:14:58] have been against the people. It's the
[1:15:00] denomination, the system of organization
[1:15:03] that I'm against. I HAVE TO BE AGAINST
[1:15:05] IT. HE SAID, for God
[1:15:08] hates it.
[1:15:13] Now the question is,
[1:15:15] do you
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; do you hate the system of organization?
[1:15:27] Yes.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; If you do with a godly hatred, then
[1:15:32] you'll look at those people that are in
[1:15:34] there with pity
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; and you won't carry the same hatred from
[1:15:39] the organizational system over to them
[1:15:42] blind individuals.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; But you'll pray for them instead of
[1:15:47] condemning them.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; You'll pray for them instead of pointing
[1:15:50] your finger at them. Look at them bunch
[1:15:52] of Jezebels. Oh yeah, I understand. I
[1:15:54] understand all the Jezebel quotes. I
[1:15:56] know all that. But how much do we pray
[1:15:57] for them Jezebels? How much do we PRAY
[1:16:00] FOR THEM THAT GOD WILL HELP THEM? And if
[1:16:02] there's ANYTHING IN THEM, BRING THEM
[1:16:04] OUT, LORD. BECAUSE IF YOU SISTERS WILL
[1:16:06] REMEMBER BACK, SOME OF YOU USED TO BE
[1:16:08] JEZEBELS, TOO. SOME OF YOU BROTHERS USED
[1:16:11] TO BE CIGARETTE SUCKERS and drinkers and
[1:16:13] mongers AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND
[1:16:15] WHAT WAS IT THAT CHANGED YOUR LIFE?
[1:16:17] SOMEBODY PRAYED FOR YOU.
[1:16:19] SOMEBODY DIDN'T THROW YOU OUT THERE AND
[1:16:22] LEAVE YOU IN THAT MESS OF THE WORLD OR
[1:16:24] DENOMINATION, BUT SOMEBODY FELT TO GIVE
[1:16:27] YOU A BOOK OR A TAPE. AND THEY PRAYED
[1:16:29] THAT GOD WOULD OPEN YOUR EYES.
[1:16:34] LET'S HATE THE SYSTEM. YES. BUT LOVE
[1:16:37] them people
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; that are in it.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:49] Uh,
[1:16:51] this one right here, it's a little bit
[1:16:53] different now. All things in shreport.
[1:16:56] God hates [snorts]
[1:16:58] a powerless
[1:17:01] religion.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; A powerless religion. Now, we're not
[1:17:08] just dealing now with emotion.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say God hates an emotionless
[1:17:13] religion. I I couldn't find that quote.
[1:17:15] I looked at every one of them. God hates
[1:17:17] all several hundred of them and God
[1:17:20] loves and God loved and God loving.
[1:17:25] I wanted TO FIND OUT MYSELF WHAT DOES
[1:17:27] GOD LOVE?
[1:17:30] What does God hate?
[1:17:32] I want to be like him.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; So God hates a powerless religion. And
[1:17:43] any religion today that hasn't got
[1:17:45] Christ in it is powerless. But any
[1:17:48] religion that Christ is in under his own
[1:17:51] blood, it's got power in it. You say,
[1:17:55] "God hates a religion without power." He
[1:17:57] said, "Your solemn feast is a stink." I
[1:18:00] guess he does hate it. He said it makes
[1:18:01] HIM SICK. GOD HATES POWERLESS RELIGION.
[1:18:05] IT'S GOT TO HAVE POWER IN IT. IT'S GOT
[1:18:09] TO HAVE SINCERITY.
[1:18:11] Sincerity brings power.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. SO IT'S NOT JUST FA
[1:18:17] FASTING. IT'S NOT JUST PRAYING, reading
[1:18:20] our Bible, listening to the message,
[1:18:22] playing the tapes. No, not in this quote
[1:18:25] anyway. He didn't say that. None of that
[1:18:27] that I just listened to you above is
[1:18:29] what actually brings power, but
[1:18:32] sincerity.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; How many knows in reality we need to be
[1:18:36] more sincere?
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; More sincere. Now sincerity then will
[1:18:40] bring power. Remember the scripture
[1:18:42] tells us in Acts 1:8 AND YOU SHALL
[1:18:45] RECEIVE power after that the Holy Ghost
[1:18:48] has come upon you. Now when I'm talking
[1:18:50] about power, I'm not meaning power just
[1:18:52] to run the pews and power to, you know,
[1:18:54] cast out devils. I'm talking about power
[1:18:57] to live right. Power to bring our flesh
[1:19:00] under subjection and control of the Holy
[1:19:04] Ghost. I'm talking about power that when
[1:19:07] people will run you down and say bad
[1:19:09] things against you and SPREAD LIES ON
[1:19:12] YOU, THAT POWER INSIDE OF you will calm
[1:19:15] your flesh and it will empower you where
[1:19:19] you won't get back on Facebook and do
[1:19:21] the same thing to them that they did to
[1:19:24] you because you have power. WE NEED MORE
[1:19:28] POWER IN THE MESSAGE. WE DON'T JUST NEED
[1:19:31] POWER TO CAST OUT DEVILS AND POWER TO
[1:19:34] LAY HANDS ON THE SICK, BUT WE NEED POWER
[1:19:37] TO LEARN HOW TO SHUT OUR MOUTHS AT THE
[1:19:39] RIGHT TIME. WE NEED POWER TO LEARN HOW
[1:19:42] TO CONTROL OUR TONGUE AND CONTROL OUR
[1:19:45] TEMPER AND COME TO CHURCH OVER a little
[1:19:48] headache and COME TO CHURCH EVEN WHEN
[1:19:50] PEOPLE ARE TALKING about you. What if
[1:19:52] staying HOME FROM CHURCH WILL EXEMPT YOU
[1:19:55] FROM coming to church? I'LL NEVER SEE
[1:19:57] YOU ALL AGAIN CUZ I'M TALKED ABOUT MORE
[1:20:00] THAN ALL OF YOU. I'VE GOT MORE LIES
[1:20:02] SPREAD ON ME THAN ALL OF YOU PUT
[1:20:04] TOGETHER. BUT I AIN'T STAYING HOME. I'M
[1:20:07] COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND I'M GOING
[1:20:09] TO PREACH AND I'M GOING TO PRAY AND I'M
[1:20:11] GOING TO SING AND I'M GOING TO WORSHIP.
[1:20:14] DOES IT HURT ME? OF COURSE IT HURTS ME.
[1:20:16] BUT IT LETS ME KNOW HOW MUCH THE DEVIL
[1:20:19] HATES ME. AND [screaming] YOU REALIZE
[1:20:20] HOW MUCH HE HATES YOU. HE WANTS YOU TO
[1:20:23] STAY HOME. HE WOULD RATHER YOU STREAM
[1:20:26] THAN BE HERE SAYING AMEN. BUT WHAT ABOUT
[1:20:28] [screaming] IT? WORD OF LIFE. ARE WE
[1:20:30] GOING TO TURN INTO HOME STREAMERS OR ARE
[1:20:33] WE GOING TO TURN INTO CHURCH SCREAMERS?
[1:20:36] WE'RE COMING TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND
[1:20:39] WE'RE SAYING AMEN [screaming] AND PRAISE
[1:20:41] THE LORD AND PREACH IT. BROTHER DONNIE,
[1:20:44] WHY? WE ARE NOT LETTING THE DEVIL STOP
[1:20:47] US. GOD HATES IT.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; NOTICE what sincerity does.
[1:21:01] It's got to have sincerity. And
[1:21:03] sincerity brings power.
[1:21:07] Sincerity
[1:21:09] brings real
[1:21:12] worship.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:21:19] Sincerity brings real worship, not
[1:21:22] forms.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Now, having been a Pentecostal
[1:21:28] previously,
[1:21:30] some people think forms is just this.
[1:21:35] You're not pouring a concrete driveway.
[1:21:38] Okay? So, if you're pouring concrete,
[1:21:40] you want something that's not going to
[1:21:41] bend. You don't use jell-o as a form to
[1:21:44] mold the concrete. You want something
[1:21:45] that's rigid.
[1:21:47] But do you understand this can also be a
[1:21:50] form?
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is go to YouTube
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; and t type in Pentecostals dancing.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; We're trying to identify it as the bride
[1:22:05] or this is the bride's dance.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Well, if that's so then a lot of the Bob
[1:22:09] Jezebels I've been looking at on on
[1:22:11] YouTube from Pentecostals, that means
[1:22:12] they're bride, too. cuz they dance a
[1:22:15] whole lot more and a whole lot faster.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; And their startup time's a lot far
[1:22:19] faster than ours is.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I believe in dancing. Yeah. But I
[1:22:27] want to live right when I get done
[1:22:28] dancing, too. Don't you?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Sincerity brings real worship, not
[1:22:34] forms.
[1:22:36] You know, in the days when Harry and I
[1:22:38] was back in Pentecost and we played our
[1:22:39] instruments and we God forgive us, but
[1:22:42] we probably made the people go whoring,
[1:22:44] didn't we, Harry?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; YOU STOPPED THE MUSIC.
[1:22:51] I went to praising.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; I went through hallelujah. I WENT
[1:22:55] THROUGH GLORY TO GOD'S.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; SO, YOU COME TO FIND OUT THEY'RE NOT
[1:22:59] ALREADY PRAISING GOD BECAUSE THEY got
[1:23:01] joy. They like that key of G, not J.
[1:23:05] J O Y. Give me G, brother. GIVE ME G.
[1:23:08] WOO. GLORY TO GOD. THOSE OF YOU THAT are
[1:23:10] familiar with snake handlers, you know
[1:23:12] yourself. THEY DON'T WALK STRAIGHT IN
[1:23:14] THERE OFF THE STREET AND PICK UP a
[1:23:16] rattlesnake or a copperhead or a black
[1:23:18] mamba. What do they do? They get that
[1:23:21] music going. They go to dancing and
[1:23:23] jerking around. I SAW THE SAME THING IN
[1:23:25] DURBAN, South Africa when I was there
[1:23:27] years and years ago when they're going
[1:23:29] to put fish hooks in the backs of THESE
[1:23:31] MEN ABOUT THAT LONG and they're going to
[1:23:33] take A PIN ABOUT THAT long and hold
[1:23:35] their tongue out and weave that pin
[1:23:37] inside their tongue and they're going to
[1:23:39] pull little carriages on their back with
[1:23:42] them big grab hooks. And they would not
[1:23:44] do it immediately until they had a group
[1:23:46] of men standing around them, little
[1:23:48] symbols about that big. And they'd stand
[1:23:50] there and play them. And these others go
[1:23:51] to chanting AND DANCING AND SHOUTING
[1:23:54] AROUND. And then whenever the man in the
[1:23:56] middle, he knew he was right. HE WOULD
[1:23:58] LET OUT A SCREAM. AND THE PREACHER,
[1:24:00] BROTHER TOMMY SAID, "NOW WATCH THEM. AS
[1:24:01] SOON AS THEY SCREAM OUT, it's ready
[1:24:03] because the demon has now desensitized
[1:24:06] the feeling in their body." AND I STOOD
[1:24:08] RIGHT THERE AND VIDEOED IT AND WATCHED
[1:24:10] THEM TAKE A LONG PIN, LOOK LIKE AN
[1:24:12] OLDFASHIONED hat pin, and weave that
[1:24:14] thing inside of their tongue, not one
[1:24:16] drop of blood. TAKE THEM GRAB HOOKS AND
[1:24:19] STICK IN THEIR BACKS AND PULL OUT BIG
[1:24:21] PIECES AND HANG ORANGES AND GRAPEFRUIT
[1:24:23] AND DIFFERENT THINGS ON THEM HOOKS.
[1:24:26] NEVER SAY OUCH. NEVER SAY OH NO NOTHING.
[1:24:29] WAITING TO GET UNDER IT. OH MY. BUT I
[1:24:32] WANT TO KIND OF DANCE IN MY FEET THAT
[1:24:35] WHEN ALL HELL IS RAGING AGAINST ME AND
[1:24:37] HARRY'S 500 MILES AWAY THAT I CAN STILL
[1:24:40] SAY PRAISE GOD. MY GOD IS A VICTORIOUS
[1:24:44] GOD. I WANT ENOUGH JOY IN MY HANDS THAT
[1:24:47] I CAN CLAP AND SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD
[1:24:50] JESUS. I'VE GOT THE VICTORY TODAY OVER
[1:24:52] HELL. I'VE GOT THE VICTORY OVER SADNESS
[1:24:55] AND DEPRESSION." AMEN. COME ON,
[1:24:57] SOMEBODY. LET'S HAVE CHURCH TODAY. WE
[1:25:00] WANT THAT KIND OF WORSHIP BEFORE OUR
[1:25:02] GOD. AND SINCERITY
[1:25:05] is what brings it,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; not music.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; SINCERITY BRINGS POWER. SINCERITY brings
[1:25:18] real worship.
[1:25:20] Not thorns, but genuine power. Worship
[1:25:24] to know
[1:25:26] that you've passed from death unto life.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Did you know that worship involves that
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; worship? To know that you passed from
[1:25:39] death unto life.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Again,
[1:25:44] God hates a pyrus religion. It's got to
[1:25:47] HAVE THAT IN IT. GENUINE POWER WORSHIP
[1:25:50] TO KNOW that you pass from death unto
[1:25:53] life.
[1:25:54] Let's jump down here now to First John
[1:25:56] chapter 2.
[1:25:58] When Jesus was here,
[1:26:03] he we know was God in the flesh.
[1:26:07] 100% God, 100% man.
[1:26:12] So if he expressed godliness
[1:26:15] from the aspect alone of deity,
[1:26:19] he could never be my example.
[1:26:22] Since I wasn't born of a virgin, he
[1:26:26] could never be yours.
[1:26:28] So he must humble himself
[1:26:34] and become void
[1:26:37] in the sense of the great power of his
[1:26:40] godhead.
[1:26:43] He must change himself and canosis
[1:26:47] himself
[1:26:49] and empty out
[1:26:52] and make void. SO NOW HE WALKS ON THE
[1:26:54] EARTH THEN for 30 years
[1:26:57] under this feeling
[1:27:00] of a man without deity
[1:27:04] in his body.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Now when the father comes in him then
[1:27:09] the FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD bodily
[1:27:12] is now embodied in God's human temple.
[1:27:15] Look at 1 John chapter 2:4. He that
[1:27:18] saith, I know him, and keepeth not his
[1:27:20] commandments, is a liar, and the truth
[1:27:24] is not in him. BUT WHO SO keepeth his
[1:27:27] word, not quoteth it,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Not studyth it,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; but he that keepeth his word. In him
[1:27:36] verily is the love of GOD PERFECTED.
[1:27:39] HEREBY KNOW WE THAT we are in him. He
[1:27:42] that saith, he abideth in him ought
[1:27:46] himself
[1:27:48] also to walk
[1:27:51] even as he walked.
[1:27:54] He that saith he abideth in him ought
[1:27:57] himself. So those of us that say we
[1:28:00] abide in the Lord Jesus ought ourselves
[1:28:03] to walk even as he walked. SO, HOW IS
[1:28:07] THAT possible if he walked like God
[1:28:11] alone?
[1:28:12] I could never do that. You could never
[1:28:14] do that. But what if he walked as a man
[1:28:20] filled with God?
[1:28:23] He would have to battle things. He would
[1:28:26] have to go through things because
[1:28:30] remember his hatred FOR THIS ABOMINATION
[1:28:33] IS SO TO SET YOU FREE.
[1:28:36] NOT hates you like he hates the bondage
[1:28:40] you're in.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Jud, I know you understand this is the
[1:28:44] way we help people.
[1:28:47] Oh my goodness. If you could sit with me
[1:28:50] sometimes and hear the things that I
[1:28:53] have heard in the lives of individuals,
[1:28:57] the sin they've got into,
[1:29:00] oh, the evil that they've overcome with.
[1:29:04] And as a pastor, as a preacher, IT
[1:29:07] BREAKS MY HEART. Brother Donnie, I've
[1:29:10] been doing this. I' I've been doing
[1:29:11] that. I got involved in this. I've got
[1:29:13] involved that. Whether whether they come
[1:29:15] here or not, just in different places
[1:29:16] around the world that I've heard
[1:29:18] horrible, horrible stuff.
[1:29:21] AND IF I WOULD LET HATRED RISE UP IN MY
[1:29:25] HEART, AND WHEN I LOOK AT THEM, I feel
[1:29:28] that hatred coming out of me.
[1:29:32] And I look at them and say, "Dave
[1:29:34] Johnson, how in the world could you do
[1:29:36] that? I'm so ashamed OF YOU. YOU OUGHT
[1:29:39] TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. I'LL TELL YOU
[1:29:41] ONE THING that
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Am I treating the sin?"
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Or am I treating the sinner?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[1:30:00] NOW YOU SEE ONE THING ABOUT JESUS
[1:30:02] DISPLAYING godliness was
[1:30:05] that he always took the father's word
[1:30:08] over fear, anxiety, temptation, tests,
[1:30:13] trials. Notice in Matthew 4:4, "And he
[1:30:17] answered and said, it is written, man
[1:30:21] shall not live by bread alone, but by
[1:30:24] every word that proceedth out of the
[1:30:27] mouth of God." Verse 7, Jesus said unto
[1:30:30] him to the devil, "It is WRITTEN AGAIN,
[1:30:33] THOU SHALT NOT tempt the Lord thy God."
[1:30:37] Verse 10. Then saith Jesus UNTO HIM,
[1:30:40] "GET THEE HENCE, SATAN, for it is
[1:30:43] written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy
[1:30:45] God, and him only shalt thou serve." I
[1:30:48] want you to notice that he's not
[1:30:50] overcoming
[1:30:51] by waiting on A VISION.
[1:30:54] HE'S NOT OVERCOMING BY SPEAKING in
[1:30:56] tongues and interpreting.
[1:30:59] HE'S NOT OVERCOMING BY SAYING, "LET ME
[1:31:02] get along now. Let me pray and let me
[1:31:04] get the anointing on me." And when the
[1:31:06] anointing comes, I'LL MEET YOU, SATAN.
[1:31:08] YOU WILL NOT DEFEAT ME. But how is he
[1:31:12] overcoming? Through the attribute of
[1:31:14] divine godliness.
[1:31:17] To be LIKE GOD. TO BE like God in a
[1:31:21] human being IS WHEN YOU AND I ARE
[1:31:24] tempted and we're going through great
[1:31:26] times of discouragement. YOU ARE
[1:31:28] DISPLAYING GODLINESS
[1:31:31] when you always point the devil and
[1:31:33] yourself back to his word. He said he'd
[1:31:36] never leave me. He said he'd never
[1:31:38] forsake me. Well, how come he ain't
[1:31:40] answering your prayers? Well, I don't
[1:31:41] know, but God is not a liar. Well,
[1:31:43] you're going through this and your
[1:31:44] family's going through that. You've been
[1:31:46] through one trial after another. Don't
[1:31:48] sound like to me God loves you, but
[1:31:50] you're going to display godliness in
[1:31:53] your tests. YOU'RE GOING TO DISPLAY
[1:31:55] GODLINESS. THIS IS WHAT JESUS DONE. HE
[1:31:58] SHOWED US how God would live if God was
[1:32:02] a man and he was. WELL, HOW IS GOD'S
[1:32:06] WIFE GOING TO LIVE? Because they are
[1:32:08] men, women, boys, and girls. If we have
[1:32:11] godliness in our life and power through
[1:32:14] sincerity is going to empower us to
[1:32:17] overcome, we're going to stand right
[1:32:20] there on the word. We'll look
[1:32:21] circumstance in the face. will look all
[1:32:24] types of negative things in the FACE AND
[1:32:26] SAY, "GOD IS TRUE AND YOU ARE A LIAR,
[1:32:29] DEVIL. GET BEHIND ME, SATAN."
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; NOTICE PHILIPPIANS 2:3. LET NOTHING BE
[1:32:37] done through strife
[1:32:40] or VAIN GLORY,
[1:32:43] BUT in loneliness
[1:32:45] of mind, let each esteem other better
[1:32:51] than themselves.
[1:32:55] NOW YOU SEE PAUL captures
[1:32:59] the very manifestation of Jesus
[1:33:03] in this verse.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; So he's quoting Jesus life
[1:33:10] and he rewrites it in the Philippian
[1:33:13] letter.
[1:33:15] Now we could not do this prior to his
[1:33:18] advent. REMEMBER HE BECOME A CREATURE OF
[1:33:20] TIME.
[1:33:22] THE CREATURE OF time emptied himself.
[1:33:31] Well, at least you're listening. Praise
[1:33:33] the Lord. NOW, WATCH AGAIN. PAUL WHEN HE
[1:33:36] when he deals with this and he uses
[1:33:38] these words, I love them. You're talking
[1:33:40] about powerful. Let nothing be done
[1:33:43] through strife, which means contentious
[1:33:47] electioneering
[1:33:49] or intriguing for office.
[1:33:53] Now you hear us talk about church
[1:33:55] politics,
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; believe me, it's around this message.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; God have mercy on us and keep it out of
[1:34:01] our church.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; So people running for an office like
[1:34:05] somebody would for a mayor or a
[1:34:07] governor. I want to be the associate
[1:34:08] pastor. I want to be a deacon. I want to
[1:34:10] be this. I want to be that. Go to go
[1:34:12] talk to this brother. Oh, tell brother
[1:34:13] so and so maybe I could put me on the
[1:34:14] board. Me or maybe I could be the
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my brother.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Let nothing be done through elections,
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; campaigns.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; OH MY.
[1:34:28] OR VAIN GLORY, groundless
[1:34:32] self-esteem,
[1:34:34] empty pride,
[1:34:38] a vain opinion
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; or error.
[1:34:44] Let nothing be done through strife OR
[1:34:47] VAIN GLORY. NOW REMEMBER PAUL IS
[1:34:49] CATCHING the epitome of the eternal
[1:34:51] which become a time creature and showed
[1:34:54] us how the eternal lived because this is
[1:34:57] the very life of the Lord Jesus we're
[1:34:59] reading about
[1:35:02] but in loneliness
[1:35:05] of mind. What a powerful powerful word.
[1:35:09] I want you to LOOK AT THIS LONELINESS of
[1:35:12] mind. Now remember whenever he writes
[1:35:15] this he's writing it to a people who he
[1:35:18] believes have achieved the new births.
[1:35:21] So it's humbleness OF MIND THE HAVING A
[1:35:25] HUMBLE opinion
[1:35:27] of oneself.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Now most of us probably don't have a
[1:35:35] difficult time
[1:35:37] having humble opinions of everybody
[1:35:39] else.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:35:42] Well, she ain't much of a Christian.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; He ain't much of a singer.
[1:35:48] He ain't much of this. You see what
[1:35:50] you're doing? You're having a humble
[1:35:52] opinion. And I know sometimes we're
[1:35:54] quoting their track record, but there's
[1:35:56] always hope for change.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I want YOU TO NOTICE THAT WHY WOULD
[1:36:03] PAUL CATCH THIS? THIS COULD NOT BE SAID,
[1:36:06] AS I said, in the OLD TESTAMENT BECAUSE
[1:36:07] MAN WOULD not be able to do this. Even
[1:36:09] Moses couldn't have done this.
[1:36:11] THE HAVING A HUMBLE OPINION OF ONESELF,
[1:36:14] A DEEP sense of one's moral littleness.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; But do we have a sense of how little
[1:36:25] that we are
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; or how big
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; we think we are?
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Godliness.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; How many still wants it? Yeah.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Well, three threequarters of you, half
[1:36:42] of you. Okay. Well, I'll keep on
[1:36:43] preaching then. I'll maybe I'll get the
[1:36:45] other quarter.
[1:36:47] My my deep sense of one's moral
[1:36:49] litterness, modesty, humility, humility,
[1:36:54] loneliness of mind. Now, with the
[1:36:57] meanings of the words intact, let's read
[1:36:58] the verse again. Let nothing be done
[1:37:00] through strife, contentious,
[1:37:02] electionary, vain glory, groundless
[1:37:05] self-esteem,
[1:37:07] or loneliness. Have loneliness of mind,
[1:37:09] the humble opinion of one's self. LET
[1:37:13] EACH ESTEEM OTHER better than themsel.
[1:37:17] So true humility, LISTEN SAINTS, TRUE
[1:37:20] HUMILITY DOES NOT CON OH, IT DOES NOT
[1:37:24] CONSIST OF THE LONELINESS of expression
[1:37:26] of others, but in the loneliness of mind
[1:37:29] and opinion actually of yourself.
[1:37:33] MY MY 1 PETER 5:5 LIKEWISE, YE YOUNGER,
[1:37:37] submit yourselves UNTO THE ELDER. YAY,
[1:37:40] ALL OF YOU BE SUBJECT ONE TO ANOTHER.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And be clothed
[1:37:50] with humility.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Now I'm talking bride material.
[1:38:00] Not how big I am, how great I am, how
[1:38:02] important I am, not how big you are, how
[1:38:05] important we are.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; But our clothing is actually humility.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Now again, Paul is capturing the epitome
[1:38:17] of the canosis of God.
[1:38:22] For he who knew no sin becomes sin that
[1:38:24] we might become the very righteousness
[1:38:25] of God in him. Let this mind be in you,
[1:38:27] which was also in Christ Jesus, who
[1:38:29] being in the form of God, thought it not
[1:38:30] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[1:38:32] of himself of no reputation.
[1:38:39] Oh my. COLOSSIANS 3:12, "PUT ON
[1:38:42] THEREFORE AS THE ELECT OF GOD, HOLY AND
[1:38:45] BELOVED, bowels of mercies, kindness,
[1:38:50] humbleness of mind, meekness,
[1:38:53] longsuffering." [snorts]
[1:38:57] Actually, if you get this right, and
[1:38:59] it's the mind of Christ,
[1:39:01] it will let you be able to view your
[1:39:04] brothers
[1:39:06] of being more devoted to God than you
[1:39:09] are.
[1:39:11] Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Which in turn will make your brothers
[1:39:15] feel the same way about you.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Now, it's evident that some of our
[1:39:19] preachers in the message don't have this
[1:39:21] because they think they're the greatest
[1:39:22] men that God ever sent upon the earth.
[1:39:25] They are God's gift to the earth and and
[1:39:27] you you all are so blessed just to be
[1:39:29] able to, you know, just walk in the in
[1:39:31] the tracks where they said, "Uh, need a
[1:39:34] great lesson in humility." Amen.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; But a true man of God can look around
[1:39:39] and say, "God, what have I ever done for
[1:39:41] you? God, what am I going to amount to?
[1:39:43] Lord God, you've done this." I ain't
[1:39:45] talking about men who say that and it's
[1:39:48] vain and empty.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about men who believe it
[1:39:51] about themsel. That's right.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Preach, Brother Donnie.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen, Brother Donnie. We're behind you,
[1:39:57] Brother Donnie. Glory to God, Brother
[1:39:59] Donnie. I'm making up all these
[1:40:01] different voices. Y'all should be doing
[1:40:02] it for me, but since you ain't going to,
[1:40:03] I guess I'll have to DO IT MYSELF.
[1:40:05] PREACHER, BROTHER DONNIE. AMEN, BROTHER.
[1:40:07] GLORY, [screaming] BROTHER DONNIE. AMEN,
[1:40:09] BROTHER DONNIE. THANK YOU, JESUS. THANK
[1:40:11] YOU, JESUS. THAT WAS SOME OF YOU
[1:40:13] SISTERS.
[1:40:16] Philippians chapter 2:4.
[1:40:20] Look not every man on his own things,
[1:40:23] but every man also on the things of
[1:40:27] others. So in looking at the things that
[1:40:29] you excel on and that you've achieved,
[1:40:33] what you actually do is turn your eyes
[1:40:36] away from yourself
[1:40:39] and look at others.
[1:40:44] You see, friends, this is the exact
[1:40:45] opposite of what the world is telling
[1:40:47] us.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; They're teaching us how to love oursel.
[1:40:50] I have never had a problem with that.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to speak for the rest of
[1:40:54] you. Neither have you.
[1:40:57] You all don't stand in front of the
[1:40:58] mirror. Some of you men pimp like a
[1:41:00] woman. My lord, you stand there and
[1:41:01] polish them teeth and floss them and
[1:41:03] rebrush them and refloss them and got
[1:41:05] them three hairs and boy, you baby them
[1:41:07] three. Which I guess if I had three, I'd
[1:41:09] baby them, too. Boy, you look at this
[1:41:11] and that and the other and you walk in,
[1:41:13] well, I can't believe so and so. Look at
[1:41:14] them socks. They don't even matter. Who
[1:41:16] in the world picked out his britches? I
[1:41:18] can't believe this or that. OH MY. WE'VE
[1:41:20] GOT THIS GREAT IMAGE. DON'T YOU
[1:41:22] UNDERSTAND, FRIENDS? It's an age when
[1:41:24] people worship THE HUMAN BODY. DO YOU
[1:41:27] THINK IT'S JUST HAPPENED IN THIS DAY
[1:41:29] THAT GYMS ARE POPPING up everywhere and
[1:41:32] people wanting to go to the gym? Don't
[1:41:34] you understand? I'm not against
[1:41:36] exercise, but when you GET TO A SPOT TO
[1:41:38] WHERE YOUR GOD BECOMES YOUR BODY, YOU'RE
[1:41:41] HEADING for hell. YOU GET TO A SPOT TO
[1:41:44] WHERE YOU WANT TO FLEX YOUR MUSCLES AND
[1:41:46] LOOK AT HOW STRONG YOU ARE AND HOW I
[1:41:48] AIN'T INTERESTED. CAN YOU BENCH 110 LBS?
[1:41:51] CAN YOU BRING THAT DEMON OF PORNOGRAPHY
[1:41:54] UNDER YOUR FEET? DON'T TELL ME HOW BIG
[1:41:56] YOUR BICEPS ARE AND YOUR TRICEPS AND
[1:41:58] YOUR BICEPS. I WANT TO SEE, CAN YOU PUT
[1:42:01] SATAN UNDER YOUR FEET AND LIVE A GODLY
[1:42:04] LIFE THAT DEMONS IN HELL ARE SCARED OF
[1:42:07] YOU. [applause and cheering]
[1:42:15] True humility can look at those you go
[1:42:17] to church with. Every true man of God
[1:42:20] who has humility can look at the
[1:42:22] ministry of others and see where they
[1:42:25] actually excel him.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; The more I study these things, the more
[1:42:35] I'm wondering how many there will be in
[1:42:36] the rapture.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; 30, 35, 40.
[1:42:46] Philippians 2:5, "Let this mind be in
[1:42:49] you which was also in Christ Jesus."
[1:42:54] In other words, think ye the same things
[1:42:58] as Jesus Christ.
[1:43:00] Let the same condescending and humble
[1:43:04] department
[1:43:06] appear in you
[1:43:09] as it did in him.
[1:43:11] So when he was here, every time a bird
[1:43:14] would have sung, he could have said, "I
[1:43:17] composed that song.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; I actually gave that to the birds."
[1:43:24] And whenever a go,
[1:43:26] he said, "I made him do that. You like
[1:43:28] that? That's in the key of C flat." You
[1:43:30] know, I mean, and the cow.
[1:43:33] He said, "I own that. That's
[1:43:34] copyrighted.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:38] You looked at the rainbow and you seen
[1:43:40] the colors. He said, "I I own that. I
[1:43:42] made that. I could copyright that."
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; He could have preached things that would
[1:43:49] have totally overwhelmed the greatest
[1:43:51] theologian that ever lived.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; But instead, he humbled himself and
[1:43:57] preached about fishing.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And a sewer went forth to sew his seed.
[1:44:03] Yes, sir.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; You mean that was his depth?
[1:44:09] Come on.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; That was as deep as Jesus was.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; No, it wasn't as deep as Jesus was.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; He condescended,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; he condenses.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, he could have preached things NO ONE
[1:44:25] COULD HAVE EVEN COMPREHENDED. AND WHAT
[1:44:27] good would that have done?
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Showed that he was a knowit all.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; He's truly the only know-it-all that
[1:44:34] ever lived.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:38] I SAID HE'S THE ONLY KNOW IT ALL THAT
[1:44:40] EVER LIVED, BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE A KNOW IT
[1:44:42] ALL ATTITUDE. AND YET HE KNEW IT
[1:44:44] [screaming] ALL.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; GODLINESS.
[1:44:56] You see, your attitude and my attitude
[1:44:59] should be the same as Christ Jesus.
[1:45:01] After all, outlook
[1:45:04] determines outcome.
[1:45:08] Outlook determines outcome. So if the
[1:45:10] outlook is selfish, the actions will be
[1:45:13] divisive
[1:45:15] and destructive.
[1:45:18] But if it's Christ centered, it will be
[1:45:21] building up the kingdom of God.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. building up the kingdom,
[1:45:28] not what we can tear down.
[1:45:31] What can we do to help?
[1:45:35] Let me close you momentarily.
[1:45:38] I love this. I preached this around the
[1:45:40] world.
[1:45:42] Question answers cood book. Every time
[1:45:45] I've ever preached them, wherever it's
[1:45:47] ever been, just reading these quotes,
[1:45:48] you know, it just really does something
[1:45:50] to people. Satan was the original
[1:45:53] archangel
[1:45:55] of God.
[1:45:58] He once dwelt in the heaven.
[1:46:02] He was once the greatest person in the
[1:46:05] heavens
[1:46:07] outside
[1:46:09] of God.
[1:46:14] He was God's right-hand man
[1:46:19] to fellowship.
[1:46:23] So if God wanted to talk to anyone
[1:46:26] and fellowship with any of his angelic
[1:46:28] beings precreation
[1:46:30] of man,
[1:46:33] he would talk to Lucifer. Now remember,
[1:46:35] not the devil because at that time he
[1:46:37] was not the devil. He was Lucifer, day
[1:46:41] star, lightbringer.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; So him and Lucifer would fellowship.
[1:46:52] You imagine what they talked about.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; And God would fellowship
[1:46:58] with the lightbringer.
[1:47:01] Isaiah 14, of course, and Ezekiel also
[1:47:03] tells us, Ezekiel 28,
[1:47:06] thou was perfect
[1:47:09] until iniquity
[1:47:11] was found in me. THOU WAS PERFECT FROM
[1:47:14] THE DAY THAT THOU was created. And when
[1:47:17] he's riding my back, sometimes I like to
[1:47:20] pull it up on my phone and pull out one
[1:47:23] of my favorite scriptures to him and
[1:47:25] say, "Come a little closer.
[1:47:28] Let me remind you, you were created,
[1:47:31] which means you're going to die.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; You are not eternal. Amen. [laughter]
[1:47:38] YOU ARE NOT PART OF THAT BLESSED ELOHIM,
[1:47:41] and I am. You're a creature of time, and
[1:47:45] I'm not. WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL,
[1:47:48] THERE WILL STILL be you and I.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Listen to what a position, friends.
[1:47:56] He was God's right-hand man to
[1:47:59] fellowship.
[1:48:01] And he smoked a cigarette and found a
[1:48:04] tobacco plant out there in the Garden of
[1:48:05] Eden. And he found a hemp plant. And he
[1:48:09] found corn and made moonshine.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; He got puffed up
[1:48:17] in his heart.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; And isn't that just the way people get
[1:48:22] today? LET GOD JUST BLESS A fellow a
[1:48:26] little bit and put a confidence in him
[1:48:27] and he gets to be a knowit-all.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; He gets to he's GOT TO START AN
[1:48:32] organization or he's got to do
[1:48:34] something. Now friends, don't just limit
[1:48:36] this Baptist Church of God, Church of
[1:48:37] Christ. Bring it right on down to our
[1:48:39] ranks. And what will a man do whenever
[1:48:41] he feels like he's got something
[1:48:42] superior to the rest of the brethren?
[1:48:45] He's saying SOMETHING ELSE NOBODY ELSE
[1:48:47] IS SAYING. OH, THERE AIN'T NOBODY THAT'S
[1:48:50] even close. I'd be terrified of such a
[1:48:52] thought myself. This is a body move.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; It ain't a one-man deal no more. God
[1:48:58] ain't got one man in the south and one
[1:48:59] man in the north and one man over in
[1:49:01] Europe. God's got men everywhere.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; And what do they WANT TO DO? START
[1:49:08] SOMETHING AND THEN PUT A LITTLE fence
[1:49:10] around it. And you got to come through
[1:49:12] our gate
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; to get in.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Well, to be honest with you, I ain't
[1:49:19] going through that gate in the first
[1:49:20] place. They may hand me up in there.
[1:49:24] He's got to start an organization. HE'S
[1:49:26] GOT TO DO something that's different.
[1:49:29] Why art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[1:49:31] Lucifer? Wow. Go from talking about
[1:49:34] preachers to talking about the devil.
[1:49:39] Listen to this and I'll close.
[1:49:42] God has a hard time
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; trying
[1:49:50] to get somebody
[1:49:54] that he can deal with
[1:49:57] that'll stay humble.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? He made this universe.
[1:50:05] He didn't have a hard time. No,
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; he made all these things that he's made.
[1:50:13] He didn't have a hard time.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Who gives God the hardest time?
[1:50:18] [clears throat]
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of it.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sick of it. Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I want to change my hard times instead
[1:50:34] of this way to this way.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I want to give that devil a hard time.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Anybody else?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; We humble ourselves. [applause]
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Let me close.
[1:50:49] God has a hard time trying to get
[1:50:51] somebody that he can deal with that'll
[1:50:54] stay humble and meek
[1:50:57] and stay in the place until God calls
[1:50:59] him to do something. You believe that?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; And a man that God can bless and he'll
[1:51:05] still keep himself a man
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; and not be an angel
[1:51:12] or a God.
[1:51:15] Yeah.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; I realize, friends, I'm as dumb as a
[1:51:19] coal bucket,
[1:51:21] but I don't understand how a cold bucket
[1:51:23] thinking could ever get to a place that
[1:51:26] you think you're a god
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; or you're an angel. Apparently, people
[1:51:31] that get there think a lot more of their
[1:51:33] yourself than I think of mine.
[1:51:37] Cuz my greatest enemy, it's not women,
[1:51:41] it's not money, it's not popularity,
[1:51:44] it's not pornography.
[1:51:46] My greatest enemy is me.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; I've not one thing to be proud of, not
[1:51:53] one thing to brag on.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Everything that I've ever got good has
[1:51:59] come from God. Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Anything I ever accomplish in this life,
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; he will deserve all the credits and all
[1:52:07] the glory.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; How can I make a god out of me?
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; How can I make a god or an angel out of
[1:52:16] you?
[1:52:18] Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; But if we will humble oursel,
[1:52:24] God will transform us into a place of
[1:52:29] godship.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Godship.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; You, if you're born again today, must
[1:52:42] stand.
[1:52:44] You have a part of heaven
[1:52:48] in your soul.
[1:52:51] The prophet calls that deity.
[1:52:56] When God divided himself way back before
[1:53:00] there was angels in time
[1:53:03] and he thought of his attributes of his
[1:53:05] children,
[1:53:07] he was going to allocate to them a
[1:53:10] portion of his deity. That's what's in
[1:53:13] you. that helps you. That's what in you.
[1:53:16] Even when your flesh, when you do
[1:53:18] something wrong, you don't have to wait
[1:53:21] and just hear me preach it. Wait till
[1:53:22] next Wednesday, next Sunday, whenever it
[1:53:24] is, and you'll know you're wrong. If
[1:53:26] you've got deity in you, your own
[1:53:28] baptism of deity will convict you for
[1:53:31] what you've said or done.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; How many knows what I'm talking about?
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Can I finish this quote here?
[1:53:41] As soon as a man gets blessed and has a
[1:53:43] little something given to him, he wants
[1:53:44] to become a god.
[1:53:47] He wants to become an angel.
[1:53:50] He wants to become some great person.
[1:53:54] Me and me and mine and I prayed for this
[1:53:58] person. God showed me that. I've done
[1:54:00] this and I've done that. And they get
[1:54:01] up. My goodness. They they talk about
[1:54:03] themselves 30 minutes and then talk
[1:54:05] about the Lord 25.
[1:54:07] But it's all giving glory to God. really
[1:54:09] is it?
[1:54:13] Is it?
[1:54:16] So at the end of that service, does that
[1:54:18] make people want to get closer to God or
[1:54:19] does it make them want to get close to
[1:54:20] that man so we pray for him?
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Do they have same confidence that God
[1:54:26] without that man could do the great
[1:54:28] works? It's evident people can't
[1:54:29] friends.
[1:54:32] So their faith is not in God's word, but
[1:54:34] their faith is in that man praying for
[1:54:37] them and then they'll get well. Come on.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; So what if God takes that man from the
[1:54:42] earth?
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; So if your only way of deliverance and
[1:54:47] help is through me, then every one of
[1:54:49] you are lost.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz if time carries one day, I will
[1:54:53] leave this world.
[1:54:57] You want your faith to be in the Lord
[1:54:59] Jesus.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Does God use men? Of course. Does God
[1:55:03] have special gifts? Of course. But never
[1:55:06] ever put any man before your Lord Jesus.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Notice this. He said, "That's the wrong
[1:55:16] attitude.
[1:55:18] God's hunting for somebody."
[1:55:22] God has been on a hunting trip.
[1:55:27] Ever since man fell,
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; he's hunting for trophies.
[1:55:33] These trophies are men.
[1:55:38] He said God's hunting for somebody
[1:55:43] who he could bless and pour out the
[1:55:45] blessings
[1:55:47] and the more he blessed,
[1:55:50] the littleler
[1:55:53] the man will become.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; But see, that's backwards to us.
[1:56:00] The way we look at it, the more God uses
[1:56:02] the man, the bigger he gets, the bigger,
[1:56:05] the greater, more meetings, famous.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Someone came [clears throat] before our
[1:56:14] fall fest is visiting some family here
[1:56:18] and I was out here working, doing some
[1:56:20] stuff. This brother came over and he
[1:56:22] said, "Your brother don't recogn." I
[1:56:23] said, "Yeah, probably didn't look like
[1:56:24] it. Had on blue jeans, holes in them,
[1:56:26] mud. I've been down on them down on my
[1:56:28] knees filling a ditch up over here and
[1:56:30] spreading out mulch and sweat. Probably
[1:56:32] smelt bad. Oh, he said, "I I've seen you
[1:56:35] hours and hours and hours on on video."
[1:56:37] "Oh, brother, so glad to meet you." "Oh
[1:56:38] my, you're you're probably one the most
[1:56:40] famous preacher in the message." I said,
[1:56:41] "Brother,
[1:56:43] Donnie Reagan and the word famous to me
[1:56:46] don't go together.
[1:56:50] There's only one famous
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; person."
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; That we want to talk about around here.
[1:56:57] And it sure ain't me.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; And it ain't no other preacher.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; It's our Lord Jesus.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; So, can we tell God today,
[1:57:12] I want to be so godly,
[1:57:16] and I promise you, if you use me,
[1:57:19] I'll never be exalted.
[1:57:23] Lord, if you'll take my gift that you
[1:57:24] gave me and anoint my singing, and
[1:57:26] whenever I sing, I will bless your
[1:57:28] people, I promise you, I'll never walk
[1:57:31] from behind that piano and think, "What
[1:57:34] a singer I am. I'm so gifted. I'm so
[1:57:38] talented."
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; But walk off here with godliness
[1:57:46] and bow your head and thank God that he
[1:57:49] could use you.
[1:57:54] Don't you love him today?
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be godly?
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Godly. You see, Jesus didn't live
[1:58:04] godliness from the throne.
[1:58:06] He lived godliness from a dust body.
[1:58:11] May God help us.
[1:58:14] You'll never get more of God until you
[1:58:16] become nothing.
[1:58:19] You've got to belittle
[1:58:22] yourself.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Belittle yourself. He that will exalt
[1:58:27] himself, God will abase. He that will
[1:58:29] humble himself, God will exalt. You've
[1:58:32] got to get little before you can get
[1:58:34] big. And you'll never be big in your own
[1:58:38] self. You'll only be as big as God will
[1:58:43] be big
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; in you. Was
[1:58:49] it great what God did on our prophet of
[1:58:51] this age? Yes. Was it tremendous? Yes.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't brother Brandon been big.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; It was God being big in him.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; There's great men of God that's been in
[1:59:01] this message and they've done great,
[1:59:03] tremendous works for God. BUT IT WASN'T
[1:59:05] THAT they were big. It was God that got
[1:59:07] big in them.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Grant it to us, Lord.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be big myself. I don't I
[1:59:15] I just want to be whatever. But maybe
[1:59:18] there's some big people here today. May
[1:59:21] you stay big
[1:59:23] as long as you let God be big in you.
[1:59:28] Let's bow our heads together.
[1:59:35] Oh Jesus, as we stand in your presence
[1:59:37] today, Father,
[1:59:41] these types of quotes, Lord, when I read
[1:59:44] them and study them,
[1:59:47] I have to be honest and say, Lord,
[1:59:49] there's an element of fear that it
[1:59:51] [music] brings
[1:59:54] because we've seen preachers and
[1:59:58] different people that would get big in
[2:00:00] their eyes. It isn't always preachers.
[2:00:01] Sometimes leoty get know-it-all
[2:00:03] attitudes and they've been around the
[2:00:05] message for how many years ever years
[2:00:08] it's been and they think they know more
[2:00:09] than any preacher preaching and they get
[2:00:12] this knowit all attitude. They don't
[2:00:14] need nobody to tell me nothing. They
[2:00:16] don't need to listen no more.
[2:00:19] Help each one of us. Father,
[2:00:22] help our song leaders. Help our singers.
[2:00:24] Help our musicians, our deacons, our
[2:00:27] trustees. every preacher Lord among us.
[2:00:31] God help me.
[2:00:34] I need your help. Lord Jesus,
[2:00:38] help me. Lord,
[2:00:42] I'll never be a great person. I don't
[2:00:44] have the makings of a great person.
[2:00:48] I just want to be an obedient person.
[2:00:53] You privileged me to be able to travel
[2:00:55] around the world and I've met some great
[2:00:57] men.
[2:00:59] But I'm reminded
[2:01:01] brother George Burcham when he told me
[2:01:03] several times of course down in Kentucky
[2:01:05] when the prophet came to his
[2:01:08] cheese plant there in Albany, Kentucky.
[2:01:11] Brother George said they had antiques in
[2:01:13] their home. And Brother Brandham came
[2:01:16] there to their house and he wouldn't
[2:01:18] even sit on the furniture because he
[2:01:21] said it was so nice. He he just wanted
[2:01:24] to sit in the floor. So he sat in the
[2:01:26] floor in the living room with his legs
[2:01:30] crossed Indian style.
[2:01:34] And he said, 'Oh, brother Donnie, he
[2:01:36] would just talk about you and talk about
[2:01:39] this brother and that brother and
[2:01:41] another brother. He said he made you
[2:01:43] feel like he was the greatest person
[2:01:45] that ever was. And he lift up this man
[2:01:47] and that man and just humble himself and
[2:01:51] never bragged on how he done this or
[2:01:53] done that or the other.
[2:01:57] Thank you for such a man, Lord.
[2:02:00] It's no wonder you could do so much with
[2:02:02] him.
[2:02:04] Father, I desire to be godly.
[2:02:08] You've let me lay my hands on the sick
[2:02:10] of cancer. You've healed them.
[2:02:14] I've walked into the med center in the
[2:02:16] intensive care unit, lay my hand on one
[2:02:18] of our brothers and a heart attack and
[2:02:21] watched you stop it.
[2:02:24] I walked into the nick unit, Lord, when
[2:02:26] there was a valve messed up in a child
[2:02:29] and watched you work a miracle in that
[2:02:32] child.
[2:02:33] I've seen you do so many awesome,
[2:02:35] wonderful things,
[2:02:38] but I can't do none of those.
[2:02:42] I'm not a miracle worker.
[2:02:45] I'm not a healer. Anybody that's ever
[2:02:48] heard me knows I'm not much of a
[2:02:49] preacher. Really, not much of anything,
[2:02:52] I guess.
[2:02:54] But the key is if I could just get
[2:02:56] myself out of the way.
[2:02:58] If our church, if we could just each one
[2:03:01] of us get ourselves out of the way
[2:03:05] and humble ourselves.
[2:03:08] Oh, what do you want to do through us,
[2:03:11] Jesus?
[2:03:14] And Lord, we promise you today,
[2:03:17] whatever you do,
[2:03:20] we will not deprive you of the honor
[2:03:23] or the glory.
[2:03:26] We promise we will never venture into
[2:03:29] that great divine realm
[2:03:32] of the glory of God.
[2:03:35] I want to be more like you, Jesus.
[2:03:39] I want to be more like you. Not just in
[2:03:41] healing the sick and casting out devils
[2:03:44] and all that. Yes, I do. I want that,
[2:03:47] Lord.
[2:03:50] But I want to be able to turn my cheek,
[2:03:52] Lord,
[2:03:53] when people lie on me and fabricate
[2:03:56] stuff and try to ruin my character. I
[2:03:58] want to be able just walk right back up
[2:04:00] in this pull pit and not use the pullpit
[2:04:02] as a an area to try to get even with
[2:04:05] people and throw things at people. No,
[2:04:07] [snorts]
[2:04:10] I want to believe what your prophet said
[2:04:12] when he talked about the sacred desk.
[2:04:15] this
[2:04:18] being the closest place to heaven on
[2:04:22] earth.
[2:04:24] Help all the minister brothers at our
[2:04:26] church to recognize that when they walk
[2:04:27] up behind this desk.
[2:04:30] It's not a place to exalt ourselves.
[2:04:33] It's not a place for frivolous talk, but
[2:04:37] it's a place to lift up Jesus,
[2:04:41] a place to help you, his bride.
[2:04:46] We worship you today, Lord.
[2:04:50] Make us more like you, Jesus.
[2:04:54] Make us more like you, Jesus.
[2:04:58] Anybody here just raise your hand to the
[2:05:00] Lord. Just tell him, "Lord,
[2:05:04] I want to be more
[2:05:06] godly."
[2:05:09] More godly, forgiving, loving. Oh, yeah.
[2:05:13] Stern when I need to be, steady when I
[2:05:15] need to be, strong when I need to be,
[2:05:17] unmoving
[2:05:19] but kind. I want to hate the system,
[2:05:23] Lord, but love the people in it. And I
[2:05:26] want to love them so much that I look at
[2:05:29] them with pity
[2:05:31] and I don't judge them with a harsh
[2:05:34] attitude.
[2:05:36] Help us, dear Jesus.
[2:05:39] We want to love like you, Father. We
[2:05:41] want to forgive like you.
[2:05:44] Mold me, Lord Jesus.
[2:05:46] If you need a preacher that needs to be
[2:05:49] run down, run over, pushed, laughed at,
[2:05:53] ridiculed,
[2:05:55] it's picture in the paper, it's picture
[2:05:58] all over international television around
[2:06:00] the world.
[2:06:03] I will, Lord.
[2:06:08] You want a preacher that'll have to be
[2:06:10] laughed at and even some of his own
[2:06:12] friends will laugh at him.
[2:06:16] I will, Lord.
[2:06:19] Oh, I know most others want signs,
[2:06:21] wonders, miracles, fame, money,
[2:06:25] but Jesus, you had to be hated and
[2:06:27] despised. Who are we to be better than
[2:06:30] you?
[2:06:32] Is there any Christians here today
[2:06:33] that'll say the same? Lord, I'm willing
[2:06:36] to bear your reproach. Not just your
[2:06:39] glory, not just your power. I'm willing
[2:06:43] to bear your reproach, Lord, for the
[2:06:46] cause of the gospel.
[2:06:50] Oh, we thank you, Jesus.
[2:06:54] We thank you, Jesus.
[2:06:56] We thank you, Jesus.
[2:06:59] Let's just stand now in this in this
[2:07:02] divine presence.
[2:07:05] The angels of God are here this morning,
[2:07:07] friends.
[2:07:09] They're here to minister to us, to help
[2:07:11] us.
[2:07:13] Oh, how the angels must relay the
[2:07:16] messages back up to heaven after a
[2:07:19] service like today. And they're standing
[2:07:21] near you and they're hearing what you're
[2:07:24] saying in prayer.
[2:07:26] They see your attitude that this
[2:07:28] preaching didn't make you mad and angry
[2:07:29] and all, you know, bent out of shape at
[2:07:32] the preacher and all that, but they
[2:07:34] heard you as you whispered, "Lord, help
[2:07:36] me.
[2:07:38] Lord, make me like that." You imagine
[2:07:40] for the rest of the evening, as we'd say
[2:07:41] it in time, the angels of God are going
[2:07:44] to be giving the report of how the
[2:07:47] service went today, of how the service
[2:07:50] went down in mind and how the service
[2:07:52] went up in Virginia and over in DC.
[2:07:54] Brother Mike Walls and all over the
[2:07:57] world hearing the reporting the words of
[2:08:01] the saints back to Father.
[2:08:04] Father, they I know you'd be so proud of
[2:08:07] them cuz that word it it really stung
[2:08:09] their human flesh. And Father, it really
[2:08:12] hurt them. But you ought to hurt them,
[2:08:14] Father.
[2:08:15] They were saying, "Yes, Lord, help me.
[2:08:18] Lord, I want to be like you." They
[2:08:20] nodded their heads. Bless their hearts.
[2:08:21] Some of them couldn't even say amen
[2:08:23] because they were so guilty. But they
[2:08:25] squeezed out a a nod and they said,
[2:08:27] "Lord Jesus, help me. Father, it's their
[2:08:30] desire to be like you."
[2:08:33] Hallelujah.
[2:08:36] Make me more
[2:08:39] like [music]
[2:08:40] thee.
[2:08:42] Let's just worship him together now.
