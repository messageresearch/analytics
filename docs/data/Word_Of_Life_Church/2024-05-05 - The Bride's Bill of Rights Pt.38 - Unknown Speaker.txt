verse six and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou Ross why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lies at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him 2 Corinthians CH 5:9 wherefore we labor that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him accepted of him Ephesians chap 1:5 having predestinated us into the adoption of children to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will this is why you're saved today it ain't just to make you feel good it ain't just about making you happy he saved you cuz he wanted to yeah it brings him pleasure to bring Deliverance to his people people according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved chitu is the Greek word highly favored to make graceful charming lovely agreeable compass with favor to honor with blessings brother Andrew Glover had sent me this quote the other day I just thought it was so wonderful and I'll share it with you what a privilege that it is to know that we are accepted in the presence of God through the name of Jesus Christ may the Lord bless his word you may be seated there's not a doubt in my mind today that most everybody that's attended a religious service by now Europe is 7 to8 hours ahead of us and New Zealand Australia about 17 hours ahead of us so it's already into their Monday all over the world people have attended synagogues chapels churches mosques all types of different places of worship to express their religion as I stood many years ago in Durban South Africa and I was invited by a brother Nami Nadu and he took me to a Hindu festival and I saw these people people as they were there to worship their gods and goddesses and the last count I had they had over 33 million of them so they gathered at this place and they were going to make a a journey to this very special Temple that was several hundred years old you've heard me tell it before years ago but they would have little uh buggies is the only way I know to describe them they would be 6 to 8 feet tall maybe six feet wide um and they would have different pictures of gods and goddesses some of you are familiar with Hinduism and some of their gods as the head of an elephant with a trunk and they take animals and different sorts of things that they worship and they would have different emblems on these uh buggy Chariot like looking things they were not drawn by horses they were not drawn by automobiles but actually they're going to be drawn by human beings so they have them all there and they're decorated and then I noticed that they was in little groups say 8 to 10 something like that and they'd be gathered around like in a circle around one individual standing in the middle of that they've got little symbols about this big and they're doing all that and clapping their hands and jumping and screaming and carrying on and this person is in the middle and all of a sudden they let out a scream of blood curdling scream and when they did they would start taking a long pin about this long taking that person's tongue and start weaving that PIN in their tongue they would take big grab hooks you all probably know what that is a big long grab hook and they would pull up the skin in their back and start putting that grab hook in their back that's what was going to pull this image this buggy of these gods and goddesses some of them whenever they hooked them up and they started pulling I saw them as those grab hooks were so sharp they pulled completely out of their backs and laid their backs wide open the blood streaming down their backs brother Nami knew some of those people there and there's one man as we watched this happen to him and as we walked by he waved at brother Nami and he said he's going to be in a lot of pain tomorrow because those who really become into this they become so entranced and entered into such a realm of demonic power they felt no pain now remember these are the people who will walk on hot coals that are white hot they will walk across that thing 10 to 12 some of them 20 feet long and never Scorch the bottom of their feet never feel 1 o of pain and yet they are doing this why for what purpose to be accepted by their gods because they are taught reincarnation so this is one reason why a real Hindu is not a meat eater now they'll serve you meat when you're there but they themselves will never eat meat they believe that it could could be their mother their grandfather their aunt their uncle that has died because you keep coming higher and higher in a form of life until you enter into that blessed State you know when I think of the darkness that's among the heathens of the age and then I think of the darkness that's among Christianity it breaks your heart to think that the majority of these people are not doing it for the pain they're not doing it for the consequence to be able to you know be have their picture on television or have their picture on a newspaper but they think they're pleasing their God or gods and they want to go to hell no they want to go to paradise whatever they think that is they want to go to heaven I saw a picture this week of one of the leaders of Hamas uh Yaya senoir is the third man from the top and he emerged out of the tunnels and I saw him as he had a picture I was telling Carol about as we come to church today there was a picture taken of him with a little boy maybe seven8 years old and he was holding him up in his arms this little boy had a hamos headband and he was dressed up like a Hamas militant Soldier had in his hands a weapon now remember these kids are taught from tiny tiny little things to hate Israel they will get a reward for every Jew that they kill this is what they're taught so you can see why that to killing Jews is not a big deal they're taught that like our children are taught grace and mercy and election they are taught that if they do this when they get to heaven all these men that give their lives will have 42 virgins waiting for them on the other side not only that but they're paid their families paid 10 $1,000 if they get killed to be a martyr they get a free apartment for years paid for by these Palestinian groups so they are taught this they believe it they accept it now we sit here today and we say well that's crazy I agree but I wonder how much crazy stuff we believe wonder how much crazy stuff that was given to us when we were children and we still hold on to some crazy stuff because will not let the word wash us clean from all that nonsense amen you see it's so easy whenever you are prior religious to coming to the illumination of the day to carry over some of the things that you held on to that you were taught from mothers fathers grandmothers grandfather fathers people you loved and respected and whenever we look at Cain and Abel and realize they were not there in the Garden of Eden they actually never stepped foot in the Garden of Eden so they're only carrying out what their mother and father taught them to do so they never broke the mystery of what brought them out of the Garden of Eden so the prophet tells us that they were taught that it was fruit so here Adam in his Fallen State now chooses to teach these two boys and keep the mystery of Cain's father away from them so they're not going to share with them no doubt they did it out of love yeah we've been loved by a few people that way heaven we and they talked about it no doubt and thought now what what do you think we should do honey well I you know I really don't see no need in in them knowing do we really need to let them know this well you know what I I I think you're right I I just agree with you totally Eve because after all Adam that will so humiliate me don't you think that that we just kind of let this go we we just we'll just Let It Go I mean really we know there's not three Gods we know that that absolutely by the scripture nobody was baptized in the name of titles we know that we we know that it was you know after Constantine and all that 3258 we know all that you think a lot of these preachers don't know that the prophet said how many of them are said in their study on Sunday morning and read acts 238 but they still won't preach it why they choose to remain silent as a matter of fact they might lose their position in the church I'd rather lose my position than Lose My Soul anybody else feel the same way and we know of course that whenever Abel by Revelation now remember God did not accept Abel's lamb before he accepted Abel God actually accept accepted the lamb because he accepted Abel you see we have it backwards when it comes to worship we think that God will accept us because I read I pray I fast I do this I do this many people think Divine Healing is given to them by merits I'm a Christian I love God God owes me healing no he doesn't the prophet said he would see it many times that Sinners would come across the platform and be healed and Christians would walk across the platform and not receive their healing why it's all about the approach The Sinner would just believe it they know they don't deserve it in the first place they know that God owes them nothing and they're just praying that God will have mercy and many of the Christians would walk across hey I'm a Christian I'm a Child of God God owes it to me even after you're a Christian God ain't obligated nothing to you or me either because it's not by our merits it's by the mercy of God so Abel then somehow God breaks open the the channel to him and when he does because he's already found favor pre sacrifice before he ever knew what to do before he ever got a lamb killed a lamb put all of the offering together he already found favor in the eyes of God and God gave him the Revelation now Cain of course did not find favor because of who he was and yet God in his Mercy offered to Cain the verse that we just read if thou doest well shalt not thou be accepted but if not sin lith at the door but if you will do well then you will be his ruler talking about Abel now I have the right to the firstborn remember firstborn rights but he said if you don't do it then sin lieth at the door the Hebrew words that Moses uses for that is just amazing and Moses the words that he chooses is like an animal crouching at the door that is waiting to attack the unsuspecting individual now God did not give Cain a revelation but God is going to accept him even if he will just worship like his brother does from head knowledge now I view things may be a little bit different than some I don't believe everybody that sits in a message church is bride that's right but I honestly believe myself lot would have been way better off to hung around Abraham and his move even though he had never been elect it's easy to see after he done what he done it was not the right move to leave all people say well you know what I don't understand what they're saying and I'm not one of them and I I'm is going to go to another church you watch yourself when you do that the way you will wind up now I want you to notice what God is offering Cain in this respect now remember what we're talking about is our right to be accepted that God tells him I will accept you on the basis of you doing it because the way was made known to your brother you don't understand it oh you say brother Don I don't understand the dress code of what you preach and I don't understand the message people have to do this and that and the other but you know what if you'll obey what God's word said God will honor you and sometimes I've seen it over the years the Revelation or strike you after your obedience brings forth fruit amen I wonder how this story would have been read differently had Kain done that thing now God know of course his choice and God knew what he would do and as we went through last Sunday to prove that God had made it known to Abel and did not make it known to Cain but look what do we find we find the old old type of the whosoever will group that can worship if they will do what God says now they're not elect they will not be in the first resurrection but there will be Millions times millions of people that will be saved that are not bride praise the Lord now look at God offering to Cain this offer and remember whenever we look at what Abel did he offered by Revelation so he knew he was going to be accepted before he ever cut that Lamb's throat how do he know that by revelation so God accepted Abel and accepted his offering the acceptance was already generated by divine revelation now notice a prophet said Abel LED his lamb Away by Grapevine sacrificed him on the Altar and Abel died on the same altar his sacrificed lamb died every believer that comes to Christ must die on the same altar with his dying lamb Christ and die in Christ to be a new creature die out to the things of the world become Born Again a new creature in Christ Jesus listen at the altar now you know the Bible goes on to tell us here in the Book of Genesis that after they' went to church and they' worshiped came uh was rejected and got angry all my his temper flared and he got so upset at God so upset at Abel and then the the Bible tells us down around verses 9 and 10 when you read it there that Cain and Abel were out in the field notice it doesn't say they were back in church so they were out in the field and Cain spoke to his brother Abel and he raised up against him and slew him so now Abel wasn't in church when he got died or when he got killed but he died on the same altar his lamb died on well how could that be if it was not the same geographical location it's the same with you and me we will never go to The Old Rugged Cross that the Lord Jesus died on that's not the Altra I'm pointing you today anyway that's not where you and I is going to die but the prophet named that altar watch this you become a new creature in Christ Jesus and die on the same altar of self sacrifice self sacrifice I don't have to go to Jerusalem and see if I could find a piece of the wood that Jesus died died on but I do have to die on the same altar self- sacrifice which a matter of fact is the hardest Altar for any of us to die many of us could offer our wife much easier than we could offer ourself we could offer our children for those of you that wouldn't hear Thursday night speaking about the question answers and brother joea got up and told about a lady that they had a arrested him and he was talking to her and she was drinking alcoholic and so on had two boys and she told Brother Joel that she would sell those boys for one beer easier to give up two boys than to deny herself that alcohol that was in one beer so is it with many many people that it's easier to give up this family member that one the other one than it is for them to die on the same altar that Jesus died on which was self-sacrifice remember Abel died on the altar with his lamb and every man that comes to Christ must die on the same altar Jesus Christ did on the altar of self- sacrifice forgiving your own ways or you say brother Donnie I've died years ago well let's just make sure shall we on forgetting your own ways forgetting your own reasons taking God's word and saying it's your word Lord I believe it and there Di and Abel he died oh notice on the rock with his same lamb that he died with what rock revelation of God's word we die out to Christ on the altars of God self sacrifice that makes me feel kind of religious to think God provided a way in that I could not save myself god making a way through Christ not by works lest any man should boast but by faith accepting it Jehovah God sending down the Holy Spirit stamping a seal on it of a confirmation sealed how long until the day of your Redemption now people think by accepting Christ as their savior that means they're born again that has been accepted for many many hundreds of years but that is not a Bible teaching Peter accepted the Lord Jesus as his savior been baptized by the Lord Jesus himself in water and yet the Lord Jesus told him when you are converted strengthen your brethren so you mean he was a saved man a baptized man but not a converted man it's easy to see he turned out to be a cussing yellow belly coward praise the Lord is that right so conversion is not accepting the Lord as your savior let me go a little further conversion is not even acknowledged that God has sent a message in the last day conversion is receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul sealing you to the day of redemption Abel offered his sacrifice and killed his sacrifice for sin then he died on the same altar with his sacrifice in order to be born again you have to die on The Altar with your sacrifice Just As Dead As He was I want you to notice if you haven't listened to this I mentioned to last Sunday it's a great parallel I love the way the prophet uses this term inside of this message that you actually become crystallized and he uses this same term to identify the Lord Jesus and also to identify the serpent on the pole so the serpent on the pole had no life there was no movement in the serpent because it was crystallized breast there was no life in the body of the Lord Jesus when he bowed his head and gave up The Ghost and he Likens you and I to the same way when we are born again so we must we must die and be just as dead as the brass serpent was and just is dead as the human body of the Lord Jesus was there was no life and yet people say I've died I've died and then they still wind up drinking lying running around that's totally impossible because if that nature ever dies there is no Resurrection to that nature no my friends you just thought you died you cannot keep your Same Spirit you cannot keep keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts you got to die you got to die like he died he got to die on his altar like Abel di with this lamb you got to die with your lamb you got to die you got to die to your own thinking and be born of his thinking so if we are all dead how come there's so many difference of opinions about the word of God all preachers are dead and all them born again how come we got sometime baptizing in titles how how come we got some baptizing in the name of Jesus how come they got so many different doctrines and yet every preacher is dead and every one of them is born of the spirit of God and show me 10 of them that preach the same thing there's something wrong somewhere now people think because they've got a change in life ohon I quit drinking praise the Lord for that I quit smoking thank the Lord for that but you don't just die to smoking you don't just die to drinking you die to your own thinking amen so you don't process the word well I know the Bible says that and I I know the prophet taught that but I don't believe it that way oh so the spirit of God Anointed The Prophet to preach certain things and preachers that say they believe this message don't feel the importance to say what he said I find that so unusual amen so I have to come down to one of two answers either you had the Holy Ghost and Malachi four Prophet didn't or he did and you don't I think I'll stick with a ladder since God never called you to be his Prophet anybody he that God called you to be for Luke 17:30 no I didn't think so so now watch how different that Cain's approach is UN Cain into his offering he had not respect and Cain was very Ross I remember there in church and they're hearing you know the word of God preached and to Ross was to be hot Furious burn become angry be kindled to heat oneself and vexation here again God did not accept the man so God would not accept the offering but it is the Fallen nature of man to want to be religious listen to this Cain wanted to be religious so he went and made his own religion and he went and did and brought it before God something like this here's the best I've got this is all I can do about it now you take it or leave it my friends if you look look at Islam you look at Hinduism taism you look at all of these religions and I I read a book many many years ago and it was where was God when Pagan religions began this man done quite a historical search and the chronology of the way false religion started it was a beautiful beautiful answer and types and how that all of these major false religions of the world followed a move of God and then when people would turn down that move of God that there was a religion which Satan raised up that they would accept instead of have you ever really looked at it even by the demographics and looking and see how that Islam affects a certain type of people you ever notied how that even the Church of Christ so-called affects a c certain type of people you also ever notice how few of them there are that ever accept the message not saying the can't because I know some that did but you notice how that each one of these religions will be able to draw a certain type of people wonder why Hinduism does not affect as many Europeans as it were those from India and Pakistan and Indonesia and some of there it's like Satan custom bit build bu and fit a religion for certain regions of the world it's like it would cater to them so then the Buddha arises on the earth and looking for a place to where you can be able to go into a state of meditation and the great Buddha oh my you know go he goes into this great thing isn't it amazing that Buddhism does not strike America isn't it amazing amazing that a Buddhism does not ex be able to express itself in the European countries but it's got something so why is it that the Anglican Church has never really took a hold in America like it has England now look at Satan he is the one who has cunningly devised all of these fake religions of the world to where people of a different demagogue and of a different place would have a religion which would cater to the own personal tastes so certain religions will go over in certain places and don't get off the ground in other places and yet it's just exactly what certain people are looking for and they will die for it they'll give their life for it but you know what God never devised his religion and said you know what now I'm going to make this certain religion for the Tri Cities area and I'm going to make it you know real unique to the Tri Cities and then them bunch of Yankees across the northern line up there in Ohio and all up through there you know what I I'm going to give them a Yankee religion I'm going to give them a Yankee version of the message you know what God don't do it that way God designs one way and you come that way or you perish so whether you're black white red yellow Mexican European knucklehead nod head whatever you are you come to God on one bis you're saved you're Sanctified you're filled with the Holy Ghost and then you are accepted as a worshiper in the body of Jesus Christ so notice Kain then he wanted to be religious isn't it amazing even with some Mormons Joseph Smith receiving the visitation y'all ever read the book of Mormon I've got one y'all ever studed on the history of the Mormons amazing certain class of people looking for a certain thing a personally enjoy talking to Mormons maybe I should rephrase that I enjoy baiting Mormons because it appears you know that there's a certain class of people that every religion will go to look at our message and you'll find out it's sad to say we're not too much much different and watch certain doctrines how it will go over in certain things someone sent me a clip the other day of a so-called message preacher standing before his congregation telling his congregation them screaming hollering carrying on awful telling them he was the Holy Ghost blasphemy come on now amen and yet it appeals to a certain group of people others this would appeal to them I'll tell you what appeals to the bride every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God you'll not live by one quote you'll not live by two quotes you live by every word that comes out of the mouth of God come on somebody say Amen to the word this morning now what but it's Cain's way and Cain's way is still very active today so what Kain does is makes a religion and formulates one and he said God this is all I'm doing I'm not giving you my heart I'm not giving you my ways I'm keeping my stubbornness I'm keeping my jealousy I'm keeping my envy and my strive this is all I'm given to you don't you ever think I'll ever worship like that Holy Roller brother of mine oh my take it or leave it God but look at God's mercy but God still loved him and he still God still loved him and he still went after him God help us I said God help us God went after him so he still believes his formal ideas holds on to his culture hold on to all the things that he wanted and yet the prophet says about Cain he was more religious that Abel was he actually done more for the Lord jump down a couple of paragraphs brothers conflict between God and Satan paragraph 68 Cain was more religious than able sure was done more for the Lord than Abel did but Abel come in the way of the word in Eden so I guess I want to ask you this question this morning do we want to just be religious or do we want to be right do we want to be just religious or brother Paul do we want to be accepted come on what do you all want you know I I I Marvel in studying the message and I love looking at question answers because I I see in there the desires of many of the people not to debate not to argue they just want to be right and I also see that among question answers among our youth had some really good questions amen and some of them are just curious some of them they just want to be right and I I was searching it yesterday where the Prophet used these words is it wrong in quotation marks it'll minimize your search when you're doing that is it wrong and where I found most of these words were used was in question and answers so he got all types of questions and I have to believe that majority of them was not people trying to trip him up and people trying to argue or something like that but just to be right and I read one of them yesterday and it was a woman that had written it and he said she said is it wrong for a woman to shave her legs and it so set brother Brandon back he said am I reading that right now you know you're saying why would anybody even ask that the bottom line it comes down to one thing we want to be accepted so what if there's something in my life or yours and that one thing would deny you of being accepted in God's presence though you do so many other good things so this person this woman that had this question she wanted to know is it wrong for women to shave their legs of course he goes on gives them the answer and tells them no but there was many questions that he was asked about similar things is it wrong to do this is it wrong to go there we were married by the justice of the peace 21 years ago was it wrong yes brother sister it was wrong marriage belongs in church but actually your vow and he goes on to explain it you know but well then he said well then if that being said does that mean they should get remarried again well he said if it bothers your faith if it hinders your faith then do it so the bottom line was still coming down to what that person feeling like that they are accepted in the presence of God there are many many people I have re-baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the Decades of my Ministry many of them was baptized correctly but yet when they would get down to pray a question would just come up you need to be rebap tized you got cold on the Lord one time and you need to get re-baptized and I have talked to so many about this same thing and they come to me brother Donnie it keeps coming to me it keeps coming to me should I do it I say if it's bothering you settle the question even though there are no scriptures that says that you got to be re-baptized if you get cold on the Lord and I told the last person I talked that to I said if I baptize everybody that just got cold on the Lord I'd never stop baptizing I'd baptized from Monday through Sunday if I'd have to take a break and then I'd said all line right up again and we just I just keep right on going on wouldn't me but if it bothers you do it somebody hearing me well I don't know why I said that but the Lord knows why I said it but you see what is the main desire that people want to be accepted listen this question brother brandham should a Christian woman wear simple jewelry as necklaces or pearls now watch again this question and no doubt my goodness as curious as many of us are it's a good thing we wasn't alive and well whenever those question questions is going on I can't imagine some of the ones I'd have submitted to him can you imagine some of the ones that we would have now after all these years of the message being around but don't you appreciate the question and answers I'm so glad the Lord the laid it on his heart to do it now watch what what is this about it's about a person wanting to know am I accepted am I accepted or does this displease the Lord if I would wear a necklace or pearls now why would anybody even have a question about it well of course because of what the Bible says and Paul wrote about it and Peter wrote about it as well and they was wanting to know what what would be there would a person be wrong would a person be displeasing the lord well sister I know this means a lot to you it means a lot for for me for you to place your confidence that I'd tell you the truth now notice it meant a lot to her and it meant a lot to brother brandham that she would Place confidence in him now remember the Bible said when you adorn that you adorn with costly pearls jewels and pearls and all kinds of wearing of jewelry but let the adorning of peace and quiet Meek Spirit which I just quoted which is a great price before the Lord now I don't mean by that sister that if you had a pen now this is me not the Lord if you had a pen that you wanted to wear or a little necklace your husband gave you maybe something like that you wore now to me I don't think that's bad now that's just remember remember I make myself clear that's my opinion and I find it so amazing that for the sisters who want to wear necklaces or pens or so on they have no problem whatsoever in taking this opinion and then they'll categorize other doctrinal things which they say is his opinion and they say they don't have to take them ah so you see what we're doing don't you picking choosing picking choosing I want I don't want who told you this was a smorgus board who told you this was a cafeteria and you go through oh I don't want broccoli I don't want asparagus I don't want collar greens I don't want I do want chocolate cake I do want chocolate pudding I do want roast beer and that's what we're doing to the message of the hour well come on somebody Hallelujah and what if those things though that we are leaving out and leaving behind are the very things that'll be required for a body change but we left them laying because we designate them as the prophet's opinion so who gave you the the opinion award who put you in charge of the opinion Department was you voted in or how did that work exactly that you can go through the message that designate to the rest of us poor Mortals that's just struggling to find the way of righteousness and Truth who appointed you as the opinion president come on man well thank you Jesus now notice what is this simple question about you sisters appreciate this question and the answers wow now notice none of your brothers though raised your hands now you know whenever Paul wrote about jewelry and things like that and when Peter wrote about it he never addressed it to any of the men whenever brother brandham answers the question he does not address it to men and as a matter of fact I've never even found a question where men ask him the question brother brandom is it okay if we wear necklaces or if we men wear bracelets or nose rings or earrings or toe rings or can you imagine Jesus with a necklace on you imagine brother brandham with one on let's bring hang on down to your local church can you imagine me and brother Daryl coming out with a necklace hanging down now watch so it's eliminated in the scripture it's eliminated in the message so apparently it's not acceptable right on oh I know it's picking up among the message among some of our boys I don't care if it is it still ain't right and it ain't acceptable you boys I'm telling you something you let our sisters Bear all the reproach of this word their hair goes out they dress in dresses it's not you boys going around in your blue jeans and your t-shirt on that looks any more strange or weird than anybody else out here but our women and our sisters bear the reproach by the way they live and some of you boys think you can go out here and look like some of these rock stars and dress yourself and blue jeans it's so tight that you can't even hardly move without sinning and you think you're accepted you compromising yellow belly coward you see I would know that women could not preach in the New Testament even if Paul hadn't directly said it that it was not allowed for them to speak in the church or that a woman should not assert authority over a man if those scriptures were totally left out I personally would know women could not preach because there are no guidlines in the New Testament for a woman Pastor now for me according to the word and every other God called man according to the Bible both in Timothy and in Titus Paul laid out the requirements for a bishop which is a pastor the requirement in both Timothy and Titus both began with the most important of all requirements and that is the man must be blameless which would knock I hate to say it but it would knock some of our Pastors in the message from out of the pull pit how can a church splitter meet that first requirement how can a man who to what the prophets say meet that first requirement of being blameless how can a troublemaking preacher ever meet that first requirement to be blameless and be a pastor he can't do it it shows the ignorance of the people that will vote such a man in Amen Brother D but you see the Bible does not say now to you women now it says about the men that they must be blameless they must be the husband of one wife that must have their children in control so the Bible gives us the requirements but if you ever notice the Bible doesn't say now to you women pastors you must be the wife of one husband or in this modern day you must be the wife of one wife bunch of perverted Hellbound denominational bastards neither does the Bible give us requirements for women deacons I'm sure there's a few women in the message that think they could handle it a lot better than men do but there's no requirement again for women deacons she shall be the wife of one husband and her husband must be in direct obedience to his wife the husband cannot openeth his mouth to his wife because she will be disqualified she must be Butch she must be Brazen she must be bold she must know how to put her hand on her hip and tell her finger and point it in them kids faith and say don't you young ones go to running in and out again or I'll take his hand and I'll warm your britches where you sat down oh me so the Bible gives no requirements for wom preachers no requirements for women deacons and the Bible does not mention where men can wear necklaces so it has no restrictions as far as saying no I men you know let it be simple pearls on I know you're laughing I know you're laughing but do you understand that in our age men have started wearing pearl necklaces don't you understand it's a sign of perversion I think it's the approach to it he say it's the way you do it it's the motive behind it and when you see it getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone yeah but I think as far as a necklace now if you go to listen to this I love brother brenham's Yale graduation that just so documented his ability don't you to bring stuff into life and just absolutely blows you away with such theological terms if you go to loading yourself up like you went through the 10 cent store with a magnet on you can imagine now a woman that's got a magnet on and she goes through the well everything's really inflated now there is no more 10 cent stores so a woman woman goes through the dollar store at Walmart and all of a sudden it just just plastered her on the face and in the ears and I mean excuse that I didn't mean to say it like that he said that's wrong 1 Timothy 2:9 but in like manner also the women are doing themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broaded hair or gold or pearls or cost the array which was the way the prostitutes did in the days of Paul right amen so they take the long Tresses of their hair remember there's one woman in the Bible who wore makeup her name was not Mary or Mary Magdalene tell me her name Jebel Jezebel Jezebel oh my so what is the question then let me finish this part here while the cross necklace has deep religious significance for many it's appeal to non-religious individuals cannot be ignored in today's society wearing a cross necklace is often more about fashion than faith it is involved into a symbol of cultural heritage Rebellion or simply an appreciation for aesthetically pleasing jewelry it's all about making a statement and standing out from the crowd so then AC cross being the symbol of suffering and the symbol of Shame and the symbol of torture and look what Satan's done Twisted it right around and make it as a symbol except Ed culturally by people who don't even believe in God pop culture plays a significant role in influencing fashion trends and cross necklaces are no exception from musicians to actors many celebrities have been spotted rocking cross necklaces and their fans are quick to follow suit ain't it amazing though for a gospel preacher to preach the real truths of the Cross people think he's hard harsh not loving understanding but a pop icon can be seen with one and people want to follow him and wear it around their neck I don't want one around my neck I want to die on mine are we really interested in pop culture are we interested in worldly Trends or are we interested in being saved now years ago to have been identified with the cross even for sisters that wore them brother bram's days it wasn't such a common thing to see him among men wasn't a common thing in the days of Paul they just didn't do it but what's doing it now pop culture and Satan wants to turned a cross into a symbol of Pop Culture don't you never let the cross become a symbol of decoration sisters those of you that even wear them don't let it become a shiny symbol when you wear that thing remember it's a symbol your lord Jesus died on that so you could die on yours sir what else will pop culture take and change will it be our Bible next they've already done marriage that way they've already done so much of the gospel and change it my god listen this their fans are quick to follow suit it's no wonder that guys want to emulate the style icons they admire and wearing a cross necklace is one way to do just that may God help us so do we want to be right or do we want to be accepted I figure as we go on in time the men around this message who really preach self-denial self-sacrifice are going to be hated more than ever before it will be The Men Who preach from arrogance and pride and self-exaltation that Satan will try to use and don't be a bit surprised if there will not be a surge in some message churches and there will be certain men of God that people will drop them like a hot potatoes we say because people need this self-imagery they're not making all these self-help books for nothing people want to be told how great they are how wonderful they are they want to be told how to make thems a God that they control their Destiny they control their looks they control who and what they are to become so people like myself many other brothers around the message that preach that you are not going to be who you want to be but if you're a bride you belong to him and you were bought with a price and you do not belong to yourself am am let B our head shall we dear Lord Jesus praise the Lord one day friends we're all going to stand before the Lord and I'm going to walk before him and give an account for every sermon I've ever preached the counsel I've give to every person you're going to walk before him and you're going to give an account for every service you've set in with your response to the word that was preached and then what you did afterwards on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday and so on we know according to the way Paul taught it that some people actually their Works will be burned annihilated destroyed but their soul will be saved but they'll have hard and no reward at all I don't know about you I want to be accepted before the Lord Jesus I believe if we are that we will actually be Vindicated in this life he wants his presence to be among us not just as a preacher but he wants you to be Vindicated as a Son of God or a daughter of God will there always be questions you see the devil we have to give him credit he does know what he's doing so he has advanced sin and things that are wrong outside of biblical terminology he has advanced sin outside of even some message terminology you don't find brother brandham preaching on certain certain things and calling you know marijuana you don't find brother Brandon using oxycodone you don't find brother brand using many of the things in this day it was not there in that day it's like they're more covered in generalities and it makes it very hard as a pastor and as a minister when you're striking sin and people ask is this wrong is that wrong is that wrong and you can search and study as much as you want and you'll never find certain words to declare it you know what you can go back to your own heart and look and see and the prophet said if there's a question in your mind why you even want to do it so young men young women of our church one day you're going to stand before the Lord and you'll walk up there before him young sisters it'll be you and Jesus not you and your mama you and your daddy or if you're a married young lady not you and your husband it won't even be you and me but you'll walk up before him and you'll give an account to the way that you dressed and if you dressed in a provocative way out on the public and you cause men to look at you and to desire you because of the way you presented yourself Lord Jesus I'll make you answer for that your brothers in the way that you've raised your homes and your families and the way you've treated your wives it's not enough just to be a well I I provide for my family I I I work hard and I bring them home money they don't always need money they need love they need attention your daughters need to know that they're loved your sons need to know that they're loved tell them let them know let them know let your wife know that you love her just as much if not more than you did when you married her 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago and a few months from me and Carol 51 years ago don't assume they know it tell them this is part of who we are that's part of denying yourself and dying on your cross or do we just want to be a a pop icon in the message and we just sing about the cross and we hang one on our mirror why you got a a cross on your reiv your mirror well the prophet did it so I do it so it just becomes a message symbol then we have one on our belt buckle some of you may have one on your Bible case I'm not against that now but my question is has it changed your Bible case your sisters that wear your cross around your neck has it made you any more in love with Jesus let's emphasize on what the cross means for us hallelujah hallelujah Lord Jesus I know these last five or six weeks it seems we moved into such a somber serious tenor it's like you're putting your word before us father and we must contemplate and decide Lord for me and my house I want to serve you I don't need another Wednesday night service or Another Sunday to make up my mind whose side I'm on Hallelujah we love you Jesus we want to do what's right Lord is a young man come up here for prayer Wednesday night and he was listening to the service and you spoke to his heart even as he was driving toward the service was there anything wrong in his life and before he ever even got to church you started dealing with him about something he need to fix that's the way we are today Lord we want to be right search US Lord God I mean like to be remembered today would you just raise your heads with me it's brother Dennis Fleer maybe some of y'all don't know him sister Sandy bagots brother-in-law he's been dealing with cancer and now he's got another situation going on in his body we're just asking God to be merciful to him today heavenly father it's written in your word they will lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover dear God you see the diagnosis that the doctors have given to him Lord they're doing everything they know to do to try to treat him then Lord these other places coming up on his body and you see how it's affected him Lord something that the doctors have just recently diagnosed and even found out about we're told in the last days that there'd be such things released on the earth that cancer would look like a toothache but Lord God no matter how many diseases they find your blood Lord Jesus atones and your stripes has already paid the price We join our faith together father in the name of Jesus would you be merciful to our brother today Father touch his body Lord in obedience to your word we lay our hands on him right now in the name of Jesus May these things leave him Lord he wants to live father he wants to live he wants to be a testimony of what God can do in the life of an individual granted I pray Lord God In The Name of Jesus thank you Lord God thank you Lord God better good see you again hallelujah how many want your cross applied in the right way not so much here not so much around your mirror I just so much on your Bible case but climbing up on that cross and dying how often brother Donnie Paul said daily it's an unusual position that we're in Jesus died once and that's all he had to die and in one sense of the word brother Jim we die once as far as the nature our nature dies and then the flesh dies daily thereafter can we stand together oh children who do we want to be our influence pop culture who do we want to influence our children movie stars basketball Stars football stars of many of them people that your kids idolize are AB absolute outright heathens live lives that's so ungodly and filthy many of them people are nowhere to be an example before our
