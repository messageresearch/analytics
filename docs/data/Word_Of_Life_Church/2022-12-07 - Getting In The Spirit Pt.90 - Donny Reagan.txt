any man love God the same is known of him the Lord has proven that in my life recently many of you heard a testimony and won't give it now now but it's not long ago brother Reagan introduced me to brother Ron Spence first time I think I thought I'd ever met him in a hotel right before he was in brother Green's meetings was a few weeks later I attended a service and became aware that I was the man that he'd been looking for for many years the Holy Spirit he spoke to him told him that incident for many times when I read that scripture this morning I realized and it's made me quite emotional that how much he loves us amen so thankful all of us I know all of us have that testimony now who can speak to a and he stand right up and walk who can cause the deaf and dumb to hear and start to talk and who can calm a fevered brow saying let it be with just a little bit of clay touch you in a way the blinded eyes didn't see I'm telling you that he can and I don't let you stand right by my

once again with all of our hearts thank you Lord God yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord looking at the life of David the way we have been the last few weeks that gives that Psalm a little different meaning since that comes from the psalm psalm 51. if you have a a Bible that includes whenever those psalms were written in verse 1 it will tell you that that Psalm was written after Nathan had visited David with this situation with Bathsheba so this man was praying oh God don't take your spirit from me restore to me the joy of my salvation and you know what God did exactly that Lord Willem will look at it this weekend at the power of repentance what a single heart can be able to do God bless you let's turn tonight I don't want to get sidetracked on that do we Revelation Chapter 19 Verse 6. I'm just happy to be here tonight anybody sad to be here nobody okay good that's good we're happy to be gathered together even if it's in the Holiday Inn amen praise the Lord Revelation 19 6. and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and there's the voice of Mighty thunderings saying halleluia for the Lord God omnipotent Rangers let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready what you notice now he doesn't call her bride hmm doesn't call her bride but calls her wife his wife has made herself ready notice again she didn't make herself life that she made herself ready we do not make ourselves bright neither can we make our family bride or anybody else bride but we can by his provision make ourselves ready look at verse 8. and to her was granted that she should be arraigned in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints that was granted unto her that she should be clothed in fine linen I love this word in the Greek whenever John chose to write this it's a different word than the Hebrew whenever they wrote in the Old Testament and it was from the purest most brilliant white linen that could be found during this time frame as a matter of fact the Lenin was so outstanding it was worth more than gold this linen was so beautiful and so brilliant and John chose that particular word to describe what his wife was dressed in let's read it again and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find Lenin clean and white clean and white you know enough about God and so do I if we're ever going to stand there like that it's going to be a provision of Grace for the fine linen now this is the key to this is the righteousness of the Saints now what's amazing is that she is never attributed to being white clean or holy catharizo is the word there which means set apart Sanctified cleansed were never identified by being that way by our righteousness why would John ever say the righteousness of the Saints because you see it's his righteousness it's given and then we take that righteousness and do the right things about it so again the word that he used here is a coupling together of the grace of God and the works of people that we do what God bids us to do and it is righteousness what is righteousness right living right living I mean a lot to be remembered tonight in prayer we've got several in our church family that are sick some with flu some of the viruses covered this that brother Tim burdette's wife sister Elaine has been diagnosed with covid and I've been in touch with him the last couple days in Texas a couple hours ago and he just responded to me a few minutes ago and he said that she's very very sick and is really concerned about her tonight and he asked me if I would mention it to you that we would be able to remember her tonight before the Lord I mean he has a need in your heart let's just pray Lord Jesus father we know that as long as we're here in this life that our bodies are susceptible to sickness and disease and germs and so many things father the Holy Ghost within our soul does not always protect us from a cold or a cough or the flu or many of these other things but Lord Jesus we have this promise that many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth them out of them all so we pray for our brothers and sisters part of our family tonight that are sick some still dealing with after effects of flu and coughing and this and that we pray that you'll be mindful of each one tonight Lord we also pray for our sister Burdette that you would move for her father We join together our faith in the promise of your word and we ask you in the name of Jesus that you would touch our sister Lord may you make her well father just from Reading brother Tim's text I could tell that he was very concerned about her but may the spirit of God go to it where she is tonight in the name of Jesus would you touch our sister and make her well father add the blessings to your word tonight help me that I can be able to get out of the way speak to us those things which will be beneficial to us tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus we ask it and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated this is certainly a wonderful passage of scripture that we're looking forward to with all of our hearts to come to pass in our day marriage and betrothal and dispousal such a beautiful thing especially in the scripture with our Western Civilization we have so marred and changed it from what God intended for it to be but whenever it was actually this was written in the days of John it was still a carryover from the Old Testament and on up through the new to whether that an engagement was a very special saying betrayals all his spousal and it was a sacred thing to them they didn't just look at it as a girl running away from home trying to get away from her mom and dad they didn't look at it as a man and a woman meeting and them running out and doing whatever they wanted to that was not allowed they didn't do it that way as a matter of fact a girl could not just join together and run off of the boy and agree to be married it was not absolutely even lawful and they're that their day to do it but they looked at it as emerging of families emerging of goals emerging of objectives emerging many times it was for financial gain of course but many times it was not and we can send the days of Solomon how that Solomon did so he married one of the daughters of pharaoh married one of the daughters of different kingdoms and it was to establish his kingdom on the North side on the west side on the south side and there were political marriages then just have to have been down Through the Ages but for the Believers it was something that was very sacred and it was something that they really looked to and honor so for them to be able to write about the marriage of the lamb in the New Testament it took on a brand new view just from the Old Testament view of what they thought about it and you remember whenever Joseph had found out that Mary's was expecting with child and he was going to put her away but he did not want to do it in an open way but he was going to put her away privately lest it would bring shame upon her and the angel of the Lord had to appear to him and said fear not Joseph thou son of David to take into thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and He commands him to go ahead and take her and to be this Shield as it was for Mary and for the baby that was to come because the way they looked at it she had lived so unclean and his eyes and God had to supernaturally be able to Enlighten him and what had taken place so then John this was his background now the reason I say that is so that we might be able to understand it a little bit better because what marriage is today well it's certainly degraded to what it was them that a person would marry a pizza or a man would marry his hot rod or a woman would marry her cat I read not long ago where some rich multi-millionaire had given millions and millions of dollars to her dog so her dog lived in a castle her dog lived and and this great palace and it was absolutely phenomenal just looking at the pictures that I saw of it and the dog had servants and butlers and maids and so on and so on and so on I'm not sure exactly how that he told him what he wanted woof woof meant dog food wow wow meant cat food I'm not sure exactly how they worked all that out but I thought that person will stand before almighty God one day and not only be judged for a sinful life but also be judged for giving all that kind of money to an animal that don't even have a soul but that's where we are so people that have so degraded that a man would want to marry a man a woman to want to marry a woman or they'd want to marry they're not even sure what they are anymore they're just still trying to figure it out out I guess but so living in that age if we're not careful our very image of marriage will become tainted by the filth that is around us but keep in your mind marriage is the oldest institution in the world given to us by almighty God himself so when we look at marriage and we join together a young couple we do not look at it as the run-of-the-mill type of thing no to us it is still a sacred thing and then we go beyond that and then we look to this marriage now we've just closed down in Revelation chapter 18 and how the Harlot is judged and how that the great city of Rome has been destroyed and I find it still phenomenal that John would go from the destruction of Rome by an atomic bomb and then he tells the Heavens to rejoice as we looked at last Wednesday and then he jumps from that immediately the scene opens again and it opens with this salutation let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the Lamb has come now the word there is a tricky word because some in reading this and they take the word gamos and they think that the bride God is not actually married until we reach the Heavenly setting and I used to think exactly the same thing but under the influence of the message of the hour you realize that God completely changes our view about when we are truly married now years and years ago whenever brother Branham would have preached this message entitled The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ no doubt a lot of the Pentecostals that were there which is where I got my previous View from they probably felt like that brother random was totally wrong by saying that the bride had already entered into an invisible Union right now so the many many people still to this day preach and promote that the wedding will take place in heaven but if you notice the way that John writes this and the word that he uses there's a key word to this verse which illuminates us that the the bride has actually already been wet now watch this let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come now the word that he uses there is gamos and it means a wedding or a marriage Festival so it's not actually a wedding ceremony but it is a wedding or a marriage Festival what is it it is the marriage supper of the Lamb so it is a Divine banquet that God has now spread forth for his people so John is not now saying let us be glad and rejoice because the lamb has now married his wife actually they were already married on the earth in an invisible Union of a marriage vow performed by the ministry of Malachi 4. you see it but through the uniting according to what the prophet told us and proving his word it was a uniting time that was going on by Christ the son of man coming down and this is why of course even many of the people around the message they still don't understand the significance of us preaching the message we've got an element of people that say they believe the message yet They Don't Preach the message they don't talk about the prophet they don't talk and preach from the message itself you'd be surprised at how many message churches do not welcome you as a preacher to read message quotes well let me just let you know where I stand if I cannot preach what the prophet said I wouldn't feel welcome in the first place now that may that may just stun some of you to think that there are so-called message people that don't want the message preached I don't understand that myself why in the world would God send a prophet with a message and then not want that message preached to the followers of the message it don't make a lot of sense to me I know I'm not very smart but I'm smarter than that you know Paul told Timothy whenever he wrote to him he said now be not ashamed of the Gospel nor be ashamed of me his prisoner I don't believe that Paul had wrote his word as his own opinion but I believe it was the word of God so what has happened to us I hope you understand that what is going on in this setting right now on this last day is that we are being united to Christ the lamb as the word is being preached so how is that happening as we hear him the word Christ being preached it severs us from the ties that we held formally you see that's why it's important that we let go of preconceived ideas of predestination and election and the calling of God and the difference between the bride and the church as we let go of this we are being united to what the new anointed word which is Christ himself we're not being anointed to a Dogma or to a Creed or well we're becoming brandomats no that's not what brother Branham wanted he did not want us to just go around quoting him and all belong to the Branham Tabernacle he wanted us to be so in love with the Lord Jesus and if this message does not make you love the Lord Jesus more than you have missed the meaning of this message in the first place well praise the Lord this God sent this Prophet that it would help us now look friend I know for many of you maybe it was the Miracles that you heard and brother Randomness Minister I realized there was an element of people in the message and they come from secular denominations and they were taught God was dead God didn't do any of that anymore and whenever you first heard about the Miracles that's what caught your attention it was not mine okay it was not mine that was not what caught my attention or hey or many of us that was in Pentecost I had already seen Miracles I had seen discernment I had seen wonders I'd seen the blinded eyes come open I saw a dead baby raised One Night in the service I've seen crossed eyes uncrossed miraculously by the power of God I saw one Miracle after another after another after another it was not the Miracles that caught my attention when I started hearing this message one of the greatest things was how we preached the Lord Jesus and by how he talked to the Lord Jesus he talked to him in a way that I had never heard anybody talk to him before how many knows what I'm talking about it's just the way he addressed him and the way that he set him for us and the way that he projected the personality of God in a way that I I just never comprehended it before and as I listened it began to change my view of the Lord Jesus just not the doctrine of serpent seed and the doctrine of election and the doctrine of predestination but it began to reshape the way I looked at almighty God and I hope you understand what I'm going to say I'm continuously as I feed on the message of the hour my view and my my perspective of the almighty is constantly being altered as I listen to more and more of the message Harry sent me a quote today in this quote brother Randolph said it would be a great thing if God would perfectly make him well if he was sick and God had performed a miracle but he said it would actually be greater if God would reveal to him about Divine Healing and he would take God's word and believe God's word and confess that word every every day and and God would be healing him every day and I thought isn't that amazing but most of us would probably believe the opposite of that we would believe that a miracle would be greater isn't it amazing how we can still believe things wrong but if you look at it from his perspective and what he was saying was that the lord loves when people will take his word and they will believe that word some days they may do good and the other days they may be brought in battle with the symptoms of what they're believing God for but they still believe God is their healer no matter how they feel but you realize an instantaneous Miracle it doesn't take a great prolonged faith it drops in your heart God does it right there and it's over but a person believing for Divine Healing it may be up and down and in and out they may be years of fighting that battle of Divine Healing but they don't give up they keep trusting God now when I hear something like that what that does it again Alters my perspective and my view of the almighty because I look and I think wow there's something about his character that he loves to hear his children take his word and they believe that word through thick and thin ups and downs in and out light and darkness whatever and that does something so much to his being toward them that it moves them and it helps me and it Alters my view then the more my view is altered about him the closer I can become to him you understand that those of you that's been married for 10 or 50 15 or 20 years however long it's been and if you and your wife are really true and joined together you know that the longer you're together the more you begin to think alike and the more that you'll begin to say things that are like one another some of y'all know in your head is that right well because it's the way that you're joined together and you begin to think a lot me and Carol do it absolutely all the time and say where you want to go we just said so and so I said that's exactly what I was thinking she said we need to do so and so I said I was going to tell you exactly the same thing so we've been together now for all of these years and the more we're together the more we understand one another now when you're married and you're young you think the most important thing is you getting your way and whenever you get into an argument of course now I'm preaching to these sorry Sinners that are streaming the service tonight but whenever you get into an argument you think well the most important things is you being able to have the life saved and you being able to say something that'll burn him up or burn her up and boy you think that's it you think you've already accomplished something but the longer you're married the more you realize that peace has much more value than proving that you're right well Hallelujah Tranquility in the home and peace and all of that it's a great thing so what are you doing you're learning what the real proper values are well the more we learn about our Lord and the more we learn about what he wants and what he dislikes well the more we're learning about his nature can't you see this is another reason why the food is Virgin the church cannot be married to him because they don't understand his personality first of all they divided him into three and made three Gods out of him and you certainly couldn't walk up and whenever you're going to walk up and think you're going to be married to three and John looked on the throne and only saw one you know you don't know who you're even marrying you don't know who your husband is you don't know anything about him so God begins to reveal himself and as he does as you would hang around a young boy or a young girl and you was around them more and more and you fall in love as we say and you begin to understand more of who they are and what they are well it's the same way with the word now here John is going to address this and he's says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage or the marriage supper of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready so all of Heaven is given this this consultation to be able to rejoice and that they should be glad now I want you to notice that the bride is not invited to her own wedding so this is not directed to her but this is to another group of people this of course is one of the common errors that's been believed for many many years from the Old Testament but especially in the new whenever God began to project his grace and spread it over the entirety of the human race that people looked at the grace of God been given to the recipients on the earth and they looked at everybody as being exactly the same then that God does not have differentiation because of election and they think now truly as far as receiving salvation and Grace there's no rich ones Among Us no Smart Ones no dumb ones all that sort of thing but they failed to realize that God even under Grace has categories by which he reveals himself too and this is one of them tonight and that is the difference between the bride and the church so there will be guests that will be there that will no doubt be people of the Old Testament now remember in the new Earth there will also be the categories because God imperfection created these great Angelic hosts so there were cherubims there were seraphims there were zoons and he created ones which could fall once which could not fall he created some angels which had a beginning and some actually that rotated off of his being as we would say that were as Eternal as he himself was which is where you come from now because the work of God Is So Glorious he will actually unveil this by his own character again the more we learn about his character don't think I'm trying to complex him now and make it complicated for you but the more more you understand about him the more you can fall in love with him which is all this whole thing is all about now once it will be by his greatness and by his power and John said for the marriage of the Lamb is come now the church all of Heaven is now rejoicing because the bride has been resurrected up of course those have been that have been alive or changed those of our dead have been resurrected and the heavens is now starting to enter in what this is doing it's starting in the preview of the day of the Lord now the day of the Lord is a very common theme in the Old Testament prophesied by Isaiah prophesied by Obadiah prophesied by many of the prophets and we'll get into it a little later but they talked about a day that would come when the Lord would Usher it in but it comes strangely God ushers this day of the Lord in by wraths and judgment and destruction which of course was not in the dispensation of Grace now it was called of course and has been for two thousand years the day of man we are living in the day of man man's Wisdom men's technology man this man's religion man's government but this is not the day of the Lord the day of the Lord will be when the days of man have come to their end and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ then it will usher in the day of the Lord now we're just a couple of verses away from the ushering end of the day of the Lord but the day of the Lord cannot come until the marriage situation is right in heaven so the bride is being anointed on the earth and they have been in every age since the gospel began 2000 years ago so the elect of God were United to Christ the word of their day by hearing the word now this is why the devil hates for you and I to hear the word and then become part of what we're hearing this is why thoughts of preachers this is why Fox the preachers themselves because he knows let the people along just let them stay home let them not go to church he knows they'll die the prophet tells them over and over again even people that got saved he said get you a home Church find you a Godly Pastor that'll preach you the truth he said you'll dry up and die if you don't do it well come on that's what he said he knows the value and the importance of it and as you hear you're corrected of course some Services you just feel his love all around you other services you know God cause controls it of course according to what we need and Satan knows that and Satan has done his very best for 2 000 years to break that Unity between Christ and his bride but he's failed to do so and he will fail to do so in this age as well so what is God now doing God is now calling for the Heavens to Rejoice because the bride is in heaven the marriage supper of the Lamb the table has been set and now the church has overcome now watch her Union was her glorious Lord is a reflection of his own Glory himself and gentleman on to say that his wife has made herself ready now she's joined together in an interrupted uninterrupted perfect union which was in God's mind before the foundation of the world from this point joining up in the rapture we will may never be separate again now let's look in verse 8 and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints watch in Revelation 3 4. now this symbolism of course is used in various places in the scripture thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy now again the sardisian church Overcomers they are identified as being quote in white garments now what a contrast this is to the woman that we saw in Revelation 17 and to the same colors carried over into Revelation 18 so it's called Scarlet which calls purple and we saw all them colors which identified on The Prostitute church but when John sees the bride in heaven he does not say Scarlet he does not see purple he does not identify her with gold or silver or even pearls but he identifies her by one color which is the original color now she's been brought back the color she's wearing proves her soul has come back to its original place she has now been restored to the original salt of God Remember When God Made made the first woman even brought her on the earth and she was God's perfect thought of what a woman ought to be And yet when God brought her into existence of the earth she actually never materialized into that perfect thought because had she been that perfect thought she would have never fallen from that thought but she manifested only partially of what God wanted her to be she was beautiful of course in that state and she loved her husband and everything was fine so what happened then to that thought God can never lose a thought and God can never have a new thought so what happened to that thought that God had this perfect thought about what a woman would be well if he had that thought there's got to be someone or may I say many someone's who will manifest I thought what was that thought a woman that would love her husband a woman that would be subject to the word a woman that would never die a woman that would have eternal life this was all what made up God's thought of a perfect woman and yet Eve was never able to fully manifest that perfect thought what happened to that thought well I believe it's sort of like the thought of Isaiah 7 14 when the prophet said that the prophet Isaiah spoke it and it's like it circled the Earth circle the Earth waiting for the time and the season by which one would be able to catch that word and a virgin was on the earth and it went into her womb and she called that and manifested that so where is God's perfect thought of a woman I believe it has been circling as we'd say the Earth may be again and the cycle of Eternity God waiting for a perfect woman who is it this woman here in Revelation 19. she will stand before him as that perfect thought of a woman she was tested she was try she was born lost she was born unregenerated she was born horrible she was born and come to the Earth and then after she was here for some for 15 16 years they started becoming defiled by humanity and they were scarred with all types of things and seemed like but they would have never been able to amount to anything and yet the mercy of God reached down through him and brought him through all of that trauma all of their past all of the things that they'd been through able to wash them by the water of the word and be able to present them to the Lamb of God as they walk into that manifestation of a perfect thought of a woman oh my don't you want to be that before God now Paul says then that whenever himself was liking that notice John talks about this group here in Revelation 3. so the bridal attire I'm sure your sisters I've noticed this before in reading them that in the newspapers whenever they would put it in there about John domain you know Mary whoever her name was and she become married though and one of the things that they will emphasize in that is what what the bride wore isn't it amazing that they very rarely mentioned that the that the bridegroom had on a black tux well done most of them so they have on the black tux and they had you know this cumberbund on and and the preacher had on these black cufflinks and they they you know they don't even go that way but what did they describe the bride the bride had on this dress and this lace and you sisters know more about that me than I would so they had the bride wore this and the bride wore that well look John saying true to form that John now that the wedding has been consummated and they've come in and they've have had this time so John begins to describe the bride's attire now he does not start at the top of this beautiful Tiara and start coming down you know it says this type of lace and this and that and the other but he sums up the whole thing and this beautiful portrayal of the original color of why so alter the scripture this has identified this way and this to the bride I love the way John writes for he says it was given to her or granted it was granted unto her and the same word thy means given and I love the way Paul says this in Philippians 3 9 being in found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the face of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith now see as a True Believer when we obey God's word then the very righteousness of God is attributed to us as it was to Abra Abraham of the Old Testament so Abraham believed God and God imputed it unto him for righteousness now the blood in the Old Testament could not be countered as righteousness but what was his face his faith now I hope you don't misunderstand me one day when we walk into that Heavenly realm we will no longer need faith we will no longer need the blood of the Lord Jesus we will no longer need a veil between us and God we will no longer listen carefully we will no longer need prayer we will no longer need preachers but God will save some I'm sure as the world we will no longer need people confessing the word thy strap some Hill buy Stripes I'm delivered there'll be no confessing going on in heaven there'll be nobody that'll ever need a prayer line no preachers will ever stand up and take a text now tonight I'd like to preach on there won't be none of that there nobody will have to believe God by faith because faith will be transformed into sight listen so faith will be transformed into sight and the Very person of God will be manifested in his human Temple setting on the throne of God and the father will be this great excellent Glory that is the emanating from that that human body that will be the father of God so this is what we will come up and approach this is what we will touch it will be God's human Temple and there will be no need of these things that we have now because we would have reached that state of perfection all hasten the day Lord Jesus notice this so the double nature of this process it was given to her by the power of God but then she takes what God gave her and she translates that into a life that is lived every day by the word and that's why we quote the prophet in the church church age book saying that a life lived by the word is the word express but if a person tried to live it without the attribute of righteousness being in them what are that that is just filthy rags so a person could stop cutting their hair say it's a woman and men could stop wearing um you know whatever it is that would be worldly and they could stop drinking and stop smoking many people can do that whenever the doctor gives them a bad report said if you don't quit smoking it's going to kill him they'll say all right I'm quitting but if you're not born again that's still not righteousness so we would look and would see our sisters with dresses on and with long hair and we don't see no makeup on them and all that sort of thing and we said well praise the Lord that's righteousness all only if it's righteousness from the soul and working out on their manifestation in their body now if it's just on the outside they are no more than Amish Mennonite Hutterites right because it's not actually righteousness from the inside out they're just being made to do that until they reach the age of 18 and then they're going to do what they want to do but if it's revealed to them then by the spirit of God they put this on and they are being clothed now do you understand what you're doing every day when you live right you do right you talk right you don't cheat you don't lie and you live a Godly life you understand that you are already putting on the garments of righteousness in this world and the body change will only be a further advancement of what you're already wearing right here tonight how many is live right today how many is water today how many is done right oh sure you've made your mistakes and all that so what have you done you have put on the righteousness of God and then you let that righteousness of God manifest itself in your daily works this very day here we are on Wednesday night so it's been a few days since you've had service and brother Andrew preached that great sermon for us so try Hope by the grace of God that on Monday morning Tuesday morning Wednesday morning I'm starting tomorrow again you'll resume that same thing what will you do you'll act like a Christian talk like a Christian live like a Christian why you are a Christian so it ain't something that you put on on Wednesday night like you put on a suit man you know here you go y'all wouldn't want me to come to church the way I was dressed this morning about 6 30. I'm going over to the church and putting on some stain and some sealer and this and that I got an old pair of blue jeans that had stain here had a black mark over there and a hat on dirty shoes and had on an old shirt that had staying here and there if I would have walked out of there tonight you'd looked at me and say what in the world's wrong my brother Donnie well them clothes are very appropriate for staining and all that sort of thing but you know I really wouldn't want to preach in them so it's the same way whenever we become converted and changed that we take off the worldly garments that we're born in and we put on a robe of righteousness by the new birth and then we start acting different we start talking talking different Heaven is only the consummation of that work which has already started in us and on display right now you know I've got a strange religion I take it with me on vacation I've got a strange religion I'll still live right on Monday I've got a strange religion I believe it ought to be 365 days a year I know yeah on that 366 on leap year I think y'all to live right when you're by yourself when you're with your family when your wife's present when your wife ain't present I think y'all to live right why because David said I put him ever before me and if you realize you're in his present it'll keep you off of websites you shouldn't look at it'll keep you from saying things you shouldn't say well I wish somebody preached with me tonight it'll keep you from doing things you shouldn't do because it's already on display by the grace of God whoo wow wasn't that good thank you Lord now watch this in Revelation 19 9 and you say us unto me right wow so here comes this voice and it's like he interrupts John's on a roll and now he wants him to take special heed to this right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb now this is not necessarily the bride because the bride's not invited to her own wedding she's not invited to her own reception she's already been invited so this will be guest Old Testament New Testament however God will merge them all together and he says they're even blessed just to be at the reception well if they're blessed to sit at the table can you imagine how blessed you're going to be when you're going to be the one that's being honored notice blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the land now the angel who is commanding John to do this actually commands him to record this beatitude of remember the Beatitudes of course of the Lord Jesus when he gave them that in the Book of Matthew but there's many more also down through the scripture and this is some of the last ones so he identifies this as another beatitude of those that are blessed they're just invited to be able to be there but of course they have a Heavenly invitation so one of the things that has plagued the church as I said coming down to the ages has been people not being able to recognize and this is why there's been such a differentiation in between people who believe that the church would go through tribulation which I used to believe and then others say no no no the church can't go through the tribulation ain't no way that goes through a tribulation and there's still that great debate today so they take their scriptures and preach there will be a post-tribulation others a pre-tribulation and they provide back and forth back and forth and the mystery and the answer is not who's got the most scriptures on their side but the answer is finding out there's a difference in the class of peoples either under the dispensation of Grace now notice these are blessed that are invited to the marriage supper but these folks aren't actually the bride well praise the Lord now you see those are distinguished down through time it was a lot and an Abraham a Jacob and an Esau from the Old Testament we can say it as it converges right on up to the New Testament we see a gamalia we see people that help the people of God and they love the Lord we see a King Herod Who Loved John the Baptist absolutely loved John the Baptist but he could never obey what John the Baptist said and yet this man risked his own reputation because of his love and honor for John even made his old Jezebel wife mad about it because he loved the prophet but it ain't enough to love the prophet if you really love him right you'll do what he said do so you see it's a perfect type of those who just love the prophet and there's no way that he would have ever allowed John the Baptist to be killed if they had not have tricked him into it you remember the story and he loved John so much and had so much respect for him so just because people around the message loved the prophet don't mean that their bride well go ahead and preach brother Donnie I knew Pentecostal people I try to come to the message and started hearing about the message and I used to work for a certain preacher and I did his radio broadcast and I remember setting and His Radio broadcast room and there was a desk and a chair there and a microphone and I would do the intro and the outro of his broadcast and I would come in and I would say this is such and such and so and so and we're now going to introduce you into the man of God as he's going to preach so I would do that and preach about or let him preach about 12 13 minutes something like that and then I would do the outro and I'd say now we're going to be here and here and here and here well one day as I was sitting there and I was listening for the sermon you know and he was he was preaching and I happen to reach up here right above my head and there were some books well for whatever reason I'd never looked at them books before but I as I pulled one of those books off of the shelf and I opened it up ah to my great surprise guess who that book was William Marion Brenham oh my the theme song of this man was he was more than a man and that was his main sermon Jesus is more than a man my I've set behind him many a time you can find it on on YouTube if you'd like to look at it I'm so there's a young fella and he was oh Jesus as a man stepped to the bow of the ship and he spoke to the wind Jesus as a man woke up and rubbed the sleep out of his eye or I've screamed before thousands of people as he would preach this oh my God hollered and jumped and run little did I know he got that from a little Prophet oh yeah how many have went and pulled from The Prophet's words I used to remember a certain other preacher from down in Yeager West Virginia and I heard him preach on Ruth and about Ruth's believing in all the four states there's nothing where in the world did he get that at and I knew another man they lived pretty close to where we were for her and now we're raised born and raised and I'd hear him preach and I would watch him he said pray for people and I'd watch him and said weak and staggering that you know lead him off the platform saying well man where in the world but if I found what was amazing was when I come to the message I found a lot of the stuff they was doing and saying come inside of the from there and and then I found out once they found out I knew where it come from they didn't want me to find it out so what did they do they separated themselves from me because they knew I'd tell they knew I'd tell they was not getting that on their own I'm not ashamed to tell you tonight A lot of the stuff I preached to you it ain't original it don't come to me first it comes through the channel of Malachi 4. and if you got a problem with that you got a problem with God oh praise the Lord you see God has this program and you know I love the way brother random says it in spoken words Original Seed you can only serve God on Earth as God's servants sin on the earth interpret God's word to you so you can see why Satan wants to break that Divine protocol of the way God does it he's always done it this way and he will continue to do so to the end time so we know there's an element of people that'll never hear this message and there's an element of people that will hear it and they will follow along remember in the very type whenever Eliezer was sent to get Rebecca and he brought Rebecca out and the Bible also says Rebecca followed the man but her maidens also followed along right with her here goes Ali is there telling her all the things about her husband to be telling her what he looks like what kind of man he is how much riches and wealth and so on and so on that he has and those maidens are falling right along here in the messenger talk to message but did them maintenance jump off of the camel and go into the tent to be married to Isaac they did not are there foolish virgins around this message they are are there foolish virgins out here in the world they are but brother Donnie well they all fit I don't have an idea and you don't either but I'm so glad almighty God knows where everybody fits and there will be people that will be in heaven that more than likely will shock us to death when we look around and say you've got to be kidding you made it and you know well you got to be king you made it and then you look in the mirror and say glory to God you mean I made it mother Grace said God I thought oh some of you I know you're so conceited to yourself ain't no question you're mine you're going well the rest of us knows it'll be the grace of God if we get there I'm just telling you tonight it'll be the grace of God if I make it but I'm going to make it because I love grace and grace has been applied to my life so God is now beckoning and he's opening up even right here to show us there's a difference between the bride and the guest so in the New Testament the whole program of God will set forth in such a way as well as the Old Testament so here it's not so much the question of difference of salvation but it's the difference of positioning in the body just like God calls in evangelist a pastor or a teacher and all of God's gifts are so different we know that they can hear Brother Darryl preach is different than brother Andrew but the Andrew preaches and other men and each one has to find the way God has made them and if they know who they are and they find in that then there should be no jealousy Among Us same way with singers same as the musicians and everything else and the program of God is exactly the same way I want you to notice now John goes from verse 9. to verse 10. and I fell at his feet to worship Him wow so John sees the church he sees the he sees the atomic bomb he sees the wedding supper and John is so overwhelmed that he falls before this being to worship Him wow y'all ain't been this quiet now since I don't know how now John is overwhelmed now remember John has not changed John's not in a word body yet this is a vision so in the vision it shows how that the recipient of the vision can be wrong I hope this don't stagger you but this being was not an angel with wings on his back it was a redeemed human being foreign now listen John said I fell at his feet to worship Him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren now an angel could not say this this is not an angel a cherubim a seraphim a zoom this is a redeemed human being do you understand that it was a redeemed human being that showed John the entire Book of Revelation oh come on children that's a quote from the message huh now look he is so overwhelmed by being in this Vision ma the man has seen all of these great things and I mean who knows what it was but let me just clue you in this happened twice John does it here and he gets so overwhelmed again he does it again in Revelation 22. I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus so this was not an Old Testament Prophet then it was a new testament one now listen what he says it gives him a great Revelation here for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy now this angel man which was guiding him and revealing these great things John is so overwhelmed not just by the personage of this man but all that he's seen he's just he's just beside himself look at me again in revelation 22 8. and now John saw these things and heard them and when I heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things didn't say anything unto me see thou doeth not I mean here the man is doing it again well praise the Lord you say how us human beings are and you think you don't need Grace after you got Grace this man needed the mercy of God look what he has done he has just fell down and worshiped an angel a man a messenger that has been redeemed but there must have been such Shekinah and so much of the glory of God coming here he was just overwhelmed he's just so overwhelmed and he just gets beside himself just beside himself in the vision and he just falls down to worship this being now notice again it happens again I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things now during this whole Revelation on this isle of Patmos it's been this Angel this redeemed being then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thou fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets so now he gives a little further identity of who he is he was a new testament redeemed prophet and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God well I hope you and I maybe could be a little bit more merciful when people who were overwhelmed in the presence of God or maybe in the presence of one of his Prophet Messengers and they would begin to sink in their mind it's the Lord Jesus this might help us to be a little bit more understanding now I always for whatever reason I get attacked by a lot of these folks that don't believe the message no more and they like to have my email address and share it and to be able to attack me you know in one email after another after another and tell us how wrong we are and on and on and on with our garbage so one way that I I like to answer them back is I'll tell you what when your wife your children and the people you work with mistake you for the Lord Jesus I'll fly you down to the Tri-Cities airport and then we'll sit and talk but until they do I'm going to keep following this man that they did well praise the Lord now some of you that want to dissect a message and say well this is Brother Ram's opinion that's brother Ram's opinion you want to the things you don't believe that's the way you want to get out of of obeying it I'll I'll tell you exactly the same thing uh for as any of your sons ever thought you was the Lord Jesus what about some of the people you go to church with what about your life all I see she might think you might be that other guy so she don't see the pillar of fire over your head it's horns now you know humans can I say I understand this no I I can't I've never seen this out of any man okay I I wasn't around brother random never got to be there never got the scene of the meetings I've been around Servants of God yes my whole life I've been around men of God that I've seen the anointing on them and and I was afraid because you could fear that feel that awesome thing and it it produced this austure fear doesn't it brother just being around being with around Servants of God watched them so anointed by the presence of the Lord and it makes that but if I ever felt this I haven't so it's hard for me to relate to John doing this now I could of course like you take the theological aside say John you ought to know better than that you look at here John I'll tell you one thing you should have known that was an angel you don't seem the Lord Jesus how in the world but you see I'm a man speaking without this type of experience so I don't know exactly what all John had succumbed to being in this atmosphere and being in this presence so whenever I hear the prophet tell us in Revelation chapter 5 part 2 I think it is that he says there's a dozen or more people sitting here in this building today that thought I was Jesus Christ now you and I might hear that quote or read it and we'd say well a bunch of knot heads what in the world is the matter with sin and there again you and I was not in that aura of that presence now I've talked to people who were and they talked about how powerful that it was and how moving that it was oh my and how that that Prophet won't even break into that realm tell you your very thoughts the very things you had prayed about tell you this and that and the other and you think it must have been an awesome thing to experience but now John is carried up in the realm of vision so it's not standing at a store and I asked brother Charlie Cox one time I said brother Charlie how how was it being around brother Bradham how was he said whatever they don't even you know you've been around brother random and he said we never pulled on him we never tried to pull him into explaining this and asking him all kinds of questions and he said we just let him talk he said that he would always go to the word and he brother Charlie Drew drove out a little box and and it was writings of brother Branham and it was all types of drawings of this and that and the other and he said don't ever they'd get done eating supper at night that brother random would get a piece of paper and he'd sit there and draw the rainbow and draw this and that and the other brothers Jordan still had him as a matter of fact he had a squirrel that they had shot in 1958 put in a carton a milk jug and it was froze in the freezer and it was still there and he pulled it out and showed it to me the squirrels which was created by the spoken word they were created that morning they skin them that evening and ate them for supper so I said well how how was it when the people got around it he said we'd walk in them Country Stores brother Raymond have blood on his clothes his beard would be growed out and he just talked to them guys and ask them about their crops and if there's a if there's a car salesman they'd ask him about that he never told him his Malachi 4 never told him he was Elijah but they always knew there was something random because he said could you always sense that presence of being around him now this was a man that was honey can you imagine now John being carried out into the heavens and he saw this glorified person I hope you understand what I'm fixing to say one day the angels of God one day the foolish virgin which come up through the final stage of their Redemption they will stand there in this all of you I know it's hard for you to view yourself in this way but what I see Harry when I look at this human being I see a human being that was prefigured in the body change a human being which had entered into that Final Phase of God's glory and it was of such high esteem and such Glory that a prophet like John a prophet of John's caliber since this Effigy Of The Glory of God emanating from this person and it was so close to God himself I hope you understand me what happened to this redeemed human being he had entered into this stage of deity that he had come from in the beginning you see what we have received in our soul by the Holy Ghost truly is deity but it's so marred by our Humanity you see this is why we struggle with one another it's because the the human weakness of us all in our failures and our faults if we could ever appeal back beyond all of that and see what lives inside of your soul what would you see that little spot of deity but no doubt what John is seeing is the human part of this redeemed Elder Soul pulled back but he's not seeing his weakness his flaws his Humanity but he's seeing him in this Oh Glory to God and this post-figure of a redeemed Son of God standing there in a glorified body in so much that God would share the revelation of his word with this being and what happened to this person they were actually pulled back into the stage of deity which they come from oh I know you don't remember the and I don't either but before we come to this earth we were a part of Elohim we were a part of him it's further back than what our minds can go back to because we did not pre-exist I said human we did not pre-exist as a mortal there but we were in his mind we do not believe in pre-existence of souls the way the Mormon says that's right but we do believe that we dwelt in his mind and where do we come from we came from that great Elohim there's only one source of eternal life and that's him and this being had been so brought back into that tithe that John has now been been Associated and been hanging around this being which has been brought back into deity what does deity do what does deity do it demands worship and the person this person was so brought back into the deity of God that John falls down before him he's overwhelmed am I taking up for him no of course not but you can see looking at him this way you can see why a person would do it because his presence will become so great and so overwhelming that you just want to worship well I don't mind telling you I want us as the people of God I want us and our services to want him so much that he will come Among Us in a way like we have never seen him before and not that we bow before one another but we bow before him that we are so overwhelmed by his presence that when we are enter into those courts into that August courts of God and we enter into his courts with praise that we know he's sown there you've been in services and so have I joined the presence of God but so overwhelming you just see people bowed down with their chair or they get down on their face of their niece what is it it's something about deity when it's revealed in such a high Persona of God that it makes the human receiver want to worship God what does it make them want to do it makes him want to Bow and there's Humanity to the glory of God can you imagine a human being being brought so into the deity of God that another mortal would bow before them foreign Hallelujah let me just give you now a preview so after John Falls to worship then the angel tells him not to do it listen to the very next verse and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse isn't it amazing that God understands John's overwhelming experience and he doesn't stop the vision and he doesn't punish him but he simply changes the scene they the being tells John not to worship so John corrects the error and the vision continues on what to now the breaking of the day of the Lord and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness does he judge and make war oh let's just pray Lord God just talking about this great presence oh Jesus how we long for that day when we will be called into it Lord many of us have experienced you as since we were little children without your presence but Lord we all know there's more and Lord there's been times that I've felt is so great I thought it would take my breaths I thought I can't take it no more Lord God whenever we once get back into that place where we came from but when we came from that we left it in attribute form but when we go back we will be an expressed form in a three-fold expression Soul see Gene theophany glorified body so when John is dealing with this being it's like it's post-change this being is so like God even though he was a redeemed mortal John Falls before him oh what awaits us Lord no wonder John said it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is Lord it isn't just young men and young women you want us to become you want us to enter into that Shekinah Hallelujah we can only understand it father that when the foolish virgin type come into the city in the Eighth Day they're not just coming to see you they're not just coming to see the city but they're coming to see us because no doubt this will be part of what they will talk about out in the new Earth for eternity we will be learning about you and talking about you and you will be revealing to us the city inhabitants a level about you that the others are not supposed to hear but they will be hearing in their called degree as they did here in life Hallelujah and when they come in and they start walking up that Ascent of that beautiful pyramid-shaped city and they go to seeing us and they will bow their heads as it were and they will see human beings that they have been told by what's been told them on the outside of the city that that you're going to go in this is your first time to make the visit of the city you're going to see the great king seated there on the throne you'll see that Glory which will be the father you'll see the waters it comes down out of the thrones it trickles down but we're going to tell you now you're going to see other beings in that City they're going to look human but these are the chosen these are the elect they will be so much like him you will feel yourself being pulled to Bow your heads as it were in their presence before you ever even reach him Oh Glory to God Lord Jesus may we be that type of people on earth may we be able to lead people to you may we be so Godly may we live so in your presence Lord God that when people get around us they don't have to ask are we a Christian something about our life or tell them something will so emanate from our soul a presence and all oh it'll never be nothing like it was a brother Branham and the others and all the great people like that but just being a child of God being touched by heaven bearing witness of Heaven and when we get to heaven we will take on a Heavenly image that will be closer to the exalted image of our person that we have married the Lord Jesus than what those who live outside the city will bear and when these outside the city will come in and Throne the streets they will walk by and bow their heads as it were and they will know Jesus there he is you know they told me them people lived on earth just like we did look at him now Look At That Glory as it comes from them they tell me on Earth they was called The Bride Lord God Lord Jesus glorify thou us a glory that we had was you before the foundation oh Lord God we worship you we bless your name tonight Jesus Hallelujah oh it's not the presence of a man that we sent chair it's not the presence of a prophet or a preacher it's not the presence of a bride member that was sense near us but it's the presence of him who takes drunks and changes him and lets them bear the image of the glory of God it's the presence of him who would take a woman who was so vile she might be a street walker whatever more but so saved by the power of God that she will walk down the streets of gold people will come in her presence bow their heads the glory that we will share will be so great that day on our person father the angels will bow their heads as we come in Lord God the prophet said when we go to singing them songs of redemption the angels will bow their heads and they will circle the Earth while we are singing because they don't know the songs of redemption they have worshiped you and praised you from maybe millions of years and I tell them tonight to do good do a great job until I get there until the saints of God get there because we will be the ones that were strong the Throne of our blessed Lord our husband we will replace them and sing the songs very damn Hallelujah glory to God as we ourselves will bear the image of deity for we also will be changed and bear the image of the heavenly father that will enshroud the body of the Lord Jesus friends don't think I'm crazy one day you will take on that image that he wants to share with you he don't want you to just be young he wants you to have that Glory that you had with him before the world began this is what I see on this man that John bowed before him he was so much like Jesus John thought how could that be just a mere mortal it was the deity of God this is what awaits you so I asked you what trial could you go through what test could you go through they would even compare to the glory that awaits us
