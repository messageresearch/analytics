[33:20] the street tonight for the Book of

[33:28] I'd like to um
[33:30] request your prayers if you would Lance
[33:34] and Erica I went today down to Nashville
[33:39] and Eric will be starting the
[33:42] a new treatment tomorrow it's called
[33:44] glutathara it's a radioactive type of
[33:48] stuff
[33:50] it's about a four hour procedure
[33:52] tomorrow
[33:53] and and show and she'll be coming on
[33:55] tomorrow night
[33:56] and then she'll have to get a shot that
[33:59] they require to take also be getting
[34:02] that on Friday
[34:04] but our God's been faithful
[34:07] it's true and he's he's going to be
[34:09] mindful of us through this
[34:11] with all these things of course there
[34:13] comes a whole list of side effects which
[34:15] is pretty discouraging if you read them
[34:17] but there was also a whole list of side
[34:19] effects with the y90 the one that she
[34:22] took and she hardly had any of them
[34:26] right that's what I'm talking about
[34:28] that's our God
[34:30] I've been serving him a long time and
[34:32] I've found out a long time ago
[34:34] he don't he don't take orders good from
[34:37] us
[34:39] we all still like to give them to him
[34:42] but I've learned through my
[34:44] hard-headedness and my stubbornness no
[34:46] doubt I'm the only one here in the room
[34:47] tonight that's been that way
[34:49] but I've learned that his way is so
[34:51] different from my way
[34:53] and he don't really need my input or my
[34:55] advice but what he wants is my trust
[34:59] and I love
[35:01] you amen so whatever we Face we just
[35:03] know that his his grace will be with us
[35:06] and he'll help us and I firmly believe
[35:09] God has our life in his hands and Satan
[35:12] cannot
[35:14] cannot take us and God is done with us
[35:17] This Is How firm I believe it if you're
[35:20] on a 747-400
[35:23] you left Los Angeles at 8 pm you're on
[35:26] your way to Auckland New Zealand
[35:29] somewhere out in the Pacific the first
[35:31] engine goes out the second then the
[35:34] third then the fourth but then you
[35:36] realize you're in big trouble
[35:39] the plane starts down it crashes hits
[35:42] the water at 500 miles an hour
[35:45] but it just so happens it's not your
[35:48] time to go
[35:49] there ain't no way the devil can take
[35:51] you
[35:52] if I didn't believe that I'd quit
[35:54] preaching and I'd quit serving the lord
[35:56] Jesus if he cannot take care of me and
[35:59] you well friends you think the devil let
[36:01] one of us be alive if it was at his
[36:04] power to take us there ain't no way he
[36:07] can do that our life is in his hands
[36:12] amen so if you'd remember some in prayer
[36:15] during that situation and we'll
[36:17] certainly keep you posted hope you don't
[36:18] mind us giving you updates and prayer
[36:21] requests and things like that
[36:23] amen Revelation chapter 18 verse 4.
[36:34] and I heard another voice from heaven
[36:38] saying come out of her
[36:41] my people
[36:44] so that tells me that God
[36:48] can have people that are in a mess
[36:52] whether it's sin or in this state of
[36:55] denominational mess
[36:57] come out of her my people that you be
[37:01] not partakers of her sins
[37:03] that you receive not of her plagues
[37:08] for her sins have reached unto heaven
[37:12] and God hath remembered her iniquities
[37:17] reward her
[37:19] even as she rewarded you
[37:23] double unto her
[37:25] double
[37:27] according to her works
[37:30] in the cup which she hath filled
[37:34] feel to her
[37:36] double
[37:38] now you know this already
[37:40] you and I
[37:42] can't do this
[37:44] and if there's anything about us that
[37:46] wants a vengeful Spirit on people that
[37:49] do us wrong we need to repent ask the
[37:51] Lord to forgive us
[37:53] but there is a measure by which this can
[37:56] be done
[37:57] which actually is righteous
[38:01] I hope this don't stagger you tonight
[38:04] but this is actually righteousness
[38:08] being handed out in a just measure now
[38:12] most humans cannot do this because we
[38:15] think so and so got me I'll get them if
[38:17] it's the last thing I do no that's not
[38:19] what we're talking about
[38:21] this is righteousness carried out not
[38:25] Revenge not human revenge and eventual
[38:28] attitude
[38:30] how many lots of people remember tonight
[38:31] as we pray
[38:33] Heavenly Father we love you so much
[38:36] we're so thankful Lord Jesus that we
[38:39] could have this place where we could be
[38:41] able to assemble ourselves together
[38:44] Lord we realize that No Doubt it's very
[38:49] unusual things that are being said for
[38:52] the staff employees whoevermore that
[38:54] would walk by the doors and hear and see
[38:57] things they've never heard and seen
[38:58] before but we believe we're here for a
[39:01] reason father
[39:02] maybe there's a little seed of God
[39:04] walking around out here and they've been
[39:06] looking their whole life you've got us
[39:08] here for one so we don't know but we
[39:11] know father God we believe our lives are
[39:14] divinely orchestrated by you
[39:17] Lord as we approach your word tonight
[39:19] we're asking for your help we know
[39:21] father that there's so much sickness
[39:23] going on flu viruses all different kinds
[39:27] of things Lord we know many are sick and
[39:30] can't be here tonight we're praying for
[39:32] them that you would just move for them
[39:33] Lord Jesus you see our needs spiritually
[39:36] father we need you to come by this way
[39:40] tonight
[39:41] open our understanding your ways are so
[39:45] much different than ours help us not to
[39:48] process what we're going to hear tonight
[39:50] by mental conception but May It Be by
[39:55] divine intervention
[39:56] speak to us from your word father we
[39:59] love you father God before we partake of
[40:02] this Meal which you have prepared for us
[40:05] tonight we give you thanks make it
[40:08] sustenance to our soul as we bow our
[40:11] heads before we pray over our natural
[40:13] breakfast lunch and supper so now we
[40:16] with gratitude and Thanksgiving in our
[40:18] hearts thank you for this word that
[40:21] you're going to feed us on tonight may
[40:23] it give us all kinds of nutrients and
[40:25] vitamins and things that will mold in us
[40:28] more of the image of the Lord Jesus for
[40:30] it's in his name we ask it amen amen God
[40:34] bless you you may be seated
[40:37] let's read continue on if you would in
[40:39] verse 7.
[40:42] how much
[40:43] she has glorified herself
[40:47] and lived deliciously
[40:52] so much torment
[40:54] and sorrow
[40:57] give her
[40:59] for she saith in her heart
[41:02] I set a queen
[41:05] and am no Widow
[41:08] and shall see no sorrow
[41:12] now I want you to listen to
[41:15] this self-evaluation
[41:19] of whoever this is now most of you of
[41:22] course know who it is but whoever this
[41:25] is representing
[41:27] she views her status
[41:31] in a place of such security
[41:34] she's boastful
[41:36] she's vain she's proud she's arrogant
[41:41] she glorified herself now whoever this
[41:46] is apparently cannot receive correction
[41:49] from God's word
[41:52] she looks at herself with such an
[41:56] evaluation of who she thinks she is
[42:00] I would imagine most of us have dealt
[42:03] with this attitude where we look at
[42:06] ourselves our understanding our
[42:09] perception of God our perception of his
[42:12] people our perception of our
[42:15] understanding no doubt we've evaluated
[42:19] ourselves higher sometimes than what we
[42:22] really were
[42:24] and no doubt we've evaluated ourselves
[42:27] in some instances where we were actually
[42:30] evaluating ourselves lower than we
[42:33] really were it takes God to help us in
[42:37] this evaluation to be able to see it
[42:40] properly there's been times I've needed
[42:44] my evaluation to be lifted higher
[42:47] and there's been other times I've needed
[42:50] it to be brought down a little bit lower
[42:52] no doubt I'm the only one here tonight
[42:54] so I'll go ahead and preach to myself on
[42:56] that I'll just go ahead and amen myself
[42:58] Amen brother Donnie that's right you've
[43:01] been there
[43:03] but you see the difference between us
[43:07] and this woman is that if she heard this
[43:12] she was never able to re-evaluate
[43:16] herself in the light of God's word
[43:19] no doubt she was reproved rebuked she
[43:24] was chastened by ministers down to the
[43:27] ages but it was basically like pulling
[43:30] water off of a duck's back it just run
[43:33] right off she paid no attention and she
[43:36] would always come back to this self
[43:39] evaluation I am a queen
[43:44] I am a great entity to God and to
[43:49] humanity
[43:51] the world needs me
[43:54] the world cannot operate properly
[43:57] without me I hope nobody here tonight
[43:59] thinks that
[44:01] you know I don't care who you are and
[44:03] what your position is every one of us
[44:05] are replaceable
[44:08] but the truth of it is nobody can take
[44:10] Jesus please
[44:12] if time terries long enough I'll go to
[44:15] the way of the grave and you all will
[44:17] get another Pastor if time tarries long
[44:20] enough Harry will go by the way of the
[44:22] Grave Brother Louis will all these
[44:24] singers all these musicians and go and
[44:27] face the facts all of you with us
[44:29] and the church will go right on but I
[44:33] won't go right on with it and neither
[44:34] will you but yet this entity had come to
[44:39] a spot that John said how much she has
[44:42] glorified herself and this glorification
[44:47] brought this other adjective which John
[44:50] used by the spirit of God to describe
[44:53] her and that was she had lived
[44:56] deliciously what a strange way to
[45:00] describe an entity that had been so
[45:03] destructive an entity that had been
[45:06] interwoven and intertwined with the
[45:10] kings of the Earth as a matter of fact
[45:12] she delegated herself in her position
[45:16] and her Authority as higher than the
[45:19] empress the Kings and the dictators of
[45:23] the earth even higher than God's word
[45:28] and she had no problem making the
[45:31] Declaration that God's word was just a
[45:34] Bible that's all it was full of mistakes
[45:37] and errors but the absolute was her Pope
[45:44] well I'll tell you one thing I'm glad he
[45:46] ain't my absolute
[45:49] aren't you
[45:50] now notice how God is going to regulate
[45:55] the Judgment that will be given to this
[45:58] entity
[46:00] so John says how much she's glorified
[46:02] herself and lived deliciously so much
[46:06] torment and sorrow
[46:09] give her
[46:11] now most of us will never do this in the
[46:15] magnitude that this church did
[46:18] but you don't have to be in this
[46:20] magnitude all you got to do is have this
[46:23] same attitude as an individual
[46:25] well I'll tell you one thing if this is
[46:27] what you get back for it I want nothing
[46:29] to do with it I don't want to glorify
[46:32] myself do you we don't want to glorify
[46:35] our church we don't want to glorify us
[46:38] as individuals we want to glorify the
[46:41] Lord Jesus
[46:43] because
[46:44] self-glorification ends up in this type
[46:48] of Destiny so whether it's preachers
[46:51] singers songwriters musicians or a
[46:55] global entity like this city church that
[46:59] we are looking at and all leads to the
[47:02] same reward
[47:05] oh my
[47:06] so much torment and sorrow give her
[47:12] for she sayeth in her heart I sit
[47:16] a queen now this is the way that she has
[47:21] the self-evaluation
[47:23] she looks at herself as the Queen of
[47:27] Heaven the wife of God
[47:31] she is not divorceable
[47:34] she cannot die
[47:36] she cannot be put away
[47:40] this is why she looks at this in such an
[47:44] arrogant tenor and such a tone of voice
[47:48] that she looks at herself in the spot of
[47:52] eternal security
[47:55] God cannot
[47:57] put her away
[48:00] God cannot divorce her
[48:03] well you know what this reminds me and
[48:06] lets me know then if there is an entity
[48:09] like this that is saying this
[48:12] she must be impersonating someone who
[48:17] can say it truthfully
[48:19] praise the Lord
[48:21] that truly can say I said as a queen
[48:26] but because of his Mercy
[48:28] not because of anything I've done and as
[48:31] brother random said it well he can put
[48:34] us away any time he wants to but dare
[48:38] any of us try to put him away
[48:42] but she because of her arrogance looks
[48:46] at herself and
[48:48] evaluates herself
[48:51] and yet
[48:52] she says I said a queen and am no little
[48:59] I am married to El shadiah
[49:03] I am married to the eternal
[49:06] I am no Widow and I can be no Widow I'll
[49:11] set a queen and I will see no sorrow
[49:17] I am God's voice on the earth I am his
[49:23] mouthpiece
[49:24] if the pope acquires there is a
[49:27] Purgatory then there is one
[49:30] although the Bible says so or not the
[49:33] Bible don't have to say it
[49:37] well if the Pope says the streets of
[49:39] Glory are peanut butter and jelly does
[49:42] that make it so
[49:43] well I guess if you're a true Catholic
[49:45] it does I guess if you're died in the
[49:48] world and you're part of this move then
[49:49] you say yeah and don't condemn them too
[49:51] hard because as many folks that said
[49:54] unto the influence of message preachers
[49:56] and if that preacher gets up and says
[49:58] it's this way that way that way and that
[50:00] way and you show them one quote after
[50:02] another and scripture after another and
[50:04] they will not be corrected by that in
[50:07] reality they are spiritual Catholics
[50:09] and they just made their Pastor their
[50:12] Pope
[50:16] well praise the lord well the prophet
[50:18] said well we know the prophet said it
[50:20] that way but God led me this way then
[50:23] you're just as bad as wrong
[50:28] well we're going to have church tonight
[50:29] or what
[50:31] now notice the word that John used there
[50:34] she has glorified herself and the word
[50:37] means to boast she she boasted of her
[50:42] greatness you know you get around people
[50:44] like that and their favorite subject is
[50:48] what themself it's not the weather it's
[50:52] not how good their vegetable garden done
[50:53] their maiders their taters or beans you
[50:56] know it's about them and then you know
[50:58] myself I get tired there's very few
[51:01] people that I love spending on our list
[51:03] and 57 and a half minutes is about them
[51:06] now the Lord Jesus I can take the whole
[51:09] hour and he can talk to me about his
[51:12] greatness and all amen till I'm hoarse
[51:14] and I love to hear him talk that way but
[51:17] I don't know any other Mortal that I do
[51:19] now look I love you all okay I love you
[51:23] all but I I don't like caring about you
[51:25] all for an hour and a half at a time
[51:27] because I know you all too well and you
[51:30] all know me well enough to know there
[51:32] ain't enough in me good enough to talk
[51:34] about but let's talk about something
[51:36] that's good let's talk about something
[51:38] that's holy and something that's
[51:40] righteous and and sure we got our
[51:42] position in the kingdom of God but
[51:44] really in reality there's none of us
[51:46] that have a whole lot to boast about
[51:50] thousands of souls to Christ praise the
[51:52] Lord but you have nothing to boast about
[51:54] yourself God gave you the ability to do
[51:57] that well I pray for so-and-so and I've
[52:00] done this wonderful thank God for that
[52:02] but only God's grace will give you that
[52:04] not your Merit it doesn't make you
[52:07] better than the man that's only prayed
[52:08] for one person and they got better God
[52:11] is the one who gives those gifts out all
[52:14] praise all credit all all exaltation
[52:17] goes to him not to us
[52:21] [Applause]
[52:22] um
[52:25] but you see this entity this city church
[52:29] this city state
[52:32] she is so arrogant and proud and she
[52:36] exalts herself above God's word exalts
[52:40] herself above Kings above Emperors she's
[52:44] been in this position for many many
[52:47] centuries she outlived Napoleon she
[52:52] outlived Constantine she outlived
[52:55] Herodotus she outlived Pope Boniface and
[52:59] all down through there this entity has
[53:02] lived for thousands of years ongoing and
[53:06] still today has a greater influence than
[53:10] any King on the Earth
[53:12] our president is a novice compared to
[53:16] the power of this entity which is Rome
[53:19] well praise the Lord
[53:21] come on now
[53:23] you'll realize that God God never trusts
[53:28] any mortal with this type of power
[53:33] man it's just not in him to be trusted
[53:38] with such a position
[53:40] no matter how great the kings were in
[53:43] the Old Testament but look at it Lord
[53:44] willing on Sunday
[53:46] and even one as great as David was but
[53:50] yet David when he got to a place to
[53:52] where the kingdom was established and
[53:55] David got to trust him too much in
[53:57] himself and David made a horrible
[54:00] horrible mistake and you remembered but
[54:02] the sin was Bathsheba and God never
[54:06] intended for man to be placed in such a
[54:09] position because this is what follows
[54:12] with many of them and God says about
[54:15] this city church that she lived
[54:18] deliciously in a luxurian type of manner
[54:23] and yet many of her parishioners that
[54:27] she claims as her own they will come and
[54:30] have to sacrifice and buy a candle and
[54:33] buy this and that and the other novenas
[54:36] and pray to get someone out of purgatory
[54:39] and many of them have to take a big
[54:41] portion of their living to do so and
[54:43] bring it into what a which is
[54:46] given them damn damnation to their soul
[54:49] now come on don't sit there and look at
[54:51] me funny
[54:52] and yet this is what God says about them
[54:56] now remember this was prophecy 2 000
[54:59] years ago but I believe with all of my
[55:02] heart we are the generation living on
[55:05] the earth tonight that are going to see
[55:07] the consummation of these things right
[55:09] here
[55:10] so God says because of that attitude and
[55:13] what you've done so much torment and
[55:16] sorrow give her by pulling down her
[55:20] Pride by bringing her arrogance to a
[55:23] spot to where she will realize she is
[55:26] absolutely nothing God will take away
[55:30] her control and her power she will who
[55:35] will boast of being the longest ruling
[55:38] entity that the world has ever known but
[55:42] been withstood by Kings and Emperors and
[55:46] potentates and dictators and yet not
[55:49] been able to destroy her and yet God
[55:52] will humiliate her in one hour she will
[55:56] be annihilating
[56:00] oh my
[56:02] God thank God for his Mercy to help us
[56:04] to see our pride and our arrogance
[56:06] or we would be annihilated just like she
[56:09] would
[56:10] God will destroy her with what fire
[56:15] atomic
[56:17] fire
[56:19] she saith in her heart I set a queen now
[56:23] again as I said this is a self-estimate
[56:26] you find this also of course in
[56:27] Revelation 3 when the laodicee in church
[56:30] says I am rich I am increased with goods
[56:33] and I have need of nothing that's their
[56:36] evaluation but God reevaluates her case
[56:40] and said you don't know it but you're
[56:42] wretched you're blind you're naked
[56:45] you're miserable and what makes it so
[56:47] bad is you don't even know that you are
[56:49] now we might not have been Catholics but
[56:51] we were all layout of sins
[56:53] so that's the case we were in we were
[56:56] wretched we were blind we were naked we
[56:59] were miserable well why aren't we that
[57:01] way tonight Amazing Grace how sweet to
[57:04] Sam
[57:05] now notice the authority that she claims
[57:09] and this claim is actually very much
[57:11] true that's your house authority over
[57:13] the kings of the earth she also has a
[57:17] spiritual jurisdiction by which she
[57:20] Reigns through apostasy now what is
[57:23] apostasy it's the word that Paul used
[57:25] writing in the New Testament and he said
[57:28] there would come in the last days that
[57:30] the Lord could not come until there came
[57:33] a falling away now that Greek word those
[57:36] apostille apostasia and it is the word
[57:38] the English word is the apostasy so it's
[57:41] a falling away from something that was
[57:44] right declared to be a truce and yet
[57:47] people turn away from that and they go
[57:49] away so she is holding the people her
[57:52] constituents of her Believers by a face
[57:55] which is an apostasy do they have to
[57:58] have faith yes they have to believe that
[58:01] what they're doing is it's sad it is
[58:03] there's no doubt many sincere people oh
[58:05] brother Donnie I've got somebody in that
[58:06] move keep praying for them that God will
[58:08] bring them out remember as long as
[58:10] they're in her they're still Mercy for
[58:13] them until she goes into him now
[58:16] remember when the bride goes up and the
[58:18] Devil comes down the transition is made
[58:20] from the church itself then Satan will
[58:23] become the headship on the earth then
[58:25] the church everything about it will move
[58:27] into him and the prophet said if your
[58:29] name is found on that stalk book you
[58:31] will die with her so while there's still
[58:34] breaths in their body while Mercy is
[58:37] still there while the blood is still on
[58:39] The Mercy Seat oh I've got a son I've
[58:41] got a daughter I've got a husband and a
[58:43] wife or pray for him little Esther it
[58:46] might be your prayer that God will hear
[58:48] and turn them around you may think I'm
[58:50] crazy tonight I'd rather have a loved
[58:52] one if they was taken off the Earth than
[58:54] to be spared of going through that
[58:56] tribulation period if they wasn't Blood
[58:57] come on now I'd much rather the Lord but
[59:00] take them off the Earth and let him be
[59:01] judged for what they know than to live
[59:04] through this time because we know many
[59:06] will come out and they will withstand
[59:09] this move and the prophet said they will
[59:11] be hunted down like dogs and they will
[59:14] give their lives for what they knew oh
[59:17] but I'm so glad I'm not going to be
[59:19] hunted down like no dog I ain't no dog
[59:21] in the first place I'm going to be
[59:23] carried away into a body change and
[59:26] enjoying the marriage supper of the Lamb
[59:28] with you my brothers and sisters
[59:31] oh praise the Lord
[59:34] thank you Lord Jesus and she says she
[59:38] will see no sorrow now sorrow of course
[59:40] can be expressed in many different ways
[59:42] I will see no loss of my children I will
[59:45] see no loss in my constituency I will
[59:48] see no loss of my power of my position
[59:51] everything that's involved in all of the
[59:54] Proclamation of who she thinks she is
[59:57] God will strip her from that in a moment
[1:00:00] of time and it will be totally gone he
[1:00:03] will humiliate her before the world all
[1:00:07] had us blessed Rock of Ages uh that this
[1:00:11] book of History I'm not sure if you've
[1:00:12] ever heard of it or not but it was a man
[1:00:14] by the name of tornb
[1:00:16] t-o-y-n-b-e-e and his history wrote a
[1:00:19] book on the great world's history and
[1:00:21] according to the chronological order of
[1:00:23] tornba's History all the great world
[1:00:26] civilizations they all crumble when they
[1:00:29] reach the heights of their power now
[1:00:32] whether it was the macedonians whether
[1:00:34] it was the Greeks or the Romans
[1:00:35] parthians whichever ones that it was
[1:00:37] don't you understand why that America is
[1:00:40] absolutely on her way down I hope you're
[1:00:43] able to see it we have reached the
[1:00:45] Pinnacle of our power look around we've
[1:00:47] been going downhill for years
[1:00:49] oh I know they want to make America
[1:00:51] great again will never do it I don't
[1:00:54] care who gets in the white house I don't
[1:00:56] care who vote who you vote in it'll
[1:00:58] never return she's on her way down look
[1:01:02] at our society look at our civilization
[1:01:05] come on you're probably ready today our
[1:01:07] Senate want to now make sure that they
[1:01:09] make it a law to where that the gays can
[1:01:12] keep their rights oh of course and it
[1:01:13] won't be but a matter of time that
[1:01:15] they'll want to jail preachers like me
[1:01:17] to preach against it well come on say
[1:01:19] Amen but will we compromise we will not
[1:01:23] compromise we'll stand for God's word
[1:01:25] because if we stand for him now he will
[1:01:29] stand for us
[1:01:30] amen he will stand for US Open by the
[1:01:34] Donnie it may get scary it may get scary
[1:01:36] but he said I'll never leave you I'll
[1:01:39] never forsake you
[1:01:43] oh my
[1:01:44] notice in verse 8.
[1:01:47] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[1:01:52] day death
[1:01:54] and mourning and famine she shall be
[1:01:59] utterly burned with fire
[1:02:02] for strong
[1:02:04] is the Lord God
[1:02:06] who judges her
[1:02:09] death and she thought she'd never die
[1:02:13] she was God's mouthpiece so she said and
[1:02:16] she's told this life for so long I
[1:02:19] believe she believes it
[1:02:21] you see the dangerous part of a
[1:02:24] reprobate is that God before an
[1:02:27] individual ever gets to the state of
[1:02:28] being reprobated God will deal with him
[1:02:31] and deal with him two times three times
[1:02:32] five times who knows how many times but
[1:02:34] eventually God will stop dealing with
[1:02:37] them and he allows them to go to that
[1:02:39] spot to where they're turned over to
[1:02:41] reprobate mind that they will believe a
[1:02:43] lie and be damned by the lie that they
[1:02:47] believe
[1:02:48] but you see God is Not unjust to make
[1:02:50] people do that he gives them Mercy but
[1:02:53] they choose to believe that lie and turn
[1:02:56] down the truth and she honestly believes
[1:02:58] the self-evaluation I'm a queen I'm the
[1:03:01] voice of God I have the representation
[1:03:03] of God if the Pope says this or this or
[1:03:05] this he's God's man on the earth he has
[1:03:08] the ability to decree such a thing and
[1:03:11] they believe it was all of their hearts
[1:03:14] but yet God says this is what I will do
[1:03:18] I will bring her Mourning
[1:03:21] I will bring her morning instead of her
[1:03:24] feasting I will bring her destruction
[1:03:27] and I will bring the seat of the Beast
[1:03:30] to Total Annihilation and humility
[1:03:34] before the kings of the earth now notice
[1:03:36] God is not going to let this happen at
[1:03:38] the battle of Armageddon God is actually
[1:03:41] going to destroy this entity of this
[1:03:44] world power before the end of the
[1:03:47] tribulation period he will destroy her
[1:03:50] before the end of the tribulation period
[1:03:52] that she may be humbled why she humbled
[1:03:56] his people on earth
[1:03:58] she was the power that dragged many of
[1:04:01] them in the Spanish Inquisition she was
[1:04:04] the power that dragged many not only
[1:04:06] Christians but Jews all around the world
[1:04:08] and had them killed and in her is the
[1:04:11] blood of the prophets and the blood of
[1:04:13] the martyrs and the blood of the Saints
[1:04:15] and she did it in public forms she did
[1:04:18] it in public trials and bought false
[1:04:20] Witnesses and paved them to stand up and
[1:04:23] lie against the people of God and God
[1:04:25] said I will not let her go out in the
[1:04:29] rest of the Flames of Armageddon I will
[1:04:31] annihilate her before the entire world I
[1:04:36] will let them see her be destroyed and
[1:04:39] no doubt on YouTube on all types of
[1:04:42] social media it will be accepted around
[1:04:44] the world and they'll look at all know
[1:04:46] they'll cry they'll weep they'll moan
[1:04:48] they'll lament and they'll look and say
[1:04:50] how could this be because great is the
[1:04:54] Lord God who judges her and thank God
[1:04:57] that friends if God had not given us
[1:04:59] mercy and then we responded to that
[1:05:01] Mercy we would be one of them left on
[1:05:04] the earth and instead of being in the
[1:05:06] mercy of God we will be under the wrath
[1:05:08] of God oh I'm so glad to know that I've
[1:05:11] accepted his love and his Mercy in his
[1:05:14] forgiveness out and if you want to call
[1:05:16] me whatever you want to but oh I'm so
[1:05:19] glad that I received that Mercy many
[1:05:21] many years ago and not only did I when I
[1:05:24] first got saved I receive it every day
[1:05:26] of my life amen it's renewed every day
[1:05:30] that I live
[1:05:32] Hallelujah
[1:05:34] oh Hallelujah
[1:05:36] notice this I quote this to your last
[1:05:38] the Wednesday night that I dealt with
[1:05:40] this this is from The Mark of the Beast
[1:05:43] remember I say this
[1:05:45] that's God's prophet
[1:05:47] the Russian Empire
[1:05:49] not USSR
[1:05:53] the Russian Empire will drop an atomic
[1:05:57] bomb
[1:05:59] of some sort on the Vatican City and
[1:06:02] destroy it in one hour I'm sure you've
[1:06:05] been hearing the news and the bomb or
[1:06:07] whatever it was that happened in Poland
[1:06:08] and they're trying to figure out did
[1:06:10] that come from Russia where did it come
[1:06:12] from why Poland is a NATO a NATO member
[1:06:15] so if it was dropped by the Russians on
[1:06:17] there a bomb dropped on them is the same
[1:06:19] equivalent to a bomb dropped on us now
[1:06:21] it becomes more scary
[1:06:24] oh brother Donnie oh man what are we
[1:06:26] going to do we're fixing to leave that's
[1:06:27] what we're fixing to do before one bomb
[1:06:30] will ever drop we will leave this world
[1:06:33] friends be ready
[1:06:35] I know some of you have heard this for
[1:06:37] years and years and years but you're
[1:06:38] living in the generation that this is
[1:06:41] going to happen
[1:06:43] hallelujah oh let's get ready to leave
[1:06:47] this world
[1:06:51] the Russian Empire will drop an atomic
[1:06:54] bomb of some sort on the Vatican City
[1:06:56] and destroy it in one hour thus saith
[1:07:00] the Lord
[1:07:01] and the Bible said that God took them
[1:07:04] cruel-hearted men and put them in the
[1:07:07] hands and they were instruments in his
[1:07:10] hands to fulfill his will men like Putin
[1:07:13] I don't know if Putin's a man or not but
[1:07:15] you know what if he ain't it maybe
[1:07:16] somebody behind him you're saying why
[1:07:18] would they do that to Ukraine what in
[1:07:20] the world is going on there's always
[1:07:22] been that type of people on the Earth if
[1:07:24] one man one man can cause a destruction
[1:07:28] our brothers and sisters I would send a
[1:07:30] video the other day of some of our
[1:07:32] brothers and sisters in Ukraine and they
[1:07:34] blowed a lot of their power stations
[1:07:36] down they had no electricity and they
[1:07:38] was there holding a candle the song
[1:07:39] leader holding a candle little saints
[1:07:42] back to there with flashlights and and
[1:07:44] their phones are shining on the words
[1:07:46] and they were singing a song and
[1:07:48] worshiping God all right in the middle
[1:07:50] of a war I thought yeah that's the real
[1:07:52] people of God that's the real people of
[1:07:55] God no electricity bundled up and cold
[1:07:57] you know cold in the in the building
[1:07:59] having on coats and a little flashlight
[1:08:01] and they came go but they didn't stop
[1:08:03] their worship they didn't stop them from
[1:08:05] preaching and didn't stop them from
[1:08:07] going to the house of God my goodness we
[1:08:09] get a little sniffle and we stay at the
[1:08:11] house and stream there they were right
[1:08:13] in the middle of a war but they said you
[1:08:15] know what it's Church time let's go to
[1:08:17] church we got no electricity let's go to
[1:08:20] church we ain't got no heat but let's go
[1:08:23] to church anyhow amen no real believer
[1:08:26] has that desire to get together with the
[1:08:29] people of God
[1:08:33] oh my
[1:08:36] oh when this happens
[1:08:39] look at verse 9.
[1:08:41] and the kings of the earth who have
[1:08:43] committed fornication
[1:08:46] and lay of deliciously
[1:08:49] now she lived deliciously in verse 8.
[1:08:52] now these kings are identified with the
[1:08:56] same adjective that John uses to
[1:08:58] describe that church
[1:09:00] so you see being a partaker in people's
[1:09:03] sins identifies you with the same
[1:09:06] adjectives or adverbs
[1:09:09] oh my
[1:09:12] God so she lived deliciously and they
[1:09:14] are also identified in the same way
[1:09:17] live deliciously with her shalt be
[1:09:21] wailed her
[1:09:22] now notice this is not the end the end
[1:09:24] of the Armageddon God will allow many of
[1:09:27] these Kings potentates dictators and
[1:09:30] rulers and they will see her destroyed
[1:09:33] and they will weep and cry and lament oh
[1:09:38] such fearful what are we going to do
[1:09:40] what are we going to do who's going to
[1:09:42] press out of purgatory now there ain't
[1:09:43] no Pope on the earth there ain't no
[1:09:45] Bishop I'm here I've got my rosary out

[1:09:58] earth well come on now there ain't going

[1:10:21] committed fornication and lived
[1:10:23] deliciously with her shall be weld her
[1:10:26] and lament for her
[1:10:29] when they shall see the smoke
[1:10:32] of her burning
[1:10:34] so CNN ABC whoever more sending over
[1:10:38] their drones you imagine all this
[1:10:39] radioactivity coming out of Italy and
[1:10:41] all this that's going on and yet they'll
[1:10:43] lament and they'll cry and they'll weep
[1:10:45] reckon that'll happen when the bride
[1:10:47] goes

[1:11:06] tell you what he wouldn't smoke he
[1:11:08] wouldn't tell no dirty jokes around the
[1:11:10] rest of it I'm so glad I imagine it'll
[1:11:13] be similar like it was in the land of
[1:11:15] Egypt one Pharaoh said no I ain't
[1:11:17] letting you go God said oh yeah you will
[1:11:18] said no I ain't going to do it he said
[1:11:19] yeah you will and you'll be glad to let
[1:11:21] him go and they were so glad by the time
[1:11:23] they got ready to leave they said take

[1:11:48] we devil and so are we no more trouble
[1:11:53] no more devil no more hurting no more
[1:11:56] anxiety
[1:11:58] [Applause]
[1:12:07] I know some of y'all think I'm just
[1:12:08] about the craziest preacher you ever
[1:12:10] seen in your life
[1:12:15] but believe it or not I'm preaching you
[1:12:17] a body changing message
[1:12:20] [Applause]
[1:12:25] when they shall see
[1:12:29] imagine how strange this must have been
[1:12:31] when the prophecy come out of John's
[1:12:34] mouth
[1:12:36] how on the way was that even possible at
[1:12:38] that time
[1:12:39] it wasn't possible in the natural sense
[1:12:41] so the kings of the Earth
[1:12:44] not just the kings of Rome Sicily
[1:12:47] but the kings of the Earth how is that
[1:12:49] even possible in that day it wasn't
[1:12:51] possible brother Josh but it's prophetic
[1:12:54] so God could speak it as if though it
[1:12:57] had already happened even though the
[1:12:59] Scientific Technology wasn't even
[1:13:00] available until that all the kings of
[1:13:02] the earth see it
[1:13:05] at one time
[1:13:07] God's word don't lie France
[1:13:10] oh
[1:13:12] notice this when God begins to enter
[1:13:16] into his judgment
[1:13:19] the church's enemies
[1:13:22] oh Lord
[1:13:25] that trusted in the arm of Flesh
[1:13:28] and use their civic
[1:13:30] and ecclesiastical and political power
[1:13:34] to persecute the church
[1:13:37] I don't want to be in their shoes myself
[1:13:40] you see the strongest man
[1:13:43] the wealthiest man the man with the most
[1:13:46] power or influence you're talking about
[1:13:49] a terrifying time
[1:13:51] hide us Lord Jesus
[1:13:54] not only do the merchants now I've read
[1:13:57] to you already some of the business
[1:13:59] things that they are involved in
[1:14:01] but not only are the merchants of the
[1:14:04] Earth
[1:14:05] going to lament but the Kings the rulers
[1:14:10] one day when the books are open and we
[1:14:12] all stand before him at the white Throne
[1:14:14] I would say we'll be surprised how much
[1:14:16] involves that she's been in the
[1:14:18] government of the world
[1:14:21] we're finding out more and more what a
[1:14:23] bigger part she had in World War II with
[1:14:25] the trying to exterminate the Jews
[1:14:29] notice in verse 10.
[1:14:31] standing afar off
[1:14:34] for the fear of her torment what is it
[1:14:38] nuclear
[1:14:39] Fallout
[1:14:43] they see what happened to her they see
[1:14:46] the destruction and they're standing
[1:14:48] author how are they able to see this
[1:14:51] then if they're standing afar off
[1:14:55] science
[1:14:57] drones
[1:14:58] TV cameras
[1:15:00] YouTube
[1:15:02] well don't look for me on YouTube then
[1:15:04] because all my videos will be gone
[1:15:10] standing will fall off for the fear of
[1:15:12] her torment saying alas
[1:15:15] alas
[1:15:16] that great City Babylon
[1:15:19] that Mighty City know this this is not a
[1:15:23] country
[1:15:24] it is not a nation
[1:15:28] a city
[1:15:30] a city
[1:15:32] so it's not an Empire
[1:15:35] in the sense of being over Spain over
[1:15:37] Europe over the Americas
[1:15:40] it is a city
[1:15:43] a city-state we know
[1:15:46] that Mighty City
[1:15:48] for in one hour
[1:15:51] is not judgment come
[1:15:54] alas
[1:15:56] alas
[1:15:58] that great City that Mighty City look at
[1:16:02] their admiration for her what is wrong
[1:16:04] with these people
[1:16:06] can't they see what just happened to
[1:16:08] this and they still stand there with
[1:16:11] this admiration in their hearts oh no oh
[1:16:14] no I can't believe it I keep believing
[1:16:16] look what's happened to her
[1:16:21] you see even these that are left on the
[1:16:23] Earth are still missing
[1:16:25] that Divine Touch of the supernatural
[1:16:28] to be able to help them see when God
[1:16:30] abandons something and stands against it
[1:16:34] you either stand against it or you're
[1:16:36] identified with it
[1:16:40] you see we're living in such a
[1:16:41] compromising age people don't want to
[1:16:43] know where right and wrong is they want
[1:16:45] to know where the middle is so they can
[1:16:47] kind of walk that treacherous path you
[1:16:49] know
[1:16:50] well what does everybody want me to say
[1:16:52] well you know what the advertisers want
[1:16:54] me to say you know the woke and the left
[1:16:56] deal and all that they're all just
[1:16:58] compromises and you've got to go with
[1:17:01] lgbq2yozo3050 whatever it is and you've
[1:17:04] got to find well what's the world want
[1:17:05] me to say what's the world want me to
[1:17:07] say well whatever they want me to say
[1:17:09] that means I ain't going to say it
[1:17:10] because if they're wanting me to say it
[1:17:12] no doubt it's wrong because they're the
[1:17:14] world but that's the way the order of
[1:17:16] the world Cosmos is going to do come on
[1:17:18] children my goodness we see many of our
[1:17:20] churches and they're compromising I'm
[1:17:22] sure you've heard about the Methodist
[1:17:23] Church they've had a big split why
[1:17:24] because of them open and voting in a gay
[1:17:27] Bishop want to lose a matter with them
[1:17:29] don't you know that it was the sodomites
[1:17:32] knocking on the door of Lot's house it
[1:17:35] was them perverts that was coming down
[1:17:37] their wall was locked down in the land
[1:17:39] of Sodom you don't find them perverse
[1:17:42] knocking on Abraham's oak tree do you
[1:17:44] Abraham wouldn't put up with such stuff
[1:17:47] as I come on now somebody Oh my he might
[1:17:50] not make them live right but he could
[1:17:52] stand and say that ain't right it's over
[1:17:54] the devil
[1:17:55] amen because he was not a compromiser
[1:17:59] but the worldly Church look at him oh we
[1:18:02] love everybody and they're flying their
[1:18:04] gay flags and putting out the rainbows I
[1:18:07] ain't the same rainbow the Lord God
[1:18:09] posted over the Earth why would they
[1:18:11] take that Covenant sign nothing but
[1:18:13] blasphemy
[1:18:15] oh but I say they are the people under
[1:18:19] the rainbow Covenant on the Earth
[1:18:29] well if I get killed y'all remember I
[1:18:31] love you
[1:18:36] the merchants of the Earth
[1:18:38] shall weep
[1:18:39] and mourn
[1:18:41] over her
[1:18:44] they just don't get it do they
[1:18:47] they just don't get it
[1:18:50] the destructive power that lays in her
[1:18:54] and they're still crying because
[1:18:58] the money
[1:19:02] for no man biased their merchandise
[1:19:06] anymore
[1:19:08] verse 16 is saying alas alas
[1:19:13] that great city that was clothed in fine
[1:19:16] linen
[1:19:17] ah and purple
[1:19:21] ah
[1:19:23] remember the prophet warned us
[1:19:26] of three curtains
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:31] three curtains
[1:19:33] but he said don't worry about communism
[1:19:36] don't worry about the red curtain
[1:19:38] but it's that purple when you better
[1:19:40] watch
[1:19:44] um
[1:19:45] scarred and decked with gold and
[1:19:48] precious stones and pearls now these
[1:19:51] articles aren't so much to be
[1:19:53] personalized that it's an individual
[1:19:54] woman but it's showing her her wealth
[1:19:56] and her power
[1:19:58] and her control
[1:20:00] notice in verse 17 4 and one hour so
[1:20:03] great riches has come to naught
[1:20:06] and every shipmaster
[1:20:09] and all the company and ships
[1:20:11] and sailors and as many as trayed by the
[1:20:15] sea
[1:20:16] stood afar off I mean this entity
[1:20:19] affected merchandise and selling and
[1:20:22] buying
[1:20:26] I'm glad the only thing we specialize is
[1:20:28] is the gospel
[1:20:32] we don't trade in stocks
[1:20:34] come on the Church of the Living God
[1:20:36] that's not no our money is not tied up
[1:20:38] in that I'll tell you what a lot of your
[1:20:40] money's tied up in
[1:20:43] for over 35 years since I've been here
[1:20:45] as you Pastor
[1:20:48] you have helped build churches
[1:20:50] around this entire Earth
[1:20:53] as a matter of fact there's 44. 44.
[1:20:59] 44.
[1:21:01] in Uganda that they're waiting for me to
[1:21:03] come and dedicate now
[1:21:06] that you built
[1:21:09] you see some message people don't
[1:21:11] believe the scripture
[1:21:12] that whatever you sow thou so you'll
[1:21:15] also reap
[1:21:17] so you know what you've done you have
[1:21:19] sowed church buildings for years
[1:21:22] and then people get mad when God rewards
[1:21:25] you back for what you've done
[1:21:27] I believe that scripture the way I
[1:21:29] believe Malachi 4.
[1:21:31] and if God don't honor that one how can
[1:21:33] I trust him for the Rapture scripture
[1:21:34] well come on
[1:21:35] you have built them around the world now
[1:21:39] we could have hoarded it and we could
[1:21:40] have done this and that and the other
[1:21:41] but that was not what God put on my
[1:21:44] heart to do and I am so glad because
[1:21:47] there's churches that didn't have a
[1:21:48] building to Worship in and they've got
[1:21:50] one now they didn't have a roof over
[1:21:53] their head but they've got one now amen
[1:21:56] and what has God done God's going to
[1:21:57] turn right around and give you all want
[1:21:59] where you can start having special
[1:22:01] meetings that we ain't had in years
[1:22:03] because Lynn had room to have them we're
[1:22:05] going to be able to get together and eat
[1:22:07] and have Fellowship together because we
[1:22:09] ain't been able to do it and people want
[1:22:11] to get mad let them get mad
[1:22:15] let him get mad if they want to but
[1:22:18] we'll shout right through that new place
[1:22:20] we'll sit there and have fellowship and
[1:22:23] we'll have meetings and Shout right on
[1:22:25] end of the body chain
[1:22:32] then when we get done
[1:22:34] they can have it
[1:22:39] hey it's fine with me if the Lord comes
[1:22:41] and we don't get to have the first
[1:22:42] service amen that's exactly right that's
[1:22:45] the way I feel about it ain't you
[1:22:49] and they cried when they saw the smoke
[1:22:54] of her burning
[1:22:56] you talking about a bunch of reprobates
[1:22:59] instead of it terrifying them
[1:23:02] and them saying Oh God have mercy on me
[1:23:04] have mercy on me God I'm so sorry
[1:23:07] but instead of being sorry they're sorry
[1:23:10] they ain't gonna get no more money
[1:23:14] who's gonna buy all these rosaries in
[1:23:17] the priest
[1:23:18] who's gonna buy all this oh no no no how
[1:23:21] am I going to make my money your money
[1:23:23] won't be worth anything left to have the
[1:23:25] mark in your hand or your forehead
[1:23:31] and they cried when they saw the smoke
[1:23:34] of her burning saying what city what
[1:23:37] city
[1:23:39] is likened to this great City
[1:23:42] and they cast dust on their heads and
[1:23:45] cry weeping and wailing
[1:23:49] single last all I ask
[1:23:53] now you see if they would have weeped
[1:23:55] and wailed down on an altar of
[1:23:57] repentance
[1:23:59] they wouldn't have been in the
[1:24:00] tribulation period
[1:24:03] hey you're going to weep and wail one
[1:24:05] way or another
[1:24:06] let me do it on this side
[1:24:12] oh my
[1:24:13] wherein we were made rich
[1:24:16] all that had ships in the sea by reason
[1:24:19] of our costliness for in one hour as she
[1:24:23] made desolate
[1:24:25] ah
[1:24:27] but now we hear another voice
[1:24:33] so the scene changes and the echo is not
[1:24:37] now coming from those merchants on the
[1:24:39] Earth
[1:24:40] but we'll hear another voice
[1:24:43] sing something totally different
[1:24:46] this voice says
[1:24:48] rejoice
[1:24:50] over her thou heaven
[1:24:57] and ye Holy Apostles
[1:24:59] and Prophets
[1:25:01] for God
[1:25:03] hath Avenged you
[1:25:07] on her
[1:25:12] crying lamenting
[1:25:15] sadness they're so tore up they're
[1:25:17] throwing dust all over theirself oh man
[1:25:18] they're just squalling and screaming and
[1:25:20] hollering and carrying on and they get
[1:25:22] so beside themselves they just get down
[1:25:23] on the ground and just talk to them
[1:25:25] they'll say oh oh no oh no and the
[1:25:29] device comes out of Heaven says Rich
[1:25:31] eyes
[1:25:36] but I want you to notice
[1:25:38] where the instruction goes to for them
[1:25:41] to Rejoice from
[1:25:43] Aaron didn't tell him these crying
[1:25:44] babies this they won't rejoice know-how
[1:25:47] but there's got to be a special people
[1:25:49] and apparently they were in heaven
[1:25:51] notice this Rejoice over her thou Heaven
[1:25:56] amen why there ain't none of the
[1:25:58] election done on the earth to cry in
[1:26:00] lament whale
[1:26:02] Rejoice over her thou heaven and your
[1:26:04] Holy Apostles and Prophets for God hath
[1:26:08] Avenged you on her you see there's three
[1:26:11] times that heaven is told to Rejoice
[1:26:16] three times that heaven is told to
[1:26:21] Rejoice Revelation chapter 12 verse 12
[1:26:24] whenever Satan is cast out Heaven is
[1:26:28] told to Rejoice I hope you don't think
[1:26:32] this is strange but it's amazing how the
[1:26:34] correlation of things in the heavens and
[1:26:36] the Earth and sometimes it'll match and
[1:26:39] it'll be identical but this is opposites
[1:26:41] of course that now the Vatican has been
[1:26:44] destroyed and God lets them lament and
[1:26:47] well and unless John in the vision sin
[1:26:49] and John's pinning down what he's seeing
[1:26:50] and John is seeing all types of people
[1:26:52] around the world different cultures
[1:26:53] colors and so on and he's writing it all
[1:26:55] down Us by the vision he sees him in
[1:26:57] India he sees them in Europe he sees
[1:26:59] them all over everywhere and they're
[1:27:01] weeping and they're crying under
[1:27:02] lamenting and John's just rotting it
[1:27:04] down in the vision and then John hears a
[1:27:06] voice apparently coming out of heaven
[1:27:08] and that voice says Rejoice heaven
[1:27:12] Rejoice you heavens and rejoice you
[1:27:16] apostles
[1:27:17] and Prophets
[1:27:19] where were the apostles in heaven
[1:27:22] where are the prophets in heaven
[1:27:25] Oh Glory
[1:27:27] notice on the first time that the
[1:27:29] heavens is told to Rejoice is when Satan
[1:27:31] is cast out oh glory to God when literal
[1:27:36] Babylon is destroyed as we just read in
[1:27:38] Revelation 18 20 and when the marriage
[1:27:41] of the Lamb has come which is revelation
[1:27:44] 19 7. in these three instances which are
[1:27:49] all-time signs of the end time that when
[1:27:53] Satan is kicked out the bride goes up
[1:27:55] and the Devil comes down and Heaven
[1:27:58] starts shouting and praising God
[1:28:00] all glory to God the redeemed of all the
[1:28:03] ages are coming home so what do they do
[1:28:05] in Heaven Must say well glory to God
[1:28:07] here comes the bride well Hallelujah
[1:28:09] she's finally making her home the Lord
[1:28:11] God is so excited himself and he's so
[1:28:13] tore up he said go ahead and Shout y'all
[1:28:16] go ahead and start rejoicing here comes
[1:28:18] my sweetheart here comes the real Queen
[1:28:21] of Heaven here comes the real one that
[1:28:24] will not be a widow here's one that'll
[1:28:26] not get the atomic bomb she got the Holy
[1:28:29] Ghost by Supernatural atomics and he
[1:28:31] changed her soul it changed her attitude
[1:28:34] it changed her dress it changed her
[1:28:37] behavior it changed her and now it has
[1:28:40] changed her body so Heavens rejoice
[1:28:44] can you imagine from one side of Heaven
[1:28:46] to the other the heavens start rejoicing
[1:28:49] because the bride's coming home
[1:28:52] praise God
[1:28:55] oh
[1:29:00] you see the men of the Earth
[1:29:03] the unregenerate men
[1:29:05] the men that are not in touch
[1:29:08] with God from the inner man of the Soul
[1:29:12] they will always have a different
[1:29:13] Viewpoint than God
[1:29:16] and this is where we as the people of
[1:29:18] God must be so careful
[1:29:20] you see Satan being cast out of heaven
[1:29:23] Heaven rejoice
[1:29:25] but the Earth mourned
[1:29:29] Heaven's rejoicing and the Earth is
[1:29:32] mourning Babylon is destroyed the city
[1:29:35] Babylon is destroyed again Heaven is
[1:29:39] rejoicing
[1:29:41] and the Earth is Mourning
[1:29:44] oh my goodness
[1:29:46] you see the Judgment of God is the
[1:29:50] Vindication of righteousness
[1:29:53] ah I didn't figure I'd get no amens on
[1:29:56] that
[1:29:57] the Judgment of God is the Vindication
[1:30:01] of righteousness
[1:30:05] you see the voice that speaks out of
[1:30:08] heaven gives them a Direction You Holy
[1:30:12] Apostles and Prophets for God hath
[1:30:15] Avenged you
[1:30:17] on her
[1:30:19] notice in Revelation 18 24 and in her
[1:30:22] was found the blood of prophets and of
[1:30:25] saints and of all that were slain upon
[1:30:29] the Earth you see there's another reason
[1:30:32] for her destruction despite the luxury
[1:30:34] and the wealth
[1:30:37] it's because she's guilty of killing the
[1:30:39] people of God
[1:30:45] oh my
[1:30:46] God now blood
[1:30:48] is given for her to drink
[1:30:53] Lord Jesus
[1:30:55] I'll say friends
[1:30:57] myself
[1:31:00] I don't desire to have any laid to my
[1:31:03] account
[1:31:04] or my record
[1:31:07] that I have hindered
[1:31:10] or made it harder
[1:31:12] or increase the burden
[1:31:15] or the difficulty
[1:31:17] for one of the least
[1:31:19] of God's children
[1:31:22] God forbid that my life or yours
[1:31:26] would be crowned
[1:31:28] and saying that you made it so hard
[1:31:32] for the people of God
[1:31:34] you inflicted such hardship and caused
[1:31:37] such difficulty
[1:31:39] I want to do the opposite myself
[1:31:42] don't you I don't want to increase
[1:31:44] people's burdens I I don't want to make
[1:31:46] it harder on the people of God I want to
[1:31:49] make it easier if I can
[1:31:52] notice now we move from revelation 18.
[1:31:57] to Revelation 19 1.
[1:32:00] um
[1:32:01] and after
[1:32:03] these
[1:32:04] things
[1:32:06] I heard
[1:32:08] a great voice
[1:32:11] of much people
[1:32:13] in heaven
[1:32:15] saying hallelujah
[1:32:19] salvation
[1:32:21] and Glory and honor and Power
[1:32:26] unto the Lord
[1:32:28] our God
[1:32:31] Hallelujah
[1:32:33] Hallelujah
[1:32:36] I find this so amazing the use of this
[1:32:38] word hallelujah
[1:32:41] it's used in the Old Testament mainly in
[1:32:44] the Book of Psalms
[1:32:46] use nowhere in the New Testament
[1:32:49] except the Book of Revelation
[1:32:53] and the Jews say that the Psalms are
[1:32:55] divided into ten different types of
[1:32:59] songs
[1:33:00] but the word hallelujah
[1:33:03] is the perfect unification
[1:33:06] of the name yah
[1:33:09] along with praise
[1:33:11] so in the Old Testament one of us said
[1:33:14] Hallelujah it was praise yah remember
[1:33:18] David was the first one to write that
[1:33:19] whenever he said he is known by his name
[1:33:23] yah j a h remember reading that in the
[1:33:26] Book of Psalms so here then when David
[1:33:29] would use the word hallelujah he's
[1:33:32] bringing in together praise yah Matthew
[1:33:36] never mentioned it Mark Paul never
[1:33:38] mentioned it John never mentioned it
[1:33:39] until right now hey man so right at the
[1:33:44] very end after the bride is taken up for
[1:33:49] great hallelujahs are going to be
[1:33:52] expressed
[1:33:53] case you understand Heaven has been
[1:33:56] awaiting this hour I know we look at it
[1:34:00] every day we say yes it's awful it's a
[1:34:02] terrible day to live it it is but the
[1:34:04] heavens have been waiting for this time
[1:34:06] God has been waiting for this time to
[1:34:10] come on the earth and he reserved those
[1:34:12] four
[1:34:13] hallelujahs right for the time of the
[1:34:16] Rapture and The Time Of Satan coming
[1:34:19] down and the bride going up and the body
[1:34:22] change it is a great Memorial event in
[1:34:25] heaven oh praise the Lord how the
[1:34:28] heavens are under anticipation remember
[1:34:31] the prophet dentists in the church age
[1:34:32] book that the gates of pearl had already
[1:34:34] been hung the streets of gold had
[1:34:37] already been created now you can imagine
[1:34:39] when Jesus said there's Saint John 14
[1:34:41] open don't lose you here but the heaven
[1:34:43] the bride is going to had not yet been
[1:34:46] created when the Lord Jesus was here
[1:34:48] remember the heavens that existed Satan
[1:34:52] had been able to go into the nether
[1:34:53] parts of those Heavens but the place
[1:34:56] that the bride is going to live there
[1:34:58] ain't been one devil footprint ever been
[1:35:00] on them streets and Jesus did not say
[1:35:03] I'm going back to the city I prepared
[1:35:06] but I'm going away to prepare a place
[1:35:10] for you your home was non-existent when
[1:35:14] he was here
[1:35:16] Oh Glory to God that's why when the
[1:35:18] prophet preached the future home it was
[1:35:20] so astounding to him because God began
[1:35:23] to show him things that Paul was not
[1:35:25] allowed to preach Peter was not allowed
[1:35:27] to preach and he said the gates had
[1:35:29] already been hung the streets of gold
[1:35:31] had already been created Jesus has been
[1:35:34] there he said for many thousands of
[1:35:36] years creating that City and he tells us
[1:35:39] on the church Saints book that the
[1:35:41] angels are sending their breathlessly
[1:35:48] wow
[1:35:50] waiting for the inhabitants of that City
[1:35:53] to throng those streets
[1:35:58] no wonder they had a spell they've been
[1:36:00] holding their breath a long time
[1:36:02] [Laughter]
[1:36:04] oh you think that you long to see him
[1:36:08] what if you was in his shoes as we'd say
[1:36:12] and from before the foundation of the
[1:36:14] world
[1:36:15] you had these thoughts
[1:36:18] I wanted people
[1:36:20] there will be like me
[1:36:24] they will love me they will serve me
[1:36:28] they will choose me over evil and Rome
[1:36:31] there'll be a tribe people
[1:36:33] and what if you would long for that type
[1:36:36] of people if we could measure time say
[1:36:38] billions of years ago
[1:36:41] you had this and it was your desire
[1:36:44] and you started speaking and said let
[1:36:47] there be let there be but you didn't
[1:36:48] make them first
[1:36:50] you started making a home from the
[1:36:52] living
[1:36:53] and you started laying out your program
[1:36:55] and you thought it all through from the
[1:36:58] very beginning because you're this being
[1:37:00] that's called The Eternal and you've
[1:37:02] never had a new salt I don't know about
[1:37:04] you I can't relate to that
[1:37:07] I'm always undoing or redoing stuff that
[1:37:09] I've done before are you all and then
[1:37:11] you do something you say well I wish I
[1:37:13] thought of that yesterday that saved me
[1:37:14] so much time that'd been so much easier
[1:37:16] if I've done this I thought God ain't
[1:37:18] never had a new thought God said you
[1:37:19] know what I think I'll do this and look
[1:37:20] back and say man a lot I wish I'd done
[1:37:22] that yesterday because God had never had
[1:37:24] a new salt but he's been waiting for
[1:37:27] those thoughts to be made manifest and
[1:37:29] whenever the heaven starts saying this
[1:37:30] happen the heavens start having a holy
[1:37:32] ghost Revival I mean they just go to
[1:37:35] Hallelujah and praising God what in the
[1:37:37] world is going on the inhabitants of the
[1:37:39] city are moving in
[1:37:42] oh my goodness can you imagine the
[1:37:44] anticipation some of y'all when you
[1:37:45] build a new house and you've been made
[1:37:47] this decision and that decision I hate
[1:37:49] decisions
[1:37:50] I've had to make thousands of them in
[1:37:52] our new facility and all that I'll be so
[1:37:54] glad when the last one is made and we
[1:37:57] can move in and say praise the Lord this
[1:37:59] is our home I'm so excited about it but
[1:38:02] can you imagine Angelic beings that have
[1:38:04] been there for a hundred million years
[1:38:07] and they saw this out of him and they
[1:38:09] see with the anticipation when he come
[1:38:12] back up to heaven and they said watch
[1:38:13] Angels I'm making my wife a new place to
[1:38:16] live
[1:38:17] and they stood there and all because
[1:38:19] they were the only remember the prophet
[1:38:20] said the first thing that he made was
[1:38:22] Angels so the Angels stood there as they
[1:38:24] saw the spin-off of the universe always
[1:38:26] somebody preached with me right now they
[1:38:28] stood there and they watched them as
[1:38:29] time come into existence and they saw
[1:38:31] across the horrors on a rainbow and
[1:38:33] across a cycle of light and God spoke
[1:38:35] and said let there be let there be let
[1:38:37] there be let there be and they stood
[1:38:39] there and awe
[1:38:46] but they hadn't seen him create
[1:38:49] for millennia
[1:38:52] until he went back
[1:38:54] to his Earthly visited
[1:39:00] and he said
[1:39:01] I'm going to be on a building program
[1:39:06] glory to God
[1:39:09] A New Earth a new star
[1:39:13] a new city on that blue dot
[1:39:18] that little speck of dust
[1:39:20] that I just came back from
[1:39:24] that's what I want to spend
[1:39:26] rest
[1:39:29] om with my little virgin
[1:39:37] and when the heavens and the angels
[1:39:40] see all this coming they say
[1:39:42] she's here
[1:39:45] so they see him get up from the father's
[1:39:47] throne
[1:39:49] and he's got on this Priestly garment it
[1:39:51] says where
[1:39:52] and the same stand their father forgive
[1:39:54] them for they don't know what to do
[1:39:56] father forgives them for they don't know
[1:39:57] what to do and our sins coming up as a
[1:40:00] word hitting him in the faith father
[1:40:01] forgive them they don't know what to do
[1:40:02] but they hear the Silence of the Lamb
[1:40:05] and he's not saying no more father
[1:40:07] forgives them
[1:40:08] and they seem step back behind the
[1:40:10] curtain as it was and he takes off the
[1:40:12] priesthood garment and he comes out in
[1:40:14] his robes and he has to die dim in his
[1:40:16] hand
[1:40:18] I missed it
[1:40:19] today's the day
[1:40:23] it's going home to her
[1:40:27] they're moving in
[1:40:30] they're moving in don't call U-Haul but
[1:40:34] call you you
[1:40:36] amen you will take your body to meet

[1:41:21] Oh Glory
[1:41:25] and after these things
[1:41:28] oh
[1:41:30] I'd like to take a text from that
[1:41:31] sometime
[1:41:32] after these things
[1:41:35] the gym after our tests and our trials
[1:41:38] our valleys
[1:41:40] all the things we go through
[1:41:42] after these things
[1:41:45] I heard a great voice of much people in
[1:41:48] heaven
[1:41:49] saying Allelujah
[1:41:51] salvation
[1:41:53] and Glory
[1:41:54] and honor and Power
[1:41:57] unto the Lord
[1:41:59] our God
[1:42:01] you notice these folks wasn't
[1:42:02] trinitarians
[1:42:04] and said the Lord our gods
[1:42:11] imagine the trinitarian folks there'll
[1:42:14] be some of them that'll make sure they
[1:42:15] will you imagine whenever they get there
[1:42:17] and they go looking around and said
[1:42:18] where's the other two
[1:42:22] if you read the book of Revelation John
[1:42:23] give you a little extra after that he
[1:42:25] said I saw a throne
[1:42:27] he never says nothing about Sin 3. I saw
[1:42:30] Ace wrong and one that said on that
[1:42:32] Throne I preached that years ago down in
[1:42:34] Texas oh my goodness they throwed me out
[1:42:39] because I told him just a little some
[1:42:41] symbol some other says there's another
[1:42:43] God in heaven
[1:42:44] he's sitting on the floor if he's other
[1:42:46] than Jesus because John only saw one God
[1:42:49] and one throne
[1:42:51] well it didn't take long for the elders
[1:42:53] and all of them together and the back
[1:42:54] doesn't have a little meeting
[1:42:56] they put me out
[1:42:58] that's all I'd have been thought about
[1:42:59] better places
[1:43:04] oh can you imagine Saints
[1:43:07] they said the Lord God
[1:43:09] the Lord our God Hallelujah
[1:43:13] salvation and honor and Power
[1:43:16] while they're praising him the merchants
[1:43:19] on the Earth
[1:43:21] who's gonna buy my pumpkins now who's
[1:43:23] gonna buy my converters who's going to
[1:43:25] buy my gold let's go
[1:43:27] God has annihilated this entity and
[1:43:30] they're still weeping and crying
[1:43:32] and if it weren't for the grace of God
[1:43:34] one of them people
[1:43:36] Might Have Been Me
[1:43:38] oh yeah
[1:43:41] but God opened our eyes
[1:43:46] now saying all this tonight
[1:43:48] we don't hate any of those people
[1:43:51] if you hate anybody in that system
[1:43:53] you've not yet entered into the King's
[1:43:55] life
[1:43:57] we love them we pray for them
[1:43:59] that God will help him and open their
[1:44:01] eyes
[1:44:03] but I'm so glad when this world is
[1:44:04] rocking and shaking
[1:44:07] will we praise in the Lord
[1:44:09] for myself this is one reason why I
[1:44:11] don't want to wait to get to heaven I
[1:44:13] don't have to go into a practice room to
[1:44:14] start practicing saying hallelujah about

[1:44:18] good at it

[1:44:28] omnipotent
[1:44:30] I'm going to be ready I'm going to step
[1:44:32] right out of this Dimension into another

[1:45:12] Honor under our King he is worthy thou
[1:45:15] alone are worthy O Lord
[1:45:23] Lord Jesus
[1:45:26] thank you to not for your word
[1:45:29] thank you Father
[1:45:33] Lord It's not that we are betters there
[1:45:35] anything about us it's
[1:45:37] any better than any other Mortal
[1:45:40] It's Your Grace
[1:45:42] show Mercy to us
[1:45:45] Heavenly Father
[1:45:47] we love you tonight
[1:45:50] thank you for your truth
[1:45:54] Lord as the prophet said it years ago
[1:45:55] when he was here it was three minutes to
[1:45:57] midnight
[1:46:00] I wonder how close we are to that
[1:46:04] Lord I'm so glad I took care of there
[1:46:06] that I am so glad I'm not looking to
[1:46:08] politics
[1:46:09] I'm so glad I'm not looking to our
[1:46:11] pentagon
[1:46:13] I'm so glad that I'm not looking at our
[1:46:15] nuclear achievements because Russia and
[1:46:17] China boasts both
[1:46:19] have successfully built Hypersonic
[1:46:22] missiles that we have absolutely nothing
[1:46:24] to shoot them down with
[1:46:27] that can travel so fast that could be
[1:46:30] right on us and would never even know it
[1:46:34] but thank you Lord Jesus
[1:46:36] we are hitting you
[1:46:39] praise the Lord
[1:46:41] I'm so grateful Heavenly Father
[1:46:43] that we have rallied around and with
[1:46:47] the true Queen
[1:46:49] so therefore we will not be left wailing
[1:46:51] and mourning and crying
[1:46:53] when the queen of the earth is killed
[1:46:55] and destroyed and annihilated the
[1:46:58] merchants the Kings the rulers the
[1:46:59] dictators will be weeping and crime
[1:47:03] because we have been called by the
[1:47:05] spirit of God
[1:47:06] to be identified with sobriety
[1:47:09] the true Queen
[1:47:11] the true Esther
[1:47:15] as her cousin Mordecai told her
[1:47:17] who is to say
[1:47:19] that you were called
[1:47:21] for such a Time
[1:47:23] as this
[1:47:25] we O Lord God have been called No Doubt
[1:47:29] for such a time as this
[1:47:31] had we lived in the days of Noah would
[1:47:34] have helped built the ark
[1:47:36] had with them in the days of Luther we
[1:47:38] would have been with him Wesley but for
[1:47:41] some reason you chose for us to live in
[1:47:44] the last stage
[1:47:45] may we be faithful may we be true
[1:47:48] may we be identified with your word Lord
[1:47:52] so when you're a queen leaves this world
[1:47:55] we will leave with her
[1:47:58] oh Hallelujah
[1:48:00] come Lord Jesus
[1:48:02] come take us away father
[1:48:06] politics is rotten the churches are
[1:48:09] rotten going to the dogs going to Sodom
[1:48:13] come Lord Jesus
[1:48:15] maybe there's a Soul over an African
[1:48:18] gone and Nigeria Poland we don't know
[1:48:20] where they are bring them in Lord bring
[1:48:23] them to maturity yes
[1:48:24] so we can leave this place father
[1:48:28] Grant it Lord Jesus
[1:48:30] it's perfectly fine with us if we never
[1:48:32] get to have one service in our new place
[1:48:35] if our last service is the Holiday Inn
[1:48:39] and we move out of the Holiday Inn
[1:48:42] Oh Glory to God
[1:48:44] into the greatest place it's ever built
[1:48:48] we know Lord
[1:48:50] that the bride has got an invitation
[1:48:52] to the largest use meeting that's ever
[1:48:56] been on the Earth
[1:48:58] or in heaven
[1:49:00] only young people can go
[1:49:03] and then we're going to live
[1:49:04] in a gated community
[1:49:07] praise God
[1:49:10] those big Gates hung with pearl
[1:49:13] and the saints of God living all up and
[1:49:16] down that City
[1:49:17] Chihuahua's 216 feet tall
[1:49:20] build on that angle of descent ascent
[1:49:23] and descent where it's just like a
[1:49:25] slight incline
[1:49:27] in the Water of Life running over out of
[1:49:29] our yards and trickling down in our
[1:49:30] neighbor's yard and on down on down on
[1:49:32] down until it recirculates back to the
[1:49:34] top of that Great Pyramid Mountain 1500
[1:49:37] miles high
[1:49:40] then Lord our burdens our troubles our
[1:49:42] sorrows
[1:49:43] Oh They'll roll away they'll seem as
[1:49:45] nothing
[1:49:47] encourage her children tonight Lord Heal
[1:49:49] the sick
[1:49:51] father left those that are down and
[1:49:53] weary
[1:49:54] we love you tonight Jesus
[1:49:56] We Worship You Lord God
[1:49:59] don't you love him tonight Saints
[1:50:02] don't you just want to love him and
[1:50:04] thank him for his Mercy to you
[1:50:07] think we'll be beating up brother Lou if
[1:50:09] it wasn't for the grace of God
[1:50:11] if it wasn't for the grace of the Lord
[1:50:13] to call me no doubt I'd still be out
[1:50:14] there in Pentecost Brother Louie brother

[1:50:21] Pentecostal church and boy really
[1:50:24] blessing their people and just as blind
[1:50:26] as we were in laodicea
[1:50:28] but the mercy of God
[1:50:30] and the grace of God
[1:50:32] remember when that Mighty Commander come
[1:50:34] down to Joshua it was during that time
[1:50:36] frame that Rahab the Harlot heard her
[1:50:39] name called
[1:50:41] praise the Lord
[1:50:43] we didn't need a commander that would
[1:50:45] come and tell us how to March Down the
[1:50:46] Walls of Jericho but we needed one to
[1:50:49] come and how did ours come
[1:50:51] with an open book in his hands of
[1:50:53] Revelation 10 1.
[1:50:55] that's right we didn't need just a bush
[1:50:57] being on fire but we needed a book open
[1:51:00] to help us to see who we truly were
[1:51:05] aren't you glad you've heard your
[1:51:06] identity called out of the book
[1:51:09] Harry's saying something divorced let's
