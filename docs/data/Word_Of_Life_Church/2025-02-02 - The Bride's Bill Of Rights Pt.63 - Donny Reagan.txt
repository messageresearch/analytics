for her because as Paul said we sorrow not as others who have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again them which also sleep in Jesus will God bring with him when he comes but the sad part about is is that big old hole right in your heart that nobody else in the world can ever be able to feel so we certainly want to remember brother Bill and the family and the church family as well service tomorrow evening and then Barrel on Tuesday and and then when everybody goes back home brother bill has to go back home by himself the SI siblings have to go back in their directions and try to find a new normaly just because we say our goodbyes and extend our condolences while while it's going on we certainly don't need to stop praying then do we no amen but we're longing for the day when the last Saint will pass away when the you know what sister sh's funeral might be the last one we'll ever have but if it ain't it's coming when death will be swallowed up in Victory hallelujah thank God Amen we certainly welcome to be with us here today and uh let's let's just continue to pray for him if you would let's turn to Second Peter today if you would chapter 1 verse two we greet you today in the name of the Lord Jesus what an honor it is forc to be gathered to GA in the house of the Lord and so appreciate the presence of God grateful that he's a help to us in the time of need amen second Peter 1 verse 2 as we read these words today I want you to keep in mind that they were pinned by a man that was identified as ignorant and unlearned the Lord must have got a hold to this old boy didn't he I sit back there reading these words before I came out and I thought wow how astounding Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness amen through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue this is what we're called to now we're not just called to come to church we're not just called to say well I'm a Christian but we're called unto glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature not Natures as imp plural but nature singular having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge let me read Janelle what this word add means the English translators chose this word they certainly didn't choose the word that would be the most U that would explode the full meaning of what Peter wrote in the Greek here notice the word that he uses for add as we would think well we add this to this and this to that and that to that but that's not the word that Peter used the word that he used was for add is Minister nourishment to supply furnish ministered unto and assisted so now listen what you do is giving all diligence so you assist to your faith or minister to your faith virtue actually in the Greek it says in the possession of your face Minister virtue look at it again now verse five and beside this giving all diligence add or minister to your face virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity so it's like once each of these virtues are assumed it becomes the stepping stone for the next virtue so you come from Faith then it opens up into virtue then from virtue into Knowledge from knowledge into Temperance so once you've achieved faith it becomes a ministering Channel and the latter in turn actually qualifies and completes the former so add to your faith virtue so then it completes faith and then it ministers into the next Channel now remember there ain't nothing that you and I can do to add any of these ourselves it takes the Lord to do it and then Faith which is the one on the very bottom faith is the foundation of this all and it leads to the capping of divine Love on Top Capstone being love and me like to be remembered today as we pray God bless each of you Heavenly Father we have gathered here today Lord with Thanksgiving in our hearts and we're just so grateful that we could want once once again on this side of Eternity be gathered in the house of God you see our needs that they are many Lord we've got those that are sick that couldn't be here today we've got different needs some carrying a heavy burden brother Bill and their family Lord just with sadness and yet it's it's a mixed emotion they're so happy for our sister Shirley no more suffering and by now she's already crossed the river and met all them loved ones that she's been longing to see for so long stepped into a brand new body no more sickness no more pain no more heartache I'm sure her and Erica has already had a spell together on the other side different ones that you sent down to the river to be able to meet her Lord God our desire is that we can be faithful so we can be gathered together with them on that great today help us Lord and we believe that you've given to us from your word the things that are necessary to complete this building of the House of the Living God speak to us today from your word and show us those things that we have need of we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus amen God bless you you may be seated truly I I think that we as the people of God as we are living in the closing hours of the Gentiles history we can see all around us the politics religion governments of the world none of them can produce the answers that people are searching for a politici will arise and people will rally around him and their hopes are so high and what he's going to do and then he'll fail here and he'll fail there and fail somewhere else and they become disappointed disgruntled they go looking for another one to replace him they find a a church and they saying oh my oh my I I have arrived this this is it everybody there is so awesome and this church and this preacher and oh it's so wonderful and then the more they know him the more realize nope everybody ain't there ain't perfect yet and so what do they do they go looking for another one look for another preacher look for another church look for another something that'll satisfy but myself I was thinking about it yesterday as I was contemplating and praying about the service today that I don't think there's any Holy Ghost fill child of God on the face of the Earth no matter what what race they are what cont of the earth they are what nation they live in what nationality that they're from that will ever be totally completely satisfied in this life because there's nothing here that can ever meet that complete satisfaction but the Lord Jesus himself and you know that as well because you achieve something in your life you work and try to Arise at a certain place and once you get there it didn't produce what you thought it would and then you you set for another goal and you reach for that and say well I made it I got here I finished this this studies and I got this degree and I got that and you think I thought it would do more for me than that and there's nothing here that'll ever be able to satisfy that inside the soul but God has given us a preview of what really that we're longing for and that is that each of us can come to the spot that if we go by the way of the Grave whenever it start and moving in into sister Shirley's room where she was the other day that she don't have to scream and cry and say get death away from me I'm not ready to go but she can be able to meet man's greatest enemy and life at him and and know that God is her conqueror and her Victory you know it's quite a sing when a child of God Can Face death I've been by the bedside of many people and watched them die I've never seen one saint of God not one I've never seen one of all the decades that I've been by them that have screamed pray for me pray for me get me out of hell pull me out of the flames of fire never not one time I've never seen one Holy Ghost feel sa even though prior to entering into the channel of death they might had a little bit of Suspicion and a little bit of liness going into it but I've never seen one and I've stood there and held the hands of many of them and stand there by their mothers and fathers or wives or husbands and whatever more and then watch a smile come on their face or watch something of presence enter into the room or as it was with our sister Brown as she looked beyond the curtain of time and looked across in her last one of her last words to be said out of mortal lips wow oh wow not oh God have mercy I'm lost no a saying of God is just changing dimensions that's what they're dealing with so God is obligated to give us away by which we can be able to leave this world with old Wows on our lips instead of God have mercy I'm lost aren't you glad for that today now God anointed Peter to write about this 2,000 years ago and we've looked at it of course for years and years but it's evident Friends by the time and the season that we're in that many of us are still looking and longing and we have a Necessities in our life when we read these things and we hear the prophet talk about it that we need to move up a little higher how many can say Amen to that today that at times when our faith can be so tried and then our virtue and our knowledge and we're not talking about Earthly knowledge now it's not even theological knowledge of the word but it's a Godly knowledge which is totally different you can Ram your head full of message quotes and of scriptural quotes and you can know the Greek and the Aramaic and all that sort of thing but what good does it do if you don't know how to use that word when you're in the midst of such a storm so Godly knowledge is the knowledge that'll give you the ability to pull the right portion of the word at exactly the right moment when you need it which is a different than just human Earthly knowledge now I want you to think that God could have chosen all the different ways to be able to get his people to a place to where they'd be able to attain to this he could have chose Angels he could have wrote the Gospel on the stars and you and I would have went out on clear nights and would have looked up at the stars and we' read the Bible right there and the stars and Donnie don't do this and Fred don't do that and then Carol do this and the Stars what a hell the story and God could have chose something that would have been without flaw the stars have have maintained their place since the Lord God created them when the heavens were made but yet God shows something so frail and something so full of mistake human beings that would be flawed and yet God chose to call them and give them a gift and place them and what God called was the ministry now I was sitting thinking about it yesterday I so you know what I trust my wife to something as flawed and as faulty as preachers are now no matter how long they've been preaching how full of the Holy Ghost they are there's not a preacher on the Earth today and never has been except for Jesus himself that is free from faults free from shortcomings and they have failur and they have to Lord I'm sorry and they have to even at times get up and say hey Saints I'm so sorry I I misquoted that the other day and I I I didn't mean to or I I said this and I I app it in the wrong way and I'm real sorry and you think God would commit the greatest accomplishment that he's ever going to do outside of the death's burial and resurrection of our Lord Jesus into the hands of flawed faulty men and yet God knew exactly that every one of them preachers would be flawed from their births up they themselves as they're preaching and that's something maybe you don't realize that when a preacher is preaching he's not only preaching it to you but that word is going right in on him and it's cutting him and it's trimming him and it's helping him to get lined up as well so the same word that he's preaching many times is going to him first and the truth of it is sometimes he's already repented while he was sitting our studying before he walks up here and preaches it to you so God committed then this delivery of all the things that would be needed and we know that to God a message is such an important thing so this is why we value the word of God the Bible and the message of the hour that's been given to us let's turn and read if you would in Ephesians 4:1 and let's look for a little bit before we go into these virtues on the ministry of Jesus Christ now remember ever God called man if they're really called of God and gifted by God they have and given to them a portion of the ministry of the Lord Jesus so we say well it's brother Bill's Ministry it's brother Joel Brown's Ministry brother John brother Donnie and in one way I can see where we're coming from but in reality the ministry if if it's come from God is the ministry of Jesus Christ and the Saints said and he gave some Apostles and some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry singular now he mentioned five folds of one Ministry but then when he come down to identifying it as a Ministry he doesn't make it plural the way he makes it plural when it comes to the offices so the offices are plural but there's only one Ministry now we know every man that gets in the pull pit and preaches is not even called of God in the first place you can tell that by the way they handle the word for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so every godall preacher is given to be able to edify the body it's not to build him up it's not to lift him up it's not so that people will make a superhero out of him but actually that man is given a gift from God to be able to edify the body as a matter of fact once he receives that call and he goes to moving in that cycle God wants it to be the rest of his entire life while he's living on the earth he will be a servant to God's people is that right so he will edify so he will spend his time his life his mind his his wake hours thinking of what he can do to have how to help and benefit the people of God it's not about what can the people do for me and it's not about well how can I excel and how can I become greater you see a gift in a part of the ministry is not the same thing as being a building contractor it's not the same thing as being a certified electrician it's not the same thing as many of you that are setting to be this and that and the other and you want to keep climbing higher and higher and higher until you get to a spot to where you reach a certain pce scale and you succeed to become this and that and the other in line that's not the way it is with a godall man and they are just men only because that is what the Bible says so what they want to do they spend their whole life and giving to the Lord and they really don't even know theirself what they will wind up being they don't even know when they start out what the end of the goal will be they don't even know God calls them to be a part of the ministry they don't even know which part of the five-fold they'll be God don't give you the option okay I want you to be a preacher which one do you want God don't even ask you that he don't even ask if you want to be called he don't even ask if you want to go he don't even ask you if you want to do it or not he just says you're going to do it so you really don't have a choice so then once God begins to pull you into that cycle then you change who you are you change what you are your family around you your wife your children everything there begins to change in that direction and you get that identification now this is what Paul when he wrote about it the purpose of the ministry was till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God so again it's not the knowledge of the preacher it's not the knowledge of how big the church is how much money do they have how many members do they have but it's the knowledge of the Son of God so apparently there's more to the knowledge of the Son of God than just knowing he come to the Earth to die for Sinners he raised from the dead ascended up on high he's our high priest because if that's so then the preacher ini isue tell us tells you that in John 3:16 and there's nothing else to know unless of course we're talking about a knowledge which is nosis now remember the Greeks looked at knowledge as just something that you constantly increased and it might make you a better person but it might not so that was nosis that was the word they Ed so your knowledge might puff you up which is what Paul talked about but the way the Jews looked at knowledge was that real Divine knowledge was something that you did learn and you accumulated in your mind but that knowledge if it was divine knowledge it actually changed you and it made you a better person more into the image of what God wanted you to be that's the kind of knowledge I want now watch Paul said unto a perfect man again singular not plural so the image then is not even the church A's Messengers in the day that God would raise up a church A's messenger than the people under that Ministry would be called to look like that messenger or be like that messenger no there's only one perfect man and that is nobody's Church age messenger that is nobody's Pastor nobody's favorite evangelist there's only one perfect man and that's the Lord Jesus and the church said so there is a perfect man unto the measure of the stature so again I spoke to you about it last week that God took his Divine measuring tape and he measured the image of the Lord Jesus which was projected by prophecy so he'll be a lamb he'll be a conqueror he'll be a lion he'll be a king he'll be a servant but all of them must be in divine order which is where the Jews got it all messed up they looking for a mighty conqueror to come first but God haded in the right order the baby preceded the mighty conquer so it totally confused them to understand what God was doing so God then me measured the stature of a perfect man and as far as humanly he was a little guy maybe 120 lbs 5T something the Lord Jesus I'm talking about a little man small in frame and the prophet saw him several times in visions and visitations he was not a great big man I always found that to be amazing to me that when he saw the angel of God he would talk about you know being a larger man but when he saw the Lord Jesus he was a smaller man now most of us that think God God would always be bigger than his angels because it's the way that we understand greatness and big but that's not the way God looks at it so you imagine that here a bigger man walks up when he's there in Green Mill in the cave and yet when he sees the Lord Jesus standing right ABR The Sage Brush field he sees a smaller man than the angel of God that's a big man right there now what so God measured this perfect man so what did he measure him by well there was sign there was wonders there was Supernatural all that was inclusive of course but he also measured character he measured brotherly kindness he measured Faith he measured virtue so God uses this Divine measuring tape and then Peter catches it which I find it amazing that Peter wasn't even the church age messenger and yet Paul never mentioned these virtues Paul never mentioned them together in a group in the way that Peter did and yet whenever it come right down to it Peter there was things that he wrote and he said there was things that Paul wrote about that he said was many times hard to be understood and yet God chose Peter as the one to be able to pin this part down about the virtues now if you're listening to it of course in stue of a perfect man Blasphemous names also in ordination which is also again in 1962 and then he mentions it again a little bit on down while begin organized religion so it's a scope a span of time of about four weeks three or four weeks something there that he'll refer back to it now something if you're listen to that let me just make known to you that whenever you're listening to that cycle it's a cycle in in the prophet's life to where that he's looking at the new birth maybe some of you have already called it if not after I mention you will of course that he he's looking at the new birth and at that time frame he thinks the new birth is when you first repent and give your heart to God so whenever he preaches the statue of her perfect man Blasphemous names the paragraph that he mentions in that night service ordination whenever you mention why I'm against organized religion he will lay out of where he's at on the new births so he says that the foundation of that and the new births he believed as a matter of fact you can go almost to the end of 62 and he said I thought I was the only one that believed us this way until I heard Charles Fuller this morning talk about it and he said that he believed that the new birth was being born again and then receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost was for power come on but if you studied the message and you watch as that message kept unfolding the prophet realized you're not truly converted until you get the Holy Ghost amen you see this is one reason I can follow a man like this because he grew in his understanding and he was not afraid to let us know about can you and I do the same thing you see real true Christians can only speak what we know and we speak it with all of our heart but remember what was Revelation and 47 was Revelation and 65 and all God can do is keep adding to the Revelation and and you know give more information about it but it never changes But as God was revealing this to him so when you listen to this and then you say oh my goodness it sound sounds like that brother bam is saying that you don't get the Holy Ghost until you get all this here well I'm telling you one thing if you can get all these virtues without the Holy Ghost I'm not sure why you'd even need the Holy Ghost unless it's just to make you shout pretty good but realize where he's at when he's bringing it and then be able to go along and be able to progress in the Revelation I know a lot of message folks don't like to hear that but remember I'm called to tell you the Full Gospel I don't want to just slice a little here and a little there I want to be able to bring the Full Gospel y'all want that type of gospel preaching now watch so the stature of a perfect man is not a church aged messenger it is not a pastor but it is the Lord Jesus now notice what Paul in the contrast of what he projected to them about where they were now remember the Ephesian church is one of the deeper churches in the New Testament he could write to them about election predestination all kinds of great deep things never had to talk to them about gifts or nothing like that because they had it all in order but they were still immature in their knowledge of where they needed to be in the kingdom of God now watch how verse 14 contrasts that that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine so there were Believers here in the Ephesian church that were still being moved about and that'd follow this preacher and that preacher and that preacher it's always been that way and it'll be that way to the end time so Paul is telling them look this is why you need the ministry to be able to help you settle you down oh but you say brother Donny preachers are some of the main ones that cause all these things why of course they are whenever Satan looked at what God was doing Satan said that's a great idea what if God's got pastors I want me some God's got evangelists I want me some God's got teachers I want me some for everything that God chooses Satan has an impersonator or a copy which is off the word am well sure and he saw what God was going to do he didn't know this initial remember there was not teachers like this in the Old Testament there wasn't pastors like the New Testament had but Satan watched it and it took him a little b a little bit to see the pattern as it began to unfold and once he saw the pattern he started doing the same thing that's why Paul would write in the book of Corinthians and say that Satan can transform his ministers as Ministers of righteousness and Satan himself can appear as an angel of Light don't ever forget this Satan is the master of impersonation so he will impersonate like God he will impersonate like Angels he will have his preachers to impersonate as real Godly men and the church said that's right but now notice so and that doesn't do away with the real and the genuine so he says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men notice slight of men cutting craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceit well by this time of course Satan had already started using preachers so there was preachers that raised up and where do you figure they come out from under remember there were no Baptist Churches Methodist churches Church of God Church of Christ there were none of them by the time this was written around 55 ad there were no a Pentecostal churches there was no Nazarene churches so when you talked about a church there wasn't hardly any at all the original Church actually started on 33 ad and of course later on in the day there was some people that heard the message of Acts chapter 2: 38 and they were added to the church but the Bible says nothing about them getting the Holy Ghost and the prophet tells us that that Spirit of antichrist started right there on the day of Pentecost just like the bride was born the bride got the Holy Ghost and them other folks just become members of a church so initially if you would if they would have had a church building there was only one original church so there was no Church of God Church of the Nazarene the first church the second Church the Third Church so if you saw a church that was only the original then before long there popped up another one on down the road and then another one you know in another country and another one here and another one there and what was Satan doing impersonating what God had done originally how you going to be able to tell them apart because the true spirit of God will always come back to the word and never deny one word at all amen is that right so by this time frame it it it would be hard for the Ephesian Christians today if they would be able to be transported into the year of 2025 and they would have been coming to church here today or say going to brother bills wherever it would be that they would be going on a Sunday morning and they would have passed all the host of Baptist churches on their way to say here or wherever they were going Nazarene churches Church of God Assembly of God Church of God in Christ Church of Christ Catholic Lutheran Presbyterian and they would have passed all of these buildings with all these different signs and they would have drove by and looked at him think what in the world where did all these places come from where did all these come from in their day they never had to deal with that there was only just a few and then as it began to go along then the false Church began to explode and before you know it there's more of them than there was the bride and they out run then there become divisions then among the real bride move and then they started saying well I I'm a Paul and others say not me I'm of sephus which was Peter and I I'm of Apollos well now the splits started coming in around the message itself praise the Lord and then there was another group was said well I'm not a Paul and I'm not of Peter and I'm not of Apollos but I'm of Christ so in other words they didn't believe in going to church at all they didn't believe in even a Ministry because they just said I've got a direct contact to Christ and I don't even need no preacher at all well according to Ephesians 5 that was exactly out of the order of God praise the Lord now notice what he says in verse 15 but speaking the truth in love and as just mentioned to you last Sunday so it's totally possible that a preacher could preach the truth yet not do it with the right measure of Love is that right speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him look at this word in increase to become greater oh that's what we all want to be isn't it to be greater greater in the image of God not number-wise now I'm talking about in the image of God grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together now watch Paul takes the anatomy of a human body so you can imagine now if I would be able to remove this part of my arm from here down now why is it that my arm works so perfectly where it is now as I'm getting older and I'm getting a few more aches and pains sometimes it don't work so perfectly like it used to but God so designed it that my this part four part of my arm would be able to fit right here and the joint is made exactly where it needs to fit now what if I would say you know what I wonder if I would be better off to take from here down of my leg and stick it right up here here and I wonder if if I would be better wouldn't I be stronger in my arms if I did that it won't fit it won't work the joints don't line up so the ball on one part does not match the hollow on the other part and God knows exactly where to place each one of us so what if I would tape my little finger look at that little joint ain't that amazing ain't that awesome that God did that would it be really weird if our hands did this all the time would it be really strange if we never had no joints and nothing that would B but who did that our father it's the same way in the church and you realize God wants us not to compromise with sin but God wants us as the children of God to have the ability to bend every now and then and for the sake of peace and unity and so on and so on and the church said now watch the way Paul aligns this for whom the whole body fitly joined together fitly so in other words it fits so what if what if I would take this and and go to a surgeon tomorrow and say sir you know what I I've been thinking about it a lot and really I I think I would like to take from here down and put it right there and just have this wee wee tiny little for would that look really cool oh it wouldn't it look really deformed but why because it would not be fitly joined together now with everything they can do today they might be able to actually do it but I would be so strange I would look so bizarre and so deformed because I would be why because God never intended for that joint to fit right there well you know when you find your place in Christ Jesus and you know where they are does it really matter what size you are does it really matter what size you are whether you're this joint or that joint or that joint or this joint or this joint here I said well I I'm not as big I'm not as big well you know what I'm I'm sort of glad that my finger finger joints ain't as big as my hip joint my goodness you imagine what hands you'd have if your finger joints is that big you look like goli brother wouldn't you and how strange it would be to have a little bitty teeny finger attached right up here on my hip joint and you'd see me walking around on little legs about like this so I'd go around and say oh glory to God man ain't I something ain't I something look at my little T90 legs don't I look so cool y'all look at me say poor old brother Dy bless his heart he's got them little many old tiny legs I ain't never seen such tiny legs well that's the way a preacher does when he looks at the Sheep of God and see that they're in the wrong joint they're in the wrong place and they'll never be able to run right and they'll never be able to minister right look at what my hands can do with the right joints in the right place oh I hope you're hearing me this morning for whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted compacted knit together assuredly together to cause to Coal to ca to Coal put together unite or t listen this unite together or knit together in affection to cause a person to unite one in a conclusion or come to the same opinion oh wow to come to a conclusion or come to the same opinion now do you honestly think that every one of those Ephesian Christian ever come to the place that there was no personal differences among them of course not human beings are human beings and we're always going to have difference of opinions somebody say amen amen you and your wife do amen of course you're praying for her that she'll come to her senses and she's praying for you that she'll come to yours because that's the way we are as human being so we'll never come to a spot that absolutely every message churches you know grees and every little Point our music will be different how we preach whether we read quotes how many quotes we read but look we agree on so much more than what we disagree on this must have been the way that it was in that early church that they were so compacted together but you go to the Ephesian church and then compare them to the gal chran church and the church at thessalonica and the church at Corinth it would probably been amazing I'd like to bring it to you sometime because I've I've got a study that I've studied years ago and I've took each church and just bring each church and show you the different issues and the different problems that they had and yet God identified them all as his but you know what I hate to say it but sometimes we specialize in minimizing how how many is the bride anyway and knocking people out of go going instead of trying to reach out and say come on Brother come on sister let's go let's grab one another let's go oh my may God help us you need help notice oh my from whom the whole body fitly fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint Supply us so every joint is supplying and ministering oh oh goodness working in the measure of every part Carol's mother just turned 86 this past week she's got arthritis in her hands and poor saying bless her heart they they look absolutely awful they're just so twisted and contorted and and and she can't hardly reach for anything and Carol will try to call her and and she'll try to answer the phone and she can't can't hardly get the phone cuz she's trying to you know to take it in her hand and she'll want to call Carol or one of her boys and she'll she'll try to pick it up and she can't hardly do it we tried to get her a tap player where she could listen to sermons but she can't turn it on and she you know we triy to get her something and she's lost a sight in one of her eyes and and I I bought her a big giant print Bible she said I miss reading the Bible and the message books and I bought her a giant print Bible and Amazon sent it to her and we took her message books but she can't see and and so there's Parts about her body that she's losing this and that and the other but to see her hands all twisted up oh that's so pitiful and so sad but when you look at a child of God and spiritually they've got arcarius in their hands or in their joints and they can't pray like they used to pray oh come on children let's have a church today they don't read their Bible the way they used to read the Bible and they're so busy making money and they're so busy about this and that and the other oh but if there was ever a Time that we as the people of God need to be more in love with the Lord Jesus and more in love with one another I believe it's the hour that we are living in Remember The Virtue that's supposed to be manifested in its fullness in our day it is not faith I know we're emphasizing a lot on Miracles and a lot on signs and faith is part of it but the virtue of our day right before the Capstone it is not just knowledge it is not godliness but it is brotherly kindness brotherly kindness oh help us Lord Jesus notice according to the effectual working and the measure of every part make us increase of the body so the whole body is depending on the other parts I don't need you I don't need you I don't need need you oh that's not the spirit of God that's the devil mhm every part make us increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so you mean the body will actually get to a place when the bond of perfectness which is Charity will be put on top of the rest of our garment and it will edify itself so the ministry will have brought the people to a spot of edification that the body will start edifying itself through the glory of God so the body will minister to the body it won't just be the preacher it won't just be the deacons but the body will start loving the body and the body will be concerned well I've not seen this brother in church for a few weeks I'm going to contact brother Donnie maybe you need to contact that brother yourself maybe you need to contact that sister Hey sister been missing you in church why because that's the way your body does your body don't just wait on the head to reach out to the toe but all the parts of your body are concerned about each other that's the way God made us look at this word edifying here unto the edifying of itself in love building building up metaphorically edifying edification the act of one who promotes another's growth in Christian wisdom so you mean that ain't just a preacher's place oh my goodness let me read you this and every time I read this it just overwhelms me I think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each Minister's called to stand where he would The Works that I do shall you do also each minister is ordained of God and is commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command isn't it so every godall man is called to step in the footprints of the Lord Jesus and Jesus never edified himself that's right as I mentioned to you a couple of weeks ago Jesus could have spent his whole time on the earth telling us how he created the heavens how he created the world you imagine all that he could have said I did this and I did that and I did this and I did that and I did this I made the heavens I made the Stars I made Urus I made Orion I made the belt in Orion I made pleades I made the andom Galaxy I made all those billions of Galaxy let me tell you how I did it I did this I did that I did that he could have went on and went on and went on and went on and yet he never even mentioned it when he was here right cuz it didn't come to tell us how great he was he come to express how little he become on that is truly greatness come on somebody notice now Paul in verse 20 in Ephesians 2 says and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone which is so unusual Paul doesn't say that Jesus was the foundation Stone wow but the apostles and the prophets were the foundation and Jesus in this great Act of humiliation laid himself on top of the Apostles and the prophets amen Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone so a Cornerstone they did a little bit different of course than what we do today in their building so a Corner Stone would be shaped like this and it would tie together two walls so here was a gentile wall and a Jewish wall and what did the Lord Jesus do he was the Cornerstone and those walls run right together to form a brand new building or a new man as Paul related to it now in that he must lay himself down on on top of the teaching of the prophets and also the apostles in whom all the building fitly frames Paul must have really like this word now he comes from the anatomy of a human being to a building and he goes from the joints of the human anatomy being fitted together now he goes to framing a building and he says in whom all the building fitly framed together but this is one unusual building in this building the tubs grow in this building the concrete grows the tubis sixes grow the shingles grow the windows grow everything about this building it's made to where it grows you see if you try to build a house out of growing Lumber you're going to be in a mess aren't you but God don't want dead to befores he wants living members in the house of God so the prophets could grow the New Testament prophets did of course and the pastors they grow in their understanding and the teachers they grow in their understanding and the liy grows not only in their understanding but in their Walk With God all of us are a growing building of the most high God in whom all the building fitly framed together grow us unto a holy Temple praise God in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god wow so the prophet in the Statue of a perfect man reads Ephesians 4 for the perfecting he said of God and he stalls and he says does it read that like that the perfecting of what Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified ones the ones who started from down here now remember he got this Blackboard there and he draws this pyramid shape and he draws these lines and put the virtues and The Messengers perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ edifying building it up edifying to become to the unity the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God into the perfect man unto the Assurance or the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ did they have a portion of the Holy Ghost in the days of Luther Wesley Pentecost swingley Calvin George Whitfield Mueller all of those men was the spirit of God in those ages yes it was cuz the spirit of God started in the day of Paul of course with the new birth at the foundation level as they went into the time of the church age Darkness it got away from it but God said I will restore sayith the Lord but remember the attribute of the fullness of God was in that original Church to be lost during the time of the church ages but to be restored in the last day do we have the spirit of God yes don't get in your mind now that we're waiting out here somewhere well well ain't none of us got the Holy Ghost well it's evident some of us don't have it but speak for yourself cuz I do have the Holy Ghost and there's people all over the world that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but are we waiting for a refilling how many's wanting a refilling of the Holy Ghost are we waiting for the Dynamics to be able to place this church the Capstone or the finishing up of adoption which is what the attribute of the fullness of God comes back to the Earth as God caps off the individual God caps off the church now remember God's been making a body but he makes the entire body of the seven Church ages with the exact same material that he makes the individual exact same material now watch in Christ the mystery God in his fullness to die for the s of the people that he might bring to his church a Sanctified life that he might have the preeminence in fullness don't you see Word of Life this is what I want want us to get to does the spirit of God live in US yes many of us we've got the Holy Ghost we've got these things there but I we don't want to just have them in a miniature form we want them to control us we want them to control us where they are the power that controls our actions and reactions both not just actions that you do automatically but whenever someone treats you wrong and does you wrong you want those virtues are so manifested in your life they will control your reaction to what an individual treat you that's oh my to manifest every promise in these last days that he's promised I love this this next paragraph oh it to me is so awesome and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in the last days when he gets the pinenes preeminence in the church the position his place in the church he wants his place in our church God's given us a nice place to worship but what good does that do if he's not the preeminent one here what good does it do for us just to have a Christian profession well I believe the message I go to church and I pay my TI and that that's not what it's all about it's about him getting preeminence in us as individuals and the more of us that surrender now brother b m cracks down on this and blasphemous names and he said oh the Holy Ghost Church he said there is no such a thing there is no church anywhere where everybody in there's got the Holy Ghost and every one of them is going come on now that's why we mess up every time we go to make a denomination out of that certain move there is no move never has been never will be that everybody in there was filled with the Holy Ghost totally impossible but it will be this one and that one and that one and that one and they come to that place this is the ultimate of your life I don't care if you're a billionaire when you die I don't care if you live in the biggest house in Johnson City and you've got a 75c car garage I don't care what kind of car you drive I don't care people may say yes sir yes sir do you if you don't reach this you are not rapturing Material we can quote the message we can play brother Brandon every day of our life it's going to take the baptism of the Holy Ghost living in us and living out these virtues or we missed the [Applause] Rapture as I sat with my laptop in my lap last night and I read this tears trickling down my cheeks I said oh God this is what I want for me this is what I want for the sheep that you sent me to lead that Jesus can get his place you see I'm the Le of to sin Church age which is our church age we see the Lord Jesus standing outside the church knocking trying to get back in his own church now maybe you think today as a church collectively we don't do that I hope to God we don't but we got to bring it on down closer to home than just our church as a whole does he knock on the door of your time the door of your emotions the door of your feelings the door of your pride as an individual our church is no stronger than the people who make it up our church family is no stronger than the families who come here and make it up and our church as far as overall the headship of Christ in the body is no stronger than the individuals that Christ as an indivisual it's not just you and your wife and your children it's you children you're not going to go in on your daddy's experience your mama's experience or your pastors you've got to know God for yourself and knowing him is not enough he wants to control you but that's the hard part for all of us humans CU there's something about that self perseverance that we can't hardly let go of any y'all ever been 39,000 ft in the air and you're flying a 767 or a Airbus 340 or you know maybe the double decker 747 and all of a sudden you drop seems like forever you want to go up there and take them controls out of that Pilot's hands you ever been to a spot to where God said give me your anger give me your temper give me your hurt feelings to let me take care of it or give me your resentment but there's something about us as human beings we want to hold on to it cuz somehow we trust our own ability to able to deal with it well this person hurt me that person hurt me this person lied on me I'm just holding on to a little bit now of this stuff I'm afraid to let it go which is the worst thing you can ever do you can never never never be able to resolve what the Lord Jesus can take care of in a millisecond if you'll just let it go but the devil knows there's something about human beings that's selfish there's something about it we want to control ourself and we want to be able to protect ourself and we want to be able to protect our f feelings and there's something about that in us oh if God can ever get a group of people that could let go of everything they are now I'm not telling you to let go of that to anybody else but the Lord Jesus cuz people will abuse you and people will take advantage of that I'm talking about the master he's the only one that I can give everything I am to and know that he will never take advantage of it he will never abuse it and I want to encourage you today give him your fear give him your anxiety give him your unforgiving spirit give him your attitude against a brother or a sister and know that he's the only one that can take care of it around the earth together people have gathered in churches some of them in India have gathered under trees in Africa they've gathered just out in open public places I've been there and gathered with them but they've gathered to hear their ministers to see what they had to say once the service was done and they sang and they lifted the offering and all all that part of worship and then they walk out I wonder how many of them were edified and they received something that would help them be a better person into this stat so they walked in the measuring tape come up to about right here you know God measured Jesus and then he pulls it up on our life and boy some of us it gets past the big toe and we're in we're in mess of trouble a but some of you maybe you're way up here man you're coming higher higher and higher but see even that is still not what he wants he wants every bit of us and there's parts of us we don't mind Jesus having especially the trash yeah boy there's Parts about us that we reverence come on you're going to get quieter you're going to be like a bunch of Baptist on me this morning there's parts of us that we oh we just have the offest time ever was letting go of believe it or not it's sacred to us it's sacred it's Hallowed Ground World War yeah can you imagine anybody believing that a temper is sacred an unforgiving spirit being sacred what's this in there there would come a time when he could express himself in fullness of godhead deity through his church now you see that was missing in all these stages here after the first stage of Faith the attribute of the fullness of the godhead was not in the body but it's got to come back for the first church was in the image of the Son of God and he's coming back after a wife that doesn't have a finger attach to a hip joint and have a leg appear for a nose joint that better to be weird wouldn't it but for a body that he can flow through her and say move finger the prophet said if my mind and my brain would try to control my body and from my mind would come assault and tell my body to move but yet my body was concrete my brain could think and think and project the thought and project the thought but there'd be nothing no sensory perceptions nothing that could move in seconds to be able to come to the fingers the toes all all that sort of St there'd be no communication channel so from here down I would just be concrete and the Brain would say love one another forgive one another pray for one another oh pray for them that despitefully use you but the concrete body just St her the head would say when you come to church worship me praise me as a matter of fact don't wait till you get to church but do it on your way to church do it at home do it on your job I love your worship and your praise but the body just stands there and the thoughts are thinking love worship forgiveness kindness tenderness Mercy but in the molding part of these Church ages they've done good to be able to believe the just shall live by faith and then the thoughts start becoming a little bit more clear sanctification quit smoking quit lying quit this and that some movement got in the body praise the Lord is the concrete being transformed is something happening to the rebar and the concrete the gravel and the cement and the potash and everything that makes up concrete there's some Life coming in then in Pentecost Oh Glory to God hallelujah boy they had some movement didn't they I mean their tongue started speaking in tongue I ain't making fun of that now but they started having some movement they started shout glory to God hallelujah have enough temp to fight a buz saw yeah run down one another come on criticize one another or they had a lot of movement all right it's one thing about that tongue getting loose you got to watch what it does cuz it can be set on fire of the Holy Ghost or set on fire of hell oh well Preacher Brother Donnie Hallelujah but God knew all along I'm telling you Satan I'm giving you a headed up there will come a time that I once again will step into my body and I will cause through my body the resurrection from the [Music] dead in the fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminence in his church oh my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom anointed by why accepting what he turned down watch how the prophet and molding of this house of God and I said if we were building a house here brother he mentioned some of the different Brothers there he said you know they could tell you the upright which is what they call the walls you know on that day he said they could tell you about the upright and this and that I'm not here to tell you that out I'm talking about how build a house that God can live in Peter here says first seven things Faith virtue see coming up knowledge Temperance patience godl Brotherly Love brotherly kindness then the love of God the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy G ghost true baptism of the Holy Ghost now watch what it does and you got all these virtues sealed in you then God lives in a tabernacle called the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place amen how many wants it now listen friend to these words until these virtues here go into you you're still off the true foundation of Faith but when these virtues grow in as you added to that to that then you are a living Monument you are a living moving Idol amen you know the old English wedding vows used them many years ago some folks still use them I've used them on the occasion when people would ask me to but is I PL in my TR and you've heard that but they used to say with my body I the worship so this is what a man would say to a woman this is what a woman would say to a man wh my body I the worship he said brother Donnie I give him my soul but he wants your hands too yeah amen he wants your eyes he wants your mouth he wants your ears yes praise the Lord he don't want you going on websites looking at trash praise the Lord they don't want you singing songs that ain't ain't becoming to a child of God come on somebody he wants you to turn and say with my body I the worship can yall accept that well let's see how good you do with this part so then can you in turn allow him to say where's my body my bride I Thee adore you see why that why that stumbles us because you don't know the meaning of the word worship you think it's bowed down and worshiping all that oh no the prophet would have never said the statements that he said about coming to the house of God where the name of Jesus Christ is their God and His people are worshiped together what if we're being worshiped together and we're worshiping him who is adoring and loving her I wonder what our church services could be if we could receive just what I said to you that the Lord God wants to come in this place and make love to his brother to pull you up near him and heal your sickness and deliver your your problems and your issues in your life and change you by love let me close but we not in an imaginary way we prostrate ourselves before a living God a living virtue virt a living knowledge a living patience oh my a living godliness a living power coming by the Living God makes a living man a Living Image the statue of God what's he doing the same things that Jesus did now we're not just talking about casting out devils and Healing The Sick and going to the hospital and empty out all the hospitals brother R said we got screaming and shouting and all that he said that's because of our faith and people think well glory to God hallelujah we lay hands on the sick and they recover that don't mean you've got one liquor brotherly kindness yeah that's the first virtue on the bottom face but yet that's the way we're judging how spiritual we are and how great we are how great our ministry is how do you treat those that love you how do you treat those who hate you how do you treat those that despise you and run your name down come on somebody and Facebook and all Instagram and all that stuff for a lot of the sake of it I'll tell you children it's evident to see to me that bunch of trash come straight out of the pits of hell cuz people get unar fuss and fighting even women gets a pull pit on Facebook women get a pull pit on Instagram and they want to preach the word a little bit well preach it brother Donnie but how do we treat those if you want to use the thing let your testimony be that of a child of God don't get in there and run people down don't get in there and run come on don't get quiet on me Word of Life if we're going to be a child of God you want to be a child of God on Instagram you want to be a child of God on Facebook and if you can't handle it get rid of it if you can't handle a smartphone get a dumb phone to match the dummy you are well Hallelujah if you can't handle a smartphone because of pornography you'd be better off with an old dial up you'd be better off Hallelujah you'd be better off with an old phone I'll tell you one thing going to hell is not going to be worth anything in this life you'll forfeit Christ [Applause] for let me finish this quote the same things that Jesus did walking in the same way he walked doing the same things he did de because it's not an imaginary thing there's a reality that proves it see what I mean see how these virtues these building materials typed in with the church Messengers with the church ages now this is the house that God dwells in not a building with a big Bell on the top of it in a high steeple but a body has s th prepared me a body a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in living instrumentality of God God walking hallu on two feet that's it yes sir sir a godall preacher points his fingers out this way a kingdom Builder when he reads that quote points his fingers this way I used to watch superheroes when I was a kid at home when we had a television Batman Superman all them Heroes Charles Atlas you've heard me tell it before and I got on comic magazine and I seen that bodybuilding stuff on the back of it I ordered that course is you can tell it didn't work I look more like Gomer pow or somebody like that don't but one day I sing about it yesterday I don't know why but it kept coming back to me several times during the day and early this morning I woke up early for daylight and it kept coming back to me again and my mama's words because he wasn't raised in a Christian home so mama had got saved at my uncle's church and then something started dealing with me and I remember the words that I asked mama and I said Mama how do you get saved how how how do you pray you talk about ignorant Carol gave her life story here to our youth couple months back she sat back there in one of the Sunday School rooms and I watched our youth as she told it she gave her heart to God when she was 16 she never heard of Daniel and the Lions then until she was 16 years old never heard of Jonah and the whale never heard of Moses never heard anything about God's word but God had a plan for her wanted her to be a preacher's wife yeah poor old saying bless her heart she had to be married to me her and sister Glenda will probably get the same reward it'll be great rewards won't it that's what I thought Brother Lou said how long they' been married I said God bless sister Glendon glory to God let me tell you something friend people around the world may know me they may know brother Daryl brother Bill the preachers but you don't have no idea what that preacher's wife goes through I wonder how many burdens sister Shirley bore brother Bill how many night she laid away crying for people in your church and issues going on and this and that and the other we get in our mind the superheroes of men that they'll walk up there that day and boy God's going to do this and that and other I wonder if it ain't going to be quite a bit different than what we think but there'll be little Daughters of God That'll Walk up through there they never preached they couldn't they never traveled and you know done a lot of things the way men could they couldn't but when they stand there by their preacher husband they walk together they stand up before the Lord Jesus and he looks down there sister Shirley and calls her by her word name whatever that is and gives her reward and tell her what she's done and how she stood with Brother Bill and how she mothered her children and how she helped people sometimes Carol I wake up in the morning I say you sleep good she said no I had sister so and so on my mind I had brother so and so on the Mind been praying for this one been praying for that one been praying for that one I was wake about all night that's a real pastor's wife yeah I believe I'll be standing near when she walks before him that day and hear him give her a reward same with Deacon's wives same with evangelous wives now your brothers that aren't preachers now bring it down to your home and your wife prayed for some of you men when you wasn't really doing very good at all as a matter of fact you needed a weapon you needed your hide switched but your little wife wouldn't let go of you when you was as rebellious and as hard-headed as you could be maybe you messed up big time and it hurt her like to destroyed her but she wouldn't let go thank God for such women amen go ahead let's give them a little flow right now God don't want just preachers to be this but you sisters a body hast thou prepared me God walking on two feet let's B together Heavenly Father we believe what we've heard today Lord as I take the measure in tape of the Lord Jesus and I measure myself I think oh God help me physically I might have been a little bit taller than you I might have waited bit bit more but that's not the way I measuring myself most of us want to measure oursel in comparison to Sinners yeah we'll always feel better by doing that but you don't want us to measure ourselves by Sinners or by denominational people our measurement is you so no matter who we are for a preacher Deacon trustey housewife just a teenager going to school when we all are measured by that great measure we always seem to come short Lord God we're so grateful that we can say like the sister that wanted to testify ain't what I ought to be and I ain't what I want to be but there's one thing I know for sure I ain't what I used to be Lord Jesus help us father we want to grow Lord we want to grow in faith virtue and knowledge and all these wonderful things till each one of them will be a stepping stone for the other and it's an Administration that's open so some people come to Faith and that's where they focus the rest of their life some preachers around the message that's where they are right now are just focusing so much on Faith and Healing and miracles and oh it's just faith faith faith faith healing healing miracles Miracles Miracles but Faith should be a stepping stone to open up the other Administration that's before us which is virtue your Prophet told us virtue was not living a virgin life but it was having strength to minister to others that's the way you did whenever we look at the Sevenfold attributes we're looking at your personage yourself and the last one we come to before the Capstone is brotherly kindness how will I ever be able to have brotherly kindness because you had it for me you put up with me when I was wrong you put up with me when I've been out of the way even after I got saved it was your brotherly kindness that has intervened from me so many times and even Paul wrote In the book of Hebrews and said that he would declare his father's name among the Brethren and again he said he's not ashamed to call them Brethren so brotherly kindness is what issues from your soul and you would call us Brothers oh almighty God creator of the heavens and the Earth would call us Brothers oh Jesus help us today Father they ever head bowed and no one looking around please let me just say Lord I need more of you Jesus I need more I want these things in my life Lord oh Jesus I I I I I can see all of them I I I can see all of those things but I I don't want to just see them in infancy I want to see it matured grown up till you can take complete control of me oh Jesus in the stage where we are in science one of the Nick's biggest IND Industries as far as what they made known to us is AI artificial intelligence when we do a Google search or Yahoo whatever search engine we use they've now got a certain symbol designated for AI before it was a magnify glass to represent search and different ones and now ai has been assigned its own symbol and we can search by AI so the world has come to the place of artificial intelligence and the prophet tells us the last thing the last moving part is the eyes prophetic the next thing is the intelligence to step into the body and we have no intelligence of our own so if the mind of Christ is telling us love one another but our bodies are concrete we say I can't forgive him I cannot forgive her he preached against me he throwed that sermon right I will not forgive them our bodies are concrete help us Lord Jesus I don't want to just lay hands on the sick and watch them get well and I've seen that thousands of times but I want to love the way you loved I want to have brotherly kindness Lord Jesus for my brothers when they trespass against me as to ask you so how many times Lord should I forgive my brother a day seven and then you overwhelmed them by your great response but I say unto you 70 Time s we'll look at it Lord willing on Wednesday night oh Jesus help us father can we just raise our hands now each one of was just in your own way Lord please help me don't let me take the measure and tape of brother Brandon or take the measuring tape of this man or that man but use the measuring tape of yourself and measure me flow through me Holy Spirit flow through me yes Lord I will be your house to dwell in flow to me and I will be that good Samaritan to someone else in falls through me Holy Spirit oh we sing it this way forgive through me is there anybody here that wants Jesus to forgive forgive through me Holy Spirit forgive through [Music] me as I lift my hands to worship and magnify oh Lord God may I love my brothers and my sisters Lord when they heard and cause me pain forgives through me ohy Spirit forgive through me live through me let's just worship him now live through me holyy Spirit oh Lord God I pray you'd help us today Father in the name of Jesus Lord begin with me father I pray have mercy have mercy extend to me your brotherly kindness bear with me Jesus help me Lord when I'm wrong don't cast me aside help me Lord Jesus when I fall short so I in turn can show brotherly kindness live through me oh the spirit lives through me flow through me what What flows through me Faith virtue knowledge flows through me Holy Spirit flows through me Lord God we want to be your house to dwell in flows through me [Music] let me be that [Music] good return to someone else in me through me hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus can we just lay your hands on each other brother John would you come up my brethren offer prayer for the saints of God no doubt there's folks here today that are sick maybe some are fighting different battles maybe yours is not sickness but the measure of Christ Jesus has brought to you today a conviction that you need more of this or more of that can we pray for each other brother John pray for me would you oh Heavenly Father Lord Jesus oh Lord how we love you Lord yes Father Lord Jesus you're constantly reminding us yes Lord Jesus that we're important to you Lord yes and father your word comes forth and it brings forth something in US Lord it stirs us up Lord Jesus it gives us a greater desire to be like you Lord oh and Lord Jesus we have the desire because you placed it there father and we know when the Deep calls to the Deep there's something to respond father and Lord Jesus we're so oh thankful Lord Jesus that you've given us that Lord thank you Lord and you've made a way for us Lord hallelujah but father just like you gave the desire Lord we need you to manifest it through our lives Lord Jesus we don't have the strength Lord Jesus thank you but we know we look unto the author and the finish of our faith Lord Lord God we call on your name Lord Jesus to take these words that we've heard today Father and we pray father that would just manifest them out of our Lives Lord there's nothing like you Lord Jesus there's no hope in us but you father there's no chance we'll ever
