[36:02] praise the Lord Matthew chapter 16:
[36:07] 18 we still believe the way up is down
[36:13] right that's backwards of course to the
[36:15] world but we know that's the way it
[36:18] works in the program of
[36:20] God Matthew 16:18 the words of the Lord
[36:25] Jesus and I say also unto thee that thou
[36:28] art Peter which is little Stone Petra
[36:33] little
[36:34] Stone Upon This Rock I will build my
[36:39] church which certainly was not on the
[36:42] little Stone because the little Stone
[36:44] backs sled just a little bit after this
[36:47] but it was on the revelation of who
[36:49] Jesus was Upon This Rock I will build my
[36:53] church and the gates of hell shall not
[36:58] Prevail against it 1 Timothy
[37:02] 3:14 and
[37:05] 15 these things write I unto thee hoping
[37:10] to come unto thee
[37:12] shortly but if i tar long that thou
[37:15] mayest know how thou oughtest to behave
[37:18] thyself in the house of God which is the
[37:25] Ecclesia an assembly Gathering of
[37:28] citizens called out from their homes
[37:30] into some public place or an assembly in
[37:35] a Christian sense an assembly of
[37:37] Christians gathered for worship in a
[37:41] religious meeting so this is what the
[37:44] church is which is the Church of the
[37:46] Living God the pillar and
[37:50] ground of the truth and the ground is a
[37:53] stay or a prop or a support So in
[37:59] reality it's no wonder Satan is going to
[38:02] do his best to destroy the church now he
[38:06] will destroy this church not so much
[38:09] this building here but I'm talking about
[38:11] the church that Jesus said he would
[38:13] build as his own but I'll tell you what
[38:15] he'll do on the other hand he will build
[38:19] support multiply strengthen and
[38:23] grow his own church yeah because Satan
[38:28] also has a
[38:31] church they are his
[38:34] wife they are his wife I'm glad we don't
[38:37] belong to that
[38:38] church you see he never had one until
[38:41] the New Testament but once he saw what
[38:43] God was doing he thought that was a
[38:46] great idea then he decided he would make
[38:49] his own church and he has they're called
[38:52] different names and different titles but
[38:55] every one of them that are contrary to
[38:58] God's word belongs to the devil now none
[39:01] of them of course would ever say that
[39:04] they are Satan worshippers none of them
[39:06] would ever draw a pentagram they'd never
[39:08] get goats blood they'd never do all that
[39:10] stuff um but what they do is Jesus said
[39:14] in St Mark 7 how be it in vain do they
[39:18] worship me teaching for doctrines the
[39:22] Commandments of men which is seed of
[39:27] discrepancy okay how may like to be a
[39:30] remember tonight as we
[39:32] pray heavenly father as we bow our heads

[40:41] too Lord they need you to anoint their
[40:44] ability to hear because we know just
[40:47] because we got ears on the side of our
[40:48] head don't mean that we can hear the
[40:50] voice of God but that's what we want to
[40:53] hear so help us tonight speak to us
[40:55] father may we be better when we leave
[40:58] this place tonight in the name of the
[41:00] Lord Jesus we ask it amen God bless you
[41:04] you may be seated
[41:07] Saints looking at the pattern of what
[41:10] God himself established in making the
[41:13] church now truly if if he's the one
[41:17] that's going to make it then I I think
[41:20] in order for us to be able to judge each
[41:22] and every Church we'd have to be able to
[41:24] do it by what the author said himself
[41:27] now you know that I like antiques both
[41:29] Carol and I both do like them and
[41:31] there's a certain period of antiques
[41:34] that we like and it's called The
[41:36] Victorian period Then the end of the
[41:37] Victorian period was the Italian
[41:41] Renaissance and the Victorian period
[41:43] they used a lot of arches and they used
[41:46] a lot of deep U carvings and Engravings
[41:49] and things like that at the end of that
[41:51] period before Charles G Eastlake began
[41:53] to manufacture furniture they had the
[41:56] end that of the Italian Renaissance so
[41:59] Carol and I wanted a a big bed a big big
[42:02] large bed so I'd seen several of them
[42:05] it's called a half tester and I'd seen
[42:08] several of them and they were multiplied
[42:10] thousands and thousands of dollars so I
[42:13] thought after looking at a bunch of
[42:15] magazines and looking at a bunch of them
[42:17] beds I thought I could make one so I
[42:20] started getting a bunch of pictures and
[42:22] I'd had a bunch of pieces and parts off
[42:24] of organs and Mir and all kinds of
[42:27] things that were handcarved stuff now
[42:30] you can't go to Big Lots or you can't go
[42:31] to Lowe's and buy all that handcarved
[42:33] stuff because it dates back to about
[42:35] 1880 to somewhere around 1910 so I
[42:39] started trying to put this together so I
[42:43] laid it all out and Carol kind of draw
[42:45] me a sketch of something she wanted
[42:47] wanted it to look like so what I had to
[42:50] do was take the parts and the pieces
[42:53] that I had and then try to fill in the
[42:58] other stuff now they also used a lot of
[43:00] burl Walnut anybody know what that is
[43:03] well Burl is where the branches come
[43:05] down and grow off the main part of the
[43:06] trunk and it will cause these figures
[43:09] that will be there also some of the most
[43:11] beautiful Burl uh will be found in the
[43:14] roots of the tree which grows down in
[43:16] the ground then what they'll do they'll
[43:18] take that log and they will soak it day
[43:21] and night 24 hours a day soak it soak it
[43:24] soak it and then they'll take a real
[43:26] sharp blade and then they'll start
[43:28] cutting that that veneer now they'll cut
[43:30] it I've got some that's a 64 of an inch
[43:33] thick some that's a 32th of an inch and
[43:36] you can take that and it'll slice it
[43:39] just like this slice slice slice slice
[43:41] like you're slicing a piece of ham and
[43:43] it'll come off and it replicates itself
[43:45] because that Burl has eyes and has
[43:48] different things inside of it so you
[43:50] take one piece and you lay it down then
[43:52] you take another piece and lay it down
[43:54] another piece like that like that and
[43:56] you put it together put it in a vacuum
[43:58] bag and then you put a little pump on it
[44:00] and they
[44:02] go and it draws all the air out of it
[44:05] and then it glues it down to a substrate
[44:08] then you can make pictures and make
[44:10] faces out of all of that that come off
[44:13] of that veneer but I had to have some
[44:16] sort of image in my mind of something
[44:19] that I wanted because there wasn't
[44:23] anything quite like it at Grand there
[44:25] wasn't anything quite like it at the
[44:26] Ashley store so I had to look back at uh
[44:30] magazines at Carol had and they were
[44:33] Victorian style magazines and since I
[44:36] was building it with a gigantic poster
[44:38] and some of the brothers are in the
[44:39] church actually once I got it built
[44:41] helped me put it together and helped me
[44:43] set it up so what I had to have I had
[44:46] for a lot of it I had to have things
[44:49] that was imp pairs now if I was going to
[44:51] put something on this post I had to have
[44:53] something on this post that would match
[44:56] so if I was going to put an ornate
[44:58] pediment up on the top of it I found a
[45:00] dresser on eBay that was out in San
[45:02] Francisco and I bought it for about $200
[45:05] and had it shipped out here so I found
[45:08] two pediments anybody know what them are
[45:10] okay I ain't going to explain it to you
[45:11] you going to have to take my word for it
[45:13] so I found a matching pair of pediments
[45:15] one to go on the bed one to go on the
[45:17] dresser and then I embellished it added
[45:20] to it added width added height and so on
[45:23] so that it would look like that it was a
[45:26] hair but now I had to have part of it in
[45:28] my mind but I had to have part of it in
[45:32] substance because I can't carve I can't
[45:34] do any of that but I already had a lot
[45:37] of this in bits and pieces that I had it
[45:40] from all kinds of things that I'd saved
[45:42] over the years so I went to laying it
[45:44] out and I'd lay it out like this and I
[45:46] lay it in the in the basement floor and
[45:49] then I'd go to look at them pictures and
[45:51] then I'd take these pieces and I knew
[45:54] that I could make certain things things
[45:56] I had routers and planers and things
[45:58] like that so I knew there was some
[46:00] things that I could make and I could
[46:02] make the Burl faces and I could make
[46:05] things like that but there was parts of
[46:07] it that I had to have that was already
[46:11] original now I would make that and I
[46:14] would take and lay it down and that was
[46:16] one of the hardest parts was trying to
[46:18] get something in my mind now it stands a
[46:21] little over 10t tall but naturally I
[46:24] couldn't make it 10 fo tall and take it
[46:27] through my bedroom door so I had to make
[46:29] it where it would come apart so and the
[46:32] post or big gigantic post headboards
[46:35] about the footboards about this tall and
[46:37] headboard 10 foot tall so I had to try
[46:40] to make it in such a way in my mind and
[46:43] think how can I make it where it'll come
[46:46] apart and yet come back together and
[46:49] then if anything ever happens to me make
[46:51] it where hopefully my son-in-laws can be
[46:53] able to figure out how to take it apart
[46:55] heart so and in that I see similar to
[46:59] what God wanted to do so God wanted to
[47:03] build something that he had had a type
[47:06] of in the Old Testament which was the
[47:08] church which was Israel entire now it
[47:11] was a type so anything in type is not
[47:14] always the True Image but yet it was a
[47:17] people that was called out a people that
[47:20] was different from the rest of the world
[47:23] and God would designate for them to do
[47:25] certain things eat certain foods act
[47:28] certain way and by doing that the world
[47:31] would look at them and know that they
[47:33] were a separate people that's what God
[47:36] wanted God wanted a people that was
[47:39] separate so he would tell them to wear a
[47:42] certain color now God told them to wear
[47:45] what was called a riband r i BB a n d a
[47:48] riband of blue on the border of their
[47:52] garment now that that was quite unusual
[47:55] but it was the merging together on their
[47:57] Earthly Coes of the Heavenly color which
[48:00] was the skies and then God would tell
[48:03] them that don't eat these types of food
[48:05] don't eat anything with the web foot
[48:08] don't eat anything that doesn't chew the
[48:10] C don't do this don't do that so every
[48:13] day they would go to the market they
[48:14] didn't have deep freezers and
[48:16] refrigerators microwaves and all that so
[48:19] a lot of the country still do the same
[48:20] thing today they go to the market every
[48:22] day to buy the perishables so every day
[48:25] when they would go to the market they
[48:27] were testifying that they were obeying
[48:30] the laws of Yahweh because you never saw
[48:33] a True Believer buying any fish or any
[48:37] type of seafood that did not match the
[48:40] program of the Torah of God now
[48:44] everybody would watch them and they
[48:46] would see the way they would dress they
[48:48] were not allowed to have a garment that
[48:51] would be mixed together with linen and
[48:54] wool they would not be able to plant
[48:56] different types of seed in the same row
[49:00] so their Gardens were different their
[49:02] clothes were different everything about
[49:05] them was different they were not allowed
[49:07] to Mark themselves like people do today
[49:10] the tattoos and all they were not
[49:12] allowed to cut themselves so every time
[49:16] you saw one of them you would know they
[49:19] were a Jew and then of course they had
[49:21] the law of circumcision also another
[49:23] sign so God wanted his people always to
[49:26] be separate now when it come to the New
[49:28] Testament God did not take away the laws
[49:32] of Separation but now he's going to move
[49:34] it where it's going to start inside of
[49:36] their soul no matter how much they done
[49:38] all the outward things in the Old
[49:40] Testament they still never had a true
[49:43] and a converted heart cuz the law
[49:45] couldn't produce it but in the New
[49:47] Testament God is going to come inside of
[49:50] them and start sanctifying or
[49:53] circumcising them from the inside out
[49:56] now they're still going to dress certain
[49:58] ways and they're going to live certain
[50:00] ways and there's certain things they're
[50:02] not going to do of course the world
[50:04] today does not want to hear that they
[50:07] must say Well it don't matter what you
[50:08] look like it don't make no difference to
[50:10] God if you paint your face or cut your
[50:12] hair or wear britches why what
[50:14] difference does it make to God well it
[50:17] still does make a difference to God God
[50:20] don't want the women dressing like men
[50:22] God don't want the men dressing like
[50:24] women
[50:26] God don't want men marrying men God
[50:28] don't want women marrying women somebody
[50:31] say amen that's God's law that's what we
[50:34] believe is that right so whenever God
[50:37] then was going to design this church he
[50:41] is the Builder himself so he never
[50:43] called the apostles together for a
[50:45] general meeting and said now look I'm
[50:47] thinking about building this thing
[50:49] called a church first time has ever used
[50:51] of course the word I'm going to build
[50:53] this thing called a church now now Peter
[50:56] what do you sing that I should build it
[50:58] out of now unlike Carol and myself when
[51:01] we wanted this particular thing in our
[51:03] house and as long as I'm around I mean
[51:06] Carol will always think of this and look
[51:08] at this this bed and she told me a not
[51:10] long ago she said Donnie if something
[51:12] was to ever happen to you I don't know
[51:14] what in the world I would do every room
[51:16] in this house has got antiques in it
[51:18] that you've ever either built or
[51:20] refinished every room I I I would see
[51:23] you everywhere well that's the way God
[51:26] wants to be inside his church so whether
[51:30] it's in the nursery whether it's in the
[51:32] bathroom whether it's in the fellowship
[51:34] hall in the pastor's office in the
[51:36] mezanine God wants us to see him in
[51:39] every room of this building God wants to
[51:41] be the main reason that we come here God
[51:45] don't want it to be well they've got
[51:46] nice basketball goals you need to find
[51:49] another church to go to that's the
[51:50] reason you come here because it should
[51:53] be all about him and our love for him
[51:57] then all the rest these things are just
[51:59] nice things to have around that's not
[52:01] really the reason that we come the
[52:03] church is that right so it should be not
[52:06] like with my house I've got things
[52:09] everywhere and it would be the same with
[52:10] Carol cuz Carol's made curtains in this
[52:13] room and curtains in that room and her
[52:15] her you know just her signature about
[52:17] this and that is all through our house
[52:20] which is the way it should be and it
[52:22] should be then that in God's house that
[52:25] it is not the signature of of a
[52:28] denominational board and we look and see
[52:31] well this was Bishop so and so ideas and
[52:34] this was so and so's idea and they think
[52:36] the church should do this or should not
[52:38] no it should not even be that way at all
[52:41] it should be the signature of God should
[52:44] be in every house of God that truly
[52:47] belongs to God but it's so sad to
[52:51] realize that many churches do not have
[52:54] the signature of God they have the
[52:58] signature of a man a single man or a
[53:02] group of men which lead that church so
[53:06] then if that man behind the pulpit
[53:08] thinks that well you know what uh I
[53:11] don't know that it's necessary anymore
[53:13] to really preach on Holiness I don't
[53:15] know that it's necessary to preach
[53:18] against the things of the world anymore
[53:20] we might do better and we might gain
[53:22] more if we would uh let let off of that
[53:25] and then then in a year or two we'll
[53:27] we'll start preaching on it again and by
[53:29] that long you've lost a whole lot of
[53:32] ground yeah so what did they do then the
[53:35] church will start taking on the image of
[53:38] the man in the Pulpit the image that he
[53:41] is creating by the words that he is
[53:44] saying or the ones he's leaving out so
[53:48] you see it's not just important what a
[53:51] man says but many times I like to know
[53:55] and find out what is he leaving out
[53:58] because sometimes what he's leaving out
[54:01] has much more of an impression on the
[54:03] people than the words that he is
[54:06] actually saying because it is a it is a
[54:10] subtly crafted sermon that preachers
[54:13] will put out especially in this age that
[54:16] will say certain things that are very
[54:19] very good but it is the deadly things
[54:22] which are left out which I absolutely
[54:26] annihilates and separates the people of
[54:29] God from the presence of God because if
[54:32] you preach them they'll get you in
[54:33] trouble well I figure if I ain't get in
[54:36] trouble apparently I ain't making the
[54:37] devil mad so God chose then to build
[54:41] this thing called the church now unlike
[54:44] me if You' ever be able to see my bed
[54:46] that I built and I'd be able to tell you
[54:49] well this come from this was a two
[54:52] pieces of mahogany now I said they got a
[54:54] different grain of course a different
[54:56] density of the wood mahogany does than
[54:58] Walnut and you'll never be able to
[55:00] replicate mahogany quite like like you
[55:03] can Walnut but because they're inch and
[55:05] a quarter and they're very heavy Coral
[55:08] heavy type things and I was able to fool
[55:10] with the stain a little bit in order to
[55:13] make it look like Walnut but you see God
[55:16] don't want to do that in his church God
[55:19] don't want Hypocrites and God don't want
[55:21] make Believers there and God will take a
[55:23] little bit of stain and kind of work on
[55:26] it a little bit to kind of dress it up
[55:28] now these handrails here are made out of
[55:30] w so is this so's this so is this but
[55:33] yet the bottom back here is made out of
[55:36] popper and yet we could not of course be
[55:39] able to afford wall and through the
[55:40] whole thing but I was able to be able to
[55:43] take the same stain and be able to work
[55:46] also on this organ here brother John gon
[55:49] dinner buil this and I was able to take
[55:50] the same stain and make it look like
[55:53] Walnut now Naturally by Nature they're
[55:57] not colored the same way in popper
[55:59] you'll find real white wood you'll find
[56:01] streaks of green there's one of these
[56:03] rails in yours got a streak of green
[56:05] about that wide and about 4 foot long
[56:08] but you won't find it and I am not going
[56:09] to tell you which one it is I was able
[56:12] to take stain and work on it and blend
[56:15] it as they call it and make that green
[56:18] disappear now you got to know what
[56:20] you're doing but what you're doing is H
[56:23] hypocritical in one sense of the word
[56:26] because you're trying to hide one thing
[56:29] to make it blend in with something else
[56:32] now this is Walnut these are popper this
[56:35] is this is birch and you've got a
[56:37] mixture of woods on the library in there
[56:39] that's exactly the same way but if
[56:42] someone knows what they're doing then
[56:44] they can take the finished part of it
[56:46] and actually pull several different
[56:48] types of wood together and make you
[56:51] think every bit of it is from the same
[56:54] tree and that's what Satan does when it
[56:56] comes to a church then he will have this
[56:59] church that church that church oh my
[57:01] we're all going to heaven well I reckon
[57:03] everybody is anything my goodness people
[57:05] can live like a devil you hear hear
[57:07] their funeral preach and you think
[57:09] they're just right next door to Gabriel
[57:11] and Michael I mean they're just walking
[57:13] down streets of gold and you think good
[57:15] Lord you got to be kidding me if they
[57:16] went to heaven my the devil will be
[57:18] there in three weeks there look friend I
[57:20] don't care what a preacher tries to put
[57:22] you in the gates there ain't no preacher
[57:25] that can put you in or keep you
[57:28] out it's your own life that you live
[57:31] before God so God wanted this beautiful
[57:35] beautiful creation called the church God
[57:38] wanted this thing now God knew as soon
[57:41] as he designated this to place it on the
[57:43] earth he knew that Satan would want to
[57:45] replicate it so God gave us an original
[57:48] pattern and we would be able to judge
[57:51] that pattern and look at the pattern and
[57:54] study the pattern and I've told you
[57:55] before there was an older sister down
[57:57] the church in Kentucky and whatever I
[57:59] preached on twins years and years ago
[58:01] down there she came to me after the
[58:03] service and said brother Donnie I've got
[58:05] a nephew and said he works for the
[58:07] federal government and he he works in
[58:09] the treasury Department in studying
[58:12] about counterfeiting and she said I
[58:14] asked him one time about counterfeit and
[58:18] he said many years he'd been there
[58:20] studying studying watching it all out
[58:22] and she said how do you know
[58:25] how do you know when you see a
[58:28] counterfeit Bill he said I've never seen
[58:33] one she said what do you mean you mean
[58:35] you don't study the counterfeit he said
[58:38] no I study the real so much that as soon
[58:42] as I see one it will stick out to me now
[58:46] you know I find that a great truth in
[58:49] that that we can spend so much time
[58:51] studying the false and trying to defend
[58:54] this and that and the other and we
[58:55] absorb a lot of that time when we should
[58:57] be studying the real so how are we going
[59:00] to know if our church or any other
[59:02] church is the like to true and original
[59:05] Church well we look at the pattern
[59:07] that's all we do we look at the pattern
[59:10] now you realize that whenever Things
[59:13] become in short or in shortage that
[59:16] people will fall back and on other
[59:19] things to try to replace them now that
[59:21] I'm speaking about furniture let me go
[59:23] ahead and tell you this a little history
[59:24] tonight at the end of the Victorian
[59:26] periods by the time the victorians got
[59:28] done with the black walnut in America
[59:31] almost all the forest the Trees of the
[59:33] black walnut were nearly destroyed
[59:36] because they even made the drawers out
[59:38] of solid Walnut for years and then they
[59:41] got to a spot that they learned how to
[59:43] veneer it although the Chinese have been
[59:44] doing it since the 14th century and they
[59:47] finally brought it over to America and
[59:49] started doing it here so instead of
[59:51] taking a piece of wood 3/4 of an inch
[59:53] for a drawer that taking 30 second of an
[59:55] inch and they glue it on a piece of
[59:57] substrate and you'd have all them other
[59:59] pieces of wood so by the end of that
[1:00:02] there wasn't hardly any Walnut left so
[1:00:04] you know what they started doing they
[1:00:06] started making at the end of the
[1:00:07] Victorian period some of the Victorian
[1:00:10] furniture out of Oak but that was bad
[1:00:13] because Oak was
[1:00:16] firewood so you can imagine now you buy
[1:00:18] a piece of furniture in your house and
[1:00:21] you're used to having Burl Walnut you're
[1:00:23] used to having at least mahogany or
[1:00:26] you're used to having Rosewood y'all
[1:00:28] know what Rosewood is or some of the
[1:00:29] black wood from Africa and they would
[1:00:31] have some of that and then they go
[1:00:34] because why there was a shortage of
[1:00:36] Walnut the furniture manufacturer still
[1:00:39] making Furniture so they had to go to
[1:00:41] another wood so they had to compromise
[1:00:44] from this high-end quality of wood to
[1:00:50] firewood
[1:00:52] firewood and then they all also for
[1:00:55] those who would not absolutely refuse to
[1:00:58] buy any oak furniture then they resorted
[1:01:01] to buying it out of popper and then they
[1:01:04] would take tricky guys who knew how to
[1:01:06] do the stain workor and they would start
[1:01:09] doing it that way so then you would
[1:01:10] start seeing the sides of furniture out
[1:01:12] of popper and the front out of Walnut
[1:01:15] and a lot of the people didn't even know
[1:01:18] that it wasn't even solid wers so they
[1:01:20] started tricking the consumer and the
[1:01:23] consumer looked at it and thought it was
[1:01:26] the same thing so several years ago
[1:01:28] Carol wanted a big table in the house so
[1:01:29] I built her a big gigantic dining room
[1:01:32] table she wanted some chairs and we went
[1:01:34] down to Knoxville found some big heavy
[1:01:36] heavy chairs down in Knoxville well they
[1:01:38] were made in
[1:01:41] chinaa now they looked
[1:01:44] Walnut but I had a funny
[1:01:47] feeling that the color was not the right
[1:01:50] color so I had to strip them off and
[1:01:53] when I started stripping tripping them
[1:01:55] off I mean the legs are big old heavy
[1:01:57] ornate things you know and the the I got
[1:02:00] the top finish off and it didn't take me
[1:02:03] long to realize I had made a bad
[1:02:07] mistake because the brownish red looking
[1:02:10] color on that wood
[1:02:13] disappeared and I was stuck with
[1:02:19] purple
[1:02:21] purple now they did not stain
[1:02:25] that wood they dyed it how many's heard
[1:02:29] a wood dye nobody you're getting a
[1:02:31] woodworking lesson tonight aren't you
[1:02:33] well they take purple
[1:02:36] dye now you know what I've realized that
[1:02:39] a lot of Christians when you go to
[1:02:42] skinning them down deep
[1:02:45] enough they're purple and pink and green
[1:02:48] and yell and polka dot ain't no telling
[1:02:50] what in the world you'll find when you
[1:02:52] get the outside finish off but now God
[1:02:55] don't want a church that just has a
[1:02:59] veneer finish you know what a lot of
[1:03:01] furniture is made out of
[1:03:03] today
[1:03:06] sawdust saw
[1:03:08] dust oh but it looks like wood on the
[1:03:12] outside but if you get it wet one time
[1:03:15] mhm and you let it get wet very long
[1:03:17] you'll find that thing will go to
[1:03:19] swelling up on you and the moisture gets
[1:03:22] on the inside and it goes to wrink and
[1:03:24] some of y'all are smiling you bought
[1:03:26] some of that nice Iron Furniture ain't
[1:03:28] you well you see that's the way Satan
[1:03:30] then decided Well if God wants a church
[1:03:33] I I want one too but I can't make one
[1:03:37] that'll look so opposite of God because
[1:03:41] if I do everybody will know it so I've
[1:03:44] got to make one that at least initially
[1:03:47] will have the appearance of his church
[1:03:50] so it will look like God's original
[1:03:52] church and of course it didn't take long
[1:03:55] until that happened now we see then that
[1:03:58] in the Ephesian Church age they begin to
[1:04:00] get away from that first love that God
[1:04:02] gave them which was divine Love by
[1:04:05] divine nature now we know that the
[1:04:07] prophet tells us then on the day of
[1:04:09] Pentecost whenever those folks receive
[1:04:11] the Holy Ghost but then the Bible goes
[1:04:14] on to tell us that there was added to
[1:04:16] the church daily people that kept coming
[1:04:19] and joining the church and then we find
[1:04:22] that there were some of them that were
[1:04:23] phir phes that believe and no doubt some
[1:04:27] Sadducees that believe and others that
[1:04:29] begin to believe but the Bible doesn't
[1:04:31] say anything about them getting the Holy
[1:04:34] Ghost they just joined up with them and
[1:04:37] then before long they begin to get some
[1:04:40] of the rich folks to come in and some of
[1:04:43] the wealthy people of the cities and so
[1:04:45] on and they begin to say look now we we
[1:04:48] don't need this this type of religion we
[1:04:51] don't need this type where everybody
[1:04:53] screams and and shouts and hollers and
[1:04:55] runs and Praises God we don't need that
[1:04:59] so what did nicolan begin to cry for
[1:05:02] they begin to cry to get away from those
[1:05:05] crying shouting jumping screaming acts
[1:05:09] 238 young
[1:05:11] ones is that right now why because they
[1:05:15] now had become unestablished church now
[1:05:19] in that established church there were
[1:05:21] also preachers of course and there was
[1:05:24] going to be Apostles of course and
[1:05:27] Prophets why well if God used an apostle
[1:05:31] Satan knew better than to use a monkey
[1:05:33] if God would use a pastor Satan wouldn't
[1:05:35] use an elephant if God used a teacher
[1:05:38] Satan wouldn't use a jth if God's going
[1:05:41] to have a man in charge of the church
[1:05:43] called a pastor then Satan said fine
[1:05:45] then that's what I'll get too so I'll
[1:05:48] get men called pastors I'll get men
[1:05:50] called teachers I'll get men called
[1:05:52] evangelists I'll name them the exact
[1:05:55] same thing except they will preach my
[1:05:59] agenda and Satan always looks for men
[1:06:02] who wants to become something God looks
[1:06:05] for men who wants to become
[1:06:08] nothing you see the difference in the
[1:06:10] way we're going don't you so God has
[1:06:12] this church and it's going to be
[1:06:14] constructed by himself nobody else
[1:06:17] nobody else's opinion nobody else's idea
[1:06:20] and then he will build it upon the
[1:06:23] doctrine and the foundation of the
[1:06:25] Apostles and the prophets inspired by
[1:06:27] God and God's giving them now the
[1:06:29] original plan the original format as God
[1:06:32] gave to David and to Solomon the
[1:06:35] original plan of the of the temple that
[1:06:37] was called later Solomon's Temple so it
[1:06:39] was God that gave them the pattern then
[1:06:42] we come to the New Testament and God
[1:06:44] gives them the pattern of what they're
[1:06:46] going to do now they're going to start
[1:06:47] it out with with men just going around
[1:06:50] and trying to be say politicians come on
[1:06:53] now we've got a new relig religion here
[1:06:54] y'all want to just live for Jesus and
[1:06:56] and we'll give everybody so much drop M
[1:06:58] that was the Roman money of that time
[1:07:00] we'll give everybody 10 drop if you if
[1:07:03] you'll give your heart to God and and we
[1:07:05] we'll do this and we'll make you social
[1:07:06] this and that and no is that the way
[1:07:08] they're going to do it is that the way
[1:07:10] the Lord is going to propagate this
[1:07:12] church it's got to have the ability to
[1:07:15] reproduce itself so how is it going to
[1:07:17] reproduce are we going to reproduce it
[1:07:20] by handing out tracks or should we have
[1:07:23] sporting now of course the Romans had
[1:07:25] already broke into that and they had the
[1:07:28] Arenas everywhere and they had all
[1:07:30] different types of coliseums and
[1:07:32] sporting events because they were really
[1:07:34] big on that so there's no way the church
[1:07:36] would need to compare to that how is the
[1:07:39] church going to propagate how is the
[1:07:41] church going to survive how is the
[1:07:43] church going to live how is the church
[1:07:45] going to be run what it's got to be God
[1:07:48] that will set all this in order you
[1:07:50] agree so far it would have to be God
[1:07:52] right because God's not said AR now what
[1:07:54] are you all saying God didn't have a
[1:07:56] whole bunch of people say all right now
[1:07:57] I'm going to put this to a vote how many
[1:07:59] things you ought to have preaching well
[1:08:00] somebody say well yeah I think
[1:08:02] preaching's a good idea others say
[1:08:04] preaching what and what we need
[1:08:05] preaching for God never even asked them
[1:08:07] God just said this is what it's going to
[1:08:09] be I'm going to have Apostles prophets
[1:08:11] evangelists pastors and teachers and
[1:08:14] then in the church y'all going to need
[1:08:16] some deacons y'all going to need this
[1:08:17] and that so this is the way that it's
[1:08:19] going to be now do you believe this is
[1:08:21] God's original plan so God then ordained
[1:08:24] this and here Jesus speaks about it and
[1:08:26] then it's going to start being founded
[1:08:29] whenever the Holy Ghost comes back on
[1:08:30] the day of Pentecost and then God is
[1:08:33] going to form now remember this is the
[1:08:35] alpha or the beginning of the church
[1:08:38] whatever God does originally you can go
[1:08:41] back to it every time because he cannot
[1:08:43] change his program so God calls One
[1:08:46] god-given messenger out of every age and
[1:08:49] then he will give the word the light of
[1:08:52] God as we looked at the eye in the horn
[1:08:55] the horn representing the church the eye
[1:08:57] representing the messenger of the day
[1:08:59] through him the light of God begins to
[1:09:02] penetrate into the church and the church
[1:09:04] will hear the voice of God they'll know
[1:09:07] how they should conduct themselves well
[1:09:09] should we go to church should we
[1:09:10] assemble remember they never assemble
[1:09:13] quite like that before now in the Old
[1:09:14] Testament they'd get together at certain
[1:09:16] feasts and then they wouldn't see one
[1:09:18] another from months on in but God said I
[1:09:21] don't want that to happen in the New
[1:09:22] Testament as a matter of fact it must
[1:09:24] have been quite unusual because actually
[1:09:26] they began together on the first day of
[1:09:29] the week which was the Lord's day which
[1:09:31] was of course on Sunday now I realize
[1:09:34] there's there's a group of el of people
[1:09:36] in the Gentiles the still are sabit
[1:09:38] Terian and they want to be able to try
[1:09:40] to worship on Saturday that's fine they
[1:09:42] want to do that but that is not the Seal
[1:09:44] of God but the disciples in the New
[1:09:47] Testament they begin to start something
[1:09:50] that was different than the Old
[1:09:51] Testament in that they were starting to
[1:09:53] meet on a regular basis wow so they
[1:09:57] would in the Old Testament maybe go to
[1:09:59] go to the meeting house and they me
[1:10:01] there at the temple bring their
[1:10:02] sacrifice they would stay there together
[1:10:04] a couple of days and then they wouldn't
[1:10:06] come back for three or four months until
[1:10:08] some other type of feast and then they'd
[1:10:10] come back again but God said no that
[1:10:12] won't work now I want my people to be in
[1:10:15] fellowship with each other I want them
[1:10:17] to be in fellowship with me so I want
[1:10:21] this to be a regular Gathering
[1:10:24] together of my people so I can meet with
[1:10:29] them and then they started singing songs
[1:10:32] and hymns I remember David did that of
[1:10:34] course in the Old Testament and they had
[1:10:36] the coites they had the Levites they had
[1:10:39] the men that was the musicians and so on
[1:10:41] and much of the Psalms of course was
[1:10:43] written to them and they would sing but
[1:10:45] they'd never quite done it like the New
[1:10:47] Testament so the first service that they
[1:10:50] begin to have how unusual it must have
[1:10:52] been but it was the great great Builder
[1:10:56] constructing on the on the earth what he
[1:10:59] wanted to call now his church so the
[1:11:02] preachers never got up and preached
[1:11:04] about the next mayor that's going to run
[1:11:07] and you know there was no politicians
[1:11:08] standing up there saying all the things
[1:11:10] that the preacher say in this day and
[1:11:12] time they weren't standing up there and
[1:11:14] trying to just please everybody but they
[1:11:16] preached the gospel they preach
[1:11:18] salvation they preach water baptism in
[1:11:22] the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:11:24] they preach the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:27] Ghost is that right so this is the thing
[1:11:30] then that God started now you imagine
[1:11:33] for the first several months and say on
[1:11:35] up into six months or a year and the
[1:11:38] devil is just kind of learning as this
[1:11:40] thing is going he's never seen anything
[1:11:42] quite like it they're meeting together
[1:11:44] and they're talking and they're singing
[1:11:46] and then these one guys get up and
[1:11:48] they're they're preaching and they call
[1:11:50] call the meeting to order and they just
[1:11:52] sing a little and they talk about the
[1:11:54] goodness of God and and they didn't know
[1:11:56] exactly how to go about themselves so
[1:11:59] they would just get up and feel led of
[1:12:00] the spirit of God to preach and they'd
[1:12:02] preach a little bit and testify and
[1:12:04] maybe have some to stand and sing of the
[1:12:06] glory of God and then they'd go to
[1:12:08] laying hands on the sick cuz that was in
[1:12:10] the original commission and they begin
[1:12:12] to form them church
[1:12:15] services you imagine as Satan began to
[1:12:18] look on it and he thought this is
[1:12:21] amazing this is am amazing I love this
[1:12:27] idea I want a church too I think I see
[1:12:31] now what God wants God wants to meet
[1:12:35] with his people on a regular basis and
[1:12:38] and and I I can see what it does to them
[1:12:41] it actually makes them magnetized to his
[1:12:45] Persona it it does something to them
[1:12:48] that the law never did it's it's
[1:12:51] actually helping them love one another
[1:12:52] better and that they're actually
[1:12:54] enjoying going to this and they're
[1:12:57] really enjoying being there so then you
[1:12:59] know the CH first church and that was in
[1:13:00] Jerusalem and then it began they begin
[1:13:02] to spread out so they went one here and
[1:13:04] there and there and by the time that
[1:13:06] Paul begins to write that there was a
[1:13:08] church in Corinth there was a church in
[1:13:11] Philippi there was a church here there
[1:13:13] was a church there by the time John
[1:13:15] began to write in the Book of Revelation
[1:13:17] there was churches now that have spread
[1:13:19] abroad in caposa they spread into Spain
[1:13:22] they spread into Europe so the gospel
[1:13:25] had begin to spread forth and everywhere
[1:13:28] they would go they begin to ordain
[1:13:31] churches I want you to listen now this
[1:13:34] is something that is totally new even to
[1:13:38] that world which would have been the
[1:13:39] modern world at that time they had never
[1:13:41] seen anything quite like this now the
[1:13:44] Temple of Diana of course was in several
[1:13:46] places and they would do something
[1:13:48] similar but yet it was not like this
[1:13:51] because there was something alive in
[1:13:54] these services so they would go and they
[1:13:57] would sing and they would worship and
[1:13:59] they would cry and the the difference
[1:14:01] one of the main differences of course
[1:14:03] was it was the Fountain of Life and
[1:14:05] Truth um the the idol worshippers most
[1:14:08] of them had uh all of these goddesses
[1:14:11] and Priests and priestesses and all of
[1:14:14] that and they had horrible horrible
[1:14:16] things that they did but these people
[1:14:19] were coming together and they were
[1:14:20] crying and they were worshiping and they
[1:14:23] were repenting of their wrong and then
[1:14:26] they would come up and they would sing
[1:14:28] and the spirit of God would gather among
[1:14:31] them and they would just love one
[1:14:33] another and oh my goodness and Satan
[1:14:35] thought this is
[1:14:37] awful this is absolutely
[1:14:40] horrible I cannot believe I let this
[1:14:44] happen right in front of me I didn't
[1:14:48] consider this a threat when I saw this
[1:14:51] first thing called a Church a that what
[1:14:54] they're calling it church I I can't
[1:14:56] believe that I did not recognize what a
[1:15:00] threat this really was but I can see
[1:15:04] this is worse than a
[1:15:06] wildfire this is a
[1:15:08] contagion it's catching on everywhere
[1:15:11] these guys go they're giving it's like
[1:15:15] somehow they've got life in them some
[1:15:18] way and when they get there it jumps out
[1:15:22] of them and other people get it and it's
[1:15:25] like they're becoming almost infected
[1:15:28] with
[1:15:29] this no it was actually sealed with it
[1:15:32] it wasn't an infection it was
[1:15:35] predestination but you watch him now as
[1:15:37] he begin to look at this and he he's
[1:15:39] learning he's learning as the move of
[1:15:42] God is starting to grow and begin its
[1:15:45] infancy and another time of course if
[1:15:47] Paul writes 1 Corinthians 55 ad
[1:15:49] something like that it is already now
[1:15:51] the churches are set in order and now
[1:15:53] you've got many of the Corinthian Church
[1:15:55] you know I'd like to bring it to you
[1:15:56] sometime I've studied it several years
[1:15:58] ago taking each one of the New Testament
[1:16:00] churches taking the positives and the
[1:16:02] negatives the drawbacks and the great
[1:16:03] things they had and the faults they had
[1:16:05] in each one of them and being able to
[1:16:07] compare and show you even the then it
[1:16:10] was exactly as it is today that there
[1:16:12] were no perfect churches in the New
[1:16:13] Testament so if you're looking for one
[1:16:15] let me just save you a lot of waste of
[1:16:17] time you ain't going to find more
[1:16:19] anywhere you got a bunch of people
[1:16:21] coming together you're going to have
[1:16:22] problems I don't care if it's Walmart
[1:16:24] Kroger baseball game or the church house
[1:16:26] you're going to have problems because
[1:16:28] everybody's opinion is so different and
[1:16:30] this is why that God had to have a
[1:16:33] designated plan and he himself was not
[1:16:36] only the architect the designer but also
[1:16:40] the Builder he did not just say I will
[1:16:42] be the architect of the church and then
[1:16:44] you all can change things if you need to
[1:16:46] now we changed many things on this
[1:16:48] building here I think sometimes that the
[1:16:51] architect only to draw draw it up to
[1:16:53] give brother Michael something to go by
[1:16:55] then he can make all the changes from
[1:16:56] there cuz he made plenty of them that's
[1:16:58] what I said about Carol whenever we
[1:16:59] built our house I told Brother L I said
[1:17:02] look I only ordered these plans and give
[1:17:04] Carol something to go by and there'll be
[1:17:06] many changes that'll happen thereafter
[1:17:08] and they did because she didn't like
[1:17:11] this and she didn't like that but hey
[1:17:12] she's the queen to the house I want her
[1:17:14] to be happy so what God didn't say now
[1:17:17] look if y'all need to modify chain S
[1:17:19] they said no no no no no I'm the
[1:17:21] architect I'm the designer
[1:17:23] and I am also the Builder but the
[1:17:26] problem is then that Satan wants to put
[1:17:28] people in that same church move now he
[1:17:31] does not want to just make his group
[1:17:34] totally separate and say well y'all do
[1:17:37] whatever you want to do we'll leave you
[1:17:39] alone you leave us
[1:17:41] alone oh no he realizes in order to try
[1:17:45] to bring the real move of God under his
[1:17:49] control he has to infiltrate that move
[1:17:53] move and try to project his own agenda
[1:17:56] into that move his own headship which
[1:17:59] will make it contrary to the headship of
[1:18:02] the word of God now he will do it by
[1:18:05] different means depends on the area
[1:18:07] depends on you know as the prophet said
[1:18:09] certain things that works in a certain
[1:18:11] area will go over and he said other
[1:18:13] areas it won't work at all that not only
[1:18:15] works in the kingdom of God it also
[1:18:17] works in the Kingdom of hell but Satan
[1:18:20] knew that he would have to interject so
[1:18:22] much of this stuff in there with another
[1:18:25] headship in mind so you've got a a
[1:18:27] godall man will say you got godall
[1:18:29] people that love the Lord and they're a
[1:18:31] part of that body and Satan begin to
[1:18:34] interject his own people inside of there
[1:18:37] with another headship then they begin to
[1:18:39] question this and question that well I
[1:18:42] don't understand I don't understand why
[1:18:44] we have to do that and no doubt some of
[1:18:46] the women and the Corinthian Church I
[1:18:47] don't understand why in the world we
[1:18:49] can't preach cuz some of them thought
[1:18:50] they were and it must have been very
[1:18:52] hard of them because many of them were
[1:18:53] prostitutes of the goddesses and so on
[1:18:56] that they come out of and they were the
[1:18:58] leaders in the church
[1:19:00] worship oh you didn't know that they
[1:19:02] were Absolut the leaders in idolatry the
[1:19:05] women were not the men So then whenever
[1:19:08] they got saved some of them had that
[1:19:10] same idea well they wanted to come in
[1:19:12] the church and preach a little bit and
[1:19:13] Paul said no you women you ain't
[1:19:15] supposed to do
[1:19:19] that well you know already Satan wanted
[1:19:22] to try to interject something into this
[1:19:24] great plan so Paul had to write of
[1:19:26] course in Corinthians more than any
[1:19:27] other church about all these things that
[1:19:30] was going on why why was this written
[1:19:32] because the headship of another being is
[1:19:36] trying to come into the church now I
[1:19:37] want to ask you Brothers here tonight
[1:19:39] are there any of your brothers in here
[1:19:41] that would like to share your
[1:19:44] wife with another
[1:19:50] man praise the Lord any brothers like to
[1:19:54] share your wife with any other man would
[1:19:58] you be okay with your wife having two
[1:20:05] heads neither does
[1:20:09] God neither does God now that's what
[1:20:12] Satan wanted to do he wanted to
[1:20:15] interject himself into the church in the
[1:20:18] way similar way that he interjected
[1:20:21] himself into the serpent in order to get
[1:20:24] to Eve's bedding ground then by doing
[1:20:27] that he can inject himself into the
[1:20:31] human race by vicariously fathering a
[1:20:35] child then all of us sitting here
[1:20:38] tonight are still affected in our flesh
[1:20:42] by what happened by that one act in the
[1:20:45] Garden of Eden that's why our flesh
[1:20:47] can't go to heaven in this form it's got
[1:20:49] to be changed now I know people don't
[1:20:52] like you to quote this but I'm going to
[1:20:53] quote it anyhow the prophet said when
[1:20:55] you see a naval he said you know it's a
[1:20:57] sign of a renegade so hello Mr Miss
[1:21:00] Renegade glad to meet you I'm Mr
[1:21:01] Renegade too so Satan was able to
[1:21:05] interject himself into the human race
[1:21:07] and if we look back into the Garden of
[1:21:09] Eden would see he repeats the same thing
[1:21:11] when the New Testament Church is being
[1:21:13] founded so then the Lord Jesus
[1:21:16] establishes his church and he gives them
[1:21:19] everything they're going to need down to
[1:21:21] the ages and he starts with exactly the
[1:21:23] same pattern that'll be repeated over
[1:21:26] and over and over again I mean looked at
[1:21:28] it in the saman church age and every
[1:21:30] Church age you have exactly the same
[1:21:32] pattern that is why the light comes from
[1:21:35] through God some God s messenger rather
[1:21:37] in a certain area then from that
[1:21:40] messenger there spreads the light
[1:21:42] through the ministry of others who have
[1:21:46] been Faithfully tall now God never
[1:21:48] intended then for just Paul one man to
[1:21:51] be the one that that would have it
[1:21:53] everybody else would just pass around
[1:21:55] his tapes or books as it were in that
[1:21:57] day but there were others that were
[1:21:59] supposed to come and have received the
[1:22:02] same life but of course all those who go
[1:22:04] out don't always learn how necessary it
[1:22:07] is to speak only now listen
[1:22:12] speak
[1:22:14] speak
[1:22:16] speak well apparently that's preacher
[1:22:19] in
[1:22:21] speak speak is a verb sir not press play
[1:22:27] Speak only what the messenger has spoken
[1:22:30] remember Paul warned the people to say
[1:22:33] only what he said wasn't that quite bold
[1:22:36] no he's given the commission of God to
[1:22:39] be the master builder remember we read
[1:22:41] that scripture some weeks ago and Paul
[1:22:43] said he was a master builder How could a
[1:22:46] man say that under divine inspiration of
[1:22:49] God now if it is Christ which is deity
[1:22:53] inside of him then it should be the same
[1:22:55] spirit of God inside of us notice the
[1:22:58] prophet goes on to say then that Paul
[1:23:01] admonished them to say only what he had
[1:23:04] said If any man think himself to be a
[1:23:06] prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge
[1:23:09] now listen let him acknowledge that the
[1:23:12] things which I write unto you are the
[1:23:16] Commandments of the Lord now this is
[1:23:18] pretty bold and Brazen but this is a man
[1:23:21] who knows what he's called to be this is
[1:23:23] God's way of carrying out the original
[1:23:26] plan by project his thoughts now
[1:23:29] remember a prophets made different than
[1:23:31] us he's made so that his subconscious
[1:23:33] and first conscience lay so close
[1:23:35] together that God can project himself
[1:23:38] right into that subconscious by the
[1:23:40] Supernatural and that's the way the
[1:23:42] validated thus sayeth the Lord is
[1:23:44] absolutely perfect now it's not like a
[1:23:46] man or woman that feels inspired and
[1:23:48] they speak in tongues or prophesy and it
[1:23:51] might be right and it about might be
[1:23:52] wrong but God never never committed the
[1:23:56] way of thus sayith the Lord to being an
[1:24:00] iffy situation so a prophet is the
[1:24:03] special creation of God so God can
[1:24:06] project to him his thoughts and it is
[1:24:10] absolutely infallible amen praise the
[1:24:14] Lord I'm glad myself aren't you now
[1:24:16] notice they add here they take away
[1:24:19] there soon the message is no longer pure
[1:24:21] and the re bival dies down now in order
[1:24:26] of course for God to be able to perate
[1:24:28] this church how will the church be able
[1:24:30] to reproduce itself because the church
[1:24:33] is in feminist form it is that part of
[1:24:36] the attribute of God that projected from
[1:24:38] eternity so how will the female be able
[1:24:42] to reproduce herself now there's no
[1:24:43] question in our minds I don't think that
[1:24:45] churches and America around the world
[1:24:48] are reproducing but how what kind of
[1:24:51] seed are they producing it so you know
[1:24:53] it's all part of every church I don't
[1:24:55] care what they believe what the
[1:24:57] foundation of their Doctrine is every
[1:24:59] Church wants to grow every Church wants
[1:25:02] to get bigger and get more members they
[1:25:06] want more people to come to their Church
[1:25:08] they want more people to have what they
[1:25:10] have because naturally they think a r or
[1:25:12] they wouldn't be there right and they
[1:25:15] want more people people in their
[1:25:16] Community people in their family so what
[1:25:19] do they do they begin to tell people oh
[1:25:21] come to our Church M we we've got this
[1:25:24] pastor and we've got this you know this
[1:25:25] this whatever it is so they use these
[1:25:28] different things and they actually are
[1:25:29] trained some of them and they are able
[1:25:31] to go out and knock on doors and be able
[1:25:34] to hand out little things you know to be
[1:25:36] able to get people's attention because
[1:25:38] they want their Church to grow well we
[1:25:40] do too in one sense of the word we want
[1:25:43] our church to grow but we we we approach
[1:25:46] it differently we want our church to
[1:25:49] grow by the spirit of God being able to
[1:25:52] deal with people's hearts and bring them
[1:25:55] to a saving knowledge if they're not
[1:25:57] saved of what the Lord Jesus did at
[1:25:59] Calvary is that right and if they are
[1:26:02] saved and not Sanctified then we want
[1:26:04] them to grow into that if they're saved
[1:26:06] and Sanctified and don't have the Holy
[1:26:08] Ghost we want them to grow into that and
[1:26:10] then we want them to grow into the
[1:26:12] revelation of the end time word where
[1:26:14] that God will be able to be word on top
[1:26:17] of word on top of word till they'll be
[1:26:19] able to be changed in a moment and the
[1:26:21] twinkle of an eye but we don't go
[1:26:24] through the ball and hand out little
[1:26:26] cards and we don't go the typical Church
[1:26:29] way of trying to get people to join our
[1:26:32] church neither do we try to call people
[1:26:35] on the phone and say now why don't you
[1:26:37] come over to our church and and leave
[1:26:39] your church cuz y y y'all y'all ain't
[1:26:41] hearing the truth and y'all going to
[1:26:42] hell and you know no we we don't believe
[1:26:45] in
[1:26:47] proelite there ain't going to be no
[1:26:49] thieves in heaven that includes preacher
[1:26:53] thieves some of the biggest thieves
[1:26:55] you'll ever know about are preacher
[1:26:57] thieves ones that steal
[1:27:00] sheep uhhuh ones that Ste sheep they
[1:27:04] done it in the days of Paul and they've
[1:27:06] done it all down through time that's
[1:27:08] right but yet we're not interested in
[1:27:10] that right we're on the same page right
[1:27:13] we're not interested in and in trying to
[1:27:15] bring people from somebody else's church
[1:27:18] just so we can say well we've got a big
[1:27:20] church and we've got a large and we got
[1:27:22] to Big this and that and the other I
[1:27:24] tell you what we got we got a big God we
[1:27:26] got a big God and we got a big city
[1:27:28] we're going to and a big Mighty heavenly
[1:27:31] father that loves us and we want to get
[1:27:33] our eyes off of anything big about us
[1:27:36] that's right but we do want everyone
[1:27:39] that he wants here with us now whoever
[1:27:41] that is then I trust him and I tell him
[1:27:43] all the time lord I want only who you
[1:27:46] want to be a part of our assembly that's
[1:27:48] all I want and I tell people if people
[1:27:50] come and talk to me and the are thinking
[1:27:52] about moving here or coming here from
[1:27:54] some other state or whatever more I tell
[1:27:56] them look I want you I told somebody not
[1:27:57] long ago if if God wants you here I want
[1:28:00] you here if God don't want you here I
[1:28:03] don't want you here because you'll come
[1:28:05] and you won't be happy and you'll make
[1:28:07] us unhappy while you're unhappy so if
[1:28:09] God wants you here that's exactly who I
[1:28:12] want I have never pulled on one person
[1:28:16] never in my Decades of preaching I have
[1:28:19] never pulled on one individual I have
[1:28:22] never offered one individual a position
[1:28:25] to come here oh that's done all the time
[1:28:28] oh we'll make you the singer we'll make
[1:28:30] you the third violinist and we'll make
[1:28:32] you the 14th backup on the piano and
[1:28:35] that you're the 27th back up on the bass
[1:28:38] guitar and you come to find out a lot of
[1:28:40] folks their main reason for switching
[1:28:42] churches many times is because they get
[1:28:45] a position that's right position means
[1:28:48] more to a lot of folks than eating right
[1:28:51] some folks will eat out of a garbage can
[1:28:54] as long as they can get a position and
[1:28:57] then they sneak and stream other
[1:28:59] preachers
[1:29:00] Services well preached brother Donnie
[1:29:03] now you realize that of course the Lord
[1:29:05] knew all of this would come now the Lord
[1:29:09] knew that oh my goodness one of the most
[1:29:11] horrible things that would be used down
[1:29:14] through time as far as instruments of
[1:29:16] Darkness God knew one of the most
[1:29:18] horrible things that would ever be used
[1:29:20] by the devil would be
[1:29:23] preachers good
[1:29:28] lord it's absolutely
[1:29:31] unbelievable the
[1:29:33] instrumentality of preachers and people
[1:29:36] of influence now whether it's a you know
[1:29:39] denominational guy or whether it's a
[1:29:41] Pentecostal guy my look I wonder how
[1:29:44] many actually that will stand before the
[1:29:46] Lord that day and say I cast out Devils
[1:29:49] I heal the sick I done this and that and
[1:29:51] the other and will wind up being
[1:29:54] lost and then the thousands or hundreds
[1:29:56] or whatever more of people that followed
[1:29:59] them all these TV preachers friends they
[1:30:02] are as rotten as they can be come on
[1:30:06] some of them ain't even
[1:30:09] saved come on
[1:30:13] now and yet Satan projects them and
[1:30:16] people get hurt by them and taken
[1:30:18] advantage of and then what did they do
[1:30:20] they put all pre in one big pile well
[1:30:23] don't put me in that pile cuz I don't
[1:30:25] belong in that pile there's Brothers
[1:30:27] here in this church that are genuine
[1:30:29] sincere men of God they don't belong on
[1:30:30] that pile either there's Brothers all
[1:30:32] over the world that stand for the truth
[1:30:34] of the Gospel that do not belong in that
[1:30:36] Heap that's what call called them they
[1:30:39] would Heap to themselves teachers having
[1:30:43] itching
[1:30:44] ears so the Lord knew that well why
[1:30:47] didn't he avoid that because that was
[1:30:50] his choice to use God God called
[1:30:52] Ministry he knew Satan would impersonate
[1:30:56] he knew that Satan would impersonate
[1:30:59] discernment and Satan would impersonate
[1:31:02] tongues in interpretation I know we
[1:31:04] don't hear quoted much around the
[1:31:05] message but in Harvest Time the prophet
[1:31:07] tells us the devil can hand out them
[1:31:10] Supernatural gifts by the
[1:31:13] handfuls by the handfuls the devil can
[1:31:17] hand them out oh my goodness now what's
[1:31:20] he going to hand them out to well
[1:31:22] they'll hand them out to different types
[1:31:23] of people depending on their influence
[1:31:26] and what they can do to be able to pull
[1:31:28] people away from the original church and
[1:31:31] always Satan's work will be more flowery
[1:31:34] it'll be more Hollywood it'll be more of
[1:31:37] a glitter and you know all that sort of
[1:31:39] thing and acceptable with everybody and
[1:31:41] loved by everybody nobody has nothing
[1:31:45] bad to say about him or nothing like
[1:31:47] that and Satan will always paint his up
[1:31:50] and he will make God's choice look so so
[1:31:53] small and so reproached and so
[1:31:57] misunderstood and so so hated by the
[1:32:01] world always and yet God says that's my
[1:32:05] wife that's my people that's who I put
[1:32:08] my Vindication on right now think if God
[1:32:12] is going to build this work himself and
[1:32:15] going to call it as he called it his
[1:32:17] church then he's going to have to have a
[1:32:19] Divine protocol by which this thing will
[1:32:22] be started God must build in it the
[1:32:25] ability for it to be able to reproduce
[1:32:27] itself because that's God's original Law
[1:32:28] of reproduction we can find that in the
[1:32:30] Book of Genesis where that the seed was
[1:32:33] in every kind now we know that the seed
[1:32:34] started out by the spoken word and then
[1:32:37] the trees begin to come up out of the
[1:32:38] earth and then God said let every tree
[1:32:40] bring forth of its kind of its seed
[1:32:43] which is in itself now it STS out with
[1:32:45] the seed spoken word then it comes up
[1:32:47] out of the ground bust up out of the
[1:32:49] ground for those that produce fruits
[1:32:51] then where does the seed wind up in the
[1:32:55] Apple where does it wind up starts in
[1:32:57] the ground comes through a process and
[1:32:59] then it winds up in the Apple itself so
[1:33:02] the Apple contains the seed a
[1:33:05] multiplication of the seed form that was
[1:33:08] in the ground that came from the spoken
[1:33:10] word is that right so then the fruit
[1:33:13] Bears the seed I it it really bothers me
[1:33:16] when I hear preachers blasting the fruit
[1:33:18] of the spirit cuz you think they don't
[1:33:19] even know what they're talking about
[1:33:21] they're blow we don't need the fruit of
[1:33:22] the spirit why the Pharisees had the
[1:33:24] fruit of the spirit they did not have
[1:33:26] the Holy Ghost they did not have the
[1:33:28] token life they could not produce a
[1:33:30] genuine fruit of the spirit in the same
[1:33:33] way and measure that a child of God can
[1:33:36] oh you say well I want the see well if
[1:33:38] you produce the fruit open up your Apple
[1:33:40] open up your Peach Your Plum your pear
[1:33:43] and what do you find inside the fruit
[1:33:46] the seed so the seed then comes to its
[1:33:49] fruition once it produces is the fruit
[1:33:52] this is where we are Mount Treetop in
[1:33:55] the last day so this is the attraction
[1:33:58] in the last hour and it's no re no
[1:34:01] wonder why that Satan is absolutely
[1:34:03] coming against a church like never
[1:34:05] before now as you know I'm in contact
[1:34:08] with many ministers all over the world
[1:34:10] I've never seen a Time the way it's been
[1:34:12] the last three or four years that the
[1:34:13] devil is attacking the ministry if it's
[1:34:16] not the health of the ministry it will
[1:34:19] be their family or it will be the church
[1:34:22] that they preach to or it will be just
[1:34:24] constant something going on all the time
[1:34:27] I don't know how many preachers that I
[1:34:29] know of right now that are dealing with
[1:34:31] all kinds of trouble either physical or
[1:34:35] or mental or psychological or problem
[1:34:37] why Satan attacking them with everything
[1:34:40] if he can get them leaders down get them
[1:34:43] depressed get them sad get them weary
[1:34:47] and then they just study a little bit
[1:34:49] and give you a little round mouth sermon
[1:34:51] and say go on back home now little
[1:34:52] children then what's he going to do
[1:34:55] you're not going to be strong to be able
[1:34:57] to meet the challenge in your hour but
[1:34:59] I'd like to let hell know tonight God
[1:35:02] has got some men of God that despite
[1:35:05] sickness despite disappointment despite
[1:35:08] sorrow despite misunderstanding and all
[1:35:11] kinds of other things they are anointed
[1:35:13] to speak the word they're going to not
[1:35:16] compromise they're not giving into hell
[1:35:18] they're not giving into sickness they're
[1:35:20] not giving into the devil they are
[1:35:23] preaching the word and they are getting
[1:35:25] abroad ready for the
[1:35:29] Rapture
[1:35:33] Hallelujah Brothers Let's jump down to 1
[1:35:36] Corinthians chapter 4 verse1 15 we'll
[1:35:38] jump over a couple of these quotes here
[1:35:42] now watch the pattern of how a god call
[1:35:45] man was inspired by the Holy Ghost to
[1:35:48] write in the first church age 1
[1:35:50] Corinthians 4:15
[1:35:52] for though you have
[1:35:55] 10,000
[1:35:57] instructors in
[1:35:59] Christ
[1:36:01] wow
[1:36:03] yet have you not many
[1:36:06] fathers there's a great difference
[1:36:09] between an
[1:36:11] instructor and a father oh yeah an
[1:36:14] instructor may or may not have the power
[1:36:18] of reproduction or begetting
[1:36:23] they can make followers after themselves
[1:36:27] I don't want you to be a reaganite I
[1:36:29] want you to be a son or daughter of God
[1:36:32] I'll tell you one thing if that's all
[1:36:33] you want to be I'm disappointed in you
[1:36:35] tonight just to be a reaganite no you
[1:36:38] need to set your goals way higher than
[1:36:40] me you need to set your goals higher
[1:36:42] than any man that's ever lived on the
[1:36:44] earth set them to the Lord Jesus so Paul
[1:36:48] by now there was already this division
[1:36:51] that was going on so there were some
[1:36:53] that did not have the power of begettal
[1:36:56] in other words they did not pack the
[1:36:59] seed germ in them now if you don't
[1:37:02] believe me this and you listen to spoken
[1:37:03] words Original Seed also end time seed
[1:37:05] sign in Tiff in Georgia and 1962 you
[1:37:08] heard the prophet saying the same thing
[1:37:10] that God was going to plant the way the
[1:37:12] church was going to grow in the body so
[1:37:16] the body would pack within itself the
[1:37:20] ability to reproduce itself so how what
[1:37:23] is the Greater Works imparting eternal
[1:37:28] life eternal life now many can study
[1:37:33] just by the Mind study the Bible study
[1:37:35] the Greek study the Hebrew study the
[1:37:37] message and be able to get up and give a
[1:37:39] good little talk of some sort and I hate
[1:37:41] to say friend but that's what some of
[1:37:43] the preachers are on the message they're
[1:37:44] just intellectual they study and they
[1:37:47] can talk oh I had one s and talk with me
[1:37:49] some time ago and and he was coming
[1:37:51] talking to me asking me for advice and
[1:37:53] as he sat there and he started telling
[1:37:56] me that he was called to do this and
[1:37:57] that and the other and he basically was
[1:38:00] giving me his resume well I I I went to
[1:38:03] this company and I turned it around and
[1:38:05] I went here and I turned this company
[1:38:07] around and I I done this and I turned
[1:38:09] this company around I thought called to
[1:38:11] do something for the Living God what in
[1:38:13] the world is your success as a
[1:38:16] businessman got to do with
[1:38:20] that if we could give Peter a resume now
[1:38:23] brother Peter we want to give you a
[1:38:25] resume right here tonight and uh we want
[1:38:27] you to fill this out uh brother Donnie I
[1:38:30] can't write my own name would you care
[1:38:32] to fill it out and I'll put a big X
[1:38:33] there uh now James what about you well
[1:38:36] the Bible says they were ignorant and
[1:38:38] unlearned men but there's one thing they
[1:38:41] did take note of they had been with
[1:38:43] Jesus so you could have an instructor oh
[1:38:47] they could instruct the word and lay the
[1:38:49] word and lay the word but they don't
[1:38:51] don't have the ability for Christ to
[1:38:53] reproduce himself through them but if
[1:38:55] you'll notice what they do they
[1:38:58] themselves father the people in their
[1:39:02] church then you'll watch the church WIll
[1:39:05] begin to take on the image of that man
[1:39:08] in the Pulpit why because he is actually
[1:39:11] the one that is bringing them
[1:39:14] in that's why they can't sneeze without
[1:39:17] him anybody preaches in the church they
[1:39:20] got to look at him say what he says CU
[1:39:21] they don't know the word themselves
[1:39:23] they're not be begotten of Father God
[1:39:25] they have to constantly have the
[1:39:27] permission from the pastor well come on
[1:39:29] somebody but you see a man who has the
[1:39:32] ability to be be bring forth children
[1:39:36] beget to beget as Paul said I begotten
[1:39:39] you to Christ he was a father so then
[1:39:43] that man that can do that all he is is
[1:39:45] just a carrier of the sea life he is
[1:39:47] actually a unic himself to where he he
[1:39:51] cannot interject his own lie to be able
[1:39:54] to bring forth s in the church so that
[1:39:56] I'll be like him so what you'll find
[1:39:58] when you go to them types of churches
[1:40:00] and you watch them you'll find a
[1:40:02] diversity of people that are there and
[1:40:04] they won't all be well if the pastor
[1:40:06] jer's neck a certain way then you watch
[1:40:09] those that are under the teaching of a
[1:40:11] scholar or a lecturer and they will act
[1:40:14] like him but if that man is simply a
[1:40:18] pass one that will pass the life of God
[1:40:21] they will what you'll find is some
[1:40:22] that'll jump some that'll shout some
[1:40:25] that'll cry glory to God some that'll
[1:40:27] sit there and look at them that's crying
[1:40:28] said man they're emotional L and what is
[1:40:30] it it's that diversity because the
[1:40:33] diversification comes from God but like
[1:40:37] beets like so you watch an instructor as
[1:40:41] his church begins to grow as we say and
[1:40:44] the blessing of the Lord is on us and
[1:40:47] you watch The Offspring and you see is
[1:40:51] that man producing word burst and how do
[1:40:54] they feel about the word give them the
[1:40:56] word test give them the word test now
[1:40:59] this is what they done in the original
[1:41:01] church and whenever they come up to them
[1:41:03] and boy they' go to say them things that
[1:41:05] Paul hadn't said they would withstand
[1:41:08] them to their face and call them
[1:41:13] Liars
[1:41:17] wow amen and the church
[1:41:19] said now watch for though you have
[1:41:22] 10,000 instructors in Christ yet have
[1:41:26] you not
[1:41:27] many
[1:41:29] fathers for in Christ Jesus I have
[1:41:32] begotten you he said through the gospel
[1:41:36] wherefore I beseech you be ye
[1:41:41] followers of
[1:41:44] me look at this word
[1:41:48] followers an imitator
[1:41:52] so Paul baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:41:56] Jesus and preachers in this day and down
[1:41:58] to the ages have baptized in the name of
[1:42:01] father son Holy
[1:42:03] Ghost they're not imitating
[1:42:06] Paul Paul said I speak in
[1:42:10] tongues more than you
[1:42:13] all but some of our message preachers
[1:42:15] don't even believe in speaking in
[1:42:17] tongues they're not an
[1:42:19] imitator well praise the Lord Paul cast
[1:42:22] out Devils heal the
[1:42:24] sick and yet some of our say well we

[1:42:58] will say Amen but until you do I'm going
[1:43:01] to go ahead and pray for some right here

[1:46:13] n thank you
[1:46:18] bre now why
[1:46:21] why because these are the men that were
[1:46:24] inspired with the original
[1:46:27] plan but George Smith told me something
[1:46:29] many years ago brother bram's house out
[1:46:32] in Tucson when they bought the house
[1:46:34] there brother Bram wanteded to add this
[1:46:36] gain room and brother M designed it and
[1:46:38] laid it all out maybe many of you have
[1:46:40] been there and he wanted wanted a a
[1:46:43] place to be able to put his trophies and
[1:46:45] all so the brother that he was going to
[1:46:48] get to build it brother Ram told him he
[1:46:51] said now there'll be all kinds of people
[1:46:53] that'll come in and see it and they'll
[1:46:55] have this idea and that idea and they'll
[1:46:57] want you to do this and that and the
[1:46:58] other he said now you be
[1:47:00] courteous but stick with the
[1:47:06] plan now this is the way we want to do
[1:47:09] when it comes to the gospel we want to
[1:47:12] be courteous to those that say you don't
[1:47:14] need this and you don't need that and
[1:47:16] you need this and you need that and we
[1:47:18] look in the plan and we say now the plan
[1:47:20] don't say that we don't want to get the
[1:47:23] wrong attitude we don't want to get a
[1:47:25] bad bad thing about it but we want to
[1:47:27] just be courteous but stick with the
[1:47:32] plan do we want a book of Acts
[1:47:36] Church do we want an Omega Church which
[1:47:41] reflect the alpha church we'll only get
[1:47:45] it one way that's by following the
[1:47:48] original plan let me have a few more
[1:47:51] minutes and we'll close can I yeah now
[1:47:53] Paul says in 2 Corinthians again chapter
[1:47:56] 1 verse or chapter 1 verse 24 not for
[1:47:59] that we have dominion over your face now
[1:48:02] notice how he wants to put this in there
[1:48:03] we're not trying to be your bosses we're
[1:48:06] not trying to be dictators not that we
[1:48:08] have dominion of your faith but are
[1:48:11] helpers of your joy come on now for by
[1:48:14] faith you stand Philippians 3:17
[1:48:17] Brethren be followers imitate ERS
[1:48:21] together of me and mark
[1:48:25] them which walk so now Paul knew that he
[1:48:30] was going to pass he'd have too many
[1:48:32] years after this was written actually
[1:48:34] and he said now be followers of me and
[1:48:38] then I want you also to mark them which
[1:48:42] walk the way I walk why next generation
[1:48:47] of
[1:48:48] ministry Next Generation of ministry
[1:48:51] keep your eye on them and mark them mark
[1:48:57] them which walk so as ye have us for an
[1:49:03] example look at this word example
[1:49:06] pattern manner in the technical sense
[1:49:08] the pattern in Conformity to which a
[1:49:11] thing
[1:49:12] must you see it this pattern is not a
[1:49:17] suggestion on amen amen that's right it
[1:49:20] either is or it ain't you know who's
[1:49:24] going in the Rapture those who fit the
[1:49:26] pattern you know who's going to be left
[1:49:29] those who don't match the pattern now
[1:49:32] that's not just the churches only that's
[1:49:34] individuals in the
[1:49:36] churches oh
[1:49:38] my notice Philippians
[1:49:41] 3:18 for many
[1:49:43] walk of whom I've told you often and now
[1:49:48] tell you even
[1:49:51] weeping now listen what he says they
[1:49:54] are that they are the
[1:49:57] enemies of the Cross of
[1:50:02] Christ now watch they had come so close
[1:50:06] Harry now they were right around the
[1:50:10] message they were right there among them
[1:50:13] brother
[1:50:15] Larry no doubt said we're preaching
[1:50:17] Christ oh Hallelujah
[1:50:21] Hallelujah but Paul said I'll tell you
[1:50:23] what they are they're
[1:50:25] enemies of the
[1:50:28] Cross but did you notice this man's
[1:50:32] attitude toward them for many walk of
[1:50:35] whom I have told you often and now tell
[1:50:37] you even weeping oh
[1:50:41] yes this is the true Spirit which God
[1:50:45] wants to use to speak to people in an
[1:50:52] error God will never take an angry human
[1:50:57] Spirit to correct
[1:51:01] wrong he don't use that God don't need
[1:51:03] our human angry Spirit now God has an
[1:51:06] angry an anger oh yeah he anoints His
[1:51:09] prophets and his servants to speak that
[1:51:11] way sometimes but there's a difference
[1:51:13] between his anger and human
[1:51:15] anger notice Paul speaking about these
[1:51:19] men
[1:51:20] and they had actually become enemies of
[1:51:22] the Cross of Christ because they were
[1:51:24] some of the guys that was preaching
[1:51:26] circumcision these were some of the guys
[1:51:28] that said you got to keep the law of
[1:51:30] Moses you've got to do this and you got
[1:51:32] to do that oh yeah the cross is good the
[1:51:34] cross is good but you cannot be saved if
[1:51:36] you don't get
[1:51:38] circumcised Paul said they are enemies
[1:51:41] of the Cross yet preaching
[1:51:44] it yet preaching it but not preaching it
[1:51:49] in its reality it
[1:51:51] form and Paul was sitting there as he
[1:51:54] was in the jail which is where this was
[1:51:56] written in prison sitting there in
[1:52:00] prison brother Rob writing this tears
[1:52:04] running down his
[1:52:06] face or you see those preachers or men
[1:52:10] that find pleasure in the fact that
[1:52:13] others are
[1:52:15] inconsistent and they rejoice when they
[1:52:18] hear this man or that man or this church
[1:52:20] or that church is in trouble or or doing
[1:52:23] wrong and and they rejoice it does
[1:52:25] something good to them there's something
[1:52:28] wrong with their
[1:52:32] Spirit friends if we know there are
[1:52:35] people in our church that aren't doing
[1:52:37] right and we know there are churches in
[1:52:40] the message that aren't doing right and
[1:52:42] we
[1:52:43] do and we would Rejoice because of that
[1:52:46] it would make us happy because of it we
[1:52:50] need to pray God will help
[1:52:52] us it should break our
[1:52:56] hearts should break our hearts to hear
[1:52:59] if there's anybody Among Us that's not
[1:53:01] living the kind of Life they should live
[1:53:04] it should break our hearts to hear that
[1:53:06] there's any even on the fringes of our
[1:53:10] message that are not doing
[1:53:13] right why brother Donnie the next verse
[1:53:17] is
[1:53:18] why who
[1:53:21] end is
[1:53:24] destruction whose God is their
[1:53:27] belly whose
[1:53:30] glory is in their
[1:53:33] shame so the very thing they should be
[1:53:36] ashamed of they're glorying in their
[1:53:41] glory is in their shame their Glory oh
[1:53:44] we don't we don't preach that at our
[1:53:46] church we don't go that way and they
[1:53:47] glory in it but it's really their shame
[1:53:51] because they don't preach it yeah then
[1:53:54] we should grieve and pray God please
[1:53:57] help them please God help them there's
[1:54:00] someone in our church that ain't doing
[1:54:02] right God please help them help them to
[1:54:04] realize it's dangerous to come and set
[1:54:07] where the presence of God is and not
[1:54:09] yield to the spirit of
[1:54:12] Goden oh
[1:54:14] my whose glory is in their shame who
[1:54:17] mind Earthly s things to's stand
[1:54:28] together can you see
[1:54:32] tonight why Satan wanted to
[1:54:35] impersonate
[1:54:37] himself as the
[1:54:39] church you realize that's a
[1:54:43] quote he has deceived the People by
[1:54:48] impersonating himself
[1:54:50] as the church yes sir so they sang about
[1:54:54] the blood they sang songs about the
[1:54:56] cross they sing about heaven they sing
[1:55:00] and talk about hell oh he said there's
[1:55:03] such good people good people good people
[1:55:06] yeah till you show them them good
[1:55:07] scriptures yeah and then you'll see a
[1:55:10] side of them that you had never seen
[1:55:14] before M yeah believe me as a pastor I
[1:55:18] get aide of a lot of people that you
[1:55:21] never see I get a side of a lot of
[1:55:24] preachers that you never see you see
[1:55:27] that side they want you to see but I see
[1:55:30] a different side especially when I give
[1:55:33] them the word and give them the
[1:55:35] message uhhuh then you ought to read
[1:55:38] some of the emails I get from preachers
[1:55:41] you ought to read some of the texts I
[1:55:42] get from
[1:55:45] preachers you'd never believe
[1:55:48] it so does that make you happy it breaks
[1:55:51] my
[1:55:54] heart and I hope and pray to God it
[1:55:56] always
[1:55:58] does how many wants to be more like
[1:56:03] Jesus may God help
[1:56:08] us excuse me that we will not only want
[1:56:11] a church like the original church but we
[1:56:15] will so
[1:56:18] feel this is what
[1:56:22] Paul another example that he gave for us
[1:56:29] preachers so when we hear of someone
[1:56:31] going off we hear of you know a move
[1:56:35] over in
[1:56:38] Africa I just heard a song this evening
[1:56:40] sent to me by someone a group a message
[1:56:44] group and they were singing about this
[1:56:47] certain
[1:56:48] man I mean just about worship just
[1:56:51] unbelievable absolutely
[1:56:54] unbelievable I saw a V video of
[1:56:58] of a group in another country many
[1:57:01] thousands of miles
[1:57:03] here and this preacher was walking up um
[1:57:06] between them going in to preach and they
[1:57:09] were bowing down before
[1:57:12] him when he got up to preach later in
[1:57:14] the service they were calling him
[1:57:18] Elohim
[1:57:20] I've stood in that church and
[1:57:27] preached God have
[1:57:31] mercy well brother Donnie you think
[1:57:33] they're sincere you think they're good
[1:57:34] people no doubt they
[1:57:36] are but they got under an evil
[1:57:41] spirit I don't know how much you pray
[1:57:43] for the bride around the
[1:57:45] world but you need
[1:57:48] to you really realize we cannot go home
[1:57:51] as a group until every member of this
[1:57:54] bride gets to her place if there's a
[1:57:57] little girl or a little boy let me quote
[1:58:00] it to you from Tampa 1964 but there's a
[1:58:03] little girl a little boy here born over
[1:58:05] in Seattle Washington and that book
[1:58:07] holds their name we will not go home
[1:58:10] friends he said the church will play
[1:58:13] along slug along have meetings and so
[1:58:16] forth until that child is able to
[1:58:19] receive it do you imagine there might be
[1:58:22] one little boy that's holding up this
[1:58:24] whole thing
[1:58:26] tonight and that little boy's got to get
[1:58:28] saved and got to get filled with the
[1:58:29] Holy Ghost and we're just waiting and
[1:58:32] we're having church on Wednesday and on
[1:58:34] Sunday and we're just meeting and
[1:58:35] Gathering people people all over the
[1:58:37] world doing it but he so loves that
[1:58:39] bride he'll not call that's thousands or
[1:58:42] Millions home and leave one behind I'm
[1:58:44] glad I might be that one a
[1:58:48] you think of this we need to think not
[1:58:51] only local but Global Lord your people
[1:58:55] be merciful Lord I hear there's people
[1:58:58] off in India and this I hear there's
[1:59:00] people off in Africa there I'm not
[1:59:01] interested Lord getting myself involved
[1:59:03] all that but Lord God bring your
[1:59:05] children home bring your children home
[1:59:07] if they got to be removed out from under
[1:59:09] a false prophet Grant it Lord if they
[1:59:10] got to be removed out from under a false
[1:59:12] teacher Grant it Lord do you pray that
[1:59:15] way brother Donnie I absolutely do sir
[1:59:18] yes I do I pray that God will bring his
[1:59:21] people out from under false teaching and
[1:59:25] error we ain't going by
[1:59:30] ourself we're
[1:59:32] going
[1:59:33] Hallelujah as a group around the world
[1:59:37] oh sure God's calling individuals we
[1:59:39] know that but this last group we must
[1:59:41] all go together and no heaven will not
[1:59:45] be in sections well we can't have
[1:59:47] fellowship with them people over there
[1:59:49] cuz we didn't like them down in life and
[1:59:51] we didn't like them people over there
[1:59:53] and then there won't be nobody there
[1:59:54] with that attitude we've got to love one
[1:59:57] another we can disagree and still love
[2:00:00] one
[2:00:01] another praise the Lord oh Jesus let's
[2:00:06] just bow our heads if you
[2:00:10] would wow
[2:00:13] Lord I must
[2:00:16] say I am overwhelmed by the way you took
[2:00:19] this this way
[2:00:22] tonight oh my
[2:00:26] goodness I pray that I'll always be
[2:00:29] sensitive to be able to follow your
[2:00:32] spirit I had all these wonderful
[2:00:34] scriptures and quotes laying before me
[2:00:36] tonight and I didn't hardly get to get
[2:00:38] to none of
[2:00:40] them but great
[2:00:42] architect you're still the designer of
[2:00:44] sermons
[2:00:46] amen may always be sensitive
[2:00:49] to follow your leading
[2:00:53] Lord Heavenly
[2:00:55] Father our building would look different
[2:00:58] than the original
[2:01:01] Church they didn't have no doubt musical
[2:01:03] instruments quite like we
[2:01:06] do no doubt there'd be things that would
[2:01:08] be
[2:01:09] different but Lord we would want our
[2:01:12] Doctrine our principles the foundation
[2:01:14] of our faith to be the same I've tried
[2:01:19] among
[2:01:20] the countries of Latin
[2:01:23] America and their music there is
[2:01:25] different than
[2:01:26] ours the music in Kenya different than
[2:01:30] the music in
[2:01:31] Zimbabwe the music there different from
[2:01:35] India the music there different from
[2:01:37] China and different places that I've
[2:01:39] been in the
[2:01:40] world and you leave it that
[2:01:43] way but yet Lord you we believe you're
[2:01:46] going to have your people to be one in
[2:01:48] Soul
[2:01:49] one in heart one in
[2:01:53] principle oh Jesus gather your people
[2:01:56] together father from around the
[2:01:59] world men always want to try to gather
[2:02:02] them under one certain man so they're
[2:02:05] all listen to his stuff but how carnal
[2:02:08] that is
[2:02:09] Lord gather us in Christ
[2:02:13] Jesus Lord Jesus may your presence so
[2:02:16] move among us here
[2:02:20] father that we can lay aside our little
[2:02:22] pet doctrines and pet
[2:02:24] ideas and be one like never
[2:02:28] before we will always disagree on things
[2:02:31] no
[2:02:32] doubt but I believe tonight you're
[2:02:34] getting a group of people together
[2:02:36] around the world that are coming into
[2:02:39] that Unison and that Harmony of the new
[2:02:43] births oh Jesus get us together father
[2:02:49] get us together so we can leave this
[2:02:53] place we need you
[2:02:55] Lord maybe there's one maybe there's a
[2:02:58] thousand maybe there's 10,000 no way for
[2:03:00] us to know but we know the Rapture will
[2:03:03] not go until every member of that bride
[2:03:06] is in her
[2:03:08] place maybe a little black boy maybe
[2:03:11] living on the
[2:03:13] streets of kinasa maybe a little black
[2:03:17] girl living on the streets of Nairobi
[2:03:21] the
[2:03:22] Congo maybe a little black boy Down in
[2:03:25] Africa somewhere or Florida or New York
[2:03:29] little
[2:03:30] Indian maybe out in the
[2:03:33] reservations oh God wherever they are
[2:03:36] would you get them Lord yes
[2:03:38] Lord this world is getting worse every
[2:03:42] day it's a more unfit place for us to
[2:03:45] live come Lord Jesus
[2:03:49] come Lord
[2:03:50] Jesus take us
[2:03:54] away Lord God if there's any here
[2:03:56] tonight that needs to fix anything in
[2:03:59] their soul in their walk would you help
[2:04:02] them may we be able to move
[2:04:06] Lord into a sphere of love that we've
[2:04:09] never had before a love of your word
[2:04:13] love for your people of course first and
[2:04:16] foremost a a love for you
[2:04:20] and I'm sure Lord that there'll always
[2:04:22] be people that
[2:04:25] maybe will love you a little
[2:04:27] more as I read it to Carol on Monday
[2:04:30] where your Prophet said
[2:04:33] Peter never had that love in his heart
[2:04:37] that John
[2:04:39] had that Peter was more of a
[2:04:41] representative of face but he never
[2:04:44] quite loved you the way John did and I
[2:04:48] thought wow
[2:04:50] so I can't keep from wondering then if
[2:04:51] there even people that come to the
[2:04:54] maturity of love if there won't be some
[2:04:57] that might love you a little more than
[2:04:59] us so help us to realize we're not
[2:05:02] trying to match each other but just
[2:05:05] become mature in all that we can
[2:05:09] be I'll never be what a lot of Great Men
[2:05:12] are in many ways but what I want to be
[2:05:15] is what you want me to be amen I may
[2:05:18] never have the love for you that brother
[2:05:21] Ron Spencer has or brother Tim or maybe
[2:05:24] brother Daryl but Lord I do know this I
[2:05:27] want to love you as much as I can I may
[2:05:30] never have the Fai that some of them
[2:05:33] might have but I want to have all the
[2:05:35] faith that I can have to match all the
[2:05:39] things that I am for your purpose and
[2:05:42] use I just want to be what you want me
[2:05:45] to be amen I want to love you I want to
[2:05:48] serve you I want to be everything that I
[2:05:51] can for your kingdom Lord cuz it isn't
[2:05:55] about me it isn't about these people
[2:05:58] it's about
[2:05:59] us it's about
[2:06:02] you it's about you living in
[2:06:05] US Lord I read it yesterday where your
[2:06:08] Prophet said we're not worshiping a baby
[2:06:10] and a Manger deity and a
[2:06:12] Manger but we're worshiping deity in
[2:06:16] us so that same deity is not laying in
[2:06:21] Bethlehem but deity is right here

[2:19:55] line amen how many's going to believe
[2:19:58] tonight for our
[2:20:00] brother Lord Heavenly Father we thank
[2:20:03] you for what you've allowed doctors to
[2:20:06] be able to do and we
[2:20:09] know dear God that you are the one who
[2:20:13] created the right view of Science and
[2:20:15] man takes it and perverts it and twists
[2:20:17] it around many times but you've allowed
[2:20:19] them to break into so much understanding
[2:20:21] of the human body and what they can do
[2:20:23] but at times they're just stumped They
[2:20:25] Don't Know What to Do Lord and they've
