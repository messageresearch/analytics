one time really touched it'll change your whole life it'll change your world it'll change what you how you look at people I was listening to Brother by the way he was talking about an atmosphere in the atmosphere I don't think I've ever walked out here in this assembly and never walked up here when there wasn't a great atmosphere if you've ever had to stand here and understand I mean my knees are knocking now I mean it's it's not the the thing of standing up in front of people and talking I do that in the classroom but it's the burden of carrying the word you don't want to be a stumbling block and you don't want to get in the way of the Holy Spirit but my wife ever so often she'll send us the quote of the day while I sit back there this popped up on my phone Satan can settle the score when he finds out you've gone on without Jesus that's when Satan will get the church when you get so interested in something else besides prayer meetings when you get so interested that you're supposed to have a natural growth instead of a spiritual growth then remember Satan's on his Road he's caught up he's caught you without him brother Graham says oh God is my prayer wake up the church again is my prayer wake up the church again to old-fashioned all night prayer meeting wake the people to a spiritual atmosphere it takes that to bring the children into the kingdom it takes the atmosphere you can create you can sit in here and create your own atmosphere you could create one or you can allow him to create one if you created one that you don't want to lift your hands you don't want to clap you don't want to say man you don't want to praise the Lord You've created an atmosphere and it will affect those around you that want to so if we can put everything aside this is the only minute that matters in your life come on it's not what I have to say it's got nothing to do with what I got to say I I never have ever stood up here one single time and had an agenda of my own never if I ever do that I'm done I'm finished but if we can just look at it God this is your time my thoughts don't matter anything I can think anything I can do it doesn't matter it's what God can do through you and do through me tonight so if we can create an atmosphere that he feels welcome in that's my prayer to y'all um tonight is that you create an atmosphere that could pull I had a really short notice the shortest ever but after tonight me and brother Daryl is going to be best of friends whether he likes it or not so I might get some stuff so if you will turn in your Bibles tonight if you will be speaking a couple different places Genesis 45. verses 7 through 11. brother Donnie had texted me when I was leaving I'm sure they mentioned it but he asked me to y'all remember sister Erica well Donnie had to take her because brother Lance was in such a way that he couldn't go so we need to Remember by the Lance but sisterica is doing her treatment in the morning at Vanderbilt lift her up and it's just a Cheryl Ward I'm too I'm sure she could use our prayers tonight too so don't forget to mention them in your prayers and God sent me before you to preserve you of posterity in the earth to save your lives by great Deliverance and now it was not that you you that sent me hither but God Joseph's telling his brother and his God that sent me he hath made me a father to pharaoh and Lord to all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt haste she and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son Joseph God hath made me the Lord of all Egypt come down unto me and Terry not and thou that dwell in the land of Goshen that they shall be near unto me thou and thy children thy children's children thy flocks that herds and all that thou Hast and I will nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou in thy household and all thou Hast come to Poverty let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for another time Lord that we can assemble together under your word Lord speak to our hearts Lord I've got nothing all I can ask of you Lord is to make me uh my desire to to be a yielded vessel to get out of the way to to put aside any Humanity father Lord I'm sure that's the same thing they ask of you put anything aside that would hinder them from receiving what you would have for them tonight Lord Lord we lift up prayers for sister Erica Lord we know the situation she's going through Lord may your hand be honored tomorrow as she goes through her treatment Lord we believe her healing we believe it's a finished work Lord you've never started out of work that you didn't finish and we're resting on that Believing on that Glory touch brother Lance Lord and help us his headache father give him healing and comfort in his body Lord I pray to you touch sister share award Lord thank you for those sparing her for any more serious injury today Lord bless your people bless their needs everything they have neither we thank you for Jesus name amen you can be seated if you give me just a few minutes uh I'd like to talk on tonight living in Goshen we've heard brother Brandon refer to this a time or two but looking at Goshen we know that the background Story how Joseph is sold into slavery by his brothers and he's taken into to Egypt and becomes um topographer's servant there and then he gets thrown in prison and all these years that he's in in their and then famine comes to the land and we know the famine is two years in and the brothers are coming to Egypt to get to get food to take back and then we this is the point where in Genesis right after Joseph reveals himself and says I'm your brother go get my father and bring him here into Goshen and we'll look at it in a spiritual aspect too but Joseph gives his family an invitation to come to Goshen and we look at Goshen and we will look in here a little bit more you know and Egypt was the greatest land the greatest country in the land the richest they had everything but there's a little place that was set aside that was called Goshen because we we read in the scriptures how all the things that God the plagues that God was getting ready to put on Egypt because God was calling a people out but we look at Joseph's family we look at Jacob and and all his brothers they were poor they were at this point in poverty and Jacob was in poor health no doubt they were near starvation they had to travel such a far away to get food and then had to travel such a far away when they got back but I like what Joseph tells him he says come to Goshen and there I will nourish thee that's where I will nurse you come to the word and I will nourish you Come As You Are we look at people that says I can't I can't come to church I can't I don't believe you know I've done too many bad things Joseph told him to come as you are they were already in poverty he didn't say get your wealth up and then come come sick come with your burdens come with all that you have come to the word that's what he's telling them and so Joseph tells him says I will nourish thee Joseph had that power Pharaoh had given him power of all of Egypt nobody was eating without Joseph nobody was getting grained without Joseph saying they could have it you're not getting not one thing from this word but an intellectual understanding unless God gives it to you unless God reveals it to you all you will have is a intellectual intellectual understanding knowledge in your brain it will not move you anywhere you might you might make people think you're smart that you can quote the Bible that you can quote scriptures as you can quote brother Branham that's head knowledge but that's not the grain of Egypt it's just knowing that it's there you know it's there but you haven't ate any of it that's what Joseph was telling them they knew it was there because they was traveling to get it they would come to church once in a while they would come once in a while and Joseph would give them a little bit they would leave and they would get sickly they would still get poor Joseph said come to Goshen Exodus 81 I'm sorry there's not 81 chapters Nexus they've been in Egypt a long time each Exodus 8 21-23 else shall thou will not let my people go behold I will send swarms of flies upon the Ebonite servants upon my people and into thy house the houses of Egypt shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground where on they are now we're we're kind of jumping I give you a background we're jumping ahead of the people in Goshen at this point and they are in the word you're in the word God has kept plagues off you darkness is all around you Egypt is total darkness there's plagues all around you every day and there's light in Goshen the plagues were held off of Goshen for a little while don't think just because you're in this word and Goshen type in this word that you're not going to go through trials and tribulations you know and I I believe and I and I say it all the time and I hope it never becomes a cliche to me that there's light and ghosts when you look around and people say this is happening here this is happening here if possible war is going to happen in the politics is so corrupt and you look at that and I in my heart I said there's light in Goshen there's there's light and we'll look at how brother Brandon when he did the seven Church ages and he drew that sliver of life but don't don't let me get too far ahead he said and I will assist sever in that day the land of Goshen in which my people dwell that no swarm of flies shall be there to the end thou mayest know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth and I will put a division between my people and thy people this is Moses telling Pharaoh God's going to put division between his people and your people he's put one up in this day God's put a division people know who you are God drew a line and said these are my people every you don't think every all the Egyptians knew who these people were they knew who they were they knew they were God's people you don't think they didn't know the the stories that they would tell that one day a deliverer is coming they're a rose of pharaoh that didn't know Joseph he didn't know Joseph but he knew there was something about these people that's why I keep in bondage Satan knows there's something about you why do you think he tries to keep you in bondage all the time what puts weight on you all the time burdens on you all the time because there's something about you God has divided you God has put you in a place that is the elite of the elite when the Rapture takes place you're not going to be the ones on the outside the city waiting for somebody inside the city to say you can have rain on your crops God says this is the best of the best and I saved him for last saved him for last but God was going to send them a prophet as we read in in Exodus unless lest you come to poverty why do you think you needed this word don't matter how much money you have what possessions you have what degrees you have without this grain of Egypt which at this time this is the only thing that would sustain them Joseph said you come and I will feed you I will pull you out of poverty without that you're the poorest man on the face of the Earth with it you're the richest it's just that simple but he said I will nourish you lest you fall into poverty the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thine hand towards heaven there might be Darkness across the land of Egypt even darkness that which may be felt Moses stretched forth his hands toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days they saw not one another neither Rose anyone from his place for three days but all of the children of Israel had light in their dwellings the plagues were kept off Goshen for a season you know what you you you we come up here we give a heart we see people give heart to the Lord they get up here on their knees Brothers come up and pray for them they want to get saved they want to get the Holy Ghost they get baptized they come out of the water we've all been there and it just seems like you're walking on clouds you can't believe that coming to God was going to be this great and this easy you've all been there if you've received the Holy Ghost if you've went through that you've been there because God's not going to give you meat the day you get the Holy Ghost yeah so for a season God's keeping his people he's keeping but what I want you to look at is a plague is coming to Goshen a plague's coming now we look at brother Branson question answers on Genesis now look back at the Old Testament when you see the plagues fall and they were in Egypt God was bringing his people out to the promised land Israel never received one plague just as the plagues before they went they went into Goshen is that right the Sun never dimmed out no mosquitoes come no frogs was there no lice was there no storms was there no lightning no killing on the cattle was there and everything they had was preserved in Goshen is that right it's a type of the church going just before the tribulation period when these things begin to come to pass lift up your head your Redemption draws an eye how many can say we see that in this day darkness is everywhere you go to work in Egypt you go to school in Egypt you shop in Egypt you have to live your life in Egypt but everywhere you walk you take that little sliver of light the brother Branham Drew in the layout of scene Church age you take that with you everywhere you go so you can say there's still light in Goshen so when the children of Israel came out of Egypt what happened to Goshen the land stayed there what made Goshen what it was went with them it went with them it didn't stay God didn't say see you I hope y'all make it to Canaan hope you make it to the Jordan River what made Goshen what it was this land of nourishment the pillar of the cloud the pillar fire that that rested over top of Goshen went with him when they left when you go to work every morning you go everywhere you go you wander through the dark darkest places in the land you have to work with some of the filthiest people sinful people in the land you're going to be the only part of Goshen they see a male probably never even hit the word Goshen what does the word Goshen mean s to draw near this was Joseph said I'll draw you near to me this is where I'm placing you when God pulled you into Goshen here it wasn't it wasn't that you wandered around till you found it they didn't find Goshen his family didn't find Goshen Joseph went to them and said I'm bringing you here you didn't wander in off the streets in here God had to come find you and say I want to bring you to this place that I've blessed and nourished it's the only place that you can you can eat and get nourished it's the only place where you could receive the word where you can receive blessings and you won't get it without me why did Pharaoh give it to him why did favor say yes you could have it it's yours because it was Joseph's brethren why did he give it to you why do you give it to me because you was Christ's brother he was your brother you were his sister anything he wanted for his family God said give it to him give it to him because you're his family had nothing to do with with just because they were somebody out in the world when he was Canaan Jacob was probably one of the richest men in Canaan probably the richest man to Pharaoh he was nobody if Joseph wasn't there Jacob was nothing nobody without Christ You're Nobody you think you're something because you might have a name in this message somewhere without him you were nothing you're a piece of dust but with him you are everything you ever wonder why we see the world fallen to pieces around us anymore it's fallen to pieces people are insane I would like to invite every single one in here if you get time go to your local police department go to your local sheriff's department and ride around with them for two weeks I gave him 23 years had all I could take and you hope along the way that you're a light to somebody that you can show Goshen to somebody if you want to see what this world is like spend two weeks riding around with your local law enforcement and then spend one week watching Fox News spend one week's walk to CNN News another week watching CBS because they're all different they've all got their own agenda their own thing that they push listen to your local politicians they're all corrupt they're corrupt listen I know I'm dealing with some local politicians some of the guys that work in in government in the city they could tell you it's going to hell it's going to hell and you're living the best time of your life the world's falling to pieces and this moment right here is the best time you've ever had in your life Jacob never knew he had it so good till he got the Goshen children of Israel never knew they had it so good until they got the Goshen then stuff happened there were Rosie Pharaoh that didn't know Joseph you know Joseph and then think trials test tribulations begin to come upon them I wonder how often right before they were able to leave how often they would go home and cry out to God bring us back the times when Joseph was here yeah bring back the Goshen of Joseph we get that stuck sometimes when David said restore unto me the joy of thy salvation we get stuck like that the children of Israel they remember the times of Joseph because people would tell them the stories how good it was when Joseph and no doubt these people right here been praying for 400 and something years for a deliverer and I wonder how many times their mind would go back and say I wonder what it was like wonder what it was like to be here when Joseph was here to eat of the grain of Egypt to not get our back beat we've been there we've all been there we get stuck in a rut it's Humanity God understands we get stuck in a rut sometimes we wonder where was the God that I had five years ago when I felt like I was on fire for God when he meant everything to me God didn't leave I didn't leave your life got in the way your life the things that you love got in the way your interests instead of trying to create atmosphere you can start your atmosphere out every single morning when you get up sometimes our self-interest get in the way and we get to thinking about those times that we take grain in Egypt we think where's brother Branham where's brother Branham where all the them brothers that brought the word back in the 80s and 90s those days were great he is still here he didn't leave the grain's still here sure you got tests and trials and tribulations in your life you got things in your life that drag you down but you're still in Goshen and he promised to deliver where was God going to bring him out of Goshen that's where he put him it's gonna bring them out do you realize Goshen was not a little town a little country outside of Egypt Goshen is right in the middle of Egypt it's in Egypt you don't travel from country to Country you're in Egypt in case nobody told you you're in Egypt Goshen you are walking living breathing the son light of Goshen that goes and sees people every day that when is with your life as we talk Sunday witnesses to people every day why there's a light that God left on in Goshen when brother Branham came in and put up the church the seven Church ages how many members why brother Brandon wrote that one brother Brandon drew that he said God put it in the heavens first right he put it in the heavens he said in the layout of saying church church age God put it in the heavens total darkness total darkness on that seventh phase God allowed brother Branham to draw that little sliver of light God allowed the prophet of this age to draw you in that little dark area that's what it was when he cleared off a little bitty space of Darkness that was you that was me that that's God that's God's grace if God left it total darkness there have been no hope there would have been no hope you still be total darkness I mean you wouldn't we wouldn't be able to see this word this message if you don't understand that go listen the man can turn on the light there's a man here that can turn on the light seventh day messenger turn on the light and lay Odysseus it was total darkness I'm going too slow but I'm way behind recognizing your day and message and its message brother Brown said before the Seven Seals that hid all the Mysteries me not knowing what I was drawing on the board for the church church ages said God knows just by Vision I draw it not knowing that God a year and six months later was going to vindicate it in the skies by the moon and slip it across the national papers I didn't know that I didn't know there would be a mysterious blackout in the moon to represent this layout of seeing Church age now on the papers you only get the six ages it's because the layout of senior Church age was black completely out but if you would notice the spiritual application as God said it in the heavens when I said it here on Earth he said I said God allowed him they didn't make him God it didn't make him God but he said I set it up here on Earth God set it in the heavens I left a little bitty space as you see just a tiny little bit of light that was just before the very elected was to be called from the Earth we're in that little sliver of light right now right before the elect is to be called from the Earth that was his purpose of drawing and we are in there now if we weren't you there's no way that you would be here you wouldn't if there was no light we wouldn't be here I'm so glad God allowed that but when God put it in the heavens it was totally blacked out means maybe that the last one is called from that layout of seeing church that lays layout of singing age he says there could be a sermon on it he preached a few didn't he yeah yeah so we we look in that's the age we're in total darkness other than one little light so looking at Goshen God has allowed all these trials these tribulations these plagues to avoid Goshen dumping it and dumping it on Egypt everywhere but Goshen but tribulations come and negotia there's a plague coming to Goshen we've seen it in this age we've seen it in this age brother Brian said knoweth it not he said there will be hideous sights upon the Earth locusts with hair like women long hair to taunt them women that cut their hair teeth like Lion Stingers in their tail like scorpions they would torment men for months just wait till we get into opening them plagues and seals in them seven Thunders watch what takes place oh brother you better get to Goshen while there's time to get to Goshen don't pay any attention to outside you know we say don't pay attention to outside you know don't don't we can't help but see the things that's around us we hear the news we re if you read the paper the media you see it all and I don't think brother Brandon was just talking about that and I might be wrong this is just my opinion this is not a Doctrine I'm not saying don't pay attention to the things that Satan puts in your life as an individual that's the stuff that's outside the Holy Ghost don't pay attention to that the Holy Ghost has you sealed Satan's job we've said it a million times Satan's job is to put that on you his job is to go before God day and night and and accuse you right that's his job so he's going to do that brother Brown says don't pay attention to this on the outside focus on that Holy Ghost focus on Goshen I I apologize for reading too so many quotes here I didn't know I really didn't know I had this many it's what you get for Russia now to reject the truth when it's presented that's the Seal of the Christ when your ears are sealed you'll turn away from God very religious the scripture says heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers High false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are good having a form of godliness all forms very fundamental the forms of godliness and brother Branham said at one point spiritual uh when you get a religious spirit on you that's the worst spirit that you can get worse than any other kind of worse than a spirit of lust worse than any other kind of spirit you can get a spirit a religious spirit it makes you think you know this word frontwards and backwards you know who's wrong you know who's right you're always focusing on who's living their life wrong what their kids are doing their kids shouldn't be doing this I can show you in the word where brother Brandon said you shouldn't do this then you shouldn't do that you're focusing outside focus on the inside that's that's where your Redemption lies that's where you'll take a Rapture from that's the only thing you're taking with you so you why we don't need to pay attention to all this other other stuff here foreign all the forms very fundamental the forms of godliness but deny the power thereof from such turn away don't look at it ignore it for this is the sort that go from house to house lead silly women Laden with divers lusts never able to come to the knowledge of the truth that's right brother Bram said that's where my faith is anchored what the Bible said it's in God's word not in tradition of men but in God's word that's where I put my stand 23 years ago so Joseph I want to jump ahead I'm I'm going to be too late here and y'all got to go to bed so we know death is coming death is coming to Goshen so this is a new something new for the children of Israel and God tells Moses you need to tell them after all these plagues the same death that's coming to Egypt is coming to Goshen what did you tell them do you need to apply the token he tells them what to do to apply the token we'll look at in a second but Goshen was not exempt from all the plagues death was coming death came to many in this message they died spiritually because they didn't do what God told him to do what did God tell him to do to apply the token they didn't apply the token they had an intellectual understanding of the word and then when it they seemed that they were thinking they were things in Egypt that they were missing out on they went back and they died spiritually dead and it was freely given you didn't have to work for the token you didn't have to work it up it's freely given God said it's yours brother said in the Israel slain lamb was the requirement of Jehovah the blood was a token that the job had been done that God required for Redemption from Egypt to get go to the promised land he required a slain animal and that animal must have the blood of the dead animal must be put upon the little on the door that stood for the token the thing that Jehovah had required had been fulfilled the lamb not the lamb was the token the lamb wasn't the token if that lamb had stayed alive and listen if the land was a token all you had to do was put it in your house and hold it in there that's all you had to do if the lamb was the token well it wasn't the lamb it was the life the blood the Life Source that God required that stood for the token the thing that Jehovah had required had been fulfilled the not the land was the token the blood was the token the life had gone out from the sacrifice and now the blood was the token his orders had been carried out the blood stood for the token the sign the disbeliever had done exactly what the requirement was that was the token all right seeing the believer worship was then identified with the sacrifice you realize this couldn't just be any animal God didn't tell them tell Moses to tell them I need some animal blood tell them to go find an animal to kill that animal and put the blood on the doorpost God had Specific Instructions it has to be a lamb it has to be a lamb God required a lamb and we know what the type is with that you know looking at that you know they had they had been doing sacrifices of their whole their life that was their life was sacrifice every day every year whatever they would have to do sacrifices this was something new this was something different this was doing a sacrifice before a burnt offering and now they're actually taking the blood and applying it to their house they were taking the blood and applying it to their house you know look you look at it I wonder if a father at some time you know he takes the slam and this lamb has become the family pet this is his son's favorite lamb there's not a blemish on it this lamb has a name they've given it a name he sleeps with them everywhere the Sun goes He follows him and he has the father has to tell them I have to kill this lamb you're gonna have to explain he's gonna have to explain to him why because if I don't kill this lamb you will die you will die that's why Christ had to die for you if Christ if God didn't take his first born lamb that was without blemish do you think Christ could have just stayed alive and said Okay I I forgive the whole world from today forever I forgive him no life was given God required blood he required blood that's what we was talking about the other day when when Satan takes that book of your sins before God because we're told he's an accuser of the Brethren day and night he comes up to God he's saying look what they did look what he did right here he's telling God you did this you fell short here you got something on the Internet that you weren't supposed to be looking at look what he done it he said something to somebody he shouldn't have said he offended another brother he offended another sister they're talking about the pastor they're doing this they're doing that you know when I was studying that I got to thinking you know how frustrating it is sometimes when you see something somebody else don't yeah you're saying look my father-in-law Jack he can see a deer 14 000 miles away he can he's got the best eyes I've ever seen he'll say if there's one up there and you're looking you can't see nothing and you're trying to tell people hey look at that look at that deer up here on that Hill are you look I can't see it and you get frustrated because they can't see it how frustrated does Satan get when God can't see what he's showing him look it's just playing God you see it they done it God says they never done it I don't see nothing I love it when Satan gets frustrated I love it God loves it when Satan's frustrated God just laughs at him you showed me the same thing yesterday you showed it to me last year it was going to come a time when he ain't gonna be able to show him anything because you won't be long Satan won't be able to see it but his job is for you to get focused on it how can you see something that God can't see he seen from one eternity to the next there's nothing he hasn't seen there is nothing God hasn't seen but he can't see your faults so why do we keep bringing them up why are you helping Satan with his job you're basically telling him hey satan go show this to God this is what I did that's what you're doing you're helping him when you bring it up you talk about it you're telling him go look what I did shame on us you're reading Satan's book about yourself you're reading it about yourself and when God flips through it it's all Blake why because a lamb died and when that lamb died he spilled his blood on every page how in the world are you reading it how can you read it how many times does God have to tell us every day I don't see anything you did why do you bring this up before me because I don't know nothing about it he sees the blood and here's this Death Angel getting ready to come to every single House of every single believer he's coming to your house the Death Angel is coming to your house and I don't mean natural death foreign you better have the Lamb's blood on your house amen you better have the blood you'll die spiritually you could come every single day to church if we had Church seven days a week 24 7. you can have that message in your little earpod with your iPod and you can listen to it all day and finally won't be long you can quote it without listening to it so you start reciting it to yourself without the blood you are going to die with a lot of head knowledge you are going to die you are starving yourself to death of an it with an empty silo you're starving yourself if you do not have the blood of the Lamb applied on your house you're starving it's that plain and simple how do you know you say oh brother Joe I don't know the blood supply what's your desires what's the greatest desire of your life ask yourself that what do I desire more than anything I know what mine is to please God more than anything but as soon as I wake up I want to please God when I go through my day I want to please God I don't know what else to tell you other than that I want to please God if you're pleasing God you're doing everything right if you're not pleasing God you might not have the token you might not have the token because with the token all God can see is everything's pleasing to him in your life because he has to look through the blood every time I I think every time I think of the blood but the Larry I think about when brother Brandon was at that Diner God took him behind the door he says that's the sins of the world that must have been a lot of stuff that was hitting Jesus in the face to brother Branham think that's the sins of the world what do you say that's just yours that's just yours if that was the prophet how much is mine hitting him in the face how much is yours hitting him in the face what's hitting him in the face what is hitting him in the face every day you get out of bed you were born in sin shaped in iniquity came to the world speaking lies this human flesh makes mistakes every single day there's nothing you can do about it but pray God forgive me God forgive me it's like I told Brother Jimmy Whitson long time ago I said brother Jimmy this human flesh one millisecond one little millisecond before you go in a Rapture you might make a mistake really disagree that's quiet you're not taking this flesh with you one millisecond before the Rapture takes place that's one millisecond you're still a human that's one millisecond you still need the blood that's one millisecond you better have the token because if you lose the token one millisecond before the Rapture you ain't going keep it checked up Lord keep that token checked up in my life only way anyone could tell that a house belonged to under the blood because the chemistry was on the doors who does that house belong to Child of God how the chemistry of the blood simple as that that's how we know what a house the house that God dwells in how did we know that God dwells in your house the chemistry of the blood in your life the token God will not dwell in a house without the token he won't he won't do it they pass through the death angel had to look and see the blood now again it was the type of the Holy Spirit the literal blood of Jesus could not come upon each one of us because he had only so much blood in his body and it dripped off out his body and to the ground two thousand years ago but it wasn't to be for a token Jesus literal blood was not the token what was it the token the life the life them little licks of fire that came up on them 120 in the upper room the life he's still sending that life down tonight he's still sending it it's the same life that fell upon them that 120th Upper Room he's still sinning it's the same one that you receive the Holy Ghost driving down the road by yourself one night you didn't know where it came from you've been praying for it for years you might have been sitting at home by yourself you might have been sitting in church you might have been at work but something came over you like nothing you ever felt before it was God depositing that life down inside of you you've been baptized you've been sitting under the word your whole life but something changed you there's something you probably can't tell me when you've got the Holy Ghost I can remember the day I did in Happy Valley Church that's why that place will always have a place in my heart I think I'm sitting behind by Louie and Daniel ball did something come over me I still ain't acting like that again shame on me but I can tell you when I can't tell you the message that was preached can't take the songs that was sung but I can tell you that feeling and when I get to think about it sometimes I feel it all over again brother Harry I can still feel it it's a life it was because the token was applied a lamb had to die something had to die that you could have life it dripped off out of his body into the ground two thousand years ago it wasn't to be the token the life was in the blood that's the token I'll prove it to you in a minute it is a token that's come upon each of us to show we've been identified our sacrifice have carried out Jehovah's requests there's some that claim this last stage that they had the token the thing that they claim to have the token they threw it right back in God's face they threw it back they denounced the message of his age some of them stayed in pulpits preaching garbage with no life it's a dead message if you ain't got the token it's a dead message they don't live it that way they they feel like it's okay to live however you want to that God don't don't don't look at what you what you wear what you look like I had a great friend of mine many years ago just to show what kind of understanding that some people have he said let me ask you a question I said what's that he said how could God know how long my hair is if he's way up there and I'm way down here I felt sad I felt sad that is sad the people that was raised in this message and he was his dad was a pastor still is wonderful Godly Man and that's what he said how can God see how long my hair is if he's way up there how can he see this part down if that's our general conception of what God is then to us he's nothing God is a person turning look beside you you'll see God can you look at your own life right now don't raise your hands or nothing but can you look at your own life and say how I am every day when I get up when I go to work when I go do whatever I got to do through the day am I assured that this is the token I am the brother but I'm saying we are the token on display are you the token on display can people look at you and say that's the token I want to be like them I want my life to be like their life like I say you know thoughts and failures that token on the door when they put the little over the blood on the lid on the doorpost it did not give them eternal life it saved them from the death angel what happened to them saying people 40 in 40 years they died some of them God killed them why he put another image before him the same God that saved him from the death angel you can have the Holy Ghost on your flesh you can have it on your flesh but it won't always stay there if it ain't sealed right here it's got to be sealed if if they if they you know I've been reading one thing I love about God and the children of Israel I've been reading Jeremiah I've been reading the Bible through again and I just got through Jeremiah and Ezekiel you read when you read them on the in the prophets you're prophesying to Israel those books are God using Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Nehemiah and these different ones prophesying to Israel telling Israel he's going to destroy him you become an Abomination you become a stench in my nostrils I'm going to destroy you before your enemies and God's telling them this and you read three verses down and he says but you are my people and I will have you unto myself and I will have with you a covenant God didn't want to destroy me he loved him but God had to put things on him so many times look at the kings in the lineage of David through the lineage that brought Christ the kings that did Evil inside the Lord and God would send the prophet to him and they would straighten up for little ways why because God loved them God loved him that's why he lets you have the Holy Spirit permanently in here you don't have to sacrifice every day you don't have to go kill a lamb or a calf every day because he loved you so much he said I'm going to make this permanent the token was temporary in Goshen it was temporary they weren't taking it with them they weren't ripping them door posts off and that little they had the blood on it and carrying it with them out of Egypt they weren't doing it but God said you can you can it's a free gift you know it's it's if you're a child of God listen you don't have to work up the Holy Ghost God there's the young young man we did question answers several years ago I think we said brother Rob's house and brother brother Donny had some of his different ministers me and brother John by the way that's not thanked brother Terry and brother Lance do some some question and answers to split it up and I had the Holy Ghost I think brother Lance had the godhead or something and this one of the questions was you know basically how do I get the Holy Ghost there was a young man there and that was his question how do I get the Holy Ghost and I asked him I ain't gonna say who he was he probably knows who he is right now he's a big boy I said you like cookies he said yeah didn't you Zach I said you like cookies I said yeah what do you do if you want a cookie what do you do brother Zach if you want a cookie you go get it where do you put the cookies at they're in a pantry you go open the door and pantry and get a cookie the Holy Ghost is that simple God said it's there freely when you got gifts under your tree at Christmas if you have a tree we'll leave that right there you get you're at a birthday party and the whole table is covered with your gifts they're yours all you have to do is open them it's that simple guess what they have your name on it God put your name and the token together before the foundation of the world he puts your name on it he said here it is go get it and we walk around it for years we walk around it I'll never get that I'll never have it why did we say that why did we do that because we focus on this book that Satan's got everything written we focus on that and Satan keeps saying you can't have it you can't have it the token wasn't for you it wasn't for you and you're reading that and God says if you could just look at it through my eyes you will see nothing nothing but your name and the token have been married together that's all it is and we complicate it we complicated and it's not I urge you tonight if you don't have the Holy Ghost just reach over and get it just get it there's got to be a desire when I was you I was 19 20 years old I was with my uncle was in Illinois was pastoring in Illinois what time we drove I rode to Kentucky and back with him and I was struggling I said I'm Gloria and this was the simplest I'd ever heard it I said I don't want to know if I have the Holy Ghost he said what's your desires and at that time I had more desires than being right here I was all about myself I was but I read to you other well earlier brother Brian said when you have interest that are more of the Natural Body instead of the spiritual body and I had those but I had to get rid of them first they stood between me and my birthday gift they stood between me and my Christmas gift I had to find a way around them I had to realize all I got to do is open it they're sitting right there and I'm letting a lie of the devil keep me from walking over there and getting it when you think that you can't have the Holy Ghost because of the bad things in your life you are listening to a lie of the devil it's a lie you're making this job easy I'm going to go to it let's stand I didn't sorry about the time [Applause] if it was good enough just to be in Goshen they'd never had to leave if it was good enough God said there's darkness in Egypt there's light here it's good enough we don't have to leave so where you are in your life right now and you think you're good enough and God says I'm calling you out I want to take you places I'm taking you to a promised land and it might take 40 years there's people in this message right now I've been in this message 40 years still don't have the Holy Ghost don't have the Holy Ghost but God promised them a Promised Land if they are seed they will cross Jordan they'll Cross Jordan they'll cross a dry Jordan right let's put the Ark in they put the word right down there in the water and stop the water and they crossed don't get caught up and being in Goshen don't be caught up and I'll go to Word of Life Church brother Donny's my pastor you can caught up in that all you want you know I was I was thinking sitting back there after I preached speaking of brother Donnie after I preached Sunday I I just felt like you know what if I had a defended anybody I'd apologize I don't apologize for what I said but if I offended anybody I I sincerely apologize because I never would never do that but I'll Never Compromise this message the the ministry the head Ministry that we're on over this church has taught me one thing one thing there is zero tolerance for compromise that's what this our pastor has stood for he will not compromise no matter what and if I'm if I'm to be a help under that Ministry I can't compromise I would never intend to hurt any feelings I told Brother Terry one time was your military if God told me this is from my heart if God told me that's your last sermon I don't need to use you anymore I'd be the happiest man in the world people that want to get up and do this I have no idea why no idea get sick at your stomach sitting back there you weaken the knees you want to leave I've come a time or two I think brother Dowell runs me back in the in the back door one day I wasn't really leaving but I stepped outside and he said hey get back in there but why would we compromise on something that God has given us when he's put the token into our life I said this is the way that you'll make the Promised Land I haven't even gotten everything I was going to get but I think I got enough you know I was thinking I've studied this and I wrote a little note here I wonder what people Passing Strangers that passage from Goshen because we know our favor on him was in the the city called Ramses Egypt's the country but they would go I wonder what people thought when they passed through Goshen especially in the in the hard times when they were under bondage when their beer were being beat and travelers coming by and they would pass through this town these people they see people that are scarred that were beaten that were weary pushed down but some reason they would they would hear him singing a song about a deliverer it seemed happy what's wrong with these people you sisters that don't cut your hair you wear you wear your long skirts you don't wear makeup and you do all this stuff and people look at you think you're under bondage they don't realize you're the happiest person on the face of the Earth you got a song in your heart you want to worship because God made you who he makes you that's what the token does the token makes you happy in the middle of a tribulation they could sing we're almost home running my last small home we're almost there they knew the liver was coming they knew he was coming and they didn't know they were going to be in the

service where Jesus was sharing the parable about the I think it was a Pharisee in a public and and won the Pharisee had talked about how thankful he was that he didn't live like these terrible people and he was so thankful that he fasted and he did all these things and then the Publican had said I can't remember exactly how it was worded but the meaning was he couldn't even lift his head up towards heaven so ashamed of itself I said God forgive me a sinner you know that's the way we want to come to the Lord but that's no good a year down the road two years down the road it's time and I think brother Joe what he was talking about tonight it's time to quit going to that book it's time to say thank you for your goodness Lord I serve a good God don't you I thank him for his grace I
