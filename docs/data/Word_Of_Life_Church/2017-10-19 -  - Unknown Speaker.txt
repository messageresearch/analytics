glory and the honor in the praise for it before you ask these things in Jesus name Amen hallelujah you know sometimes I don't know why we wear these we take them off amen but just wanted to show you that I had a coat that match match my pants so you know they read a book all things are possible you know talked about you know brother Branham he spearheaded the deliverance ministry and all that and you know sometimes he show up they them great preachers you know all Robertson them some of them they they show up in their Cadillacs and all that and brother and me just show up in his old pickup truck and all that you know but hey he had something that they didn't have amen amen so if you have your Bibles this morning turn with me to the book of Job the 35th chapter I've seen a job I mean job 35 and then we'll be coming from another portion scripture he loved him this morning you appreciate him job 35 and verse 10 but none sayeth where is my God my maker who giveth songs in the night and then in and I you know some people call it Ibaka but have a cook and if you have a Scofield Bible it's page 958 so but I think they'll put that on the screen but chapter 3 and verse 17 we want to look says although although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit being the vines that labor of the olives shall fail and the fields shall yield yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls yet I will rejoice in the Lord I will joy in the God of my salvation the Lord God is my strength and he will make my feet like Hinds feet and he will make me to walk a poem might hide behind high places a man may the Lord bless the reading of the word you may be seated this morning a man I'd like to take for a thought maybe this morning a song in the night a song in the night and I was thinking about this and for we get started like to read you something may go along with what I want to preach out here brother I'm talked about this it's pretty lengthy but I'll try to you know try not to hurry but just take my time he says it's why I'm a Holy Roller listen what he said and I thought this was real amazing y'all pray y'all have heard this before if you listen taste it I was going not long ago up here in Canada brother Ross misen and I we were going into Canada brother Baxter where he's going way up in the North Woods one night he said one night I was riding alone there with my horse there's a big old thicket of puns I just love the outdoors I love to see God that was my first Bible God in his nature and I looked and I passed by an Old Forest where it used to be a great towering Pines but a burnover had come years ago and burn it all down and it was just a big bunch it looks spooky great big old white trees the moon shining down against them and them just parched white and there came a wind blowing through the mountains and all them trees were doing and making the most mournful scent of and I thought oh my a spooky place then that scripture come on my mind what the Palmer Warren left the caterpillar eaten what the caterpillar left the locust eaten but that was his church I thought truly Lord after the Reformation back under with a with a Catholics left the fundamentals eaten when what the fundamentals left the Presbyterians eaten what the peppered Presbyterians left the baptist eaten what the Baptist's left the Nazarenes eaten until the they eat the thing down but I'll restore saith the Lord hallelujah God's going to have a church I will restore saith the Lord I stood there and wondered and hear God's sending that wind down all them big old trees we're doing I thought that's just exactly like that rushing mighty wind that came from heaven on the day of Pentecost when it strikes them to go cold churches today like around Chicago the only thing they can hear is moan and cry and say the days of miracles has passed fundamental they are trees yes sir they were once a tree the method it's the Baptist to presbyterian the Moody's all the rest they got great big turn spot spires but they that they say the days of miracles has passed because the pummel worm has eaten all the blessings out of the church so there's no more hallelujah is there no more praises to God hallelujah there's no more divine healing speaking with tongues they carried it away tongues dead I stood and looked there came a twin again instead of it bend into it they go whoo I thought that's about like it when God sends a revival in the city they say don't you believe such stuff days of miracles has passed or no such a thing as Holy Ghost dr. so-and-so my well went out then I well then I was discouraged I said Lord you said I will restore and about that time the wind dropped a little lower and when it did I noticed there was some undergrowth coming up hallelujah glory some more little trees they invented they were interdenominational like Israel was God said you'll never be a nation no more and she won't be there was interdenominational and when the winds begin to blow and these little trees begin the wind begin to hit them little trees begin to fall I can jump and dance and carry on about hallelujah I will restore say the same power the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost if their moan mournful churches won't the morn and say well I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist more tone there's an undergrowth coming up hallelujah the life that left the tree but it's coming up again a man he said that's coming up again every time the wind blows them little trees just dig down and get a better hold that's right I will restore safe the Lord God is raising up the first rains done pass the blisters stop the power went out of the church but God in the last days is sin in the latter rain now that's right the part of the Holy Ghost coming back and sure he sins the wind and rains there's a tree standing there to rejoice how happy that was then little trees just have bending with the wind so that when said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the little tree said hallelujah hallelujah I believe it hallelujah hallelujah I believe it the other tree said in a sense it was fundamentally that was just as much tree as what this little fella was but brother they couldn't be into the spirit and tonight that's what our today that's what the trouble these great big churches can't bend to the spirit because they're so organized it would break up their organization that's right a strong wind is always coming up called backwash and holy rollers hallelujah just as flexible as it can be that's right God life in him that new tree was alive the old tree was dead that's the reason they can't be in because it's dead dead but there's a new birth coming on the ladder rains been poured out in these last days power signs and wonders and the same joy them old trees Jordan long time ago let's come back in a new generation amen I will restore saith the Lord there it is a man a man sub leave God gives us a song amen then little trees can being but with a spirit a man I hope this morning we can be in with the spirit a man hallelujah God he gives us a song amen hallelujah now you know hearing this a little like a song tonight you know we all have nights of sorrow how many can say amen to that we all have lots of persecution Amen every one of us gonna go through persecution brother brems sitting in the church age book trials and persecutions and troubles that's just part of a Christian life what mean you need to do is commit him to God and that the outcome be what the Lord gets your will whatever it would be Lord so we gonna have nights of sorrow a man we're gonna have nights of despair hey man we're gonna have nights of persecution amen but it's God that gives us all a man in the midst of persecution in the midst of a trial in the midst of a battle you can still say god I Love You God I appreciate you and I'm gonna stand for you hey man we're gonna have them nights we're gonna not send out a man not said that way then this message is true or not come on church and man we're gonna have them kind of doubts ain't man but God the Holy Spirit he's the dissolver of all doubts amen if you have a doubt tonight or just morning rather he can dissolve that doubt if you'll just let them let him have his way he can dissolve that doubt hey man we're gonna have nights of bewilderment amen we're gonna have nights of affliction David said in the spiritual meaning of the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivered them out of them all we all have nights of affliction we all have nights of anxiety amen nights of ignorance nights of all kinds of principle are spirits of amen and a tip that terrify ourselves we have their nights but God gives a song Amen God gives a song so you think about Moses they begin to take at that tambourine and run across the that dry ground and begin to beat that ten marine and Moses sang in the spirit amen he begin to say the horse and the rider were thrown into the sea but what about before then what about before then amen before the end what had happened there they were God and gave them a great victory we went out to eat went out of Egypt letting in there and they got to the Red Sea and brother branham said it like this you would think that God him being a the great general that is he'll be the great master of ward everything that he would not need his children right there to the midst of the Red Sea but he wanted to prove he was a man God likes to us and he how does he prove who he is by me and you the believer man how does he prove that he's a healer by being you being sick hey man how does he prove that he's a deliverer by me and you need to deliver hey man brother it was in the night that he proved his love to me sometimes we might not understand the night we might not know why we going through these things but it's God that gives a song hey man and before they could sing hey man they was backed up against the Red Sea amen and then all of a sudden there was favorites on me coming right behind them they couldn't sing then they begin to cry they begin to say god help us maybe goodness a God why'd they be getting the arguing complaining murmuring they said Moses wouldn't be done wasn't there no graves in Egypt that she let us out in this wilderness to die hey man Oh before the song to be sung amen you know sometimes we look at all of our troubles hey man we look at all of our troubles we said my I'm going through a lot I'm going through this and I can't pay my bills amen but we sing that song he's the good did not show up on time did not pay your bills for you amen just to prove what just to prove my love for you man like I said we sang songs we sang songs of victory we sang songs of peace we send songs of deliverance but will we go through it words that had a man I've seen people get up and they and then they sang songs and they said I'm shelter let the dark clouds row let the storm clouds I'm sheltered safe within the arms of God and then they go through a trial they go through a battle and they give up on God where's your shelter at then a man that they sung that song where's your shelter at they're my shelter is still in the arms of God and you can only say that if it's real to you it's gotta be made known to you it's gotta become real to you hey man it's gonna use it might be real - brother Terry but what about me it might be real - brother hey but what about me you man what about me what about you amen so we look at all of our troubles and we looked at all of our trials that we go through and we look at all our failures and we look at all this around us and what we fail to do is look up to the hills from which cometh our help and our help coming from God hey hey man I know my help comes from him this morning hey man the one who gives Mercy's the one who gives grace the one who gives peace hey man the one who gives joy amen the one who incur David had to encouraged himself in the Lord amen when he was going through a great battle there he was physically I had been burned a man and all this family there and nothing his soldiers his men that were behind him their wives and their children their sons and their daughters had been taken captive a man and so David a man that the Bible says that they picked up rocks to stone David a man they picked up rocks to the stone David but the Bible says that David begin to encouraged himself in the Lord why because he remembered said my god delivered me one time and if God delivered me one time he could do it again and he encouraged himself in the Lord amen if God held me one time he could help me again and that's why we are encourage ourselves in him then this morning very mad if he live with me one time he can deliver me again if we brought me out of one trial surely it can bring me out of this one and he encouraged himself in the Lord Amen I think every now and then would it be good for me and you to do is take our Diaries down and begin to look and see what God has done a man and begin to count our blessings one by one Amen we won't happen so many troubles that we think we have a man and say guard him you did at one time you can do it again a man if he delivered me one time you can do it again and I encouraged myself in him this morning I encouraged myself in him hey man hallelujah thank you lord so in here off I was thinking about brother Branham you know I always think about him because he's our messenger it's a prophet to this age hey man I begin to thinking and I begin to listen to my story again and think of all the things that he went through and I begin to think about you know how he started out he said you know how he talked about that log cabin that he was borned in he thought he said my about that log cabin would stand for years and years and years he said but where we sold cheap wood mud and all that he said well where it once stood at his apartment complex or something like that because he took his stall for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come hey man he thought about that he thought about that cho poplar tree that stood up there he's off my that tree he said he'd just stand for years and years we go poplar tree way up there the branches and everything but he said I looked the other day and saw that tree said it's just a snag he said for here we don't have no continuing City but we're seeking one to come bet he thought about his dad now that it's dad he can said I could see my dad him weighing about 150 pounds really you know and all that and then tell you that cuz he said a god told him said Billy if he was like your dad he said but I said y'all seen the time your dad will take a 900-pound log amen and lo loaded on a wagon by itself and he said my dad come home and take off his shirt nur has muscles just watered up in his arms and said all my dad would live to be and he died I think I forget about 52 something like that under my for here we have no continuing City hey man and I thought about everything that he had went through hey man and all those things that he went through when he was you know how that he got ahold and how that he was all fishing he can't do anything Jesus man Jesus only seen them Lots and legs he stopped there and you know you know how the story goes and how did he came home and go it is this it is what the hope said Billy what you so glad said how I meant to cream of the crop and to look at here a whole slew of invitations hey man and he said well yeah he said he said any word she was said anywhere the Lord called you to go I'm going with you so let's tell our families and stuff you know and then he said with her mom he knows his mother-in-law Carlin said called you know Williams and you need to know that it stretches the other churches thrown out so what you need to do is get back up there to your church so they can afford to build your parsonage walked out said we won't go hope was crying said been in it he's enough that he your mother's anxious to trash the world that that's all right he said the fatal mistake that I made a man how I love you and I was thinking about that I've got my and how he went through you remember I can get that boat to start you couldn't get in to start anything going over the falls he said my god he said I didn't call them people trash she did hey man she did he said the way but transgress is hard hey man he beginning to push his Lord any any hidden started he said you know he was written about three four days he had time to think whether they was trashed or not then he got a call that his wife died went in there and said hope hope she said be a why'd you called me back so what you mean sir when you talked about it you preach about it but you don't even understand yourself hey man come on man he got a call about his baby dying I thought my hey man he's a mind he went in there and the doctor really didn't want to go in there said hey you got to thank a billy Paul's and you packed a man like that what she's got the Billie policy gun think about it wenting down there in our eyes cross bet nano variety begin to cry me begin saying Sharon Rose darling honey daddy wanted to erase your ride you remember that he won't even raise your ride daddy wounded a man and she'd

battlefield today he said that's been nearly 37 years ago and I'm still on the battle why and they came from said I said Billy did you religious yeah did you hold your religion he said nobody held me a man in the time of a storm in the time of a knife that's when it holds hey man that's what it holds in the darkest of your hour of your life in the most great temptation of your life that's what it holds hallelujah that's when it holds a man the strength of the vessel can be did Shimon demonstrated only by the hurricane Amen because you really don't know how it's gonna hold up to has been tested amen I knew some fellas I work to tell somebody last night I clean been cleaning you know buffing floors and different places emptying trash for about 30 years and most of my time that I've been at have been in some sense of Western world work in connection with what maybe the military or something like that because I when I lived in Texas I worked at a place I had to have a security clearance because I worked at a place that made there's a final assembly point for nuclear weapons had to have a clearance and I mean to tell you they they really rake you over the coals I think I might have said to here one time they came by one time one and talked to my wife about you know about me and all them planes and all that stuff and they aimed and asked me to step outside while they talked to my wife amen you know usually they talk to me about some people too they went that last thing they wanted to know is how you didn't think he would sell his country out you think he would sell his country I but anyway I say this said this to say that I've seen them guards and some cute security officers they're sent behind the bulletproof glass window I said at one time just joking let me take your pistol and just shoot through there and see if it that it works so you wouldn't know how it works - it was tried you know what they said said no we don't want to try it so I don't know if they really had to but it's only it's demonstrated here you can stand up and we was tested and tried amen and the only way that the power or the gospel can be fully shown when you go through a trial or go through a battle and then we know that this gospel Willie works or not I say it works hey man hallelujah but part of the gospel can be fully shown only when the Christian is subjected to some fiery trial hey man family's been through free trial and you're still here you ought to give God praise and glory they're still pressing home bigger hose amen in that songs that I've had visions I've had dreams young people how many times have you had visions have you egg dreams but you've seen them crushed right before you and maybe you want to play the blame game but maybe it's God hey man want to show you a better way what about the anchor is it holding this morning it's it holy amen hallelujah I preached the message I think I preached it here I preached it back home not for sale hey man ain't brother

everything why not depend on him for this hey man he's the one that can give he's the one that can deliver he's the one that can set free I can't do it but he can truncate do it but he can hey man even in the midst of absolute word and object famine the Prophet was prepared to trust God what about me you amen complete failure crops everything in a in a obscure famine or whatever it was are you prepared to trust God the other day at work they came out there because it's a if they open it up for you that work you know most if you work a public job they open it up for you can obtain insurance

what me my wife was talking you know what it's getting to a place us as believers and I believe that's what God wants hey man he wants us to not to put our trust in some insurance company Blue Cross and Blue Shield or whatever you got a man but put our trust in him he's one that can heal you he's the one that can deliver yeah he's the one hey man that doctor he could only a cart a place open but it takes God to heal at a man and he can't give you a new body but one these days brothers and sisters we're gonna come forth with that brand new body amen hallelujah hey man so that's why I want to put my trust in him he realized the inner peace did not depend on outward prosperity hey man they tell me Elvis Presley when he before he died I remember seeing a documentary on him and this one guy told me one time my mama said she's seen something and said this this one guy said he was a penguin Elvis's bodyguards and he was a pallbearer at the funeral and he was crying he just weep and he said you see these clothes I got a Elvis bought it for me this ring I'm wearing he said Elvis got it for me everything he got Elvis bought so my his old life depended on Elvis he even said that even said that this woman one time was in a bank to conduct some business and just so happens that was Presley was in there and so Elvis walked out and she was a man his car I forget where the Cadillac or whatever it was and she was a miner he goes uh do you like that she said yes sir said told around told his people said write her a check for one just like it found out it was her birthday said rather give her some more money first so she can buy some clothes to go with this new car that she's gonna get all she depended on was Elvis but you know what all that prosperity that he had it did not bring him inner peace amen because they tell me he was miserable any man he was so uh he was a very secure he was miserable a man and I wonder if he ever listened to what the Prophet said he sold out his birthright for a fleet of Cadillacs I wonder what he thought then Amen but many brothers and sister God give us a song God give us a message to put us in a rapture for a change of a body we're to be

I wait all the day hey man too many people keep trying to buy joy but to buy joy but happiness is not found in circumstances hey man happiness is not found in circumstances hey man like I said before I might have said it here I preached the message one time to door the Lord and they said joy and happiness it's two different things happiness comes from the word happer happen in other word for you to be happy something has to happen you have to get the raise on the job and then you're happy you have to do this or they don't they have to sing your favorite song are you happy but joy comes from a different source that comes from the Lord God Almighty amen and if they don't say my favorite song if they don't give me the Rays of the law on the job my joy is still in the Lord and the joy of the Lord is my strength hey man hallelujah hey man so I don't matter happiness is not found in circumstances but joy is available to everyone even to those who are stripped of every material possession hey man for joy is found in the person Christ Jesus it comes to an intimate and personal relationship with the Lord so even in the worst circumstances we can smile hey man used to sing a song I forget what it was don't let Satan see that frown smile Amen because just over there hey man coz joy comes in the morning hallelujah the unfailing source and confidence necessary just satisfaction and contentment is a sovereign Lord Himself the strength he gives it's like the power found in the face in the feet of a deer a deer can bound through a dark force wit quickly so we can move joyfully through any difficult any situation that comes along we can move quickly and swiftly hey man his legs trembled at the awesome presence of God at the awesome presence of God he began to tremble and the presence of him all to get in his presence when we ain't in his presence when we think he's there but probably said we intended we cus we swear if we know he around we want to tell a white lie if we

the inside and I know that I know that I know that he's right there they didn't make me live different hey man and I'll tremble and it's awful awesome presence a man even Isaiah when he got his mind brother brems sitting on the influence of another when he got his eyes on your eye and thought why are you riding and your brother Brent said he was just built to kingdom up and you Robb thought he could get by with anything and when they told him about that he shouldn't go in there or interesting to incense the priestess job if I said if you right was any kind of a man or a Christian he said I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that I repent y'all do that that's y'all's job but he didn't want ahead anyway and he was smoked with leprosy and died right there and when Isaiah saw that hey man and then he saw the Lord and the Bible says he saw the vision came and he saw the Lord High and lifted up and his train filled the temple and he felt his awful presence hey man he said listen I'm a man of unclean lips whoa it's me toil among it unclean people but he said in the angel that Seraphim took that coal from off the altar and place it on his tongue and cleanse the prophet and they said I need someone to go now as I said Here I am send me Lord because he'd been in the presence none of their presence here I not in the presence and nobody else but in the presence of the Almighty God Leeman or legs tread tremble at all some presence of God that God was his joy that God that he trembled and his awesome presence was his joy was his strength and was his assurance Hellmann's never felt the presence of God and you feel like Isaiah what was me but that same God that we tremble brother tree in his presence that saying God is my strength that same God is my joy that same God that I tremble at is my assurance amen and God enabled that prophet to walk on heights not only could he bound through trials he would also climb the mountain top of victory and triumph hallelujah hey man that's what he does for me and for you that same God that we tremble at his presence that same God who is our joy who is our strength and who is our insurance he enables me and you to walk on heights Amen not only could we can we bound through trials and difficulty we can also climb the mountain top of victory and triumph hallelujah hallelujah Deuteronomy 32 10 says it like this he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye hey man that's our God samuel 22 33 and 34 says it like this God is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like Hinds feet and said it to me upon my high places let me just read these scriptures real quick Psalms 23 1 the Lord is my shepherd

to lay down in green pastures he'll lead us beside the still waters sometimes it's just like this I know we like to jump we like to shout we like to dance but still waters they say we run deep and sometimes it's just sitting under his presence and the quietness of his spirit when their arms lifted up to him and saying and just talk to him like he worked me and brother Terry would talk or you know whatever and tell him you love him and let him speak back to you and 1000 hallelujah Lord I love you Lord Lord I appreciate you lord I thank you Lord hallelujah hey man hey man he restored my
