[43:07] verse one we'll read a few verses here
[43:10] before we pray over
[43:12] the word
[43:15] how many believers are living in the
[43:16] last days
[43:19] you think perilous times are here
[43:22] i believe we can we can all agree to
[43:24] that this know also that in the last
[43:27] days
[43:28] perilous times shall come hard to deal
[43:31] with
[43:32] hard to understand hard to be able to
[43:35] even reckon in life for men shall be
[43:39] lovers of their own selves covetous
[43:41] boasters
[43:42] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[43:46] unthankful unholy without natural
[43:50] affection
[43:51] truce breakers false accusers
[43:54] incontinent
[43:55] fierce despisers of those that are good
[43:59] traitors heady high-minded
[44:03] lovers of pleasures more than
[44:07] lovers of god
[44:11] having a form of godliness but denying
[44:14] the power thereof from such
[44:18] turn away let's bow it together if you
[44:21] would
[44:23] lord jesus we thank you tonight father
[44:25] for the opportunity that we have that we
[44:27] could
[44:28] come together again lord to be able to
[44:30] worship
[44:31] and sing and praise and now of the
[44:34] breaking of your word
[44:36] lord god we bring before you tonight
[44:38] father
[44:39] all of our needs our desires you see
[44:42] lord as we
[44:43] were just talking about in the office
[44:45] before coming out
[44:47] lord there are so many needs among your
[44:49] people
[44:50] so many afflictions and sicknesses and
[44:53] troubles in the homes and
[44:55] lord just everywhere we look when we get
[44:58] down to pray
[44:59] there's so many it's like we can't even
[45:01] remember them all it's like our minds
[45:05] and our memory is just
[45:07] so flooded of trying to recollect
[45:10] everything and lord we are so
[45:14] mindful of our human weakness but lord
[45:17] we realize that no matter if we would
[45:20] bring
[45:21] a million if we could remember that many
[45:23] or write them down or print them out
[45:26] you'd be able to keep every one of them
[45:28] straight
[45:29] you'd be able to send every answer to
[45:31] the right address
[45:33] you'd never get it confused the way we
[45:35] do sometimes and
[45:37] we will call the wrong name was the
[45:39] wrong request
[45:40] but our god is so mighty and so
[45:43] wonderful
[45:44] that millions could come up before you
[45:46] in a moment of time
[45:48] and you keep them all straight so lord
[45:51] jesus
[45:52] we're looking to you tonight father we
[45:55] look around us and we see the darkness
[45:57] it is so
[45:58] penetrating the world that we live we
[46:01] see our nation
[46:02] in the condition that it's in we see the
[46:04] world we see
[46:06] science baffled by one disease
[46:09] after another but yet lord god this hour
[46:12] has not taken you
[46:14] by surprise at all so we're asking you
[46:17] tonight father for your strength
[46:19] for your grace for your healing for your
[46:22] encouragement lord
[46:24] father i hold in my hand tonight these
[46:26] prayer clothes you see lord
[46:28] brother jim bab having a scan in his
[46:31] body and father we're just believing you
[46:33] lord that
[46:34] you're going to let this thing come back
[46:36] good father you
[46:37] see so many of your children facing so
[46:41] many different
[46:42] things but god we just want to lay our
[46:44] needs
[46:45] our requests our desires before your
[46:48] throne tonight
[46:49] god and we're asking you in the name of
[46:51] jesus
[46:52] that your will would be done for every
[46:54] one of them
[46:55] now as we come to the breaking of your
[46:57] word i pray that you'd help me that i
[46:59] can get out of the way
[47:01] that i can just step aside for a few
[47:04] moments as it were
[47:05] to allow you lord to help me to be able
[47:08] to
[47:09] speak those things which are needful
[47:11] which will bring
[47:12] strength stability courage to our hearts
[47:16] in this hour speak to us tonight would
[47:18] you father
[47:19] in the name of the lord jesus we ask it
[47:22] and the saints said amen
[47:24] would y'all say that again amen thank
[47:27] you
[47:28] god bless you you may be seated
[47:31] so the way we believe it here you don't
[47:34] have to say
[47:35] a woman after you say amen
[47:39] because actually we're taught what a man
[47:43] believes
[47:44] what what it means amen means
[47:47] so be it so when we say amen it is not a
[47:52] gender thing for us
[47:54] it is not something that we say well if
[47:57] we say
[47:58] amen that we have to say a woman or
[48:01] a transgender or a so-and-so to be able
[48:04] to give
[48:05] everybody equal rights no we're taught
[48:08] better than that
[48:09] so whenever we say amen we know that it
[48:12] means
[48:13] so be it to our prayers aren't you glad
[48:16] tonight that in this
[48:17] crazy mixed up world that we have an
[48:21] absolute
[48:22] that we can tie our souls to now
[48:25] we know that it has been prophesied and
[48:28] spoken for
[48:29] so many years that the end time would
[48:32] come
[48:32] and that people would grope in insanity
[48:36] it was forecast by the prophets of the
[48:39] old testament and
[48:40] certainly was by the prophets of the new
[48:43] and they told us that it would come a
[48:45] time that
[48:46] people like what we've read tonight it
[48:49] would be
[48:49] such a tumult and the darkness would so
[48:53] penetrate the minds of people and the
[48:56] governments of the people of the earth
[48:58] and that people wouldn't know which way
[49:00] to go they wouldn't have an answer
[49:03] and even though people have looked at
[49:05] their great governments
[49:07] whether it was a theocracy or a
[49:09] democratic as we have
[49:11] yet and no doubt people have always had
[49:14] confidence in their government thinking
[49:16] well
[49:17] this will be able to stern the times
[49:20] whenever they come
[49:22] and when the waves become in such a
[49:24] tumult
[49:25] oh our great nation will be able to
[49:27] stand
[49:28] but how many of those that believe that
[49:31] are laying beneath the sea
[49:32] tonight or if we could go to the ancient
[49:36] ruins
[49:37] of rome now i've stood there in rome and
[49:40] i've looked at those
[49:41] ancient ruins i've men been to other
[49:44] parts of the world
[49:45] and which great great men were able to
[49:48] rule from
[49:49] and be able to see nothing left of that
[49:52] but just dig down so many feet and find
[49:56] some rocks laying there and maybe
[49:58] a piece of pottery and maybe a certain
[50:00] seal
[50:01] with a great man's name on it and as you
[50:04] stand there and look at that
[50:05] and you think here was a kingdom
[50:08] that they thought would endure for a
[50:11] thousand years
[50:12] and yet all the rulers are gone the
[50:15] people are gone
[50:16] and the only thing that is left to
[50:18] testify that they existed
[50:20] is a rock with this certain man's name
[50:23] on it
[50:24] we could go to babylon which of course
[50:26] you know
[50:27] is the land of iraq and we could go
[50:30] and find just barely a few remnants
[50:34] of what existed as one of the greatest
[50:37] empires of the ancient world we could be
[50:40] able to go
[50:41] to rome and go to greece and find things
[50:44] that
[50:44] alexander the great had conquered and
[50:47] then as his kingdom was divided
[50:49] and went into the different powers of
[50:51] the generals
[50:52] and see how they went to egypt and they
[50:54] went to greece
[50:56] and they went to babylon and see those
[50:58] kingdoms
[50:59] as they were conquered one by one by one
[51:03] and we could go to our founding fathers
[51:05] and see how
[51:06] they come here on the basis of searching
[51:09] for a land that they thought would be a
[51:12] free land
[51:13] that their people might be able to
[51:15] worship and might have the freedom of
[51:17] religion
[51:18] and the freedom of speech and our
[51:20] founding fathers writing
[51:22] the constitution and establishing our
[51:25] rights
[51:26] little did they know little did they
[51:29] know
[51:30] thomas jefferson john quincy adams all
[51:33] of those men would have never
[51:35] believed the things that you and i are
[51:38] facing
[51:38] in this very day to aware that as long
[51:42] as you
[51:42] say what is politically correct
[51:46] the government is behind you but if it's
[51:49] not
[51:50] then guess what you'll start losing some
[51:52] of your rights or to begin on twitter
[51:55] first
[51:55] then facebook will follow then youtube
[51:58] will follow
[51:59] then this one will follow but i got some
[52:02] great encouragement this morning
[52:04] as i was thinking about how that no
[52:07] doubt the left
[52:08] has gained control of the senate and the
[52:11] left has gained
[52:12] control of congress and the left has
[52:15] gained control
[52:17] of the white house and the left has
[52:19] gained control of silicon
[52:21] valley but then i had this encouraging
[52:24] saw
[52:24] but the left has not gained control of
[52:28] the throne
[52:30] and the left has not gained control of
[52:33] the kingdom of god
[52:34] in heaven and the left has not gained
[52:37] control
[52:38] of the kingdom of god which is in the
[52:41] earth
[52:41] and may i go on to say they never
[52:45] will because god hallelujah god
[52:49] is the one who is on the throne and no
[52:51] matter what congress does
[52:53] or senate does or the white house does
[52:56] they will only be allowed to do
[52:58] to the elect of god what god allows them
[53:01] to do
[53:02] and everything they are allowed to do
[53:05] will only bring us closer to the rapture
[53:08] and closer to our body change and i say
[53:11] come lord jesus
[53:13] was anybody echo that sentiment tonight
[53:18] now we know that god in in order to
[53:21] allow these things to happen the prophet
[53:23] makes a very profound statement when he
[53:26] talks to us about this evil age
[53:28] and he said the very reason that this
[53:31] age
[53:31] is even allowed to exist is to prove
[53:35] to satan that there is a people
[53:38] on the earth that are not like eve now
[53:41] think about
[53:42] that that statement it is absolutely
[53:45] overwhelming
[53:46] that the very reason that god allowed it
[53:49] to exist
[53:49] the darkness to become as great as it is
[53:53] even disease to come to such a place
[53:56] that our greatest scientists and doctors
[53:58] become stumped
[54:00] of course now they've got a name for
[54:02] whatever bothers you they blame it all
[54:04] uncovered
[54:05] now it may not be coveted related before
[54:08] they just call it an airborne something
[54:10] another that they wasn't sure
[54:11] but if you wound up with a jerk well
[54:13] it's covered related
[54:15] if you wound up with a big lip and a big
[54:17] fat ear it's covered related don't you
[54:19] believe all that stuff
[54:21] the thing of it is i don't know a bit
[54:22] more now than they did you know many
[54:24] months ago
[54:25] about it all when science ever going to
[54:27] be honest and say
[54:28] they don't have all the answers to all
[54:31] of life's problems
[54:33] but we don't know that our god knew that
[54:35] it would come to this place
[54:37] he also knew it would increase great
[54:40] pressure
[54:41] upon the elect because he knows that the
[54:44] elect
[54:44] even though they are electing their
[54:46] souls that their bodies
[54:48] are still human they can have wonderful
[54:50] churches they can be blessed by god
[54:53] with great ministries they can be even
[54:55] blessed financially
[54:56] live in nice homes drive nice cars but
[54:59] he also knows that the flesh
[55:01] of even the elect tends to get lazy
[55:05] it tends to get to a spot to where we
[55:07] just kind of you know go along and have
[55:09] church and we get into a rhythm
[55:11] but god knows how to turn the pressure
[55:14] up on us
[55:15] in order to make us pray like we've
[55:17] never prayed before
[55:19] he knows how to let things even come in
[55:21] our home
[55:22] or our family or our nation or our
[55:25] church
[55:25] that'll begin to shake people up and say
[55:28] oh my goodness
[55:29] what in the world is going on because
[55:31] there's something about
[55:32] this old rotten body that you and i live
[55:35] in
[55:36] it becomes lazy it becomes complacent
[55:39] did y'all come to have church tonight or
[55:41] what it becomes that way
[55:43] and god knows exactly how to bring us
[55:46] together does he not
[55:48] now we know that this was prophesied
[55:52] uh so many different ways by which it
[55:54] would come
[55:55] and our lord jesus even whenever he was
[55:58] here
[55:58] he forecast of the darkness that would
[56:00] be upon the earth in the last days and
[56:03] it prophesied
[56:04] about the end of the jewish dispensation
[56:06] as we looked at it last wednesday
[56:08] on the three questions that were asked
[56:10] in matthew 24
[56:11] and you know many theologians down
[56:13] through the years have run those
[56:14] three questions together but jesus was
[56:17] actually answering it
[56:19] in a dispensational way so the first
[56:22] question was asked they asked question
[56:23] one question two
[56:24] question three and jesus asked answered
[56:27] them
[56:28] but many of them have ascertained that
[56:30] he was putting it all together so they
[56:32] tried to put it
[56:33] with the coming of the lord and set a
[56:35] certain date what it's going to be in
[56:37] 1958 well then we come to the message
[56:39] and we put it
[56:40] in 1977 and many you know they try to
[56:43] put it back on years in different times
[56:45] but the lord knows exactly how to answer
[56:48] questions does he not he tells us just
[56:51] enough
[56:52] to let us know of a certain era at a
[56:55] certain time
[56:56] but he does not give us enough
[56:58] information
[56:59] that will encourage our laziness he does
[57:02] not give us
[57:03] enough where he can pinpoint the day or
[57:06] the hour
[57:07] but he will give us seasonal times or he
[57:10] will give us
[57:10] dispensational measures by which we can
[57:13] look at and say okay we must be getting
[57:15] close
[57:16] and you know the unbeliever will look
[57:17] and say oh i've heard people say that
[57:20] for 40 years
[57:21] i've heard people say that since i was a
[57:23] little boy
[57:24] why because god will let many of those
[57:26] things overlap
[57:28] and it would have part of it applied in
[57:30] the days of paul part of the days of
[57:32] loser
[57:32] part of it in the days of wesley but it
[57:34] would be more magnified
[57:36] in the last days but yet for those that
[57:39] are non-elected they would say oh i've
[57:41] heard this all in my life
[57:42] and they say where is the promise of his
[57:45] coming
[57:46] why my goodness when i was a little boy
[57:48] i went to happy valley and i heard
[57:49] brother donnie preaching that
[57:51] 30 years ago and all i see happen is
[57:54] he's got more gray hair
[57:55] and then other people's got more gray
[57:57] hair and they've got older and older
[57:59] and jesus ain't no closer to coming than
[58:01] he was in
[58:02] i beg to differ with you he's much
[58:04] closer now than he was 30 years ago
[58:06] when i first came here because the signs
[58:09] of the time
[58:10] though they linger they can go on and on
[58:14] and on is that right now let us go back
[58:18] if we can to this that we was looking at
[58:20] last week
[58:21] and matthew chapter 12 verse 43 you know
[58:23] when the lord jesus
[58:25] would speak he would speak many times of
[58:27] of a compound
[58:29] parable now this is what he's doing
[58:31] about this symbolism here about the
[58:33] unclean spirit
[58:34] and he says it this way when the unclean
[58:36] spirit has gone
[58:38] out of a man he walketh through dry
[58:40] places
[58:41] seeking rest and finding none i want you
[58:44] to notice how
[58:45] brother branham deals with this he said
[58:46] jesus said when the unclean spirit has
[58:49] gone out of a man
[58:50] did you notice he never said when he's
[58:53] cast
[58:53] out of a man but when he
[58:57] goes out by his own will
[59:00] when the unclean spirit has gone out of
[59:03] a man he
[59:04] returns back to this man and finds the
[59:07] house
[59:08] that he lived in has been swept and
[59:10] garnished then he goes and gets seven
[59:12] other devils demons
[59:14] unclean spirits enters into that man and
[59:17] the lies to say to this man is seven
[59:19] times worse than it was at the first did
[59:21] you notice
[59:22] the devil went out of his own will
[59:25] and he returned by his own will
[59:29] now this house had already been occupied
[59:32] when he returned he would have not been
[59:35] able to get in
[59:36] but you see he just found his swept and
[59:39] garnished so here is an individual
[59:41] that has come through a step or steps or
[59:45] process to where they're getting closer
[59:47] and closer to god something has happened
[59:50] to them they feel
[59:51] feel a purging they feel better they
[59:54] feel cleaner
[59:55] people look at their lives and they can
[59:56] definitely see changes
[59:58] in their lives and even satan himself
[1:00:01] had to take knowledge
[1:00:02] that something had happened to the light
[1:00:04] of this individual
[1:00:06] but it's sort of like if you're looking
[1:00:08] for an apartment to rent
[1:00:09] or a house to rent and then you would
[1:00:11] look down through there and they will
[1:00:13] put it categorically
[1:00:14] it will be either in the category of
[1:00:17] unfinished
[1:00:18] or furnished rather or furnished now so
[1:00:21] you look down through there and you have
[1:00:23] all of your furniture and you want to
[1:00:25] look under the category
[1:00:26] i want an apartment that is unfurnished
[1:00:29] i want it to be empty because i like my
[1:00:31] table
[1:00:32] my bed my end tables and this and that
[1:00:34] but if you don't want to move your
[1:00:36] furniture and you want to leave it in
[1:00:37] storage
[1:00:38] then you look in the category of a
[1:00:40] furnished apartment
[1:00:42] basically you move your clothes in and
[1:00:44] your groceries in
[1:00:45] and everything else is furnished but
[1:00:47] whether you look at
[1:00:48] a furnished one or an unfurnished one it
[1:00:51] is still
[1:00:52] empty of an occupant now whenever this
[1:00:55] devil
[1:00:56] goes out and the bible doesn't tell us
[1:00:58] exactly how long he's out
[1:00:59] but it must have been long enough for
[1:01:01] the sanctification process
[1:01:03] following the justification process to
[1:01:06] take place in the life
[1:01:07] of this individual but the lord jesus is
[1:01:10] not just speaking now
[1:01:11] about a man but he's speaking about a
[1:01:14] generation
[1:01:15] and he's speaking about a dispensation
[1:01:18] once again brother rahm says this and
[1:01:20] how can i overcome
[1:01:21] and we notice when the unclean spirit is
[1:01:24] gone from a man
[1:01:25] he walks in dry places that's exactly
[1:01:27] what the church
[1:01:28] has done baptist methodists those who
[1:01:31] believed
[1:01:32] in sanctification okay so we're not just
[1:01:36] looking now
[1:01:37] at a man or a woman a young man or a
[1:01:40] young woman
[1:01:40] but this can apply to an organization
[1:01:44] as well it can apply to a generation
[1:01:48] it can apply to a church age now watch
[1:01:51] how that you can
[1:01:52] take one man and represent a whole
[1:01:54] generation of people
[1:01:55] you see john the revelator on the isle
[1:01:58] of patmos when the angel of god told him
[1:02:00] to take the book
[1:02:01] and eat the book john was actually
[1:02:03] standing there as one man
[1:02:05] but representing the entire bride as she
[1:02:08] is to take the word and need him
[1:02:09] adam in the garden of eden stood there
[1:02:11] by himself but as he
[1:02:13] listened to the lie of the devil over
[1:02:15] the word of god though he was
[1:02:17] by himself as far as a man but yet he
[1:02:19] represented every man from that time to
[1:02:22] the very end
[1:02:23] watch this those who believed in
[1:02:25] sanctification then jesus said
[1:02:27] the unclean spirit went out returns back
[1:02:30] to this
[1:02:31] church body now this is what happens in
[1:02:33] the church ages this is what makes them
[1:02:36] form
[1:02:36] an organization when they come out and
[1:02:39] god burst them
[1:02:40] under the administration of the church
[1:02:41] age messenger then that unclean spirit
[1:02:44] by the word of that day
[1:02:45] is cast out away from those people and
[1:02:48] they're free
[1:02:49] and they come out of catholicism or
[1:02:51] whatever it was and they say
[1:02:53] oh my thank god god's moving among us
[1:02:55] god's alive and god's healing and god's
[1:02:58] doing this and that so that unclean spit
[1:03:00] of that denominational thing
[1:03:02] goes out of them but they don't go far
[1:03:04] enough to get
[1:03:05] the new light of the pending age but
[1:03:08] what they do is make
[1:03:09] another organization and then when they
[1:03:12] do they form their ideology their
[1:03:14] doctrines
[1:03:14] and when they do then that demon comes
[1:03:17] back and it says oh my
[1:03:18] here is an empty house but it's swept
[1:03:21] and it's garnished look at all this boy
[1:03:23] they've got church order
[1:03:24] they've got this and that and the other
[1:03:26] but you know what he wasn't afraid of
[1:03:28] all their order
[1:03:29] he was not afraid of all the things that
[1:03:31] had taken place in their life
[1:03:33] but what allowed him to come back in was
[1:03:36] there was no occupant
[1:03:38] in the furnished apartment so they've
[1:03:40] got the bed they've got the dresser it's
[1:03:42] all full of groceries
[1:03:44] it's all in order they've got everything
[1:03:46] that is perfectly ready
[1:03:48] for an occupant to move in but there's
[1:03:51] no one
[1:03:51] living in the apartment notice he said
[1:03:54] then jesus said the unclean spirit
[1:03:56] that went out returns back to this
[1:03:59] church
[1:03:59] body and finds the house garnish
[1:04:03] swept clean living pure clean
[1:04:07] lives pure clean like pure
[1:04:11] clean lies listen friends just because
[1:04:15] we think folks are good people
[1:04:18] good people does not mean they're
[1:04:22] accepted in the eyes of god
[1:04:24] the bible does not say the prayer of a
[1:04:27] good man
[1:04:28] is what moves god but the effectual
[1:04:31] fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:04:34] man not a good man you and i look at
[1:04:37] them oh that's a good man that's a good
[1:04:39] woman that's a good man
[1:04:40] you mean that's as far as you know you
[1:04:43] see you and i may be looking at people
[1:04:45] and saying oh they are so good and we
[1:04:47] don't have a clue what they do in the
[1:04:48] secret time of their life
[1:04:50] but it's not so much a good man or a
[1:04:53] good woman
[1:04:54] as we would call them that god hears
[1:04:56] their prayers
[1:04:57] but it is a righteous man or a
[1:05:00] righteous woman how can they be
[1:05:01] righteous because they are veiled in the
[1:05:04] very righteousness of christ
[1:05:06] the word another point that separates
[1:05:08] the bride
[1:05:09] from the church good people that you
[1:05:12] work with
[1:05:13] and that you know and they're good
[1:05:15] people but yet god does not categorize
[1:05:17] them by just being good
[1:05:19] and bad he categorizes them by being
[1:05:22] righteous
[1:05:23] in christ jesus you see the prophet
[1:05:25] tells us that the very reason they go
[1:05:27] through the tribulation period
[1:05:29] is because they reject the fullness of
[1:05:32] the word
[1:05:33] and its atonement to make them clean so
[1:05:36] they pick out what they want oh boy
[1:05:38] they're against catholicism
[1:05:40] you take a good old southern baptist
[1:05:42] he'll never join up to catholicism
[1:05:44] he'll never join up to the homosexual
[1:05:46] agenda my my there ain't no way in the
[1:05:49] world he'll
[1:05:50] stand right there praise god but you
[1:05:52] tell him you get alone in your prayer
[1:05:54] calls it
[1:05:54] and go to speak in another language
[1:05:56] sometime and see how that good
[1:05:58] man responds then ah
[1:06:01] then you see an attitude from that good
[1:06:04] man
[1:06:05] that goes to ridicule and making fun of
[1:06:07] your bible
[1:06:09] so what happens to his goodness
[1:06:14] praise the lord well say they believe in
[1:06:16] speaking in tongues and then you tell
[1:06:18] them about god senator the prophet of
[1:06:19] malachi
[1:06:20] 4. see what happens to that good man's
[1:06:23] attitude
[1:06:24] or that good woman's attitude so you see
[1:06:27] it's easy for us to look at people and
[1:06:29] categorize them well this is a good man
[1:06:31] that's a good
[1:06:32] man that's not the way god looks at it
[1:06:34] god looks at it as them being loosed
[1:06:36] or separated or washed from their
[1:06:39] unbelief
[1:06:40] by receiving the fullness of his word
[1:06:43] so you know the portions of the word
[1:06:45] that god reveals to us
[1:06:47] the difference between elect and
[1:06:48] non-elect is non-elect will take what
[1:06:51] they want because the word is like a
[1:06:52] smorgasbord to them
[1:06:53] it's like a walk-through buffet so they
[1:06:56] take this they take that they don't want
[1:06:58] this they simply don't get it but that's
[1:07:00] not the way the word works
[1:07:02] god gives it to us and god expects us to
[1:07:04] line up
[1:07:05] now it may take us a week or two or a
[1:07:07] year or whatever it is
[1:07:09] but the elect of god will receive every
[1:07:12] word of god
[1:07:12] because the word is their father is that
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:16] not only that but it is their husband so
[1:07:19] they're joined to him
[1:07:21] through this great power of providence
[1:07:23] which is his truth now other people
[1:07:26] they can belong to this church and be a
[1:07:27] good church member boy
[1:07:29] absolutely a good person and yet they
[1:07:32] don't believe this they don't believe
[1:07:33] that they don't believe that in the
[1:07:34] world
[1:07:35] that cannot be bride friends that cannot
[1:07:37] be bribed because the bride
[1:07:39] will be united totally and completely
[1:07:42] with
[1:07:42] the word so notice this individual this
[1:07:46] church age
[1:07:47] this generation that jesus is speaking
[1:07:49] about
[1:07:50] what's the prophet said that if that
[1:07:52] house isn't filled occupied
[1:07:54] then comes seven other evil demons worse
[1:07:57] than he was and the last stage of this
[1:08:00] place is seven times worse than it was
[1:08:02] at the first place
[1:08:03] they had been better to stay
[1:08:07] oh my goodness now i realize every time
[1:08:12] i deal with this message folks get mad
[1:08:15] at me
[1:08:17] because i do not believe
[1:08:20] the message is like ambway
[1:08:24] i do not believe that the message is a
[1:08:27] pyramid scheme
[1:08:29] i do not believe the message is a
[1:08:31] product
[1:08:32] that we can just hand out to everybody
[1:08:34] oh brother donny don't you think we
[1:08:36] ought to witness
[1:08:37] i do to those that the king leads you to
[1:08:41] witness to
[1:08:42] one of these days you're going to open
[1:08:44] up your eyes and realize
[1:08:46] we would have been better off to left
[1:08:49] some of these lutherans
[1:08:50] in the lucerne church but instead
[1:08:54] we tried to sell our product without the
[1:08:56] leading
[1:08:57] of the holy ghost and we convinced them
[1:09:01] with our ability that the message was
[1:09:03] right they ran it 10 years
[1:09:05] 15 years 20 years 30 years 40
[1:09:09] for some of them and finally
[1:09:12] they come to who they were and they were
[1:09:15] sick
[1:09:16] of sitting in a message church and they
[1:09:18] turn against it
[1:09:19] you'd have been better off to left them
[1:09:21] luther
[1:09:22] because now many of them have crossed
[1:09:26] the line
[1:09:27] and will never be saved
[1:09:32] it's not a product friends that we can
[1:09:35] just go
[1:09:36] throwing here and there and there and
[1:09:38] there the truth
[1:09:40] oh my the word of god is not really
[1:09:43] ours to give it is the spirit of god who
[1:09:47] uses
[1:09:48] our instrumentality you say i'm crazy if
[1:09:51] you want to listen to the very words
[1:09:53] of your prophet they would have been
[1:09:56] better to stay
[1:09:57] looser than it would be to receive the
[1:10:01] light
[1:10:03] and to follow it not saying so a man
[1:10:07] a woman or boy or girl would been better
[1:10:09] off to stay the lucerne or a methodist
[1:10:12] or a baptist
[1:10:13] than they would to be brought to the
[1:10:15] knowledge of the message
[1:10:16] and then turn away from it why you say
[1:10:19] how can that be
[1:10:20] the more light you see when you walk
[1:10:23] from it
[1:10:24] the more grace the more grace
[1:10:27] you're trampling under your feet
[1:10:31] notice this in verse 44 then he says
[1:10:34] i will return into
[1:10:37] notice he realizes whose house this is
[1:10:41] my house
[1:10:45] why the title deed has not been cleared
[1:10:49] on this person's soul
[1:10:51] now there may be they may give up
[1:10:53] drinking they may have given up smoking
[1:10:55] they don't watch bad movies they don't
[1:10:57] listen to bad music
[1:10:59] but that ain't what separates them
[1:11:01] they're still married to that first
[1:11:03] nature they've still got that nature in
[1:11:06] them
[1:11:07] and this demon out of hell can look
[1:11:10] at that house and say that's still
[1:11:13] my house
[1:11:16] they might be worshiping god they might
[1:11:19] sing they might play a guitar they might
[1:11:21] play the piano
[1:11:22] oh my they might be such a oh good
[1:11:26] person
[1:11:30] i will return into
[1:11:34] my house from whence i
[1:11:37] notice his authority notice his position
[1:11:41] had he been cast out by a servant of god
[1:11:45] he cannot truthfully be saying these
[1:11:48] things about i
[1:11:49] and mine and me because he's been made
[1:11:53] to leave by authority
[1:11:55] and he cannot come back unless that
[1:11:58] individual house owner opens up their
[1:12:01] heart and says come back into me
[1:12:05] think of it friends
[1:12:08] and when he has come he findeth it
[1:12:13] empty to be at leisure to be
[1:12:16] idle to be unoccupied
[1:12:21] empty swept to sweep to clean
[1:12:25] by sweeping and garnish to put in order
[1:12:28] arrange make ready prepare
[1:12:31] to ornament adore metaphorically to
[1:12:35] embellish with honor or gain honor now
[1:12:39] look at all the work look at all the
[1:12:41] sermons look at all the prayer and all
[1:12:43] the things that have went into this
[1:12:45] individual's life
[1:12:46] and yet none of that kept that demon out
[1:12:48] of there
[1:12:50] notice he findeth it empty swept
[1:12:54] and garnished oh you know it's
[1:12:57] it's not enough the way the lord jesus
[1:12:59] uses these words
[1:13:00] empty swept and garnished it's more it
[1:13:04] takes
[1:13:05] more than that it must be the right
[1:13:07] tenant
[1:13:08] that moves into that furnace department
[1:13:11] and he takes the keys to the door if
[1:13:15] you're in an apartment from an
[1:13:16] individual
[1:13:17] would you want them having a key to all
[1:13:19] of your house and all of your
[1:13:20] possessions and everything else
[1:13:22] god don't want that devil once you leave
[1:13:24] he leaves out of there
[1:13:25] to have a key into your joy a key into
[1:13:28] your happiness
[1:13:29] a key into this and that and the other
[1:13:30] and when he does we're letting him
[1:13:32] rob us but god wants to take that and
[1:13:35] change the locks
[1:13:36] amen he wants to change the locks while
[1:13:39] the devil used to control my joy
[1:13:41] you need to let the holy ghost change
[1:13:43] the locks to your joy
[1:13:44] all the mother don and we're living in
[1:13:46] terrible times i realize we are
[1:13:48] terrible times should not have the
[1:13:50] skeleton key to your joy
[1:13:52] terrible times should not have the
[1:13:54] skeleton key to your peace
[1:13:56] your prayer life common saints it ought
[1:13:58] to be so given to you by the holy ghost
[1:14:00] that the spirit of god changed
[1:14:02] every lock in your house it changed
[1:14:04] every lock and every avenue of your
[1:14:06] being
[1:14:07] and you say satan may affect me but you
[1:14:09] are not getting in this house get out of
[1:14:12] here oh man
[1:14:14] you see this demon is ironically
[1:14:17] displayed
[1:14:18] in the way that jesus gives him and
[1:14:21] renders him
[1:14:22] as if though he just went for a casual
[1:14:24] walk
[1:14:25] so he's gone for a month or two and he
[1:14:28] walks through
[1:14:29] dry places now you know to the jews the
[1:14:31] way that they looked at hebrewism is
[1:14:33] what it's called
[1:14:34] that they looked at a desert as being a
[1:14:37] dwelling place of demons
[1:14:38] they looked at the number seven the
[1:14:41] number seven is the spiritual number we
[1:14:42] know
[1:14:43] but even in the hebrew way of looking at
[1:14:45] things the number of seven
[1:14:46] was a number of magnitudes so whenever
[1:14:48] jesus used the number of seven
[1:14:50] it would have really got the attention
[1:14:52] of those people we know to us
[1:14:54] god manifests himself in sevens but yet
[1:14:56] the way that they looked at
[1:14:58] it all night must have been so
[1:15:00] overwhelming when jesus now opening up
[1:15:03] this realm
[1:15:04] of demonology but when the demon
[1:15:06] returned what does he do he brings
[1:15:08] seven other devils that are worse than
[1:15:11] himself
[1:15:12] now we know of course that the last days
[1:15:14] of this man
[1:15:15] would have been ended in absolute
[1:15:17] tragedy what's
[1:15:18] in verse 45 then go as he and take us
[1:15:21] with himself
[1:15:22] seven other spirits more wicked than
[1:15:25] himself so showing
[1:15:27] us that there are degrees of wickedness
[1:15:30] as there
[1:15:31] is degrees among spirits whenever god
[1:15:34] created them they had
[1:15:35] a hierarchy of course archaeo is the
[1:15:38] word that was made first and those in
[1:15:39] the first line
[1:15:40] so the life state of this man jesus said
[1:15:44] would be worse oh my what happens they
[1:15:47] enter
[1:15:47] notice the plurality now this entrance
[1:15:50] they enter in
[1:15:51] and dwell there now they're not going to
[1:15:54] leave
[1:15:55] now they're not going to come and go but
[1:15:58] they set up
[1:15:58] housekeeping i wonder friends how many
[1:16:02] that we rub
[1:16:02] shoulders with that has 8
[1:16:06] 10 20 15
[1:16:09] 50 demons in their bodies
[1:16:14] and this is why when you cross them that
[1:16:17] certain demon will
[1:16:19] take their human characteristics and
[1:16:21] traits
[1:16:22] and personify them and they become a
[1:16:25] different
[1:16:26] person that you don't even know you ever
[1:16:28] dealt with something like that
[1:16:30] and then all of a sudden that
[1:16:32] manifestation will be there for 10
[1:16:33] minutes
[1:16:34] or 15 minutes or less and they revert
[1:16:36] back to that other person you think
[1:16:38] what in the world happened to them it
[1:16:41] was one of the
[1:16:42] residents that lives inside that body
[1:16:45] and then another situation would happen
[1:16:48] totally different from that one
[1:16:49] and another demon maybe a demon of chimp
[1:16:52] or whatever more
[1:16:53] which is right next to insanity wanted
[1:16:56] to take this individual's body over
[1:16:58] and according to the stress factor and
[1:17:00] according to what they're dealing with
[1:17:02] each demon will take its spot and
[1:17:05] manifest it or
[1:17:07] manifest itself to that human body if
[1:17:10] demons can do that
[1:17:12] what about the power of the holy ghost
[1:17:14] and a child of god
[1:17:15] if a devil can get a hold of a person
[1:17:18] and change their
[1:17:19] their way of talking their way of
[1:17:21] thinking and give them
[1:17:23] superhuman strength cannot the power of
[1:17:25] the holy ghost
[1:17:27] anoint our face anoint our talking
[1:17:30] anoint our minds
[1:17:31] anoint our prayer that we may get down
[1:17:34] to pray and it's just
[1:17:35] us for the first 15 minutes but all of a
[1:17:37] sudden the holy ghost comes in there
[1:17:39] amen and it's not us anymore it's not
[1:17:42] just
[1:17:42] us reiterating what we thought we'd talk
[1:17:44] about but it's him
[1:17:46] anointing our prayer and them devils out
[1:17:48] of hell are running scared because they
[1:17:50] hear the voice of jesus
[1:17:55] hallelujah and the last state
[1:18:00] of that man is worse than the first so
[1:18:03] it becomes
[1:18:05] more wicked more rotten
[1:18:10] more corrupt now notice such
[1:18:14] are the conditions of apostates
[1:18:19] you see apostasy is
[1:18:22] worse than ever being
[1:18:25] unconverted
[1:18:29] coming to truth and embracing it
[1:18:32] and walking away is worse
[1:18:36] than a person that ever that never even
[1:18:39] got saved
[1:18:42] it's hard for you to ponder it
[1:18:45] you see for the most part many of them
[1:18:49] will never be recovered
[1:18:54] god now
[1:18:57] notice these words that jesus adds
[1:19:00] to this latter part of the verse even
[1:19:03] shall it be
[1:19:04] also unto this wicked
[1:19:07] generation so then the lord jesus
[1:19:10] takes the focus off of just an
[1:19:12] individual
[1:19:13] and he says so will it be even unto this
[1:19:16] wicked generation and
[1:19:18] we know him well enough to know these
[1:19:21] words
[1:19:22] must have been spoken in sorrow
[1:19:25] and heaviness it was no doubt
[1:19:29] from the heart of a loving savior that
[1:19:32] did not
[1:19:33] will it to be this way because he knew
[1:19:36] that as
[1:19:37] a generation israel would reject him
[1:19:41] now he's speaking about an individual
[1:19:43] he's speaking about church ages to come
[1:19:46] but he's also focusing on that
[1:19:48] generation
[1:19:49] of jews now how in the world could we
[1:19:51] ever take this parabolic form
[1:19:54] and focus it on them jews well we would
[1:19:56] have to look at it exactly right
[1:19:59] now remember on the return of them
[1:20:02] coming back out
[1:20:03] of the captivity those of you that have
[1:20:06] studied jewish history you know
[1:20:07] that for the most part a lot of the
[1:20:10] idolatry which they were sold out into
[1:20:13] into babylon and the different kingdoms
[1:20:15] once they come back out
[1:20:17] they never went that direction again
[1:20:20] when they come out even under the
[1:20:21] maccabees and they went in to
[1:20:23] to have the hasmonean war and they want
[1:20:26] him to try to restore
[1:20:28] and it seemingly was a revival sort of
[1:20:30] like luther's day of justification
[1:20:32] to where it brought a spiritual spark of
[1:20:36] fire
[1:20:36] among them and they wanted to worship
[1:20:38] god so you look and see when they come
[1:20:40] out
[1:20:41] that the lord jesus is categorizing
[1:20:43] israel as a whole
[1:20:45] like this individual that god done
[1:20:47] something for them
[1:20:49] and god brought them a long way but
[1:20:51] jesus
[1:20:52] is now standing there with heaviness in
[1:20:55] his heart
[1:20:56] and reading to them their very destiny
[1:21:00] he said i am telling you you generation
[1:21:03] of
[1:21:04] jews i'm telling you what is going to
[1:21:06] happen to you
[1:21:08] before it ever happens i'm going to tell
[1:21:10] you you come out from under the
[1:21:12] babylonian captivity the temple was
[1:21:14] rebuilt and restored but i'm telling you
[1:21:17] now
[1:21:17] you've got all your bonnets and your
[1:21:19] hats and this and that and the other
[1:21:21] and you paid ties of mint and rue and
[1:21:24] coming
[1:21:25] and you do this and that and the other
[1:21:27] but you are
[1:21:28] empty he said your houses are like the
[1:21:31] graves
[1:21:32] that throw the bones of them inside of
[1:21:34] there
[1:21:35] oh my you know how they were in their
[1:21:37] day they were so religious and so lost
[1:21:40] they were so religious and they had
[1:21:42] everything in such order
[1:21:43] but they had no occupant oh my no
[1:21:46] occupant living down inside their soul
[1:21:49] here now jesus takes it and places it
[1:21:52] upon that entire generation
[1:21:54] but let me sound the trumpet to you
[1:21:56] tonight that was peter which fit
[1:21:58] in that generation that was john which
[1:22:01] fit
[1:22:02] in that generation there was different
[1:22:04] ones that also heard this same parable
[1:22:07] but they did not remain in that
[1:22:09] generation why
[1:22:10] because they were called out to be in
[1:22:13] his generation
[1:22:14] they was pharisees they were sadducees
[1:22:17] they were of the essenes they were
[1:22:19] different groups
[1:22:20] that they had come out of but the lord
[1:22:22] jesus had called him
[1:22:24] with his voice light his voice light
[1:22:27] had struck her soul even though they had
[1:22:30] not received the holy ghost yet
[1:22:32] they had been brought out of what they
[1:22:34] were of what they had believed all of
[1:22:37] their lives
[1:22:38] and even though they were born in that
[1:22:40] generation
[1:22:41] they did not fit in that generation may
[1:22:44] i
[1:22:44] say to you our generation is the
[1:22:47] generation that will consummate the
[1:22:49] judgment of god
[1:22:50] our generation our nation will be that
[1:22:53] which sums up the very mind the very
[1:22:55] judgment of god
[1:22:56] but yet because i'm born in this
[1:22:58] generation
[1:22:59] does not mean that i'm numbered with the
[1:23:01] transgressors
[1:23:03] hallelujah why because i have been
[1:23:05] reborn
[1:23:06] into another generation i am
[1:23:09] not or in time my body is still layered
[1:23:12] of sin
[1:23:13] my body may be layered to sin but my
[1:23:15] soul is a gene of god
[1:23:17] in the time frame i'm getting older i'm
[1:23:20] getting weaker
[1:23:21] i'm this and that and the other but my
[1:23:23] soul has eternal life
[1:23:25] it's not one day older now than it was
[1:23:28] before the foundation
[1:23:30] of the world though i am here i do not
[1:23:32] belong here
[1:23:34] though i reside here i have another
[1:23:36] place that i'm going to
[1:23:43] you see it's up to us they were right
[1:23:46] there and heard these words
[1:23:48] they could have said well i guess we're
[1:23:51] doomed too
[1:23:52] peter could have looked at john and john
[1:23:54] looked at james and said
[1:23:56] they don't need them trying ain't no
[1:23:58] needing us even trying to do anything
[1:24:01] if these guys were lost and what about
[1:24:02] us
[1:24:04] but they heard another voice from jesus
[1:24:07] saying all that my father has given me
[1:24:09] will come
[1:24:10] amen they heard these words out of jesus
[1:24:13] mouth too
[1:24:14] but somehow brother dale i believe when
[1:24:15] they heard this they thought
[1:24:17] i mean who i am that don't apply to me
[1:24:20] i'll tell you one thing friend you and i
[1:24:22] need to have this within us
[1:24:23] that whenever we hear somebody talking
[1:24:25] about a preacher preaching about
[1:24:27] deceivers and pharaoh and judas and all
[1:24:29] that and the devil will try to make that
[1:24:31] you you just straighten him out right
[1:24:32] there said devil that ain't me i ain't
[1:24:34] judas
[1:24:35] i am not a deceiver i am not a hypocrite
[1:24:37] i'm not a liar i'm a son or daughter of
[1:24:39] god
[1:24:39] i may have mistakes but that has nothing
[1:24:41] to do with me i am of a higher genealogy
[1:24:44] i am not laodicean i am not going to be
[1:24:47] lost i am not going to be left behind
[1:24:53] oh my notice this hebrews 6
[1:24:56] 4. most of your bible readers are
[1:24:58] familiar with this
[1:24:59] for it is impossible for those who were
[1:25:02] once
[1:25:03] enlightened you have to be very careful
[1:25:06] now when the
[1:25:07] you read this passage that paul did not
[1:25:10] say
[1:25:12] those who were once sealed
[1:25:15] but enlightened which means their eyes
[1:25:18] come
[1:25:18] open to an understanding they didn't
[1:25:21] previously have
[1:25:23] now they were enlightened and they
[1:25:26] actually
[1:25:26] tasted of the heavenly gift singular
[1:25:31] not gifts so they actually
[1:25:34] tasted of the holy ghost now a person
[1:25:40] can taste of it
[1:25:42] i don't want to just taste it i want to
[1:25:45] be sealed by it
[1:25:48] but these people had tasted of the
[1:25:51] heavenly gift
[1:25:52] and were made partakers of the holy
[1:25:56] ghost you see some of them actually had
[1:25:57] a baptism in their spirit
[1:26:01] and have tasted the good word of god
[1:26:05] and the powers of the world to come i'm
[1:26:07] gonna tell you something friends
[1:26:08] these are not infidels these are not
[1:26:10] agnostics these have people
[1:26:12] that are pentecostal in an experience
[1:26:15] where they've actually tasted these are
[1:26:17] not people that don't believe in a move
[1:26:18] of god
[1:26:19] these are not people that don't even
[1:26:20] think god can even do that they even
[1:26:22] know there's more to god than just a
[1:26:24] confession
[1:26:25] that there's something about them that
[1:26:27] they hungered for a little bit more
[1:26:29] beyond hail mary mother of god pray for
[1:26:31] our sinners now the time of our
[1:26:32] departure amen
[1:26:33] that's not the type of people we're
[1:26:34] talking about but they had a hunger for
[1:26:37] the holy ghost so they must have talked
[1:26:38] about the holy ghost
[1:26:40] and they got far enough in far enough
[1:26:42] into the kingdom of god
[1:26:44] that they even tasted of the holy ghost
[1:26:46] i said oh
[1:26:48] oh this is so good
[1:26:51] thank you lord thank you oh praise
[1:26:55] god and they tasted the word they didn't
[1:26:58] just run it in their mind
[1:26:59] but they pulled the word down oh
[1:27:04] oh thank you lord that is so good
[1:27:07] that word oh it's so good
[1:27:12] i know i know i know this is serious but
[1:27:16] we're in serious times
[1:27:19] have tasted the good word of god and the
[1:27:22] powers
[1:27:23] of the world to come
[1:27:28] if they shall fall away
[1:27:34] which is what the word apostate
[1:27:38] apostasy if they become
[1:27:42] apostate to what they said what they
[1:27:46] saw what they ate what they experienced
[1:27:50] and then they turn and walk away from it
[1:27:54] to renew them again unto repentance
[1:27:58] seeing they crucified to themselves
[1:28:02] the son of god afresh and put him
[1:28:07] to an open shame
[1:28:10] so you see jesus speaking
[1:28:13] to the children of the children of the
[1:28:15] children of the children of the children
[1:28:17] of the jews that came out of the exile
[1:28:22] and they were justified by faith we'll
[1:28:25] say
[1:28:26] they come on up under the maccabees
[1:28:28] which is prior to the coming of the lord
[1:28:30] jesus of course
[1:28:31] and they had been able to experience a
[1:28:35] cleansing
[1:28:36] for he goes into the temple
[1:28:39] and cleanses a lot of the mythology that
[1:28:42] had been brought into the
[1:28:44] temple prior to this is prior to the
[1:28:45] coming of john the baptist
[1:28:47] so they experience an element of
[1:28:50] sanctification
[1:28:52] so the house is swept it's garnished
[1:28:56] and here come the king himself and what
[1:28:59] did he tell them harry
[1:29:00] except you eat my flesh and drink
[1:29:04] my blood you have no life in you
[1:29:08] what's he offering them himself
[1:29:12] y'all are clean you're swept you're
[1:29:15] garnished
[1:29:16] you've got everything in order i
[1:29:19] am what you need
[1:29:23] and they said we will not have this man
[1:29:25] to rule over us
[1:29:27] say we not well thou art a samaritan and
[1:29:31] has to devil
[1:29:36] so the lord jesus offered to take the
[1:29:38] keys of their soul
[1:29:40] keys of their spirit keys of their
[1:29:43] reasoning
[1:29:44] their imagine nation their conscience
[1:29:46] their affection
[1:29:48] but they said we'll have nothing to do
[1:29:50] with this man so they reached down and
[1:29:52] picked up stones whenever he
[1:29:54] took the book there and opened it up and
[1:29:56] said this day this scripture is
[1:29:57] fulfilled before your sight
[1:29:59] and the bible said they went to plunge
[1:30:01] him down the cliff their heads long
[1:30:04] to kill him they also in another place
[1:30:06] when he was announcer
[1:30:07] picked up stones to stone him the man
[1:30:10] that come to take up residence
[1:30:13] in their furnished apartment but they
[1:30:16] said we don't want you in our house
[1:30:19] you're not welcome here
[1:30:23] so jesus said then your house will be
[1:30:27] left unto you
[1:30:28] unoccupied and desolate
[1:30:32] and i tell you now you will become
[1:30:35] possessed
[1:30:36] with more demons and you will be worse
[1:30:40] than your father was pre-exile
[1:30:45] you will be worse than the canaanites
[1:30:49] now think of it friends the canaanites
[1:30:52] were horrible people
[1:30:54] horrible some of the practices and
[1:30:57] things that they did was
[1:30:59] unbelievable but when you look at the
[1:31:02] mercy of god that dealt with the
[1:31:04] children of israel and the way god
[1:31:05] brought them out god punished the
[1:31:07] children of israel worse than he did the
[1:31:09] canaanites
[1:31:10] why they drunk the nectar of his cup
[1:31:15] they took from the bread of his table
[1:31:18] you see the more mercy is given to us
[1:31:21] when god opens his word to us and gives
[1:31:24] us a revelation you understand what he's
[1:31:26] doing
[1:31:26] he's unveiling a portion of himself to
[1:31:29] us
[1:31:30] that is mercy not just mercy when you
[1:31:32] get saved
[1:31:33] every time you get a revelation from the
[1:31:35] throne of god it's a further extension
[1:31:37] of the personality of god revealed in
[1:31:38] your life
[1:31:39] more mercy more mercy mercy about
[1:31:41] healing mercy about grace mercy about
[1:31:43] overcoming and when a person
[1:31:45] turns from each of those steps of
[1:31:47] revelation he tramples the blood of god
[1:31:50] the mercy of the almighty god
[1:31:52] right under foot and so i'm going to go
[1:31:54] back and be what i was before i come to
[1:31:56] this message
[1:31:57] that is totally completely
[1:32:00] impossible
[1:32:04] all these folks have left this message
[1:32:06] will never
[1:32:08] ever get away from it i'll tell you
[1:32:11] right now
[1:32:12] probably more than likely most of them
[1:32:14] who have turned away
[1:32:16] never have a week that goes by in their
[1:32:18] life
[1:32:19] that they don't think say or something
[1:32:22] about this message
[1:32:23] remember truth does one of two things it
[1:32:26] binds you
[1:32:28] or sets you free
[1:32:31] what's so sad many of these that have
[1:32:33] turned and went away
[1:32:35] they're bound right at the door of this
[1:32:38] message
[1:32:38] they talk about it more now than they
[1:32:40] ever did
[1:32:41] they mentioned the name william branham
[1:32:43] in reproach and repulsively sure
[1:32:45] but they'll never get free from it
[1:32:53] add me lord jesus
[1:32:59] lord god you see
[1:33:03] even though he left
[1:33:08] and left them in this state
[1:33:11] he found a house empty
[1:33:14] but before he left things started coming
[1:33:18] in
[1:33:20] now think of it i mean carol was talking
[1:33:23] about this week and i told her said you
[1:33:24] know what must have been something
[1:33:27] as the scribes the pharisees and many of
[1:33:29] those religious
[1:33:30] leaders of that day once the light of
[1:33:33] jesus shined on them and they turned it
[1:33:35] down
[1:33:36] nicodemus said rabbi we know thou art a
[1:33:38] teacher that cometh from god
[1:33:40] no man can do these things except god be
[1:33:42] with him
[1:33:43] right jesus said if you were blind you
[1:33:46] would have no sin
[1:33:48] but because you say we see therefore
[1:33:50] your sin remains
[1:33:53] imagine their wives and their families
[1:33:56] must have been overwhelmed as they saw
[1:33:58] these leaders
[1:34:00] changed by the way they got more corrupt
[1:34:03] more vile they lied
[1:34:06] they twisted the torah you imagine how
[1:34:10] surprised at those
[1:34:11] men on the sanhedrin they were so
[1:34:14] overwhelmed by the way the religious
[1:34:17] leaders carried out the trial and
[1:34:19] crucifixion of the lord jesus
[1:34:20] because they knew it was absolutely
[1:34:22] contrary according to the very law that
[1:34:24] they said they believed
[1:34:26] it forbid them from having a trial in
[1:34:28] nighttime
[1:34:30] and whenever the witnesses would not
[1:34:32] corroborate their testimony
[1:34:33] then whatever they was trying to
[1:34:35] accomplish out of them witnesses
[1:34:37] then witnesses would have it done to
[1:34:39] them according to the law the torah and
[1:34:41] the misha
[1:34:42] they should have taken them men which
[1:34:44] lied against the lord jesus
[1:34:45] and crucified them if they believed what
[1:34:47] their prophet said
[1:34:49] but they didn't believe it demons
[1:34:52] started
[1:34:52] entering in lying devils corrupt devils
[1:34:56] political devils
[1:35:00] lord jesus
[1:35:04] the most holy people of that day
[1:35:07] but there they crucified
[1:35:10] him there the most religious place on
[1:35:13] the earth
[1:35:14] they the most religious people on the
[1:35:17] earth
[1:35:17] crucified the most painful shameful
[1:35:20] death
[1:35:21] that a person can go through him
[1:35:24] the most lovely most pure hallelujah
[1:35:29] their day they who they who
[1:35:32] thought they were the cream of the crop
[1:35:34] they who believed they were
[1:35:36] in charge of god sheep oh
[1:35:42] you imagine as the wars begin to rage
[1:35:47] you know the prophet if you haven't
[1:35:49] listened to this oneness of god i'm sure
[1:35:50] many of you have but
[1:35:51] if you haven't do you're good to listen
[1:35:53] to it in there brother branham
[1:35:55] brings out also on the uniting time and
[1:35:58] sign especially
[1:35:59] from the political aspect that the jews
[1:36:03] had to unite together
[1:36:05] in order to reject the word christ
[1:36:08] and when they united against him then
[1:36:11] titus started uniting his army and he
[1:36:14] said i believe we're living
[1:36:16] in a uniting time praise the lord
[1:36:20] we seem united and don't we we see it
[1:36:22] right now going on in our nation
[1:36:24] things that's happened in the last week
[1:36:25] or two we never thought we'd ever see
[1:36:27] come on saints and if you voice your
[1:36:30] opinion about certain things they are
[1:36:32] united against you
[1:36:33] to shut you up well praise the lord is
[1:36:37] that right
[1:36:38] and it's exactly got to be so why so god
[1:36:41] will allow communism
[1:36:44] god will allow russia to unite together
[1:36:49] and this nation will pay the ultimate
[1:36:51] price
[1:36:52] they will run to the mother these
[1:36:55] prostitute daughters will run and they
[1:36:58] will join in allegiance together
[1:37:00] because they don't want to oh my give up
[1:37:02] their evangelical rights
[1:37:03] so they will run back to mama and they
[1:37:06] will join together
[1:37:07] and they will unite together and when
[1:37:09] they are in the spirit of united
[1:37:11] god is going to have a nation that will
[1:37:14] be raised up
[1:37:15] and will have the vatican's name wrote
[1:37:18] on a bomb
[1:37:20] oh my goodness old but brother donald oh
[1:37:22] i'm so afraid i'm so afraid
[1:37:24] don't be afraid you you need to unite
[1:37:26] yourself
[1:37:27] you see while they're united and all the
[1:37:30] left is uniting and the right so-called
[1:37:32] is uniting and this one's united
[1:37:34] this is another uniting that is going on
[1:37:36] and you know what the title of that
[1:37:38] sermon that he preached in 1963 was
[1:37:40] uniting time and science everybody's
[1:37:43] uniting
[1:37:44] under something what people are looking
[1:37:46] at they say oh my facebook
[1:37:48] is doing this and youtube is doing that
[1:37:50] oh my they shut this guy up well what
[1:37:52] are they watching they're watching
[1:37:53] facebook signs
[1:37:54] and they're watching watching twitter
[1:37:56] sign well tweet tweet tweet to you too
[1:37:58] i'm not watching twitter i'm not
[1:38:00] watching facebook
[1:38:01] i'm watching the signs right here in his
[1:38:03] word oh no i'm not uniting with twitter
[1:38:06] i'm not uniting with facebook i'm
[1:38:08] uniting what's the word
[1:38:10] because if they are united what are they
[1:38:12] doing it for
[1:38:13] so the atomic powers can begin to unite
[1:38:16] together
[1:38:16] in order to wipe them off the face of
[1:38:19] the earth
[1:38:19] and annihilate them
[1:38:23] oh my
[1:38:27] but don't worry children hallelujah
[1:38:31] before one of them bombs ever drop
[1:38:34] praise god you'll be leaving this world
[1:38:39] praise be to god oh
[1:38:43] the lord jesus was not invited
[1:38:47] to occupy this empty
[1:38:51] sadducee house this empty
[1:38:55] essene house this empty
[1:38:58] herodian house this empty
[1:39:01] pharisee house they would not allow him
[1:39:05] can't you see people today exactly the
[1:39:07] same thing
[1:39:07] they want him to be a savior but stay
[1:39:10] out of their closet stay out of their
[1:39:12] music
[1:39:13] tell them don't tell them what books to
[1:39:15] read and what movies to watch and what
[1:39:16] music to listen to
[1:39:17] you keep that preaching to yourself
[1:39:19] preacher ain't nobody going to tell me
[1:39:22] what to do
[1:39:22] fine i'm going to tell you the
[1:39:25] requirements if you want to go you'll
[1:39:26] line up to them
[1:39:28] and if you don't that choice is entirely
[1:39:30] up to you what are you doing lord jesus
[1:39:32] i want you to be my savior but i don't
[1:39:34] want you to be my husband
[1:39:36] i don't want to be married to you lord
[1:39:38] but the bride says lord
[1:39:40] lord whatever you want i give you every
[1:39:43] key
[1:39:44] i give you absolutely every key of my
[1:39:47] life lord
[1:39:48] here's the key to my memory there's a
[1:39:50] key to my conscience
[1:39:51] here's the key to the music i listen to
[1:39:53] to the books i read to the places i go
[1:39:55] to whatever i do lord i give you the key
[1:39:58] to everything because you know better
[1:39:59] how to keep house than i do
[1:40:01] it's evident lord i don't know how to
[1:40:02] keep house because i i'm a bad
[1:40:04] housekeeper
[1:40:05] come on saints if the pharisees could
[1:40:07] just admit it to imagine nicodemus
[1:40:10] setting their friend it would have been
[1:40:11] better for him
[1:40:13] to have never seen what he saw
[1:40:19] well brother donnie what about me what
[1:40:21] about you
[1:40:25] we have seen god's mercy
[1:40:28] we have seen god do so many things
[1:40:32] let's not let it turn against us
[1:40:40] you see this parable
[1:40:44] was worded in such a perfect sense
[1:40:48] to identify that generation imagine they
[1:40:52] got so
[1:40:53] angry they got so upset
[1:40:57] i wonder how many demons entered them
[1:41:01] when they heard jesus preach the word
[1:41:04] instead of repenting they got
[1:41:06] so mad and so angry
[1:41:09] and when they did they opened their soul
[1:41:12] right there in that meeting
[1:41:14] and the demon stepped right inside
[1:41:18] of their soul
[1:41:21] you imagine when they went home that
[1:41:22] evening brother dave after church
[1:41:24] and they were so mean and so
[1:41:28] grouchy and so contrary and the wife was
[1:41:31] saying what's the matter with you
[1:41:34] are you are you sick and you know i'm
[1:41:36] fine
[1:41:38] you're not the way you was this morning
[1:41:40] where you've been today i've been to
[1:41:42] church
[1:41:43] i didn't hear jesus preach and i didn't
[1:41:47] like it
[1:41:50] you see friends when we come to the
[1:41:52] house of god
[1:41:54] we don't realize there's demons here
[1:41:59] there's angels are here great angelic
[1:42:02] powers
[1:42:03] are warring right in there in this place
[1:42:05] in that oh i can feel them
[1:42:09] they war for what occupancy
[1:42:17] praise god
[1:42:20] oh i don't look like much i'm certainly
[1:42:23] not a great preacher
[1:42:25] but you see none of that is what scares
[1:42:27] the devils away
[1:42:29] but it's when they come up to the house
[1:42:31] and see the sign
[1:42:33] occupied not for rent
[1:42:36] nor for sale my height my weight
[1:42:40] how old i am good preacher not a good
[1:42:42] preacher good singer not a good singer
[1:42:44] has absolutely nothing to do with it
[1:42:46] it's the occupation sign that drives
[1:42:48] them back
[1:42:50] now you see i could jump i could shout i
[1:42:52] could run i could do all of those things
[1:42:53] that's not the sign
[1:42:55] that they run from but brother if they
[1:42:57] see jesus in the driver's seat
[1:42:59] don't worry demons won't be hitchhiking
[1:43:01] in your car
[1:43:02] that's right they're not afraid of me
[1:43:04] and you they're not afraid of even our
[1:43:05] knowledge of the word of god
[1:43:07] but if it's the personality i don't know
[1:43:09] exactly what they see
[1:43:10] but i do know from the discernments that
[1:43:12] i've looked at and what the prophet of
[1:43:14] god saw
[1:43:15] than whenever he would see a sinner and
[1:43:17] he would look at them and say
[1:43:18] you've got really good faith to not be a
[1:43:20] christian i see that you're a sinner
[1:43:22] tonight
[1:43:23] i see that darkness that's hanging
[1:43:24] around you or a woman who'd call out and
[1:43:26] say you're praying for your son your
[1:43:28] son's got this this and this
[1:43:29] and you want your daughter's got that
[1:43:31] and that not only that they're unsaved i
[1:43:33] see darkness hanging around them
[1:43:34] and he would identify whether or not
[1:43:36] they were believers or
[1:43:38] unbelievers by light or darkness and he
[1:43:39] looked to another and say i know you
[1:43:41] feel welcome let me describe how you're
[1:43:43] feeling
[1:43:43] it's a real comfortable feeling it's
[1:43:46] light all around you
[1:43:47] you are a believer he never said oh let
[1:43:50] me measure your hair system let me
[1:43:51] measure your
[1:43:52] hair brothers uh how long is your skirt
[1:43:53] how long was your dress uh what church
[1:43:55] do you go to
[1:43:56] it was a pulsation from their soul that
[1:43:59] let him read and let him see in that
[1:44:01] realm don't you understand
[1:44:02] that's the same realm that demons were
[1:44:04] in all my i was doing a study last night
[1:44:06] on diabetes
[1:44:07] and i looked at all the quotes that
[1:44:09] brother branham said about 340 360
[1:44:11] something like that
[1:44:12] and as i began to look at it i saw how
[1:44:14] that whatever a person would come up
[1:44:15] with diabetes
[1:44:16] and then another one begin to scream out
[1:44:18] on the audience and he would say where
[1:44:20] was that
[1:44:21] what happened what what was it where was
[1:44:23] it he said oh my i'm getting so tired
[1:44:25] now
[1:44:25] satan will try to trick you lord help me
[1:44:27] lord please help me
[1:44:28] and then he looked around where was that
[1:44:30] woman where was that woman
[1:44:32] oh i see there it was oh no she's
[1:44:34] delivered
[1:44:35] she's delivered oh that's another one
[1:44:37] out there everybody in the building just
[1:44:39] got diabetes stand to your feet right
[1:44:41] now he said
[1:44:42] you're healed in the name of jesus
[1:44:44] christ
[1:44:45] and he said satan thought he would pull
[1:44:47] one over satan thought he would do that
[1:44:49] but what did them dumb devils do
[1:44:51] they just expose themselves it was a
[1:44:54] warfare that was going on
[1:44:56] all the discernment ain't here tonight a
[1:44:58] prophet is not here to tell us the
[1:44:59] secrets of our hearts
[1:45:01] but the sword is going for and devils
[1:45:03] hate that word
[1:45:04] and that word is here to set us free
[1:45:07] that word is here to deliver us of our
[1:45:10] evils it's here hallelujah to bring
[1:45:12] healing to
[1:45:13] our bodies you believe it with all your
[1:45:15] heart we are
[1:45:16] not that generation but we are his
[1:45:19] generation
[1:45:22] praise be to god praise
[1:45:26] be to god you imagine they got so
[1:45:29] bad so bad till their last destruction
[1:45:35] was total annihilation
[1:45:38] the blood run out the streets
[1:45:41] they boil their children and eat them
[1:45:45] paid to bark off the trees
[1:45:48] the grass off the ground
[1:45:52] that would have been bad enough but they
[1:45:55] died
[1:45:56] lost
[1:46:00] titus and camped about the city and they
[1:46:01] thought oh we're fine we're good
[1:46:03] we're good
[1:46:06] they went into the temple and prayed oh
[1:46:09] great jehovah
[1:46:11] great father so and so come and pray for
[1:46:13] us and they run into the temple
[1:46:15] and they begin to offer sacrifice and
[1:46:17] they prayed
[1:46:18] and they went through all of that and
[1:46:19] while that was going on they was busting
[1:46:22] down the gates and burning
[1:46:23] the gates and here was the romans
[1:46:26] flooding in the city
[1:46:27] and they killed them and slaughtered
[1:46:29] them by the thousands
[1:46:31] but not one believer was found in the
[1:46:35] city
[1:46:36] why they heard the words of jesus
[1:46:38] through his own body
[1:46:40] and then they heard the words of jesus
[1:46:42] through his bride body
[1:46:44] and when they began to see the signs you
[1:46:46] know what they'd done
[1:46:47] they packed up their stuff and left
[1:46:49] before the tribulation period set in
[1:46:52] america hallelujah they packed up their
[1:46:56] stuff
[1:46:56] there was not one believer that had to
[1:46:59] boil their child
[1:47:00] there was not one believer that had the
[1:47:03] tree bark brother they had done fed on
[1:47:05] the word
[1:47:05] and that's united with the time and the
[1:47:07] sign and they was out of there they
[1:47:10] left it by the grace of god
[1:47:13] let me read you a couple more scriptures
[1:47:14] and we'll close watch how paul
[1:47:17] was dealing now with this thing remember
[1:47:19] thessalonians written around 6-61
[1:47:22] so this is before the last phase of this
[1:47:25] starts to kick in for you brethren
[1:47:26] become followers of the churches of god
[1:47:29] which in judea are in christ jesus
[1:47:32] for you also have suffered like things
[1:47:37] ah not of the persians
[1:47:42] not of the babylonians but of your own
[1:47:47] countrymen even as they have
[1:47:50] of the jews
[1:47:54] the most religious people on the world
[1:47:57] and now they are setting up
[1:47:59] a persecution against the elect of god
[1:48:05] so today they try to do it by facebook
[1:48:07] and emails and
[1:48:08] challenge you to this and that and the
[1:48:10] other
[1:48:11] persecute you run you down call your
[1:48:15] names
[1:48:16] now watch him as he goes on to describe
[1:48:18] who both killed
[1:48:20] the lord jesus and their own prophets
[1:48:26] wouldn't you hate for a prophet of god
[1:48:27] to write this about you
[1:48:32] who both killed the lord jesus and their
[1:48:35] own prophets
[1:48:36] and have persecuted us
[1:48:41] and they please not god
[1:48:44] not only that they're contrary
[1:48:47] to all men they can't get along with
[1:48:50] nobody
[1:48:52] by now they have moved into such a state
[1:48:55] of
[1:48:55] misery they can't get along with anybody
[1:48:59] why demons
[1:49:01] are now inhabiting their bodies
[1:49:05] you understand what causes wars right
[1:49:07] from the sermon victory day
[1:49:09] sir vista 1963 the prophet said what
[1:49:12] brings wars
[1:49:14] is because the spirit of france well
[1:49:16] gets jealous of the spirit of germany
[1:49:19] and the spirit of germany gets spirit
[1:49:21] jealous of the spirit of america
[1:49:23] and then them demons go to fighting and
[1:49:25] what they do is get under the german
[1:49:27] influence
[1:49:28] and the swiss influence and then they
[1:49:30] bring that manifestation upon the earth
[1:49:32] and they start firing bullets and fired
[1:49:34] cannons and all that at one another
[1:49:35] that's what happens in denominations
[1:49:37] well i hope you understand what i'm
[1:49:38] fixing to say
[1:49:39] that's what's happened to the politics
[1:49:41] of america there's demons that's in
[1:49:43] charge of one party
[1:49:45] and demons that's in charge of another
[1:49:46] party because remember satan is the king
[1:49:48] of both sides
[1:49:50] they can't get along with one another
[1:49:51] they can't get along among themselves so
[1:49:53] what do they do
[1:49:54] they fuss and fight and now they're so
[1:49:56] split and divided among themselves
[1:49:57] oh but boy brother donna given enough
[1:50:00] time biden will bring peace
[1:50:01] are you that ignorant are american
[1:50:04] people that ignorant and dumb that covet
[1:50:06] is going to fly away once biden is
[1:50:08] anointed
[1:50:08] are we that dumb are we that blind that
[1:50:11] we cannot see we are at the end time
[1:50:13] i don't care who we vote in it is beyond
[1:50:16] redemption friend
[1:50:17] don't focus your time and your prayers
[1:50:19] oh god oh god that bad let trump hear
[1:50:22] you better say god let me win
[1:50:24] let me get out of this place lord jesus
[1:50:26] don't you understand whatever
[1:50:28] people get into and even believers
[1:50:30] getting on facebook from what i'm told
[1:50:32] and fussing and arguing and fighting
[1:50:34] about politics don't you know what
[1:50:35] you're doing
[1:50:36] you're getting under that demonic spirit
[1:50:42] oh my and they fast and they fight and
[1:50:45] they argue
[1:50:47] well what's the answer i'll tell you
[1:50:49] what the answer is a godly
[1:50:51] king and in our state state
[1:50:55] it is king god king theophany
[1:50:58] king jesus notice what paul said
[1:51:02] forbidding us to speak ah
[1:51:08] so they started working on their freedom
[1:51:10] of speech did they
[1:51:14] forbidding us to speak to the gentiles
[1:51:19] that they might be saved now he doesn't
[1:51:21] go into the details to describe
[1:51:23] what they were doing but these evil
[1:51:26] demon possessed
[1:51:27] people were trying to stop the apostles
[1:51:32] from preaching the truth
[1:51:40] and this is the reason why to
[1:51:43] fill up their sins alway
[1:51:47] for the wrath is come upon them
[1:51:51] to the uttermost
[1:51:54] mama and about four years five years
[1:51:58] later
[1:51:59] it starts and it goes on from 66
[1:52:03] to 67 to 68
[1:52:06] to 69 to 70.
[1:52:11] and then titus rides in and takes it
[1:52:14] over
[1:52:16] kills them by the thousands
[1:52:20] according to some of the historical
[1:52:21] writings over a million
[1:52:24] people died
[1:52:30] died thinking this going to heaven died
[1:52:33] singing songs to jehovah
[1:52:36] and you imagine when they opened up
[1:52:37] their eyes
[1:52:39] in the regions of the lost
[1:52:42] and they thought god have mercy
[1:52:45] what am i doing here
[1:52:48] because they took on their destiny
[1:52:52] their deceit their discrepancy and their
[1:52:55] lives
[1:52:56] personified well if people start acting
[1:53:00] like hell before they get to it
[1:53:03] you and i are to start acting like
[1:53:04] heaven before we reach ours
[1:53:07] well to be more and more like the lord
[1:53:09] jesus but it's harder now brother donny
[1:53:11] but the power of god is greater
[1:53:13] you're going to focus on how hard it is
[1:53:14] you want to focus on how god big
[1:53:16] how big our god is oh it's dark it's
[1:53:18] shark that's right i'll agree with you
[1:53:20] but the light has never been so bright
[1:53:21] you want me to preach about how dark it
[1:53:23] is or how light it is
[1:53:24] oh but there's so much sickness but
[1:53:26] there's so many miracles happening so
[1:53:27] much healing that's taking place
[1:53:29] our god is superior over all the powers
[1:53:31] of darkness
[1:53:34] amen let's read this
[1:53:38] let's stand together second peter
[1:53:39] chapter 2 verse verse 21
[1:53:41] we'll pick it up again lord willing for
[1:53:44] it had been better for them
[1:53:46] not to have known
[1:53:49] the way of righteousness
[1:53:53] then after notice after they have
[1:53:57] known it to turn
[1:54:02] from the holy commandment
[1:54:06] i want you to notice the way peter
[1:54:07] writes this the same way paul does
[1:54:10] they're not turning from something they
[1:54:12] have in their soul
[1:54:14] but from something they've been taught a
[1:54:17] commandment which is something written
[1:54:20] and they accepted it as a commandment of
[1:54:21] god and believed it was right
[1:54:24] and peter says it would have been better
[1:54:26] for them to have never
[1:54:28] known it than after they have known the
[1:54:31] way of righteousness after they have
[1:54:32] known it
[1:54:33] to turn away from the holy commandment
[1:54:36] delivered unto them now can you imagine
[1:54:40] that god would anoint this man to
[1:54:42] categorize it in such a way
[1:54:44] that darkness darkness
[1:54:49] would have been less a sin than to
[1:54:52] embrace light and say i see it i see it
[1:54:56] i see it and then down the road turn
[1:54:59] away and say
[1:55:00] that was a bunch of lies
[1:55:04] that was totally wrong
[1:55:07] when really inside of their soul they
[1:55:10] still know it's right
[1:55:17] lord have mercy children
[1:55:21] may god help us why brother donny
[1:55:25] they sinned against more
[1:55:28] mercy more grace
[1:55:33] oh my
[1:55:37] and actually they become more capable
[1:55:40] of worse sin you see an apostasy
[1:55:44] and a person that is apostasizer one
[1:55:46] that is in such a state
[1:55:48] is actually liable of greater punishment
[1:55:53] remember brother ben tom had earned
[1:55:55] baxter whenever he said about
[1:55:59] paul and whenever he mentioned demas and
[1:56:03] ernin told brother branham he said
[1:56:04] brother ma'am you know the first thing
[1:56:05] i'm gonna do when i get to him and he
[1:56:06] said what urn
[1:56:07] he said i'm gonna walk right up to demas
[1:56:10] and i'm gonna smack him right in the
[1:56:12] face
[1:56:14] and say how did you forsake paul down
[1:56:16] there
[1:56:18] brother baby said earn i think i'd be
[1:56:21] careful
[1:56:23] about wanting to go where demas went
[1:56:29] now remember he said demas did not go
[1:56:31] back to the world
[1:56:32] he was a preacher but he turned his back
[1:56:36] on the prophet of god and the prophet's
[1:56:38] message
[1:56:40] because he started seeing things you may
[1:56:43] remember the sermon that the lord gave
[1:56:45] me several years ago
[1:56:46] on the failure of intellectual faith
[1:56:50] and the lord had me to bring it in the
[1:56:51] first person
[1:56:53] of demas as if i was demas when i was
[1:56:57] preaching it and i started bringing
[1:56:59] points about demas
[1:57:01] how he might have started questioning
[1:57:03] because paul
[1:57:06] he was with him and he'd see his eyes
[1:57:08] get all runny and
[1:57:10] festered up and paul had to cancel
[1:57:12] meetings
[1:57:14] because he couldn't see and then he'd
[1:57:16] finally start
[1:57:17] coming to a little bit and coming out of
[1:57:19] it
[1:57:20] and he'd write a little small book and
[1:57:22] paul said i had to to write this with
[1:57:24] large letters now the book itself wasn't
[1:57:26] about five or six
[1:57:27] chapters but he's actually talking about
[1:57:29] the size of the letters
[1:57:31] can you imagine him sitting there and
[1:57:32] trying to look at it
[1:57:34] demons sitting over watching and say
[1:57:37] this can't be right
[1:57:39] i've seen that man lay hands on the sick
[1:57:41] and watch them
[1:57:43] i've seen him lay hands on a man with a
[1:57:44] bloody flux
[1:57:46] i've seen him do this and that another
[1:57:49] he's losing his ministry he's washed up
[1:57:53] he's finished then he wrote to one of
[1:57:57] them and said
[1:57:58] whenever you come down here timothy to
[1:58:00] visit me
[1:58:01] would you bring that coat i left up our
[1:58:04] troas
[1:58:05] i forgot my code up there and demons saw
[1:58:07] a man like that
[1:58:10] was only one goat i can't follow such a
[1:58:14] man
[1:58:15] demas of course was a wealthy guy a lot
[1:58:19] of goods and things around him
[1:58:23] we come down to the end and paul said
[1:58:25] all men
[1:58:26] have forsaken me they've all left me
[1:58:30] sitting down are the rats running over
[1:58:31] his feet
[1:58:34] drop old molded bread down there to him
[1:58:37] and demon said how could that be a
[1:58:39] servant of god
[1:58:42] i just can't believe it brother now i'll
[1:58:45] tell you i i'm really sorry
[1:58:48] i i'd like to make a recanting video and
[1:58:50] put it on youtube
[1:58:53] now i'm free from that that cult
[1:58:57] called paul
[1:59:00] i'll tell you brother and i i repent
[1:59:02] before you
[1:59:04] and i i join sides with you all now and
[1:59:06] i i'm against that paul
[1:59:10] lord god
[1:59:13] let me just tell you the way i feel
[1:59:18] if you folks in a year from now or a
[1:59:20] week or a month
[1:59:22] besides you no longer want to go this
[1:59:24] way of the message of malachi
[1:59:25] 4 and you figure the only way
[1:59:28] to shut me up is to vote me out
[1:59:32] if need be i'll walk out of here with my
[1:59:34] wife
[1:59:36] even if my daughters don't follow my
[1:59:39] son-in-laws
[1:59:40] my granddaughters i'll walk out by
[1:59:43] myself
[1:59:45] before i will recant
[1:59:48] this word that has changed
[1:59:51] my life
[1:59:57] and you folks that have left the message
[1:59:58] you want us to leave this
[2:00:00] and follow you would you please
[2:00:03] send me your testimonies of how many are
[2:00:06] getting filled with the holy ghost
[2:00:08] by following you please tell
[2:00:12] me how many are getting delivered of
[2:00:14] addictions
[2:00:15] please tell me how many are getting
[2:00:17] healed of cancers
[2:00:19] please let me know how many are getting
[2:00:22] delivered of besetting
[2:00:24] sins as carol and i
[2:00:27] talked with someone after church on
[2:00:29] sunday
[2:00:30] and i began to talk by the spirit of god
[2:00:32] and asked the person
[2:00:34] something they wanted to say and they
[2:00:35] talked for just a couple of minutes
[2:00:37] maybe
[2:00:39] and i started talking led of the holy
[2:00:41] ghost and i just kept talking
[2:00:43] kept talking and kept talking and i told
[2:00:45] the individual
[2:00:46] i'm sorry i didn't mean to take all your
[2:00:49] time now you say something and the
[2:00:50] person said
[2:00:52] you answered every question that i had
[2:00:54] on my heart
[2:00:56] i don't have anything else left to say
[2:01:00] so some of you that want to argue your
[2:01:02] theology
[2:01:04] you come and do that
[2:01:08] don't prove it by your words but paul
[2:01:11] said
[2:01:11] i will know the power of them
[2:01:15] not their words i'm not here to argue
[2:01:19] i'm not here to debate let's see the god
[2:01:23] who answers
[2:01:24] by fire come on now don't get scared
[2:01:29] well if you all have been sent to set us
[2:01:31] free from this message bondage
[2:01:33] you ought to have signs god always
[2:01:35] confirms the word
[2:01:37] with signs following
[2:01:41] oh but you're great theologians but you
[2:01:44] have no power huh
[2:01:47] well sorry this ignorant kentucky boy
[2:01:50] ain't going to follow you because my god
[2:01:54] is a god of supernatural
[2:01:57] well come on children what about it
[2:02:00] happy valley
[2:02:01] you want to leave you want to go back to
[2:02:03] that old vomit back to that old pig pen
[2:02:05] you were in
[2:02:06] not me i like it out here being free
[2:02:09] from all that mud
[2:02:11] i like it out here being free from all
[2:02:13] that stuff don't you
[2:02:14] praise god you'll find a hog return back
[2:02:18] to that pig pen but you'll never find a
[2:02:20] sheep there in the first place
[2:02:21] is that right my i don't get worried at
[2:02:24] all when i see a hog wallering in the
[2:02:26] mud
[2:02:26] but if i see sheep down there i'd say
[2:02:28] boy there's something bad wrong
[2:02:30] because why it's different from a nature
[2:02:32] of a sheep to get in such stuff
[2:02:34] i don't marvel that hogs go and lead to
[2:02:37] apostasy
[2:02:38] but i know that genuine elect can no
[2:02:40] more leave this word
[2:02:42] then god can leave them they are
[2:02:45] germatized to the seed of life
[2:02:47] hallelujah
[2:02:48] and you cannot burn it out of them you
[2:02:50] cannot pull it out of them
[2:02:52] whenever they tried to get polycarp to
[2:02:54] deny it he said i'm an old man
[2:02:57] he said in hell my days he's done me
[2:03:00] good
[2:03:00] oh polycarp you're an old man come deny
[2:03:03] him now and he said
[2:03:04] i cannot deny him i will not recant
[2:03:07] can you imagine as they stood there and
[2:03:10] they burned them at the stake
[2:03:11] and they pierced them through with the
[2:03:13] sword and they offered them wealth and
[2:03:15] they offered them money
[2:03:16] but the true one stood there and said i
[2:03:18] will not recant
[2:03:19] but on the other hand there was some and
[2:03:21] they come right to the point of death
[2:03:24] 30 seconds before they died and recanted
[2:03:29] can you imagine leaving this world and
[2:03:32] the last word
[2:03:33] spoken where i hate
[2:03:36] jesus christ
[2:03:44] god keep me faithful
[2:03:47] god keep me faithful
[2:03:51] if i lose my strength if old age sits in
[2:03:54] and i lose my mind
[2:03:56] i can't remember and i don't know you
[2:04:00] and you and you and you don't let me
[2:04:03] lose my seal
[2:04:05] don't let me lose my birth
[2:04:10] don't you love him children
[2:04:14] hallelujah oh but i take this verse and
[2:04:19] you know it's so sad really when you
[2:04:20] look at it been better for them
[2:04:22] not to have known the way of
[2:04:24] righteousness but that can all be said
[2:04:26] about you
[2:04:28] you see god will never say that about
[2:04:30] you nor will you
[2:04:31] ever say that as i said sunday job curse
[2:04:34] the very day he was born
[2:04:35] nobody that's ever truly born again ever
[2:04:38] curses the day they drew the breath of
[2:04:39] life
[2:04:40] from the breath of god praise be to god
[2:04:45] asparagus together
[2:04:50] blessed lord god
[2:04:54] lord i can't say that i rightly
[2:04:57] understand
[2:04:59] these last couple of wednesday nights
[2:05:04] you're speaking to us in a very serious
[2:05:08] serious tone very somber
[2:05:13] lord god help us if there's one year
[2:05:15] tonight in the visible audience
[2:05:18] or those in the invisible lord
[2:05:21] dear god that needs to move up higher
[2:05:24] a prayer speak to us i don't think
[2:05:28] there's an honest person that would hear
[2:05:29] this
[2:05:30] that cannot say we all need to move up
[2:05:32] closer to you lord
[2:05:35] help us father lord jesus
[2:05:39] help us to be cleansed and things set in
[2:05:42] order
[2:05:44] but lord god we don't want a furnace
[2:05:46] department
[2:05:48] with no cane lord god
[2:05:54] we want it to be furnished
[2:05:57] but we want only one occupant
[2:06:01] to move in and take our presidents
[2:06:05] praise be to god hallelujah hallelujah
[2:06:10] it's the song of solomon we know is
[2:06:13] written in such an intimate way that for
[2:06:16] years the jews would not even allow
[2:06:18] their children to read it
[2:06:20] until they reached a certain age because
[2:06:23] it seems so
[2:06:25] clear and so plain it's baffled
[2:06:28] theologians for years
[2:06:30] but yet lord god we don't look at it in
[2:06:33] a vulgar sense
[2:06:34] but we look at it father as an intimacy
[2:06:37] between
[2:06:38] you and your beloved
[2:06:42] we see it as your love for her and her
[2:06:45] love for you
[2:06:47] the father god we don't read a church
[2:06:50] member we don't read somebody that
[2:06:51] you have to be them to come to church
[2:06:53] and they come every now and then
[2:06:55] we read somebody who's so in love with
[2:06:58] you
[2:07:00] they love you with all their soul
[2:07:03] lord god help us i pray i'm sure each of
[2:07:06] us lord this last year
[2:07:08] it would be honest would say this year
[2:07:11] has taken
[2:07:12] somewhat of a toll on all of us
[2:07:16] for those who've had coveted lord maybe
[2:07:19] still dealing with symptoms
[2:07:21] for those who haven't i pray you'd spare
[2:07:23] them of it
[2:07:25] but lord we've not been able to have
[2:07:26] church like we normally do
[2:07:28] we've not been able to get together and
[2:07:30] fellowship with their friends
[2:07:33] lord it's it's affected us
[2:07:36] i'll be the first one lord god to say to
[2:07:38] you tonight
[2:07:40] along for the day when we can have
[2:07:43] church on wednesday and saturday and
[2:07:45] sunday
[2:07:46] we can get together saints and
[2:07:48] fellowship
[2:07:50] without a mask we can't even hug one
[2:07:53] another's neck
[2:07:55] oh god help us lord jesus may your
[2:07:59] presence i pray
[2:08:01] touch every heart here tonight lord
[2:08:04] father maybe some of them are feeling
[2:08:06] just really
[2:08:10] down and low because the various things
[2:08:13] are going through
[2:08:15] may they feel your great hand just slip
[2:08:17] around them as it were tonight father
[2:08:20] and here you whisper to him i said i'd
[2:08:23] never leave you
[2:08:25] i never forsake you i know you're
[2:08:28] feeling sad and you're disappointed
[2:08:30] this friend has let you down and this
[2:08:33] loved one and this preacher has
[2:08:35] disappointed you
[2:08:37] but you can trust in me oh jesus
[2:08:42] we love you lord we worship you tonight
[2:08:46] blessed god
[2:08:49] thank you lord jesus
[2:08:52] whisper tonight father to the lonely
[2:08:54] hearts the abandoned ones
[2:08:57] to those who are low lord god in the
[2:09:00] name of jesus
[2:09:02] may you who hides in the lattice
[2:09:06] the secret places of the stairs
[2:09:10] may your bride catch a view of your
[2:09:12] countenance
[2:09:13] because we know what to look for to some
[2:09:17] it's shadowy and it's
[2:09:19] parabolic and it's metaphoric and people
[2:09:23] look i don't understand i can't figure
[2:09:24] it out i tried to read the bible i can't
[2:09:26] figure it out
[2:09:26] oh i ain't going to try but the bride
[2:09:29] says no no no
[2:09:31] he wants me to search he wants me to
[2:09:33] look
[2:09:34] i've got to put forth the effort it
[2:09:37] looks like a shadow and then it looks
[2:09:39] unclear but then she begins to look and
[2:09:42] her
[2:09:43] her eyes receives heavenly enlightenment
[2:09:46] then she says oh is that an eye
[2:09:51] is that a nose that's a lock of hair
[2:09:56] that's that's his chin that's his brow
[2:10:00] the more she looks the more she sees
[2:10:05] as you begin to open our eyes lord god
[2:10:08] enlighten us to who you are
[2:10:11] how great you are father
[2:10:15] we worship you tonight lord jesus
[2:10:19] can we just worship him just a little
[2:10:20] saints before we go
[2:10:24] oh praise be to god
[2:10:29] hopefully lord willing we'll be able to
[2:10:32] gather more here on sunday we'll have a
[2:10:35] little bit more normalcy hopefully for a
[2:10:37] while
[2:10:40] but you know if we do or if we don't
[2:10:43] i've come to realize that through this
[2:10:46] covet and through all this that we've
[2:10:48] gone through
[2:10:50] i've not been able to see you all like i
[2:10:52] want to you haven't been able to see me
[2:10:54] i've not been able to hug none of you
[2:10:57] only ones i feel comfortable hugging is
[2:10:59] those got antibodies
[2:11:02] you know what i mean because i don't
[2:11:04] want to pass nothing on to nobody
[2:11:07] and then you hug him and you think oh
[2:11:08] should i do that or not
[2:11:12] but i've come to realize that even
[2:11:14] though i can't hug you
[2:11:16] i can still hug jesus
[2:11:19] and i might feel the distance of you
[2:11:22] folks come in the office for interviews
[2:11:24] and they come in with masks on it i tell
[2:11:26] them
[2:11:26] take it off if you want to for my sake
[2:11:29] why
[2:11:30] why because we we feel so edgy we feel
[2:11:32] so concerned
[2:11:34] don't tell me that don't bother
[2:11:36] spiritually
[2:11:38] but let me bring you into an august
[2:11:40] court tonight
[2:11:42] you can take your mask off lay your
[2:11:46] worries aside
[2:11:48] step up into the place the cherubims
[2:11:50] will move back
[2:11:52] and give you first priority
[2:11:55] into the presence of god you believe
[2:11:58] he's here to minister to you
[2:12:01] praise be to god let's just worship him
[2:12:04] just a little bit now we know there's a
[2:12:05] great divine approach into the presence
[2:12:07] of god
[2:12:08] of prayer but we also know there's
[2:12:12] an approach of praise and worship
[2:12:15] by which we begin to magnify his name
[2:12:18] and just bless his name
[2:12:20] and he pulls us into this place of
[2:12:22] privacy
[2:12:24] and brother branham uses the word august
[2:12:27] courts
[2:12:29] august courts so we don't want the outer
[2:12:32] court
[2:12:33] or the inner court we want the august
[2:12:36] courts
[2:12:37] of his being where it just pulls us
[2:12:39] right in
[2:12:41] brings healing minister strength
[2:12:45] that evil spirit that's tormenting your
[2:12:47] body your mind
[2:12:49] or your soul that will have to leave you
[2:12:54] at the name of jesus
[2:12:59] hallelujah at the name of jesus

[2:13:29] from that oppression brother or sister

[2:14:47] can we take a few moments before we go
[2:14:49] let's just close our eyes now and
[2:14:53] enter into this place that was once
[2:14:55] forbidden
[2:14:56] of the gentiles or satan would have
[2:15:00] loved to stop the gospel
[2:15:02] he tried to anoint them jews the most
[2:15:04] religious people of that day
[2:15:07] to stop the light from reaching the
[2:15:09] gentiles
[2:15:10] but god had them ordained to eternal
[2:15:12] life
[2:15:13] and god was able to get his word to him
[2:15:16] your mother your father your aunts your
[2:15:19] uncles
[2:15:20] your former pastor many of them tried
[2:15:23] their very best to keep you from getting
[2:15:26] this word
[2:15:27] but god went around them god went above
[2:15:30] them god went under them
[2:15:31] god bypassed them and got this word to
[2:15:34] your heart
[2:15:35] and birthed you and he didn't birth you
[2:15:38] to lose you
[2:15:42] remember satan may think he's got our
[2:15:44] nation he may think he's got our world
[2:15:47] he may think the left has taken over the
[2:15:49] social media the left is taking over
[2:15:51] this
[2:15:52] and taking over that but i want to
[2:15:53] remind him tonight
[2:15:55] they ain't got the throne room they
[2:15:57] ain't got the kingdom of god in the
[2:15:59] hearts of the saints of god
[2:16:01] they don't have the kingdom of heaven
[2:16:04] hallelujah what belongs to heaven still
[2:16:06] belongs to heaven
[2:16:08] what belongs to heaven pre-election
[2:16:10] still belongs to heaven
[2:16:12] here we are in january what belonged to
[2:16:15] heaven oh my
[2:16:16] about before the foundation of the world
[2:16:19] still belongs to heaven tonight here we
[2:16:21] are
[2:16:22] 20 21 and jesus has not
[2:16:25] lost to one let me serve notice on hell
[2:16:29] tonight you'll never get the throne room
[2:16:32] you'll never get one heart of one saint
[2:16:35] of god
[2:16:36] oh you've got the earth and look what
[2:16:38] you've turned it into you've got hell
[2:16:41] and look what you've turned it into but
[2:16:43] let me tell you about a place that's off
[2:16:45] limits to you satan you have never
[2:16:48] stepped your
[2:16:49] foot inside that new city
[2:16:53] or you've been allowed to tread upon
[2:16:55] that original place called heaven
[2:16:58] you've been around allowed to go into
[2:17:00] where the throne room is now
[2:17:02] but you have never been allowed to set
[2:17:05] one foot
[2:17:06] inside those pearly gates because it is
[2:17:10] a city
[2:17:11] of the redeemed not one demon
[2:17:14] has ever stuck its foot in the river of
[2:17:17] life not one power out of hell
[2:17:21] has ever stuck one eyeball or stuck his
[2:17:24] head
[2:17:25] inside the gates of that city because
[2:17:28] it's created for the heavenly bridegroom
[2:17:31] and his earthly bride it is our city it
[2:17:35] is
[2:17:36] our home that's how confident our master
[2:17:39] is
[2:17:40] that there is a bride on the on the
[2:17:42] earth
[2:17:43] that is his he's so confident
[2:17:46] he's gone away to prepare a place for us
[2:17:49] not only that
[2:17:50] he's already got the gates hung the
[2:17:53] gigantic hinges have
[2:17:54] received the gates of pearl it's already
[2:17:58] there waiting
[2:17:59] the angels are there waiting for the
[2:18:02] saints of god
[2:18:04] to throne the beautiful streets of that
[2:18:07] city
[2:18:09] praise be to god
[2:18:12] oh praise be to god
[2:18:16] we worship you jesus we worship you
[2:18:20] jesus

[2:18:24] him aren't you glad tonight
[2:18:26] to be a son or daughter of god you may
[2:18:29] be so
[2:18:29] poor that you ain't got enough money in
[2:18:31] your pocket to stop by the drive-through
[2:18:34] and get you a soft drink or a hamburger
[2:18:37] but if your name
[2:18:39] is found there declared by the lamb of
[2:18:41] god your name
[2:18:42] spoken before the foundation of the
[2:18:44] world you are one of the richest
[2:18:46] people that has ever drawn breasts on
[2:18:49] this earth

[2:19:01] difficult for brother daryl been
[2:19:02] not been able to go out on the field and
[2:19:04] evangelize and all but
[2:19:06] i've so enjoyed brother darrell been
[2:19:08] able to be with us haven't you
[2:19:10] been able to pray for us preach for us
[2:19:12] pray with us
[2:19:15] so glad to have a man like him amen amen
[2:19:23] antibodies
[2:19:26] praise the lord
[2:19:31] isn't the word so precious friends and
[2:19:34] you can see the the reality of where
[2:19:37] we're at in time
[2:19:38] and the pattern of the word and it's
[2:19:41] just going home time friends and the
[2:19:43] things that we're seeing taking place
[2:19:44] and
[2:19:47] i went down this afternoon to feed my
[2:19:50] horse
[2:19:52] standing down there by the gate and
[2:19:55] while standing there begin to think
[2:19:57] about moses and
[2:19:58] children of old and how they'd come down
[2:20:01] to the red sea
[2:20:03] i just got to thinking about what a
[2:20:04] troublesome time that that was that
[2:20:07] the sea was in front of them and here
[2:20:08] come pharaoh and
[2:20:10] this eventual army behind them to
[2:20:12] destroy them and
[2:20:14] not knowing exactly what was going to
[2:20:15] take place they they'd come out of
[2:20:17] something they was following the message
[2:20:19] but now
[2:20:19] there was this ocean in front of them
[2:20:21] and
[2:20:22] while standing there i just saw moses
