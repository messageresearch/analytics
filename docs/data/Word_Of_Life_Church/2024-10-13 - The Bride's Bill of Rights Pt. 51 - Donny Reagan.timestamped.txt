[49:59] today it's a great privilege for us to
[50:01] be gathered together again in the house
[50:03] of
[50:04] God um before we read the word I wanted
[50:07] to
[50:08] say again how much I appreciate all the
[50:11] work and all the effort that everybody's
[50:13] doing in our uh flood relief I'd asked
[50:16] brother Michael earlier this morning
[50:18] before we came to church kind of give me
[50:20] a list of states that he was aware of
[50:24] that people have been sending help from
[50:27] just so everybody will know it would be
[50:29] totally impossible for us to do what has
[50:33] been done so you listen to the list
[50:36] Virginia West Virginia Pennsylvania
[50:40] Georgia Arkansas Kentucky North Carolina
[50:45] Louisiana Oklahoma
[50:48] Arizona and all over the United States
[50:52] of people sending Amazon
[50:54] packages so nered daily sometimes more
[50:57] than one trip a day Amazon is coming and
[51:01] dropping stuff
[51:03] off it gives you hope for
[51:06] Humanity you know you thank God is there
[51:09] anybody left that even loves that even
[51:11] cares for people but there really are
[51:14] there really are I want to say to U all
[51:18] of those of our church that have done
[51:21] all that they're doing daily how much we
[51:23] appreciate it so very much with that
[51:26] being said said a lot of the places
[51:27] where we're taking the stuff that we
[51:29] found so far um we're probably going to
[51:32] slow down to maybe two days a week as
[51:35] far as being able to make the deliveries
[51:36] so brother Michael want me to announce
[51:39] that to you that they will be posting it
[51:41] on Facebook when volunteers can come
[51:45] over and and help them sort through it
[51:48] all and um we so appreciate every hour
[51:52] that you're spending and giving of your
[51:54] time some of our brothers have t taken
[51:56] off work uh to be able to do this our
[52:00] sisters have come brought their children
[52:02] sitting over there in the cafeteria and
[52:04] it's just been it's been wonderful and I
[52:06] want you to know I appreciate it I took
[52:07] her of the I said you know I think it's
[52:09] good myself that I enjoy seeing our
[52:11] youth also coming and helping we need as
[52:16] as the people of God to realize our life
[52:19] is not our own a person that lives a
[52:22] life to themsel lives a very selfish
[52:25] life aelf self-centered life after all
[52:27] eternal life is living for others and
[52:31] doing for others and most of this that
[52:33] we are doing we will never see these
[52:36] people that we're doing it for but we
[52:39] don't have to that's not the reason
[52:41] we're doing it in the first place now
[52:43] myself and the brothers has been able to
[52:44] make some of these deliveries we're
[52:46] seeing the people and some of them we've
[52:48] seen some of them we've been able to see
[52:50] as they come and get food and come and
[52:52] get generators and gasoline and so on
[52:54] and so on but a lot of them that's
[52:56] getting it we will never see and we're
[52:59] not doing it for that anyway we're doing
[53:01] it to help and once again I want to say
[53:04] how appreciative I am for the facility
[53:07] that the Lord has given us to where we
[53:08] can be able to do all that from our
[53:10] place over here can you imagine trying
[53:12] to do this from our old church I told
[53:15] some of the people the other day in
[53:17] North Carolina that they would have
[53:19] died literally died had they been
[53:23] waiting for the federal government to
[53:24] get to them cuz some of the places were
[53:26] going to the federal government still
[53:29] hasn't showed up so they're backs in the
[53:32] hollers and the sticks and all that sort
[53:35] of thing and I told Brother Daryl a
[53:36] while ago I guess one reason that means
[53:38] something special to us going to those
[53:41] places is that's where he found us he
[53:45] didn't find us in the big halls or the
[53:47] great big Cathedrals but he found some
[53:49] of us on bar stools and some of us was
[53:52] in the offest shape that ever was but he
[53:55] and his Mercy aren't you glad glad he's
[53:56] that kind of a
[53:58] God so we're that kind of people so
[54:01] again I can't say enough and I I just
[54:03] want you to know Carol and myself were
[54:05] so proud of each of you of what you're
[54:08] doing some have given time lots have
[54:11] given money there's been thousands and
[54:13] thousands of dollars that's come from
[54:15] businesses and just all kinds of of
[54:17] people that's doing that and we say to
[54:20] them they probably never come to church
[54:21] here never hear me say it but I I would
[54:24] like to acknowledge that as well I want
[54:26] to thanked them for doing it many of the
[54:28] things that's been given have been given
[54:29] because of people here in the church as
[54:31] their business associates and they
[54:33] basically trust them so we want to be
[54:36] able to handle it in of course in such a
[54:38] way that'll please the Lord one day when
[54:40] we all stand before him according to the
[54:43] Bible there is a book I know the name of
[54:47] it it's called The Book of
[54:51] remembrance so everything we do not just
[54:54] in time of flood but everything we do to
[54:56] help anyone the Lord Jesus keeps a
[55:01] record so when these people finally get
[55:04] are able to Res resolve many of their
[55:06] problems and get to a stage of normaly
[55:09] whatever that will be for some of them
[55:11] who's lost absolutely everything and our
[55:14] church will get out of this mode of
[55:16] doing this I'd say we don't stop all the
[55:19] good works I'd say we don't stop being
[55:22] kind as a matter of fact for most of us
[55:24] we didn't just start doing it we've just
[55:26] just never quite done it in this scope
[55:28] before don't you love the Lord for
[55:30] giving us the
[55:32] opportunity to not be able to go around
[55:34] the world you see because I'm the type
[55:36] of person that I am a quiet individual I
[55:38] don't let people know what we're doing
[55:40] people look at our church they wow you
[55:43] know that big church big this big that
[55:46] they're so selfish they don't do this
[55:48] well people don't have a clue but for
[55:51] one time people can be able to look and
[55:53] see oh they're reaching out to the local
[55:55] community they're they're doing
[55:57] something that's just the first time
[55:59] they've saw it in a scope or they can
[56:01] see it but I think there's a reason in
[56:03] all that so I appreciate each one of you
[56:07] everybody understand me every one of you
[56:10] men women boys girls the sisters some
[56:14] grandmothers just coming watching their
[56:16] kids while their their children can be
[56:18] able to help about we just want you to
[56:20] know we're grateful and there's been
[56:22] people of the community or friends of
[56:24] the people that don't even come to
[56:25] church here that want to come in and
[56:26] help so if you find somebody that's not
[56:29] quite dressed up to par you know what's
[56:31] going on but they want to help you know
[56:33] what if they want to help I'm going to
[56:35] let them come and help cuz who knows it
[56:37] might get around us woo something might
[56:40] change their
[56:44] lives praise the Lord let's turn the
[56:47] scripture today in the book of
[56:50] fimon one the smallest books of the New
[56:52] Testament but filled with all types of
[56:55] wonderful nuggets
[56:57] from the word of God we've been speaking
[56:59] about the brides Bill of Rights and
[57:02] today I want to speak to you about the
[57:03] right to a position in Christ the right
[57:09] to a
[57:10] position in Christ fimon just of course
[57:14] the chapter 1 verse 5 hearing of thy
[57:19] love and faith which thou Hast toward
[57:24] the lord Jesus
[57:26] and toward All
[57:28] Saints you see people think they can
[57:30] love God with all their heart and not
[57:32] really love his children that's totally
[57:37] impossible if you love the Lord Jesus
[57:39] right you will love all of his children
[57:42] even those you don't agree with even
[57:45] those that you may not humanly ever have
[57:48] that contact and be close friends with
[57:50] them there's people like that and they
[57:52] may feel the same way about you but you
[57:54] still love them you may not like their
[57:56] ways and like certain things about them
[57:58] that's not even the same thing now look
[58:01] at this verse
[58:02] six that the
[58:05] communication of thy faith
[58:09] communication how in the world do you
[58:12] communicate
[58:14] faith that the
[58:17] communication and the word that Paul
[58:19] uses here is is
[58:21] coia so it's fellowship and being able
[58:25] to ajoin
[58:27] yourself that the
[58:30] communication of thy face may become or
[58:35] come to
[58:36] pass and be
[58:39] effectual that the communication so your
[58:42] your Fai is talking your faith is
[58:48] expressing
[58:49] itself how does faith talk how does
[58:53] faith
[58:55] communicate now what she says that the
[58:57] communication of thy faith may become
[59:01] effectual so a person can have faith in
[59:04] God and an element of his word and
[59:06] believe it's a truth and yet it needs to
[59:09] rise to another level to where the
[59:13] communication of their faith will
[59:16] become so it's not like the
[59:18] communication of your faith initially
[59:21] receives the full impact of all it can
[59:23] be but God gives to every one of of us a
[59:26] Measure of Faith then as we grow that
[59:29] measure can grow with us we will be able
[59:32] to endure more be able to accomplish
[59:34] more and it can also become effectual
[59:38] look at the word here that he used
[59:40] energus which of course you're familiar
[59:42] with the word energy
[59:44] powerful active so the communication of
[59:48] your faith may become
[59:51] powerful and active how just by hearing
[59:55] the word
[59:58] no just by going to church
[1:00:01] no just by doing good deeds
[1:00:05] no by the
[1:00:09] acknowledging of every good thing which
[1:00:12] is in
[1:00:14] you in Christ
[1:00:17] Jesus so you mean that makes our faith
[1:00:21] more active more powerful more energous
[1:00:26] has more energy to it I love this word
[1:00:29] acknowledging you know I'm a meaning guy
[1:00:31] and I look I like to look up the
[1:00:33] meanings of these words eposis we've
[1:00:36] looked at it before
[1:00:39] precise and
[1:00:41] correct
[1:00:42] knowledge used of the knowledge of
[1:00:46] things
[1:00:47] ethical and
[1:00:50] divine so this is how that our faith
[1:00:53] becomes more effectual by the
[1:00:56] acknowledging precise knowledge by
[1:01:00] acknowledging not every good thing
[1:01:02] that's in our
[1:01:03] flesh and believe me most of us are
[1:01:05] professionals at doing that but that's
[1:01:09] actually not what makes our faith
[1:01:10] effectual it's by acknowledging with a
[1:01:13] precise knowledge of what we are in
[1:01:16] Christ Jesus of every good thing which
[1:01:19] is in you in Christ Jesus Philippians
[1:01:23] 4:8 finally bre
[1:01:26] Brethren whatsoever things are
[1:01:30] true now in order not to take up too
[1:01:33] much time today yesterday when I was
[1:01:35] studying I took every one of these words
[1:01:39] and looked up the meaning of them and I
[1:01:42] don't have some type of special
[1:01:43] concordance and some type of special
[1:01:45] bible program all you got to do is go to
[1:01:48] the Lexicon or the strong concordance
[1:01:50] you don't have one you can do it online
[1:01:53] and you click on every one of these
[1:01:54] words it'll change your life finally
[1:01:58] Brethren whatsoever things are
[1:02:02] true whatsoever things are
[1:02:05] honest whatsoever things are
[1:02:09] just whatsoever things are
[1:02:13] pure whatsoever things are
[1:02:17] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[1:02:22] report if there be any virtue
[1:02:26] if there be
[1:02:27] any
[1:02:29] praise
[1:02:31] think on these
[1:02:35] things well I can say amen and we can go
[1:02:40] home if we could get what I've read
[1:02:42] already this morning will be changed
[1:02:44] towards the
[1:02:46] world can I give you the meaning of one
[1:02:48] more
[1:02:49] word think on these things I may not say
[1:02:53] this correctly it's a qu a long long
[1:02:56] word longed
[1:02:58] zi to take into
[1:03:03] account to make an account
[1:03:08] of now probably most of you here today
[1:03:11] have a pretty good idea of how much is
[1:03:13] in your checking account or if you've
[1:03:15] got a savings account pretty much how
[1:03:17] much is in there you know how many
[1:03:19] outstanding checks that you may have and
[1:03:21] so on so you're not going to write a
[1:03:24] check for a million dollars if you ain't
[1:03:26] got but 75 cents in the bank because
[1:03:28] I'll be coming ministering to you in the
[1:03:30] jail if you
[1:03:32] do now this is what people you laugh at
[1:03:35] that but this is what a lot of times
[1:03:36] people do
[1:03:38] spiritually whenever they think above
[1:03:42] them what they really
[1:03:44] are so they think they have all this in
[1:03:48] their
[1:03:49] account of what they can do who they are
[1:03:52] so on and so on and so on but the word
[1:03:54] that Paul uses is absolutely phenomenal
[1:03:58] read me me hear the meaning of this this
[1:03:59] word deals with
[1:04:02] reality if I log isi or reckon that my
[1:04:07] bank book has $25 in
[1:04:10] it it has
[1:04:12] $25 in it otherwise I am deceiving
[1:04:18] myself this word refers to facts not
[1:04:24] supposition
[1:04:26] so then a person with honesty with
[1:04:28] loyalty with truth with all the great
[1:04:31] things that we read there then think
[1:04:34] think on these things so you look at
[1:04:37] yourself and say am I truly honest am I
[1:04:41] honest with God am I honest with my wife
[1:04:43] my husband my brothers my pastor my
[1:04:46] church am I loyal am I Royal am I true
[1:04:49] am I faithful and then you can think on
[1:04:52] that and then you look at the account in
[1:04:54] your life
[1:04:56] and you say yeah I think I've got $25
[1:04:59] worth of honesty yep there it is on my
[1:05:02] account I've got
[1:05:03] $25 so we think on what is factual
[1:05:09] according to where we
[1:05:10] are and the church said
[1:05:14] amen let's bow our heads
[1:05:17] together Lord Jesus thank you so much
[1:05:20] for your word
[1:05:21] today I pray father you would help me to
[1:05:24] be able to get out of the way Lord I
[1:05:27] know it's a miracle every time that
[1:05:29] you're able to get a human being into
[1:05:31] your hands if it's for five minutes or
[1:05:34] an
[1:05:35] hour and they can be able to speak words
[1:05:38] that have value of eternal
[1:05:40] life because we as Mortals cannot do
[1:05:43] that so once again I'm asking for a
[1:05:46] supernatural event to take place in this
[1:05:50] service
[1:05:51] today that you would anoint that part of
[1:05:54] yourself and my life
[1:05:56] which is a gift help me Lord that I can
[1:05:59] step aside I pray also for my brothers
[1:06:03] and sisters that you would anoint them
[1:06:06] that they would be able to lay aside
[1:06:08] their duties of the day and whatever
[1:06:10] they're going through their anxieties
[1:06:12] frustrations of life that they may be
[1:06:15] able to tap into the anointing and grab
[1:06:18] a hold of what you're saying Lord in
[1:06:20] this hour that we live we will be
[1:06:22] blessed and helped father I also pray
[1:06:25] over this prayer cloth laying before me
[1:06:28] Lord you see this need of this
[1:06:31] individual dear God
[1:06:34] they they need your help
[1:06:37] Lord they realize
[1:06:40] without without Supernatural
[1:06:44] intervention they will die not
[1:06:47] live and they're fearing
[1:06:49] death dear God I pray in the name of
[1:06:52] Jesus you would move on their hearts
[1:06:55] father
[1:06:56] may they come to a saving knowledge they
[1:06:59] requested a prayer call Father May the
[1:07:02] Holy Ghost go to them today I pray we
[1:07:05] commit the word the people the speaker
[1:07:09] and the hearer into your care in Jesus
[1:07:11] name amen God bless you you may be
[1:07:14] seated
[1:07:26] things that are to be the word made
[1:07:28] flesh therefore you walked with
[1:07:31] him when you were in him when he was on
[1:07:35] Earth you
[1:07:37] suffered with him you
[1:07:41] died with
[1:07:43] him and you are risen with
[1:07:46] him manifested attributes of God setting
[1:07:51] in Heavenly places already raised
[1:07:56] resurrected to New Life setting in
[1:07:59] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I read
[1:08:03] all that to get to this all that means
[1:08:07] so much nowadays
[1:08:11] church that means so much to
[1:08:14] us to see our
[1:08:18] self positionally
[1:08:20] placed in Jesus
[1:08:24] Christ so if we have been given the
[1:08:26] right to have a position in Christ
[1:08:31] Jesus no doubt it will be one of the
[1:08:33] greatest battles of our life to be able
[1:08:37] to get to that spot and then after we
[1:08:40] are there to be able to maintain it like
[1:08:44] the children of Israel the historian
[1:08:46] Usher says the book of of Joshua covers
[1:08:50] a span of about 26 years so they start
[1:08:54] in the South SL when they cross the
[1:08:56] Jordan and they start moving they're
[1:08:58] moving northward moving northward as
[1:09:00] they do they're conquering cities
[1:09:02] they're taking kingdoms they're
[1:09:05] defeating Kings they leave an element of
[1:09:08] people behind them so the enemy won't
[1:09:11] rout around behind them and regain what
[1:09:14] they took away from them eventually they
[1:09:17] go to the north up toward the Galilee up
[1:09:20] to the Northern Heights that the where
[1:09:23] close to Syria is now
[1:09:25] and they finally conquer the land now
[1:09:28] the fighting men are able to go back if
[1:09:30] their inheritance was down in the South
[1:09:32] close to Hebron they would go back down
[1:09:35] there if it was in Ephraim they'd go
[1:09:36] there manessa Jerusalem wherever they
[1:09:38] were and whenever they come back now
[1:09:41] they have to change their mentality
[1:09:43] they're not fighting to get the land
[1:09:46] they're no longer running into these
[1:09:48] masses of Philistines and great Giants
[1:09:52] and all that by the grace of God they've
[1:09:54] been able to defeat the masses of them
[1:09:57] but what they've got is little tiny
[1:09:59] pockets of these people that are still
[1:10:02] hid little tiny Pockets here and there
[1:10:06] and there and it was I'm I'm thinking
[1:10:09] Joseph that the tribe of Joseph that
[1:10:11] they they begin to let this certain
[1:10:14] element of people live and they no
[1:10:17] longer started killing them well once it
[1:10:19] started with them it went from there to
[1:10:22] Dan from Dan to naftali from naftali to
[1:10:25] Reuben and it was like a move that
[1:10:28] started moving in the message of that
[1:10:30] day so instead of slaying the enemy they
[1:10:34] start letting the enemy live so they're
[1:10:36] living here they're living there they're
[1:10:38] living there and the next thing you know
[1:10:40] then these Jewish men are marrying these
[1:10:44] women which according to the law they
[1:10:46] were forbidden to do but now it enters
[1:10:48] into the element of compromise and God
[1:10:52] said because you have done this I will
[1:10:55] leave them here and I will make them to
[1:10:57] be a thorn in your side now that's a
[1:11:01] terrible thing because it was not the
[1:11:02] will of God but it was the people that
[1:11:05] did that because maybe they figured they
[1:11:08] had more Love by letting the enemy live
[1:11:11] remember God is not a cruel God he was
[1:11:14] not telling them to kill the amorites
[1:11:16] jebusites Hittites Philistines and so on
[1:11:19] and so on even their children because
[1:11:22] God is mean and cruel but he knew a baby
[1:11:26] amalekite grows up to be an adult
[1:11:29] amalaki if you'll remember that when you
[1:11:32] go to letting in little sins and little
[1:11:35] bitty things that start out as a little
[1:11:37] tiny baby in your life in your home
[1:11:40] remember that little tiny sin many times
[1:11:43] grows up to become a
[1:11:46] giant how many knows it's a truth from
[1:11:49] your own life so then they have to
[1:11:51] change their sinking now they're
[1:11:53] entering into spot that they're not
[1:11:56] trying to get more no more property no
[1:11:58] more boundaries although they never got
[1:12:00] exactly all the property that God told
[1:12:02] them but they change their mentality so
[1:12:05] they're fighting to keep what they've
[1:12:07] got well it's the same with us we're out
[1:12:09] there in the world we're lost decrepit
[1:12:11] blind we don't know anything about God
[1:12:13] God gets a hold of us saves us
[1:12:14] sanctifies us and calls us into his body
[1:12:17] then we find a church hopefully we get
[1:12:19] into that part of of a Ministry and we
[1:12:21] go to finding our slot where God wants
[1:12:24] us to be then why happens the battle
[1:12:26] changes many of you years ago you
[1:12:28] battled and struggled so hard with this
[1:12:31] Habit in your life and that habit you
[1:12:33] said Lord I'll never get over this but
[1:12:35] by the grace of God you can look back
[1:12:37] today and say praise God I'm delivered
[1:12:39] of that and yet God in a mighty way
[1:12:42] delivered you well that don't bother me
[1:12:44] no more and that don't bother me no more
[1:12:46] but don't think because you're free from
[1:12:48] those things Satan stops he simply comes
[1:12:51] in another way sometimes even with some
[1:12:53] of those things same things to trying to
[1:12:55] pull you out now of your new inheritance
[1:12:59] which you've received now it is a
[1:13:01] spiritual inheritance in that it is a
[1:13:04] new birth a quick and Seed Gene by the
[1:13:08] presence of God something you never had
[1:13:10] before something you never even knew was
[1:13:11] there so it becomes quickened by the
[1:13:14] Breath of God then maybe God gives you a
[1:13:16] wife if you're a man God gives you
[1:13:18] children so your inheritance is
[1:13:20] expanding those children grow up now
[1:13:22] it's a whole lot easier when they're
[1:13:24] three or four or five years old now son
[1:13:26] don't you do that don't you do that I'll
[1:13:28] smack you if you do boy I'm telling you
[1:13:30] one thing but when you deal with that
[1:13:32] boy whenever he's 18 or 20 it's a lot
[1:13:34] different than when he's five is that
[1:13:36] right so what are you doing your
[1:13:38] inheritance is expanding and it takes
[1:13:41] the spirit of God for us as parents to
[1:13:43] know how to be able to deal with them
[1:13:45] whenever they get older but what are you
[1:13:48] doing you're still trying to keep
[1:13:50] everything that God has given you and it
[1:13:53] will be a battle from the time that
[1:13:55] you're born again until you leave this
[1:13:58] world either by the way of the Grave or
[1:14:01] by a body change now perfect Fai in our
[1:14:04] position enables us to be able to see
[1:14:08] where we are then we can take what what
[1:14:10] God had Paul to write here in the book
[1:14:13] of fimon and a the people of God to see
[1:14:16] and know by the account that they take
[1:14:19] of themselves do y'all do that to
[1:14:21] yourself all the time do you ever you
[1:14:23] know like you balance your checkbook and
[1:14:26] whether you've got it online and you can
[1:14:28] pull up your account and you know show
[1:14:29] your face or whatever and open it up you
[1:14:31] can see the outstanding accounts or if
[1:14:33] you still get them in the mail and you
[1:14:35] do that why so that you'll know where
[1:14:37] you are just know where you are so you
[1:14:39] got this working balance or you ain't
[1:14:41] got that working balance and you're
[1:14:43] trying to figure out what's going on we
[1:14:45] ought to do the same thing spiritually
[1:14:48] okay I'm a Child of God I'm a word
[1:14:50] believer I believe this I believe that I
[1:14:52] believe that that's only the as aspect
[1:14:55] of your account that you're showing on
[1:14:58] your paper form as we would say but
[1:15:01] you've always got on the other side it's
[1:15:03] amazing that when we write those checks
[1:15:05] that the bank actually takes that out of
[1:15:08] our account wow why do they do that life
[1:15:11] would be so much more funner if they
[1:15:13] wouldn't right if they would just say
[1:15:15] okay well we're going to do you this
[1:15:16] favor for the whole year whenever these
[1:15:19] checks come through we're not going to
[1:15:20] take it from your account we're actually
[1:15:22] going to pay it for you wow let me know
[1:15:24] where you Bank okay but they're not
[1:15:26] going to do that and it's the same way
[1:15:28] with trials and tests and sometimes
[1:15:31] differences that come between us God
[1:15:33] saying oh Lord I love my brothers that's
[1:15:35] what the word tells me to do Lord I do I
[1:15:37] love my brothers and then God will force
[1:15:40] you to write a check on brotherly love
[1:15:42] and brotherly love will run through the
[1:15:44] account and boy the spirit of God knows
[1:15:46] what he's going to do and he's going to
[1:15:48] come up and I don't mind telling you
[1:15:50] there's many times we find our check
[1:15:52] bouncing on brotherly love I've never
[1:15:55] had any to bounce on those that get
[1:15:56] along with me of you oh my goodness
[1:15:59] those Little Darlings that think the sun
[1:16:01] rose and set in me I got plenty of money
[1:16:04] in my account to take care of them
[1:16:06] saints it's them ones that don't like me
[1:16:09] it's them ones that don't care for me
[1:16:11] now I use myself as a big example I got
[1:16:13] broad shoulders I'm a little man but I
[1:16:15] got broad shoulders if I do this to some
[1:16:17] of you it hurts your feelings but
[1:16:19] sometimes I get tried and I really have
[1:16:22] to struggle to love folks that don't
[1:16:25] like me oh Lord brother Donnie not you
[1:16:27] just like the rest of all you rotten low
[1:16:30] down mortal sitting you're hearing me
[1:16:31] today and what happens it's my check
[1:16:34] runs through the bank and I get a you
[1:16:36] know it's flagged and I get an
[1:16:38] acknowledgement as it was I can say on
[1:16:40] my phone in an app that you're
[1:16:43] overdown we're going to charge you $35
[1:16:46] or whatever your bank personally charge
[1:16:48] it because you don't have the money to
[1:16:50] cover that well how in the world is that
[1:16:52] I'm a Christian I love the Lord I
[1:16:54] believe the Lord but you've not been
[1:16:56] monitoring your account properly you see
[1:16:59] you don't have the right amount of
[1:17:01] forgiveness that you need for others and
[1:17:03] you're holding grudges and you're not
[1:17:05] able to override this and override that
[1:17:08] and it'll always be those that God knows
[1:17:11] you struggle with are the ones that push
[1:17:14] your buttons and you saying how do they
[1:17:17] know me that well how do they know me to
[1:17:21] push the combinations of my a and Y and
[1:17:25] c and Z buttons and that brings me to
[1:17:28] the peak not of explosion in the Holy
[1:17:31] Ghost but in your
[1:17:34] Humanity cuz God wants you to check your
[1:17:40] account and the church
[1:17:43] said now watch if we then would be able
[1:17:46] to walk every day of our life constantly
[1:17:49] checking our accounts monitoring where
[1:17:51] we are God help me if I'm short in any
[1:17:54] Avenue please help me Lord that if
[1:17:56] there's if there's a check that runs
[1:17:58] through that it don't come up and fles
[1:18:00] that I'm short on what needs to happen
[1:18:03] now when the Lord Jesus come to the
[1:18:05] Earth we know we preached on this for
[1:18:06] years and years that he so condescended
[1:18:09] to our level that he laid aside this
[1:18:12] this stupendous Glory that was there and
[1:18:14] he become one of us and he laid aside
[1:18:17] all his robes and his dim and everything
[1:18:20] that was there and stepped into a body
[1:18:22] of Flesh and become a human being that
[1:18:25] he might be able to feel the way we feel
[1:18:28] so no doubt the Lord Jesus there was
[1:18:30] people that he really really could feel
[1:18:34] close to we know there's even certain
[1:18:35] disciples he was closer to than others
[1:18:38] and yet no doubt there was also people
[1:18:40] that he just you know he grieved and he
[1:18:42] sigh the scripture tells us that he did
[1:18:45] and he was a Man of Sorrows acquainted
[1:18:47] with grief and tipped it in all points
[1:18:49] like as we are so the Lord Jesus must
[1:18:52] have as a human become frustrated
[1:18:55] sometimes with the people that he loved
[1:18:57] the most and those that said they loved
[1:19:00] him the most and said they understood
[1:19:02] him and believing you imagine James and
[1:19:04] John when they come to him and they want
[1:19:06] a great exalted position and how Jesus
[1:19:09] reprimands them and he uses this
[1:19:11] instance in a way I'd imagine old James
[1:19:14] and John their face got as red as blood
[1:19:16] because they felt like that Jesus was
[1:19:18] publicly humiliating them and to be
[1:19:21] honest with you they needed it because
[1:19:23] they wanted themselves they thought
[1:19:25] themselves Superior over the rest of the
[1:19:27] brothers I hope you understand we still
[1:19:28] got a few jameses and John's around the
[1:19:31] message but the key about James and John
[1:19:33] at that time was they didn't have the
[1:19:35] Holy Ghost we never find James and John
[1:19:38] ever doing that again and the church
[1:19:42] said so you see without the Holy Ghost
[1:19:45] and our soul we will never have the
[1:19:47] proper Measure of Faith to be able to
[1:19:50] communicate the faith that we have to
[1:19:53] give us confidence in our position now
[1:19:55] whether or not you understand this the
[1:19:57] Lord Jesus even though he was the word
[1:20:00] and the fullness thereof made flesh he
[1:20:04] condescended Beyond a spot even though
[1:20:07] he knew he
[1:20:10] pre-existed now pre Jesus stage he was
[1:20:15] Christ
[1:20:17] listen pre human body stage he was
[1:20:23] Christos logos
[1:20:25] thought fullness of God attributes of
[1:20:30] everything God was pre Jesus now
[1:20:33] remember Jesus was not existing in the
[1:20:37] Old Testament what is Jesus human body
[1:20:40] of redemption but it was Christ the
[1:20:43] Bible does not say Moses chose to suffer
[1:20:46] the reproach of Jesus but the reproach
[1:20:49] of Christ what is Christ the anointed
[1:20:53] one the anointed Ed word so he must
[1:20:57] condens sin then when he becomes Jesus
[1:21:00] to a place that he's not living
[1:21:03] operating thinking overcoming doing all
[1:21:06] that with the fullness of Christos in
[1:21:09] his soul because how can you and I be
[1:21:12] compared to him so if we would be
[1:21:15] compared to him him was all of that
[1:21:17] great power and that's the way he
[1:21:19] overcome and then he' turn and tell us
[1:21:22] be of good Comfort I've overcome the
[1:21:23] world you said well sure you could
[1:21:25] because you've got the fullness of God
[1:21:27] in you well and yet that gives you a
[1:21:29] great Advantage but he overcome as a man
[1:21:33] with the Holy Ghost he did not overcome
[1:21:37] The Temptations of Matthew 4 as God he
[1:21:41] did not die on the cross as
[1:21:46] God but as a
[1:21:48] man so Jesus himself actually allowed
[1:21:53] himself to to be deprived of the
[1:21:57] dependency to depend on and overcome by
[1:22:01] this preexistence thought of Christ so
[1:22:06] he overcomes as Jesus filled with the
[1:22:10] Holy
[1:22:11] Ghost now in order to accomplish this
[1:22:14] you say why in the world would he do
[1:22:15] that so he could come back to the state
[1:22:21] of perfect faith in who he was
[1:22:25] now remember he was not born of the
[1:22:28] Virgin with that state remember they
[1:22:32] they they never called him Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ at his
[1:22:37] birth but Thou shalt call his
[1:22:41] name why he was not Christos at his
[1:22:45] birth that did not happen to 30 years
[1:22:48] later then the father come in Him Praise
[1:22:52] the Lord now then becomes Jesus Christ
[1:22:56] as a matter of fact you'll never even
[1:22:57] find him being referred to in the four
[1:22:59] gospels as the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:23:01] never gained that title till after the
[1:23:03] resurrection Lord father Jesus man
[1:23:07] Christ Christo anointed word so he
[1:23:10] allows himself to be on this Earth for
[1:23:14] this period of time and he actually
[1:23:17] steps apart from these great attributes
[1:23:22] and he allows himself to be grown into a
[1:23:27] measure of perfect
[1:23:30] Faith so it's not like that he looked at
[1:23:33] it and said oh I know who I am I know
[1:23:35] everything about me I know all my trials
[1:23:37] are over I know all my tests is over I
[1:23:40] knew I pre-existed I knew I was the word
[1:23:43] I am the one who created all things all
[1:23:46] things were made by me and for me and
[1:23:49] without anything made that was made but
[1:23:51] he actually stepped back from that him
[1:23:55] himself and allowed himself to grow Luke
[1:24:01] 2:52 he grew in wisdom and understanding
[1:24:05] before God and
[1:24:10] man so the Lord Jesus would have to read
[1:24:14] the
[1:24:18] word and whenever he read the word about
[1:24:22] scriptures pertaining to
[1:24:25] himself and actually gave him
[1:24:30] face wow yes sir the very author of
[1:24:34] Faith
[1:24:36] himself had to
[1:24:38] grow in
[1:24:41] faith notice this oh my I love this
[1:24:45] perfect faith that he was the anointed
[1:24:49] Messiah that the spirit of God was upon
[1:24:52] him and he said now and my
[1:24:55] I can do
[1:24:56] nothing I can do nothing but it's my
[1:24:59] facei in God and God was in him and the
[1:25:04] word made manifest and when the word of
[1:25:06] God comes in
[1:25:08] you amen it's made manifest for you are
[1:25:12] a Believer listen this this is why I do
[1:25:17] not believe every person that says they
[1:25:20] are a
[1:25:21] Believer is this kind of believer
[1:25:25] believer and a
[1:25:27] Believer is the Fai of
[1:25:32] God that
[1:25:34] moves in
[1:25:39] you a Believer is the faith of God that
[1:25:42] moves in you that's a real
[1:25:47] believer you like
[1:25:50] that you like that I like I like like
[1:25:54] the teaching of where we can see what
[1:25:57] faith really is now turn with me if you
[1:26:00] would to Genesis
[1:26:02] 3:1 let's let's look back at the Garden
[1:26:05] of Eden now and whenever Satan come
[1:26:08] against the first human being on the
[1:26:11] earth now remember they were
[1:26:13] positionally placed in the Garden of
[1:26:16] Eden Adam was placed first years later
[1:26:21] years and years and years after God had
[1:26:25] stopped creating he
[1:26:28] brings Eve into
[1:26:31] existence now watch the serpent was more
[1:26:35] subtile than any beast of the field
[1:26:39] which the Lord God had made and he said
[1:26:43] unto the woman yay has God said ye shall
[1:26:46] not eat of every tree of the garden I
[1:26:49] want you to notice this is not a talking
[1:26:52] rattlesnake
[1:26:54] this is not a talking Copperhead or a
[1:26:58] talking gardener snake or a black snake
[1:27:02] it was a two-legged
[1:27:04] snake that's the kind you really got to
[1:27:06] watch most of us are scared to death
[1:27:08] copperheads and rattlesnakes and boy
[1:27:11] constrictors and all kinds of things
[1:27:12] like that and set under a two-legged
[1:27:14] snake that's leading you Soul To Hell
[1:27:17] Amen Brother D now what did happen Moses
[1:27:21] breaks into this and and he he doesn't
[1:27:25] go in to what had happened prior to this
[1:27:28] in order to make Genesis 3:1 able to say
[1:27:33] what it does but what happened of course
[1:27:36] we know was that Satan had a soul but
[1:27:40] the serpent did not have a soul but he
[1:27:43] had a place for a soul and Satan is
[1:27:46] wanting to inject himself into the human
[1:27:50] race he's wanting the Earth he's wanting
[1:27:52] a domain by now the Angels had already
[1:27:56] fallen and Satan had went over on the
[1:27:58] north side of heaven and preached to the
[1:28:01] angels and exalted himself above them
[1:28:03] and so many of them pulled away from the
[1:28:07] kingdom of Michael which was Christ and
[1:28:10] they joined over there where were they
[1:28:14] what Dominion what domain I I don't know
[1:28:17] I'm not sure that any of us know but I'm
[1:28:19] sure that the Angels fa the prophet
[1:28:22] tells us that God created to the Earth
[1:28:25] and brought it into existence after the
[1:28:28] Angels had already fallen so this was a
[1:28:30] Heavenly dispensation where they were so
[1:28:33] when God started creating the M the
[1:28:36] millions and millions or trillions maybe
[1:28:39] it is now of planets that they have
[1:28:41] found there was this one little tiny
[1:28:44] Speck of
[1:28:45] dust that God put out in the middle of
[1:28:48] this tremendous culdesac I'll call it
[1:28:52] called our galaxy
[1:28:55] and God put it in so many miles away
[1:28:58] from the the center of the universe and
[1:29:02] God gave it a moon and God gave it a sun
[1:29:07] and God placed it in exact proximity of
[1:29:10] where it needed to be to be able to
[1:29:13] produce what is called the habitable
[1:29:16] zone now our our planet rotates
[1:29:20] approximately being where it is to our
[1:29:23] our greatest sour of Light which is the
[1:29:25] sun approximately an average of 93
[1:29:28] million miles from the Sun now if it was
[1:29:32] several thousand miles closer then the
[1:29:35] temperature would be so hot none of us
[1:29:38] could live if it was several thousand
[1:29:41] miles farther away it would be colder
[1:29:44] than it would be like Pluto or Mars so
[1:29:48] God placed it exactly in the right Zone
[1:29:52] where life could come upon it
[1:29:54] and uh our next main object of light of
[1:29:57] course being the moon on an average of
[1:30:00] I'm thinking maybe
[1:30:02] 237,000 miles now not million but
[1:30:05] Thousand Miles then our closest
[1:30:08] neighbors all around and we look out in
[1:30:11] the night sky and we see them so they
[1:30:13] they were placed there positionally in
[1:30:16] what is called the horizontal rainbow
[1:30:18] and then there's the ecliptical view
[1:30:20] which is what we can see from the Earth
[1:30:22] but what's amazing is I've been in South
[1:30:24] Africa and different continents of the
[1:30:26] earth and when you look at the night sky
[1:30:29] in South Africa it looks different than
[1:30:31] what it does here in the hills of
[1:30:32] Tennessee now being to Canada and seeing
[1:30:36] the northern lights and when you look at
[1:30:38] it from there it looks different from
[1:30:40] there so I'm told from being out in
[1:30:42] outer space whenever they look at it
[1:30:45] they see it totally different so if a
[1:30:47] person was on another planet and looking
[1:30:49] this way and look toward the Stars you'd
[1:30:52] never be able to read the same images of
[1:30:56] Leo the Lion the Virgin Urus you'd never
[1:31:00] be able to see it so it's like whoever
[1:31:03] put the Earth where they did they put it
[1:31:05] in such a spot that they could look at
[1:31:08] the night sky and read the story of
[1:31:10] redemption
[1:31:12] reconciliation the fall of the Dragon
[1:31:15] amen Aras so on and so on so God works
[1:31:20] and operates off of position you follow
[1:31:23] me so far or dilute some off the
[1:31:25] horizontal
[1:31:27] rainbow position is very important to
[1:31:30] God our spiritual position and also our
[1:31:33] natural position so the devil had had
[1:31:37] embodied The Serpent and the serpent
[1:31:40] could already talk of course he was the
[1:31:42] next one closest to man on the earth so
[1:31:45] God creating every form of life and he
[1:31:47] come right up right before he made his
[1:31:50] son he made this beast and he give him a
[1:31:55] futuristic image by that I mean he was
[1:31:59] the closest one that looked like
[1:32:02] man so if God made man in his own image
[1:32:07] and God is
[1:32:11] invisible well where do we get this
[1:32:13] image at then God is invisible right and
[1:32:17] yet the Bible said I to the image of God
[1:32:19] made he them male and female created he
[1:32:23] them where was that image
[1:32:25] Christ Christ so God places him in the
[1:32:29] garden and and oh my what a paradise it
[1:32:32] must have been and God simply gave them
[1:32:35] the a very simple command and God just
[1:32:37] told Adam I remember at this stage Adam
[1:32:40] was not planting So Adam wasn't going
[1:32:42] out digging holes you know and planting
[1:32:44] it and Miracle growing it and mulching
[1:32:46] it and all that sort of thing he all all
[1:32:48] that was already done for Adam but what
[1:32:51] God told Adam to do is just d dress it
[1:32:55] and keep it that's all you got to do
[1:32:57] just go out there and dress it you see
[1:32:59] anything needs to be done just dress it
[1:33:01] keep it so every day he would just go
[1:33:04] out in his dominion and he would dress
[1:33:06] it and keep it and all my just lived a
[1:33:09] beautiful wonderful life but there was
[1:33:11] one sad part about that life in that he
[1:33:14] had no one to share it with so he lived
[1:33:15] it by
[1:33:16] himself and then God opens up his side
[1:33:21] and brings out this rib and and then God
[1:33:24] divides his spirit and pulls out this
[1:33:27] feminist part because she was in him and
[1:33:30] places this inside this body that God
[1:33:33] has made which is not in the original
[1:33:36] creation and then when he when he woke
[1:33:40] up maybe God would have said to her now
[1:33:44] go over there and stand
[1:33:46] by just take him by the
[1:33:49] hand I've done it many a time with our
[1:33:52] Saints some sitting here and some that's
[1:33:54] gone on I'd be the first face they would
[1:33:56] see after a surgery well I can imagine
[1:33:59] that'd be
[1:34:00] frightening but I'm there with them
[1:34:03] patting them on the shoulder you know or
[1:34:04] holding their hand or whatever and you
[1:34:07] imagine when Adam went to sleep he went
[1:34:10] to sleep by
[1:34:12] himself but he woke up with
[1:34:18] someone her long blonde hair hanging
[1:34:22] down her back maybe real long beautiful
[1:34:25] hair her blue eyes as blue as they could
[1:34:29] be the azur skies that the Lord God had
[1:34:34] created and when he goes to batting his
[1:34:37] eyes as the Divine anastesia goes to
[1:34:39] wearing off and he comes to
[1:34:42] himself and he feels something he had
[1:34:45] never felt
[1:34:46] before it was a small dainty
[1:34:51] hand he actually felt
[1:34:54] two cuz one was under his and another
[1:34:57] one was on top of
[1:34:59] his It's A peculiar feeling within his
[1:35:04] humanity and he finally comes to him he
[1:35:07] opens his eyes and he looks
[1:35:10] there and something was in him struck
[1:35:14] his
[1:35:15] being and all of a sudden the revelation
[1:35:17] of God flooded his soul and he said you
[1:35:22] are is shy
[1:35:25] because you came from
[1:35:30] ish ish is our English word man Isa is
[1:35:35] the word
[1:35:39] woman the devil watching in the
[1:35:42] operating room or from the outside
[1:35:45] doorway at least seeing
[1:35:50] a suff thises it
[1:35:55] this is my
[1:35:57] way my
[1:35:59] entrance into the human
[1:36:03] race the Angels his Fallen Angels
[1:36:06] standing around him imagine him turning
[1:36:08] around saying mark it
[1:36:11] down I will get
[1:36:17] her by getting
[1:36:19] her I don't really want him he's
[1:36:22] Original Seed
[1:36:24] I can't mix myself with him but I can
[1:36:28] mix myself with
[1:36:30] her she is only a
[1:36:34] channel to accomplish the means I
[1:36:38] desire I want his
[1:36:43] domain so now I catch you
[1:36:46] up to verse two and the woman said unto
[1:36:49] the
[1:36:50] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[1:36:53] trees of the
[1:36:55] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:36:59] which is in the midst of the garden God
[1:37:00] has said You shall not eat of it neither
[1:37:03] shall you touch it lest you
[1:37:06] die now let's look again carefully at
[1:37:09] verse three but of the
[1:37:12] fruit of the
[1:37:14] tree Hebrew words are unlike our English
[1:37:18] words they can mean have two different
[1:37:20] meanings that are so opposite look at
[1:37:23] this word
[1:37:24] per this is what the word Moses used for
[1:37:28] fruit produce of the ground
[1:37:33] or
[1:37:36] offspring
[1:37:37] uhoh
[1:37:39] Offspring
[1:37:41] children
[1:37:44] progeny of the
[1:37:49] womb oh I mean I thought was talk about
[1:37:51] an apple tree
[1:37:54] oh was it a cherry tree maybe a
[1:37:56] pomegranate
[1:38:00] mango why are we talking about progyny
[1:38:04] or children or offspring of the womb
[1:38:08] from a tree in the Garden of
[1:38:12] Eden but of the fruit of the tree which
[1:38:15] is in the midst
[1:38:19] Toc
[1:38:21] middle among a number of
[1:38:27] persons so there is a middle
[1:38:30] ground of a number of persons
[1:38:34] between of things
[1:38:37] arranged by
[1:38:42] TW so we've got a man
[1:38:45] tree a woman tree if the man tree will
[1:38:50] come to the woman tree the progyny will
[1:38:53] be
[1:38:55] Christ but it's arranged by twos so if
[1:39:00] the right is arranged by twos there must
[1:39:03] also be
[1:39:04] another person on the other side of the
[1:39:08] dark side so it cannot be Eve alone
[1:39:12] because the middle can only be an
[1:39:14] arrangement between two
[1:39:19] persons well I believe this is about the
[1:39:21] quietest I ever heard y'all mou life
[1:39:24] children it's okay to breathe I mean it
[1:39:26] don't scare me you can there you go
[1:39:28] everybody now on three breathe in and
[1:39:33] out now listen this oh my
[1:39:37] my and the serpent said into to the
[1:39:42] woman you shall not surely
[1:39:46] die now what are we talking about
[1:39:51] position so what's it trying to do talk
[1:39:55] her out of her
[1:39:59] position I just it just because you find
[1:40:03] the word the message of the hour I
[1:40:04] should say it finds you by the grace of
[1:40:06] God and leads you to it don't mean that
[1:40:08] you won't fight all hell after you find
[1:40:10] the truth because Satan will do his best
[1:40:13] to try to talk you out of your place the
[1:40:15] way to did Eve in the Garden of Eden
[1:40:17] same might with every God called
[1:40:19] preacher every God called Deacon every
[1:40:21] trustee you know whoever you are just La
[1:40:23] member if God leads you here at our
[1:40:25] church we welcome everyone that God
[1:40:27] calls here that's as a matter of fact
[1:40:29] that's all I want here is those that God
[1:40:31] wants I'm not interested in having a big
[1:40:33] church I personally prefer a small
[1:40:35] church but I want everyone here that God
[1:40:38] wants but just because God leads you
[1:40:40] here don't mean that you won't fight to
[1:40:43] stay here until you get here so the
[1:40:46] serpent said unto the woman you shall
[1:40:48] not surely die now he's saying exact
[1:40:51] opposite
[1:40:54] of what God
[1:40:56] Said her position will be
[1:40:59] determined by her
[1:41:03] response will she say what the word says
[1:41:07] about her by his stripes I am already
[1:41:14] healed oh wish she said well the doctor
[1:41:17] said it was a hopeless case well you
[1:41:19] know what the doctor he may been
[1:41:21] perfectly honest
[1:41:23] but until the Lord says otherwise we
[1:41:25] believe what the Lord
[1:41:26] says now once he's going to explain the
[1:41:30] reason why he's already opened the womb
[1:41:32] of her mind now for God does
[1:41:36] know that in the day you eat
[1:41:42] thereof you're going to be blind lost
[1:41:45] wretched thrown out of the Garden of
[1:41:48] Eden you'll never have peace again
[1:41:50] another day in your life you're going to
[1:41:52] cause every blind child you're going to
[1:41:55] cause every man every
[1:42:01] woman he's not going to tell her the
[1:42:04] truth but God knows in the day you eat
[1:42:08] thereof oh wow then your eyes shall be
[1:42:17] opened and ye shall be as
[1:42:21] Gods knowing good and
[1:42:25] evil and when the woman
[1:42:28] saw that the tree was good for
[1:42:32] food and it was pleasant to the
[1:42:37] eyes now let me just say this before I
[1:42:39] go into the meanings of this words I've
[1:42:41] eat a lot of apples in my
[1:42:44] life and like you I've got my
[1:42:47] favorites but I ain't never in my life
[1:42:51] eat no apple no Peach no apricot I've
[1:42:56] eat fruits in China fruits in Egypt
[1:42:59] fruits in Israel fruits in different
[1:43:02] parts of the world where I've been I
[1:43:05] ain't never had no
[1:43:07] fruit to do to me what we're fixing to
[1:43:11] read
[1:43:11] about so then I have to question maybe
[1:43:15] it's a different type of
[1:43:21] fruit and when the woman saw the tree
[1:43:24] was good for food and that it was
[1:43:30] pleasant desire
[1:43:33] wish longings of one's
[1:43:36] heart
[1:43:41] lust so if any of you all ever went to
[1:43:45] Kroger and you see those honey crisp or
[1:43:48] those Macintosh or Gayla or and you're
[1:43:51] just standing there lusting oh I can't
[1:43:54] control myself I'm lusted I'm lusted
[1:43:57] Lord have mercy honey send me after
[1:43:58] church I'll buy you one if that's
[1:44:06] what so if any of you ever lusted after
[1:44:11] an apple like that you mean an apple
[1:44:14] does that to you well you starving to
[1:44:16] death you ain't never had no fruit in
[1:44:17] your life or
[1:44:19] what notice the mean's words now as I
[1:44:22] said you look at where I'm getting this
[1:44:23] Hebrew
[1:44:25] lexicon longing of one's heart lust
[1:44:28] appetite covetousness in a bad sense
[1:44:31] thing desired object of Desire oh I want
[1:44:35] that pump no I want it so bad I just
[1:44:37] can't take it I
[1:44:43] got come on be
[1:44:51] realistic and it was Pleasant to the
[1:44:54] eyes and a
[1:44:56] tree to
[1:44:58] be
[1:45:00] desired
[1:45:02] covet take pleasure in Delight to be
[1:45:08] desirable to Delight
[1:45:11] greatly
[1:45:13] desire
[1:45:18] greatly now maybe you've ate of an apple
[1:45:20] I've never tasted before
[1:45:27] to make one
[1:45:30] wise I am familiar with an apple today
[1:45:33] keeps a doctor away but I ain't never
[1:45:35] found one that can make you
[1:45:37] wise so she's standing there with this
[1:45:39] apple said oh oh if I could get that
[1:45:42] Apple I would be a PhD an lldd A
[1:45:46] Bachelor of Arts a Bachelor of Science a
[1:45:48] bachelor of chemistry a oh if I could
[1:45:50] just get that Apple if I could get it
[1:45:52] I'd become so
[1:45:56] wise thank God for the evening
[1:46:01] light a tree to be desired to make one
[1:46:05] wise to look upon have
[1:46:09] Insight so whatever this fruit is is
[1:46:13] going to illuminate
[1:46:15] her and what's it going to illuminate
[1:46:18] her
[1:46:19] about herself
[1:46:24] oh you were made for
[1:46:27] this you see your husband's never told
[1:46:30] you about this has he he's never
[1:46:32] illuminated you he's never enlightened
[1:46:36] you can't you see how tricky the devil
[1:46:41] is so this whatever this is is going to
[1:46:45] give her wisdom about
[1:46:47] herself it's going to illuminate her
[1:46:50] about herself what she is her potential
[1:46:55] friends cannot you
[1:46:59] see the political stance of our
[1:47:04] day she's he's trying to get her to
[1:47:07] doubt her god-given position and
[1:47:10] convince her she's another can't you see
[1:47:13] why politics in our nation and around
[1:47:16] the world is identity
[1:47:20] politics have you wondered and not
[1:47:23] understood why the homosexual agenda the
[1:47:27] transgender agenda look look how go sex
[1:47:30] this sex that sex something else why it
[1:47:34] started with sex in the beginning and it
[1:47:38] will end up in the same way so then what
[1:47:40] do they do they feed this and they
[1:47:43] started years ago of course not with so
[1:47:45] much the children but now it's aim right
[1:47:48] toward the children and trying to put
[1:47:50] image and slded seeds in their mind even
[1:47:53] though biologically they were born a
[1:47:56] girl but try to convince them you're not
[1:47:58] really a girl you're not really a girl
[1:48:00] you're a boy and try to tell a boy I
[1:48:03] mean I ain't too smart but you ought to
[1:48:05] be able to look at certain parts about
[1:48:07] you that ought to be the answer unless
[1:48:09] you're a knucklehead or you're under the
[1:48:12] influence of this agenda of the last day
[1:48:16] which is going to bring this world into
[1:48:19] destruction
[1:48:26] so what do they
[1:48:29] do they
[1:48:31] crossdress and some of these perverted

[1:53:23] our place and stay
[1:53:31] there oh dear
[1:53:33] God verse seven the eyes of them
[1:53:38] both were
[1:53:40] opened and they
[1:53:43] knew that they were
[1:53:48] naked I quote the prophet in saying this
[1:53:52] right if eating apples it makes you
[1:53:53] realize you're naked we better pass the
[1:53:56] apples around
[1:54:00] again so whatever it was they partook of
[1:54:04] open their
[1:54:08] senses that never felt
[1:54:11] fear that never felt
[1:54:13] anxiety heartache
[1:54:19] trouble you imagine the moment that they
[1:54:23] realized we have been lied
[1:54:30] to what a horrible thing it's going to
[1:54:32] be one day when people are judged before
[1:54:35] the white throne and they hear those
[1:54:37] words depart from me you workers of
[1:54:41] iniquity and as a man had a dream many
[1:54:43] many years
[1:54:45] ago he was in the regions of the
[1:54:48] lost and he would reach down and pick up
[1:54:51] a man and look at him
[1:54:53] drop him back down and go pick up
[1:54:55] another and look at him drop him back
[1:54:57] down go look pick up another drop him
[1:54:59] back
[1:55:00] down and someone in the dream said
[1:55:02] what's he looking
[1:55:04] for and a voice answered back for that
[1:55:07] man who sent that
[1:55:10] preacher that preached him into
[1:55:18] hell Being A God Called man can be one
[1:55:20] of the greatest honors of life
[1:55:24] but to be a preacher that don't tell the
[1:55:27] truth you couldn't hardly have any worse
[1:55:29] thing ever happen to
[1:55:33] you I know you pray for the ministry but
[1:55:35] pray for him like never
[1:55:38] before Oh my God and the eyes of them
[1:55:42] both were
[1:55:43] opened and they knew that they were
[1:55:46] naked and they sewed fig leaves together
[1:55:49] and made themselves aprons that's the
[1:55:53] English word the Hebrew word is loin
[1:55:59] cloth well if they ate an apple why was
[1:56:03] not it the first sign of human beings
[1:56:06] wearing
[1:56:10] masks that's what they told us we're
[1:56:12] supposed to do right we found out there
[1:56:14] lying so why didn't Adam and Eve go out
[1:56:17] there and then they get why get a fig
[1:56:18] Leaf I mean get one of these little
[1:56:20] video guys and just s them together and
[1:56:22] come out of the garden of e and got
[1:56:24] your Hello Lord how you doing well God I
[1:56:27] tell you one thing we realize that we uh
[1:56:29] we ate this apple here and we got we
[1:56:32] disobeyed the word so we decided that
[1:56:33] we'd make a we'd make a mask and we'll
[1:56:35] wear a mask around why would they cover
[1:56:38] thems with a loin
[1:56:46] cloth Lucifer got out of his
[1:56:49] position talk the serpent
[1:56:52] out of his
[1:56:54] position he talked Eve out of her
[1:56:57] position she talked
[1:57:00] Adam out of
[1:57:03] his then when God comes down in the
[1:57:05] Garden of Eden that day and search for
[1:57:08] his
[1:57:09] children it was their custom to go to
[1:57:12] church every
[1:57:13] day so God showed up a church and they
[1:57:16] wasn't
[1:57:17] there so he goes through the garden of
[1:57:20] Edom Adam Adam where are you he knew
[1:57:23] where he was but he's waiting for Adam
[1:57:26] to cry out here I am father I'm
[1:57:29] lost help
[1:57:32] me oh
[1:57:34] my so God kills a lamb and takes the
[1:57:37] skin off of it throws it in behind the
[1:57:39] bush and Adam says I'm
[1:57:42] hid I was
[1:57:48] afraid I was afraid and I hid myself
[1:57:53] who told thee that thou was
[1:57:57] naked and stop partaking the fruit of
[1:57:59] which I forbid me the woman that thou
[1:58:01] gavest to be with
[1:58:04] me she gave me of the
[1:58:11] fruit so the Lord God calls them to come
[1:58:15] out here walks the
[1:58:18] serpent God looks at him and says
[1:58:20] because you have done this thing on your
[1:58:26] belly you will
[1:58:28] go and
[1:58:30] dust will be your meat all the days of
[1:58:34] your life and somebody please remind me
[1:58:38] what have our human bodies made out
[1:58:43] of can't you see why he gets a thrill
[1:58:45] out of tormenting you why he gets a
[1:58:48] thrill out of trying to make you sick
[1:58:52] so he lost his legs his punishment is
[1:58:56] bowing
[1:58:57] down and on your belly you'll go he
[1:59:00] wasn't on his belly before that's in
[1:59:02] your Bible
[1:59:05] right but if you notice he offers No
[1:59:11] Redemption then the Lord says unto the
[1:59:14] man and you remember the story and the
[1:59:16] woman and you imagine they heard a
[1:59:19] harshness in God's voice
[1:59:22] that never heard
[1:59:24] before and it frightened
[1:59:27] them sometimes the way we get scared in
[1:59:29] church y'all ever hear that in the voice
[1:59:32] of God you say oh Jesus oh Jesus I'm
[1:59:35] sorry why it's it's the laziness of
[1:59:38] humanity that sometimes he has to raise
[1:59:40] his voice above a whisper and yet people
[1:59:42] don't like a preacher like that a lot of
[1:59:45] preachers that shows and not preaching
[1:59:46] with the voice of God CU sometimes God
[1:59:48] gets angry with us and upset with us and
[1:59:50] he use a man to express
[1:59:53] and God must have raised his tenor of
[1:59:55] his voice and changed and and my Adam
[1:59:57] was looking at him but oh I never heard
[2:00:00] talk
[2:00:02] before Oh and evil Stander shake it and
[2:00:05] oh Adam Adam ad what have we
[2:00:10] done and as much as it broke his heart
[2:00:12] he said
[2:00:15] leave get
[2:00:19] out get out
[2:00:24] the prophet said I can see him little
[2:00:27] Eve lays her head over on his
[2:00:29] chest she starts
[2:00:32] crying his tears out of his eyes come
[2:00:34] down and mingle with her tears and they
[2:00:37] run down his body and that sheep skin
[2:00:39] slapping against his leg the tears and
[2:00:42] the blood merge
[2:00:44] together God showing the tears of a
[2:00:47] repentant sinner mixing with the blood
[2:00:49] of the Lamb will produce the Covenant
[2:00:54] and the pillar of fire come down and got
[2:00:55] in front of him and said wait a
[2:00:59] minute I promise
[2:01:02] you I will bring you
[2:01:09] back you see friends before there can
[2:01:12] ever be a resurrection in this last day
[2:01:15] the bride must come to her position it
[2:01:18] will be so powerful whenever member of
[2:01:21] the the bride that's on the earth comes
[2:01:23] to their
[2:01:24] position it will cause a
[2:01:28] resurrection and a
[2:01:32] Rapture look at how
[2:01:34] powerful position
[2:01:37] is so when Jesus dies and raised again
[2:01:40] Jesus could not he could not call the
[2:01:42] General
[2:01:44] Resurrection before he went to the Cross
[2:01:46] but when he raised and he told John in
[2:01:49] the Book of Revelation I am he that was
[2:01:51] dead and I have the power of death hell
[2:01:55] and the grave he did not have the keys
[2:01:58] and his hands when he raised liers from
[2:02:00] the grave he did not have the keys in
[2:02:03] his hands when he raised the wiow from
[2:02:05] name son that didn't happen to do he
[2:02:08] went down on the door of hell and he
[2:02:09] snatched it now he's got the voice of
[2:02:12] the entire resurrection and when his
[2:02:15] bride comes to her place the bride in
[2:02:17] China the bride in Japan the bride in
[2:02:20] Guam the bride all over Africa the bride
[2:02:22] all over India the bride all over the
[2:02:24] United States when they come to their

[2:04:10] a man is not justified by The Works of
[2:04:12] the law but by the
[2:04:15] face
[2:04:17] of
[2:04:19] Jesus Christ
[2:04:22] not faith in him but by the facei of
[2:04:26] Jesus
[2:04:28] Christ even we have believed in Jesus
[2:04:31] Christ this is the way a True Believer
[2:04:36] believes in Jesus Christ not a nominal
[2:04:40] Fai not a nominal belief but a
[2:04:44] believer's
[2:04:47] belief let bu it
[2:04:55] hallelujah
[2:04:59] hallelujah thank you Lord
[2:05:04] Jesus
[2:05:07] Hallelujah many of you
[2:05:10] know the Exodus
[2:05:13] walk as God called us out of where we
[2:05:16] were
[2:05:17] from Egypt as it were we've experienced
[2:05:21] the mult multitude that fell away we've
[2:05:23] experienced the Mana we've experienced
[2:05:25] the water from the rock we've
[2:05:28] experienced those wonderful things that
[2:05:29] God did for
[2:05:30] us but could it be that we've moved into
[2:05:34] the Book of
[2:05:37] Joshua remember the hand that God showed
[2:05:39] the
[2:05:40] prophet whenever he led him into the
[2:05:42] dream of the
[2:05:44] vision and he come down the hand and
[2:05:46] pointed to this in
[2:05:49] Joshua remember Joshua repres represents
[2:05:52] not some certain preacher but the holy
[2:05:54] ghost that is going to lead every
[2:05:56] believer into their position many of you
[2:05:59] are already there it's not like you're
[2:06:01] going to wake up after a while and oh
[2:06:03] praise God I'm finally going to get
[2:06:05] straightened out all 60 years of my life
[2:06:07] has been in vain absolutely not all it
[2:06:10] is is just being able to
[2:06:12] recognize that you're
[2:06:14] there and then once you get there by the
[2:06:18] communication of your face you can have
[2:06:21] the
[2:06:22] acknowledgement and allow it to grow and
[2:06:24] become energized and be God what God
[2:06:27] wants you to be because of your
[2:06:30] confession in Christ Jesus I'm saved I'm
[2:06:34] Sanctified I'm filled with the Holy
[2:06:36] Ghost brother Donnie will we always be
[2:06:38] human always until the body change
[2:06:41] that's right but Paul didn't say
[2:06:43] acknowledge what you are in your flesh
[2:06:45] but acknowledge what you are in Christ
[2:06:50] Jesus Hallelujah
[2:06:53] I may would just raise your hand to the
[2:06:54] Lord today and say Lord help me to be
[2:06:57] that Give Me Faith in who I am Give Me
[2:07:01] Faith so the Lord Jesus read the
[2:07:03] word and it gave him Faith about who he
[2:07:07] was no doubt it helped him when he read
[2:07:09] about Moses no doubt it helped him when
[2:07:10] he read about Joshua and many of the Old
[2:07:12] Testament characters but it done
[2:07:15] something different for him when he read
[2:07:18] what was written about himself remember
[2:07:22] when it when he went to the church at
[2:07:24] Nazareth several years ago we stood on
[2:07:27] that that little place there and they
[2:07:29] reconstructed a little small community
[2:07:32] there in
[2:07:33] Nazareth and it's a it's a steep place
[2:07:37] it's kind like almost a brow that's on a
[2:07:38] head it kind of juts out a little bit
[2:07:41] and they they LED Jesus to this place
[2:07:43] after he reads the scripture when he
[2:07:45] read the scripture the anointing is upon
[2:07:47] me cuz he's anointed me to preach the
[2:07:49] gospel and Jesus said this day this
[2:07:51] scripture is fulfill so what did he do
[2:07:53] he read the scripture pertaining to
[2:07:55] himself and it gave him face I just
[2:07:58] can't keep on wondering if he didn't
[2:08:00] have an Enlightenment an understanding
[2:08:02] of what they were fixing to do and they
[2:08:04] led him to that that
[2:08:05] precipice am I going to kill
[2:08:08] him but the father give him that
[2:08:11] something and the Bible says he passed
[2:08:14] right among them just turned and walked
[2:08:17] away how did he do that by faith in his
[2:08:21] position
[2:08:23] cannot you have faith in who you are I'm
[2:08:27] a Christian I'm an heir to Healing I'm
[2:08:30] an heir to
[2:08:32] Deliverance well brother Donnie I've got
[2:08:33] my mistakes and my faults you're always
[2:08:35] going to have that that is nothing to do
[2:08:37] with your new birth and your
[2:08:39] inheritance both of my daughters made
[2:08:41] mistakes and I had to correct them and
[2:08:43] had to deal with them they were still my
[2:08:45] daughters even when they didn't did what
[2:08:47] I want them to do they were still my
[2:08:49] daughters even whenever I had had to
[2:08:51] correct them and you'll always be a son
[2:08:54] or daughter of God if you're born of his
[2:08:58] presence can we stand our
[2:09:03] feet praise the Lord
[2:09:05] Jesus I love this in Ephesians 1:1 I
[2:09:08] know you know it Paul an apostle of
[2:09:11] Jesus Christ by the will of God to the
[2:09:15] Saints which are at
[2:09:18] Ephesus and to the faithful
[2:09:22] am in Christ
[2:09:24] Jesus that's me that's you Grace be to
[2:09:29] you and peace from God our Father and
[2:09:33] from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be
[2:09:36] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[2:09:39] Christ who has blessed us with all
[2:09:42] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[2:09:47] in Christ Ephesians 2:6 hath raised us
[2:09:51] up together and made us sit together in
[2:09:55] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus verse 10
[2:09:59] for we are his
[2:10:01] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[2:10:06] good works which God has before
[2:10:09] ordained that we should walk in them a
