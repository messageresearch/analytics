[11:57] we appreciate this guy right here don't
[11:58] we
[12:03] amen God bless you all uh well first of
[12:06] all I've recovered it's uh Camp is
[12:09] amazing C Camp is amazing and it's and
[12:12] it's something over the years I feel
[12:13] like you know I talked to certain of you
[12:15] and and adults and I think you wonder
[12:17] how did they do how do they end up going
[12:18] to camp on a 12 hours on a bus right but
[12:22] it is something that uh you have to you
[12:24] do you want to be made for that and I I
[12:27] get it's like a privilege I get to go
[12:29] witness kids go to camp and one of the
[12:32] things about Camp that's so spectacular
[12:34] is their expectations they come right
[12:37] expecting God to move for them so it is
[12:40] filled with expectations I many of you
[12:42] and many of I I wish like we have almost
[12:45] camp meeting a lot here right as far as
[12:48] the the worship and the and the the love
[12:50] of God and the moving of the spirit but
[12:52] the in the children what you see is
[12:54] they're they they lose all their
[12:56] inhibitions and they are free to move in
[12:58] the SP spirit and to see that has been a
[13:00] privilege of My Life One of the the
[13:02] strongest experiences I've had with God
[13:04] is I think it's because we get away for
[13:05] 3 days and there's nothing else to
[13:07] concentrate on you counselors that are
[13:09] in John did you have a great experience
[13:12] I it's an amazing atmosphere and we have
[13:15] that and I don't want to take anything
[13:16] for granted it's so rich and it's also
[13:18] now the The Challenge and I speak to the
[13:20] youth that were there right you need to
[13:23] bring that back right to these people
[13:26] amen bring back what you bring your lick
[13:28] of fire back fact that you can you can
[13:30] share don't let God is Not different in
[13:32] Louisiana than he is right here in our
[13:34] home church right and so it is critical
[13:36] that you bring your experience back and
[13:37] what you got is you nail down a stake
[13:39] and say you know because one of the the
[13:41] favorite things that I have is that we
[13:43] come back and I make the kids talk to
[13:44] each other that they don't like that so
[13:46] much because I you know pull them and
[13:48] make them talk to each other but then I
[13:49] also make them do testimonies of what
[13:50] God has done for them so for a couple
[13:52] hours on the way back from the bus
[13:54] they're able to say like thing you know
[13:55] peace after peace after what God's given
[13:57] them and it's a treasure and there's a
[13:59] child that you think that they didn't
[14:01] really get anything and then they come
[14:02] out with something that's amazing so as
[14:05] you get an opportunity ask the children
[14:06] about what their experience was in Camp
[14:08] we did testimonies last year and they
[14:09] have some this year that are just as
[14:11] Supernatural just as wonderful but it's
[14:13] a joy to be a Christian in this day it's
[14:16] a joy they do a wonderful job in
[14:18] Louisiana it is solid and we're just so
[14:20] blessed and thankful we had two people
[14:22] get baptized from our assembly and a few
[14:24] more as well and it's just a privilege
[14:26] to be a Christian I cannot imagine what
[14:30] it would be to not be a Christian in
[14:31] this day I don't want to and I thank God
[14:33] for it let's pray dear Lord thank you
[14:35] for your grace to us I pray for the the
[14:38] inspiration of this service to be so
[14:40] rich and to flow so freely in the spirit
[14:42] I pray Lord God for the young people to
[14:44] let the fire that start in Louisiana
[14:46] continue on and and Catch Fire and a
[14:48] refilling of the Holy Ghost I thank God
[14:50] for a refilling down that I received it
[14:52] camp and I thank you Lord help me to
[14:54] keep that that fire burning let the
[14:56] children be an example for the for all
[14:59] all that that are here and I thank you
[15:00] Lord as we support each other in one
[15:02] body filled with love and grace I am so
[15:05] so blessed to recognize and so many
[15:07] people around the earth The Same Spirit
[15:10] whether it be different cultures and
[15:11] different races different uh age
[15:13] different age groups or whatever
[15:15] different groups and assemblies there
[15:16] are slight differences but you recognize
[15:19] that spirit of God that comes forth
[15:20] wherever it may be and you and and
[15:23] that's a um you bond with that Spirit
[15:26] you see it and you recognize I recognize
[15:28] you in my brother brothers and sisters

[36:17] has reached to us and given us his grace
[36:21] amen question answers tomorrow night at
[36:24] 7:00 still good for that Revelation is
[36:27] the
[36:29] lamb now we'll go to five chapters after
[36:33] he took the
[36:35] book watch as he moves from his position
[36:40] of taking the book into now sharing the
[36:43] inheritance of what's in the
[36:46] book Revelation 101 and I saw another
[36:50] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[36:51] closed with a
[36:53] cloud and a
[36:55] rainbow was upon his head I want you
[36:59] notice the different symbols now and
[37:01] where they are pertaining to him so John
[37:05] sees an angel come down from heaven a
[37:07] mighty Angel not just an angel but a
[37:09] mighty Angel clothed with a cloud and a
[37:12] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[37:17] as it were the Sun and his
[37:20] feet as pillars of
[37:23] fire so the pillar of fire had to be in
[37:25] the right place rainbow had to be in the
[37:28] right
[37:29] place then notice in verse two and he
[37:32] had in his hand so head feet hand he had
[37:39] in his hand a little book open and his
[37:44] right
[37:46] foot upon the sea and his left
[37:51] foot on the
[37:54] earth so he sees him standing in s
[37:58] now one foot on the land the other foot
[38:01] on the sea with all these
[38:04] symbols and cried with a loud voice as
[38:07] when a r lion roars and when he had
[38:10] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[38:14] voices so when he cries as a lion then
[38:19] out of that issues forth seven
[38:23] Thunders and when the seven Thunders had
[38:25] uttered their voices
[38:28] I was about to write so John was
[38:31] commissioned remember Revelation one to
[38:33] write what you see in here so John
[38:35] actually heard what the seven Thunders
[38:38] said in those mysterious voices so he
[38:41] took up his pen as would' say took up
[38:43] his pen to write it and he said I was
[38:46] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[38:49] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[38:52] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[38:55] and Rite them not now want you keep in
[38:58] mind now the seven Thunders were
[39:01] heard by a
[39:05] prophet they were not actually written
[39:08] in the Old Testament or in the four
[39:11] gospels or the Pauline
[39:13] Epistles but they were heard and a
[39:16] prophet was going to write down what
[39:19] they had
[39:22] said but the voice said seal them
[39:26] up in verse five and the angel which I
[39:30] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[39:31] Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[39:34] swear by him that liveth forever and
[39:36] ever who created heaven the things that
[39:39] therein are in the earth the things that
[39:41] there and are in the sea and the things
[39:43] which are therein that there should be
[39:46] time no longer now remember this Advent
[39:50] of this angel of Revelation
[39:53] 10 is not
[39:56] declaring that there won't be any more
[39:58] increments of time because the
[40:01] Millennium which is over in Revelation
[40:04] 19 still comes after this which is an
[40:07] increment of time a thousand years but
[40:12] he's cutting off a time for certain
[40:15] things what is it denominational ages
[40:19] have run out right right no more
[40:23] time but in the days of the voice of the
[40:26] seventh angel
[40:28] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[40:31] of God should be
[40:34] finished as he has declared to his
[40:38] servants the
[40:40] prophets we are truly living in a
[40:43] blessed day
[40:46] amen amen we're going to pray and um I'm
[40:51] sure that probably some of you have
[40:53] heard by now that brother Ron Spencer
[40:56] had a heart attack like last night and
[40:59] they had to rush him to the hospital and
[41:03] they did a heart cast on him and one
[41:06] artery was 100% another one was 90 and
[41:10] another one was 70 they were able to put
[41:13] a stent in um the one that was 100 get
[41:18] it opened up but they didn't feel
[41:21] comfortable in doing the other two so
[41:24] I've heard from him today just heard
[41:25] from brother Mark if few me a few
[41:27] minutes ago and they're fixing to take
[41:30] brother Ron from the hospital that he is
[41:32] in in one part of Virginia up to UVA
[41:35] which is in Charlottesville and they're
[41:37] going to do the other one uh tomorrow
[41:40] the 90% one and the one that 70% is
[41:44] located in a very difficult place so
[41:47] they're going to try to treat that by
[41:49] medication brother Ron himself text me
[41:52] this evening and said these words
[41:54] brother Donnie I need a miracle
[41:58] so I text him back and said that's
[42:00] exactly what we're expecting that's
[42:02] right that's what we're believing for
[42:05] now brother Ron was just in Louisiana
[42:06] and preached and shouted and run and
[42:08] danced and I mean just had a Time must
[42:11] have made the devil already all been out
[42:12] of shape so we want to just pray for our
[42:16] brother that the Lord will just move for
[42:18] him and give him strength and uh I tell
[42:21] he's been through so much hasn't he but
[42:24] we we know enough about the program of
[42:26] God to know that some people are
[42:28] actually used for such purposes like
[42:31] this to be able to strengthen the other
[42:33] people of God and we know that it
[42:35] certainly has how many of you have a
[42:38] request you'd like to to raise your hand
[42:40] signifying tonight also have a prayer
[42:43] call here for a sister that will sister
[42:46] naen Patterson like to remember that as
[42:49] well Heavenly Father we come to you
[42:52] tonight Lord with Thanksgiving and
[42:54] appreciation for all that you've done
[42:56] for us
[42:57] for all that you mean to us Lord Jesus
[42:59] just singing about your grace and you
[43:02] were so worthy to come father you were
[43:04] the only one that could take this book
[43:07] and we're so happy that you did Father
[43:10] we come tonight that we might understand
[43:12] a little bit more about our inheritance
[43:15] and what you purchased for us naturally
[43:18] we could be some of the wealthiest
[43:20] people in the world but if we didn't
[43:22] know it we could actually live the life
[43:24] of a poer we could be set in on the side
[43:27] of the road as I saw a man yesterday and
[43:30] roll down my window and give him a
[43:32] little money he might have been a crook
[43:34] but I didn't know that for sure but my
[43:36] heart just went out to him and I thought
[43:39] Lord that could be me if it wasn't your
[43:41] grace that could be some of these people
[43:44] sitting here tonight they could be
[43:45] homeless they could be without a car
[43:48] without any friends and it's his son
[43:51] said
[43:52] lonely but you and your grace have
[43:55] smiled upon us tonight father and we
[43:58] want you to know we're so grateful
[44:00] Heavenly Father we bring before you
[44:02] tonight our precious brother Ron Spencer
[44:06] Lord you see what happened to him last
[44:07] night and Lord just in communication
[44:10] brother Tim this evening brother Tim
[44:11] said he was just so just so overwhelmed
[44:14] by this happening because brother Ron
[44:16] was doing so well and seemed to be
[44:17] enjoying the meetings and you you knew
[44:20] all of this of course father what we're
[44:23] praying for our brother just a few
[44:25] moments ago brother Mark text to me and
[44:27] tell me they're just fixing to move him
[44:29] right then so we pray that you'd be with
[44:31] him and as they transfer him to this
[44:34] other Hospital Lord we just ask that the
[44:36] grace of God would be with our brother
[44:38] as they undertake this procedure
[44:39] tomorrow we're believ in you father that
[44:42] you're just going to be with him May the
[44:43] angels of God be there Lord and just may
[44:46] everything go well oh Father we just
[44:49] believe that devil cannot take us until
[44:52] the purpose of God is done amen be with
[44:55] our brother Lord we've seen so many
[44:58] things that's happened to him and out of
[45:00] so many of them one after another after
[45:03] another the testimony of the power of
[45:06] God so we're believing you once again
[45:08] Lord it'll be the same way father I pray
[45:11] for my sister naen you see Lord this
[45:13] need in her body I'm asking you tonight
[45:16] in the name of Jesus that you'd
[45:18] strengthen her father we commit the
[45:20] speaker and the hearers of the word into
[45:23] your divine presence in the name of the
[45:25] Lord Jesus we ask it
[45:27] amen God bless you Saints love you so
[45:30] much so appreciate you tonight you can
[45:32] you can be
[45:34] seated let's turn if you would to to
[45:36] Ruth also chapter 4 verse 7 I love I
[45:41] love parallels and types and anot types
[45:45] and all that in the scripture I love
[45:47] seeing how that God portrayed something
[45:49] in the Old Testament L it left it in
[45:52] mystery form and then would reveal it in
[45:55] the New Testament and then come the last
[45:57] days and even make it more real than it
[46:00] was then and when I read Revelation 5
[46:03] and also Revelation 10 I I so see the
[46:07] book of redemption and the Plan of
[46:09] Redemption of what God had in his mind
[46:12] something that he wanted to accomplish
[46:15] people have read it for many many
[46:17] Millennia of course and they thought
[46:19] they had an understanding and they did
[46:21] they had a partial light of what God was
[46:23] doing but we're living in the day when
[46:25] God has promised according to his word
[46:28] that under the administration of the
[46:29] seventh angel there would not only be
[46:31] healings miracles signs and wonders but
[46:34] there would be an opening of the Gospel
[46:36] an opening of the scriptures that had
[46:38] never been given before I emphasized
[46:40] that to you while ago in reading that
[46:42] that it was a prophet which heard what
[46:47] the the four gospels and the Pauline
[46:49] Epistles did not declare now keep that
[46:52] in mind it was a prophet on the aisle of
[46:56] Pat
[46:57] that caught the unwritten word of God
[47:01] well you see that's the way God chose to
[47:03] write his Bible was with them men now if
[47:07] there's anything that God would want to
[47:09] reveal out of that which is not written
[47:12] in the pages of the scripture then he
[47:14] has one Outlet by which he can do that
[47:17] it is an infallible means and let me
[47:20] explain that to you it is an infallible
[47:23] means you see a prophet is so designed
[47:26] he's unlike me unlike you unlike any
[47:29] other of the fivefold ministry in that
[47:32] God gives him that direct channel of
[47:35] communication that channel is absolutely
[47:39] infallible now I'm going to do my best
[47:41] tonight to preach to you without any
[47:43] mistakes but I know before I even start
[47:47] I'm going to have some I'll either quote
[47:49] something wrong not intentional I'll
[47:51] quote a scripture wrong or a quote wrong
[47:53] or leave out an adverb and I should have
[47:55] used verb or use a noun when I should
[47:57] have used an adjective you know what I'm
[47:59] saying there's there's no perfect sermon
[48:01] I'm not made to when the spirit of God
[48:04] falls on my gift that everything that
[48:07] comes out of my mouth even the order
[48:10] that I say it in is infallible and when
[48:13] a prophet himself is talking without
[48:16] that anointing being on him neither is
[48:18] he he's just like any other man but when
[48:21] the spirit of God moves him in that
[48:24] realm God makes it so that that man
[48:28] speaks the infallible word of God now
[48:31] God had to have it that right that way
[48:34] because God was not going to print the
[48:36] Bible himself in the beginning and hand
[48:38] out Bibles to everybody but God wanted
[48:40] to allocate his word in certain
[48:43] dispensations and he would have prophets
[48:45] and through these ages and the spirit of
[48:48] God would strike them and God would say
[48:51] tell them so and so tell them it's going
[48:52] to rain tell them it's this well what
[48:55] scripture if you'd have been living in
[48:57] the days of Noah and you're a
[48:58] fundamental believer and you want to
[49:00] check Noah by the
[49:02] Bible what scripture would you check in
[49:06] by and what scripture would Noah give
[49:08] you that there is a promise in the word
[49:11] of God for a flood there was no such
[49:14] promise but Noah being a prophet had the
[49:18] ability to catch the unwritten word you
[49:22] understand same in the days of Moses how
[49:25] are you going to cross reference Moses
[49:26] mooses on the Ten Commandments how you
[49:29] going to check Moses out to make sure
[49:32] what Moses is saying by the law by the
[49:35] Torah first five books of Moses how are
[49:37] we going to cross reference Moses with
[49:40] some other writings to make sure what he
[49:43] said was the
[49:45] truth ah you mean you're going to take
[49:47] Moses word for it we're going to take
[49:50] Moses word people have taken Moses word
[49:52] for all these years that God bet him now
[49:55] was any of us there when God wrote on
[49:57] the on the tablets of s of course not
[49:59] yet we took his word for it because we
[50:02] saw God vindicate the man and if God
[50:04] vindicate the man we believe the message
[50:07] that the man said it's quite simple
[50:09] really when you let go of your thinking
[50:11] and it's the same way in the days of
[50:13] Amos and the day days of habac Hagi
[50:15] Zachariah Malachi all those prophets
[50:17] that have been down through the Old
[50:19] Testament same now when we come to the
[50:21] New Testament then that God anointed
[50:24] Paul to write down things that neither
[50:26] man Matthew Mark Luke or John wrote now
[50:29] how are we going to cross reference some
[50:31] of the things that Paul said and check
[50:34] Paul out by the Bible to be able to
[50:37] prove what Paul said was the
[50:39] truth now Paul said that the women are
[50:42] to remain silent in the churches as also
[50:45] saith the law I want you to stand
[50:47] tonight and show me where the law said
[50:52] that you have the
[50:55] opportunity ah
[50:57] now see not only can you not show me
[50:59] that neither can any
[51:02] Theologian because the law doesn't
[51:05] actually say it but because the law did
[51:08] not make an allocation for women priests
[51:12] the law spoke by its silence amen so a
[51:16] prophet can catch the silence part of
[51:20] God and recognize it that that was his
[51:22] program so a prophet can C catch that
[51:26] which is UN written he can catch the
[51:28] silent part of it and he's made to where
[51:31] that God absolutely trusts that channel
[51:35] you see God don't trust me God don't
[51:37] trust the office of a pastor God doesn't
[51:40] trust the office of an evangelist he
[51:43] himself made it this way because I'm not
[51:46] infallible no no is any other office
[51:49] there's only one that is and that's a
[51:51] prophet so then when a prophet speaks in
[51:55] the name of the Lord that is not the
[51:57] prophet standing there repeating the
[51:59] name of the Lord but it actually is the
[52:02] Lord himself now whenever that comes in
[52:06] that's why God would trust that and give
[52:08] that only to just a handful of men in
[52:12] comparison to the population that's
[52:14] lived on the earth now think about it
[52:16] how many true Vindicated prophets that
[52:19] there have been since Moses on down my
[52:22] goodness it'd be very very few in
[52:24] comparison to the populace of the Earth
[52:26] that has lived on there since the
[52:28] beginning of time to the end but God
[52:30] knew that he would not need Millions
[52:32] times millions of prophets he would only
[52:35] need really relatively a small number
[52:38] because he would be able to cover the
[52:40] span of time by which they would
[52:43] prophesy and everything that the people
[52:45] would need would be under the
[52:48] dispensations given to those few men
[52:51] is't that awesome and then God would
[52:53] have others that would come out from
[52:55] under them and they would preach what
[52:57] they had to say pointing back to what
[53:00] those men with that infallible gift have
[53:03] now you see the problem that ministry
[53:05] will have is that they get to a spot to
[53:08] where they feel so confident in thems
[53:12] that they step over the infallibility of
[53:14] the word and they said well you know the
[53:16] prophet almost said that and I'm sure
[53:18] that's what he meant I'm I'm sure that
[53:20] if he would have said something else he
[53:22] would have went ahead and said that
[53:24] that's when men become too conf
[53:27] of their own gift and they don't re
[53:29] recognize that they do not have that
[53:32] power of infallibility I'm sure you're
[53:35] you're familiar are you not familiar
[53:36] with a quote in the church age book that
[53:39] the power of infallibility would return
[53:43] in the last days now it's not going to
[53:45] come back to everybody it's not going to
[53:48] come to every preacher it's not going to
[53:50] come to every Pastor it's not going to
[53:52] come to Le no but it's going to come to
[53:54] the one that needs to have it which will
[53:57] be the seventh angel of Revelation 10 so
[54:01] then if a prophet on the aisle of patmas
[54:04] heard the seven Thunders and was about
[54:06] to ride them and the voice said don't do
[54:08] it then who do you figure in that office
[54:12] will be able to catch the revelation of
[54:16] what the seven Thunders heard wrote
[54:18] rather said on the aisle of patmas would
[54:22] it be a pastor would it be a teacher
[54:24] would it be a a songwriter would it be a
[54:27] Sunday school teacher a youth
[54:30] leader who do you all figure it will be
[54:33] what office talk to me now what office
[54:37] will it be do I have that Authority I do
[54:41] not does any other Pastor any evangelist
[54:43] Any teacher no don't you understand God
[54:46] must entrust that alone to one who has
[54:50] the ability to be a Seer to catch the
[54:53] unwritten word you see a prophet is not
[54:55] just one that interprets what's already
[54:58] written and he does do that that's part
[55:00] of his credentials he interprets that
[55:02] which is already written but he also is
[55:05] so made that he can catch that which is
[55:08] not even written thus far and God can
[55:12] speak that through him and it is the
[55:16] true word of God I I find it so amazing
[55:19] though how many people that say they
[55:21] believe the message of the hour that do
[55:23] not believe that point I just gave you
[55:26] oh I check out preachers sometimes with
[55:28] that one because it stumbles even
[55:30] preachers and you realize they really
[55:33] don't believe the prophet either they
[55:35] think he's like a commentator he's like
[55:37] a Luther or a Weist or a Wickliffe or
[55:41] some of those men Adam CL John Wesley
[55:44] Charles Wesley just men that wrote A
[55:46] Commentary of the Bible and then any of
[55:48] us have the right to question them we
[55:50] don't even know what a prophet is if we
[55:52] believe that's the way brother Bram was
[55:55] but a true prophet of God that is part
[55:57] of his credentials not because I say so
[56:00] but because that's what God identified
[56:03] them being look in the book of
[56:06] Deuteronomy sometime and you get a
[56:07] chance and the Lord said that I will
[56:09] raise them up a prophet Moses
[56:11] prophesying it and said the Lord said
[56:13] that he would raise up a prophet like an
[56:15] unto me and you will say unto me how
[56:18] shall we know if a man is truly a
[56:20] prophet he said that man that speaks in
[56:23] my name and what he says does not come
[56:25] to pass you will know I have not sent
[56:28] that man but if I have sent a man that
[56:31] is a prophet and he speaks in my name
[56:34] then fear that man fear that man because
[56:40] what he is saying is not from him but
[56:43] it's from the Lord
[56:45] himself now whenever God was going to
[56:49] then reveal the mystery of Revelation 10
[56:54] now there must be a a human a human
[56:57] counterpart on the earth that'll be able
[57:00] to match the revelatory grace of God of
[57:04] what God wants to do so God just can't
[57:06] pour it out among among a whole big
[57:09] bunch of people and you'll get a little
[57:11] and you'll get a little and you'll get a
[57:12] little and you'll get a little and you
[57:14] and you and you and then we all come
[57:16] together try to figure it all out you
[57:18] talking about a mess that's what
[57:21] denominations do well I I feel this and
[57:23] I I feel that God could never trust his
[57:26] word to that he's going to finish up the
[57:29] ages the same way he started them years
[57:32] ago with the power of
[57:35] infallibility given back to the only one
[57:38] it could be given to there is no one
[57:41] else that ever lived in time that could
[57:44] have ever fulfilled Malachi 4 but the
[57:48] one man who had his name written there
[57:51] somebody say Amen now to me this is why
[57:54] it's so important that we never never
[57:56] ever leave this message because it holds
[58:01] and contains the very ending of the
[58:04] mystery under the administration of the
[58:06] seventh angel for when the seventh angel
[58:09] shall begin to sound then should the
[58:11] mystery of God be finished not before it
[58:15] was not finished in the days of Paul now
[58:18] how wonderful and what a great man of
[58:20] God that Paul was but the mystery of God
[58:23] was not finished Paul never preached
[58:25] about the Seven Seals he never knew
[58:27] nothing about them if he did he didn't
[58:29] ride them we don't find nowhere in the
[58:31] Pauling Epistles where he mentioned the
[58:33] seven Thunders one time he never
[58:35] mentioned the Seven Seals do you
[58:37] understand when John catches the
[58:39] revelation of the Seven Seals on the
[58:40] aisle of panas all of the apostles were
[58:43] dead and
[58:45] buried their theophanies they were
[58:47] living inside their theophanies in the
[58:49] sixth Dimension Paul was already gone
[58:51] Peter was gone James and John
[58:52] Bartholomew was gone all of the original
[58:54] 12 were already gone they never preached
[58:57] the seals they never knew anything about
[58:59] the seals or the seven Thunders why it
[59:02] was not their
[59:04] age so what is God going to do is God
[59:07] going to trust it then after the last
[59:09] prophet that many people think on the
[59:11] Earth was Paul so if the last Gentile
[59:14] Prophet was going to die how is God ever
[59:16] going to get them Thunders which was
[59:18] heard by a prophet how is he ever going
[59:21] to get him back on the earth unless he's
[59:23] got a counterpart to that in the last AG
[59:27] so who will it be won't be a pastor
[59:29] won't be a t evangelist it won't be a
[59:31] money loving preacher it won't be a
[59:33] compromising preacher it'll have to be a
[59:35] prophet on the earth with the power of
[59:40] infallibility then God will give to him
[59:44] and it will be totally scriptural now
[59:46] remember no true prophet of God is ever
[59:49] going to say something contrary to what
[59:51] another Prophet has said and this is why
[59:53] God CHS this way because it's actually
[59:56] himself so it was God using Amos God
[59:59] using habac God using Zephaniah God
[1:00:02] using zachari so whenever years ago
[1:00:05] whenever they put the Bible you know
[1:00:06] through all this great software and able
[1:00:09] to come out on the other side and they
[1:00:11] attributed the whole book being to the
[1:00:13] power of one being because there was
[1:00:15] thoughts and phrases and things that was
[1:00:17] run through the entire Cannon of
[1:00:19] scripture and it wasn't like all these
[1:00:21] different authors it was all put
[1:00:22] together but somehow in their computer
[1:00:24] science they come up is one thing that
[1:00:27] there's one being behind all them
[1:00:28] different books and they're written over
[1:00:31] different spans of time different
[1:00:32] nations on the earth different men why
[1:00:35] but one man one being almighty God was
[1:00:39] the one who inspired them
[1:00:40] all well don't you understand if you and
[1:00:43] I get the Holy Ghost that same God
[1:00:45] living inside of us he'll say Amen to
[1:00:47] his word so he won't make you say amen
[1:00:50] and then make me mad make you aggravated
[1:00:53] make you happy if we've all got the Holy
[1:00:55] Ghost we've got to say Amen to the word
[1:00:57] of God why because it's the same author
[1:01:00] that inspired them to write it so then
[1:01:03] God knew that there would be a
[1:01:05] reservation of his word that would be
[1:01:07] left in the last days why because we're
[1:01:09] really going to need something in this
[1:01:11] age the power of darkness is going to be
[1:01:14] released against the people of God like
[1:01:16] never before and the chains of Darkness
[1:01:18] are so pressing out of the regions of
[1:01:20] the lost and remember the K the lids
[1:01:23] been tore off the K as he told us in 19
[1:01:25] 1961 and many times we see the opening
[1:01:28] of the seals was only the Angelic side
[1:01:30] and the bright holy heavenly side but
[1:01:33] there was also another one remember if
[1:01:35] the seals come open then we know that
[1:01:38] it's the answer to the prophecy of the
[1:01:40] Old Testament that when the the powers
[1:01:42] of Hell Breaks Loose that what will God
[1:01:45] do when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:01:48] the spirit of the Lord will lift up a
[1:01:50] standard against him so if the seals
[1:01:53] come open and the revealing of the sun
[1:01:55] th ERS what was that it was a standard
[1:01:59] of God in the last days that was being
[1:02:02] raised against an evil that had never
[1:02:06] been manifested before in such a way is
[1:02:09] that right so God knew that this last
[1:02:12] day bride was going to face things that
[1:02:15] no other age faed now I granted the days
[1:02:17] of the martyrdom and many of those
[1:02:19] things they went through was absolutely
[1:02:21] terrible but our battles are somewhat
[1:02:23] different the church would go through a
[1:02:25] cycle of hardship and then it would get
[1:02:27] better and then they go through it again
[1:02:29] and it would get better but with us it's
[1:02:32] every day of our life it's in every you
[1:02:35] know it's trouble around you everywhere
[1:02:38] it's political it's trouble in your home
[1:02:40] trouble in your family trouble in the
[1:02:42] church trouble everywhere come on
[1:02:45] somebody say amen and it's like there's
[1:02:47] no reprieve once you get over one thing
[1:02:50] and you finally get over that three more
[1:02:52] sticks its head up and you get over them
[1:02:55] three and four four more come and five
[1:02:56] more and six more but I want to tell
[1:02:59] hell tonight we are more than
[1:03:02] conquerors we're not survivors I said we
[1:03:05] are more than
[1:03:07] conquerors but how how is that so how is
[1:03:11] that so because with the releasing of
[1:03:14] the mystery and people just take that as
[1:03:16] oh well that's just a bunch of stuff
[1:03:18] it's just a bunch of terms if that's all
[1:03:20] it is to you then they've never been
[1:03:22] revealed to you personally you see when
[1:03:25] God gives gives a promise that's the
[1:03:27] intellectual side of it and it can
[1:03:30] produce an intellectual Faith but with
[1:03:32] every promise comes a power to release
[1:03:36] the manifestation so you're able to live
[1:03:39] it don't you understand when God makes
[1:03:41] promise is known there's an element
[1:03:44] about him oh yes that's right praise the
[1:03:45] Lord that's wonderful that's good but if
[1:03:47] God don't release a power with that
[1:03:50] promise we'll never be able to make it
[1:03:51] ours we pack it under our arm we
[1:03:54] memorize it in her head and we debate
[1:03:56] and argue about it what good does that
[1:03:58] do unless the power of that promise
[1:04:01] comes in our life my many of us have
[1:04:04] quoted the scripture greater is he that
[1:04:06] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:04:09] and we can quote that and not have an
[1:04:11] ounce of victory in our life well don't
[1:04:14] we have the promise we do we've
[1:04:16] committed it to memory we may have it
[1:04:18] underline yell and one Bible and green
[1:04:20] and another Bible and blue and another
[1:04:22] Bible but apparently the power of that
[1:04:24] promise has not been released to us if
[1:04:27] it had then whenever the Devil Comes
[1:04:30] against us we would stand right there
[1:04:32] flat foot and say let me tell you
[1:04:33] something devil you ain't got power over
[1:04:36] me you ain't got power to make me do
[1:04:39] wrong you ain't got no power to force me
[1:04:42] to do nothing I know who I am I'm a son
[1:04:45] or daughter of God I'm filled with the
[1:04:47] Holy Ghost you can't make me lie you
[1:04:50] can't make me do nothing wrong you ain't
[1:04:52] got no power over me you are a blood
[1:04:56] and I'm calling your blood on the basis
[1:04:59] of the revealed word of this hour get
[1:05:02] behind me
[1:05:08] sat oh but as long as it's just a good
[1:05:12] promise you go ahead and do wrong
[1:05:15] anyway and it feel like a dog cuz you
[1:05:18] done
[1:05:18] it why cuz the power of the promise has
[1:05:21] not been revealed to you but when it's
[1:05:23] opened up to you and you realize you
[1:05:25] don't what the devil ain't got no power
[1:05:27] to make you do anything friends get this
[1:05:29] out of your head that he's an all
[1:05:32] powerful being that can make you do
[1:05:34] whatever he wants to if he can you're
[1:05:37] demon
[1:05:39] possessed if Satan controls you and you
[1:05:43] have no power over him you're not even
[1:05:46] saved much less got the Holy
[1:05:48] Ghost come on somebody that ain't the
[1:05:51] way it is he's only trying to convince
[1:05:54] you he ain't got enough power to even
[1:05:57] make you lie he can't make you steal he
[1:06:00] can't make you commit adultery he can't
[1:06:03] make you pick up your phone and look on
[1:06:05] your phone at something filthy and
[1:06:08] ungodly he cannot make you quit church
[1:06:11] he cannot make you go to hell I wish
[1:06:13] somebody would preach with me tonight he
[1:06:15] ain't got enough power to do it and you
[1:06:18] need to recognize you are facing a
[1:06:22] defeated enemy he has no power power
[1:06:26] over the Church of the Living
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:41] God so let's look at the
[1:06:45] ceremony of the
[1:06:49] shoe the
[1:06:53] ceremony of the shoe
[1:06:59] I want you to notice that Jesus had one
[1:07:01] foot on the sea and another foot on the
[1:07:06] land I if you've ever noticed it in your
[1:07:08] Bible or not shoes the word Sho or shoes
[1:07:13] is not mentioned in the Garden of
[1:07:17] Eden or in the Book of
[1:07:23] Genesis but choose down through time
[1:07:26] after the dispensation changed and man
[1:07:29] was placed out then the word shoes the
[1:07:33] first time it's shown in the Bible is
[1:07:35] when God told Moses to take his shoes
[1:07:40] off so shoes can be a symbol of what
[1:07:44] you're fixing to do or where you're
[1:07:47] fixing to
[1:07:49] go it's also a symbol of
[1:07:52] power and possession you can can also be
[1:07:56] a symbol of
[1:07:57] captivity it can be a symbol of
[1:08:00] transfer of position property and
[1:08:05] Authority notice in Ruth 47 now this was
[1:08:08] a manner in former time in Israel
[1:08:11] concerning redeeming and concerning
[1:08:15] changing concerning redeeming and
[1:08:19] concerning changing for to confirm all
[1:08:23] things a man plucked off his
[1:08:27] shoe and gave it to his
[1:08:30] neighbor this was a
[1:08:33] testimony in Israel therefore the
[1:08:36] Kinsman said unto Boaz buy it for
[1:08:39] thee so he drew
[1:08:42] off his
[1:08:44] shoe now the Bible of course written by
[1:08:48] the same
[1:08:49] offer now people you know may wonder
[1:08:53] where did the prophet get all these
[1:08:54] types and one to where he got this and
[1:08:56] one to where he got that he was in real
[1:08:59] close fellowship with the
[1:09:02] author so you can see why that a prophet
[1:09:05] would have such insight into the channel
[1:09:08] of that forth submission you see what a
[1:09:10] prophet is is a window to the
[1:09:12] supernatural so even from Adam on down
[1:09:15] we had a little excerpts by which God
[1:09:18] opened up the dimensions and we were
[1:09:21] able to look at them for just like a
[1:09:23] moment and then back out but in this age
[1:09:27] God allowed us because this is the age
[1:09:29] of the homegoing and God wanted to
[1:09:32] familiarize his Rapture people with
[1:09:35] what's fixing to take place he allowed
[1:09:38] the dimensions to be opened up so we
[1:09:41] could familiarize oursel with where we
[1:09:44] are
[1:09:45] going so he allowed the prophet to be
[1:09:48] able to speak to us some of the things
[1:09:51] that he saw now maybe Jeremiah saw him
[1:09:53] but he never recorded maybe Ezekiel s
[1:09:55] and never recorded them but God allowed
[1:09:57] the prophet in this day to be able to go
[1:09:59] into those dimensions and then come back
[1:10:02] and say I saw this I saw that this was
[1:10:05] that and that was that and that was that
[1:10:07] and then we look into until it's like oh
[1:10:09] my oh wow what in the world so when God
[1:10:12] created and light matter time science
[1:10:15] where the unbeliever goes where the
[1:10:16] believer goes and where God is the seven
[1:10:18] dimensions were the first four light
[1:10:20] matter time and science the elements
[1:10:23] become to where that are natural like
[1:10:25] might matter time science breaks in from
[1:10:28] the fourth dimension into the realm of
[1:10:30] invisible now the invisible can come
[1:10:32] into the other three which is what
[1:10:35] happened in the form of demons and
[1:10:36] things sicknesses and diseases so a
[1:10:39] prophet is able to go into the fourth
[1:10:42] dimension in that realm and see
[1:10:45] Yesterday Today Tomorrow a thousand
[1:10:49] years or a million years whenever it is
[1:10:51] so he's broke broken out of time into
[1:10:55] that that Dimension and he can be able
[1:10:57] to declare things that had never been
[1:10:59] declared before and then he would come
[1:11:01] back down out of that real and said I
[1:11:03] saw this and had a scribe if you
[1:11:05] couldn't write in that write it down and
[1:11:07] I I saw that and and I saw
[1:11:09] that so when ever God wanted to open it
[1:11:13] up to us in this day and then in that
[1:11:15] realm demons were talking and they've
[1:11:17] been doing this for thousands of years
[1:11:20] they communicated with each other but we
[1:11:23] just didn't know it but in the fourth
[1:11:25] dimension he allowed the prophet say
[1:11:27] you're praying for a person with cancer
[1:11:29] and another person sting back there with
[1:11:31] another cancer and he' saw this
[1:11:32] communication Channel between these two
[1:11:34] demons and there'd be a dark Street go
[1:11:36] from this person to that one and he
[1:11:38] would hear them can't you hear them
[1:11:40] can't you hear them they're saying keep
[1:11:43] them from believing keep them from
[1:11:46] believing keep them from believing
[1:11:50] unbelief is gathering and faith is
[1:11:52] gathering he said how will the outcome
[1:11:55] go
[1:11:55] depend on which way you believe now you
[1:11:59] imagine them demons all these thousands
[1:12:01] of years had their line of communication
[1:12:05] that was totally shut off to the human
[1:12:07] race so they were able to talk and
[1:12:10] communicate we never heard them we never
[1:12:12] know nothing about it but all of a
[1:12:15] sudden God got a code talker on the
[1:12:19] earth so this code talker broke into
[1:12:22] their language and this for the first
[1:12:25] time it was made known what they look
[1:12:28] like and then there would be people that
[1:12:30] would come up and say oh I I see you're
[1:12:32] a Believer you're a Christian I want you
[1:12:34] to notice if you've ever looked at this
[1:12:35] in discernment he never like on a woman
[1:12:37] said I know you're a Christian because
[1:12:39] your dress is really really long and you
[1:12:41] know how ready toong on this but he said
[1:12:43] every time that he' identify him as a
[1:12:45] Believer it was by the light that
[1:12:48] emanated from within their soul now you
[1:12:51] see I can't see it tonight and you all
[1:12:53] can't say it I don't don't imagine but
[1:12:55] even around me and around you there's
[1:12:57] this pulsation either of light or of
[1:13:00] Darkness that emanates from the soul you
[1:13:02] follow me so far and that's something
[1:13:04] that's always been there since man was
[1:13:06] on the earth and yet it was closed off
[1:13:09] totally to us so God had one that could
[1:13:12] break into it and he wouldn't just look
[1:13:14] at the length of a woman's hair and the
[1:13:15] length of her dress and so on but he
[1:13:17] would communicate by light and
[1:13:21] darkness oh hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:13:26] and then when God wanted to write then
[1:13:29] some of these things in the Old
[1:13:30] Testament he said now part of it I'm
[1:13:32] going to make real plain but a lot of it
[1:13:34] I'm going to leave it to where that the
[1:13:36] scholarly and the wisdom and the proud
[1:13:39] and all them they'll never be able to
[1:13:42] catch it if they won't humble themsel
[1:13:45] and listen to one that I vindicate you
[1:13:48] see people totally missed that part even
[1:13:50] today that God wants to humiliate this
[1:13:53] age and God could have chose a a Harvard
[1:13:56] guy he could have chose a guy with so
[1:13:58] many degrees behind his name we could
[1:14:00] have wallpapered this whole wall with it
[1:14:02] but instead God chose a simple
[1:14:06] Kian praise the Lord so he took
[1:14:10] something that would appeared foolish in
[1:14:11] the eyes of the world and he would
[1:14:13] confound the wise and he would hear
[1:14:16] things that had been kept secret since
[1:14:18] the foundation of the world by Vision
[1:14:21] one night he was standing there
[1:14:22] preaching and at the end of the service
[1:14:25] when he got done preaching the Lord God
[1:14:27] let him see Adam and Eve in the Garden
[1:14:30] of Eden and he swatched Adam and Eve as
[1:14:33] they walked out of the Garden of Eden he
[1:14:36] comes back the next night and he said
[1:14:38] the service at the end of the service he
[1:14:40] said I I was so carried away and he said
[1:14:43] I saw Adam take Eve by the hand and I
[1:14:47] saw her walk out some of you wonder how
[1:14:49] he knew she had blonde hair and blue
[1:14:53] eyes well if you can see it in a vision
[1:14:57] well Hallelujah so what did God do God
[1:15:00] opened it up what if God would do that
[1:15:02] just to let him see him physically what
[1:15:05] about what laid in the word which would
[1:15:08] help give us a rapturing face that no
[1:15:11] other age ever had why they didn't need
[1:15:15] it Paul did not need to preach the
[1:15:18] revelation of the Seven Seals or the
[1:15:21] seven Thunders his age did not need to
[1:15:24] understand that oh but don't you
[1:15:26] understand first second third fourth
[1:15:28] fifth sixth and then God reveals the
[1:15:30] Thunders right at the very top of the
[1:15:32] pyramid and he sends the seventh angel
[1:15:34] with a restoration message and whenever
[1:15:37] those Li Believers on the earth those
[1:15:40] living ones when they catch that
[1:15:42] Revelation and the time rolls around and
[1:15:45] they see who they are then the Rapture
[1:15:48] will go their FA rising to the Capstone
[1:15:51] level will call the dead out of the
[1:15:54] grave
[1:15:55] it will release the saints of God from
[1:15:58] the sixth Dimension the entire body
[1:16:01] cemented together from the top
[1:16:06] down woo
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:12] Hallelujah so you see we've got places
[1:16:15] to walk we've got places yet to
[1:16:21] tr notice this so in Bible times the
[1:16:24] foot symbolize power or possession
[1:16:27] Deuteronomy
[1:16:29] 1:36 save Caleb the son of jafan he
[1:16:32] shall see it unto him all I give the
[1:16:34] land that he
[1:16:38] has Oh you mean it wasn't enough to
[1:16:40] believe
[1:16:43] it oh now what if he said I agreus with
[1:16:47] the Landis I agree us with the propheus
[1:16:51] but I'm just not going to walk us what
[1:16:53] if you ain't going to walk us you ain't
[1:16:55] going to get nothing
[1:16:56] this come on Saints it's the same way
[1:16:59] you and I God's given already done paid
[1:17:02] the price for Divine Healing but you
[1:17:05] will fight for every healing you ever
[1:17:07] get from God if it ain't no more than a
[1:17:09] headache or a toothache you'll fight to
[1:17:11] get it and then you'll fight several
[1:17:13] days afterwards to keep it well come on
[1:17:16] because God knows his kids are Fighters
[1:17:20] he knows he don't have to Baby him
[1:17:21] around a bunch of denomination or
[1:17:23] whatever more but he knows they'll fight
[1:17:26] through hell they'll walk away from
[1:17:28] family members they'll walk away from
[1:17:30] church members it don't make no
[1:17:31] difference what they've got to do they
[1:17:33] are ordained of God they are tied to the
[1:17:36] original
[1:17:38] [Applause]
[1:17:42] altar oh my God said I'm going to give
[1:17:45] it the land to him he has trodden upon
[1:17:47] it and to his children because he has
[1:17:50] holy follow the lord look what you
[1:17:52] impart to your children
[1:17:55] you parents tried this

[1:18:27] people you're a small people you the
[1:18:29] smallest people on the Earth but God

[1:18:34] just to remind you of how little you are
[1:18:36] well he likes to do us the same way it's
[1:18:38] an amazing how God can remind us of how
[1:18:40] little we are how powerful we are in the
[1:18:42] very same verse but you know what he
[1:18:44] wants us to do he wants us to realize

[1:19:07] with the Holy Ghost in me I'll face any
[1:19:10] of them that God allows to come before
[1:19:12] me and I'll tell you I will overcome
[1:19:15] them why he'd never let them come
[1:19:17] against me if I

[1:20:35] Abraham praise the
[1:20:37] Lord Joshua chapter 1:3 every place that
[1:20:43] the soul of your foot shall tread upon
[1:20:45] that have I given unto you as I said
[1:20:49] unto Moses and you know what's sad about
[1:20:50] that verse we just read in Deuteronomy
[1:20:52] 11:24 they never
[1:20:56] never
[1:20:57] never obtained this
[1:21:00] promise it has never been done even in
[1:21:03] the days of
[1:21:05] Solomon but it will be in the
[1:21:10] Millennium and then when I think of them
[1:21:13] I think about
[1:21:14] us and I think so what promises brother
[1:21:17] Pete has God allocated to us in the
[1:21:20] message in the end time how much of our
[1:21:23] land brother Larry will never be
[1:21:30] conquered oh Lord but I'm glad it's
[1:21:34] separated you see when we're looking at
[1:21:36] this we're talking about n National
[1:21:40] possession but some of them people got
[1:21:42] every inch of ground God described to
[1:21:44] them because they had an individual
[1:21:47] possession as a group as a move of God
[1:21:50] we're identified as a message but as an
[1:21:53] individual I'm getting all my property
[1:21:56] even if you don't want all yours come on
[1:21:59] somebody brother Dave you want yours you
[1:22:01] can get it if I don't go on you can get
[1:22:03] everything belongs to you come on
[1:22:04] somebody why because God makes it so
[1:22:08] that as an individual you will not be
[1:22:10] bound down by my laziness or me Bound by
[1:22:13] yours but I can rise up and say Lord God
[1:22:17] you promised it it's mine and I can tell
[1:22:19] you about Caleb I can tell you about
[1:22:21] others even though many of those other
[1:22:23] people never forgot their full
[1:22:25] inheritance O CB walked up there and
[1:22:27] said give me this mountain God's Prophet
[1:22:30] said I could have it I'm just as able
[1:22:32] today to fight I'm able to go out and
[1:22:35] come back in glory to God he said I'm 40
[1:22:38] years older but let me have this
[1:22:40] mountain where's that devil at let me
[1:22:42] have him let me at
[1:22:46] him oh
[1:22:48] my notice Joshua
[1:22:51] 3:13 and it shall come to pass his soon
[1:22:54] soon as the souls of the
[1:22:56] feet of the priest that bear the Ark of
[1:22:59] the Lord of all the Earth shall rest in
[1:23:02] the waters of Jordan that the Waters of
[1:23:04] Jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[1:23:07] that came down from above and they shall
[1:23:10] stand upon a
[1:23:12] heap
[1:23:15] Hallelujah so what if they would have
[1:23:17] just thought about
[1:23:23] it
[1:23:29] what are you trying to do move the
[1:23:30] Jordan back God didn't say
[1:23:33] thoughts he said
[1:23:37] feet
[1:23:39] Glory feet so Footprints truly
[1:23:43] means
[1:23:45] possession notice in Joshua 10:24 he
[1:23:48] came to pass when they brought out those
[1:23:51] kings under
[1:23:53] Joshua
[1:23:55] that Joshua call for all the men of
[1:23:57] Israel and said it to the captains of
[1:23:59] the men of War which went with him come
[1:24:04] near put your
[1:24:08] feet upon the
[1:24:10] necks of these
[1:24:16] Kings Joshua said come on boys that
[1:24:19] ain't just me it ain't just a hierarchy
[1:24:22] but I want some of you fighting guys
[1:24:24] come on up
[1:24:25] here so they humbled them Kings and them
[1:24:29] old boys come over and

[1:24:38] put him on the jebusites I'm going to
[1:24:40] put them on the H tight what did that
[1:24:42] mean Footprints meant possession you see
[1:24:46] what you had your foot on top of you was
[1:24:49] claiming as yours so what is that that
[1:24:51] angel of Revelation 10 if he's got one
[1:24:54] foot on land and the other on sea what's
[1:24:58] he doing he's claiming it back
[1:25:00] Hallelujah he's claiming it back this is
[1:25:03] for me and my children I'm going to

[1:25:15] Bride it's time for the marriage of the
[1:25:18] laamb and the bride's got to get herself
[1:25:21] ready and my feet upon these two real
[1:25:24] say the dead shall come out of the Sea
[1:25:27] and the dead shall come up out of the
[1:25:29] earth Hallelujah see you won't be able
[1:25:33] to hold them Earth you won't be able to
[1:25:35] hold them I claim every one of
[1:25:39] [Applause]

[1:27:23] the Lord
[1:27:25] put them under the
[1:27:27] souls of his
[1:27:30] fate you see the dispensation changed
[1:27:34] with
[1:27:34] David the reason Solomon didn't have to
[1:27:37] fight any wars was David done burn all
[1:27:40] the rest of them up he done killed

[1:28:41] [Applause]
[1:28:46] Life Psalms
[1:28:48] 86 thou mest him to have dominion
[1:28:51] talking about men over the works of thy
[1:28:53] hands thou Hast put all things under his
[1:28:59] feet Ezekiel
[1:29:02] 43:7 and he said unto me son of man the
[1:29:05] place of my Throne now notice the
[1:29:09] Millennium this is Ezekiel setting the
[1:29:12] Millennium and the place of The
[1:29:16] Souls of my
[1:29:19] feet don't you understand why the
[1:29:22] Rapture the Lord Jesus
[1:29:24] will never touch the
[1:29:28] Earth we will meet him in the middle of
[1:29:31] the
[1:29:32] air once them precious feet lifted on
[1:29:36] the Mount of
[1:29:38] Ascension his Corporal feet will not
[1:29:41] touch the Earth again in this way until
[1:29:45] we come together with him in Revelation
[1:29:48] 19 to the battle of
[1:29:51] Armageddon I find it so amazing that
[1:29:54] Russia is talking about Armageddon
[1:29:56] Germany is talking about Armageddon
[1:29:58] Poland's talking about Armageddon the
[1:30:00] United States is talking about
[1:30:02] Armageddon ah if it's that close that
[1:30:06] they're thinking that it's near I wonder
[1:30:08] how much closer the Rapture is for
[1:30:12] us notice this in Malachi 4:3 you shall
[1:30:16] tread down the
[1:30:19] wicked now remember the Millennium is
[1:30:21] approaching now you should tread down
[1:30:24] the wicked for they shall be
[1:30:27] ashes under the SES of your feet in the
[1:30:32] day that I do this sayith the Lord of
[1:30:33] hosts Hebrews 10:12 but this man after
[1:30:36] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[1:30:38] forever sat down on the right hand of
[1:30:40] God from henceforth
[1:30:42] expecting his enemies be
[1:30:46] made his foottoo
[1:30:52] wow so this is a promise a Messianic
[1:30:56] Psalm that David said Christ's enemies
[1:31:00] will be made his foottoo
[1:31:07] and you don't when you look at it I
[1:31:10] think that's what we're longing for when
[1:31:13] mortality will be swallowed up sickness
[1:31:17] disease trouble and God will have it
[1:31:20] subject to what his feet
[1:31:26] which is his
[1:31:29] body now notice sacred
[1:31:32] rights have also been declared by
[1:31:36] shoes Exodus 3:5 and he said draw not
[1:31:39] hither put off thy shoes from off thy
[1:31:43] feet for the place whereon thou
[1:31:46] standest is Holy Ground so shoes are
[1:31:51] necessary only on the
[1:31:54] Earth because the Earth has become
[1:31:56] filthy and
[1:31:58] polluted so it separates your
[1:32:01] contact so when God would have them to
[1:32:04] remove their shoes they were leaving
[1:32:07] their
[1:32:09] unworthiness their dirt their FS as it
[1:32:12] were outside the door and walking into
[1:32:15] the sanctuary of Adonai hell
[1:32:22] Barefoot you see remember moving them
[1:32:24] symbolically with showing that they're
[1:32:27] separating the thing which is catching
[1:32:29] all the contagion and the dust and the
[1:32:33] dirt Joshua 5:15 the captain of the
[1:32:36] Lord's host said unto Joshua loose thy
[1:32:40] shoe from off thy
[1:32:42] foot for the place where on thou
[1:32:45] standest is Holy and Joshua did
[1:32:49] so so here's an emanating presence
[1:32:52] coming from the captain of the Lord's
[1:32:53] host
[1:32:54] he tells Yoshua you won't need them
[1:32:56] shoes to separate you from the filth of
[1:32:58] the earth walk into my presence and I
[1:33:01] will sanctify
[1:33:03] you glory to
[1:33:07] God hallelujah 2 Samuel 15:30 and David
[1:33:12] went up by the ascent of the Mount of
[1:33:14] olet and wept as he went up and he had
[1:33:17] his head covered and he went
[1:33:22] Barefoot you realize some Churches still
[1:33:24] do this today some people still do it
[1:33:28] being Mexico City several years ago
[1:33:29] brother George Smith and we saw
[1:33:31] thousands times thousands of them as
[1:33:34] they was doing penants and they were
[1:33:35] crawling up this this mountain it was
[1:33:37] some type of Saint something or another
[1:33:39] and women with dresses on blood all over
[1:33:43] them steps as their knees were being
[1:33:45] tore on them rocks most of them
[1:33:48] barefooted left the shoes down at the
[1:33:50] bottom cuz they felt like they were on
[1:33:52] Holy Ground
[1:33:54] oh my now I'm me bring a stark contrast
[1:33:58] to that watch this in the trial sermon
[1:34:00] brother B said one night a little camp
[1:34:02] where I was fishing way back in the
[1:34:03] mountains I was laying back there and
[1:34:05] about 3:00 in the morning I seen a light
[1:34:07] coming I'd just been reading the Bible
[1:34:09] and I thought it was somebody coming
[1:34:10] shining through a KN hole or a lantern
[1:34:12] or something and it was way in the
[1:34:14] wilderness and I thought somebody was
[1:34:15] coming up the light was on the
[1:34:17] floor and it spread greater and greater
[1:34:20] and I heard of somebody walking and when
[1:34:22] it did it was a
[1:34:26] man he was
[1:34:30] barefooted so here come this Angel down
[1:34:33] on the
[1:34:34] earth and he didn't have no shoes
[1:34:42] on if that's the requirement for heaven
[1:34:44] I'm definitely going have to be
[1:34:46] changed are you talking about one
[1:34:48] tender-footed preacher I am
[1:34:51] Tenderfoot he was barefooted he had hair
[1:34:54] to his shoulders had on a robe and it
[1:34:57] like have scared me to
[1:35:00] death he said don't fear I'm sent from
[1:35:03] the presence of the Lord God to tell you
[1:35:05] you procure your life don't try to get
[1:35:07] from these things this is your calling
[1:35:09] God will be sending you to different
[1:35:11] places all over the world to pray for
[1:35:13] the sick and if you'll get the people to
[1:35:14] believe and be sincere nothing will
[1:35:16] stand before the
[1:35:19] prayer now what I found amazing was when
[1:35:22] I was studying this
[1:35:24] when the prophet is carried beyond the
[1:35:26] curtain of
[1:35:29] time oh I can see those women so
[1:35:32] pretty with long hair weigh down their
[1:35:35] back and long skirts way
[1:35:38] down they was
[1:35:43] barefooted there wasn't walking on a
[1:35:45] contaminated Earth any
[1:35:47] longer but these saints were in the
[1:35:49] sixth
[1:35:52] Dimension that didn't need
[1:35:56] shoes praise the
[1:35:59] Lord the significance of no shoe shows
[1:36:02] there's no dirt nothing they're picking
[1:36:05] up that would separate
[1:36:08] them I seen them men with shaggy hair
[1:36:11] around their neck red heads blackheads
[1:36:14] all different colors they were throwing
[1:36:16] their arms around and I could feel them
[1:36:19] I felt their hands God is my judge in
[1:36:22] the sacred book I could feel them just
[1:36:24] the same as I feel my hands on my face
[1:36:26] and they were throwing their arms around
[1:36:28] me no sensation of women like it would
[1:36:30] be now I don't care how holy you are who
[1:36:32] you are what kind of a Preacher you are
[1:36:34] preach or whatever you might be there's
[1:36:36] no man you can let a woman throw her
[1:36:38] arms around you without having a human
[1:36:40] sensation and the church said that's
[1:36:43] exactly the truth but brother when you
[1:36:45] pass beyond here and Yonder it ain't the
[1:36:48] way there oh my it's impossible it's all
[1:36:51] love everything is a real brother
[1:36:53] everything's real sister there's no
[1:36:55] death no sorrow no jealousy
[1:36:57] nothing and he sees the hair he sees the
[1:37:00] eyes he sees the teeth and he
[1:37:03] notices they're
[1:37:07] barefoot running through fields of
[1:37:10] beautiful Blu
[1:37:13] grass streams and hills and
[1:37:18] flowers and
[1:37:20] Barefoot notice he he gives this again
[1:37:23] he says when I looked coming to running
[1:37:25] to
[1:37:33] me it look like to
[1:37:36] me a
[1:37:39] million so the doctrine of my four and
[1:37:42] no more is a
[1:37:48] lie a
[1:37:50] million of young women about 20 years
[1:37:52] old I never seen such pretty women in my
[1:37:56] life their eyes look like
[1:38:00] stars their teeth as white as
[1:38:04] pearls long hair hanging down to their
[1:38:08] waist white robes on down to their
[1:38:12] feet and was
[1:38:17] barefooted
[1:38:20] barefooted what were they doing close to
[1:38:24] Eden than we are
[1:38:26] tonight you see the prophet said those
[1:38:28] that have died and gone on they are more
[1:38:31] privileged than we are man Carol was
[1:38:33] telling about the other day and I said
[1:38:34] you know but you think about it Carol I
[1:38:36] said in reality if we are alive and
[1:38:38] remain when the Lord Jesus comes when
[1:38:40] the Rapture comes we will not see the
[1:38:43] sixth
[1:38:45] Dimension
[1:38:47] right the sixth Dimension is there for
[1:38:49] them who goes by the way of the Grave
[1:38:51] many of them's been there for thousands
[1:38:52] of years we won't see that one we'll go
[1:38:55] straight into his
[1:38:57] presence oh praise the Lord now you see
[1:39:01] shoes can also represent preparation for
[1:39:05] a certain task that God wants you to do
[1:39:08] Exodus 12:11 and thus shall you eat it
[1:39:10] talking about the Lamb with your loins
[1:39:12] gted your shoes on your feet now friends
[1:39:16] we're in a journey and we need to be
[1:39:19] shaw it ain't time to go
[1:39:21] barefoot I'm talking my spirit now it
[1:39:24] ain't time to go barefoot don't you
[1:39:27] understand what the devil's doing to
[1:39:28] thousands of these message people they
[1:39:30] think they don't need a church to go to
[1:39:33] they think they don't need a pastor
[1:39:36] don't you understand what they're doing
[1:39:37] they're
[1:39:38] Barefoot they're walking barefoot in
[1:39:41] this ungodly sinful dark world and they
[1:39:44] think they're all ready for the Rapture
[1:39:46] how can you be ready for the Rapture
[1:39:47] when you deny part of God's word does it
[1:39:50] make any difference to God whether you
[1:39:51] denied Malachi four or Ephesians 4 If
[1:39:55] you deny one word you're not going in
[1:39:57] the Rapture how can you go in the
[1:39:59] Rapture without believing every word of
[1:40:04] God so they were to eat the land with
[1:40:07] bitter herbs and they were to do all
[1:40:08] this and have their
[1:40:10] shoes on your feet and your staff in
[1:40:12] your hand and eat it in haste it is the
[1:40:14] Lord's Passover Ephesians
[1:40:17] 6:15 Paul going through the Armament of
[1:40:19] the gospel and your feet shine
[1:40:25] with the
[1:40:26] preparation of the gospel of
[1:40:29] peace but sometimes shoes simply was a
[1:40:35] status of the
[1:40:37] wearer's
[1:40:39] freedom the prodical son returning back
[1:40:42] home the father said to his servants
[1:40:45] bring forth the best robe which we know
[1:40:47] was his robe and put it on him and put a
[1:40:50] ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
[1:40:56] amen shoes on his feet so the father
[1:41:01] told a servant to go get a robe and go
[1:41:04] get shoes and go get a ring what was it
[1:41:07] preparation of the gospel of peace who's
[1:41:10] it litigated by the Servants of God who
[1:41:13] are anointed in office of representation
[1:41:15] of the Lamb himself people do not
[1:41:17] believe that the true God called
[1:41:18] ministers are here actually representing
[1:41:21] the lamb come on somebody they're doing
[1:41:24] what the lamb has ordained them to do

[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:02] Glory I read it not long ago where the
[1:55:05] Prophet said this folks had come to his
[1:55:09] church to his Baptist Church there's
[1:55:12] some black
[1:55:14] folks and they come in and
[1:55:17] they started kind of moving around a
[1:55:20] little bit you know
[1:55:23] got out in the
[1:55:24] aisle started carrying
[1:55:26] on he said oh what's my Baptist Church
[1:55:29] going to think what these people going
[1:55:32] to say he said the next thing I knew I
[1:55:35] found myself out on the floor dancing
[1:55:37] with that
[1:55:48] woman I realize that's not a favorite
[1:55:51] quote of a lot of folks in the message
[1:55:52] that hadn't had a Pentecostal experience
[1:55:55] and that's what I figure a lot of the
[1:55:56] problem is the reason a lot of folks
[1:55:58] don't want our children to have the Holy
[1:55:59] Ghost because ain't got it yourself I
[1:56:02] don't understand anybody that's got the
[1:56:03] holy ghost that wouldn't want everybody
[1:56:05] to have the Holy Ghost why would you
[1:56:07] have the real baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:08] and want your children to have an
[1:56:10] intellectual something no if you've got
[1:56:12] the real Holy Ghost you want them to
[1:56:14] experience the same thing you got you
[1:56:16] want them to feel the power of God I I
[1:56:18] sat the other night and I heard my four
[1:56:20] granddaughters talking about being in
[1:56:21] the Pres of God and how the Holy Ghost
[1:56:24] come down you know the spirit of God Mo
[1:56:25] I thought Lord what a treasure let your
[1:56:28] mama lean over the curtain of time let
[1:56:30] her be able to hear what her what her
[1:56:31] daughters is talking about the presence
[1:56:33] of God brother Jonathan and I was
[1:56:35] talking the other day call me and was
[1:56:37] talking about one an experience he had
[1:56:38] down at the camp I said Thank You Jesus
[1:56:41] I said Thank You Jesus I felt like
[1:56:42] taking off running myself why I want our
[1:56:45] church to know there is a living God I
[1:56:48] want you to know there is a resurrected
[1:56:51] savior he ain't dead he's still in the
[1:56:53] healing business he's still in the
[1:56:55] saving business he's still delivering
[1:56:58] and setting folks free come on somebody
[1:57:01] I believe he wants to do it on Wednesday
[1:57:03] night and on Sunday morning on Monday
[1:57:05] night on question and answers tomorrow
[1:57:08] night he wants to move Among Us he wants
[1:57:10] to prove himself that he's the same
[1:57:13] yesterday today and
[1:57:14] [Applause]
[1:57:21] forever
[1:57:26] praise the
[1:57:27] Lord oh ain't he
[1:57:33] good let's pray
[1:57:36] together dear Jesus how we thank
[1:57:39] you what a day to be living in
[1:57:43] father one day the power of God will
[1:57:46] sweep over this entire
[1:57:51] Earth

[1:57:55] zones some of them asleep in the
[1:57:58] bed some of them already working some of
[1:58:01] them just
[1:58:03] stirring and the presence of God when
[1:58:07] the bride arrives to that
[1:58:10] place and they'll see their loved ones
[1:58:12] appear in the
[1:58:14] room and they know it won't be
[1:58:17] long praise God what a time it's going
[1:58:21] to be when all them holy rulers get
[1:58:25] together praise the
[1:58:27] Lord oh Jesus don't let to be one of us
[1:58:30] missing father that
[1:58:34] day oh Lord God I pray you'd pull back
[1:58:37] the seals
[1:58:39] father let us see not only our message
[1:58:42] inheritance as a
[1:58:44] group but may we see it as an
[1:58:48] individual if my brothers don't go on
[1:58:51] father I want all my
[1:58:53] land if my sisters don't go
[1:58:56] on it start happening of course we know
[1:58:59] in the Book of
[1:59:00] Judges when Joseph and then was manasse
[1:59:05] then Ephraim they did not drive out
[1:59:07] these
[1:59:08] inhabitants and then this tribe didn't
[1:59:10] drive out that
[1:59:12] inhabitants and before long it swept the
[1:59:14] entire move of God of that day and the
[1:59:19] next thing they knew they had these
[1:59:21] parasites
[1:59:23] amorites Hittites hivites
[1:59:27] jebusites all those Canaanite people
[1:59:30] living right on their
[1:59:33] land next door neighbors to
[1:59:36] them they traded off a complete
[1:59:40] possession for a partial
[1:59:44] possession and years later them people
[1:59:47] became a thorn in their
[1:59:49] sides and led many of their children off
[1:59:52] into
[1:59:53] idolatry because them parents did not
[1:59:57] take all their land they let a little
[2:00:00] bit of sin go to creeping back in and
[2:00:02] this creeping in and that creeping in
[2:00:05] they thought they had it under control
[2:00:07] in their
[2:00:08] generation and truly most of those
[2:00:10] people never raised up in that
[2:00:12] generation they waited till the next
[2:00:15] one so it was the children of those
[2:00:18] compromising parents that began to deal
[2:00:21] with help us to see the same thing
[2:00:23] father oh Lord may we keep the standard
[2:00:27] where you've always had it on truth and
[2:00:29] Purity not only for ourselves but for
[2:00:33] the sake of those coming behind us
[2:00:36] because we are sowing seeds today of
[2:00:39] what this church will be tomorrow if
[2:00:42] there is one so if we SE a little bit of
[2:00:45] doubt and a little bit of fear a little
[2:00:47] bit of compromise here and a little bit
[2:00:49] more compromise there if you te within
[2:00:52] 10 years from now or 15 no doubt by then
[2:00:54] I'll be so old I won't be able to
[2:00:56] preach so who would they get then some
[2:01:00] younger fellow there's plenty of these
[2:01:02] out on the message today that's just
[2:01:04] looking for a church and looking for a
[2:01:05] pull pit they'll do whatever they have
[2:01:08] to do to get
[2:01:09] it I know it's hard for them to believe
[2:01:11] that but if they had to deal with
[2:01:12] preachers the way that I do they'd
[2:01:15] understand it a little clear we've got
[2:01:17] as many parasites and hivites and
[2:01:19] Hittites and Canaanites
[2:01:23] it's awful Lord God may we keep our
[2:01:25] swords in hand may we keep them so sharp
[2:01:29] we don't want no rubber
[2:01:31] sword so that if there is a tomorrow we
[2:01:34] can hand over to our
[2:01:35] children a true baptism of the Holy
[2:01:38] Ghost a God that still loves and still
[2:01:42] moves praise God that's what we want
