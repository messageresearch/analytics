========================================

and I thought of that about sheep and I thought of that about sheep and Shepherd why did he choose David David is always talking about Still Waters and Green Pastures he was the psalmist that wrote songs and played on his heart to the glory of God and he must have been something about David pending sheep he must have been a real sheep herder did you notice one time there was a bear running and got one of his sheep and he killed that bear and a lion running he got one and he caught that beard Lying by the beard and took a knife and killed that lion see it was sacrificing for his sheep and if he was willing to lay down his life for the Sheep he was a type of the Good Shepherd there's something that God always liked the people under sheep did you ever notice you're the sheep of the pastors sheep of one whole other sheep have eyes and so forth likening people unto sheep you know why he likened us the Sheep did you ever did you ever fool a sheep any there are certainly educational and a Divine education to to learn of sheep I've raised them and shepherded them around and the little fellas but when a sheep is lost he's absolutely helpless I picked up cheating not standing maybe 300 yards from the Sheep full and where all the other sheep was and that sheep when he's lost he can't help himself he just stands our blades and blates until the wolf gets him or something takes place he he just can't find his way back he's totally helpless without a shepherd you know he said to Peter love me Peter more than these yeah feed my sheep I never said drive my sheep and Earth said kick my sheep he said feed my sheep that's what the Sheep needs is some sheep food don't you think so ain't all the best sheep food on the offer you sick sheep and all kinds of sheep here it is a great big bread basket of God Amen man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's what the Holy Spirit lives on that's in you lives on the word of God that connection of Shepherd and sheep uh one time when I was over in the orients I learned a great lesson about uh seen in Saint John I believe the 10th chapter of words that I am the the gate to the sheepfull or the door to the sheepfall I often wonder how could he being a man be a door but then when I was over there I learned what it meant the Shepherds Drive their sheep into the Sheepfold and they got a arch that to go in at and when he drives them all in there then after they're all in and he counts them and every if he's one lacking you'll go out and get it he has to bring it in every sheep has to be accounted for every hour of the day how old a shepherd He is and that actually gets them all numbered and they're all vetted down the shepherd goes down by this hole where the Sheep coming at and lays himself down across the hole then no wolf can come in no feet can come in no harm can come in unless it comes over the shepherd first what a picture of Christ laying itself down far off that nothing can harm us unless it comes over him so if you're sick you say brother Graham sickness crossed over him but it was for the glory of God that's right he wants to maybe give you a testimony as the fellow said one time he seen a shepherd with its uh pack and a sheep and he said oh the head is a legal Advantage stuff he said well what did you uh what's the matter did it fall off a piston no I said I broke his leg boy said you must be a cruel Shepherd to break your own sheep's lakes and all the Sheep wouldn't mind me so I had to break her leg in order to hold her head her and love her and give her a little special food so that she would love me and follow me and so sometimes God has to do that to us let the doctor say oh come over nothing can be done and then God takes you up in his arms and patches a little bit don't you know I love you don't show I'm the Lord that he is but Lord I was taught that the days of me I know you were but I just had to let this happen so I could just show you a little special favor why don't you love me just a little more now I'm gonna let you get well did you ever had that just come to you I have many times that something happened just to check me down a little to let him Express his love now another thing you notice about sheep and the shepherd you know it's a disgrace for the shepherd to lose one sheep did you know that it's a reproach on the shepherd um [Music] yes sir if the shepherd loses one sheep it is a disgrace all the father has given will come and none's loss see him all that comes to me all right the shepherd can't afford to lose a sheep that's the reason you backslider tonight is hanging around your heart trying to draw you back to the full because he once kissed you and you kissed him and told him that you loved him and raise your hands and praise him and you backslid and went out there and got all butchered up and wounded up in your spirit but he still holds around you all the time come on back wandering sheep I just can't afford to let you be lost maybe the little sheep that he had to go way out on the mountain to find all through the place maybe you're that sheep tonight laying out there wounded somewhere but the shepherd can't afford to lose one sheep oh to follow the footsteps of the shepherd that's it don't be tempted toast about worried tap the urine down your today you got the victory tomorrow you're out of the victory Paulo the shepherd he's a lead so my sheep know my voice he said and the stranger said they get accustomed okay hearing I said well if another Shepherd would come in and give that little holy lady call that he gives there wood them sheep if they were out in the field cups at all no [Laughter] one more time [Music] no those sheep know the very sound that every tone or that Shepherd's voice end of the Bible that no matter another Shepherd gets sent up and try to impersonate that damn sheep and just keep on grazing [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] hahaha [Music] but just let that little certain voice speak every sheep instead of hear the light up come marching [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh my God [Applause] oh my God this is amazing oh my Tom glorious days that king shepherd will scream from the sky has and we'll take a march to Zion City breaking of the armies of the Lord when we rise triumph over death in hell the great

misunderstanding last night brother Tim was not saying that people that need the Holy Ghost and things like that cannot come through the prayer line someone had asked that today if if people would

miracle that I can be here [Applause] thank you thank you for every prayer that you have prayed and sent our way they have been greatly felt and we're still journeying we're still believing God and we know that he's the answer we take chemo every day but he's the answer and he's the high physician so glad to have my wife with us tonight and so we just so love you with all of our hearts we would like to congratulate you on such a wonderful place a beautiful building and and we know this is the vision of your pastor brother Donnie our friend and and all of you and he showed us each piece that you would do and took us through the building and as I was walking through I thought you know God planned it this way he planted exactly like this and he was using your hands and your fingers and your minds to put it together but just wait till we get to our new home [Applause] you know you you worked on it and you watched the process of it it took the years that it took to build it now you're in it and and last night the preacher preached on the feeling of the presence of the Lord in this Temple and we felt him quite well and we just know incredible sermons have already begun to come forth from this this place and and new Souls will come and God's got great big plans here and then when we're done we'll leave it to the Beast and so but I thought as we walked through it every place seemed to almost be overwhelming for me because it was our first time viewing it and as I was walking through and I come to the Sunday school session back section back there and I thought how beautiful that was I thought one of these days we'll walk through heaven and every place that we see will be breathtaking and and just to see one another we'll be breathtaking and so amen God bless you we so love you with all of our hearts amen what a wonderful sermon last night I thought that was masterpiece you know he preached on the fire coming into this place in the presence of the Lord coming and and you know that was more real than what you realize because we went home we we went to the hotel we got in bed 1 30 this morning all the fire alarms went off we were standing outside together and I said well you preached it here we are God bless you brother Tim amen each and every one of you I'm looking forward to what God has in store tonight I'll speak to you for a little bit and then we'll we'll just step into another realm and just ask the Lord to do special things now what I want to ask you to do is I want you to invite him personally I want you to invite him to your place tonight I want to speak to you to you Monday night he dealt with me on this thought he has come to your house so if he would deal with me in that way he's here and he's always comes to do business and it's individual it's not my brother it's not my sister it's not other ones I have a need I personally believe that I can walk out of this building cancer free that's what I believe thank you I believe thank you so I would like to thank you all for showing up with my visit with the Lord amen amen there's just no one that cares for you like Jesus no one and tonight as we ask him to come to our house he always comes where he's invited and he keeps all of his appointments if he said he would be here and it reminded us on Monday evening in a very special way he's come because of you and so we believe it with all of our hearts and we take him at his word I'm reminded that sometimes in our courage is our courage sometimes fail and our strength fails the night that the doctor called me I was in British Columbia speaking at your grandfather's Church brother West they called me five minutes before that I was to get in the car with brother Tom and told me that I had cancer and that night I would speak on Courage God just orchestrates everything doesn't he here's one of the opening statements courage is not having the strength to go on it is going on when you don't have strength amen maybe you'd just like to say Lord come by my way come by my way Heavenly Father we have felt your awesome presence already in this building and we know that you're here as it was spoke last night the feeling of the Temple and how many buildings are built that never are filled with your presence how many people will sit in pews that will never get you but I'd like to say thank you thank you that you've come to our house I'd like to make you welcome now Lord Jesus you see our needs father there's so many needs that takes our breath but Lord there's not a one that you can't answer now Lord as we ask you father No Man Is A Healer we're only gifted to speak your word to lay hands on the sick that's what our commission is but Lord we know when you're here and your word is applied you'll do the work so father we thank you even like Jesus did before he prayed for Lazarus I thank you that you hear me Lord and so we thank you Father I ask you that you would anoint me as I would speak the word for a few moments Lord and I thank you Father that there's great men that are standing prepared that of a laid aside time to prepare to to to get ready for a prayer line but now Lord Jesus as we said in our pews we want to invite you to where we're at we want to invite you to our certain spot now Lord we just plead with you come come to my place Lord we call out your Your Name Lord come oh God help us today father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen and a man if you will turn with me in your scriptures to Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. I be I believe there's no greater prayer that can be prayed with Jesus prayed and after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen could you say Amen with me you may be seated he has come to our house brother Branham said prayer is the key that's the answer we live in a world that's looking for an answer we have it [Music] Prayer Changes Things prayer is the most powerful weapon that's ever been put into control of human beings there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God what an incredible statement a prophet would say to the Bride of Jesus Christ who has Authority with him the scripture says but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed how powerful and positive that that is [Applause] brother Brandon would say endorsed to a door he says if if we could have someone to come to with the door of our house we'd like to welcome them and welcome them in if it was the Queen of England and that's when she was alive if it was the Queen of England we would like to make her welcome we'd be all struck that she would come to our house to leave a castle like that and and to come and all the royalty and to come to our house he mentions the presidents and great generals if they would come to our place and if they would come we would definitely like to make them welcome and give them the best that we could possibly give but there's another one standing at our door and he's never had to be political he's never failed he has never been in crisis well as a matter of fact he's always known where you was before there was ever a sun or moon or star he knew the situation that you would be in tonight so he provided for you and knows where you're at so he knows the situation of your home he knows the situation of your marriage he knows the situation to what the doctors have been telling you all this time he's in control of it he has the answer he's not in the practicing of of medicine he is in the perfecting of it for he has provided a blood so we come under Great Expectations tonight because tonight could change our lives lives Generations can be changed now I'll just share this with you and every every man who's gifted as a minister gifted different one morning I Was preparing in my study at home and as I Was preparing the Lord showed me a vision it was a vision of a little boy in her church that had not been able to walk and it was way past the time for him to walk he was not even making an effort wasn't even crawling on the floor William and sister Gabrielle the other children would carry him from place to place Wes was a wonderful little child he would go to nobody else but his mom and his dad and his his siblings and division that morning that the Lord showed me that that I would step off of the pulpit and pick him up that would be a miracle and I would take him in my arms and I walk up the aisle with him and come back and then and then pray and he spoke to me I have come to their house when I walked into the office brother William is a minister there with us and he was standing there and and no way could he understand what was about to happen and I just looked at him and I said William I want to say this to you today Jesus is coming to your house as I as I preached and I felt the nudge I I just kind of carried for a moment I felt the nudge again it was on the third touch that I stepped off of the platform and I reached down and he reached up that was number one miracle and as I walked back I walked back through the through the aisle way and I walked back and I walked and I began to tell the congregation this was the visitation that I had this morning man can't orchestrate anything it is God that orchestrates it and as we had prayer and I handed him back into his daddy's arms he was standing there weeping and praising the Lord it wasn't immediately but they began to video that child over the coming weeks and over the coming months and now that guy runs all over the place [Applause] there was a visitation with sister Karen and a little fella named Drew a vision had been shown that he would walk months had passed and he would only stand near a couch sister Karen with brain bleeds and situations she's in a better house now and the Lord dropped in that room he made a visit and as God came and touched sister Karen that little boy immediately jumped and ran all over that house no man can do that no man can take the credit for that and you said well brother Ron that was you know that was you know that's just a story that you're telling can we believe it well let me tell you another there was a little girl that had nobody that would send out a message to call but she talked into a realm she was reading a book she had laid in the bed for nine years she needed Jesus to come to her house she needed him to come no matter the unbelief that was in her home or the unbelief that was in the community or even to feel sorry for her she needed more than sympathy she needed more than just people to take care of her she wanted to play the piano she wanted to be well she wanted to go to church she wanted to serve God and God sent his Prophet by her way you know the story how do you write poor as she could be today she owns more than houses because she said the right word at the right time how many homes was brother Branham in and and they entertained him but they didn't step into that momentum of that presence I would say this today when Jesus passes by I want to call out to him at the right moment at the right time I want to catch his attention [Applause] you say well brother Ron timing time and sometimes it seems like it's happened it's been so long well no doubt in the Scriptures it tells us that that there was a personal friend of Jesus come on down huh that he'd ate a lot of suppers with heard a lot of stories but now he's got sick and now his friends are telling him Jesus was such a friend but we bid him to come if he was such a great Pastor even if he's such a great Messiah he would come and heal you he breathed his last breaths his sisters put him away that rolled the stone no doubt they had a lot of emotional feelings you know sometimes we think it's just times just passed by and we must have missed it somewhere and Jesus began to make his way to their house today was going to be a different day he wasn't going to come and give a eulogy but he was going to remind them that I am the resurrection and I am the life and they begin to say that they believed that he would come in that Resurrection but they didn't realize today was that day this was their service this was their moment sometimes you can't realize it before it happens but after it happens and Jesus asked him a real serious question where have you laid him oh he he must go anoint the tumor he must going to go you know and maybe say some nice words he was that's exactly right that's exactly what he was going to do and he stepped up before the tomb knowing what was getting ready to happen because he knew a couple of days ago what was getting ready to happen but he had to wait till he went to sleep didn't die he went to sleep I didn't wait till he goes to sleep sometimes God's waiting on us and so he waits till he goes to sleep and now he comes because now it's time God's always on time so as he waits and and then he stands there and he winks he weeps because he's going to have to bring him back to this world where is that he's not worried about politics not worried about taxes who's the president not worried about the wars not worried about his hating neighbors he's not worried about any he's going to have to bring him from that realm fellowshipping with Abraham Isaac and Jacob tell him then the testimonies of he's been with Jesus and he's got to call him back for a little while so he begins to weep weep because of their unbelief weak because he's got to bring him from that Immortal Realm back to mortal only to have to go back there again and brother Branham you know I think it's so incredible that you know Jesus could have just and blew the stone away but he asked them isn't he masculine yet two women to roll a stone away and no doubt they begin to push and shove quite a heavy storm that no child could come and get inside of that heavy Stone that's been sealed and they begin to push it took an incredible amount of faith on their part it'll take an incredible amount of faith on your part to leave your seed and walk through a prayer line he could heal you there but it's a prayer line has been caught [Applause] it takes energies to move stones it takes Faith to move those stones because moving the stone says I believe whatever he says is going to come to pass this is way out of human control and he stood there and he said Lazarus we know the story brother Branham said had he not called him by name there would have become a general Resurrection because he was the voice of the Resurrection [Applause] God went to another house there's a man named job God had a conference with his enemy he made his enemy he created his enemy and being God he does good he does good at whatever he does and he created a powerful enemy the anti-type to himself one that would even sit at his right hand he created him so powerful that even his children would have to struggle against him he was having a conference with all the angels and the enemy came before him and he said where have you been oh I have I've been going all over Word of Life Church I've been going all over the message of the hour searching to and fro whom I might destroy who might might devour but you've got a hedge about those people and God began to testify there's nobody can testify like God does because he begins to testify that job was perfect it begins to testify none like him in the Earth and then he gives him permission to go and begin to try him and he puts it on parameters to where he can only go so far You Know The Enemy that you fight can only go so far he can only go so far you may think he's going to destroy you but he would have already did that if he could have Erica he would have already destroyed you if he could have he would have already took your life if he could have you know the story job loses everything his friends turn against him his wife turns against him it looks like that there's no way out he doesn't have a letter from God saying that uh I testified and you're going to be all right I I find it very interesting when God comes to job he never talks to him about his finances he never talks to him about his friends he never talks to him about the balls on his body he doesn't talk to him about his condition he talks to him about his future [Applause] he begins to talk about an eternal realm what job was in was a very temporary Realm and that's not really you know he's not really so interested in that temporary realm and so he says job where was you when I laid the foundations of the Earth [Applause] where was you at anyway Sun the moon the stars the Zodiac the first Bible I put you there Joe I thought of you there and then he takes him to the end when the sons of God Will shout he saw you there as well he reminded you job you're not going to be alone I've got a bride [Applause] they're going to go through a lot of things and and what's happened to you is going to be a testimony to them none of them is going to have a day like you if that was the way he could talk to him none of them are going to have a day like you but they're going to be there [Applause] would you like to him to come to your place and say no listen regardless of what you're going through I've got a seat for you at the merry supper of the Lamb and it's just a such a vision of who you'd be sitting beside of you know your your troubles would pass away for a few moments Jesus said in in Mark chapter 10 and verse 27. Jesus looking upon them said with men it is impossible it's quite a statement with men it is impossible that takes us all in but not with God for With God all things are possible Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live again and whosoever liveth them believeth in me shall never die and he asks believe us thou this sister Linda Jimmy didn't die he's more alive there than he ever was here [Applause] sister Karen is not dead she's more alive there she's more beautiful there than she ever was here it's hard to believe but that's the way God prepares and he knows in just a few days we're going to be there with him and we'll forget all of this [Applause] David would say it like this the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want. he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and he leadeth me beside of the Still Waters and it restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death sister victory I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemies and thou anointest my head with all in my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you read that you read that since you was a child no doubt you you can say it by heart but David writes that right after he writes Psalms 22. where he says that I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption I want to just share this with you just for a point that it might help you if he would not allow that Holy One to see corruption and Jesus was raised back to life before Satan could destroy his body and it would not see corruption you see you was in him and when Jesus stepped out of the Tomb Satan had bombarded him at every service he had called an illegitimate since he was a child he had made fun of him at 12 years old at every meeting even at the Mount of Temptation he was there to bombard him bombard him every service calling him a devil every service making fun of him every service questioned him but when Jesus walked out of that tomb Satan couldn't touch him no more now if he couldn't corrupt him then he can't corrupt him now and if you was in him he couldn't corrupt you then he can't corrupt you now sure your flesh stinks sure your spirit sometimes becomes contaminated but the seed that's on the inside of you that's Eternal that God thought of before the foundation of the world Satan can never corrupt that City he has parameters that he can fight he knows that there's only so much time to work so he bombards your mind he bombards your flesh he bombards your spirit but there's a realm he can't get to so you may be afflicted but you're not defeated you may have a lot of Affliction in your life but let me just say in none of that will we be defeated [Applause] I stand here tonight before you without a miracle I'm a dying man I'm not scared I'm not afraid I'm not giving up why should we quit why should we run why shouldn't we be afraid we are not victims sister Erica we're not victims we're Victorious we are not helpless but we're hopeful we're not defenseless but we're clothed in the armor of light we are not powerless but filled with the Holy Spirit we are not alone but are surrounded by a mighty host of angels we've been armed with brothers and sisters around us that are a team of body of believers we are an invincible Army we will never be defeated Hallelujah we'll never be defeated never never never never never be this city did you I like these words when I fall he lifts me up when I fail he forgives me when I'm weak he is strong when I am lost he is my way when I'm afraid is my courage when I stumbled he steadies me when I'm hurt he heals me when I am broken he mends me when I am blind he leads me when I am hungry he feeds me when I face trials he is with me when I face persecution he Shields me when I face problems he comforts me when I face loss he provided for me when I face death he carries me home he is my God he is my God he is faithful I am his and he is mine God is in control I am on his side and that means All Is Well with My Soul we have come to moments like this that we must make our stand we must take courage regardless of what your situations are you must press against the darkness maybe your bedroom has become a prison house a place to where only others come to tend to you God's with you you may have been already got too old to roll over in your bed and your your body is is weak God has not forgot you [Applause] he has not forsaken you he's still your doctor he's still your provider it is we that get disappointed in the temporary situations and sometimes begin to doubt but if we can only focus ourselves out Beyond [Applause] the scripture tells us to be strong and of good courage we must remind ourselves we're believers regardless of what you hear in your ears we're believers we're God's sons and daughters we didn't even choose to be that way we're God's sons and daughters [Applause] that means that we're the most powerful people on the Earth people in Washington think they're making decisions for us they only think that there's another realm that's making decisions for us and being Sons and Daughters of God we're challenged and commissioned to fight [Applause] brother Ron I don't have the strength if you can only move a finger move a finger if it can only say a word say a word we're not going to back up neither are we going to back down we shall fight [Applause] he shelters us under his wings he fights our battles he wins our Wars we cast out Satan with the Holy Ghost God is or has authorized us and empowered us to use the name of Jesus Christ for any need at any time under any condition now taking him at his word and by that Authority no matter how big that devil is he is defeated but being built the way he is you've got to remind him don't forget your job remind him of who you are and remind him of the he that's defeated he don't have the keys to his own house he is strict how humiliated that he must still when he hears a child of God you may not see the Angels around you you may not feel the holy presence of God around you but that devil can see it I'm reading you some things that has been really powerful things in my journey we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields in the streets we shall fight in the Hills we shall Never Surrender We Will Never Surrender we will fight for our families we will fight for our children we will fight for our healing we will fight for deliverance we will fight for joy we will fight for peace we will fight for the Holy Ghost we will fight until our bodies are changed and we're sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb we will fight [Applause] Angelo Dundee was the trainer for Muhammad Ali who is still considered today to be one of the greatest Champions that ever lived I'm not here to debate that I'm just here to bring up a point he said when he would get Muhammad in the in the corner and he was getting beat up pretty bad looked like he was going to lose the fight he said it was not my job to teach him how to fight he knew how to fight he said it was my job as his trainer to remind him of who he was so that's what your pastor does that's what these men of God do you know how to fight you've got the best equipment that there is you are a champion of layout of sale we just got to remind you of who you are and where you came from and what's your mission on this Earth is to do fight you're an overcomer this is your hour when these worship Warriors come in and they begin to Lead You In Worship we know that we're not here to be entertained we got great talent we got great singers that's been exhibited tonight but all of that can happen and if we don't join into worship if we don't join into worship we miss the points so we begin to clap our hands we begin to Rejoice we begin to amen the word of God we begin to enter into that Realm Satan would like for us to be casual [Applause] because he knows if you get reminded of who you are and you get inspired in your mind if you stay at work or you stay with your troubles at home or you stay with their situations or the sickness but if you could break through the barrier whether it's Wednesday night or Saturday night or Sunday morning whatever it is wherever you're setting Jesus has come to your house yeah brother on I can't sing doesn't matter God Made You he knowed how you'd sound he made you specifically the Way You Are brother Ron I can't carry a tune he knows but nobody can say it like you can say it nobody can take your place nobody can clap their hands like you clap your hands so let us rally to war let us stand shoulder this shoulder and worship God that's what this building was built for it is not an entertainment center you've got one of the greatest preachers that ever lived in the history of time standing here is your pastor but he's not here to entertain you he's here to create war against the devil he's ready to remind you that we will win Hallelujah we will win brother on but I'm afraid we'll become emotional die [Applause] how many quotes do we have to have that anything without emotion it's dead and it ought to be burned how many quotes do we need about stillborn children we're a lively Church can you imagine how much Havoc that it causes in a demonic Realm when Satan has bombarded you all week long and you still come to church foreign [Applause] you still worship God Hallelujah have humiliated that must be to the Demons of hell they they don't ever think that they can devote to destroy you and you're still expressing victory thank you I need a quote brother Ron you have got the right preacher [Applause] Psalms chapter 150 verse 1. Praise You the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary that's this place Praise Him in the Furman of his power praise him for his mighty Acts fire d I appreciate brother Tim telling us and reminded us tell your testimony [Applause] people get the Willies when you start giving a testimony I saw a vision I saw this I saw this miracle take place well we saw it we was there we're the witnesses of it [Applause] praise him for his mighty acts praise him for his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with a sorcery and a heart brother Ron I don't like all that noise don't go to heaven as a matter of fact don't go to hell [Applause] everybody's naked there there's no friends there there's weeping and gnashing of teeth and screaming like there's never been screams on the earth so it's going to be a noisy place [Applause] we choose to go to a place where we're going to be shouting and dancing and praising God throughout the eternities worshiping the lamb who is worthy of all of our worship in all of us are you doing praise him with the Timberland dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs Praise Him upon loud symbols Praise Him upon High sounding symbols now I'm going to give you an excuse right here I'm going to give you an out they call it young people call it out let everything that hath breath [Applause] praise the Lord so if you're dead if you're mad you've got an excuse but we're in a church where there's a resurrection Act and you can't be Resurrected [Applause] now we're having a good time brother Branham says I I now challenge the devil to a debate Satan you are aware that you're whipped you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you out of every Authority that you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness and you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff and you know that when our Lord came to the tree he cursed the tree and the next day it was withered and our lord said the disciples have faith in God for if ye shall say to the Mount and be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said is coming to pass you can have what you said foreign you've heard that quote so many times you can quote it by heart but let's just think about it in reality Satan was standing there the prophet when he said it nowhere on the tape do you hear Satan say uh oh I got all of my power he couldn't argue with what the prophet said [Applause] I think it's nice when Satan has to amen the word [Applause] now I think about a night like tonight Satan knows that there's a prayer line getting ready to happen he's even sensible enough to know that he's going to get defeated tonight because it was paid for at Calvary you say brother Ron but I've had some really rough days I can tell you about rough days I want to share something with you it's been real blessed to my heart on the roughest of our days the lowest hours of our despair even in those times we're still chosen [Applause] we're blessed we're favored we're forgiven we're loved of God we're Victorious on our roughest days we are inheritors of all of Heaven's Glory we're privileged to walk with the King of Kings we're married to him and he calls us his beloved we're strong in faith we're armed to fight devils we're entrusted with God's word we have the most powerful weapon at our disposal and we are protected by our almighty God I want to remind you when he placed the Hedge about you you're more protected than Biden and you should be you're more protected than Donald Trump and you should be you're more protected than any dictator that there is in the world Hollywood celebrity brother on I don't sin I don't see it Psalms 91 said you're encamped about with the angels of God to protect you brother on I've been through some tough things just imagine what you would have went through without them [Applause] brother Brandon was asked why does God let troubles come brother random explains God harnesses troubles and put bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us closer to God [Applause] three years ago I heard the voice of the Lord speak to me on that day sister Connie and I were preparing a meal for our entire family as they would come in we actually hugged and we kind of did a little dance in our what we called the ballroom and I said life just couldn't get better be careful what you say in two weeks you know things changed later that day the Lord spoke to me and it is speaking to me he said if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before me and his brothers back here have seen some of the most phenomenal Miracles that's known to man from the dead raised to people coming out of wheelchairs the death here I see cerebral hemog just literally dry up we we've seen incredible things take place cancers dry up and die so when I heard that I wrote it down real quickly put a date and a time stamp with it put it on my wall put it put it on my calendar placed it in my computer you know there's a lot of things I was thinking how is he going to use Me Maybe in a greater way maybe to see Visions more clearly maybe to understand the word greater in no way as a human being could I understand that the trouble was laying ahead of me of cancer brother Roy Shrewsbury would call me brother Tim was at our place brother Roy Shrewsbury would call me and he would say I was praying to God and he said I was I was praying to God he said God spoke to me about you brother Ron and he said tell brother Ron that he is like Daniel and he's preparing to go into a place to where no man has ever lived but he needs to tell the king O King I'll see you in the morning [Music] doctors say that I'm in the one percent category they call me a phenomenon they say everybody else we've got a lot of patients taking the same chemo that you're taking it's not the chemo I thank God for that and I take it brother bam says you go to a doctor take his medicine but I take that chemo it makes me sick it makes me go through a lot of different things it destroys organs in my body but it's the faith [Music] [Applause] I wear a pen on my jacket because the doctors tell their other patients there's a preacher that's in the one percent category he's taken this same medicine but he's doing something that's worth it and you'll know him by the pen on his jacket let me just say this to you cancer is a vicious demon it is no puppy to play with it's not for sissies when I get shots in my back and they put needles in there about that long to try to help me I take I take chemo about 30 pills a day I take eight to ten shots of for for diabetics I I I do that every day I have to watch it I'll check it here in a few moments it'll be okay that's why I'm drinking Coke it's a real thing thank you but God's greater than cancer you see uh that was a conversation with a prophet and a mighty angel in a very special place called a cave and he was going to be sent around the world and he would give excuses of why he couldn't do it that all the diseases would not be able to stand before his prayers and he specifically called our disease cancer so you may be eating up with cancer like I am today but it does not have to control you it is not the winner brother Ron what should I do ignore it [Applause] move on prepare for the next sermon brother Branham tells us that Satan cannot take your life until God is finished with you [Applause] nothing happens to you unless God permits it [Music] brother Mike I've said it so many times and I said it at your place if you hear Ron Spencer die don't believe it for a second I will be more alive there than I am here now let me quickly preach to you remember our God is still the god of Elijah he is still the same God that ever was he's always been the same God he's never been defeated he's never once lost one ounce I owed a period or comma he's never lost none of his power he can heal the greatest disease in the world it doesn't diminish it he can say the worst Harlot prostitute worst drunk dope addict and it does not diminish his power none whatsoever on I'm too Farm God knows the darkness of hell he knows how to come and get you brother Brian was in prayer he said Satan you who bound these people you're exposed tonight your grips are lost you have no legal Authority at all Jesus Christ robbed you and stripped you at Calvary and we come as the Church of the Living God In The Name of Jesus Christ I adjure Thee to leave every person in the building come out of the people thou devil I jury thee by the Living God length [Applause] pretty powerful word live Brother Band that's no no you don't have to put it any more eloquent leave Satan's a squatter [Applause] leave you don't have the title deed to this property leave say it with me leave [Applause] but the RAM says have faith in God oh my how the devil has to recognize the supreme authority of Jesus Christ not me he hates me he don't have to mind me but he has to mind who I represent [Applause] he has to mind who sent me here [Applause] now the scripture says in first John chapter 3 and verse 2. beloved now are we the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is the scripture says greater is he greater is he that is in you [Applause] then he that is in the world it is not you that stared it's him that is scared [Applause] I love these words I've been sick before but I made it I've been broke before but I made it I've been brokenhearted before but I made it I cried all night long but I made it I've been betrayed but I made it I've been lied on but I made it I've been left destitute but I made it I've been rejected but I made it I want to remind the devil I have made it for those that has known me for all these years you know this is my favorite scripture Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 17 no weapon no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper I'm not some young buck preacher that don't have blood I have been fighting a long time and I want to remind the devil no weapon no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against thee in the Judgment Thou shalt cut them so every demon that has tormented you all this time write their names down make a list you're the ones that's gonna put him in hell I'm trying to behave [Music] [Applause] brother Branham talks about a woman that has came to a meeting she can't get in and brother Branham you know you know how everything's orchestrated by God [Music] brother random runs into her if you don't mind I'm going to read it to make sure that you get it sir I'm looking for my papa we have came over from Memphis to see the Healer my papa was trying to find a way for me to get in but he told me to stand still but they they have pushed me out of place and I've lost where I was standing and I'm blind and I can't find my way back would you be so kind to help me to get to the bus where my papa can find me now this seemed like now this seemed like a hypocrite but I said what did you say that you come over here to see she said I come to see the Healer she said you sir I've been blind for years and she said I heard on the radio this morning of a man who got his sight and papa got the money ready and we chartered a bus and and I come over to see him now they say that you can't get near the building brother branham's response you don't believe in such stuff as that do you know in the days when we've got such fine doctors she said but you see sir they can't do me no good [Music] [Applause] so when they tell you four months to live and you're at the point of your death make ready there's another doctor can you imagine how bad that it Badgers Satan he's been getting so close but he can't take this preacher's life [Applause] and I'll walk right up In a Pulpit [Applause] [Music] I don't look like I got cancer I don't act like I don't cancer I don't just sound like I've got cancer had no proofs left after who wins but you see sir they can't do me no good I said do you mean to tell me that you believe that the prayer of a man would do something for me or for you and she said it like this I'll never forget it she said I'll tell you the what I'll do if you just help me to get in where the man is then I'll find my papa don't tell me about your circumstance tell me about your future [Applause] foreign I thought of blind Fanny Crosby she'd heard of this other man being healed and the other blind person and I thought a Fanny Crosby when she wrote past me not on Gentle Savior heal my humble cry while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by thou stream of about thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee or whom in heaven but the while God is healing in the Angeles Temple he can heal in this Upper Room he's The God Who healed that man in a wheelchair last night brought back the cancer off of the clock to rejoice and he couldn't even move he's the one who healed that little Ricky the one who sent the message all the way across the sea and spoke to the woman dying with diabetes and he'll sets his sister her sister here this morning called back he's that same God now I looked at her and said I I may be the one that you're supposed to see see how God locks things just exactly right why was I taken out back she grabbed me with the lapels of my coat like that she said are you the Healer and I said no sister I am not I'm just your brother I want to see the Healer I hope that you see them someday I believe that you will what is your name brother Branham you're the one that I want to see now no one knows me I pray for you but don't let it be known take my take your hand and I couldn't pull her hands off of my lapel she wasn't gonna miss it I haven't wasted my time rehearsing a story don't miss it she said that's all I'll ask you about we bowed our heads and while we were praying I heard a scream she ran out into the lot throwing people one way or the other she fell down on the gr on the ground screaming I once was blind I don't know what your testimony will be but she said I once was blind you once had a wayward son you thought he would never come back he once was Wayward but now he's so bad can I go to one more house before I come to yours it was a house of a man that was quite well known in the community especially in the religious world he had quite power and quite Authority when he walked down the street everybody was nodding to him he was well looked up to in the community but his daughter had become sick now he had heard echoes that there was a Healer in the land no doubt he had heard a lot of stories and they made sense and maybe in the heart of hearts this is what he had been looking for all along he saw the facade of a church he saw people that were full of dead men's bones he saw an empty religion that couldn't produce what he said it could produce and there was a hunger in his heart but now trouble had come to his house always makes a difference when it comes to your house as long as it's over Yonder over there or over there it doesn't matter quite as much but when it comes to your house oh it don't mean you don't pray with fervency but when it comes to your house it grips your heart it literally punches you in the gut it causes you to lay awake night after night after night he was smart enough to know I can't heal her and what I've got can heal her and if it costs me everything preaching me now if it cost me everything I've got to get to him [Music] he couldn't call out to a servant to go servant didn't have the burden he didn't call out to another affiliate to go they'd only shame he had to go to put you in a spot to where you've got to go he took off his religious hat because it didn't work he took off his religious cloak because it didn't work and today when he walked down the street he wasn't dressed like he was yesterday he's on a mission he's not headed to the local bread store he's not headed to the hardware store today he don't know where he'll find him but he's got to get to Jesus he knows those people that have called him Brethren looked up to him are going to disdain him and not like him anymore going to make fun of him but he's willing to forsake it all to get to Jesus then when you get there you got to get his attention but Jesus knew before you was coming isn't it incredible when Jesus says okay I'll go home with you I'll come to your house I'll come to your house Drew don't have to be crippled all of his life his children don't have to be crippled that cancer that you're fighting it you can break the cycle of that and your children doesn't have to break the cycle what about your sin cycle it's much worse than cancer wouldn't it be incredible to think about as Jarius now Jesus is coming to his house it's not just a wish it's not just an if but now he's making steps with him and he's telling him don't you fear you only believe I know something about fear the first two months of my diagnosis I woke up every morning weeping and crying tormented these two men sitting behind me made a surprise visit to my home you know there may be a lot of people make fun of these two men but I consider them the most powerful people on the Earth [Applause] when we surprisingly to me picked up brother Tim Pruitt at the airport I didn't know that brother Donnie Reagan and sister Carol was sitting in my living room brother on you're talking about Jesus coming to your house well he did I don't know what you're looking for but he did we've just been together just a few moments and I asked him not you know I asked them immediately I don't want to live with this thing no longer I don't want to live with this torment maybe you're sitting in your Pew and you can make the same statement I don't want to take this home [Applause] I'm tired of lying and cheating I'm tired of stealing I'm tired of lusting I'm tired of being in pornography I'm tired of this Tormentor in my life I don't want to leave this building without [Applause] let me just say this to you they begin to pray your pastor spoke in tongues for about 10 minutes brother Kim rebuke the spirit of fear and torment of cancer the spirit that comes with cancer I want to tell you the moment that they stopped praying that left it has never returned thank you so God be the glory once you come into contact with Jesus it doesn't make any difference what the critic says it doesn't make any difference or what everybody else says it don't make no difference when we are with you with Jesus everything is going to be all right thank you now everything is orchestrated of God maybe to even build his faith just a little bit more there was a woman that had suffered with a blood issue and she had been to the best doctors in the world and they couldn't help her they could only take her money but they couldn't help her but she decided if Jesus is not coming to me I'm going to him sometimes you got to make a journey it might be 17 hours but you got to make a journey she didn't need a private interview she didn't need him to tell her her story she didn't need nothing others were were trying to keep her back she was unclean up nobody else could help her they only was her critic but she had a revelation in her heart I don't need him to call my name I don't need him to lay his hands on me if I can only Touch the Hem of His garments [Music] you know the story who touched me she never lived with that ever again in her life it was over pretty incredible when it's over you've had cancer all this time and then it's over I'm going to live that I'm gonna come back here and preach to you I lived cancer maybe it was in a prayer line while I was praying for you and I felt something come on to the inside of me I felt something moved through my brain and something through my lungs and something through my lymph nodes I just felt him and he watched that take place then one of these preacher friends came trouble not the master your daughter's dead news doesn't trouble Jesus [Applause] don't worry bad news doesn't trouble Jesus it it only makes the story better stupid devil it may not be socially correct but I want you to say it with me stupid devil Jesus reminded him again I'm with you when I left where we was I'm going to complete my mission I'm on a mission to come to your house and she's not dead she's asleep no doubt as they got closer they heard the they heard the music playing and wailing and crying Jesus didn't applaud him what is this she died she's not dead she's asleep he didn't ask them to join in prayer he cast the unbelief out sometimes you've got to dismiss service of the unbelief belief [Applause] that was a girl I know I know it was a god we're from the southern part of Heaven you know we're Fighters [Applause] foreign trying to compose myself for a moment there wasn't a question in his mind of what was getting ready to take place I I want to I want to as we come to the end there's not a question in my mind of what's getting ready to take place tonight if brother Donnie felt led for us to come and God gave us these words to preach then God's on a mission when he told me Monday night exactly what to say and what to preach and he's going to do some work and there's people that are sitting in this building one way and they're going to leave another way maybe your heart is filled with sorrow let it be filled with joy maybe you need the Holy Ghost you can be so full until the devil don't know what to do with you whatever disease that you've got you came in one way you can walk out a different way I believe that with everything that is within me how strongly do you believe it brother Branham said when that little boy was laying there dead in Finland he said you could have lined up every devil in hell and they couldn't stop it brother Branham City Knew by the vision that that boy in just a few minutes was going to be off off of the ground and was going to be totally well it didn't matter what critic we're standing around him it don't matter what they say today ever never lined up but they couldn't stop it they can line up tonight but they can't stop what God wants to do for you maybe we could call her name Erica you can pull all the sheets you want to but when Jesus walks in the room she has a purpose and we remind God she has a purpose to be a wife to be a daughter to be a mother and we come to destroy the works of the devil [Music] brother you're afraid no I know what side I'm on I haven't found you yet sister Vicki but your pastor told me a few moments ago that but the Terry had been caught there you are pretty hot your pastor told me that your husband had been carrying you in and out of church the last couple of years but you know when you get well you become a socialite again and your husband winds up sitting in the car being impatient brother West we were in Pigeon Forge here months ago and you prayed that morning you know if we could get to brother Ryan have him pray for our daughter you know we're only about four or five hours away you've prayed for our daughter and your mother ran into sister Connie in a store and brother Ron was just a few stores down listen you go to Pigeon Forge there's two million people with you you go to other to relax and two million people went to the same spot he prays that prayer that morning and that morning we sat down and had plans and I told Connie I said you know I feel strange those plans won't work maybe we can do something different and so we did something different and we wound up at that mall even God goes to Tanger Mall [Applause] you can't orchestrate it you asked me to pray we didn't go somewhere secretly and privately we joined hands right there on the sidewalk I don't have a count but maybe 12 15 of us I'm not ashamed [Music] [Applause] I climbed into a car after a tent meeting and I'm done and when I climbed into the car they call me they said brother Ron there's a little girl in a wheelchair will you come and pray for her and I got back out of that car and I as I got out of the car I said she'll be well I walked under that tent her mother was not a Believer but she had heard about this meeting I took her feet into my hands and they were balled up and as I prayed I felt her feet release she said I believe I can walk [Applause] Jesus came to her house the interesting thing was brother jaw the interesting thing was as she was running I said God put it in your heart to bring her but he's really after you you're a pop music star and you need Jesus Christ I'd give that music up and give my life to Jesus Christ and she fell right in that moment and gave her her life to Jesus Christ one more can I give woman one more I was with brother Tom Ray and brother Murphy Wong and brother Glenn Bruner in China and we were preaching to hundreds of people and brother Tom told me said Don't wear a sports jacket don't wear a dress shirt don't wear a tie when I left when I was getting ready to leave the room the Lord spoke to me said find a tie I went up and down the hall of that hotel knocking on doors I didn't care who answered I needed to find a time I didn't know which room Glenn gruner was in and I knocked on his room he opened door said well you need brother and I said I need a tie he said we're not supposed to wear one I said the Lord told me to put on a tie he said I'll find one [Applause] my brother Tom met me in the elevator he said brother Ryan you're breaking the rules I said he told me he said good deal [Applause] I preached the sermon said we must get to Jesus at the end of that service it was a six-hour prayer line I'm not prophesying but before that prayer line ensued there was a woman crawls from the back of that building on her hands and knees she said she didn't feel worthy to stand and I was bent over praying for somebody else and she reached up and there's a picture somewhere with her fingers on my tie [Music] God note I had to have a tie on so she could touch it I wanna I got news for you she went home well all of us could stand here and give testimony for weeks and months we'll do that for the rest of our life not because that we're the Healer but because he is the Healer not because that we're the Savior but because he's the savior we're only his Representatives and we terrify Satan so we've come one more time to do it again not for a show we're not in the entertainment business but for his glory it is because your need has got his attention your need got his intention we started out this service by reminding you ask him to come to where you're sitting because we want your faith to be built not on a preacher but on God amen that when a minister does what he's called to do and commission to do by the act of laying on the hands that you believe that more than a man laid his hands on you that by the Society of the word of God the Eternal God The God That Never Fails if you can raise that faith enough to expect you can walk out of this building totally will you can walk out of here full of the Holy Ghost and that little question in your life I feel it even now that devil of Torment that's been worrying you in your mind and telling you lie after lie I want you to tell him he's defeated right now could we stand just now thank you for your patience with me Heavenly Father we stand here tonight we believe your word with all of our hearts we have felt your presence we've felt the world of the presence of the Lord your angels here you're among us you promised that you would be here and you keep all of your appointments now Lord we're like a little woman that sold all that she had and bought the best alabaster box that she could get Lord I want to give you my best I don't want to give you halfway Lord Jesus tonight there's many needs all through this building and I stand with men of God that have been commissioned by the greatest message that there's ever been father nobody can take brother branham's place but Lord Jesus we're we're under the same influence of that and we believe the same word now father Lord your children have incredible needs I do so I have expectation tonight to what regardless of what doctors have said that I can be well that I can preach hundreds more sermons not for my glory but for yours that I can be the father I can be the husband I can be a pastor not weakness but in strength Lord Jesus there's homes here that Satan's trying to wreck but they don't have to leave here like that Lord there's people here with all kinds of diseases but they don't have to leave here like that now Satan I know you're here as well but I want to remind you you don't have the keys to your house and you know that you have been stripped you have no bow no arrows for your pool you're a liar you're a buff and you're defeated in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so father Lord Jesus as these children walk through this prayer line tonight foreign I pray that their faith arises to a level like never before touch them now and your words to that little girl was damsel arise [Music] and we repeat that story over and over again because you went to Jerry's house [Music] now let's let us repeat this story that that same Jesus [Music] Brother Don if you'll come and instruct your people foreign you can be seated if you'd like and we'll kind of tell you the direction that we're going to run the power line and all for all of those of you that desire prayer will be lining up around through here coming this way instead of bringing it up on the platform where we have to take up the steps and then down the steps ministers will be standing start right here and line up here so you just come down the aisle straight across shout out run out however you want to get out it's just Lay free Lay free lead change of the power of God Deacon Brothers Soul comments or post to help us to be able to line everybody up every Minister if you haven't already come up and sit up here on the front if you're here tonight and you're like to help us to pray for God's children you're certainly welcome to come and and be with us and remember this is for the ministry of the Lord that Jesus can continue his work that he started two thousand years ago when it come to the Earth this is not for any preachers brother Ron has already said to get any credit in the glory any honor it all goes to the Lord Jesus that's what we believe isn't it so whatever you have need of and if there's some that's that's really urgent and you need to come first you can you can come ahead and for those of you that if it gets long you don't want to stay we certainly understand that you can go out and get you some food on your way out and service in the morning at 11. we so thank you for coming and being here and being a part of this service we trust that the Lord will will bless you if you'll just come all right you can start singing something Minister Brothers if y'all would line up here a double row dick and
